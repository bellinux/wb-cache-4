5|$|Jefferson, on {{the other}} hand, took a stricter view of the Constitution: parsing the text carefully, he found no {{specific}} authorization for a national bank. This controversy was eventually settled by the Supreme Court of the United States in McCulloch v. Maryland, which in essence adopted Hamilton's view, granting the federal government broad freedom to select the best means to execute its constitutionally enumerated powers, specifically the doctrine of implied powers. Nevertheless, the American Civil War and the Progressive Era demonstrated <b>the</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> crises and politics Hamilton's administrative republic sought to avoid.|$|E
5|$|Emphasis {{is placed}} not on actual {{arithmetic}} computation, {{but rather on}} conceptual understanding and interpretation. The course curriculum is organized around four basic themes; the first involves exploring data and covers 20–30% of the exam. Students are expected to use graphical and numerical techniques to analyze distributions of data, including univariate, bivariate, and categorical data. The second theme involves planning and conducting a study and covers 10–15% of the exam. Students {{must be aware of}} the various methods of data collection through sampling or experimentation and <b>the</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> conclusions that can be drawn from the results. The third theme involves probability and its role in anticipating patterns in distributions of data. This theme covers 20–30% of the exam. The fourth theme, which covers 30–40% of the exam, involves statistical inference using point estimation, confidence intervals, and significance tests.|$|E

25|$|I can't quite {{root for}} Lieberman {{to lose his}} primary. What's holding me back is that the anti-Lieberman {{campaign}} has come to stand for much more than Lieberman's sins.

25|$|Lyric poetry, {{in which}} the poet speaks {{of his or her}} own {{feelings}} in the first person and expresses a mood, was not especially common in the Restoration period. Poets expressed their points of view in other forms, usually public or formally disguised poetic forms such as odes, pastoral poetry, and ariel verse. One of the characteristics of the period is its devaluation of individual sentiment and psychology in favour of public utterance and philosophy. <b>The</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> lyric poetry found later in the Churchyard Poets would, in the Restoration, only exist as pastorals.|$|E

5000|$|Two common {{approaches}} to defining [...] "physicalism" [...] are the theory-based and object-based approaches. The theory-based conception of physicalism proposes that [...] "a property is physical if {{and only if}} it either is <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> property that physical theory tells us about or else is a property which metaphysically (or logically) supervenes on <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> property that physical theory tells us about". Likewise, the object-based conception claims that [...] "a property is physical {{if and only if}}: it either is <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> property required by a complete account of the intrinsic nature of paradigmatic physical objects and their constituents or else is a property which metaphysically (or logically) supervenes on <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> property required by a complete account of the intrinsic nature of paradigmatic physical objects and their constituents".|$|R
25|$|The {{appearance}} of more systematic, abstract thinking is another notable aspect of cognitive development during adolescence. For example, adolescents {{find it easier}} than children to comprehend <b>the</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> higher-order abstract logic inherent in puns, proverbs, metaphors, and analogies. Their increased facility permits them to appreciate {{the ways in which}} language can be used to convey multiple messages, such as satire, metaphor, and sarcasm. (Children younger than age nine often cannot comprehend sarcasm at all.) This also permits the application of advanced reasoning and logical processes to social and ideological matters such as interpersonal relationships, politics, philosophy, religion, morality, friendship, faith, fairness, and honesty.|$|E
25|$|Ruth K. MacDonald of the New Mexico State University observes in Beatrix Potter (1986) that Potter {{recommended}} to Warne that Appley Dapply be printed in a format similar to Miss Moppet, which {{had originally been}} printed in a panorama style but, in 1916, had been reprinted in a format slightly smaller than the other books in the Peter Rabbit collection. Miss Moppet was intended for babies and very young children, and MacDonald believes Potter's suggestion indicated she also intended Appley Dapply for the very young who are satisfied with vignettes and <b>the</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> simple, isolated incidents nursery rhymes present, rather than longer, more complex plots.|$|E
25|$|Some positives and negatives of {{recovery}} models were highlighted {{in a study}} of a community mental health service for people diagnosed with schizophrenia. It was concluded that while the approach may be a useful corrective to the usual style of case management - at least when genuinely chosen and shaped by each unique individual on the ground - serious social, institutional and personal difficulties made it essential that there be sufficient ongoing effective support with stress management and coping in daily life. Cultural biases and uncertainties were also noted in the 'North American' model {{of recovery}} in practice, reflecting views about <b>the</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> contributions and lifestyles that should be considered valuable or acceptable.|$|E

25|$|The Hungarian {{equivalent}} for {{sparkling wine}} is ’pezsgő’. The beginning of significant sparkling wine production in Hungary is dated {{back to the}} first half of the 19th century. The first wineries of sparkling wine were founded near Pozsony (today Bratislava) by Johann Fischer and dr. Michael Schönbauer in 1825 (first in Central-Europe) and Esch és Társa in 1835. A couple of decades later the main producers moved to the Buda Hills and Budafok nearby the capital creating a new center of production, the so-called ’Hungarian Champagne’ still existing nowadays. At the end of the 19th century the two most important wineries were József Törley és Társa moving from Reims, France to Budafok in 1882 and Louis és César-François founded in 1886. After the Soviet era the Hungarian wine sector was reborn. New and old wineries are seeking for the forgotten roots. Most of the Hungarian sparkling wines are made by the charmat and transvasée methods and a small but steadily growing amount by the traditional, champagneois method. <b>The</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> grape used during production can be international like Chardonnay, Pinot noir, Riesling, Muscat Ottonel, Muscat Lunel or natives like Olaszrizling, Kékfrankos, Furmint, Királyleányka, Hárslevelű, Kéknyelű and Juhfark.|$|E
25|$|Where {{archaeology}} {{attests to}} a continuing Dacian presence, {{it also shows}} a simultaneous process of Romanization. Traditional Dacian pottery has been uncovered in Dacian settlements, together with Roman-manufactured pottery incorporating local designs. The increasing Romanization of Dacia meant {{that only a small}} number of earlier Dacian pottery styles were retained unchanged, such as pots and the low thick-walled drinking mug that has been termed the Dacian cup. These artifacts were usually handmade; the use of the pottery wheel was rare. In the case of homes, the use of old Dacian techniques persisted, as did <b>the</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> ornaments and tools used prior to the establishment of Roman Dacia. Archaeological evidence from burial sites has demonstrated that the native population of Dacia was far too large to have been driven away or wiped out in any meaningful sense. It was beyond the resources of the Romans to have eliminated the great majority of the rural population in an area measuring some 300,000 square kilometres. Silver jewellery uncovered in graves show that some of the burial sites are not necessarily native Dacian in origin, but are equally likely to have belonged to the Carpi or Free Dacians who are thought to have moved into Dacia sometime before 200 AD.|$|E

The Toronto Star describes the content as [...] "about <b>the</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> doubts, excesses, betrayals and creeping paranoid suspicions that arrive hand-in-hand with celebrity."

500|$|Later observations, however, {{have caused}} the {{dopamine}} hypothesis to lose popularity, at least in its simple original form. [...] For one thing, patients with schizophrenia do not typically show measurably increased levels of brain dopamine activity. [...] Also, other dissociative drugs, notably ketamine and phencyclidine that act on glutamate NMDA receptors (and not on dopamine receptors) can produce psychotic symptoms. Perhaps most importantly, those drugs that do reduce dopamine activity are a very imperfect treatment for schizophrenia: [...] they only reduce a subset of symptoms, while producing severe short-term and long-term side effects. [...] Even so, many psychiatrists and neuroscientists {{continue to believe that}} schizophrenia involves some sort of dopamine system dysfunction. [...] As the [...] "dopamine hypothesis" [...] has evolved over time, however, <b>the</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> dysfunctions it postulates have tended to become increasingly subtle and complex.|$|E

However, the Seventh Circuit has held that according to the Supreme Court's ruling in Drayton, a suspect was unlawfully detained when police approached him in a dark alley and asked him questions. The Seventh Circuit described the encounter as [...] "coercive" [...] and distinguished it from the events that transpired in Drayton because [...] "lleys are distinguishable from <b>the</b> <b>sorts</b> <b>of</b> open, populated spaces in which police questioning is typically deemed consensual". The court noted that [...] "'a reasonable person may feel ... more secure in his or her decision not to cooperate with police on a bus than in other circumstances' because 'many fellow passengers are present [...] to witness officers’ conduct'".|$|E
