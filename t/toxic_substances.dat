5|$|Many {{localized}} {{areas are}} subject to human-made pollution {{of the air and}} water, acid rain and <b>toxic</b> <b>substances,</b> loss of vegetation (overgrazing, deforestation, desertification), loss of wildlife, species extinction, soil degradation, soil depletion and erosion.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{processes}} {{can also}} introduce <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> into nontoxic honey produced from nontoxic nectar. Microorganisms in honey can convert {{some of the}} sugars in honey to ethanol. This process of ethanol fermentation is intentionally harnessed to produce the alcoholic beverage called mead from fermented honey.|$|E
40|$|The {{blood of}} closed {{duodenal}} loop dogs is not toxic to normal dogs. The blood of dogs {{that have been}} fatally poisoned with duodenal loop fluid is likewise non-toxic to normal dogs. The mucosa of closed or drained duodenal loops contains a <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> quite similar to the toxic material found in the lumen of the closed loops. This <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> is absorbed from the mucosa itself and not from the lumen of the drained loops. The same is probably true of the closed loops which have an intact mucosa. It seems highly probable that the poison is formed by the mucosa and is in great part absorbed directly from it by the blood. Normal intestinal mucosa contains no <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> nor can it neutralize in vitro the <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> produced in the closed loops. There {{is no evidence that}} the toxic material when given intravenously is excreted by the intestine or held by the intestinal mucosa in any demonstrable form. The <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> is not absorbed from the normal intestinal tract. Destruction of the mucosa in a closed loop by means of sodium fluoride prevents the formation of the <b>toxic</b> <b>substance.</b> This fact furnishes the final proof that the mucosa is the essential factor in the elaboration of the poisonous material...|$|R

5|$|Other {{metabolites}} {{isolated from}} different species include dibenzonaphtyridinone alkaloids, prenylated phenols, benzofurans, chromenes, natural rubber (polyisoprene), sterols, and the sugar alcohol volemitol. Among <b>toxic</b> <b>substances,</b> Lactarius turpis contains the mutagenic alkaloid necatorin, {{and the small}} compound cycloprop-2-ene carboxylic acid {{has been identified as}} the toxic agent in Russula subnigricans. Some secondary metabolites showed antibiotic properties in laboratory tests. An ethanolic extract of Russula delica was antibacterial, and a lectin from Russula rosea showed antitumor activity.|$|E
5|$|Some longhorn beetles (Cerambycidae) are {{effective}} Batesian mimics of wasps. Beetles may combine coloration with behavioural mimicry, acting like the wasps they already closely resemble. Many other beetles, including ladybirds, blister beetles, and lycid beetles secrete distasteful or <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> {{to make them}} unpalatable or poisonous, and are often aposematic, where bright or contrasting coloration warn off predators; many beetles and other insects mimic these chemically protected species.|$|E
30|$|In fact, {{the liberation}} of <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> by {{phytoplankton}} is not an instantaneous phenomenon, since it must be mediated by some time lag which {{is required for the}} maturity of toxic-phytoplankton. However, {{the liberation of}} <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> at the time t depends on the population size of toxic phytoplankton species at time t-τ _ 3. So, the zooplankton mortality due to the toxic phytoplankton is described by the term p(t-τ _ 3)z(t). In model (1), the term ρ p(t-τ _ 3)z(t)/a+p(t-τ _ 3) describe the distribution of <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> which ultimately contributes to the death of zooplankton populations.|$|R

5|$|A frog's skin is protective, has a {{respiratory}} function, {{can absorb}} water and helps control body temperature. It has many glands, {{particularly on the}} head and back, which often exude distasteful and <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> (granular glands). The secretion is often sticky and helps keep the skin moist, protects against the entry of moulds and bacteria, and make the animal slippery and more able to escape from predators. The skin is shed every few weeks. It usually splits {{down the middle of the}} back and across the belly, and the frog pulls its arms and legs free. The sloughed skin is then worked towards the head where it is quickly eaten.|$|E
5|$|German doctors {{performed}} {{a wide variety}} of experiments on prisoners at Auschwitz. SS doctors tested the efficacy of X-rays as a sterilization device by administering large doses to female prisoners. Prof Dr Carl Clauberg injected chemicals into women's uteruses in an effort to glue them shut. Bayer, then a subsidiary of IG Farben, bought prisoners to use as research subjects for testing new drugs. Prisoners were also deliberately infected with spotted fever for vaccination research and exposed to <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> to study the effects.|$|E
5|$|There {{are large}} {{deposits}} of petroleum (as {{oil and natural}} gas) in rocks beneath the seabed. Offshore platforms and drilling rigs extract the oil or gas and store it for transport to land. Offshore {{oil and gas production}} can be difficult due to the remote, harsh environment. Drilling for oil in the sea has environmental impacts. Animals may be disorientated by seismic waves used to locate deposits, probably causing the beaching of whales. <b>Toxic</b> <b>substances</b> such as mercury, lead, and arsenic may be released. The infrastructure may cause damage and oil may be spilt.|$|E

5|$|The orally {{lethal dose}} in humans has been {{reported}} as approximately 1.4 mL/kg of pure ethylene glycol. That is approximately 224 mL (7.6 oz.) of 50% ethylene glycol for an 80kg adult and 56 mL (2 oz.) for a 20kg child. Although survival with medical treatment has occurred with doses much higher than this, death has occurred with 30 mL of the concentrate in an adult. In the EU classification of dangerous substances it is 'harmful' (Xn) while more <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> are classified as 'toxic' (T) or 'very toxic' (T+). The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency generally puts substances which are lethal at more than 30 g to adults in Toxicity Class III.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars have short {{antennae}} {{and several}} simple eyes. The mouthparts are adapted for chewing with powerful mandibles {{and a pair}} maxillae, each with a segmented palp. Adjoining these is the labium-hypopharynx which houses a tubular spinneret which is able to extrude silk. Butterfly caterpillars have three pairs of true legs on the thoracic segments and up to six pairs of prolegs arising from the abdominal segments. These prolegs have rings of tiny hooks called crochets that are engaged hydrostatically and help the caterpillar grip the substrate. The epidermis bears tufts of setae, the position and number of which help in identifying the species. There is also decoration {{in the form of}} hairs, wart-like protuberances, horn-like protuberances and spines. Internally, most of the body cavity is taken up by the gut, but there may also be large silk glands, and special glands which secrete distasteful or <b>toxic</b> <b>substances.</b> The developing wings are present in later stage instars and the gonads start development in the egg stage.|$|E
5|$|In soft corals, {{there is}} no stony {{skeleton}} but the tissues are often toughened {{by the presence of}} tiny skeletal elements known as sclerites, which are made from calcium carbonate. Soft corals are very variable in form and most are colonial. A few soft corals are stolonate, but the polyps of most are connected by sheets of coenosarc. In some species this is thick and the polyps are deeply embedded. Some soft corals are encrusting or form lobes. Others are tree-like or whip-like and have a central axial skeleton embedded in the tissue matrix. This is composed either of a fibrous protein called gorgonin or of a calcified material. In both stony and soft corals, the polyps can be retracted, with stony corals relying on their hard skeleton and cnidocytes for defence against predators, with soft corals generally relying on chemical defences in the form of <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> present in the tissues known as terpenoids.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} form of self-harm is using a sharp object to cut one's skin, but self-harm also covers a wide range of {{behaviours}} including burning, scratching, banging or hitting body parts, interfering with wound healing (dermatillomania), hair-pulling (trichotillomania) and the ingestion of <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> or objects. Behaviours associated with substance abuse and eating disorders are usually not considered self-harm because the resulting tissue damage is ordinarily an unintentional side effect. However, the boundaries are not always clearly defined and in some cases behaviours that usually fall outside the boundaries of self-harm may indeed represent self-harm if performed with explicit intent to cause tissue damage. Although suicide is not the intention of self-harm, the relationship between self-harm and suicide is complex, as self-harming behaviour may be potentially life-threatening. There is also an increased risk of suicide in individuals who self-harm and self-harm is found in 40–60% of suicides. However, generalising self-harmers to be suicidal is, in the majority of cases, inaccurate.|$|E
5|$|A {{review of}} the data showed that while the vaccine {{schedule}} for infants did not exceed FDA, Agency for <b>Toxic</b> <b>Substances</b> and Disease Registry (ATSDR), or WHO guidelines on mercury exposure, it could have exceeded Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards {{for the first six}} months of life, depending on the vaccine formulation and the weight of the infant. The review also highlighted difficulty interpreting toxicity of the ethylmercury in thiomersal because guidelines for mercury toxicity were based primarily on studies of methylmercury, a different mercury compound with different toxicologic properties. Multiple meetings were scheduled among various government officials and scientists from multiple agencies to discuss the appropriate response to this evidence. There was a wide range of opinions on the urgency and significance of the safety of thiomersal, with some toxicologists suggesting there was no clear evidence that thiomersal was harmful and other participants like Neal Halsey, director of the Institute of Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, strongly advocating removal of thiomersal from vaccines due to possible safety risks. In the process of forming the response to this information, the participants attempted to strike a balance between acknowledging possible harm from thiomersal and the risks involved if childhood vaccinations were delayed or stopped.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybin is metabolized {{mostly in}} the liver. As it becomes {{converted}} to psilocin, it undergoes a first-pass effect, whereby its concentration is greatly reduced before it reaches the systemic circulation. Psilocin is broken down by the enzyme monoamine oxidase to produce several metabolites that can circulate in the blood plasma, including 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetaldehyde, 4-hydroxytryptophol, and 4-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid. Some psilocin is not broken down by enzymes and instead forms a glucuronide; this is a biochemical mechanism animals use to eliminate <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> by linking them with glucuronic acid, which can then be excreted in the urine. Psilocin is glucuronated by the glucuronosyltransferase enzymes UGT1A9 in the liver, and by UGT1A10 in the small intestine. Based on studies using animals, about 50% of ingested psilocybin is absorbed through the stomach and intestine. Within 24hours, about 65% of the absorbed psilocybin is excreted into the urine, and a further 15–20% is excreted in the bile and feces. Although {{most of the remaining}} drug is eliminated in this way within 8hours, it is still detectable in the urine after 7days. Clinical studies show that psilocin concentrations in the plasma of adults average about 8µg/liter within 2hours after ingestion of a single 15mg oral psilocybin dose; psychological effects occur with a blood plasma concentration of 4–6µg/liter. Psilocybin is about 100 times less potent than LSD on a weight per weight basis, and the physiological effects last about half as long.|$|E

5|$|Baleen whales {{can also}} be {{affected}} by humans in more indirect ways. For species like the North Atlantic right whale, which migrates {{through some of the}} world's busiest shipping lanes, the biggest threat is from being struck by ships. The Lloyd's mirror effect results in low frequency propeller sounds not being discernible near the surface, where most accidents occur. Combined with spreading and acoustic shadowing effects, {{the result is that the}} whale is unable to hear an approaching vessel before it has been run over or entrapped by the hydrodynamic forces of the vessel's passage. A 2014 study noted that a lower vessel speed correlated with lower collision rates. The ever-increasing amount of ocean noise, including sonar, drowns out the vocalizations produced by whales, notably in the blue whale which produces the loudest vocalization, which makes it harder for them to communicate. Blue whales stop producing foraging D calls once a mid-frequency sonar is activated, even though the sonar frequency range (1–8kHz) far exceeds their sound production range (25–100Hz). Poisoning from <b>toxic</b> <b>substances</b> such as Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) is generally low because of their low trophic level. Some baleen whales can become victims of bycatch, which is especially serious for North Atlantic right whales considering its small number. Right whales feed with a wide-open mouth, risking entanglement in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Rope wraps around their upper jaw, flippers and tail. Some are able to escape, but others remain entangled. If observers notice, they can be successfully disentangled, but others die over a period of months. Other whales, such as humpback whales, {{can also be}} entangled.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{observations}} on the blood of patients acutely ill with scarlet fever has shown that a <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> can be demonstrated in the serum by means of intracutaneous injections of the serum in persons who have not had scarlet fever and whose serums fail to blanch the rash in scarlet fever. The reaction caused by this substance consists of a bright red local erythema, varying from 20 to 70 mm. in diameter, of 1 to 4 days duration. The severer reactions are moderately indurated and tender, and are followed bypigmentation and desquamation. Control injections in persons whose serums blanch the rash in scarlet fever cause no reaction. The <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> is not neutralized by mixture with a human serum which gives a negative blanching test but is readily neutralized by a human serum which gives a positive blanching test. It is not neutralized by normal horse serum, but is completely neutralized by Dochez's scarlatinal antistreptococcic serum. In {{a limited number of}} observations on the urine of patients with scarlet fever a similar <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> has been found in two out of five cases studied. Since the <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> described appears to resemble the <b>toxic</b> <b>substance</b> found in the filtrates of scarlatinal hemolytic streptococcus cultures by Dick and Dick and since it is neutralized not only by a blanching human serum but also by Dochez's scarlatinal antistreptococcic horse serum, the experiments reported support the conception that scarlet fever is a local infection of the throat by a particular type of Streptococcus hæmolyticus capable of producing a toxin which is absorbed and is the cause of the general manifestations of the disease...|$|R
