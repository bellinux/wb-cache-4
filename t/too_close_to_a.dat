5|$|By December 1942 {{there were}} {{concerns}} that even Oak Ridge was <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> major population center (Knoxville) {{in the unlikely}} event of a major nuclear accident. Groves recruited DuPont in November 1942 to be the prime contractor for the construction of the plutonium production complex. DuPont was offered a standard cost plus fixed-fee contract, but the President of the company, Walter S. Carpenter, Jr., wanted no profit of any kind, and asked for the proposed contract to be amended to explicitly exclude the company from acquiring any patent rights. This was accepted, but for legal reasons a nominal fee of one dollar was agreed upon. After the war, DuPont asked to be released from the contract early, and had to return 33 cents.|$|E
5|$|The Wiyot {{tribe of}} California {{say that the}} condor recreated mankind after Above Old Man wiped {{humanity}} out with a flood. However, other tribes, such as California's Mono, viewed the condor as a destroyer, not a creator. They say that Condor seized humans, cut off their heads, and drained their blood {{so that it would}} flood Ground Squirrel's home. Condor then seized Ground Squirrel after he fled, but Ground Squirrel managed to cut off Condor's head when Condor paused to take a drink of the blood. According to the Yokut tribe, the condor sometimes ate the moon, causing the lunar cycle, and his wings caused eclipses. The Chumash tribe of Southern California believed that the condor was once a white bird, but it turned black when it flew <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fire.|$|E
25|$|Rare Earth {{argues that}} a gas giant must not be <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> body where life is developing. Close {{placement}} of gas giant(s) could disrupt the orbit of a potential life-bearing planet, either directly or by drifting into the habitable zone.|$|E

25|$|Based on the {{stand-up}} comedy of Tim Allen, Home Improvement {{made its debut}} on ABC on September 17, 1991, {{and was one of}} the highest-rated sitcoms for almost the entire decade. It went to No.1 in the ratings during the 1993–1994 season; the same year Allen had the No.1 book (Don't Stand <b>Too</b> <b>Close</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Naked Man) and movie (The Santa Clause).|$|E
25|$|Bald-faced hornets are omnivorous, and are {{considered}} to be beneficial due to their predation of flies, caterpillars, and spiders. However, their aggressively defensive nature makes them a threat to humans who wander <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> nest or when a nest is constructed too close to human habitation. They vigorously defend the nest, with workers stinging repeatedly, as is common among social bees and wasps. However, the baldfaced hornet has a unique defense in that it can squirt venom from the stinger into the eyes of vertebrate nest intruders. The venom causes immediate watering of the eyes and temporary blindness.|$|E
25|$|One Ranger, seventeen-year-old , {{who wanted}} to be in on the action, also died in the fighting. He was the son of camp cook, D. R. Smith and the {{youngest}} Ranger ever to die in the line of duty. Smith was apparently too inexperienced to fully appreciate McNelly's terse orders because he got <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> wounded Mexican bandit; the bandit killed the boy before Smith even knew what was happening. Berry Smith was buried in the northwest corner of the Brownsville cemetery on June 16 with full military honors. The funeral was recorded as one of the finest the city had ever seen.|$|E

2500|$|Another, similar {{controversy}} arose when Wolkoff {{decided to}} use [...] "5 Pointz" [...] as the name for the new condominiums being constructed on 5 Pointz's site. He had claimed to own {{the rights to the}} building's name because he owned the building; however, an application to trademark the name was rejected in March 2014 because it was <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> similar, existing trademark. Wolkoff has said that the name refers to the building site, not the art; his comment had insulted some artists at the site, with two artists saying that [...] "it's ironic that the same corporation which single-handedly destroyed all the artwork known as 5Pointz is trying to capitalize on its name" [...] and that [...] "the disrespect continues".|$|E
2500|$|In February 2009, the Swedish prosecutor's office {{started an}} {{investigation}} based on suspicions of bribery and corruption after a college {{on the island}} of Gotland received a donation from Nord Stream. The 5million Swedish kronor (US$574,000) donation was directed to a professor at Gotland University College who had previously warned that the Nord Stream pipeline would come <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> sensitive bird zone. The consortium has hired several former high-ranking officials, such as Ulrica Schenström, former undersecretary at the Swedish Prime Minister's office, and Dan Svanell, former press secretary for several politicians in the Swedish Social Democratic Party. [...] In addition, the former Prime Minister of Finland, Paavo Lipponen, had worked for Nord Stream as an adviser since 2008.|$|E

2500|$|Button {{was born}} on 19 January 1980 in Frome, Somerset and brought up in nearby Vobster. He was named after his father's Danish friend and rallycross {{opponent}} Erling Jensen, changing the [...] "e" [...] to an [...] "o" [...] to differentiate it from Jensen Motors. He was educated at Vallis First School, Selwood Middle School and Frome Community College. He is the fourth child of South African Simone Lyons and former Rallycross driver John Button, who was {{well known in the}} UK during most of the 1970s for his so-called Colorado Beetle Volkswagen, before switching to a VW Golf Mk1 in 1978. After his parents divorced when he was seven, he and his three elder sisters were brought up by their mother in Frome. However, after a while the boy moved to his stepmother Pippa Kerr, who had been married by his father in 1994. When Jenson was 19 years of age John Button and Pipa Kerr divorced. Button junior failed his first driving test for getting <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> parked vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Bianco of USA Today {{wrote that}} {{unlike many other}} HBO productions, [...] "Temple is an {{incredibly}} joyous and often humorous film." [...] While praising the direction and the strong supporting cast of Catherine O'Hara, David Strathairn, and Julia Ormond, Bianco declared that [...] "as good as everything is around them, Temple Grandin belongs to two women: the real Temple, {{who appears to be}} a spectacular human being, and Danes, who is clearly a spectacular actor." [...] The A.V. Club's Noel Murray, himself the father of an autistic son, wrote that [...] "some of the movie's aesthetic choices border on the cliché. The pulsing minimalism of Alex Wurman's score has become as much a shorthand for 'intellectual mystery' as Arabic wailing has for 'Danger! Terrorists!,' and Temple Grandins illustrative animated sequences run a little <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>A</b> Beautiful Mind for my taste." [...] However, Murray gave the film an A-, in part for Danes' success in portraying Grandin as a full-fledged personality instead of [...] "a checklist of symptoms gleaned from a medical journal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Local {{police are}} {{authorized}} {{to kill the}} animals if they {{pose a threat to}} public safety, which in practice almost only means that the animal is getting <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> highway. In 2007, police killed bull moose in separate incidents in Waterbury and Fairfield when each moose came close to a highway. In cases where no threat to the public seems imminent, DEP officials will usually try to tranquilize the animal or harass them into a nearby woods (sometimes by banging on pots or forming a line to try to scare the animal away). [...] In 2008, state authorities knocked out a year-old female moose in New Britain with a tranquilizer dart and released it on state forest land in northern Connecticut. [...] Moose are generally reclusive, but male moose tend to wander about in the fall, during their mating season, and year-old moose tend to wander when their mothers get ready to give birth to new calves, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection. The 2008 New Britain moose, for example, was thought by officials to be the same animal seen in Avon and Farmington the week before.|$|E

5000|$|New water pipes, made of {{zinc-coated}} iron, {{were built}} <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> existing steel gasoline pipeline. The underground humidity caused these materials <b>to</b> create <b>an</b> electrolytic reaction, akin {{to that which}} occurs inside a zinc-carbon battery. As the reaction proceeded it eventually caused the steel pipe <b>to</b> corrode, creating <b>a</b> hole in the pipeline that permitted gasoline to leak {{into the ground and}} into the main sewer pipe.|$|R
50|$|After a {{five year}} {{acquisition}} {{lull in the}} state of Kentucky, Banc One increased its presence in northeast central Kentucky with the acquisition of Lexington-based First Security Corporation of Kentucky with its 28 offices for $204 million in stock in 1992.

2500|$|August 1, 1982: A 27-year-old {{man from}} Long Island {{got out of}} his tipped kayak on the Kayak Experience to right it. While doing so, he stepped on a grate that was either in contact with, or came <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to,</b> <b>a</b> section of live wiring for the {{underwater}} fans that somehow became exposed and he suffered a severe electric shock, which sent him into cardiac arrest. Several other members of his family nearby were also injured. He was taken to a hospital in nearby Warwick, New York where he died later of the shock-induced cardiac arrest. The park at first disputed that the electric current caused his death, saying there were no burns on his body, but the coroner responded that burns generally do not occur in a water-based electrocution. The ride was drained and closed for the investigation. Accounts differed as to the extent of the exposed wiring: the park said it was [...] "just a nick", while others argued it was closer to 8inches (20cm). The state's Labor Department found that the fan was properly maintained and installed and cleared the park of wrongdoing; however, it also said that the current had the possibility to cause bodily harm under certain circumstances. The park claimed it had been vindicated, although it never reopened the ride, saying that people would be afraid to go on it afterwards.|$|E

6000|$|The {{old lady}} from Chicago poked with her parasol at the pools {{as though they}} had been alive. On one {{particularly}} innocent-looking little puddle she turned her back for a moment, and there rose behind her a twenty-foot column of water and steam. Then she shrieked and protested that [...] "she never thought it would ha' done it," [...] and the old man chewed his tobacco steadily, and mourned for steam power wasted. I embraced the whitened stump of a middle-sized pine that had grown all <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> hot pool's lip, and the whole thing turned over under my hand as a tree would do in a nightmare. From right and left came the trumpetings of elephants at play. I stepped into a pool of old dried blood rimmed with the nodding cornflowers; the blood changed to ink even as I trod; and ink and blood were washed away in a spurt of boiling sulphurous water spat out from the lee of a bank of flowers. This sounds mad, doesn't it? ...|$|E

50|$|To {{explain these}} observations, {{researchers}} {{suggest that a}} white dwarf star strayed <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> intermediate-mass black hole and was ripped apart by tidal forces. The black hole is swallowing material from the white dwarf star, and the material’s velocity implies {{the size of the}} black hole. In this scenario the X-ray emission is produced by debris from the disrupted white dwarf star that is heated as it falls towards the black hole and the optical emission comes from debris further out that is illuminated by these X-rays.|$|R

The first was new water pipes that were built <b>too</b> <b>close</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> existing gasoline pipeline. Chemical reactions between the pipes caused erosion. The second was a flaw in the sewer design that did not allow accumulated gases to escape.|$|R
