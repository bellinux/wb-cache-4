40|$|BACKGROUND: A new technique, <b>therapeutic</b> alloplastic <b>laser</b> in situ keratomileusis {{to correct}} high myopia, is introduced. METHODS: <b>Therapeutic</b> alloplastic <b>laser</b> in situ keratomileusis {{consists}} of neutral homoplastic epikeratoplasty combined with superficial keratectomy performed with an excimer laser and/or a microkeratome. Indications for the technique are: myopia over 20 diopters (D), eyes with corneal scarring after photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), complications following keratomileusis, radial keratotomy complications with undercorrection, and keratoconus suspect myopic eyes. RESULTS: In all five eyes we achieved precise corneal lathing with the microkeratome or the excimer laser, and obtained a clear allograft. In all eyes, we maintained or improved the patient's spectacle -corrected visual acuity related to baseline values. We did not induce astigmatism, and corneal thickness was almost unchanged.

40|$|Low level lasers, cold or soft lasers: These lasers do {{not produce}} thermal effects on tissues and induce photoreactions in cells through light {{stimulation}} which is called photobiostimulation. Power of these lasers is usually under 250 mW. The main point differentiating low level lasers and high power ones is the activation of photochemical reactions without heat formation. The most important factor to achieve this light characteristic in lasers is not their power, but their power density for each surface unit (i. e cm 2). Density lower than 670 mW/cm 2, can induce the stimulatory effects of low level lasers without thermal effects. Low level <b>lasers</b> (<b>therapeutic)</b> used today as treatment adjunctive devices in medicine and dentistry.

40|$|Objective: This study {{investigated}} {{the effects of a}} <b>therapeutic</b> <b>laser,</b> passive stretching, and their combined treatment on the strength of Achilles tendons with overuse pathologies. Background data: Tendinopathy involving overuse is usually treated with exercise and stretching, but there has been no report on the treatment effect of a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>laser</b> combined with passive stretching on managing this condition. Despite the beneficial effect of a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>laser</b> on healing tendons that have had traumatic injury, its effect on degenerative tendons is not known. Methods: Twenty-five mature Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were used, with 20 subjected to daily bipedal downhill running for 8 weeks, to induce Achilles overuse, and 5 as normal controls. The exercised rats were divided into four groups: 1, laser treatment; 2, passive stretching; 3, combined laser and stretching; and 4, no treatment, running controls. GaAlAs laser with 660 nm wavelength was applied to both Achilles tendons for 50 sec for Groups 1 and 3. Passive stretching of 20 times/ 10 sec of maximum ankle plantar flexion was applied to Groups 2 and 3. Treatments were applied after each running session for a a total of 56 treatment sessions. On week 9, the tendons were tested for load-relaxation, stiffness, and ultimate strength. Results: Stiffness was different (p = 0. 01), difference in ultimate strength was marginally insignificant (p = 0. 07), and load-relaxation difference was not significant among groups. Post-hoc analyses revealed that the mean stiffness of all the four exercise groups was lower than the normal control, whereas the ultimate strength from the laser and combined laser and stretching was not {{different from that of the}} normal control group, but was higher than that of the passive stretching and no treatment groups. Conclusions: We conclude that a <b>therapeutic</b> <b>laser</b> and combined laser with passive stretching might slow down the decrease in Achilles tendon strength but would not be able to stop the pathological changes of overuse from developing.

However, the reported outcomes of studies to date are contradictory and the literature provides limited evidence to support an additional benefit of laser application. The overall aim of the present thesis was to explore the potential of adjunctive application of <b>therapeutic</b> and surgical <b>lasers</b> to improve treatment outcomes, expressed in terms of clinical, radiographic and immunological parameters. The present thesis is based on a series of four clinical studies of patients with moderately severe periodontitis, treated by scaling and root planing. Two different types of dental <b>laser</b> were investigated. <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>lasers,</b> which are claimed to stimulate cell regeneration and boost the immune system, were investigated in studies I and II: the general effect was investigated in Study I, while Study II compared the difference between gas and diode lasers in the same spectrum, in order to evaluate the importance of the length of coherence in biostimulation. In studies III and IV, the surgical Nd:YAG laser, which is usually applied for sulcular debridement and pocket decontamination, was evaluated in a novel approach. The test procedure comprised one single application of the laser with water coolant after conventional scaling and root planing. In study III, the outcome was evaluated after 3 months and in Study IV the long term outcome was evaluated, at least one year post-treatment. The split mouth design was used in all four studies. Study I showed a better clinical outcome on the laser treated side and some improvement in immunological parameters. The results of Study II support the hypothesis that a laser with a long length of coherence is superior to one of a shorter length, although both lasers had some positive clinical effect. In Study III a single application of the Nd:YAG laser as an adjunct to scaling and root planing improved the short-term outcome and Study IV confirmed that this improvement was sustained. In conclusion, the results of these studies confirm the potential role of laser irradiation as a non-invasive adjunctive to scaling and root planing in the treatment of periodontitis...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{diagnostics}} {{and therapy}} is nowadays very {{strongly influenced by}} technological developments. New discoveries in physics, electronics and other fields lead to search for applications in the medical field. Laser is no exception. It {{is one of the}} most important technological discoveries of the late 20 th century. A lot of targeted researches and multiple observations demonstrated beneficial effects of the laser radiation on living tissue. Laser was also confirmed to be used in medicine. Recently, laser therapy has been more and more popular. Lasers have found their place and application in almost all areas of medicine, both in treatment and also in research; it has been constantly developing dynamically. Laser Therapy (LLLT) is a branch of phototherapy, which uses light (laser or non-coherent monochromatic beam) for treatment of various diseases. Laser means light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. This method of treatment is special as it does not lead to serious side effects and treatment does not take so much time to show effectiveness. Laser therapy is very far from practical use of surgical lasers. Laser Therapy (LLLT) is something different containing a lot of scientific utilization characteristics of the laser beam; it uses different colours of the beam to achieve the desired effect for treatment of a particular disease, the correct dosage etc. Surgery uses surgical properties of lasers. These include e. g. surgical knife cutting or tissue welding. Laser therapy possibilities, however, go much further. In this therapy laser is not a mere tool, but a medicine in itself. The power of the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>laser</b> power can be thousands of times smaller and weaker than the power of the surgical one. Many patients still assume that laser therapy consists in the use of surgical lasers, which is, however, not correct. Laser therapy uses non-surgical lasers, which neither cut nor burn. Application of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>laser</b> produces the desired effect in the patient's body by means of the way of cell changes in all cells that are exposed to the beam. It causes increased protein synthesis, immunocorrection, increased ATP production, increased enzymatic activity and circulation, and collagen synthesis. Lasers also regulate lipid metabolism, normalize blood pressure, reduce swelling and inflammation, and reduce pain. Furthermore, leasers have an anti-inflammatory effect, they cause increased cell division and increase immunity against diseases. Lasers have stimulatory, and generally rejuvenilizing and generally healing effects, but when adjusting their dosage they are inhibitory. Thus, using the <b>therapeutic</b> <b>laser</b> brings effective treatment, even if allopathic approach calls many of them incurable...|$|E

It therefore represents an alternative treatment to painful inflammatory oral disorders, especially a chronic disease which requires long-term therapy or to which patients are resistant (Aggarwal et al. 2014). Several low-level lasers have been used for treating oral lichen planus lesions including ultraviolet waves, helium-neon, and more recently diode laser, which has many advantages over other lasers because of its smaller size and wide range of spectrum that enables it to be applied in many medical fields (Jin et al. 2010).|$|E

Low-level laser therapy {{has been shown to}} have photochemical, photophysical, and photobiological effects on cellular metabolism (Migliorati, 2013). Cryotherapy causes vasoconstriction and decreases blood flow to the oral cavity, reducing exposure of the buccal mucosa to chemotherapy (Sorensen et al., 2008). However, its usefulness is limited to only a few chemotherapeutics with short half-lives (Peterson et al., 2013). Further, a large number of natural agents have been explored for oral mucositis treatment (Lalla et al., 2014). Among them, zinc, an essential trace element for some tissue repair processes with antioxidant effects (Yarom et al., 2013), is the only one suggested by the MASCC/ISOO for oral mucositis prevention (Lalla et al., 2014). Overall, among the MASCC/ISOO recommended/suggested therapies, each primarily targets one of the pathological processes of oral mucositis and thus is only moderately effective.
