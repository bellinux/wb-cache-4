50|$|It is {{intended}} that the SGVs replace the former ICRCL values. It {{should be noted}} that the CLEA SGVs relate to assessing chronic (long term) risks to human health and do not apply to the protection of ground workers during construction, or other potential receptors such as groundwater, buildings, plants or other ecosystems. The CLEA SGVs are not directly applicable to a site completely covered in hardstanding, as there is no direct exposure route to contaminated soils. To date, the first ten of fifty-five contaminant SGVs have been published, for the following: arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, inorganic mercury, nickel, selenium ethyl benzene, phenol and toluene. Draft SGVs for benzene, naphthalene and xylene have been produced but their publication is on hold. Toxicological data (Tox) has been published for each of these contaminants as well as for benzoapyrene, benzene, dioxins, furans and dioxin-like PCBs, naphthalene, vinyl chloride, 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethane and 1,1,1,2 tetrachloroethane, 1,1,1 trichloroethane, <b>tetrachloroethene,</b> carbon tetrachloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, trichloroethene and xylene.

50|$|The Alpha Ridge {{site was}} {{situated}} in a section of Marriottsville Maryland that was converting from mainly agricultural use to residential development. In 1987 The State granted permission to dig the landfill within 5 feet from the water table. Yearly water quality surveys were performed only in September 1978 and January 1991. By 1992, 1,600 residents in 300-400 subdivisions drew well water from the Alpha Ridge watershed. Well tests onsite in 1992 revealed contamination from seven paint and degreaser related compounds at eight times the current EPA limits and <b>tetrachloroethene</b> at twenty times the limits. A May 1992 test revealed that the clay lining and bedrock were not adequate to prevent contamination into the groundwater. In January 1993, the County executive claimed {{he had not been}} given the results to act upon. In 1993, the county faced multiple contamination issues, as the older Cars Mill landfill was found to have 390 drums of hazardous chemicals dumped on the landfill years after it was closed. In May 1993, Howard County Department of Planning and Zoning director Joeseph Rutter amends the county water service area to include land around the landfill including a new Donald R Reuwer development on the historic Waverly Plantation. The director announced the effort was for safety, not increased housing density around the contaminated site, but joined Reuwer's land development company later.|$|E
50|$|In January 1997 {{the first}} phase of a Remedial Investigation of the entire site was completed. On the West Gate Landfill a cap was {{constructed}} as a remedy and completed in September 2011. The second landfill, the Rubble Disposal Area was excavated with off-site disposal of PCB-impacted soil from a wetland area, topped by a soil cap, marked with institutional controls and has 30-year long-term monitoring in place since 2007, although methane gas concentrations emanating from the site still await corrective action. The Small Landfill where thallium and zinc were present in one groundwater monitoring well needed no corrective action as of 2002. The Sewage Treatment Plant contained organochlorine pesticides, including dieldrin and 4,4'-DDT. A Record of Decision was signed in April 2008 and most of the contaminated soil has been excavated, petroleum contaminated soils remain and construction is still underway. Building 81 caused migration of VOC's into nearby groundwater, and in-situ chemical oxidation treatment started in September 2000, but failed.

40|$|A {{regional}} survey of eight {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs), namely BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and p-xylene) and four chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs: chloroform, 1, 2 -dichloroethane, trichloroethene and <b>tetrachloroethene),</b> was carried out at 174 sites, in 17 alluvial aquifers of Abruzzo, a Mediterranean region of southern Italy, from 2004 to 2009. Frequency of detection, concentration range, spatial distribution pattern, and temporal trend of contaminant concentration in each aquifer were analyzed {{as well as the}} relationships between VOC concentrations and the total amount of precipitation during the 90. days preceding each sampling date. A review of published ecotoxicological data, providing an indication of the biological risk associated with the observed levels of VOC contamination, was presented and discussed. BTEX concentrations were under detection limits in all the investigated aquifers, indicating absence of contamination. In contrast, CAH contamination occurred in 14 out of 17 aquifers. The two most frequently detected compounds were chloroform and <b>tetrachloroethene.</b> No significant temporal trend was observed for chloroform and <b>tetrachloroethene</b> concentrations during the six years of observation, indicating the persistence of stable contaminations, except for some slightly decreasing trends observed in three out of 17 aquifers. In four aquifers chloroform and <b>tetrachloroethene</b> concentrations increased with precipitations in the preceding months. Spatial patterns of contamination differed among aquifers, indicating highly complex contaminant distributions at aquifer scale not related to single-plume geometries. Patterns of contamination by chloroform and <b>tetrachloroethene</b> in the most urbanized aquifers were likely associated with multiple sources of VOCs not clearly detectable at the scale used in this study. In five out of 17 aquifers, chloroform and <b>tetrachloroethene</b> co-occurred at concentrations that are lethal to groundwater-dwelling organisms under a short exposure period (four days).

40|$|Simple and {{cost-effective}} analytical methods {{are required to}} overcome the barriers preventing the use of exhaled air in routine occupational biological monitoring. Against this background, a new method is proposed that simplifies the automation and calibration of the analytical measurements. End-exhaled air is sampled using valveless gas sampling tubes made of glass. Gaseous analytes are transferred to a liquid phase using a microscale solvent extraction performed directly inside the gas sampling tubes. The liquid extracts are analysed using a gas chromatograph equipped, as usual, with a liquid autosampler, and liquid standards are used for calibration. For demonstration purposes, the methodâs concept {{was applied to the}} determination of <b>tetrachloroethene</b> in end-exhaled air, which is a biomarker for occupational <b>tetrachloroethene</b> exposure. The methodâs performance was investigated in the concentration range 2 to 20 [*]Î¼g tetrachloroethene/L, which corresponds to todayâs exposure levels. The calibration curve was linear, and the intra-assay repeatability and recovery rate were sufficient. Analysis of real samples from dry-cleaning workers occupationally exposed to <b>tetrachloroethene</b> and from nonexposed subjects demonstrated the methodâs utility.

40|$|We {{report the}} results of {{laboratory}} and modeling investigations of the atmospheric fate of chlorinated ethenes and their role as indicators of halogen reactions in the springtime Arctic troposphere. The kinetics and mechanism of the gas-phase reactions of Cl- and Br-atoms with <b>tetrachloroethene</b> were studied using a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) in 93. 3 kPa air and T = 296 +/- 2 K. Along with our previous study on Cl and Br atom reactions of trichloroethene, using the known rate of the Cl + ethane reaction as reference, the values of 7. 2 +/- 0. 2 x 10 â»Â¹Â¹ and 3. 8 +/- 0. 2 x 10 â»Â¹Â¹ cmÂ³ moleculeâ»Â¹ sâ»Â¹ were obtained for the Cl-atom reaction rate constants of tri-and <b>tetrachloroethene,</b> respectively. For the Br-atom reactions, using ethene and propane as the reference molecules, we report the absolute values of 1. 1 +/- 0. 1 x 10 â»Â¹Â³ and 9. 0 +/- 0. 1 x 10 â»Â¹â· cmÂ³ moleculeâ»Â¹ sâ»Â¹ for the rates of Br attack on tri- and <b>tetrachloroethene.</b> The major products were XClâC-C(O) Cl (X = H in trichloroethene and X = Cl in <b>tetrachloroethene)</b> and XBrClC-C(O) Cl in Cl-atom and Br-atom initiated reactions, respectively. We also observed phosgene and formyl chloride in the reactions of trichloroethene and phosgene in the <b>tetrachloroethene</b> reactions and report the branching ratios for these channels. Our observations show that the addition of Cl-atoms to the less substituted carbon is the major reaction pathway and that a Cl-atom is subsequently released after either Cl- or Br-atoms add to trichloroethene or <b>tetrachloroethene,</b> leading to the recycling of active halogen. We carried out a box modeling exercise to apply the kinetic and mechanistic information obtained in this work to the interpretation of measurements of CâHClâ, CâClâ and other hydrocarbons in the Arctic troposphere.
