40|$|The {{evaporation}} of {{the black}} holes during <b>the</b> very <b>early</b> <b>universe</b> is studied.

5|$|A {{hierarchical}} structure of matter began to form from minute {{variations in the}} mass density of space. Matter accumulated in the densest regions, forming clouds of gas and the earliest stars, the Population III stars. These massive stars triggered the reionization process and {{are believed to have}} created many of the heavy elements in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>Universe,</b> which, through nuclear decay, create lighter elements, allowing the cycle of nucleosynthesis to continue longer.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{a number}} of {{land-based}} gravitational wave detectors are in operation, and a mission to launch a space-based detector, LISA, is currently under development, with a precursor mission (LISA Pathfinder) which was launched in 2015. Gravitational wave observations {{can be used to}} obtain information about compact objects such as neutron stars and black holes, and also to probe the state of <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>universe</b> fractions of a second after the Big Bang.|$|E
40|$|Observational {{cosmology}} {{is in its}} "golden age" with a {{vast amount}} of recent data on the distribution of matter and light in the universe. This data can be used to probe theories of <b>the</b> very <b>early</b> <b>universe.</b> It is small amplitude cosmological fluctuations which encode the information about <b>the</b> very <b>early</b> <b>universe</b> and relate it to current data. Hence, a central topic in these lectures is the "theory of cosmological perturbations", the theory which describes the generation of inhomogeneities in <b>the</b> very <b>early</b> <b>universe</b> and their evolution until the current time. I will apply this theory to three classes of models of <b>the</b> very <b>early</b> <b>universe.</b> <b>The</b> first is "Inflationary Cosmology", the current paradigm for understanding <b>the</b> <b>early</b> evolution of <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b> I will review the successes of inflationary cosmology, but will also focus on some conceptual challenges which inflationary cosmology is facing, challenges which motivate the search for possible alternatives. I will introduce two alternative scenarios, the "Matter Bounce" model and "String Gas Cosmology", and I will discuss how cosmological fluctuations which can explain the current data are generated in those models.

50|$|The {{inflaton}} {{field is}} a hypothetical scalar field that is theorized to drive cosmic inflation in <b>the</b> very <b>early</b> <b>universe.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{field is}} so small {{that only a few}} {{foreground}} stars in the Milky Way lie within it; thus, almost all of the 3,000 objects in the image are galaxies, some of which are among the youngest and most distant known. By revealing such large numbers of very young galaxies, the HDF has become a landmark image in the study of <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>universe.</b>|$|E
5|$|A unique {{window on}} the Universe enabled by Hubble are the Hubble Deep Field, Hubble Ultra-Deep Field, and Hubble Extreme Deep Field images, which used Hubble's {{unmatched}} sensitivity at visible wavelengths to create images of small patches of sky that are the deepest ever obtained at optical wavelengths. The images reveal galaxies billions of light years away, and have generated a wealth of scientific papers, providing a new window on <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>Universe.</b> The Wide Field Camera 3 improved the view of these fields in the infrared and ultraviolet, supporting the discovery {{of some of the}} most distant objects yet discovered, such as MACS0647-JD.|$|E
5|$|Formation of {{the carbon}} atomic nucleus {{requires}} a nearly simultaneous triple collision of alpha particles (helium nuclei) within {{the core of a}} giant or supergiant star which is known as the triple-alpha process, as the products of further nuclear fusion reactions of helium with hydrogen or another helium nucleus produce lithium-5 and beryllium-8 respectively, both of which are highly unstable and decay almost instantly back into smaller nuclei. This happens in conditions of temperatures over 100 megakelvin and helium concentration that the rapid expansion and cooling of <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>universe</b> prohibited, and therefore no significant carbon was created during the Big Bang.|$|E
50|$|Fecund universes is a multiverse {{theory of}} Lee Smolin {{about the role}} of black holes. The theory has black holes and loop quantum gravity {{connecting}} <b>early</b> <b>universes</b> together. Loop quantum gravity can be pulled into black holes. In Fecund universes, each new universes, according to Lee Smolin, has slightly different laws of physics. Because these laws are only slightly different, each is assumed to be like a mutation of <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>universes.</b>|$|R
50|$|This {{contrasts}} with the approach used by some big historians who divide the narrative into many more thresholds, {{as noted in the}} discussion {{at the end of this}} section below. Yet another telling of the Big-Bang-to-humankind story is one that emphasizes <b>the</b> <b>earlier</b> <b>universe,</b> particularly <b>the</b> growth of particles, galaxies, and large-scale cosmic structure, such as in physical cosmology.|$|R

5|$|Max Tegmark {{developed}} a four-part classification scheme {{for the different}} types of multiverses that scientists have suggested in various problem domains. An example of such a model is the chaotic inflation model of <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>universe.</b> Another is the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. Parallel worlds are generated {{in a manner similar to}} quantum superposition and decoherence, with all states of the wave function being realized in separate worlds. Effectively, the multiverse evolves as a universal wavefunction. If the Big Bang that created our multiverse created an ensemble of multiverses, the wave function of the ensemble would be entangled in this sense.|$|E
5|$|Populations {{of stars}} have been aging and evolving, so that distant galaxies (which are {{observed}} {{as they were}} in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>universe)</b> appear very different from nearby galaxies (observed in a more recent state). Moreover, galaxies that formed relatively recently, appear markedly different from galaxies formed at similar distances but shortly after the Big Bang. These observations are strong arguments against the steady-state model. Observations of star formation, galaxy and quasar distributions and larger structures, agree well with Big Bang simulations of the formation of structure in the universe, and are helping to complete details of the theory.|$|E
5|$|The first non-visual {{study of}} galaxies, {{particularly}} active galaxies, was made using radio frequencies. The Earth's atmosphere is nearly transparent to radio between 5MHz and 30GHz. (The ionosphere blocks signals below this range.) Large radio interferometers {{have been used}} to map the active jets emitted from active nuclei. Radio telescopes {{can also be used to}} observe neutral hydrogen (via 21cm radiation), including, potentially, the non-ionized matter in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>Universe</b> that later collapsed to form galaxies.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>{{universe}}'s</b> inflationary period, all {{the matter}} and energy in the universe was set on an inertial trajectory consistent with the equivalence principle and Einstein's {{general theory of relativity}} and this is when the precise and regular form of the universe's expansion had its origin (that is, matter in the universe is separating because it was separating in the past due to the inflaton field).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>earliest</b> <b>universe</b> is opaque {{since the}} cosmos was so {{energetic}} then that most matter was ionized and photons were scattered by free electrons. However, this opacity would not affect gravitational waves from that time, {{so if they}} occurred at levels strong enough to be detected at this distance, it would allow a window to observe the cosmos beyond the current visible universe. Gravitational-wave astronomy therefore may some day allow direct observation of <b>the</b> <b>earliest</b> history of <b>the</b> <b>universe.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Due to the {{weakness}} of the coupling of gravity to matter, gravitational waves experience very little absorption or scattering, even as they travel over astronomical distances. In particular, gravitational waves are expected to be unaffected by the opacity of <b>the</b> very <b>early</b> <b>universe.</b> In these <b>early</b> phases, space had not yet become [...] "transparent," [...] so observations based upon light, radio waves, and other electromagnetic radiation that far back into time are limited or unavailable. Therefore, gravitational waves are expected in principle to have the potential to provide a wealth of observational data about <b>the</b> very <b>early</b> <b>universe.</b>|$|R
5|$|In modern cosmological theory, {{diffusion}} damping, {{also called}} photon diffusion damping, {{is a physical}} process which reduced density inequalities (anisotropies) in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>universe,</b> making the universe itself and {{the cosmic microwave background}} radiation (CMB) more uniform. Around 300,000 years after the Big Bang, during the epoch of recombination, diffusing photons travelled from hot regions of space to cold ones, equalising the temperatures of these regions. This effect is responsible, along with baryon acoustic oscillations, the Doppler effect, and the effects of gravity on electromagnetic radiation, for the eventual formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters, these being the dominant large scale structures which are observed in the universe. It is a damping by diffusion, not of diffusion.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} Big Bang, {{primordial}} protons and neutrons formed from the quark–gluon plasma of <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>Universe</b> as it cooled below two trillion degrees. A few minutes later, {{in a process}} known as Big Bang nucleosynthesis, nuclei formed from the primordial protons and neutrons. This nucleosynthesis formed lighter elements, those with small atomic numbers up to lithium and beryllium, but the abundance of heavier elements dropped off sharply with increasing atomic number. Some boron may have been formed at this time, but the next heavier element, carbon, was not formed in significant amounts. Big Bang nucleosynthesis shut down after about 20 minutes due to the rapid drop in temperature and density of the expanding Universe. Subsequent formation of heavier elements resulted from stellar nucleosynthesis and supernova nucleosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|The lepton epoch was {{the period}} in the {{evolution}} of <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>Universe</b> in which the leptons dominated the mass of the Universe. It started roughly 1 second after the Big Bang, after the majority of hadrons and anti-hadrons annihilated each other {{at the end of the}} hadron epoch. During the lepton epoch the temperature of the Universe was still high enough to create lepton/anti-lepton pairs, so leptons and anti-leptons were in thermal equilibrium. Approximately 10 seconds after the Big Bang, the temperature of the Universe had fallen to the point where lepton/anti-lepton pairs were no longer created. Most leptons and anti-leptons were then eliminated in annihilation reactions, leaving a small residue of leptons. The mass of the Universe was then dominated by photons as it entered the following photon epoch.|$|E

5|$|Plans for a Hubble {{successor}} materialized as the Next Generation Space Telescope project, which {{culminated in}} {{plans for the}} James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the formal successor of Hubble. Very different from a scaled-up Hubble, {{it is designed to}} operate colder and farther away from the Earth at the L2 Lagrangian point, where thermal and optical interference from the Earth and Moon are lessened. It is not engineered to be fully serviceable (such as replaceable instruments), but the design includes a docking ring to enable visits from other spacecraft. A main scientific goal of JWST is to observe the most distant objects in the universe, beyond the reach of existing instruments. It is expected to detect stars in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>Universe</b> approximately 280 million years older than stars HST now detects. The telescope is an international collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Canadian Space Agency since 1996, and is planned for launch on an Ariane 5 rocket. Although JWST is primarily an infrared instrument, its coverage extends down to 600nm wavelength light, or roughly orange in the visible spectrum. A typical human eye can see to about 750nm wavelength light, so there is some overlap with the longest visible wavelength bands, including orange and red light.|$|E
