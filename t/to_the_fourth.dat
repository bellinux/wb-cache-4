5|$|During {{excavation}} of the site, four ceramic sherds {{were found in}} the vicinity which the excavator believed were possibly Early Iron Age in origin. Excavation also revealed 830 ceramic sherds dating from Roman Britain; although most of these were dated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> century, the sherds reflected all four centuries of this period. Dated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> century was a hut that had been erected on a flat area adjacent to the barrow. Evidence of human activity at this hut was found in the form of 750 ceramic sherds, charcoal, iron nails, burnt clay, bone, and flint fragments. Examining this assemblage of artefacts, the excavator noted that it was not typical of the item assemblages usually found at Romano-British settlement sites, thus suggesting that the building was a field shelter rather than a house.|$|E

5|$|The Third Division {{championship}} was {{won in the}} 1965–66 {{season and}} Hull remained in the Second Division for 12 years before relegation in 1978. Hull reached the semi-final of the Watney Cup in the tournament's inaugural staging in 1970, where they were beaten by Manchester United in a penalty shoot-out; {{this was the first}} game in English football to be decided by this method. The Final of this competition was reached in 1974, where Hull were beaten by Stoke City. Relegation <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Fourth</b> Division {{for the first time in}} the club's history came in 1981 and a return to the Third Division was secured two years later in the 1982–83 season. The season after, Hull reached the final of the Associate Members' Cup in its inaugural season and were beaten by Bournemouth. Promotion to the Second Division came the following season, although relegations in the 1990–91 and 1995–96 seasons saw the club return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> tier.|$|E
5|$|After {{dropping}} into the Third Division, Cardiff were continuously {{in the lower}} two divisions of the Football League between 1985 and 1993 as the club appointed several managers in attempts to stabilize the team's performances.

In 1995, Cardiff and other Welsh clubs competing in English leagues were banned from entering the Welsh Cup by the Football Association of Wales after pressure from UEFA, {{who did not want}} teams playing in two national cup competitions. Their final match in the competition was a 2–1 defeat to Wrexham in the 1995 final.|$|E
5|$|After the Eagles signed Antonio Freeman to {{a one-year}} {{contract}} in August 2002, Mitchell was demoted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> wide receiver behind Pinkston, Thrash, and Freeman.

Against the Cowboys in week sixteen, Pinkston left the game due to turf toe, and Mitchell caught two passes for 17yards in his place. Mitchell started in place of Pinkston in the last regular season game against the Giants on December 28, and led the team in receiving with four catches for 35yards.|$|E

They then beat Stoke Free Wanderers 5–0, while in the semi-final Burton Wanderers were defeated 3–0 at Stoke's Victoria Ground. The final took place at the same venue as Stoke themselves provided the opposition. The match finished goalless and Albion won the replay 4–2 at Stoney Lane in front of 5,500 supporters.

They faced Wigan Athletic, losing 1–0 in the first leg and in spite of winning the second leg 2–1 with a full strength team, Arsenal was eliminated on aggregate score.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of their victory, Plymouth Argyle {{returned}} to the third tier of English football just one year after being relegated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>fourth</b> tier {{for the first time in}} its history. They returned to the Third Division two years later before being promoted as champions in 2002, and the club followed that up by winning the Second Division in 2004, to reclaim their place in the second tier of English football after a twelve-year hiatus. For Darlington, there was to be more disappointment in the play-offs four years later under David Hodgson, Platt's successor. They reached the Third Division final in 2000, the last to be played at the original Wembley Stadium, and were defeated 10 again; on this occasion to Peterborough United.|$|E
