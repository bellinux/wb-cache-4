5|$|The Hydrophiinae, {{commonly}} known as sea snakes or coral reef snakes, are a subfamily of venomous elapid snakes that inhabit marine environments for {{most or all of}} their lives.

5|$|The name Joan was {{retired in}} 1989 and {{replaced}} by Joyce on the list for the 1994 season. The name will never again {{be used for a}} North Atlantic hurricane.

5|$|Turbines {{also had}} disadvantages. At {{cruising}} speeds much slower than maximum speed, turbines were markedly less fuel-efficient than reciprocating engines.
