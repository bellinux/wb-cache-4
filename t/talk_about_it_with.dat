500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Larry David. Kenny Kramer claimed that there {{actually}} was a [...] "Contest" [...] in which David and some friends of his took part, {{although he did not}} initially want to take part because he thought he could not win it. David won the contest. When David came up with using the idea for an episode of Seinfeld, he did not <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> Seinfeld for a considerable time, because he thought the episode was impossible for him to pitch. However, Seinfeld thought it was not offensive. The original script was not revealed until the night before the cast read-through. The first version written by David was not as clean as the one later broadcast. The note from the censor claimed that David should not use the word [...] "Masturbate". Julia Louis-Dreyfus thought that the episode would never go ahead due to the subject matter. Seinfeld decided {{it would be better to}} remove any references to what George actually did. Seinfeld claimed that what was noteworthy about [...] "The Contest" [...] was the [...] "Dovetailing" [...] of the stories. He claimed that it probably would have been possible to have used the word [...] "masturbation" [...] in the episode (it is notable that in [...] "The Ticket"—an earlier episode in the same season—George says [...] "you must have a good story otherwise it's just masturbation") although it would have probably ended up not being as funny. Part of the opening scene of the episode contains some of the script that was originally meant to be used in [...] "The Seinfeld Chronicles", the original pilot episode.|$|E
2500|$|On November 7, 2014, {{became the}} Dodgers' new Director of Player Development. In that position, {{he had all}} the {{affiliates}} in the Dodgers farm system, as well as the major league team, switch to serving entirely organic food, and take junk food out of the clubhouse. Kapler, known as a proponent of advanced statistics and healthy food, explained his flexible general approach, saying: [...] "One thing {{we want to do is}} avoid locking ourselves into any organizational philosophy that can’t be easily altered or improved. While mining for best practices, we have overarching themes and philosophies, but we don’t want to say, ‘This is what we believe’ and get so dug in that we’re not capable of being nimble as new studies present better ways to approach problems and development. That flexibility is a thought process that we have to constantly <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> players and staff." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We must sharpen it up. It's bad {{to have a}} dull conscience; so you may {{stay here}} till dinner-time, and <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> Nan. I trust you both not to untie yourselves till I say the word." ...|$|E

5000|$|According to David Carradine's book Spirit of Shaolin, it {{was clear}} before {{production}} started that the film {{was going to be}} a version of Akira Kurosawa's 1961 Samurai film Yojimbo, and Carradine <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> executive producer Roger Corman: ...|$|R
6000|$|After lunching I had an hour's {{pleasant}} {{conversation with}} the genial landlord and his buxom good-looking wife; they were both natives of a New Forest village and glad to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> one who knew it intimately. During our talk I happened to use the words--I forget what about--"As a tree falls so must it lie." [...] The landlady turned on me her dark Hampshire eyes with a sudden startled and pained look in them, and cried: [...] "Oh, please don't say that!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know what}} you have called about, Mrs. Ellison, and I don't want to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> you. The squire has grievously wronged my boy. I wouldn't have {{believed}} it of him, but he's done it; so now, ma'm, I give a week's notice of this house, and here's my rent up to that time, and I will send you the key when I go. And now, ma'm, as I don't want any words about it, I think it will be better if you go, at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You noticed that? He {{wanted to}} talk about his crime with me. He wants to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> any one who will listen to him. He is {{consumed}} with an undying pity for the man he slew. That is the first thing, the only thing, in his mind. If he could, I believe he would give his life for the life he took at any moment. But you cannot recreate one life by destroying another. There is no human means of ascertaining justice, but we can always do mercy with divine omniscience." [...] As he spoke the sun pierced the edge of the eastern horizon, and lit up the marble walls and roofs of the Regionic capital which we were approaching.|$|E
3000|$|We {{actually}} <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> the one {{in charge}} of PTA issues, {{that it is important}} for us to know before [signing the procurement contracts] in what range the costs should be, so we don’t get this shock afterwards … [37] [...]...|$|R
50|$|He {{decided to}} come out in the open about his HIV-positive status because he {{believed}} that if he <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> someone that person might use it against him and also knowing the type discrimination surrounding people living with HIV/AIDS that also compelled him to reveal his HIV status.|$|R
50|$|Twelve-year-old Sei has hit puberty and {{is quickly}} {{becoming}} sexually aware, sometimes not as privately as he'd like; erections {{in school and}} other inopportune times plague him. He <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> his school friends, Kinta and Nyanko, in between their feuding over the affections of classmate Yumi, but can't {{figure out what to}} do <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
60|$|It is urged {{against the}} barber that he begins {{by talking about}} the weather; so do all dukes and diplomatists, only that they <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> ostentatious fatigue and indifference, whereas the barber talks about it with an astonishing, nay incredible, {{freshness}} of interest. It is objected {{to him that he}} tells people that they are going bald. That is to say, his very virtues are cast up against him; he is blamed because, being a specialist, he is a sincere specialist, and because, being a tradesman, he is not entirely a slave. But the only proof of such things is by example; therefore I will prove the excellence of the conversation of barbers by a specific case. Lest any one should accuse me of attempting to prove it by fictitious means, I beg to say quite seriously that though I forget the exact language employed, the following conversation between me and a human (I trust), living barber really took place a few days ago.|$|E
6000|$|... "As for my affair," [...] Pen went on, [...] "my dear fellow, if I {{had thought}} matters were so {{critical}} with you, at least I {{would not have}} pained you by choosing you as my confidant. And my business is not serious, at least not as yet. I have not spoken a word about it to Miss Amory. Very likely {{she would not have}} me if I asked her. Only I have {{had a great deal of}} <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> my uncle, who says that the match might be an eligible one for me. I'm ambitious and I'm poor. And it appears Lady Clavering will give her a good deal of money, and Sir Francis might be got to never mind the rest. Nothing is settled, Harry. They are going out of town directly. I promise you I won't ask her before she goes. There's no hurry: there's time for everybody. But, suppose you got her, Foker. Remember what you said about marriages just now, and the misery of a man who doesn't care for his wife; and what sort of a wife would you have who didn't care for her husband?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They are not {{things of}} any importance," [...] Owen, to Fleda's surprise, {{suddenly}} asserted. He had {{not at first}} taken up Mrs. Brigstock's expression of a wish to carry him off: Fleda {{could see that the}} instinct at the bottom of this was that of standing by her, of seeming not to abandon her. But abruptly, all his soreness working within him, it had struck him that he should abandon her still more if he should leave her to be dealt with by her other visitor. [...] "You must allow me to say, you know, Mrs. Brigstock, that I don't think you should come down on Miss Vetch about anything. It's very good of her to take the smallest interest in us and our horrid little squabble. If {{you want to talk about}} it, <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> me." [...] He was flushed with the idea of protecting Fleda, of exhibiting his consideration for her. [...] "I don't like your cross-questioning her, don't you see? She's as straight as a die: I'll tell you all about her!" [...] he declared with an excited laugh. [...] "Please come off with me and let her alone." ...|$|E
50|$|The second chapter, 'Breast Cancer: A Black Lesbian Feminist Experience', is {{a day-to-day}} {{account of her}} cancer experience, from biopsy to mastectomy. Lorde focuses on the {{importance}} of the love received from the women around her throughout her experience. She also harbours her solace at <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> other lesbian cancer survivors. Further, she mentions her refusal to wear a silicon breast after the operation.|$|R
5000|$|In 1996, {{the host}} of NBC's Olympics {{coverage}} Bob Costas, and others, pointed out that Johnson's gold-medal performance in the 200 m (19.32 seconds) was faster than Bailey's 100 m performance (9.84 seconds) in that 19.32 divided by two is 9.66. Bailey later dismissed Costas' comments as [...] "a person who knew nothing <b>about</b> track <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> {{a lot of people}} listening", nonetheless, the sportscaster's remarks touched a nerve.|$|R
5000|$|After his death, Reed's Brady Bunch co-stars - {{most notably}} Barry Williams and Henderson - {{publicly}} acknowledged Reed's sexual orientation, and admitted {{that most of}} the cast and crew of The Brady Bunch were aware, but they did not discuss <b>it</b> <b>with</b> Reed. Williams said about Reed's homosexuality: [...] "Robert didn't want to go there. I don't think he <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> anyone. I just don't think it was a discussion - period." ...|$|R
6000|$|Happily his {{companion}} had misinterpreted his annoyance, and with impulsive German friendship {{threw himself into}} what he believed to be Paul's feelings. [...] "Donnerwetter! Your beautiful countrywoman is made the subject of curiosity just because that stupid baron is persistent in his serious attentions. That is quite enough, my good friend, to make Klatschen here among those animals who {{do not understand the}} freedom of an American girl, or that an heiress may have something else to do with her money than to expend it on the Baron's mortgages. But"--he stopped, and his simple, honest face assumed an air of profound and sagacious cunning--"I am glad to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> you, who of course are perfectly familiar with the affair. I shall now be able to know what to say. My word, my friend, has some weight here, and I shall use it. And now you shall tell me WHO is our lovely friend, and WHO were her parents and her kindred in her own home. Her associates here, you possibly know, are an impossible colonel and his never-before-approached valet, with some South American Indian planters, and, I believe, a pork-butcher's daughter. But of THEM--it makes nothing. Tell me of HER people." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{could have}} gone home much the richest citizen of his country, and {{it might have been}} years before the plunder was missed; but he was human--he could not enjoy his delight alone, he must have {{somebody}} to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with.</b> So he exacted a solemn oath from a Candian noble named Crioni, then led him to his lodgings and nearly took his breath away with a sight of his glittering hoard. He detected a look in his friend's face which excited his suspicion, and was about to slip a stiletto into him when Crioni saved himself by explaining that that look was only an expression of supreme and happy astonishment. Stammato made Crioni a present of one of the state's principal jewels--a huge carbuncle, which afterward figured in the Ducal cap of state--and the pair parted. Crioni went at once to the palace, denounced the criminal, and handed over the carbuncle as evidence. Stammato was arrested, tried, and condemned, with the old-time Venetian promptness. He was hanged between the two great columns in the Piazza--with a gilded rope, out of compliment to his love of gold, perhaps. He got no good of his booty at all--it was ALL recovered.|$|E
6000|$|... '"It {{is always}} the {{unexpected}} that happens," [...] I said in a propitiatory tone. My obtuseness provoked him into a contemptuous [...] "Pshaw!" [...] I suppose he meant that the unexpected couldn't touch him; {{nothing less than the}} unconceivable itself could get over his perfect state of preparation. He had been taken unawares--and he whispered to himself a malediction upon the waters and the firmament, upon the ship, upon the men. Everything had betrayed him! He had been tricked into that sort of high-minded resignation which prevented him lifting as much as his little finger, while these others who had a very clear perception of the actual necessity were tumbling against each other and sweating desperately over that boat business. Something had gone wrong there at the last moment. It appears that in their flurry they had contrived in some mysterious way to get the sliding bolt of the foremost boat-chock jammed tight, and forthwith had gone out of the remnants of their minds over the deadly nature of that accident. It must have been a pretty sight, the fierce industry of these beggars toiling on a motionless ship that floated quietly in the silence of a world asleep, fighting against time for the freeing of that boat, grovelling on all-fours, standing up in despair, tugging, pushing, snarling at each other venomously, ready to kill, ready to weep, and only kept from flying at each other's throats by the fear of death that stood silent behind them like an inflexible and cold-eyed taskmaster. Oh yes! It must have been a pretty sight. He saw it all, he could <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> scorn and bitterness; he had a minute knowledge of it by means of some sixth sense, I conclude, because he swore to me he had remained apart without a glance at them and at the boat--without one single glance. And I believe him. I should think he was too busy watching the threatening slant of the ship, the suspended menace discovered {{in the midst of the}} most perfect security--fascinated by the sword hanging by a hair over his imaginative head.|$|E
50|$|From 1940 to 1953, {{he was the}} {{executive}} director of the Fellowship of Reconciliation, an influential Protestant pacifist organization, where he did antiwar work, advocated nonviolence within the Protestant ecumenical movement, and helped mentor a number of the future leaders of the Civil Rights Movement, including Bayard Rustin. Rustin, a close advisor of Martin Luther King Jr., later claimed that while an advisor to King, he never made a difficult decision without <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> Muste first.|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Smartpunk, drummer Nathan Young commented, [...] "The thing is, some bands {{that are trying to}} get out of the Christian market, they get bummed out by questions <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I don’t really mind it, because I’m a Christian, and I’m okay <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>With</b> the whole term 'Christian Band,' I don’t understand how a band can be Christian. We get the question, 'Is Anberlin a Christian band?' and it’s like, yeah, Anberlin is — as humans".|$|R
2500|$|... "Yes, I've been <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> Lisa [...] Maybe {{in the end}} of {{next year}} we'll start work again. We've been <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> doing {{something}} like taking a small chamber orchestra – 10 or 15 people – and tour with them. And we have to write songs. We have to write new material – totally new – so the whole, entire set will be a new album. Then we'll go into the studio after the tour, record, produce and release a record as well." ...|$|R
5000|$|Kull later {{meets with}} the man's beloved, {{crying in the}} woods, and tries in vain to console her.

She goes out to Snoopy's doghouse to pick a fight, but Snoopy takes the fight out of her with a disarming kiss on the cheek.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{according}} to one Japanese survey, {{more than half of}} Japanese people are fond of talking about blood type and personality. The research also says that people in Japan like blood-typical personality diagnosis and 1. <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> proper knowledge, 2. believe some relationships exist between blood type and personality, 3. feel its traits are applicable to themselves to a certain degree. Results of two other surveys are the same.|$|E
5000|$|John D. Rockefeller, Jr. noticed Thomas's {{work and}} {{employed}} him {{to design the}} Dunbar Apartments (1926-1928), a non-profit cooperative for African Americans in Harlem. Thomas later was appointed the New York State Architect. He designed several hospitals, including the Coney Island Hospital in Brooklyn. A 1931 story on Thomas said he was [...] "of medium height, bald, and a bit round. Better housing is his religion and he <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> the fervor of Billy Sunday." [...] Andrew Jackson Thomas died in 1965.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the years}} The World Almanac has been {{featured}} {{in a number of}} Hollywood films. For example, Fred MacMurray <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> Edward G. Robinson in Double Indemnity; Bette Davis screams <b>about</b> <b>it</b> in All <b>About</b> Eve; Audrey Hepburn and Gary Cooper flirt <b>about</b> <b>it</b> in Love in the Afternoon; it is featured in Miracle on 34th Street when a trial is held to see if Santa Claus really exists; Rosie Perez continually reads it in the film White Men Can't Jump; and Will Smith checks it for the exact time of sunset so he can set his digital watch in I Am Legend.|$|R
2500|$|Blonde sailed for North America in April that year, {{in company}} with the frigate , and via St Helen's, where they {{collected}} a convoy of twenty transports carrying troops under General John Burgoyne. During the voyage Burgoyne was alarmed to see a midshipman on a yardarm balancing on his head. Pownoll reassured {{him that it was}} just one of Pellew's antics, and that 'should [...] fall, he would only go under the ship's hull and come up on the other side.' Later in the voyage Pellew jumped overboard to save a man's life, and was reprimanded for his actions by Pownoll, though he later shed tears when <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> his fellow officers and called Pellew 'a noble fellow.' ...|$|R
5000|$|According to Madison.com, Peg West was [...] "a {{social worker}} in the Madison public schools who {{developed}} a program called Protective Behaviors Inc. which provided a way for children to report abuse. The program, based on principles that said {{we all have a}} right to feel safe and that nothing is so awful that you can't <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> someone you trust, was widely adopted in Australia and is credited with revolutionizing child welfare practices there".|$|E

5000|$|I'm writing but I'm {{writing at}} a much slower pace than {{previously}} and I think that if I {{come up with something}} really, really good, I would be perfectly willing to publish it because that still feels like the final act of the creative process, publishing it so people can read it and you can get feedback and people can <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> each other and with you, the writer, but the force of my invention has slowed down a lot over the years and that's as it should be.|$|E
5000|$|Most of the Mattachine founders were communists. As the Red Scare progressed, the {{association}} with communism concerned some members {{as well as}} supporters and Hay, a dedicated member of the CPUSA for 15 years, stepped down as the Society's leader. Others were similarly ousted, and the leadership structure became influenced less by communism, replaced by a moderate ideology similar to that espoused by the liberal reformist civil rights organizations that existed for African Americans. Although Hay claimed [...] "never to have even heard" [...] of the earlier gay liberation struggle in Germany—by the people around Adolf Brand, Magnus Hirschfeld and the Austrian-Hungarian Leontine Sagan—he {{is known to have}} <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> German émigrés in America, including the Austrian-born Rudi Gernreich.|$|R
2500|$|Around {{this time}} he met two composers who were to be {{important}} influences: John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen. His friendship with Cage began in 1949 when Cage was visiting Paris. Cage introduced Boulez to two publishers (Heugel and Amphion) who agreed to take his recent pieces; Boulez helped to arrange a private performance of Cage’s Sonatas and Interludes for Prepared Piano. When Cage returned to New York they began an intense, six-year correspondence {{about the future of}} music. In 1952 Stockhausen arrived in Paris to study with Messiaen. Although Boulez knew no German and Stockhausen no French, the rapport between them was instant: [...] "A friend translated [...] we gesticulated wildly... We <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> music all the time—in a way I've never <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> anyone else." ...|$|R

Stan is equally dismayed, wondering why anyone would care about such a pointless exercise. He <b>talks</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> his parents at dinner, but his parents are not impressed with his apathy and even get into a fight over who should win when Stan explains who the two competitors are. This results in Kyle calling on Sean [...] "Puff Daddy" [...] Combs, who intimidates Stan with a literal Vote or Die campaign. Meanwhile, the campaign continues, with the turd sandwich supporters rallying against the giant douche supporters, using bribes and fear mongering to gain support.|$|R
