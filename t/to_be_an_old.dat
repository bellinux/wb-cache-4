25|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in 1951 by the French mycologist Robert Kühner as Hygrophorus quietus and <b>was</b> later moved <b>to</b> the genus Hygrocybe. The specific epithet refers to Lactarius quietus, an unrelated agaric {{which has the}} same distinctive smell as Hygrocybe quieta. Arnolds (1986) considered Hygrocybe obrussea (Fr.) Wünsche <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> name for the oily waxcap, but the application of this name is disputed. Arnold's interpretation has been accepted by some modern authorities, but not by others.|$|R
25|$|The grey-headed canary-flycatcher was earlier {{considered}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>Old</b> World flycatcher {{in spite}} of its odd crest, colours and nature of vocalization. Molecular phylogeny studies however show that they are quite different and have been placed in the family Stenostiridae that is closely related to the tits and penduline-tits.|$|E
25|$|Christie {{has been}} purposefully vague about Poirot's origins, {{as he is}} thought to be an elderly man even in the early novels. In An Autobiography, she {{admitted}} that she already imagined him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> man in 1920. At the time, however, she had no idea she would write works featuring him for decades to come.|$|E

25|$|The grey-headed canary-flycatcher {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the grey-headed flycatcher (Culicicapa ceylonensis) is a species of small flycatcher-like bird found in tropical Asia. It has a square crest, a grey hood and yellow underparts. They are found mainly in forested habitats where they often join other birds in mixed-species foraging flocks. Pairs are often seen as they forage for insects by making flycatcher-like sallies and calling aloud. Several subspecies are recognized within their wide distribution range. In the past the genus Culicicapa was considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>Old</b> World flycatcher but studies have found them {{to belong to a}} new family designated as the Stenostiridae or fairy flycatchers that include the African genera Stenostira and Elminia.|$|E
25|$|Egil lived <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> age. Arinbjörn {{became a}} close advisor to Harald Eiríksson, to whom Egill {{composed}} a poem.

Egil's son Thorsteinn has many feuds with Steinar, son of Onund Sjoni (Önundr sjóni Anason), over land and cattle grazing. Egil became frail and blind. His one last wish was {{to travel to the}} Althing and toss silver he received from King Æthelstan for the people to fight over. Since no one was able to accompany him, he wandered alone and allegedly concealed his silver treasure near Mosfellsbær, giving birth to the legend of silfur Egils ("Egill's Silver").|$|E
25|$|The {{music video}} for Manson's cover was {{a gateway to}} {{popularity}} for the band, eventually being nominated at the MTV Video Music Awards for Best Rock Video, and contains several clips of Manson and band members in what appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>old,</b> decrepit asylum whilst wearing a variety of strange costumes. The overall video was shot with unusual filters: {{this was one of}} the first videos shot with director Dean Karr's initial vision intact, not based solely on whatever ideas the band had come up with prior. In between these clips are a number of surreal shots of Manson wearing a wedding gown, Manson wandering around an abandoned street in a tutu, birds fluttering around him and leaving dropping on his body, and footage of him riding a pig wearing a cowboy hat whilst covered with mud which Manson rides during the song's climax.|$|E
50|$|Although modern {{populations in}} the Maghreb speak {{languages}} belonging to the Afro-Asiatic family, which {{is associated with the}} Capsian culture, it has been hypothesized that the Capsians' predecessors, the Iberomaurusians, may have spoken a language(s) from a different phylum. This was inferred from the likelihood that the Iberomaurusians existed prior to the advent of the Proto-Afro-Asiatic language, {{as well as from the}} presence of what appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>older,</b> pre-Afro-Asiatic population substratum in parts of the Atlas Mountains. Despite suggestions that this minor element may <b>be</b> related <b>to</b> the Basques of southwestern Europe, there appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> no vestiges of a Basque linguistic influence in the region.|$|R

500|$|... 'The Windy Nook' is {{the title}} of a local {{landmark}} created by sculptor Richard Cole at Whitehill Drive. The sculpture appears at first glance <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> fortification of interlinked walls and pathways sitting atop Windy Nook Pit Hill; local children refer to the artwork simply as 'the Fortress' In fact, the hill is a former slag heap and the 'ruins' are made from 2,500 tons of granite blocks salvaged from the old Scotswood Bridge. It was unveiled in 1986 during Gateshead Sculpture Week.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} {{periodic}} comets discovered in earlier decades or previous centuries are now lost comets. Their orbits were never known {{well enough to}} predict future appearances or the comets have disintegrated. However, occasionally a [...] "new" [...] comet is discovered, and calculation of its orbit shows it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> [...] "lost" [...] comet. An example is Comet 11P/Tempel–Swift–LINEAR, discovered in 1869 but unobservable after 1908 because of perturbations by Jupiter. It was not found again until accidentally rediscovered by LINEAR in 2001. There are at least 18 comets that fit this category.|$|E
25|$|I {{think in}} casual {{conversation}} I {{would have told}} anybody I wanted to direct. At the same time I knew Hollywood <b>was</b> <b>a</b> closed off place... It <b>was</b> much harder <b>to</b> get in. <b>To</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> director <b>was</b> <b>a</b> very positive thing. It meant you had survived, knew your way, could make things and make them meet your economic responsibilities. It was always paramount in studio minds, especially in those days... If I <b>was</b> going <b>to</b> direct I <b>was</b> going <b>to</b> write my way in. No TV, no play, I was simply somebody who said I have a sensibility, I think I can do this, based on nothing other than my scripts basically.|$|R
50|$|Another {{accomplishment}} <b>to</b> Reynolds' credit <b>was</b> his {{signing of}} the trumpeter Rafael Méndez in the late 1940s <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>Olds</b> clinician and endorsor. He worked closely with Mr. Mendez to create the artist's signature model trumpet and long cornet. Reynolds began by measuring the F. Besson Meha trumpet that Mendez was so fond of and then evolving the design (actually, the measuring was reportedly done by his brother, Harper. The lead pipe, for example, {{was very different from}} anything Olds had produced). These were professional trumpets accepted as equal to or better than what was currently on the market. The Mendez trumpet was used and endorsed by the likes of David Jandorf and Clyde McCoy.|$|R

500|$|Gilla Ciaráin's father bore a Gaelic name meaning [...] "iron knee". It {{may or may}} not be a Gaelicisation of Járnkné, an identical-meaning Old Norse name. Gilla Ciaráin's {{own name}} is Gaelic, meaning [...] "the servant of Saint Ciarán". Gaelic names {{beginning}} with the initial name-element Gilla- first appear on record in last half of the tenth century. Such names were shortened to Gilli by Scandinavian settlers in Britain and Ireland. In fact, such a phenomenon may account for the name accorded to Gilli himself. Gilli's name suggests that he was at least partly of Gaelic descent, perhaps either Irish or Hebridean. Although various names are attributed to Gilli's wife in the numerous versions of Njáls saga, the best version of this source gives Hvarflǫð. This name appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>Old</b> Norse form of Forbflaith, a relatively rare Gaelic name.|$|E

Unable to hold a job because of his criminal record, Lang agrees to join Luis' crew and commit a burglary. Lang breaks into a house and cracks its safe, but only finds what he believes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> motorcycle suit, which he takes home. After trying the suit on, Lang accidentally shrinks himself {{to the size of}} an insect. [...] Terrified by the experience, he returns the suit to the house, but is arrested on the way out.

500|$|Bobby {{makes his}} {{debut in the}} first season finale [...] "Devil's Trap", and is {{revealed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>old</b> friend of the Winchester family. Sam and Dean seek his help when their father, John, is kidnapped by demons. From his extensive collection of supernatural-related literature and resources, Bobby shows the brothers {{how to create a}} devil's trap—mystical symbols capable of rendering a demon powerless—and later assists in the exorcism of the demonic Meg Masters. After John's death in the second-season premiere, Bobby allows the brothers to stay at his home to rest up and rebuild the recently-crippled Impala. He continues to assist them when they require additional expertise in their hunts, rescuing a demonically-possessed Sam and dealing with a Trickster. In the second-season finale, Bobby helps Dean to locate a missing Sam, but they both watch in horror as he is fatally stabbed in the back. Bobby begs Dean to bury Sam, and is distraught when he learns that Dean has sold his soul to a demon for Sam's resurrection. When the hunters learn of the demon Azazel's plan to open a Devil's Gate—a gateway to Hell—they rush to stop him. The gateway is temporarily opened, releasing hundreds of other demons into the world, before Bobby and Ellen Harvelle close it again.|$|E

500|$|Secondary {{armament}} <b>was</b> planned <b>to</b> <b>be</b> twelve Bofors [...] guns in dual mounts. It {{is unclear}} {{whether or not these}} <b>were</b> intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>older</b> version of the gun (which had been mounted as the main armament on Dutch destroyers since the 1920s) or an entirely new version, which in reality was developed in the 1940s during the chaos of the Second World War and were unavailable for warships until after the war's end. Detailed specifics such as range or rate of fire are also unknown; had the older gun been used it would in any case have been updated (including the use of dual instead of single half-shield mounts), and the more modern version did not see service until 1950, by which time it incorporated improvements from lessons learned during the war.|$|R
