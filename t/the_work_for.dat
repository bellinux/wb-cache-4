He revised <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> performances, possibly in Hamburg and several revivals in Leipzig, adding for the first Leipzig version four trombones playing colla parte.|$|E

5|$|Bach {{composed}} <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> five soloists: two sopranos, alto, tenor and bass. The soloists {{are listed}} in the table in the order SATB.

5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in five {{movements in}} a symmetrical arrangement of two framing duets surrounding recitatives and a central aria. Bach scored <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> two vocal soloists (soprano (S) and bass (B)), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of originally two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo. John Eliot Gardiner, {{who conducted the}} Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000, notes that the scoring for just two voices and strings was probably intended to ease the workload of musicians who had a busy time during the Christmas season. In the later version, Bach added a trio of two oboes (Ob) and taille (Ot). The duration is given as 17 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in five movements, {{an instrumental}} sinfonia and two choral movements framing two arias, one for soprano (S), {{the other a}} duet for tenor (T) and bass (B). As in Bach's other early cantatas, there are no recitatives. Besides the three solo voices, Bach scored <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two violins (Vl), viola (Va), cello (Vc), bass (violone) and continuo, as {{a copy of the}} score from around 1731 by Johann Ludwig Dietel, a student of Bach, shows. The duration has been given as 10 minutes and the main key as C major.|$|E

5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata {{in seven}} movements, arranged symmetrically around a central chorale. He scored <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> three vocal soloists (alto, tenor, bass), a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of corno da tirarsi (Ct, a slide horn that Bach scored {{for a short}} period), flauto traverso (Ft), two oboes d'amore (Oa), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements, {{an opening}} choral fugue, alternating arias and recitatives and closing chorale. He scored <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> four vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a festive Baroque instrumental ensemble of three trumpets and timpani, two oboes, strings and continuo. The oboes and strings {{play with the}} voices in motet style in the choral sections, while the trumpets add {{the style of a}} new time. The cantata is part of Bach's Picander cycle.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements, {{beginning with}} a biblical quotation for the vox Christi, Jesus speaking.

5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements. In {{the typical}} format of Bach's chorale cantatas, {{the first and}} last movement on the first and stanza of the hymn are set for choir, as a chorale fantasia and a closing chorale.

5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements. The {{text and}} tune of the hymn {{are kept in}} the outer choral movements, a chorale fantasia and a four-part closing chorale, which frame a sequence of alternating recitatives and arias. Bach scored <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> three vocal soloists (soprano (S), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two horns (Co), two oboes da caccia (Oc), two violins (Vl), two obbligato violins (Vs), viola (Va) and basso continuo.

5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata, {{the seventh}} {{work in his}} chorale cantata cycle, in seven movements: two framing choral movements, a recitative and an unusual sequence of four bipartite arias. He scored <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> three vocal soloists, a four-part choir, and a Baroque chamber ensemble of a horn to reinforce the hymn tune in the outer movements, two transverse flutes, two oboes d'amore, strings and continuo.

5|$|Before {{the first}} {{gramophone}} disc recordings of The Rite were issued in 1929, Stravinsky {{had helped to}} produce a pianola version of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> the Aeolian Company. He also created a much more comprehensive arrangement for the French player piano company Pleyel, with whom he signed a contract in 1923 under which many of his early works were reproduced on this medium. The Pleyel version of The Rite of Spring was issued in 1921; the British pianolist Rex Lawson recorded the work in this form in 1990.|$|E
5|$|Elgar's other {{compositions}} {{during the}} war included incidental music for a children's play, The Starlight Express (1915); a ballet, The Sanguine Fan (1917); and The Spirit of England (1915–17, to poems by Laurence Binyon), three choral settings very different in character from the romantic patriotism of his earlier years. His last large-scale composition of the war years was The Fringes of the Fleet, settings of verses by Rudyard Kipling, performed with great popular success around the country, until Kipling for unexplained reasons objected to their performance in theatres. Elgar conducted a recording of <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> the Gramophone Company.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{there is}} no attempt by the artist to soften the subject's {{brutality}} through technical skill. Method and subject are indivisible. Goya's procedure is determined less by the mandates of traditional virtuosity than by his intrinsically morbid theme. The brushwork could not be described as pleasing, and the colors are restricted to earth tones and black, punctuated by bright flashes of white and the red blood of the victims. The quality of the pigment itself foreshadows Goya's later works: a granular solution producing a matte, sandy finish. Few would admire <b>the</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> painterly flourishes, such is its horrific force and its lack of theatricality.|$|E
