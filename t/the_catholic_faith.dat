5|$|As {{required}} by Mexican federal law for property ownership in Coahuila y Tejas, Houston had been baptized into <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>faith</b> in the Adolphus Sterne House in Nacogdoches prior to Texas independence. By 1854, when Houston told Reverend Samson he {{felt compelled to}} make a public profession of faith, perhaps {{on the floor of}} the United States Senate, Margaret and her family had spent 14 years influencing her husband's faith. Ultimately, he decided to make the profession among those who knew him best in Texas.|$|E
5|$|St James's Church {{was built}} on {{a portion of the}} site of the abbey between 1837–40, and marked the return of the Roman Catholic faith to Reading. Reading was also the site of the death of Blessed Dominic Barberi, the Catholic missionary to England in the 19th century who {{received}} John Henry Newman into <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>faith.</b> There are now a total of 8 Roman Catholic parish churches in Reading.|$|E

5|$|Charles, however, decreed on 22 September {{that all}} reformers must {{reconcile}} with <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>faith,</b> {{or he would}} use military force to suppress them. This prompted Melanchthon to call a meeting with Bucer and after lengthy discussions they agreed on nine theses, which they sent to Luther and to Strasbourg. The Strasbourg magistrates forwarded them to Basel and Zürich. Bucer met Luther in Coburg on 26–28 September. Luther still rejected Bucer's theses, but he encouraged him to continue the search for unity. Bucer then traveled to several southern German cities, including Ulm, Isny, Konstanz, Memmingen, and Lindau, and to the Swiss cities of Basel and Zürich. In Zurich on 12 October, he presented the articles to Zwingli, who neither opposed him nor agreed with him.|$|E
5|$|Gia Long tolerated <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>faith</b> of his French {{allies and}} {{permitted}} unimpeded missionary activities {{out of respect}} to his benefactors. The missionary activity was dominated by the Spanish in Tonkin and French in the central and southern regions. At {{the time of his}} death, there were six European bishops in Vietnam. The population of Christians was estimated at 300,000 in Tonkin and 60,000 in Cochinchina. However, he expressed dismay at the Catholic condemnation of the traditional ancestor worship, a basic tenet of Vietnamese culture. Gia Long was also known for his disdain for Buddhism, the religion practiced by the majority of the population. Despite its popularity among ladies of the court, Gia Long often restricted the activities of Buddhists.|$|E
5|$|Gravel then boarded at Assumption Preparatory School in Worcester, Massachusetts, {{where his}} {{performance}} was initially mediocre. Then an English teacher, the Assumptionist Edgar Bourque, gave him personal attention, improving Gravel's language skills and instructing him in public speaking. Gravel's grades improved measurably {{in his final}} year, and he graduated in 1949. He has a sister, Marguerite, who became a Holy Cross nun, but Gravel himself struggled with <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>faith.</b> He studied for one year at Assumption College, a Catholic school in Worcester, then transferred for his sophomore year to American International College in Springfield. Journalist I. F. Stone and philosopher Bertrand Russell strongly influenced Gravel in their willingness to challenge assumptions and oppose social convention and political authority.|$|E

5|$|Hermano Pule {{immediately}} sent {{a letter}} to Archbishop José Seguí in Manila rebuking the acts of the Tayabas friars, and accusing them of beatings and threatening the excommunication of cofradía members. He also challenged the friars' authority to do such acts because the aims of the cofradía were never against <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>faith.</b> On January 29, 1841, Pule {{sent a letter}} to the Bishop of Nueva Cáceres restating that the cofradía was not against canon law. The letter was forwarded to the juez provisor of the bishopric, who then endorsed it to Fr. Antonio Mateo and Fr. Manuel Sancho, who rejected Pule's petition.|$|E
5|$|Roderigo (or Rodrigo) Lopez {{was born}} into a family of Jewish origin in Portugal around 1517. His father, António Lopes, was {{physician}} to King John III of Portugal, and had been baptised into the Roman Catholic Church under coercion in 1497. Lopez was baptised and raised in <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>faith</b> as a converso or New Christian, and educated at the University of Coimbra. He received a BA degree under the name Ruy Lopes on 7 February 1540, then an MA on 4 December 1541; he enrolled for a medical course on 23 December that year. Records do not survive regarding his doctorate, but according to his biographer Edgar Samuel it is probable that he received it in 1544.|$|E
5|$|Canadian {{culture has}} {{historically}} been influenced by Indigenous, French and British cultures and traditions. Most of Canada's territory was inhabited and developed later than other European colonies in the Americas, {{with the result that}} themes and symbols of pioneers, trappers, and traders were important in the early development of the Canadian identity. First Nations played a critical part in the development of European colonies in Canada, particularly for their role in assisting exploration of the continent during the North American fur trade. The British conquest of New France in the mid-1700s brought a large Francophone population under British Imperial rule, creating a need for compromise and accommodation. The new British rulers left alone much of the religious, political, and social culture of the French-speaking habitants, guaranteeing through the Quebec Act of 1774 the right of the Canadiens to practise <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>faith</b> and to use French civil law (now Quebec law).|$|E

50|$|The main {{thesis of}} Duffy's {{book is that}} <b>the</b> Roman <b>Catholic</b> <b>faith</b> was in rude and lively health prior to the English Reformation. Duffy's {{argument}} was written as a counterpoint to the prevailing historical belief that <b>the</b> Roman <b>Catholic</b> <b>faith</b> in England was a decaying force, theologically spent and unable to provide sufficient spiritual sustenance for the population at large.|$|R
5|$|Contradicting the Succession Act, which {{restored}} Mary and Elizabeth to {{the line}} of succession, Edward named Dudley's daughter-in-law Lady Jane Grey, the granddaughter of Henry VIII's younger sister Mary, as his successor. Lady Jane's mother was Frances Brandon, Mary's cousin and goddaughter. Just before Edward VI's death, Mary was summoned to London to visit her dying brother. She was warned, however, that the summons was a pretext on which to capture her and thereby facilitate Lady Jane's accession to the throne. Therefore, instead of heading to London from her residence at Hunsdon, Mary fled into East Anglia, where she owned extensive estates and Dudley had ruthlessly put down Kett's Rebellion. Many adherents to <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>faith,</b> opponents of Dudley's, lived there. On 9 July, from Kenninghall, Norfolk, she wrote to the privy council with orders for her proclamation as Edward's successor.|$|E
5|$|Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas {{arrived in}} the colony of Guatemala in 1537 and {{immediately}} campaigned to replace violent military conquest with peaceful missionary work. Las Casas offered to achieve the conquest of the Land of War through the preaching of <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>faith.</b> It was the Dominicans who promoted {{the use of the}} name Verapaz instead of the Land of War. Because {{of the fact that the}} land had not been possible to conquer by military means, the governor of Guatemala, Alonso de Maldonado, agreed to sign a contract promising he would not establish any new encomiendas in the area should Las Casas' strategy succeed. Las Casas and a group of Dominican friars established themselves in Rabinal, Sacapulas and Cobán, and managed to convert several native chiefs using a strategy of teaching Christian songs to merchant Indian Christians who then ventured into the area.|$|E
5|$|Final Damnation: Finally, {{those who}} persist in {{living in a}} state of mortal sin and do not repent before death subject {{themselves}} to hell, an everlasting separation from God. The Church teaches that no one is condemned to hell without having freely decided to reject God. No one is predestined to hell and no one can determine with absolute certainty who has been condemned to hell. Catholicism teaches that through God's mercy a person can repent at any point before death, be illuminated with the truth of <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>faith,</b> and thus obtain salvation. Some Catholic theologians have speculated that the souls of unbaptised infants and non-Christians without mortal sin but who die in original sin are assigned to limbo, although this is not an official dogma of the Church.|$|E

5|$|Montejo the Younger's cousin met the Canul Maya at Chakan, not {{far from}} T'ho. On 6 January 1542, he founded the second {{permanent}} town council, calling the new colonial town Mérida. On 23 January, Tutul Xiu, the lord of Mani, approached the Spanish encampment at Mérida in peace, bearing sorely needed food supplies. He expressed interest in the Spanish religion and witnessed a Roman Catholic mass celebrated for his benefit. Tutul Xiu was greatly impressed and converted to the new religion; he was baptised as Melchor and stayed with the Spanish at Mérida for two months, receiving instruction in <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>faith.</b> Tutul Xiu was the ruler {{of the most powerful}} province of northern Yucatán and his submission to Spain and conversion to Christianity had repercussions throughout the peninsula, and encouraged the lords of the western provinces of the peninsula to accept Spanish rule. The eastern provinces continued to resist Spanish overtures.|$|E
5|$|Prominent Catholic {{families}} in the Leigh parish did not abandon <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>faith</b> after the English Reformation despite penalties levied on papists. Secret Roman Catholic masses were held in private homes, including Morleys Hall, home of the Tyldesleys. On Easter Sunday 1641, the Catholic priest, Ambrose Barlow was arrested during a service at Morleys Hall at the instigation of the vicar of Leigh. He was taken to Lancaster Castle, tried as a traitor and executed on 10 September 1641. He was canonised by the Roman Catholic Church {{as one of the}} Forty Martyrs of England and Wales. A church and school bear his name. The St Ambrose Barlow parish was formed in 1965 and the church was built in 1981. St Ambrose Barlow parish is in the Leigh Pastoral Area in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Mary {{was born}} on 18 February 1516 at the Palace of Placentia in Greenwich, London. She was {{the only child of}} King Henry VIII by his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, to survive infancy. Her mother had many miscarriages; before Mary's birth, four {{previous}} pregnancies had resulted in a stillborn daughter and three short-lived or stillborn sons, including Henry, Duke of Cornwall. She was baptised into <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>faith</b> at the Church of the Observant Friars in Greenwich three days after her birth. Her godparents included her great-aunt the Countess of Devon, Lord Chancellor Thomas Wolsey, and the Duchess of Norfolk. Henry VIII's cousin once removed, Margaret Pole, Countess of Salisbury, stood sponsor for Mary's confirmation, which was held immediately after the baptism. The following year, Mary became a godmother herself when she was named as one of the sponsors of her cousin Frances Brandon. In 1520, the Countess of Salisbury was appointed Mary's governess. Sir John Hussey, later Lord Hussey, was her chamberlain from 1530, and his wife, Lady Anne, daughter of George Grey, 2nd Earl of Kent, was one of Mary's attendants.|$|E

5|$|The mace: The mace of Fordham is {{traditionally}} carried at Commencement {{by the president}} of the Faculty Senate, who serves as the grand marshal of the main academic procession. The device, four feet in length, bears a regal crown at the summit to denote the sole power of the State of New York to grant academic degrees in its territory. Above the crown is a cross composed of four windmill sails, which signify <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>faith</b> and the Dutch founders of New York City, respectively. The center of the cross displays a heraldic rose, which symbolizes Rose Hill. Immediately beneath the crown is a support, on which the university's seal is emblazoned. The upper node of the mace's staff is decorated with three heraldic roses, the Fordham seal, a ram's head, and a silhouette of the Lincoln Center campus. The titles of the university's constituent colleges are engraved above the node, and the names of the school's presidents from 1841 to 1966 are inscribed below it. The mace was a gift to the university from the Fordham University Alumni Federation.|$|E
5|$|The bill's passage was {{met with}} concern by Catholic authorities, {{including}} Pope John Paul II — who warned of a weakening of family values — and his successor Pope Benedict XVI. Cardinal López Trujillo, president of the Pontifical Council for the Family, said the Church was making an urgent call for freedom of conscience for Catholics and appealing to them to resist the law. He said every profession linked with implementing same-sex marriages should oppose it, {{even if it meant}} losing their jobs. Gay rights supporters argued that while the Catholic Church also formally opposed opposite-sex, non-religious marriage, its opposition was not as vocal; for example, the Church did not object to the marriage of Prince Felipe to Letizia Ortiz, who had divorced from a previous civil marriage. The church was unable to gather enough support to derail the bill, even though 80% of Spaniards identify as members of <b>the</b> <b>Catholic</b> <b>Faith.</b> Sociologists believe {{this may be due to}} the significant increase of liberalism in the realm of individual rights in recent years, where the Church traditionally had most influence, especially on family issues. A poll showed that three quarters of Spaniards believe the church hierarchy is out of touch with social reality. A complementary explanation might be that the Church's influence on Spaniards declined after the death in 1975 of the dictator General Francisco Franco, whose regime was closely linked to the Church.|$|E
