5|$|Some USB devices {{require more}} power than is {{permitted}} by <b>the</b> <b>specifications</b> for a single port.

Such devices can use an external power supply, which is allowed by the standard, or use a dual-input USB cable, one input of which is used for power and data transfer, the other solely for power, which makes the device a non-standard USB device. Some USB ports and external hubs can, in practice, supply more power to USB devices than required by the specification but a standard-compliant device may not depend on this.|$|E

5|$|Commander Matsumura Junzō {{arrived in}} London on 21 July and gave Reed <b>the</b> <b>specifications</b> for the ships. Reed responded on 3 September with an offer, {{excluding}} armament, that exceeded {{the amount allocated}} in the budget.

Ueno had informed the Navy Ministry about the costs before signing, but Kawamura's response to postpone the order for the armored frigate did not arrive until 8 October. The totals for all three contracts came to £433,850 or ¥2,231,563 and did not include the armament. These were ordered from Krupp with a 50 percent down payment of £24,978. The government struggled to provide the necessary money even though the additional expenses had been approved by the Prime Minister's office on 5 June 1876, especially as more money was necessary to fully equip the ships for sea and to provision them for the delivery voyage to Japan.|$|E

40|$|Creating <b>the</b> <b>specification</b> of {{a system}} by {{focusing}} primarily on the detailed properties of the digital controller can lead to complex descriptions that are nearly incoherent. An argument given by Hayes, Jackson, and Jones provides reasons to focus first on the wider {{environment in which the}} system will reside. In their approach are two major ideas: pushing out <b>the</b> <b>specification</b> boundaries, and carefully distinguishing between the requirements of the system and the assumptions about the environment. Pushing out the boundaries of <b>the</b> system <b>specification</b> to include <b>the</b> pragmatic intent of the system being specified allows <b>the</b> <b>specification</b> to be understood relative to the environmental context, rather than remaining a mysterious black box in isolation.
