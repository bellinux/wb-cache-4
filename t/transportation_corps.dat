But the strength of air power {{and the rise of}} the importance of the U.S. Air Force during this era was evident in the organization of the Cadet Corps as Army Air Corps units became Air Force flights (later squadrons). Veterans companies and flights were formed to separate these older veterans from younger cadets. Beginning in 1948 athletes were organized into their own batteries (later companies) to accommodate special team practice schedules.|$|R

50|$|The Hoboken Port of Embarkation, with New York Port of Embarkation also in use by {{the close}} of the war, was {{formally}} established on 27 July 1917 with a port commander having been assigned on 7 July. The Army quickly recognized demands of World War I shipping overseas required unified command of operations of the Water <b>Transportation</b> Branch, Quartermaster <b>Corps</b> and the Army camps and depots through which troops and supplies passed. In early June Major General J. Franklin Bell, commanding the Army's Department of the East on Governors Island was instructed to assume the functions of the commander of such a Port of Embarkation as the port organized. It quickly became clear the United States involvement in the war overseas required a central, separate, more flexible and responsive organization with direct oversight from the War Department in Washington, D.C..

50|$|Conditions were {{difficult}} for the Soviet Corps commanders: loss of communications, constant harassment by the Luftwaffe, lack of transportation, {{and the movement of}} large numbers of refugees and retreating soldiers on the roads made it {{difficult for the}} counter-attacking forces to assemble at their jumping off points. While communication between the Front headquarters and the individual army commands was generally good, communication to the front-line units was seriously flawed, because it was dependent on the civilian telephone and telegraph network. German sappers, air attacks, and Ukrainian nationalist guerrillas had aggressively targeted these systems. Many Soviet front-line commanders were left to their own devices, and this disrupted the effectiveness of Soviet command and control. In one instance, the commander to the 41st Tank Division of the 22nd Mechanized Corps, for want of any new directives, moved his division to the designated assembly point for his corps at Kovel laid out in the pre-war plan, and in so doing, moved his division away from the fighting. Another endemic problem was the lack of transport for the infantry component of the Mechanized Corps. Motorized in name only, many of these divisions had only part of their full <b>transportation</b> establishment. Individual <b>corps</b> commanders had to improvise solutions to bring their full complement of soldiers to their assembly points.|$|R

Much of the job of carrying mountains of supplies to the northern sites fell to military and naval units. More than 3,000 U.S. Army <b>Transportation</b> <b>Corps</b> soldiers were given special training to prepare them for the job of unloading ships in the Arctic.

At some point, after delivery, the Army Air Forces named the repair vessels with FS-217 being named Colonel Armond Peterson.

25|$|When Tuyến's machinations were discovered, he was exiled by Nhu.

Thảo and Mậu's group resumed plotting, intending to move on 24 October, and they recruited a total of 3,000 men. They augmented their forces with an assortment of officers from auxiliary units such as from the Signal Corps, <b>Transportation</b> <b>Corps</b> and some Republic of Vietnam Air Force pilots. Mậu enlisted the help of Khiêm following Tuyến's departure into exile. Mậu gained the cooperation of an assortment of military and civilian dissidents known as the Military and Civilian Front for the Revolution in Vietnam (MCFRV). The MCFRV started to plot independently in August, and was led by a cousin of Mậu.|$|E
25|$|Eisenhower had {{followed}} up an original request on 6 December 1942 after the North African {{experience with a}} requirement for five vessels of fourteen foot draft or less and about 275 feet in length. The U.S. Army Services of Supply assigned the task to the <b>Transportation</b> <b>Corps</b> (TC). After consideration the TC recommended a design that was originally a coastal transport and of which fourteen were being built under Navy contract. The Army wanted the diesel version, the Maritime Commission type N3-M-A1, while Navy wanted {{to give up the}} steam (N3-S-A1) version. At a meeting of the Navy's Munitions Assignments Committee the Army, Navy and Royal Navy all ruled the steam versions as unsuitable. Eventually a clear European requirement for five port repair ships manned by Army Engineers. After considerable dispute during which Navy proposed N3-M-A1 vessels being built for the British, the British objected and the matter was taken to the Combined Chiefs of Staff vessels were obtained and conversions begun.|$|E
25|$|The {{conversion}} of the Josephine Lawrence began 11 September 1943. The U.S. Army <b>Transportation</b> <b>Corps</b> (TC) had {{the lead in the}} {{conversion of}} the ships to Corps of Engineers specifications and then turned over to the Engineers for operations. The converted ship had been promised by TC for 15 January 1944 almost on the schedule required by the European command. Delays, shortages of materials, workers and intense competition from other requirements pushed that date even further into February and then 19 April 1944. On initial test operation the TC found the generators it had specified were insufficient and replacement was required. The Corps of Engineers crews had been trained ashore separately from the ships and thus had to join the ships to learn the practical details. The Junior N. Van Noy, the first of the port repair ships to be ready, sailed from Mobile, Alabama in late April with an Engineers crew sent from Fort Belvoir to Philadelphia for final preparation before deployment overseas. The crew was an organized, designated Corps of Engineers unit designated as an Engineer Port Repair Ship Crew.|$|E
