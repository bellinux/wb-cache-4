Keel refuses to discuss his concerns, even though the frequency he is using {{is supposed to be}} a secure channel, and insists on a face-to-face meeting. Once they arrive at Dytallix B for this secret meeting, the crew discover the Horatio and two other Federation ships already present. Picard beams alone to the surface and is met by Captain Keel and the other captains. Keel reports strange orders from Starfleet headquarters and what he implies are suspicious deaths of Starfleet officers, and expresses concern of a conspiracy. Picard refuses to accept this without proof, but Keel warns him to remain wary. When the captain returns to the Enterprise, he is challenged by Counselor Troi (Marina Sirtis) about keeping his contact with Keel secret. Picard is skeptical about the conspiracy, but says that he trusts his old friend completely. The Enterprise resumes its previous journey. Picard has Commander Data (Brent Spiner) review all orders issued by Starfleet Command in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> While the ship is still on its way to Pacifica, a disturbance is detected in nearby space.

5|$|Police interviewed Farrar at 6:20 a.m, informing him {{immediately}} that {{the bodies of}} Tim and Kelly had been recovered. He told police about the deterioration of his marriage and health over <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>six</b> <b>months.</b> In August 1995, Farrar had fallen ill with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. He initially assumed it was a residual effect of the traveler's diarrhea many people on the Peru trip had contracted while there. Though he recovered from the initial bout of symptoms, he relapsed about a week later, and on August 18 Farrar was hospitalized with severe dehydration and high fever. In the hospital, he developed sepsis. Doctors identified Streptococcus viridans, which had probably leaked through damaged digestive tissue {{as a result of}} Farrar's severe diarrhea, as the source of the sepsis; however, they could not pinpoint the root cause of the gastrointestinal illness itself. Though Farrar's illness was severe and possibly life-threatening, he eventually recovered and was released from the hospital on August 25. That night, however, shortly after eating a dinner that Green had served him, Farrar again suffered vomiting and diarrhea and had to be hospitalized. A third bout of symptoms struck on September 4, days after he was released from the hospital for the second time. Basing their conclusions on the likelihood that his illness was related to the Peru trip, doctors narrowed down the possible causes for Farrar's gastrointestinal issues to a handful, though none fitted his symptoms perfectly: typhoid fever, tropical sprue, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Farrar had noticed that each time he returned home from the hospital, he became ill again almost immediately, and he speculated that it may have been due to the stress of his dissolving marriage or the change from a bland hospital diet to a normal home one. When Farrar's girlfriend, Margaret Hacker, told him she suspected Green was poisoning him, he initially wrote off the idea as ridiculous.|$|E

DESIGN: Randomised cross sectional study to assess association between HIV infection and different measures of self reported condom use. Female sex workers were randomised to one of five different face to face questionnaires on condom use. Three questionnaires used always to never scales to measure use but differed in the reference period for use; a fourth asked about use in the last 10 coital acts; and the fifth was a retrospective log of coital acts in <b>the</b> <b>past</b> two weeks. Use was assessed with new clients, repeat clients, and non-clients. SETTING: Yaounde and Douala, Cameroon. PARTICIPANTS: 2266 female sex workers. MAIN RESULTS: The association between condom use and prevalent HIV infection varied for different measures of condom use. None of the five level measures showed a dose response protective effect of condom use. Measures aimed at reducing recall bias (measures based on <b>the</b> <b>past</b> 10 coital acts or a coital log) showed little or no association with prevalent infection. Measures based on <b>the</b> <b>past</b> <b>month</b> or <b>six</b> <b>months</b> had a stronger association with prevalent infection. Regardless {{of the type of}} measure or reference period, the strongest association between use and infection was for use with partners who were not clients. CONCLUSION: These findings underscore challenges described by others of measuring condom use and interpreting {{the association between}} use and prevalent infection...|$|R
