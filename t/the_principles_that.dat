5|$|In {{her book}} The Shock Doctrine, author and social activist Naomi Klein criticized Friedman's {{economic}} liberalism, identifying it with <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>that</b> guided the economic restructuring {{that followed the}} military coups {{in countries such as}} Chile and Argentina. Based on their assessments {{of the extent to which}} what she describes as neoliberal policies contributed to income disparities and inequality, both Klein and Noam Chomsky have suggested that the primary role of what they describe as neoliberalism was as an ideological cover for capital accumulation by multinational corporations.|$|E
5|$|After his inauguration, Obama {{announced}} {{to a joint}} session of Congress in February 2009 his intent to work with Congress to construct a plan for healthcare reform. By July, a series of bills were approved by committees within the House of Representatives. On the Senate side, from June to September, the Senate Finance Committee held a series of 31 meetings to develop a healthcare reform bill. This group—in particular, Democrats Max Baucus, Jeff Bingaman and Kent Conrad, along with Republicans Mike Enzi, Chuck Grassley and Olympia Snowe—met for more than 60 hours, and <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>that</b> they discussed, in conjunction with the other committees, became the foundation of the Senate healthcare reform bill.|$|E

5|$|Another {{innovation}} {{that was being}} considered was that of armor. Mallory was here somewhat ahead of his time, enthusiastically supporting iron cladding for ships before the fledgling metals industry in the country could supply it in the requisite quantities. No armored vessels were commissioned {{while he was in}} the Senate, but whatever fault there was lay elsewhere. He spoke up for extending appropriations for an armored vessel that was intended for the defense of New York Harbor; named the Stevens Battery after its designer and builder Robert L. Stevens, it had been laid down in 1842 but was still incomplete in 1853, when Mallory gave his argument. His pleading was unsuccessful in that the Senate did not agree to continue funding the project, but in his supporting speech he expressed some of <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>that</b> guided his thinking when he later became the Confederate Secretary of the Navy.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{pressed to}} reform the state's {{criminal}} code, {{which was based on}} the English system and imposed the death penalty for over 200 different crimes. Inspired by Thomas Jefferson's failed attempt to reform Virginia's code, he first asked the Lexington Democratic Society to study ways to make punishments more proportional to crimes in November 1793. By 1796, he was drafting a new code based on <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>that</b> criminals should be rehabilitated, victims should be compensated for their injury, the public should be reimbursed for the cost of prosecuting the criminal, and the punishment's severity should serve as a deterrent for would-be offenders. In January 1798, he introduced his proposed code in the General Assembly. A month later, the Assembly reformed the code, abolishing the death penalty for every crime except first-degree murder.|$|E
5|$|There are {{different}} {{opinions on the}} significance of these principles. Some note that the osteopathic medical philosophy is akin to the tenets of holistic medicine, suggestive of a kind of social movement within the field of medicine, one that promotes a more patient-centered, holistic approach to medicine, and emphasizes the role of the primary care physician within the health care system. Others point out that there is nothing in <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>that</b> would distinguish D.O. from M.D. training in any fundamental way. One study, published in The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association found a majority of M.D. medical school administrators and faculty saw nothing objectionable in the core principles listed above, and some endorse them generally as broad medical principles.|$|E

5|$|Although musically precocious, Tchaikovsky {{was educated}} {{for a career}} as a civil servant. There was scant {{opportunity}} for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five, with whom his professional relationship was mixed. Tchaikovsky's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style—a task that did not prove easy. <b>The</b> <b>principles</b> <b>that</b> governed melody, harmony and other fundamentals of Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music; this seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky's self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of Peter the Great. This resulted in uncertainty among the intelligentsia about the country's national identity—an ambiguity mirrored in Tchaikovsky's career.|$|E

25|$|Protein folding - the unsolved problem : Since {{the seminal}} work of Anfinsen in the early 1960s, the goal to {{completely}} understand the mechanism by which a polypeptide rapidly folds into its stable native conformation remains elusive. Many experimental folding studies have contributed much to our understanding, but <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>that</b> govern protein folding are still based on those discovered {{in the very first}} studies of folding.

25|$|The Core Curriculum in the Liberal Arts of John Carroll is {{informed}} by <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>that</b> issue from the University's mission as a Jesuit liberal arts institution of higher learning.

Moreover, it promotes the integration of faith and reason by imparting a deeper knowledge of {{and respect for the}} students' own cultural and religious traditions {{as well as those of}} others. Finally, it highlights the development of intellect, character, and leadership, and the responsible social actions which flow from them.|$|E
25|$|Important {{developments}} in patent law {{emerged during the}} 18th century through a slow process of judicial interpretation of the law. During the reign of Queen Anne, patent applications were required to supply a complete specification {{of the principles of}} operation of the invention for public access. Legal battles around the 1796 patent taken out by James Watt for his steam engine, established <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>that</b> patents could be issued for improvements of an already existing machine and that ideas or principles without specific practical application could also legally be patented. Influenced by the philosophy of John Locke, the granting of patents began to be viewed as a form of intellectual property right, rather than simply the obtaining of economic privilege.|$|E

He wrote on page 30:In a civilised community, {{although it may be}} composed of self-reliant individuals, there will be some persons who will be unable at some period of their lives to look after themselves, and the question of what is to happen to them may be solved in three ways – they may be neglected, they may be cared for by the organised community as of right, or they may be left to the goodwill of individuals in the community.|$|E
