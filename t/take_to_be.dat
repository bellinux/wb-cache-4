5|$|The {{plans for}} bicycling {{included}} a suspension ramp {{that would allow}} bicyclists to leave the Big Four Bridge without dismounting their bikes. Due {{to the length of}} time any new downtown bridge would <b>take</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> built, and needing an alternative for cyclists and pedestrians to get across the Ohio River when the George Rogers Clark Bridge is closed, which happens yearly during Thunder Over Louisville, bicyclists preferred the idea of converting the Big Four rather than relying on a new downtown bridge or the Clark Bridge. By mid-July 2009, work had begun to convert the bridge to a pedestrian walkway. With the approach ramps, the bridge upon completion of work was to span about 1 mile. In February 2013, pedestrians were allowed to access the completed bridge from the ramp on the Kentucky side with construction still continuing on the Indiana ramp. The Indiana ramp opened on May 20, 2014. Lighting along the bridge is required for safety and had been redesigned to please nearby residents. Originally, the lighting was to be similar to those on the Kentucky side, which has computer-controlled lights that can show various colors. The Indiana construction also had to be cautious of historic properties.|$|E

Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a glowing review and rated it five stars out of five. The two praised Gilligan's script and Patrick's performance, noting that the former [...] "writes the script with a dirtiness that gives it real power" [...] and the latter's acting was [...] "extraordinary". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson wrote that [...] "'John Doe' shows that there's still a fresh <b>take</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> had on The X-Files after all". Meghan Deans of Tor.com applauded the episode and called it [...] "a clear bright spot in a dark and dismal season, both in its script and in its shooting." [...] She felt that the focus on Doggett was effectively done, and the script focused on [...] "strong character arcs", which worked towards its advantage. In the end, she concluded that the episode was [...] "part of the X-Files, more so than would an alien or a mutant" [...] because it focused {{on the idea that}} [...] "pain makes you, more pain makes you better, and living within that pain keeps you alive." [...] M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, praised the central premise, the cinematography and Patrick's performance, calling [...] "John Doe" [...] a [...] "stylishly produced entry".|$|E

2500|$|During the Second World War, {{it became}} clear to Orwell that anti-Soviet {{literature}} was not something which most major publishing houses would touch—including his regular publisher Gollancz. He also submitted the manuscript to Faber and Faber, where the poet T. S. Eliot (who was a director of the firm) rejected it; Eliot wrote back to Orwell praising the book's [...] "good writing" [...] and [...] "fundamental integrity", but declared that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint [...] "which I <b>take</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> generally Trotskyite". Eliot said he found the view [...] "not convincing", and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to run the farm; he posited that someone might argue [...] "what was needed... was not more communism but more public-spirited pigs". Orwell let André Deutsch, who was working for Nicholson & Watson in 1944, read the typescript, and Deutsch was convinced that Nicholson & Watson would want to publish it; however, they did not, and [...] "lectured Orwell on what they perceived to be errors in Animal Farm." [...] In his London Letter on 17 April 1944 for Partisan Review, Orwell wrote that it was [...] "now next door to impossible to get anything overtly anti-Russian printed.

2500|$|In a 2004 {{interview}} (published 9 December), Flew, then 81 years old, {{said that}} he had become a deist. In the article Flew states that he has renounced his long-standing espousal of atheism by endorsing a deism of the sort that Thomas Jefferson advocated ("While reason, mainly in the form of arguments to design, assures us that there is a God, there is no room either for any supernatural revelation of that God or for any transactions between that God and individual human beings"). [...] Flew stated that [...] "the most impressive arguments for God’s existence are those that are supported by recent scientific discoveries" [...] and that [...] "the argument to Intelligent Design is enormously stronger than it was when I first met it". The argument of ID is that evidenced objects and physical concepts are either too simple or too complex to be simply natural, which ever of the two extremes one chooses to be the hallmark of design by an outside intelligence. He also answered in the affirmative to Habermas's question, [...] "So of the major theistic arguments, such as the cosmological, teleological, moral, and ontological, the only really impressive ones that you <b>take</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> decisive are the scientific forms of teleology?". He supported the idea of an Aristotelian God with [...] "the characteristics of power and also intelligence", stating that the evidence for it was stronger than ever before. He rejected the idea of an afterlife, of God as the source of good (he explicitly states that God has created [...] "a lot of" [...] evil), and of the resurrection of Jesus as a historical fact, although he has allowed a short chapter arguing in favor of Joshua's/Jesus' resurrection to be added into his latest book.|$|E
2500|$|It survives in one {{manuscript}} only, British Museum Harley 2252, {{a collection}} of texts compiled in the early 16th century by a London bookseller called John Colyns. [...] Close study {{has shown that the}} section containing the Stanzaic Morte was originally a separate commercially produced booklet. [...] One leaf, dealing with the burial of the Maid of Astolat, is now missing. [...] By 1570 the manuscript had passed into the possession of one Robert Farrers. [...] The manuscript was studied by Humfrey Wanley, keeper of the Harleian Library, who in 1759 catalogued it with the notation, [...] "This I <b>take</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> translated from the French Romance of K. Arthur"; also [...] "I know not who this Poet was, but guess that he lived about the time of K. Henry VII, and that he might have been a Northern man. [...] He useth many Saxon or obsolete Words, and very often delighted himself (as did the Author of 'Piers Plowman') in the Chime of words beginning with the same letter." [...] In 1765 Thomas Percy, mentioning the Stanzaic Morte in his widely influential Reliques of Ancient English Poetry, suggested that it could be older than Wanley thought, since the first line was, he believed, quoted in the Middle English romance of Beves of Hamtoun. [...] Thomas Warton's History of English Poetry (1774–81) includes a short extract from the Morte, and dates it to the early 14th century. [...] In Observations on the Three First Volumes of The History of English Poetry (1782), and again in Ancient Engleish Metrical Romanceës (1802), the antiquary Joseph Ritson ridiculed Warton's and Percy's views of the poem's date, and asserted that Wanley was correct in assigning it to the reign of Henry VII. [...] He noticed the similarities with Malory's Morte d'Arthur, but believed that the poem was based on Malory rather than vice versa. [...] A lengthy but rather facetious synopsis of the Morte, with quotations, figured in the Specimens of Early English Metrical Romances (1805) by George Ellis. [...] Ritson's late date for the poem was there rejected. [...] A complete edition of the Morte by Thomas Ponton was published by the Roxburghe Club in 1819.|$|E
