40|$|MBA Professional ReportThe {{purpose of}} this MBA {{professional}} report is to introduce the Truth Revealing Incentive Mechanism (TRIM) {{as a tool to}} help the government obtain more accurate cost estimates and control program costs. <b>The</b> <b>TRIM</b> is an economic mechanism based on principal-agent relationships that uses incentives to align contractors' interests with those of <b>the</b> Government. <b>The</b> <b>TRIM</b> combats principal-agent problems by extracting a contractor's true estimated costs. <b>The</b> <b>TRIM</b> is structured so that revealing the true estimated cost offers the contractor the highest potential fee. This report describes the principal-agent theory, identifies principal-agent problems in the current DoD contracting environment, discusses how <b>the</b> <b>TRIM</b> addresses these problems more effectively than traditional cost-reimbursement contracts, and explains how and where <b>the</b> <b>TRIM</b> can be applied. This report also includes an electronic version of <b>the</b> <b>TRIM</b> in Microsoft Excel format, as well as a practitioner's guide to help contracting officers use <b>the</b> <b>TRIM...</b>|$|R

500|$|Evra {{earned his}} first call-up {{to the senior}} {{national}} team in May 2004 after coach Jacques Santini named him to the 31-man preliminary squad to participate in UEFA Euro 2004. Following <b>the</b> <b>trimming</b> of the squad to 23 players, Evra was not included and subsequently missed out on the competition. Following the European Championship, with former under-21 coach Domenech now coaching the team, Evra was called up to the senior team for its friendly against Bosnia and Herzegovina on 18 August 2004. The defender admitted that he was [...] "very proud" [...] to have been called up to the team. Evra made his senior international debut in the match against Bosnia and Herzegovina. He started on the left wing before being substituted out in the 75th minute for Robert Pirès. The match ended in a 1–1 draw. Due to an injury to starter Éric Abidal, Evra supplanted him and appeared as the starting left back in France's first two 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification matches. After being called-up for the team's March 2005 friendly against Switzerland, Evra was forced {{to withdraw from the}} team due to injury. As a result, William Gallas was inserted in the role as a makeshift left back. Following Abidal's return from injury and, due to Domenech preferring Mikaël Silvestre as the incumbent's back-up, Evra went without a call-up for almost two years and, consequently, missed the 2006 World Cup. In October 2007, the defender explained to L'Équipe that the World Cup snub [...] "gave me my determination".|$|E
500|$|Cream {{recorded}} the song on November 28, 1966, for broadcast on the BBC Guitar Club radio program. [...] At {{less than two}} minutes in length, Clapton only sings the first and last sections, with his guitar solo replacing the middle [...] "Traveling Riverside Blues" [...] verse. [...] It appeared on bootleg albums before finally being released in 2003 on BBC Sessions. [...] On March 10, 1968, Cream recorded it again during a concert at the Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco. [...] According to two music writers, the recording was edited from a much longer performance that was typical for the trio – in the notes for Clapton's Crossroads box set, Anthony DeCurtis credits <b>the</b> <b>trimming</b> to engineer Tom Dowd, while critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine attributes the editing to producer Felix Pappalardi, who [...] "cut together the best bits of a winding improvisation to a tight four minutes", to allow the song's drive more continuity. However, Clapton biographer Schumacher does not mentioning editing and adds [...] "Given the passion of the solo performances on 'Crossroads,' it seems almost miraculous that Cream is able to return to the song itself." [...] "Crossroads" [...] became the opening number on the live half of Cream's Wheels of Fire double album, released in August 1968 by Polydor Records in the UK and Atco Records in the US. [...] After the group's breakup, Atco issued the song as a single in January 1969, which reached number 28 on the US Billboard Hot 100 pop chart and 17 on Cashbox. Both the original album and single credit the songwriter as Robert Johnson or R. Johnson, although Clapton and Cream extensively reworked the song.|$|E

50|$|When the {{percentage}} of points to discard does not yield a whole number, <b>the</b> <b>trimmed</b> mean may be defined by interpolation, generally linear interpolation, between the nearest whole numbers. For example, {{if you need to}} calculate <b>the</b> 15% <b>trimmed</b> mean of a sample containing 10 entries, strictly this would mean discarding 1 point from each end (equivalent to <b>the</b> 10% <b>trimmed</b> mean). If interpolating, one would instead compute <b>the</b> 10% <b>trimmed</b> mean (discarding 1 point from each end) and <b>the</b> 20% <b>trimmed</b> mean (discarding 2 points from each end), and then interpolating, in this case averaging these two values. Similarly, if interpolating <b>the</b> 12% <b>trimmed</b> mean, one would take the weighted average: weight <b>the</b> 10% <b>trimmed</b> mean by 0.8 and <b>the</b> 20% <b>trimmed</b> mean by 0.2.|$|R

2500|$|When the {{buoyancy}} compensator of a scuba diver is inflated at {{the surface}} to provide positive buoyancy, {{the positions of the}} centre of buoyancy and centre of gravity of the diver are generally different. The vertical and horizontal separation of these centroids will determine the static trim of the diver {{at the surface}}. The diver can usually overcome <b>the</b> <b>trimming</b> moment of buoyancy, but this requires constant directed effort, albeit usually not a great deal of effort. This allows a conscious [...] diver to adjust trim to suit the circumstances such as the choice between swimming face down or face up, or remaining vertical for best field of view or visibility. The position of the diver's centre of gravity is determined by the distribution of weight, and buoyancy is determined by the equipment in use, particularly the buoyancy compensator, which can significantly influence centre of buoyancy shifts as it is inflated and deflated. Stable trim implies that the centre of buoyancy is directly above the centre of gravity. Any horizontal offset will generate a moment which will rotate the diver until the equilibrium condition is restored.|$|E

2500|$|The colours {{allocated}} to the various fields of learning have been largely standardized in the United States by the Intercollegiate Bureau of Academic Costume, and accepted by the American Council on Education in its Academic Costume Code.

40|$|Multistage {{severe service}} control valves are {{extensively}} used in various energy systems, {{such as oil}} & gas, nuclear etc. The primary purpose of such valves is to control the amount of fluid flow passing through them under extreme pressure changes. As opposed to the conventional valves (butterfly, gate etc.), control valves are often installed in energy systems with geometrically complex trims, comprising of various geometrical features, formed by a complex arrangement of cylindrical arrays. The pressure within <b>the</b> <b>trim</b> varies in controlled steps and hence, cavitation resistance can be embedded in <b>the</b> <b>trim</b> through improved design process for <b>the</b> <b>trim</b> for severe service applications in energy systems. The flow characteristics within a control valve are quite complex, owing to complex geometrical features inherent in such designs, which makes it extremely difficult to isolate and quantify contribution of these features on the flow characteristics. One {{of the most important}} design parameters of such <b>trims</b> is <b>the</b> flow coefficient (also known as flow capacity) of <b>the</b> <b>trim</b> which depends on the geometrical features of <b>the</b> <b>trim.</b> <b>The</b> design of valves for particular performance envelop within the energy systems depends on effects of complex trim geometrical features on performance characteristics; hence, the focus of recent research is on quantifying the hydrodynamic behaviour of severe service control valves, including <b>the</b> <b>trims.</b> This includes <b>the</b> estimation of the local flow capacity contributions of the geometrical features of <b>the</b> <b>trim</b> through detailed numerical investigations. In this work, a tool has been developed {{that can be used to}} predict the local contribution of geometrical features on the flow coefficient of <b>the</b> <b>trim.</b> It is expected that this work will result in better performance of the energy systems where these valves are used...|$|R
40|$|Members of <b>the</b> {{tripartite}} motif (<b>TRIM)</b> protein family of RING E 3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligases promote innate immune {{responses by}} catalyzing synthesis of polyubiquitin chains linked through lysine 63 (K 63).

Structural, biochemical, and functional characterization of <b>the</b> <b>TRIM</b> 5 α:Ubc 13 -Ub interactions reveals that activation of the Ubc 13 -Ub conjugate requires dimerization of <b>the</b> <b>TRIM</b> 5 α RING domain. Our data explain how higher-order oligomerization of TRIM 5 α, which is promoted by the interaction with the retroviral capsid, enhances the E 3  Ub ligase activity of TRIM 5 α and contributes to its antiretroviral function. This E 3 mechanism, in which RING dimerization is transient and depends on the interaction of <b>the</b> <b>TRIM</b> protein with <b>the</b> ligand, {{is likely to be}} conserved in many members of <b>the</b> <b>TRIM</b> family and may have evolved to facilitate recognition of repetitive epitope patterns associated with infection...|$|R
