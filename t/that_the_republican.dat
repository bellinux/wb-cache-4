5|$|A central {{pledge of}} President Bill Clinton's {{campaign}} was {{to reform the}} welfare system, adding changes such as work requirements for recipients. However, by 1994, the Clinton Administration appeared to be more concerned with pursuing a universal health care program. Gingrich accused Clinton of stalling on welfare, and proclaimed that Congress could pass a welfare reform bill {{in as little as}} 90 days. He insisted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party would continue to apply political pressure to the President to approve their welfare legislation.|$|E
5|$|By Election Day, November 2, 1920, few had {{any doubts}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> ticket would win. Harding {{received}} 60.2percent {{of the popular}} vote, the highest percentage since {{the evolution of the}} two-party system, and 404 electoral votes. Cox received 34percent of the national vote and 127 electoral votes. Campaigning from a federal prison where he was serving a sentence for opposing the war, Socialist Eugene V. Debs received 3percent of the national vote. The Republicans greatly increased their majority in each house of Congress.|$|E
5|$|During {{a congressional}} recess in July 1878, Hayes finally sacked Arthur and Cornell (Sharpe's term had expired) and {{appointed}} replacements. When Congress reconvened, Sherman pressured his former Senate colleagues {{to confirm the}} President's replacement nominees, which they did after considerable debate. Jay and other reformers criticized Sherman the next year when he traveled to New York to speak on Cornell's behalf in his campaign for governor of New York. Sherman replied {{that it was important}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> party win the election there, despite their intra-party differences. His friendliness may also have related, as Arthur's biographer Thomas C. Reeves suggests, to a desire to keep Conkling's New York machine friendly to him as the 1880 presidential election approached.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> only solution, <b>Republicans</b> insisted, {{was a new}} {{commitment}} to free labor, and a deliberate effort to stop any more territorial expansion of slavery. Northern Democrats answered {{that it was all}} an exaggeration and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> were paranoid. Their Southern colleagues spoke of secession, arguing <b>that</b> <b>the</b> John Brown raid of 1859 proved <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> were ready to attack their region and destroy their way of life.|$|R

5|$|For {{the first}} two weeks of the shutdown, there was little {{progress}} and neither the governor nor the Republican leaders made proposals accepted by the other side. On July 4, Republican lawmakers affirmed their commitment to not agree to a budget of over $34 billion. Documents leaked after June 30 stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> leadership included anti-abortion provisions, a voter ID requirement, and a ban on stem cell research during the budget negotiations. Both the Republican legislative leaders and Dayton (along with DFL legislative leaders) toured Minnesota to make their case to Minnesotans. The government shutdown ended after Governor Dayton announced on July 14 that he would accept the last Republican offer before the shutdown, albeit with certain conditions.|$|E

25|$|The recount {{was halted}} on January 23, 2008. The Deputy Secretary of State, David Scanlan, {{estimated}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> recount cost $57,600 and the Democratic recount, with more votes cast, cost $67,600.|$|E

25|$|When President Dwight D.

25|$|In October 2009, it was {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party had approached Sullenberger about running against Democratic U.S. Representative Jerry McNerney of California's 11th congressional district in the 2010 elections. Sullenberger's publicist said that Sullenberger {{had no desire to}} run for any public office.|$|E

25|$|Black {{leaders in}} the North had insisted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party National {{platform}} for the presidential election of 1920 include support for anti-lynching legislation.

25|$|In December 1996, Coleman {{announced}} he was leaving the DFL party to join the Republican Party.

25|$|Despite {{the earlier}} {{opposition}} from conservatives, in April 2008, {{there were signs}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party base was coalescing behind McCain's candidacy. A CBS News/New York Times poll showed that McCain was viewed favorably by 78 percent of conservatives, and unfavorably by only 18 percent. This was the same percentage who had an unfavorable opinion of George W. Bush {{at the same time}} in 2000.|$|E
5000|$|In 2006, Trueschler {{decided to}} retire rather than run for re{{election}}. [...] Democrat Stephen W. Lafferty {{was elected to}} replace him, one of several seats <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> lost in <b>the</b> 2006 election in the House of Delegates.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> also {{picked up}} another 4 open seats in Iowa, Montana, South Dakota, and West Virginia.

50|$|In {{an ironic}} twist, {{the outcome of}} the litigious {{election}} was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> won <b>the</b> presidential race, but the Democrats carried the gubernatorial contest by 195 votes, which cost Dennis most, if not all, of his political power.|$|R
25|$|Sullivan has {{declared}} support for Arnold Schwarzenegger and other like-minded Republicans. He argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party, {{and much of}} the conservative movement in the United States, has largely abandoned its earlier scepticism and moderation in favour of a more fundamentalist certainty, both in religious and political terms. He has said this is the primary source of his alienation from the modern Republican Party.|$|E
25|$|It {{would be}} no exaggeration to say <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party {{has been in a}} state of panic since the defeat of Mitt Romney, not least because the {{election}} highlighted American demographic shifts and, relatedly, the party's failure to appeal to Hispanics, Asians, single women and young voters. Hence the Republican leadership's new willingness to pursue immigration reform, even if it angers the conservative base.|$|E
25|$|In the House, Coburn {{earned a}} {{reputation}} as a political maverick due to his frequent battles with House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Most of these stand-offs stemmed from his belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> caucus was moving toward the political center and away from the more conservative Contract With America policy proposals that had brought the Republicans into power in Congress in 1994 {{for the first time in}} 40 years.|$|E
5000|$|Vice President Bush was {{nominated}} without opposition during the roll call vote, but with rumblings {{of opposition to}} the Quayle nomination, {{it was decided to}} have it ratified by voice vote, something <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> had never done before.|$|R

50|$|In {{the morning}} of March 28, before the 60th ballot, Chauncey M.

25|$|On November 8, 2011, Republicans {{took control}} of the State Senate with Lt. Gov.

25|$|Powell {{has been}} very vocal {{on the state of}} the Republican party.

He also remarked on Republican presidential contender Donald Trump's statements regarding immigrants, noting that there were many immigrants working in Trump hotels.|$|E
25|$|After several recounts were {{inconclusive}} and {{the laws}} governing recounts were unclear, Harris halted the recounting process. She certified <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> candidate, Texas Governor George W.

This victory in Florida allowed Bush to win the election. Her ruling was upheld in the state circuit court, but was subsequently overturned on appeal by the Florida Supreme Court.|$|E
5000|$|William L. Harris, one Mississippian secession commissioner, told {{a meeting}} of the Georgian general {{assembly}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> wanted to implement [...] "equality between the white and negro races" [...] and thus secession was necessary for the slave states to resist their efforts.|$|R

2500|$|Before the caucus, {{comments}} made by Obama concerning former Republican president Ronald Reagan attracted rebuke from rivals and dissection from all sections of the media. Obama had stated in an interview that: [...] "Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America {{in a way that}} Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not." [...] According to the New York Times, Hillary Clinton [...] "ridiculed <b>the</b> idea <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> were <b>the</b> party of ideas, suggesting Mr. Obama had said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> had 'better' ideas".
