5|$|Riefenstahl {{produced}} and directed {{her own work}} called Das Blaue Licht ("The Blue Light") in 1932, co-written by Carl Mayer and Béla Balázs. This film won the Silver Medal at the Venice Film Festival, but was not universally well-received, for which Riefenstahl blamed the critics, {{many of whom were}} Jewish. Upon its 1938 re-release, the names of Balázs and Sokal, both Jewish, were removed from the credits; some reports claim this was at Riefenstahl's behest. In the film, Riefenstahl played an innocent peasant girl who is hated by the villagers because they <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> diabolic and cast out. She is protected by a glowing mountain grotto. According to herself, Riefenstahl received invitations to travel to Hollywood to create films, but she refused them in favour of remaining in Germany with a boyfriend. The film attracted the attention of Hitler, who believed she epitomized the perfect German female. He saw talent in Riefenstahl and arranged a meeting.|$|E
5|$|Without speech, the Scoobies {{resort to}} {{gestures}} or writing. Humorous misperceptions arise from this gesturing when, for example, Buffy mimes driving in a stake—as though killing a vampire—too {{close to her}} pelvis, causing the Scoobies to <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> suggesting masturbating to rid the town of The Gentlemen. In the belfry, while Buffy and Riley are fighting The Gentlemen, Buffy indicates that Riley should smash the box from her dream. He misunderstands and breaks a jar beside it, looks up and grins, awaiting Buffy's approval. The clumsiness of the characters' gesturing is in direct contrast to the grace of The Gentlemen, who communicate easily through gestures and other visual signals. Their communication is simple and direct; nods, head tilts, and hand movements, achieve exactly what they want it to. The Scoobies, however, are confused and accomplish {{the opposite of what}} they intend. When they are rendered silent they are also rendered useless, unsure of how to fight The Gentlemen. According to two Buffy essayists, part of the horror stemming from the arrival of The Gentlemen is the silence that makes the people of Sunnydale helpless, easy victims.|$|E

At the dance, Teddy and Silver share a kiss. Silver storms off but later admits to Naomi that she felt something when they kissed. Just as Silver is about to tell Teddy that she wants to give it a shot, she sees him hugging a girl, not knowing it is Teddy's sister. Dixon reveals to Silver that he still has feelings for her, after which he lies and says that he did not know who the girl was that Teddy was embracing. Naomi, Navid, Dixon, and Silver reveal to Annie the truth about Jasper with the help of Adrianna. Annie confronts Jasper about his lies and he reveals to her that he knows she was the one who killed his uncle.|$|E
500|$|Despite such criticism, the {{reception}} that met She was overwhelmingly positive and echoed the sentiments expressed by anthropologist and literary critic Andrew Lang before the story's first publication: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>She</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the}} most astonishing romances I ever read.

Gurnemanz tells them Kundry has often helped the Grail Knights {{but that she}} comes and goes unpredictably. When he asks directly why she does not stay to help, she answers, [...] "I never help! (""). The squires <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> a witch and sneer that if she does so much, why will she not find the Holy Spear for them? Gurnemanz reveals that this deed is destined for someone else. He says Amfortas was given guardianship of the Spear, but lost it as he was seduced by an irresistibly attractive woman in Klingsor's domain. Klingsor grabbed the Spear and stabbed Amfortas.

500|$|The episode {{begins with}} the Simpson family visiting Grampa Simpson after his {{retirement}} home mistakenly reports his death. A beautiful new woman named Zelda moves into his retirement home {{in place of the}} actual deceased resident. Grampa is determined to win her love over Zack, another resident who owns and drives a minivan. After renewing his driver's license, Grampa convinces Homer to let him borrow the car to romance her.

500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the consultation between Kerr, Charteris and Charles was maintained to ensure that the Queen and the British Parliament were not part of the discussion. Assistant Private Secretary to the Queen in 1975, Sir William Heseltine, who along with Charteris informed her of the dismissal, has maintained that it came as a surprise to all three of them; that he considered Kerr's actions imprudent; and that he believed that this opinion was shared by Charteris. A memorandum by Sir Paul Hasluck of his conversation with Charteris supports this suggestion, and that disillusionment with Kerr's character led the Palace to apply pressure for his resignation. The Queen's opinion is unknown, but Heseltine has stated: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> an old and wily bird about her own views ... to the extent that I could divine what she felt, I think she felt the same ... I’m reasonably confident myself that she thought it could have been handled better.” ...|$|E

Paul realises that Diana knows the truth and offers to join forces with her to bring down Rosemary instead. Diana becomes friends with Paul's wife, Rebecca (Jane Hall), and she realises that she can [...] "shatter Paul's marriage" [...] as Rebecca does not suspect anything is wrong. Badler said [...] "There is all this history between Paul and Diana and now {{they seem to be}} dancing around each other. There's every chance they could catch fire again.

500|$|Francis also {{expressed}} her disappointment in her former daytime role on General Hospital. She {{said that she}} has found that her [...] "fan base will follow" [...] her whatever she does.

I welcome {{the opportunity to do}} something new to continue to entertain my audience. What I loved about Laura—and what people loved about Laura—is that she is a terrific memory, but it’s just not there anymore." [...] Soap Opera Digest later confirmed the character's name to be Genevieve Atkinson. Co-head writer of The Young and the Restless, Scott Hamner, stated that the role {{was going to be a}} [...] "very, very different character than we've seen Genie Francis portray".

500|$|One of {{the most}} notable story lines for Martha was her secret life as a pole dancer and {{subsequent}} road into alcoholism.

The story line began playing out from the 2006 [...] "cliffhanger" [...] episode, when Ash reveals that he is married with children and leading a double life. Gordon branded Martha as ignorant to the situation she has got herself into: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> so naive, she wants to believe that she's found a great guy and she keeps giving him second chances. She wants to make it work." [...] Martha fails to cope with the situation, as Gordon describes: [...] "It's this whole emotional roller-coaster that, if you don't deal with your life, can be terrible." [...] Their relationship falls apart after Martha aborts Ash's child, causing Martha to begin her transition into a party girl.

500|$|At {{the time}} of the 2005 general election, Labour chiefs feared that an episode of EastEnders in which Dot learned to drive could {{distract}} viewers from voting. In the same year, Dot was criticised as revealing an anti-religious bias {{on the part of the}} BBC. Dr Indarjit Singh, editor of the Sikh Messenger and patron of the World Congress of Faiths suggested that Dot's endless quoting from the Bible served to ridicule religion. The character has been cited as an example of anti-Christian bias in the media. The BBC were accused of portraying Christians as old-fashioned in 2008 after an episode aired in which Dot asked a gay, male couple to stop kissing. The BBC responded, [...] "EastEnders aims to reflect real life, and this means including and telling stories about characters from many different backgrounds, faiths, religions and sexualities." [...] In a report to the BBC’s Board of Governors in July 2004 regarding religion, Dot was used as an example of how religion can be portrayed as stereotypical [...] "out-of-date and occasionally offensive" [...] in drama and entertainment output, that Christian figures are highlighted because of their faith [...] "rather than seen as normal people who also have a religious belief". It was suggested that some Christians think Dot [...] "is made deliberately unappealing to audiences by her eccentric traits and hypocritical behaviour". However, it was also suggested that others <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> convincing.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to gameplay, {{she was also}} one of the first characters to have her backstory fleshed out. In an interview with PC Gamer, the game's creative director, Chris Metzen stated, [...] "Tracer [...] one of the first characters we really got to know. And while she wasn't particularly created to be a starring role, if you will, we felt on the team, the more we got to know her and play her, she was kind of like this Spider-Man type character for us. She's so rad, and it feels good to leverage her in the front of story ideas." [...] Tracer has also been noted for being a peppy character, with Hardcore Gamers Kevin Dunsmore describing her as a [...] "spunky Brit [...] full of little quips as she zips around the battlefield". Kaplan described [...] "Tracer [...] cute and playful, and she's the type of person who does everything with a wink and a smile." [...] In an interview with PCGamesN, game designer Michael Chu stated that [...] "the thing about Tracer is that she has a personality which is out of the norm for most people. She is incredibly optimistic, she is incredibly bubbly - it's part of her hero persona. We love her, I <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> very much one of the main characters of the game [...] really carry the torch of what the game is all about: heroism." [...] To reflect her English origin, Tracer is voiced by English actress Cara Theobold.|$|E
500|$|Angelina's {{dream is}} to be a {{successful}} singer on the music charts. DeGarmo noted that her father, Angelo, [...] "who thinks his spoiled-brat daughter sings like a choir of angels" [...] puts pressure on Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), a young and upcoming music producer, to show Angelina the ropes of the music industry and make her a success. DeGarmo said: [...] "Unfortunately, she’s not as good a singer as she and her father <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> [...] Angelina is a bit oblivious to reality, but will slowly come to grips with it over the next few weeks. As a singer myself, it’s liberating to get on the set and throw all ego – and notes – aside and surprise people." [...] DeGarmo commented: [...] "It's fantastically hilarious because it puts the poor kid in a horrible predicament!" [...] She said that Angelina was into Top 40 music at first, but: [...] "the writers have her singing the American standards — Judy Garland, that sort of thing. We want the audience to be really familiar with the songs, so they can tell how badly Angie is butchering them." [...] Michael Logan of TV Guide noted that you needed [...] "skill to play a bad singer", to which DeGarmo said that it's harder than people realize: [...] "but it's really liberating {{to get out there and}} be bad. You just throw your ego to the wind and sing for Jesus." [...] Devon would eventually go on to make Angelina a good singer. Angelina briefly fired Devon for adding rap verses to a song of hers which was soaring on the charts, but he retained the rights of the track.|$|E
