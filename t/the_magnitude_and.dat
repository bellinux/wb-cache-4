Smith sent Strong to personally warn Bradley, who was preparing an offensive of his own. <b>The</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>and</b> ferocity of the German Ardennes Offensive came as a shock, and Smith had to defend Strong against criticism for failing to sound the alarm. He felt Bradley had been given ample warning.|$|E
5|$|Almost all reviewers commented {{upon the}} {{timeliness}} of the book's release as <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>and</b> {{causes of the}} most recent financial crisis were becoming apparent. Some reviewers also commented upon the timeliness of her previous books, like her novel in which society is devastated by a genetically engineered virus, Oryx and Crake, which coincided with the SARS outbreak. Playing off this theme Canadian magazine The Walrus, at a fund-raiser gala for its charitable foundation, auctioned a crystal decanter with five predictions written by Atwood sealed inside. Journalist Rebecca Eckler was the winning bidder and wrote about the predictions, which include the diminished use of fabric softener and the rise in use of industrial hemp, in an article for Maclean's magazine.|$|E
5|$|Analyses {{conducted}} contemporarily and independently by Bailey, Batygin and Brown; by Gomes, Deienno and Morbidelli; {{and later}} by Lai suggest that Planet Nine could be responsible for inducing the spin–orbit misalignment of the Solar System. The Sun's axis of rotation is tilted approximately six degrees from the orbital plane of the giant planets. The exact reason for this discrepancy {{remains an open question}} in astronomy. The analysis used computer simulations to show that both <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>and</b> direction of tilt {{can be explained by the}} gravitational torques exerted by Planet Nine on the other planets over the lifetime of the Solar System. These observations are consistent with the Planet Nine hypothesis, but do not prove that Planet Nine exists, as there could be some other reason, or more than one reason, for the spin–orbit misalignment of the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>magnitude</b> <b>and</b> {{ferocity of}} the German Ardennes Offensive {{came as a}} shock and Strong was criticised for failing to predict it. However Smith defended Strong against {{criticism}} for failing to sound the alarm, feeling that Strong have given ample warning, which had been discounted or disregarded by himself and others. By 19 December, Strong had become concerned that the Germans were going to split Bradley's armies, and he and Whiteley – who had already received Monty's opinion on the matter – went to Smith, recommending that the armies north of the Ardennes be transferred from Bradley to Montgomery's command. Smith realised the military and political implications of this, and knew that such a recommendation had to come from an American officer. On 20 December, Smith spoke to Eisenhower, who deferred judgement until the morning staff meeting. Eisenhower then phoned Bradley and Montgomery and ordered it. The decision was greatly resented by many Americans, particularly at 12th Army Group.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>magnitude</b> squared {{coherence}} <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{time lag}} are determined for different pixel locations for certain frequencies. <b>The</b> <b>magnitude</b> squared coherence <b>and</b> <b>the</b> time lag are determined between pixels along a line, {{relative to a}} single pixel location. In this process, <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> squared coherence <b>and</b> time lag are calculated and smoothed, but are not ensemble-averaged. As such, <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> squared coherence <b>and</b> time lag results at a frequency of 40 [*]Hz are considered with respect to spatial position. With this approach, <b>the</b> <b>magnitude</b> squared coherence <b>and</b> time lag at this frequency are determined for a single location associated with the normal shock wave, relative to other locations near and adjacent to the shock wave.|$|R
