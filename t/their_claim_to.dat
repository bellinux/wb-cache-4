Services in the reconsecrated Great Church had begun on Christmas Day, 1213, most likely before it was entirely completed.

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{recorded history}} of the Glacier Bay area starts with the 1741 Russian expedition of Vitus Bering and Aleksei Chirikov. La Perouse (after whom one of the glaciers in the bay was named subsequently) established contact with the local inhabitants, the Tlingits at Lutya Bay, in 1786. This {{was followed by the}} Russians staking <b>their</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> the region.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the central}} and local governments kept an {{enormous}} number of records about land property in order to assess taxes, it became common practice in the Tang for literate and affluent people to create their own private documents and signed contracts. These had their own signature and that of a witness and scribe in order to prove in court (if necessary) that <b>their</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> property was legitimate. The prototype of this actually existed since the ancient Han dynasty, while contractual language became even more common and embedded into Chinese literary culture in later dynasties.|$|E

5|$|In the Third Intermediate Period and the {{following}} Late Period (664–323 BC), the weakened Egyptian state fell {{to a series of}} outside powers, experiencing only occasional periods of independence. Many of these foreign rulers funded and expanded temples to strengthen <b>their</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> the kingship of Egypt. One such group, the Kushite pharaohs of the eighth and seventh centuriesBC, adopted Egyptian-style temple architecture for use in their native land of Nubia, beginning a long tradition of sophisticated Nubian temple building. Amid this turmoil, the fortunes of various temples and clergies shifted and the independence of Amun's priesthood was broken, but the power of the priesthood in general remained.|$|E
5|$|Tamar {{was born}} in circa 1160 to George III, King of Georgia, and his consort Burdukhan, a {{daughter}} of the king of Alania. While {{it is possible that}} Tamar had a younger sister, Rusudan, she is only mentioned once in all contemporary accounts of Tamar's reign. The name Tamar is of Hebrew origin and, like other biblical names, was favored by the Georgian Bagrationi dynasty because of <b>their</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> be descended from David, the second king of Israel.|$|E
5|$|The Stuarts {{used their}} {{connection}} with Fleance and {{his marriage to}} the Welsh princess to claim a genealogical link with the legendary King Arthur. This, they hoped, would strengthen the legitimacy of <b>their</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> the throne. In 1722, however, Richard Hay, a Scottish historian, presented strong evidence {{that not only was}} James not a descendant of Fleance, but also that neither Fleance nor Banquo ever even existed. Most modern scholars now agree that Fleance is not a real historical figure.|$|E

5|$|The {{security}} of the southern bands depended on French trade in arms, and this was disrupted by the French and Indian War (1754–63). In 1763, France surrendered the Louisiana Territory {{under the terms of}} the Treaty of Fontainebleau. Great Britain obtained the portion of the territory east of the Mississippi River. Spain received the territory west of the Mississippi, including New Orleans, although they did not make <b>their</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> that city effective until Governor Alejandro O'Reilly suppressed the Rebellion of 1768. Once in control of New Orleans, the Spanish imposed severe restrictions on trade up the Mississippi, cutting off the supply of arms to the Southern Pawnees and Wichitas.|$|E
5|$|From then on, {{relations}} {{became increasingly}} strained between Matilda and Henry. The couple suspected that they lacked genuine support in England for <b>their</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> the throne, and proposed in 1135 that the King should {{hand over the}} royal castles in Normandy to Matilda and should insist that the Norman nobility immediately swear allegiance to her. This {{would have given the}} couple a much more powerful position after Henry's death, but the King angrily refused, probably out of a concern that Geoffrey would try to seize power in Normandy while he was still alive. A fresh rebellion broke out in southern Normandy, and Geoffrey and Matilda intervened militarily on behalf of the rebels.|$|E
5|$|In early 1935, {{however, the}} company {{heard about the}} game's {{excellent}} sales during the Christmas season of 1934 in Philadelphia and at F.A.O. Schwarz in New York City. Robert Barton, President of Parker Brothers, contacted Darrow and scheduled a new meeting in New York City. On March 18, Parker Brothers bought Darrow's game, helped him take out a patent on it, and purchased his remaining inventory. By April, 1935, the company had learned that Darrow was not the sole inventor of the game, but sought out an affidavit by Darrow to repeat his statements to the contrary, and thus bolster <b>their</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> the game. Parker Brothers subsequently decided to buy out Magie's 1924 patent and the copyrights of other commercial variants of the game to claim that it had legitimate undisputed rights to the game.|$|E

He expected that he would hold safely any Athenian possessions which he might seize before the ratification.* G. Cawkwell, Philip II of Macedon, 102–103. Being very anxious about the delay, Demosthenes insisted that the embassy should travel {{to the place where}} they would find Philip and swear him in without delay. Despite his suggestions, the Athenian envoys, including himself and Aeschines, remained in Pella, until Philip successfully concluded his campaign in Thrace.* G. Cawkwell, Philip II of Macedon, 102–103.|$|E
5|$|The new Edward IV {{visited the}} castle {{regularly}} {{and established a}} council there to govern his estates in Wales. He probably conducted only modest work on the property, although he may could {{have been responsible for}} the remodelling of the Great Tower. In 1473, possibly influenced by his own childhood experiences at Ludlow, Edward sent his eldest son, the future Edward V, and his brother Prince Richard to live at the castle, which was also made the seat of the newly created Council in the Marches of Wales. By now Ludlow had become primarily residential, rather than military, but was still rich in chivalric connotations and a valuable symbol of the Yorkist authority and <b>their</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> the throne. Edward died in 1483, but after Henry VII took the throne in 1485 he continued to use Ludlow Castle as a regional base, granting it to his son, Prince Arthur, in 1493, and reestablishing the dormant Council in the Marches at the property.|$|E
5|$|When the Athenians {{received}} this news, they rapidly changed policy. If Thermopylae {{could no longer}} be defended, then Athenian security {{could no longer be}} guaranteed. By the end of February, the Athenians had dispatched an embassy, including Philocrates, Demosthenes and Aeschines, to Philip to discuss peace between Athens and Macedon. The embassy had two audiences with Philip, in which each side presented their proposals for the terms of the peace settlement. The embassy then returned to Athens to present the proposed terms to the Athenian Assembly, along with a Macedonian embassy to Athens, empowered by Philip to finalize an agreement. The Athenians debated the peace treaty in April and tried to propose a common peace in which all Greek states could partake (including Phocis). However, Demosthenes (at this point a strong proponent of peace) persuaded the Assembly that Philip would never agree to such a peace, and that Athens's vulnerable position meant that they {{had little choice but to}} accept Philip's terms. On 23 April, the Athenians made swore to the terms of the treaty which is now known as the Peace of Philocrates in the presence of the Macedonian ambassadors. Amongst the principal terms were that Athens become Philip's ally, and that they forever renounce <b>their</b> <b>claim</b> <b>to</b> Amphipolis.|$|E
