5|$|From 1749, iron from Pentyrch was {{initially}} {{transported to the}} works using pack-horses, then <b>tub</b> boats were used on the Taff passing onto the feeder via a lock at Radyr Weir. Parts of this lock can still be seen beside the feeder sluice. In 1815 the <b>tub</b> boats were discontinued and a tramway built along the Taff. There is a public picnic site by the Radyr weir.|$|E
5|$|Dougie steals the deputy's {{wedding ring}} and knocks over a {{container}} of Epsom salts into the <b>tub</b> where the unconscious Greer is soaking after Scully removed several specimens from his neck wounds. While Angela Villareal relieves herself, she spots the creature in the <b>tub</b> with the deputy. Mulder and Scully enter the bathroom and find the clothes of the deputy but the man gone. Mulder theorizes that the entity does not just live in water but is a living form of water, becoming visible only when it attacks. He believes that the creature uses people as hosts to reproduce, with the body's water content being used to feed the growth of new creatures. Mulder realizes that everyone needs to evacuate.|$|E

5|$|Lisa {{performs}} a science experiment {{to see if}} cola will dissolve a tooth, and Bart shocks Lisa {{as part of his}} project to prove that nerds conduct electricity. The tooth is also shocked; it undergoes an unusual reaction and creates a race of miniature beings. Lisa discovers this the next day and marvels at how the people in her universe evolve at a rapid rate. Bart destroys some of the ecosystem in Lisa's <b>tub</b> universe, and the people respond by sending a squadron of space ships to attack him. Lisa is shrunk and beamed down into the <b>tub,</b> where the citizens explain that they regard her as God, and they want her to do something about Bart, whom they regard as the Devil. She says she can help them if they unshrink her, but they tell her they have not figured out the technology to do that. Bart grabs the <b>tub</b> and submits it in the science fair, and Lisa is forced to watch from within as Bart wins first prize. Realizing that she is now stuck in the small universe forever, Lisa orders her citizens to grovel and bring her some shoes.|$|E

50|$|The {{first of}} the two rooms (located at the northwerst) {{contains}} two groups of <b>tubs,</b> arranged in radial groups and linked by a system of water pipes. The {{first of the}}se two groups (1 on the plan at right) contains fourteen <b>tubs</b> arranged in a horseshoe pattern. Only two of the <b>tubs</b> in this group have been lost. These <b>tubs</b> {{are designed to be}} sat up in, as is normal for Greek bath <b>tubs.</b> There is a semicircular cavity below the <b>tubs</b> which must have been intended to catch water which overflowed the <b>tubs.</b> Since there is no drain, this water must have been removed from the room by hand. The <b>tubs</b> are mostly made from a conglomerate cement made of sherds of terracotta and sandstone rubble, although a few of the baths furthest to the west are entirely made in terracotta and are portable (perhaps they belong to the same period as the pavement and, like this, belong to the most ancient period of the bathhouse).The second group (2 on the plan at right) consists of twenty-two <b>tubs</b> arranged in a circle on a conglomerate pavement, but they were all damaged by the destruction of the site and may never have been completed.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Eradication {{of early}} gastric {{carcinoma}} (GC) {{is thought to}} contribute to reduction in the mortality of GC, given {{that most of the}} early GCs progress to the advanced GCs. However, early GC is alternatively considered a dormant variant of GC, and it infrequently progresses to advanced GC. The aim {{of this study was to}} clarify the extent of overlap of genetic lineages between early and advanced tubular adenocarcinomas (<b>TUBs)</b> of the stomach. Methods Immunohistochemical staining for p 53 was performed using 28 surgically resected stomachs with 13 intramucosal and 15 invasive <b>TUBs.</b> By chromosome- and array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), genomic copy number constitution was compared between the mucosal and invasive parts of the invasive <b>TUBs</b> and between the mucosal parts of the invasive and intramucosal <b>TUBs,</b> using 25 and 22 <b>TUBs,</b> respectively. TP 53 mutation in exons 5 - 8 was examined in 20 <b>TUBs.</b> Results Chromosomal CGH revealed that 4 q+ and 11 q+ were more common in advanced and early <b>TUBs,</b> respectively, whereas copy number changes in 8 q and 17 p showed no significant differences between early and advanced <b>TUBs.</b> However, array CGH revealed that, of the 13 intramucosal <b>TUBs</b> examined, loss of MYC (MYC -) and gain of TP 53 (TP 53 +) was detected in 9 <b>TUBs</b> and MYC + and/or TP 53 - was detected in 3 <b>TUBs.</b> Of the mucosal samples of 9 invasive <b>TUBs,</b> 7 showed MYC -/ TP 53 + and none showed MYC + and/or TP 53 -. Of the 9 samples from the invasive parts, 1 (from submucosal cancers) showed MYC -/ TP 53 + and 6 (1 from submucosal and 5 from advanced cancers) showed MYC + and/or TP 53 -. The latter 6 tumours commonly showed a mutant pattern (diffuse or null) in p 53 immunohistochemistry, and 4 of the 6 tumours assessable for TP 53 sequence analysis revealed mutations. The overall array CGH pattern indicated that, between the mucosal and invasive parts, genetic lineage was found discontinuous in 5 advanced cancers and continuous in 3 submucosal cancers. Conclusions Genetic lineages often differed between early and advanced <b>TUBs.</b> MYC -/ TP 53 + and MYC + and/or TP 53 - may be the signatures of dormant and aggressive <b>TUBs,</b> respectively, in the stomach. </p...|$|R

5|$|Jonathan Swift, as Dean of St. Patrick's Cathedral in Dublin, {{produced}} many sermons {{during his}} tenure from 1713 to 1745. Although Swift is better known today for his secular writings such as Gulliver's Travels, A Tale of a <b>Tub,</b> or the Drapier's Letters, Swift was known in Dublin for his sermons that were delivered every fifth Sunday. Of these sermons, Swift wrote down 35, of which 12 have been preserved. In his sermons Swift attempted to impart traditional Church of Ireland values to his listeners in a plain manner.|$|E
5|$|Seating at the {{ballpark}} includes fixed stadium seats, general admission bleachers, some with contoured seats, and eighteen skyboxes located on the third floor. As of 2014, total seating capacity is 10,300. Games can be watched from one of four picnic areas—one behind home plate, one on the third base line, one in the third base stands, and one beyond the right field wall. A rentable hot <b>tub</b> deck {{is located in the}} right field corner. There is a concert stage and family fun zone located on The Plaza inside the concourse entrance.|$|E
5|$|As {{consumer}} preferences changed {{and in an}} effort to attract larger groups to the ballpark, in the late 1990s, Greer Stadium's fixed-seating capacity was reduced to 10,300 by eliminating the bleacher sections along the third base side and beyond right field, and constructing three party decks in their places. As a result, the general admission area became confined only to the existing bleachers behind the reserved seating along the first base line in right field. A fourth party area was created by repurposing unused space atop the grandstands behind home plate. Another deck was constructed behind the right-field foul pole, which, at times, featured a rentable hot <b>tub.</b>|$|E

5|$|The First Test at Brisbane was {{dominated}} by Australia, a pattern {{that was to be}} a feature of the series, although Barnes contributed only 31 to the total of 645 which brought an innings victory. Barnes displayed his liking for slightly aggressive practical jokes in this match: during a break for a particularly ferocious thunderstorm, he got a huge block of ice out of the <b>tub</b> in which our drinks were kept, staggered {{to the side of the}} dressing-room and tossed it on to the roof over the English dressing-room. It caused a noise for a start that brought all the Englishmen running and then it came over the side of the gutter, crashed on to the lawn and slithered down the grass.

5|$|The first philosopher {{to outline}} these themes was Antisthenes, {{who had been}} a pupil of Socrates in the late 5th century BC. He was {{followed}} by Diogenes, who lived in a <b>tub</b> on the streets of Athens. Diogenes took Cynicism to its logical extremes, and came to be seen as the archetypal Cynic philosopher. He was followed by Crates of Thebes, who gave away a large fortune so he could live a life of Cynic poverty in Athens. Cynicism spread with the rise of the Roman Empire in the 1st century, and Cynics could be found begging and preaching throughout the cities of the empire. It finally disappeared in the late 5th century, although similar ascetic and rhetorical ideas appear in early Christianity.|$|E
