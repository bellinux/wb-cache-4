5|$|Because {{the orbit}} of Phobos is below {{synchronous}} altitude, the tidal forces from <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> Mars are gradually lowering its orbit. In about 50 million years, it could either crash into Mars's surface or break up into a ring structure around <b>the</b> <b>planet.</b>|$|E
5|$|Galileo {{observed}} <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> Saturn, and {{at first}} mistook its rings for planets, thinking it was a three-bodied system.

The rings reappeared when he observed <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> in 1616, further confusing him.|$|E

5|$|One {{important}} {{characteristic of}} the planets is their intrinsic magnetic moments, which in turn give rise to magnetospheres. The presence of a magnetic field indicates that <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> is still geologically alive. In other words, magnetized planets have flows of electrically conducting material in their interiors, which generate their magnetic fields. These fields significantly change the interaction of <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> and solar wind. A magnetized planet creates a cavity in the solar wind around itself called the magnetosphere, which the wind cannot penetrate. The magnetosphere can be much larger than <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> itself. In contrast, non-magnetized planets have only small magnetospheres induced by interaction of the ionosphere with the solar wind, which cannot effectively protect <b>the</b> <b>planet.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>planet</b> was {{confirmed}} by the Kepler satellite by the transit method, in which <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> passes {{across the face of}} its star in relation to Earth, dimming that star's light by a small amount; this light difference is then used to determine <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> and several of its characteristics, including size and distance from its home star.|$|E
5|$|A {{high-pressure}} area, high or anticyclone is {{a region}} where the atmospheric pressure at the surface of <b>the</b> <b>planet</b> is greater than its surrounding environment.|$|E
5|$|When <b>the</b> {{terrestrial}} <b>planets</b> were forming, {{they remained}} {{immersed in a}} disk of gas and dust. The gas was partially supported by pressure and so did not orbit the Sun as rapidly as <b>the</b> <b>planets.</b> <b>The</b> resulting drag and, more importantly, gravitational interactions with the surrounding material caused a transfer of angular momentum, {{and as a result}} <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> gradually migrated to new orbits. Models show that density and temperature variations in the disk governed this rate of migration, but the net trend was for <b>the</b> inner <b>planets</b> to migrate inward as the disk dissipated, leaving <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> in their current orbits.|$|R

50|$|From {{ancient times}} until the 16th and 17th centuries, {{the motions of}} <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> were {{believed}} to follow perfectly circular geocentric paths as taught by the ancient Greek philosophers Aristotle and Ptolemy. Variations in the motions of <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> were explained by smaller circular paths overlaid on the larger path (see epicycle). As measurements of <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> became increasingly accurate, revisions to the theory were proposed.

50|$|Unlike <b>the</b> <b>planets</b> in <b>the</b> Solar System, <b>the</b> <b>planet's</b> orbit {{is highly}} elliptical, and its {{distance}} varies from 0.54 AU at periastron to 2.8 AU at apastron.
