25|$|On-site auctions â€“ Sometimes {{when the}} stock or assets of a company are simply too vast or too bulky for an auction house to {{transport}} to their own premises and store, they will hold an auction {{within the confines of}} the bankrupt company itself. Bidders could find themselves bidding for items which are still plugged in, and the great advantage of these auctions taking place on the premises is that they have the opportunity to view the goods as they were being used, and may be able to try them out. Bidders can also avoid the possibility of goods being damaged whilst they are being removed as <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> or at least supervise the activity.|$|E
2500|$|On November 30, 2005, Iraq's Foreign Minister, Hoshiyar Zebari, {{supported}} {{the idea of}} an Assyrian administrative region by saying [...] "They (Assyrians) are free to organize a province or regional government. It should not be just because we have Kurdistan, but should be organized around an area. If <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in three provinces or even one it should and can be done." ...|$|E
2500|$|Deism was an {{influential}} worldview during his lifetime. Washington never used [...] "Jesus" [...] or [...] "Christ" [...] in private or public writings or speeches. One document he signed {{but did not}} write did say to the Delaware Indian chiefs that learning the [...] "religion of Jesus Christ" [...] {{is the most important}} thing <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> <b>It</b> is not true that Washington avoided the word [...] "God" [...] and instead used different words. In actuality Washington used [...] "God" [...] 146 times in his personal and public writings. Some of these references to [...] "God" [...] are stock phrases like [...] "God forbid" [...] or [...] "God be with you". Some instances are serious expressions about God and especially His Providence, a common theme among Deists. Washington used words such as [...] "Grand Architect" [...] and [...] "Providence" [...] that were popular among deists. These terms were also commonly used by the Freemasons. While deists and Freemasons did use these words, words like [...] "Providence" [...] specifically were not excessively used by deists and Freemasons, but were also used by Christians during Washington's time period.|$|E

6000|$|I remarked {{incidentally}} {{that there}} were some who looked with unfriendly eyes on his occupation, and that, sooner or later, these people would try to get an Act of Parliament to make bird-catching in lanes, on commons and waste lands illegal.

6000|$|... "Much more likely," [...] Harry assented. [...] "Unless <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> by a surprise.
