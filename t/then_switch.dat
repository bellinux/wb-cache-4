5|$|In the Dimensional Change Card Sorting Task (DCCS), {{children}} are initially asked to sort cards {{by a single}} dimension (such as color), and are subsequently required to alter their strategy to sort cards based on a second dimension (such as shape).

However, five-year-old children are able to sort cards based on one dimension and can <b>then</b> <b>switch</b> to sorting cards on a second dimension.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, Baltimore {{was home to}} several African American classically {{oriented}} music institutions which drew on a rich tradition of symphonic music, chamber concerts, oratorios, documented {{in large part by}} the Baltimore Afro-American, a local periodical. Inspired by A. Jack Thomas, who had been appointed conductor of the city's municipally supported African American performance groups, Charles L. Harris led the Baltimore Colored Chorus and Symphony Orchestra from 1929 to 1939, when a strike led to the company's dissolution. Thomas {{had been one of the}} first black bandleaders in the U.S. Army, was director of the music department at Morgan College, and was the founder of Baltimore's interracial Aeolian Institute for higher musical education. Charles L. Harris, as leader of the Baltimore Colored City Band, took his group to black neighborhoods across Baltimore, playing marches, waltzes and other music, <b>then</b> <b>switch</b> to jazz-like music with an upbeat tempo, meant for dancing. Some of Harris' musicians also played in early jazz clubs, though the musical establishment at the time did not readily accept the style. Fred Huber, Director of Municipal Music for Baltimore, exerted powerful control over the repertoire of these bands, and forbade jazz. T. Henderson Kerr, a prominent black bandleader, emphasized in his advertising that his group did not play jazz, while the prestigious Peabody Institute debated whether jazz was music at all. The Symphony Orchestra produced renowned pianist Ellis Larkins and cellist W. Llewellyn Wilson, also the music critic for the Afro-American. Harris eventually replaced Harris as conductor of the Orchestra and has since become a city musical fixture who is said to have, at one point, taught every single African American music teacher in Baltimore.|$|E

25|$|One major {{difference}} between regulatory T cells and effector T cells is that regulatory T cells typically serve to modulate and deactivate the immune response, while effector T cell groups usually begin with immune-promoting cytokines and <b>then</b> <b>switch</b> to inhibitory cytokines later in their life cycle.

25|$|Their diets {{generally}} {{consist of}} vertebrates, although many invertebrate species {{have also been}} consumed.

Cannibalism {{has been reported in}} a number of different species. Individuals that feed on rodents usually release their prey after a strike, and these snakes evidently can discriminate between trails left by prey that has or has not been envenomated.|$|E
25|$|For 2014, the Lewis Conference {{was only}} able to secure one of their two {{expansion}} teams, however. The Governors played in the Lewis, but the Voyagers were needed in the Clark to restore competitive balance. Ironically, the two met in the 2014 Corps of Discovery Cup Championship. If events followed the preseason plans, these teams would have never matched up in an inter-conference title game. As it was, the Voyagers followed the same script as the Explorers the year before: play in the Clark Conference (on a one-year conditional basis), win the league championship, <b>then</b> <b>switch</b> conferences the very next season. One month after winning the Cup, the Voyagers officially became the sixth member of the Lewis Conference.|$|E
25|$|Plans from 2011 {{have called}} for a new tunnel which runs from Majorstuen via Stortinget to Tøyen, but {{following}} a different route and with intermediate stations at Bislett, Hammersborg and Olaf Ryes plass, in the St. Hanshaugen and Grünerløkka boroughs north of the city center. Three of the lines would thus follow the existing tunnel to Stortinget and <b>then</b> <b>switch</b> to the new line, while the other three lines would follow the new tunnel to Stortinget and then run along the old tunnel onwards. This would allow for a six-minute headway on all but two branches, and also allow the proposed Fornebu Line to Skøyen, Fornebu and Nesodden to be built as part of the metro. Ruter has stated that the current stations are located in the areas which the most people want to travel to, and that if a second tunnel should deviate from these areas, they would have to serve places which generate as much traffic as the current stations.|$|E

25|$|In theory, real-mode {{applications}} {{could be}} directly executed in 16-bit protected mode if certain rules (newly proposed {{with the introduction}} of the 80286) were followed; however, as many DOS programs did not conform to those rules, protected mode was not widely used until the appearance of its successor, the 32-bit Intel 80386, which was designed to go back and forth between modes easily and to provide an emulation of real mode within protected mode. When Intel designed the 286, it was not designed to be able to multitask real-mode applications; real mode was intended to be a simple way for a bootstrap loader to prepare the system and <b>then</b> <b>switch</b> to protected mode; essentially, in protected mode the 80286 was designed to be a new processor with many similarities to its predecessors, while real mode on the 80286 was offered for smaller-scale systems that could benefit from a more advanced version of the 80186 CPU core, with advantages such as higher clock rates, faster instruction execution (measured in clock cycles), and unmultiplexed buses, but not the 24-bit (16 MB) memory space.|$|E
500|$|A {{fundamental}} principle of equine conformation is [...] "form to function". Therefore, {{the type of}} horse used for various forms of warfare depended on the work performed, the weight a horse needed to carry or pull, and distance travelled. Weight affects speed and endurance, creating a trade-off: armour added protection, but added weight reduces maximum speed. Therefore, various cultures had different military needs. In some situations, one primary type of horse was favoured over all others. In other places, multiple types were needed; warriors would travel to battle riding a lighter horse of greater speed and endurance, and <b>then</b> <b>switch</b> to a heavier horse, with greater weight-carrying capacity, when wearing heavy armour in actual combat.|$|E
