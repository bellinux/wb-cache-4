5|$|Hearings began September 27, 1918, {{shortly before}} the end of World War I. Nearly four dozen {{witnesses}} testified. Many were agents of the Bureau of Investigations (BOI), the predecessor of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The agents, controversially and usually erroneously, implicated high-profile American citizens as pro-German, using the fallacy of guilt by association. For example, the Bureau chief labeled some people pro-German because they had insubstantial and non-ideological acquaintance with German agents. Others were accused because their names were discovered in <b>the</b> <b>notebooks</b> of suspected German agents, of whom they had never heard.|$|E

25|$|At first, Rilke had a {{difficult}} time in Paris, an experience that he called on {{in the first part of}} his only novel, <b>The</b> <b>Notebooks</b> of Malte Laurids Brigge. At the same time, his encounter with modernism was very stimulating: Rilke became deeply involved with the sculpture of Rodin, then the work of Paul Cézanne. For a time, he acted as Rodin's secretary, also lecturing and writing a long essay on Rodin and his work. Rodin taught him the value of objective observation and, under this influence, Rilke dramatically transformed his poetic style from the subjective and sometimes incantatory language of his earlier work into something quite new in European literature. The result was the New Poems, famous for the “thing-poems” expressing Rilke's rejuvenated artistic vision. During these years, Paris increasingly became the writer's main residence.|$|E
25|$|Kenneth Murdock was an Assistant Dean of Harvard College. A Boston native, he {{was just}} 25 {{years old at the}} time of the Court. He {{graduated}} from Harvard summa cum laude in 1916 and then served in World War I as an ensign in the Navy. He then returned to the college as Assistant Dean, while his father, a successful banker, was serving on a committee that was reorganizing the University's finances. He later earned his doctorate in English from Harvard and enjoyed a distinguished academic career as Francis Lee Higginson Professor of English Literature, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences (1931–36), and the first Master of Leverett House (1930–41). Among his many publications were Literature & Theology in Colonial New England and <b>The</b> <b>Notebooks</b> of Henry James, which he edited with F.O. Matthiessen. He died in 1975.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{essential}} sources Philostratus claimed to know are the “memoirs” (or “diary”) of Damis, an acolyte and companion of Apollonius. Some scholars claim that <b>the</b> <b>notebooks</b> of Damis were an invention of Philostratus, while others think {{it could have been}} a real book forged by someone else and naively used by Philostratus. Philostratus describes Apollonius as a wandering teacher of philosophy and miracle-worker who was mainly active in Greece and Asia Minor but also traveled to Italy, Spain, and North Africa, and even to Mesopotamia, India, and Ethiopia. In particular, he tells lengthy stories of Apollonius entering the city of Rome in disregard of emperor Nero’s ban on philosophers, and later on being summoned, as a defendant, to the court of Domitian, where he defied the emperor in blunt terms. He had allegedly been accused of conspiring against the emperor, performing human sacrifice, and predicting a plague by means of magic. Philostratus implies that upon his death, Apollonius of Tyana underwent heavenly assumption.|$|E
40|$|A {{notebook}} integrates most of {{the typical}} components of a desktop computer, including a display, a keyboard, a pointing device (a touchpad, {{also known as a}} track pad, and/or a pointing stick) and speakers into a single unit. A notebook can be used away from an outlet using a chargeable battery. Usually, notebook is powered by AC supply from single phase 240 V. When <b>the</b> <b>notebook</b> is depending on the AC supply, it cannot recharge whenever in rural area where there is no AC supply. In this project, <b>the</b> solar powered <b>notebook</b> that implement solar energy is represented in order to give supply to a <b>notebook.</b> <b>The</b> solar <b>notebook</b> concept is a laptop with complete power independent. This is due to powerful batteries that are recharged by any solar panel attached to the computer. The solar panel that attached to <b>the</b> <b>notebook</b> is able to convert solar energy to DC power that can give power to <b>the</b> <b>notebook.</b> It is expected that <b>the</b> <b>notebook</b> can switch on without AC power as it energized by solar energy...|$|R

25|$|Other modernists took up {{political}} {{positions that}} did not fit neatly into the left/right model. H.D., Mina Loy and Nathalie Barney, for instance, are now seen as proto-feminists and their openness about their various sexualities {{can be read as}} foreshadowing the 1970s view that the personal is political. H.D., especially after World War I, came to view the goal of modernism as being the bringing about of world peace. However, she also displayed anti-Semitic views in <b>the</b> <b>notebooks</b> for her book Tribute to Freud. Basil Bunting, who came from a Quaker background, was a conscientious objector during World War I, but because of his opposition to Fascism, served in British Military Intelligence in Persia (Iran) during World War II. William Carlos Williams' political views arose from his daily contact with the poor who attended his surgery. He was another for whom the personal and political blended, an approach best summed up in his statement that 'A new world is only a new mind'.|$|E
25|$|While the {{guidelines}} for maintaining a PNB will differ from force to force, there are several common policies on using <b>the</b> <b>notebooks.</b> In the United Kingdom {{the use of the}} PNBs is dictated by the 2000 Freedom of Information Act.

Each new entry is marked with the day and date in capital letters, and is ended with a line covering the entire width of the page, along with the officer's signature. No information may be removed, and all corrections must be made by striking the incorrect entry with a line and the correct entry should be inserted with the officer's initials. Time is required to be written in 24-hour style, and any gaps left {{at the end of a}} line must be filled by a horizontal line to show that the gap was not created by the removal of a word. Many forces also require directly quoted speech to be written in capitals.|$|E
25|$|Bruno Manser {{was nearly}} imprisoned twice in Sarawak, {{but managed to}} avoid being jailed. He was first arrested on 10 April 1986 after being spotted by police {{inspector}} Lores Matios. While on holiday at Long Napir, Limbang, Matios arrested Manser and brought him to Limbang police station. Manser was not handcuffed, as the inspector did not carry them while on holiday. During the 90-minute ride to Limbang, the Land Rover that carried Manser came close to running out of petrol. Manser {{jumped out of the}} Land Rover and dived into a local river as the vehicle was being refilled with petrol. Matios shouted at him and used his pistol to fire two shots at Manser. Manser lost all of <b>the</b> <b>notebooks</b> he had been working on for the previous four years.
