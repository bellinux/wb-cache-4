5000|$|The {{most complex}} special {{capacity}} of <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> when it functions, {{in one way}} or another, as the Subsidizer of the speech in question. As a general rule, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> can itself say whatever it wants to, even if this [...] "favors one viewpoint over another". But, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> may not impose conditions on how subsidy recipients spend money they get from other sources. If <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> using <b>the</b> speakers to express its own message, it is constitutional. But this analysis changes if <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>is</b> trying to encourage a [...] "diversity of private views indiscriminately". If it is indiscriminate, then under Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez (2001), <b>the</b> <b>government</b> must <b>be</b> acting in a viewpoint-neutral way.

The President of the Republic appoints the prime minister, who must then secure a vote of confidence from the Croatian Parliament (majority of all MPs); the appointment is therefore counter-signed by the speaker of the parliament to signify this. Appointments of members of <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>are</b> done by the prime minister with the approval of the Croatian Parliament (again signified via a counter-signature by the speaker of the parliament). The rules of procedure and regulations enacted by the Government must be published in Narodne Novine—the official gazette of Croatia—to be binding.|$|E

Television access is limited, with most homes not having their own set. The government rolled out digital television in 2014, and a year later there were seven national stations operating, up from just one in the pre-2014 analogue era. The press is tightly restricted, and newspapers routinely self-censor to avoid government reprisals. Nonetheless, publications in Kinyarwanda, English, and French critical of <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>are</b> widely available in Kigali.

There are also other telecommunication companies operating in the state although only providing cellular phone facilities. In 2006, the state has the lowest Direct Exchange Line (DEL) penetration rate, with cellular and internet dial-up penetrations rate only 6.5 per 100 inhabitants. Most residents from the low income groups would rather use mobile phones internet or use internet at their offices instead of setting up internet access at home as the Malaysian main internet provider of Telekom Malaysia were unable to build high speed low cost internet due to the high cost of equipment which are mostly sourced from abroad. Until the end of 2014, there were only 934 telecommunication hotspots in Sabah. Due to this, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>are</b> working to increase the penetration and capability of internet connection as well {{to bridge the gap between}} Sabah and the Peninsular.

50|$|Critics such as Neil E. Harrison {{argue that}} <b>the</b> <b>government</b> would likely <b>be</b> {{resistant}} to sustainable {{changes for the}} current capitalist model.
