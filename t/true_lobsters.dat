40|$|The Spanish Maurit {{surveys were}} carried out {{annually}} from 2007 to 2010, in waters off Mauritania at depths from Bo to 2000 m. A total of 329 stations were sampled, covering the different habitats represented in the Mauritanian slope. Samples were collected using a commercial trawl and a beam trawl in soft bottoms, and a rock dredge for sampling on hard bottoms, namely the giant coral carbonate mounds barrier, the canyon systems in northern Mauritania and seamount. Decapods identification has thrown up a total of 132 different species of which shrimps and prawns and the true crabs were the most diverse with 57 and 34 species; anomurans were represented by 29 species and thalassinideans by four. The taxonomic results obtained for the squat lobsters, hermit crabs, braquiurans and thalassinideans, including the description of four new species have already been published (S. de Matos-Pita and Ramil, 2014, 2015 a, 2015 b, 2016) or it is still in press (S. de Matos-Pita et al, in press). The structure of the decapod assemblages were also analyzed in Garcia-lsarch et al (in edition). This contribution deals with the main results obtained during {{the study of the}} marine lobsters within the infraorders Astacidea, Achelata and Polychelida, and we also included some comments about the anomuran family Lithodidae. The marine lobsters are represented by eight species: Nephropsis atlantica Norman, 1882, Palinurus mauritanicus Grovel, 1911, Scyllarus caparti Holthuis, 1952, Scyllarus subarctus Crosnier, 1970, Polycheles typhlops Heller, 1862, Stereomastis nana (Smith, 1884), Stereomastis sculpta (Smith, 1880) and Stereomastis talismani (Bouvier, 1917). The <b>true</b> <b>lobster</b> N. atlantica and the blind lobster S. nana are reported {{for the first time in}} Mauritanian waters despite their wide distribution in the eastern Atlantic. At the same time, the presence of the slipper lobster S. subarctus in Mauritanian waters is confirmed. Lithodidae collected on Mauritanian continental shelf and slope soft bottoms during the Spanish surveys account for five species and a part of this collection was included by Munoz and Garcia-Isarch (2013) in their study of African Lithodidae.

40|$|Baited {{underwater}} video (BUV) {{is increasingly}} {{been used to}} sample fish species but lobsters are potentially good candidates for sampling with BUV as they are attracted to bait due to their scavenging habits. We built a cost effective BUV system to sample Palinurus elephas, a Mediterranean deep-water lobster. Camera deployments were performed at the Columbretes Islands MPA. We compared the standard method of estimating abundance with BUV, by recording the maximum number (Nmax) of individuals at any one point on the tape, with the estimated <b>true</b> number of <b>lobsters</b> having attended the bait (Ntot). We found it possible to use images of unique body patterns for identifying individuals over time. The highest Nmax - 6 lobsters {{in the field of}} view - was lower than the total number of lobsters estimated by identifying individuals in all three recordings - total of 7 to 11 individual lobsters. This highlights the extent of underestimation of abundance derived from Nmax estimates (Mean Nmax = 4 as opposed to Ntot= 8. 6 by tracking individuals). Measurement of lobster size was trouble free with the coefficient of variation of all measurements being low. However, all measurements were biassed due to calibration problems related to lobster height above the bait bag. Taking into account the relatively low cost of the units, coupled with the ability of this system to work to depths impractical for visual surveys, we propose that this non-intrusive method will be useful for sampling deep water lobster...|$|R
40|$|Releases of {{hatchery}} reared juvenile European lobster {{have been}} performed throughout Europe since the 19 th century. However, poor survival in the wild reduces the success of both stock enhancement programs and large-scale sea-ranching. Predation on released naïve juveniles is substantial and presumably caused by behavioral deficiencies due to an impoverished rearing environment. Lobsters can recognize and discriminate between different chemical cues and modulate their behavior accordingly. This is assumed to also be true for odors related to potential predators. In the present study, shelter-seeking and competitive behavior was investigated {{after a series of}} exposures to a mix of predator odors. Odor exposure was hypothesized to serve as a form of habitat enrichment, acting as an induced predation pressure increasing the lobsters' motivation to find and compete for shelter. Three experiments were conducted in test-environments of gradually increasing complexity. Behavioral assays on individual lobsters in a small and relatively low-complexity test-environment indicated no effects of odor exposure on shelter-seeking or general activity level. In contrast, when allowing for intraspecific competition in the same environment, lobsters exposed to predator odors were significantly more adept at gaining dominance, evident as superior ability to win agonistic interactions. The winners also spent more time in shelter, less time on roaming and displayed less freezing behavior than the losing opponent. Interestingly, interactions were initiated by naïve lobsters significantly more often than lobsters that had experienced predator odors. When performing a small-scale simulated release in a more comprehensive and diverse semi-natural environment, naïve lobsters initially performed better than those exposed to predator odors. However, the exposed lobsters significantly increased shelter occupancy as the experiment progressed over a 35 -day period, whereas the opposite was <b>true</b> for naïve <b>lobsters.</b> The results suggest that there is a long-lasting effect of prolonged odor exposure, but it is only manifested as altered behavior in the presence of environmental triggers. Reasons for the apparent long term effects are discussed, and it is suggested that prolonged exposure to predator odors may either positively influence behavioral plasticity through chemical enhancement, or elevate the lobsters' underlying fright-related motivation in competing for shelter. Further studies are needed to confirm an effect of odor exposure in a more realistic release setting, ideally performed as a small-scale release in natural lobster habitats with predators present to assess natural predator-avoiding behavior...|$|R
