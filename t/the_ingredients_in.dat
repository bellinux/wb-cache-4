2500|$|For the {{majority}} of Earth’s history life has been unicellular. However, unicellular organisms had <b>the</b> <b>ingredients</b> <b>in</b> them for multicellularity to arise. Despite having the ingredients for multicellularity, organisms were restricted {{due to the lack}} of hospitable environmental conditions. The rise of oxygen (The Great Oxygenation Event) led organisms to be able to develop more complex body plans. [...] In order for multicellularity to have occurred, organisms must have been capable of cellular communication, aggregation, and specialized functions. The transition to multicellularity that began the evolution of animals from protozoa is one of the most poorly understood of history’s life events.

2500|$|Controversy arises as {{to health}} {{concerns}} surrounding the questionable classification of gum as food, particularly {{in regard to}} some alternative uses for gum base ingredients. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), chewing gum is considered a food, as the term “food” means “a raw, cooked, or processed edible substance, ice, beverage, or ingredient used or intended for use or for sale {{in whole or in}} part for human consumption, or chewing gum”. Chewing gum is defined as a food of minimal nutritional value. [...] However, many of <b>the</b> <b>ingredients</b> <b>in</b> gum base have uses in inedible products, which raises concern in some consumers. Polyethylene, one of the most popular components of gum base, belongs to a common group of plastics and is used in products from plastic bags to hula hoops. Polyvinyl acetate is a sticky polymer found in white glue. Butyl rubber is typically used in caulking and the lining of car tires, in addition to its role in gum base. Paraffin wax is a byproduct of refined petroleum.|$|E
2500|$|The {{principal}} {{breakthrough in}} soft lenses {{was made by}} Czech chemists Otto Wichterle and Drahoslav Lím, who published their work [...] "Hydrophilic gels for biological use" [...] in the journal Nature in 1959. In 1965, National Patent Development Corporation (NPDC) bought the American rights to produce the lenses and then sublicensed the rights to Bausch & Lomb, which started to manufacture them in the United States. The Czech scientists' work led to {{the launch of the}} first soft (hydrogel) contact lenses in some countries in the 1960s and the first approval of the Soflens material by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1971. These soft lenses were soon prescribed more often than rigid ones, due to the immediate and much greater comfort (rigid lenses require a period of adaptation before full comfort, if any, is achieved). Polymers from which soft lenses are manufactured improved over the next 25 years, primarily in terms of increasing oxygen permeability, by varying <b>the</b> <b>ingredients.</b> <b>In</b> 1972, British optometrist Rishi Agarwal was the first to suggest disposable soft contact lenses.|$|E

2500|$|Lee's physician, Donald Langford, and Peter Wu, {{a doctor}} who had treated Lee for another edema ten weeks earlier, {{believed}} that the fatal edema could {{have been caused by}} a rare allergic reaction to an alkaloid in cannabis, as a large quantity of hashish was removed from his stomach during the earlier edema, and he had been warned not to use it again. Wu told the coroner he believed the death was due to hypersensitivity to either cannabis or equagesic. However, Ronald D. Teare, a professor of forensic medicine at the University of London who was flown in to be the chief expert in the coroner's report, said that it was both [...] "irresponsible and irrational" [...] to attribute either edema to cannabis, and concluded the fatal edema was due to a rare reaction to equagesic. Teare, who had supervised nearly 100,000 autopsies and provided evidence for nearly 20,000 inquests in his 35 years of experience, was echoed by R. R. Lycette, the clinical pathologist at Queen Elizabeth Hospital. Lycette told the hearing that his death could not have been caused by cannabis, and that Lee had died from an edema caused by a reaction to one or both of <b>the</b> <b>ingredients</b> <b>in</b> equagesic.|$|E
60|$|Life is, {{generally}} speaking, {{a blessing}} independent {{of a future}} state. It is a gift which the vicious would not always be ready to throw away, {{even if they had}} no fear of death. The partial pain, therefore, that is inflicted by the supreme Creator, while he is forming numberless beings to a capacity of the highest enjoyments, is but as the dust of the balance in comparison of the happiness that is communicated, and we have every reason to think that there is no more evil in the world than what is absolutely necessary as one of <b>the</b> <b>ingredients</b> <b>in</b> the mighty process.|$|E
60|$|The {{skill of}} an uneducated {{person in the}} use of weapons, or of tools, is of a {{precisely}} similar nature. The savage who executes unerringly the exact throw which brings down his game, or his enemy, in the manner most suited to his purpose, under the operation of all the conditions necessarily involved, the weight and form of the weapon, the direction and distance of the object, the action of the wind, etc., owes this power to a long series of previous experiments, the results of which he certainly never framed into any verbal theorems or rules. The same thing may generally be said of any other extraordinary manual dexterity. Not long ago a Scotch manufacturer procured from England, at a high rate of wages, a working dyer, famous for producing very fine colors, with the view of teaching to his other workmen the same skill. The workman came; but his mode of proportioning <b>the</b> <b>ingredients,</b> <b>in</b> which lay the secret of the effects he produced, was by taking them up in handfuls, while the common method was to weigh them. The manufacturer sought to make him turn his handling system into an equivalent weighing system, that the general principle of his peculiar mode of proceeding might be ascertained. This, however, the man found himself quite unable to do, and therefore could impart his skill to nobody. He had, from the individual cases of his own experience, established a connection in his mind between fine effects of color, and tactual perceptions in handling his dyeing materials; and from these perceptions he could, in any particular case, infer the means to be employed, and the effects which would be produced, but could not put others in possession of the grounds on which he proceeded, from having never generalized them in his own mind, or expressed them in language.|$|E
