5|$|Current Electoral College rules allow a {{candidate}} <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>Presidency</b> while losing the popular vote, {{as happened in}} the elections of 1824, 1876, 1888, 2000, and 2016. In the 2000 election, the outcome was decided {{by a margin of}} 537 votes in Florida, despite a 543,895 margin in the other direction nationally.|$|E
5|$|Dodd {{tried to}} follow in the pattern of New Englanders who have entered the race for the Democratic {{nomination}} and won, including John Kerry, Michael Dukakis, and John F. Kennedy. If elected, Dodd would have become the second Roman Catholic president (after Kennedy) and the second Connecticut-born president (after George W. Bush). He would have been the first Senator <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> while in office since Kennedy was elected in 1960 (that honor ultimately went to Barack Obama). After his withdrawal from the race, Dodd went on to endorse the eventual winner Barack Obama, and retired from the Senate in 2011.|$|E
5|$|The Democrats {{held their}} {{convention}} {{the next month}} in New York City. The convention soon deadlocked, and after 103 ballots, the delegates finally agreed on a compromise candidate, John W. Davis, with Charles W. Bryan nominated for vice president. The Democrats' hopes were buoyed when Robert M. La Follette Sr., a Republican senator from Wisconsin, split from the GOP {{to form a new}} Progressive Party. Many believed that the split in the Republican party, like the one in 1912, would allow a Democrat <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency.</b>|$|E
50|$|Representing the UNE (Unidad Nacional de la Esperanza) in the 2003 presidential elections, he lost to Óscar Berger on December 28, 2003, this is {{the closest}} a left-wing presidential {{candidate}} had come <b>to</b> <b>winning</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> since democracy was restored in 1985.|$|R
50|$|Although a {{very high}} profile sponsor of the DRP, he was {{defeated}} in his bid <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> Vice <b>Presidency</b> of <b>the</b> Party in April 2006.|$|R

5|$|The {{first chapter}} of Team of Rivals portrays four major contenders for the 1860 Republican presidential {{nomination}} on May 18, 1860, awaiting {{the results of the}} national convention by telegraph: New York Senator and former governor William H. Seward, widely considered the frontrunner; Ohio Governor Salmon P. Chase, a favorite of the party's more radical wing; former Missouri Attorney General Edward Bates, preferred by more conservative elements of the party; and Abraham Lincoln, a former U.S. Representative from Illinois. Goodwin then describes how each candidate rose to national political prominence: Seward through a long alliance with New York political boss Thurlow Weed, Chase through his early advocacy of the abolition of slavery, Bates through a speech opposing President James K. Polk at the 1847 River and Harbor Convention, and Lincoln through a series of debates with Democratic rival Stephen A. Douglas in the 1858 Illinois Senate election. Lincoln is ultimately the victor at the 1860 convention through a superior political operation and by making himself the unobjectionable second choice of all Republican factions, and proceeds <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency.</b>|$|E
25|$|It was {{produced}} by leaders trying <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency,</b> with contenders building their own national coalitions.|$|E
25|$|Despite their {{significant}} loss in {{the election}} of 1856, Republican leaders realized that even though they appealed only to Northern voters, they need win only two more states, such as Pennsylvania and Illinois, <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> in 1860.|$|E
50|$|Recognizing that he can't {{secure the}} {{required}} 13 votes <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> Senate <b>Presidency,</b> Pangilinan has withdrawn his bid on July 25. The Liberals will now support Enrile for <b>the</b> Senate <b>Presidency.</b>|$|R
50|$|Perot, who {{received}} 18.9% {{of the popular}} vote as an independent candidate in the 1992 presidential election and wanted to participate also in the 1996 presidential election, thought Americans were disillusioned with the state of politics as being corrupt and unable to deal with vital issues. Perot claimed to represent a viable alternative to Republicans and Democrats, and, as a result, founded the Reform Party. Perot <b>won</b> 8.4% of <b>the</b> popular vote in 1996. Although he came nowhere close <b>to</b> <b>winning</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency,</b> no other third-party or independent candidate has since managed to receive such a high share of the vote.|$|R
50|$|Despite coming close <b>to</b> <b>winning</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency,</b> Hughes did {{not seek}} the Republican {{nomination}} again in 1920. Hughes also advocated ways to prevent the return of President Wilson's expanded government control over important industries such as the nation's railroads, which he felt {{would lead to the}} eventual destruction of individualism and political self-rule. After Robert LaFollette's Progressive Party advocated the return of such regulations during the 1924 US Presidential election, Hughes shifted rightwards, believing that the federal bureaucracy should now have limited powers over individual liberties and property rights and that common law should be strictly enforced.|$|R
25|$|Four {{other parties}} {{nominated}} candidates that had ballot access or write-in access {{to at least}} 270 electoral votes, the minimum number of votes needed in the 2012 election <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> through {{a majority of the}} electoral college.|$|E
25|$|Robinson {{became the}} first Labour Party {{candidate}}, the first woman and the first non-Fianna Fáil candidate {{in the history of}} contested presidential elections <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency.</b> Famously, RTÉ broadcast her victory speech live rather than the Angelus. Her first television interview as President Elect was on the RTÉ children's television show The Den with Ray D'Arcy, Zig and Zag (puppets) and Dustin the Turkey.|$|E
25|$|A {{candidate}} must {{receive an}} absolute majority of electoral votes (currently 270) <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> or the vice presidency. If no candidate receives {{a majority in}} the election for president or vice president, the election is determined via a contingency procedure established by the Twelfth Amendment. In such a situation, the House chooses one of the top three presidential electoral vote-winners as the president, while the Senate chooses one of the top two vice presidential electoral vote-winners as vice president.|$|E
25|$|At various times, Colbert had {{mentioned}} Mike Huckabee, Vladimir Putin, and even himself, as possible running mates. He {{also agreed to}} endorse Garry Kasparov's bid <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> Russian <b>presidency</b> in return for Kasparov's support for his campaign.|$|R
50|$|Guéï {{initially}} claimed <b>to</b> have <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> in {{a single}} round. However, it soon emerged that Gbagbo had actually won 59 percent of <b>the</b> vote--enough <b>to</b> <b>win</b> {{in a single}} round. When Guéï continued to insist he had won, a wave of protests drove him from power, and Gbagbo {{was sworn in as}} President.|$|R
50|$|There is {{agreement}} {{in the international community}} that the presidential elections were at least partially manipulated. In July 2008, an exit poll commissioned by the US was released, revealing that Odinga was predicted <b>to</b> have <b>won</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> by a comfortable margin of 6%, 46% to 40%, well outside of the exit poll's 1.3% margin of error.|$|R
25|$|Unger {{also helped}} {{organize}} the presidential bids of former finance minister and governor of Ceará, Ciro Gomes, in 1998 and 2002. In 1998, Gomes came in third place with 11% of the vote, and in 2002 he came in fourth place with 12% of the vote. Unger had written The Next Step: An Alternative to Neoliberalism with Gomes in 1996. At the national level in 2002, again {{in the second round}} of the election, Unger supported Lula who went on to defeat José Serra <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>Presidency.</b>|$|E
25|$|Arif {{died in a}} {{plane crash}} in 1966, in what may have been an act of {{sabotage}} by Ba'athist elements in the Iraqi military. Abd ar-Rahman al-Bazzaz became acting president for three days, and a power struggle for the presidency occurred. In the first meeting of the Defense Council and cabinet to elect a president, Al-Bazzaz needed a two-thirds majority <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency.</b> Al-Bazzaz was unsuccessful, and Abdul Rahman Arif was elected president. He was viewed by army officers as weaker and easier to manipulate than his brother.|$|E
25|$|When the {{campaign}} began, Lenihan {{was seen as}} a near certainty <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency.</b> The only question asked was whether Robinson would beat Currie and come second. However, as {{the campaign}} proceeded, it became apparent that Lenihan's victory was by no means a foregone conclusion, and that Robinson was a serious contender. Crucial to her appeal was the deep unpopularity of the then Taoiseach Charles Haughey and the rising popularity of the Labour Party leader Dick Spring. Notwithstanding, Fianna Fáil knew they could count on Lenihan to mount a barnstorming campaign in the last few weeks.|$|E
50|$|Clinton was <b>the</b> first Democrat <b>to</b> <b>win</b> {{re-election}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> since Franklin D. Roosevelt, and {{the first}} Southern Democrat <b>to</b> <b>win</b> re-election since Andrew Jackson in 1832.|$|R
50|$|Catholic-Protestant sectarianism {{has also}} been a factor in U.S. presidential campaigns. Prior to John F. Kennedy, only one Catholic (Al Smith) had ever been a major party presidential nominee, and he had been solidly {{defeated}} largely because of claims based on his Catholicism. JFK chose to tackle the sectarian issue head-on during the West Virginia primary, but that only sufficed <b>to</b> <b>win</b> him barely enough Protestant votes <b>to</b> eventually <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> by one of the narrowest margins ever.|$|R
50|$|News {{networks}} projected {{the elections}} in New Hampshire, Georgia, and New Jersey for Bill Clinton before getting results for either of the said states, all of which voted for Bill Clinton by less than 2.5%, which means their projections were nearly inaccurate. In fact, news networks projected {{the elections in}} states {{with a total of}} 300 electoral votes for Bill Clinton as soon as their polls closed, which was enough <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> whole <b>presidency.</b>|$|R
25|$|When President Grover Cleveland {{blamed the}} Democratic party's {{support of the}} coinage of silver for his failure <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> in 1888, Davis left the party. He also sold the Franklin Herald and in 1889 founded the Sulphur Springs Alliance Vindicator. He campaigned for Democrat Jim Hogg in his gubernatorial bid in 1890 because the Farmers' Alliance {{endorsed}} him. Thereafter, Davis cast his fortunes with the People's Party (commonly known as the Populists). He {{was one of only}} five lawyers to participate in the founding convention of the People's party in Cincinnati in 1892, where he served on both the executive and platform committees.|$|E
25|$|Press reports at {{the time}} claimed that a ferocious fight erupted over Williams' successor. Williams' {{resignation}} came just 15 days before the Teamster convention, at which a successor {{would have to be}} elected. In addition to Presser, other candidates for the presidency were reported to be M.E. (Andy) Anderson, president of the statewide Teamsters organization in California; Joseph Morgan, president of the Teamsters in Florida; Don Peters, president of the large Teamsters local in Chicago; and Ray Schoessling, secretary-treasurer of the international Teamsters union and a Williams appointee. The press reported that Presser had formed an alliance with Anderson, which gave him enough votes <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency.</b>|$|E
25|$|Prior to the election, {{commentators}} discussed whether Senator Obama {{would be}} able to redraw the electoral map by winning states that had been voting for Republican candidates in recent decades. In many ways, he was successful. He won every region of the country by double digits except the South, which John McCain won by nine percent. Obama won Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, North Carolina, Florida, and Virginia in the South (region as defined by the US Census Bureau). McCain won most of the Deep South, where white voters have supported Republican candidates by large margins in the last few decades. Obama also defied political bellwethers, becoming the first person <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> while losing Missouri since 1956 (as well as the first Democrat ever to do so) and while losing Kentucky and Tennessee since 1960. He was the first Democrat to win without Arkansas since that state joined the Union in 1836 and the first Democrat <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> without winning West Virginia since 1916. Because one West Virginia elector voted for the Democrat in 1916, Obama was the first Democrat to win without any electors from the state since its founding in 1863. Indiana and Virginia voted for the Democratic nominee {{for the first time since}} 1964. Although Obama did not win other normally Republican states such as Georgia and Montana (which were won by Bill Clinton in 1992), he nonetheless was competitive in both. He lost Montana by just under 3% and Georgia by slightly more than 5%. Also notably, Barack Obama won all of the 2004 swing states (states that either Kerry or Bush won by less than 5%) by a margin of 8.5 percent or more except for Ohio, which the Democrat carried by 4.5 percent.|$|E
5000|$|Mexican presidents Miguel de la Madrid, in {{the early}} 80s and Carlos Salinas de Gortari in the late 80s, started {{implementing}} liberal economic strategies that were seen as a good move. However, Mexico experienced a strong economic recession in 1982 and the Mexican peso suffered a devaluation. Presidential elections held in 1988 were forecast to be very competitive and they were. Leftist candidate Cuauhtémoc Cárdenas, son of Lázaro Cárdenas {{one of the most}} beloved Mexican presidents, created a successful campaign and was reported as the leader in several opinion polls. On July 6, 1988, the day of the elections, a system shutdown of the IBM AS/400 that the government was using to count the votes occurred, presumably by accident. The government simply stated that [...] "se cayó el sistema" [...] ("the system crashed"), to refer to the incident. When the system was finally restored, the PRI candidate Carlos Salinas was declared the official winner. It was {{the first time since the}} Revolution that a non-PRI candidate was so close <b>to</b> <b>winning</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency.</b>|$|R
5000|$|DiFrancesco ran for Senate Minority Leader {{after the}} 1981 elections, eschewing the {{traditional}} rotation of leadership posts. He defeated James P. Vreeland (R-Towaco), {{who had served}} as Assistant Minority Leader during the previous session. DiFrancesco's attempt <b>to</b> <b>win</b> GOP control of the upper house in 1983 was unsuccessful. After Republicans won a majority of seats in the 1991 election, DiFrancesco used a similar strategy and beat the sitting Minority Leader, John H. Dorsey, <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> Senate <b>presidency.</b>|$|R
5000|$|For {{his work}} in Congress, Spratt won praise from Columbia's {{newspaper}} The State, which called him [...] "one of his party's most reliable 'bridges' to the Republican side." [...] National Journal featured him on its cover as [...] "a stand-out" [...] in Congress, comparing his legislative skills to the [...] "best infielders in baseball." [...] In a Washingtonian magazine survey, Congressional staff voted him a [...] "Workhorse" [...] and [...] "House Member I'd Like <b>to</b> See <b>Win</b> <b>the</b> <b>Presidency</b> in 2008." ...|$|R
25|$|Before {{the general}} {{elections}} on November 5, 2006, the National Assembly {{passed a bill}} further restricting abortion in Nicaragua. As a result, Nicaragua {{is one of five}} countries in the world where abortion is illegal with no exceptions. Legislative and presidential elections took place on November 5, 2006. Ortega returned to the presidency with 37.99% of the vote. This percentage was enough <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency</b> outright, because of a change in electoral law which lowered the percentage requiring a runoff election from 45% to 35% (with a 5% margin of victory). Nicaragua's 2011 general election resulted in re-election of Ortega, with a landslide victory and 62.46% of the vote. In 2014 the National Assembly approved changes to the constitution allowing Ortega to run for a third successive term.|$|E
25|$|Though Gore came {{in second}} in the electoral vote, he {{received}} 547,398 more popular votes than Bush, making him the first person since Grover Cleveland in 1888 to win the popular vote but lose in the Electoral College. Gore failed to win the popular vote in his home state, Tennessee, which both {{he and his father}} had represented in the Senate, making him the first major-party presidential candidate to have lost his home state since George McGovern lost South Dakota in 1972. Furthermore, Gore lost West Virginia, a state that had voted Republican only once in the previous six presidential elections, and Bill Clinton's home state of Arkansas, which had voted twice before to elect Gore vice president. A victory in any of these three states would have given Gore enough electoral votes <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>presidency.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1987, {{elections}} for {{the leadership of the}} United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) were held. UMNO was the leader of the governing Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition, and its President would automatically become Prime Minister of Malaysia. Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah challenged the incumbent UMNO President and Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad, and was widely touted <b>to</b> <b>win</b> <b>the</b> <b>Presidency.</b> However, Mahathir won 761 votes to Razaleigh's 718, and remained President. Many of Razaleigh's supporters refused to accept this, and argued that the election was tainted. 12 UMNO members filed suit in the High Court, attempting to get a court order for new elections. As part of their evidence, they presented claims that 78 of the 1,479 delegates eligible to vote in the elections were illegal, and that several documents involved in the election had been tampered with. Later, one of the 12 plaintiffs withdrew from the suit. Although Razaleigh was not involved in the case, it was widely believed he had been funding and supporting the suit.|$|E
50|$|The End of the Cold War and the {{beginning}} of the era of sustained economic expansion coincided during the 1990s. On January 1, 1994 Canada, Mexico and the United States signed the North American Free Trade Agreement, creating the world's largest free trade area. Quebec held a referendum in 1995 for national sovereignty in which 51% voted no to 49% yes.

In September 2004, he was appointed minister of tourism by Panamanian president Martín Torrijos for a five-year term. He holds a [...] law degree from the University of Panama and an LL.M in International Law from Harvard University. He is married to singer Luba Mason.|$|R
