A further re-organisation saw the units split again in 1965 and re-raised as battalion-level formations under their old numerical designations. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> separate since then.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter is perpetually {{covered with}} clouds {{composed}} of ammonia crystals and possibly ammonium hydrosulfide. The clouds {{are located in}} the tropopause and are arranged into bands of different latitudes, known as tropical regions. These are sub-divided into lighter-hued zones and darker belts. The interactions of these conflicting circulation patterns cause storms and turbulence. Wind speeds of 100m/s (360km/h) are common in zonal jets. The zones have been observed to vary in width, color and intensity from year to year, but <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> sufficiently stable for scientists to give them identifying designations.|$|E
5|$|The Patriots and the Bills {{were both}} charter {{members of the}} AFL, and even competed {{with each other in}} an AFL playoff game. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> divisional rivals since the NFL-AFL merger. Prior to the rise of Tom Brady, the two teams shared a mellow, yet {{occasionally}} competitive rivalry, featuring highlights from players such as O.J. Simpson, Steve Grogan, Joe Ferguson, Jim Kelly, and Drew Bledsoe. However, Brady has dominated the Bills ever since taking over as the Patriots' franchise quarterback, holding a 26-3 regular season record over them. Though Patriots fans usually feel apathetic towards the Bills, Bills fans have come to despise the Patriots more than any other rival. The rivalry has remained somewhat intense in recent years with multiple players having played for both teams, the Bills usually giving their all when playing the Patriots, and the presence of Rex Ryan, who coached both the Bills and Jets and was known for his trash-talk.|$|E

5|$|The {{temple and}} villa {{remained}} {{in the hands of}} Garrick's wife until her death in 1822 at the age of 98. It was subsequently bought by her solicitor, Thomas Carr, who preserved it as a monument to Garrick and even erected a statue of him in the temple to replace the Roubiliac Shakespeare. It changed hands several more times until, in 1923, the villa was converted into apartments. The riverside lawn was sold separately along with the temple and was bought by a Paul Glaize, who built a three-storey house alongside the temple. This caused such controversy and public outcry that in 1932 the site was bought by Hampton Urban District Council so that Glaize's Temple House could be demolished. The lawn and temple were subsequently opened to the public. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>remained</b> in public ownership ever since.|$|E
