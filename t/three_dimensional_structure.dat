25|$|Recently, an {{association}} between biofilms and tonsilloliths was shown. Central to the biofilm concept {{is the assumption that}} bacteria form a <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>structure,</b> dormant bacteria being in the center to serve as a constant nidus of infection. This impermeable structure renders the biofilm immune to antibiotic treatment. By use of confocal microscopy and microelectrodes, biofilms similar to dental biofilms were shown to be present in the tonsillolith, with oxygen respiration at the outer layer of tonsillolith, denitrification toward the middle, and acidification toward the bottom.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the modern accelerator and free-electron laser projects requires to consider wake fields of very short bunches in arbitrary <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>structures.</b> To obtain the wake numerically by direct integration is difficult, since {{it takes a long}} time for the scattered fields to catch up to the bunch. On the other hand no general algorithm for indirect wake field integration is available in the literature so far. In this paper we review the known indirect methods to compute wake potentials in rotationally symmetric and cavity-like <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>structures.</b> For arbitrary <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> geometries we introduce several new techniques and test them numerically.

40|$|A {{method for}} forming {{permanent}} <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>structures</b> from colloidal particles using holographic optical trapping is described. Holographic optical tweezers (HOT) {{are used to}} selectively position charge stabilized colloidal particles within a flow cell. Once the particles are in the desired location an electrolyte solution is pumped into the cell which reduces the Debye length and induces aggregation caused by the van der Waals attraction. This technique allows {{for the formation of}} <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>structures</b> both on and away from the substrate that can be removed from solution without the aid of critical point drying. This technique is inexpensive, fast, and versatile as it relies on forces acting on almost all colloidal suspensions. Comment: Submitted to Journal of Applied Physic...|$|R
500|$|Another {{key event}} {{in the history of}} PKA {{occurred}} when Susan Taylor and Janusz Sowadski at the University of California San Diego solved the <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>structure</b> of the catalytic subunit of the enzyme. It was also realized that inside cells, PKA catalytic subunits are found in complex with regulatory subunits and inhibitor proteins that block the activity of the enzyme. [...] An additional facet of PKA action that was pioneered by John Scott at the University of Washington and Kjetil Tasken at the University of Oslo is that the enzyme is tethered within the cell through its association with a family of A-kinase Anchoring proteins (AKAPs). [...] This led to the hypothesis that the subcellular localization of anchored PKA controls what proteins are regulated by the kinase.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} work in RNA {{structural biology}} coincided, more or less, {{with the work}} being done on DNA in the early 1950s. [...] In their seminal 1953 paper, Watson and Crick suggested that van der Waals crowding by the 2`OH group of ribose would preclude RNA from adopting a double helical structure identical to the model they proposed - {{what we now know}} as B-form DNA. This provoked questions about the <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>structure</b> of RNA: could this molecule form some type of helical structure, and if so, how? ...|$|E
2500|$|Structure-based drug design (or direct drug design) {{relies on}} {{knowledge}} of the <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>structure</b> of the biological target obtained through methods such as x-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. If an experimental structure of a target is not available, {{it may be possible}} to create a homology model of the target based on the experimental structure of a related protein. Using the structure of the biological target, candidate drugs that are predicted to bind with high affinity and selectivity to the target may be designed using interactive graphics and the intuition of a medicinal chemist. [...] Alternatively various automated computational procedures may be used to suggest new drug candidates.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{laboratory}} {{measurements of}} double layers are reviewed. Most experiments {{that are considered}} employed triple plasma devices or Q-machines. It is shown {{that a variety of}} both one and <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> phenomena have been achieved. Stationary one and <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>structures</b> consist of monotonic double layers, very weak, weak, strong and very strong double layers with potential steps e(phi) /T(e) equal to about 1, less than, greater than, and much greater than 10, respectively. Multiple double layers consist of structures with large potential dips on the low potential side and stairstep double layers. Two and <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> <b>structures</b> include multiple double layers, which resemble U shaped double layers, and ionization produced strong double layers. Moving double layers include ion acoustic double layers and double layers which are the result of drifting species and mismatches at plasma boundaries. It appears that double layers can be BGK solutions or related to turbulence. Double layer creation can occur in a variety of different ways. Ionization can sometimes be important and sometimes play no role at all...|$|R
