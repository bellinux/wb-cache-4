5|$|Joseph Locke, driving Rocket, now {{saw that}} there were people on the line ahead. Rocket was an {{engineering}} prototype, and had not been equipped with brakes. Locke threw the engine into reverse gear, a process which took ten seconds to engage. As Rocket continued to approach, Huskisson and Holmes panicked. Holmes clung <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the Duke's carriage, while Huskisson made two efforts to run across the track to safety, each time returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the carriage.|$|E

5|$|A soccer kick is {{performed}} when a fighter is standing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> or {{in front of}} an opponent on the ground and kicks the grounded opponent's head. This is done in a style similar to an association football player kicking a football. Most practitioners aim to use their shins for the point of impact rather than the foot. While soccer kicks are usually delivered to the head, kicks {{to other parts of the}} body in a similar style are also referred to as soccer kicks.|$|E

5|$|Albion players – {{along with}} those of other Football League teams – first wore numbers on the back of their shirts in the {{abandoned}} season of 1939–40, and names on the back of their shirts from 1999–2000.

5|$|Chicks hatch within 24 {{hours of}} each other. Six days after hatching, the chicks' eyes have opened and after eight days they {{are covered in}} whitish down. Chicks defecate outside of the nest by raising their tail <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the nest, so nests with older chicks are {{surrounded}} by faecal matter. Both parents feed and brood the chicks, taking it in turns. When one parent returns with food, it takes over brooding duties while the other leaves to hunt.|$|E

5|$|City {{finished}} {{the season with}} a 2–1 defeat at Wycombe Wanderers, when Luke Medley scored a penalty on his first start for the club. McCall had made a number of changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side,</b> after his decision to release 13players, giving a debut to Sean Taylforth and also giving places to three of the released players. It was also David Wetherall's final game for the club.|$|E

The chairs had eye bolts under the seat, so they could be attached to a ship-deck using cables.|$|E

When the van breaks down early on, the family learns that they must push the van until it is moving at about 20mph before it is put into gear, at which point they have to run up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> door and jump in. Later on, the van's horn starts honking unceasingly by itself.|$|E

5|$|In {{the fifth}} round, Arsenal {{travelled}} to The Hawthorns to play West Bromwich Albion. Wenger added experience <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> to complement youth, with Parlour, Edu, Kanu and Keown all featuring. Arsenal {{took the lead}} in the 25th minute through Kanu. Lauren's cross from the right-hand side deflected {{in the direction of the}} striker. His header was saved by goalkeeper Russell Hoult, who was unable to deny Kanu shooting the rebounded ball into the net. Aliadière scored Arsenal's second goal of the match following Hoult's poor clearance.|$|E

He played three games for Woking, scoring one goal. Rhodes returned to Rotherham but was released by the club having played 18games and scoring four goals during his one season stay.|$|E
5|$|Montoya {{made his}} pit stop on lap 22. However, his pit stop proved problematic: the signal lights at his pit box stopped working, causing the Williams refuller {{to switch to}} the fuel rig for Ralf Schumacher and Montoya {{remained}} stationary for 20 seconds longer than usual. Montoya was also fuelled for longer than his team planned. Ralf Schumacher thus inherited the lead with Michael Schumacher behind him and Montoya re-emerged in fourth place. One lap later, Michael Schumacher took his pit stop and he {{came out with a}} fuel pressure problem which meant he pulled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the main straight and retired. Burti spun off and beached his car in the gravel trap at Nordkurve on the same lap. Ralf Schumacher made his pit stop on lap 24 and rejoined with a 10-second advantage. Villeneuve, Button and Alonso all followed Ralf Schumacher into the pit lane on the same lap. Alonso encountered a problem when leaving his pit box: the Minardi refuelling valve had a problem, and his car's afterburner remained on, though the flames extinguished themselves when Alonso accelerated out of the pit lane. Montoya pulled over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the track on lap 25, with smoke billowing from his engine, and retired. Fisichella made a pit stop from fourth on lap 26 and re-emerged in fifth behind Villeneuve. Marques retired from the race with a gearbox problem on the same lap. Coulthard made a pit stop on lap 27 and immediately became the race's next retirement when he acclerated away from his pit box with a blown engine. The resulting event meant he pulled <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the circuit. Panis made his pit stop on lap 31 and came out behind Button and Alesi. Barrichello became the final driver to make a scheduled pit stop on the 32nd lap.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{for a new}} {{building}} on the site have gone through several generations. The first design consisted of a six-storey building (including basement), which had a large shop on the ground floor, {{as well as an}} underground car park and four floors of residential apartments, with a top level to hold the building's mechanics. Each floor would have 4,000 square feet (372 m2), and {{there would have been a}} leaning tower <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> of the building. The design was given planning permission in 2005.|$|E
