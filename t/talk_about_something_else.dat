2500|$|In [...] "Thirteen," [...] the Grounders {{celebrate}} their Ascension Day, a holy day for Grounders. Octavia {{and a man}} named Semet walk in claiming the Sky People destroyed their village. Discussing the situation, Titus wants Lexa to destroy the thirteenth clan while Clarke thinks they just need time to take out Pike from the inside. Speaking to everyone, Lexa orders the armies not to attack, but instead make a perimeter around Arkadia and says that any Sky Person found past the five mile buffer will be killed. Semet is angry at this and attempts to kill Lexa, but is stopped by Titus who kills him. Later, Titus is against Clarke staying, believing she further endangers Lexa's life. He warns Lexa that, just like with Costia, {{she may not be}} able to separate feelings from duty. Lexa is enraged at this, reminding him that because she let Ice Nation into her coalition even after they cut off Costia's head and sent it to her bed, she is more than capable of separating feelings from duty. Later, Clarke goes into Lexa's room and realizes she is saying goodbye. Clarke says the reason she is going back is because the Sky People are her people. Lexa says that this devotion is what makes Clarke the person she is. Clarke suggests that maybe someday they will owe nothing more to their people, and Lexa responds with [...] "May we meet again." [...] Clarke kisses her and they have sex. Afterward, Clarke admires Lexa's tattoos, pointing out there are only seven circles on her back despite there being nine participants. Lexa tells her she got the one on her back on her Ascension Day, and asks to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> Clarke agrees and they become intimate again.|$|E

60|$|Nevis had {{reasons for}} believing {{that it would}} be more {{difficult}} than she seemed to anticipate, but he <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> and then, finding that his companion did not favor him with very much attention, he took his leave.

60|$|They <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> {{and when}} Osborn went fishing after the others left {{the wind had}} dropped, the sun was bright, and the trout would not rise.

60|$|Featherstone {{began to}} <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> but Foster felt embarrassed. It {{looked as if}} he owed his success in {{business}} to the girl's generosity, and although he could not see why this should disturb him, it did.|$|E
60|$|They <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> {{longer than}} they {{probably}} imagined, until the tropical night had come and a splendid moon painted the whole scene with silver; but before it was bright enough to see by Fisher had already noted that {{the lights in the}} library had been abruptly extinguished. He waited for the two men to come out by the garden entrance, but nobody came.|$|R
5000|$|In other words, {{this process}} builds most likely {{unconscious}} states within the listener, and then associates those states through covert conditioning, {{also known as}} covert anchoring, thereby forming unconsciously controlled behaviors and thoughts. Often methods of tricking the listener {{to believe that the}} hypnotist is <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> other than the subject are employed, for instance, by shifting use of time and use of identity in language. One famous example is employed by Milton H. Erickson [...] "and a tomato can be happy".|$|R
60|$|They <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> {{and next}} evening Marston took the schooner's dinghy and rowed down the lagoon. He had heard curlew whistle {{in the dark}} and {{wondered}} whether the birds were as wild as they are in England. For a time he followed the edge of the mangroves, where water dripped from the arched roots, and amphibious things splashed in the muddy caves; and then skirted a sloppy bank the tide flowed across. Now and then he saw a curlew but did not get a shot, and by and by he put down the oars. The damp heat was enervating and he rested and looked about.|$|R
60|$|MAUD. [Sitting down {{in leather}} chair.] I told you I'd reformed. Let us <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> Why is it girls like prize-fighters? I should think--ahem--I mean {{it seems to}} me that girls would think prize- fighters horrid.|$|E
6000|$|... "Watson, of Red Bank," [...] one replied, {{and began}} to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> when he had filled a glass for Dick. The latter was young and {{sometimes}} indiscreet; it was better he should not know what Mordaunt had said.|$|E

5000|$|Walter regroups with Chris at {{the hotel}} restaurant, where he tells him that his mother has been kidnapped, and tells him the real story about the {{shooting}} at the airport.

Chris begins to tell Taber what's going on, but Walter covers up the conversation by telling him that he and Chris had been <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> Before he leaves, Taber asks Walter what name he's traveling under.|$|R
5000|$|The psalm {{considers}} {{the glory of}} God in creation, and moves {{to reflect on the}} character and use of [...] "the law of the [...] ". A comparison is made between the law and the sun, which lends a degree of unity to the psalm. C. S. Lewis suggested that in verse 7, the Psalmist starts <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> [...] "which hardly seems to him like <b>something</b> <b>else</b> because it is so like the all-piercing, all-detecting sunshine." [...] Like the Sun, the law is able to uncover hidden faults, and nothing can hide from it. As the Psalmist meditates on the excellencies of the law, he feels that his sins have been laid open before God's word, and asks for forgiveness and help.|$|R
