These are gauge blocks (Johansson gauge), vernier height gauge, deformation manometer pressure and <b>torque</b> <b>spanner.</b> Furthermore designs documentation in accord with metrological confirmation. These are mainly calibration {{procedures of}} these gauges and procedures of definition measurement uncertainly and interpretation of results. Completed procedures of calibration are processed as attachment to this thesis with graphic design like as in experimental technician institute of ground forces...|$|E
40|$|As {{the main}} form of {{structure}} assembly, {{the stability of}} bolt joint {{is directly related to}} the performance of spacecraft. This essay is used to analyze the cause of standard <b>torque</b> <b>spanner</b> which is not suitable to the tightening torque and summarized according to different operating conditions. Based on thorough analysis of fastening principles and principle of type serialization, a scheme of integrated L Lever is established. The results of experimentation indicate that the scheme of integrated L Lever is reasonable along with the requirement of developing long-life and high-reliability spacecraft. Therefore, the stability of fasteners is greatly enhanced...|$|E

40|$|DE 102009034055 A 1 UPAB: 20110214 NOVELTY - The element has a drive part (1) and an output part (2) {{that are}} {{rotatably}} mounted around a common rotational axis (D). A connecting unit (V) is non-positively {{connected to a}} displacement body (4) that is movably arranged inside a chamber (3) filled with magnetorheological fluid (MRF). An electromagnet arrangement (5) is provided on or in a region of the chamber for generating a magnetic field and influencing displacement force of the fluid. The displacement body is deflected inside the chamber against the displacement force caused by the fluid when limit torque is exceeded. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is also included for a method for torque-limited coupling between a drive part and an output part. USE - Torque-limited coupling element {{for use in a}} <b>torque</b> <b>spanner</b> and a safety clutch of a machine tool (all claimed). Can also be used for portable tool such as drilling equipment, drive train clutch of a vehicle, agricultural equipment and construction machine. ADVANTAGE - The electromagnet arrangement is provided on or in the region of the chamber for generating the magnetic field and influencing the displacement force of the magnetorheological fluid, where the displacement body is deflected inside the chamber against the displacement force caused by the fluid when the limit torque is exceeded such that torque transmission between the drive and output parts can be adjusted in an accurate and quantitative manner, and degradation features in the magnetorheological fluids can be avoided...|$|E
