5|$|An {{independent}} study revealed {{the water to}} be radioactive and potentially dangerous to drink, initially surrounding the project with controversy. Jordan's Ministry of Water and Irrigation has stated that the radioactivity {{is not a problem}} because the water is to be diluted with an equal amount of water from other sources, although it remains disputed if this would be enough to bring the water up <b>to</b> <b>standards.</b> The Ministry said the {{independent study}} was inaccurate, as it did not test water from any of the wells that will be used in the project. The President of the Jordanian Geologists Association Bahjat Al Adwan stated that the radiation is present in the water in the form of Radon, and thus dissipates harmlessly when the water is exposed to air on the surface.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, the Utah Department of Transportation petitioned {{to extend}} US666 {{northwest}} to Richfield, but {{the proposal was}} rejected. The proposed extension followed SR95, SR24, and SR119. A concurrency with US191 would have been routed through Blanding and Monticello to connect {{to the rest of}} the route. One of the reasons cited for rejecting the proposal was that portions of SR24 were not built <b>to</b> <b>standards</b> desired for additions to the U.S. Highway System.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{the mayor}} of Maraba {{requested}} development aid from the National University of Rwanda (UNR), based in nearby Butare; the following year UNR helped found the Partnership for Enhancing Agriculture in Rwanda through Linkages (PEARL). Several entities supported the PEARL project: USAID, Michigan State University, Texas A University and various Rwandan bodies including UNR, the national agricultural research institute (ISAR) and the Kigali Institute of Science, Technology and Management (KIST). PEARL started working with Abahuzamugambi in February 2001 to improve the coffee quality <b>to</b> <b>standards</b> required by the specialty coffee market in the United States.|$|E

5|$|The coat of {{the breed}} {{come in a}} variety of shades with the colours being {{separated}} into three main groups: black/black and tan, any solid colour other than black (ASCOB), and parti-colour. The black variety is either all black, or with tan points on the dog's head, the feet and the tail in a pattern called black and tan. The group known as ASCOB includes all other solid colours from light cream through to dark red, although some lighter colouring is allowed on the feathering according <b>to</b> <b>standards.</b> Parti-coloured dogs are white with patches of another colour such as black or brown, and includes any roan coloured dogs. In addition, American Cockers coats can come in a pattern known as merle, which is not recognised by the American Kennel Club.|$|E
5|$|The {{state is}} {{among the best in}} pre-kindergarten {{education}}, and the National Institute for Early Education Research rated it first in the United States with regard <b>to</b> <b>standards,</b> quality, and access to pre-kindergarten education in 2004, calling it a model for early childhood schooling. High school dropout rate decreased from 3.1 to 2.5 percent between 2007 and 2008 with Oklahoma ranked among 18 other states with 3 percent or less dropout rate. In 2004, the state ranked 36th in the nation for the relative number of adults with high school diplomas, though at 85.2 percent, it had the highest rate among Southern states.|$|E
5|$|At its 2010 {{summit in}} Seoul, South Korea, the G-20 collectively {{endorsed}} a new collection of capital adequacy and liquidity standards for banks recommended by Basel III. Andreas Dombret of the Executive Board of Deutsche Bundesbank has noted a difficulty in identifying institutions that constitute systemic importance via their size, complexity, {{and degree of}} interconnectivity within the global financial system, and that efforts {{should be made to}} identify a group of 25 to 30 indisputable globally systemic institutions. He has suggested they be held <b>to</b> <b>standards</b> higher than those mandated by Basel III, and that despite the inevitability of institutional failures, such failures should not drag with them the financial systems in which they participate. Dombret has advocated for regulatory reform that extends beyond banking regulations and has argued in favor of greater transparency through increased public disclosure and increased regulation of the shadow banking system.|$|E
50|$|Musicians {{also use}} capos {{to bring a}} guitar tuned below <b>standard</b> up <b>to</b> <b>standard</b> tuning. Manufacturers {{sometimes}} recommend tuning a twelve-string guitar a whole-step or more below <b>standard</b> <b>to</b> offset the additional stress of the additional strings. A capo can raise it <b>to</b> <b>standard</b> tuning. However, improved manufacturing techniques have allowed many modern 12-strings to be tuned <b>to</b> <b>standard</b> pitch.|$|R
25|$|Through {{this period}} the {{conversion}} <b>to</b> <b>standard</b> gauge continued, with mixed-gauge track reaching Exeter in 1876.

5|$|The Department of Transportation then {{planned the}} {{extension}} to Interstate 287 in Piscataway, by upgrading Hoes Lane's arterial boulevard and its 20 intersections <b>to</b> <b>standards,</b> eliminating and upgrading several traffic lights. At the intersection with Centennial Avenue, Route 18 will turn off Hoes and follow Centennial to Possumtown Road, {{where it will}} terminate at Interstate 287 exit 8. On February 15, 2012, the New Jersey Department of Transportation broke ground on the project, which is to cost $28 million and was completed in mid-2016. Although NJDOT's road inventory continues to show Route 18 as ending at Hoes Lane and Buckingham Drive in Piscataway, Route 18 signage is complete along the entire route on Hoes Lane and Centennial Ave. to the terminus at Interstate 287, {{as well as on}} signs for exit 8 of I-287. At least one press release suggested that NJDOT considered Route 18 to extend to Interstate 287 as of April 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{economy of}} Belarus {{has been in}} a state of flux since Lukashenko's {{election}} in 1994. His economic policies aimed to prevent issues that occurred in other former Soviet states, such as the establishment of oligarchic structures and mass unemployment. The unemployment rate for the country at the end of 2011 was at 0.6% of the population (of 6.86million eligible workers), a decrease from 1995, when unemployment was 2.9% with a working-eligible population of 5.24million. The per-capita Gross national income rose from US$1,423 in 1993 to US$5,830 at the end of 2011. One major economic issue Lukashenko faced throughout his presidency was the value of the Belarusian ruble. For a time it was pegged to major foreign currencies, such as the euro, US dollar and the Russian ruble {{in order to maintain the}} stability of the Belarusian ruble. Yet, the currency has experienced free fall and also several rounds of devaluation. A major devaluation took place in 2011 after the government announced that average salaries would increase to US$500. The 2011 devaluation was the largest on record for the past twenty years according to the World Bank. Belarus also had to seek a bailout from international sources, and while it has received loans from China, receiving loans from the IMF and other agencies depend on how Belarus reforms its economy according <b>to</b> <b>standards</b> set by the IMF and other agencies.|$|E

25|$|In {{the setting}} up of creameries the {{cooperative}} movement experienced its greatest success. Plunkett got farmers to join together to establish units to process and market their own butter, milk and cheese <b>to</b> <b>standards</b> {{suitable for the}} profitable British market, rather than producing unhygienic, poor-quality output in their homes for local traders. This enabled farmers to deal directly with companies established by themselves, which guaranteed fair prices without middlemen absorbing the profits.|$|E
25|$|The wastewaters from {{large-scale}} {{industries such as}} oil refineries, petrochemical plants, chemical plants, {{and natural}} gas processing plants commonly contain gross amounts of oil and suspended solids. Those industries use a device known as an API oil-water separator {{which is designed to}} separate the oil and suspended solids from their wastewater effluents. The name is derived from the fact that such separators are designed according <b>to</b> <b>standards</b> published by the American Petroleum Institute (API).|$|E

No significant correlation was found between anti-plasmin or anti-urokinase and the ratio of observed <b>to</b> <b>standard</b> weight.
