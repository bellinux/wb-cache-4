5000|$|Other {{differences}} {{distinguish the}} three series: After the first series, brake discs were drilled. The first series kept the [...] "/5" [...] series kick start lever. The later 17mm diameter front axle {{was stronger than}} the first series 14mm axle. The original R90S had [...] "/5" [...] switchgear, but this was changed in 1975 to a new non-standard design that proved unpopular. <b>The</b> engine <b>crankcase</b> <b>breather</b> was a phenolic disc-&-spring item which made a 'popping' sound as the breather operated. The modified [...] "/7" [...] breather was a reed valve design, which could be retro-fitted to [...] "/6" [...] models to replace their noisy breathers.|$|R
50|$|Intake {{manifold}} vacuum {{is applied to}} <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> via <b>the</b> PCV valve, drawing fresh air into <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> via <b>the</b> <b>breather.</b> The airflow through <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> and engine interior sweeps away combustion byproduct gases, including {{a large amount of}} water vapour which includes dissolved chemical combustion byproducts. This mixture of air and crankcase gases then exits, often via another simple baffle, screen, or mesh to exclude oil droplets, through the PCV valve and into the intake manifold. On some PCV systems, this oil baffling takes place in a discrete replaceable part called the 'oil separator'.|$|R
50|$|The first {{refinement}} in <b>crankcase</b> ventilation was <b>the</b> road draft tube, {{which is}} a pipe running from a high location contiguous to <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> (such as <b>the</b> side of the engine block, or the valve cover on an overhead valve engine) down to an open end facing down and located in the vehicle's slipstream. When the vehicle is moving, airflow across the open end of the tube creates a draft that pulls gases out of <b>the</b> <b>crankcase.</b> <b>The</b> high location of the engine end of the pipe minimises liquid oil loss. An air inlet path to <b>the</b> <b>crankcase,</b> called <b>the</b> <b>breather</b> and often incorporated into the oil filler cap, meant that when a draft was generated at the tube, fresh air swept through <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> to clear out the blow-by gases.|$|R
5000|$|Mark I, US built engines {{modified}} in Britain. Modification incorporated new carburettors {{and a new}} {{induction system}} from Solex, revision of <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> <b>breather,</b> new timing gear, and revised crankshaft end thrust. This produced 340 hp when governed to 1,500 rpm with the new carburettors.|$|E
50|$|In {{order for}} the PCV system to sweep fumes out of the {{crankcase}}, the crankcase must have a source of fresh, clean air, called <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> <b>breather.</b> To achieve this, the crankcase air inlet is usually ducted to the engine's air cleaner. The breather is usually provided with baffles and filters to prevent oil mist and vapour from fouling the air filter.|$|E
5000|$|Engine changes {{consisted}} of {{an increase in}} stroke by 2 mm, enlarging displacement to [...] The compression ratio was boosted from 11:1 to 12.5:1 and the cylinder head was made more compact and was given lighter titanium valves, saving 14.1 g and 11.7 g on each intake and exhaust valve, respectively. The valves were driven by a chain with a new hydraulic tensioner. The pistons were made lighter by 1.4 g and used ion-coated rings and shot peened connecting rods. <b>The</b> <b>crankcase</b> <b>breather</b> system had reed valves added to control pressure waves in the intake airbox, a way of avoiding power loss.|$|E
50|$|The iron {{engine block}} is cast in one unit with <b>the</b> <b>crankcase.</b> It {{has been given}} a {{crankshaft}} with nine bearings which makes the strongest contribution to the engine's smooth running, even at high speed. The overhead valves have been given double springs and the cup-and-ball joints on the rockers are fed with oil forced up to the rocker shaft. The cast-iron cylinder head may be removed without disturbing valve settings. The valve mechanism has an easily removable light aluminium cover. <b>The</b> <b>crankcase</b> has a <b>breather</b> on the oil filling cap. Drive to the three-bearing camshaft and the built in generator is provided by chain. Spark timing is controlled automatically. The distributor is positioned {{at the back of the}} engine.|$|R
50|$|In many vehicles, a <b>crankcase</b> <b>breather</b> pipe feeds {{into the}} air intake to vent <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> without {{releasing}} raw hydrocarbon vapors into the atmosphere. In a highly worn engine, hot gases, including unburnt fuel can blow past the piston rings and into <b>the</b> <b>crankcase.</b> This creates an excess oil mist, which is then drawn from <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> into <b>the</b> air intake via the breather. A diesel engine will readily burn this oil mist as fuel, since engine oil has similar energy content and combustion properties as diesel fuel. The extra fuel causes the engine revolutions to increase, causing still more oil mist to be forced out of <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> and into <b>the</b> engine, and a positive feedback loop is created. The engine quickly reaches {{a point where it}} is generating so much fuel from its own crankcase oil that it can sustain operation even with the normal fuel supply shut off, and it will run faster and faster until it is destroyed.|$|R
50|$|Uniquely among flat engines a boxer twin {{suffers from}} {{differences}} in <b>crankcase</b> pressures as <b>the</b> pistons alternately compress and expand <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> gases. This issue is usually addressed {{by means of}} a <b>crankcase</b> <b>breather,</b> as in <b>the</b> BMW R90S. This crankcase pumping effect is also found on singles and 360° parallel twins. Crankcase pressure differentials have scope for providing a form of supercharging, but while such an innovation has yet to be used on a production engine, it has been used to aid lubrication.|$|R
5000|$|The PCV valve is a {{variable}} orifice {{that controls the}} flow of crankcase fumes, admixed with fresh air admitted to the crankcase by the breather, into the intake tract. With no manifold vacuum, a restrictor—generally a cone or ball—is held by a light spring in a position exposing the full size of the valve's orifice to the intake manifold. With the engine running, the restrictor is drawn towards the orifice by manifold vacuum, restricting the opening proportionate {{to the level of}} engine vacuum vs. spring tension. At idle, manifold vacuum is high, but a large amount of extra air would amount to a vacuum leak, causing the engine to run too lean and/or too fast. So at high manifold vacuum, the PCV valve allows only a low flow rate. This is in accordance with the low volume of crankcase fumes generated at low engine speeds. At higher engine speeds, with less manifold vacuum, the PCV valve permits a greater flow rate {{to keep up with the}} greater volume of crankcase fumes; because of the higher engine speed, a greater amount of [...] "extra" [...] air via the PCV system can be tolerated without upsetting the engine's running. At full throttle, very little manifold vacuum is present, so there is little flow through the PCV valve. However, this is the condition under which the maximum volume of crankcase gas is present. Most of it escapes under its own pressure via <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> <b>breather,</b> flowing into the engine's intake tract via the air cleaner.|$|E

Sprint fastback 904 venttop: Very attractive large fiberglass roof attachment, which gives the late model Corvair coupe a fastback appearance (not available for convertible or sedan). Pair of adjustable Gabriel shocks: Replaces stock rear shocks for better handling.|$|R
50|$|The {{large amount}} of {{material}} removed from <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> to provide <b>the</b> tunnel does not allow as much space for stiffening webs across <b>the</b> <b>crankcase,</b> so <b>the</b> overall rigidity of <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> may be less.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>crankcase</b> of <b>the</b> OM 138 {{consists}} of two parts, the lower part with {{the lower part of}} the crankshaft bearing and the upper part with the cylinder block and the camshaft. The lower and upper crankcase parts are connected with pin screws on the horizontal crankshaft center. <b>The</b> lower <b>crankcase</b> part is strengthened with ribs and made of a light metal alloy. The flange of the gearbox is cast onto <b>the</b> lower <b>crankcase</b> part. <b>The</b> upper <b>crankcase</b> part is made of grey cast iron, it reaches from the crankshaft to the cylinder head. On it′s front, <b>the</b> upper <b>crankcase</b> part has a bulge that holds the camshaft, so that the camshaft can be driven by the crankshaft using only two gears. The camshaft is supported in five bearings. For camshaft maintenance, the bulge on <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> front has a removable cover. Mountings for the starter motor, the alternator and the injection pump are also cast onto <b>the</b> <b>crankcase.</b> For <b>the</b> lubrication of the crank- and camshaft, <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> has an oil pipe drilled into.|$|R
50|$|Because {{one side}} of the pump {{diaphragm}} contains fuel under pressure and the other side is connected to <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> of <b>the</b> engine, if the diaphragm splits (a common failure), it can leak fuel into <b>the</b> <b>crankcase.</b>|$|R

50|$|In a {{wet sump}} system, the main {{dipstick}} reaches to {{near the bottom}} of <b>the</b> <b>crankcase.</b> <b>The</b> oil filler cap covers a hole in <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> where oil can be added; it is typically located {{on the top of the}} rocker cover (or if two, the one closer to the front of the vehicle).|$|R
50|$|Lubrication of {{the engine}} was {{performed}} by the fuel itself, collected in a sealed wet sump arrangement beneath <b>the</b> <b>crankcase.</b> <b>The</b> naphtha fuel was an acceptable lubricant and this avoided the problem of separating lubricating oil from condensed fuel vapour leaking past the piston ring seals. It did however require careful sealing of <b>the</b> <b>crankcase.</b>|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>crankcase</b> {{ventilation}} {{system is a}} very important part of the internal combustion engine but not so much attention is usually paid on what happens in <b>the</b> <b>crankcase.</b> A lot of information is available on what happens in the combustion chamber but not so many papers have been published related to <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> ventilation. Actually, efficiency improvements can be obtained with an optimization of <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> {{ventilation system}} and so fuel can be saved and the overall emissions of carbon dioxide reduced. The present is a thesis describing the work done by the author in his internship with Chrysler LLC during the Joint Master Degree program between Politecnico di Torino and University of Windsor. The work is aimed to simulate <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> ventilation system of Pentastar V 6 3. 6 L engine with a 1 D/CFD software to see possible ways of improvement and provide some baseline guidance in the initial selection of design parameters for future engines...|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>crankcase</b> air outlet, {{where the}} PCV valve is located, is {{generally}} separated as widely as practical from <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> air inlet. For example, the inlet and outlet are frequently on opposite valve covers on a V engine, or on {{opposite ends of}} the one and only valve cover on an inline engine. The PCV valve is often, but not always, placed at the valve cover; it may be located anywhere between <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> air outlet and the intake manifold.|$|R
5000|$|Some SI {{engines are}} {{crankcase}} scavenged {{and do not}} use poppet valves. Instead <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> and <b>the</b> part of the cylinder below the piston {{is used as a}} pump. The intake port is connected to <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> through a reed valve or a rotary disk valve driven by the engine. For each cylinder a transfer port connects in one end to <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> and in <b>the</b> other end to the cylinder wall. The exhaust port is connected directly to the cylinder wall. The transfer and exhaust port are opened and closed by the piston. The reed valve opens when <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> pressure is slightly below intake pressure, to let it be filled with a new charge; this happens when the piston is moving upwards. When the piston is moving downwards the pressure in <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> increases and <b>the</b> reed valve closes promptly, then the charge in <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> is compressed. When the piston is moving upwards, it uncovers the exhaust port and the transfer port and the higher pressure of the charge in <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> makes it enter the cylinder through the transfer port, blowing the exhaust gases. Lubrication is accomplished by adding 2-stroke oil to the fuel in small ratios. Petroil refers to the mix of gasoline with the aforesaid oil. This kind of 2-stroke engines has a lower efficiency than comparable 4-strokes engines and release a more polluting exhaust gases for the following conditions: ...|$|R
40|$|A {{multipurpose}} computational {{engine crankcase}} model of KUKTEM two-stroke modular diesel engine {{has been developed}} to analyze <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> interior flow. <b>The</b> complexity of <b>crankcase</b> flow {{is due to the}} occurrence of reed valve before <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> and upstream <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> at <b>the</b> auxiliary port of the engine. Furthermore, current computational fluid dynamic solver is unable to handle the multi-physics interaction of reed valve petal with air. <b>The</b> <b>crankcase</b> flow is investigated by profiling the pressure built-up inside <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> geometry and examination of flow pattern during transient operation. The methodology is based on solution of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) formulation. The governing equation of CFD and robust k-e model are coupled with moving dynamic mesh model and sliding mesh model to represent the isotropic motion of piston and rotational motion of crankshaft and balancing shaft. The inputs to this model are based on motoring results of the same base engine. The pressure fluctuation inside the inlet tract is used as the pressure inlet boundary while the cylinder pressure upstream of <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> is set as the pressure outlet boundary. The modeling results shows that the maximum pressure inside <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> can achieve its ideal compression pressure. The compression ratio is about 1. 14 bar based on nominal crankcase compression ratio but the trend of plot having large deviation due to ineffective reed valve model. Better solution of the flow can be achieved if proper reed valve model is available where the pressure at inlet and the outlet boundary can be calculated simultaneously...|$|R
5000|$|A {{supply of}} {{lubricating}} oil must be fed to <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> to supply <b>the</b> crankshaft bearings. Since <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> {{is also used}} to supply air to the engine, the engine's lubricating oil is carried into the cylinder with the air charge, burnt during combustion and carried out of the exhaust. The oil carried from <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> to <b>the</b> cylinder is used to lubricate the piston. This means that a two-stroke hot-bulb engine will gradually burn its supply of lubricating oil, a design known as a [...] "total-loss" [...] lubricating system. There were also designs that employed a scavenge pump or similar to remove oil from <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> and return it to the lubricating-oil reservoir. Lanz hot-bulb tractors and their many imitators had this feature. This reduced oil consumption considerably.|$|R
2500|$|As well as {{the close}} {{tolerances}} between parts, the engine's lack of gaskets {{was made possible by}} a unique crankcase ventilation system. On any 2-cylinder boxer engine such as the 2CV's, the volume of <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> reduces by <b>the</b> cubic capacity of the engine when the pistons move together. This, combined with the inevitable small amount of [...] "leakage" [...] of combustion gases past the pistons leads to a positive pressure in <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> which must be removed in the interests of engine efficiency and to prevent oil and gas leaks. The 2CV's engine has a combined engine [...] "breather" [...] and oil filler assembly which contains a series of rubber reed valves. These allow positive pressure to escape <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> (to <b>the</b> engine air intake to be recirculated) but close when the pressure in <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> drops as <b>the</b> pistons move apart. Because gases are expelled but not admitted this creates a slight vacuum in <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> so that any weak joint or failed seal causes air to be sucked in rather than allowing oil to leak out.|$|R
5000|$|During normal operation, a {{small amount}} of {{unburned}} fuel and exhaust gases escape around the piston rings and enter <b>the</b> <b>crankcase,</b> referred to as [...] "blow-by". [...] If these gases had no controlled escape mechanism, the gasketed joints would leak (as they [...] "found their own way out"); also, if the gases remained in <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> and condensed, <b>the</b> oil would become diluted and chemically degraded over time, decreasing its ability to lubricate. Condensed water would also cause parts of the engine to rust. [...] To counter this, a crankcase ventilation system exists. In all modern vehicles, this consists of a channel to expel the gases out of <b>the</b> <b>crankcase,</b> through an oil-separating baffle, to the PCV valve, into the intake manifold. In a non-turbo engine, the intake manifold is at a lower pressure than <b>the</b> <b>crankcase,</b> providing <b>the</b> suction to keep the ventilation system going. A turbo engine usually has a check valve somewhere in the tubing to avoid pressurizing <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> when <b>the</b> turbo produces boost.|$|R
5000|$|The D.II {{was based}} on the Austro-Daimler to a large degree. Like the Austro-Daimler, it was built up from <b>the</b> <b>crankcase,</b> which was milled from two pieces of cast {{aluminum}} bolted together at their midline. The cylinders were separately milled from steel and bolted to the top of <b>the</b> <b>crankcase.</b> Steel sleeves were fitted over the cylinders and welded on to form a cooling jacket. Much of this complexity is due to the differential rates of expansion of steel and aluminum, which precluded screwing the cylinders into <b>the</b> <b>crankcase,</b> and <b>the</b> alloys of the era meant that an aluminum cylinder was not possible. Both engines also used a scavenger pump to pump oil out of <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> to a separate cylinder, where a second high-pressure pump supplied oil to the engine. This arrangement allowed for a much smaller [...] "sump" [...] on the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>crankcase,</b> reducing <b>the</b> overall size of the engine, although {{in the case of the}} D.II it was not nearly as much as the Austro-Daimler.|$|R
50|$|Another form of {{rotary inlet}} valve used on {{two-stroke}} engines employs two cylindrical members with suitable cutouts arranged to rotate one within the other - the inlet pipe having passage to <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> only when <b>the</b> two cutouts coincide. The crankshaft itself may form {{one of the}} members, as in most glow plug model engines. In another embodiment, the crank disc is arranged to be a close-clearance fit in <b>the</b> <b>crankcase,</b> and is provided with a cutout which lines up with an inlet passage in <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> wall at <b>the</b> appropriate time, as in Vespa motor scooters.|$|R
50|$|Side-stand mounting:The side-stand mount bolts {{directly}} into the casting that forms the lower section of <b>the</b> left side <b>crankcase.</b> In <b>the</b> event of a hard impact on the side-stand a torsional load is passed to <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> which invariably fails. This potentially expensive weakness is frequently addressed by the fitting of an aftermarket side-stand relocating kit to remove the mount from <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> and place it directly to the frame.|$|R
50|$|The Pétrel was {{an upright}} V-12 engine with two banks of six cylinders, {{arranged}} at 60° to each other, driving a common crankshaft. The cylinder blocks were bolted onto <b>the</b> <b>crankcase,</b> all light alloy parts. <b>The</b> <b>crankcase</b> came in two pieces, with seven crankshaft bearings {{in the upper}} section. Roller bearings were used at the crankshaft ends; the remaining five were plain. <b>The</b> upper <b>crankcase</b> section also had integrally cast water channels {{as part of the}} cooling system.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>crankcase</b> {{ventilation}} valve {{is incorporated in}} the aluminum cylinder head cover.|$|R
50|$|The core of {{the engine}} was a forged steel <b>crankcase</b> which {{enclosed}} <b>the</b> three piece two-throw crankshaft. The cylinders were arranged equally around <b>the</b> <b>crankcase,</b> with each row off-set by 16.3636.° to ensure cooling airflow. Accessories similar to other Cyclone engines were arranged around the rear face of <b>the</b> <b>crankcase</b> and a 0.333:1 planetary reduction gearbox at the front.|$|R
