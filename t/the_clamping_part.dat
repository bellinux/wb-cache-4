40|$|A 3 ’-deoxy- 3 ’-C-methylenephosphonate {{modified}} diribonucleotide {{is highly}} resistant to degradation by spleen phosphodiesterase and not cleaved {{at all by}} snake venom phosphodiesterase. Despite that both the vicinal 2 -hydroxy nucleophile and the 5 ’-oxyanion leaving group are intact, the 3 ’-methylenephosponate RNA modification is also highly resistant towards the action of RNase A. Several different approaches were explored for conjugation of oligoethers to PNA with internally or N-terminal placed diaminopropionic acid residues. Using a post PNA-assembly procedures oligoether attachment to both N-terminal and sidechain amino groups was achieved. Use of a new oligoether functionalized amino acid allows inclusion of oligoether conjugates during on-line machine assisted synthesis, allowing combination of methods for attachment of different oligoethers and co-conjugation of neocuproine cleaver. We have previously shown that PNA-neocuproine conjugates can act as artificial RNA restriction enzymes (PNAzyme). In the present study we have additionally conjugated the PNA with different entities and also constructed systems where the PNA is designed to clamp the target RNA forming a triplex. Some conjugations are detrimental for the activity while most are silent which means that conjugation {{can be done to}} alter physical properties without losing activity. Conjugation with a single oligoether close to the neocuproine does enhance the rate almost two folds compared to the system without the oligoether. The systems designed to clamp the RNA target by forming a triplex are effective if <b>the</b> <b>clamping</b> <b>part</b> is not too long. Changing the direction of a closing base pair, from a GC to a CG pair, enhances the rate of cleavage with a clamping PNAzyme and without compromising the selectivity, leading to the so far most efficient artificial nuclease reported. Tris(2 -aminobenzimidazole) conjugates with antisense oligonucleotides are effective site-specific metal-free RNA cleavers. Here we investigate conjugates with peptide nucleic acids (PNA). In a first study we show that RNA degradation occurs with similar rates and substrate specificities as in experiments with DNA conjugates. In a second study we show that tris(2 -aminobenzimidazole) based artificial nucleases cleave RNA substrates, which form a bulge upon binding to the PNA, with turnover of substrate and a cleavage rate that is also dependent on the bulge sequence. Two methods of analysis for the kinetics, based on IE-HPLC separation of oligonucleotide fragments and analysis of Cy 5 -labelled oligonucleotide fragments by denaturating PAGE on a DNA sequencer respectively are also compared. To be able to target microRNAs also at stages where these are in a double stranded or hairpin form we have looked at BisPNA designed to clamp the target and give sufficient affinity to allow for strand invasion. We show that BisPNA complexes are more stable with RNA than with DNA. In addition, 24 -mer BisPNA (AntimiR) constructs form complexes with a hairpin RNA that is a model of the microRNA miR- 376 b, suggesting that PNA-clamping may be an effective way of targeting microRNAs...|$|E

To achieve that goal, we present a study of the Young's modulus E of electroplated nickel used in the LIGA technique. This mechanical parameter was obtained by the analysis of vibration frequencies of free-clamped microcantilevers. The resonant frequencies of in-plane and out-of-plane flexural modes were measured with an optical bench. The experimental results are compared to the frequencies derived from a pure elastic finite element model. The variation of the boundary conditions, in particular the description of <b>the</b> <b>clamped</b> <b>part</b> of <b>the</b> devices, leads to a good agreement between the experimental and the simulation. The correlation between these two methods leads to the determination of the Young's modulus of the device.

40|$|Force-measuring clamps {{have been}} invented to {{facilitate}} and simplify {{the task of}} measuring the forces or pressures applied to <b>clamped</b> <b>parts.</b> There is a critical need to measure clamping forces or pressures in some applications for example, while bonding sensors to substrates or while clamping any sensitive or delicate parts. Many manufacturers of adhesives and sensors recommend clamping at specific pressures while bonding sensors or during adhesive bonding between parts in general. In {{the absence of a}} force-measuring clamp, measurement of clamping force can be cumbersome at best because of the need for additional load sensors and load-indicating equipment. One prior method of measuring <b>clamping</b> force involved <b>the</b> use of load washers or miniature load cells in combination with external power sources and load-indicating equipment. Calibrated spring clamps have also been used. Load washers and miniature load cells constitute additional <b>clamped</b> <b>parts</b> in load paths and can add to the destabilizing effects of loading mechanisms. Spring clamps can lose calibration quickly through weakening of the springs and are limited to the maximum forces that the springs can apply. The basic principle of a force-measuring clamp can be implemented on a clamp of almost any size and can enable measurement of a force of almost any magnitude. No external equipment is needed because the component(s) for transducing <b>the</b> <b>clamping</b> force and <b>the</b> circuitry for supplying power, conditioning the output of the transducers, and displaying the measurement value are all housed on <b>the</b> <b>clamp.</b> In other words, a force-measuring clamp is a complete force-application and force-measurement system all in one package.

40|$|This study aims at {{analyzing}} the phenomena which characterize threaded connections. This type of joint {{has been known}} for thousands years (one of the first applications is attributable to Archimedes) allows transforming a torque into an axial force, typically used to lock two or more components thanks to the friction forces that arise between the connected bodies. One of the main strengths of this type of coupling is the possibility to assemble and disassemble the assembled parts; in addition, it can be applicable to almost any type of material. However, the joint system is characterized by a low efficiency: only a modest amount of the tightening torque is actually converted into axial force. In addition, the obtained axial force is typically affected by a large scatter. This behavior is due to the combined effect of two different friction effects that arise between the under-head of the screw (or nut) and the surface of the elements to be locked in the first case, and between the screw threads and female screw in the second one. The relationship between tightening torque and preload axial force is very sensitive to the effect of the various friction coefficients that rule the tribological behavior of the joint:, these coefficients have a significant variability due to the processes used to manufacture the components, and to the different tightening parameters, such as the presence of lubrication or the tightening speed. Threaded connections do have a wide array of applications, both in the field of civil engineering and in mechanics. For instance, in the automotive compartment, due to a steadily growing strive towards weight reduction and increased automation of assembly procedures, an accurate knowledge of the performance of threaded connections has recently become critical in order to achieve the safety of the junction at an adequate production cost. In order to control a threaded connection, it is necessary to focus on the three main factors that characterize its behavior: the coefficients of friction at tightening, the self-relaxation phenomenon (decrease of axial preload in the first few seconds after tightening, due to sinking of the load bearing area in <b>the</b> <b>clamped</b> <b>parts),</b> self-loosening (loss of axial preload, typically due to the action of external shearing forces). In the following, literature review will be presented first, then it will be shown an experimental investigation on the effect of solid lubrication on the friction coefficients, carried out for repeated tightenings and different surface treatments. Moreover, the effect of the number of engaged threads on the performance of an anaerobic threadlocking adhesive will be examined. The need for these analyses arose from the study of an in-field failure occurred in a pinion shaft of a transmission for earth moving machines, which, as it will be shown in the following, probably failed due to a combination of the aforementioned typical issues of threaded components. The research has the aim of increasing the knowledge about the effect of lubrication on the different phenomena that contribute to determining the performance of a bolted connection...|$|R

It is an instrument consisting of two rulers of equal length joined by a hinge. A number of scales are inscribed upon the instrument which facilitate various mathematical calculations. It was used for solving problems in proportion, trigonometry, multiplication and division, and for various functions, such as squares and cube roots. Its several scales permitted easy and direct solutions of problems in gunnery, surveying and navigation. The sector derives its name from the fourth proposition of the sixth book of Euclid, where it is demonstrated that similar triangles have their like sides proportional. It has four parts, two legs with a pivot (the articulation), a quadrant and a <b>clamp</b> (<b>the</b> curved <b>part</b> at the end of the leg) that enables the compass to function as a gunner's quadrant.|$|R
5000|$|Sliding clamps {{are loaded}} onto their {{associated}} DNA template strands by specialized proteins known as [...] "sliding clamp loaders", which also disassemble <b>the</b> <b>clamps</b> after replication has completed. The binding {{sites for the}}se initiator proteins overlap with the binding sites for the DNA polymerase, so <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> cannot simultaneously associate with a clamp loader and with a polymerase. Thus <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> will not be actively disassembled while the polymerase remains bound. DNA clamps also associate with other factors involved in DNA and genome homeostasis, such as nucleosome assembly factors, Okazaki fragment ligases, and DNA repair proteins. All of these proteins also share a binding site on <b>the</b> DNA <b>clamp</b> that overlaps with <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> loader site, ensuring that <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> will not be removed while any enzyme is still working on the DNA. The activity of <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> loader requires ATP hydrolysis to [...] "close" [...] <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> around <b>the</b> DNA.|$|R
40|$|Clamp loaders are pentameric ATPases of the AAA+ {{family that}} operate to ensure processive DNA replication. They {{do so by}} loading onto DNA <b>the</b> ringshaped sliding <b>clamps</b> that tether <b>the</b> {{polymerase}} to the DNA. Structural and biochemical analysis of clamp loaders has shown how, despite differences in composition across different branches of life, all <b>clamp</b> loaders undergo <b>the</b> same concerted conformational transformations, which generate a binding surface for <b>the</b> open <b>clamp</b> and an internal spiral chamber into which the DNA at the replication fork can slide, triggering ATP hydrolysis, release of <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> loader, and closure of <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> round <b>the</b> DNA. We review here the current understanding of <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> loader mechanism and discuss the implications of <b>the</b> differences between <b>clamp</b> loaders from <b>the</b> different branches of life. High-speed replication of chromosomal DNA requires the DNA polymerase to be attached to a sliding clamp (known as proliferating cell nuclear antigen, or PCNA, in eukaryotes) that prevents the polymerase from falling off DNA [1, 2]. In all cells and in some viruses, <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> is a ring-shaped protein complex that encircles DNA, forming a sliding platform on which DNA polymerases and other proteins that move along DNA are assembled. Sliding <b>clamps</b> play a <b>part</b> in DNA replication, DNA repair, cell cycle control and modification of chromatin structure [3, 4], and defects in several clamp-associated factors are associated with cancer and other disorders caused by abnormalities in DNA replication and repair [5]. Because sliding clamps encircle DNA but do not interact tightly with it, they can slide along the doubl...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of the work: {{determination}} of the dependence of the advance on the rock strength of <b>the</b> <b>clamping</b> medium for defining the rational thickness of the section being broken in <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> to enhance <b>the</b> effectiveness of ore breaking in <b>the</b> <b>clamp.</b> <b>The</b> work etsablishes the dependence of the advance on the rock strength of <b>the</b> <b>clamping</b> medium {{with regard to the}} specific expenditure of explosives for breakage and other governing factors. Developed is a methodology for calculating the rational thickness of the section being broken in <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> at different strength of <b>the</b> <b>clamping</b> medium rock and specific expenditure of explosives for breakage with regard to the width of <b>the</b> breakage space, <b>clamping</b> material loosening coefficient and other factors.

40|$|Abstract. <b>The</b> <b>clamp</b> band {{system is}} a typical locked and {{separated}} device of the launch vehicle (LV) / the spacecraft (SC), and its release-separation process {{is one of the}} important factors that affect the LV/SC separation movement. A nonlinear spring-damper model was employed to describe the contact-impact behavior between the V-segment of <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> band and <b>the</b> LV/SC interface, and lumped mass method was used to depict <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> band. By using ADAMS, a dynamic model of <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> band system was established. The simulation results show that the impulse of the explosive bolts and the stiffness of lateral-restraining springs have significant effects on <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> band dynamic envelope. The shock of the satellite-vehicle separation is very vulnerable to <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> band pretension and the friction coefficient between the V-segment and the LV/SC interface...|$|R

50|$|While a G-clamp is {{a useful}} tool for woodworking, special care should be taken when working with any woods. The flat {{gripping}} edges of the frame, generally no larger than half an inch or a centimetre (depending on the size of <b>the</b> <b>clamp)</b> can cause indentations and marring of <b>the</b> surfaces being <b>clamped.</b> This can be avoided by buffering between <b>the</b> <b>clamp</b> and <b>the</b> timber using two pieces of scrap wood. As each piece of scrap wood is directly in contact with the flat edges of the frame and with <b>the</b> items being <b>clamped,</b> this allows <b>the</b> scrap wood to receive the damage from <b>the</b> <b>clamping,</b> while dispersing <b>the</b> <b>clamping</b> force across <b>the</b> piece of scrap wood into <b>the</b> <b>clamped</b> objects. Deep-throated clamps are also available and provide greater reach for smaller jobs.|$|R
