40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} in the free-piston shock tube and shock tunnel with dissociating nitrogen and carbon dioxide, ionizing argon and frozen argon to measure the <b>transition</b> <b>condition</b> in pseudosteady and steady flow. The <b>transition</b> <b>condition</b> in the steady flow, in which the wall was eliminated by symmetry, agrees with the calculated von Neumann condition. In the real gases this calculation assumed thermo-dynamic equilibrium after the reflected shock. In the pseudosteady flow of reflexion from a wedge the measured transition angle lies on the Mach-reflexion side of the calculated detachment condition by an amount which may be {{explained in terms of}} the displacement effect of the boundary layer on the wedge surface. A single criterion based on the availability of a length scale at the reflexion point explains the difference between the pseudosteady and steady flow <b>transition</b> <b>condition</b> and predicts a hysteresis effect in the transition angle when the shock angle is varied during steady flow. No significant effects on the <b>transition</b> <b>condition</b> due to finite relaxation length could be detected.

40|$|The {{enthalpy}} {{method for}} the thermodynamics of polythermal glaciers and ice sheets is tested and verified by a one-dimensional problem (parallel-sided slab). The enthalpy method {{alone does not}} include explicitly the <b>transition</b> <b>conditions</b> at the cold-temperate transition surface (CTS) that separates the upper cold from the lower temperate layer. However, these conditions are important for correctly determining {{the position of the}} CTS. For the numerical solution of the polythermal slab problem, we consider a two-layer front-tracking scheme as well as three di erent one-layer schemes (conventional one-layer scheme, one-layer melting CTS scheme, one-layer freezing CTS scheme). Computed steady-state temperature and water-content profiles are verified with exact solutions, and transient solutions computed by the one-layer schemes are compared with those of the two-layer scheme, considered to be a reliable reference. While the conventional one-layer scheme (that does not include the <b>transition</b> <b>conditions</b> at the CTS) can produce correct solutions for melting conditions at the CTS, it is more reliable to enforce the <b>transition</b> <b>conditions</b> explicitly. For freezing conditions, it is imperative to enforce them because the conventional one-layer scheme cannot handle the associated discontinuities.

A fuzzy inference scheme is used by the proposed location estimator to detect LOS condition, NLOS condition or LOS/NLOS <b>transition</b> <b>condition</b> and to estimate the noise covariance via fuzzy interpolation. With an accurate estimation of noise covariance, an adaptive Kalman filter is proposed for the range estimation between the base station (BS) and mobile station (MS). Therefore, the proposed mobile location estimator can efficiently mitigate the NLOS effects of the simulated measurement range error even changing condition between LOS and NLOS. Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed fuzzy LOS/NLOS smoother is improved significantly over the FCC target in both fixed LOS/NLOS and LOS/NLOS <b>transition</b> <b>condition,</b> and outplays other location estimators employing the Kalman filter and NLOS mitigation techniques...|$|E

40|$|We study a variable-coefficient {{nonlinear}} Schrödinger (vc-NLS) equation with higher-order effects. We {{show that}} the breather solution can be converted into four types of nonlinear waves on constant backgrounds including the multi-peak solitons, antidark soliton, periodic wave and W-shaped soliton. The <b>transition</b> <b>condition</b> requiring the group velocity dispersion (GVD) and third-order dispersion (TOD) to scale linearly is obtained analytically. We display several kinds of elastic interactions between the transformed nonlinear waves. We discuss the dispersion management of multi-peak soliton, which indicates that the GVD coefficient controls the number of peaks of the wave while the TOD coefficient has compression effect. The gain or loss has influence on the amplitudes of the multi-peak soliton. We further derive the breather multiple births by using multiple compression points of Akhmediev breathers in optical fiber systems with periodic dispersion. The number of ABs depends on the amplitude of the modulation but not on its wavelength, which affects their separation distance. In the limiting case, the breather multiple births reduce to the Peregrine combs. We discuss the effects of TOD coefficient on the spatiotemporal characteristics of Peregrine combs. When the amplitude of the modulation is equal to 1, the Peregrine comb is converted into a Peregrine wall {{that can be seen}} as intermediate state between rogue wave and W-shaped soliton. We finally find that the modulational stability regions with zero growth rate coincide with the <b>transition</b> <b>condition</b> using rogue wave eigenvalues. Our results could be useful for the experimental control and manipulation of the formation of generalized Peregrine rogue waves in diverse physical systems modeled by vc-NLS equation with higher-order effects...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} the {{transition}} from homogeneous to heterogeneous flow in a solid-liquid fluidized bed (SLFB) is examined both experimentally and numerically. The experimental apparatus comprised a refractive index-matched SLFB, comprising 5 mm diameter borosilicate glass and sodium iodine solution, which allowed for both instantaneous particle image velocimetry of the liquid flow field and solids hold-up measurements to be undertaken for superficial liquid velocities {{in the range of}} 0. 06 - 0. 22 m/s. The motion of individual, spherical steel balls (with diameters 6, 7, 8, 9 mm) was then tracked as it settled through the fluidized bed for differing superficial liquid velocities. It was observed that, for all the steel balls covered in this work, there was a change in slope in their respective classification velocity curves at a superficial liquid velocity of 0. 08 m/s. This value was very close to the critical velocity of 0. 085 m/s predicted from 1 -D linear stability analysis; and therefore deemed to be the critical condition that marked {{the transition from}} homogeneous to non-homogenous flow. It is proposed that the change in slope of the classification velocity curve is due to the encounter of the settling foreign particles with liquid bubbles whose presence marks the onset of heterogeneous flow. Additional computational analysis, involving both Eulerian-Eulerian (E-E) and Eulerian-Lagrangian (E-L) approaches, is used to confirm the presence of liquid bubbles at a critical liquid hold-up of 0. 54, which corresponds to that predicted from 1 -D linear stability analysis. In summary, the study has highlighted that experimentally the <b>transition</b> <b>condition</b> for a SLFB can be obtained simply by observing the behavior of the classification velocity of a single foreign particle at different superficial liquid velocities. This <b>transition</b> <b>condition</b> was found to agree with the 1 D linear stability criterion, Eulerian-Eulerian CFD (3 D) and Eulerian-Lagrangian DEM (3 D) approaches...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Fine Arts, Dept. of Music EducationTimes of {{transition}} can be challenging, {{no matter the}} age. It is important {{at a young age}} that children learn how to cope with smaller transitions so that they may learn strategies to handle larger situations later in life. In an early childhood setting, transitions can take up a substantial part of the day. Often during transitions, teachers will model the expected behavior for their students, however, for children with visual impairments, additional supports are needed. This study compared the effects of spoken versus music transitions in an inclusive classroom for children with visual impairments. The participants (n= 17) aged three to five years old were students enrolled in an inclusive early childhood classroom for students with visual impairments. Three of the students were diagnosed with visual impairments. The researcher was interested in learning if spoken or musical directives during transitions affected two variables: the duration of the transition and the number of inappropriate behaviors during transition. The researcher identified five distinct transitions during a 25 -minute music class: (1) Entrance, (2) Choosing an Instrument, (3) Putting Instrument Away, (4) Moving to Open Floor for Movement Activity, and (5) Lining Up to Exit. For four of the five transitions, the music condition averaged a shorter transition duration than the spoken condition. Similarly, the average transition duration had a decreasing trend as the transitions were later in class. There {{did not appear to be}} a change in the number of inappropriate transitions between the two conditions. The spoken <b>transition</b> <b>condition</b> had a total of nine inappropriate transitions and the musical <b>transition</b> <b>condition</b> had a total of eight inappropriate transitions.

The technique is based on the coupling of the stochastic microstructure to a tentative homogenized medium, the parameters of which are initially chosen at will. Based on the results of the coupled simulation, for which Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions are posed at the boundary of the tentative homogenized medium, the parameters of the homogenized medium are then iteratively updated.
