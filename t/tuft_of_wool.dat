The Roman mythographer Hyginus records a similar story in which Hephaestus demanded Zeus to let him marry Athena since {{he was the one who}} had smashed open Zeus's skull, allowing Athena to be born.

However, he was back again in a few moments, having tucked under his chin the end of a <b>tuft</b> <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> (probably left on the thorn by a wandering sheep), which made a magnificent beard, that reached nearly down to his feet.|$|E
60|$|I wished good-night {{to these}} two and left the café for the fresh air and the dark {{spaciousness}} of the quays augmented by all {{the width of the}} old Port where between the trails of light the shadows of heavy hulls appeared very black, merging their outlines in a great confusion. I left behind me the end of the Cannebière, a wide vista of tall houses and much-lighted pavements losing itself in the distance with an extinction of both shapes and lights. I slunk past it with only a side glance and sought the dimness of quiet streets away from the centre of the usual night gaieties of the town. The dress I wore was just that of a sailor come ashore from some coaster, a thick blue woollen shirt or rather a sort of jumper with a knitted cap like a tam-o’-shanter worn very much on one side and with a red <b>tuft</b> <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> in the centre. This was even the reason why I had lingered so long in the café. I didn’t want to be recognized in the streets in that costume and still less to be seen entering the house in the street of the Consuls. At that hour when the performances were over and all the sensible citizens in their beds I didn’t hesitate to cross the Place of the Opera. It was dark, the audience had already dispersed. The rare passers-by I met hurrying on their last affairs of the day paid no attention to me at all. The street of the Consuls I expected to find empty, as usual at that time of the night. But as I turned a corner into it I overtook three people who must have belonged to the locality. To me, somehow, they appeared strange. Two girls in dark cloaks walked ahead of a tall man in a top hat. I slowed down, not wishing to pass them by, the more so that the door of the house was only a few yards distant. But to my intense surprise those people stopped at it and the man in the top hat, producing a latchkey, let his two companions through, followed them, and with a heavy slam cut himself off from my astonished self and the rest of mankind.|$|E

60|$|I have {{frequently}} observed newly-born lambs on the pampas, {{and have never}} failed to {{be surprised at the}} extreme imbecility they display in their actions; although this may be due partly to inherited degeneracy caused by domestication. This imbecile condition continues for two, sometimes for three days, during which time the lamb apparently acts purely from instincts, which are far from perfect; but after that, experience and its dam teach it a better way. When born its first impulse is to struggle up on to its feet; its second to suck, but here it does not discriminate like the newly-hatched bird that picks up its proper food, or it does not know what to suck. It will take into its mouth whatever comes near, in most cases a <b>tuft</b> <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> on its dam's neck; and at this it will continue sucking for an indefinite time. It is highly probable that the strong-smelling secretion of the sheep's udder attracts the lamb at length to that part; and that without something of the kind to guide it, in many cases it would actually starve without finding the teats. I have often seen lambs many hours after birth still confining their attention to the most accessible locks of wool on the neck or fore legs of the dams, and believe that in such cases the long time it took them to find the source of nourishment arose from a defective sense of smell. Its next important instinct, which comes into play from the moment it can stand on its feet, impels it to follow after any object receding from it, and, on the other hand, to run from anything approaching it. If the dam turns round and approaches it from even a very short distance, it will start back and run from her in fear, and will not understand her voice when she bleats to it: {{at the same time it}} will confidently follow after a man, dog, horse, or any other animal moving from it. A very common experience on the pampas, in the sheep-country, is to see a lamb start up from sleep and follow the rider, running along close to the heels of the horse. This is distressing to a merciful man, tor he cannot shake the little simpleton off, and if he rides on, no matter how fast, it will keep up him, or keep him in sight, for half a mile or a mile, and never recover its dam. The gaucho, who is not merciful, frequently saves himself all trouble and delay by knocking it senseless with a blow of his whip-handle, and without checking his horse. I have seen a lamb, about two days old, start up from sleep, and immediately start off in pursuit of a puff ball about as big as a man's head, carried past it over the smooth turf by the wind, and chase it for a distance of five hundred yards, until the dry ball was brought to a stop by a tuft of coarse grass. This blundering instiuct is quickly laid aside when the lamb has learned to distinguish its dam from other objects, and its dam's voice from other sounds. When four or five days old it will start from sleep, but instead of rushing blindly away after any receding object, it first looks about it, and will then recognize and run to its dam.|$|E

50|$|Annual hiring fairs were held, during Martinmas {{week at the}} end of November, in {{the market}} towns of the East Riding of Yorkshire in places like Beverley, Bridlington, Driffield, Hedon, Hornsea, Howden, Hull, Malton, Patrington, Pocklington, and York. Both male and female {{agricultural}} servants would gather in order to bargain with prospective employers and, hopefully, secure a position for the coming year. The yearly hiring included board and lodging for single employees for the whole year with wages being paid {{at the end of}} the year's service. These fairs attracted all the other trappings of a fair, and they turned into major feasts in their own right, and attracted poor reputations for the drunkenness and immorality involved. Later, when wage rates and conditions were no longer officially set, the hiring fair remained a useful institution, especially as much employment in rural areas was by annual agreement. Prospective workers would gather in the street or market place, often sporting some sort of badge or tool to denote their speciality.

60|$|How absurdly {{easy it is}} for {{a legend}} to arise in a lonely countryside! I {{examined}} him as to the reasons for his weird belief. It seems that from time to time sheep have been missing from the fields, carried bodily away, according to Armitage. That they could have wandered away of their own accord and disappeared among the mountains was an explanation to which he would not listen. On one occasion a pool of blood had been found, and some <b>tufts</b> <b>of</b> <b>wool.</b> That also, I pointed out, could be explained in a perfectly natural way. Further, the nights upon which sheep disappeared were invariably very dark, cloudy nights with no moon. This I met with the obvious retort that those were the nights which a commonplace sheep-stealer would naturally choose for his work. On one occasion a gap had been made in a wall, and some of the stones scattered for a considerable distance. Human agency again, in my opinion. Finally, Armitage clinched all his arguments by telling me that he had actually heard the Creature--indeed, that anyone could hear it who remained long enough at the Gap. It was a distant roaring of an immense volume. I could not but smile at this, knowing, as I do, the strange reverberations which come out of an underground water system running amid the chasms of a limestone formation. My incredulity annoyed Armitage so that he turned and left me with some abruptness.|$|R

A fetid breath seemed to ooze from the black depths into which I peered. Could it indeed be possible that some nameless thing, some dreadful presence, was lurking down yonder?

60|$|Ulysse, {{being used}} to Irish-English, had little {{understanding}} of Yusuf's broad Scotch; but he was looking anxiously {{from one to the}} other of the speakers, and when Arthur explained to him that the disguise, together with perfect silence, was the only hope of not being left behind among the Moors, and the best chance of getting back to his home and dear ones again, he perfectly understood. As to the blackening, for which Yusuf had prepared a mixture to be laid on with a feather, it was perfectly enchanting to faire la comedie. He laughed so much that he had to be peremptorily hushed, and they were sensible of the danger that in case of a search he might betray himself to his Moorish friends; and Arthur tried to make him comprehend the extreme danger, making him cry so that his cheeks had to be touched up. His eyes and hair were dark, and the latter was cut to its shortest by Yusuf, who further managed to fasten some <b>tufts</b> <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> dipped in the black unguent to the kerchief that bound his head. The childish features had something of the Irish cast, which lent itself to the transformation, and in the scanty garments of the little negro Arthur owned that he should never have known the small French gentleman.

5000|$|Birds vary {{enormously}} in {{the nests}} they make and the materials they use. Among those that use fibres and fibrous {{materials such as}} grass for nesting, many tend to weave the nests, but even nests that initially are purely woven, {{such as those of}} weaver birds, later are lined with downy materials that largely become felted, both {{with each other and with}} the surrounding nest material. Similarly birds such as sparrows, that build large, twiggy nests, line them with downy material. Many kinds of birds however do little weaving in building their nests, but instead construct their nests mainly of fibrous and downy materials such as fine wool, moss, lichen, spiders' nests, <b>tufts</b> <b>of</b> cotton, arachnoid fluff from plants, or bark scales, supported by twigs or the walls of burrows and the like, depending on the circumstances within which they nest. James Rennie remarked: [...] "A circumstance also never neglected, is to bind the nest firmly into the forks of the bush where it is placed, by twining bands of moss, felted with wool, round all the contiguous branches, both below and at the sides. During the nesting season such birds commonly become such avid seekers of suitable materials that down feathers or <b>tufts</b> <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> may be used as bait for trapping them. Birds that concentrate heavily on felted nests include goldfinches (Carduelis species) and related species. Hummingbirds tend to use a lot of spiderweb together with moss and similar material. Small warbler-like birds of many genera such as Prinia and Cisticola make their nests either heavily lined with, or entirely of felted material. Ground nesting birds often use felted material rather than woven; it usually suffices and some of the structures can be deceptively sophisticated. For example, the common eider, famous for the valuable down harvested from its abandoned nests, lays its eggs in very lightly felted bowls of its own down; simple though this seems, the thick, soft layer provides exceptional insulation.|$|R
50|$|Alexander Buchanan, a foreman in a Paisley fabric mill, is {{credited}} with introducing chenille fabric to Scotland in the 1830s.

They were treated by heating rollers {{in order to create}} the frizz. This resulted in a very soft, fuzzy fabric named chenille. Another Paisley shawl manufacturer went on to further develop the technique. James Templeton and William Quigley worked to refine this process while working on imitation oriental rugs. The intricate patterns used to be difficult to reproduce by automation, but this technique solved that issue. These men patented the process but Quigley soon sold out his interest. Templeton then went on to open a successful carpet company that became a leading manufacturer throughout the 19th and 20th centuries.|$|R
40|$|These {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to investigate the possible role of {{certain aspects of the}} on-host ecology and off-host survival of the sheep scab mite, Psoroptes ovis, in the dissemination of infestation. All developmental stages of the mite occurred in the fleece both proximally or distal to the skin of infested Merino and Dorper sheep. A larger proportion of mites was present in the fleece of Dorper sheep distal to the skin in the late afternoon and early morning than at other times during the day. Immature and adult mites readily transferred to <b>tufts</b> <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> or hair placed on infested sheep of both breeds. No mites could be found on wool or hair rubbed off onto tree trunks or branches or other structures in enclosures housing heavily infested sheep, nor could any mites be collected from the soil of these enclosures, whereas more than 80 % of mites artificially seeded onto soil samples were recovered. The longest mean off-host survival times for larvae, nymphs, and male and ovigerous female mites were recorded at 10 ºC, and were 9. 25 days (RH= 90 %), 15 days (RH= 33 % and 75 %), 10. 5 days (RH= 75 % and 90 %) and 11. 25 days (RH= 90 %) respectively. Under natural climatic conditions ovigerous females in glass vials containing Merino wool survived for 17 days compared to 15 days for females in vials without wool; this difference was, however, not significant. The mean off-host pre-hatch period for eggs varied between 5. 9 days (T= 25 ºC and RH= 33 %) and 22. 1 days (T= 10 ºC and RH= 75 %), while the longest time individual eggs took to hatch at the latter temperature and RH was 31 days.

40|$|In {{the past}} decades the global {{population}} {{has becoming increasingly}} dependent on aquaculture due to over-fishing of oceans and rivers. Consequently, fish farming has become the fastest growing food sector in the world. Increased production intensity constituting intensive culturing of fish coupled with the ban {{in the use of}} malachite green, an effective remedy against Saprolegnia infections, accounts for the dramatic re-emergence of Saprolegnia infections in aquaculture which fish farmers are struggling to control. This precarious situation inevitably created a sense of urgency for researchers to explore the possibility of developing novel and sustainable treatments to control this devastating pathogen of fish. Saprolegnia infection in fish is characterized by white or grey patches of filamentous mycelia on the host. The infection initially appears on epidermal tissues of the head, tail and fins and subsequently spreads {{to the rest of the}} body. Lesion areas may be soft, necrotic and ulcerated and the surrounding areas may show oedema and necrosis. Fish eggs infected with Saprolegnia species appear like <b>tufts</b> <b>of</b> cotton <b>wool,</b> as the Saprolegnia hyphae form a white cotton wool or felt-like mat on the surfaces of the eggs...|$|R
60|$|Worms seize {{leaves and}} other objects, {{not only to}} serve as food, but for {{plugging}} up the mouths of their burrows; {{and this is one}} of their strongest instincts. They sometimes work so energetically that Mr. D. F. Simpson, who has a small walled garden where worms abound in Bayswater, informs me that on a calm damp evening he there heard so extraordinary a rustling noise from under a tree from which many leaves had fallen, that he went out with a light and discovered that the noise was caused by many worms dragging the dry leaves and squeezing them into the burrows. Not only leaves, but petioles of many kinds, some flower-peduncles, often decayed twigs of trees, bits <b>of</b> paper, feathers, <b>tufts</b> <b>of</b> <b>wool</b> and horse- hairs are dragged into their burrows for this purpose. I have seen as many as seventeen petioles of a Clematis projecting from the mouth of one burrow, and ten from the mouth of another. Some of these objects, such as the petioles just named, feathers, &c., are never gnawed by worms. In a gravel-walk in my garden I found many hundred leaves of a pine-tree (P. austriaca or nigricans) drawn by their bases into burrows. The surfaces by which these leaves are articulated to the branches are shaped in as peculiar a manner as is the joint between the leg-bones of a quadruped; and if these surfaces had been in the least gnawed, the fact would have been immediately visible, but there was no trace of gnawing. Of ordinary dicotyledonous leaves, all those which are dragged into burrows are not gnawed. I have seen as many as nine leaves of the lime-tree drawn into the same burrow, and not nearly all of them had been gnawed; but such leaves may serve as a store for future consumption. Where fallen leaves are abundant, many more are sometimes collected over the mouth of a burrow than can be used, so that a small pile of unused leaves is left like a roof over those which have been partly dragged in.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} was planned to {{investigate}} the effect of Saprolegnia parasitica infection in the hematological, serum biochemical and pathological alterations of Tilapia nilotica. Forty five fish were divided into three equal groups. Fish of first group served as a control. Fish of groups (2 & 3) were infected by Saprolegnia parasitica. Fish of group (3) were treated after 7 days of post-infection using potassium permanganate for 10 days. Sampling was done after 1 and 7 days of post-infection (gps 1 & 2) and 10 days of post-treatment (gps 1 & 3). The results revealed a non {{significant changes in the}} hematological and the biochemical parameters after 1 day of infection, but after 7 days of post- infection and 10 days of post-treatment, a significant decrease in RBCs, Hb, PCV and significant increase in AST, ALT, urea, creatinine, sodium, potassium, cortisol, insulin and glucose were seen. Iron showed a significant decrease at the same period of sampling. The pathological examination revealed a massive fungal growth resembling a <b>tuft</b> <b>of</b> cotton <b>wool</b> threads was seen in eyes, gills, fins and in localized areas of the skin. Microscopically, the fungal hyphae and spores appeared on eyes, gills, skin and underlying muscles with marked degenerative, necrotic and inflammatory reactions. These reactions were evident, after 7 days of post- infection and the severity of the lesions were markedly decreased after 10 days of post-treatment. It could be concluded that, saprolegnia parasitica infections induced marked tissue alterations as well as some hematological and serum biochemica...|$|R
60|$|While deliberating in {{distressing}} incertitude, now shrinking {{with the}} timidity of her sex and {{years from the}} enterprise, and now resolving to rescue her brother at every hazard, Frances turned her looks towards the east, in earnest gaze at the clouds which constantly threatened to involve her again in comparative darkness. Had an adder stung her, {{she could not have}} sprung with greater celerity than she recoiled from the object against which she was leaning, and which she for the first time noticed. The two upright posts, with a crossbeam on their tops, and a rude platform beneath, told but too plainly the nature of the structure; even the cord was suspended from an iron staple, and was swinging to and fro, in the night air. Frances hesitated no longer, but rather flew than ran across the meadow, and was soon {{at the base of the}} rock, where she hoped to find something like a path to the summit of the mountain. Here she was compelled to pause for breath, and she improved the leisure by surveying the ground about her. The ascent was quite abrupt, but she soon found a sheep path that wound among the shelving rocks and through the trees, so as to render her labor much less tiresome than it otherwise would have been. Throwing a fearful glance behind, the determined girl commenced her journey upwards. Young, active, and impelled by her generous motive, she moved up the hill with elastic steps, and very soon emerged from the cover of the woods, into an open space of more level ground, that had evidently been cleared of its timber, for the purpose of cultivation. But either the war or the sterility of the soil had compelled the adventurer to abandon the advantages that he had obtained over the wilderness, and already the bushes and briers were springing up afresh, as if the plow had never traced furrows through the mold which nourished them. Frances felt her spirits invigorated by these faint vestiges of the labor of man, and she walked up the gentle acclivity with renewed hopes of success. The path now diverged in so many different directions, that she soon saw it would be useless to follow their windings, and abandoning it, at the first turn, she labored forward towards what she thought was the nearest point of the summit. The cleared ground was soon past, and woods and rocks, clinging to the precipitous sides of the mountain, again opposed themselves to her progress. Occasionally, the path was to be seen running along the verge of the clearing, and then striking off into the scattering patches of grass and herbage, but in no instance could she trace it upward. <b>Tufts</b> <b>of</b> <b>wool,</b> hanging to the briers, sufficiently denoted the origin of these tracks, and Frances rightly conjectured that whoever descended the mountain, would avail himself of their existence, to lighten the labor. Seating herself on a stone, the wearied girl again paused to rest and to reflect; the clouds were rising before the moon, and the whole scene at her feet lay pictured in softest colors.|$|R
