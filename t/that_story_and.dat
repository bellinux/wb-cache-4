5|$|Balzac {{had written}} more than seventy novels {{when he began}} La Cousine Bette, and {{populated}} them with recurring characters. Many {{of the characters in}} the novel, therefore, appear with extensive back-stories and biographical depth. For example, Célestin Crevel first appeared in Balzac's 1837 novel César Birotteau, working for the title character. Having accumulated a considerable fortune in that book, Crevel spends his time in La Cousine Bette enjoying the spoils of his labor. Another important recurring character is Marshal Hulot, who first appeared as a colonel in Les Chouans. In the years between <b>that</b> <b>story</b> <b>and</b> La Cousine Bette, he became the Count of Forzheim; {{in a letter to the}} Constitutionnel, Balzac described how Marshal Hulot gained this title. The presence of Crevel and Marshal Hulot– among others– in La Cousine Bette allows a continuation of each character's life story, adding emphasis or complexity to earlier events.|$|E
25|$|Although Dostoyevsky {{began his}} first notes for The Brothers Karamazov in April 1878, {{he had written}} several {{unfinished}} works years earlier. He would incorporate some elements into his future work, particularly from the planned epos The Life of a Great Sinner, which he began work on {{in the summer of}} 1869. It eventually remained unfinished after Dostoyevsky was interested in the Nechayev affair, which involved a group of radicals murdering one of their former members. He picked up <b>that</b> <b>story</b> <b>and</b> started with Demons. The unfinished Drama in Tobolsk (Драма. В Тобольске) is considered the first draft of the first chapter of The Brothers Karamazov. Dated 13 September 1874, it tells about a fictional murder in Staraya Russa committed by a praporshchik named Dmitry Ilynskov (based on a real soldier from Omsk), who is thought to have murdered his father. It goes on noting that his body was suddenly discovered in a pit under a house. The similarly unfinished Sorokoviny (Сороковины), dated 1 August 1875, is reflected in book IX, chapter 3–5 and book XI, chapter nine.|$|E
25|$|Beside being a V6 member, Okada is an {{accomplished}} actor with eleven movies, in eight {{of which he}} plays the lead, and sixteen dramas, in four of which he plays the lead. In a Shōnen Club Premium interview on May 7, 2009, he revealed {{that it was the}} Japanese drama Kisarazu Cat's Eye that caught the attention of viewers and directors, and made them aware of his acting ability. The success of the drama led to the making of two movie sequels, Kisarazu Cat's Eye: Nihon Series and Kisarazu Cat's Eye: World Series. His other notable dramas include Tiger & Dragon, a comedy drama about rakugo, a form of Japanese comedy acted only by one person telling <b>that</b> <b>story.</b> <b>and</b> SP (also known as Security Police), an action suspense drama about a team of security police bodyguards in charge of protecting important people in the government. With Shinichi Tsutsumi as his co-star, the drama drew in overall ratings of 15.35% despite its Saturday 11:00 p.m. (JST) time slot; its special episode broadcast in 2008 also received a viewership rating of 21.5%.|$|E

On April 29, he relieved Grant of field command and replaced him with Major General George Henry Thomas. Halleck slowly marched his army to take Corinth, entrenching each night. Meanwhile, Beauregard {{pretended to be}} reinforcing, sent [...] "deserters" [...] to the Union Army with <b>that</b> <b>story,</b> <b>and</b> moved his army out during the night, to Halleck's surprise when he finally arrived at Corinth on May 30.

500|$|Well, I didn’t {{know how}} long the comic book series was going to last. I hoped that it would become a success and survive for years and years. But {{at that time in}} my career, it was very early, I had had a lot of books canceled, just because of poor sales. So early on in the book I would move past storylines very quickly. I set up this love {{triangle}} and I resolved <b>that</b> <b>story</b> <b>and</b> moved along within the first [...] issues. But there's a lot of story potential to mine there. One {{of the things that the}} TV show is able to do is to look at the comic book series with hindsight and go, 'This would probably be something that we could explore more.' And that's what we're going to be doing. So we'll be seeing a lot more of the Lori-Shane-Rick love triangle.|$|E
500|$|Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, Kirk Honeycutt called Speed Racers {{visual effects}} [...] "stellar", but stated it [...] "proudly denies entry into its ultra-bright world {{to all but}} gamers, fanboys and anime enthusiasts". He criticized <b>that</b> <b>story</b> <b>and</b> {{character}} were [...] "tossed aside" [...] towards the [...] "wearying" [...] races. Todd McCarthy of Variety noted the target audience should be amused, but others might think the film [...] "a cinematic pile-up", citing its implausibility {{and the lack of}} identifiable peril in the driving sequences. While noted viewers interested in CGI would appreciate it, McCarthy said the frame sometimes resembled [...] "a kindergartner's art class collage". He had praise for the cinematography, the musical score, and the cast. Anime News Network's Zac Bertschy also praised the cast, while saying the story is [...] "as anyone would expect", adding [...] "the characters are all cardboard archetypes with Saturday Morning dialogue." [...] Speed Racer [...] "sets out to honor and refresh a youthful enthusiasm from the past and winds up smothering the fun in self-conscious grandiosity", declared The New York Times A. O. Scott.|$|E

This was disputed by Boston's Anglican minister Robert Ratcliff, who claimed that <b>that</b> <b>story</b> <b>and</b> others had [...] "not the least foundation of Truth", {{and that they were}} [...] "falsehoods, and lies" [...] propagated to [...] "render the Governour odious to his people". [...] Andros did make a successful escape from Castle Island on August2 after his servant bribed the sentries with liquor. [...] He managed to flee to Rhode Island but was recaptured soon thereafter and kept in what was virtually solitary confinement. [...] He and others arrested {{in the wake of the}} revolt were held for 10 months before being sent to England for trial. [...] Massachusetts agents in London refused to sign the documents listing the charges against Andros, so he was summarily acquitted and released.

When Andros was questioned about the various accusations that had been levelled against him, he pointed out that all of his actions had been taken to bring colonial laws into conformance with English law, or they were specifically taken in pursuit of his commission and instructions.|$|E
500|$|Derrickson and Marvel had {{originally}} discussed him writing the film alongside his Sinister co-writer C. Robert Cargill, with Derrickson also directing, but Marvel {{felt that they}} would not be able to reach their intended release date of July 2016 if Derrickson filled both roles. When Derrickson was chosen as director, Marvel passed on Cargill as an individual writer, with Jon Spaihts hired to rewrite the script instead. Spaihts, a big fan of Doctor Strange as a child, had started [...] "pestering" [...] Marvel as soon as he read reports of the company searching for a director for the film. This eventually led to him meeting with the studio, before they actually began looking for writers for the film. Spaihts said that they talked [...] "all afternoon, and the fit was right", but he received a call from Marvel several days later saying that they were not completely sure they wanted to take the film in the same direction as Spaihts, and were going to look at other writers. Spaihts told his agent to not [...] "take that answer. Call them back, tell them there’s a lot of right answers, and get me back in the room", and after talking with Marvel for [...] "another three or four hours" [...] he was given the job. Marvel never seriously looked at any other writer for the film. Derrickson was already hired when Spaihts joined, and the pair spent several months working on the film's story with Feige and executive producer Stephen Broussard. They started writing the film from the beginning, and initially were unsure whether it would be an origin story, or if it would begin with Strange already as a [...] "fully-formed" [...] sorcerer. Spaihts ultimately felt that [...] "the origin story of this character, as depicted in the comics, is so operatic and beautiful, and so tragic and epic in its sweep, that it was unavoidable. We had to tell <b>that</b> <b>story,</b> <b>and</b> tell our best version of it." [...] Elements from Spaihts' early drafts that he later stated were still in the final film include many of the film's set pieces, such as the climactic battle, which came straight from Derrickson, as well as [...] "little things" [...] from Spaihts, [...] "like a bandaged hand running down a row of prayer bells in a Nepalese temple." [...] Derrickson wanted Nightmare to be the film's antagonist, along with the concept of [...] "nightmares themselves as being a dimension", but Feige felt [...] "getting across the idea of the Dream Dimension as another dimension" [...] would have been challenging alongside everything else that the film introduces. Dormammu, [...] "the most present villain in the comics", became the film's main villain.|$|E

He made his comeback at WrestleMania VIII (to rescue Hulk Hogan from a beat down {{at the hands of}} Sid Justice and Papa Shango). Upon his return, he received a degree of creative control over his bookings. One storyline involved Papa Shango, a [...] "witch doctor", casting a spell over Warrior, causing him to convulse and vomit in very odd colors, though Warrior says he hated <b>that</b> <b>story</b> <b>and</b> had no control over it. The Warrior was booked for a WWF World Heavyweight Championship match against then-champion, [...] "Macho Man" [...] Randy Savage at SummerSlam in August 1992. The Warrior won the match by countout, but not the title. In November 1992, Warrior was scheduled to team with Savage (as The Ultimate Maniacs) to face Ric Flair and Razor Ramon at Survivor Series. Weeks before the event, Warrior was released for disputed reasons and replaced by Mr. Perfect.|$|E
2500|$|Illustrator Benjamin Roman {{made his}} {{professional}} debut {{with the first}} volume of I Luv Halloween; he wanted to create [...] "something that was offbeat and a little gory, but with a kind of humor and playfulness." [...] Having spent years {{trying to get into the}} comic book industry, he moved to Los Angeles, California, in 2003, and worked at Kinko's in Hollywood; there, he met a Tokyopop employee, who passed along some of his [...] "rejected proposals" [...] to now-former editor Mark Paniccia. Keith Giffen, an American comic book illustrator and writer who had previously adapted the Tokyopop-licensed manga Battle Royale and Battle Vixens for an English-language audience, joined the project as the writer. Together, they spent three to four years working on the series. Although Roman did not draw the series with any particular influences in mind, he read Calvin and Hobbes and Marvel books as a child. Drawing inspiration from science-fiction and horror films in general, Roman acknowledged that [...] "some of that same kitsch finds itself in I Luv Halloween." [...] For the plot, Roman and Giffen were given [...] "a lot of leeway creatively," [...] and Roman commented: [...] "I think that we were seeing how irresponsible we could go with <b>that</b> <b>story</b> <b>and</b> still get away with it. We were just trying to let loose with the characters, however violent that mentality my have turned at some points." [...] As a way to celebrate the conclusion of the series, Roman gave away more than one hundred pages of I Luv Halloween artwork and five hundred replicas of Finch's mask at the 2007 San Diego Comic-Con International.|$|E
