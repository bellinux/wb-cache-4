5|$|Most {{available}} berkelium toxicity data {{originate from}} research on animals. Upon ingestion by rats, only about 0.01% berkelium {{ends in the}} blood stream. From <b>there,</b> <b>about</b> 65% goes to the bones, where it remains for about 50years, 25% to the lungs (biological half-life about 20years), 0.035% to the testicles or 0.01% to the ovaries where berkelium stays indefinitely. The balance of about 10% is excreted. In all these organs berkelium might promote cancer, and in the skeletal system its radiation can damage red blood cells. The maximum permissible amount of berkelium-249 in the human skeleton is 0.4nanograms.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{available}} einsteinium toxicity data originate from research on animals. Upon ingestion by rats, only about 0.01% einsteinium ends in the blood stream. From <b>there,</b> <b>about</b> 65% goes to the bones, where it remains for about 50 years, 25% to the lungs (biological half-life about 20 years, although this is rendered irrelevant by the short half-lives of einsteinium isotopes), 0.035% to the testicles or 0.01% to the ovaries – where einsteinium stays indefinitely. About 10% of the ingested amount is excreted. The distribution of einsteinium over the bone surfaces is uniform and {{is similar to that}} of plutonium.|$|E

5|$|In Florida, the {{depression}} produced moderate winds near the coast, peaking at 51mph (82km/h) in Naples. As in Cuba, the system dropped torrential rainfall, peaking at 25inches (635mm) at Arcadia Tower. Large {{portions of the}} state reported totals in excess of 10inches (255mm) from {{the depression}}, with much of Sarasota County receiving over 20inches (510mm) of rain. The rainfall was classified as a 100-year flood in Sarasota and Manatee counties, where flooding reached 6feet (1.8m) deep in some locations. Officials in Manatee County {{declared a state of}} emergency in response to the flooding. <b>There,</b> <b>about</b> 3,000people were forced to evacuate their homes due to the flooding, some of whom left by boat. The flooding damaged about 50houses in and around Oneco. Due to the evacuations, no injuries were reported. The reservoir in Manatee County rose to over 39feet (11.9m), 4feet (1.2m) above normal, which resulted in officials opening floodgates to prevent flooding.|$|E
5|$|In {{analyzing}} {{the creation of}} the Polish Legions, many historians have argued that Napoleon used the Poles as a source of recruits and had little desire to invest in the re-creation of the Polish state. Among the most notable of Napoleon's contemporary Polish detractors was Kościuszko, who refused to join the Legions, arguing that Napoleon would not restore Poland in any durable form. In this regard, Kościuszko also stated that the Duchy of Warsaw was created in 1807 only because it was expedient, rather than because Napoleon supported Polish sovereignty. Nevertheless, the memory of Napoleon's Polish Legions is strong in Poland, and Napoleon himself is often regarded as a hero and liberator <b>there.</b> <b>About</b> the Polish Legion, Napoleon himself is reputed to have said that 800 Poles would equal 8,000 enemy soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Judah Benjamin {{was sworn}} in as senator from Louisiana on March 4, 1853, at a brief meeting called just prior to President Pierce's inauguration. These new colleagues {{included}} Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois, Robert M. T. Hunter of Virginia, and Sam Houston of Texas. The slavery issue was in a brief remission as much of the country wished to accept the Compromise of 1850 as a final settlement. When the Senate was not in session, Benjamin remained in Washington, D.C., conducting a lucrative practice including many cases before the Supreme Court, then conveniently located in a room of the Capitol. His law partners in New Orleans took care of his firm's affairs <b>there.</b> <b>About</b> this time Benjamin sold his interest in Bellechasse, lacking the time to deal with plantation business.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{its high}} radioactivity, curium and its {{compounds}} must be handled in appropriate laboratories under special arrangements. Whereas curium itself mostly emits α-particles which are absorbed by thin layers of common materials, some of its decay products emit significant fractions of beta and gamma radiation, which require a more elaborate protection. If consumed, curium is excreted {{within a few days}} and only 0.05% is absorbed in the blood. From <b>there,</b> <b>about</b> 45% goes to the liver, 45% to the bones, and the remaining 10% is excreted. In the bone, curium accumulates {{on the inside of the}} interfaces to the bone marrow and does not significantly redistribute with time; its radiation destroys bone marrow and thus stops red blood cell creation. The biological half-life of curium is about 20 years in the liver and 50 years in the bones. Curium is absorbed in the body much more strongly via inhalation, and the allowed total dose of 244Cm in soluble form is 0.3 μC. Intravenous injection of 242Cm and 244Cm containing solutions to rats increased the incidence of bone tumor, and inhalation promoted pulmonary and liver cancer.|$|E
5|$|Oswald {{returned}} to England in 958 {{at the behest}} of his uncle, but Oda died before Oswald returned. Lacking a patron, Oswald turned to Oskytel, recently named Archbishop of York. It is possible that Oswald along with Oskytel travelled to Rome for Oskytel's pallium, but this story is only contained in a 12th-century Ramsey Abbey chronicle, so it may not be authentic. Even if he did not travel to Rome, Oswald was active in ecclesiastical affairs at York until Dunstan obtained Oswald's appointment to the see, or bishopric, of Worcester. He was consecrated as Bishop of Worcester in 961. Soon after his consecration, he persuaded Germanus to come back to England and made him head of a small religious community near Westbury-on-Trym. After the establishment of this group about 962, Oswald grew worried that because the monastery was located on lands owned by the see of Worcester, his successors in the see might disrupt the community. He was offered the site of Ramsey Abbey in Huntingdonshire by Æthelwine, son of Æthelstan Half-King, and Oswald established a monastery <b>there</b> <b>about</b> 971 that attracted most {{of the members of the}} community at Westbury. This foundation at Ramsey went on to become Ramsey Abbey. Ramsey was Oswald's most famous foundation, with its church dedicated in 974. Later, Oswald invited Abbo of Fleury to come and teach at Ramsey. Oswald directed the affairs of Ramsey Abbey until his death, when the dean Eadnoth became the first abbot. He gave a magnificent Bible to Ramsey, which was important enough to merit a mention in Oswald's Life. Alongside the gift of the book, Oswald also contributed wall hangings and other textiles to the abbey.|$|E
