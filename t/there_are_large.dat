5|$|Antarctica {{is home to}} {{more than}} 70 lakes that lie {{at the base of the}} {{continental}} ice sheet. Lake Vostok, discovered beneath Russia's Vostok Station in 1996, is the largest of these subglacial lakes. It was once believed that the lake had been sealed off for 500,000 to one million years but a recent survey suggests that, every so often, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>large</b> flows of water from one lake to another.|$|E
5|$|From the {{viewpoint}} of gross anatomy, the cerebellar cortex {{appears to be a}} homogeneous sheet of tissue, and, from {{the viewpoint}} of microanatomy, all parts of this sheet appear to have the same internal structure. There are, however, a number of respects in which the structure of the cerebellum is compartmentalized. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>large</b> compartments that are generally known as zones; these can be divided into smaller compartments known as microzones.|$|E
5|$|On three {{locations}} in Scandinavia, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>large</b> grave fields {{that were used}} by an entire community: Birka in Mälaren, Hedeby at Schleswig and Lindholm Høje at Ålborg. The graves at Lindholm Høje show a large variation in both shape and size. There are stone ships {{and there is a}} mix of graves that are triangular, quadrangular and circular. Such grave fields have been used during many generations and belong to village like settlements.|$|E

5|$|The more populous {{northern}} part of the country, comprising about 30% of the country's total area, is called the Swiss Plateau. It has greater open and hilly landscapes, partly forested, partly open pastures, usually with grazing herds, or vegetables and fruit fields, but it is still hilly. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>large</b> lakes found here and the biggest Swiss cities are in this area of the country.|$|E

5|$|There {{are plenty}} of {{opportunities}} in the county for hiking, observing wildlife and admiring the scenery. These include Brechfa Forest, the Pembrey Country Park, the Millennium Coastal Park at Llanelli, the WWT Llanelli Wetlands Centre and the Carmel National Nature Reserve. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>large</b> stretches of golden sands and the Wales Coast Path now provides a continuous walking route around the whole of Wales.|$|E
5|$|A 2011 survey {{revealed}} that 78% of Croatians claim knowledge {{of at least}} one foreign language. According to a survey ordered by the European Commission in 2005, 49% of Croatians speak English as the second language, 34% speak German, and 14% speak Italian. French and Russian are spoken by 4% each, and 2% of Croatians speak Spanish. However, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>large</b> municipalities that have minority languages that include substantial populations that speak these languages. An odd-majority of Slovenes (59%) have a certain level of knowledge of Croatian. The country is a part of various language-based international associations most notably, the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie and the European Union Language Association.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the royal}} forest of Selwood no longer exists, the nearby {{countryside}} is still richly wooded, for example on the Longleat, Maiden Bradley and Stourhead estates. To {{the west of}} the town, {{on the edge of the}} Mendip Hills, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>large</b> active limestone quarries, such as Whatley Quarry and Merehead Quarry, along with disused quarries.

Notable mosques include the East London Mosque in Tower Hamlets, London Central Mosque on the edge of Regent's Park and the Baitul Futuh Mosque of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community.

5|$|More than 600,000 {{trees were}} {{planted in the}} {{watershed}} of Stafford Meadow Brook between 1912 and 1928. In the early 2000s, the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan recommended creating a 1000-foot riparian buffer around the Stafford Meadow Brook corridor. In lacks a riparian buffer in parts of Scranton. However, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>large</b> hemlock stands along the stream above Lake Scranton. The wetlands along the stream provide an important habitat for wildlife and plant life. Beavers have also constructed ponds along some reaches of the stream. Bears have also historically been observed in the area.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} on whether to surgically decompress the pituitary gland is complex and mainly dependent on the severity of visual loss and visual field defects. If visual acuity is severely reduced, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>large</b> or worsening visual field defects, or the level of consciousness falls consistently, professional guidelines recommend that surgery is performed. Most commonly, operations on the pituitary gland are performed through transsphenoidal surgery. In this procedure, surgical instruments are passed through the nose towards the sphenoid bone, which is opened to give access to the cavity that contains the pituitary gland. Surgery is most likely to improve vision if there was some remaining vision before surgery, and if surgery is undertaken within a week of the onset of symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The male has mainly black upperparts, a white crown, {{forehead}} and supercilium. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>large</b> white patches {{on the shoulders}} and primaries, and the outermost tail feathers are also white. The throat, neck sides and underparts are white, with orange on the flanks and breast. The iris is brown, the bill is black and the legs are dark brown or black. The female is a duller version of the male, with brownish-black upperparts and a grey or buff tinge to the white shoulder patches and underparts. The juvenile has grey-brown upperparts with darker bars from the head to rump, a paler grey forehead, barred off-white underparts and brown wings with white primary patches.|$|E

5|$|There {{are eight}} circles, or roundabouts, that span and connect west Amman. Successive waves of {{immigrants}} to the city {{has led to the}} rapid construction of new neighborhoods, but Amman's capacity for new or widened roads remains limited despite the influx. This has resulted in increasing traffic jams, particularly during summer when <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>large</b> numbers of tourists and Jordanian expatriates visiting. The municipality began construction on a bus rapid transit (BRT) system as a solution in 2015. In 2015, a ring road encompassing the city was constructed, which aims to connect the northern and southern parts of the city in order for traffic to be diverted outside Amman and to improve the environmental conditions in the city.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>large</b> {{areas of}} {{agricultural}} {{land in the}} middle reaches of the watershed of Little Catawissa Creek, {{but most of the}} agricultural operations in the watershed are relatively small. The main areas of residential development in the watershed are the communities of Aristes and Ringtown. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection has issued four mining permits in the watershed of the creek. All of these permits are for mining on a ridge on the northern edge of the watershed. There {{are a number of other}} land uses in the creek's watershed. These include private forests and rural residences.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>large</b> {{deposits}} of petroleum (as {{oil and natural}} gas) in rocks beneath the seabed. Offshore platforms and drilling rigs extract the oil or gas and store it for transport to land. Offshore {{oil and gas production}} can be difficult due to the remote, harsh environment. Drilling for oil in the sea has environmental impacts. Animals may be disorientated by seismic waves used to locate deposits, probably causing the beaching of whales. Toxic substances such as mercury, lead, and arsenic may be released. The infrastructure may cause damage and oil may be spilt.|$|E
