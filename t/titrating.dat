25|$|A {{more refined}} method for {{creating}} Cheese heroin {{is done by}} taking #4 powder heroin and crushed diphenhydramine tablets, and adding them to water such that the active ingredients dissolve into the solution. The solution is then filtered via a micron filter to remove all the cuts and binders/fillers, leaving the user with a solution of high purity diamorphine HCl and diphenhydramine hcl. The water is then evaporated off, yielding a clumpy powder containing a highly purified mixture of heroin and DPH. It can also be further purified by <b>titrating</b> the solution with a weak to intermediate base such as sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide to freebase the diamorphine and DPH.|$|E

500|$|There {{are three}} protein isoforms of human Efs. hEfs1 and hEfs2 were {{identified}} by Ishino et al. hEFS1 (561 aa) represents the human counterpart of mouse embryonal Efs (mEfs1) originally identified. hEFS1 and mEfs1 are 80% identical in their amino acid sequences and 100% identical within the SH3 domain. [...] hEFS2 (468 aa) is identical to hEFS1, except for its lack of the SH3 domain. hEFS3 (392 aa) also lacks a functional SH3 domain and has the same C-terminus and short N-terminal amino acid tail as the full-length protein. Although little functional analysis of hEFS2 has been performed, speculatively, given lack of an SH3 domain, abundant hEFS2 may inhibit hEFS1 signaling by <b>titrating</b> partner proteins.

2500|$|Carefully <b>titrating</b> {{the dose}} of opioids can provide for {{effective}} pain relief while minimizing adverse effects. Morphine and diamorphine {{have been shown}} to have a wider therapeutic range or [...] "safety margin" [...] than some other opioids. Because the effective quantity varies and cannot be predicted, dose titration usually starts at low amounts, increasing until the desired or adverse effect occurs.|$|E
2500|$|Like pure µ-opioids, {{the mixed}} agonists-antagonist opioid class of drugs can cause side effects with initial {{administration}} of the drug but which lessen over time (“tolerance”). [...] This is particularly true for {{the side effects of}} nausea, sedation and cognitive symptoms (Jovey et al. 2003). [...] These side effects can in many instances be ameliorated or avoided at the time of drug initiation by <b>titrating</b> the drug from a tolerable starting dose up to the desired therapeutic dose. An important difference between nalbuphine and the pure mu opioid analgesic drugs is the “ceiling effect” on respiration. [...] Respiratory depression is a potentially fatal side effect from the use of pure mu opioids. [...] Nalbuphine has limited ability to depress respiratory function (Gal et al. 1982).|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To compare {{standard}} {{high flow}} oxygen treatment with <b>titrated</b> oxygen treatment {{for patients with}} an acute exacerbation of {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} in the prehospital setting. Design: Cluster randomised controlled parallel group trial. Setting: Ambulance service in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. Participants: 405 patients with a presumed acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who were treated by paramedics, transported, and admitted to the Royal Hobart Hospital during the trial period; 214 had a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease confirmed by lung function tests in the previous five years. Interventions: High flow oxygen treatment compared with <b>titrated</b> oxygen treatment in the prehospital (ambulance/paramedic) setting. Main outcome measure: Prehospital or in-hospital mortality. Results: In an intention to treat analysis, the risk of death was significantly lower in the <b>titrated</b> oxygen arm compared with the high flow oxygen arm for all patients (high flow oxygen n= 226; <b>titrated</b> oxygen n= 179) and for the subgroup of patients with confirmed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (high flow n= 117; <b>titrated</b> n= 97). Overall mortality was 9 % (21 deaths) in the high flow oxygen arm compared with 4 % (7 deaths) in the <b>titrated</b> oxygen arm; mortality in the subgroup with confirmed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was 9 % (11 deaths) in the high flow arm compared with 2 % (2 deaths) in the <b>titrated</b> oxygen arm. <b>Titrated</b> oxygen treatment reduced mortality compared with high flow oxygen by 58 % for all patients (relative risk 0. 42, 95 % confidence interval 0. 20 to 0. 89; P= 0. 02) and by 78 % for the patients with confirmed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (0. 22, 0. 05 to 0. 91; P= 0. 04). Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who received <b>titrated</b> oxygen according to the protocol were significantly less likely to have respiratory acidosis (mean difference in pH 0. 12 (SE 0. 05); P= 0. 01; n= 28) or hypercapnia (mean difference in arterial carbon dioxide pressure − 33. 6 (16. 3) mm Hg; P= 0. 02; n= 29) than were patients who received high flow oxygen. Conclusions: <b>Titrated</b> oxygen treatment significantly reduced mortality, hypercapnia, and respiratory acidosis compared with high flow oxygen in acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These results provide strong evidence to recommend the routine use of <b>titrated</b> oxygen treatment in patients with breathlessness and a history or clinical likelihood of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the prehospital setting...|$|R
40|$|Background—The {{supplemental}} {{oxygen flow rate}} is a common bedside measure of gas exchange impairment. We aimed {{to determine whether a}} <b>titrated</b> oxygen requirement predicted mortality in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Methods—We examined 104 adults with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis enrolled in a prospective cohort study and a validation cohort of 151 adults with a variety of interstitial lung diseases. The <b>titrated</b> oxygen requirement was defined as the lowest oxygen flow rate required to maintain an oxyhemoglobin saturation of 96 % while standing. Cox proportional hazards models and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves were used to examine survival time. Results—A higher <b>titrated</b> oxygen requirement was associated with a greater mortality rate independent of forced vital capacity and six-minute walk test results in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (adjusted hazard ratio per 1 L/min = 1. 10, 95 % confidence interval 1. 01 to 1. 20). The <b>titrated</b> oxygen requirement was at least as accurate as pulmonary function and six-minute walk testing at predicting 1 -year mortality. Findings were similar in other interstitial lung diseases. Conclusion—The <b>titrated</b> oxygen requirement is a simple, inexpensive bedside measuremen...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{clinical}} {{effects of}} a pre-fixed flow of air-oxygen versus a flow <b>titrated</b> according to visible bubbling are not well understood. Objective: To compare the {{effects of a}} fixed flow (5 L/min) and <b>titrated</b> flow (flow just enough to ensure bubbling) at different set pressures on delivered intra-prong pressure, gas exchange and clinical parameters in preterm infants on bubble CPAP for respiratory distress. Methods: Preterm infants less than 35 weeks gestation on bubble CPAP and less than 96 h of age, were enrolled in this cross over study. They were subjected to 30 minute periods of <b>titrated</b> flow and fixed flow. At the end of both epochs, gas flow rate, set pressure, FiO 2, SpO 2, Silverman retraction score, respiratory rate, abdominal girth, and blood gases were recorded. The delivered intra-prong pressure was measured by an electronic manometer. Results: Sixty nine recordings were made in 54 infants. For each of the set CPAP pressures (4, 5 and 6 cm H 2 O), the mean delivered pressure with a fixed flow of 5 L/min was higher than that delivered by the <b>titrated</b> flow. During the fixed flow epoch, the delivered pressure was closer to and higher than the set pressure resulting in higher PaO 2 and lower PaCO 2 as compared to <b>titrated</b> flow epoch. In the <b>titrated</b> flow period, the delivered pressure was consistently lower than the set pressure. Conclusion: In preterm infants on bubble CPAP with set pressures of 4 to 6 cm H 2 O, a fixed flow of 5 L/min is more effective than a flow <b>titrated</b> to ensure adequate visible bubbling. It achieves higher delivered pressures, better oxygenation and ventilation...|$|R
