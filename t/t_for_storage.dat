40|$|Aim. To {{study the}} {{stability}} of biocompatible microemulsion composition-based bromokain transdermal therapeutic systems (TTS) in order to confi rm the original shelf life and to identify the most appropriate TTS composition for storage. Materials and methods. The stability test using accelerated aging method {{was performed on the}} samples of TTS containing 50 and 100 mg of bromokain. Physicochemical properties of TTS were analyzed {{at the end of the}} 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd, and 6 th month of storage. The physical confi guration of the dosage form, the content of bromokain in TTS, and drug release were evaluated at each stage of the study. The content of bromokain in the samples was recorded using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). As a control for each method, the newly manufactured TTS forms were used. Results. Unlike the samples containing 50 mg of bromokain, TTS with 100 mg of the anesthetic demonstrated changes in the physical confi guration and deterioration of the functional properties after the 6 th month of storage. The quantitative content of the substance in TTS containing 50 and 100 mg of bromokain met the requirements of regulatory documentation (RD) at all phases of the experiment and was within 50, 0 ± 5, 0 mg and 100, 0 ± 10, 0 mg, respectively. The release profi le of TTS with 50 mg of bromokain has remained unchanged during storage and complies with the RD. TTS with  100 mg of bromokain after the 3 rd month of storage had a deviation from the release profi le indicated in the RD. Conclusion. The shelf life of 2 years at t = 25 °C preset by us for samples of TTS containing 50 mg of bromokain has been confi rmed. According to the test results, samples of TTS with the content of bromokain of 100 mg were declared unstable and unfi <b>t</b> <b>for</b> <b>storage</b> under the selected storage conditions. </p...|$|E

40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: Delays between collection and laboratory analysis of equine body fluid samples {{are common in}} practice; however, the effects of delays on the accuracy of results and diagnostic interpretation are unknown. Objectives To assess the effects of storage time and temperature combination on protein and cell parameters of equine synovial and mesothelial cavity fluids and determine whether any changes affect clinicopathological interpretation. Study design: In vitro experiment. Methods: Body fluid samples obtained from horses during diagnostic investigation were divided into 7 aliquots and total protein concentration (TP), total nucleated cell count (TNCC) and neutrophil morphology were analysed immediately (T 0) and at 24 (T 24), 48 (T 48) and 72 h (T 72) after storage at 4 or 22 °C. Linear mixed models were used to analyse effects of fluid type and storage conditions on TP, TNCC and neutrophil morphology grade. Changes in interpretation of samples over time and diagnostic performance at each analysis point were recorded. Results: A total of 32 samples were collected from 23 horses. Storage {{had no effect on}} TP. Cell count was influenced by fluid type and was significantly reduced at <b>T</b> 72 <b>for</b> <b>storage</b> at 4 °C and T 24, T 48 and <b>T</b> 72 <b>for</b> 22 °C (P&# 60; 0. 001). Neutrophil morphology grade was significantly greater at T 24, T 48 and T 72 than at <b>T</b> 0 <b>for</b> both 4 and 22 °C (P&# 60; 0. 001). For 9 samples, the diagnostic interpretation changed over time. Specificity and positive predictive value at each analysis point was 100...|$|R

40|$|The CH 2 M HILL Plateau Remediation Company (CHPRC) has {{recommended}} to the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) a two phase approach <b>for</b> removal and <b>storage</b> (Phase 1) and treatment and packaging for offsite shipment (Phase 2) of the sludge currently stored within the 105 -K West Basin. This two phased strategy enables early removal of sludge from the 105 -K West Basin by 2015, allowing remediation of historical unplanned releases of waste and {{closure of the}} 100 -K Area. In Phase 1, the sludge currently stored in the Engineered Containers and Settler Tanks within the 105 -K West Basin will be transferred into sludge transport and storage containers (STSCs). The STSCs will be transported to an interim storage facility. In Phase 2, sludge will be processed (treated) to meet shipping and disposal requirements and the sludge will be packaged for final disposal at a geologic repository. The {{purpose of this study}} is to evaluate two alternatives for interim Phase 1 storage of K Basin sludge. The cost, schedule, and risks <b>for</b> sludge <b>storage</b> at a newly-constructed Alternate Storage Facility (ASF) are compared to those at T Plant, which has been used previously <b>for</b> sludge <b>storage.</b> Based on the results of the assessment, T Plant is recommended for Phase 1 interim storage of sludge. Key elements that support this recommendation are the following: (1) T Plant has a proven process for storing sludge; (2) T Plant storage can be implemented at a lower incremental cost than the ASF; and (3) T Plant storage has a more favorable schedule profile, which provides more float, than the ASF. Underpinning the recommendation of <b>T</b> Plant <b>for</b> sludge <b>storage</b> is the assumption that T Plant has a durable, extended mission independent of the K Basin sludge interim storage mission. If this assumption cannot be validated and the operating costs of T Plant are borne by the Sludge Treatment Project, the conclusions and recommendations of this study would change. The following decision-making strategy, which is dependent on the confidence that DOE has in the long term mission <b>for</b> <b>T</b> Plant, is proposed: (1) If the confidence level in a durable, extended T Plant mission independent of sludge storage is high, then the Sludge Treatment Project (STP) would continue to implement the path forward previously described in the Alternatives Report (HNF- 39744). Risks to the sludge project can be minimized through the establishment of an Interface Control Document (ICD) defining agreed upon responsibilities for both the STP and T Plant Operations regarding the transfer and storage of sludge and ensuring that the T Plant upgrade and operational schedule is well integrated with the sludge storage activities. (2) If the confidence level in a durable, extended T Plant mission independent of sludge storage is uncertain, then the ASF conceptual design should be pursued on a parallel path with preparation of <b>T</b> Plant <b>for</b> sludge <b>storage</b> until those uncertainties are resolved. (3) Finally, if the confidence level in a durable, extended T Plant mission independent of sludge storage is low, then the ASF design should be selected to provide independence from the T Plant mission risk...|$|R
40|$|Various active heat {{exchange}} concepts were identified from among three generic categories: scrapers, agitators/vibrators and slurries. The more practical ones {{were given a}} more detailed technical evaluation and an economic comparison with a passive tube-shell design for a reference application (300 MW sub <b>t</b> <b>storage</b> <b>for</b> 6 hours). Two concepts were selected for hardware development: (1) a direct contact {{heat exchange}}r in which molten salt droplets are injected into a cooler counterflowing stream of liquid metal carrier fluid, and (2) a rotating drum scraper in which molten salt is sprayed onto the circumference of a rotating drum, which contains the fluid salt is sprayed onto the circumference of a rotating drum, which contains the fluid heat sink in an internal annulus near the surface. A fixed scraper blade removes the solidified salt from the surface which was nickel plated to decrease adhesion forces. In addition to improving performance by providing a nearly constant transfer rate during discharge, these active heat exchanger concepts were estimated to cost at least 25 % less than the passive tube-shell design...|$|R
