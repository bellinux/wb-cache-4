5|$|Aspect weavers take {{instructions}} {{known as}} advice specified {{through the use}} of pointcuts and join points, special segments of code that indicate what methods should be handled by aspect code. The implementation of the aspect then specifies whether <b>the</b> <b>related</b> code should be added before, after, or throughout <b>the</b> <b>related</b> methods. By doing this, aspect weavers improve modularity, keeping code in one place that would otherwise have been interspersed throughout various, unrelated classes.|$|E

5|$|The only specimen, the holotype, {{is mostly}} {{brownish}} above, with {{dark and light}} spots, and white below. The snout-to-vent length is 83mm (3.3in). Several features of the scales align it with Trachylepis over <b>the</b> <b>related</b> American genus Mabuya.|$|E

5|$|A {{few years}} later, an {{attorney}} from the International Trade Commission filed an opinion for another case {{that said he}} felt <b>the</b> <b>related</b> patents from Trend Micro were invalid.

5|$|A second {{important}} decision in which Owsley was a participant {{was the case}} of Blair, etc. v. Williams, which invalidated the Kentucky Replevin Act of 1820. This law granted debtors a two-year grace period in repaying their debts unless their creditors would accept notes from the Bank of Kentucky. Owsley and his colleagues opined that this law was in violation of the Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The decision was extremely unpopular with the Commonwealth's citizens, but it was re-affirmed by the court's opinion in <b>the</b> <b>related</b> case of Lapsley v. Brashcars and Barr.|$|E
5|$|Acrocanthosaurus is {{classified}} in the superfamily Allosauroidea within the infraorder Tetanurae. This superfamily is characterized by paired ridges on the nasal and lacrimal bones {{on top of the}} snout and tall neural spines on the neck vertebrae, among other features. It was originally placed in the family Allosauridae with Allosaurus, an arrangement also supported by studies as late as 2000. Most studies have found it {{to be a member of}} <b>the</b> <b>related</b> family Carcharodontosauridae.|$|E

5|$|Although {{generally}} regarded as somewhat of a rival of J.R. in the fictional world of Dallas, Gary Ewing (Ted Shackelford) was not a suspect due to his activity in <b>the</b> <b>related</b> fictional Knots Landing world.

5|$|American Cockers {{are also}} prone to canine {{epilepsy}} and <b>the</b> <b>related</b> condition known as Rage Syndrome. The latter {{is a form}} of epilepsy which can cause a normally placid dog to engage in sudden and unprovoked violent attacks. Initial research shows that both conditions appear to be inheritable.|$|E
5|$|Ants are eusocial insects of {{the family}} Formicidae and, along with <b>the</b> <b>related</b> wasps and bees, belong to the order Hymenoptera. Ants evolved from wasp-like {{ancestors}} in the Cretaceous period, about 99 million years ago, and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 12,500 of an estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their elbowed antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.|$|E

5|$|Apeomyoides savagei was {{described}} as a new genus and species by Kent Smith, Richard Cifelli, and Nicholas Czaplewski in 2006. The generic name, Apeomyoides, adds the Greek suffix -ides, indicating similarity, to the name of <b>the</b> <b>related</b> genus Apeomys, while the specific name, savagei, honors Donald E. Savage for his work on fossil mammals and for assistance to Smith. In the same paper, these scientists argued in favor of apeomyine affinities for Arikareeomys.|$|E
5|$|Because the Moon is {{continuously}} blocking {{our view}} of a half-degree-wide circular area of the sky, <b>the</b> <b>related</b> phenomenon of occultation occurs when a bright star or planet passes behind the Moon and is occulted: hidden from view. In this way, a solar eclipse is an occultation of the Sun. Because the Moon is comparatively close to Earth, occultations of individual stars are not visible everywhere on the planet, nor at the same time. Because of the precession of the lunar orbit, each year different stars are occulted.|$|E
5|$|Ceriantharia {{comprises}} <b>the</b> <b>related</b> tube-dwelling anemones. Tube-dwelling anemones or cerianthids {{look very}} similar to sea anemones, but belong to an entirely different subclass of anthozoans. They are solitary, living buried in soft sediments. Tube anemones live and can withdraw into tubes, which are made of a fibrous material, which is made from secreted mucus and threads of nematocyst-like organelles, known as ptychocysts.|$|E
