5|$|Another {{potential}} Guitar Hero {{project was}} discovered by the archival site Unseen64 for a game titled Hero World, a massively multiplayer online game that would link the Guitar Hero and DJ Hero games. The game had been developed by FreeStyleGames, sometime {{after the release of}} DJ Hero 2, with the main development duties passed to Virtual Fairground, using their platform The Ride, an Adobe Flash-based platform <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>let</b> the game be played in a web browser. The game was cancelled in 2011 along with other pending Guitar Hero projects.|$|E
5|$|In late 2013, the Obama Administration {{announced}} a transitional relief program <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>let</b> states and carriers allow non-compliant individual and small group policies to renew {{at the end}} of 2013. In March 2014, HHS allowed renewals as late as October 1, 2016. In February 2016, these plans were allowed to renew up until October 1, 2017, but with a termination date no later than December 31, 2017.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} nine months, Quisling {{continued}} to lead a party that was at best peripheral to Norwegian politics. He was nonetheless active, and in October 1939 he worked with Prytz on an ultimately unsuccessful plan for peace between Britain, France and Germany and their eventual participation in a new economic union. Quisling also mused on how Germany ought {{to go on the}} offensive against its then-ally the Soviet Union, and on 9 December travelled to Germany to present his multi-faceted plans. After impressing German officials, he won an audience with Hitler himself, scheduled for 14 December, whereupon he received firm advice from his contacts that the most useful thing he could do would be to ask for Hitler's help with a pro-German coup in Norway, <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>let</b> the Germans use Norway as a naval base. Thereafter, Norway would maintain official neutrality as long as possible, and finally the country would fall under German rather than British control. It is not clear how much Quisling himself understood about the strategic implications of such a move, and he instead relied on his future Minister of Domestic Affairs, Albert Hagelin, who was fluent in German, to put the relevant arguments to German officials in Berlin during pre-meeting talks, even though Hagelin was prone to damaging exaggeration at times. Quisling and his German contacts almost certainly went away with different views as to whether they had agreed upon the necessity of a German invasion.|$|E

25|$|Bennett was an {{opponent}} of public health care and blamed government policies for {{the high cost of}} insurance. He voted against proposals to expand government health care, such as those <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>let</b> Medicare negotiate in bulk with drug companies or those that would enroll more children in federally provided insurance. He also voted against the State Children's Health Insurance Program. During his final Senate campaign, he stated that high taxes were causing insurers to pass the costs off to customers. He believed that new drugs were not being properly developed because pharmaceutical companies feared lawsuits if unexpected side effects occurred.|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers' next {{problem was}} finding a college <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>let</b> them shoot the film on their campus. They {{submitted}} the script {{to a number}} of colleges and universities but [...] "nobody wanted this movie" [...] due to the script; according to Landis, [...] "I couldn't find 'the look'. Every place that had 'the look' said, 'no thank you.'" [...] The University of Missouri (Columbia, Missouri) was scheduled to be the college where filming was to be held, for example, but the president (Herbert W. Schooling) refused permission to film there after reading the script.|$|E

500|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Hanigan had a {{difficult}} time finding a college <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>let</b> him play baseball. He attended Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida, where he played third base or left field because of an upperclassman at the catcher position. During the summer in 2001, Hanigan played in the New England Collegiate Baseball League, where he hit [...]282 in 38 games. In his junior year, he hit [...]384 with 48 RBIs over 57 games for Rollins, as the team finished 41–16 and clinched a berth to the NCAA Division II Baseball Championship. Hanigan would have served as team captain his senior year; when he left Rollins, Hanigan's [...]359 career batting average was seventh best in school history.|$|E
500|$|Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier/Lord Caldlow (The Great Danton), {{an aristocratic}} magician. After reading the script, Jackman {{expressed}} interest in playing the part. Christopher Nolan discovered Jackman {{was interested in the}} script, and after meeting him saw that Jackman possessed the qualities of stage showmanship that Nolan was looking for in the role of Angier. Nolan explained that Angier had a [...] "wonderful understanding of the interaction between a performer and a live audience", a quality he believed that Jackman had. Nolan said that Jackman [...] "has the great depth as an actor that hasn't really been explored. People haven't had the chance to really see what he can do as an actor, and this is a character <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>let</b> him do that." [...] Jackman based his portrayal of Angier on 1950s-era American magician Channing Pollock. Jackman also portrays Gerald Root, an alcoholic double used for Angier's New Transported Man.|$|E
500|$|When O'Malley {{admits he}} cares for Christine, she finally breaks down and reveals the ugly truth. Her {{husband had been}} {{corrupted}} by the power and adulation he received. He became a fascist, plotting {{to gain control of}} the United States and use his enormous influence to turn Americans to fascist ideals. She shows O'Malley papers stored in the arsenal which reveal how Forrest (backed by secretive, ultra-wealthy, power-hungry individuals) planned to use racism, anti-union feeling, and antisemitism to divide the country, turning one group against another if it became too powerful to control, in order to create the chaos <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>let</b> him seize power. Christine discovered the plot the day before her husband's death. She went riding the next morning and came upon the washed-out bridge. She could have warned her husband, but decided that a [...] "clean death in the rain {{was the best thing that}} could happen to Robert Forrest". O'Malley convinces her to help him write a book detailing Forrest's scheme.|$|E

500|$|Before production, the {{existing}} characters {{were added to}} the story either in places they would make sense to appear or as cameos from a list of characters suggested by the film's creative team, without consideration if they would legally {{be able to use the}} characters. The company then sought out the copyright holders' permissions to use the characters, as well as working with these companies to assure their characters were being represented authentically. In the case of Nintendo, the writers had early on envisioned the Bad-anon meeting with Bowser as a major character within the scene; according to Moore, Nintendo was very positive towards this use, stating in Moore's own words, [...] "If there is a group that is dedicated to helping the bad guy characters in video games then Bowser must be in that group!" [...] Nintendo had asked that the producers try to devise a scene that would be similarly appropriate for Mario for his inclusion in the film. Despite knowing they would be able to use the character, the producers could not find an appropriate scene <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>let</b> Mario be a significant character without taking away the spotlight from the main story and opted to not include the character. Moore debunked a rumor that Mario and his brother character Luigi were not included due to Nintendo requesting too high a licensing fee, stating that the rumor grew out of a joke John C. Reilly made at Comic-Con.|$|E
500|$|While {{designing}} Hitman Go, Lutz and {{his team}} considered some specific {{factors such as the}} game's price, gameplay time, the brand, the genre, the audience's expectation, production restraints, and the business model. Speaking about that game's genre, Lutz noted that the team could have developed an endless running game for Hitman. However, they thought that this style of game did not align with the series' values and would not be well received by its audience. Instead, they felt that translating Hitman into a board game was more appropriate as it gave players time to think and plan before executing moves. This fell in line with the idea of Hitman being a [...] "thinking man’s game". Designers tested a feature <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>let</b> players lie in wait for targets, similar to the mainline Hitman games. This feature was cut from the final version for gameplay reasons as it allowed players to kill any target on the board and prevented the puzzles from working as intended. The artistic inspiration for the game was drawn from architectural models and dioramas. Characters were created in fixed poses without any limb animations, like chess pieces. Instead of creating detailed textures which requires additional memory, the artists chose to use colour swatches so that most characters shared materials. This method allowed them to use many different colours for characters without incurring lots of draw calls. The team chose not include dialogue, cutscenes, or a heavy narrative structure in the game, citing that people often play video games in short sessions on mobile devices.|$|E

2500|$|Borrowing {{the idea}} first {{developed}} by Enrico Corradini before 1914 {{of the natural}} conflict between [...] "plutocratic" [...] nations like Britain and [...] "proletarian" [...] nations like Italy, Mussolini claimed that Italy's principal problem was that [...] "plutocratic" [...] countries like Britain were blocking Italy from achieving the necessary spazio vitale <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>let</b> the Italian economy grow. Mussolini equated a nation's potential for economic growth with territorial size, thus in his view the problem of poverty in Italy could only be solved by winning the necessary spazio vitale.|$|E
2500|$|When the Liverpool and Manchester Railway was {{approaching}} completion, {{the directors of}} the railway ran a competition to decide whether stationary steam engines or locomotives would be used to pull the trains.

Regardless of whether or not locomotives were settled upon, a prize of £500 was offered to the winner of the trials. Three notable figures from the early days of engineering were selected as judges: [...] John Urpeth Rastrick, a locomotive engineer of Stourbridge, Nicholas Wood, a mining engineer from Killingworth with considerable locomotive design experience and John Kennedy, a Manchester cotton spinner and a major proponent of the railway.|$|E
