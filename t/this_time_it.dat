5|$|The Australian Voluntary Hospital was a {{military}} hospital staffed by Australian expatriates in England that served on the Western Front between 1914 and 1916. For much of <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> was the only Australian presence on the Western Front.|$|E
5|$|A second tournament, the Cromwell Cup {{was played}} a year later. <b>This</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> was only open to teams under two years old.

This was the first {{instance}} where a match involved extra time. This {{would be the last}} tournament to be played in Sheffield for nine years until the formation of the Sheffield Football Association Challenge Cup in 1876.|$|E
5|$|Amelia is a {{domestic}} novel taking place largely in London during 1733. It describes the hardships suffered {{by a young}} couple newly married. Against her mother's wishes, Amelia marries Captain William Booth, a dashing young army officer. The couple run away to London. In Book II, William is unjustly imprisoned in Newgate, and is subsequently seduced by Miss Matthews. During <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>it</b> is revealed that Amelia was in a carriage accident and that her nose was ruined. Although this brings about jokes at Amelia's behalf, Booth refuses to regard her as anything but beautiful.|$|E

5|$|Brookwood {{was one of}} the few cemeteries {{to permit}} burials on Sundays, which made it a popular choice with the poor as it allowed people to attend {{funerals}} without the need to take a day off work. As theatrical performances were banned on Sundays at <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>it</b> also made Brookwood a popular choice for the burial of actors for the same reason, to the extent that actors were provided with a dedicated section of the cemetery near the station entrance.|$|E
5|$|By {{the sixth}} {{year of the}} revolt (494 BC), the Persian forces had regrouped. The {{available}} land forces were gathered into one army, and were accompanied by a fleet supplied by the re-subjugated Cypriots, along with Egyptians, Cilicians and Phoenicians. The Persians headed directly to Miletus, paying little attention to other strongholds, presumably intending to tackle the revolt at its epicentre. The Median general Datis, an expert on Greek affairs, was certainly dispatched to Ionia by Darius at <b>this</b> <b>time.</b> <b>It</b> is therefore possible {{that he was in}} overall command of this Persian offensive.|$|E
5|$|Danebury was {{abandoned}} around 100BC, {{in common with}} the trend across Britain for hill forts to fall out of use around that time. Once again, the east gate was burnt down, although <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> was not replaced. Most of the inhabitants deserted Danebury, and groups of bodies were disposed of in charnel pits. The site continued in use, but on a much smaller scale than before. Buildings were left to decay and the interior of the fort became used for grazing. By the start of the 1st centuryAD, the settlement of Danebury was probably nothing more than a single farm.|$|E

5|$|During {{its first}} few decades, the {{football}} program {{had only one}} poorly suited athletic field on which to play and practice and had no dedicated facilities such as locker rooms. Former coach and contemporary university president Dr. Harry C. Byrd allocated funds {{for the construction of}} a stadium in 1915, and it was completed in 1923. The Board of Regents voted to name it Byrd Stadium in honor of its main advocate. The stadium's capacity was 5,000. During <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>it</b> was common for Maryland to play its better-drawing games in larger stadiums in Washington, D.C. or Baltimore.|$|E
5|$|During the 1600s and 1700s, The Three Fires Confederacy {{controlled}} much of {{the area}} known as {{the hub of the}} Great Lakes, which included the Canadian shore where Sarnia is now located. During <b>this</b> <b>time,</b> <b>it</b> maintained relations with many of the First Nations, including Huron, Sioux, and Iroquois, as well as the countries of Great Britain and France. Their trading partners, the Huron, welcomed La Salle and the Griffon in 1679 after he sailed into Lake Huron. The Ontario Heritage Trust erected a historical plaque under the Blue Water Bridge in commemoration of the voyage, as shown in the photo.|$|E

Seven plays later, Alabama took a 21–0 lead when Christion Jones caught a 22-yard McCarron touchdown pass. Each team then traded punts until halftime.|$|E

5|$|Fausto's {{remnants}} passed {{north of}} the Hawaiian Islands uneventfully until they interacted with a tropical upper-tropospheric trough (TUTT) on August 30. In combination with warm waters, a tropical depression with some subtropical features developed. At <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> was located around latitude 30°N. By September 1, Fausto had redeveloped into a tiny but tropical ministorm. Its rebirth was brief, however, as a mid-latitude cyclone absorbed the system early on September 3.|$|E
5|$|Fought at the {{junction}} of the east-west and north-south roads {{on the eastern side}} of the Black Forest, the day-long battle at Stockach and Engen pitted the two armies against each other for the second time in seven days. The Austrians still had the numerical superiority, but <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> was closer to two-to-one, instead of almost three-to-one. Jourdan had consolidated his force over a shorter line, and had the full Army of the Danube under his direct command. Charles, likewise, had shortened his line; although Hotze had not yet caught up with the archduke, he and his 10,000men were approaching from the Austrians' left rear.|$|E
5|$|In 1539, {{the fledgling}} colonial town of Villa de Señor San Pedro de Puerto Caballos was moved three leagues {{to the south}} and was given the new name of San Pedro de Puerto Caballos. At <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> {{consisted}} of just twelve palm-thatched houses imitating the native style of construction; in 1541 it had 35 Spanish residents. Montejo also moved Santa María de Comayagua to a more suitable location and assigned 35 conquistadors as its citizens. Rich silver deposits were soon found there.|$|E

5|$|In the Champions League, Benzema scored an {{important}} double against Rangers at Ibrox Stadium {{on the last}} match day of the group stage. The 3–0 victory assured Lyon progression to the knockout rounds. In the knockout rounds, Lyon faced Manchester United and Benzema continued to score, <b>this</b> <b>time</b> <b>it</b> was from outside the penalty box in the first leg match which ended in a 1–1 draw and United eventually won the tie 1–2 on aggregate. Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson and players praised Benzema for his performance. Lyon club president Jean-Michel Aulas later accused Ferguson of tapping-up Benzema.|$|E
