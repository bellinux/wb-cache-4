5|$|After {{the battle}} at the River Auja, the brigade camped to the {{south-east}} of Sarona, {{out of range}} of the Turkish artillery. The regiment, having only sixteen officers and 375 other ranks left effective, spent the time building up its strength in men and horses.

5|$|The pilgrimage occurs {{from the}} 8th to 12th (or {{in some cases}} 13th) of Dhu al-Hijjah, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>month</b> of the Islamic {{calendar}}. Because the Islamic calendar is lunar and the Islamic year is about eleven days shorter than the Gregorian year, the Gregorian date of Hajj changes from year to year. Ihram is the name given to the special spiritual state in which pilgrims wear two white sheets of seamless cloth and abstain from certain actions.|$|E
5|$|To the Muslims, Hajj is {{associated}} with religious {{as well as social}} significance. Nevertheless, {{it should be noted that}} the obligation for performing this pilgrimage is only fulfilled if it is done on the eighth to twelfth day of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>month</b> of the Islamic calendar. If in a given year, an adult Muslim is in good health and his life and wealth is safe, they must perform the Hajj in the same year. Delaying it is considered sinful unless the delay is caused by reasons beyond his/her control.|$|E
5|$|A survey {{conducted}} in late 2009 by the National Addiction Centre (UK) found 41.3% of readers of Mixmag had used mephedrone in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>month,</b> {{making it the}} fourth-most popular drug amongst clubbers. Of those, two thirds snorted the drug and the average dosage per session was 0.9g; the length of sessions increased as the dosage increased. Users who snorted the drug reported using more per session than those who took it orally (0.97g compared to 0.74g) and also reported using it more often (five days per month compared to three days per month). An Irish study of people on a methadone treatment program for heroin addicts found 29 of 209 patients tested positive for mephedrone usage.|$|E

5|$|Canada {{was renamed}} Almirante Latorre {{once again and}} {{formally}} {{handed over to the}} Chilean government on 27 November 1920. It departed Plymouth the same day with two of the destroyers, and they arrived in Chile on 20 February 1921, where they were welcomed by Chile's president, Arturo Alessandri. Almirante Latorre was made the flagship of the navy. The dreadnought was frequently used by Alessandri for various functions, including as transport to Vallenar after a 1922 earthquake, and to Talcahuano for the grand opening of a new naval drydock in 1924. In 1925, with the fall of the January Junta, the ship hosted Alessandri after his return from exile. In September, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>month</b> of his term, Alessandri received the United Kingdom's Edward, Prince of Wales, on board the battleship.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his lack}} of {{performance}} in the Tests, Davidson showed his potential with consistent performance throughout the tour. He compiled 944runs at 41.04 during the tour and amassed five half centuries and a century. He scored three fifties in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>month</b> of the tour, and after missing his maiden first-class century with 95 against Lancashire, he broke through with 104* against Somerset at County Ground, Taunton. He also took 50 wickets at 20.96 with the ball. Davidson was steady with the ball, never taking more than three wickets in an innings. He ranked seventh among the Australians in both run-scoring and wicket-taking.|$|E
5|$|Glass Spider is {{a concert}} film by English writer, singer and actor David Bowie. The release was sourced from eight shows {{during the first}} two weeks of November 1987 at the Sydney Entertainment Centre in Australia during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>month</b> of the Glass Spider Tour. The 86-show tour, which also visited Europe, North America and New Zealand, was in support of Bowie's album Never Let Me Down (1987). Originally {{released}} in 1988 on VHS, the tour was choreographed by Toni Basil, directed by David Mallet, and produced by Anthony Eaton. The VHS was released by MPI Home Video in the US and by Video Collection International in the UK.|$|E

5|$|However, his {{re-instatement}} {{was short}} lived, as the navigation ceased {{to operate in}} January 1869, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>month</b> in which tolls were collected. Mortgages of £19,708 were outstanding, of which £2,607 dated from the original construction by Pyott. A plan to buy the waterway by J. R. Stebbings of Southampton in 1871 fell through. A further attempt to buy the navigation was made in 1909 by Patrick O'Carroll, an estate agent from Southsea. He created a company called the Itchen Navigation Ltd, with a capital of £20,000, but {{they were unable to}} establish who owned it, and so the company never traded.|$|E
5|$|Queen's University's student {{population}} operates {{a number of}} media outlets throughout the campus environment. The Queen's Journal is Queen's main student newspaper. During the academic year, the Queen's Journal publishes two issues a week, until <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>month</b> of the semester, when only one issue is published each week. In total the Queen's Journal publishes 40 issues a year. The newspaper was established in 1873, {{making it one of}} the oldest student newspapers in Canada. The other weekly student publication from Queen's is the Golden Words, a weekly satirical humour publication managed by the Engineering Society.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees {{were just}} 1½ games behind the Toronto Blue Jays when they {{acquired}} Lee Smith, and he pitched nearly perfectly for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>month</b> of the season. In eight games, Smith {{did not allow}} a single run and picked up three saves and 11 strikeouts. The Yankees as a team, however, did poorly during {{the remainder of the}} season, and Toronto easily pulled away to win the division. Smith's New York career lasted just those eight games as he filed for free agency after the season. He signed with Baltimore for 1994 for $1.5 million plus incentives.|$|E

5|$|The {{military}} career of Keith Miller, an Australian Test cricketer and Australian rules footballer, lasted from August 1940 until June 1946, when World War II interrupted his sporting career. Miller {{enlisted in the}} Militia, before switching to the Royal Australian Air Force, where he served from November 1941 until 1946 when he was discharged with the rank of flying officer. Miller trained as a fighter pilot, and in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>month</b> of the European theatre of war, he flew combat missions over German installations. However, Miller was more notable for his efforts as a cricketer, representing the Royal Australian Air Force cricket team and after VE Day, the Australian Services in the Victory Tests of 1945, followed by {{a tour of the}} Indian subcontinent and Australia before being demobilised.|$|E
5|$|York {{spent most}} of the season in midtable, and having been as low as 19th in the table in November went on to reach sixth place during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>month</b> of the season. The team's goals scored tally of 55 was the lowest of any team in {{the top half of the}} table, and the sixth lowest of any team in the division. Ingham and Meredith made the highest number of {{appearances}} during the season, each appearing in 51 of York's 52 matches. Rankine was York's top scorer in the league and in all competitions, with 12 league goals and 14 in total. He was the only player to reach double figures, and was followed by Reed with nine goals.|$|E
5|$|Anthony Anthony {{has been}} {{identified}} as the compiler of the information and the artist behind the illustrations through his signature, which has been compared with holograph letters among the State Papers. Anthony's father was William Anthony (died 1535) a Fleming from Middelburg in Zeeland who migrated to England in 1503. William was a supplier of beer to the army, and Anthony followed in his father's footsteps. He went into beer exporting no later than 1530 and became a supplier of beer to the navy. In 1533 Anthony was appointed gunner at the Tower of London, a position he retained nominally until his death. He rose to the rank of overseer of the Ordnance Office, the government body responsible for supplying the armed forces with artillery, and it was in this position that he compiled his Roll. In 1549 he was promoted to master surveyor of the ordnance in the Tower, Calais, Boulogne, and elsewhere for life. He continued the work of supplying arms to English forces, and was active in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>month</b> of his life supplying guns for an expedition against Le Havre.|$|E
