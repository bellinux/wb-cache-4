In the year 2000 Mirko Reisser in cooperation with Gerrit Peters and Heiko Zahlmann planned and organized the first one of the exhibitions. In an interview Os Gêmeos, famous twin-brother graffiti artists from Brazil, called it a great project. Urban Discipline {{had been one of the}} first and still was one of the biggest graffiti exhibitions that had ever been arranged. It also had helped artist like Daniel Man and Banksy <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>step</b> in their career. [...] In a time, where graffiti was not merely scribbling anymore but also not taken seriously yet, to those organizing the event it was important to establish it as an actual art form. [...] Already for the first exhibition international stars of the graffiti scene came to Hamburg. [...] The most important representatives of the international graffiti and street art scene also came to Hamburg for the next two years, in which the project was again organized by getting-up. In 2001 next to Os Gêmeos from Brazil, Martha Cooper from New York, artists from all over Germany as well as Brazil, Austria, France, America and Switzerland were exhibiting their works in the Alte Postsortierhalle in Hamburg. Again in 2002 34 international artists from all over the world came together to exhibit in the Astra-Hallen in St. Pauli.|$|E

"That is too {{difficult}} a matter to decide off-hand, but after {{going into the}} whole matter with my co-trustee, Colonel Bulstrode, {{with the assistance of}} my partner, we shall come to some agreement as to the best course to take. Of course we could oppose the probate of this new will, but {{it does not seem to}} me that we have a leg to stand upon in that respect. I have no doubt that Halstead & James will retire altogether from the matter, and refuse to act further. In that case it will be my duty, of course, to acquaint Simcoe with the provisions of the will, and to inform him that we, as trustees, shall not proceed to take any further steps in the matter until the fate of Walter Rivington is ascertained, but shall until then administer the estate in his behalf. It will then be for him <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>step,</b> and he certainly will not move for some months. After a time he will, of course, apply to the court to have it declared that Walter Rivington, having disappeared for a long time, there is reasonable presumption of his death. I shall then, in your name and mine, as the child's guardians, be heard in opposition, and I feel sure that the court will refuse to grant the petition, especially under the serious and most suspicious circumstances of the case. In time Simcoe will repeat the application, and we shall of course oppose it. In fact, I think it likely that it will be a good many years before the court will take the step asked, and all that time we shall be quietly making inquiries about this man and his antecedents, and we shall, of course, keep up a search for the child. It may be that his disappearance is only a coincidence, and that he has, as we at first supposed, been stolen for the purpose of making a heavy claim for his return." ...|$|E

40|$|The idea {{of varying}} the chart {{parameters}} has been explored extensively in recent years. Basically, the value establishes if the control should be relaxed or not.

When falls {{far from the}} target {{but not in the}} action region the control is tightened because one will wait less <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> sample and/or <b>the</b> <b>next</b> sample will be larger than usual. In this paper, we extend this study to consider the action limits variable too. The idea is to draw the action limits wider than usual when the control is relaxed and narrower than usual when the control is tightened.
