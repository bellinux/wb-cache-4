5|$|In the 12 {{months after}} his death, Jackson sold more than 8.2 million albums in the United States and 35 million albums worldwide, making him the best-selling albums artist of 2009. He became the first artist to sell one million {{downloads}} in a week in music download history, with a record-breaking 2.6 million downloads of his songs. Three of his albums, Thriller, Number Ones and The Essential Michael Jackson, sold more than any new album, {{the first time a}} catalog album has ever scanned more sales than any new album. Jackson also became the first artist in history to have four of the top 20 best-selling albums in a single year in the United States. Following this surge in sales, Sony extended its distribution rights for Jackson's material, which had been due to expire in 2015. On March 16, 2010, Sony Music Entertainment, spearheaded by its Columbia/Epic Label Group division, signed a new deal with the Jackson estate to extend their distribution rights <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> catalogue until at least 2017, and release ten new albums of previously unreleased material and new collections of released work.|$|E
5|$|On 14 February (referred to as Day of Rage by protest organisers), about 6,000 {{people took}} part in many protests around Bahrain {{demanding}} the release of previously detained protesters, socio-economic justice, political reform and a constitutional monarchy. Police then attacked the protesters throughout the day, using tear gas, rubber bullets and shotguns, inflicting many injuries and causing the hospitalisation of four demonstrators. In the evening, Ali Mushaima died from police shotgun wounds <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> at close range. The next day, thousands of mourners attended his funeral. During the ceremony police shot Fadhel Al-Matrook in the back at close range; he died from his wounds within an hour. People were then allowed to march to and occupy Pearl Roundabout, where they began to set up tents; the number of demonstrators had swelled to 10,000 people by nightfall. King Hamad offered his condolences for the two deaths and announced {{the establishment of a}} committee to investigate the events of the previous two days. In total, 25people were said to have been injured on 15February.|$|E
5|$|Recovering in {{time for}} the 2010–11 season, Edler {{continued}} to improve and was on pace to record new career-highs in goals, assists and points when he suffered a back injury in January 2011. Canucks General Manager Mike Gillis told reporters that Edler had been experiencing tightness in his back at several times in the season, but an open-ice hit against Dallas Stars forward Jamie Benn during a game on 24 January might have contributed <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> problems. Edler underwent microdisectomy surgery to relieve pressure on a herniated disk and was sidelined for two-and-a-half months, returning for the second-last game of the regular season. Finishing the season with eight goals and 33 points over 51 games, he ranked second among team defencemen in scoring, behind Ehrhoff. His 24 minutes and 17 seconds of average ice time per game also led the Canucks. As the Canucks won the Presidents' Trophy {{for the first time in}} franchise history, the team entered the 2011 playoffs with the first seed in the West. Eliminating the Chicago Blackhawks, Nashville Predators and San Jose Sharks, the Canucks advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in 17 years. Facing the Boston Bruins, the team lost the series in seven games. Following their defeat, it was revealed that several Canucks players had been playing with injuries, including Edler, who played Game 7 with two broken fingers. He ranked second among Canucks defensemen and third in the League overall with 11 points (2 goals and 9 assists) in 25 games.|$|E

5|$|With Blackburn {{now in the}} Championship, Slew {{was still}} unable to make the break into the first team and was instead loaned to League One side Oldham Athletic for six months in August 2012. Slew scored on his Oldham debut, netting in a 2–4 League Cup loss to Sheffield Wednesday a week after signing. After only four {{appearances}} for his temporary club, Slew suffered a stress fracture <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> and was sidelined for over three months, returning to Blackburn Rovers for treatment, and effectively ending his loan spell. Having recovered from his injury, Slew signed a six-week loan deal with League Two side Rotherham United {{at the end of}} January 2013. Slew's first appearance for Rotherham came just two days later, in a 3–1 win against promotion rivals Northampton Town, and he played regularly for the duration of his loan spell, making seven appearances in total. Despite Rotherham hoping to retain Slew's services {{until the end of the}} season, they were unable to agree a deal with Blackburn Rovers, and Slew returned to Ewood Park once more.|$|E
5|$|As {{the teams}} {{returned}} to Asia, the focus {{shifted to the}} championship race. Lewis Hamilton put himself in the ideal position to take the fight to Fernando Alonso, qualifying on pole whilst Alonso could only manage fifth place. In the physically most demanding race of the year, the teams jostled for position through {{the first phase of}} the Grand Prix, trying to position themselves for the final ten laps. Just as the drivers established a rhythm, Hamilton's gearbox failed, forcing him out of the race and handing the lead to Sebastian Vettel. The race was shortened by two laps to fit the two-hour time limit for a Grand Prix following a pair of lengthy safety car interventions; first, Narain Karthikeyan understeered into the barriers under the grandstands on lap 30, forcing the safety car to be deployed. The drivers had little opportunity to get comfortable on the restart, as Michael Schumacher misjudged his braking point at the end of the Esplanade Bridge, careening into the back of Jean-Éric Vergne and triggering the safety car for the second time in an accident that was a near mirror-image of his collision with Sergio Pérez in 2011. He was later given a ten-place grid penalty for the Japanese Grand Prix. Vettel controlled the race from the second restart, beating Jenson Button to the line, for his second win of the season and his first since the Bahrain Grand Prix five months previously. Alonso completed the podium, retaining his championship lead after defending from Paul di Resta late in the race. Elsewhere, a string of retirements – including a late engine problem for Bruno Senna, which left the Brazilian with minor burns <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> – and a series of altercations involving Mark Webber, Nico Hülkenberg, Kamui Kobayashi and Sergio Pérez as they fought over the minor points positions allowed Timo Glock to finish twelfth, the result seeing Marussia retake tenth position in the World Constructors' Championship from Caterham.|$|E
