50|$|The CX4 Storm {{includes}} a Picatinny rail {{that can be}} extended under the barrel by pushing in the sling button and pulling the rail out by a <b>thumb</b> <b>tab.</b> Each Storm also {{includes a}} side rail with two mounting screws, a second can be purchased along with a bottom rail from the manufacturer. The contoured bottom rail is designed to attach under the two side rails. A top rail can also be purchased and installed with a tool {{that comes with the}} carbine. Three screws and nuts attach {{it to the top of}} the carbine using a pre-drilled hole, allowing the user to use the rail as a template to tap two other holes hidden under a thin membrane of plastic. The correct size drill bit needed for attaching the top rail is not included with the rifle or the top rail kit and has to be purchased separately. A maximum of five Picatinny rails can be utilized using Beretta accessory kits, or the user can use the two present at purchase to attach a number of optics, grips, lights, lasers, bipods etc. This firearm was designed to be very adaptable to customization.|$|E

5000|$|The hogscraper {{candlestick}} is {{an early}} (circa 1780 - 1860) form of lighting device commonly used in 19th-century North America and Britain, and mainly manufactured in England. The device is manufactured of tempered sheet iron, wrought in several pieces and joined together by metal joinery and silver soldering. The name {{is derived from the}} candlestick's resemblance to an antique device used to scrape bristles from hog hide after slaughter. The antique lighting device commonly consists of a shaft, attached to a round base with a <b>thumb</b> <b>tab</b> ejector mechanism to remove the residual candle stub, and a round lip or [...] "bobeche" [...] to collect candle drippings. The [...] "bobeche" [...] often has a hook extension used for hanging the device. Some hogscraper candlesticks were manufactured with decorative brass or iron bands at the midsection of the shaft and are commonly referred to as [...] "wedding band" [...] hogscrapers. Often the devices are [...] "signed" [...] on the thumb ejector tab by the manufacturer. Historical trade directories have identified most of these manufacturers and the dates of their business existence. While most manufacturers have been identified to Birmingham there is evidence of manufacturing in Sheffield, England. There is no substantive evidence of American manufacturers before 1850.|$|E

50|$|The default {{look and}} feel of the Appearance Manager in the Mac OS 8 - 9 era is Apple Platinum, which was {{intended}} to be the primary GUI for Copland. Platinum retains many of the shapes and positions of elements from System 7 and earlier, like window control widgets and buttons and while Charcoal is the default system font, Chicago was available via a menu option. However, various shades of grey are used extensively throughout the interface, as opposed to previous interfaces which are mostly monochrome black and white. Apple Platinum is not a theme, however. It is actually embedded into the Appearance Manager. The Appearance Control Panel has the ability to attach a theme to the Appearance Manager. There is an Apple Platinum file in the themes folder in the System Folder which acts as a stub, but no functional theme elements are embedded into it. Customizable palettes ('clut' resources) are used for progress bars, scroll <b>thumbs,</b> slider <b>tabs</b> and menu selections in Apple Platinum and this unique option is not available to real themes. The Appearance Control Panel uses the type code 'pltn' to identify if a file should act like a palette modification stub to Apple Platinum and the type code 'thme' to identify if a file should act like an Appearance Theme. An important distinction is that the Appearance Control Panel implements themes into the Appearance Manager. Kaleidoscope is a third party software that implements schemes into the Appearance Manager. Kaleidoscope is not a substitute for the Appearance Manager. It is a substitute for the Appearance Control Panel.|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesMotivation: Conventional surface {{electromyography}} (EMG) methods {{cannot be}} used to detect deep muscle activation. A new non-invasive superficial and deep muscle EMG (sdEMG) technique has recently been used to derive the EMG activity of Brachialis and Tibialis Posterior muscles in {{the upper and lower}} limb respectively. The aim {{of the present study was}} to apply a modified version of sdEMG to the forearm to detect EMG activity of the deep extrinsic thumb muscles Flexor Pollicis Longus (FPL), Extensor Pollicis Longus (EPL), Extensor Pollicis Brevis (EPB) and Abductor Pollicis Longus (APL) using surface electrodes. Methods: High density monopolar EMG was detected from 2 concentric rings, each consisting of 20 custom designed and manufactured silver electrodes, placed at the distal and proximal thirds of the right forearm of 15 healthy male participants. The EMG signals were recorded by a custom synthesised from open source components, EMG amplifier system interfacing with a custom designed LabVIEW® program. The participants performed 10 repetitions of isometric thumb flexion (TFl), thumb extension (TEx), <b>thumb</b> abduction (<b>TAb),</b> <b>thumb</b> adduction (TAd), index finger flexion (IFFl) and index finger extension (IFEx). Each isometric contraction was performed in a randomized order at a standardized effort level of 30 % of the participant's maximum voluntary contraction (verified by a custom designed and built thumb dynamometer). The Independent Component Analysis (ICA) algorithm, fastICA, was used to un-mix the 40 monopolar EMG waveforms (containing EMG activity attributable to both superficial and deep muscles) into 40 constitutive components, known as the Independent Components (ICs). The activation envelope of the ICs was found using a 250 ms RMS smoothing filter and normalized between 0 and 1. A contraction sequence specific predicted EMG waveform based on intramuscular measurements (from existing studies in the literature) was created for each deep muscle and correlated with the processed ICs using Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (r). The ICs were ranked according to the corresponding r value and the highest r ranked IC for each muscle was considered to represent the recovered EMG activity from that particular muscle. Finally, a per sample basis accuracy, sensitivity and specificity analysis was conducted between each deep muscle's predicted EMG and highest r ranked IC at different activation thresholds. A linear mixed-effects statistical model was used to find the overall accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values over all the thresholds for each deep muscle. Results: Overall correlations of 0. 81 for FPL (D), 0. 88 for EPL (D), 0. 92 for EPB (D) and 0. 83 for APL (D) (p< 0. 001 for all muscles) were found between the predicted EMG waveforms and ICs. Using an activation threshold of 3 standard deviations above a resting baseline level, statistically significant (p< 0. 001) accuracy, sensitivity and specificity measures were found between the predicted EMG waveforms and top r ranked ICs for each of the deep muscles. The values of the 3 statistical measures (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity) for each of the deep muscles were: FPL (0. 76, 0. 88, 0. 70); EPL (0. 87, 0. 85, 0. 91); EPB (0. 94, 0. 93, 0. 94); APL (0. 80, 0. 87, 0. 87). Conclusions: The results indicate that this is the first non-invasive detection of the EMG activity of FPL (D), EPL (D), EPB (D) and APL (D). The ability to detect movement intention as a result of activation from these muscles may be of use for robot based targeted rehabilitation of the hand or in the control of prosthetic hand devices...|$|R
