5|$|After {{confirming}} {{the development of}} a tropical depression, authorities in Costa Rica issued a green alert for coastal regions on September14. The following day, a tropical storm warning was issued for the Atlantic coast of the country. National television and radio stations broadcast warning messages <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public,</b> <b>and</b> emergency crews were dispatched in case conditions were to warrant intervention. This helped with the effective and timely clearing of hospitals, as well as the evacuation of residents in high-risk zones. A tropical storm warning was posted for the Atlantic coast of Nicaragua on September15, extending south from Puerto Cabezas to the adjacent islands. In Honduras, early storm warnings allowed several hundred residents to evacuate well ahead of Gert's arrival. Once it became evident that the storm would strike the Yucatán Peninsula, coastal areas from Belize northward to Cozumel, Mexico were placed under a tropical storm warning on September17 until Gert's landfall the next day.|$|E
40|$|Introduction. This paper {{identifies}} {{research gaps}} in <b>the</b> literature related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> sphere <b>and</b> <b>public</b> libraries. <b>The</b> paper then proposes methodological frameworks {{and data collection}} techniques to extend research in this area. Method. A review of <b>the</b> literature related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> sphere <b>and</b> <b>public</b> libraries is conducted to identify research gaps and develop promising research approaches. Analysis. Previous literature is analyzed according to epistemological and ontological approaches. Results. Existing literature related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public</b> sphere <b>and</b> <b>public</b> libraries exhibits epistemological and ontological shortcomings. Empirical studies are relatively few and existing studies remain tied to a limited public sphere concept. Conclusion. Two new methodological frameworks are proposed to guide future work in this area. One framework is the circulation of power model; the other framework is a custom-built model with multiple axes and dimensions...|$|R

5|$|After inheriting Osborne, the King had his mother's {{personal}} {{photographs and}} belongings removed {{and some of}} them destroyed, especially material relating to John Brown, whom he detested. Queen Victoria had intended the house to be a private, secluded residence for her descendants, away from the pomp and ceremony of mainland life. However, the new King had no need for the house and consulted his lawyers about disposing of it, transforming the main wing into a convalescent home, opening the state apartments <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>public,</b> <b>and</b> constructing a Naval College on the grounds. His plans met with strong disapproval from Beatrice and Louise. Queen Victoria had bequeathed them houses on the estate, and the privacy promised to them by their mother was threatened. When Edward discussed the fate of the house with them, Beatrice argued against allowing the house to leave the family, citing its importance to their parents.|$|E

After it was placed in a hearse, the motorcade departed on the five-mile-trip (8km) to the Washington National Cathedral, where the state funeral service was to be held; crowds lined the route of the cortege as the hearse made its way.|$|E
