25|$|The {{release of}} a {{neurotransmitter}} is triggered {{by the arrival of}} a nerve impulse (or action potential) and occurs through an unusually rapid process of cellular secretion (exocytosis). Within the presynaptic nerve terminal, vesicles containing neurotransmitter are localized near the synaptic membrane. The arriving action potential produces an influx of calcium ions through voltage-dependent, calcium-selective ion channels at the down stroke of the action potential (<b>tail</b> <b>current).</b> Calcium ions then bind to synaptotagmin proteins found within the membranes of the synaptic vesicles, allowing the vesicles to fuse with the presynaptic membrane. The fusion of a vesicle is a stochastic process, leading to frequent failure of synaptic transmission at the very small synapses that are typical for the central nervous system. Large chemical synapses (e.g. the neuromuscular junction), on the other hand, have a synaptic release probability of 1. Vesicle fusion is driven by the action of a set of proteins in the presynaptic terminal known as SNAREs. As a whole, the protein complex or structure that mediates the docking and fusion of presynaptic vesicles is called the active zone. The membrane added by the fusion process is later retrieved by endocytosis and recycled for the formation of fresh neurotransmitter-filled vesicles.|$|E

The <b>tail</b> <b>currents</b> reversed at a single well-defined potential (VK). At hyperpolarized test potentials (- 100 mV and below), <b>tail</b> <b>currents</b> were inward and exhibited two clearly distinguishable phases of decay, a fast tail with a time constant of 2 - 3 ms and a slow tail with a time constant of- 150 ms.

40|$|Strong {{depolarization}} and dihydropyridine agonists potentiate inward currents through native L-type Ca 2 + channels, but {{the effect}} on outward currents is less clear due to {{the small size of}} these currents. Here, we examined potentiation of wild-type α 1 C and two constructs bearing mutations in conserved glutamates in the pore regions of repeats II and IV (E 2 A/E 4 A-α 1 C) or repeat III (E 3 K-α 1 C). With 10 mM Ca 2 + in the bath and 110 mM Cs+ in the pipette, these mutated channels, expressed in dysgenic myotubes, produced both inward and outward currents of substantial amplitude. For both the wild-type and mutated channels, we observed strong inward rectification of potentiation: strong depolarization had little effect on outward <b>tail</b> <b>currents</b> but caused the inward <b>tail</b> <b>currents</b> to be larger and to decay more slowly. Similarly, exposure to DHP agonist increased the amplitude of inward currents and decreased the amplitude of outward currents through both E 2 A/E 4 A-α 1 C and E 3 K-α 1 C. As in the absence of drug, strong depolarization in the presence of dihydropyridine agonist had little effect on outward <b>tail</b> <b>currents</b> but increased the amplitude and slowed the decay of inward <b>tail</b> <b>currents.</b> We tested whether cytoplasmic Mg 2 + functions as the blocking particle responsible for the rectification of potentiated L-type Ca 2 + channels. However, even after complete removal of cytoplasmic Mg 2 +, (−) BayK 8644 still potentiated inward current and partially blocked outward current via E 2 A/E 4 A-α 1 C. Although zero Mg 2 + did not reveal potentiation of outward current by DHP agonist, it did have two striking effects, (a) a strong suppression of decay of both inward and outward currents via E 2 A/E 4 A-α 1 C and (b) a nearly complete elimination of depolarization-induced potentiation of inward <b>tail</b> <b>currents.</b> These results can be explained by postulating that potentiation exposes a binding site in the pore to which an intracellular blocking particle can bind and produce inward rectification of the potentiated channels...|$|R

The experiments were done on nerve cell bodies of Helix aspersa separated by dissection, voltage-clamped and internally perfused using a combined suction pipette [...] micro-electrode method. Ca currents were isolated by suppression of Na and K currents. The turn-off or <b>tail</b> <b>currents</b> were large and fast; this {{required that the}} limitations of the voltage clamp be established. A second micro-electrode was inserted to determine temporal and spatial control of potential, and {{it was found that the}} cells were essentially equipotential within 60 microsec during the largest <b>tail</b> <b>currents.</b> Series resistance was less than 5 k omega as measured by a small-perturbation, pseudorandom noise-current signal and presented negligible error in the measurements. Activation was complicated by the presence of asymmetry currents which required evaluation. This was done after Co replacement for Ca. The asymmetry currents were sufficiently small for their contribution to the <b>tail</b> <b>currents</b> to be ignored. Addition of Cd to Ca solutions could not be used since relatively large inward <b>tail</b> <b>currents</b> persisted in the presence of Cd. <b>Tail</b> <b>currents</b> were fitted by sums of two or three exponentials; each was sensitive to Ca-channel blockers but only two were due to closure of Ca channels. The two faster components with time constants tau F and tau S, for fast and slow respectively, were produced by brief, 3. 0 msec voltage pulses and were present in all cells. The third and slowest component with time constant tau VS, for very slow, activated much more slowly and was not always present. The amplitudes of tau F and tau S were reduced by cooling and were increased when Ca was replaced by Ba extracellularly or when the external Ca concentration was increased. Hence, these components were due to closure of Ca channels. The third component activated faster in Ba solution. When fully activated it had the same amplitude in either Ba or Ca solution despite the differences in amplitude of Ba and Ca currents during the voltage-clamp step. The amplitude of the third component was also not changed by increasing external Ca concentration; hence it was not due to closure of Ca channels. Cooling also had very little effect. The third component was abolished by Ca blockers, but it does not appear to be related to previously described Ca-activated currents. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|R

We have characterized the inhibitory effects of two muscarinic agonists, oxotremorine-M (Oxo-M) and bethanechol chloride (BeCh), on Ca 2 + currents in neonatal rat superior cervical ganglion neurons. Oxo-M-mediated (10 μM) inhibition occurred via two signaling pathways. The first pathway inhibited whole cell peak currents, consisting primarily of N-type current, but not FPL 64176 -induced, long-lasting <b>tail</b> <b>currents,</b> comprised entirely of L-type current. Inhibited currents displayed slowed activation kinetics and voltage dependence, characteristics of membrane-delimited inhibition.

Activation of the second pathway inhibited both peak and long-lasting <b>tail</b> <b>currents.</b> This pathway was voltage-independent, PTX-insensitive, but sensitive to internal Ca 2 + chelator concentration. Muscarinic toxin 7 (MT- 7, 100 nM), an irreversible M 1 receptor antagonist, eliminated this inhibition.

50|$|There {{are three}} {{principal}} metrics {{of how well}} a current mirror will perform {{as part of a}} larger circuit. The first measure is the static error, the difference between the input and output currents expressed as a fraction of the input current. Minimizing this difference is critical in such applications of a current mirror as the differential to single-ended output signal conversion in a differential amplifier stage because this difference controls the common mode and power supply rejection ratios. The second measure is the output impedance of the current source or equivalently its inverse, the output conductance. This impedance affects stage gain when a current source is used as an active load and affects common mode gain when the source provides the <b>tail</b> <b>current</b> of a differential pair. The last metric is the pair of minimum voltages from the common terminal, usually a power rail connection, to the input and output terminals that are required for proper operation of the circuit.

Increasing bath temperature from 5 to 15 degrees C decreased the rate of fall of outward <b>tail</b> <b>current</b> activated by calcium entry.

The tail currents seen upon repolarization after longer (e. g., 500 ms) and larger (e. g., to + 60 mV) depolarizations tended to be inwardly directed. Depolarizations of intermediate strength and/or duration were followed by biphasic tail currents, which were inwardly directed immediately upon repolarization, but changed direction and became outwardly directed before deactivation was complete. When cells were depolarized to + 60 mV for 500 ms both IK and the subsequent inward <b>tail</b> <b>current</b> at - 60 mV were similarly blocked by phencyclidine. Both IK and the inward <b>tail</b> <b>current</b> were also blocked by 4 -aminopyridine.

The phase II <b>tail</b> <b>current</b> is suppressed by depolarizing pulses which approach ECa, is blocked by Ca 2 + current antagonists (Co 2 + and Mn 2 +), and is blocked by intracellular injection of EGTA. The phase II <b>tail</b> <b>current</b> is not blocked by agents which block Na+-dependent action potentials, the Na+-Ca 2 + exchange pump, or the Na+-K+ exchange pump. The phase II <b>tail</b> <b>current</b> is not blocked by the elimination of large outward K+ currents which can lead to extracellular K+ accumulation. Thus, the phase II <b>tail</b> <b>current</b> is not generated by any of these processes. The phase II <b>tail</b> <b>current</b> is reduced by about 60 % following substitution of tetramethylammonium (TMA+) for external Na+, but is unaffected by reducing external Cl-. The phase II <b>tail</b> <b>current</b> is distinct from a persistent inward Ca 2 + current which underlies the negative resistance region of the steady-state current [...] voltage relation of bursting cells. The persistent inward current is only slightly reduced by TMA+ substitution for Na+, and is enhanced by EGTA injection. Injection of Ca 2 + into Aplysia bursting cells elicits a biphasic (inward-outward) current. The inward current can be observed in isolation after blocking the outward component (Ca 2 +-activated K+ current) with 50 mM-external tetraethylammonium. The Ca 2 +-elicited inward current has a reversal potential near - 22 mV, and is non-selective for Na+, K+ and Ca 2 +. The reversal potential is unaffected by changes in Cl- and pH. The Ca 2 +- activated conductance is apparently voltage independent. We propose that the phase II <b>tail</b> <b>current,</b> and hence the d. a. p., is due to the Ca 2 +-dependent activation of a voltage-independent non-specific cationic conductance. This conductance participates in generating the depolarizing phase of bursting pace-maker activity...|$|E
40|$|Calcium tail {{currents}} {{were measured}} in axotomized Aplysia neurones L 2 -L 6 using a two-electrode voltage clamp and micro-electrodes of specially low resistance. Measurements {{were made at}} - 40 mV following depolarizing pulses of 7 or 10 ms duration {{in the presence of}} 45 microM-tetrodotoxin and 200 mM-tetraethylammonium. Symmetrical currents were eliminated by addition of digitally stored current traces produced in response to equivalent hyperpolarizations. The remaining current, identified as a <b>tail</b> <b>current,</b> was blocked by replacement of extracellular calcium with cobalt or manganese. Computer fits showed that the <b>tail</b> <b>current</b> closely approximated the sum of two exponentially decaying components. The first had a time constant, tau 1, of 0. 38 +/- 0. 05 ms, which may have been frequency-limited by the speed of the clamp; the second had a time constant, tau 2, of 2. 0 +/- 0. 8 ms. A more slowly decaying third <b>tail</b> <b>current</b> component (tau 3 = 30 ms), which developed more slowly, {{may be related to the}} non-specific current rather than the calcium current. The tau 1 and tau 2 components of the <b>tail</b> <b>current</b> lost amplitude with increasing pulse duration along an approximately bi-exponential time course that resembled the time course of relaxation of the calcium current during a prolonged depolarization. The slow third component of the <b>tail</b> <b>current</b> showed no such inactivation. The amplitudes of the first and second components of the calcium <b>tail</b> <b>current</b> both increased as sigmoidal functions of the test pulse voltage, reaching half maximum at + 20 mV and plateauing above + 60 mV. The voltage dependencies of the two components were similar. The rate of decay of the tau 1 component increased with increasing temperature and with increasing negative potential, whereas tau 2 showed little dependence on these parameters. The rates of decay of neither the tau 1 nor the tau 2 component were affected by large changes in the amplitude of the test depolarization or in the amplitude of the <b>tail</b> <b>current</b> or by injection of calcium ions or EGTA. Thus, the kinetics of the <b>tail</b> <b>current</b> as resolved under our conditions appear to be virtually independent of calcium-mediated inactivation. Activation time constants (tau m) predicted from tau 1 are 3 to 5 times longer than the values of tau m determined from the half-time to peak of activation. These kinetics are slower than those reported for Limnaea by factors of 2. 5 to 3. 5. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|Sensitivity of voltage-activated calcium {{currents}} to flow-induced {{mechanical stress}} was examined in enriched populations of rat anterior pituitary somatotrophs. Voltage-activated calcium currents were recorded with the whole-cell {{configuration of the}} patch-clamp technique. Pituitary cells were exposed to flow (from pipettes) which was produced by a hydrostatic pressure of about 3 cmH 2 O. In 92 % of the cells studied (n = 87 cells) flow reduced the amplitude of both low voltage-activated (LVA) and high voltage-activated (HVA) calcium currents. These effects of flow on calcium currents did not result from changes in either seal resistance or leak conductance of the cell and were dependent on the magnitude of flow. The effect of flow is selective. We found that LVA calcium currents were substantially more sensitive to flow than HVA calcium currents. Under constant flow conditions, LVA calcium currents were reduced by 57. 6 +/- 29. 6 % (S. D.), whereas HVA currents (recorded from the same cells) were reduced by only 17. 8 +/- 15. 9 % (S. D.). The effects of flow on calcium currents were associated with effects on their related calcium <b>tail</b> <b>currents.</b> Slowly deactivating calcium <b>tail</b> <b>currents</b> were reduced by 75. 3 +/- 25. 6 % (S. D.), whereas rapidly deactivating calcium <b>tail</b> <b>currents</b> were reduced by 29. 1 +/- 14. 4 % (S. D.). The effect of flow on calcium currents {{was not associated with}} any significant shift in the activation curves of the calcium currents (voltage range - 60 to + 30 mV), suggesting that the effect of flow is not voltage dependent. The effect of flow is not dependent on activation of calcium currents during the exposure to flow. Calcium currents which were evoked immediately after cessation of the exposure to flow were reduced in amplitude and recovered to control values. Possible mechanisms underlying the flow effect and possible physiological relevance of the effect on pituitary cells are discussed...|$|R
40|$|A lB, S T R A C T The time-course of {{the decay}} of INa on {{resetting}} the membrane potential to various levels after test steps in potential was studied. The effects of different initial conditions on these Na <b>tail</b> <b>currents</b> were also studied. For postpulse potentials at or negative to- 35 mV, these currents may be attributed nearly entirely to the shutdown of the activation process, inactivation being little involved. Several relaxations may be detected in the <b>tail</b> <b>currents.</b> The slower two are well defined exponentials with time constants of ~ 1 ms and 100 V. s in the hyperpolarizing potential range. The fastest relaxation is only poorly resolved. Different initial conditions could alter the relative weighting factors on the various exponential terms, but did not affect any of the individual time constants. The activation of the sodium conductance cannot be attributed to any number of independent and identical two-state subunits with first order transitions. The results of this and the previous paper are {{discussed in terms of}} the minimum kinetic scheme consistent with the data.
