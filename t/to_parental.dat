5|$|Such a {{depiction}} {{is common}} in semitechnical and popular dinosaur literature. Robert T. Bakker has extended social behavior <b>to</b> <b>parental</b> care, and has interpreted shed allosaur teeth and chewed bones of large prey animals as evidence that adult allosaurs brought food to lairs for their young to eat until they were grown, and prevented other carnivores from scavenging on the food. However, there is actually little evidence of gregarious behavior in theropods, and social interactions {{with members of the}} same species would have included antagonistic encounters, as shown by injuries to gastralia and bite wounds to skulls (the pathologic lower jaw named Labrosaurus ferox is one such possible example). Such head-biting may have been a way to establish dominance in a pack or to settle territorial disputes.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{extensive}} {{body of research}} demonstrating a significant association between attachment organizations and children's functioning across multiple domains. Early insecure attachment does not necessarily predict difficulties, {{but it is a}} liability for the child, particularly if similar parental behaviours continue throughout childhood. Compared to that of securely attached children, the adjustment of insecure children in many spheres of life is not as soundly based, putting their future relationships in jeopardy. Although the link is not fully established by research and there are other influences besides attachment, secure infants are more likely to become socially competent than their insecure peers. Relationships formed with peers influence the acquisition of social skills, intellectual development and the formation of social identity. Classification of children's peer status (popular, neglected or rejected) has been found to predict subsequent adjustment. Insecure children, particularly avoidant children, are especially vulnerable to family risk. Their social and behavioural problems increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in parenting. However, an early secure attachment appears to have a lasting protective function. As with attachment <b>to</b> <b>parental</b> figures, subsequent experiences may alter the course of development.|$|E
5|$|In October 1857 the inquisitor of Bologna, a Dominican friar called Father Pier Gaetano Feletti, {{learned of}} rumours {{to the effect}} that a secret baptism had been {{administered}} to one of the city's Jewish children by a Catholic servant. If true, this would make the child a Catholic {{in the eyes of the}} Church—a fact with secular as well as spiritual ramifications since the Church stance was that children they considered to be Christians could not be raised by non-Christians, and should be taken from their parents in such circumstances. Cases like this were not uncommon in 19th-century Italy, and often revolved around the baptism of a Jewish child by a Christian servant. The official Church position was that Catholics should not baptise Jewish children without the parents' consent, except if a child was on the brink of death—in these cases the Church considered the customary deferment <b>to</b> <b>parental</b> authority to be outweighed by the importance of allowing the child's soul to be saved and go to Heaven, and permitted baptism without the parents' assent. Many Jewish families feared clandestine baptisms by their Christian maids; to counter this perceived threat some households required Christians leaving their employment to sign notarised statements confirming that they had never baptised any of the children.|$|E
40|$|When {{getting married}} people may {{worry about whether}} their parents will approve of their choice in a spouse.

This study was centered on the question: Is there a correlation between adult children’s perceptions and feelings about their parents and their willingness <b>to</b> accept <b>parental</b> advice on marriage choices? A sample of 248 university students completed a set of questionnaires that measured their willingness <b>to</b> accept <b>parental</b> marriage advice, their overall feelings about their parents, and the health of their family relationships. Willingness <b>to</b> accept <b>parental</b> marriage advice was significantly correlated with parental perceptions and family relationships.

5|$|The English {{language}} {{version of the}} Dragon Ball manga is licensed for North America by Viz Media. Viz originally published the first 194 chapters as Dragon Ball and chapters over 195 as Dragon Ball Z to mimic {{the names of the}} anime series, feeling it would reduce the potential for confusion by its readers. They initially released both series simultaneously, chapter by chapter in a monthly comic book format starting in 1998, before stopping in 2000 to switch to a graphic novel format similar to the Japanese tankōbon. In 2000, while releasing Dragon Ball in the monthly format, Viz began to censor the manga in response <b>to</b> <b>parental</b> complaints about sexual innuendos. Viz changed their publishing format for the series again in 2003; the first ten collected volumes of both series were re-released under their Shonen Jump imprint. They have slightly smaller dimensions. The manga was completed in English with Dragon Ball in 16 volumes between May 6, 2003, and August 3, 2004, and Dragon Ball Z in 26 volumes from May 6, 2003, to June 6, 2006. However, when publishing the last few volumes of Z, the company began to censor the series again by changing or removing gun scenes and changing the few sexual references. Dragon Ball Z, from Trunk's appearance to chapter 226, was published in Viz's monthly magazine Shonen Jump from its debut issue in January 2003 to April 2005.|$|E

25|$|COAs {{perceptions}} of their parents drinking habits influence their own future drinking patterns and are developed at an early age. Alcohol related expectancies are correlated with parental alcoholism and alcohol abuse among their offspring. Problem solving discussions in families with an alcoholic parent contained more negative family interactions than in families with non-alcoholics parents. Several factors related <b>to</b> <b>parental</b> alcoholism influence COA substance abuse including stress, negative affect and decreased parental monitoring. Impaired parental monitoring and negative affect correlate with COAs associating with peers that support drug use.|$|E
25|$|Both Chilean men {{and women}} qualify for a family {{allowance}} if they have dependent {{children under the age}} of eighteen (or twenty-four if in school). There are differences in entitlement requirements for the spouse-related family allowance since a man qualifies for a family allowance if he has a dependent wife, but a woman only qualifies for a family allowance if her husband is disabled. Until a reform of paternity laws in 1998, children born outside marriage had less right <b>to</b> <b>parental</b> financial support and inheritance than children born within marriage. A bill was passed in 2007 to give mothers direct access to child support payments.|$|E
25|$|In early development, {{the queen}} lays eggs and {{takes care of}} larvae. Before the {{emergence}} of workers, the queen is responsible for feeding the brood. To feed developing larvae, the queen captures prey by incapacitation, trims it to an appropriate size for carrying, and brings {{it back to the}} nest to further malaxate the item. Males do not contribute <b>to</b> <b>parental</b> care. In fact, many males solicit liquids from developing larvae. Workers forage for food, capture and malaxate prey, defend territories, and monitor the distribution of resources among larvae. The larvae twitch back and forth in their nests {{to attract the attention of}} the workers and queens. When approached by adults, larvae reach back to expose their heads. If this reaction takes too long, workers give the food to another larvae.|$|E

25|$|In infants, {{behavior}} {{associated with}} attachment {{is primarily a}} process of proximity seeking to an identified attachment figure in situations of perceived distress or alarm, {{for the purpose of}} survival. Infants become attached to adults who are sensitive and responsive in social interactions with the infant, and who remain as consistent caregivers for some months during the period from about six months to two years of age. During the later part of this period, children begin to use attachment figures (familiar people) as a secure base to explore from and return <b>to.</b> <b>Parental</b> responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment which in turn lead to 'internal working models' which will guide the individual's feelings, thoughts, and expectations in later relationships. Separation anxiety or grief following serious loss are normal and natural responses in an attached infant.|$|E
25|$|At St Thomas' {{along with}} running the {{out-patient}} clinic for children, she conducted research and gathered around her a multidisciplinary group of practitioners. Frommer {{was one of}} the earliest in the field to identify childhood depression. Part of it she believed was due <b>to</b> <b>parental</b> experiences of separation from their own parents. When she was practising, many World War II evacuees had become parents and their children were displaying the disturbances Frommer had discovered. In some cases, she prescribed newly developed antidepressant medications in very small doses. This was a controversial approach that attracted both international interest and local criticism from some colleagues. Another innovation was to establish formal links with the burgeoning Art Therapy movement. Frommer offered internships in her department to art therapy students from the original St Alban's School of Art course, followed by students from other London courses.|$|E

Introduction: This survey provides baseline data on the extent, nature and consequences of discrimination in Australian workplaces related <b>to</b> pregnancy, <b>parental</b> leave and return <b>to</b> work following <b>parental</b> leave. The prevalence data arises from respondents’ perceptions {{of the ways in}} which they were treated as a result of their pregnancy, requesting or taking of parental leave, and returning <b>to</b> work following <b>parental</b> leave. It is the first nationally representative survey of women’s perceived experiences of discrimination in the workplace as a result of their: 	pregnancy 	request for or taking of parental leave, and 	return <b>to</b> work following <b>parental</b> leave. It also offers a case study of the extent and nature of discrimination experienced by fathers and partners that have taken time off work to care for their child under the ‘Dad and Partner Pay’ scheme (i. e. 2 weeks at the minimum wage within 12 months of birth/adoption of the child). Similar surveys have only been conducted in a small number of countries, such as the United Kingdom and Ireland. The survey results create a benchmark for: 	measuring progress in eradicating discrimination in the workplace related to pregnancy, breastfeeding, and family responsibilities, and 	mapping trends over time...|$|R
