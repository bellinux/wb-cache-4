500|$|There is {{much debate}} whether a public–private divide in {{administrative}} law is necessary. It has been contended {{that such a}} division has [...] "turned {{the law in the}} wrong direction, away from flexibility of procedure and towards a rigidity reminiscent of <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>old</b> days...". Peter Leyland and Gordon Anthony have suggested that a more desirable alternative presents itself in Northern Ireland, where the test for amenability to review is dependent on the [...] "public interest" [...] in the issue. Thus, the public–private divide does not function {{at the expense of the}} legitimate interests of individuals.|$|E
500|$|Robert Bianco of USA Today praised Fox's performance, {{saying that}} it was almost worthy of an Emmy Award nomination. [...] The Star-Ledgers Alan Sepinwall of gave the episode a mixed review, saying that [...] "I find [...] and his love life {{simultaneously}} boring and obnoxious … [...] insufferable"; however, he enjoyed the subplots and commended the acting by Matthew Fox and Jorge Garcia. [...] James Poniewozik of Time did not enjoy the flashforwards, commenting that they were [...] "the first of the flashforwards that resembled one of <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>old</b> flashbacks, in that it just reconfirmed character traits we already knew and showed Jack and Kate falling into patterns we knew from the past … I didn't get much from it". [...] IGN's Chris Carabott gave the episode a 7.5/10, making it his least favorite episode of the season. [...] Carabott wrote that [...] "this season [...] seems to have been relegated to playing second fiddle … oddly enough, even in his own episode, Jack really isn't given much to do" [...] and stated that [...] "the possible rekindling of Jack and Kate's romantic relationship on the island is juxtaposed quite well with their relationship during the flashforward." [...] Dan Compora of SyFy Portal wrote that [...] "the pace … was a bit too slow" [...] and [...] "I usually like the Jack-centered episodes, but a bout of appendicitis simply does not make for high drama or stimulating action"; however, he noted that [...] "all in all, this was a good episode, but it was nothing special." [...] Compora praised Fox's increasingly good acting, but said that [...] "this season has seen much stronger lead performances from Michael Emerson [...] and Henry Ian Cusick [...]" [...] Erin Martell of AOL's TV Squad called [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] "a break after last week's action- and information-packed episode", argued that Rousseau was not given a proper death and enjoyed Rose and Bernard's roles. [...] UGO's Sara shared Martell's sentiments in regard to Rose and Bernard's appearances and speculated that [...] "Something Nice Back Home" [...] would not be enjoyed by fans who like Rousseau or do not like Jack. [...] Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy gave the episode three out of five stars, saying that [...] "the Jack-Kate romantic intrigue is rather dull, while the appendix plot feels like an unnecessary narrative obstacle for viewers to surmount." ...|$|E

Tutu stated that the Guantanamo camp was a stain on the character of the United States, while the legislation in Britain which gave a 28-day detention period for terror suspects was [...] "excessive" [...] and [...] "untenable". Tutu claimed that arguments being made in Britain and the United States were similar to those the South African apartheid regime had used. [...] "It is disgraceful and one cannot find strong enough words to condemn what Britain and the United States and some of their allies have accepted," [...] said Tutu. Tutu also spoke against Tony Blair's failed attempt to hold terrorist suspects in Britain for up to 90 days without charge. [...] "Ninety days for a South African is an awful déjà-vu because we had in South Africa in <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>old</b> days a 90-day detention law," [...] he said.

But all that's over long ago, thank goodness. He's a Christian now, of course, like all the rest of them; a very respectable old fellow in his way, with a keen eye of his own to business, and a thorough comprehension of the state of the sugar market.

They will be dreadfully fashionable! Let me see--Aunt Barbara will have a turban on her head, and a bird of paradise, like <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>old</b> lady in Armyn's book that Mary took away from me; and they will do nothing all day long but try on flounced gowns, and count their jewels, and go out to balls and operas--and they will want me to do the same--and play at cards all Sunday! 'Lady Caergwent,' they will say, 'it is becoming to your position!' And then the young countess presented a remarkable contrast in her ingenuous simplicity," [...] continued Kate, not quite knowing whether she was making a story or thinking of herself--for indeed she did not feel as if she were herself, but somebody in a story.

60|$|The {{enterprise}} {{had started}} well. To begin with, {{he had found}} the ideal editor. He had met Mr. Renshaw at a down-East gathering presided over by Mrs. Oakley, and his Napoleonic eye had seen in J. Brabazon the seeds of domestic greatness. Before they parted, he had come to terms with him. Nor had the latter failed to justify his intuition. He made an admirable editor. It was not Mr. Renshaw's fault that the new paper had failed to electrify America. It was the public on whom the responsibility for the failure must be laid. They spoiled the whole thing. Certain of the faithful subscribed, it is true, and continued to subscribe, but the great heart of the public remained untouched. The great heart of the public declined to be interested in the meditations of Mr. Philpotts and the humor of Mr. B. Henderson Asher, and continued to spend its money along <b>the</b> <b>bad</b> <b>old</b> channels. The thing began to bore Mr. Scobell. He left the conduct of the journal more and more to Mr. Renshaw, until finally--it was just after the idea for extracting gold from sea water had struck him--he put the whole business definitely out of his mind. (His actual words were that he never wanted to see or hear of the darned thing again, inasmuch as it gave him a pain in the neck.) Mr. Renshaw was given a free hand as to the editing, and all matters of finance connected with the enterprise were placed in the hands of Mr. Scobell's solicitors, who had instructions to sell the journal, if, as its owner crisply put it, they could find any chump who was enough of a darned chump to give real money for it. Up to the present the great army of chumps had fallen short of this ideal standard of darned chumphood.|$|E
