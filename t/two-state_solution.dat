In 1988, he was a proponent of the <b>two-state</b> <b>solution</b> to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict (1948), and voted {{for the establishment of}} the State of Palestine {{at a meeting of the}} PNC in Algiers. In 1993, Said quit his membership to the Palestinian National Council, to protest the internal politics that led to the signing of the Oslo Accords (Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements, 1993), which he thought had unacceptable terms, and because the terms had been rejected by the Madrid Conference of 1991.|$|E
5|$|Jordan {{is a key}} ally of the USA and UK and, {{together}} with Egypt, {{is one of only}} two Arab nations to have signed peace treaties with Israel, Jordan's direct neighbour. Jordan views an independent Palestinian state with the 1967 borders, as part of the <b>two-state</b> <b>solution</b> and of supreme national interest. The ruling Hashemite dynasty has had custodianship over holy sites in Jerusalem since 1924, a position re-inforced in the Israel–Jordan peace treaty. Turmoil in Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque between Israelis and Palestinians created tensions between Jordan and Israel concerning the former's role in protecting the Muslim and Christian sites in Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|From 1983 to 1993, Arafat based {{himself in}} Tunisia, {{and began to}} shift his {{approach}} from open conflict with the Israelis to negotiation. In 1988, he acknowledged Israel's right to exist and sought a <b>two-state</b> <b>solution</b> to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. In 1994 he returned to Palestine, settling in Gaza City and promoting self-governance for the Palestinian territories. He engaged {{in a series of}} negotiations with the Israeli government to end the conflict between it and the PLO. These included the Madrid Conference of 1991, the 1993 Oslo Accords and the 2000 Camp David Summit. In 1994 Arafat received the Nobel Peace Prize, together with Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, for the negotiations at Oslo. At the time, Fatah's support among the Palestinians declined with the growth of Hamas and other militant rivals. In late 2004, after effectively being confined within his Ramallah compound for over two years by the Israeli army, Arafat fell into a coma and died. While the cause of Arafat's death has remained the subject of speculation, investigations by Russian and French teams determined no foul play was involved.|$|E

5000|$|Khalaf {{was born}} into a wealthy Palestinian Christian family from Ramallah. His father, Hanna Khalaf, was a {{businessman}} who immigrated to the United States in 1921 and worked there for several years before ultimately returning to Ramallah. Khalaf attended Cairo University in Egypt, where he received a degree from the School of Law. In 1972, he was elected Mayor of Ramallah, having previously served as the city's District Attorney. Khalaf adopted largely moderate stances concerning Israel; he supported a policy of non-cooperation with the military occupation of the West Bank, but was among the first Palestinian public officials to advocate a <b>two-state</b> peace <b>solution.</b> In his early years as mayor, Khalaf was reluctant to deal with Yasser Arafat and the PLO. However, when he faced re-election in 1976, a split had begun to form between [...] "pro-PLO" [...] and [...] "anti-PLO" [...] politicians in the Palestinian municipalities. At this time, Khalaf began coordinating contacts with the PLO and promoting the group as the Palestinians' best vehicle for peace negotiations. This change in attitude allowed Khalaf to win a second term in a year when many officials in the West Bank were voted out of office for not adequately backing Arafat and his aims. He won election to a third term in 1980.|$|R
40|$|What limits ought {{there be}} {{on a state}} 2 ̆ 7 s ability to create a {{homogeneous}} society, to increase or perpetuate non-diversity, or to create hierarchies within existing diversity? This paper examines those questions {{with reference to the}} Lieberman Plan - which proposes to transfer populated territories from Israel to the Palestine in exchange for Jewish settlements on the West Bank - as an abstract exercise in demographic transformation by the state. First the article considers if the Lieberman plan would 2 ̆ 2 work 2 ̆ 2 : Would it create the alterations it proposes, and would those changes achieve a stable, peaceful, even just settlement? It finds that though there is debate about the possible effects, {{there is little doubt that}} transfer would alter the state 2 ̆ 7 s demography; objections about feasibility are really based on a conviction that transfer is undesirable. Similarly, transfer is fundamentally different from ethnic cleansing or apartheid, since it leaves people where they are and moves borders around them. The article then turns to the international standards that might govern the transfer of territory and citizens, to see how they would characterize such a plan. It finds that there is no rule requiring states to condition transfer of territory on the consent of the affected population, and that norms protecting citizenship are considerably more complex than they first appear - even allowing ethnically targeted denaturalization in some cases. The article then analyzes the loyalty provisions of the Lieberman Plan, and notes, contrary to the usual normative assumption, that the foundations of citizenship are actually shared identity and values which derive from a habitual or formative link to a given territory, which in turn creates a right to citizenship not in any particular state, but in the one that incidentally is sovereign over that territory. This interaction of citizenship and territory, when considered together with equal protection norms, suggests that the polity has an interest in defining its own territorial scope and thereby its membership. Human rights do not dictate a particular political dispensation; they do not dictate the shape of any polity. The article proposes a neo-Wilsonian interpretation of self-determination to explain how transfer might be assimilated to existing norms. The present doctrinal regime is ambiguous, and deliberations about this question sound in the realm of politics. The right of Jews, as a self-defining group, to self-determination might entitle them to reassess their union with the Arab population of Israel and to in effect secede from the existing broader multi-ethnic state. In fact, all <b>two-state</b> <b>solutions</b> implicitly confirm the continued relevance of division of communities along ethnic lines in the Israeli-Palestinian context. Curiously, therefore, the Lieberman Plan is actually one of the more candid and more generous proposals, in that it acknowledges the logic underlying self-determination: that a self-defining community cannot extend its political dominion over another group, but rather must withdraw. Finally, the article notes that international law, though it polices excesses by states, is almost entirely silent about the most decisive factor in controlling demography: the fact of state sovereignty over territory...|$|R

40|$|The {{energetics}} of barstar denaturation {{have been}} studied by CD and scanning microcalorimetry in an extended range of pH and salt concentration. It was shown that, upon increasing temperature, barstar undergoes a transition to the denatured state that is well approximated by a <b>two-state</b> transition in <b>solutions</b> of high ionic strength. This transition is accompanied by significant heat absorption {{and an increase in}} heat capacity. The denaturational heat capacity increment at approximately 75 degrees C was found to be 5. 6 +/- 0. 3 kJ K- 1 mol- 1. In all cases, the value of the measured enthalpy of denaturation was notably lower than those observed for other small globular proteins. In order to explain this observation, the relative contributions of hydration and the disruption of internal interactions to the total enthalpy and entropy of unfolding were calculated. The enthalpy and entropy of hydration were found to be in good agreement with those calculated for other proteins, but the enthalpy and entropy of breaking internal interactions were found to be among the lowest for all globular proteins that {{have been studied}}. Additionally, the partial specific heat capacity of barstar in the native state was found to be 0. 37 +/- 0. 03 cal K- 1 g- 1, which is higher than what is observed for most globular proteins and suggests significant flexibility in the native state. It is known from structural data that barstar undergoes a conformational change upon binding to its natural substrate barnase. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R
