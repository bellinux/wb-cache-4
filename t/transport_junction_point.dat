40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{algorithm}} for constructing contours from image data {{by means of}} a G 1 conic A-spline is presented. A conic A-spline is a piecewise smooth chain of connected real quadratic algebraic curves meeting G 1 at the <b>junction</b> <b>points.</b> Once the contour of the image data has been extracted, the algorithm computes the breakpoints of the conic A-spline, i. e the <b>junction</b> <b>points</b> for the conic curves make up the curve. Inflection points are also added to the set of <b>junction</b> <b>points</b> of the A-spline. Tangent lines at the <b>junction</b> <b>points</b> are computed using a weighted least square linear fit instead of the classical divided difference techniques. The conic A-spline interpolates the <b>junction</b> <b>points</b> along with the tangent directions and least-squares approximates the given data between <b>junction</b> <b>points.</b> We discuss and compare our experience with the approaches reported in the recent literature. Additionally, we propose some improvements.

40|$|The {{effect of}} chain {{architecture}} on the morphological and tensile properties of series of multigraft copolymers, with regularly spaced tri-, tetra-, and hexafunctional <b>junction</b> <b>points,</b> was investigated using {{transmission electron microscopy}} (TEM), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and tensile testing. The materials were synthesized by coupling difunctional polyisoprene (PI) spacers and living polystyrene (PS) branches, made by anionic polymerization, with chlorosilanes of different functionalities. Since the coupling process is a step-growth polymerization, yielding polydisperse products, fractionation was utilized to separate each material into three fractions (high, middle, and low molecular weight), each of low polydispersity. All three fractions have the same chain architecture on a per <b>junction</b> <b>point</b> basis but differ {{in the number of}} <b>junction</b> <b>point</b> units per molecule. By applying the constituting block copolymer concept, the physical behavior of these molecules was compared with current theories. It was found that morphological behavior of these graft copolymers can be predicted using theoretical approaches and is independent on the number of <b>junction</b> <b>points.</b> The number of the <b>junction</b> <b>points,</b> however, greatly influences the long-range order of microphase separation. Additionally, two new parameters for adjusting mechanical properties of multigraft copolymers were found in this investigation: (1) functionality of the graft copolymerstri-, tetra-, or hexafunctionals and (2) number of <b>junction</b> <b>points</b> per molecule. An increase in functionality causes a change in morphology, resulting in a high level of tensile strength for tetrafunctional (cylindrical) and hexafunctional (lamellae) multigraft copolymers, leading to about the twice the strength of the spherical trifunctional multigrafts of similar overall composition. Tetrafunctional multigraft copolymers show a surprisingly high strain at break, far exceeding that of commercial block copolymer thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs). Strain at break and tensile strength increase linearly with the number of <b>junction</b> <b>points</b> per molecule. Hysteresis experiments at about 300 - 900 % deformation demonstrate that multifunctional multigraft copolymers have improved high elasticity as compared to commercial TPEs like Kraton or Styroflex...|$|R
