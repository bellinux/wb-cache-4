Novel vortex-based Finite Volume (FV) methods are described and employed {{with regard to the}} small strain, non-linear Computational Solid Mechanics (CSM) capabilities required to model shape casting. <b>The</b> <b>CSM</b> capabilities <b>include</b> <b>the</b> non-linear material phenomena of creep and thermo-elasto-visco-plasticity at high temperatures and thermo-elasto-visco-plasticity at low temperatures and also multi body deformable contact with which can occur between the metal casting of the mould. The vortex-based FV methods, which can be readily applied to unstructured meshes, are included within a comprehensive FV modelling framework, PHYSICA. The additional heat transfer, by conduction and convection, filling, porosity and solidification algorithms existing within PHYSICA for the complete modelling of all shape casting process employ cell-centred FV methods. The termo-mechanical coupling is performed in a staggered incremental fashion, which addresses the possible gap formation between the component and the mould, and is ultimately validated against a variety of shape casting benchmarks...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{a method of}} {{automatically}} extracting word hierarchies based on the inclusion relations of word appearance patterns in corpora.

40|$|This report {{provides}} a draft prospectus that maps {{a way forward}} for BGS science research into climate change, with particular emphasis on the ocean-margin record. The information presented is based on core activity and research undertaken by the Continental Shelf and Margins programme (<b>CSM),</b> <b>including</b> national and international collaboration. The emphasis has been to compile an overview statement on {{the current status of}} climate-related research within <b>the</b> <b>CSM,</b> with a view to assessing its potential relevance to the emerging BGS Science Programme 2005 – 2010 and beyond. The report begins with a summary of the key themes relevant to any understanding of environmental change, namely: Forcing Mechanisms (internal and external to Earth); Long-Term Climate Change; and, Short-Term Climate Change. Accurate predictions of future climate change can only be established by understanding how the climate has reached its present state. As the Earth has been an icehouse world since late Eocene time, an understanding of the Cenozoic evolution of the North Atlantic region is of paramount importance in unravelling this puzzle. The consequences of forcing mechanisms are clear on ocean margins around the North Atlantic region, where they have driven changes in sedimentary, oceanographic and glacial dynamics. However, the linkage between internal and external forces, and their relative contributions to change remain unclear. The establishment of a better event chronology for the North Atlantic region would help to resolve this issue. From an ocean-margin perspective, the way forward should incorporate better regional correlations and syntheses, and properly co-ordinated strategic sampling, drilling and core analysis. Within the framework of <b>the</b> <b>CSM,</b> four detailed scientific objectives are proposed:...|$|R

40|$|Cavitation Susceptibility Meter (CSM) and {{holographic}} {{measurements of}} cavitation nuclei distributions are compared in this paper. <b>The</b> <b>CSM</b> optically detects cavitation in water samples {{passed through a}} venturi. The flow rate, cavitation event rate and upstream pressure {{are related to the}} unstable nuclei concentration, {{as a function of the}} applied tension, in the fluid. A ruby laser holographic system measured the total nuclei size distribution directly. Microbubbles in the fluid were used as the dominant nuclei source. The data from the two detection schemes were compared by allowing for the dynamical behavior of the bubbles as they pass through <b>the</b> <b>CSM</b> venturi. Both measurements show that the nuclei concentration rises approximately exponentially as the applied tension is increased and then, with further reduction in the pressure, reaches a constant maximum due to the shortage of remaining cavitatable nuclei. <b>The</b> <b>CSM</b> underestimated <b>the</b> concentration of active cavitation nuclei in all the water samples tested. <b>The</b> <b>CSM</b> measured cavitation event rate changes over a range of throat pressures much larger than that predicted using the holographic data. Mutual interference effects between bubbles in <b>the</b> <b>CSM</b> venturi are believed to be partially responsible for this behavior. Attempts to cavitate saturated water of the C. I. T.
