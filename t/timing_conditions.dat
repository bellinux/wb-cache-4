For counting problems in application domains which do not require linearizability but will run correctly if only sequential consistency is provided, {{the results of our}} investigation, and their potential payoffs, are threefold: • First, we show that sequential consistency and linearizability cannot be distinguished by the <b>timing</b> <b>conditions</b> previously considered in the context of counting networks; thus, in contexts where these constraints apply, it is possible to rely on the stronger semantics of linearizability, which simplifies proofs and enhances compositionality. • Second, we identify local <b>timing</b> <b>conditions</b> that support sequential consistency but not linearizability; thus, we suggest weaker, easily implementable <b>timing</b> <b>conditions</b> that are likely to be sufficient in many applications. • Third, we show that any kind of synchronization that is too weak to support even sequential consistency may violate it significantly for some counting networks; hence...|$|E

In one condition, each trial {{began with the}} {{presentation}} of an X on the center key, followed by a delay (short or long), after which two side keys were lit. If the delay was short, pecks to the red side key were reinforced. If the delay was long, pecks to the green side key were reinforced. In a second condition, the opposite contingencies applied following presentation of a square on the center key. Choice responses were then tested at 10 time intervals ranging from short to long (1 to 4  s and 4 to 7  s in different conditions). The two <b>timing</b> <b>conditions</b> were combined to create a remembering condition in which correct responding depended upon discrimination of both the sample stimulus (X or square) and the delay interval (short or long). Choices varied systematically across delay in <b>timing</b> <b>conditions,</b> but in remembering conditions, accurate choice at the training delays did not initially generalize to intermediate delays.

Performing a gross motor task, subjects had to lower their trapezius muscle activity using the electromyographic signal as visual myofeedback. Design: Healthy subjects (16 young adults: 20 - 35 yrs; and 16 older adults: 55 - 70 yrs) {{were randomly assigned to}} one of two <b>timing</b> <b>conditions</b> of myofeedback: concurrent (feedback was provided immediately during the trial) and terminal (feedback was provided delayed after the trial) condition. Results: The results indicated that young adults had a higher level of motor performance (i. e., lower muscle activity) compared with older adults when myofeedback was provided. These effects persisted during short- (after 10 mins) and long-term retention (after 1 wk) when no myofeedback was provided. In contrast to young adults, older adults did not improve their performance throughout the experiment. There were no interactions of age with the <b>timing</b> <b>conditions</b> of myofeedback during acquisition and retention. Conclusions: Either timing condition of augmented feedback was equally helpful to young adults, whereas neither was helpful for older adults in learning muscle relaxation. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{language}} for representing timed automata is introduced. Its semantics i {{defined in terms}} of timed automata. This language is complete in the sense that any timed automaton can be represented by a term in the language. We also define a direct operational semantics for the language in terms of (timed) transition systems. This is proven to be equivalent (or, more precisely, timed bisimilar) to the interpretation in terms of timed automata. In addition, a set of axioms is given that is shown to be sound for timed bisimulation. Finally, we introduce several features including the parallel composition and derived time operations like wait, time-out and urgency. We conclude with an example and show that we can eliminate non-reachable states using algebraic techniques. 1 In t roduct ion A real-time system is a system whose behaviour is constrained by requirements on the time in which events can occur.

We assessed {{the effect of a}} 90 -min day-time nap on learning a motor timing task, using 2 adaptations of a serial interception sequence learning (SISL) task. Forty-two right-handed participants performed the task before and after a 90 -min period of sleep or wake. Electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded throughout. The motor task consisted of a sequential spatial pattern and was performed according to 2 different <b>timing</b> <b>conditions,</b> that is, either following a sequential or a random temporal pattern. The increase in accuracy was compared between groups using a mixed linear regression model. Within the sleep group, performance improvement was modeled based on sleep characteristics, including spindle- and slow-wave density. The sleep group, but not the wake group, showed improvement in the random temporal, but especially and significantly more strongly in the sequential temporal condition. None of the sleep characteristics predicted improvement on either general of the <b>timing</b> <b>conditions.</b> In conclusion, a daytime nap improves performance on a timing task. We show that performance on the task with a sequential timing sequence benefits more from sleep than motor timing. More important, the temporal sequence did not benefit initial learning, because differences arose only after an offline period and specifically when this period contained sleep. Sleep appears to aid in the extraction of regularities for optimal subsequent performance. (PsycINFO Database Recor...|$|E
