He explained: [...] "I consciously kept changing engineers because I didn't {{want people to think}} that they were responsible for our sound. I wanted people <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> me." ...|$|E
60|$|His father also wished <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{not long}} before they were enlightened.|$|E
60|$|Smike, who comprehended {{just enough}} of this <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{intended}} as encouragement, prepared to follow with tottering steps, when John whispered in his ear.|$|E

25|$|Now, {{the array}} is already sorted, but the {{algorithm}} does not <b>know</b> if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> completed. The algorithm needs one whole pass without any swap <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> sorted.|$|R
6000|$|... "How was I <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> you?" [...] inquired {{the mate}} surlily, as he {{realised}} his defeat. [...] "I {{thought it was}} the Empress of Rooshia." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is true," [...] Mrs. Forsyth owned. [...] "But it's very disappointing. I've {{always felt}} as if they ought <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> your undecidedness and not ungenerousness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{came the}} {{housekeeper}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Mrs. Catherick's dog?" [...] he asked, fixing {{his eyes on}} mine with a frowning interest and attention, which half angered, half startled me.|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{it almost}} drives me wild. What shall I do? You ought <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> your fault. You have frightened {{me out of}} daring to tell the truth." ...|$|R
30|$|The {{position}} and posture {{of the object}} in the camera coordinate system are calculated. For the robot, <b>it</b> needs to <b>be</b> grasped, not only <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> but also <b>to</b> <b>know</b> where <b>it</b> <b>is.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you know}} about that, do you?" [...] Sergeant Bowen asked in turn. [...] "So they {{made no secret of}} it. Ay, lad, I know it; every man in the {{regiment}} <b>knew</b> <b>it.</b> And good cause I had <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>it,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> that that ruined me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't know it had {{anything}} to do with you. Schomberg was talking of some Swede. How was I <b>to</b> <b>know?</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> only when you began telling me about how you came here--" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was opened}} {{by a young}} girl of {{thirteen}} or fourteen. The undertaker at once saw enough of what the room contained, <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the apartment {{to which he had}} been directed. He stepped in; Oliver followed him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nary one! I {{only got}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a small train {{of only two}} wagons, and it sorter melted into Californy through a {{southern}} pass, and kinder petered out, {{and no one ever}} heard of it agin, and that was all." ...|$|E
60|$|Now {{this is a}} {{frame of}} mind which no boy has a right <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> a strong man's trouble; but, coming when it did, it nearly drove poor punkah-less, perspiring Dicky Hatt mad. He could tell no one about it.|$|R
6000|$|... "None of them knew. We {{do things}} by routine here. You have {{followed}} the routine and found out what you wanted <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> the best way. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> the only way. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> very regular, and very slow, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> very certain." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> your wish, Ellen," [...] {{returned}} the youth, endeavouring to swallow his spleen, [...] "I {{will make the}} trial; though, as you ought <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> part of the religion of a Kentuckian to fret himself {{a little at a}} mischance." ...|$|R
60|$|And Tom was right. She was {{precisely}} {{that sort of}} person. Nobody {{ought to have been}} able to resist her coaxing manner; and nobody had any business to try. Yet she never seemed <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> her manner at all. That was the best of it.|$|E
60|$|It {{can thus}} be seen that Pierre, quick-witted and versed in {{military}} matters though he was, believed as did I, that this cannonading betokened a regular battle, whereas, as we afterward came <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> simply the investment of York, {{the beginning of a}} regular siege.|$|E
6000|$|... "You miserable Irish cur," [...] growled Smith; [...] "how was I <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> your biscuit? Does {{everything}} on the floor belong to you? Perhaps you think I belong to you, I'm on the floor. I don't believe it is your biscuit, you long-eared, snubbed-nosed bog-trotter; give it me back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But he puts me {{most of all}} in mind of my husband, in all his ways, and manner; and our {{old friends}} {{tell me that he}} sets about things exactly like his father, as if <b>it</b> <b>were</b> by imitation. I like <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> so." ...|$|R
60|$|Now, as we {{afterward}} came <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{the custom}} among savages, {{that when one}} of their women begs {{for the life of}} a prisoner, to grant the prayer, and so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> done in this case, else we had never seen my master again.|$|R
60|$|PLAGUE, n. In {{ancient times}} a general {{punishment}} {{of the innocent}} for admonition of their ruler, as in the familiar instance of Pharaoh the Immune. The plague as we of to-day have the happiness <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> merely Nature's fortuitous manifestation of her purposeless objectionableness.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't mean {{to deceive}} you, Lucy," [...] said Maggie, {{as soon as}} she could speak. [...] "It always made me wretched that I felt what I didn't like you <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> because I thought it would all be conquered, and you might never see {{anything}} to wound you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Strange {{interlacing}} {{of error}} with error traversed by truth in this sublunary sphere! Piggie {{was wrong in}} admitting that. Konky was right, for, as every one knows, or ought <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not a whale at all that swallowed Jonah, but a [...] "great fish" [...] which was [...] "prepared" [...] for the purpose.|$|E
6000|$|... "It was {{a foolish}} romance-book, sir, as you seem <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{the only one}} which I ever read, except Hans Anderssen's,--which are not romances, after all. But the {{beginning}} {{was so full of}} God's truth, sir, --romance though it was,--and gave me such precious new light about educating children, that I was led on unawares. I hope I was not wrong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How you women," [...] I said, [...] "do {{worry about}} mere looks! What does it matter? If you want <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{that sort of}} face that grows upon you. At first you do not notice how {{beautiful}} <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> but {{when you come to}} look into it--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{you making}} all the fuss about my not being there to meet her for? She got here all right, didn't she? What j' expect me to do? Kiss her? You ought <b>to</b> <b>known</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too good a day for hunting to miss.... How's Gert? Have a good time in New York?" ...|$|R
50|$|We're {{all kind}} of sad to go, glad <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> won't <b>be</b> long...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Sabin smiled grimly as {{he poured}} himself out a liqueur {{and lit a}} cigarette. He was {{perfectly}} well aware that Wolfenden's visit {{was not one of}} courtesy; a single glance into his face had told him all that he cared <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> fortunate that Helène had been in the room. Every moment's respite he gained was precious.|$|E
60|$|Lord Martindale said {{everything}} affectionate and cordial. If he grieved at the unpromising prospect, he was wise enough <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{too late to}} try to thwart an attachment which had survived such shocks; and he only dwelt on his rejoicing that, after all her trials, his daughter should have merited {{the restoration of the}} affection of one whom he esteemed so highly.|$|E
6000|$|Harry's {{face grew}} white with horror. [...] "My answer to her!" [...] he cried in a ghastly voice, not caring to ask {{at the moment}} how Louie came <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> he who wrote the answers in the Young People's Monitor. [...] "My answer to you, you mean, Louie. It was your letter--yours, not Dora's. You can't deceive me. I read it myself. My poor child, I saw your handwriting." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{it seems}} to me, there is no small error even in this last and more {{philosophical}} theory. I believe, that what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> most honorable <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> also most profitable to learn; and that the science which <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the highest power to possess, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> also the best exercise to acquire.|$|R
60|$|A mere {{sentiment}}? Yes: but as poets know, and statesmen ought <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> by sentiment, when well directed—as by sorrow, when well used—by sentiment, I say, great nations live. When sentiment dies out, and mere prosaic {{calculation of}} loss and profit takes its place, then comes a Byzantine epoch, a Chinese epoch, decrepitude, and slow decay.|$|R
6000|$|... "So I had--two things--one in particular. But you wouldn't {{promise to}} keep it a secret. I'll tell you now if you promise? As an honest woman I wish you <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>it...</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> what I began telling you in the night--about that gentleman who managed the Sydney hotel." [...] Arabella spoke {{somewhat}} hurriedly for her. [...] "You'll keep it close?" ...|$|R
