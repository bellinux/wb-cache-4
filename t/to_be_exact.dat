Astern of us we were getting reports of gale force winds, ripped sails and some damage all the while Lili gained in strength. By our calculation we would get to the Bahamas before the storm did, but {{the problem was that}} the Bahamas were not our final destination. We had to round San Salvador and then sail just under 500 miles back toward the east, well southeast <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exact.</b> We rounded San Salvador and sailed slap bang into the teeth of a ferocious storm. Hurricane Lili was packing around 70 to 80 knots of wind and we hove to to ride it out. I remember feeling exhilarated by it all. It helps to be a little naive and dumb but that’s how you are when you are in your 20’s.|$|E

[...] There is thus some leeway in the choice but Zobel suggests the values m=0.7230 and m=0.4134 which give a deviation of the impedance of less than 2% over the useful part of the band. [...] Since mm=0.3, this section will also have a much faster cut-off than an m-type of m=0.6 which is an alternative for impedance matching.|$|E

500|$|According to Mark Wilson of About.com, Amanda Tapping was {{enthusiastic}} {{about creating a}} radically different character after eleven years playing Samantha Carter in Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis, and expended tremendous effort to separate Helen from Carter as successfully as possible. Tapping was able to successfully portray a woman who's experienced {{a century and a}} half of isolation, strangeness, and relentless compassion. Rick Bentley from McClatchy Newspapers commented Tapping's role as Dr. Magnus was a way for the actor to make a name of herself outside the Stargate universe as Carter. Magnus is also described as a [...] "non-glib, female Jack Harkness;" [...] Jack Harkness being the main character from the British science fiction show Torchwood. Hilary Rothing of UGO said that [...] "Dr. Helen Magnus is intelligent, alluring and has one of those tasty British accents – Victorian era <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exact.</b> That's because she's a 157 years old. But seriously, she doesn't look a day over 35." [...] She also added that Tapping is [...] "right at home" [...] taking the lead for the show. Alex Walker of Den of Geek believed Magnus was [...] "typical for an English character in an American TV show, with a liking for tea and a cut-glass elocution betraying no hint of a regional accent". Helen Magnus has been listed number ten in TV Squad's [...] "Ten Most mysterious characters on television".|$|E
500|$|The film's {{ethereal}} aspects {{and double}} exposures were {{performed in the}} camera because {{the ability to create}} the effects in lab did not yet exist. Dwan made 24 dissolves in the film, each required precise control by the cameramen and that the counts had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exact</b> otherwise the shot would be ruined. Lombardi notes that the cinematographer, Walter Pritchard, was the man who had to go through the ordeal and that Universal said {{he was one of the}} company's oldest men. Dwan would claim that Pritchard would end up in the hospital from the production. In The Parade's Gone By, Brownlow instead gives the number of dissolves as 25 and adds to the story by Dwan claiming that the audience could not figure out the effect was done. Dwan also claimed that by the time 15 dissolves were done that the cinematographer was so nervous that the it would keep him up at night and cause his hands to shake so greatly that an assistant would have to reload the film at the right spot before shots. This production may have been the last unbilled movie credit of Lon Chaney. The discovery of Lon Chaney's role was through Chaney having marked his appearance in a still with an X above his head. Chaney wrote [...] "This is me just below the X sign. Here I am a Russian Prince." [...] on the back of the still. The image still in particular leaves no question that it comes from The Restless Spirit because it also appears on the cover of The Universal Weekly for October 23, 1913. The second image found on the estate depicts Lon Chaney in the role of a wildman, which Mirsalis attributes to a fantasy sequence in the film.|$|E

2500|$|As decimal {{fractions}} {{can often}} not be exactly represented in binary floating-point, such arithmetic {{is at its}} best when it is simply being used to measure real-world quantities {{over a wide range}} of scales (such as the orbital period of a moon around Saturn or the mass of a proton), and at its worst when it is expected to model the interactions of quantities expressed as decimal strings that are expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exact.</b> An example of the latter case is financial calculations. For this reason, financial software tends not to use a binary floating-point number representation. The [...] "decimal" [...] data type of the C# and Python programming languages, and the decimal formats of the IEEE 754-2008 standard, are designed to avoid the problems of binary floating-point representations when applied to human-entered exact decimal values, and make the arithmetic always behave as expected when numbers are printed in decimal.|$|E
2500|$|The {{economies of}} the world have {{developed}} unevenly, historically, such that entire geographical regions were left mired in poverty and disease while others began to reduce poverty and disease on a wholesale basis. From around 1980 through at least 2011, the GDP gap, while still wide, appeared to be closing and, in some more rapidly developing countries, life expectancies began to rise. If we look at the Gini coefficient for world income, since the late 1980s, the gap between some regions has markedly narrowed—between Asia and the advanced {{economies of the}} West, for example—but huge gaps remain globally. [...] Overall equality across humanity, considered as individuals, has improved very little. Within the decade between 2003 and 2013, income inequality grew even in traditionally egalitarian countries like Germany, Sweden and Denmark.

2500|$|ABS-CBN held auditions {{stretching}} from May to June 2006 in various {{cities in the}} Philippines, as well as overseas auditions in Sydney, Milan, Tokyo, Dubai, and San Francisco, for the show's second season, which began on February 25, 2007 (it was originally scheduled for March), and ended on June 30 of the same year. These same auditions were also held for another reality show, Pinoy Dream Academy, another Endemol franchise. This season of Pinoy Big Brother promised a bigger house, more housemates (fourteen <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exact),</b> and a stricter Big Brother. The [...] "bigger house" [...] concept {{stems from the fact}} that the house area was expanded and used in Pinoy Dream Academy.

The number of cameras had been increased from 27 to 42 and the front doors of the house were now at the garden, leading to the eviction hall built next door which was the auditorium previously used in the first season of Pinoy Dream Academy. Previously the original front doors of the house area lead to the facade of the house.

2500|$|The episode has {{received}} negative reviews from critics. Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide gave the episode a negative review saying [...] "After two pretty good shows, Season 12 encounters mediocrity with “Poppy”. At no point does the program become poor, {{but it just}} lacks many real laughs. Outside of some amusing book fair cameos, this one fails to deliver much zing, and it tends to drag."Mark Naglazas of The West Australian called the episode [...] "disappointing". He remarked that it and [...] "A Tale of Two Springfields" [...] (which premiered the same night in Australia) were [...] "so surreal they would have Salvador Dalí scratching his head". However, he identified John Updike's guest appearance {{as an example of}} [...] "sophisticated comedy". The Daily Telegraph said, [...] "The episode gets lost in a quagmire of guest stars. The names range from the sublime to the ridiculous, or <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exact,</b> from Pulitzer Prize-winning author John Updike to actor Drew Barrymore. The script seems designed only to fit in as many big names as possible. Oh for the days when it was the other way round and guest stars fitted in with the script."

2500|$|The {{fact that}} the {{electric}} charges of electrons and protons seem to cancel each other exactly to extreme precision {{is essential for the}} existence of the macroscopic world as we know it, but this important property of elementary particles is not explained in the Standard Model of particle physics. While the description of strong and weak interactions within the Standard Model is based on gauge symmetries governed by the simple symmetry groups [...] and [...] which allow only discrete charges, the remaining component, the weak hypercharge interaction is described by an abelian symmetry [...] which in principle allows for arbitrary charge assignments. The observed charge quantization, namely the fact that all known elementary particles carry electric charges which appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>exact</b> multiples of ⅓ of the [...] "elementary" [...] charge, has led to the idea that hypercharge interactions and possibly the strong and weak interactions might be embedded in one Grand Unified interaction described by a single, larger simple symmetry group containing the Standard Model. This would automatically predict the quantized nature and values of all elementary particle charges. Since this also results in a prediction for the relative strengths of the fundamental interactions which we observe, in particular the weak mixing angle, Grand Unification ideally reduces the number of independent input parameters, but is also constrained by observations.|$|E
