5|$|Ya Kun Kaya <b>Toast</b> (Simplified Chinese: 亚坤加椰面包) is a Singaporean {{chain of}} mass-market, retro-ambience cafes selling <b>toast</b> {{products}} (notably kaya <b>toast),</b> soft-boiled eggs and coffee. Founded by Loi Ah Koon in 1944, Ya Kun remained a small family-run stall for decades, but have expanded rapidly since Loi's youngest son headed {{the business in}} 1999.

5|$|In 1926, Lai Ah Koon (黎亚坤) {{emigrated from}} Hainan to Singapore, {{where he worked}} as a coffee-stall assistant. He later went on to start his own {{business}} with two other immigrants. They sold coffee, crackers and <b>toast</b> at Telok Ayer Basin, however, his two partners later dropped out, leaving him to run the stall alone. He married while visiting relatives in Hainan, his wife later settled down with him in Singapore. She worked alongside him and later suggested cutting each slice of bread into half and combining the <b>toast</b> with her homemade kaya, this became their signature kaya <b>toast.</b> Registered in 1944 as Ya Kun Coffeestall (Ya Kun being Ah Koon in Hanyu Pinyin), the stall gradually developed a reputation for delicious kaya <b>toast</b> and friendly service. The couple, their eight children and seven other families lived together in a three-storey shophouse across the road, where the Hong Leong Building now stands. As the children grew up, they began to help stir the kaya, run errands, charcoal-grill the bread and eventually, manage the stall.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine amino acid content, urease activity and trypsin inhibitor activity in soybean grain for polygastric animals’ feed aft er <b>toasting</b> with the aim to introduce thick layer in <b>toasting</b> technology. Hence, soybean was <b>toasted</b> both in thick and thin layer at 130 oC during 10 minutes. In order to properly monitor the technological process of soybean thermal processing, it was necessary to study crude protein content, urease activity, trypsin inhibitor activity and amino acid composition of soybean in natural and <b>toasted</b> samples. Results demonstrate that protein content in soybean <b>toasted</b> in thick and thin layer was found to be slightly increased while urease activity was reduced in relation to non-treated sample. Study also established a significant reduction of trypsin inhibitor activity aft er <b>toasting,</b> at higher extent in thin layer <b>toasting.</b> Amino acid content of soybean was slightly increased in relation to natural sample, as well as difference between amino acid content in samples <b>toasted</b> in thick and thin layers...|$|R

5|$|One of Smith's {{significant}} contributions to the menu was {{the addition of a}} breakfast product line as part of the 1978 product line expansion. Up until that point, breakfast was not a market Burger King had served. Other than the addition of the Croissan'Wich in 1983, the breakfast menu remained almost identical to the McDonald's offerings until a menu revamp in 1986. This expansion introduced BK's A.M. Express product line, which included French <b>toast</b> sticks and mini-muffins. The new breakfast line was designed to be portable, because studies had shown that an increasing percent of consumers were eating breakfast on the go. Shortly after the introduction of the French <b>toast</b> stick products, BK partnered with Lender's Bagels to introduce a bagel breakfast sandwich. The new product was designed to drive sales in the morning by piquing customer's curiosity with a new taste. The product was tested for several months in BK's original home territory of Miami before a national roll-out.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTThe use of cassava starch and {{soy protein}} {{concentrate}} edible coatings containing 20 % glycerol in extending the shelf life of <b>toasted</b> groundnut during ambient (27 ± 1 °C) storage for 14 days was studied.
