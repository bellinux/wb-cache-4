500|$|In {{the second}} season of Glee, Shannon Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones) is {{introduced}} as the new football coach for the McKinley High Titans in the premiere episode, [...] "Audition". Beiste comes to William McKinley High with an enviable record of coaching successful football teams, and Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba) boosts the football program budget to support the new coach by reducing the cheerleading and glee club budgets, which alarms coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) and director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), respectively, and drives them into a temporary alliance against Beiste. <b>The</b> <b>coach</b> <b>is</b> dismayed by their rudeness, but forgives Will when he apologizes {{and goes on to}} develop a friendship with him. Beiste contemplates resigning as coach upon learning that several students have been fantasizing about Beiste in order to curb their arousal while making out. Will has the students apologize and earn Beiste's forgiveness. Will also learns that Beiste has never been kissed, which leads to him giving the coach a first kiss as a friendly gesture. Beiste later helps the glee club members preserve Brittany's (Heather Morris) continued belief in Santa Claus: disguised as Santa, Beiste explains to Brittany why her wish that paraplegic boyfriend Artie (Kevin McHale) be made to walk cannot be granted; later, Brittany anonymously receives a ReWalk to allow Artie to walk for short periods of time. When antagonism flares between the football team's glee and non-glee factions, Beiste forces the entire football team to work together with the glee club for one week; despite encountering resistance and set-backs, the plan is ultimately successful and the team wins the championship game. During the episode [...] "Blame It on the Alcohol", Beiste takes Will out for a fun time at a rodeo bar, which includes the character's first lead vocal performance on the show in the duet [...] "One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer".|$|E

2500|$|In cricket, coaches cannot {{intervene}} {{or direct}} gameplay; the captain must {{make all the}} calls once the players are out on the field. However, the coach may convey messages to the captain or the players at any time, {{since there is no}} restriction on signalling or speaking to players on the field. In dynamic situations, like a run chase with an imminent possibility of rain, it is quite common for coaches to update tactics using signals. Hansie Cronje, the former cricket captain of South Africa, once took the field with a wireless link to the coach, Bob Woolmer. Subsequently, the use of gadgets to transmit messages was banned by the International Cricket Council. Regardless, <b>the</b> <b>coach</b> <b>is</b> merely an adviser; it is almost always the case that the cricket captain has complete authority over the team once play starts. In baseball, by contrast, managers and coaches will often direct the players (through hand signals) to carry out a play (such as a stolen base or hit and run), or to field at a particular depth. In fact, [...] "stealing signs" [...] can play an important part in baseball strategy when a player on an opposing team tries to interpret hand signals between pitcher and catcher or between runner and base coach, and possibly then relay this information to another player without being themselves detected.|$|E
