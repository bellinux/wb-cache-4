500|$|Bowie Bonds, {{an early}} example of celebrity bonds, were asset-backed {{securities}} {{of current and}} future revenues of the 25 albums (287 songs) that Bowie recorded before 1990. Bowie Bonds were pioneered by rock and roll investment banker David Pullman. Issued in 1997, the bonds were bought for US$55 million by the Prudential Insurance Company of America. The bonds paid an interest rate of 7.9% and had an average life of ten years, {{a higher rate of}} return than a 10-year <b>Treasury</b> <b>note</b> (at the time, 6.37%). Royalties from the 25 albums generated the cash flow that secured the bonds' interest payments. Prudential also received guarantees from Bowie's label, EMI Records, which had recently signed a $30m deal with Bowie. By forfeiting ten years worth of royalties, Bowie received a payment of US$55million up front. Bowie used this income to buy songs owned by his former manager. Bowie's combined catalogue of albums covered by this agreement sold more than 1million copies annually {{at the time of the}} agreement. By March 2004, Moody's Investors Service lowered the bonds from an A3 rating (the seventh highest rating) to Baa3, one notch above junk status. The downgrade was prompted by lower-than-expected revenue [...] "due to weakness in sales for recorded music" [...] and that an unnamed company guaranteed the issue. Nonetheless, the bonds liquidated in 2007 as originally planned, without default, and the rights to the income from the songs reverted to Bowie.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>Treasury</b> <b>Note</b> {{was issued}} by the {{government}} to individuals selling silver bullion to the Treasury. Unlike other redemption notes like silver and gold certificates (which stipulated whether the note was backed by and redeemable for silver or gold coin, respectively), Treasury Notes stipulated only that they were redeemable in coin. This allowed the Treasury to fulfill the note's obligation in silver coin, gold coin, or both, at its discretion when the note was redeemed. This flexibility allowed the Treasury some control over releasing gold or silver when the relative value of the two metals fluctuated. The origin of the term [...] "Coin Note" [...] to describe the note is unclear [...] it may refer either to the coin it could be exchanged for, or derive {{from the fact that it}} was issued to pay for silver that would later be turned into coins.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Treasury</b> <b>Note</b> (also {{known as}} a Coin Note) was a type of {{representative}} money issued by the United States government from 1890 until 1893 under authority of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in denominations of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100 and $1000. [...] It was issued in two series: an 1890 series with $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $100 and $1000 denominations, and an 1891 series that added the $50 denomination. [...] A $500 note was designed but never issued. A distinguishing feature of the Series 1890 notes (and one that greatly appeals to collectors) is the extremely ornate designs on the reverse side of the notes. The intent of this was to make counterfeiting much more difficult, but opponents of the design argued that the extensive detail would {{make it more difficult}} to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit notes. Consequently, the reverse designs were simplified on the Series 1891 Treasury Notes issued the following year.|$|E

40|$|The issuing {{policy of}} the U. S. Treasury allows us to {{unambiguously}} isolate maturity-dependent liquidity premia in the Treasury market. We determine and analyze three term structures of liquidity premia obtained from observed yields of coupon STRIPS, observed yields of principal STRIPS, and synthetic yields derived via the bootstrapping of <b>Treasury</b> <b>notes</b> and bonds. Considering liquidity premia between coupon STRIPS and <b>Treasury</b> <b>notes,</b> we surprisingly find that short-term coupon STRIPS are more liquid than <b>Treasury</b> <b>notes</b> whereas long-term coupon STRIPS are less liquid. This structure is highly persistent and {{can be explained by}} stripping activity and volume, business uncertainty, and the Fed's monetary policy. In contrast, principal STRIPS do not trade at a significant yield difference relative to <b>Treasury</b> <b>notes.</b> Finally, we provide a liquidity-based explanation for the empirical puzzle that coupon and principal STRIPS with exactly the same cash flows trade at different yields...|$|R
