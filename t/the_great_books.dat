25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Books</b> are not {{the only}} texts used at St. John's. Greek and French classes make use of {{supplemental}} materials that are more like traditional textbooks. Science laboratory courses and mathematics courses use manuals prepared by faculty members that combine source materials with workbook exercises. For example, the mathematics tutorial combines a 1905 paper by Albert Einstein with exercises that require the student to work through the mathematics used in the paper.|$|E

25|$|At the Santa Fe campus, {{there is}} a program {{offering}} a Master of Arts in Eastern Classics (M.A.E.C.). This program is three semesters long and {{is designed to be}} completed in one 12-month period. The impetus for the program came with the recognition that the undergraduate program simply could not do justice to <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Books</b> of the three main Asian traditions (India, China and Japan) by trying to squeeze in a few works among so many European masterworks. The EC program therefore provides a full set of readings in the philosophical, religious and literary traditions of the three cultures listed above. Thus, students learn Chinese culture by reading not only Confucius, Laozi and Zhuangzi, but also Mencius, Xun Zi, Han Feizi, and Mozi, as well as historical narratives by Sima Qian and the Zuo Zhuan, the later movement of Neo-Confucianism and Zhu Xi, narrative works such as Journey to the West or the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and the great Chinese poets, Li Bai, Wang Wei and Du Fu. This list represents only one-third of the required corpus, which also covers the major teachings and branches of Hinduism and the development of Theravada, Mahayana and Zen Buddhism, as well as such literary masterpieces as the Mahabharata, Shakuntala, The Tale of Genji, The Narrow Road to the Deep North and others. Students also take a language, either Sanskrit or Classical Chinese.|$|E

Shimer has a dual-enrollment program with Harold Washington College, one of the few community colleges in the U.S. with a great-books program. The program allows HWC students to take a Shimer course, and is intended to encourage students to transfer to Shimer to complete their bachelor's degree. Whether these programs will continue at North Central is unknown.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Books</b> program (often called simply [...] "the Program" [...] or [...] "the New Program" [...] at St. John's) was {{developed}} at the University of Chicago by Stringfellow Barr, Scott Buchanan, Robert Hutchins, and Mortimer Adler in the mid-1930s as an alternative form of education to the then rapidly changing undergraduate curriculum. St. John's adopted <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Books</b> program in 1937, when the college was facing the possibility of financial and academic ruin. <b>The</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Books</b> program in use today was also influenced by Jacob Klein, who was {{dean of the college}} in the 1940s and 1950s.|$|E
