5|$|In the Greco-Roman {{world of}} Classical antiquity, Roman {{agriculture}} {{was built on}} techniques originally pioneered by the Sumerians, transmitted to them by subsequent cultures, with a specific emphasis on the cultivation of crops for trade and export. The Romans {{laid the groundwork for}} the manorial economic system, involving serfdom, which flourished in the Middle Ages. The farm sizes in Rome can be divided into three categories. Small farms were from 18-88 iugera (one iugerum is equal to about 0.65 acre). Medium-sized farms were from 80-500 iugera (singular iugerum). Large estates (called latifundia) were over 500 iugera. The Romans had four systems of farm management: direct work by owner and his family; slaves doing work under supervision of slave managers; <b>tenant</b> <b>farming</b> or sharecropping in which the owner and a tenant divide up a farm’s produce; and situations in which a farm was leased to a tenant.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{sharecropping}} {{system was}} primarily a post-Civil War development, it did exist in antebellum Mississippi, especially in the northeastern part of the state, an area with few slaves or plantations, and most likely existed in Tennessee.

25|$|In 1888, however, Rosetti and {{his entire}} family {{moved out of}} the manor, taking up {{residence}} in Târgu Ocna. Their new home was a townhouse once owned by Costache Negri. This move followed a long dispute over land between Rosetti and his sisters, with Radu taking over ownership of Răducăneni, and conceding his manor to Ana; both estates were running debts and were eventually resold, leaving Rosetti inconsolable to his death. He continued to pursue his agriculturalist dream, investing his settlement money (against Henrieta's advice) to take up <b>tenant</b> <b>farming</b> in Urdești, on land owned by George Diamandy.|$|E
25|$|The {{enormous}} {{cost of the}} Confederate {{war effort}} took a high toll on the South's economic infrastructure. The direct costs to the Confederacy in human capital, government expenditures, and physical destruction from the war totaled $3.3 billion. By 1865, the Confederate dollar was worthless due to high inflation, {{and people in the}} South had to resort to bartering services for goods, or else use scarce Union dollars. With the emancipation of the southern slaves, the entire economy of the South had to be rebuilt. Having lost their enormous investment in slaves, white planters had minimal capital to pay freedmen workers to bring in crops. As a result, a system of sharecropping was developed where landowners broke up large plantations and rented small lots to the freedmen and their families. The South was transformed from an elite minority of landed gentry slaveholders into a <b>tenant</b> <b>farming</b> agriculture system.|$|E
500|$|Rush divided his {{energies}} {{between his}} business ventures and his sculling contests, organising {{as well as}} competing in regattas and 'aquatic carnivals', so much so, that he never achieved the solid prosperity of other Clarence River commercial pioneers. He added the Criterion Hotel {{and a string of}} race-horses to his business 'empire' at Rocky Mouth. As a former farm-boy from impoverished Ireland, where he might never have owned even a house plot, Rush now purchased many acres of Clarence River land, much of it having little value. Rush's Irish background of <b>tenant</b> <b>farming</b> gave little understanding of managing capital, property, or conducting a business career.

2500|$|Before industrialization, [...] "yeoman farmers"—self-sufficient, {{politically}} independent landowners—made up a {{large portion}} of the country's population. Jeffersonian democracy and Jacksonian democracy successfully expanded the political rights of the yeomen, and the geographical extent of the nation to provide them farms. This culminated in the Homestead Act of 1862 which provided hundreds of thousands of free farms. Before 1865 large southern plantations used slaves. After emancipation, a system of sharecropping and <b>tenant</b> <b>farming</b> for both whites and blacks in the South provided a semi-independent status for farmers who did not own their land. In contemporary times, migrant agricultural workers—mostly Mexicans—perform field and packing work.|$|E
2500|$|The Great Depression of 1873, and {{subsequent}} farming depressions, {{and most importantly}} the growth of Egyptian cotton and Indian cotton pushed aside American cotton, which had previously provided the prosperity of the planter class. Although this decreased the demand and forced a change to crops such as corn, and wheat thereby restoring soil health, the new crops did not bring in enough wealth or traffic to the growers, merchant class, and railroad. [...] Still, the growers experimented with multi-crop rotation, schemes at sharecropping and <b>tenant</b> <b>farming,</b> and eventually earned valuable income from tobacco in later decades. [...] The number of plantations never recovered, yet, ironically several of the sharecroppers and tenant farmers managed to evolve into a yeoman farmers. However, the setbacks in economic markets and demand, domestic and foreign competition, all combined to keep the narrow gauge railroad from generating sufficient traffic and rebuilding the antebellum prosperity. [...] Ironically, it did succeed in returning the area to its 17th-century period of mixed economy, thereby allowing the continued survival and slow economic growth of the region.|$|E
