500|$|The {{main body}} of the tower is divided into the two-storey plinth, whose {{exterior}} is made of alpine limestone, and the three-storey <b>tower</b> <b>shaft</b> sheathed in sandstone. The shaft's seemingly massive corner blocks are decorative fixtures held in place by visible iron hooks. Below the roof, the cornice spans around the still-visible bases of the former corner towerlets. The two-story attic is covered by [...] the sweeping, red-tiled, late Gothic spire, in which two spire lights are set to the West and East. They are crowned by ornamental urns with pinecone knobs reconstructed in 1983 from 18th-century drawings.|$|E
500|$|The {{circular}} tower, [...] high {{from the}} ground to the lantern, is made of sandstone blocks laid in regular courses. The ground level has thicker walls, topped by a timber floor. The <b>tower</b> <b>shaft</b> tapers slightly toward the top, where the cast iron lantern sits. Entrance to the tower is either through a timber door on the ground level, or through a timber door {{on the top of}} the original 1857 external masonry staircase (with a modern 1990 handrail) that circles the first floor, leading to the first floor. Two horizontal bands are painted close to the top, and the tower is otherwise unpainted, showing the sandstone color. Both the ground floor and the lantern floor are made of concrete. Access {{from the ground}} floor to the lantern is first via a ladder leading to a trapdoor in the first floor, then via the original internal cast iron spiral stair, ending in a landing below the lantern, and finally another short ladder leading to a trapdoor in the lantern floor. The internal is painted, and lit by small square glass panels in timber frames.|$|E

50|$|The {{first known}} {{automotive}} application of toothed belts to drive overhead camshafts was with Devin-Panhard racing specials built by Bill Devin for the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) H-modified racing series.

The overhead camshafts on the Norton cylinders were driven by toothed belts from the Gilmer Belt Company {{instead of the}} <b>tower</b> <b>shafts</b> used in the Norton engines. Jimmy Orr won the 1956 SCCA H-modified championship in an overhead camshaft Devin-Panhard.|$|R

50|$|Construction of {{the tower}} began on August 9, 1966 and was {{completed}} in approximately 18 months, {{just in time for}} the opening ceremonies for the fair held on April 6, 1968. The tophouse of the building was constructed at ground level and hoisted to the top of the poured concrete shaft. As the tophouse was being hoisted into place, on October 30, 1967 some of the cables used to hoist it snapped, leaving it resting on and precariously tilted on the <b>Tower’s</b> <b>shaft.</b> Eventually, oil field pipes were used in lieu of cables to complete the job.|$|R
50|$|The {{third phase}} was the {{construction}} of the 'superstructure' which began in Mays 1994. The construction of the tower started with the erection of the <b>tower</b> <b>shaft,</b> then the tower head.

50|$|A {{water tower}} built in {{accordance}} with the Intze Principle has a brick shaft on which the water tank sits. The base of the tank is fixed with a ring anchor (Ringanker) made of iron or steel, so that only vertical, not horizontal, forces are transmitted to the tower. Due to the lack of horizontal forces the <b>tower</b> <b>shaft</b> {{does not need to be}} quite as solidly built.This type of design was used in Germany between 1885 and 1905.|$|E

5000|$|In 1889 {{the site}} was {{purchased}} for $60 by the prominent Unitarian minister Jenkin Lloyd Jones, {{a member of a}} well-known Welsh-American family in the region. He created a recreational and educational retreat called the Tower Hill Pleasure Company, which provided outdoor recreation, visiting lecturers, books, and music. The retreat grew to include 25 cottages, as well as a dining pavilion, tennis courts, and other structures. One 1894 lecturer, a history professor, spent his free time excavating the shot <b>tower's</b> <b>shaft</b> and recovered several pieces of equipment which Lloyd Jones donated to the Wisconsin Historical Society. [...] In 1911 Jones' nephew Frank Lloyd Wright began building his studio Taliesin on a neighboring hill.|$|R
50|$|Chrysler Building, New York (1981): 1930 {{building}} was {{originally intended to}} have a lighted glass dome; triangular windows in the metallic spire were equipped with lights, but not lighted until after the Depression and then only for holidays.

Lighting design: William Di Giacomo and Steve Negrin, William Di Giacomo Associates, based on William Van Alen designs.|$|E
50|$|Construction {{work had}} in fact already started on September 21, 1970, when {{excavation}} for the foundation was begun. The slip form method of construction, whereby concrete is poured into forms continuously moving upwards, was recommended and used in constructing the <b>tower</b> <b>shaft.</b> The slip form began on November 4, 1970, and was finished on November 20, 1970. Other aspects of the work proceeded with similar celerity, and the tower was completed and fully operational by the following summer. It was officially opened {{at the beginning of}} June 1971.|$|E
50|$|The new roof {{shingles}} of {{the bell}} tower consist of radially to the root-derived spruce wood, which has been pressure treated prior to assembly. The shingles {{were placed on the}} hexagonal spire and the <b>tower</b> <b>shaft</b> offset strengthened with 0.8 mm thin lead plates, so-called nouques. The shingles were painted with the color Caput Mortuum V (Violet), based on the color analysis on the roof turret itself, on research in the city archives and based on color of the tower of the church and the sandstone used in the choir.|$|E

50|$|The tower basket {{accommodates}} transmission {{mechanisms for}} Frequency modulation, DAB, UMTS, pager, amateur radio and a microwave radio relay link and - closed since 1991 - a rotating restaurant and a prospect platform. Responsible operator is the DFMG Deutsche Funkturm (German radio tower) GmbH, {{a subsidiary of}} Deutsche Telekom based in Münster. From 22 January 2003 to 4 April 2003 the Nürnberg telecommunication tower also served for the spreading of the program of megaradio on mediumwave frequency 945 kHz. For this a wire antenna was strung along the <b>tower</b> <b>shaft,</b> {{from the top of}} the tower to the roof of an operating building near the tower.|$|E
50|$|The {{main body}} of the {{supporting}} shaft was built up by slip forming. Around it, the water tank was constructed in prestressed concrete at ground level: Stiffness is provided by 0.35 m thick walls, which subdivide it into sixteen sectors. The 0.30 m thick tank bottom is angled at 17° to the horizontal, the top surface is shallower. The container was raised into its final position by cables: once in position the lifting cables were used to support the tank body from the ring beam on the shaft, being tensioned within concrete columns. Finally the base of the tank was concreted to the <b>tower</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The tower rises as an open shaft lined by {{circular}} balconies {{overlooking the}} central space. Access from balcony to balcony {{is provided by}} small stairways. At the top the space is decked over, creating an enclosed observation level with large glazed windows. An open observation area {{on the roof of}} this space is now closed to visitors and is used for radio equipment. The steel and concrete structure of the observation level is concealed behind plaster, stone and wood. The tower is decorated by bold murals by Fred Kabotie, with other, petroglyph-style decorations by Fred Greer. Small windows in the <b>tower's</b> <b>shaft</b> let beams of light into the lower space. [...] The tower also features a number of [...] "reflectoscopes" [...] — black mirrors to reflect the view of the canyon in a more abstract style, providing visitors an alternative view of the Canyon.|$|R
