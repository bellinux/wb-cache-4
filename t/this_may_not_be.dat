5|$|Bolton is {{a common}} Northern English name derived from the Old English bothl-tun, meaning a {{settlement}} with a dwelling. The first recorded use of the name, in the form Boelton, dates from 1185 to describe Bolton le Moors, though <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> {{in relation to a}} dwelling. It was recorded as Bothelton in 1212, Botelton in 1257, Boulton in 1288, and Bolton after 1307.|$|E

5|$|An {{alternative}} {{view is that}} it is not {{the formal}} structure of the Council – which in theory is capable of exercising judicial, legislative and review functions – but the presence of a practically single-party Parliament that drastically undermines the PCMR's powers, restricting it solely to an advisory capacity. <b>This</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> the case if a strong Opposition exists in Parliament to obstruct the mustering of the required two-thirds voting majority required to push through legislation without the endorsement of the Council.|$|E
5|$|While {{the initial}} steer torque and steer angle are both {{opposite}} the desired turn direction, <b>this</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>be</b> {{the case to}} maintain a steady-state turn. The sustained steer angle is usually {{in the same direction}} as the turn, but may remain opposite to the direction of the turn, especially at high speeds. The sustained steer torque required to maintain that steer angle is usually opposite the turn direction. The actual magnitude and orientation of both the sustained steer angle and sustained steer torque of a particular bike in a particular turn depend on forward speed, bike geometry, tire properties, and combined bike and rider mass distribution. Once in a turn, the radius can only be changed with an appropriate change in lean angle, and this can be accomplished by additional countersteering out of the turn to increase lean and decrease radius, then into the turn to decrease lean and increase radius. To exit the turn, the bike must again countersteer, momentarily steering more into the turn in order to decrease the radius, thus increasing inertial forces, and thereby decreasing the angle of lean.|$|E
