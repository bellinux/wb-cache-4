5|$|Soon after Washington's {{orders were}} delivered, a British raiding party under George Collier and Edward Mathew arrived in Virginia to capture or destroy {{supplies}} <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>be</b> sent southward {{to aid the}} reinforcements going to South Carolina. Scott's orders changed again; the Virginia House of Delegates ordered him to immediately prepare defenses against Collier and Mathew's raids. When {{it became clear to}} both the legislature and Washington that Collier and Mathew intended only to raid supplies, not to invade, they concluded that the local militia would be able to sufficiently protect Virginia's interests and that Scott should continue to recruit men to reinforce the south. The legislators presented him with a horse, a firearm, and 500 pounds sterling for his quick response to the threat.|$|E
5|$|While {{developing}} Fast Five, Universal Studios deliberately {{departed from}} the street racing theme prevalent in previous films in the series, to transform the franchise into a heist action series involving cars. By doing so, they hoped to attract wider audiences <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>be</b> put off by a heavy emphasis on cars and car culture. Fast Five is considered the transitional film in the series, featuring only one car race and giving more attention to action set pieces such as gun fights, brawls, and the heist of $100million. The production mounted a comprehensive marketing campaign, marketing the film through social media, virtual games, cinema chains, automobile manufacturers, and at NASCAR races.|$|E

25|$|The blood–brain barrier (BBB) {{is formed}} by the brain {{capillary}} endothelium and excludes from the brain ∼100% of large-molecule neurotherapeutics and more than 98% of all small-molecule drugs. Overcoming the difficulty of delivering therapeutic agents to specific regions of the brain presents a major challenge to treatment of most brain disorders. In its neuroprotective role, the blood–brain barrier functions to hinder the delivery of many potentially important diagnostic and therapeutic agents to the brain. Therapeutic molecules and antibodies <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>be</b> effective in diagnosis and therapy do not cross the BBB in adequate amounts.|$|E
25|$|This rate, derived for the SIR model at equilibrium, is {{equivalent}} to the rate of coalescence given by the more general formula provided by Volz et al. Rates of coalescence can similarly be derived for epidemiological models with superspreaders or other transmission heterogeneities, for models with individuals who are exposed but not yet infectious, and for models with variable infectious periods, among others. Given some epidemiological information (such as the duration of infection) and a specification of a mathematical model, viral phylogenies can therefore be used to estimate epidemiological parameters <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>be</b> difficult to quantify.|$|E

25|$|The {{war began}} in January 1767 when the Marathas, {{possibly}} anticipating movements by the nizam, invaded northern Mysore.

In exchange for payments of 30 lakhs rupees the Marathas agreed to withdraw north of the Kistna River; by March, when the nizam began his invasion, they had already withdrawn. According to Mysore historian Mark Wilks, this action by the Marathas was a somewhat typical move to acquire wealth <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>be</b> claimed by other belligerents. The nizam advanced as far as Bangalore, accompanied by two battalions of company troops under Colonel Joseph Smith.|$|E
25|$|Lobbying, a {{standard}} method used to influence or change {{a piece of}} legislation, is a common practice {{at all levels of}} legislature, including the United States Congress and local legislation. In the U.S., direct lobbying involves direct methods used by a lobbyist when attempting to influence a legislative body. It is done either through direct communication with members or employees of the legislative body, or with a government official who participates in formulating legislation. During the direct lobbying process, the lobbyist introduces statistics that will inform the legislator of any recent information <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>be</b> missed, makes political threats or promises, and supply favors. A common use of direct lobbying is to persuade the general public about a ballot proposal. In this case, the public is considered to be the legislator. This aspect of direct lobbying attempts to alter the legislature before it is placed on the ballot. Communications regarding a ballot measure are also considered direct lobbying. Direct lobbying is different from grassroots lobbying, a process that uses direct communication with the general public, who in turn, contacts and influences the government. Washington, D.C. is the home to many firms that employ these strategies, with 11,140 registered lobbyists currently residing in the area.|$|E

500|$|Law {{enforcement}} officers may also conduct warrantless searches in {{several types of}} exigent circumstances where obtaining a warrant is dangerous or impractical. One example is the Terry stop, which allows police to frisk suspects for weapons. The Court also allowed a search of arrested persons in Weeks v. United States (1914) to preserve evidence <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>be</b> destroyed and to ensure suspects were disarmed. In Carroll v. United States (1925), the Court ruled that law {{enforcement officers}} could search a vehicle that they suspected of carrying contraband without a warrant. The Court allowed blood to be drawn without a warrant from drunk-driving suspects in Schmerber v. California (1966) {{on the grounds that}} the time to obtain a warrant would allow a suspect's blood alcohol content to reduce, although this was later modified by Missouri v. McNeely (2013). Warden v. Hayden (1967) provided an exception to the warrant requirement if officers were in [...] "hot pursuit" [...] of a suspect.|$|E
500|$|The same year, Garfield co-starred {{opposite}} Jesse Eisenberg in The Social Network, a drama {{based on}} the founders of Facebook.

Of course, the fact he's a real-life human being, breathing on this Earth somewhere, creates a whole new dimension to my approach because you feel {{a greater sense of}} responsibility". Initially, the film's director, David Fincher, had met Garfield under the auspices of him playing Mark Zuckerberg, having been referred to him by Mark Romanek. However, Fincher did not like Garfield for the part as he found Garfield's [...] "incredible emotional access to his kind of core humanity" [...] better tailored for the role of Saverin. Garfield's performance was very well received; he earned wider recognition and numerous nominations, including BAFTA nominations for Best Actor in a Supporting Role and Rising Star, as well as a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance in a Supporting Role. Mark Kermode of the BBC expressed his surprise that Garfield had been overlooked for an Academy Award nomination, opining that [...] "everyone knows he's one of the very best things about the Social Network". Writing in The Wall Street Journal, Joe Morgenstern thought the role was portrayed with [...] "great subtlety and rueful charm". Rolling Stone said Garfield delivered [...] "a vulnerability that raises the emotional stakes in a movie", and proclaimed: [...] "Keep your eyes on Garfield — he's shatteringly good, the soul of a film <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>be</b> without one." [...] He received similar plaudits of the Los Angeles Times, Entertainment Weekly, and The New Yorker.|$|E
500|$|... 808s & Heartbreak is {{a radical}} {{departure}} from West's previous hip hop albums. According to 33⅓ writer Kirk Walker Graves, 808s & Heartbreak is an avant-garde electropop album. Rolling Stone magazine called it an [...] "introspective, synthpop album," [...] while The 405 described it as West's [...] "experimental pop record." [...] According to The Independent, West abandoned his customary hip hop sound in favor of sparse, drum machine-based electropop. Pitchforks Scott Plagenhoef also categorized the album as [...] "an introspective, minimal electro-pop record", but added that it is [...] "steeped in regret, pain, and even more self-examination than a typical Kanye West album". Music writer Robert Christgau called it a [...] "slow, sad-ass and self-involved ... breakup album" [...] and analyzed that West's choice to [...] "robotize as well as pitch-correct his voice both undercuts his self-importance and adds physical reality to tales of alienated fame <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>be</b> pure pity parties". Christgau asserted that its final track [...] "Pinocchio Story" [...] is [...] "the only track here about what's really bringing [...] down: not the loss of his girlfriend but the death of his mother, during cosmetic surgery that somewhere not too deep down he's sure traces all too directly to his alienated fame." [...] Andre Grant of HipHopDX wrote that [...] "to combat this trenchant melancholia, he poured himself into an all-autotunes R album" [...] which would prove divisive in hip hop. West's singing has been characterized as [...] "flat" [...] and [...] "nearly unmelodic" [...] which [...] "underscores his own cyborgish detachment." [...] Canadian writer Stephen Marche viewed that West used [...] "the shallow musical gimmickry of Auto-Tune, a program designed to eliminate individuality, and produced a hauntingly personal album." ...|$|E

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 75, based on 36 reviews. Chris Richards from The Washington Post called it [...] "an information-age masterpiece", while USA Today critic Steve Jones said [...] "West deftly uses the 808 drum machine and Auto-Tune vocal effect to channel his feelings of hurt, anger and doubt through his well-crafted lyrics". Dan Cairns from The Times stated, [...] "This so should not work...Yet 808s & Heartbreak is a triumph, recklessly departing from the commercially copper-bottomed script and venturing far beyond West’s comfort zone." [...] Rolling Stones Jody Rosen commended West's {{incorporation of the}} Roland TR-808 drum machine and described the album as [...] "Kanye's would-be Here, My Dear or Blood on the Tracks, a mournful song-suite that swings violently between self-pity and self-loathing". In the Chicago Tribune, Greg Kot called it West's [...] "most radical yet" [...] and said while West's fans may be disappointed, [...] "this one is for him. It {{remains to be seen}} if he goes back to making records for everybody else. For now, this is one fascinatingly perverse detour." [...] PopMatters critic Dave Heaton was impressed by West's [...] "song and album construction, and with the way he captures a particular feeling through unusual, evocative, carefully crafted music that’s both simple and complex, cold and warm, mechanical and human, melodic and harsh". Writing for MSN Music, Robert Christgau found it [...] "brilliant" [...] with a unique [...] "dark sound" [...] and [...] "engaging tunes", despite a second-half drop-off, and praised West's use of Auto-Tune, which he felt [...] "both undercuts his self-importance and adds physical reality to tales of alienated fame <b>that</b> <b>might</b> <b>otherwise</b> <b>be</b> pure pity parties".|$|E
