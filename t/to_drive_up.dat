5|$|Bud devises a plan <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>up</b> Bluestar's stock before {{manipulating}} it back down. He and {{the other}} union presidents then secretly meet with Wildman and arrange for him to buy controlling interest in Bluestar at a significant discount. Gekko, realizing that his stock is plummeting, dumps his remaining interest in the company on Bud's advice. However, when Gekko learns {{on the evening news}} that Wildman is buying Bluestar, he realizes that Bud engineered the entire scheme. Bud triumphantly goes back to work at Jackson Steinem the following day, only to be arrested for insider trading.|$|E
5|$|Episodes of {{the show}} are also {{available}} online for download: Amazon Video on Demand, iTunes Store and the Zune Marketplace offer episodes from all of seasons 1 through 8. In 2007, NBCUniversal (the show's distributor) and Apple Inc. (iTunes' owner) had a disagreement that temporarily kept the fourth season off iTunes. In {{a statement to the}} press, Apple claimed that NBCUniversal wanted <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>up</b> the per-episode price to $4.99. In September 2008, it was reported that the issue between Apple and NBC had been resolved. Episodes can now also be purchased in HD on iTunes for $2.99. Recent episodes are available in streaming video on Fox's official House webpage and all 8 seasons are now on Netflix DVD.|$|E
5|$|In July 1942 the Royal Navy {{formed the}} Future Building Committee, chaired by the Deputy First Sea Lord, {{to examine the}} fleet's {{requirements}} {{for the rest of}} the war. Tasked with anticipating the Navy's readiness and requirements for January 1944, the committee realised that a major expansion of naval aviation was required, which meant that more aircraft carriers would be needed. Many factors combined <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>up</b> the size of these new carriers, notably the increasing size and speed of aircraft and the desire to increase the numbers of aircraft aboard fleet carriers. Another important consideration was the change in carrier tactics from the earlier doctrine of more attacks with smaller numbers of aircraft to the use of large, single airstrikes.|$|E

25|$|Proponents of {{healthcare}} reforms involving expansion of government involvement to achieve universal healthcare {{argue that the}} need to provide profits to investors in a predominantly free market health system, and the additional administrative spending, tends <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>up</b> costs, leading to more expensive provision.|$|E
25|$|The Recyclate Quality Action Plan of Scotland {{sets out}} a number of {{proposed}} actions that the Scottish Government would like to take forward in order <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>up</b> the quality of the materials being collected for recycling and sorted at materials recovery facilities before being exported or sold on to the reprocessing market.|$|E
25|$|The aim of {{creating}} these 'pro-teams' or 'super-teams' was ensure that Scotland had fairly competitive sides {{operating in the}} European competitions, the Heineken Cup and European Challenge Cup (as well as the European Shield during its short existence), and <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>up</b> standards of rugby in the country including developing players for the national side.|$|E

25|$|Many {{residents}} of Big Sur {{object to the}} rentals. They claim short term rentals violate the Big Sur Local Use Plan which prohibits establishing facilities that attract destination traffic. Short term rentals also remove scarce residences from the rental market and are likely <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>up</b> demand {{and the cost of}} housing. About half of the {{residents of}} Big Sur rent their residences.|$|E
25|$|Bourque {{was also}} popular among Bruins fans {{because of his}} {{willingness}} to re-sign with Boston without any acrimonious or lengthy negotiations. He passed over several opportunities to set the benchmark salary for defenceman; instead, he usually quietly and quickly agreed {{to terms with the}} Bruins, and this stance irritated the National Hockey League Players' Association, which had been pushing <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>up</b> players' wages.|$|E

50|$|In December {{a fellow}} monk allowed Merton {{to take the}} monastery jeep out on the {{property}} for a drive.

He opposed the monopoly of the grain merchants, formed <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>up</b> prices. This made him enemies. Also in his first year, he founded a chair of surgery at the University. This chair was first occupied by the Mexican-born doctor Cristóbal Hidalgo y Bandabal (d. 1660).|$|E
25|$|In 2005 Bradfield College was one {{of fifty}} of the country's leading {{independent}} schools which were found guilty of running an illegal price-fixing cartel which had allowed them <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>up</b> fees for thousands of parents. Each school was required to pay a nominal penalty of £10,000 and all agreed to make ex-gratia payments totalling three million pounds into a trust designed to benefit pupils who attended the schools during the period in respect of which fee information was shared.|$|E
25|$|All Muni lines {{except for}} cable cars are {{wheelchair}} accessible. All bus lines have bicycle racks, but streetcars and cable cars do not. Because of San Francisco's geographical makeup (the city having neighborhoods located on hilltop-like areas, {{making it difficult}} for vehicles <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>up</b> or down the streets), Muni operators are banned from using low-floor buses on certain routes with streets requiring buses or trolleybuses that are capable of reaching steep grades. But, as of 2013, high-floor vehicles are no longer available to be purchased by Muni; come 2019, all low-floor ones will be in service.|$|E

25|$|As the Batman {{films were}} {{handed over to}} {{director}} Joel Schumacher from Tim Burton, the design for the Batmobile updated. Decorative lighting {{was added to the}} vehicle's rims, sides and front edge, and the wing-shaped fins reached further into the air. The car had a couple of unique features, such as: being able to rotate its wheels through 90 degrees so that it could move in a perpendicular direction; a grappling hook allowing the Batmobile <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>up</b> walls; the speed to perform large jumps from surface to surface during chases across Gotham City's elevated freeways and gigantic statues.|$|E
25|$|In 1594, the Compagnie van Verre ("Company of Far Lands") {{was founded}} in Amsterdam, {{with the aim of}} sending two fleets to the spice islands of Maluku. The first fleet sailed in 1596 and {{returned}} in 1597 with a cargo of pepper, which more than covered the costs of the voyage. The second voyage (1598–1599), returned its investors a 400% profit. The success of these voyages led to the founding of a number of companies competing for the trade. The competition was counterproductive to the companies' interests as it threatened <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>up</b> the price of spices at their source in Indonesia whilst driving them down in Europe.|$|E
25|$|A {{job where}} there are many workers willing to work {{a large amount of}} time (high supply) {{competing}} for a job that few require (low demand) will result in a low wage for that job. This is because competition between workers drives down the wage. An example of this would be jobs such as dish-washing or customer service. Competition amongst workers tends to drive down wages due to the expendable nature of the worker in relation to his or her particular job. A job {{where there are}} few able or willing workers (low supply), but a large need for the positions (high demand), will result in high wages for that job. This is because competition between employers for employees will drive up the wage. Examples of this would include jobs that require highly developed skills, rare abilities, or a high level of risk. Competition amongst employers tends <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>up</b> wages {{due to the nature of}} the job, since there is a relative shortage of workers for the particular position. Professional and labor organizations may limit the supply of workers which results in higher demand and greater incomes for members. Members may also receive higher wages through collective bargaining, political influence, or corruption.|$|E

500|$|In September 1869, {{financial}} manipulators Jay Gould and Jim Fisk set up {{an elaborate}} scam to corner the gold market through buying up all the gold {{at the same time}} <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>up</b> the price. The plan was to keep the Government from selling gold, thus driving its price. [...] President Grant and Secretary of Treasury George S. Boutwell found out about the gold market speculation and ordered the sale of $4million in gold on (Black) Friday, September 23. [...] Gould and Fisk were thwarted, and the price of gold dropped. The effects of releasing the gold by Boutwell were disastrous. Stock prices plunged and food prices dropped, devastating farmers for years.|$|E
500|$|Plans for the Whiteface Mountain Highway {{surfaced}} in 1929, and a bid of $687,572.50 (1931USD) was submitted {{to construct the}} new roadway two years later. The final plans called for an , [...] wide highway climbing [...] in elevation with grade changes of 810%. A toll of $1 for each car and its driver and $1 for each additional passenger would be charged <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>up</b> the new highway. Construction started in 1931, with crews working until near Christmas when snowfall impeded their progress. Work on the parkway resumed on March15, 1932. The new stone walls guarding the new highway cost about $100,000 (1931USD) to construct. The highway opened to traffic on July20, 1935.|$|E
500|$|As a young man, Cagney became {{interested}} in farming – sparked by a soil conservation lecture he had attended – {{to the extent that}} during his first walkout from Warner Bros., he helped to found a [...] farm in Martha's Vineyard. Cagney loved that no concrete roads surrounded the property, only dirt tracks. The house was rather run-down and ramshackle, and Billie was initially reluctant to move in, but soon came to love the place, as well. After being inundated by movie fans, Cagney sent out a rumor that he had hired a gunman for security. The ruse proved so successful that when Spencer Tracy came to visit, his taxi driver refused <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> <b>up</b> to the house, saying, [...] "I hear they shoot!" [...] Tracy had to go {{the rest of the way}} on foot.|$|E
50|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, older {{students}} became {{frustrated with the}} curfews and entry restrictions in the dormitories, and drove demand for unregulated apartments in Isla Vista. Very aggressive developers built apartments to meet the demand, and successfully lobbied County Supervisors <b>to</b> <b>drive</b> down the requirements for parking places associated with the apartments, and <b>to</b> further <b>drive</b> <b>up</b> the density of dwelling units. At the same time, efforts to unify the owners of commercially zoned property around the Embarcadero Loop failed, leaving issues of coordinated business development and parking for commercial customers unresolved.|$|R
