40|$|AbstractRecently, much {{attention}} has been paid to the reliability and vulnerability of critical infrastructure. In air traffic systems, the vulnerability analysis for <b>airport</b> <b>networks</b> can be used to guide air traffic administrations in their prioritization of the maintenance and repair of airports, as well as to avoid unnecessary disturbances in the planning of flight schedules. In this paper, the evaluation methods of <b>airport</b> importance and <b>network</b> efficiency are established. Firstly, the evaluation indices of airport importance are proposed from both the topological and functional perspectives. The topological characteristics come from the structure of <b>airport</b> <b>network</b> and the functional features stem from the traffic flow distribution taking place inside the network. Secondly, an integrated evaluation method based on fuzzy soft set theory is proposed to identify the key airports, which can fuse together importance indices over different time intervals. Thirdly, an <b>airport</b> <b>network</b> efficiency method is established for the purpose of assessing the accuracy of the evaluation method. Finally, empirical studies using real traffic data of US and China’s <b>airport</b> <b>networks</b> show that the evaluation method proposed in this paper is the most accurate. The vulnerability of US and China’s <b>airport</b> <b>networks</b> is compared. The similarities and differences between airport geography distribution and airport importance distribution are discussed here and the dynamics of airport importance is studied as well...|$|R

40|$|Estimating the {{capacity}} of an <b>airport</b> <b>network</b> system, a known NP–Hard problem, is defined as estimating the maximum traffic that can be accommodated by the system subject to resource constraints, such as fleet mix and node/link capacity. The capacity of an <b>airport</b> <b>network</b> has traditionally been measured at individual elements of the network, such as at links (airway routes) between any two airports and at nodes (runway throughput). These measures do not generalize to estimate the overall <b>airport</b> <b>network</b> system–level capacity. Mathematically, the problem can be modelled as a classical multi-commodity flow (MCF) problem as being widely done in communication networks, water distribution systems, and electric power systems. However, {{one of the key}} requirements of existing algorithms to solve an MCF problem is that a resource required by the commodities at a node or link needs to be static (cannot change overtime) and must be independent of the mixing/interaction among the commodities. However, in any <b>airport</b> <b>network,</b> the local resource requirements for different aircrafts usually change over time due to different weather condition and runway configurations. Further, different aircraft mix (heavy, medium, light) changes resource requirements. In addition, in a given <b>airport</b> <b>network,</b> the flow requires {{a certain amount of time}} to travel through each link and can’t be assumed to travel instantaneously through the network as in the case of an electricity network. These complexities deem existing MCF algorithms inapplicable to estimate the flow capacity of an <b>airport</b> <b>network.</b> In this paper, we propose a new method to estimate an <b>airport</b> <b>network</b> capacity. We inherit the classical MCF problem concept to formulate {{the capacity}} estimation problem of an <b>airport</b> <b>network</b> as an optimization problem. In our formulation, flows between two nodes (airports) are considered as different commodities and the local airport capacity is formulated using a time slot of one hour where the hourly rate of flow (landings and takeoffs) is bounded by a capacity constraint. We call this Dynamic Multi-Commodity Flow Optimization Algorithm. The optimization algorithm is augmented by an iterative hill climber to solve the network capacity model in which all flow constraints of air traffic are preserved. The proposed model and algorithm are applied to different test networks; numerical results have revealed that the proposed model is not only capable of realistically estimating the network capacity under different levels of aircraft mix, but also identifying individual flows at different links and amount of delay for each and every aircraft. Different from the conventional algorithms for MCF problem that provide only the maximum achievable flow, the proposed model not only provides the network capacity but also provides details on the flow (the actual number and mix of aircrafts: light, medium and heavy) ...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{dynamics}} of both {{an economic and}} sector-specific nature have made national <b>airport</b> <b>networks</b> an essential element to attract new tourist flows. However, such networks have to made suitably accessible and must be linked to interchange hubs as what counts {{is not only the}} time/cost of the main travel link, but the whole trip from its origin to its most widespread destinations. Faced with such needs, many Western countries have long made provisions to offer high levels of service to ensure access to stable tourist flows and their related revenues. The latter are a key launch pad for the whole economy, in line with the established trend in more developed countries of ever-increasing economic weight of the service sector. Italy has several opportunities to reap the benefits of this sector: it is possible to combine different types of tourist flows, exploiting a wide range of resources, ranging from culture to nature, history and landscape. For such development to occur, Italy has to rationalise the distribution of the <b>airport</b> <b>network</b> nationwide, its use, the connections with other transport modes, endowments and accessibility of the same airports. This chapter aims to investigate the current situation of Italy’s <b>airport</b> <b>network.</b> The analysis was carried out by using secondary sources chiefly based on air traffic data for the year 2011 as well as the results of recent studies on the air transport sector in Italy. The findings highlight a number of issues which prevent the effective use of the <b>airport</b> <b>network</b> to support tourist flows as well as potentials for development.

40|$|Abstract. Recently, we have {{presented}} the first exhaustive {{analysis of the}} world-wide <b>airport</b> <b>network.</b> Two important results of that study are that: (i) the world-wide <b>airport</b> <b>network</b> is a small-world network with power-law decaying degree and betweenness centrality distributions; (ii) the most connected cities (largest degree) are typically not the most central cities (largest betweenness centrality). This second finding is particularly significant because of results demonstrating that nodes with high betweenness tend to play a more important role in keeping networks connected than those with high degree. Here, we investigate if current network models can explain this finding and we show that they cannot. Thus, we propose a new model that explains this behavior {{in terms of the}} geo-political constraints that affect the growth of the <b>airport</b> <b>network.</b> We further hypothesize that in other infrastructures, affected by similar geo-political constraints, critical locations might not coincide with highly-connected hubs.

One of the alternative solutions for this problem is to evaluate the hub-and-spoke <b>airport</b> <b>networks.</b> Hub-and-spoke <b>airport</b> <b>networks</b> enable carriers to supply transport services to many combinations of origin and destination zones at high frequencies and low costs. The disadvantage for the traveller is of course {{that they have to}} make a detour via the hub airport implying an extra stop. For many combinations of origin and destination zone, travellers can choose between more than one main carrier and airport. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analysis of hub-and-spoke <b>airport</b> <b>networks</b> in Java Island based on cargo volume and freight ratio. Based on freight ratio value, airport can be classified in four types: full passenger airport, freight interest airport, freight specialist airport, and mixed passenger and freight airport. This study shows that the flight route in Indonesia has not been fully developed in accordance with the concept of hubs-and-spokes. All of the six airports in Java Island (Soekarno-Hatta Airport Jakarta, Juanda Airport Surabaya, Adi Sucipto Airport Yogyakarta, Adi Sumarmo Airport Surakarta, Husein Sastranegara Airport Bandung, and Ahmad Yani Airport Semarang) for the domestic and international flight include in mixed passenger and freight airport type. Soekarno-Hatta Airport has the highest of freight ratio value, 8. 128 for domestic flight and 24. 738 for international flight. The percentage of cargo volume in Soekarno-Hatta Airport is 71. 898 % for domestic flight and 93. 330 % for international flight.

40|$|Air {{transportation}} {{is a complex}} system of interlinked distributed networks in which different components have their own constraints and performance measures. For example, an <b>airport</b> <b>network</b> in which each airport is treated as a node and models the departures/arrivals of flights as links considers capacity as its limiting factor. Whereas, an airspace network that consists of airways (as links) and waypoints (as nodes) providing an orderly flow of air traffic and safe separation between flights considers collision risk as its limiting factor. To accommodate the increasing demand to safely manage air traffic flow, {{it is imperative to}} understand the interactions between these two components and the limiting factors that define their characteristics. Understanding this relationship is a major consideration when determining whether and which components should aim to increase safety and capacity. In this thesis, I propose a model for <b>airport</b> <b>network</b> capacity estimation and a model of airspace network risk analysis. I then develop a framework for modelling and integrating <b>airport</b> and airspace <b>networks</b> in an overall air transportation system. Finally, I propose a methodology for determining their complex interactions to analyse the relationship between capacity and safety. One challenge in analysing the capacity-safety relationship for air {{transportation is}} measuring its capacity. In air transportation, capacities have traditionally been measured based on the individual elements of the network, such as links (sector capacity and airspace complexity) and nodes (terminals and runway throughput). These measures obviously do not constitute the overall system-level capacity of a network. This research involves developing a network-level capacity estimation model and method. The proposed model does not require knowledge of an individual airport's capacity and offers an understanding {{of the relationship between the}} flow capacity and safety metric of its corresponding airspace. Experimental and empirical results establish the nature of the relationship between <b>airport</b> <b>network</b> capacity and airspace safety when considered in an interacting air transport system. As the hourly flow increases in the <b>airport</b> <b>network,</b> the overall collision risk increases linearly and, after a certain level, crosses the target level of safety. Such a capacity-safety relationship indicates that the capability of existing air traffic control systems to safely handle projected growth in aircraft operations appears to be artificially limited by the airspace...|$|R
