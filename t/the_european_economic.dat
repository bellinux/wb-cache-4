In 2002, the Treaty of Paris expired and the ECSC ceased to exist in any form, its activities fully absorbed by the European Community under the framework of Amsterdam and Nice treaties.|$|E

5|$|With Norway joining <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> Area, the Norwegian airline {{market was}} {{deregulated}} from 1 April 1994. While airlines formerly needed a concession from the Ministry of Transport {{to fly a}} particular route, they could now compete freely on any domestic or international routes. Previously the two major airlines Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and Braathens SAFE each had their own routes, but from 1994 both established themselves on several of the main-haul routes.|$|E
5|$|Despite this, <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> Community and Euratom were {{established}} in 1958 by the Treaties of Rome. The Common Assembly was shared by all three communities (which had separate executives) and it renamed itself the European Parliamentary Assembly. The first meeting was held on 19 March 1958 having been set up in Luxembourg, it elected Schuman as its president and on 13 May it rearranged itself to sit according to political ideology rather than nationality. This {{is seen as the}} birth of the modern European Parliament, with Parliament's 50 years celebrations being held in March 2008 rather than 2002.|$|E

5|$|Dormand opposed Britain's {{membership}} of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> Community (EEC), {{and at the}} time of the referendum on EEC membership in 1975 he was an advocate for the United Kingdom leaving the EEC and rejoining the European Free Trade Association. His main work in opposition was as a member of select committee on nationalised industries, where his knowledge and inquisitorial skills won him the respect of the committee's left-wing chair Ian Mikardo. In February 1972 he called for employment for miners who had been made redundant, and became Secretary of the Parliamentary Labour Party's Northern Group in 1973.|$|E
5|$|Following Norway joining <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> Area (EEA), {{the airline}} {{industry}} was deregulated, allowing any airline from any EEA member country to make domestic or international flights to Norway. However, by 1994 there was no available slots at Fornebu during the morning and evening rush hours, {{limiting the number of}} new routes that could be established. After the deregulation, Fornebu could not offer slots to new airlines, and SAS and Braathens could not establish as many competing routes as they wanted to. However, domestic services were provided by both SAS and Braathens SAFE to Stavanger, Bergen, Trondheim, Bodø, Harstad/Narvik, Tromsø and Longyearbyen. The remaining domestic airports were only served by the incumbent. In addition, Teddy Air offered services to Fagernes.|$|E

As of December 2011, Hungary and Croatia have 96 treaties and agreements in force regulating {{a wide range of}} activities and relations (including diplomatic, cultural, economic, energy, transport, education, minority and other issues). Furthermore, Hungary supported the Croatian NATO membership request and Croatian accession to the European Union.|$|E

5|$|In 1956, the British and French prime ministers, Sir Anthony Eden and Guy Mollet, {{discussed}} {{the possibility of}} France joining the Commonwealth.

In November 1956, Britain and France invaded Egypt in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to capture the Suez Canal.

5|$|In {{the weeks}} {{following}} the floods, the Pan American Health Organization provided $10,000 worth of water supply units {{and a group}} of six workers, and offices within the United Nations provided $55,000 worth of contributions.

The government of Canada provided $142,490 worth of aid, and the government of West Germany donated $21,740. The British Red Cross and the United Kingdom government collectively donated $302,850 to the country, mostly for 3helicopters to transport relief and medical teams. The California Air National Guard flew three trips of supplies, including 2,000cots, to Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|Independence from Europe {{has called}} for stricter {{immigration}} policy to be implemented in the UK, but has refused to set a statistical migration target. It supports an 'Australian-style' points-based system to regulate immigration once the UK has left <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> Area (EEA), citing pressures on population growth, housing and infrastructure. Foreigners would also face more stringent rules once they had arrived; temporary visitors would have to carry identification at all times, as well as reside in the UK for at least 10 years before becoming eligible for British citizenship. Such measures, the party hopes, would justify the reintroduction of the country's work permit scheme.|$|E

5|$|Sheffield {{remained}} a major industrial city throughout {{the first half}} of the 20th century, but the downturn in world trade following the 1973 oil crisis, technological improvements and economies of scale, and a wide-reaching restructuring of steel production throughout <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> Community led to the closure of many of the steelworks from the early 1970s onward. Urban and economic regeneration schemes were initiated in the late 1980s. The city centre was blighted by empty shops and improvements were halted by the Great Recession.|$|E

The five-member Commission consisted of presidents of Constitutional Courts in the EEC. Starting in late November 1991, the committee rendered ten opinions.

5|$|The Badinter Arbitration Committee {{was set up}} by the Council of Ministers of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Economic</b> Community (EEC) on 27 August 1991 {{to provide}} legal advice and {{criteria}} for diplomatic recognition to former Yugoslav republics.

Factors in the preservation of Croatia's pre-war borders, defined by demarcation commissions in 1947, were the Yugoslav federal constitutional amendments of 1971 and 1974, granting that sovereign rights were exercised by the federal units, and that the federation had only the authority specifically transferred to it by the constitution.|$|E
