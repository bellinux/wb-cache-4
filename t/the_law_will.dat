5|$|Adopted {{from the}} Grand Theft Auto series, Red Dead Redemption has a {{modified}} wanted system. When the player commits a crime such as killing people near witnesses, some will {{run to the}} nearest police station. The player can bribe them or kill them {{before they reach the}} station. If a crime is committed near a police officer, the wanted meter immediately appears along with a bounty count which increases with each crime committed. If Marston's bounty becomes high enough he will be pursued by either the U.S. Marshals or by the Mexican Army depending on his locations. To evade law enforcement in pursuit, John Marston must escape a circular zone until the wanted meter disappears. Alternatively, the player character can kill all lawmen in a town to have the wanted meter disappear. Despite the chase being aborted, a bounty is placed upon John which will cause bounty hunters to come after him in the wilderness. It is impossible to surrender to these bounty hunters by putting away Marston's weapon and standing still as they will kill him regardless. Only law enforcement in towns and a posse will accept surrenders. <b>The</b> <b>law</b> <b>will</b> continue to chase Marston unless he pays his bounty at a telegraph station or presents a pardon letter. When arrested, Marston pays off his bounty and is then released. If the player does not have enough money to pay back the bounty, <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>will</b> assign bounty hunting activities.|$|E

25|$|Several {{measures}} {{serve as}} indicators of the long-term financial status of Medicare. These include total Medicare spending {{as a share of}} gross domestic product (GDP), the solvency of the Medicare HI trust fund, Medicare per-capita spending growth relative to inflation and per-capita GDP growth; general fund revenue as a share of total Medicare spending; and actuarial estimates of unfunded liability over the 75-year timeframe and the infinite horizon (netting expected premium/tax revenue against expected costs). The major issue in all these indicators is comparing any future projections against current law vs. what the actuaries expect to happen. For example, current law specifies that Part A payments to hospitals and skilled nursing facilities will be cut substantially after 2028 and that doctors will get no raises after 2025. The actuaries expect that <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>will</b> change to keep these events from happening.|$|E
25|$|Even if agency {{workers had}} {{any of the}} {{entitlements}} under the Employment Rights Act 1996, there would still exist no requirement of equal pay for agency workers who do {{work of equal value}} compared to a permanent employer. An agency worker can be treated less favourably in his or her pay and conditions than someone doing exactly the same job, simply because they come through an agency. A proposed Temporary and Agency Workers (Equal Treatment) Bill sought to adjust this position, joining another ten pieces of employment discrimination law in the UK (on gender, race, disability, religion, sexuality, age, part-time work, fixed time work and trade union membership). After the Bill's second reading, the proposal was dropped and an older draft of a European Union Directive, the Temporary and Agency Workers Directive was revived, and passed by the European Parliament. This was possible {{for the first time in}} 2008 because the United Kingdom government dropped its opposition. In fact, the directive and the Bill are almost identical. It is understood that <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>will</b> be passed, but with a 12-week wait before agency workers will be eligible for equal pay and hours.|$|E
25|$|EU {{legislation}} currently {{states that}} there are total allowable catches for each species, which are sub-divided between European Union member states, the intention {{of which is to}} conserve fish stocks. The individual countries then use this figure as a basis for quota allocation to individual fishermen or fishermens organisations. The quota rules however require that any fish which is caught outside quota allowances or below minimum landing size be discarded and that it is an offence for a fishing vessel to be carrying on board any fish for which it does not have a valid quota or which is outside regulated size limits. This is an example of discarding practice being driven by political considerations. Years after difficult negotiations between stakeholders and member states, the EU updated the Common Fisheries Policy and included in Article 15 the Landing Obligation (Discard ban). Until 2019 <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>will</b> be implemented progressively. The Landing Obligation does not allow the fisher to land bycatches, it is the obligation to do so. All species subject to an regulation like catch quotas or minimum sizes, have to be landed. However, these landings are not feasible for direct human consumption and are therefore expected {{to be used in the}} fishmeal industry. The reform of the Common Fisheries Policy is based on regulation formats in Norway and Iceland.|$|E

25|$|The core {{distinction}} between the United States Bill of Rights and Canadian Charter is {{the existence of the}} limitations and notwithstanding clauses. Canadian courts have consequently interpreted each right more expansively. However, due to the limitations clause, where a violation of a right exists, <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>will</b> not necessarily grant protection of that right. In contrast, rights under the US Bill of Rights are absolute and so a violation will not be found until there has been sufficient encroachment on those rights. The sum effect is that both constitutions provide comparable protection of many rights. Fundamental justice (in section 7 of the Canadian Charter) is therefore interpreted to include more legal protections than due process, which is its US equivalent. Freedom of expression in section 2 also has a more wide-ranging scope than the First Amendment to the United States Constitution's freedom of speech. In RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd. (1986), the Canadian Supreme Court considered picketing of the kind the US First Amendment did not permit, as it was disruptive conduct (though there was some speech involved that the First Amendment might otherwise protect). The Supreme Court, however, ruled the picketing, including the disruptive conduct, were fully protected under section 2 of the Charter. The Court then relied on section 1 to find the injunction against the picketing was just. The limitations clause has also allowed governments to enact laws that would be considered unconstitutional in the US. The Supreme Court of Canada has upheld some of Quebec's limits on the use of English on signs and has upheld publication bans that prohibit media from mentioning the names of juvenile criminals.|$|E

500|$|On 17 January 2012, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie {{signed into}} law a bill that legalized direct {{shipping}} from wineries to consumers, and permits New Jersey wineries to open as many as 15 offsite retail sales outlets in the state.

500|$|Justice Stephen Breyer {{wrote an}} opinion concurring in the judgment, {{in which he}} argued that {{content-based}} discrimination {{should be considered a}} [...] "rule of thumb, rather than as an automatic 'strict scrutiny' trigger, leading to almost certain legal condemnation". Justice Breyer conceded that content-based regulations sometimes reveal weaknesses in the government's rationale for limiting speech, and that content-based regulations interfere with the [...] "free marketplace of idea". [...] However, he also argued that [...] "virtually all government activities involve speech", and many involve content-based regulations on speech. Therefore, he concluded that a rule triggering strict scrutiny for all cases involving content-based restrictions would be a [...] "recipe for judicial management of ordinary government regulatory activity". Justice Breyer argued that instead of the automatic trigger, courts should determine the constitutionality of content-based regulations by [...] "examining the seriousness of the harm to speech, the importance of the countervailing objectives, the extent to which <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>will</b> achieve those objectives, and whether there are other, less restrictive ways of doing so". Although he did not believe strict scrutiny should be applied to the town's sign ordinance, he agreed that the town's ordinance was unconstitutional because the town did not provide a rational justification for treating some signs differently than other.|$|E
500|$|On 14 August 1968 Lihau {{was named}} First President {{of the new}} Supreme Court of Justice of the Congo. He was officially {{installed}} in the position on 23 November. In his inaugural speech, Lihau requested [...] "the scrupulous respect of all the authorities of the Republic {{the status of the}} magistracy guaranteeing independence in the exercise of its functions." [...] Two years later he became editor of the new law journal La Revue Congolaise de Droit and also served as general delegate to the Office Nationale de la Recherche et du Developpement for its judicial, political, and social research division. Marcel Lihau soon adopted the name Ebua Libana la Molengo Lihau, as per the encouraged Africanisation in accordance with Mobutu's policy of Authenticité. As a judge, he believed that the term [...] "law" [...] applied [...] "not only to legislative acts, but also to regulatory acts which are at least not illegal, as well as international treaties and ratified agreements". In 1971 Lihau joined the executive committee of the state-sanctioned party, Mouvement Populaire de la Révolution (MPR). Three years later he was made a commissioner of its political bureau. That year a new constitution was promulgated that concentrated the government's authority in Mobutu as President. Lihau supported the independence of the judiciary and, despite Mobutu's centralisation, interpreted the document as only veiling such autonomy, not eliminating it. He explained that the constitution's references to the [...] "Judicial Council" [...] (a section of the MPR) in place of the previous term [...] "Judicial Power" [...] were, though obfuscating, done only for political reasons and signified no real change. He surmised, [...] "he attributions of courts and tribunals have remained the same as in the past, even if the spirit in which they declare <b>the</b> <b>law</b> <b>will</b> necessarily be different." [...] However, this interpretation ran contrary to Mobutu's ideals. In June 1975 Lihau refused to enforce a harsh sentence levied against student protesters. He was subsequently dismissed from the Supreme Court, removed from his teaching position, and placed under house arrest.|$|E
