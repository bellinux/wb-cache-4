40|$|The {{purpose of}} this Item Response Theory study was <b>to</b> {{investigate}} how <b>the</b> expected reduction in item information, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapsing</b> <b>of</b> response categories in performance assessment data, was affected by varying testing conditions: item difficulty, item discrimination, inter-rater reliability, and direction <b>of</b> <b>collapsing.</b> <b>The</b> investigation used copulas in computer simulations of performance assessment batteries with varying combinations of item characteristics within Muraki's 3 enera 1 ized Partial Credit Model. Only two of the significant contrasts that were detected were of practical importance. <b>The</b> results appear <b>to</b> indicate that <b>the</b> expected reduction in information due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapsing</b> <b>of</b> categories is not affected {{by any of the}} testing conditions simulated in this study. Consequently, a practitioner may combine low-frequency categories with adjacent categories without any significant adverse effect on the information provided by the test items.

5|$|A {{third major}} {{criticism}} of the Act {{is that it was}} poorly administered. The Act purposefully brought together competing interests (labor and business, big business and small business, etc.) in a coalition to support passage of the legislation, but these competing interests soon fought one another over the Act's implementation. As a consequence, NRA collapsed due to failure of leadership and confusion about its goals. By the end of 1934, NRA leaders had practically abandoned the progressive interventionist policy which motivated the Act's passage, and were supporting free-market philosophies—contributing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> almost all industry codes.|$|E
5|$|By 1704, the War of the Spanish Succession was in {{its fourth}} year. The {{previous}} year {{had been one of}} success for France and her allies, most particularly on the Danube, where Marshal Villars and the Elector of Bavaria had created a direct threat to Vienna, the Habsburg capital. Vienna had been saved by dissension between the two commanders, leading to the brilliant Villars being replaced by the less dynamic Marshal Marsin. Nevertheless, by 1704, the threat was still real: Rákóczi's Hungarian revolt was already threatening the Empire's eastern approaches, and Marshal Vendôme's forces threatened an invasion from northern Italy. In the courts of Versailles and Madrid, Vienna's fall was confidently anticipated, an event which would almost certainly have led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> the Grand Alliance.|$|E

Gorbachev called for a negotiated end to the conflict and in 1988 organized a quadripartite talks between the USSR, U.S., Cuba and South Africa; they agreed that all foreign troops would pull out of Angola.

5|$|In circa 1250 BC, {{the first}} wave of {{destruction}} has been witnessed in various centers of mainland Greece for reasons that cannot be identified by archaeologists. These incidents appear to have triggered the massive strengthening and expansion of the fortifications in various sites.

Nevertheless, none of these measures appear to have prevented the final destruction of the Mycenaean palace centers in the 12th century BC. The reasons that lead <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> <b>of</b> the Mycenaean culture have been hotly debated among scholars. The two most common theories are population movement and internal conflict.|$|E
