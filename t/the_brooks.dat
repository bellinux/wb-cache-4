5|$|Daniel Burnham and John Wellborn Root met {{as young}} draftsmen in the Chicago firm of Carter, Drake, and Wight in 1872 {{and left to}} form Burnham & Root the {{following}} year. At Aldis's urging, <b>the</b> <b>Brooks</b> brothers had retained the then-fledgling firm to design the Grannis Block, which was their first major commission. Burnham and Root would become the architects of choice for <b>the</b> <b>Brooks</b> family, for whom they would complete the first high-rise building in Chicago, the 10-story Montauk Building, in 1883, and the 11-story Rookery Building in 1888.|$|E
5|$|The {{first to}} file suit over the {{election}} was Judge William M. Harrison, {{who had been on}} <b>the</b> <b>Brooks</b> ticket. He filed a Bill of Equity with the US Circuit Court in Little Rock, claiming he had a right to a seat on the Supreme Court due to the fraudulent election. <b>The</b> <b>Brooks</b> Campaign likewise filed suit in the Circuit Court shortly thereafter on January 7, 1873. Judge H.C. Caldwell heard the Harrison case, and rendered an opinion stating that the Federal Court had no jurisdiction in the matter, and dismissed the case. The Harrison decision resulted in the dismissal of <b>the</b> <b>Brooks</b> case as well.|$|E

50|$|Labidesthes sicculus, {{also known}} as <b>the</b> <b>Brook</b> {{silverside}} is a North American species of Neotropical silverside. <b>The</b> <b>brook</b> silverside lives in slow moving rivers and lakes from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi Basin and Gulf Coastal Plains. <b>The</b> <b>brook</b> silverside survives best in clear water with aquatic vegetation. L. sicculus feeds on a diet of copepods, insect larvae, and winged insects. The spawning season of <b>the</b> <b>brook</b> silverside occurs during the spring and early summer. The survival of freshwater fishes such as <b>the</b> <b>brook</b> silverside is increasingly threatened. In order to ensure survival of <b>the</b> <b>brook</b> silverside, turbidity of natural habitats should be monitored.|$|R

5|$|Brooks {{supporters}} immediately {{claimed that}} the election had been dishonest. The Democrats, the Brindle Tails, and all non-Republican newspapers openly and vocally denounced the election as fraudulent, and insisted that Brooks had in fact received the most votes.

5|$|Brooks {{returned}} to Canada {{by way of}} Russia in 1945, and worked for the Missing Research and Enquiry Service for two years. He was then selected to join the Ottawa RCAF Flyers, who represented Canada at the 1948 Winter Olympics and captured {{the gold medal in}} the ice hockey tournament. After a series of exhibition games in Europe, he {{returned to}} Canada and entered military intelligence, serving at various posts until 1971, at which point he retired to take up an administrative position at the University of Ottawa.

5|$|Donen briefly {{returned}} to the musical genre in 1958 with Damn Yankees!, based on George Abbott's Broadway hit. He again co-directed with Abbott in the same hands-off collaboration as their first film. Like The Pajama Game the film includes music by Adler and Ross and choreography by Fosse. It starred Tab Hunter, Gwen Verdon, and Ray Walston. Damn Yankees! is an adaptation of the Faust legend about {{a fan of the}} baseball team the Washington Senators who mentions that he would sell his soul to give the losing team a good hitter. Walston plays <b>the</b> <b>Brooks</b> Brothers-attired Devil who grants the fan his wish and transforms him into the muscular young hitter Joe Hardy (Hunter). Donen was able to shoot three real Senator-Yankee games on location with as many as seven hidden cameras. The low-budget film was a moderate financial success and received good reviews. It was also Donen's last musical film for many years.|$|E
5|$|On 1 February 1918 Dyer {{was awarded}} a points victory over Frankie Mack in Boston, which he {{followed}} up with another win this time over Terry Brooks. At the start of <b>the</b> <b>Brooks</b> fight, as Dyer was getting into the ring, he was handed a telegram informing {{him that he had}} been appointed as a boxing instructor for the National Army. Dyer had been refused admission into the British and American Armies on account of the broken cartilage in his right knee. Dyer was eventually based at Camp Grant in Illinois, but fought one more bout, a win over Walter Butler of Boston before beginning his commission. Dyer did not fight outside the armed forces {{during the rest of the}} war, but he proved successful in his role as camp boxing instructor with Camp Grant performing well in boxing tournaments. Dyer also continued his charity work, singing and boxing in front of the public and the armed forces.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>brook</b> {{silverside}} is on {{the lower}} end of the food chain, and is preyed on by many larger fish. The diet of <b>the</b> <b>brook</b> silverside consists mostly of zooplankton. They are highly specialized feeders with cladocerans comprising 80% of their diet, (40%) small flying insects, and (20%) midge larvae. Their diet varies with life stages and seasons. At a younger age, <b>the</b> <b>brook</b> silverside preys mostly on smaller fish. Their diet shifts to immature insects later. During winter, <b>the</b> <b>brook</b> silverside eats mostly planktonic crustaceans. Because of both intentional and unintentional species introduction, <b>the</b> <b>brook</b> silverside must compete for food sources. Specifically, <b>the</b> <b>brook</b> silverside has been forced to compete with the non-native Menidia audens, which was introduced by waterway construction. This forced competition of resources has led to a decrease in brook silverside populations.|$|R
50|$|Shire Brook {{has been}} an {{important}} boundary line for over a thousand years. In Anglo-Saxon times <b>the</b> <b>Brook</b> formed <b>the</b> boundary between the kingdoms of Mercia and Northumbria. For 900 years <b>the</b> <b>Brook</b> marked <b>the</b> division between Yorkshire and Derbyshire, this gave <b>the</b> <b>Brook</b> its name, it was also known informally as County Brook and Der Brook, Der being short for Derbyshire. Another alternative name for <b>the</b> <b>brook</b> was Ochre Dike, this was due to the run off from mines in the valley which made the water a yellow brown colour. In 1967 the City of Sheffield expanded its borders south to take in the suburbs of Hackenthorpe and Mosborough and <b>the</b> <b>Brook</b> no longer marked the frontier between the two counties. <b>The</b> <b>Brook</b> also marks <b>the</b> boundary between the Ecclesiastical provinces of York and Canterbury.|$|R
