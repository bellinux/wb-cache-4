After 55 hours of travel <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Rio from Montreal she {{lost in the}} first round match to Saisai Zheng. Partnered with the 2014 Australian Open men's doubles winner, Łukasz Kubot she also lost a tight first round mixed doubles match to the Romanian pair of Irina Camelia Begu and Horia Tecau.|$|E
25|$|At the 1 July deadline, the Israeli cabinet {{offered to}} {{negotiate}} with the hijackers to extend the deadline to 4 July. Amin also asked them to extend the deadline until that date. This meant he could take a diplomatic trip to Port Louis, Mauritius, to officially hand over chairmanship of the Organisation of African Unity to Seewoosagur Ramgoolam. This extension of the hostage deadline proved crucial to providing Israeli forces enough <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> Entebbe.|$|E

25|$|When {{the battle}} ended, British losses {{included}} Columbia sunk, Barbados damaged. Columbia suffered 16dead, {{with only one}} surviving deckhand being recovered after the action. The Germans lost A2 and A6 along with 13killed (including Schoemann) and 46captured. Controversy erupted after it was discovered from the captured Germans, that the three men taken from the sinking Columbia, had been locked away below decks {{on one of the}} torpedo boats and left to die, when the German vessel started to sink. The Germans reported {{that they did not have}} enough <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the British prisoners and barely were able to escape the sinking hulk themselves.|$|E
500|$|An {{original}} {{draft for}} the episode included more dialogue between Pam and Jim about the decision, in which Pam brought up Jim's impulsive decision {{to buy his}} parents' house without consulting her in the episode [...] "Frame Toby," [...] but it was ultimately cut because they felt it added too much <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the resolution. A number of documentary-style interviews with Dwight about Michael's defection and his thoughts about Charles Miner were cut for length issues.|$|E
500|$|Sales of Mega Man Powered Up in Japan were {{considered}} very poor, though it sold {{better in the}} US. Speculation existed for the low sales which included {{the possibility that it}} came out too early in the PSP's life and a [...] "lack of overlap between Mega Man gamers and PSP owners." [...] Fan lamentation also existed for {{the fact that it was}} not available for the Nintendo DS (which featured several other Mega Man titles). Inafune expressed an interest in making a Mega Man Powered Up 2, though he noted that it would take <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to.</b> Due to the poor sales of the game, further remakes have been put on hold.|$|E
50|$|Most highway HOV lanes are the leftmost (inside) lane, {{while most}} exits and entrances {{connect to the}} {{rightmost}} (outside) lane. Immediately after entering the highway, then, high-occupancy vehicles must change lanes several <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the HOV lane, and reverse this process when they near their exit. Worse, many HOVs are large transit vehicles such as vans and buses. This lane-crossing can significantly exacerbate congestion, particularly if traffic is already too congested for drivers to comfortably make these lane changes at speed.|$|R

500|$|Ahead of the episode, Luna {{had also}} hinted at the {{continued}} conflict between Phil Coulson {{and the new}} Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Jeffrey Mace, saying, [...] "Coulson has been doing what he wants, doing his own thing, taking the quinjet out for a spin wherever he needs to go. He’s shooting from the hip {{with a lot of}} these moves he’s making, and I’m sure that’s going to rub the director the wrong way. [...] in who is reportedly a serial killer, so how the director is going to respond to that, we can only wait and see." [...] Bell talked about this, acknowledging that Coulson [...] "wants to have his cake and eat it too", having decided to step down from the role of director himself but still wanting to do what he wants. He said that they were mostly trying to [...] "tee-up" [...] that conflict and give the audience <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know Mace before more thoroughly exploring that aspect in later episodes.|$|E
500|$|Watch Me Disappear was Augie March's most {{mainstream}} pop work to date, {{described as}} a further distillation of the band's earlier, even more complex, music. Richards considered it to be more streamlined than their early work, despite their attempts to maintain a sense of spontaneity. Zuel also noted a removal {{of much of the}} backing instrumentation which had acted as [...] "clutter" [...] around Richards' vocals on earlier work. Scott Podmore wrote in the Herald Sun that the album did not have a standout song or an instant appeal but that it was [...] "a slow burner that takes <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know you, but once it does, it's a friend for good". Triple J reviewer Jenny Valentish argued that multiple songs from the album could take the place of [...] "One Crowded Hour" [...] as [...] "likely to become wailed for and misquoted at festivals". She noted a [...] "commercial potential" [...] for the album, despite its more disconcerting and confrontational content.|$|E
500|$|Eric Sundermann of Hollywood.com said [...] "Soulmates" [...] {{demonstrates}} how Parks and Recreation {{is superior to}} other comedy shows because it [...] "invests in its characters and really allows the audience <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know them" [...] rather than depending solely on gags. Alan Sepinwall said he [...] "laughed louder and more frequently at it than any episode so far this season" [...] except for [...] "Flu Season" [...] and called the Ron and Chris subplot as [...] "predictable as hell but perfectly-executed". Sepinwall objected {{to the introduction of}} a no-dating policy simply to slow the budding romance between Leslie and Ben, and said [...] "so much of this season has been so perfect that the rare imperfections stand out even more than they would on a weaker overall comedy". Joel Keller of TV Squad said the no-dating policy felt like a plot contrivance meant strictly to keep Ben and Leslie apart, which he felt was not good for the story. However, he complimented Leslie and Tom's scenes together, and said the subplot was even funnier, which he called a [...] "Ron Swanson classic". Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis said the episode was [...] "a little too disjointed for me", particularly because the two plots were barely associated with each other. However, she said the show included funny individual jokes, and enjoyed the moment when Leslie kissed Tom.|$|E
5000|$|Hargrave {{was then}} {{acquired}} by the Cincinnati Reds. He was their starting catcher {{for most of the}} 1920s and consistently put up good hitting numbers. In 1926, he won the National League batting title with a [...]353 average. The rules at the time required batting champions to play in at least 100 games, and Hargrave pinch hit several <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> 105. He was the first catcher to lead the NL in batting average. In 1927, he led the league's catchers in fielding percentage.|$|R

500|$|According to Usher [...] "Love You Gently", a piano-based classic {{rhythm and}} blues ballad, is [...] "the one [...] you throw on with your {{significant}} other when it's <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> it. This is why my son's here. It's a baby-maker." [...] Jay-Z appears on the horn-founded [...] "Best Thing", which is about transition to manhood. Usher outlines lifestyle changes since his wife's arrival and turns away from his days as [...] "a hustler and a player" [...] in [...] "Before I Met You", which makes use of guitar and heavy drums. He is suspected of infidelity and compared to his girlfriend's cheating ex-partner on [...] "His Mistakes". The thirteenth track on Here I Stand is [...] "Appetite", which utilizes flutes and has Usher tempted to cheat on his wife. [...] "What's a Man to Do" [...] opens with a Native Indian call, while [...] "Lifetime" [...] contains influences of 1990s R [...] "Love in This Club Part II" [...] features vocals from Beyoncé Knowles and Lil Wayne and samples The Stylistics' [...] "You Are Everything" [...] (1971); its lyrical content {{is similar to that}} of Part I, and Wayne's voice is modified through the use of a vocoder. The album's soul and pop jazz-derived title track, [...] "Here I Stand", drew comparisons to Stevie Wonder. With a theme of commitment, it was played at Usher's and Foster's wedding. Here I Stand closes with [...] "Will Work for Love", although it was placed as a hidden track on some copies; Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine called it [...] "cute".|$|E
2500|$|When the attacking wave {{was twenty}} metres from the dyke the bugles sounded the charge, {{and the two}} marine {{infantry}} companies stormed the embankment. [...] Taccoën's company, leading the way, lost 5 men killed and 10 wounded in its approach. [...] Guérin de Fontjoyeux's men suffered almost as heavily, and two lieutenants were also killed during the assault. [...] But the attack was so rapid that around fifty Black Flags, who had been lying on their backs asleep, did not have <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> their feet, and were pinned {{to the ground with}} bayonet thrusts. [...] The surviving Chinese fled across the rice paddies. [...] The French killed many of them with rifle fire as they fled.|$|E
2500|$|The Q70 is one {{of three}} SBS routes planned under the LaGuardia Alternatives Analysis (the M60 became an SBS route on May 25, 2014, and the [...] route had been planned to be {{extended}} to LaGuardia Airport under the LaGuardia Alternatives Analysis). Compared to the Q33 route between Jackson Heights and LaGuardia, it takes the Q70 40% less <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> LaGuardia. The Q33 runs on local residential and commercial streets, which are frequently congested, resulting in slower service. The change, however, took direct airport service away from airport employees who live along the Q33 route in Jackson Heights, although MTA studies indicated that {{only a small portion of}} LaGuardia-bound passengers came from these areas. However, since its implementation in September 2013, daily ridership on the Q70 has more than doubled from 2,100 riders to 4,300 riders.|$|E

2500|$|Erich Ludendorff, the Quartermaster general (Erster Generalquartiermeister) of the German armies over-ruled Feldmarschall Rupprecht, Crown Prince of Bavaria, the {{commander}} of Army Group Rupprecht of Bavaria (Heeresgruppe Kronprinz Rupprecht von Bayern) and General Sixt von Armin the 4th Army commander over defensive tactics, after the disaster of the Battle of Broodseinde on 4 October. Ludendorff insisted on {{the establishment of an}} outpost line [...] in front of a [...] deep, to be occupied by a few sentries and machine-guns. When the British attacked, the sentries were to swiftly retire across the Vorfeld to the main line of resistance [...] and the artillery was to quickly bombard the Vorfeldlinie. The tactic was expected to give rear battalions of the Stellungsdivisionen (ground holding divisions) and Eingreifdivisionen (specialist counter-attack divisions), <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the Hauptwiederstandslinie. If a swift counter-attack (Gegenstoß) was not possible, a Gegenangriff (methodical counter-attack) was to be conducted after a delay of [...] to prepare the artillery, infantry and supporting aircraft.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the mobile}} game Before Crisis, the first Compilation game title to be released, has {{received}} limited western commentary, writers at AnimeFringe felt that [...] "the chance {{to reverse the}} good and bad guy roles should be welcomed by many." [...] Advent Children received mixed views from critics. Carlo Santos of Anime News Network felt that, due to the film's pace and context, viewers were not given enough <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know the characters. These sentiments were echoed by John Eriani of Mania Entertainment, who particularly faulted the lack of character names or explanations of the villains' motives. Chris Carle of IGN was critical {{of the lack of}} motivation for those who were not familiar with the series, but praised both the English and Japanese voice acting. Michael Beckett of RPGamer, while generally less than impressed by the overall story, said that it [...] " [...] some interesting insights into a few of the less-developed characters of the game, though Cloud receives most of the attention and development as the story unfolds".|$|E
2500|$|Having a {{dedicated}} fanbase composed mostly by female and gay people, Tsai {{is considered a}} gay icon. In 2007, Tsai's [...] "Bravo Lover" [...] became the theme song of the 2007 Taiwan Pride parade. Her other songs, including [...] "Fantasy", [...] "Dr. Jolin", [...] "Gentlewoman", and [...] "We're All Different, Yet the Same", all cater to the gay audience and support same-sex love. In 2012, she signed the petition calling for Taiwan's government passing Marriage Equality Act and legalizing same-sex marriage in Taiwan. Recognized as a long-term ally of the LGBT community, Tsai was given the Icon Award at the 2nd Asia LGBT Milestone Awards to praise her putting aside the pressure of public opinion and appreciate her using her influence to support same-sex love in Chinese-speaking world. In 2015, Tsai featured {{on the cover of}} lesbian-themed magazine Lezs. In an interview with Lezs, she spoke about homophobia and advocated people to embrace all kinds of love. She stated, [...] "we have to give them the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> understand one another, since the definition of love varies from person to person." [...] During her Play World Tour (2015–2016), Tsai gave a speech to support transgender people, and spoke against the bullying of children and teenagers in general, including the bullying of gay teens and a related recent suicide in Taiwan.|$|E

2500|$|There are differing {{recommendations}} {{about the}} importance of interviews, with the consensus view that interviews were overall less important than college admissions essays, but should be done if they were offered. One advisor suggested that visits by college admissions personnel to the high schools were a waste of time for colleges, since there was not enough <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know specific applicants. In addition, she felt that personal interviews were generally overrated, though she noted that many Ivies have alumni interviews, which can help in borderline situations. One counselor suggested that if an interview was offered by a college admissions program, then it was not really optional but it should be seen as a requirement, that is, not going to such an interview could be detrimental to a student's chances for admission. Another suggested that a student should try to get an interview, even if it was not required, since it might help [...] "exhibit character strengths" [...] that might not show up via grades on high school transcripts. Several reports noted that most Ivy League schools have abandoned the interview requirement, but that if there is an opportunity for an interview, even with an alumnus of the college, then {{it is a good idea}} to do it since not doing it signals a lack of interest in the school. Knowing a college can be helpful during an interview, so that an applicant can say something specific about the school, or a professor who teaches there, or a subject or internship opportunities, since it shows sincere interest. Interviews (if offered) may be more of a factor at small liberal arts colleges: ...|$|E
