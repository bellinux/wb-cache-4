Buffers exist to ease this problem by giving the fast network a place to store packets, to be read by the slower network at its own pace. [...] In other words, buffers act like shock absorbers to convert bursty arrivals into smooth, steady departures. However, a buffer can hold only a specific maximum number of packets. The ideal buffer is sized so it can handle a sudden burst of communication and match the speed of that burst to the speed of the slower network. Ideally, the [...] "shock absorbing" [...] situation is characterized by a temporary delay for packets in the buffer during the <b>transmission</b> <b>burst,</b> after which the delay rapidly disappears and the network reaches a balance in offering and handling packets.|$|E
5000|$|The Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) is/was an L band Distributed Time Division Multiple Access (DTDMA) network {{radio system}} {{used by the}} United States armed forces and their allies to support data {{communications}} needs, principally {{in the air and}} missile defense community. It produces a spread spectrum signal using Frequency-shift keying (FSK) and Phase-shift keying (PSK) to spread the radiated power over a wider spectrum (range of frequencies) than normal radio transmissions. This reduces susceptibility to noise, jamming, and interception. In Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) (supposedly like cell phone systems), each time interval (e.g. 1 second) is divided into time slots (e.g. 1024 per second). Together, all the time slots in the interval are called a [...] "frame". Each slot is [...] "bursted" [...] (transmitted) at a different frequency (FSK). Within each slot, the phase angle of the <b>transmission</b> <b>burst</b> can be varied to provide PSK. Each type of data to be transmitted is assigned a slot or block of slots (channel). In TDMA, the slot frequencies remain fixed from second to second (frame to frame). In DTDMA, the slot frequencies and/or slot assignments for each channel do not remain fixed from frame to frame but are varied in a pseudo-random manner. The slot assignments, frequencies, and information may all be encrypted to provide computer-to-computer connectivity in support of every type of military platform from Air Force fighters to Navy submarines.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} {{synchronize}} and equalize the channel, there are methods to perform timing, frequency offset and channel estimation. In the MC context, timing estimation involves locating {{the start of}} a <b>transmission</b> <b>burst,</b> finding the first multicarrier symbol, and estimating the fractional time delay (FTD), which is a fraction of the multicarrier symbol period. Since OFDM is the most widespread MC technique, many methods for synchronization and channel estimation can be found for it.

This results in an equality in (14) regardless of the channel decorrelation period. This approach would result in throughput reduction as the transmitters must wait in idle mode for the channel to decorrelate. Throughput loss can be avoided by having multiple JCMA groups accessing the channel in a TDMA fashion, so that one group uses the channel while the others wait for it to decorrelate. Alternatively, the protocol can be applied to only some of the subcarriers preferably spaced apart as much as possible across the bandwidth.|$|E

The scheme makes use of the periodic structure of each burst preamble and is robust with respect to distortions induced by dispersive channels.
