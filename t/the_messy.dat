It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do <b>the</b> <b>messy</b> part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of {{the whole point of the}} movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.|$|E

[...] Allmusic's Thom Jurek cites it as [...] "the most overtly political album of Cooder's career" [...] to due its [...] "soapbox style" [...] and feels that the songs [...] "express what he considers to be, as both an artist and a pissed-off citizen, the high-stakes historical gamble of the 2012 presidential and congressional contest." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Trawniki men shot so {{fast and}} so wildly that the German policemen [...] "frequently had to take cover to avoid being hit." [...] Ukrainian Hiwis were {{perceived}} as indispensable.

The wave of mass killings of Jews from the Międzyrzec Podlaski Ghetto lasting non-stop for several days were conducted by the Trawniki battalion of about 350 to 400 men, same as in Parczew, or the Izbica Ghetto. Some officers of the Nazi German Ordnungspolizei felt uneasy about killing non-Jewish Poles. Their unit shot 4,600 Jews by September 1942, but disproportionately only 78 ethnic Poles.

2500|$|Bakhtin's {{communication}} legacy reaches beyond rhetoric, social constructionism and semiotics as he {{has been}} called [...] "the philosopher of human communication." [...] Bakhtin “concentrates heavily on language and its general use." [...] Leslie Baxter observes: “Communication scholars have much to gain from conversing with Bakhtin’s dialogism." [...] Kim argues that “theories of human communication through verbal dialogue or literary representations” such as the ones Bakhtin studied “will apply to virtually every academic discipline in the human sciences." [...] Bakhtin's theories on dialogism influence interpersonal communication research, and [...] "dialogism represents a methodological turn towards <b>the</b> <b>messy</b> reality of communication, in all its many language forms.” In order to understand Bakhtin as a communication scholar one must take all forms of communication into account. While Bakhtin’s works focused primarily on text, interpersonal communication is also key, especially when the two are related in terms of culture. Kim states that “culture as Geertz and Bakhtin allude to can be generally transmitted through communication or reciprocal interaction such as a dialogue.” ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{the launch}} of Galileo neared, anti-nuclear groups, {{concerned}} over what they perceived as an unacceptable risk to the public's safety from Galileo RTGs, sought a court injunction prohibiting Galileo launch. RTGs had been used for years in planetary exploration without mishap: the Lincoln Experimental Satellites 8/9, launched by the U.S. Department of Defense, had 7% more plutonium on board than Galileo, and the two Voyager spacecraft each carried 80% as much plutonium as Galileo. However, activists remembered <b>the</b> <b>messy</b> crash of the Soviet Union's nuclear-powered Kosmos 954 satellite in Canada in 1978, and though was not nuclear-powered, the 1986 Challenger accident raised public awareness about spacecraft failures. In addition, no RTGs had ever done a non-orbital swing past the Earth at close range and high speed, as Galileo Venus-Earth-Earth Gravity Assist trajectory required it to do. This created a novel mission failure modality that might plausibly have entailed total dispersal of Galileo plutonium in the Earth's atmosphere. Scientist Carl Sagan, for example, {{a strong supporter of}} the Galileo mission, said in 1989 that [...] "there is nothing absurd about either side of this argument." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{international}} press wrote positively {{about the}} film and specifically about van Houten.

This being Verhoeven, there's lots of sex and {{a scene in which}} the extremely attractive star (Carice van Houten) bleaches her pubic hair. That aside, hers is a star-making performance, putting even Scarlett [...] in the shade." [...] In the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung Dirk Schümer says Carice van Houten is not only more beautiful, but also a better actress than Scarlett Johansson. Furthermore, he writes in his review: [...] "Europe's Hollywood can actually be better than the original. With his basic instinct sharpened in California, Verhoeven demonstrates here the cinema as a medium of individual tragedy." [...] Jacques Mandelbaum writes in his review in Le Monde: [...] "This lesson about humanity and about fear can be situated in the wake of several rare masterpieces, that are solemnly confronted by this story"; he also compares Black Book with classics like The Great Dictator, To Be or Not to Be, and Monsieur Klein.|$|E

2500|$|Volta {{was well}} {{received}} by critics upon its release, though {{to a lesser}} extent than Björk's previous albums.

Arwa Haider also stated that 'this (Volta) is arguably (Björk's) strongest album yet', while Priya Elan praised the album as 'another amazing statement of intent-full of hope, eccenticity and wonderfulness.' Michael Keefe, in a more balanced review, said that Volta is not 'a great album, but it is quite good.' The song [...] "Earth Intruders" [...] got favourable reception by music critics. Drowned in Sound reviewer Mike Diver gave the song 9/10, praising it as 'immediately catchy, compellingly left of centre, and undeniably unique'. Digital Spy reviewer Miriam Zendle cited [...] "Earth Intruders" [...] as returning to Björk's earlier commercial sound, comparing it to her more recent albums that were [...] "incredibly difficult to grasp hold of". Music website Popjustice called it the 80th greatest single of 2007. However, Volta also received some mixed reviews with Pitchfork Media stating that 'Volta is mostly proof that Björk is as fallible as <b>the</b> <b>messy,</b> unpredictable humanity she celebrates, and that even her definition of 'pop' is avant-garde.' ...|$|E
