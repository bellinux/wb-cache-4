5|$|<b>The</b> <b>He</b> 111 was {{constantly}} upgraded and modified, but became obsolete {{during the latter}} part of the war. The German Bomber B project was not realised, which forced the Luftwaffe to continue operating <b>the</b> <b>He</b> 111 in combat roles until the end of the war. Manufacture of <b>the</b> <b>He</b> 111 ceased in September 1944, at which point piston-engine bomber production was largely halted in favour of fighter aircraft. With the German bomber force virtually defunct, <b>the</b> <b>He</b> 111 was used for logistics.|$|E
5|$|A general problem {{existed in}} powerplants. <b>The</b> <b>He</b> 111 was {{equipped}} with BMW VI glycol-cooled engines. The German aviation industry lacked powerplants that could produce more than 600 hp. Engines of suitable quality were kept for military use, frustrating German airline Luft Hansa and forcing it {{to rely on the}} BMW VI or 132s.|$|E
5|$|Both ships carried one {{aircraft}} catapult {{for a pair}} of Heinkel He 60 biplane reconnaissance float planes. They were {{equipped with}} a crane to retrieve the aircraft after landing. <b>The</b> <b>He</b> 60s were later replaced by the monoplane Arado Ar 196 by 1939. Leipzigs catapult was located between the funnel and the forward superstructure, while Nürnbergs was placed aft of the funnel.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hes</b> {{continued}} to visit Anna Mae until January 28, 2001 when an argument {{occurred at the}} Bakers' home. <b>The</b> <b>Hes</b> wanted to take Anna Mae to a photography studio for a family portrait on her second birthday, but the Bakers refused. The Bakers subsequently called <b>the</b> police. <b>The</b> <b>Hes</b> {{were told that they}} could not return to the Bakers' home. The police officer later testified that he said they could not return to the Bakers' house that day but <b>the</b> <b>Hes</b> believed they were being told that they could not return to the Bakers' home at all. <b>The</b> <b>Hes</b> did not see Anna Mae again for years.|$|R
50|$|Unable to financially {{care for}} Anna Mae, <b>the</b> <b>Hes</b> {{decided to let}} her remain in the Bakers' custody. The Bakers {{expressed}} interest in adopting Anna Mae but <b>the</b> <b>Hes</b> were unwilling. An agreement was reached {{that would give the}} Bakers temporary custody and let <b>the</b> <b>Hes</b> retain parental rights. The Bakers claim there was also an oral agreement that the Bakers would raise Anna Mae until she is eighteen years old. But <b>the</b> <b>Hes</b> contend that they did not agree to this and that the arrangement was only temporary. A juvenile court officer's testimony supports the Hes' claim.|$|R
5|$|By 17:00, the Luftwaffe {{was ready}} to strike again. Radar {{stations}} were now plotting more German formations off the Kent coast and over the Pas-de-Calais area. Having attacked Biggin Hill and Kenley, Luftflotte 2 was now going after the Sector Station RAF North Weald and RAF Hornchurch. Some 58 Do 17s of KG 2 were sent to bomb Hornchurch and 51 He 111s of KG 53 were directed to attack North Weald. The two raiding formations were to pass over the coast at the same time; so <b>the</b> <b>He</b> 111s attacking North Weald, with further to go, left 15 minutes earlier. <b>The</b> <b>He</b> 111s were to cross over at Foulness, the Dorniers at Deal. Fighter escort was provided by 140 Bf 109s and Bf 110s from JG 3, JG 26, JG 51, JG 54 and ZG 26.|$|E
5|$|During operations, <b>the</b> <b>He</b> 111Z did {{not have}} enough power to lift a fully loaded Me 321. Some He 111s were {{supplemented}} by rocket pods for extra takeoff thrust, but this was not a fleet-wide action. Two rockets were mounted beneath each fuselage and one underneath each wing. This added 500kg (1,100lb) in weight. The pods were then released by parachute after takeoff.|$|E
5|$|Even though Brigadier General Joseph V. Medina of the Marine Corps was not {{a member}} of the Navy, he made naval history when on June 10, 2004 he became the first Marine general ever {{assigned}} commander of naval ships. During Operation Iraqi Freedom, Medina oversaw the manning and equipping of ESG-3. From his flagship, <b>the</b> , <b>he</b> then led the Belleau Wood Strike Group (BWDESG) through a 6-month deployment in support of where he was assigned as Commander Task Force 58.|$|E

5|$|Features of <b>the</b> <b>He</b> 111 were {{apparent}} in the Heinkel He 70. The first single-engined He 70 Blitz ("Lightning") rolled off the line in 1932 and immediately started breaking records. In the normal four-passenger version its speed reached 380km/h (230mph) when powered by a 447kW (600hp) BMW VI engine. <b>The</b> <b>He</b> 70 was designed with an elliptical wing, which the Günther brothers had already incorporated into the Bäumer Sausewind before they joined Heinkel. This wing design became a feature in this and many subsequent designs they developed. <b>The</b> <b>He</b> 70 drew {{the interest of the}} Luftwaffe, which was looking for an aircraft with both bomber and transport capabilities.|$|E

5000|$|In 1991, Cooper {{released}} his 19th studio album Hey Stoopid featuring several of rock music’s glitterati guesting on the record. Released as glam metal's popularity {{was on the}} wane, and just before the explosion of grunge, it failed {{to have the same}} commercial impact as its predecessor. The same year also saw the release of the video Alice Cooper: Prime Cuts which chronicled his entire career using in depth interviews with Cooper himself, Bob Ezrin, and Shep Gordon. One critic has noted that Prime Cuts demonstrates how Cooper had used (in contrast to similar artists who succeeded him) themes of satire and moralisation to such good effect throughout his career. It was in the Prime Cuts video that Bob Ezrin delivered his own summation of the Alice Cooper persona: [...] "He is the psycho killer in all of us. <b>He's</b> <b>the</b> axe murderer, <b>he's</b> <b>the</b> spoiled child, <b>he's</b> <b>the</b> abuser, <b>he's</b> <b>the</b> abused; <b>he's</b> <b>the</b> perpetrator, <b>he's</b> <b>the</b> victim, <b>he's</b> <b>the</b> gun slinger, and <b>he's</b> <b>the</b> guy lying dead {{in the middle of the}} street".|$|R

5|$|In late 1937, the D-1 series entered production. However, the DB 600Ga engine with 781kW (1,047hp) {{planned for}} this variant was instead {{allocated}} to Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Bf 110 production lines. Heinkel then opted to use Junkers Jumo engines, and <b>the</b> <b>He</b> 111 V6 was tested with Jumo 210 G engines, but was judged underpowered. However, the improved 745kW (999hp) Jumo 211 A-1 powerplant prompted {{the cancellation of}} the D series altogether and concentration {{on the design of}} the E series.|$|E
5|$|Many of <b>the</b> <b>He</b> 111 Ps served {{during the}} Polish Campaign. With the Junkers Ju 88 {{experiencing}} technical difficulties, <b>the</b> <b>He</b> 111 and the Do 17 formed {{the backbone of}} the Kampfwaffe. On 1 September 1939, Luftwaffe records indicate the Heinkel strength at 705 (along with 533 Dorniers).|$|E
5|$|On 27 July 1936, Udet crashed <b>the</b> <b>He</b> 118 prototype, He 118 V1 D-UKYM. That same day, Charles Lindbergh {{was visiting}} Ernst Heinkel, so Heinkel could only {{communicate}} with Udet by telephone. According to {{this version of}} the story, Heinkel warned Udet about the propeller's fragility. Udet failed to consider this, so in a dive, the engine oversped and the propeller broke away.|$|E

5|$|On 7 April 1945, 134 B-17 Flying Fortresses {{bombed the}} field at Parchim. In two days, I./JG 1 {{relocated}} to a nearby airfield at Ludwigslust. They moved again a week later to Leck. Around this time, II./JG 1 had moved to airfield at Marienehe and also started taking delivery of <b>the</b> <b>He</b> 162. These new jet aircraft would never see widespread combat with JG 1 due to their late introduction and a shortage of pilots, aircraft and fuel. JG 1 could no longer field their full complement or effectively fly operations as required.|$|E
5|$|Other {{designs of}} the mid-H series {{included}} <b>the</b> <b>He</b> 111 H-7 and H-8. The airframes {{were to be}} rebuilds of the H-3/H-5 variant. Both were designed as night bombers and were to have two Jumo 211F-1s installed. The intention was for the H-8 to be fitted with cable-cutting equipment and barrage ballon deflectors {{on the leading edge}} of the wings. The H-7 was never built.|$|E
5|$|Owing to the {{uncertainty}} surrounding the delivery {{and availability of}} the DB 601 engines, Heinkel switched to 820kW (1,100hp) Junkers Jumo 211 powerplants, whose somewhat greater size and weight were regarded as unimportant considerations in a twin-engine design.

5|$|The E-1 variant with Jumo 211A-1 engines was {{developed}} in 1937, <b>the</b> <b>He</b> 111 V6 being the first production variant. The E-1 had its original powerplant, the DB 600 replaced with the Jumo 210 Ga engines. The more powerful Jumo 211 A-1 engines desired by the Ministry of Aviation were not yet ready for installation. Another trial aircraft, He 111 V10 (D-ALEQ) was to be fitted with two oil coolers necessary for the Jumo 211 A-1 installation.|$|E
5|$|The E-4 variant {{was fitted}} with {{external}} bomb racks also {{and the empty}} bomb bay space was filled with an 835L (221US gal) tank for aviation fuel and a further 115L (30US gal) oil tank. This increased the loaded weight but increased range to 1,800km (1,130mi). The modifications allowed <b>the</b> <b>He</b> 111 to perform both long- and short-range missions. The E-4's eight internal vertically aligned bomb racks could each carry a 250kg (550lb) bomb. The last E Variant, <b>the</b> <b>He</b> 111E-5, was powered by the Jumo 211A-3, and retained the 835L (221US gal) fuel tank {{on the port side}} of the bomb bay.
