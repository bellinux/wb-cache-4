The whole of Project Alberta was assembled on Tinian by 25 July, except for members who were couriers for bomb parts. Nolan arrived on 26 July on the cruiser , along with Major Robert Furman and Captain Charles H.

5|$|A {{calutron}} is a {{mass spectrometer}} originally designed {{and used for}} separating the isotopes of uranium. It was developed by Ernest Lawrence during the Manhattan Project and was based on his earlier invention, the cyclotron. Its name was derived from California University Cyclotron, in tribute to Lawrence's institution, the University of California, where it was invented. Calutrons {{were used in the}} industrial-scale Y-12 uranium enrichment plant at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The enriched uranium produced was used in <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> atomic bomb that was detonated over Hiroshima on 6 August 1945.|$|E
5|$|After Leonard I. Schiff {{calculated}} that an initiator could theoretically improve {{the efficiency of}} a gun-type fission weapon, Oppenheimer gave approval on 15 March 1945 for initiators {{to be included in}} <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> design. Testing was carried out to ensure that the initiators were rugged enough to handle being transported in an airplane and being accidentally dropped. Eventually, about forty initiators were despatched to Tinian, where four were inserted into the bomb that was used in the bombing of Hiroshima.|$|E
5|$|After the war ended, {{it was not}} {{expected}} that the inefficient Little Boy design would ever again be required, and many plans and diagrams were destroyed, but by mid-1946 the Hanford Site reactors were suffering badly from the Wigner effect, so six Little Boy assemblies were produced at Sandia Base. The Navy Bureau of Ordnance built another 25 Little Boy assemblies in 1947 {{for use by the}} Lockheed P2V Neptune nuclear strike aircraft (which could be launched from, but not land on, the Midway-class aircraft carriers). All <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> units were withdrawn from service by the end of January 1951.|$|E

5|$|Born in Kyoto {{and educated}} at the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, Hashimoto volunteered for service in {{submarines}} {{and was later}} aboard submarine I-24 during the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Hashimoto commanded coastal patrol and training submarines off Japan {{for much of the}} war, and in 1944 took command of I-58, a ship which was equipped to carry kaiten, or manned torpedoes. After a number of unsuccessful operations, under the command of Hashimoto I-58 sank Indianapolis on 30 July with two unmanned Type 95 torpedoes while on a midnight patrol. He lost his entire family in <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> atomic bombing of Hiroshima days after the sinking of Indianapolis.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} {{fifty years after}} 1945, every {{published}} description and drawing of <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> mechanism assumed that a small, solid projectile was fired {{into the center of}} a larger, stationary target. However, critical mass considerations dictated that in Little Boy the larger, hollow piece would be the projectile. The assembled fissile core had more than two critical masses of uranium-235. This required one of the two pieces to have more than one critical mass, with the larger piece avoiding criticality prior to assembly by means of shape and minimal contact with the neutron-reflecting tungsten carbide tamper.|$|E
5|$|Later {{that year}} he was {{assigned}} to the Manhattan Project, and moved with his family to Los Alamos, New Mexico. There he joined the Los Alamos Laboratory's Ordnance (O) Division, which was under the command of another Naval officer, Captain William S. Parsons. Initially the goal of the O Division was to design a gun-type nuclear weapon known as Thin Man. This proved to be impractical due to contamination of the reactor-bred plutonium with plutonium-240, and in February 1944, the Division switched its attention to the development of <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Boy,</b> a smaller device using uranium-235. Birch used unenriched uranium to create scale models and later full-scale mock-ups of the device.|$|E

5|$|Pilot {{plants were}} {{built at the}} Anacostia Naval Air Station and the Philadelphia Navy Yard, and a {{production}} facility at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This was the only production-scale liquid thermal diffusion plant ever built. It could not enrich uranium sufficiently for use in an atomic bomb, but it could provide slightly enriched feed for the Y-12 calutrons and the K-25 gaseous diffusion plants. It was estimated that the S-50 plant had sped up production of enriched uranium used in <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> bomb employed in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima by a week.|$|E
5|$|The Navy Bureau of Ordnance built 25 Little Boy {{assemblies}} in 1947 {{for use by}} the nuclear-capable Lockheed P2V Neptune {{aircraft carrier}} aircraft (which could be launched from but not land on the Midway-class aircraft carriers). Components were produced by the Naval Ordnance Plants in Pocatello, Idaho, and Louisville, Kentucky. Enough fissionable material was available by 1948 to build ten projectiles and targets, although there were only enough initiators for six. All <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> units were withdrawn from service by the end of January 1951.|$|E
5|$|Uanna {{also looked}} after {{security}} at other bases {{that might be}} used by the 509th in an emergency, such as Iwo Jima. He supervised the loading of <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> bomb into the Enola Gay, and during the bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, {{he was in charge of}} a communications center on Iwo Jima that relayed messages back to Tinian. He was therefore one of the first people to know that Hiroshima was the target, and that it had been attacked. After the subsequent unconditional surrender of Japan, he accompanied the Manhattan Project team sent to survey the damage, spending four weeks in Nagasaki.|$|E

5|$|Although Project Alberta had no attack orders, it {{proceeded}} {{with the plan}} to have <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> ready by 1 August 1945 and the first Fat Man ready for use {{as soon as possible}} after that. In the meantime, a series of twelve combat missions were flown between 20 and 29 July against targets in Japan using high-explosive Pumpkin bombs. Project Alberta's Sheldon Dike and Milo Bolstead flew on some of these missions, as did the British observer Group Captain Leonard Cheshire. One serious incident occurred when a Pumpkin bomb was released in the bomb bay of the B-29 Strange Cargo while it was taxiing. The bomb fell through the closed bomb bay doors onto the taxiway. The plane came to a halt in a shower of sparks, but fire fighters doused the plane and the bomb in foam, and the bomb did not explode. The aircraft had to be jacked up to remove the bomb.|$|E
5|$|Although {{all of its}} {{components}} had been tested, no full test of a gun-type nuclear weapon occurred before <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Boy</b> was dropped over Hiroshima. The only test explosion of a nuclear weapon concept had been of an implosion-type device employing plutonium as its fissile material, and took place on 16 July 1945 at the Trinity nuclear test. There were several reasons for not testing a Little Boy type of device. Primarily, there was little uranium-235 {{as compared with the}} relatively large amount of plutonium which, it was expected, could be produced by the Hanford Site reactors. Additionally, the weapon design was simple enough that it was only deemed necessary to do laboratory tests with the gun-type assembly. Unlike the implosion design, which required sophisticated coordination of shaped explosive charges, the gun-type design was considered almost certain to work.|$|E
5|$|At Sandia Base, three Army officers, Captains Albert Bethel, Richard Meyer, and Bobbie Griffin {{attempted}} to re-create <b>the</b> <b>Little</b> <b>Boy.</b> They were supervised by Harlow W. Russ, {{an expert on}} Little Boy who served with Project Alberta on Tinian, and was now leader of the Z-11 Group of the Los Alamos Laboratory's Z Division at Sandia. Gradually, they managed to locate the correct drawings and parts, and figured out how they went together. Eventually, they built six Little Boy assemblies. Although the casings, barrels, and components were tested, no enriched uranium was supplied for the bombs. By early 1947, the problem caused by the Wigner effect {{was on its way}} to solution, and the three officers were reassigned.|$|E
