5|$|During Darius's Greek expedition, he {{had begun}} {{construction}} projects in Susa, Egypt and Persepolis. He had linked the Red Sea to the river Nile by building a canal (Darius Canal) which ran from modern Zaqāzīq to modern Suez. <b>To</b> <b>open</b> <b>this</b> canal, he travelled to Egypt in 497 BCE, where the inauguration was carried out with great fanfare and celebration. Darius also built a canal to connect the Red Sea and Mediterranean. On this visit to Egypt he erected monuments and executed Aryandes on the charge of treason. When Darius returned to Persis, {{he found that the}} codification of Egyptian law had been finished.|$|E

25|$|According {{to western}} {{financial}} markets, {{consolidation of the}} financial sector remains a concern as it continues at a slow pace, with the market split so small that no bank controls more than 10% of the market, and the Taiwanese government is obligated, by the WTO accession treaty, <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>this</b> sector between 2005 and 2008.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the other}} {{functional}} mutations are believed to result in hypoexcitability. The R859C mutation, for example, has a more depolarized voltage dependence of activation, meaning that the membrane must be more depolarized for the channel <b>to</b> <b>open.</b> <b>This</b> mutant also recovers more slowly from inactivation. The nonfunctional channels are believed to produce similar changes in cell excitability. Likewise, many of the nonsense mutations likely result in nonfunctional channels and hypoexcitability, though this {{has yet to be}} tested. It is also unclear how this membrane hypoexcitability leads to the GEFS+ phenotype.|$|E

A typical bridge project of this scale in Minnesota would be expected to take three years to complete, but state transportation officials hoped <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>this</b> replacement bridge in 15 months by using a design/build contract that allowed design and construction of the bridge to proceed concurrently.

25|$|In 1868 Cox and Bloomfield applied {{under the}} {{conditions}} of the Crown Lands Alienation Act of 1868 for their runs Woodlands, Miriam Vale and Polmaily to be consolidated as the Miriam Vale run and Silex, Ilex and Gochen to be consolidated as Bulburan. Miriam Vale was divided into resumed and leasehold sections in 1869/70, but there was little demand <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>this</b> land for selection. Some Miriam Vale land had been taken up as freehold by 1884. In January 1875 a telegraph office was opened at Miriam Vale, and a post office was established there in April 1877, reflecting a population increase in the district.|$|E

He encouraged his managers to invest and take an equity stake in the business, often as much as $1000 in their store, or the next outlet <b>to</b> <b>open.</b> (<b>This</b> motivated the managers to sharpen their managerial skills and take ownership over their role in the enterprise.) By 1962, along with his brother Bud, he owned 16 stores in Arkansas, Missouri, and Kansas (fifteen Ben Franklins and one independent, in Fayetteville).|$|E

25|$|Lycoming Creek, {{which begins}} in McNett Township {{also served as}} a highway of sorts during the colonial era of Pennsylvania's history. The stream was used by early explorers and the Native Americans in the area as a means of travel. They were able to float their canoes down the creek and into the West Branch Susquehanna River. This mode of {{transportation}} was considerably faster than walking the path. Conrad Weiser guided Moravian missionaries along the creek and path to reach Onondaga, the capital of the Iroquois Confederacy in 1737. Raiding parties of Indian warriors used the creek and path in 1770 when conducting attacks on the West Branch Susquehanna Valley strongholds of Fort Muncy and Fort Freeland. Colonel Thomas Hartley led the 6th Pennsylvania Regiment up the Sheshequin Path during the American Revolution. Hartley's expedition in 1778 preceded the Sullivan Expedition of 1779. Both Hartley and Sullivan were instrumental in claiming the frontier of Pennsylvania and New York for the forces of the Continental Army. As Hartley and his men passed through Lewis Township, the Sheshequin path was widened. The widening of the path helped <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>this</b> area to settlement in the years following the Revolution.|$|E

2500|$|The tunnel flooded on 16 August 2003 {{after the}} {{automatic}} pumping system failed to sufficiently drain the natural reservoir for water.

A 12-tonne concrete section fell down 28 December 2003, causing the tunnel to close for a week. The tunnel was closed again on 16 January 2004 after geological surveys found a section of unstable rock. Further surveys revealed that the geological evaluations during construction had overestimated the quality of the rock and hence not implemented sufficient countermeasures. As a temporary measure a tentative ferry service was established from February. The issues cost NOK35 million to resolve, and the tunnel could re-open on 2 April.|$|E

He returned to Utah in 1894 and sold butter, cheese, and vegetables in the Mercur and Tintic mining districts. [...] On August 27, 1894, he reportedly had a dream in which the Angel Moroni brought him to a Nephite mine on a nearby mountain. The angel instructed him to reopen this mine and dig new tunnels. According to the angel, the mine would provide financial aid during an economic collapse. [...] The angel showed him nine caverns full of treasures buried by the Nephites, including the Sword of Laban, the Urim and Thummim, and the Gold Plates. The angel told Koyle <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>this</b> mine and that gold would help provide financial relief for the LDS Church and fund the gathering of Israel in the Last Days.|$|E
