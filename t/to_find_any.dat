5|$|On August 21, 1864, the {{soldiers}} began traveling up Fishing Creek. For the next week, they searched the northern portion of Columbia County for deserters and draft evaders. They were unable <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>any,</b> but on August 28 they arrested 100 local citizens. Most were released, although some {{were taken to}} Fort Mifflin. The soldiers continued heading into the northernmost reaches of the Fishing Creek watershed. Unable <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>any</b> evidence of a conspiracy, they returned to Bloomsburg and remained in the county until December 1864. The last of the prisoners were released from Fort Mifflin several months after their arrest.|$|E

The scouts failed <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>any</b> evidence of a military uprising. They raided hen roosts, cornfields, and pigpens that they encountered. At this point Major General George Cadwalader arrived to take command of the soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Agents Scully and Doggett {{arrive at}} the {{operations}} center to investigate. However, they are rudely greeted by Deputy Chief Karras and Lieutenant Bianco of the transit police; the two eagerly want the FBI {{to get the job}} done fast in order that subways can be reopened in five hours, and Karras is also irritated that Scully performed an autopsy on the body. Even after an autopsy, Scully has no idea what killed the man, and the CDC is unable <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>any</b> biological or chemical agents in the subway.|$|E

5|$|Batik was {{mentioned}} in the 17th century Malay Annals. The legend goes when Laksamana Hang Nadim was ordered by Malacca King, Sultan Mahmud, to sail to India to buy 140 pieces of serasah cloth (batik) with 40 types of flowers depicted on each. Unable <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>any</b> that fulfilled the requirements explained to him, he made up his own. On his return unfortunately his ship sank and he only managed to bring four pieces, earning displeasure from the Sultan.|$|E

5|$|During the {{presidency}} of Richard Nixon, a US government investigation was initiated into American involvement in the assassinations. Nixon was a political foe of Kennedy, having narrowly lost {{to him in the}} 1960 Presidential election. Nixon ordered an investigation under E.

5|$|Eventually, unable <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>any</b> {{evidence}} of a fort in the area, the soldiers went back down Fishing Creek to Bloomsburg. Dissatisfied with their findings, the soldiers conducted a search of several unfortified homes in northern Columbia County. They captured a number of residents of Sugarloaf Township on August 31, but these were soon released.|$|E

5|$|The {{evidence}} on the convergence of prices in the eurozone {{with the introduction of}} the euro is mixed. Several studies failed <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>any</b> evidence of convergence following the introduction of the euro after a phase of convergence in the early 1990s. Other studies have found evidence of price convergence, in particular for cars. A possible reason for the divergence between the different studies is that the processes of convergence may not have been linear, slowing down substantially between 2000 and 2003, and resurfacing after 2003 as suggested by a recent study (2009).|$|E

5|$|Banksia violacea {{is one of}} a {{small number}} of Banksia species that has both lignotuberous and non-lignotuberous populations. In both cases, plants are adapted to release their aerial seed bank {{following}} a bushfire, ensuring seedlings are established on clear and relatively fertile ground; however the possession of a lignotuber makes plants much less reliant on fire regime for population maintenance and regeneration, as maternal plants are not killed by bushfire, but resprout from below ground level. Lignotuberous plants generally occur among the north-eastern populations, in the vicinity of Woodanilling. An investigation into the biogeography of these plants failed <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>any</b> vegetative, climatic or other environmental factors associated with the possession of a lignotuber.|$|E
5|$|In a 1980 article, Argentine {{zoologist}} Elio Massoia {{recognized the}} resemblance between Winge's Hesperomys molitor and Hershkovitz's Holochilus magnus, and {{recommended that the}} former be reclassified as a species of Holochilus, Holochilus molitor. When American zoologists Voss and Carleton restudied Winge's material in a 1993 paper, they were unable <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>any</b> consistent {{differences between the two}} and accordingly considered them to pertain to the same species. In addition, they reviewed the differences between this species and other Holochilus and concluded that these were significant enough to place the former in a distinct genus, which they named Lundomys after Lund, who had collected the original material. Since then, the species has been known as Lundomys molitor.|$|E

Throughout them, back story is provided from her childhood that depicts Kate, her twin sister Beth, and their mother being kidnapped. While Kate's father is able to rescue her, it appears as though both her sister and mother have been killed by the time he arrives.|$|E
