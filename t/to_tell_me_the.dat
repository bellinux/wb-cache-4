He started <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> story and said, 'It's got this death-proof car in it.' I said, 'You have to call it Death Proof. I helped title the movie, but that's it." [...] Of the car chases, Tarantino stated, [...] "CGI for car stunts doesn't {{make any sense to}} me—how is that supposed to be impressive? [...] I don't think there have been any good car chases since I started making films in '92—to me, the last terrific car chase was in Terminator 2. And Final Destination 2 had a magnificent car action piece. In between that, not a lot. Every time a stunt happens, there's twelve cameras and they use every angle for Avid editing, but I don't feel it in my stomach. It's just action." ...|$|E

2500|$|I was {{operated}} on that afternoon. As soon as I woke the surgeon, John Bartlett, {{was sitting on}} the end of my bed <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> bi-op was malignant... John found it hard to tell me and I found it hard to accept... I had to ring Mum and Dad in Deniliquin to tell them there was some bad news. Somehow you float through it even though you are scared s---less... The hardest part is the initial part, once you know what's in front of you it gets better. I don't want to trivialise cancer in any way. You have to let the emotion out then sit down and become realistic ... I never asked if my life was in the balance. My parents taught me, my school taught me, sport taught me but in particular cancer taught me that trust is the most powerful emotion we have. I trusted my doctors and nurses implicitly. It was amazing what I learnt about the power of the mind and how important trust is... There were the [...] "how in the hell did I get it?" [...] moments. No one knows, it could have been getting hit in a footy game or a cricket ball 10 years earlier.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{most famous}} Crow leaders to {{encounter}} the Little People was the legendary Crow chief Plenty Coups (Aleek-chea-ahoosh). When he {{was nine years}} old, Plenty Coup's older brother (who was a great warrior and quite handsome, and whom Plenty Coups loved deeply) was killed by raiding Lakotas. Although the tribe was preparing to move out, Plenty Coups fasted for four days, used the sweat lodge, rubbed his body with sage and cedar to remove any smell, and then went into the nearby hills where he had a vision. In his vision, {{the chief of the}} Little People took him into a spirit-world lodge, where Plenty Coups saw representations of nature (the wind, the stars, thunder, the Moon, bad storms, etc.). The dwarf chief demanded that Plenty Coups count coup, but since Plenty Coups was just nine years of age he knew that he had no great deeds to count. Nonetheless, the chief of the Little People recounted two great deeds to the spirits gathered in the lodge, and said that Plenty Coups would not only accomplish these deeds but many others as well. He also prophesied that Plenty Coups would become chief of his people, if he used his wits, and then advised Plenty Coups to develop his willpower so that he could lead his people. [...] "I had a will and I would use it, make it work for me, as the Dwarf-chief had advised. I became very happy, lying there looking up into the sky. My heart began to sing like a bird, and I went back to the village, needing no man <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> meaning of my dream. I took a sweat-bath and rested in my father's lodge. I knew myself now." ...|$|E
