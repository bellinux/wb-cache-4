ESPN's Chantel Jennings tweeted {{a picture of}} such a flag at Crisler Arena on December 4, 2012. One of her followers noted that the big version on the wall was a general fan flag and that a little version of the flag were added next to it for each three pointer he made in the game. By mid-December of his freshman season, <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>in</b> the Maize Rage (Michigan Wolverines men's basketball student section at Crisler Arena) had begun cheering Stauskas on with such a flag. The Michigan Public & Media Relations office started mentioning the flag before Christmas. The flag was mentioned widely in the press as he continued his hot shooting into January.|$|E

25|$|Cheating {{differs from}} most {{other forms of}} {{academic}} dishonesty, in that people can engage in it without benefiting themselves academically at all. For example, a student who illicitly telegraphed answers to a friend during a test would be cheating, even though the student's own work {{is in no way}} affected. Another example of academic dishonesty is a dialogue between students in the same class but in two different time periods, both of which a test is scheduled for that day. If <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>in</b> the earlier time period informs the other student in the later period about the test; that is considered academic dishonesty, even though the first student has not benefited himself.|$|E

The academic assessment of students is undertaken twice within a term, with students writing a mid-term examination and an end-of-term examination, which both contribute to the students cumulative assessment score.|$|E

25|$|Being a koryū, an {{old school}} with a {{traditional}} way of teaching, SMR relies on verbal instructions (as opposed to the detailed manuals of the more modern era) in order to teach {{the large majority of}} the practical applications in the art. The teacher-student relationship is very important to koryu-arts. The training forms (kata) alone do not (and cannot for practical reasons) reveal all the large number of practical applications and variations of the techniques. This can only be done properly by an experienced teacher who spends many years passing on the teachings to <b>the</b> <b>student</b> <b>in</b> person. Many koryū arts have deliberately hidden some, or all, applications inside their training forms, making them invisible unless properly explained by a teacher knowledgeable in the art. This was done as a way of making sure the secrets and principles could not be copied by rival schools or individuals, should an outsider accidentally (or by deliberate spying) observe the techniques in action.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to test the {{effectiveness}} of Van Hiele’s phases of learning geometry using the Geometer’s Sketchpad (GSP) on students’ levels of geometric thinking.
