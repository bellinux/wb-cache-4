40|$|The Finnish energy {{industry}} {{is subject to}} policy decisions regarding renewable energy production and energy efficiency regulation. Conventional electricity generation has environmental side-effects that may cause global warming. Renewable fuels are superior because they offer near-zero net emissions. In this study, we investigated a heating mill's ability to generate electricity from forest fuels in southern Finland on a 1 -year strategic decision-making horizon. The electricity-generation,-purchase, and-sales decisions are made using three different energy efficiency and forest technology rates. Then the decision environment was complicated by the sequence-dependent procurement chains for forest fuels (below-ground) on a tactical decision-making horizon. With this aim, fuel data of three forest fuel procurement teams were collected for 3 months. The strategic fuel procurement decisions were adjusted to the changed decision environment based on a <b>tactical</b> techno-economic <b>analysis</b> using forest technology rates. The optimal energy product and fuel mixtures were solved by minimizing procurement costs, maximizing production revenues, and minimizing energy losses.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} reduce {{redundant}} features in air combat information and {{to meet the requirements}} of real-time decision in combat, rough set theory is introduced to the <b>tactical</b> decision <b>analysis</b> in cooperative team air combat. An algorithm of attribute reduction for extracting key combat information and generating tactical rules from given air combat databases is presented. Then, considering the practical requirements of team combat, a method for reduction of attribute-values under single decision attribute is extended to the reduction under multi-decision attributes. Finally, the algorithm is verified with an example for tactical choices in team air combat. The results show that, the redundant attributes in air combat information can be reduced, and that the main combat attributes, i. e., the information about radar command and medium-range guided missile, can be obtained with the algorithm mentioned above, moreover, the minimal reduced strategy for tactical decision can be generated without losing the result of key information classification. The decision rules extracted agree with the real situation of team air combat...|$|R
