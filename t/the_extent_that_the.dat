5|$|A {{recent study}} of raven {{mitochondrial}} DNA showed that the isolated population from the Canary Islands is distinct from other populations. The study did not include any individuals from the North African population, and its position is therefore unclear, though its morphology {{is very close to}} the population of the Canaries (to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two are often considered part of a single subspecies).|$|E
5|$|Although the Mellotron was {{designed}} to reproduce {{the sound of the}} original instrument, replaying a tape creates minor fluctuations in pitch (wow and flutter), and amplitude, so a note sounds slightly different each time it is played. Pressing a key harder allows the head to come into contact under greater pressure, to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Mellotron responds to aftertouch.|$|E

5|$|Although the Romans {{had a more}} hostile {{attitude}} {{than the}} Greeks towards the Egyptians, some traditions such as mummification and worship of the traditional gods continued. The art of mummy portraiture flourished, and some Roman emperors had themselves depicted as pharaohs, though not to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Ptolemies had. The former lived outside Egypt and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship. Local administration became Roman in style and closed to native Egyptians.|$|E
5|$|Hafnium {{reserves}} {{have been}} infamously estimated to last under 10 years by one source {{if the world}} population increases and demand grows.

5|$|Motifs and {{arrangements}} of figures extend along the lower panels {{from one to}} the next, to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> separations between panels are ignored with the intersections cutting figures in two. This is particularly evident on the lower register where each panel division intersects figures, so that parts of figures are painted on two adjoining panels; whereas Christ and St Michael are enclosed within the single central panel, giving emphasis to the iconography.|$|E

5|$|Recreational divers {{are trained}} in the theory and {{practice}} of decompression to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> certifying agency specifies in the training standard for each certification. This may vary from a rudimentary overview sufficient to allow the diver to avoid decompression obligation for entry level divers, to competence in the use of several decompression algorithms by way of personal dive computers, decompression software, and tables for advanced technical divers. The detailed understanding of decompression theory is not generally required of either commercial or recreational divers.|$|E

Until the 1950s, trams were used for family outings to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Municipal Tramways Trust (MTT) constructed gardens in the suburb of Kensington Gardens, extending the Kensington line to attract customers. By 1945 the MTT was collecting fares for 95million trips annually — 295 trips per head of population.|$|E
5|$|Christianity {{was a major}} unifying factor between Eastern and Western Europe {{before the}} Arab conquests, but the conquest of North Africa sundered {{maritime}} connections between those areas. Increasingly the Byzantine Church differed in language, practices, and liturgy from the Western Church. The Eastern Church used Greek instead of the Western Latin. Theological and political differences emerged, and by the early and middle 8th century issues such as iconoclasm, clerical marriage, and state control of the Church had widened to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cultural and religious differences were greater than the similarities. The formal break, known as the East–West Schism, came in 1054, when the papacy and the patriarchy of Constantinople clashed over papal supremacy and excommunicated each other, {{which led to the}} division of Christianity into two Churches—the Western branch became the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern branch the Eastern Orthodox Church.|$|E

5|$|The Bic Cristal (stylised as BIC Cristal; {{also known}} as the Bic pen) is an {{inexpensive}} disposable ballpoint pen mass-produced and sold by Société Bic of Clichy, Hauts-de-Seine, France. It was first launched in December 1950 and is by far the best selling pen in the world – the 100 billionth was sold in September 2006. It has become the archetypal ballpoint pen and is considered ubiquitous, to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Museum of Modern Art has made it a permanent part of its collection. Its hexagonal form and design mimics a classic lead pencil; it is sold in a variety of colours.|$|E

Tuckey and the forest industry had a close relationship, to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> industry paid for newspaper advertisements that reproduced a letter from Tuckey, following critical coverage of forestry MIS schemes in the media. Great Southern also reproduced Tuckey's letter in their 2000 Annual Report.|$|E
5|$|The weather {{system from}} which Hurricane Alex {{developed}} was first discernible as a disturbance in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) on June17, 2010. Over {{the next few}} days, most of its associated thunderstorm activity was embedded within the ITCZ. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) first mentioned it {{as a candidate for}} tropical cyclone formation on June20, while it was crossing the Windward Islands into the southeastern Caribbean Sea; at the time, some upper-level wind shear was present, leading to conditions only marginally favorable for development. The system moved through the Caribbean, and on June21, it developed to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> NHC assessed a 50%chance of development into a tropical depression within 48hours. The next day, however, the feature deteriorated as thunderstorm activity spread across the Greater Antilles, although the upper-level regime remained favorable for eventual redevelopment.|$|E

5|$|Toward {{the end of}} May 2007, {{the monsoon}} trough spawned a low {{pressure}} area in the eastern Arabian Sea. By May 31, an organized tropical disturbance was located about 645km (400mi) south of Mumbai, India, with cyclonic convection, or thunderstorm activity, and a well-defined mid-level circulation. The disturbance initially lacked a distinct low-level circulation; instead it consisted of strong divergence along {{the western end of}} a surface trough of low pressure. A favorable upper-level environment allowed convection to improve, and by late on June 1, the system developed to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> India Meteorological Department (IMD) classified it as a depression. It tracked westward along the southwestern periphery of a mid-level ridge over southern India. Convection continued to organize, and early on June 2 the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) classified it Tropical Cyclone 02A about 685km (425mi) southwest of Mumbai.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{all other}} Panthera species, jaguars very rarely attack humans. However, jaguar attacks {{appear to be}} on the rise with {{increased}} human encroachment on their habitat and a decrease in prey populations. Sometimes jaguars in captivity attack zookeepers. In addition, it appears that attacks on humans had been more common in the past, at least after Conquistadors arrived in the Americas, to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> jaguar had a fearsome reputation in the Americas, akin to the lion and tiger in the Old World. Nevertheless, even in those times, the jaguar's chief prey was the capybara, not the human, and Charles Darwin reported a saying of Native Americans that people would not have to fear the jaguar much, as long as capybaras were abundant.|$|E
5|$|Within days, Simpson {{was heading}} east again, taking a flying boat to Batavia, where {{he joined the}} advance party of the I Corps, which was being sent from the Middle East to the Dutch East Indies to counter the Japanese threat.

These were soon well in hand, but the tactical situation rapidly deteriorated to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> I Corps was ordered to leave Java on 21 February 1942. Simpson departed on the troop ship Orcades, which arrived in Adelaide on 14 March.|$|E
50|$|In November 1913 the SBB Board {{decided to}} {{electrify}} the Gotthard route from Erstfeld to Biasca, a decision supported by wartime experience. During the First World War, coal shortages curtailed many railway services to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that,</b> by <b>the</b> autumn of 1918 on Sundays, {{with the exception}} of milk trains, no trains were running. Electrification was complete by 1920.|$|R

5|$|Pretorius did {{not name}} a {{successor}} as Commandant-General; {{his eldest son}} Marthinus Wessel Pretorius was appointed in his stead. The younger Pretorius elevated Kruger {{to the rank of}} commandant. Pretorius the son claimed power over not just the Transvaal but also the Orange River area—he said the British had promised it to his father—but virtually nobody, not even supporters like Kruger, accepted this. Following Sir George Cathcart's replacement of Smith as Governor in Cape Town, the British policy towards the Orange River Sovereignty changed to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British were willing to pull out and grant independence to a second Boer republic there. This was {{in spite of the fact}} that in addition to the Boer settlers there were many English-speaking colonists who wanted rule from the Cape to continue. On 23 February 1854 Sir George Russell Clerk signed the Orange River Convention, ending the sovereignty and recognising what the Boers dubbed the Oranje-Vrijstaat ("Orange Free State").|$|E
5|$|The 1994 Imola layout, {{which had}} been in place since 1981, was never again used for a Formula One race. The circuit was heavily {{modified}} following the race, including a change at Tamburello—also the scene of major accidents for Gerhard Berger (1989) and Nelson Piquet (1987)—from a high speed corner to a much slower chicane. The FIA also changed the regulations governing Formula One car design, to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 1995 regulations required all teams to create completely new designs, as their 1994 cars could not be adapted to them. The concern raised at the drivers briefing {{the morning of the}} race, by Senna and Berger, would lead to the Grand Prix Drivers' Association reforming at the following race, the 1994 Monaco Grand Prix. The GPDA, which was founded in 1961, had previously disbanded in 1982. The primary purpose of it reforming was to allow drivers to discuss safety issues with a view to improve standards following the incidents at Imola. The front two grid slots at the Monaco Grand Prix that year, which were painted with Brazilian and Austrian flags, were left clear in memory of the two drivers who had lost their lives, while both Williams and Simtek entered only one car each. Additionally, a minute of silence was observed before the race.|$|E
5|$|The Council on Foreign Relations' {{assessment}} of global finance notes that excessive institutions with overlapping directives and limited scopes of authority, coupled with difficulty aligning national interests with international reforms, {{are the two}} key weaknesses inhibiting global financial reform. Nations do not presently enjoy a comprehensive structure for macroeconomic policy coordination, and global savings imbalances have abounded {{before and after the}} global financial crisis to <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> United States' status as the steward of the world's reserve currency was called into question. Post-crisis efforts to pursue macroeconomic policies aimed at stabilizing foreign exchange markets have yet to be institutionalized. The lack of international consensus on how best to monitor and govern banking and investment activity threatens the world's ability to prevent future global financial crises. The slow and often delayed implementation of banking regulations that meet Basel III criteria means most of the standards will not take effect until 2019, rendering continued exposure of global finance to unregulated systemic risks. Despite Basel III and other efforts by the G20 to bolster the Financial Stability Board's capacity to facilitate cooperation and stabilizing regulatory changes, regulation exists predominantly at the national and regional levels.|$|E
50|$|The idea of {{the natural}} borders of France is a {{political}} theory conceptualized primarily in the late 18th and early 19th centuries that focused on widening the borders primarily based on either practical reasons or <b>the</b> territory <b>that</b> {{was thought to be}} <b>the</b> maximum <b>extent</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> ancient Gauls inhabited.
