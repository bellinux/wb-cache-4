5|$|After {{returning}} to New Orleans, Billy tells Ross {{that he intends}} to retire {{at the end of the}} month and live with his girlfriend Sophia. Later, Ross is forced to accept a mission from CIA operative Mr. Church to retrieve an item from a downed airplane in Albania. Church sends technical expert Maggie Chan with the team. In Albania the Expendables retrieve <b>the</b> <b>item,</b> but are then ambushed by international criminal and arms dealer Jean Vilain, his right-hand man Hector and his mercenary group (the Sangs), who have captured Billy. Vilain demands <b>the</b> <b>item</b> in exchange for Billy's life. The team gives up <b>the</b> <b>item,</b> but Vilain roundhouse kicks a knife through Billy's heart and flees with the Sangs by helicopter. Ross recovers a note for Sophia from Billy's body; the team buries their fallen comrade, swearing vengeance on Vilain.|$|E
5|$|As {{each piece}} of {{wreckage}} was brought in, it was carefully cleaned with fresh water, sorted, and weighed. <b>The</b> <b>item</b> was then placed in a specific area of a hangar at CFB Shearwater, based on a grid system representing the various sections of the plane. All items not considered significant to the crash were stored with similar items in large boxes. When a box was full, it was weighed {{and moved to a}} custom-built temporary structure (J-Hangar) on a discontinued runway for long-term storage. If deemed significant to the investigation, <b>the</b> <b>item</b> was documented, photographed, and kept in the active examination hangar. Particular attention was paid to any item showing heat damage, burns, or other unusual marks.|$|E

5|$|The basic {{function}} of equipment in Final Fantasy games {{is to increase}} character attributes; arming Zidane with a Mythril Vest, for example, increases his base defense statistic. In Final Fantasy IX, weapons and armor include special character abilities, which the character may use when <b>the</b> <b>item</b> is equipped (permitting the ability matches their class). Once the character accumulates enough ability points in battle, the ability becomes usable without having to keep <b>the</b> <b>item</b> equipped. In addition to granting abilities the equipment in Final Fantasy IX determines the statistical growth of the characters {{at the time of}} level up. Armor not only raises base defense or evasion statistics but raises defense and/or other statistics at level up.|$|E
5|$|Actress Shweta Bhardwaj was {{therefore}} selected to perform <b>the</b> <b>item</b> number instead. She was friends with Jagannadh, and he approached her for this song during the film's shoot at Mumbai, {{saying that the}} song suited her and her personality as a dancer. She also tried to {{understand the meaning of}} the lyrics while dancing. Bhardwaj was afraid of dancing, suspecting a possible sprain, and found the costumes uneasy, but had to continue upon the choreographer's insistence. Canadian-born Indian actress Ayesha Shiva was signed to play Kajal's friend in the film.|$|E

5|$|Lemur diets {{are highly}} {{variable}} and demonstrate {{a high degree}} of plasticity, although general trends suggest that the smallest species primarily consume fruit and insects (omnivory), while the larger species are more herbivorous, consuming mostly plant material. As with all primates, hungry lemurs might eat anything that is edible, whether or not <b>the</b> <b>item</b> is one of their preferred foods. For instance, the ring-tailed lemur eats insects and small vertebrates when necessary and as a result it is commonly viewed as an opportunistic omnivore. Coquerel's giant mouse lemur (Mirza coquereli) is mostly frugivorous, but will consume insect secretions during the dry season.|$|E
5|$|Levels contain many {{different}} environment types, including cities, forests, and bogs. At {{the end of}} most levels, the player collects an item called a core or a shard; occasionally, the level begins to disintegrate once the Kid takes <b>the</b> <b>item,</b> forcing him to hastily retreat. As the player progresses through the levels, a voice narrates their actions. This narration gives scripted plot information as well as dynamic comments, such as on the player's skill with a weapon or performance while fighting enemies.|$|E

5|$|The game {{offers a}} number of {{traditional}} Mario items, such as the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower and Starman, along with new power-ups that bestow special suits onto Mario and grant him new abilities. Returning from Super Mario Bros. 3 is the Super Leaf power-up, which gives Mario the Tanooki suit, allowing him to float {{in the air and}} attack with his tail, with a later variant also allowing him to transform into a statue upon performing a ground pound. The player is able to reserve an extra power-up, which can be retrieved by tapping <b>the</b> <b>item</b> visible on the touchscreen.|$|E

Rings can be traded by this password system or randomly created by connecting two games with a Game Link Cable.|$|E
5|$|Urbonas's concept drew media {{attention}} when shown {{as part of}} the HUMAN+ display at the Science Gallery in Dublin from April through June 2011. The display, designated as its 2011 'flagship exhibition' by the Science Gallery, aims to show the future of humans and technology. Within this theme, the Euthanasia Coaster highlights the issues that come with life extension. <b>The</b> <b>item</b> was also displayed at HUMAN+ exhibit at Centre de Cultura Contemporània de Barcelona in 2015.|$|E
5|$|All {{weapons and}} apparel {{found within the}} Wastelands, {{regardless}} of whether they are a makeshift-weapon such as a lead pipe, or a gun, degrade over time the more they are used, and thus become less effective. For firearms, degrading into poor condition causes them to do less damage and possibly jam when reloading, while apparel that reduces damage becomes less protective as it gradually absorbs damage from attacks. When too much damage is taken, the items breaks and cannot be used. To ensure weapons and apparel are working effectively, such items require constant maintenance and repairs which can be done in one of two ways. The first method is find certain vendors that repair items, though how much they can repair an item depends on their skill level, while the cost of the repairs depends upon <b>the</b> <b>item</b> itself. The second method is for players to find a second of the same item that needs repairs (or a comparable item), and salvaging parts from it for the repair, though how much they can do depends on their character's own skill level in repairs.|$|E

5|$|Although not a vegetarian, Winslet, in 2010, narrated a {{video for}} PETA that showed animal cruelty in the {{production}} of foie gras. She encouraged chefs to remove <b>the</b> <b>item</b> from their menu and urged consumers to boycott it. In 2015, Winslet lent her support to the UNICEF campaign World’s Largest Lesson, which creates awareness among children about sustainable development and global citizenship. Teased as a child for her weight, Winslet takes a stand against body-shaming and bullying. She narrated an Australian animated short film named Daisy Chain (2015), about a victim of cyber-bullying. In 2017, Winslet teamed with Leonardo DiCaprio's environmental foundation for a fundraiser on global warming. Also that year, DiCaprio and Winslet auctioned off a private dinner with themselves to raise money for a British mother's cancer treatment.|$|E
5|$|Concept {{development}} for the game began with a small team in 2009. During this phase, the unique gameplay mechanic of Link merging onto walls was prototyped. However, development suffered several setbacks with production of the game ceasing entirely in late 2010, as core team members were reassigned to different projects. A year later, development restarted and after several failed pitches to series creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, the game entered full production in 2012. Changing the established conventions of the series became a goal for the game's designers; {{this led to a}} change in the game's structure, allowing players to tackle and clear the majority of dungeons in any order they choose, and the introduction of <b>the</b> <b>item</b> rental system.|$|E
5|$|During {{excavation}} of the site, four ceramic sherds {{were found in}} the vicinity which the excavator believed were possibly Early Iron Age in origin. Excavation also revealed 830 ceramic sherds dating from Roman Britain; although most of these were dated to the fourth century, the sherds reflected all four centuries of this period. Dated to the fourth century was a hut that had been erected on a flat area adjacent to the barrow. Evidence of human activity at this hut was found in the form of 750 ceramic sherds, charcoal, iron nails, burnt clay, bone, and flint fragments. Examining this assemblage of artefacts, the excavator noted that it was not typical of <b>the</b> <b>item</b> assemblages usually found at Romano-British settlement sites, thus suggesting that the building was a field shelter rather than a house.|$|E
