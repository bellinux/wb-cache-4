40|$|Magnetic {{instruments}} for laparoscopic surgery {{have the potential}} to enhance triangula-tion and reduce invasiveness, as they can be rearranged inside the abdominal cavity and do not need a dedicated port during the procedure. Onboard actuators can be used to achieve a controlled and repeatable motion at the interface with the tissue. However, actuators that can fit through a single laparoscopic incision are very limited in power and do not allow performance of surgical tasks such as lifting an organ.

First, the retracting performance was investigated via a benchtop experiment, by connecting an increasing load to the lever until failure occurred, and repeating this test for different intermagnetic distances. Then, the feasibility of liver resection was studied with an ex vivo experiment, using porcine hepatic tissue. Finally, the usability and the safety of the device were tested in vivo on an anesthetized porcine model. The developed retractor is 154 ???mm long, 12. 5 ???mm in diameter, and weights 39. 16 ???g. When abdominal wall thickness is 2 ???cm, the retractor is able to lift more than ten times its own weight. The model is able to predict the performance with a relative error of 9. 06 ???±??? 0. 52 %. Liver retraction trials demonstrate that the device can be inserted via laparoscopic access, does not require a dedicated port, and can perform organ retraction. The main limitation is the reduced mobility due to the length of the device. In designing robotic instrument for laparoscopic surgery, LMA can enable the transfer of a larger amount of mechanical power than what is possible to achieve by embedding actuators on board. This study shows the feasibility of implementing a <b>tissue</b> <b>retractor</b> based on this approach and provides an illustration of the main steps that should be followed in designing a LMA laparoscopic instrument...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of transcatheter aortic valve implantations, structural heart procedures {{and the newly}} developed transcatheter mitral valve repair and replacement are traditionally performed either through a transfemoral or a transapical access site, depending {{on the presence of}} severe peripheral vascular disease or anatomic limitations. The transapical approach, which carries specific advantages related to its antegrade nature and the short distance between the introduction site and the cardiac target, is traditionally performed through a left anterolateral mini-thoracotomy and requires rib <b>retractors,</b> soft <b>tissue</b> <b>retractors</b> and reinforced apical sutures to secure, at first, the left ventricular apex for the introduction of the stent-valve delivery systems and then to seal the access site {{at the end of the}} procedure. However, despite the advent of low-profile apical sheaths and newly designed delivery systems, the apical approach represents a challenge for the surgeon, as it has the risk of apical tear, life-threatening apical bleeding, myocardial damage, coronary damage and infections. Last but not least, the use of large-calibre stent-valve delivery systems and devices through standard mini-thoracotomies compromises any attempt to perform transapical transcatheter structural heart procedures entirely percutaneously, as happens with the transfemoral access site, or via a thoracoscopic or a miniaturised video-assisted percutaneous technique. During the past few years, prototypes of apical access and closure devices for transapical heart valve procedures have been developed and tested to make this standardised successful procedure easier. Some of them represent an important step towards the development of truly percutaneous transcatheter transapical heart valve procedures in the clinical setting...|$|R
50|$|The Edwards SAPIEN {{family of}} heart valves are {{delivered}} via a procedure called transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). This procedure enables {{the placement of}} a collapsible heart valve into the body via a tube-based delivery system (catheter) that can be inserted through multiple access routes, including either an incision in the leg (transfemoral), or in between the ribs and to be threaded up to the heart (transapical), or through {{the front of the}} chest and then through a small hole in the aorta (transaortic). The valve is designed to replace a patient’s diseased native aortic valve without traditional open-heart surgery and while the heart continues to beat - avoiding the need to stop the patient’s heart and connect them to a heart-lung machine that temporarily takes over the function of the heart and the patient’s breathing during surgery (cardiopulmonary bypass). Edwards also manufactures products for vascular therapy along with hemodynamic monitoring devices for measuring cardiovascular performance during surgery and in the ICU. Hemodynamic monitoring is the measurement of blood circulation and cardiac function that allows clinicians to evaluate whether enough oxygen is being delivered to the organs and tissues. Among these is the Swan-Ganz catheter. Originally developed for patients with acute myocardial infarction, it is now used in anesthesia and critical care units. Healthcare providers use this monitoring to detect changes or problems in a patient’s health, which allows for more informed, immediate treatment decisions. To facilitate on-pump cardiac surgery procedures through smaller incisions, Edwards also offers a cardiac surgery product line comprising soft <b>tissue</b> <b>retractors,</b> venous and arterial cannulae, aortic occlusion, venting, and coronary sinus catheters, as well as reusable instruments for performing minimally invasive valvular procedures.|$|R
50|$|A {{retractor}} is {{a surgical}} instrument with which a surgeon can either actively separate {{the edges of}} a surgical incision or wound, or can hold back underlying organs and tissues, so that body parts under the incision may be accessed. The two are each available in many shapes, sizes, and styles. The general term retractor usually describes a simple handheld steel tool possessing a curved, hooked, or angled blade fitted with a comfortable handle, that when in place maintains the desired position of a given region of <b>tissue.</b> These simple <b>retractors</b> may be handheld, clamped in situ, or suspended {{at the end of}} a robotic arm. Retractors can also be self retaining and not need to be held once inserted by having two or more opposing blades or hooks which are separated via spring, ratchet, worm gear or some other method and pull on opposite sides of a wound. The term retractor is also used to describe the distinct, hand-cranked devices such as rib spreaders (also known as thoracic retractors, or distractors) with which surgeons may forcefully drive tissues apart to obtain the exposure. For specialized situations such as spinal surgery retractors have been fitted both with suction and with fiberoptic lights to keep a surgical wound dry and illuminated.|$|R
40|$|Since the 1990 s, {{minimally}} invasive cardiac surgery has gained wide acceptance due to patient and economic demand. The advantages are less trauma, less bleeding, less wound infections, less pain and faster recovery. Many {{studies showed that}} the outcomes are comparable with those of conventional sternotomy. Right lateral mini-thoracotomy evolved into a routine and safe access in specialized centres for {{minimally invasive}} mitral valve surgery. The 6 -cm incision is performed over the fifth intercostal space in the inframammary groove. With a double-lumen tube, the right lung is deflated before entering the pleural cavity. A soft <b>tissue</b> <b>retractor</b> is used to minimize rib spreading. The stab incisions for the endoscopic camera and the transthoracic clamp are performed in the right anterior and posterior axillary line in the third intercostal space. Surgery on the mitral valve is performed in a standard fashion under a direct vision with video assistance. One chest tube is inserted. The intercostal space is adapted with braided sutures to prevent lung herniation. Ropivacaine is used for local infiltration. The pectoral muscle, subcutaneous tissue and skin are adapted with running sutures. Complications of a right lateral mini-thoracotomy are rare (conversion to sternotomy, rethoracotomy, phrenic nerve palsy, wound infection and thoracic wall hernia) and well manageable...|$|E
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of class III obesity (BMI≥ 40 [*]kg/m 2) in black women is 18 %. As class III obesity leads to hip joint deterioration, black women frequently present for orthopedic care. Weight loss associated with bariatric surgery {{should lead to}} enhanced success of hip replacements. However, we present {{a case of a}} black woman who underwent Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with the expectation that weight loss would make her a better surgical candidate for hip replacement. Her gastric bypass was successful as her BMI declined from 52. 0 [*]kg/m 2 to 33. 7 [*]kg/m 2. However, her hip circumference after weight loss remained persistently high. Therefore, at surgery the soft tissue tunnel geometry presented major challenges. Tunnel depth and immobility of the soft <b>tissue</b> interfered with <b>retractor</b> placement, <b>tissue</b> reflection, and surgical access to the acetabulum. Therefore a traditional cup placement could not be achieved. Instead, a hemiarthroplasty was performed. After surgery her pain and reliance on external support decreased. But her functional independence never improved. This case demonstrates that a lower BMI after bariatric surgery may improve the metabolic profile and decrease anesthesia risk, but the success of total hip arthroplasties remains problematic if fat mass in the operative field (i. e., high hip circumference) remains high...|$|R
40|$|The {{roles of}} hormones, second {{messengers}} and pH in triggering or potentiating biochemical responses to anaerobiosis were evaluated using in vitro incubations of isolated muscle <b>tissues</b> (foot, radular <b>retractor,</b> ventricle) from the marine whelk Busycon canaliculatum (L.). Incubating tissues in vitro under anoxic conditions stimulated changes in muscle fmctose- 2, 6 -bisphosphate levels and pyruvate kinase kinetics (Km values for phosphoenolpyruvate, / 50 values for L-alanine) that were virtually equivalent {{to those that}} occur in vivo. Additions of hormones (epinephrine, norepinephrine, octopamine, serotonin, glucagon, insulin) or inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis (dexamethasone, aspirin) {{had no effect on}} these metabolic responses to anoxia. The second messenger compounds, dibutyryl cyclic AMP and Ca 2 + + ionophore A 23187 + phorbol myristate acetate, produced isolated and tissue-specific responses in muscles incubated under aerobic conditions, but the magnitude and pattern of these responses differed from those seen in anoxia. Second messengers also had no effect on the development of biochemical responses in anoxic muscles. Tissue pH was artificially altered in order to evaluate the role of pH change (acidification occurs during anoxia in vivo) in the control of metabolic responses to anoxia. In all cases, the changes in the kinetic properties of pyruvate kinase (PK) correlated with the state of oxygenation of the tissue and not with the measured tissue pH value; higher tissue pH did not prevent anoxiainduced phosphorylation of PK and lower tissue pH did not alter the kinetic patterns of the aerobic enzyme. Overall, the study indicates that cells and tissues of the whelk respond individually to anoxia and that coordination of the action of protein kinases during anoxia is not mediated by pH or by common secondmessenger mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Brain {{retractors}} applied during {{brain surgery}} may induce local changes in cerebral perfusion. Cerebral microdialysis (MD) is a recently available tool for monitoring local cerebral metabolism. In the present study, we evaluated whether MD revealed {{any changes in}} local metabolism in the brain area under the retractor and in the vascular territory of surgery. Patients and Methods: With IRB approval, 38 pts scheduled for large frontal tumor resection received peroperative MD. After opening of the dura, the MD catheter was inserted into the brain cortex and was perfused at 5 	l/min enabling analysis (for glucose, lactate, pyruvate, glycerol and glutamate) of the dialysates every 5 min. A brain retractor was finally applied {{for the period of}} tumor resection above the area of MD catheter insertion. Results: Insertion of brain retractors resulted in a overall decrease in local glucose, most probably due to a decrease in local perfusion. In all patients, we observed a shortlasting increase in local glucose after removal of the brain retractor. In most (32 pts) of the 38 patients, there was moreover a further marked decrease in glucose during the whole period of brain retraction. In all these pts, we observed an increase in local lactate concentration. In 14 of these 32 patients, we observed an increase in lactate/pyruvate ratio. We observed that 5 of these 14 episodes went along with a large increase in glycerol. In 4 of these patients, no neurosurgical peroperative complications were observed, except for one patient. In this patient, the ischemic pattern was observed 15 min before a major neurosurgical warning sign (extensive brain bulging) occurred. Retrieval of the retractor resulted in an immediate normalization of all parameters. Only in the last patient, an extensive increase in glutamate was observed. Postoperative outcome was uneventful for all patients, except for this last one. Conclusion: Use of MD during routine brain retraction revealed the possible presence of pronounced local cerebral ischemia under the retractor. Peroperative use of high flow MD, enabling almost on-line metabolic monitoring of brain <b>tissue</b> under the <b>retractor,</b> might become a valuable warning tool during those neurosurgical procedures necessitating extensive brain retraction. status: publishe...|$|R
