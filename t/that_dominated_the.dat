5|$|Helped {{by strong}} line play, Graham, Motley and Cleveland ends Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie led a potent offense <b>that</b> <b>dominated</b> <b>the</b> AAFC for three years. The Browns won the AAFC {{championship}} in 1947, 1948 and 1949 before the league disbanded and Cleveland was {{absorbed by the}} more established NFL. Humble was a consensus second-team All-Pro selection in 1948, when Cleveland won all of its games. Cleveland's success continued in the NFL in 1950, when Humble was used on occasion as a linebacker on defense. The Browns finished {{the season with a}} 10–2 record and beat the Los Angeles Rams in the NFL championship game. Humble was selected to play in the first-ever Pro Bowl, the NFL's all-star game.|$|E
5|$|Major {{construction}} at Tikal was already {{taking place in}} the Late Preclassic period, first appearing around 400–300 BC, including the building of major pyramids and platforms, although the city was still dwarfed by sites further north such as El Mirador and Nakbe. At this time, Tikal participated in the widespread Chikanel culture <b>that</b> <b>dominated</b> <b>the</b> Central and Northern Maya areas at this time – a region that included the entire Yucatan Peninsula including northern and eastern Guatemala and all of Belize.|$|E
5|$|On 17 November, {{fighting}} for the main position around Sattelberg commenced. The previous night, in order {{to prepare for the}} attack on the 2200 feature, the 2/48th Battalion captured Green Ridge, a small but important feature <b>that</b> <b>dominated</b> <b>the</b> Sattelberg road. The capture of the ridge secured a start line forward of Jivevaneng for Whitehead's 26th Brigade to launch the first stage of their attack upon Sattelberg. The following day, the 2/48th Battalion handed over responsibility for the defence of the ridge to a company from the 2/23rd Battalion, and the attack commenced amidst heavy supporting artillery and machine-gun fire. In response, the Japanese artillery from Sattelberg fired a limited barrage onto the Australians on Green Ridge.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, 29 August, the Japanese renewed their attack. In {{possession of}} the ridges <b>that</b> <b>dominated</b> <b>the</b> Australian position {{from both sides of}} the valley in which it sat, the Japanese were able to lay down considerable volumes of mortar and machine gun fire in support of their assaults. Unable to respond with similar firepower, the Australian perimeter began to shrink. It was during this stage of the fighting that Private Bruce Kingsbury of the 2/14th made a unique individual contribution to the campaign and was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross as a result. Kingsbury's was the first Victoria Cross awarded for actions on Australian soil.|$|E
5|$|This {{major change}} from a Classical design to a far more complex revival style, little known in Russia, meant Vorontsov had to find an {{alternative}} architect to execute a new design. This was further complicated by Vorontsov's desire to not only have a loose Jacobean style, but also to incorporate motifs from Islamic architecture so as to highlight the oriental strain evident in the Khan's Palace, Enikale Fort, and other local Tatar architecture. The resulting design was to highlight the Crimea's position {{as a place where}} the East and West meet. It was a radical departure from the Neoclassical strain <b>that</b> <b>dominated</b> <b>the</b> Russian architecture of the period.|$|E
5|$|On 20 October, Bazaine's {{infantry}} conducted reconnaissance toward Kherson and met no organized resistance before withdrawing. After {{they returned}} to Kinburn, the French and British commanders determined that the fort could be rebuilt and held through the upcoming winter. A force of 1,700 men was left behind to garrison the position, along with the three ironclad batteries. The rest of the force returned to the Crimea. Though the British had initially considered continuing up the Dneiper to capture Nikolaev, it became clear after the seizure of Kinburn that {{to do so would}} require much larger numbers of soldiers to clear the cliffs <b>that</b> <b>dominated</b> <b>the</b> river than had been originally estimated. The British planned to eventually launch an offensive to take Nikolaev in 1856, but the war ended before it could be begun.|$|E
50|$|Economists {{debate whether}} a single reserve {{currency}} will always <b>dominate</b> <b>the</b> global economy. Many have recently argued that one currency will almost always dominate due to network externalities, {{especially in the}} field of invoicing trade and denominating foreign debt securities, meaning that there are strong incentives to conform to <b>the</b> choice <b>that</b> <b>dominates</b> <b>the</b> marketplace. The argument is that, in the absence of sufficiently large shocks, a currency <b>that</b> <b>dominates</b> <b>the</b> marketplace will not lose much ground to challengers.|$|R

5|$|Québécois cartoonists would {{propose a}} number of strips {{to compete with the}} American strips <b>that</b> <b>dominated</b> <b>the</b> Sundays and dailies. The native Québec {{presence}} on those pages would become more dominant after 1940, however, with the introduction of the War Exchange Conservation Act, which restricted the import of foreign strips. Albert Chartier created the comical character Onésime in 1943, a strip that would have the longest run of any in Québec. After World War II, during the Great Darkness, comics publication became dominated with religious comics, most of which were imported from the US. Native Québec comics did flourish for a brief period between 1955 and 1960, however, but were soon replaced again with American content, while also facing competition from the new Franco-Belgian publications, which appeared in full-colour, and by the mid-1960s had put the local Catholic publications out of business.|$|E
5|$|The Danubian {{emperors}} {{ruled the}} empire {{for over a}} century, until 379. Indeed, until 363, power was held by descendants {{of one of the}} original Junta members. Constantine I' s father, Constantius Chlorus, was a Caesar (deputy emperor) in Diocletian's Tetrarchy. Constantine's grandson Julian ruled until 363. These emperors restored the army to its former strength and effectiveness, but were solely concerned with the needs and interests of the military. They were also divorced from the wealthy Roman senatorial families <b>that</b> <b>dominated</b> <b>the</b> Senate and owned much of the empire's land. This in turn bred a feeling of alienation from the army among the Roman aristocracy which in the later 4th century began to resist the military's exorbitant demands for recruits and supplies.|$|E
5|$|The confessional {{conflicts}} <b>that</b> <b>dominated</b> <b>the</b> {{relations between}} the ruling city authorities were only secondary to the peasants of the Huttwil league. The peasant alliance bridged the confessional divide, uniting Catholic people from the Entlebuch and from Solothurn with Protestant peasants from the Emmental and from Basel. The treaty of Huttwil explicitly recognized this biconfessionalism. The cities remained in all their manoeuvring and negotiations for military support within their respective confessional spheres: Catholic Lucerne had requested mediation and then military help from the Catholic central Swiss cantons, while Protestant Bern had turned to Protestant Zürich for help. The distrust between the authorities of the Catholic and Protestant cantons was so deep that none would allow troops of the other confession to operate on their territories.|$|E

25|$|Yoga Vasistha is {{considered}} one of the most important texts of the Vedantic philosophy.

25|$|The {{combination}} of these two forces—a flawed Habsburg administrative system and new national movement claiming ethnicity as the founding block toward a community—posed a particularly perplexing problem: Dalmatia was a province ruled by the German-speaking Habsburg monarchy, with bilingual (Croatian- and Italian-speaking) elites <b>that</b> <b>dominated</b> <b>the</b> general population consisting of a Croatian Catholic majority (and a Slavic Orthodox minority).|$|E
