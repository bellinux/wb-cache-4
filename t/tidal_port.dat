40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} allocating berth positions for vessels in <b>tidal</b> bulk <b>port</b> terminals. A berth {{is defined as a}} specific location alongside a quay where a ship loader is available for loading or unloading vessels, accommodating only one vessel at a time. In <b>tidal</b> <b>ports,</b> draft conditions depend on high tide conditions, since available depth at low tide is not adequate for the movement of ships. Some port terminals are associated with important transnational enterprises which maintain strong control over the stock level of their goods. Since the stock level sometimes depends on a continuous process of consumption or production of minerals, the decision to load or unload vessels must {{consider the}} amount of the bulk cargo stored in the port yards. Therefore, a basic criterion for decision making is to give priority to the vessels related to the most critical mineral stock level. A second basic criterion is to decide what sequence of vessels reduces the overall demurrage within a given planning horizon. This paper presents an integer linear programming model based on the transportation problem to represent the Berth Allocation Problem in <b>Tidal</b> Bulk <b>ports</b> with Stock level conditions (BAPTBS). Problem instances are solved by a commercial solver and by a Simulated Annealing-based algorithm (SA). The SA employs a problem-specific heuristic, becoming a valid alternative for finding out good solutions for difficult instances. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Pages: 606 - 61...|$|R

There were also several Sieges of Stirling Castle in the conflict, notably in 1304. Another important historical site in the area is the ruins of Cambuskenneth Abbey, the resting place of King James III of Scotland and his queen, Margaret of Denmark. The king died at the Battle of Sauchieburn by forces nominally led by his son and successor James IV. During the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, the Battle of Stirling also took place in the centre of Stirling on 12 September 1648. The fortifications continued to play a strategic military role during the 18th century Jacobite Risings. In 1715, the Earl of Mar failed {{to take control of the}} castle. In January 1746, the army of Bonnie Prince Charlie seized control of the town but failed to take the Castle. On their consequent retreat northwards, they blew up the church of St. Ninians where they had been storing munitions; only the tower survived and can be seen to this day. The castle and the church are shown on Blaeu's map of 1654 which was derived from Pont's earlier map.|$|E

The <b>Port</b> of Seville contains over 2700 m of berths for public use and 1100 m of private berths. These docks and berths are used for solid and liquid bulk cargoes, roll-on/roll-off cargoes, containers, private vessels and cruise ships.|$|R
50|$|Those linkspans {{designed}} originally for train ferries {{were therefore}} very restricting {{for the new}} general-purpose ferries. Dover, {{which was one of}} the earliest <b>tidal</b> rail ferry <b>ports,</b> continued to adopt the “precise fit” approach so that road vehicular ferries had to have the exact beam to fit a berth. Their bow and stern configuration also had to conform to fit with the guide fenders to allow the vessel to “nest” into them. At the bow it was necessary to fit a “moustache” which is a steel structure projecting from the stem. Such ships have neither a support ledge nor drawbridge ramps: the link across the gap between ship and linkspan is bridged by flaps about 2 - 2.5 m long. When stowed these flaps stow vertically to the end of the linkspan and in so doing prevent a ramped vessel lowering its ramp. Most of the other <b>tidal</b> rail-ferry <b>ports</b> initially adopted this arrangement in the English Channel, North Sea and Irish Sea routes but have now moved away to the more flexible arrangement described below. Dover/Calais route, one of the busiest in the world, still require that vessels using these ports are configured to suit the restraints of each berth, in doing so this limits them from being used in service elsewhere.|$|R

40|$|Merged with {{duplicate}} record 10026. 1 / 1297 on 20. 03. 2017 by CS (TIS) The Southwest Region, {{as defined by}} the SW Regional Development Agency, forms an extended peninsula with a coastline of 1, 020 km, the longest of any region in England. All along this coastline are fishing ports, commercial ports, small wharves, closed ports, ferry ports and leisure ports. Amongst the smallest are a dozen <b>tidal</b> <b>ports,</b> tiny harbours and rocky wharfs that still maintain a commercial trade of local and environmental significance. According to most theories of port development these ports should close, being forced out of business by larger, more efficient ports. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with fifteen people who were involved with five small ports or port areas in the Southwest region. They represented commercial, local government or local resident interests. The research was carried out using grounded theory methodology, which aims to create theory through inductive analysis of the data. An ecological theory of port competition emerged, which explains how a small port succeeds because it is adapted to a market niche within which it enjoys a unique competitive advantage. Small ports are, however, extremely vulnerable to relatively small changes in the external environment, especially as port town land has a high opportunity cost in terms of the housing, retail and leisure developments that could profitably be made on the land. The institutional environment (including the support of the local council) and economic environment are the two most important indicators for {{the success or failure of}} a small port. In terms of regional competitiveness, a small port contributes to the competitiveness of its region as a business in the traded sector and a facilitator of traded businesses.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of sediment transport processes and resultant concentration dynamics in estuaries {{is of great}} importance to engineering design awareness and the management of these environments. Predictive modelling approaches {{provide an opportunity to}} investigate and address potential system responses to nominated events, changes, or conditions of interest, often on high temporal and spatial resolution scales. In this study, a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model and wave model were validated and applied to generate forcing conditions for input into a sediment transport model for the period 7 May 2010 – 30 October 2010 within a macro <b>tidal</b> estuary, <b>Port</b> Curtis estuary (Australia). The hydrodynamic model was verified against surface and near-bottom current measurements. The model accurately reproduced the variations of surface and near-bottom currents at both a mid-estuary and upper-estuary location. Sediment transport model predictions were performed under varying meteorological conditions and tidal forcing over a 180 -day period and were validated against turbidity data collected at six stations within Port Curtis estuary. The sediment transport model was able to predict both the magnitudes of the turbidity levels and the modulation induced by the neap and spring tides and wind-wave variations. The model-predicted (converted) turbidity levels compared favourably with the measured surface water turbidity levels at all six stations. The study results have useful practical application for Port Curtis estuary, including providing predictive capabilities to support the selection of locations for monitoring/compliance sites...|$|R

30|$|Ammonia sp. {{are widely}} {{distributed}} in many coastal environments, including <b>tidal</b> flats, <b>ports,</b> and brackish lakes. Because of its resistance {{to a wide}} range of environmental variables, it is a genus popularly employed in laboratory cultures. It is also used to study geochemical signatures as a function of physical and chemical conditions. Further, Ammonia sp. serve as model species, whose chamber wall structure resembles that of many Rotalid species. The calcification of Ammonia sp. is characterized by strong gradients in pH and/or pCO 2 between the site of calcification and the foraminiferal microenvironment. The results suggest that foraminiferal calcification would be regulated by DIC concentration rather than the calcite saturation state (Fig.  12). This uncoupling of saturation state and calcification explains the moderate response of many foraminifera to OA and the occurrence of calcareous foraminiferal communities at undersaturated conditions with respect to calcite but at high DIC concentrations (Keul et al. 2013; Flako-Zaritsky et al. 2011). The reduction in oceanic pH by increased oceanic CO 2 uptake is relatively small compared with the pH decrease in the microenvironment during Ammonia’s calcification. Hence, a relatively moderate decrease in pH may not impair foraminiferal calcification. Proton pumping is found to be the fundamental strategy for a variety of marine calcifiers (Ries 2011 a). The high internal pH and large internal–external pH gap associated with foraminiferal calcification predicts that they may well produce more carbonate ions at the site of calcification even under elevated pCO 2.|$|R
500|$|Prior to its opening, Tennant {{estimated}} that the canal would carry 99,994 tons per year, and generate £7,915 in income. Traffic built up, and by the 1830s, annual tonnage was around 90,000 tons, but revenues were less than anticipated, and produced a profit of about £2,500 per year. Initially, it {{was known as the}} Neath and Swansea Junction Canal, but by 1845 it had become known as the Tennant Canal. The water was [...] deep between Red Jacket and Aberdulais, and [...] deep from Red Jacket to Swansea harbour. This provided a large reservoir of water, which was used to scour the <b>tidal</b> basin at <b>Port</b> Tennant. Boats typically carried 25 tons, which allowed them to work on the Neath Canal as well. Several short branches were built, including one to the Vale of Neath Brewery which opened in 1839 and was privately funded by the brewery.

50|$|The present {{township}} of Paterson, situated six kilometres to {{the north}} of the original military station at Old Banks, was the third to be surveyed in the Hunter Valley after Newcastle and Maitland, but was not proclaimed until 1833. With the continuing settlement of the district, Paterson soon became an important <b>tidal</b> river <b>port</b> and service centre to the surrounding community. Many early settlers were Scots and hence a Presbyterian Church preceded an Anglican establishment. Indeed, St Ann's, built in the late 1830s, is said to be the oldest Presbyterian Church on mainland Australia. The river trade began to decline in the 1850s as the road to Maitland improved. Timber mills were established by the 1870s. In its heyday Paterson had four stores, five hotels, two shipyards, a sawmill, a tannery, four blacksmiths, two butchers, a bakery and a boarding school for girls. Shipbuilding also commenced with the development of the river trade and considerable supplies of tobacco were grown, as well as grains, grapes, wine, citrus fruits and cotton were transported by steamboats to Morpeth, Newcastle and Sydney.By the time the railway arrived in 1911 the long-term decline of river transportation had taken its toll. With ironic symbolism the railway line passed directly over the wharf and a mishap during the construction of the railway bridge in 1909 sunk one of the local boats, the Anna Maria, which had been contracted to carry the BHP made girders. The boat was salvaged but was nearly destroyed again when a spark from a steam train set it ablaze. The last steam boats visited the area in the 1930s.|$|R
40|$|Avicennia and Rhizophora are {{globally}} occurring mangrove genera {{with different}} traits that {{place them in}} different parts of the intertidal zone. It is generally accepted that the oxidizing capacity of Avicennia roots is larger than that of Rhizophora roots, which initiates more reduced conditions in the soil below the latter genus. We hypothesize that the more reduced conditions beneath Rhizophora stands lead to more active sulfate-reducing microbial communities compared to Avicennia stands. To test this hypothesis, we measured sulfate reduction traits in soil samples collected from neighboring Avicennia germinans and Rhizophora mangle stands at three different locations in southern Florida. The traits measured were sulfate reduction rates (SRR) in flow-through reactors containing undisturbed soil layers in the absence and presence of easily degradable carbon compounds, copy numbers of the dsrB gene, which is specific for sulfate-reducing microorganisms, and numbers of sulfate-reducing cells that are able to grow in liquid medium on a mixture of acetate, propionate and lactate as electron donors. At the <b>tidal</b> locations <b>Port</b> of the Islands and South Hutchinson Islands, steady state SRR, dsrB gene copy numbers and numbers of culturable cells were higher at the A. germinans than at the R. mangle stands, although not significantly for the numbers at Port of the Islands. At the non-tidal location North Hutchinson Island, results are mixed with respect to these sulfate reduction traits. At all locations, the fraction of culturable cells were significantly higher at the R. mangle than at the A. germinans stands. The dynamics of the initial SRR implied a more in situ active sulfate-reducing community at the intertidal R. mangle stands. It was concluded that in agreement with our hypothesis R. mangle stands accommodate a more active sulfate-reducing community than A. germinans stands, but only at the tidal locations. The differences between R. mangle and A. germinans stands were absent at the non-tidal, impounded location...|$|R
40|$|Lombok Strait is {{one part}} of Indonesia Through Flow (ITF), {{important}} for national and international maritime economic. The strait is passed by ITF, i. e., a displacement water from the Pacific Ocean into the Indian Ocean caused by {{a difference in the}} sea water level. ITF flows across the Makassar Strait to south direction and passes through the smaller straits along Bali to Flores. ITF pattern is influenced by its local area condition which creates unique characteristics in each place. ITF passes through the Lombok Strait in part directly related to the Indian Ocean, as well as a very diverse state bathymetry of shallow ocean to ocean trenches. Various oceanographic phenomena affect ITF in the Lombok Strait: tides and waves are formed due to the interaction between the ocean currents from the Indian Ocean to the Lombok Strait, met with ITF flowing from the Lombok Strait into the Indian Ocean. As tides, currents are influenced by the tides that have harmonic components, but there are differences in the frequency and phase are formed. Harmonic component is one of indicators in determining the characteristics of a body of water. The {{purpose of this study is}} to obtain the derived harmonic components by analysing currents data in the Lombok Strait acquired from The International Nusantara Stratification and Transport (INSTANT) Expedition Mooring Deployment 1 conducted in 2004 to 2005. Based on the analysis it is known that the characteristic harmonic currents in the Lombok Strait is influenced by significant harmonic components such as Solar Semi Annual (SSA) and Solar Annual (SA) constituents be used, as the result of harmonic analyses of <b>tidal</b> data at <b>ports</b> all over the world reveal that they are dominated by the seasonal variations of sun...|$|R

The Secretary read a letter, from which {{the following is an}} extract, forwarded by Mr. Boyd, of Port Arthur, giving a detailed description by one of the overseers (Mr. F. A. Keith) of the remarkable tidal disturbance at Long Bay, of the 15 th August, which, as is well known, occurred on the same day along the shores of all the Australian colonies and New Zealand :—"At 9 a. m., at low water, a huge wave was seen entering the Bay from the open sea, at the rate (as estimated) of about 11 or 12 milea per hour. The force was such that logs of heavy blue gum timber, which for years had been embedded in the sand, were washed ashore. A launch at anchor in the Bay, was driven for a distance of 100 yards, dragging her anchor and chain cable. A length of about 50 yards of a substantially built wooden jetty was swept away, and the rush of the water was so rapid that several men at work on the jetty only saved their lives by leaping into a launch which they had been engaged in loading. The water having thus risen to the height of seven feet, receded as rapidly to the extent of ten feet, the rise and fall together having occupied only fifteen minutes. During the day many waves of a similar character rolled into the Bay, the last, which occurred at a late hour, being even greater than the one described, but as its rise and fall were much more slow and gradual, the effects were not so remarkable. ...|$|R
