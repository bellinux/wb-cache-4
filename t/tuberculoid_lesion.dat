40|$|A 5 -year-old contact of a lepromatous leprosy {{patient with}} a <b>tuberculoid</b> <b>lesion</b> on the {{anterior}} aspect of the shaft of the penis is reported. The child was clinically suspected to have borderline tuberculoid leprosy during a survey of contacts of leprosy patients, which on histopathology revealed features of subpolar tuberculoid leprosy. The father of the child was recently detected as a case of lepromatous leprosy and was started on multibacillary regime of WHO multidrug therapy. The reason for the localization of the lesion to the shaft of the penis is also suggested. Skin as a route of transmission of tuberculoid leprosy is also emphasized...|$|E
40|$|Cryostat {{sections}} of full-thickness skin biopsies from 21 patients along the whole spectrum of leprosy {{were subjected to}} immunohistological examination with special regard to defective lymphokine production. There was an inverse relationship between intra-lesional IL- 1 reactivity and IL- 2 R expression, in that the latter was markedly observed in <b>tuberculoid</b> <b>lesions.</b> Whenever epithelioid cell containing granulomas were present in paucibacillary forms, significant reactivity within the central phagocytic cells with the monoclonal antibody directed against interferon-gamma was detectable. The keratinocytes covering <b>tuberculoid</b> <b>lesions</b> abundantly expressed class II alloantigens (HLA-DR antigens), indicating high intra-lesional interferon-gamma activity. In contrast, multibacillary forms revealed significant anti-IL- 1 reactivity within the cellular infiltrate. IL- 2 R bearing cells were virtually absent as was anti-HLA-DR reactivity of the keratinocytes, underlining a defective intra-lesional interferon-gamma activity...|$|R
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{forms of}} leprosy constitute a spectrum that correlates {{closely with the}} degree of cell-mediated immunity. Patients with tuberculoid leprosy develop strong cell-mediated responses and have only a few, localized lesions, whereas patients with multibacillary lepromatous leprosy are specifically unresponsive to antigens of Myobacterium leprae. T cells of the CD 4 + subset predominate in <b>tuberculoid</b> <b>lesions,</b> whereas CD 8 + cells predominate in lepromatous lesions. Monoclonal antibodies that distinguish subpopulations of CD 4 + and CD 8 + cells were {{used to analyze the}} distribution of T cells infiltrating lesions across the disease spectrum. In lepromatous lesions, T cells of T-suppressor phenotype (9. 3 -) were the predominant CD 8 + cells and suppressor/inducer cells (2 H 4 +, Leu- 8 +) represented half of the CD 4 + subset. In <b>tuberculoid</b> <b>lesions,</b> helper T cells (CD 4 + 4 B 4 +) outnumbered suppressor/inducer T cells by 14 : 1, compared with a ratio of 1. 2 : 1 in peripheral blood. Analysis of the precursor frequency of antigen-reactive T cells permitted us to estimate that there was a 100 -fold enrichment of T cells able to proliferate in response to M. leprae antigens in <b>tuberculoid</b> <b>lesions</b> (2 / 100), when compared with blood from the same patients. The methods used here to characterize the T-lymphocyte subsets and frequency of antigen-reactive T cells in leprosy may be useful in analyzing immunological reactions occurring in lesions of other inflammatory and autoimmune diseases...|$|R

40|$|The immune {{responses}} to Mycobacterium leprae and other mycobacterial antigens were studied in 11 leprosy patients with concurrent {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) infection. Three patients manifested borderline lepromatous leprosy, and eight patients had borderline tuberculoid (BT) leprosy. Despite the low CD 4 + T-cell count in the peripheral blood, no histologic or phenotypic change in the cellular infiltrate in either the lepromatous or <b>tuberculoid</b> <b>lesions</b> was observed when compared with HIV- 1 -negative patients. Lepromatous lesions contained heavily parasitized macrophages and few CD 8 + T cells. Lesions from the patients with BT leprosy showed extensive CD 4 + T-cell infiltration despite {{a significant reduction in}} CD 4 + T-cell counts in the peripheral blood. No acid-fast bacilli were detected in the <b>tuberculoid</b> <b>lesions.</b> HIV- 1 infection did not alter the lack of response in lepromatous leprosy to M. leprae antigens either in vitro or in vivo. In contrast, the skin test response to M. leprae antigens as well as the in vitro lymphoproliferative {{responses to}} mycobacterial antigens that are usually seen in patients with tuberculoid leprosy were abrogated in the BT HIV- 1 + patients. However, production of gamma interferon in response to the same stimuli was preserved in most of the patients. Analysis of cytokine gene expression showed activation of additional cytokine genes in the unstimulated peripheral blood cells of patients with both leprosy and HIV- 1 infections as compared with cells from patients with leprosy alone. These results suggest that granuloma formation in leprosy can be independent of the impaired CD 4 + T-cell response of the HIV- 1 infection. Furthermore, in HIV- 1 + individuals with M. leprae infection, activation of cytokine genes is observed even when the circulating CD 4 + T-cell count is significantly reduced...|$|R
40|$|A case of late stage {{cutaneous}} leishmaniasis with focal caseous necrosis is reported. The patient, a 30 year old Tunisian man, presented with idiopathic bone marrow aplasia. Microscopically, minimal changes {{were observed in}} the epidermis: slight hyperkeratosis and moderate acanthosis. Lesions predominated in the dermis. Epithelioid granulomas {{were found in the}} lower dermis. Some of these lesions were clearly surrounded by a ring of lymphocytes and were rarely confluent. A peculiar histological feature was the presence of focal acidophilic and slightly granular necrosis at the centre of some the <b>tuberculoid</b> <b>lesions.</b> Focal fibrinoid necrosis was found in the upper dermis, outside granulomas. A mild to moderate infiltrate of histiocytes, lymphocytes and plasma cells, with scanty neutrophils, was observed mainly in the upper dermis. No intracellular or extracellular Leishman-Donovan bodies were observed. Acid fast mycobacteria, however, were not detected. Leishmaniasis was diagnosed on culture of skin biopsy specimens. The presence of caseous necrosis could lead to diagnostic confusion and result in an erroneous diagnosis of, for example, tuberculosis, syphilis, acne agminata, and sarcoidosis with fibrinoid necrosis. This is especially the case when parasites are scanty or absent...|$|R
40|$|Increased Langerhans cell {{accumulation}} after mycobacterial stimuli Aims: To {{evaluate the}} role of Langerhans cells (LCs) in the local activation of leprosy lesions. LCs, acting as tolerance inducers and immune stimuli, are dendritic cells recently implicated in cutaneous homeostasis. The role of LCs in the defence against mycobacterial infection remains poorly understood. Methods and results: The number and distribution of CD 1 a+ skin cells and HLA-DR and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) - 1 expression were analysed in leprosy skin lesions and in delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) tests. The results showed {{a high number of}} LCs in tuberculin and lepromin tests, in <b>tuberculoid</b> <b>lesions</b> and in the epidermis and dermis during type I and II reactions. In multibacillary lesions, however, the number of LCs was consistently low in comparison with other groups. Increased numbers of LCs were accompanied by marked HLA-DR and ICAM- 1 expression, suggesting a strong relationship between these immunological events. Conclusions: CD 1 a+ cells are implicated in the local immunological events taking place after mycobacterial stimuli and may account for the local activation of all types of reactional episodes in leprosy...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{vascular}} flow in paucibacillary leprosy {{was assessed}} photoplethysmography (PPG). In PPG, infra-red {{light emitting diode}} and an adjacent photosensor detect the blood flow in cutaneous capillaries, as represented graphically on a strip-chart. In 29 (6 F, 23 M) untreated paucibacillary leprosy patients (7 TT, 16 BT and 6 purely neural type) having ailment on limb/limbs, suffering for 5 months to 12 years, PPG recording were done by applying the device to the distal phalanges of all the digits of four limbs serially with Velcro-strap at an ambient temperature of 28 &#x 00 B 0;C - 30 &#x 00 B 0;C and humidity of 60 - 70 percent. Diminished digital vascular flow of the affected limb/limbs was seen in long-standing cases suffering for > 2 years irrespective of the type, site, morphology or phase (reactional) of the disease. This may be mostly due to specific vascular changes rather than reactional or functional changes. Specific vascular changes are terminal arteritis, vasculitis of vasa nervorum or truncular arteritis, i. e [...] <b>tuberculoid</b> <b>lesions</b> of the major arteries. Two patients, suffering for 1. 5 years, paradoxically showed increased digital blood flow which is probably due to reactive hyperaemia or paralytic vasodilatation {{as a result of}} autosympathectomy...|$|R
40|$|This work is an {{investigation}} on the microvasculature of the cutaneous infiltrates of leprosy with the immunohistochemical staining of endothelial cells in cutaneous biopsies. Anti-Factor VIII-related antigen antibody (anti-FVIII-ra) and Ulex Europaeus- 1 lectin (UEA- 1) binding were utilized as endothelial cell markers. Thirty-nine patients grouped {{according to the}} Ridley-Jopling classification (14 borderline tuberculoid, 18 borderline lepromatous, 6 lepromatous, and 1 indeterminate leprosy) were selected for this study. Two microvascular architectural patterns could be clearly distinguished: lepromatous lesions presented a dense and tortuous mesh of microvessels among the Mycobacterium leprae-glutted macrophages; whereas the microvessels in the <b>tuberculoid</b> <b>lesions</b> were restricted to {{the periphery of the}} granulomas and were not seen among the central epithelioid cells. We were able to distinguish three basic morphological kinds of infiltrate distribution related to the microvessels: micronodules, cords and macronodules. Intensifications of the FVIII-ra immunoreactivity and UEA- 1 binding capacity were observed in the endothelial cells of microvessels involved by the inflammatory infiltrate. A distinct cytokine expression profile at the leprosy poles and the role of mast cells in angiogenesis were speculated as factors contributing to these distinct patterns. Growth of the lesion and systemic dissemination of M. leprae in the bipolar spectrum of leprosy may hypothetically be influenced by the vascular-infiltrate relationship. The detection of angiogenesis in the cutaneous lesions of leprosy may bring about alternate and/or additional strategies for leprosy treatment...|$|R
40|$|Iron is {{essential}} for all organisms and its availability can control the growth of microorganisms; therefore, we examined the role of iron metabolism in multibacillary (MB) leprosy, focusing on the involvement of hepcidin. Erythrograms, iron metabolism parameters, pro-inflammatory cytokines and urinary hepcidin levels were evaluated in patients with MB and matched control subjects. Hepcidin expression in MB lesions was evaluated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The expression of ferroportin and hepcidin was evaluated by immunofluorescence in paucibacillary and MB lesions. Analysis of hepcidin protein levels in urine and of hepcidin mRNA and protein levels in leprosy lesions and skin biopsies from healthy control subjects showed elevated hepcidin levels in MB patients. Decreases in haematologic parameters and total iron binding capacity were observed in patients with MB leprosy. Moreover, interleukin- 1 beta, ferritin, soluble transferrin receptor and soluble transferrin receptor/log ferritin index values were increased in leprosy patients. Hepcidin was elevated in lepromatous lesions, whereas ferroportin was more abundant in <b>tuberculoid</b> <b>lesions.</b> In addition, hepcidin and ferroportin were not colocalised in the biopsies from leprosy lesions. Anaemia was not commonly observed in patients with MB; however, the observed changes in haematologic parameters indicating altered iron metabolism appeared to result from a mixture of anaemia of inflammation and iron deficiency. Thus, iron sequestration inside host cells might {{play a role in}} leprosy by providing an optimal environment for the bacillus.

40|$|Analysis {{of tissue}} lesions {{of the major}} reactional states of leprosy was {{undertaken}} to study the immune mechanisms underlying regulation of cell-mediated immunity and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) in man. In situ hybridization hybridization of reversal reaction biopsy specimens for INF-gamma mRNA expression revealed a 10 -fold increase in specific mRNA-containing cells over that observed in unresponsive lepromatous patients. Expression of huHF serine esterase, a marker for T cytotoxic cells, were fourfold increased in reversal reaction and <b>tuberculoid</b> <b>lesions</b> above that detected in unresponsive lepromatous individuals. Immunohistology of reversal reactions confirmed a selective increase of Th and T cytotoxic cells in the cellular immune response. Of interest, the microanatomic location of these serine esterase mRNA-containing cells was identical to the distribution of CD 4 + cells. Analysis of erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) lesions revealed differences in the underlying immune processes in comparison with reversal reaction lesions. Although phenotypic Th cells predominated in ENL lesions, IFN-gamma and serine esterase gene expression were markedly reduced. We suggest that reversal reactions represent a hyperimmune DTH response characterized by a selective increase of CD 4 + IFN-gamma producing cells and T cytotoxic cells, which result in the clearing of bacilli and concomitant tissue damage. In contrast, ENL reactions {{may be viewed as}} a transient diminution of Ts cells and activity leading to a partial and transient augmentation in cell-mediated immunity, perhaps sufficient to result in antibody and immune complex formation, but insufficient to clear bacilli from lesions...|$|R
40|$|Using {{monoclonal}} antibodies and the immunoperoxidase technique, {{the numbers}} and distribution of T lymphocyte subsets in the tissues of reactional states of leprosy (six reversal reaction, nine erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) and two Lucio's reaction) were determined and compared with those found in stable, non-reactional patients (six tuberculoid, two borderline lepromatous and seven lepromatous). The pattern of segregation of the suppressor/cytotoxic phenotype at {{the periphery of the}} granuloma was found in both non-reactional <b>tuberculoid</b> <b>lesions</b> and reversal reactions, but was better developed in the former. In ENL and Lucio's reaction, as well as in non-reactional lepromatous tissue, the helper/inducer and suppressor/cytotoxic phenotypes were both admixed with the aggregated histiocytes. However, the helper/suppressor ratio in ENL (2. 1 +/- 0. 4) was significantly larger than that in non-reactional lepromatous tissue (0. 7 +/- 0. 4, P less than 0. 001). The immature thymocyte antigen OKT 6 was found on scattered large non-lymphoid cells, most commonly in tuberculoid and reversal reaction tissues, less commonly in ENL, but only irregularly in non-reactional lepromatous tissue. The peripheral pattern of the suppressor/cytotoxic phenotype may be an immunohistological reflection of a cell-mediated immune response common to both non-reactional tuberculoid and reversal reaction patients. The reversal of the helper/suppressor ratio in ENL as compared to non-reactional lepromatous disease suggests some role for cell-mediated immunity in the pathogenesis of ENL. The OKT 6 positive cell is of unknown origin and function...|$|R

40|$|Experiments in {{the late}} 19 th century sought to define the host {{specificity}} of the causative agents of tuberculosis in mammals. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the human tubercle bacillus, was independently shown by Smith, Koch, and von Behring to be avirulent in cattle. This finding was erroneously used by Koch to argue the converse, namely that Mycobacterium bovis, the agent of bovine tuberculosis, was avirulent for man, a view that was subsequently discredited. However, reports {{in the literature of}} M. tuberculosis isolation from cattle with <b>tuberculoid</b> <b>lesions</b> suggests that the virulence of M. tuberculosis for cattle needs to be readdressed. We used an experimental bovine infection model to test the virulence of well-characterized strains of M. tuberculosis and M. bovis in cattle, choosing the genome-sequenced strains M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv and M. bovis 2122 / 97. Cattle were infected with approximately 10 (6) CFU of M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv or M. bovis 2122 / 97, and sacrificed 17 weeks post-infection. IFN-gamma and tuberculin skin tests indicated that both M. bovis 2122 and M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv were equally infective and triggered strong cell-mediated immune responses, albeit with some indication of differential antigen-specific responses. Postmortem examination revealed that while M. bovis 2122 / 97 -infected animals all showed clear pathology indicative of bovine tuberculosis, the M. tuberculosis-infected animals showed no pathology. Culturing of infected tissues revealed that M. tuberculosis was able to persist in the majority of animals, albeit at relatively low bacillary loads. In revisiting the early work on host preference across the M. tuberculosis complex, we have shown M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv is avirulent for cattle, and propose that the immune status of the animal, or genotype of the infecting bacillus, may have significant bearing on the virulence of a strain for cattle. This work will serve as a baseline for future studies into the genetic basis of host preference, and in particular the molecular basis of virulence in M. bovis...|$|R
40|$|Cryostat {{sections}} of dermal lesions from 30 untreated leprosy patients were studied by indirect immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies defining T cell subsets and Ia like antigens. Most lymphocytes in leprosy lesions were positive for OKT 3 and Ia like antigens indicating thereby {{the presence of}} activated T cells. Maximal numbers of these cells were seen in localized paucibacillary <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy <b>lesions</b> in close association with epithelioid cells. A decline in their numbers was observed over the leprosy spectrum with a marked reduction in disseminated, multi-bacillary, lepromatous leprosy where only scattered OKT 3 + cells were visualized. OKT 4 and OKT 8 positive cells defining T cell subsets, were frequently found within the OKT 3 + lymphocytes throughout the leprosy spectrum. The ratio of OKT 4 +/OKT 8 + cells ranged from 1. 2 to 5. 0 in tuberculoid and from 0. 2 to 1. 0 in lepromatous lesions. Macrophages in the granulomas stained intensely with anti-Ia antisera.

However localized tuberculosis of the liver producing a macronodular tuberculoma or an abscess is rare. The authors present a case of pseudotumoral hepatic tuberculosis in a 34 -year old woman. This patient presented a 2 month history of fever weight loss of 4 Kg and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. She denied jaundice, choluria, or acholia. Laboratory investigation, including renal and liver function tests. revealed normal levels. Chest X-ray was normal.

40|$|We {{recently}} {{showed that}} Mycobacterium leprae (ML) {{is able to}} induce lipid droplet formation in infected macrophages. We herein confirm that cholesterol (Cho) {{is one of the}} host lipid molecules that accumulate in ML-infected macrophages and investigate the effects of ML on cellular Cho metabolism responsible for its accumulation. The expression levels of LDL receptors (LDL-R, CD 36, SRA- 1, SR-B 1, and LRP- 1) and enzymes involved in Cho biosynthesis were investigated by qRT-PCR and/or Western blot and shown to be higher in lepromatous leprosy (LL) tissues when compared to borderline <b>tuberculoid</b> (BT) <b>lesions.</b> Moreover, higher levels of the active form of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcriptional factors, key regulators of the biosynthesis and uptake of cellular Cho, were found in LL skin biopsies. Functional in vitro assays confirmed the higher capacity of ML-infected macrophages to synthesize Cho and sequester exogenous LDLCho. Notably, Cho colocalized to ML-containing phagosomes, and Cho metabolism impairment, through either de novo synthesis inhibition by statins or depletion of exogenous Cho, decreased intracellular bacterial survival. These findings highlight the importance of metabolic integration between the host and bacteria to leprosy pathophysiology, opening new avenues for novel therapeutic strategies to leprosy...|$|R
40|$|The granulomatous skin lesions {{of human}} leprosy {{are known to}} be due to the {{cutaneous}} immune reaction to various mycobacterial antigens. In the present study, by immunohistochemical analysis using a previously characterized monoclonal antibody (MoAb) 3 A 8 we have demonstrated a selective expression of the 3 A 8 epitope of mycobacterial 30 -kDa proteins, the major secreted proteins of mycobacteria, in various forms of leprosy lesions across the clinical spectrum. The localization of MoAb 3 A 8 staining is confined to the areas of cellular infiltrates of the <b>lesions.</b> In <b>tuberculoid</b> <b>lesions</b> the intense 3 A 8 staining was seen mostly in association with the membrane of the dermal cellular infiltrates whereas in highly bacilliferous lepromatous lesions the staining seems to be diffused with granular appearance but not in the form of bacteria. In patients with reversal reaction the staining was specifically extended to cells infiltrating the epidermis. MoAb 3 A 8 did not show any reactivity with inflammatory skin lesions of patients other than those with leprosy. Since the 3 A 8 epitope of 30 -kDa proteins {{has been shown to be}} present in all cellular compartments of the mycobacteria and in the actively secreted BCG 85 antigen complex, MoAb 3 A 8 reactive protein(s) in leprosy lesions may be derived either from degraded somatic mycobacterial products or from antigens actively secreted by live bacilli. The latter could be true in the cases of untreated lepromatous lesions with high bacterial load since live M. leprae has also been considered to secrete corresponding 30 -kDa proteins similar to other closely related mycobacteria. By double immunoenzyme staining we clearly demonstrate the expression of 3 A 8 epitope on CD 68 + macrophages in the granulomas of tuberculoid leprosy, whereas in highly bacilliferous lepromatous lesions most of the double staining was seen in a diffuse pattern within the interstitial space of the cellular infiltrate as well as in the cytoplasm of CD 68 + macrophages. In lesions from reversal reaction the 3 A 8 epitope is more strongly expressed on CDla+ dendritic Langerhans cells (LC) both in the epidermis and in the dermis as compared with other types of leprosy. This provides evidence for the involvement of LC in handling of mycobacterial antigenic epitopes in leprosy lesions. Further, immunoenzyme double staining revealed that the expression of this mycobacterial 3 A 8 epitope on antigen presenting cells such as CD 68 + macrophages and CDla+ LC is present in juxtaposition with CD 3 + T cells including the alpha beta and gamma delta receptor-bearing T cells in the granuloma.

There was a good correlation with the histological spectrum, LTT responses generally being higher in the borderline tuberculoid leprosy patients and lower in the borderline lepromatous. However, considerable variation was noted in each group of the borderline leprosy spectrum, and {{it was found that}} this was {{due in part to the}} degree of inflammation in the skin. Thus those with 'inflamed" skin lesions had higher responses than those with 'silent" lesions, and even those with borderline lepromatous leprosy with inflamed lesions had higher responses than those with borderline <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy whose <b>lesions</b> were silent. Those who had reversal reactions, where inflammation is very marked, had very high LTT responses which fell with treatment of the reaction with steroids.

40|$|The granulomatous skin lesions in leprosy {{are thought}} to be {{initiated}} by the immune response to certain antigens of the causative agent, Mycobacterium leprae. The antigen 85 complex {{is one of the major}} targets in the immune response to M. leprae infection. In the present study, a panel of previously characterized monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (3 A 8, Rb 2, A 4 g 4, A 2 h 11, Pe 12, and A 3 c 12) reacting with different epitopes of the 85 complex proteins of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M. leprae was employed in a comparative immunohistological analysis to demonstrate the in situ expression of 85 complex antigenic epitopes in leprosy lesions across the clinical spectrum and in M. leprae-infected armadillo liver tissues. These MAbs showed a heterogeneous staining pattern in a given leprosy lesion. In highly bacilliferous borderline and lepromatous leprosy lesions, MAbs Rb 2, A 4 g 4, A 2 h 11, and Pe 12 stained clear rod-shaped M. leprae bacilli within macrophages, and the degree of staining correlated with the bacillary index of the lesion. On the other hand, MAbs 3 A 8 and A 3 c 12 staining was mostly seen as a diffuse staining pattern within interstitial spaces and on the membranes of the infiltrated cells but not the bacilli. In paucibacillary borderline and <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy <b>lesions,</b> only 3 A 8, Rb 2, and A 3 c 12 showed distinct staining in association with infiltrates in the granuloma. None of these MAbs showed any detectable reaction with control nonleprosy skin lesions, while MAb A 3 c 12 positively stained the granulomas of both leprosy and control specimens. In situ reactivity of these MAbs with M. leprae-infected armadillo liver tissues also showed a heterogeneous staining pattern. Interestingly, a clear difference in expression of these epitopes was observed between armadillo tissues and human leprosy lesions. By immunogold ultracytochemistry, we further showed the differential localization of these MAb-reactive epitopes on the cell surface, in the cytosol, and at the vicinity of M. leprae within Kupffer cells of armadillo liver tissues. Our results indicate that these antigenic epitopes of the antigen 85 complex are differentially expressed in leprosy lesions and infected armadillo tissues and that they could be target determinants in the immunopathological responses during M. leprae infectio...|$|R
40|$|Gelatinases A and B (matrix {{metalloproteinase}} 2 [MMP- 2] and MMP- 9, respectively) can induce {{basal membrane}} breakdown and leukocyte migration, but {{their role in}} leprosy skin inflammation remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed clinical specimens from leprosy patients taken from stable, untreated skin lesions and during reactional episodes (reversal reaction [RR] and erythema nodosum leprosum [ENL]). The participation of MMPs in disease was suggested by (i) increased MMP mRNA expression levels in skin biopsy specimens correlating with the expression of gamma interferon (IFN-γ) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), (ii) the detection of the MMP protein and enzymatic activity within the inflammatory infiltrate, (iii) increased MMP levels in patient sera, and (iv) the in vitro induction of MMP- 9 by Mycobacterium leprae and/or TNF-α. It was observed that IFN-γ, TNF-α, MMP- 2, and MMP- 9 mRNA levels were higher in <b>tuberculoid</b> than lepromatous <b>lesions.</b> In contrast, interleukin- 10 and tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP- 1) message were not differentially modulated. These data correlated with the detection of the MMP protein evidenced by immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. When RR and ENL lesions were analyzed, an increase in TNF-α, MMP- 2, and MMP- 9, but not TIMP- 1, mRNA levels was observed together with stronger MMP activity (zymography/in situ zymography). Moreover, following in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood cells, M. leprae induced the expression of MMP- 9 (mRNA and protein) in cultured cells. Overall, the present data demonstrate an enhanced MMP/TIMP- 1 ratio in the inflammatory states of leprosy and point to potential mechanisms for tissue damage.

40|$|Leprosy, {{a chronic}} {{infectious}} disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae, {{is a powerful}} model to study the human immune response because the clinical manifestations of disease present as a spectrum correlating {{with the level of}} immune response to the pathogen. Research investigating mechanisms of host defense and M. leprae-induced suppression of antimicrobial pathways continues to provide insight into which immune pathways are essential for containment of mycobacterial infections. Here, we utilized three bioinformatics approaches to identify mechanisms of modulation of host immune responses by mycobacterium and gain a clearer understanding of disease pathogenesis and potential targets of mitigation, including: i) integration of microRNA and mRNA gene expression profiling of disseminated lepromatous leprosy (L-lep) versus self-containing <b>tuberculoid</b> leprosy (T-lep) <b>lesions</b> to identify microRNAs capable of downregulating antimicrobial peptide production, ii) overlap of highly expressed receptors on IL- 15 -derived M 1 and IL- 10 -derived M 2 macrophages (MΦ) with known drivers of MΦ polarization to identify ligands capable of reeducating MΦ phenotype and function, and iii) comparison of transcriptome profiles of M. leprae-infected monocyte-derived MΦ and leprosy skin lesions to identify genes contributing to suppression of host immune responses and bacterial survival. Here, we provide evidence illustrating the ability of M. leprae to induce specific microRNAs and host genes to alter host immune responses. M. leprae, but not M. tuberculosis, can induce upregulation of microRNA- 21, which then targets and downregulates antimicrobial peptide production and mycobacterial killing. Differential cytokine expression coupled with the presence of mycobacterial ligands can alter MΦ polarization correlating to a change in phagocytic function and expression of antimicrobial genes. Lastly, M. leprae can induce expression of the autophagy regulator NUPR 1, which is more highly expressed in L-lep lesions. As more insight is gathered on (i) the functional consequences of host genes regulated during mycobacterial infections on the immune response and ii) how these genes are regulated by the pathogens, an opportunity for directed therapeutic intervention may present itself...|$|R
40|$|A hansenÃase {{continua}} sendo um problema de saÃde mundial, sendo o Brasil o segundo paÃs em maior em nÃmero de casos novos. No CearÃ a doenÃa Ã considerada endÃmica e em 2009 foram diagnosticados 1. 952 casos novos, alcanÃando um coeficiente de detecÃÃo geral de 22, 8 / 100. 00 habitantes. A doenÃa Ã causada pelo M. leprae, manifesta-se atravÃs de sinais e sintomas dermatoneurolÃgicos e Ã transmitida de pessoa a pessoa atravÃs do convÃvio de indivÃduos suscetÃveis com doentes bacilÃferos sem tratamento. A interaÃÃo do M. leprae com os subtipos de cÃlulas T produz citocinas do tipo Th 1 e Th 2, responsÃveis pelas diferentes formas clÃnicas da doenÃa. PadrÃes de citocinas Th 1 (IL- 2, IFN-&# 947; e TNF-&# 945;) foram encontrados em lesÃes de pele das formas tuberculÃides e padrÃes de citocinas Th 2 (IL- 4, IL- 5 e IL- 10) foram encontrados em lesÃes das formas virchovianas. A hansenÃase Ã influenciada por vÃrios fatores, sendo os genÃticos os mais estudados no momento. Os genes das citocinas aparecem como fortes candidatos capazes de influenciar a interaÃÃo patÃgeno- hospedeiro e favorecer ou nÃo o desenvolvimento da doenÃa. A IL- 10 Ã uma citocina anti-inflamatÃria e imunomoduladora que possui regiÃes promotoras bastantes polimÃrficas, contendo regiÃes de microssatÃlites e SNPs que formam vÃrios haplÃtipos que estÃo associados a diferentes nÃveis de produÃÃo de citocina in vitro. VÃrios estudos tentam reportar associaÃÃes entre os polimorfismos de IL- 10 e o risco ou proteÃÃo para diversas doenÃas. Contudo, os dados relatados tem sido contraditÃrios e a maioria das associaÃÃes entre os polimorfismos e a produÃÃo dessa citocina sÃo baseados em estudos in vitro. Dessa forma o presente estudo teve o objetivo de definir como os polimorfismos da regiÃo promotora da citocina afetam a produÃÃo in vivo frente Ã infecÃÃo pelo M. leprae. Foram quantificadas as concentraÃÃes sÃricas de IL- 10 de 181 indivÃduos, sendo 77 casos Ãndices de hansenÃase, 74 indivÃduos contactantes e 30 controles saudÃveis. Sendo que destes, 31 possuÃam anÃlise genotÃpica de IL- 10 no grupo caso, 33 no grupo contactante e 29 no grupo controle. Os pacientes com anÃlise genotÃpica foram estratificados em baixo, mÃdio e alto produtor da citocina. As diferenÃas nos nÃveis da citocina foram comparadas entre os grupos dentro do espectro da hansenÃase (paucibacilar e multibacilar), dos controles externos, dos controles internos, dos genÃtipos e alelos encontrados nos grupos. Foram realizados testes de Kruskall-Wallis e Mann-Whitney para anÃlise das medianas de IL- 10 em pg/mL. NÃo foi encontrada diferenÃa significante entre os grupos caso, contactante e controle (p= 0, 7450), entre os indivÃduos pauci e multibacilar (p= 0, 7898), entre os fenÃtipos de nÃvel de produÃÃo de citocina (baixo, mÃdio e alto) (p= 0, 4355). Foi encontrada diferenÃa significante na produÃÃo de IL- 10 entre os alelos - 1082 A,- 819 C e - 592 C do grupo caso em relaÃÃo aos controles (p 0, 05). Em conclusÃo, os genÃtipos de IL- 10, - 1082 G>A, - 819 C>T e - 592 G>C nÃo influenciaram a produÃÃo e/ou o desfecho da infecÃÃo pelo M. leprae. Por outro lado, os alelos - 1082 A,- 819 C e - 592 C determinaram menor produÃÃo de IL- 10 em indivÃduos com hansenÃase. Leprosy {{is a world}} {{problem of}} health and Brazil has the second higher rates of new cases in the world. It is considered an endemic disease at CearÃ {{and a total of}} 1, 952 new cases were detected, reaching a detection rate of 22. 8 / 100, 000 inhabitants. The interaction between the M. leprae and different T cells stimulates the production of a Th 1 or a Th 2 pattern of cytokines, which are responsible for the different clinical forms of leprosy. Th 1 cytokines (IL- 2, IFN-&# 947; and TNF-&# 945;) were found in <b>tuberculoid</b> skin <b>lesions</b> while Th 2 cytokines (IL- 4, IL- 5 and IL- 10) were found in lepromatoid lesions. Leprosy is influenced by many distinct factors, among them, genetic factors are the most studied at this moment. Cytokine genes seem to influence the interaction between the pathogen and the host and contribute to the development or not of the disease. The IL- 10 is an antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory cytokine which has too much polymorphic promoter regions with microsatellites and SNPs. Different haplotypes are associated to distinct levels of cytokine production in vitro. Many studies reported associations between IL- 10 polymorphisms and the risk or the protection against many diseases. However, the data reported have been contradictory and most of the associations between these polymorphisms and the production of IL- 10 are showed in in vitro studies. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate how the promoter region polymorphisms of IL- 10 influence the cytokine levels production in vivo, during the M. leprae infection. Serum levels of IL- 10 were analyzed by ELISA in 181 individuals, 77 of them were leprosy cases, 74 household contacts and 30 healthy controls. Among them, 31 had IL- 10 polymorphism typed in the case group, 33 in household contact group and 29 in healthy controls. Cases with polymorphism typed were stratified in low, medium and high levels of cytokine production. Differences in the IL- 10 production were compared among leprosy cases (pauci and multibacillary), household contacts, healthy controls, genotypes and alleles distribution found in the groups. Kruskall-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests were used to analyze mean values of IL- 10 levels. No differences were observed between cases, contacts and controls (p= 0. 7450), pauci and multibacillary (p= 0. 7898), phenotypes of IL- 10 production (low, medium or high) (p= 0. 4355). A significant difference in the IL- 10 levels between cases and controls was found associated to the alleles - 1082 A,- 819 C and - 592 C (p 0. 05). In conclusion, the - 1082 G>A, - 819 C>T and - 592 G>C IL- 10 genotypes did not influence the IL- 10 production or the M. leprae infection outcome. On the other hand, - 1082 A,- 819 C e - 592 C alleles determined a lower production of IL- 10 in cases of leprosy. Keywords: Leprosy; Polymorphisms; IL- 10; Serum levels; Contact...|$|R
