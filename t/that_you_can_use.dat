500|$|George Steiner, academic, philosopher, {{writer and}} {{literary}} critic for The New Yorker and The New York Times, {{had written about}} the Holocaust {{in some of his}} previous books, including Anno Domini (1964), Language and Silence (1967) and In Bluebeard's Castle (1971). Many of the ideas Steiner expresses in The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H. were drawn from these earlier works. Steiner told New York Times editor D. J. R. Bruckner that this book arose out of his lifelong work on language. [...] "Central to everything I am and believe and have written is my astonishment... <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> human speech both to bless, to love, to build, to forgive and also to torture, to hate, to destroy and to annihilate." ...|$|E

2500|$|Purnell {{described}} him as [...] "a manic self-promoter" [...] who filled his life with [...] "fun and jokes". Described by Crines as [...] "a joker", Johnson has stated that [...] "humour is a utensil <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> to sugar the pill and to get important points across." [...] Purnell noted that colleagues regularly expressed the view that Johnson used people to advance his own interests, with Gimson noting that Johnson was [...] "one of the great flatterers of our times". Purnell noted that he deflected serious questions using [...] "a little humour {{and a good deal}} of bravado". According to Gimson, Johnson was [...] "a humane man" [...] who [...] "could also be staggeringly inconsiderate of others" [...] when focusing upon his own interests. Gimson also noted that Johnson has [...] "an excessive desire to be liked".|$|E

Besides, you want quiet and rest. I have been round to the landlord, to tell him that I am going away, and to pay him a month's rent, instead of notice. I should think the best way would be for you to take a large room for yourself, or two rooms not so large--one of them for you to live in, and the other to store everything there is here. I know that you will look after them, and keep them well. Of course, you will pick out all the things <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> in your room. It will be very lonely for you, living all by yourself, but you know numbers of people here; and you might engage a girl to stay with you, for some small wages and her food. Now, you must think over what your food and hers will cost, and the rent. Of course, I want you to live comfortably; you have always been a friend rather than a servant, and my mother had the greatest trust in you." ...|$|E
6000|$|HOTCHKISS [impatiently] My dear Anthony: I {{find you}} merely ridiculous as a preacher, because you keep {{referring}} me to places and documents and alleged occurrences in which, {{as a matter}} of fact, I dont believe. I dont believe in anything but my own will and my own pride and honor. Your fishes and your catechisms {{and all the rest of}} it make a charming poem which you call your faith. It fits you to perfection; but it doesnt fit me. I happen, like Napoleon, to prefer Mohammedanism. [Mrs George, associating Mohammedanism with polygamy, looks at him with quick suspicion]. I believe the whole British Empire will adopt a reformed Mohammedanism before the end of the century. The character of Mahomet is congenial to me. I admire him, and share his views of life to a considerable extent. That beats you, you see, Soames. Religion is a great force--the only real motive force in the world; but what you fellows dont understand is that you must get at a man through his own religion and not through yours. Instead of facing that fact, you persist in trying to convert all men to your own little sect, so <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> it against them afterwards. You are all missionaries and proselytizers trying to uproot the native religion from your neighbor's flowerbeds and plant your own in its place. You would rather let a child perish in ignorance than have it taught by a rival sectary. You can talk to me of the quintessential equality of coal merchants and British officers; and yet you cant see the quintessential equality of all the religions. Who are you, anyhow, that you should know better than Mahomet or Confucius or any of the other Johnnies who have been on this job since the world existed? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "MORAL STATISTICIAN."--I don't {{want any}} of your statistics; I took your whole batch and lit my pipe with it. I hate your kind of people. You are always {{ciphering}} out how much a man's health is injured, and how much his intellect is impaired, and how many pitiful dollars and cents he wastes {{in the course of}} ninety-two years' indulgence in the fatal practice of smoking; and in the equally fatal practice of drinking coffee; and in playing billiards occasionally; and in taking a glass of wine at dinner, etc., etc., etc. And you are always figuring out how many women have been burned to death because of the dangerous fashion of wearing expansive hoops, etc., etc., etc. You never see more than one side of the question. You are blind to the fact that most old men in America smoke and drink coffee, although, according to your theory, they ought to have died young; and that hearty old Englishmen drink wine and survive it, and portly old Dutchmen both drink and smoke freely, and yet grow older and fatter all the time. And you never try to find out how much solid comfort, relaxation, and enjoyment a man derives from smoking {{in the course of a}} lifetime (which is worth ten times the money he would save by letting it alone), nor the appalling aggregate of happiness lost in a lifetime by your kind of people from not smoking. Of course you can save money by denying yourself all the little vicious enjoyments for fifty years; but then what can you do with it? What use can you put it to? Money can't save your infinitesimal soul. All the use that money can be put to is to purchase comfort and enjoyment in this life; therefore, as you are an enemy to comfort and enjoyment, where is the use of accumulating cash? It won't do for you to say <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> <b>use</b> it to better purpose in furnishing a good table, and in charities, and in supporting tract societies, because you know yourself that you people who have no petty vices are never known to give away a cent, and that you stint yourselves so in the matter of food that you are always feeble and hungry. And you never dare to laugh in the daytime for fear some poor wretch, seeing you in a good humor, will try to borrow a dollar of you; and in church you are always down on your knees, with your eyes buried in the cushion, when the contribution-box comes around; and you never give the revenue officers a full statement of your income. Now you know these things yourself, don't you? Very well, then what is the use of your stringing out your miserable lives to a lean and withered old age? What is the use of your saving money that is so utterly worthless to you? In a word, why don't you go off somewhere and die, and not be always trying to seduce people into becoming as [...] "ornery" [...] and unlovable as you are yourselves, by your villainous [...] "moral statistics"? Now I don't approve of dissipation, and I don't indulge in it, either; but I haven't a particle of confidence in a man who has no redeeming petty vices, and so I don't want to hear from you any more. I think you are the very same man who read me a long lecture last week about the degrading vice of smoking cigars, and then came back, in my absence, with your reprehensible fireproof gloves on, and carried off my beautiful parlor stove.|$|E
