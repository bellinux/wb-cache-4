40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{friction}} welding of the <b>tube</b> <b>yoke</b> and the tube of the drive shaft used in light commercial vehicles. <b>Tube</b> <b>yoke</b> made from hot forged microalloyed steel and the tube made from cold drawn steel, with a ratio (thickness/outside diameter ratio) of less than 0. 1, were successfully welded by friction welding method. Hardness distributions {{on both sides of}} the welded joint across the welding interface were determined and the microstructure of the joint was investigated. Furthermore, joint strength was tested under tensile, static torsional, and torsional fatigue loadings. The tested data were analyzed by Weibull distribution. The maximum hardness value along the welded joint was detected as 553 [*]Hv 1. The lowest detected tensile strength of the joint was 13 % less than the base materials’ tensile strength. The torsional load carrying capacity of the friction welded thin walled tubular joint without any damage was obtained as 4. 252, 5 [*]Nm in 95 % confidence interval. After conducting fully reversed torsional fatigue tests, the fatigue life of friction welded tubular joints was detected as 220. 066, 3 cycles...|$|E

40|$|Chemical {{analysis}} showed that the debris collected from the <b>yoke</b> <b>tube</b> consisted of oxides of the base material elements. In addition, chlorine as high as 0. 6 wt% was found present. The morphology of the debris {{was found to be}} typical of scales that form {{on the surface of the}} steel components during heat treatment. It appears that these scales were present on the inner surface of the <b>yoke</b> <b>tube</b> and would have peeled off due to vibration during service. However, the presence of chlorine cannot be ignored since it can give rise to different forms of corrosion in a long run. It is, therefore, necessary to identify the source of chlorine and accordingly, corrective measures need to be incorporated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] - Walking Line Assembly (WLA) is {{performed}} by positioning workers along assembly line at every process {{stations in the}} production line as and when required. This has benefitted the assembly and fabrication industry {{without the need for}} a dedicated layout, thereby leading to reduction in the fixed costs. This paper describes the application of WLA in prototype fabrication of yoke sub-assembly and details its effectiveness. The WLA procedure is described in two parts: Part I presents the technical aspects and challenges involved in development and fabrication of engine mount <b>yoke</b> <b>tube</b> assembly for a civil aircraft. This highlights the importance and significance of the parts, brackets, dimensional robustness, procedures, assembly, jigs and fixtures associated and the necessity of categorizing it as Class- 1. Activities representing reverse engineering process and fabrication of <b>yoke</b> <b>tube</b> are detailed comprehensively. Part II presents the WLA model adopted for this assembly. Comparison with conventional methods and layouts of fixed and walking line assembly are done. Further, WLA is modified with a common stage set on every process where the expected capability of the task in shop floor is brought out in consensus with the operational demand and standards. This is achieved with very little disturbance to the existing aircraft fixed line fabrication set up. This model has given encouraging results by expediting the processes and provides an ideal option for building of prototypes in development stage of an aircraft project.

40|$|Atom skimmers are {{devices that}} act as {{low-pass}} velocity filters for atoms in thermal atomic beams. An atom skimmer operating {{in conjunction with a}} suitable thermal atomic-beam source (e. g., an oven in which cesium is heated) can serve as a source of slow atoms for a magneto-optical trap or other apparatus in an atomic-physics experiment. Phenomena that are studied in such apparatuses include Bose-Einstein condensation of atomic gases, spectra of trapped atoms, and collisions of slowly moving atoms. An atom skimmer includes a curved, low-thermal-conduction tube that leads from the outlet of a thermal atomic-beam source to the inlet of a magneto-optical trap or other device in which the selected low-velocity atoms are to be used. Permanent rare-earth magnets are placed around the <b>tube</b> in a <b>yoke</b> of high-magnetic-permeability material to establish a quadrupole or octupole magnetic field leading from the source to the trap. The atoms are attracted to the locus of minimum magnetic-field intensity {{in the middle of the}} tube, and the gradient of the magnetic field provides centripetal force that guides the atoms around the curve along the axis of the tube. The threshold velocity for guiding is dictated by the gradient of the magnetic field and the radius of curvature of the tube. Atoms moving at lesser velocities are successfully guided; faster atoms strike the tube wall and are lost from the beam...|$|R
