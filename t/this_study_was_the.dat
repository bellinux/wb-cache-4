5|$|After {{the fall}} of France, the U.S. Army studied the reasons behind the {{effectiveness}} of the German campaign against the French and British forces. One aspect that was highlighted by <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> use of self propelled artillery; however, by 1941, there was little available in the U.S. Army's arsenal {{that could be used in}} such a role. The Army had a number of M1897A5 guns, sufficient for the mass-production for such a weapon, and the M3 half-track was coming into production. After some debate, the Army decided to place M1897A5 guns on the M3 half-track chassis, which was designated the T12 GMC. The M1897A5 gun was originally adapted for the M3 chassis by placing it in a welded box riveted to the chassis behind the driver's compartment. It was accepted by the Army on 31 October 1941.|$|E
25|$|Micropsia that is {{induced by}} macular {{degeneration}} {{can be treated}} in several ways. A study called AREDS (age-related eye disease study) determined that taking dietary supplements containing high-dose antioxidants and zinc produced significant benefits with regard to disease progression. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first ever to prove that dietary supplements can alter the natural progression and complications of a disease state. Laser treatments also look promising but are still in clinical stages.|$|E
25|$|A Northwestern University study {{indicates}} that inadequate sleep has {{a negative impact on}} a child's performance in school, their emotional and social welfare, and increases their risk of being overweight. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first nationally represented, longitudinal investigation of the correlation between sleep, Body Mass Index (BMI) and overweight status in {{children between the ages of}} 3 and 18. The study found that an extra hour of sleep lowered the children's risk of being overweight from 36% to 30%, while it lessened older children's risk from 34% to 30%.|$|E
30|$|The main {{weakness}} of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{small number of}} patients included (12 patients, 7 available for long-term follow-up), due to the rarity of this injury. The main strength of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> long-term follow-up (average of 14.4  years, range 11.2 – 22  years).|$|R

30|$|<b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> first {{meta-analysis}} {{of the association}} between IHD and colorectal neoplasm. <b>The</b> strength of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> rigorous literature search, {{although there is a}} lack of data. When possible, potential modifiers <b>were</b> detected within <b>the</b> articles, and sensitivity analyses were performed to confirm the robustness of the results. However, due to the paucity of enrolled <b>studies,</b> subgroup analysis <b>was</b> not made.|$|R
25|$|If a {{participant}} indicated a {{tip of the}} tongue state, {{they were asked to}} provide any information about the target word they could recall. Brown and McNeill found that participants could identify the first letter of the target word, the number of syllables of the target word, words of similar sound, words of similar meaning, syllabic pattern, and the serial position of some letters in the target word better than would be expected by chance. Their findings demonstrated the legitimacy of the feeling of knowing experienced in a tip of the tongue state. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> foundation for subsequent research about tip of the tongue phenomenon.|$|E
25|$|Kenneth Carpenter and Matt Smith {{published}} {{a detailed description}} of the osteology and biomechanics of T. rex forelimbs. They concluded that T. rex arms were actually rather strong, but with a much smaller range of motion than other carnivorous dinosaurs like Allosaurus and Deinonychus. They concluded that while the arms of Tyrannosaurus would have been useless for actually killing prey, they may have been used to hold on to prey while the tyrannosaur killed it with bites. They dismissed notions that the forelimbs were useless or that Tyrannosaurus rex was an obligate scavenger. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> complete description of Tyrannosaurus forelimbs in the scientific literature.|$|E
25|$|In October 1989, Rockwell International (Space Systems Division) began {{a year-long}} {{contracted}} effort managed by Langley Research Center {{to perform an}} in-depth study of PLS design and operations with the HL-20 concept as a baseline for the study. Using a concurrent engineering approach, Rockwell factored supportable, efficient design and operations measures into defining a detailed, cost-effective design along with a manufacturing plan and operations assessment. A key finding of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> realization that while design and technological factors could reduce costs of a new manned space transportation system, further significant savings would be possible only if a new operations philosophy were adopted which treated PLS {{in a manner similar}} to an operational airliner rather than a research and development space vehicle.|$|E

25|$|After the {{demonstration}} of successful fluorescent protein fragment reconstitution in mammalian cells, Hu et al. described the use of fragmented yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) {{in the investigation of}} bZIP and Rel family transcription factor interactions. This was the first report bZIP protein interaction regulation by regions outside of the bZIP domain, regulation of subnuclear localization of the bZIP domains Fos and Jun by their different interacting partners, and modulation of transcriptional activation of bZIP and Rel proteins through mutual interactions. In addition, <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first report of an in vivo technique, now known as the bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay, to provide insight into the structural basis of protein complex formation through detection of fluorescence caused by the assembly of fluorescent reporter protein fragments tethered to interacting proteins.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, {{researchers}} from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health identified the blueprint of genes and enzymes in the body that enable sulforaphane, a compound found in broccoli and other vegetables, to prevent cancer and remove toxins from cells. The discovery was made using a “gene chip,” which allows researchers to monitor the complex interactions of thousands of proteins on a whole genome rather than one at time. <b>This</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> first gene profiling analysis of a cancer-preventing agent using this approach. University of Minnesota researcher Sabrina Peterson, PhD, RD, coauthored a study with Johanna Lampe of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, in October 2002 that investigated the chemoprotective effect of cruciferous vegetables (e.g., broccoli, Brussels sprouts). Study results published in The Journal of Nutrition outline the metabolism and mechanisms of action of cruciferous vegetable constituents, discusses human studies testing effects of cruciferous vegetables on biotransformation systems and summarizes the epidemiologic and experimental evidence for an effect of genetic polymorphisms (genetic variations) in these enzymes on response to cruciferous vegetable intake.|$|E

6000|$|The patients, or {{whatever}} other visitors were ever admitted into the Doctor's study, carried abroad strange {{accounts of the}} squalor of dust and cobwebs in which the learned and scientific person lived; and the dust, they averred, {{was all the more}} disagreeable, because it could not well be other than dead men's almost intangible atoms, resurrected from the adjoining graveyard. As for the cobwebs, they were no signs of housewifely neglect on the part of crusty Hannah, the handmaiden; but the Doctor's scientific material, carefully encouraged and preserved, each filmy thread more valuable to him than so much golden wire. Of all barbarous haunts in Christendom or elsewhere, <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> one most overrun with spiders. They dangled from the ceiling, crept upon the tables, lurked in the corners, and wove the intricacy of their webs wherever they could hitch the end from point to point across the window-panes, and even across {{the upper part of the}} doorway, and in the chimney-place. It seemed impossible to move without breaking some of these mystic threads. Spiders crept familiarly towards you and walked leisurely across your hands: these were their precincts, and you only an intruder. If you had none about your person, yet you had an odious sense of one crawling up your spine, or spinning cobwebs in your brain,--so pervaded was the atmosphere of the place with spider-life. What they fed upon (for all the flies for miles about would not have sufficed them) was a secret known only to the Doctor. Whence they came was another riddle; though, from certain inquiries and transactions of Doctor Grimshawe's with some of the shipmasters of the port, who followed the East and West Indian, the African and the South American trade, it was supposed that this odd philosopher was in the habit of importing choice monstrosities in the spider kind from all those tropic regions.
