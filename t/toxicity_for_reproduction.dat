30|$|The {{lowest value}} of 60  ng/L was {{calculated}} for PFNA. This value, though, contains a special safety factor of 10 {{because of the potential}} for <b>toxicity</b> <b>for</b> <b>reproduction</b> (classification Repr. 1 B) and presumably carcinogenicity (classification Carc. 2). The highest value calculated so far was 10  µg/L for PFBA. It is only slightly higher than the value hitherto specified by the German Environment Agency (7  µg/L; [8]). Moreover, the values for the individual compounds seem to relate reasonably to one another.|$|E
30|$|Studies of the <b>toxicity</b> <b>for</b> <b>reproduction</b> {{and child}} {{development}} have shown, however, that neonatal mortality of mice after exposure in utero against PFOA and PFNA depended on PPARα, but exposure against PFOS was PPARα independent. For this endpoint, a mechanism unrelated to PPARα {{seems to be}} at least participating. Moreover, activation of nuclear receptors other than PPARα through PFC has been demonstrated, such as the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and the pregnane-X-receptor (PXR). Liver toxicity and the strength of induction of peroxisome proliferation in rats (where rodents react more sensitively to peroxisome proliferators than humans) furthermore depend on the carbon chain length. For a similar increase of the activity of hepatic acyl-CoA-oxidase as measure of proliferation 50 times higher doses of PFBS were necessary than of PFOA or PFHxS.|$|E
30|$|According to the CLP regulation, {{manufacturers}} and importers have {{to notify the}} classification and labeling to the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) regardless of the production volumes. The CLP regulation provides for two approaches: on one hand, the harmonized classification which applies predominantly on effects of high concern, like carcinogenicity, germ cell mutagenicity, <b>toxicity</b> <b>for</b> <b>reproduction</b> {{as well as on}} substances which are persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic, and which leads to partial classifications. The harmonized classifications are the minimum mandatory classifications listed in Annex VI of the CLP regulation. On the other hand, self-classification for all other hazardous properties is effectuated by the manufacturer, importer, or downstream user. Notifiers {{need to make sure that}} their self-classifications are correct: They need to consider all accessible existing information, evaluate their reliability, relevance, and adequacy in an expert judgment with a weight of evidence approach and use the evaluated data for self-classification [9 - 11].|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} how soil properties influence nanoparticle (NP) fate, bioavailability and toxicity, this study compared the toxicity of nano zinc oxide (ZnO NPs), non-nano ZnO and ionic ZnCl 2 to the earthworm Eisenia fetida {{in a natural}} soil at three pH levels. NP characterisation indicated that reaction with the soil media greatly controls ZnO properties. Three main conclusions were drawn. First that Zn <b>toxicity,</b> especially <b>for</b> <b>reproduction,</b> was influenced by pH for all Zn forms. This {{can be linked to}} the influence of pH on Zn dissolution. Secondly, that ZnO fate, toxicity and bioaccumulation were similar (including relationships with pH) for both ZnO forms, indicating the absence of NP-specific effects. Finally, earthworm Zn concentrations were higher in worms exposed to ZnO compared to ZnCl 2, despite the greater toxicity of the ionic form. This observation suggests the importance of considering the relationship between uptake and toxicity in nanotoxicology studies...|$|R
40|$|With a wider remit, the United Nations {{formulated}} {{a classification}} and labelling system for universal application, the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS). The GHS {{was first published in}} 2003 (UN, 2003) and subsequently updated on a biannual basis, with the most recent revision published in 2009 (UN, 2009 a). It was enacted into the European legislative framework as Regulation 1272 / 2008 (EC, 2008). The supplementary guidance text of the GHS explains the application of the classification criteria (Box 1). It uses more advisory, less obligatory, language than the equivalent EU text (e. g. “should” vs. “shall”), but overall {{the differences between the two}} are minor and are noted in the footnotes to Box 1. This review offers guidance for the classification of substances <b>for</b> <b>toxicity</b> to <b>reproduction</b> according to the GHS; as a whole it applies equally to both regulatory frameworksJRC.

40|$|Based on {{a review}} of the {{pertinent}} literature and our own unpub-lished data, it is recommended that culling of rodent litters in the early postnatal period should be a standard practice in delivery-type reproduction studies. This, in turn, will reduce the litter size-induced variability in the growth and development of pups during the postnatal period and thus increase the sensitivity of statistical analyses to detect treatment-related effects. This will also ensure that any adverse effects on pup growth (body weight gain) and development (reflex and behavior development) are not masked by a treatment-induced reduction in Utter size. The culling should be carried out randomly and no attempt should be made to selec-tively cull sick or underweight pups. Since male pups weigh sig-nificantly more than females and studies have shown differences in maternal behavior toward one sex over the other, whenever possible each culled litter should consist of an equal number of males and females, o iw society of In the International Conference on Harmonization; Guideline on Detection of <b>Toxicity</b> to <b>Reproduction</b> <b>for</b> Me...|$|R
40|$|The report {{provides}} the {{summary of the}} comprehensive risk assessment of the substance 2, 4 -dinitrotoluene. It has been prepared by Spain {{in the frame of}} Council Regulation (EEC) No. 793 / 93 on the evaluation and control of the risks of existing substances, following the principles for assessment of the risks to humans and the environment, laid down in Commission Regulation (EC) No. 1488 / 94. Part I - Environment This part of the evaluation considers the emissions and the resulting exposure to the environment in all life cycle steps. Following the exposure assessment, the environmental risk characterisation for each protection goal in the aquatic, terrestrial and atmospheric compartment has been determined. The environmental risk assessment concludes that there is concern for the aquatic compartment and sediment dwelling organisms at one local site. There is no concern for the atmosphere, the terrestrial ecosystem and micro-organisms in the sewage treatment plant Part II ¿ Human Health This part of the evaluation considers the emissions and the resulting exposure to human populations in all life cycle steps. The scenarios for occupational exposure, consumer exposure and humans exposed via the environment have been examined and the possible risks have been identified. The human health risk assessment concludes that there is concern for workers with regard to mutagenicity and carcinogenicity at all worker scenarios and with regard to repeated dose toxicity and <b>toxicity</b> <b>for</b> <b>reproduction</b> (fertility) from manufacture and use of explosives. There is also concern for humans exposed via the environment with regard to carcinogenicity and mutagenicity from one local site. For consumers and for human health (physico-chemical properties) there is no concern. The conclusions of this report lead to risk reduction measures to be proposed by the Commission¿s committee on risk reduction strategies set up in support of Council Regulation (EEC) N. 793 / 93.

50|$|One {{well known}} group of {{substances}} which are toxic <b>for</b> <b>reproduction</b> are teratogens - substances which cause birth defects - of which (S)-thalidomide is {{possibly the most}} notorious. Another group of substances which has received much attention (and some controversy) as possibly toxic <b>for</b> <b>reproduction</b> are the so-called endocrine disruptors. However, many substances which are toxic <b>for</b> <b>reproduction</b> do not fall into either of these groups: lead compounds, for example, {{are considered to be}} toxic <b>for</b> <b>reproduction</b> given their adverse effects on the normal intellectual and psychomotor development of human babies and children.|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{toxicity}} testing of environmental chemicals is {{ruled by a}} framework of guidelines (OECD, OPPTS, etc.). The present paper will describe the process from the biological tests for environmental chemicals up to potential labelling and will focus on some critical aspects in this cascade of events. It is also {{the aim of this}} paper to give an overview of the existing documents and draft documents relevant for this field and available in the internet. Based on the current situation, the following points are discussed as critical issues: life stage considerations and their implications on testing, usefulness of investigations in juvenile animals, requirements for ADME studies, design and endpoints in fertility studies, use and usefulness of developmental milestones, performance of special studies versus one-study-design, considerations on transplacental carcinogenicity and early aging, significance of maternal/parental toxicity, application of triggers to justify studies, inclusion of new endpoints into test guidelines, and test strategies applied. Based on this, the usefulness of risk considerations in the current EU classification system <b>for</b> <b>toxicity</b> to <b>reproduction</b> as well as potency considerations will be discussed and suggestions will be made to improve the basic requirements for chemical testing which have remained relatively unchanged over the past 20 years...|$|R
30|$|Silver ions show {{a notorious}} broad {{spectrum}} biocide effect.

30|$|Since {{pesticides}} {{are designed}} to be toxic to at least some groups of organisms, the criterion <b>for</b> assessment of <b>toxicity</b> is likely to capture all pesticides. Therefore, classification of PPPs as PBTs under this scheme is primarily driven by the P and B. The trigger for classification as T (Table 2) is ‘Chronic NOEC < 0.01 mg/L or is a carcinogen, mutagen, or toxic <b>for</b> <b>reproduction,</b> or other evidence of toxicity.’ The NOEC trigger is strictly for aquatic organisms, which will bias classification of insecticides as T because they are usually equally or more toxic to crustaceans than they are to insects. Few PPPs are deliberately applied to water, so fate and movement in the environment are important drivers of concentrations in water, yet these factors are not considered in classification. Finally, there is no consideration of <b>toxicity</b> <b>for</b> terrestrial species, {{despite the fact that it}} is to this environmental compartment that most pesticides are routinely applied.|$|R
