[...] His time in the play was marred by personal problems; he and Eve had briefly separated and the actor was forced to rent a small flat in Sloane Square from the actor Michael Wilding after being banished from the family home. Hordern and Eve soon reconciled, {{but it was a}} time which he was keen to forget, including the play. Critics were complimentary of his performance, with one writing: [...] "Stripwells ambiguities are therefore viewed half affectionately and half contemptuously and this comes over well in Michael Hordern's portrayal of bumbling, sometimes endearing ineffectiveness, as skilful and accomplished a performance as one would expect from this actor." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chicken Little (1943) {{is similar}} to 5th Column Mouse in that it depicts how the Nazis tried to instill fear into their enemies. [...] The cartoon begins with a {{barnyard}} scene which introduces the main characters: [...] “Cocky Locky” is depicted as the leader of, “Henny Lenny” is the gossip queen, “Turkey Lurkey” is shown as the educated elite, and “Chicken Little", the dunce. [...] The animals are all seen as happy because of a large fence protecting them. [...] However, “Foxy Loxy” wants {{to get in and}} uses a book entitled [...] "Psychology" [...] to not just get one chicken, but “get them all” by aiming for least intelligent chicken in order to eventually influence the masses. [...] It also instructs that if telling a lie, it is best to make it a big one. [...] The fox then convinces Chicken Little that <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>is</b> <b>falling.</b> [...] Chicken Little initially convinces the barnyard that <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>is</b> <b>falling,</b> leading to panic. [...] Cocky Locky steps onto the scene to calm the situation explaining that Chicken Little was not hit on the head by a piece of the sky. [...] The crowd is dispersed with Chicken Little left crying and ashamed. [...] The fox then realizes that he must “undermine the faith of the masses in their leaders” according to the psychology book. [...] The fox then convinces Henny Lenny and her gossiping crowd that Cocky Locky may be wrong and if so, they will all be killed. [...] The fox then convinces Turkey Lurkey and his educated elite that Cocky Locky is displaying “totalitarian tendencies and is trying to dictate to us.” [...] The fox next reads, “By the use of flattery, insignificant people can be made to look at themselves as born leaders.” [...] Chicken Little is convinced by the fox that everyone will listen to him now and should save all the other animals and tell them what to do. [...] When the animals begin to fear for their lives and ask to know what to do, Chicken Little, who is a puppet of the fox, tells them to run to the cave. [...] When they all run inside the fox ties a napkin around his neck and announces, “dinner is served.” [...] The film quite unashamedly got across the message the dangers of creating panic and not using logic and reason in a time of crisis. [...] The book Foxy read early in the film was originally intended to be Mein Kampf, however the producers thought that this might come across as too strong to the audience.|$|E

50|$|Prior to Biot's {{thorough}} {{investigation of the}} meteorites that fell near l'Aigle, France in 1803, very few truly believed that rocks found on Earth could have extraterrestrial origins.

Serious debate concerning the unusual rocks began in 1794 when German physicist Chladni published a book claiming that rocks had an extraterrestrial origin (Westrum). Only after Biot was able to analyze the rocks at l'Aigle was it commonly accepted that the fireballs seen in <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>were</b> meteors <b>falling</b> through <b>the</b> atmosphere.

40|$|Heinz Erzberger {{never thought}} <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>was</b> <b>falling,</b> {{but he knew}} it could benefit from {{enhanced}} traffic control. Throughout the 1990 s, Erzberger led a team at Ames Research Center to develop a suite of automated tools to reduce restrictions and improve the efficiency of air traffic control operations. Called CTAS, or Center-TRACON (Terminal Radar Approach Control) Automation System, the software won NASA s Software of the Year award in 1998, and one of the tools in the suite - the traffic management advisor - was adopted by the Federal Aviation Administration and implemented at traffic control centers across the United States. Another one of the tools, Direct-To, has followed a different path. The idea behind Direct-To, explains Erzberger, a senior scientist at Ames, was that airlines could save fuel and money by shortening the routes they flew between take-off and landing. Aircraft are often limited to following established airways comprised of inefficient route segments. The routes are not easily adjusted because neither the pilot nor the aircraft controller can anticipate the constantly changing air traffic situation. To make the routes more direct while in flight, Erzberger came up with an idea for a software algorithm that could automatically examine air traffic in real-time, check to see if a shortcut was available, and then check for conflicts. If there were no conflicts and the shortcut saved more than 1 minute of flight time, the controller could be notified. "I {{was trying to figure out}} what goes on in the pilot and controller s minds when they decide to guide the aircraft in a certain way. That resulted in a different kind analysis," Erzberger says. As the engineer s idea went from theory to practice, in 2001, NASA demonstrated Direct-To in the airspace of Dallas-Ft. Worth. Estimations based on the demonstration found the technology was capable of saving 900 flying minutes per day for the aircraft in the test area...|$|R

40|$|A visitor {{from another}} planet reading the popular and {{insurance}} trade press would probably conclude that the world stands on the abyss of a business, tort, and insurance crisis of unprecedented proportion. Media coverage of an impending Year 2000 “crisis” has reached a fevered pitch, with predictions of both a gigantic volume of Year 2000 claims and a correspondingly large amount of insurance coverage litigation. Many predict that the Year 2000 problem (also known as the “Y 2 K” or “Millennium Bug” problem) will create coverage controversies and costs dwarfing major insurance battles of {{the late twentieth century}} such as those concerning coverage for asbestos claims, pollution, toxic torts, CERCLA and government-ordered pollution remediation, biomedical devices, and other long-tail product liability. Against this backdrop, it is all but impossible not to recall the venerable children 2 ̆ 7 s parable of Chicken Little, who claimed <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>was</b> <b>falling.</b> Unlike <b>the</b> original Chicken Little episode, the lurking Year 2000 problem is one that cannot be easily dismissed. Although the United States technology industry has been comparatively aggressive in attacking the problem, other nations have apparently been more lackadaisical. And, unlike the case of the original Chicken Little, there is no real harm in taking the problem very seriously. Even if the consequences of computer data misreading are not catastrophic, they are serious enough to require correction if contemporary business is to continue to function in the twenty-first century. While it is in theory possible to spend “too much” correcting the problem by diverting resources (e. g., paying overtime), no one is arguing that the Y 2 K fix is unnecessary. Where the computers at issue control weapons, dangerous substances, or traffic, the stakes are high. Although the Year 2000 problem is serious, {{it is important to remember}} that to date, as several observers have noted, the number of articles written about the Year 2000 matter dwarfs the handful of lawsuits actually filed. Although it may seem a truism, because the Year 2000 has obviously yet to arrive, the potential for Y 2 K mishaps has existed since the mid- 1990 s because of credit card validity periods, mortgage loan periods, and the like ending in the twenty-first century. Although the worst is certainly yet to come, there have already been many opportunities for computers to misread two-digit codes beginning with “ 0 ” (zero) but there has been little dramatic business loss or substantial insurance coverage litigation. Unless the “real” arrival of the Millennium Bug is dramatically more pronounced than its toddler years, the Y 2 K problem would appear to be less catastrophic than many suggest...|$|R

60|$|Last but not least, I {{come to my}} {{excellent}} friend Mr. Jones. It {{would be}} difficult to say whether I was his right-hand man, or he mine, during the voyage. Thus at table I carved, while he only scooped gravy; but at our concerts, of which more anon, he was the president who called up performers to sing, and I but his messenger who ran his errands and pleaded privately with the over-modest. I knew I liked Mr. Jones from the moment I saw him. I thought him by his face to be Scottish; nor could his accent undeceive me. For as there is a lingua franca of many tongues on the moles and in the feluccas of the Mediterranean, so there is a free or common accent among English-speaking men who follow the sea. They catch a twang in a New England Port; from a cockney skipper, even a Scotsman sometimes learns to drop an h; a word of a dialect is picked up from another band in the forecastle; until often the result is undecipherable, and you have to ask for the man’s place of birth. So it was with Mr. Jones. I thought him a Scotsman who had been long to sea; and yet he was from Wales, and had been most of his life a blacksmith at an inland forge; a few years in America and half a score of ocean voyages having sufficed to modify his speech into the common pattern. By his own account he was both strong and skilful in his trade. A few years back, he had been married and after a fashion a rich man; now the wife was dead and the money gone. But his was the nature that looks forward, and goes on from one year to another and through all the extremities of fortune undismayed; and if <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>were</b> to <b>fall</b> to-morrow, I should look to see Jones, the day following, perched on a step-ladder and getting things to rights. He was always hovering round inventions like a bee over a flower, and lived in a dream of patents. He had with him a patent medicine, for instance, the composition of which he had bought years ago for five dollars from an American pedlar, and sold the other day for a hundred pounds (I think it was) to an English apothecary. It was called Golden Oil, cured all maladies without exception; and I am bound to say that I partook of it myself with good results. It is a character of the man that he was not only perpetually dosing himself with Golden Oil, but wherever there was a head aching or a finger cut, there would be Jones with his bottle.|$|R
