5|$|The {{measures}} of taxation in {{the reign of}} Augustus were determined by population census, with fixed quotas for each province. Citizens of Rome and Italy paid indirect taxes, while direct taxes were exacted from the provinces. Indirect taxes included a 4% <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> the price of slaves, a 1% <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> goods sold at auction, and a 5% <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> the inheritance of estates valued at over 100,000 sesterces by persons other than the next of kin.|$|E
5|$|As governor, Ford raised {{revenue from}} a {{severance}} <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> coal, a two-cent-per-gallon <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> gasoline, {{and an increased}} corporate tax. He balanced these increases by exempting food from the state sales tax. The resulting large budget surplus allowed him to propose several construction projects. His victory in the primary had been largely due to Jefferson County, and he returned the favor by approving funds to build the Commonwealth Convention Center and expand the Kentucky Fair and Exposition Center. He also shepherded a package of reforms to the state's criminal justice system through the first legislative session of his term.|$|E

50|$|In {{the colonial}} era, before 1775, nearly every colony levied its own tariffs, usually with lower rates for British products. There were <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> ships (on a tonnage basis), import <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> slaves, export <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> tobacco, and import <b>taxes</b> <b>on</b> {{alcoholic}} beverages.

5|$|One of the {{principal}} sources of revenue Hamilton prevailed upon Congress to approve was an excise <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> whiskey. In his first Tariff Bill in January 1790, Hamilton proposed to raise the three million dollars needed to pay for government operating expenses and interest on domestic and foreign debts {{by means of an}} increase on duties on imported wines, distilled spirits, tea, coffee, and domestic spirits. It failed, with Congress complying with most recommendations excluding the excise <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> Whiskey (Madison's tariff of the same year was a modification of Hamilton's that involved only imported duties and was passed in September).|$|E

Supplemental forms could be filed by those eligible for certain exemptions; for example, Egyptian farmers could register fields as fallow and tax-exempt depending on flood patterns of the Nile.

5|$|Two of Daniels' other tax {{proposals}} were approved: a <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> liquor and beverages {{to fund the}} construction of the Lucas Oil Stadium and a <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> rental cars to expand the Indiana Convention Center. The new source of funding resulted in a state take-over of a project initially started by the City of Indianapolis and led to a bitter feud between Daniels and the city leadership over who should have ownership of the project. The state ultimately won and took ownership of the facilities from the city.|$|E
5|$|An {{inheritance}} tax of 5% was assessed when Roman citizens above a certain net worth left property {{to anyone but}} members of their immediate family.

We show that inexperienced voters are prone to such a tax-shifting bias, that experience is an effective de-biasing mechanism, but that pre-vote deliberation about tax regimes makes initially held opinions more extreme rather than correct. Our results suggest that voting <b>on</b> <b>taxes</b> is prone to bias and that easy-to-interpret facts are needed to de-bias voters. ...|$|R

In 2008, Minnesotans paid 10.2 percent of their income in state and local taxes; the U.S. average was 9.7 percent. The state sales tax in Minnesota is 6.875 percent, but there is no sales <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> clothing, prescription drug medications, some services, or food items for home consumption. The state legislature may allow municipalities to institute local sales taxes and special local taxes, such as the 0.5 percent supplemental sales tax in Minneapolis. Excise taxes are levied on alcohol, tobacco, and motor fuel. The state imposes a use <b>tax</b> <b>on</b> items purchased elsewhere but used within Minnesota. Owners of real property in Minnesota pay property tax to their county, municipality, school district, and special taxing districts.|$|E
