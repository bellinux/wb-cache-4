5|$|The main {{building}} designed by Lange is in historicism and was originally built in two stories in brick. A third was {{added in the}} 1950s, some {{with some of the}} original feel being lost in the addition, since it was not stylistically true. In 1965 two annexes were built, one on each side and in two stories. The western was used for offices and the other as part of <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> area—these were both in line with the historicist style. They replaced a cargo expedition and a restaurant building, respectively. In 1995 the bus station was moved from the city center at Leüthenhaven to the central station, and the eastern annex was razed in favor of a postmodernistic glass and concrete building. In addition to the bus station it features and extension of <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> area, offices, a restaurant and a parking lot.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{conduct an}} {{experimental}} study {{to examine the}} impact of two types of waiting information - waiting-duration information and queuing information - on consumers' reactions to waits of different lengths. The authors test a model that includes three different constructs - perceived waiting duration, acceptability of <b>the</b> <b>wait,</b> and affective response to <b>the</b> <b>wait</b> - as mediators between waiting information and service evaluation. Results show that though acceptability of <b>the</b> <b>wait</b> and affective response to <b>the</b> <b>wait</b> have a significant mediating effect on <b>the</b> relationship between <b>waiting</b> information and service evaluation, perceived waiting duration does not. Moreover, neither type of information has significant impact in the short-wait condition, whereas waiting-duration information has greater impact than queuing information in the intermediate-wait condition and a smaller impact in the long-wait condition. The authors conclude with a discussion of research and managerial implications. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
