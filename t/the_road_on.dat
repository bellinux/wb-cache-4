5|$|The club {{originally}} {{played at}} Newmarket Road {{before moving to}} The Nest. When The Nest was deemed inadequate for the size of crowds it was attracting, the Carrow Road ground, named after <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>on</b> which it is located, was purpose-built by Norwich City in just 82 days and opened on 31 August 1935.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} station {{building was}} a temporary structure positioned over {{the tracks and}} the platforms were sheltered with individual awnings rather than the all-over glazed roof provided at the DR's other stations. Access to the station was via a passageway from Bridge Street and a pedestrian subway under <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> <b>On</b> 30 May 1870, the railway was extended to Blackfriars.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the road}} had been opened between Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri, the convoy {{still had to}} fight through the {{numerous}} Chinese positions on the hills overlooking <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> <b>On</b> {{the first night of}} the retreat, the Chinese struck the convoy in force and inflicted heavy casualties upon 3rd Battalion, 5th Marines (3/5). Although strong air cover suppressed most of the Chinese forces {{for the rest of the}} march, the cold weather, harassing fire, raiding parties, and road blocks slowed the retreat to a crawl while inflicting numerous casualties. Despite those difficulties, the convoy reached Hagaru-ri in an orderly fashion on the afternoon of 3 December, with the withdrawal completed on 4 December.|$|E

5|$|As the Operation Papuk-91 completed, the HV units {{subordinated to}} the Pakrac OG {{advanced}} to the villages of Kraguj, Japaga and Šeovica on 26–27 December 1991, outflanking the southern parts of Pakrac held by the JNA and the TO. The JNA employed the reinforcements it received to counter the threat. On 28 December, the JNA recaptured the two villages and threatened the Pakrac–Požega road. The same day, the HV retreated from Kraguj {{to the village of}} Kusonje to defend <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> <b>On</b> 29 December, the 127th Infantry Brigade suffered a loss of 12 killed or captured as it performed reconnaissance of positions held by the JNA and the TO on the Psunj Mountain, in the villages of Brusnik and Lipovac. The unit failed to advance later on.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, 1st Battalion, 7th Marines (1/7) {{also tried to}} break the Chinese {{blockade}} at Hill 1419 on 1 December. Despite being badly reduced by combat, hunger and frostbite, the PVA 59th Division sent in its last five platoons and refused to yield. As night approached, 1/7 finally captured the peak and started to march through the hills {{on the east side}} of the road. Relying on the element of surprise, they managed to destroy several Chinese positions along <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> <b>On</b> the morning of 2 December, a joint attack by Fox Company and 1/7 secured the Toktong Pass, thus opening the road between Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1919, Mount Pleasant Road {{existed between}} St. Clair Avenue and Blythwood Road, ending at {{the rim of the}} Blythwood Ravine. Despite this, <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>on</b> the {{opposite}} rim was renamed from Sidmouth Avenue in 1920. Following the construction of the Vale of Avoca {{in the first half of}} the 1920s, the newly formed Toronto Transit Commission extended the St. Clair streetcar line east to Mount Pleasant Road December 1, 1924 and then north to Eglinton Avenue on November 4, 1925.|$|E

5|$|Faced {{with the}} sudden {{appearance}} of the overwhelming Chinese forces, the ROK 1st Infantry Division tried to establish defensive positions by capturing the hills around Unsan. The South Koreans soon {{found themselves in a}} seesaw battle with the PVA 360th Regiment during the night of 25 October. The next day, the PVA 39th Corps arrived at the west of Unsan while cutting the road between Unsan and Yongsan-dong, completely surrounding the ROK 1st Infantry Division. Aided by airdrops, the US 6th Medium Tank Battalion and the US 10th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Group, the ROK 1st Infantry Division reopened <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>on</b> 27 October. Several more attempts to advance north by the Koreans made little progress, and the fighting stopped by 28 October.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the stands}} have more {{traditional}} names, but {{have since been}} renamed because of sponsorship deals. The JCT600 Stand is the ground's main stand, and is often called the latter by fans, but {{is also known as}} the Sunwin stand owing to the former sponsor. The Kop, was the former standing area, and its name was derived, like at many stadia across the country, from the Battle of Spion Kop. The East Stand, sponsored by Northern Commercials, is also named the Midland Road stand, because of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>on</b> that side of the ground. The TL Dallas Stand is also known as the Bradford end, because it is nearest to the city centre.|$|E
5|$|Northeast of Brent Cross, at Henlys Corner, the North Circular briefly shares carriageways {{with the}} A1 which joins {{it from the}} left and leaves it {{to the right to}} head into Central London.

Transport for London have invested in the junction, including a special hands free crossing for the local Jewish community, who can then cross <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>on</b> the Sabbath. The road passes north of St Pancras and Islington Cemetery towards Friern Barnet and Muswell Hill. The road narrows to two lane single carriageway to pass under a railway bridge, and continues as Telford Road towards Bounds Green.|$|E

5|$|On September 16, 1944, {{leaders of}} the Blocco del popolo (Popular Front) in Sicily, the {{communist}} Girolamo Li Causi and Pantaleone, went {{to speak to the}} landless labourers at a rally in Villalba, challenging Don Calò in his own personal fiefdom. In the morning tensions rose when Christian Democrat mayor Beniamino Farina – a relative of Vizzini as well as his successor as mayor – angered local communists by ordering all hammer-and-sickle signs erased from buildings along <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>on</b> which Li Causi would travel into town. When his supporters protested, they were intimidated by separatists and thugs.|$|E
5|$|Settlement in {{the area}} was slow, though Caversham Valley was a {{preferred}} route south out of the city. The Central Otago Gold Rush of 1861 led to rapid changes when thousands of people began using <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>on</b> their way {{to and from the}} gold fields. The suburb began to expand rapidly at about this time, and the first public house, the Edinburgh Castle Hotel, was erected in 1861. By the end of the decade, Caversham had its own school, post office, drill hall (from the Southern District Rifles), and Anglican and Presbyterian churches. A third church, for the Baptist denomination, followed in 1872.|$|E
5|$|The {{entirety}} of SR357 exists {{within the confines}} of South Bass Island in Lake Erie. It is located within Put-in-Bay Township in Ottawa County.

5|$|While {{the battle}} was {{underway}} at Yudam-ni, the PVA 59th Division blocked the road between Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri by attacking the defending Charlie and Fox Companies of the 7th Marines. The successful assault forced Charlie Company to retreat into Yudam-ni which left Fox Company trapped in Toktong Pass, a vital pass that controlled <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> <b>On</b> 29 November, several efforts by the 7th Marines failed to rescue Fox Company despite inflicting heavy casualties on the Chinese. Aided by artillery from Hagaru-ri and Marine Corsair fighters, Fox Company managed to hold out for five days while enduring constant attacks by the PVA 59th Division.|$|E
5|$|Check's 1st Battalion was not {{attacked}} until 06:30 on July 24, {{shortly after}} daybreak {{in a heavy}} fog that allowed the North Koreans to approach {{very close to the}} US positions before they were observed. Two US infantry companies on either side of <b>the</b> <b>road</b> <b>on</b> low ridges held the forward positions. North Korean mortar fire fell on the men there, and then T-34 tanks appeared at the bend in the road and opened fire with their main cannons and machine guns as they approached. North Korean infantry followed the tanks. Although the two rifle companies stopped the North Korean infantry, the tanks penetrated their positions and fired into the battalion command post which was behind B Company. This tank fire destroyed several vehicles and killed the medical officer. A company commander knocked out one tank but was injured in the process.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to heavy}} rainfall, {{widespread}} flooding was reported, {{especially in the}} central and western portions of the county. Whole neighborhoods in The Acreage, Loxahatchee, Royal Palm Beach, and Wellington were left stranded for up to several days.
