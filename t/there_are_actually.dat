5|$|The {{building}} was rebuilt in 1953 {{after having been}} destroyed during the war. The pavilion measures three bays by two, but is nearly a perfect square. It is built on a short stone platform called a yuetai (月台) which is accessed by a short set of stairs. While from the outside, the pavilion appears to only have two stories, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> three, with the second floor being hidden from outside view. Each of the exterior levels {{is surrounded by a}} perimeter of columns.|$|E
5|$|There {{are obvious}} {{connections}} {{in the design of}} the Slaying of Holofernes and the Slaying of Haman at the opposite end of the chapel. Although in the Holofernes picture the figures are smaller and the space less filled, both have the triangular space divided into two zones by a vertical wall, allowing us to see what is happening on both sides of it. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> three scenes in the Haman picture because as well as seeing Haman punished, we see him at the table with Esther and the King and get a view of the King on his bed. Mordechai sits on the steps, making a link between the scenes.|$|E
5|$|Tom Kenderson (Alan Autry), an {{old friend}} and {{baseball}} teammate of bartender Sam Malone (Ted Danson), announces in his forthcoming autobiography that he is homosexual. At a press conference held at the bar, Sam, having not read the book in advance, is shocked about Tom's revelation. Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) helps Sam to calm down, and they discuss Tom. Moments later, Sam publicly accepts and supports Tom and his sexuality, which local newspapers report on their front pages. The next day, as they read the newspaper, the bar's regular patronsincluding Norm (George Wendt)express their disdain toward homosexuals and their worries that Sam's support for his old friend will turn Cheers into a gay bar. Diane criticizes their homophobia and says that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> two gay men in the bar.|$|E

5000|$|It {{has been}} {{questioned}} {{whether or not the}} beads actually contain water from Mt. Everest or mud from the Dead Sea. In response to such criticism, wearers have resorted to cutting apart [...] their bracelets to see if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>actually</b> anything inside. Most wearers discovered <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>actually</b> some kind of mud and water inside, but some claim to have found just empty beads.|$|R

5|$|When making observations, {{scientists}} {{look through}} telescopes, study images on electronic screens, record meter readings, and so on. Generally, on a basic level, they {{can agree on}} what they see, e.g., the thermometer shows 37.9 degrees C. But, if these scientists have different ideas about the theories {{that have been developed}} to explain these basic observations, they may disagree about what they are observing. For example, before Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, observers would have likely interpreted the image at left as five different objects in space. In light of that theory, however, astronomers will tell you that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> only two objects, one in the center and four different images of a second object around the sides. Alternatively, if other scientists suspect that something is wrong with the telescope and only one object is actually being observed, they are operating under yet another theory. Observations that cannot be separated from theoretical interpretation are said to be theory-laden.|$|E
25|$|However, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> two straits {{that could}} be called {{the middle of the}} channel: Haro Strait, along {{the west side of the}} San Juan Islands; and Rosario Strait, along the east side.|$|E
25|$|NASA's WISE {{mission has}} {{detected}} 200 new brown dwarfs. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> fewer brown dwarfs in our cosmic neighborhood than previously thought. Rather than one star for every brown dwarf, {{there may be}} as many as six stars for every brown dwarf.|$|E

25|$|Hell realm (Naraka): hell beings endure unimaginable {{suffering}} for eons of time. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> eighteen {{different types of}} hells, each inflicting {{a different kind of}} torment. In the hot hells, beings suffer from unbearable heat and continual torments of various kinds. In the cold hells, beings suffer from unbearable cold and other torments.|$|E
25|$|The {{interpretation}} of Cantor's result {{will depend upon}} one's view of mathematics. To constructivists, the argument shows {{no more than that}} there is no bijection between the natural numbers and T. It does not {{rule out the possibility that}} the latter are subcountable. In the context of classical mathematics, this is impossible, and the diagonal argument establishes that, although both sets are infinite, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> more infinite sequences of ones and zeros than there are natural numbers.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{attractiveness}} is {{an important}} element of romantic relationships, particularly in the early stages characterized by high levels of passion. Later on, similarity and other compatibility factors become more important, and the type of love people experience shifts from passionate to companionate. Robert Sternberg has suggested that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> three components of love: intimacy, passion, and commitment. When two (or more) people experience all three, they are said to be in a state of consummate love.|$|E

25|$|A book of {{the show}} has become all but necessary, if only {{to allow us to}} ingest this {{information}} at normal brain speed, and because such fine and creative research genuinely deserves to be captured in print. So it's slightly disappointing that the book arrives in the question-and-answer format made so familiar by last year's big hit Does Anything Eat Wasps? <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> about 20 such books out this year, all asking these quirky questions (Do Sheep Shrink In The Rain? Do Fish Drink Water?), all piled up in Waterstones, making book-buyers feel a bit depressed.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major feature}} is the Harecastle Tunnel, near Kidsgrove {{in the city of}} Stoke-on-Trent, north Staffordshire. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> two tunnels; the first was built by Brindley and was 2880 yards (2633 m) long, and boats were 'legged' through by men lying on their backs and pushing against the roof with their feet. This was a {{physically}} demanding and slow process and created major delays, so leading civil engineer Thomas Telford was commissioned to provide a second, wider, parallel tunnel with a towpath. This 2926 yard (2676 m) long tunnel was opened in 1827. In the 1900s, the Brindley tunnel was closed due to severe subsidence, but the Telford Tunnel - although also prone to the same problems - remains in use, and is the fourth-longest navigable canal tunnel in the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|The first {{hearing was}} held on November 25, 2013, for which Bill Baroni {{attended}} {{on behalf of the}} PA. Baroni, who was not sworn in to testify under oath, said that David Wildstein had ordered a study to determine if closing two of the Fort Lee toll lanes, and assigning them to mainline traffic, would shorten delays for commuters from other parts of New Jersey. Baroni argued that it was unfair that Fort Lee drivers occupied three out of the 12 lanes on the upper level, despite being only 4.5% of all traffic. Committee members pointed out that 4.5% was {{based on the number of}} E-ZPass users from Fort Lee that use all approaches to the bridge, and that vehicles from many other towns, besides Fort Lee, use that Fort Lee entrance. He admitted the actual percentage of vehicles, which utilize that Fort Lee entrance, could be higher than 4.5% of overall traffic, and also failed to mention that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> 29 operating toll lanes for the bridge when comparing the three dedicated toll lanes for this entrance.|$|E

25|$|Standard {{alphanumeric}} keyboards have keys {{that are}} on three-quarter inch centers (0.750inches, 19.05mm), and have a key travel of at least 0.150inches (3.81mm). Desktop computer keyboards, such as the 101-key US traditional keyboards or the 104-key Windows keyboards, include alphabetic characters, punctuation symbols, numbers {{and a variety of}} function keys. The internationally common 102/104 key keyboards have a smaller left shift key and an additional key with some more symbols between that and the letter to its right (usually Z or Y). Also the enter key is usually shaped differently. Computer keyboards are similar to electric-typewriter keyboards but contain additional keys, such as the command or Windows keys. There is no standard computer keyboard, although many manufacture imitate the keyboard of PCs. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> three different PC keyboard: the original PC keyboard with 84 keys, the AT keyboard also with 84 keys and the enhanced keyboard with 101 keys. The three differ somewhat in the placement of function keys, the control keys, the return key, and the shift key.|$|E
500|$|The {{title for}} the episode is {{purposely}} vague. During the commentary, the cast revealed that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> three [...] "secrets" [...] in the episode: Jim's hidden feelings for Pam, Dwight and Angela's relationship, and Oscar's homosexuality. Stupkitsky later joked that there are [...] "actually nine secrets in the episode". The cold opening – wherein Michael tries to tell a joke where the punch line is [...] "What's up dog?" [...] – {{was inspired by the}} same prank being pulled on Stupnitsky. The original cold opening for the episode featured Michael playing golf in his office, but it was cut.|$|E

500|$|Cobb {{has also}} been active in formulating his own {{theories}} of religious pluralism, partly in response to another Claremont Graduate University professor, John Hick. [...] Cobb's pluralism has sometimes {{been identified as a}} kind of [...] "deep" [...] pluralism or, alternately, as a [...] "complementary" [...] pluralism. [...] He believes that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> three distinct religious ultimates: 1) God, 2) Creativity/Emptiness/Nothingness/Being-itself, and 3) the cosmos/universe. [...] Cobb believes that all of these elements are necessary and present in some form in every religion but that different faiths tend to stress one ultimate over the others. [...] Viewed in this way, different religions may be seen to complement each other by providing insight into different religious ultimates. [...] Cobb's pluralism thus avoids the criticism of conflating religions that are actually very different (for instance, Buddhism and Christianity) while still affirming the possible truths of both.|$|E
500|$|<b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>actually</b> three Stanley Cups: the {{original}} bowl of the [...] "Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup", the authenticated [...] "Presentation Cup", and the [...] "Replica Cup" [...] {{on display at}} the Hockey Hall of Fame. The NHL has maintained effective control over both the trophy itself and its associated trademarks. [...] Nevertheless, the NHL does not actually own the trophy, but instead uses it by agreement with the two Canadian Trustees of the Cup. The NHL has registered trademarks associated with the name and likeness of the Stanley Cup, although the league's right to outright own trademarks associated with a trophy it does not own has been disputed by some legal experts. The original bowl was made of silver and is 18.5centimetres (7.28inches) in height and 29centimetres (11.42inches) in diameter. The current Stanley Cup, topped with a copy of {{the original}} bowl, is made of a silver and nickel alloy; it has a height of 89.54centimetres (35.25inches) and weighs 15.5kilograms (34.5lb / 2 st 6½ lb).|$|E
