5|$|Harley's co-creator, Paul Dini, {{describes}} <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> as Harley being {{someone who}} makes the Joker feel better about himself, and who can do the work {{that he does not}} want to do himself. In the 1999 one-shot comic Batman: Harley Quinn, the Joker decides to kill Harley, after admitting that he does care for her, that <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> is romantic, and that these feelings prevent him from fulfilling his purpose. Removing the traditional male-female relationship, such as in the Batman: Thrillkiller storyline where the Joker (Bianca Steeplechase) is a female and involved in a lesbian relationship with Harley, <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> lacks any aspects of violence or subjugation.|$|E
5|$|Riley renewed his {{relationship}} with Bottsworth for a third and final time in 1883. The two corresponded frequently and had secret lovers' rendezvous. He stopped visiting other women and <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> became more dedicated and stable. Bottsworth, however, became convinced Riley was seeing another woman, and they terminated <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> in January 1885. Riley's sister, Mary, had become {{a close friend of}} Bottsworth and scolded him for his mistreatment of her. Her reputation was tarnished by the affair and she found it difficult to find employment once <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> ended.|$|E
5|$|According to Shinkai, {{shoes were}} {{a metaphor for}} life as Yukari learned to walk again, while Takao's shoe-making typified <b>their</b> <b>relationship.</b> Similarly, Yukari's choice of food and beverages—initially beer and chocolate, due to a stress-induced taste disorder—was a metaphor for her {{emotional}} health.|$|E

5|$|Bart {{learns that}} the couple {{have lost their jobs}} and feels remorseful. After Seymour apologizes to Bart for {{embarrassing}} him, Bart encourages the former principal to stand up for himself and Edna. Agreeing to Bart's comment, Seymour and Edna lock down the school, call the media (with Bart's help) and make their demands: They want their jobs back and the townspeople to not interfere with <b>their</b> <b>relationship.</b> However, several residents reply with their accusation about the two having sexual intercourse in the janitor's closet described by their children. Seymour insists nothing of the sort happened and that he is a virgin. At first, everyone is speechless, but being on the basis of being such an embarrassing thing for someone his age to admit, they {{think it has to be}} true. Realizing that they have overreacted over the relationship, the residents peacefully leave, believing that no one would pretend to be a 44-year-old virgin. Chalmers agrees to reinstate Seymour and Edna as though nothing ever happened, but insists that they keep <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> at a minimum level during school days. The couple decide to continue <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> more privately than ever by convincing Bart that they have broken up after thanking him for helping them. They then go back into <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> and enter the janitor's closet where they presumably have sex.|$|E

5|$|Both {{males and}} females can defend the pride against intruders, but the male lion is better-suited for this purpose due to its stockier, more {{powerful}} build. Some individuals consistently lead the defence against intruders, while others lag behind. Lions tend to assume specific roles in the pride. Those lagging behind may provide other valuable services to the group. An alternative hypothesis {{is that there is}} some reward associated with being a leader who fends off intruders, and the rank of lionesses in the pride is reflected in these responses. The male or males associated with the pride must defend <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> to the pride from outside males who attempt to take over <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> with the pride.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to give an insight of the {{construction}} of girls in <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> with friends and lovers in the Swedish magazine Julia. The magazine turns to girls of age nine to fourteen. The research questions were 1) What is the construction of the girls in <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> with friends and lovers about in Julia? 2) How are girls constructed in <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> with friends and lovers? Three issues of the magazine from the winter of 2014 were selected as material for the study. Critical discourse analysis (Fairclough, 1992, 2010) was the point of departure in the analysis. The main findings of the study were that the magazine focused on that girls should have a love relation that is heterosexual monogamous and that the magazine encourages the girls to make friends. The magazine also described how girls should be in <b>their</b> <b>relationships</b> with friends and lovers and what activities they could practise with their friends and lovers. The magazine’s construction of how girls should be could be discussed as if that leaves the readers, i. e. mainly girls, with a feeling that they do not have the opportunity to make several choices about <b>their</b> <b>relationships...</b>|$|R

However, <b>their</b> <b>relationship</b> had broken down {{by the end of the}} war after Model was defeated at the Battle of the Bulge.
