40|$|Graduation date: 1981 This study {{evaluated}} {{the recovery of}} compacted soils on logging skid trails in clearcuts of the western Cascade Mountains of Oregon. Soil types included clay, clay loam, silt loam, loam, sandy loam and loamy sands. Sites {{ranged in age from}} five to 38 years since harvest and 370 to llOOm in elevation. Soil bulk density, measured with a nuclear density probe, was used to characterize compacted soil conditions. A number of soil, vegetation and site variables were studied to determine possible cause and effect relationships with compaction recovery. Study design consisted of nine sites with nine plots at each site. Plots were classed by level of use with three plots in each of the low, medium and high use level classes. At each plot, measurements of bulk density were taken at the skid trail center, skid <b>trail</b> <b>track</b> and the less-disturbed area adjacent to the skid trail. Determination of vegetative cover was also made at these locations. Depths of measurement for bulk density were 5. 1 cm, 15. 2 cm and 30. 5 cm. No statistical difference of bulk density values was detected between skid trail use-level classes. A similar result was found for the vegetative cover variables. Bulk density values on the skid trail center and skid <b>trail</b> <b>track</b> were statistically similar. However, density on the skid <b>trail</b> <b>track</b> (and center) were greater than those of the less-disturbed area ([alpha]= 0. 05). When the data were stratified by site age, the skid <b>trail</b> <b>track</b> still retained greater bulk densities than the less-disturbed area on the 38 year old site. No trends in bulk density changes were observed over time. Interaction between herbaceous cover and overstory cover decreased the usefulness of these variables for correlation with recovery. However, shrubs indicated a reduction of percent cover on skid trails up to 21 years since harvest, but not after that time. This was the only variable measured which indicated possible skid trail recovery. Regression analysis was performed using the bulk density difference between the skid <b>trail</b> <b>track</b> and less-disturbed area as the dependent variable and several soil, site and vegetative variables as independents. Multicolinearity among the independent variables was high and when coupled with the variable nature of the bulk density data, produced inconsistent results...|$|E

Navigation tactics are similar to ski-orienteering, where the major focus is route choice while navigating.

As the biker reaches higher speeds, map reading becomes more challenging.|$|R

50|$|The first earth {{tracks were}} created by humans {{carrying}} goods and often followed <b>trails.</b> <b>Tracks</b> would be naturally created at points of high traffic density. As animals were domesticated, horses, oxen and donkeys became an element in track-creation. With the growth of trade, tracks were often flattened or widened to accommodate animal traffic. Later, the travois, a frame used to drag loads, was developed. Animal-drawn wheeled vehicles were probably developed in the Ancient Near East in the 4th or 5th millennium BC and spread to Europe and India in the 4th millennium BC and China in about 1200 BC. The Romans had a significant need for good roads to extend and maintain their empire and developed Roman roads.|$|R
