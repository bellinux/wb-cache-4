5|$|The abdomen is {{bronze to}} black {{with a white}} basal band and two white <b>transverse</b> bands. The <b>transverse</b> bands are often broken to form six spots. Some {{or all of these}} spots may be lacking, however.|$|E
5|$|A new {{construction}} technique {{was employed to}} save weight. Previous battlecruisers were built {{with a combination of}} <b>transverse</b> and longitudinal steel frames; the Derfflinger-class ships dispensed with the <b>transverse</b> frames and used only the longitudinal ones. This enabled the ship to retain structural strength and a lower weight. As with all preceding capital ships, the outer hull spaces between the hull wall and the torpedo bulkhead were used for coal storage.|$|E

5|$|Bulker hulls {{are made}} of steel, usually mild steel. Some {{manufacturers}} have preferred high-tensile steel recently {{in order to reduce}} the tare weight. However, the use of high-tensile steel for longitudinal and <b>transverse</b> reinforcements can reduce the hull's rigidity and resistance to corrosion. Forged steel is used for some ship parts, such as the propeller shaft support. <b>Transverse</b> partitions {{are made of}} corrugated iron, reinforced at the bottom and at connections. The construction of bulker hulls using a concrete-steel sandwich has been investigated.|$|E
5|$|The Rainy Lobe of the Wisconsin {{glaciation}} was {{the most}} recent of the glaciation events, and it retreated about 10,000years ago. Glacial scratches and grooves in Rove rocks indicate a north or somewhat east-of-north glacial movement. This direction is <b>transverse</b> to the general trend on the valleys and ridges. The lakes in the Rove Formation area are unique from other well-known linear bedrock lakes in North America because their long axes lie <b>transverse</b> to the general movement of the glaciers.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{there is}} a unique {{combination}} of traits not in themselves unique. The <b>transverse</b> processes, the side extensions, of the tail are present up to the twenty-eighth vertebra of the series. The <b>transverse</b> processes of the front tail vertebrae are rod-shaped with narrow bases and do not touch the plate formed by the fusion of the processes of the sacral vertebrae. The chevrons, bones pointing to below from the bottom side of the tail vertebrae, have {{the shape of an}} inverted T. The length of the ilium equals, or is greater than, that of the thighbone.|$|E

5|$|The {{first few}} dorsal {{vertebrae}} {{are similar to}} the cervical vertebrae, but have taller and more prong-like neural spines. The rest are amphiplatyan, meaning that they are flat at both ends. They also have postzygapophyses which are less elongate and more pedestal-like, in addition to taller and more rectangular neural spines. The parapophyses, which are depressions instead of projections, have moved off from the <b>transverse</b> processes to the neural arch, between the <b>transverse</b> processes and the articular processes known as the prezygapophyses {{at the front of the}} vertebrae. However, they move back onto the base of the <b>transverse</b> processes in the last few dorsals. In the third or fourth dorsal, the parapophysis is located very close to the suture between the neural spine and the centrum, which is unlike the other dorsals but similar to the first few dorsals in Edmontosaurus. Also like Edmontosaurus, the median ridge separating the prezygapophyses become more pronounced in the rear dorsals.|$|E

5|$|The rufous-crowned sparrow (Aimophila ruficeps) {{is a small}} American sparrow. This {{passerine}} {{is primarily}} found across the Southwestern United States {{and much of the}} interior of Mexico, south to the <b>transverse</b> mountain range, and to the Pacific coast to the southwest of the <b>transverse</b> range. Its distribution is patchy, with populations often being isolated from each other. Twelve subspecies are generally recognized, though up to eighteen have been suggested. This bird has a brown back with darker streaks and gray underparts. The crown is rufous, and the face and supercilium are gray with a brown or rufous streak extending from each eye and a thick black malar streak.|$|E
5|$|The third theory {{suggests}} that restricted venous drainage from the brain may be impaired resulting in congestion. Many patients with IIH have narrowing of the <b>transverse</b> sinuses. It {{is not clear whether}} this narrowing is the pathogenesis of the disease or a secondary phenomenon. It has been proposed that a positive biofeedback loop may exist, where raised ICP (intracranial pressure) causes venous narrowing in the <b>transverse</b> sinuses, resulting in venous hypertension (raised venous pressure), decreased CSF resorption via arachnoid granulation and further rise in ICP.|$|E
25|$|A wave can be <b>transverse,</b> where a {{disturbance}} creates oscillations that are {{perpendicular to the}} propagation of energy transfer, or longitudinal: the oscillations are parallel to the direction of energy propagation. While mechanical waves can be both <b>transverse</b> and longitudinal, all electromagnetic waves are <b>transverse</b> in free space.|$|E

25|$|The {{frontal plane}} or coronal plane divides the body into dorsal and ventral (back and front, or {{posterior}} and anterior) portions.

A longitudinal plane is any plane {{perpendicular to the}} <b>transverse</b> plane. The coronal plane and the sagittal plane are examples of longitudinal planes.|$|E
