5|$|<b>The</b> <b>goals</b> of Kanō's {{educational}} philosophies {{and methods}} (indeed, <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> of most Japanese educational {{programs of the}} early 20th century) were to 1) develop minds, bodies, and spirits in equal proportion, 2) increase patriotism and loyalty, especially to the Emperor, 3) teach public morality, and 4) increase physical strength and stamina, especially {{for the purpose of}} making young men more fit for military service.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>goal</b> {{judge is}} an {{official}} positioned off ice behind each <b>goal</b> for <b>the</b> specific purpose of indicating when the puck has crossed <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> line and entered <b>the</b> <b>goal.</b> For arenas so equipped, <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> judge {{turns on a}} red light behind <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> {{when he sees the}} puck cross <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> line. As in all matters, however, the referee retains final authority and can override the opinion of <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> judge.|$|R
50|$|Note: Since <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> {{average was}} {{used for this purpose}} for such a long time, it is {{presented}} in the tables below even for the seasons prior to 1894-95, and since <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> difference is a more informative piece of information for a modern reader than <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> average, <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> difference is added in this presentation after <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> average.|$|R
5000|$|No attacking or {{defending}} players {{other than}} the defending goalkeeper are allowed to touch the floor of <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> area (within six metres of <b>the</b> <b>goal).</b> A shot or pass in <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> area is valid if completed before touching the floor. Goalkeepers are allowed outside <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> area, but {{are not allowed to}} cross <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> area boundary with the ball in their hands.|$|R

5|$|In 1953 Bolton {{played in}} one of the most famous FA Cup finals of all time– The Stanley Matthews Final of 1953. Bolton lost the game to Blackpool 4–3 after gaining a 3–1 lead. Blackpool were victorious thanks to the skills of Matthews and <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> of Stan Mortensen.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>goal</b> umpire {{signals a}} goal with two hands pointed forward at elbow height, or a behind with one hand. <b>The</b> <b>goal</b> umpire then waves flags {{above their heads}} to confirm <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> or behind to <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> umpire at <b>the</b> {{opposite}} end of the ground.|$|R
50|$|The kick {{is taken}} from where the {{infringement}} occurred, unless the offence was committed within <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> area of <b>the</b> team awarded the kick, {{in which case the}} kick may be taken from anywhere within <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> area. An indirect free kick within <b>the</b> opposing team's <b>goal</b> area {{is taken from}} <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> area line, parallel to <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> line, nearest to where the infringement occurred (i.e. at least 6 yards from <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> line).|$|R
50|$|At {{the start}} of each period, teams line up on their own <b>goal</b> line. <b>The</b> most common {{formation}} is for three players to go each side of <b>the</b> <b>goal,</b> while <b>the</b> goalkeeper stays in <b>the</b> <b>goal.</b> If <b>the</b> ball is to be thrown {{into the center of the}} pool, the sprinter will often start in <b>the</b> <b>goal,</b> while <b>the</b> goalkeeper starts either in <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> as well, or to one side of <b>the</b> <b>goal.</b>|$|R
5|$|In June 2008, Fowler participated {{alongside}} McManaman in Steve Nash and Claudio Reyna's Showdown in Chinatown, an 8-on-8 charity {{soccer game}} at Sara D. Roosevelt Park in Manhattan with McManaman making five of <b>the</b> <b>goals,</b> {{including one for}} Fowler.|$|E
5|$|The Dubious Goals Committee has {{sometimes}} decided after a match that players have not scored hat-tricks {{because one of}} <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> was incorrectly credited to them. Southampton player Egil Østenstad was thought to have scored a hat-trick against Manchester United in 1996, but the committee ruled that one of <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> be credited as an own goal to United's Phil Neville. Anelka's first goal for Manchester City in September 2002 was later credited as an own goal to Everton's Tomasz Radzinski. Javier Hernández was denied a hat-trick against Aston Villa in November 2011 after the committee ruled his second goal was actually an own goal by Ron Vlaar.|$|E

5|$|The Poor People's Campaign was {{controversial}} {{even within}} the civil rights movement. Rustin resigned from the march, stating that <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> of the campaign were too broad, that its demands were unrealizable, and {{that he thought that}} these campaigns would accelerate the backlash and repression on the poor and the black.|$|E
5|$|The playoff {{campaign}} was a high-scoring one, with there being {{an average of}} 4⅔ goals per game in the three matches played. The semi-final was against Lincoln City, and was played over two legs. The first leg at the Memorial Stadium was won 2–1 by Rovers, thanks to goals by Craig Disley and Richard Walker. The second leg was played at Sincil Bank and ended 5–3, with Stuart Campbell, Rickie Lambert, Richard Walker, Sammy Igoe and Sean Rigg scoring <b>the</b> <b>goals.</b> This gave Rovers a 7–4 aggregate win and {{a place in the}} final at Wembley Stadium. A record attendance for a League Two playoff final of 61,589 watched the game, and saw Rovers win the match 3–1 and gain promotion for only the fourth time in the club's history. Richard Walker scored two of <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> and Sammy Igoe scored the other.|$|E
5|$|Tolkien scholar Mark T. Hooker has catalogued {{a lengthy}} series of {{parallels}} between The Hobbit and Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth.

30|$|In this algorithm, a robot begins {{movement}} {{at the start}} and proceeds towards <b>the</b> <b>goal.</b> It arrives at either <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> or an obstacle (hit point). Once an obstacle is encountered, the robot will completely circumnavigate the obstacle before proceeding forward from the point on the perimeter that has the shortest distance to <b>the</b> <b>goal.</b> This point is called a leave point. From leave point, the robot continues to move directly toward <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> again. Perhaps <b>the</b> most straightforward path planning approach is to move toward <b>the</b> <b>goal,</b> unless an obstacle is encountered, in which case, circumnavigate the obstacle until motion toward <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> is once again allowable. Essentially, the Bug 1 algorithm formalizes the “common sense” idea of moving toward <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> and going around obstacles (Choset et al. 2007).|$|R
50|$|The 12 {{winners are}} then {{eligible}} for the big annual event, the GotY Award. Again, <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> with <b>the</b> most votes wins.

50|$|In ice hockey, a goal is scored {{when the}} puck {{completely}} crosses <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> line between <b>the</b> two <b>goal</b> posts and below <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> crossbar. A goal awards {{one point to}} the team attacking <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> scored upon, regardless of which team the player who actually deflected the puck into <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> belongs to (see also own goal). Typically, a player on the team attempting to score shoots the puck with his/her stick towards <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> net opening, and a player on the opposing team called a goaltender tries to block the shot to prevent a goal from being scored against his/her team.|$|R
5|$|After the World Cup, Corinthians is {{preparing}} the stadium {{for their use}}; they consider it is 92% ready for their use just after the tournament. It {{is expected to be}} completely retrofitted by February 2015. The estimated cost is R$20million. One of the largest changes will be the construction of large balconies and the installation of scoreboards behind <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> where the temporary seating installed for the FIFA World Cup stands.|$|E
5|$|As group runners-up, Juventus {{had to face}} a group winner – Germans Borussia Dortmund of Group D – in {{the last}} 16. They won 2–1 {{at home in the}} first leg on 24 February 2015, with all <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> in the first half – visitor Marco Reus {{equalised}} either side of strikes from Tevez and Álvaro Morata. The same forwards were on target in the second leg at the Westfalenstadion on 18 March – Tevez scored twice, including in the third minute – as Juventus won 3–0, and 5–1 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|Burgmeier has won 110caps {{and scored}} nine goals for his country. He is a right-footed player who {{is either a}} left midfielder or left back, {{with the ability to}} deliver a good cross.

Additionally, as the proximal distance to <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> end state nears, the motivational force to complete <b>the</b> <b>goal</b> and objectives associated with it also increases.|$|R
5|$|Conroy {{followed}} {{in the footsteps of}} his father and two uncles in playing hockey at Clarkson University for the Golden Knights. He enrolled at Clarkson in 1990 and played four seasons for the school. During his junior season of 1992–93, Conroy scored two goals in a 5–3 victory over Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in the Eastern College Athletic Conference (ECAC) semi-final to help lead his team to the conference championship game. Conroy reached 100 career points with <b>the</b> <b>goals,</b> joining his father Mike as the only such pair in Clarkson's history to reach that milestone. Conroy and the Golden Knights then won the ECAC title with a 3–1 victory over Brown University.|$|E

The game's first demo build was released on February 7, 2011, and development continued until December 1, 2015, when the PMDT announced it would cease further development of Project M. The game has received positive comments from reviewers, amassed a player base of over 500,000, surpassed three million downloads, and been played in many professional tournaments.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} few months after the election, Modi made trips to a number of {{different}} countries to further <b>the</b> <b>goals</b> of his policy, and attended the BRICS, ASEAN, and G20 summits. One of Modi's first visits as prime minister was to Nepal, during which he promised a billion USD in aid. Modi also made several overtures to the United States, including multiple visits to that country. While this was described as an unexpected development, due to the US having previously denied Modi a travel visa over his role during the 2002 Gujarat riots, it was also expected to strengthen diplomatic and trade relations between the two countries.|$|E
