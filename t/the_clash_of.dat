He also published a number of short stories, children's books, and essay collections.|$|E

The title last changed hands at <b>the</b> <b>Clash</b> <b>of</b> the Champions XXVII event in 1994. The angle matched Sting against Flair, who was now the WCW World Heavyweight Champion, in a championship unification match as a way of eliminate the WCW International title. Flair was booked to win the match, unifying both championships and ending the existence of the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
5|$|By 1862, navies across Europe {{had adopted}} ironclads. Britain and France each had sixteen either {{completed}} or under construction, though the British vessels were larger. Austria, Italy, Russia, and Spain were also building ironclads. However, the first battles {{using the new}} ironclad ships involved neither Britain nor France, and involved ships markedly different from the broadside-firing, masted designs of Gloire and Warrior. The use of ironclads by {{both sides in the}} American Civil War, and <b>the</b> <b>clash</b> <b>of</b> the Italian and Austrian fleets at the Battle of Lissa, had an important influence on the development of ironclad design.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1990, Slayer {{proposed}} a major tour featuring American thrash metal bands. Megadeth accepted, joining Slayer, Testament, and Suicidal Tendencies {{for the successful}} European Clash of the Titans tour. An American leg began the following year featuring Megadeth, Slayer, and Anthrax, with Alice in Chains as a supporting act. The tour was considered a multi-headliner, as the three main bands alternated time slots. In addition to <b>the</b> <b>Clash</b> <b>of</b> the Titans tour, Megadeth played with Judas Priest in North America late in 1990 and appeared at the second Rock in Rio festival in January 1991.|$|E

5|$|In 1192, the Chronicle of Mann {{records that}} Ragnall {{and his sons}} were {{defeated}} in a particularly bloody battle against Áengus. The chronicle does not identify {{the location of the}} battle, or elaborate under what circumstances it was fought. However, {{it is possible that the}} conflict took place in the northern part of the meic Somairle domain, where some of Áengus' lands may have lain. Although the hostile contact between Ragnall and Áengus could have been result of Ragnall's rise in power at Dubgall's expense, <b>the</b> <b>clash</b> <b>of</b> 1192 may also mark Ragnall's downfall.|$|E
5|$|In a loose, {{unstructured}} modernist narrative {{style that}} draws from Christian allegory and oral storytelling, Faulkner explores themes of race, sex, class and {{religion in the}} American South. By focusing on characters that are misfits, outcasts, or are otherwise marginalized in their community, he portrays <b>the</b> <b>clash</b> <b>of</b> alienated individuals against a Puritanical, prejudiced rural society. Early reception of the novel was mixed, with some reviewers critical of Faulkner's style and subject matter. However, over time, the novel {{has come to be}} {{considered one of the most}} important literary works by Faulkner and one of the best English-language novels of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|On 11 September 1966, Cambodia {{held its}} first open election. Through {{manipulation}} and harassment (and to Sihanouk's surprise) the conservatives won 75 percent of {{the seats in the}} National Assembly. Lon Nol was chosen by the right as prime minister and, as his deputy, they named Prince Sirik Matak; an ultraconservative member of the Sisowath branch of the royal clan and long-time enemy of Sihanouk. In addition to these developments and <b>the</b> <b>clash</b> <b>of</b> interests among Phnom Penh's politicized elite, social tensions created a favorable environment for the growth of a domestic communist insurgency in the rural areas.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation (WWF)'s main {{competition}} in the professional wrestling industry was from Jim Crockett Promotions. McMahon countered Jim Crockett's successful Starrcade pay-per-view, which began airing in 1983, by creating the WrestleMania franchise. After WrestleMania III in March 1987, the most successful professional wrestling pay-per-view event in history, McMahon created the Survivor Series franchise, which aired {{the same day as}} Starrcade 1987 in November 1987. After defeating Crockett in the ratings war, McMahon created the Royal Rumble, an event airing for free on the USA Network in January 1988. The event set a ratings record for the network with eight million households tuning in to watch the event. In retaliation, Crockett created <b>the</b> <b>Clash</b> <b>of</b> the Champions event, which aired simultaneously with WrestleMania IV. WrestleMania IV garnered higher ratings, and not long after, Crockett filed for bankruptcy and sold his company to Ted Turner, who renamed it World Championship Wrestling (WCW).|$|E
5|$|The thin {{long legs}} of the {{hartebeest}} provide for a quick escape in an open habitat; if attacked, the formidable horns are used {{to ward off the}} predator. The elevated position of the eyes enables the hartebeest to inspect its surroundings continuously even as it is grazing. The muzzle has evolved so as to derive maximum nutrition from even a frugal diet. The horns are also used during fights among males for dominance in the breeding season; <b>the</b> <b>clash</b> <b>of</b> the horns is loud enough that it can be heard from hundreds of metres away. The beginning of a fight is marked with a series of head movements and stances, as well as depositing droppings on dung piles. The opponents drop onto their knees and, after giving a hammer-like blow, begin wrestling, their horns interlocking. One attempts to fling the head of the other to one side to stab the neck and shoulders with his horns. Fights are rarely serious, but can be fatal if they are.|$|E
