40|$|Many {{manufacturing}} processes use {{large amounts of}} energy {{in order to make}} useful products. One such process is the <b>thermal</b> stress <b>relief</b> (TSR) process that is widely used to reduce/modify the internal or residual stresses in parts that are introduced by other manufacturing procedures such as fabrication, machining, or assembly.

As an alternative to the TSR, Vibratory Stress Relief (VSR) has the advantages of low energy consumption and dramatic reduction of pollution to the environment.

Surface temperatures, temperatures in the bulk and under the surface were measured by conductive and thermographic methods and were correlated with investigations of the resulting metallographic structure.

40|$|During {{the summer}} of 2007 several Greek regions {{suffered}} periods of extreme heat, with midday temperatures of over 40 A degrees C on several consecutive days. High temperatures were also recorded {{on the east coast}} of central Greece, where a complex sea breeze circulation system frequently develops. The more intense events occurred at the end of June and July. The highest temperatures were observed on 26 June and 25 July, while the sea breeze developed only on 25 July. Meteorological data collected at two sites-a coastal urban location and an inland suburban site that is not reached by the sea breeze flow-as well as pollution data collected at the urban site, were analysed in order to investigate the relationship between sea breeze development and the prevailing environmental conditions during these two heat wave events. The analysis revealed that sea breeze development affects temperature and pollution levels at the shoreline significantly, causing a decrease of similar to 4 A degrees C from the maximum temperature value and an increase of similar to 30 % in peak PM 10 levels. Additionally, several stress indices were calculated in order to assess heat comfort conditions at the two sites.

Since the early 1990 s several partial solutions {{have been found}} but chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond deposition on steel substrate {{continues to be a}} persistent problem. The main drawbacks are the high carbon diffusion from gas phase into substrate, the transition metals on the material surface that catalyze sp 2 bond formation, instead of sp 3 bonds, and the high thermal expansion coefficient (TEC) mismatch between diamond and steels. An intermediate layer has been found necessary to increase diamond adhesion. Literature has proposed many efficient intermediate layers as a diffusion barrier for both, carbon and iron, but most intermediate layers shown have not solved TEC mismatch. In this review, we briefly discuss the solutions that exclusively work as diffusion barrier and discuss in a broader way the ones that also solve, or may potentially solve, the TEC mismatch problem. We examine some multilayers, the iron borides, the chromium carbides, and vanadium carbides. We go through the most relevant results of the last two and a half decades, including recent advances in our group.

40|$|To produce useful strengthening, {{precipitation}} hardenable {{aluminium alloys}} rely on rapid quenching from the {{solution heat treatment}} temperature to suppress the formation of coarse equilibrium second phases. An unavoidable consequence of the rapid quenching of thick sections is the severe thermal gradients that quickly develop in the material. The attendant inhomogeneous plastic flow can then result {{in the establishment of}} residual stresses. Established procedures exist to minimise residual stress by quenching into boiling water or organic quenchants at the expense of ageing response. Residual stresses can also be relieved after solution heat treatment by the application of plastic deformation in a controlled manner. A limited degree of <b>thermal</b> stress <b>relief</b> is also reported to occur during subsequent artificial ageing treatments, especially duplex ageing treatments. It is generally accepted that the size of the residual stresses induced during quenching cannot exceed the yield strength of the material. However, for precipitation hardened aluminium alloys, stress magnitudes as measured by standard techniques can exceed the uniaxial stress required to cause plastic flow during tensile tests conducted immediately after quenching. An investigation to explain these observations involving measuring as-quenched tensile properties and room temperature stress relief in heat treatable and non-heat treatable aluminium alloys has been conducted. Two alloys were investigated: 7010, an Al-Zn-Mg-Cu precipitation hardenable alloy and 5251, a non-heat treatable medium strength Al-Mg-Mn alloy. Tensile properties were determined by heat-treating test specimens at 475 °C, cold water quenching and then testing without delay to avoid significant microstructural modification. The progress of stress relief at room temperature was then monitored utilising test coupons and standard x-ray diffraction techniques. Natural ageing of 7010 leads to a rapid increase in strength and a subsequent locking in of residual stresses (this cannot occur in 5251) and the change in residual stress is monitored as a function of time. An attempt has also been made to determine the efficacy of x-ray diffraction to monitor thermally induced stress relief. X-ray diffraction and hole drilling techniques to ASTM E 837 were utilised to follow the progress of isothermal stress relief at room temperature and 200 °C in both 7010 and 5251.

Here, we investigated whether functional connectivity at rest between these brain regions {{is associated with}} individual and sex-related differences in <b>thermal</b> pain and <b>relief</b> responsiveness. Twenty healthy volunteers (ten females) were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging in resting conditions. Half an hour after scanning, we administered thermal pain on the back of their right hand and collected pain and relief ratings in two separate runs of twelve stimuli each. Across the whole group, mean pain ratings were associated with decreased connectivity at rest between brain regions belonging to the default mode and the visual resting-state network. In men, pain measures correlated with increased connectivity within the visual resting-state network. In women, in contrast, decreased connectivity between this network and parietal and prefrontal brain regions implicated in affective cognitive control were associated with both pain and relief ratings. Our findings indicate that the well documented individual variability and sex differences in pain sensitivity may be explained, at least in part, by network dynamics at rest in these brain regions. Functional connectivity at rest predicts individual and sex-related differences in pain ratings collected outside the scanner. Across the whole group, pain ratings are associated with decreased connectivity between brain regions belonging to the default mode and the visual resting-state network.

40|$|The world’s {{coral reefs}} provide {{valuable}} socio-economic services {{to millions of}} people and are host to a biodiverse array of marine life. Yet they face an uncertain future given increasingly heightened exposure to natural and anthropogenic disturbances, which can interact and / or occur at such high frequencies and intensities that coral reefs are unable to recover sufficiently between events to maintain a stable state dominated by hard-corals. The primary goal of current coral reef conservation strategies is to protect a reef’s capacity to recover following a disturbance or disturbances (i. e. resilience), and thus remain in a hardcoral dominated state. To do so effectively requires an understanding of not only of how reefs are affected by individual disturbances, but also how multiple disturbances can and will likely interact to produce unexpected ecological consequences (ecological surprises). It is well recognised that disturbances frequently interact synergistically to affect coral reefs more severely than would be expected simply from the sum of the individual events. However, recent work in the Caribbean found that tropical cyclones (TC) can also interact antagonistically with thermal stress, such that the latter affects reefs less severely than would otherwise be expected. The turbulent ocean mixing, disruption of large scale circulation patterns and heavy cloud coverage associated with TCs can alter the biophysical properties of reefs and their waters that control bleaching. During the 2005 thermal stress event in the Caribbean, TCs were shown to cool the sea surface enough to mitigate coral bleaching over a larger area than the likely span of wave damage that TCs typically generate. Given that sea surface temperature (SST) has been rising at unprecedented rates in many regions throughout the tropics, a key question to ask from a conservation perspective that has not yet been investigated is therefore: do many coral reefs stand to benefit from TCinduced cooling in an era of increasing thermal stress? This thesis addressed this question by demonstrating that: (1) TC cooling can lower SST sufficiently to either reduce thermal stress levels below meaningful thresholds or slow / prevent thermal stress build-up over a season (e. g., enough to benefit reefs) across broad regions as well as isolated areas; (2) A given TC can benefit (reduce and / or prevent the build-up of thermal stress) a greater area of reef than it harms (via physical damage from TC waves) to produce a ‘net cooling benefit’; (3) <b>Thermal</b> stress <b>relief</b> from TC cooling occurs frequently enough at some reefs to provide a meaningful, though intermittent, refuge from bleaching and the associated sub-lethal effects; and (4) The distribution and timing of such relief varies across the world’s reefs sufficiently such that it provides a basis upon which to rank reefs by conservation priority. As an initial step, a global analysis over the recent past (1985 - 2009) across the tropics (extended to 40 °N to 40 °S) found thermal stress (measured by degree heating weeks - DHW) to be negatively correlated to tropical cyclone activity (measured by frequency of high winds -TC gale days) at reef areas across the entire Caribbean (Chapter 2). While other regions did not show this effect over such a broad spatial (basinwide) and temporal (25 years) scale, increasing the resolution of the analysis yielded similar negative correlations in regions such as Japan, Western Australia and the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). To explore the potential for a TC to result in a ‘net cooling benefit’ a case study of severe TCs on Australia’s GBR showed that two out of four produced a net cooling benefit, even under the most severe conditions during which the extent of wave damage is maximised (Chapter 3). Thus, further effort to examine patterns of TC cooling at broader spatial and temporal scales was justified. To that end, a case study in the Caribbean of two extreme seasons, where both thermal stress and TC activity was high, demonstrated that beneficial cooling can occur across broad regions and that the absence of this cooling would have likely resulted in thermal stress of greater severity and duration (Chapter 4). Thermal stress levels were examined in reef areas and, for each season, thermal stress intensity (hotspots) and duration (DHW) was notably lower in areas where accumulated seasonal TC cooling was at least 1 °C. This confirmed the findings of the initial global assessment, which used a TC’s footprint (composite of gale radii) as a proxy for cooling, and showed that a global analysis using actual SST data to reconstruct cool wakes is indeed warranted. Finally, an examination of TC cooling over the same 25 year period as the initial analysis revealed a number of reef regions where cooling likely played a role in reducing the severity and duration of past thermal stress events (Chapter 5). Based on the spatial and temporal patterns of TC-induced cooling, it is clear that some reefs experience beneficial cooling more often than others, providing a basis for differentiating between reefs to target conservation priorities. This thesis provides the first evidence that TC-induced wake zones may provide refuge from thermal stress to coral reefs over broad spatial and temporal scales, which can ultimately contribute to the overall resilience of coral communities in an era of climate change. The methodology and results presented here {{can be used as a}} basis for incorporating the dynamics of TC-induced <b>thermal</b> stress <b>relief</b> into coral reef conservation planning. To that end, it is recommended that future efforts examine these dynamics at finer spatial and temporal scales...|$|R

Mezi tyto faktory řadíme teplotu okolní atmosféry, teplotu okolních zdrojů radiace, koeficienty emisivity, reflexe a transmise. Na základě této rovnice sestrojíme program v prostředí MATLAB, ve kterém graficky vykreslíme výsledný teplotní reliéf simulovaného tělesa a vliv jednotlivých parametrů v ní vystupujících. V práci se nejprve seznámíme s infračerveným zářením, jeho typy a vlastnostmi. Pomocí jednotlivých vyzařovacích zákonů a rušivých elementů infračerveného záření bude sestaven vzorec, který zahrnuje jednotlivé rušivé elementy při snímání povrchového teplotního reliéfu. Tento vzorec umožní vypočítat povrchový teplotní reliéf snímané scény a vypočíst výsledné teploty bez vlivu nežádoucích parametrů. Poté sestrojíme program, který bude na základě rovnice termografie vyobrazovat jednotlivé termogramy. Termogram se bude měnit v závislosti na změnách parametrů v rovnici termografie. Změna bude vyjádřena změnou teplot ve snímané scéně a posunem barevného spektra (termografické stupnice). Tento program bude graficky reprezentovat změny veličin ovlivňujících výsledné teplotní rozložení ve scéně a umožní lepší pochopení vlivu a funkce jednotlivých veličin v termografické rovnici. The {{topic of}} my thesis is the {{analysis}} of parameters of the infrared imaging {{and the use of}} radiation laws for the formation of a thermographic equation, which will include the impact of surrounding factors on the resulting temperature relief of the scanned object. These factors include the temperature of the surrounding atmosphere, temperature of the surrounding radiation sources, emissivity coefficients, reflection and transmission. On the basis of this equation a programme will be created in the MATLAB environment where the resulting temperature relief of the simulated object and the impact of the particular parameters from the equation will be graphically depicted. In the thesis we will first of all introduce the infrared radiation, its types and features. With the help of the particular radiation laws and distracting elements of the infrared radiation a formula including the distracting elements appearing during scanning of the <b>thermal</b> surface <b>relief</b> will be formed. This formula will enable us to count the surface temperature of the scanned scene and to determine the final temperature without the impact of the unwanted parameters. Furthermore, a programme which will image thermograms {{on the basis of the}} thermography equation will be designed. The thermogram will change in dependance on the changes of the parameters in the thermography equation. The change will be expressed by the change of temperatures in the scanned scene and by the shift in the colour spectrum (thermographic scale). This programme will graphically present the changes of the quantities influencing the resulting temperature division in the scene and will provide a better grasp of the influence and the function of particular quantities in the thermographic equation. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The use of plasma sprayed ceramic coats as thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) {{for the protection of}} metallic structures and equipment from severe thermal, abrasive and corrosive conditions has been documented extensively in the last two decades. The state-of-the-art TBCs consist of a double layer coat. a top ceramic layer and an intermediate bond coat (MCrAIY, M=Ni, Co, Fe) deposited on the alloy substrate. Zirconia, both stabilized and partially stabilized with different oxides has been used as the ceramic top coat due to its low thermal conductivity and low thermal expansion coefficient. Studies of the microstructure of the TBCs have shown aspects that can help the understanding of the properties of the coating. The ternary system ZrOz-Y 203 -TiCz is believed to offer improved properties when it is compared to Zr 02 -Y 203. However, the use of & 02 -Y 203 -Ti 02 as TBCs, a major part of this work, is not widely reported in the literature. The purpose of this thesis was to study the microstructure of a plasma sprayed ZrOrY 203 -TiO 2 TBC using X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS), and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The evolution of the Zr 41 _phase distribution in the ceramic coat was followed by XRD after different heat treatments, with the finding that the cooling rate plays a decisive role in the final Zr 42 phase composition. SEM studies allowed a description of the lamellae structure of the Zr 02 -Y 203 -TiOz coating. The evolution of the morphology, porosity and crack distribution in the coat after different thermal treatments were followed by SEM. Evidence of incipient sintering is observed in Zr 02 -Y 203 -Ti 02 coats heated at temperatures higher than 1200 °C. This should lead to poor coating performance. EDS analysis revealed an heterogeneous distribution of titanium through the oating. A detailed microstructural characterization of the as-sprayed coating was done using TEM. Microstructural features such as micro-twins, antiphase-boundaries and mottled morphology associated with "non-transformable" tetragonal ZrO 2 phase were identified. It is believed that these microstructural elements promote toughening and <b>thermal</b> stress <b>relief</b> mechanisms that provide the coating with the erosion and thermal shock resistance required for a TBC. The presence of TiO 2 is linked to a higher proportion of tetragonal ZrO 2 in the Zr 02 -Y 203 -Ti 02 coating, therefore improved properties of the coating are expected. The addition of TiO 2 promotes grain growth and decreases the final density in pressed and sintered Zr 02 -Y 203 -TiO 2 powders. The results obtained are a contribution {{to the understanding of the}} microstructure of TBCs and to the sparse knowledge base of the ZrOrY 2 O 3 -TiO 2 coatings. Further work should be done in the characterization of the ZrO 2 -Y 2 O 3 -Ti 42 coatings and the study of its stability under different conditions in order to determine the real potential of this material offers as an alternative to the better known ZrOrY 203 TBC.

40|$|Subduction of the oceanic plate {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the various processes in subduction zones, including arc magmatism and generation of earthquakes. Thus the nature of the incoming plate, such as its <b>relief,</b> <b>thermal</b> state, lithology, and the water content, are considered to shape these subduction zone processes. In 2014 and 2015, to reveal the nature of the incoming plate in the ocean-ward area of the 2011 M 9 Tohoku earthquake, we conducted wide-angle seismic surveys in the trench-outer rise region of the Japan Trench. We designed a 600 km long seismic survey line perpendicular to the trench axis and deployed 88 OBSs at intervals of 6 km and shot a tuned airgun array of R/V Kairei. We have applied a traveltime inversion to model the P-wave velocity (Vp) structure. The resulting Vp model shows that Vp within the oceanic crust and the topmost mantle decreases in the vicinity of the trench axis probably due to the plate bending. In addition, we observed low Vp at the top of the oceanic crust in the area of petit spot volcanos. The low Vp area may be related to magma intrusions because we observed several structural interfaces in the shallow area. We found two structural features that we did not anticipate. First, crustal thickness abruptly changes at around the center of our survey line (300 -km east from the trench axis); crust thickness is 7 -km in the west and 6 -km in the east. Second, mantle Vp shows significant variations along the survey line, 7. 5 km/s in the bend-fault area (western area), 8. 0 km/s around the center, 8. 5 km/s in the eastern area. Based on the shear wave splitting observed in our data set, we infer that high mantle Vp in the eastern area is related with the changes in the orientation of the mantle anisotropy. Since we do not see any remarkable topographic features indicating the off-ridge activities, we consider that these observed structural features are related with the activities near the ancient spreading ridge when the oceanic plate formed, indicating that the oceanic plate in the NW Pacific margin, the input to the northeastern Japanese island arc, is more complicated here than we previously thought. In this presentation, we will show an overview of the Vp model along the whole profile and detailed seismic structure beneath the petit-spot area derived by the P-to-S converted waves...|$|R
