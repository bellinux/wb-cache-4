50|$|Items {{will appear}} if Kantaro uses his {{firework}} grenades in certain locations. Koban coins {{can be found}} throughout each map, and 2 coins {{can be used to}} create bridges <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>over</b> <b>rivers</b> (2 coins are always hidden around each river area), 6 coins can pay the passage fee at the checkpoints if the player does not have a passport, and 10 coins can open a secret passageway into other levels (see #Secrets). The kanzashi item does not appear in the original Family Computer version (Otami will go away if Kantaro has 4 coins), but in other installments, it prevents Otami from following Kantaro around. The O-fuda (Japanese amulet) item will protect Kantaro from the ghost character, and the katana will do the same against the thief. The onigiri (rice ball) item will transform Kantaro into a rolling ball, making him invincible {{for a short period of}} time unless he falls into a pit. The geta (sandal) item allows Kantaro to stand on top of clouds.|$|R
50|$|Victor Bodson lived {{close to}} the river Sauer, which acts as the border between Luxemburg and Germany. Victor Bodson helped create and operate an escape route for Jews during World War II. The route {{required}} fleeing Jews <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>over</b> the <b>river</b> Sauer before meeting up with Victor Bodson at his house in Steinheim. Here using a special apparatus in his car, he would ferry these people to a safe haven that had been prepared in advance by his friends.|$|R
50|$|The {{tower of}} Jug Bogdan, {{which was an}} outpost, is in best shape out of all remains. It's located on Toplica riverbank. Presumably, it served <b>to</b> control <b>crossing</b> <b>over</b> the <b>river,</b> but also to ensure water-supply to the fortress. Jug Bogdan {{is the name of}} a Serb voivode Vratko Nemanjić in Serbian epic poetry.|$|R

50|$|A {{number of}} level {{crossings}} with the North Eastern Railway's Victoria Dock Branch Line {{and the line}} westwards out of Hull Paragon station caused delays to the trams. The crossings required catch points for the trams and interlocking with the railway signalling system. In 1925, the Corporation, Ministry of Transport and the NER's successor the London and North Eastern Railway proposed to eliminate the level crossings {{at a cost of}} £1¼ million, but no work was done until the 1960s. The last improvement to infrastructure came in 1931 with the building of the North Bridge in the town centre allowing trams <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>over</b> the <b>River</b> Hull avoiding the narrow Drypool bridge.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{two main}} {{hypotheses}} for {{the origins of the}} county name [...] "Clare". One hypothesis is that the name is derived from Thomas de Clare who was deeply embroiled in local politics and fighting in the 1270s and 1280s. An alternative hypothesis is that the county name Clare comes from the settlement of Clare (now Clarecastle) whose Irish name [...] (plank bridge) refers <b>to</b> a <b>crossing</b> <b>over</b> the <b>River</b> Fergus.|$|R

Near the midpoint of the water body, NY10 <b>crosses</b> <b>over</b> the reservoir on the Cannonsville Bridge and proceeds to follow the northern edge of the reservoir.

The plan was not perfectly executed because multiple units of Batu's force crossed the bridge prematurely for military exploits.|$|R
500|$|Past the Outer Drive interchange, I-96 splits into a local-express lanes configuration. There are two carriageways in each direction, and {{the central}} ones have three lanes that bypass {{almost all of the}} exits while the outer ones have two lanes that have access to each exit. The Jeffries turns southeasterly and {{separates}} from Schoolcraft Road shifting [...] to the south. The interchange with M-39 (Southfield Freeway) features slip ramps so that traffic can pass between the local and express lanes. Further east, I-96 turns northeasterly <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> Grand River Avenue {{at the southern end of}} M-5.

25|$|Alleyways {{leading down}} to the Thames became the only {{practical}} way <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>over</b> the <b>river</b> via boat as Old London Bridge was frequently blocked. Wharves and latter rudimentary docks began {{to be used to}} offload goods but most ships simply moored in lines {{in the middle of the}} river and their cargo was rowed to shore and carried up shoreline stairs. Some of the Thames original shoreline did remain free from the construction of houses or walls. The access to the river was via, shore, gaps between houses used to launch boats. Samuel Pepys in his diaries of 1665 mentions making landfall at Dukes Shore for example before wading up the beach to Narrow Street. As late as the 1850s nearly all new bridges were built with stairs at both ends, and generally on both sides.|$|R
50|$|SR 178 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US 1/SR 4 (South State Street) in Lyons, in Toombs County. It heads southeast through rural areas until it intersects SR 56, west of Reidsville.

Just prior <b>to</b> <b>crossing</b> <b>over</b> the Ohoopee <b>River,</b> SR 178 curves {{to the east and}} continues in that orientation until it meets its eastern terminus, an intersection with SR 121/SR 144/SR 169 southwest of Glennville.|$|R

Baker's company was sent to San Felipe to guard it, and Houston's army crossed the Brazos above San Felipe at Groce's (Ferry). My company crossed the Brazos at San Felipe and threw up some little fortifications. After the Mexicans crossed the Colorado river General Houston ordered us <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>over</b> the <b>river</b> and burn San Felipe.

On {{the opposite side of the}} river in the Bronx community of University Heights, NY 9X became Fordham Road and continued on an easterly track to a junction with Sedgwick Avenue.

The North Korean-Chinese border for 20 miles east of the mountain is [...] "dry, remote and mountainous, barely patrolled," [...] {{making it one of the}} crossing areas for refugees from North Korea into China, although most, including refugees from Ryanggang itself, prefer <b>to</b> <b>cross</b> <b>over</b> the Tumen <b>River.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cavan {{was founded}} by the King of East Breifne, Giolla Íosa Ruadh O’Reilly, {{sometime}} during his lordship between 1300 and his death in 1330. During his lordship, a Franciscan friary was established close to the O’Reilly stronghold at Tullymongan and was at {{the centre of the}} settlement close <b>to</b> a <b>crossing</b> <b>over</b> the <b>river</b> and <b>to</b> the town’s marketplace. The friary’s location is marked by an eighteenth-century tower in the graveyard at Abbey Street which appears to incorporate remains of the original medieval friary tower. The imprint of the medieval town can be followed in the area of Abbey Street, Bridge Street and Main Street (townlands of Tullymongan Upper and Lower).|$|R

50|$|The {{evolution}} of the bridges across the Harlem River reflects its use as an urban transit corridor, while a few also conjure its fleeting pastoral reputation. Far more tame than the East or Hudson Rivers, the Harlem was not as daunting an obstruction as other rivers. It did not require bridges like the Brooklyn or George Washington that were marvels of long-span engineering. The river required those engineering feats of industrial practicality that would allow for large amounts of vehicles, people, and goods <b>to</b> efficiently <b>cross</b> <b>over</b> the <b>river</b> and on it. Truly urban in their response to the land they occupy, the Harlem River bridges each reflect the metropolis’ ambitions and needs of their time.|$|R
