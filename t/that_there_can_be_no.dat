Dubowski (1921) {{lays down}} the {{principle}} <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> {{delegation of authority}} to an absolute body from which no right of appeal exists. In this case, a licensing committee exercising statutory powers to license cinemas {{to be used for}} film screenings had imposed a condition in a licence that films had to be certified by the British Board of Film Censors before they could be shown. This was found to be ultra vires because the Board should not be made the final dictator. Furthermore, the fact that the Board had been given absolute power to prohibit films for reasons which might be private or influenced by trade considerations was sufficient to render the condition ultra vires.|$|E
5|$|Philosopher Taede Smedes {{argued that}} {{religious}} language is symbolic. Denying any conflict {{between science and}} religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept a conviction (that God exists, {{in the context of}} Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe things that we do not know for sure. Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> common standard to which both God and the world can be compared. He argues that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently). Smedes claims {{that there should be no}} reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God pro nobis (for us) and not in se (as such) or sine nobis (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.|$|E

25|$|Some mythicists hold—in terms {{given by}} Robert M. Price—the Jesus agnosticism viewpoint, while others go further {{and hold the}} Jesus atheism viewpoint.

Others have said that Jesus may have lived far earlier, in a dimly remembered remote past. A number of writers adduce various arguments to show that Christianity has syncretistic or mythical roots. As such, the historical Jesus should not be regarded as the founder of the religion, even if he did exist.|$|E
25|$|The {{doctrines of}} papal primacy and papal {{supremacy}} {{are perhaps the}} greatest obstacles to ecumenical efforts between the Roman Catholic Church and the other Christian churches. Most Eastern Orthodox Christians, for example, would be quite willing to accord the Bishop of Rome the same respect, deference and authority as is accorded to any Eastern Orthodox patriarch, but resist granting him special authority over all Christians. Many Protestants are quite willing to grant the pope a position of special moral leadership, but feel that according any more formal authority to the pope than that would conflict with the Protestant principle of solus Christus, i.e., <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> intermediaries between a Christian and God except for Christ.|$|E

25|$|Another {{equivalent}} {{form of the}} theorem is that, in any infinite set S of graphs, {{there must}} be a pair of graphs one of which is a minor of the other. The statement that every infinite set has finitely many minimal elements implies this form of the theorem, for if there are only finitely many minimal elements, then each of the remaining graphs must belong to a pair of this type with one of the minimal elements. And in the other direction, this form of the theorem implies the statement <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> infinite antichains, because an infinite antichain is a set that does not contain any pair related by the minor relation.|$|E

However, there are some heuristics {{that can be used in}} an automated fashion to attempt to construct a proof, which succeed frequently on typical programs. This field of research is known as automated termination analysis.|$|E

25|$|In 1996, 11 {{selected}} Sri Lankan {{women were}} ordained fully as Theravada bhikkhunis {{by a team}} of Theravāda monks in concert with a team of Korean nuns in India. There is disagreement among Theravāda vinaya authorities as to whether such ordinations are valid. The Dambulla chapter of the Siam Nikaya in Sri Lanka also carried out a nun's ordination at this time, specifically stating their ordination process was a valid Theravadin process where the other ordination session was not. This chapter has carried out ordination ceremonies for hundreds of nuns since then. This has been criticized by leading figures in the Siam Nikaya and Amarapura Nikaya, and the governing council of Buddhism in Myanmar has declared <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> valid ordination of nuns in modern times, though some Burmese monks disagree with this.|$|E
25|$|Hauerwas {{finds the}} {{language}} of “rights” to be disturbing as it assumes that people relate to others as strangers, and lends even {{the understanding of the}} family to that of a contractual society. He argues that being part of a family, however, is not a voluntary undertaking. As such, when one is part of a family, the kinds of responsibilities each member holds are in relation to each other. Hauerwas finds that as a parent, you have a duty to your children, not just because you brought them into existence, but because the role of parent is to ensure the children are brought up {{in a way that is}} conducive to the community’s values. Thus, the issue with “rights” language is that it attempts to prevent maltreatment of individuals to the point of exclusion of familial and communal responsibility. Hauerwas’s bottom line is <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> real society if its members only relate in terms of noninterference. The language of rights destroys society because we regard people as strangers instead of assuming the responsibility towards them as family and members of the community that we share.|$|E
25|$|Islam is monotheistic {{and insists}} <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> intercessors between an {{individual}} and God. Nevertheless, Sudanese Islam includes a belief in spirits as sources of illness or other afflictions and in magical {{ways of dealing with}} them. The imam of a mosque is a prayer leader and preacher of sermons. He may also be a teacher and in smaller communities combines both functions. In the latter role, he is called a faqih (pl., fuqaha), although a faqih need not be an imam. In addition to teaching in the local Qur'anic school (khalwa), the faqih is expected to write texts (from the Qur'an) or magical verses to be used as amulets and cures. His blessing may be asked at births, marriages, deaths, and other important occasions, and he may participate in wholly non-Islamic harvest rites in some remote places. All of these functions and capacities make the faqih the most important figure in popular Islam. But he is not a priest. His religious authority is based on his putative knowledge of the Qur'an, the sharia, and techniques for dealing with occult threats to health and well- being. The notion that the words of the Qur'an will protect against the actions of evil spirits or the evil eye is deeply embedded in popular Islam, and the amulets prepared by the faqih are intended to protect their wearers against these dangers.|$|E
