It didn't quite reach the high watermark of last week's instalment, {{but there was still}} a lot of great stuff here." [...] Steve Johnson of The Baltimore Sun noted, [...] "Instead of the heavy action of the season's first two hours, Sunday's Game of Thrones, called [...] "Oathbreaker," [...] was more about putting pieces on the chess board into place." [...] Sarah Larson of The New Yorker wrote in her review, [...] "Last week, we saw Jon Snow reënter life; <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> <b>we</b> may have been in proximity to him entering it, the first time, in the usual way." [...] Tim Surette of TV.com called the episode, [...] "Exhilarating".|$|E
500|$|Braeden's {{biography}} at Yahoo! {{notes that}} upon his casting as the ruthless businessman Victor, he [...] "clicked {{with both the}} audience and the creative powers, and {{has been one of}} the series leading men for close to two decades". Kim Muraro of LimeLife stated that instead of his originally planned three-month stay at the series, he [...] "has become one of the most iconic characters in daytime TV". Garrett, writing from Canyon News, wrote: [...] " [...] plays the mastermind mogul with real gusto. His innate acting skills are as legendary as his distinguished career. <b>This</b> <b>week,</b> <b>we</b> saw Braeden play ruthless, conniving and ultimately a loving father." [...] Good News Weekly wrote: [...] "There are some men that are larger than life. There are some men that transcend the TV screen. There are some men that touch the lives of millions of viewers. Victor Newman is one of those men." [...] In 2005, Lynette Rice of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Braeden has transformed the character into a [...] "global phenom". BuddyTV noted the storyline where Victor locked his wife Julia's lover in a bomb shelter as [...] "the turning point" [...] in the character's life, making him a villain.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} generally positive reviews from television critics, mostly complimenting Davies's performance as Daniel. Chris Carabott of IGN commented {{that if this}} is the last appearance of Davies on Lost, which he [...] "somehow" [...] doubts, then, [...] "I'm glad he had the opportunity to leave on such a strong note. He delivers in some really great, emotional, moments this week – especially in the scenes in which he is suffering from memory deterioration. I've become a huge fan of Davies {{over the course of the}} last couple of years thanks to his performance on this show." [...] Rachel Dovey of Paste said the episode revealed [...] "a whole different" [...] side of Daniel: [...] "We've oscillated before about the true nature of the physicist, whether it's good or evil [...] We decided he's mostly a decent guy, barring the whole experimenting-on-his-girlfriend-then-running-away-when-her-brain-turned-to-mush thing. In the past, he's just seemed lost and confused, and, since he has those big, earnest puppy eyes, we decided to forgive him. But 'The Variable' showed us the dynamic at the heart of Daniel's stuttering vulnerability. Like all broken superheroes and Freudian beings, the man has mommy issues. <b>This</b> <b>week</b> <b>we</b> dove inside the dynamic between Daniel and his mother growing up." ...|$|E

500|$|Many critics praised Davies’s {{performance}} and appearance. Tom Iacuzio of The Daytona Beach News-Journal deemed Jeremy Davies's performance deserving of a Primetime Emmy Award. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger claimed Davies's performance to be [...] "outstanding" [...] [...] Jay Glatfelter of The Huffington Post said that Daniel [...] "more and more {{becoming one of}} [...] favorite characters". Chris Carabott wrote that Davies presents Faraday's awkward mannerisms well. In a later review, Carabott commented, [...] "I've become {{a huge fan of}} Davies {{over the course of the}} last couple of years thanks to his performance on this show." [...] Rachel Dovey of Paste said [...] "The Variable" [...] revealed [...] "a whole different" [...] side of Daniel: [...] "We've oscillated before about the true nature of the physicist, whether it's good or evil [...] We decided he's mostly a decent guy, barring the whole experimenting-on-his-girlfriend-then-running-away-when-her-brain-turned-to-mush thing.

500|$|... "I Am the Walrus" [...] was {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} reviews from critics. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a positive review. In his review for the episode, he opined: [...] "The episode itself didn't disappoint either, as [...] this was a quality half-hour of jokes. Kaiser praised the argument between Stan and Steve, calling it a [...] "superb sequence". Concluding his review, Kaiser went on to write, [...] "Despite all the absurdity, the episode even manages to successfully come around to an emotional resolution when Stan, realizing that Steve is an utter failure at attempted mating, resolves to see Steve as a son instead of potential masculine competition. Then [...] there's a rape joke. But, it being American Dad, it's actually a surprisingly funny rape joke." [...] He went on to give the episode an [...] "A-", scoring higher than The Simpsons episode [...] "Love Is a Many Strangled Thing", but scoring lower than Bob's Burgers episode [...] "Spaghetti Western and Meatballs". Jason Hughes of TV Squad also reacted positively, writing, [...] "It was good to have American Dad back in the lineup. Roger was in fine form, and I can at least appreciate that they're {{trying to figure out}} how to make Hayley and Jeff work in the family dynamic. They never quite got there with Hayley alone, so maybe things will work better this way." [...] However, he was more critical on the sub-plot. In his review for the episode, Hughes opined: [...] "The B-story left me wanting. The writers are still trying to figure out the new dynamic of having Hayley married and Jeff living in the house with the Smiths. The whole thing has been barely addressed, and <b>this</b> <b>week</b> <b>we</b> got a fairly weak exploration of them having fairly standard marital problems." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{show was}} {{intended}} to air every fifth week in the same slot as The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries, but was scheduled sporadically throughout the season, leading to inconsistent ratings.

6000|$|... {{where we}} arrived at about half past nine. We put up at the Black Swan, with which we had already made {{acquaintance}} at our previous visit to York. It is a very ancient hotel; for in the coffee-room I saw on the wall an old printed advertisement, announcing that a stage-coach would leave the Black Swan in London, and arrive at the Black Swan in York, with God's permission, in four days. The date was 1706; and still, after {{a hundred and fifty}} years, the Black Swan receives travellers in Coney Street. It is a very good hotel, and was much thronged with guests when we arrived, as the Sessions come on <b>this</b> <b>week.</b> <b>We</b> found a very smart waiter, whose English faculties have been brightened by a residence of several years in America.|$|E

I still have a home {{and as long as}} I live she shall enjoy it as a matter of right; at least until she recovers what she has lost.

6000|$|... "I {{have not}} thought yet," [...] Geoffrey replied. [...] "I should say, though, our best {{plan would be}} to make our way back {{as quickly as we}} can by Burnham and Maldon round to Hedingham. The earl was going up to London one day <b>this</b> <b>week,</b> <b>we</b> may catch him before he starts; if not, we must, of course, follow him. But at any rate it is best to go home, for they will be in a terrible fright, {{especially}} if Joe Chambers or one of the men take the news to Bricklesey of the loss of the Susan, for it would be quickly carried up to Hedingham by John Lirriper or one or other of the boatmen. No day seems to be fixed, and the queen may not be going to Windsor for some little time, so the loss of a day will not make any difference. As we have money in our pockets we can hire horse at Burnham to take us to Maldon, and get others there to carry us home." ...|$|E
