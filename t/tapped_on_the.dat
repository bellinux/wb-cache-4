25|$|Fresh oysters must {{be alive}} just before {{consumption}} or cooking. There {{is only one}} criterion: the oyster must be capable of tightly closing its shell. Open oysters should be <b>tapped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shell; a live oyster will close up and is safe to eat. Oysters which are open and unresponsive are dead and must be discarded. Some dead oysters, or oyster shells which are full of sand may be closed. These make a distinctive noise when tapped, and are known as 'clackers'.|$|E
25|$|Capillary tubes {{may also}} be used. A small sample of {{bacteria}} is collected {{on the end of}} the capillary tube, without blocking the tube, to avoid false negative results. The opposite end is then dipped into hydrogen peroxide, which is drawn into the tube through capillary action, and turned upside down, so that the bacterial points downwards. The hand holding the tube is then <b>tapped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> bench, moving the hydrogen peroxide down until it touches the bacteria. If bubbles form on contact, this indicates a positive catalase result. This test can detect catalase-positive bacteria at concentrations above about 105 cells/mL, and is simple to use.|$|E
25|$|Oxford: Prior to {{admission}} to the degree, the graduand will normally wear either the undergraduate commoner's or scholar's gown (if being admitted to the BA), or the graduate student's gown or the gown and hood of their previous Oxford/external university degree (if being admitted to a higher degree). After being formally admitted during the ceremony, they exit the Theatre and assume the gowns and hoods of their new degrees {{and then return to}} the Theatre in their new gowns and hoods. For certain degrees such as the higher doctorates and MAs, if they profess the Christian faith, the graduand may (if they wish) kneel in front of the (Vice-)Chancellor and be admitted in 'the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit' whilst being <b>tapped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head with the Bible.|$|E

500|$|By Louis's reign, Bastille {{prisoners were}} {{detained}} using a [...] "lettre de cachet", [...] "a letter under royal seal", {{issued by the}} king and countersigned by a minister, ordering a named person to be held. Louis, closely involved in this aspect of government, personally decided who should be imprisoned at the Bastille. The arrest itself involved an element of ceremony: the individual would be <b>tapped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> shoulder with a white baton and formally detained {{in the name of}} the king. Detention in the Bastille was typically ordered for an indefinite period and there was considerable secrecy over who had been detained and why: the legend of the [...] "Man in the Iron Mask", a mysterious prisoner who finally died in 1703, symbolises this period of the Bastille. Although in practice many were held at the Bastille as a form of punishment, legally a prisoner in the Bastille was only being detained for preventative or investigative reasons: the prison was not officially supposed to be a punitive measure in its own right. The average length of imprisonment in the Bastille under Louis XIV was approximately three years.|$|E

The hobgoblin {{is supposed to have}} added an extra line to the clock face so that [...] "XII" [...] became [...] "XIII".|$|E
2500|$|On 22 August {{the eighth}} {{borehole}} broke through {{at a depth}} of , at a ramp near the shelter where the miners had taken refuge. For days the miners had heard drills approaching and had prepared notes, which they attached to the tip of the drill with insulation tape when it poked into their space. They also <b>tapped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> drill before it was withdrawn, and these taps could be heard on the surface. When the drill was withdrawn a note was attached to it: [...] (English: [...] "We are well in the refuge the 33"). The words became the motto of the miners' survival and the rescue effort, and appeared on websites, banners and T-shirts.|$|E

2500|$|Though the Roma are {{primarily}} {{known as the}} performers of Hungarian styles like verbunkos, {{they have their own}} form of folk music that is largely without instrumentation, in spite of their reputation in that field outside of the Roma community. Roma music tends to take on characteristics of whatever music the people are around, however, embellished with [...] "twists and turns, trills and runs", making a very new, and distinctively Roma style. Though without instruments, Roma folk musicians use sticks, <b>tapped</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground, rhythmic grunts and a technique called oral-bassing which vocally imitates the sound of instruments. Some modern Roma musicians, like Ando Drom, Romano Drom, Romani Rota and Kalyi Jag have added modern instruments like guitars to the Roma style, while Gyula Babos' Project Romani has used elements of avant-garde jazz.|$|E
