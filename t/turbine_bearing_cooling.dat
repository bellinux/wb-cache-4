50|$|Turbojets supply {{bleed air}} from the {{compressor}} to the aircraft for the environmental control system, anti-icing, and fuel tank pressurization, for example. The engine itself needs air at various pressures and flow rates to keep it running. This air comes from the compressor, and without it, the turbines would overheat, the lubricating oil would leak from the bearing cavities, the rotor thrust bearings would skid or be overloaded, and ice would form on the nose cone. The {{air from the}} compressor, called secondary air, is used for <b>turbine</b> <b>cooling,</b> <b>bearing</b> cavity sealing, anti-icing, and ensuring that the rotor axial load on its thrust bearing will not wear it out prematurely. Supplying bleed air to the aircraft decreases {{the efficiency of the}} engine because it has been compressed, but then does not contribute to producing thrust. Bleed air for aircraft services is no longer needed on the turbofan-powered Boeing 787.|$|R
40|$|A {{medium scale}} {{hydrogen}} liquefaction plant is presented and its efficiency analyzed {{on the basis}} of exergy. In a first step, the operating principal of a medium scale hydrogen liquefier is presented. The liquefaction plant consists of a compressor system and a vacuum insulated cold box where the liquefaction takes place. In the cold box, the refrigeration capacity required to liquefy the hydrogen is provided by a hydrogen refrigerant cycle and a liquid nitrogen pre-cooling step. The cooling capacity is extracted from high pressure hydrogen through oil <b>bearing</b> <b>turbines</b> and <b>cooling</b> takes place in aluminum plate fin heat exchangers. Secondly, an extensive exergy analysis of the liquefaction process considering the exergy losses of each step will be presented. The exergy losses in hydrogen liquefaction are caused within the liquefier itself, for example in the compressor system or the turbines, but also occur during filling procedure of the liquid hydrogen in trailers, or distribution of the liquefied hydrogen. Within this paper the efficiency of the liquefaction process from gaseous hydrogen supply to the delivery of liquid hydrogen into the storage tank will be discussed...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} {{accurately}} identify a bearing fault on a wind turbine, a novel fault diagnosis method based on stochastic subspace identification (SSI) and multi-kernel {{support vector machine}} (MSVM) is proposed. First, the collected vibration signal of the wind <b>turbine</b> <b>bearing</b> is processed by the SSI method to extract fault feature vectors.

Finally, fault feature vectors which indicate {{the condition of the}} wind <b>turbine</b> <b>bearing</b> are inputted to the MSVM for fault pattern recognition. The results indicate that the SSI-MSVM method is effective in fault diagnosis for a wind <b>turbine</b> <b>bearing</b> and can successfully identify fault types of bearing and achieve higher diagnostic accuracy than that of K-means clustering, fuzzy means clustering and traditional SVM.|$|R
40|$|Offshore wind {{turbines}} often involve important engineering challenges {{such as the}} improvement of hydrogen embrittlement resistance of the <b>turbine</b> <b>bearings.</b> These elements frequently suffer the so-called phenomenon of hydrogen-assisted rolling-contact fatigue (HA-RCF) {{as a consequence of}} the synergic action of the surrounding harsh environment (the lubricant) supplying hydrogen to the material and the cyclic multiaxial stress state caused by in-service mechanical loading. Thus the complex phenomenon could be classified as hydrogen-assisted rolling-contact multiaxial fatigue (HA-RC-MF). This paper analyses, from the mechanical and the chemical points of view, the so-called ball-on-rod test, widely used to evaluate the hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility of <b>turbine</b> <b>bearings.</b> Both the stress-strain states and the steady-state hydrogen concentration distribution are studied, so that a better elucidation can be obtained of the potential fracture places where the hydrogen could be more harmful and, consequently, where the <b>turbine</b> <b>bearings</b> could fail during their life in service...|$|R

Attempts are being made to increase efficiency of bearing support. Such attempts are caused by the modern tendency of the development of engineering striving for compact machines and units possessing increased reliability and durability. Researches on finding discrepancies in operation of support for this purpose have been executed. The reasons of occurrence the fatigue crumbling on external bearing races at different stages development of working surface damage have been investigated. The basic constructions of support of shaft for the aviation gas turbine engine and methods of their lubrication have been considered. Shortcomings of existing methods of lubrication of bearing supports have been marked. The upgraded construction of the module of gas <b>turbine</b> <b>bearing</b> shaft, which allows to improve conditions of lubrication and <b>bearing</b> <b>cooling</b> {{as a result of a}} uniform oil feed to the contact zones of outside bearing race and rolling elements and forced oil removal from contact zones of inside bearing race and rolling elements has been suggested.

40|$|Premature wind <b>turbine</b> gearbox <b>bearing</b> {{failures}} {{in the form of}} white structure flaking (WSF) can occur in as little as 6 – 24 months of operation. WSF is not fully understood but is thought to be due to hydrogen release and diffusion into the bearing steel and/or transient operating conditions not fully understood. The initiation mechanisms of white etching cracks (WECs) are contested, where amongst others mechanisms, subsurface initiation at non-metallic inclusions (perhaps associated with extension of butterfly cracks) and surface crack initiation are cited. For the first time this study applies serial sectioning to map WEC networks in wind <b>turbine</b> gearbox <b>bearings</b> to elucidate WEC initiation mechanisms. A comparison is made between WEC data for inner rings of an industrial transient test gearbox bearing and a planet bearing that spalled in service. It is proposed that one mechanism of WEC formation in wind <b>turbine</b> gearbox <b>bearings</b> is due to subsurface WEC initiation from inclusions, either in a butterfly manner or non-butterfly manner; where these small WECs link together to form larger WEC networks, these eventually propagating to the surface resulting in WSF.
