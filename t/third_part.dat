5|$|As the Ottoman Empire did {{not force}} Muslim {{conversion}} on its conquered western territories, reformed ideas were quickly {{adopted in the}} two-thirds of Hungary they occupied (the Habsburg-ruled <b>third</b> <b>part</b> of Hungary remained Catholic). A Reformed Constitutional Synod was held in 1567 in Debrecen, the main hub of Hungarian Calvinism, where the Second Helvetic Confession was adopted as the official confession of Hungarian Calvinists.|$|E

5|$|While {{composing}} {{the opera}} Siegfried, the <b>third</b> <b>part</b> of the Ring cycle, Wagner interrupted {{work on it}} and between 1857 and 1864 wrote the tragic love story Tristan und Isolde and his only mature comedy Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg (The Mastersingers of Nuremberg), two works that {{are also part of}} the regular operatic canon.|$|E
5|$|A <b>third</b> <b>part</b> of {{the planet}} finding mission was the search for Jupiter-mass planets around young stars. The survey would have helped {{scientists}} understand more about solar system formation, including the occurrence of hot Jupiters. This portion {{of the planet}} hunt was designed to study systems {{with one or more}} Jupiter mass planets before the system has reached long term equilibrium. Planet hunting techniques using a star's radial velocity cannot measure the regular, tiny to-and-fro wobble motions induced by planets against the strong atmospheric activity of a youthful star. It is through the techniques pioneered by Albert A. Michelson that the SIM {{would have been able to}} execute its three primary planet-finding missions.|$|E

5|$|Although loaned {{to friends}} and family, and {{therefore}} in slight public circulation, Coke's Reports were never formally used during his lifetime. Select cases were published in 1600, containing {{the most famous of}} his decisions and pleadings, while a second volume in 1602 was more chronological in nature. The <b>third</b> <b>part,</b> published in the same year, was also chronological, while the fourth, published in 1604, was arranged by subject. The fifth part, published in 1605, is arranged similarly, as is the sixth, published in 1607. Five more volumes were published until 1615, but Coke died before he could publish a single bound copy. No trace has been found of the draft manuscript.|$|E
5|$|Finnegans Wake {{comprises}} seventeen chapters, {{divided into}} four Parts or Books. Part I contains eight chapters, Parts II and III each contain four, and Part IV consists of only one short chapter. The chapters appear without titles, and while Joyce never provided possible chapter titles {{as he had done}} for Ulysses, he did title various sections published separately (see Publication history below). The standard critical practice is to indicate part number in Roman numerals, and chapter title in Arabic, so that III.2, for example, indicates the second chapter of the <b>third</b> <b>part.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Power of Nightmares {{was first}} {{broadcast}} in three parts on BBC Two in 2004 in the United Kingdom, beginning with 'Baby it's Cold Outside' on 20 October, 'The Phantom Victory' on 27 October, and 'The Shadows in the Cave' on 3 November. The murder of Kenneth Bigley led the BBC to cease publicising the final episode {{prior to its}} airing. It was broadcast again over three days in January 2005, with the <b>third</b> <b>part</b> updated to note the Law Lords ruling from the previous December that detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial was illegal.|$|E

5|$|The book {{opens with}} an {{introductory}} editor's note by Greg Ruggiero, praising the Occupy movement {{and its potential}} for the greater democratization of society. This {{is followed by the}} text to Chomsky's Howard Zinn Memorial Lecture, which he gave at Occupy Boston in Massachusetts.

5|$|The station {{building}} in Winschoten {{was completed in}} 1865. The <b>third</b> <b>part</b> of Staatslijn B between Groningen and Winschoten was opened on 1 May 1868. Trains were initially operated by the Maatschappij tot Exploitatie van Staatsspoorwegen (Company for the Exploitation of the State Railways). Services between Winschoten and Nieuweschans started in November 1868, and between Nieuweschans and Leer in Germany in December 1876, when the Harlingen–Nieuweschans railway {{was connected to the}} Ihrhove–Nieuweschans railway.|$|E

This also made Stargate Universe the number 1 non-sports {{speciality}} program of the day. Including the ratings from two additional airings the following day also totalled the ratings up to 2.3 million, comparable to the US release. In the United Kingdom, the first part was seen by 1.165 million viewers, while the second part were seen by 1.061 million, placing Stargate Universe {{the first and second}} most viewed series the week it aired on Sky1, and the UK's highest Stargate audience in five years.

The Sci Fi Channel Australia premiere of the episode attracted 149,000 viewers, becoming the second most watched episode that week, while being bested by a soccer match.|$|E
5|$|Born in Bunkyō Ward of Tokyo, Miyazaki {{expressed}} interest in manga and animation from an early age, and he joined Toei Animation in 1963. During his early years at Toei Animation he worked as an in-between artist and later collaborated with director Isao Takahata. Notable films to which Miyazaki contributed at Toei include Doggie March and Gulliver's Travels Beyond the Moon. He provided key animation to other films at Toei, such as Puss in Boots and Animal Treasure Island, before moving to A-Pro in 1971, where he co-directed Lupin the <b>Third</b> <b>Part</b> I alongside Takahata. After moving to Zuiyō Eizō (later known as Nippon Animation) in 1973, Miyazaki worked as an animator on World Masterpiece Theater, and directed the television series Future Boy Conan. He joined Telecom Animation Film in 1979 to direct his first feature films, The Castle of Cagliostro in 1979 and Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind in 1984, {{as well as the}} television series Sherlock Hound.|$|E
5|$|Castro's {{government}} emphasised social {{projects to}} improve Cuba's standard of living, often {{to the detriment}} of economic development. Major emphasis was placed on education, and during the first 30 months of Castro's government, more classrooms were opened than in the previous 30 years. The Cuban primary education system offered a work-study program, with half of the time spent in the classroom, and the other half in a productive activity. Health care was nationalized and expanded, with rural health centers and urban polyclinics opening up across the island to offer free medical aid. Universal vaccination against childhood diseases was implemented, and infant mortality rates were reduced dramatically. A <b>third</b> <b>part</b> of this social program was the improvement of infrastructure. Within {{the first six months of}} Castro's government, 600 miles of roads were built across the island, while $300 million was spent on water and sanitation projects. Over 800 houses were constructed every month in the early years of the administration in an effort to cut homelessness, while nurseries and day-care centers were opened for children and other centers opened for the disabled and elderly.|$|E

60|$|No notes {{have been}} added to the second and <b>third</b> <b>parts</b> of this essay, as these {{portions}} are unimportant, and may be omitted by the student; they are really introductory to something quite different, and are printed in our edition only to make this essay complete.|$|R
5|$|Fish have a {{closed-loop}} circulatory system. The heart pumps {{the blood}} in a single loop throughout the body. In most fish, the heart consists of four parts, including two chambers and an entrance and exit. The first part is the sinus venosus, a thin-walled sac that collects blood from the fish's veins before allowing it to flow to the second part, the atrium, which is a large muscular chamber. The atrium serves as a one-way antechamber, sends blood to the <b>third</b> <b>part,</b> ventricle. The ventricle is another thick-walled, muscular chamber and it pumps the blood, first to the fourth part, bulbus arteriosus, a large tube, and then out of the heart. The bulbus arteriosus connects to the aorta, through which blood flows to the gills for oxygenation.|$|E
5|$|In {{a further}} change of regulations, tyre {{supplier}} Pirelli now made three {{instead of two}} tyre compounds available for each Grand Prix. For the Australian Grand Prix, these were the super-soft, soft and medium compounds. With Pirelli providing every driver with two sets of tyres for the race (of which one must be used) and an additional one for the <b>third</b> <b>part</b> of qualifying, drivers were able to choose ten additional sets of tyres out of the three compounds available. Notably, Mercedes drivers Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg made different choices, with Rosberg opting for an additional set of mediums instead of soft tyres. The two Manor drivers chose the most conservative way, taking on four sets each of the medium and soft compounds.|$|E
5|$|In {{the episode}} {{a group of}} {{evacuees}} from Icarus Base, an offworld human outpost that fell under attack {{end up on the}} Destiny, an Ancient starship located several billion light-years from Earth. Their first problems involve the ship's failing life support system, where the new crew are tasked to fix it. The episode features some of the well known characters from Stargate SG-1, a previous series in the Stargate franchise. Parts of the <b>third</b> <b>part</b> are filmed on location in White Sands, New Mexico, which doubles as a desert planet. The first two parts were given generally positive reviews, mainly commending the cast and the style of the episode. The premiere was seen by over 2.3 million Americans, and was considered a ratings success in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom.|$|E
50|$|The {{second and}} <b>third</b> <b>parts</b> of Thévenot's Voyages were posthumously {{published}} from his journals in 1674 and 1684 (all quarto).
