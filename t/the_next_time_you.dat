While we mourn {{the loss of a}} very good man, we also celebrate his remarkable life and hope that it serves as an example to young people around the world to work hard to make their dreams come true, to be willing to explore and push the limits, and to selflessly serve a cause greater than themselves. For those who may ask what they can do to honor Neil, we have a simple request. Honor his example of service, accomplishment and modesty, and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> walk outside on a clear night and see the moon smiling down at you, think of Neil Armstrong and give him a wink."

500|$|After {{the tournament}} ended, Moon was congratulated by {{professional}} poker player Phil Hellmuth, who said, [...] "I'm proud of you, Darvin." [...] Some were critical of both Moon and Cada. Mike Matusow, a professional poker player {{with a reputation}} for trash-talking, called the heads-up contest between the two [...] "a new low for poker as a skilled game". Storms Reback, of All In Magazine, said Moon was [...] "out of his league" [...] at the tournament, and made a number of questionable calls and bets. As an example, Reback cited a hand in which Moon attempted to bluff by re-raising a bet by Begleiter for 15 million chips, then folding when Begleiter went all in for an additional 6 million, even though Moon was getting better than 7-to-1 odds on his money. Moon said he planned to spend some of his World Series winnings on putting relatives through college and charitable contributions to his home town, including a new youth ball field and recreation center. Moon said of his victory, [...] "We ain't gonna change. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> see us, we'll be wearing jeans and everything else, like we always have." ...|$|E
500|$|Christie {{commented that}} [...] "people didn't do scenes {{like that in}} those days", and that she found the scenes {{difficult}} to film: [...] "There were no available examples, no role models ... I just went blank and Nic [...] shouted instructions." [...] The scene caused problems with censors {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic. [...] The American censor advised Nicolas Roeg explicitly, saying, [...] "We cannot see humping. We cannot see the rise and fall between thighs." [...] The scene's much celebrated fragmented style, in which scenes of the couple having sexual intercourse are intercut with scenes of the couple post-coitally getting dressed to go out to dinner, partly came about through Roeg's attempt to accommodate the concerns of the censors: [...] "They scrutinised it and found absolutely nothing they could object to. If someone goes up, you cut and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> see them they're in a different position, you obviously fill in the gaps for yourself. But, technically speaking, there was no 'humping' in that scene." [...] In the end, Roeg only cut nine frames from the sequence, and the film was awarded an R rating in the United States. In Britain, the British Board of Film Classification judged the uncut version to be [...] "tasteful and integral to the plot", and a scene in which Donald Sutherland's character can be clearly seen performing oral sex on Christie's character was permitted, but it was still given an X rating—an adults only certificate.|$|E
2500|$|On 3 April 2017 it was {{revealed}} that Moyes had made a controversial remark after a post-match interview after Sunderland's goalless draw with Burnley on 18 March. After the interview with the BBC's Vicki Sparks, while the microphone was still audible, Moyes, said: [...] "It was getting a wee bit naughty at the end there so just watch yourself. You still might get a slap even though you’re a woman. Careful <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> come in". Moyes apologised for the incident. The FA wrote to Moyes to ask for his observations on the incident.|$|E
