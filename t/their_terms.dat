Given notice to report to work on Monday, July 30 or be discharged from the company, most chose discharge, but the company had little trouble in acquiring the workers needed to run the trains.|$|E

5|$|The {{original}} 1792 Kentucky Constitution had {{the governor}} chosen by an electoral college for {{a term of}} four years. The second constitution in 1799 changed this to a popular vote, and prevented governors from succeeding themselves within seven years of <b>their</b> <b>terms.</b> The third constitution in 1850 reduced the succession limitation to four years. A 1992 {{amendment to the constitution}} allowed governors to have a second term before being prevented from succeeding themselves for four years.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the Six Day War, Israel {{held the}} entire Sinai peninsula, with the {{exception}} of Port Fouad. Israel's victory in the Six Day War brought about a sense of security within Israel; the occupied territory added strategic depth to the country's defense. Consequently, Israel and Egypt ignored United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 242, which called for withdrawal from occupied territories in return for Arab recognition, and negotiations between the countries ceased. Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir aimed {{to maintain the status quo}} and believed that her country's military strength would secure peace with Arab nations on <b>their</b> <b>terms.</b> Egypt, on the other hand, refused to recognize Israel or even negotiate with directly, preferring talks via third parties.|$|E
5|$|If the {{governor}} becomes incapacitated, then the Lieutenant Governor of Indiana becomes acting-governor until his recovery. Only two governors have become incapacitated during <b>their</b> <b>terms,</b> and current precedent is that {{the governor}}'s office is to notify the lieutenant governor, who will then {{make the decision to}} become acting governor by notifying the General Assembly by letter. The governor can resume his powers and duties by sending a letter to the General Assembly notifying them that he is again capable of executing the duties of office. If the governor resigns, dies, or is impeached, tried, and convicted, then the lieutenant governor becomes governor. If the office of the lieutenant governor is vacant, then the Senate Pro-Tempore becomes governor. If the office of Senate President pro tempore is also vacant, then the Senate must elect a new Pro-Tempore to fill the governor's office.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{governors}} of Wisconsin served for two-year terms, but in 1967 {{the state constitution}} was amended to change this to four. Jeremiah McLain Rusk served one three-year term in the 1880s as the constitution was amended during his first term to move elections from odd to even years, and all officers were allowed to serve an extra year, rather than have <b>their</b> <b>terms</b> cut a year short. Patrick Lucey, elected in the 1970 election, was the first governor to serve a four-year term. Governors of Wisconsin are not term limited.|$|E

5|$|Since {{statehood}} in 1845 {{there have}} been 43 people who have served as governor, one of whom served two distinct terms. Three state governors have served two full four-year terms: William D. Bloxham, in two stints; and Reubin Askew and Jeb Bush, who each served <b>their</b> <b>terms</b> consecutively. Bob Graham almost served two terms, as he resigned with only three days left. The shortest term in office belongs to Wayne Mixson, who served three days following the resignation of his predecessor, Bob Graham.|$|E
5|$|The {{membership}} of the Standing Committee consists of the chairman, deputy chairmen and other members; these members are elected by the National Assembly. Standing Committee members cannot simultaneously be members of the Government. Members work on a full-time basis, and <b>their</b> <b>terms</b> of office correspond with the term of the National Assembly. The Standing Committee continues to function until a new National Assembly is elected. According to the constitution, the Standing Committee is responsible for 12 duties. Of these, the most important are the powers to announce, convene and chair the National Assembly sessions, to interpret the constitution, laws and ordinances, and to issue ordinances on those matters assigned by the National Assembly. It supervises and guides the People's Councils and their activities, and directs, regulates and coordinates {{the activities of the}} Ethnic Council and the committees of the National Assembly.|$|E
5|$|The plebeians {{had finally}} {{achieved}} political equality with the patricians. However, {{the plight of}} the average plebeian had not changed. A small number of plebeian families achieved the same standing that the old aristocratic patrician families had always had, but the new plebeian aristocrats became as uninterested in {{the plight of the}} average plebeian as the old patrician aristocrats had always been. The plebeians rebelled by leaving Rome and refusing to return until they had more rights. The patricians then noticed how much they needed the plebeians and accepted <b>their</b> <b>terms.</b> The plebeians then returned to Rome and continued their work.|$|E

50|$|Because of the 17th Amendment, {{starting}} in 1914 U.S. Senators were directly elected instead {{of by the}} state legislatures.

5|$|There {{were some}} tensions, however. Finn Thoresen left {{the party in}} November 1992, and later formed New Future Coalition Party. More importantly, because of {{disagreements}} in 1992 and 1993, pertaining to libertarianism in general and especially the European Union question, several libertarians that had entered the Progress Party in the 1980s ceased their activity in the party. MPs Tor Mikkel Wara and Petter Bjørheim announced their intentions to leave politics {{after the end of}} <b>their</b> <b>terms,</b> as did Pål Atle Skjervengen. Jan Erik Fåne tried to win renomination, but the nomination meeting in Akershus put traditionalist Fridtjof Frank Gundersen on top of the ballot. Fåne was offered the second spot, but pulled out. Eight months later it turned out that holding the second spot on the ballot did indeed give a Parliament seat.|$|E
5|$|Where a County Association {{had been}} formed, an Order in Council {{could be made}} {{providing}} for the transfer of specified Yeomanry and Volunteer units from that county, {{in whole or in}} part, into the Territorial Force. These units would be deemed to have been lawfully formed units of the Territorial Force as of the date of that Order. As of that date, every officer and man in the unit would be deemed {{to be a member of}} the Territorial Force; however, this was not to affect <b>their</b> <b>terms</b> of service. An Order in Council was made under this section on 19 March 1908, which transferred all existing units of the Yeomanry and Volunteers, with a small number of exceptions.|$|E
5|$|Enforcing the {{prohibition}} on liquor began {{to cause the}} force increasing problems. The liquor laws had been designed to prevent the First Nations from drinking alcohol, but <b>their</b> <b>terms</b> also applied to the increasing numbers of white settlers in the late 1880s. Although some temperance groups applauded the measures, most settlers opposed them. Special permits to import alcohol for personal consumption could be granted, but these were not issued impartially, adding to the general resentment. Many members of the force drank alcohol themselves, including liquor confiscated from smugglers, and police beer canteens were established to provide members of the force a legal alternative. Settlers also began to routinely evade the laws in the larger towns, despite mounted police searches, the deployment of undercover officers, and large fines being imposed by the courts. Public hostility towards the force grew and the police soon found themselves almost entirely occupied in attempting to enforce the unpopular laws. Legal changes were pushed through in 1892, removing prohibition and allowing the licensing of public bars; the new law was enforced by local town inspectors, removing most of the force's responsibility for the problem.|$|E

5|$|For many net oil {{importing}} {{countries the}} 2000s energy crisis brought back concerns first raised during the 1973 oil crisis. For the United States, the other developed countries and emerging countries {{their dependence on}} foreign oil has revived concerns about their vulnerability to price shocks and supply disruption. Also, there have been concerns about the uncertainty surrounding peak oil production and the higher cost of extracting unconventional oil. A third issue that has been raised is the threat to national security because most proven oil reserves are concentrated in relatively few geographic locations, including some countries with strong resource nationalism, unstable governments or hostile to U.S. interests. In addition, for many developing countries, and particularly for the poorest African countries, high oil prices have an adverse impact on the government budget and deteriorate <b>their</b> <b>terms</b> of trade thus jeopardizing their balance of payments, all leading to lower economic growth.|$|E
5|$|McCain {{testified against}} Keating {{in a civil}} suit brought by Lincoln bondholders, and {{was seen as the}} plaintiffs' best witness. The other four {{senators}} refused to testify. Cranston left office in January 1993, and died in December 2000. DeConcini and Riegle continued to serve in the Senate until <b>their</b> <b>terms</b> expired, but they did not seek re-election in 1994. DeConcini was appointed by President Bill Clinton in February 1995 to the Board of Directors of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation. Glenn did choose to run for re-election in 1992, trying to become the first senator ever to win a fourth term from Ohio. The Republican candidate, Lieutenant Governor R. Michael DeWine, attacked Glenn on Keating Five {{as well as a number}} of other matters, in one of the dirtiest campaigns in the country that year and the toughest of Glenn's senatorial contests. Glenn prevailed, however, defeating DeWine by nine percentage points to gain one more term in the Senate before retiring and not running for re-election in 1998.|$|E
5|$|The JNA {{planned a}} {{two-stage}} mobilisation of troops. The {{first wave of}} call-ups was performed in July, and was meant to intimidate Croatia without an actual offensive being launched and allow timely deployment of crucial units. After {{the first stage of}} the mobilisation failed to deter Croatian forces, the second stage commenced on 15 September; it was met with a large-scale refusal of mobilised personnel to report to their designated units, desertions and an overall lack of enthusiasm for the campaign. This resulted in low troop availability, forcing the JNA to deploy fewer infantry units and to abandon some operations. Response to the mobilisation was particularly poor in Central Serbia, where only 26% of those called-up reported for service. Nonetheless, in September 1991, the JNA discharged conscripts that had completed <b>their</b> <b>terms</b> of service, and reached 73% of planned troop levels. The mobilisation problems demoralised JNA troops and commanders. A request made by JNA general command to Milošević for general mobilisation to strengthen troop levels was denied because he did not believe the campaign was needed nor feasible. Despite the mobilisation problems, the JNA and the TO forces deployed in support of the campaign consisted of approximately 145,000 troops, 1,100 tanks, 700 other armoured vehicles and 1,980 artillery pieces, supported by the Yugoslav Air Force and the Navy.|$|E
5|$|The {{ruler of}} Jodhpur, Hanwant Singh, was antipathetic to the Congress, {{and did not}} see much future in India for him or the {{lifestyle}} he wished to lead. Along with the ruler of Jaisalmer, he entered into negotiations with Muhammad Ali Jinnah, who was the designated head of state for Pakistan. Jinnah was keen to attract {{some of the larger}} border states, hoping thereby to attract other Rajput states to Pakistan and compensate for the loss of half of Bengal and Punjab. He offered to permit Jodhpur and Jaisalmer to accede to Pakistan on any terms they chose, giving their rulers blank sheets of paper and asking them to write down <b>their</b> <b>terms,</b> which he would sign. Jaisalmer refused, arguing that {{it would be difficult for}} him to side with Muslims against Hindus in the event of communal problems. Hanwant Singh came close to signing. However, the atmosphere in Jodhpur was in general hostile to accession to Pakistan. Mountbatten also pointed out that the accession of a predominantly Hindu state to Pakistan would violate the principle of the two-nation theory on which Partition was based, and was likely to cause communal violence in the State. Hanwant Singh was persuaded by these arguments, and somewhat reluctantly agreed to accede to India.|$|E
5|$|Turmoil in the mayor's office also {{weakened}} the Birmingham city government in {{its opposition to}} the campaign. Connor, who had run for several elected offices {{in the months leading}} up to the campaign, had lost all but the race for Public Safety Commissioner. Because they believed Connor's extreme conservatism slowed progress for the city as a whole, a group of white political moderates worked to defeat him. The Citizens for Progress was backed by the Chamber of Commerce and other white professionals in the city, and their tactics were successful. In November 1962, Connor lost the race for mayor to Albert Boutwell, a less combative segregationist. However, Connor and his colleagues on the City Commission refused to accept the new mayor's authority. They claimed on a technicality that <b>their</b> <b>terms</b> would not expire until 1965 instead of in the spring of 1963. So for a brief time, Birmingham had two city governments attempting to conduct business.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his arrival}} in Carthage, Troglita reorganized his troops, bolstering the local forces with the {{veterans}} he had brought with him – mostly horse archers and cataphracts – and marched out to meet the rebels. At Antonia Castra, emissaries from Antalas presented themselves, but Troglita rejected <b>their</b> <b>terms</b> and imprisoned them. The Byzantine army marched into Byzacena, relieved the beleaguered cities and joined up with Marcentius. The Moors, taken by surprise by the imperial army's swift advance, withdrew again to the mountainous and wooded interior, where they gathered their forces {{under the leadership of}} Ierna of the Leuathae and Antalas. Corippus suggests that they hoped that Troglita would not maintain his pursuit in the midst of winter, and that they would have the advantage over the imperial army in this terrain. Troglita encamped near the Moorish positions and dispatched an envoy, Amantius, to bring Antalas his terms: the general offered amnesty in exchange for submitting to imperial authority again.|$|E
