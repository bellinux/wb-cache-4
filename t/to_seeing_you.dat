2500|$|In February 2008, it was {{revealed}} on CBS nighttime news that Adams had allegedly exchanged e-mails with the assistant city manager on how {{they were going to}} arrange his over $400,000 salary and how to hide that fact from the citizens. The email's contents were presented in a humorous manner regarding bilking the city. [...] "I am looking forward <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> and taking all of Bell's money", Adams wrote, according to the memo.|$|E
2500|$|Elvis's {{second set}} in the show {{consisted}} of [...] "Ready Teddy" [...] and a short on-air comment to Sullivan, [...] "Ah, Mr. Sullivan. We know that somewhere out there you are looking in, and, ah, all the boys and myself, and everybody out here, are looking forward <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> back on television." [...] Next, Elvis declared, [...] "Friends, as a great philosopher once said, 'You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog ...,' [...] " [...] as he launched into a short (1:07) version of the song.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} looking forward <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> for days, and now I {{feel that this is}} not quite what I expected. You have changed," [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Think of my pride--my {{glory in}} your glory; think of me.... Not for myself! You know I never cared for myself!' sobbed {{out the old}} man. 'But <b>to</b> die <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> empress!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{do not see}} why I {{should not}} manage it very well," [...] said Ermine, cheerfully, [...] "if Miss Curtis will let me know in time whether she is equal <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> me. <b>You</b> know I can walk into the house now." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{am really}} {{working out a}} plan of {{approach}} to your domicile in the conditions most favourable <b>to</b> my <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> as well as Elena, and it will in due course break upon you, if it doesn't rather {{take the form of}} my trying to drag you both hither! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know how}} to reply," [...] she answered, her embarrassment proving her truth. [...] "Will you promise to leave me quite free as <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> or not seeing you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very {{expensive}} indeed," [...] she agreed, with a sigh. [...] "I {{have been}} looking forward <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you,</b> Jerry. I thought, perhaps, {{for the sake of}} old times you might advise me." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{look forward}} <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> to-morrow afternoon, and I {{must tell you}} of a {{financial}} operation I am now conducting, which, if successful, may enable me {{to pay off the}} mortgages which render the Norfolk estates so unremunerative.|$|E
6000|$|... "England is very {{attractive}} <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>seeing</b> how indifferently <b>you</b> have prospered there," [...] he observed then, turning his calm face to his nephew with a smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] {{interrupted}} Karlsefin, with a laugh, [...] "that is {{the last}} thing <b>you</b> ought <b>to</b> say, <b>seeing</b> that <b>you</b> have had so much beshrewing already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You don't suppose I {{want to stay}} in your house," [...] Ned said passionately. [...] "You don't {{suppose that}} it's any {{pleasure}} to me <b>to</b> stop here, <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> play the tyrant over my mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was looking}} forward <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> in that new frock," [...] said my father. In the case of another, one might have {{attributed}} such a speech to tact; {{in the case of}} my father, one felt it was a happy accident.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I must go. My {{heart is}} {{lightened}} already since I have confided my trouble to you. I shall look forward <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> again this afternoon." [...] She dropped her thick black veil {{over her face}} and glided from the room.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wingrave," [...] {{she said}} softly, [...] "are {{you going to}} be unkind to me--you, whom I have always thought of in my dreams as the most generous of men! I have looked forward so much <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> again--to knowing that you were free! Don't {{disappoint}} me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor child, {{she seems}} {{as if she could}} neither speak nor cry. It is half hysterical, and I was going to get {{something}} for her <b>to</b> take. Perhaps <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> may be good for her." ...|$|R
60|$|We shall reach Aspinwall Thursday {{morning at}} 6 o'clock, and San Francisco {{less than two}} weeks later. I worry a great deal about being obliged <b>to</b> go without <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> all, but it could not be helped.|$|R
6000|$|... "Milor," [...] whispered his Majesty, [...] "'tis a good affair {{we would}} propose, one {{which we could}} carry through without your help, but in which we would wish <b>to</b> {{initiate}} <b>you,</b> <b>seeing</b> that <b>you</b> are our friend." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now that {{everything}} has been explained," [...] she said, [...] "I scarcely see what else you could have done. At least you saved him from Da Souza when his death would have made you a freer man. He is looking forward <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you,</b> you must make haste and get strong." ...|$|E
6000|$|At least, my dear Meiklejohn, I {{hope you}} will believe in the {{sincerely}} warm and friendly regard in which I hold you, and the pleasure with which I look forward, not only to hearing from you shortly, but <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> again in the flesh with another good luncheon and good talk. Tell me when you don't like my work.--Your friend, ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Julien," [...] {{she said}} dryly, [...] "what an absurd idea! Of course I am quite used to these little affairs, <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> lie bound and gagged, and {{pointing}} a revolver at that unpleasant-looking Prince, with a horrible fear inside {{me all the}} time that if I did aim at anything I shouldn't hit it! Nevertheless, I think I'll go home, if you don't mind." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I promised,' {{said the}} visitor, rising, 'that I would write <b>to</b> him after <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> (I could hardly {{fail to see}} you sooner or later), and tell him if you were well and happy. I had better say you were well and happy.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not going}} to say much <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>seeing</b> as how both of you are hurt," [...] said the master of the Columbia, briefly. [...] "But understand, I want no {{nonsense}} from either of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Boys!" [...] he said, [...] "listen to me a second, I {{want to ask}} you something. What {{on earth}} do you think we came here for? Simply and solely because we can't bear <b>to</b> go on <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> killed day after day, month after month, year after year. That's all, and it's Christ's truth. Amen!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I forgot that. I {{have grown}} so {{accustomed}} <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> that I forget that, to other people, your face would seem strange; as {{it at first}} did to me, in the forest. Indeed you look to me now like one of ourselves; but were we to join a band, someone would {{be sure to ask}} questions concerning you, ere long. What, then, do you think we had best do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Madame de Bellegarde {{and her son}} {{exchanged}} a glance of lucid irony, and Urbain said, [...] "My dear sir, what you propose is hardly an improvement. We have not the slightest objection <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you,</b> as an amiable foreigner, and we have every reason for not wishing to be eternally separated from my sister. We object to the marriage; and in that way," [...] and M. de Bellegarde gave a small, thin laugh, [...] "she would be more married than ever." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Kennedy," [...] he said, pleasantly. [...] "I {{hope you}} had a good time in the holidays. I suppose Silver has told you the melancholy news--that you are to desert us this term? It is a great pity. We shall all be very sorry to lose you. I don't look forward <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> bowl us all out in the house-matches next summer," [...] he added, with a smile, [...] "though we shall expect a few full-pitches to leg, for the sake of old times." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suspected}}. [...] . Of course I suspected {{something of}} your little goings on. I {{am not a}} child. But from suspecting <b>to</b> seeing-- <b>seeing,</b> <b>you</b> understand--there's an enormous difference. That sort of thing. [...] . Come! One isn't made of stone. And when a man has been worried by a girl as I have been worried by you, Miss Freya-- sleeping and waking, then, of course. [...] . But I am {{a man of the}} world. It must be dull for you here [...] . I say, won't you leave off this confounded playing [...] .?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The [...] "Origin of Love!"--Ah, why [...] That cruel {{question}} ask of me, [...] When thou mayst read in many an eye [...] He starts <b>to</b> life on <b>seeing</b> <b>thee?</b> [...] And shouldst thou seek his end to know: [...] My heart forebodes, {{my fears}} foresee, [...] He'll linger long in silent woe; [...] But live until--I cease to be.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will do as}} you ask me, but {{it seems}} to me that they will {{naturally}} wish <b>to</b> see <b>you,</b> <b>seeing</b> that, had it not been for your arrival, they might have been robbed and perhaps murdered." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{is merely}} a notice to you that I must {{positively}} insist on your getting well, strong, and into good spirits, with the least possible delay. Also, that I look forward <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> at Gad's Hill sometime in the summer, staying with the girls, and heartlessly putting down the Plorn You {{know that there is}} no appeal from the Plorn's inimitable father. What he says must be done. Therefore I send you my love (which please take care of), and my commands (which please obey).|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't suppose I am {{discouraged}} by this first check. There are many kind {{people in the}} world; {{and some of them}} may employ me next time. The way to happiness is often very hard to find; harder, I almost think, for women than for men. But if we only try patiently, and try long enough, we reach it at last--in heaven, if not on earth. I think my way now is the way which leads <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> again. Don't forget that, my love, the next time you think of ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will have}} one sent down. Let me see, it is nearly twelve o'clock. I can get a wire to Liverpool by one. There is a man there who deals in such things. I should {{think he would be}} due to-morrow morning. Well, I shall look forward <b>to</b> <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> all before very long. I have rather outstayed my time, for I am a man of routine, and I always put in a certain number of hours in my laboratory." [...] He shook hands cordially with them all, and {{lighting}} his pipe at the doorstep, strolled off upon his way.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Arch-ee, as Oke calls you, I won't; I'm quite {{content to}} look on, for your gun kicks like a Mexican mule. Besides, it's easy work <b>to</b> steer, and <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> panting and toiling {{in the bow}} makes it seem all the easier. Just you keep blazin' away, old man. But, I say, where shall I steer to now? I'm tired o' {{steering}} among the reeds. Let us push out into the clear water." ...|$|R
6000|$|Oh, it's absurd. I won't let you. You're {{making us}} both utterly wretched. I won't let you {{sacrifice}} our happiness. Oh, Hilda, I love you. I can't live without you. At first I tried <b>to</b> resist <b>seeing</b> <b>you.</b> I used <b>to</b> pass your door {{and look up}} at your windows; and the door seemed {{as if it were}} waiting for me. And {{at the end of the}} street I used to look back. Oh, how I used to want to come in and see you once more! I thought if I saw you just once, I should get over it. And at last I couldn't help myself. I'm so weak. Do you despise me? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And so do I {{love you}} better {{than all the}} world besides." [...] And as he spoke he got up from his seat and stood before her. [...] "I know how poor I am, and unworthy of you; and only that you are engaged to him, I don't suppose that I should now tell you. Of course you couldn't accept such a one as me. But I have loved you ever since you remember; and now {{that you are going}} to be his wife, I cannot but tell you that it is so. You will go and live in London; but as <b>to</b> my <b>seeing</b> <b>you</b> there, it will be impossible. I could not go into that man's house." ...|$|R
