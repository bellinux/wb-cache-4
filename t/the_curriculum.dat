5|$|German {{was first}} {{introduced}} into <b>the</b> <b>curriculum</b> in 1931, the same time at which the school began to offer voluntary after-school art classes. F. H. Taylor attempted to achieve equilibrium in <b>the</b> <b>curriculum</b> between arts and science subjects; he made woodwork and art continuous for an entire term and introduced a geography course for the Higher School Certificate. In 1948 rural biology was added to <b>the</b> <b>curriculum</b> for the first time, for which the headmaster provided a plot of land {{to be used as}} a vegetable plot. At the end of that year, an after-school study period was introduced; following the seven normal periods (five in the morning, two in the afternoon), students were to either begin their homework, or attend a school society. However, the 1950s saw a definite swing towards maths and science, and a subsequent increase in staffing in those departments. In 1957, zoology and botany was taught at A-level for the first time, and physics and chemistry replaced rural biology at O-level (now replaced by the GCSE).|$|E

The County Council supported technical and commercial subjects in the late 19th century, but after 1904 it was empowered to support secondary education in general, allowing Latin and other classical components of <b>the</b> <b>curriculum</b> to remain intact. After World War I, sixth form courses were developed allowing students to commence advanced studies {{in the arts and}} sciences. By the 1950s, a wide range were available: English language and literature, mathematics, French, German, Latin, Greek, art, history, geography, physics, chemistry and woodwork; biology was taught at Kesteven and Sleaford High School.|$|E

40|$|Curriculum {{plays an}} {{important}} role in education world. The governments have revised <b>the</b> 1994 <b>Curriculum</b> that is regarded ineffective anymore and it is unable to prepare the students to compete with the other nations in the world.

This study attempts to investigate the answer of the teachers’ perception in comparing <b>the</b> 1994 <b>Curriculum</b> and <b>the</b> Competence-Based <b>Curriculum</b> in SLTPN in Malang, covering SLTPN 1, SLTPN 4, and SLTPN 6 by presenting the weaknesses and the strengths of <b>the</b> 1994 <b>Curriculum,</b> <b>the</b> weaknesses and the strengths of <b>the</b> Competence-Based <b>Curriculum,</b> and <b>the</b> teachers’ readiness to face <b>the</b> Competence- Based <b>Curriculum.</b> This study uses descriptive research which is meant to collect the information about status of an existing phenomenon when the research is conducted. The sample is 9 (nine) teachers from three UAN subject matter teachers (Indonesian, Math, and English) from three different SLTPNs (SLTPN 1, SLTPN 4, and SLTPN 6) in Malang. Moreover, in collecting the data, the writer interviews the nine respondents by using 5 (five) unstructured interview items. The result shows that most of the teachers have better tendencies toward <b>the</b> Competence- Based <b>Curriculum</b> than <b>the</b> 1994 <b>Curriculum,</b> theoretically.

30|$|One of {{the models}} used to frame <b>curriculum</b> studies is <b>the</b> {{well-known}} <b>curriculum</b> model of <b>the</b> TIMSS, which comprises three aspects: the intended, the implemented, and <b>the</b> attained <b>curriculum</b> (Mullis et al. 2009). In this study, Japan’s primary science curriculum is regarded as <b>the</b> model’s intended <b>curriculum</b> since {{it is part of}} <b>the</b> national <b>curriculum.</b> <b>The</b> primary science textbooks, used extensively by the teachers, are regarded as <b>the</b> implemented <b>curriculum</b> whereas <b>the</b> pupils’ performance or achievement on standardized tests is regarded as <b>the</b> achieved <b>curriculum.</b> Using this <b>curriculum</b> model and <b>the</b> available data, the learning content described in <b>the</b> national (intended) <b>curriculum</b> can be compared to an international standard.

Upon the withdrawal of the French, Muhammad Ali Pasha encouraged the establishment of secular learning, and history, math, and modern science were adopted into <b>the</b> <b>curriculum.</b> By 1872, under the direction of Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī, European philosophy was also added to the study program.|$|E
5|$|The first president, Joseph R. Williams, {{designed}} {{a curriculum that}} required more scientific study than practically any undergraduate institution of the era.

40|$|Since the {{inception}} of public schools, curriculum {{has been a source}} of ongoing debate and disagreement. Educational bureaucrats, school board administrators, principals, vice principals, teachers, parents, community organizations, and even students weigh in on discussions about what stu-dents should learn in class, how learning is best facilitated, and how to measure and evaluate such learning. Textbooks, teaching practice, projects, homework, examinations, report cards, and the like, are the purview of <b>the</b> formal <b>curriculum.</b> However, students learn in ways that lie beyond the boundaries of <b>the</b> formal <b>curriculum</b> through what is known as <b>the</b> hidden <b>curriculum</b> (Jackson, 1968). <b>The</b> hidden <b>curriculum</b> as a theoretical construct is conceptually problematic. As does <b>the</b> "formal " <b>curriculum,</b> <b>the</b> hidden <b>curriculum</b> defies definitional consensus. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> hidden <b>curriculum</b> will refer here to student learning that takes place within the perimeter of a school that is not recorded or reflected within <b>the</b> official <b>curriculum.</b> Theorists are not unanimous about the effects of the hidden curricu-lum on students and on teaching practice.
