2500|$|By 1971 Curnow was {{contacted}} again by Stan Kenton {{to do the}} arrangements for a new concept, double LP, National Anthems Of The World. [...] Kenton remembered the earlier arrangement done in 1963 of [...] "God Save The Queen", this sparked the interest of Kenton and led to Curnow serving as chief arranger, conductor, and the producer for the new 1972 concept album. [...] Though the recordings ended up being a commercial failure for the Stan Kenton Orchestra, the project became a high point for Curnow as an arranger and record producer. [...] After the National Anthems project Curnow stepped in on numerous dates for an ailing Kenton to conduct during <b>that</b> <b>next</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E

[...] In 2006, he returned to conduct the BBC Symphony Orchestra for his second [...] "Last Night" [...] engagement, and used the traditional speech at the end of the concert to criticise aircraft baggage restrictions, in place following the uncovering of the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot, which have made it difficult for musicians to carry their instruments on aircraft. [...] In a reference to the fact that laptop computers are now allowed in aircraft cabins, Elder said, [...] "...it seems to me <b>that</b> <b>next</b> <b>year</b> we should all look forward to 'Concerto for Laptop and Orchestra.'"

While the teams did not pay the full price for them (because of eBay or corporate donations), other teams would have to spend large amounts of money to replicate the winning designs.|$|R

There is Downy the Woodpecker hard at work on a new house this very minute. That's good. I like to see that.

So long as it has got reasonably good walls, and the rain and the wind can't get in, the older it is the better it suits me.

60|$|Suppose, for instance, {{that the}} {{capitalist}} is a hardware manufacturer, {{and that his}} stock in trade, over and above his machinery, consists at present wholly in iron goods. Iron goods can not feed laborers. Nevertheless, by a mere change of the destination of the iron goods, he can cause laborers to be fed. Suppose that [the capitalist changed into wages what he had before spent] in buying plate and jewels; and, in order to render the effect perceptible, let us suppose that the change takes place on a considerable scale, and that a large sum is diverted from buying plate and jewels to employing productive laborers, whom we shall suppose to have been previously, like the Irish peasantry, only half employed and half fed. The laborers, on receiving their increased wages, will not lay them out in plate and jewels, but in food. There is not, however, additional food in the country; nor any unproductive laborers or animals, as in the former case, whose food is set free for productive purposes. Food will therefore be imported if possible; if not possible, the laborers will remain for a season on their short allowance: but the consequence of this change in the demand for commodities, occasioned by {{the change in the}} expenditure of capitalists from unproductive to productive, is <b>that</b> <b>next</b> <b>year</b> more food will be produced, and less plate and jewelry. So that again, without having {{had anything to do with}} the food of the laborers directly, the conversion by individuals of a portion of their property, no matter of what sort, from an unproductive destination to a productive, has had the effect of causing more food to be appropriated to the consumption of productive laborers. The distinction, then, between Capital and Not-capital, does not lie in the kind of commodities, but in the mind of the capitalist—in his will to employ them for one purpose rather than another; and all property, however ill adapted in itself for the use of laborers, is a part of capital, so soon as it, or the value to be received from it, is set apart for productive reinvestment.|$|E
