Marcos heavily relied on Imelda, and as time passed, Imelda was no longer a clone of Marcos. Instead, she had become his political partner.|$|E

5|$|Both Robert Bingham and Percy Haly died in 1937; with J. C. W. Beckham aging—he {{would die}} in 1940—Chandler moved {{to fill the}} {{leadership}} void in the faction. He soon came {{to believe he was}} destined <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>President</b> of the United States. In mid-1937, he began advocating for Marvel Mills Logan, Kentucky's junior senator, to be appointed to the Supreme Court, creating a Senate vacancy to which Chandler, as governor, could appoint himself. The death of Justice George Sutherland in January 1938 gave President Franklin D. Roosevelt the opportunity to accommodate Chandler's wishes, but Roosevelt preferred younger justices—Logan was 63—and Kentucky's senior Senator, Alben Barkley, recommended Solicitor General Stanley Forman Reed for the appointment. Roosevelt heeded Barkley's advice and appointed Reed instead of Logan.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Obama was {{the keynote}} speaker at the Democratic National Convention. After his speech, {{political}} pundits speculated about his future as a possible presidential candidate.

5|$|John Charles Clegg (better {{known as}} just Charles) became a massive {{influence}} on the national {{as well as the}} local game. As a player, he was involved in the first inter-association match and became the first Sheffield-based player to be capped (gaining his only cap in the first international). He went on <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>president</b> of both the city's professional sides (playing a large part in the creation of Sheffield United) and held the same position at Sheffield and Hallamshire FA having overseen the merger of the two rival local FAs. He then moved on to national prominence when he became chairman of the FA in 1890 and president in 1923. He held both positions until his death in 1937.|$|E
5|$|MIT {{faculty members}} {{have often been}} {{recruited}} to lead other colleges and universities. Founding faculty member Charles W. Eliot was recruited in 1869 <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>president</b> of Harvard University, a post he would hold for 40 years, during which he wielded considerable influence on both American higher education and secondary education. MIT alumnus and faculty member George Ellery Hale {{played a central role}} in the development of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), and other faculty members have been key founders of Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering in nearby Needham, Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|On July 1, 1968, Vernon D. Crawford became {{dean of the}} institute's General College. In March 1969, Harrison {{announced}} that he would take a leave of absence until his resignation was effective; Chancellor George L. Simpson subsequently {{announced that}} Crawford would be the interim president. One notable development during Crawford's term was the advancement of the School of Industrial Management to a college. In 1966, Arthur G. Hansen, then a chairman of the University of Michigan's mechanical engineering department, was named Georgia Tech's Dean of Engineering. On August 1, 1969, Hansen became the institute's next president, a post he held until his resignation on July 1, 1971, <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>president</b> of his alma mater, Purdue University.|$|E

The Opposition, as well as Democratic strategist Bob Shrum, criticized the Government on the issue, stating they were trying to help the Republicans by helping Hillary Clinton win the Democratic nomination instead of Obama. They also alleged the leak would hurt relations with the United States if Obama ever were <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>President.</b> Obama was elected President in November. In February, Obama made his first foreign visit, as president, to Ottawa, in which he affirmed support for free trade with Canada, as well as complimenting Canada on its involvement in Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|British Somaliland became {{independent}} on 26 June 1960 as the State of Somaliland, and the Trust Territory of Somalia (the former Italian Somaliland) {{followed suit}} five days later. On 1 July 1960, the two territories united {{to form the}} Somali Republic, with Mogadishu serving as the nation's capital. A government was formed by Abdullahi Issa {{and other members of}} the trusteeship and protectorate governments, with Haji Bashir Ismail Yusuf as President of the Somali National Assembly, Aden Abdullah Osman Daar as President of the Somali Republic, and Abdirashid Ali Shermarke as Prime Minister (later <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>President</b> from 1967 to 1969). On 20 July 1961 and through a popular referendum, the people of Somalia ratified a new constitution, which was first drafted in 1960. In 1967, Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal became Prime Minister, a position to which he was appointed by Shermarke.|$|E
5|$|Calhoun had a {{difficult}} relationship with Jackson primarily due to the Nullification Crisis and the Petticoat affair. In contrast with his previous nationalism, Calhoun vigorously supported South Carolina's right to nullify federal tariff legislation he believed unfairly favored the North, putting him into conflict with unionists such as Jackson. In 1832, {{with only a few}} months remaining in his second term, he resigned as vice president and entered the Senate. He sought the Democratic nomination for the presidency in 1844, but lost to surprise nominee James K. Polk, who went on <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>president.</b> Calhoun served as Secretary of State under John Tyler from 1844 to 1845. As Secretary of State, he supported the annexation of Texas as a means to extend the slave power, and helped settle the Oregon boundary dispute with Britain. He then returned to the Senate, where he opposed the Mexican–American War, the Wilmot Proviso, and the Compromise of 1850 before his death in 1850. Calhoun often served as a virtual party-independent who variously aligned as needed with Democrats and Whigs.|$|E

5|$|Fantasia 2000, {{a sequel}} to the 1940 film {{that had been a}} pet-project of Roy E. Disney's since 1990, was {{released}} on January 1, 2000. Produced in pieces when artists were available between productions, Fantasia 2000 was the first animated feature produced for and released in IMAX format. A standard theatrical release followed in June, but the film's $90 million worldwide box office total against its $90 million production cost resulted in it losing $100 million for the studio. Peter Schneider left his post as president of Walt Disney Feature Animation in 1999 <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>president</b> of The Walt Disney Studios under Joe Roth. Thomas Schumacher, who had been Schneider's vice president of animation for several years, became the new president of Walt Disney Feature Animation. By this time, competition from other studios had driven animators' incomes to all-time highs, making traditionally animated features even more costly to produce. Schumacher was tasked with cutting costs, and massive layoffs began to cut salaries and bring the studio's staff– which peaked at 2,200 people in 1999– down to approximately 1,200 employees.|$|E
5|$|In 1946 he {{travelled}} the Western Circuit but was recalled by the Lord Chancellor {{to chair}} a committee {{looking at the}} reform of procedure in divorce cases. He continued working as a judge while chairing the daily committee. The committee was appointed on 26 June 1946 and published its first report in July, which reduced the time between decree nisi and decree absolute from 6 months to 6 weeks. The second report was published in November, recommending that County Court judges should be appointed to try cases, and the final report was published in February 1947 recommending {{the establishment of a}} Marriage Welfare Service. The reports were well received by the public and led to Denning being invited in 1949 <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>President</b> of the National Marriage Guidance Council.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, the Truman Scholarship {{was created}} as a federal program to honor U.S. college {{students}} who exemplified dedication to public service and leadership in public policy. In 2004, the President Harry S. Truman Fellowship in National Security Science and Engineering was {{created as a}} distinguished postdoctoral three-year appointment at Sandia National Laboratories. In 2001, the University of Missouri established the Harry S. Truman School of Public Affairs to advance the study and practice of governance. The University of Missouri's Missouri Tigers athletic programs have an official mascot named Truman the Tiger. On July 1, 1996, Northeast Missouri State University became Truman State University—to mark its transformation from a teachers' college to a highly selective liberal arts university and to honor the only Missourian <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>president.</b> A member institution of the City Colleges of Chicago, Harry S Truman College in Chicago, Illinois, is named in his honor for his dedication to public colleges and universities. In 2000, the headquarters for the State Department, built in the 1930s but never officially named, was dedicated as the Harry S Truman Building.|$|E
