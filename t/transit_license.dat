50|$|Licensing {{requirements}} are straightforward: companies must {{abide by the}} law to be licensed by the TRA, and only those with licenses can sell telecommunications services. Of {{the two types of}} ISP <b>licenses,</b> <b>transit</b> and national <b>licenses,</b> only <b>transit</b> <b>licenses</b> allow ISPs to establish international connectivity. Part of the TRA mandate is to protect users from the abuse of monopoly market share: companies determined to have “significant market power” must apply to have an amended license and are subject to additional penalties for anti-competitive behavior. A license may be revoked if the licensee has broken the law or has failed to fix repeated breaches in the agreement, has misleading/false information in their application, or does not pay the fee even after a warning.|$|R
