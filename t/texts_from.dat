5|$|Another {{commemorative}} {{event was}} {{proposed for the}} anniversary, the Moulin à paroles. Thousands gathered on the Plains of Abraham to listen to recitations of 140 significant <b>texts</b> <b>from</b> Quebec history, including the 1970 FLQ Manifesto. The inclusion of that document in the event led to condemnations and a boycott from federalist politicians and the withdrawal of some government funding for the event. The Moulin à paroles took place without incident.|$|E

The Hanbali school is noted for its literalist interpretation of the Qur'an and hadith.

The early recorded history of botany includes many ancient writings and plant classifications. Examples of early botanical works have been found in ancient <b>texts</b> <b>from</b> India dating back to before 1100 BC, in archaic Avestan writings, and in works from China before it was unified in 221 BC.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the best}} known of these tells of a {{stranger}} who arrived at the club on a stormy night. Invited in, he joined the members in a card game.

This story, which is found in <b>texts</b> <b>from</b> at least the 1930s, is very similar to one associated with Loftus Hall, County Wexford.

Through these writings, the Osiris myth persisted after knowledge of most ancient Egyptian beliefs was lost, and it is still well known today.|$|E
