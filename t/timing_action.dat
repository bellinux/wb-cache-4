The main point is the surface manipulation during this process. There are four factors relate to this manipulation: <b>timing,</b> <b>action,</b> style, and size.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine {{voluntary}} contributions {{to a public}} good, embedding Varian (1994) ’s voluntary contribution game in extended games that allow players to choose the timing of their contributions. We show that predicted outcomes {{are sensitive to the}} structure of the extended game, and also {{to the extent to which}} players care about payoff inequalities. We then report a laboratory experiment based on these extended games. We find that behavior is similar in the two extended games: subjects avoid the detrimental move order of Varian’s model, where a person with a high value of the public good commits to a low contribution, and instead players tend to delay contributions. These results suggest that commitment opportunities may be less damaging to public good provision than previously thought.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine {{voluntary}} contributions {{to a public}} good when the timing of contributions is endogenously determined by contributors, focusing on the simple quasi-linear setting with two players (Varian, 1994). We show that the move order that is predicted to emerge is sensitive to how commitment opportunities are modeled. We show that a favorable move order is predicted to emerge in Hamilton and Slutsky's (1990) "observable delay" extended game, but a detrimental move order is predicted to emerge in their "action commitment" extended game. We then report a laboratory experiment designed to examine whether the predicted move ordering emerges, and how this impacts overall contributions, in these extended games. The results are similar in both extended games. We find that when the detrimental move order is observed, contributions are indeed lower, as predicted. However, this detrimental move order is seldom observed. Instead of committing to low contributions, players tend to avoid making a commitment. These experimental results on timing decisions suggest that commitment opportunities may be less damaging to public good provision than previously thought.

40|$|Recent brain imaging {{research}} {{revealed that}} internally guided actions involve the frontomedian wall, {{in particular the}} preSMA and the rostral cingulate zone (RCZ). However, a systematic decomposition of different components of intentional action is still lacking. We propose a new paradigm to dissociate two components of internally guided behavior: Which action to perform (selection component) and when to perform the <b>action</b> (<b>timing</b> component). Our results suggest a neuro-functional dissociation of intentional <b>action</b> <b>timing</b> and intentional <b>action</b> selection. While the RCZ is more strongly activated for the selection component, {{a part of the}} superior medial frontal gyrus is more strongly activated for the timing component. However, in a post hoc conducted signal strength analysis we did also observe an interaction between <b>action</b> <b>timing</b> and <b>action</b> selection, indicating that decisional processes concerning <b>action</b> <b>timing</b> and <b>action</b> selection are not completely dissociated but interdependent. Altogether this study challenges the idea of a unitary system supporting voluntary action and instead suggests the existence of different neuroanatomically dissociable subfunctions...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{effective}} timing of economic policies actions in the tourism industry of a small open economy such as Singapore. The effective timing of policy actions is an open challenge issue to researchers and also a much needed rule of thumb to policy makers and private agents. This paper aims to (a) derive the influencing factors of a tourism demand function and (b) identify the time impact of these factors, thus, allowing the formulations of effective policy actions, by both, governmental tourism authorities and private tourism agents in Singapore. Our findings suggest that tourism government authorities and private tourism agents in Singapore should choose the timing of their actions depending upon the anticipated factor changes and their estimated impact. That is, if exchange rate variability is anticipated then policy actions should start at least twelve {{months prior to the}} start of the tourist period. If, a keen price competition is expected to prevail then the best timing of policy actions is nine months ahead the tourism period. If income improvements in origin countries could be expected, then a rather shorter <b>timing</b> <b>action</b> of six months would be available to tourism authorities and private agents in Singapore...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{a formal}} {{modeling}} approach is introduced for compositional specification of both functionality {{and timing of}} manufacturing systems. Functionality aspects can be considered orthogonally to the timing. The functional aspects are specified using two abstraction levels; high-level activities and lower level actions. Design of a functionally correct controller is possible by looking only at the activity level, abstracting from the different execution orders of actions. Furthermore, the specific <b>timing</b> of <b>actions</b> is not needed. As a result, controller design 3 ̆cbr/ 3 ̆ecan be performed on a much smaller state space compared to an explicit model where <b>timing</b> and <b>actions</b> are present.

40|$|In a model, two players, {{heterogeneous}} {{in their}} information quality, compete {{with each other}} with perfect information about the other player's information quality. If they can decide their <b>timings</b> of <b>actions</b> endogenously, the less-informed player has an incentive to delay her action for learning. On the other hand, the more-informed player wants to delay her action to prevent her information from being revealed, not to enable her to learn. The conflict of these two types of second mover advantages yields a war of attrition. Although both players can benefit from acting as the follower, the gain from a delay for learning is greater than that for preventing the other's learning. Therefore, a cost for the delay in action {{plays an important role in}} characterizing the equilibrium. In contrast to the literature, in which only informational externalities are considered, this article shows that the introduction of payoff externalities contributes to different procedures and reasoning processes through which the heterogeneous players' <b>timings</b> of <b>actions</b> are decided endogenously. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{conditions in}} which more accurate metacognition may lead to greater susceptibility to illusion; and thus conditions under which mindfulness meditation may lead to less accurate perceptions. Specifically, greater awareness of intentions may lead to an illusory compression of time between a voluntary action and its outcome (“intentional binding”).

Mindfulness meditation involves awareness of causal connections between different mental states, including intentions. We argue that this supports improvements in metacognition targeted at motor intentions. Changes in metacognitive ability may result in an earlier and less veridical experience of the <b>timing</b> of <b>action</b> outcomes either through increased access to sensorimotor pre-representations of an action outcome or by affording greater precision to <b>action</b> <b>timing</b> judgements.
