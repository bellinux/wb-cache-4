Emphasis {{has been placed on}} maintaining strict fiscal discipline, greater openness to trade and financial flows, market liberalisation and reduction in <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>government.</b> During this period, a large share of the economy was returned to private sector ownership through divestment and privatisation programmes.|$|E
25|$|Equal {{economic}} opportunity, a base {{social safety}} net provided by the welfare state, and strong labor unions have historically been {{at the heart of}} Democratic economic policy. The welfare state supports a progressive tax system, higher minimum wages, social security, universal health care, public education, and public housing. They also support infrastructure development and government sponsored employment programs in an effort to achieve economic development and job creation, while stimulating private sector job creation. Additionally however, since the 1990s the party has at times supported centrist economic reforms, which cut <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> and reduced market regulations. The party has continuously rejected laissez-faire economics as well as market socialism, instead favoring Keynesian economics within a capitalist market-based system.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between trade openness and <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>governments,</b> both theoretically and empirically. We argue that openness can increase <b>the</b> <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>governments</b> through two channels: (1) a terms of trade externality, whereby trade lowers the domestic cost of taxation, and (2) the demand for insurance, whereby trade raises risk and public transfers. We provide a uni 8 ̆ 5 ed framework for studying and testing these two mechanisms. Our main theoretical prediction is that the relative strength of the two explanations depends on a key parameter, namely, the elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign goods. Moreover, while the 8 ̆ 5 rst mechanism is ine ¢ cient {{from the standpoint of}} world welfare, the second is instead optimal. In the empirical part of the paper, we provide new evidence on the positive association between openness and government size and we explore its determinants. Consistently with the terms of trade externality channel, we show that the correlation is contingent on a low elasticity of substitution between domestic and foreign goods. Our 8 ̆ 5 ndings raise warnings that globalization may have led to ine ¢ ciently large governments...|$|R

40|$|How {{does the}} {{presence}} of corruption affect the optimal mix between consumption and income taxation? In this paper we examine this issue using a simple neoclassical growth model, with a self-seeking and corrupt public sector. We find that the optimal tax mix in a corrupt economy is one that relies more heavily upon consumption taxes than on income taxes, relative to an economy without corruption. Our model also allows us to investigate the effect of corruption on <b>the</b> optimal <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>government,</b> and our results indicate that <b>the</b> optimal <b>size</b> <b>of</b> <b>government</b> balances <b>the</b> wishes of the corrupt public sector for a larger government, and so greater opportunities for corruption, {{with those in the}} private sector who prefer a smaller government.
