5|$|While Shakespeare's {{daffodil}} is {{the wild}} or true English daffodil (N. pseudonarcissus), many other species were introduced, {{some of which}} escaped and naturalised, particularly N. biflorus (a hybrid) in Devon and the west of England. Gerard, in his extensive discussion of daffodils, both wild and cultivated ("bastard daffodils") described twenty four species in London gardens (1597), ("we have them all {{and every one of}} <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> London gardens, in great abundance", p.114).|$|E
25|$|In {{the most}} {{straightforward}} case, {{such as the}} sampling of a batch of material from production (acceptance sampling by lots), it would be most desirable to identify and measure every single item in the population and to include any one of <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> sample. However, in the more general case this is not usually possible or practical. There {{is no way to}} identify all rats in the set of all rats. Where voting is not compulsory, {{there is no way to}} identify which people will actually vote at a forthcoming election (in advance of the election). These imprecise populations are not amenable to sampling in any of the ways below and to which we could apply statistical theory.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, the Centre {{was closed}} to regular guests, but the staff became {{involved}} in reuniting refugees, {{many of whom had}} Guiding and Scouting connections. The Centre was also used for training military skiers and interning foreigners. The Swiss Guides were the only Guides who were able to use Our Chalet during the war, except for some French Guiding Commissioners who showed up in 1942. Many refugees came to Switzerland during the war and the staff tried to accommodate <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>Our</b> Chalet, but this was not allowed in most cases due to wartime regulations. However, the staff did help them with relief funds from the Guides and Scouts of Switzerland, Great Britain, and the United States. The Our Chalet staff found great joy in helping reunite families who had been divided by war. American Girl Scouts also donated substantial funds to Our Chalet in 1944, through the U.S.A. Friendly Fund, to help with postwar recovery efforts.|$|E

2500|$|Wolfram {{argues that}} the {{computational}} realities of the universe make science hard for fundamental reasons. But he also argues that by {{understanding the importance of}} these realities, we can learn to use <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> favor. For instance, instead of reverse engineering our theories from observation, we can enumerate systems and then try to match them to the behaviors we observe. A major theme of NKS [...] is investigating the structure of the possibility space. Wolfram argues that science is far too ad hoc, in part because the models used are too complicated and unnecessarily organized around the limited primitives of traditional mathematics. Wolfram advocates using models whose variations are enumerable and whose consequences are straightforward to compute and analyze.|$|E

2500|$|I've had a wing fold up at a {{thousand}} feet while sitting on a dud parachute. I've been backed {{up against a wall}} looking down the rifle barrels of a firing squad. I've felt the automatic of my own commanding officer poked in my ribs. While being smuggled from Spain into France to visit my wife, I've had a speed boat pilot killed by Fascist bullets in the Bay of Biscay. I've fought half a dozen German pursuit planes in the air with an orchestra leader as a gunner. And of all places to be during a bomb raid I was there - locked up in jail - and with my wife.
