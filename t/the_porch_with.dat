The roof of the porch reuses medieval wood. The nave, which has five bays, measures 59feet 6inches by 16feet 9inches (18.1 by 5.1m). A gallery at the west end is supported by two oak crossbeams, one of which has the date of 1777 inscribed.

2500|$|Mysterious events {{begin to}} occur when Mrs. Mullet, Buckshaw's {{housekeeper}} and cook, discovers a dead jack snipe on <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>with</b> a Penny Black stamp pierced through its beak. Then, Flavia and Dogger overhear a heated argument between Colonel de Luce and a red-headed stranger who shortly turns up {{dead in the}} family cucumber patch. When Colonel de Luce is arrested for the crime, Flavia takes to her bicycle, Gladys, and begins an investigation {{in the village of}} Bishop's Lacey, interviewing suspects, gathering clues, and compiling research at the library, always staying ahead of Inspector Hewitt and the police department. As she single-handedly solves the crime, she uncovers the truth behind a 20-year-old apparent suicide at Colonel de Luce's alma mater, Greyminster. The suicide victim, housemaster and Latin scholar Grenville Twining, and the red-headed stranger in the cucumber patch, Horace [...] "Bony" [...] Bonepenny, both uttered [...] "Vale" [...] as a last word.

2500|$|It {{is set in}} a Grade II listed pink painted Georgian townhouse named Ivy House, in a small seaside town, {{and takes}} its name from the medieval Celtic sport of Cnapan, {{although}} there is little to connect the two today. Dated to the early 19th century, architecturally Ivy House, two-storeys with attic, is described as [...] "painted roughcast, with panelled doorcase and fanlight, <b>the</b> <b>porch</b> <b>with</b> the etiolated, debased classical columns popular all over the region". There are 3 bays on each floor at the front, with a French window on each floor on the western wing, where the restaurant is located. Next door is Sessions House, dated to 1900, but with a stucco front with windows in the late 18th-century style. As of 2001 it had 5 double rooms, a bar, and a restaurant; it is the restaurant for which it has earned its reputation. The interior consists of traditional Welsh oak furnishings. In the hallway is a traditional heavy oak Welsh dresser which contains items belonging to the owners. In the sitting room is a wood-burning stove and books and magazines, and in the dining room is a large stone fireplace, with pictures and pieces of armour on the walls and lace-covered tables. The bedrooms are small, with pine furniture and bright hues, with a [...] "tiny shower". The hotel has been run by the Coopers since 1984; Judith Cooper and her daughter are the chief cooks. [...] It became a Grade II listed building on 14 April 1992.|$|E
