5|$|He {{had been}} {{recommended}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> {{a man of}} energy and enthusiasm, but he seemed shy when we met. It was only on further acquaintance that I noticed other traits. He was extremely good company, with a sharp tongue and an inclination to dismiss most of humanity as spies and traitors. I rather liked that! I discovered he was very ambitious, perhaps more than his abilities warranted, and also very excitable. He sometimes worked himself up into such a state that he lost all powers of reasoning.|$|E
25|$|The amiable Rev. James Sherman, at {{that time}} {{minister}} of Surrey Chapel, with his accustomed kindness took me in his carriage to the dinner; and afterwards, for four months, not only made me his guest, but made his house my home. I never lived so long with any other person, on the same terms. While I live, that dear gentleman will seem <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a most generous fatherly friend.|$|E
25|$|Matisse {{was visiting}} Paris when the Nazis invaded France in June 1940 {{but managed to}} make his way back to Nice. His son, Pierre, by then a gallery owner in New York, begged him to flee while he could. Matisse was about to embark for Brazil to escape the Occupation but changed his mind and {{remained}} in Nice, in Vichy France. “It seemed <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> if I would be deserting,” he wrote Pierre in September 1940. “If everyone who has any value leaves France, what remains of France?” Although he was never a member of the resistance, it became a point of pride to the occupied French that one of their most acclaimed artists chose to stay, though of course, being non-Jewish, he had that option.|$|E

2500|$|The Mishnah {{interpreted}} the words, [...] "there seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be <b>as</b> {{it were a}} plague in the house," [...] in [...] to teach that even a learned sage who knows that he has definitely seen a sign of plague in a house may not speak with certainty. Rather, even the sage must say, [...] "there seems <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be <b>as</b> it were a plague in the house." ...|$|R
500|$|During her {{travels in}} China, Wong {{continued}} to be strongly criticized by the Nationalist government and the film community. She had difficulty communicating {{in many areas of}} China because she was raised with the Taishan dialect rather than Mandarin. She later commented that some of the varieties of Chinese sounded [...] "as strange <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> Gaelic. I thus had the strange experience of talking to my own people through an interpreter." ...|$|E
500|$|Morello {{elaborated}} {{that the}} Nightwatchman is now [...] "my principal musical focus, as I see it, {{for the remainder}} of my life. From the earliest days of playing open mic nights at coffee houses, it was apparent to me that this music was as important <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> any music I've ever been involved in. It really encapsulates everything I want to do as an artist." [...] He repeated this point {{in an interview with the}} Los Angeles Times.|$|E
500|$|Ismay, however, [...] "had a sneaking {{desire to}} be a cavalry soldier", and after doing poorly on his final {{examinations}} at Charterhouse, he was not eligible to attend Cambridge. As a result, he entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, in 1904. Ismay would later write: [...] "Sandhurst never meant nearly so much <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> Charterhouse had", but he enjoyed his time at the school and studied alongside many men who went on to become important military officers, including Lord Gort, Edgar Ludlow-Hewitt and Cyril Newall.|$|E

500|$|Let {{the object}} of affection be {{snatched}} away by death, and how is all the pain ever inflicted upon them avenged! The same imagination that led us to slight or overlook their sufferings, {{now that they are}} forever lost to us, magnifies their estimable qualities ...

While she lived, her existence never seemed necessary to my happiness; but no sooner did I lose her, than it appeared <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> if I could not live without her.|$|E
500|$|Author Katherine V. Forrest claimed Bannon and {{her books}} [...] "are {{in a class}} by themselves" [...] and credits Bannon with saving her life, writing in 2005, [...] "Overwhelming need led me to walk a {{gauntlet}} of fear up to the cash register. Fear so intense that I remember nothing more, only that I stumbled out of the store in possession of what I knew I must have, a book as necessary <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> air... I found it when I was eighteen years old. It opened the door to my soul and told me who I was." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Like most people, I {{had heard}} of Gandhi, but I had never studied him seriously. As I read I became deeply fascinated by his campaigns of nonviolent resistance. I was {{particularly}} moved by his Salt March to the Sea and his numerous fasts. The whole concept of Satyagraha (Satya is truth which equals love, and agraha is force; Satyagraha, therefore, means truth force or love force) was profoundly significant <b>to</b> <b>me.</b> <b>As</b> I delved deeper into the philosophy of Gandhi, my skepticism concerning the power of love gradually diminished, and I came to see {{for the first time}} its potency in the area of social reform." ...|$|E

500|$|Hodgson's lawyer, Julian Young, {{said the}} confessions had been vital {{information}} {{which could have}} freed his client much earlier, and he was shocked police had not acted on it or passed it on. [...] "If it is true these confessions were not followed up by police or passed on to Mr Hodgson's legal team then, or <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> part of the appeal, it is surprising and very disappointing. This may raise {{serious questions about the}} way in which the police operated and their failure or unwillingness to disclose evidence. I did not know seven people made admissions. It would have been highly relevant evidence." ...|$|E
500|$|Restored {{to health}} by {{two weeks at}} the farm he had {{purchased}} in Chappaqua, Greeley returned to the Tribune and a policy of general backing of the Lincoln administration, even having kind words to say about Secretary Seward, his old foe. He was supportive even during the military defeats {{of the first year}} of the war. Late in 1861, he proposed to Lincoln through an intermediary that the president provide him with advance information as to its policies, in exchange for friendly coverage in the Tribune. [...] Lincoln eagerly accepted, [...] "having him firmly behind me will be as helpful <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> an army of one hundred thousand men." ...|$|E

[...] Anne was {{prostrate}} with grief, taking to her chamber. In the evenings, she was carried into the garden [...] "to divert her melancholy thoughts". Gloucester's body was moved from Windsor to Westminster on the night of 1 August, and he lay in state in the Palace of Westminster before being entombed in the Royal Vault of the Henry VII Chapel in Westminster Abbey on 9 August. As was usual for royalty in mourning, his parents did not attend the funeral service, instead remaining in seclusion at Windsor.|$|E

500|$|Harper was harshly {{critical}} of [...] "the inane story line" [...] where Sue regularly accused Will {{of being an}} alcoholic, which Semigran also took exception to. Reiter characterized [...] "Sue throwing Aural Intensity's 'chipper homosexual' choir director down the stairs, twice" [...] as a [...] "false note" [...] {{and said it was}} [...] "particularly difficult to take", though VanDerWerff called it [...] "kind of funny". Semigran was one reviewer who noted that Mercedes was wrong when she [...] "complains that there are no songs that convey alcohol is bad". She suggested [...] "Pink's 'Sober' or Pearl Jam's haunting cover of 'Last Kiss' or Simple Plan's moving '(Untitled) How Could This Happen <b>to</b> <b>Me?</b> <b>as</b> songs that New Directions could have done for the assembly.|$|E
500|$|American author Loretta Chase {{began her}} writing career in 1987 by {{crafting}} traditional novels in the Regency romance literary subgenre; Lord of Scoundrels, published in 1995, was her ninth such novel released. It {{was the third}} installment of her Débauchés (also known as Scoundrels) series, following The Lion's Daughter (1992) and Captives of the Night (1994). As such, some of the characters who feature in Lord of Scoundrels, such as the Comte d'Esmond and Francis Beaumont, also appear in previous Chase works. In 2007, Chase said Lord of Scoundrels was her only book [...] "that came <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> {{a gift from the}} writing gods. Every other book is a struggle, some bloodier than others. This book was pure fun from start to finish".|$|E
500|$|Appearing {{before the}} Judiciary Committee on January 19, Baird apologized for having knowingly broken the law: [...] "In my {{hope to find}} {{appropriate}} child care for my son, I gave too little emphasis to what was described <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> a technical violation of law." [...] She added that, [...] "People are fairly questioning if there are classes of individuals who hold themselves above the law. I do not." [...] Baird's statement {{that her husband had}} handled many of the legal issues surrounding the Corderos' employment drew little support for her. Overall, the questioning of Baird was tougher from Democrats on the committee than Republicans, again reflecting the latter's support for Baird. At the close of the initial testimony, Baird's confirmation still seemed quite possible.|$|E

500|$|In a November 2014 {{cover story}} for Out {{promoting}} The Imitation Game, Cumberbatch opened up about sexual experimentation {{during his time}} in boarding schools stating, [...] "While there was experimentation, {{it had never occurred}} <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as,</b> 'Oh, this is that!' It was just boys and their penises, the same way with girls and vaginas and boobs. It wasn't out of desire." [...] LGBT group Stonewall released a statement praising Cumberbatch's comments, saying, [...] "Seeing someone in the public eye – especially somebody as influential as Benedict – talking positively around gay issues, is powerful for young lesbian, gay and bisexual people. It is often difficult for those growing up to find role models who demonstrate that it is equally okay to be gay or straight." ...|$|E
500|$|Leader {{and founder}} of the Brotherhood, Magneto is a mutant Holocaust {{survivor}} who wages war against humanity in the name of mutant superiority. He has the ability to control and manipulate metal, making him {{one of the most powerful}} mutants. Well-known for his homosexuality, McKellen found a parallel of the cure with many prejudices: [...] "It's abhorrent <b>to</b> <b>me,</b> <b>as</b> it would be if a person said I need curing of my sexuality, or if someone said that black people could take a pill that would 'cure' them of being black." [...] McKellen's shooting schedule had to accommodate his work in both The Da Vinci Code and the London theatre, going as far as filming the actor in England to later superimpose into the Vancouver plates.|$|E
500|$|... "Breathing" [...] {{was written}} by Jason Derulo, Jacob Luttrell, Lauren Christy, Julian Bunetta, Krassimir Tsvetano Kurkchiyski, Shope Trad and Folksong Thrace, while {{production}} of the song was helmed by DJ Frank E. The track was mixed by Manny Marroquin at Larrabee Sound Studios in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, with assistance by Erik Madrid and Chris Galland. Luttrell and Frank E played keyboards on the song, and the drums and synth programming was handled by Frank E. During an interview with Digital Spy, Derulo revealed that the inspiration for [...] "Breathing" [...] came from {{the death of his}} cousin in 2011. He stated, [...] "That song means a lot <b>to</b> <b>me</b> <b>as</b> it's serious and heartfelt". Derulo further explained that [...] "Breathing" [...] was heavily influenced by African chants, eurodance and rock guitar.|$|E
