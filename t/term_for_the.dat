5|$|Since archaeoastronomers {{disagree}} {{so widely}} on {{the characterization of}} the discipline, they even dispute its name. All three major international scholarly associations relate archaeoastronomy {{to the study of}} culture, using the term Astronomy in Culture or a translation.

Ruggles and Saunders proposed Cultural Astronomy as a unifying <b>term</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> various methods of studying folk astronomies. Others have argued that astronomy is an inaccurate term, what are being studied are cosmologies and people who object to the use of logos have suggested adopting the Spanish cosmovisión.|$|E

5|$|The term Cyclone {{was coined}} by Henry Piddington of the British East India Company to {{describe}} the devastating storm of December 1789 in Coringa, India. A cyclone forms around a low-pressure area. Anticyclone, the <b>term</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> kind of weather around a high-pressure area, was coined in 1877 by Francis Galton to indicate an area whose winds revolved {{in the opposite direction}} of a cyclone. In British English, the opposite direction of clockwise is referred to as anticlockwise, making the label anticyclones a logical extension.|$|E

During the course of the office, elections were held in 1994, 2001, 2006, 2010 and on 11 October 2015. Alexander Lukashenko has been the only person who has served as president since the elections in 1994.|$|E

5|$|To {{serve as}} governor, a person {{must be at}} least 30 years old, and must have been a citizen of West Virginia {{for at least five years}} at the time of inauguration.

5|$|Gandhi used fasting as a {{political}} device, often threatening suicide unless demands were met. Congress publicised the fasts as {{a political}} action that generated widespread sympathy. In response the government tried to manipulate news coverage to minimise his challenge to the Raj. He fasted in 1932 to protest the voting scheme for separate political representation for Dalits; Gandhi did not want them segregated. The British government stopped the London press from showing photographs of his emaciated body, because it would elicit sympathy. Gandhi's 1943 hunger strike took place during a two-year prison <b>term</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> anticolonial Quit India movement. The government called on nutritional experts to demystify his action, and again no photos were allowed. However, his final fast in 1948, {{after the end of}} British rule in India, his hunger strike was lauded by the British press and this time did include full-length photos.|$|E

5|$|History {{is often}} {{analyzed}} with contemporary ideologies; Ancient Greece {{as a subject}} enjoyed popularity by the ruling class in Britain during the 19th century. Based on their social priorities, British scholars interpreted ancient Greece as a westernized, white, and masculine society, and essentially removed women from historical importance. Women in Greece were sequestered with each other, and men with men. In this homosocial environment, erotic and sexual relationships between males were common and recorded in literature, art, and philosophy. Hardly anything is recorded about homosexual activity between women. There is some speculation that similar relationships existed between women and girls. The poet Alcman used the term aitis, as the feminine form of aites—which was the official <b>term</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> younger participant in a pederastic relationship. Aristophanes, in Plato's Symposium, mentions women who love women, but uses the term trepesthai (to be focused on) instead of eros, which was applied to other erotic relationships between men, and between men and women.|$|E
5|$|The 13 {{states are}} based on {{historical}} Malay kingdoms, and 9 of the 11 Peninsular states, known as the Malay states, retain their royal families. The King is elected by and from the nine rulers to serve a five-year term. This King appoints governors serving a four-year <b>term</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> states without monarchies, after consultations with the chief minister of that state. Each state has a unicameral legislature known as the State Legislative Assembly, and its own written constitution. Sabah and Sarawak have considerably more autonomy than the other states, most notably having separate immigration policies and controls, and a unique residency status. Federal intervention in state affairs, lack of development, and disputes over oil royalties have occasionally led to statements about secession from leaders in several states such as Johor, Kelantan, Sabah and Sarawak, although these have not been followed up and no serious independence movements exist.|$|E
5|$|The current Constitution of Connecticut, {{ratified}} in 1965, {{calls for}} a four-year <b>term</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> governor, commencing on the Wednesday after the first Monday in the January following an election. The previous constitution of 1818 originally had only a one-year term for governor; this was increased {{to two years in}} 1875, and four years in 1948. The 1875 amendment also set the start date of the term to its current date; before then, it was the first Wednesday in the May following an election. The constitution provides for the election of a lieutenant governor for the same term as the governor. The two offices are elected on the same ticket; this provision was added in 1962. In the event of a vacancy in the office of governor, the lieutenant governor becomes governor. Before the adoption of the 1965 constitution, the lieutenant governor only acted as governor. There is no limit of any kind on the number of terms one may serve.|$|E
