5|$|Combat {{experience}} in the First Sino-Japanese War convinced the Imperial Japanese Navy of weaknesses in the Jeune Ecole naval philosophy, and Japan embarked on a program to modernize and expand its fleet. As with the earlier Fuji-class battleships, Japan lacked the technology and capability to construct its own battleships, and <b>turned</b> <b>again</b> to the United Kingdom. They were ordered {{as part of the}} Ten Year Naval Expansion Programme and paid for from the £30,000,000 indemnity paid by China after losing the Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895.|$|E
5|$|The last {{storm of}} the season was Hurricane Doreen, which formed on October1 off the {{southwest}} Mexican coast. It moved northwestward before curving to the north, although later it <b>turned</b> <b>again</b> to the northwest. Doreen was estimated to have attained peak winds of 85mph (140km/h). On October4, Doreen made its closest approach to {{the southern tip of}} the Baja California peninsula as it began a motion to the northeast. Later that day, the hurricane moved over southern Sonora before dissipating on October5. Hurricane Doreen was responsible for light rainfall in the U.S. states of Arizona, New Mexico, and West Texas.|$|E

5|$|Once Edward's {{force had}} {{gathered}} sufficient strength, {{he dropped the}} ruse and headed south towards London. Fighting off Exeter's and Oxford's attacks, he besieged Warwick at Coventry, hoping to engage the earl in battle. Although Warwick's force had more men than Edward's army, the earl refused the challenge. He {{was waiting for the}} arrival of Clarence, who wanted to use their combined strength to overwhelm the Yorkists. When he learned of this, Edward sent Gloucester to entreat Clarence to return to the House of York, an offer that Clarence readily accepted. Reconciled, the royal brothers moved towards Coventry, and Clarence urged Warwick's surrender. Infuriated with his son-in-law's treachery, Warwick refused to speak to Clarence. Unable to fight the earl at this time, Edward <b>turned</b> <b>again</b> towards London.|$|E
5|$|In 977, as Bakhtiyar {{found himself}} driven from Baghdad by the ambitious 'Adud al-Dawla, he <b>turned</b> <b>again</b> to the Hamdanids for aid. Abu Taghlib agreed {{to support him}} in {{exchange}} for the handing over of Hamdan, who was promptly executed. Although this secured Abu Taghlib's position in his family, it also brought him to the attention of 'Adud al-Dawla. In May 978, Bakhtiyar and Abu Taghlib were defeated in a battle near Samarra by 'Adud al-Dawla. Bakhtiyar himself was captured and executed at the orders of 'Adud al-Dawla, who then advanced on Mosul. Unlike earlier Buyid expeditions against the Hamdanids, that had failed chiefly because they were unable to sustain themselves in the Jazira, this was far better organized, as 'Adud al-Dawla brought along experienced administrators familiar with the area. The Buyids took Mosul and forced Abu Taghlib to flee to Mayyafariqin and then to the mountains of Armenia; while the Buyids laid siege to Mayyafariqin, he even visited Skleros in Byzantine territory in Anzitene, trying to secure his assistance, but in vain, for Skleros too was hard-pressed by the loyalist general Bardas Phokas. After the fall of Mayyafariqin in 978, Abu Taghlib fled to Rahba, from where he tried in vain to negotiate with 'Adud al-Dawla.|$|E
5|$|The 1891 census {{records the}} Wildes' {{residence}} at 16 Tite Street, {{where he lived}} with his wife Constance and two sons. Wilde though, not content with being better known than ever in London, returned to Paris in October 1891, this time as a respected writer. He was received at the salons littéraires, including the famous mardis of Stéphane Mallarmé, a renowned symbolist poet of the time. Wilde's two plays during the 1880s, Vera; or, The Nihilists and The Duchess of Padua, had not met with much success. He had continued his interest in the theatre and now, after finding his voice in prose, his thoughts <b>turned</b> <b>again</b> to the dramatic form as the biblical iconography of Salome filled his mind. One evening, after discussing depictions of Salome throughout history, he returned to his hotel and noticed a blank copybook lying on the desk, and it occurred to him to write in it what he had been saying. The result was a new play, Salomé, written rapidly and in French.|$|E

5|$|The ITCZ became {{active in}} the middle of March {{northeast}} of Madagascar, which spawned two low pressure areas on March15. The westernmost became a tropical disturbance on the next day between Madagascar and Tromelin. It quickly intensified while tracking to the southwest and was named Justine on March17. On March18, the storm intensified into tropical cyclone status and developed a well-defined eye. At 15:00UTC that day, Justine moved ashore northeastern Madagascar near Sambava. It continued southwestward and weakened over the island, emerging into the Mozambique Channel near Besalampy as a tropical storm. It re-intensified into a tropical cyclone over waters, reaching peak winds of 150km/h (95mph) on March22 only 20km (12mi) offshore Mozambique. That day, a ridge over southern Africa steered Justine to the southeast away from land, although the ridge weakened and allowed the storm to move back to the west-southwest. It weakened to a tropical storm during this time. The storm <b>turned</b> <b>again</b> to the southeast on March24 after the ridge moved to the east. Justine passed north of Europa Island before striking Madagascar again early on March25 just north of Toliara. It became extratropical over land, and soon again reached open waters while turning to the south. Justine dissipated on March27 within the flow of the westerlies.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the tables}} {{of the war}} quickly <b>turned</b> <b>again</b> when the newly {{appointed}} Byzantine supreme-commander Maurice entered the field and captured many Sasanian settlements.

Peace negotiations were once again brought back up, but abruptly ended with the death of Khosrow in 579, who was succeeded by his son Hormizd IV.|$|E

25|$|The Roman mission's {{efforts were}} met with success and King Boris asked Pope Nicholas I to appoint Formosa of Portua as Bulgarian Archbishop.

25|$|Today {{the federal}} {{government}} has stuck with modernist simplicity for its functional buildings, but has <b>turned</b> <b>again</b> to monumental architecture for projects of national significance. Most notable are the three museums that have been built in the national capital over the last three decades. The new homes of the Canadian Museum of Civilization, National Gallery of Canada, and the Canadian War Museum are unique examples of postmodern architecture. All cost vast amounts of money, but they have also met with international acclaim. They also have allowed the capital to become a showcase for buildings by three of Canada's most prominent architects: Moshe Safdie, Douglas Cardinal, and Raymond Moriyama.|$|E
25|$|In the 1880s once {{electromagnetism}} {{was better}} understood, interest <b>turned</b> <b>again</b> {{to the problem}} of aberration. By this time flaws were known to both Fresnel's and Stokes' theories. Fresnel's theory required that the relative velocity of aether and matter to be different for light of different colors, and it was shown that the boundary conditions Stokes had assumed in his theory were inconsistent with his assumption of irrotational flow. At the same time, the modern theories of electromagnetic aether could not account for aberration at all. Many scientists such as Maxwell, Heaviside and Hertz unsuccessfully attempted to solve these problems by incorporating either Fresnel or Stokes' theories into Maxwell's new electromagnetic laws.|$|E

25|$|The {{demand for}} the {{products}} manufactured in the Jewellery Quarter peaked in 1920 and a steady decline started. The Quarter was hard hit by the Great Depression and struggled to recover after. Some companies constructed large factories {{as they tried to}} diversify their businesses. In World War II, manufacture <b>turned</b> <b>again</b> to munitions and this led to the Jewellery Quarter becoming a target of bombing raids by the Luftwaffe in the Birmingham Blitz. Like the rest of Birmingham, this brought a lot of damage to the Jewellery Quarter. St Paul's Church was damaged and was repaired between 1949 and 1951 to a design by J. B. Surman. In November 1940, Thomas Walker plc's 1934 factory in St Paul's Square was destroyed but rebuilt 18 months later.|$|E
25|$|In the Abbey of Saint-Denis, the 40-year-old Abelard {{sought to}} bury {{himself as a}} monk with his woes out of sight. Finding no respite in the cloister, and having {{gradually}} <b>turned</b> <b>again</b> to study, he gave in to urgent entreaties, and reopened his school at an unknown priory owned by the monastery. His lectures, now framed in a devotional spirit, and with lectures on theology {{as well as his}} previous lectures on logic, were once again heard by crowds of students, and his old influence seemed to have returned. Using his studies of the Bible and — in his view — inconsistent writings {{of the leaders of the}} church as his basis, he wrote Sic et non (Yes and No).|$|E
25|$|These are folded down, so {{that the}} paper lies {{on the surface of}} the inked type. The bed is rolled under the platen, using a {{windlass}} mechanism. A small rotating handle is used called the 'rounce' to do this, and the impression is made with a screw that transmits pressure through the platen. To turn the screw the long handle attached to it is turned. This is known as the bar or 'Devil's Tail.' In a well-set-up press, the springiness of the paper, frisket, and tympan caused the bar to spring back and raise the platen, the windlass <b>turned</b> <b>again</b> to move the bed back to its original position, the tympan and frisket raised and opened, and the printed sheet removed. Such presses were always worked by hand. After around 1800, iron presses were developed, some of which could be operated by steam power.|$|E

25|$|Tulsa {{played their}} second {{straight}} Wednesday game on October 21, {{traveling to the}} Sun Bowl {{to take on a}} team they had defeated in a 77–35 shootout the previous season. This time, the Miners were better prepared, building up a 13-0 lead in the first quarter. However, the momentum appeared to shift in the second after Tulsa got on the board with a 19-yard run from A.J. Whitmore and two long UTEP drives were ended by interceptions. The Golden Hurricane continued to roll after halftime, scoring 17 straight to take an 11-point lead. Tulsa appeared set to cruise to another easy win, but the tide of the game <b>turned</b> <b>again</b> {{in the middle of the}} fourth quarter when UTEP finally got their offense back in gear and cut the deficit to 3 with a touchdown and two-point conversion. After Tulsa went three-and-out on their next possession, the Miners drove down the field again to score the game-winning touchdown with 29 seconds remaining.|$|E
25|$|Thomas waged a war {{throughout}} his reign with the Serbian Despotate over the lucrative mining town of Srebrenica and its surroundings, {{in addition to}} (or in conjunction with) multiple conflicts with his father-in-law. Moreover, he had a tense relationship with the menacing Ottoman Empire. After years of skirmishes and raids, Thomas appeared willing to lead the Christian coalition against the Turks but received no assistance from fellow Christian rulers. Having failed to expand into Croatia proper, Thomas <b>turned</b> <b>again</b> to the east in 1458, arranging a match between his son Stephen and the Serbian heiress Helena. The Bosnian control over {{the remnants of the}} Serbian Despotate lasted merely a month before the Ottoman conquest of the state. King Thomas' failure to defend Serbia permanently damaged his reputation in Europe. Wishing to improve his image among Europe's Catholics, Thomas turned against the Bosnian Church, thus becoming the first ruler of Bosnia to engage in religious persecution.|$|E
25|$|In 786 the Muslim caliph, Abd-er Rahman I, {{began the}} {{construction}} of the great mosque of Cordova, now a cathedral, and compelled many Christians {{to take part in the}} preparation of the site and foundations. The executions of the martyrs caused tension not only between Muslims and Christians, but within the Christian community. Abd er-Rahmán II at first ordered the arrest and detention of the clerical leadership of the local Christian community. As the civil disobedience seemed to subside, the clergy were released in November 851. When several months later there was a new wave of protests, the emir <b>turned</b> <b>again</b> to the Christian leaders as the ones most capable of controlling the Christian community. Instead of imprisoning them, he ordered them to convene a council in Córdoba to review the matter and develop some strategy for dealing with the dissidents internally. He gave the bishops a choice: Christians could stop the public dissent or face harassment, loss of jobs, and economic hardship. Upon the death of Abd-er Rahman II in 852, his son and successor, Muhammad I removed all Christian officials from their palace appointments.|$|E
