5|$|In {{response}} to Thio's {{point on the}} views of <b>the</b> <b>Wee</b> Chong Jin Constitutional Commission, Shanmugam said {{that at the time}} the report was rendered the electorate was immature and unfamiliar with the importance of voting, a result of the country's history of colonial rule. In contrast, the high voter turnout rates in every election since then evidenced that Singaporeans have realized this point. With regard to the Taw Cheng Kong case, Shanmugam stated that since the Court's observations were obiter, they were unlikely to be treated as setting a precedent.|$|E

5|$|In 1938, Reagan co-starred in {{the film}} Brother Rat with actress Jane Wyman (1917–2007). They were engaged at the Chicago Theatre, and married on January 26, 1940, at <b>the</b> <b>Wee</b> Kirk o' the Heather church in Glendale, California. Together they had two {{biological}} children, Maureen (1941–2001) and Christine (who was born in 1947 but only lived one day), and adopted a third, Michael (born March 18, 1945). After arguments about Reagan's political ambitions, Wyman filed for divorce in 1948, citing a distraction due to her husband's Screen Actors Guild union duties; the divorce was finalized in 1949. Wyman, who was a registered Republican, also stated that their break-up was due to a difference in politics (Reagan was still a Democrat at the time).|$|E
5|$|The Singaporean Parliament is unicameral in nature, {{consisting}} of a single legislative body tasked with making laws. However, {{the notion of a}} second legislative chamber was considered on two separate occasions. In 1954, a constitutional commission headed by Sir George William Rendel rejected a proposal for a second chamber composed solely of minority representatives, citing its unsuitability in a tiny state like Singapore and arguing that it might end up being unnecessarily bureaucratic. It also asserted that such an upper House might potentially be detrimental to social cohesion. This issue was also considered by <b>the</b> <b>Wee</b> Chong Jin Commission, which rejected it on similar grounds.|$|E

These stories are patchy in style, including some where more realistically drawn characters mix with his cartoon figures, but give more examples of Neill's quirky humour and fine touch with pen and lamp-black ink.|$|E
