5|$|Issues {{regarding}} {{debt and}} revenue-sharing within <b>the</b> <b>Netherlands</b> Antilles {{eventually led to}} the dissolution of the territory and its division as constituent islands Curaçao and Sint Maarten claimed a status of autonomy similar to that of Aruba, while the islands Bonaire, Saba, and Sint Eustatius were absorbed directly into <b>the</b> <b>Netherlands.</b> Thus, the 2008 Summer Olympics served as the final Olympics games in which <b>the</b> <b>Netherlands</b> Antilles participated as a territory. The future of the Dutch Antillean athletes to participate in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London were cast into doubt as a result. As residents of <b>the</b> <b>Netherlands</b> Antilles hold Dutch passports, IAAF General Secretary Pierre Weiss remarked all former Dutch Antillean athletes should immediately become eligible to represent <b>the</b> <b>Netherlands</b> in <b>the</b> <b>Netherlands</b> Antilles' stead. Ultimately, however, the IOC decided in its 123rd session upon three items: that former Dutch Antillean athletes would compete independently under the Olympic flag; that recognition for <b>the</b> <b>Netherlands</b> Antilles' Olympic Committee was to be withdrawn; and that a temporary administrative structure would serve in the Dutch Antillean NOC's place until after the 2012 London games, directly supervised and supported by the IOC.|$|E
