500|$|On June 8, 2012, Ocean {{posted on}} his tumblr a cryptic, almost two-minute video, {{promoting}} an unknown project which was titled Channel Orange. The clip featured an expensive-looking car, {{and it also}} contained new music. Later that day Ocean posted the full song used in the video, titled [...] "Pyramids" [...] onto his SoundCloud account. Popdust noted that [...] "trailers won’t tell you everything. For example, the brief snippet of Frank Ocean’s new track “Pyramids” heard in an ambiguous trailer {{a few days ago}} left out one key detail of the track: <b>the</b> <b>damn</b> <b>thing</b> is 10 minutes long." [...] The cover artwork for the single features sexual Simpsons characters.|$|E
500|$|When the Beatles {{recorded}} [...] "Twist and Shout", {{the final}} track during the mammoth one-day session {{that produced the}} band's 1963 debut album, Please Please Me, Lennon's voice, already compromised by a cold, came close to giving out. Lennon said, [...] "I couldn't sing <b>the</b> <b>damn</b> <b>thing,</b> I was just screaming." [...] In the words of biographer Barry Miles, [...] "Lennon simply shredded his vocal cords {{in the interests of}} rock 'n' roll." [...] The Beatles' producer, George Martin, tells how Lennon [...] "had an inborn dislike of his own voice which I could never understand. He was always saying to me: 'DO something with my voice!... put something on it... Make it different.'" [...] Martin obliged, often using double-tracking and other techniques.|$|E

500|$|North's low {{academic}} {{results have}} led to criticism. In February 2007 Minneapolis City Council member Don Samuels suggested burning North down. [...] "My children will not darken {{the door of a}} Minneapolis public school in this city at this time under these conditions. I've said burn North High School down! I can't be paying as a taxpayer for the education of my neighbors and 72 percent of them are failing—meaning black boys. Something worse than vouchers could come along. If it works, if it sacrifices the entire school system, fine! Get rid of <b>the</b> <b>damn</b> <b>thing!</b> It hasn't worked!" [...] His suggestion caused uproar in the community, and his remarks were heavily criticized. Samuels later apologized for the [...] "extreme language" [...] but stated that he did not regret making the comments.|$|E
500|$|The second single was {{originally}} intended to be [...] "You Got the Damn Thing" [...] before being changed to [...] "Are U Capable", which was released on vinyl, on July 3, 2001, and promoted with a music video. Rashaun Hall from Billboard gave the single a positive review, saying that it: [...] "may be the song that sets her career ablaze". [...] "You Got <b>the</b> <b>Damn</b> <b>Thing</b> (I Like) Remix", a remix of the album track [...] "You Got the Damn Thing", was later released separately and was treated as {{the third and final}} single from the album. Olivia made appearances on television and on live shows to promote her debut album. Before the album's release, she performed [...] "Bizounce" [...] on Soul Train, BET, MTV's hip-hop video block Sucker Free (known at the time as DFX), and The Source Sound Lab. On February 11, 2001, she embarked on a promotional tour, leading up to the album's release on May 15, 2001.|$|E
500|$|Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter {{praised the}} film, saying, [...] "It sounds kooky on paper {{but on the}} screen cowboys and aliens make beautiful, fun music together." [...] Honeycutt felt {{that the success of}} the film's blend of aliens and western themes was due to [...] "the {{determination}} by everyone involved to play <b>the</b> <b>damn</b> <b>thing</b> straight. Even the slightest goofiness, the tiniest touch of camp, and the whole thing would blow sky high. But it doesn't." [...] He criticized the aliens, which he said [...] "don't rate as characters", existing as [...] "moving blobs you shoot at in a video game." [...] Varietys Peter Debruge echoed Honeycutt's sentiments that the [...] "potential hamminess" [...] of the premise is offset by the cast, particularly Craig through a [...] "mix of ruthlessness and sensitivity." [...] He considered however, that Wilde had the opposite effect, stating she [...] "appears out of place among her grizzled co-stars". Debruge appreciated the attention paid to the roots of the two genres, saying [...] "beneath all the state-of-the-art special effects beats an old-fashioned heart, one that prizes both of the genres in play" [...] and concluded that [...] "a canny blend of CG and practical effects serve the sci-fi elements well, while location shooting and Mary Zophres' form-fitting period duds make the West look its best." [...] Nick Pinkerton of The Village Voice said the Western elements of the film were [...] "lovingly" [...] handled but called felt the science aspects a [...] "gimmick" [...] and [...] "much more standard fare" [...] in comparison. He added that [...] "Ford, enlivened by dude garb, seems to enjoy himself {{in front of a camera}} for the first time in decades".|$|E

2500|$|When Philip Sheridan {{was asked}} {{to comment on the}} building, his biting reply echoed the {{negative}} sentiment of much of the Washington establishment of the day: [...] "Too bad <b>the</b> <b>damn</b> <b>thing</b> is fireproof."

2500|$|Campbell, however, {{had little}} luck {{overcoming}} the tremendous antipathy toward Mulroney, despite a substantial bounce from the leadership convention. Chrétien saw an opportunity, and on September 19, released the entire Liberal platform. The 112-page document, Creating Opportunity, quickly {{became known as}} the Red Book because of its bright red cover. It was a very specific and detailed statement of exactly what a Chrétien government would do in office. The Red Book gave the Liberals the reputation as the party with ideas, since none of the other parties had anything comparable. Paul Martin, the man who led the team that produced the Red Book was less complimentary about the Red Book in private as during his time in office as Finance Minister, he was often reported to have said: [...] "Don't tell me about the Red Book, I wrote <b>the</b> <b>damn</b> <b>thing,</b> and I know that it is a lot of crap!".|$|E
2500|$|In December 1953, Jackson {{suffered}} a heart attack, {{as a result of}} which directing animator Eric Larson of Disney's Nine Old Men took over as director. By April 1954, Sleeping Beauty was scheduled for a February 1957 release. With Larson as the director, Disney instructed Larson, whose unit would animate the forest sequence, that the picture was to be a [...] "moving illustration, the ultimate in animation" [...] and added that he did not care how long it would take. Because of the delays, the release date was again pushed back from Christmas 1957 to Christmas 1958. Fellow Nine Old Men Milt Kahl would blame Walt for the numerous release delays because [...] "he wouldn’t have story meetings. He wouldn't get <b>the</b> <b>damn</b> <b>thing</b> moving." [...] Relatively late in production, Disney removed Larson as the supervising director and replaced him with Clyde Geronimi. Directing animator Wolfgang Reitherman would join Geronimi as sequence director over the climactic dragon battle sequence commenting that [...] "We took the approach {{that we were going to}} kill that damned prince!". Les Clark, another member of the Nine Old Men, would serve as the sequence director of the elaborate opening scene where crowds of the citizens in the kingdom arrive at the palace for the presentation of Princess Aurora.|$|E

50|$|Ironiclast is {{the debut}} album the American heavy metal {{supergroup}} <b>The</b> <b>Damned</b> <b>Things.</b> <b>The</b> album {{was released on}} December 14, 2010 internationally and a day later in North America. The supergroup includes Joe Trohman and Andy Hurley of Fall Out Boy, Scott Ian and Rob Caggiano of Anthrax and Keith Buckley and Josh Newton of Every Time I Die. Newton, however, was only a touring member of <b>The</b> <b>Damned</b> <b>Things</b> initially, and did not write or record anything for Ironiclast. The album was self-produced by Caggiano and Trohman, and was released through Mercury Records.|$|R
2500|$|Left unimpressed, Marc Savlov of The Austin Chronicle wrote, [...] "You {{really have}} to feel for Alex Proyas. This guy wears bad luck like the grimy trenchcoats of his protagonists, only his zipper's stuck and he can't seem to shake <b>the</b> <b>damn</b> <b>thing</b> off." [...] In expressing his negativity, he {{believed}} [...] "Dark City looks like a million bucks (or rather, a million bucks gone to compost), but at its dark heart it's a tedious, bewildering affair, lovely to look at {{but with all the}} substance of a dissipating dream." [...] Left equally disappointed was John Anderson of the Los Angeles Times. Commenting on the directing, he thought [...] "If you had to guess, you might say that Proyas came out of the world of comic art himself, rather than music videos and advertising. Dark City is constructed like panels in a Batman book, each picture striving for maximum dread." [...] He went on to say, Proyas was [...] "trying simultaneously to create a pure thriller and sci-fi nightmare along with his tongue-in-cheek critique of artifice. And this doesn't work out quite so well." [...] Author TCh of Time Out, felt the development of the Murdoch character was [...] "surprisingly engrossing" [...] and thought production wise, the [...] "art direction is always striking, and unlike most contemporary sci-fi, the movie does risk a cerebral approach, tapping a vein of postmodern paranoia." ...|$|E
2500|$|Raging Bull {{came about}} when De Niro read the [...] {{on the set}} of The Godfather Part II. Although {{disappointed}} by the book's writing style, he became fascinated by the character of Jake LaMotta. He showed the book to Martin Scorsese {{on the set of}} Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore in the hope that he would consider the project. Scorsese repeatedly turned down the opportunity to sit in the director's chair, claiming {{he had no idea what}} Raging Bull was about, even though he had read some of the text. Never a sports fan, when he found out what LaMotta used to do for a living, he said, [...] "A boxer? I don't like boxing...Even as a kid, I always thought that boxing was boring... It was something I couldn't, wouldn't grasp." [...] His overall opinion of sport in general is, [...] "Anything with a ball, no good." [...] The book was then passed onto Mardik Martin, the film's eventual co-screenwriter, who said [...] "the trouble is <b>the</b> <b>damn</b> <b>thing</b> has been done a hundred times before—a fighter who has trouble with his brother and his wife and the mob is after him". The book was even shown to producers Robert Chartoff and Irwin Winkler by De Niro, who were willing to assist only if Scorsese agreed. After nearly dying from a drug overdose, Scorsese agreed to make the film, not only to save his own life but also to save his career. Scorsese began to relate very personally to the story of Jake LaMotta, and in it he saw how the boxing ring can be [...] "an allegory for whatever you do in life”, which for him paralleled moviemaking, “you make movies, you’re in the ring each time.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Cracks and {{fissures}} had {{again become}} visible between the 1st SA Div and the Army command. 1st SA Brigade had been deployed on the flank, on Ruweisat Ridge {{and by this}} time they had become somewhat isolated during the previous days fighting and the Allied bombing missions of the previous night. The Brigade had lost its Officer Commanding {{as well as its}} Brigade Major during the previous two days fighting and over 15,000 shells had fallen on their strongpoint, known as [...] "Hotbox," [...] from the area of the Trieste Division. Pienaar advised Norrie that their position was [...] "untenable" [...] and Norrie replied that if that was the case, he would [...] "..... relieve the Brigade, place it in reserve and replace it with another formation." [...] Offended by this [...] Pienaar called 8th Army HQ and was advised by Dorman-Smith that the Brigade was to remain where it was. [...] Not satisfied, Pienaar insisted on speaking to Auchinleck, who ordered that the Brigade hold its ground – but offered to relieve the Brigade within two days when the 9th Australian Division reached El Alamein. [...] Pienaar's demands of the evening of 2 July shook the 8th Army command’s confidence in the morale of the division and Auchinleck stated that the division could no longer be exposed to [...] "undue operational strain," [...] fearing that material losses to the division, especially after the surrender of the 2nd SA Division at Tobruk, would lead to political disaster. [...] Auchinleck deployed the 9th Australian Division to re-enforce the northern sector of the line held by the South Africans three days later. Pienaar had also been falsely accused of supporting the retreat to the Delta and engaging the Axis from behind the Suez Canal – he remained resolved to fight, stating to an American war correspondent at Alam Halfa in July 1942 [...] "....Here I stop, I've retreated far enough, whether we hold <b>the</b> <b>damn</b> <b>thing</b> or not!" ...|$|E
