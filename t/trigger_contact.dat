50|$|Older cameras still {{equipped}} with an electro-mechanical <b>trigger</b> <b>contact</b> may exhibit yet another problem. If they provide both, an ISO hotshoe and a PC terminal, both are typically wired to the same <b>trigger</b> <b>contact</b> in the camera rather than triggered independently as in cameras with electronic triggering circuits. When only the PC terminal is used and the hotshoe remains un-populated, a flash with high trigger circuit voltages connected to the PC terminal delivers this voltage on the normally unprotected middle contact of the camera's ISO hotshoe. If the photographer's eyebrows accidentally get {{into contact with the}} middle contact, the electrical shock can cause pain or even injuries. One way camera manufacturers have used to avoid this problem was to use two independent trigger contacts, which, however, could cause flash synchronization problems. Another, as utilized by Minolta in all such cameras supporting a PC terminal, was to add a small hidden contact {{on the side of the}} ISO hotshoe, which would disable the middle contact until some equipment was mounted in the hotshoe, thereby avoiding any possible contact with the operator's eyebrows as well.|$|E

30|$|Medium-size soluble polyP 60 – 80 are {{released}} by activated platelets and mast cells. They {{are able to}} induce FXII activation only if large amounts are present [34, 35]. PolyP 60 – 80 could also bind α-FXIIa preventing further degradation, resulting in prolonged half-life. In the presence of fibrin polymers associated with polyP 60 – 80, α-FXIIa can activate fibrin-bound plasminogen in plasmin, resulting in “intrinsic” fibrinolytic activity overcoming antifibrinolytic properties [36, 37]. Interestingly, activated platelets could retain polyP 60 – 80 on their surface assembled into insoluble spherical nanoparticles with divalent metal ions (Ca 2 +, Zn 2 +). These nanoparticles provide higher polymer size and become able to <b>trigger</b> <b>contact</b> system activation [38, 39].|$|E
50|$|LiPo packs {{also see}} {{widespread}} use in airsoft, where their higher discharge currents and better energy density compared to more traditional NiMH batteries has very noticeable performance gain (higher rate of fire). The high discharge currents do damage the switch contacts due to arcing (causing the contacts to oxidize and often deposit carbon), {{so it is}} advised to either use a solid-state MOSFET switch or clean the <b>trigger</b> <b>contacts</b> regularly.|$|R

Some older flashes may have significantly high voltages, sometimes in the several hundreds of volts. Some of them may also use negative DC polarity, and some studio flashes may even provide AC voltages. Whilst no problem for electromechanical <b>trigger</b> <b>contacts</b> in older cameras, not all electronically controlled trigger circuits in newer cameras are designed to work with inverse DC polarity or AC.|$|R
50|$|There is recoil {{associated}} with the discharge of a nail from a nail gun. <b>Contact</b> <b>triggers</b> allow the gun to fire unintended nails if the nose hits the wood surface or a previously placed nail following recoil. Nailers with touch tip (<b>contact)</b> <b>triggers</b> are susceptible to this double firing. According to a 2002 engineering report from the Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC), the recoil and firing of the second nail occurs well before the trigger can be released. Acute injury rates are twice as high among users of tools with <b>contact</b> <b>triggers.</b>|$|R
40|$|Thermal Knudsen forces {{arise in}} {{microsystem}} in a rarefied gas environment with a thermal gradient. They {{are caused by}} non-equilibrium energy exchange between gas molecules and solid surfaces. This study explores the possibility of utilizing the Knudsen force to deflect microstructures and <b>trigger</b> <b>contact</b> for applications in microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Actuation experiments performed in a low-pressure environment by creating a significant thermal gradient across a thin beam suspended over a substrate are presented and used to validate a computational framework. The computational framework solves an approximate form of the Boltzmann equation using a parallel, unstructured finite volume solver developed in C++. The experiments show that {{the magnitude of the}} Knudsen force produced on a beam with a thermal gradient across it is significantly higher than that on a uniformly heated beam with both sides of the beam at the same temperature. It is also demonstrated that the direction of force on the beam is controllable making it a suitable candidate for MEMS applications. The validated numerical framework presents a design tool for bi-directional actuators using a wide range of thermal configurations and ambient gas pressures. ...|$|E

Modelling this interaction represents a significant computational challenge.

In this paper a novel approach is presented that aims to account for the uncertainties associated with the non-linearity in a non-probabilistic way. The worst case is sought, by framing the system as a constrained anti-optimisation problem. The target to be maximised represents a metric of the output of interest. The degrees of freedom of the anti-optimisation are the non-linear input forces (considered as external loads), and the constraints are designed to capture what is thought to be known about the non-linear contact law and geometry. A realistic three-dimensional model of a turbine blade is used to explore the approach, with contact considered at the leading and trailing edge. The blade dynamics are described in terms of a linear transfer function matrix and the target metric of interest is chosen to be the peak displacement of the contact points. The non-linearity is taken to result from an offset shaft, giving a sinusoidal clearance variation. The blade is driven at constant frequency and the scope of the study is limited to finding bounds on periodic solutions. A variety of constraint conditions are explored that describe aspects of the non-linearity. For example, only compressive forces are permitted (no tension from the contact), and the displacement must not exceed the clearance. The method yields encouraging initial results: constraints can be identified that give efficient estimates of the upper bound response of the system as a function of drive frequency. The results are compared with a benchmark time-domain simulation and are found to correctly over-predict the response without being overly conservative. Broad trends are also in agreement with the benchmark solution. The proposed method appears to be a promising approach for efficiently accounting for uncertainties associated with the non-linearity and thus improving blade design...|$|E

40|$|Aim. The aim of {{this study}} was to make a new {{contribution}} to the subject of prurigo and pruritus sine materia with or with-out scratching-related lesions, and to assess any correlation with allergic contact sensitivity. Methods. The study was conducted on 104 patients with symp-toms of pruritus, excluding cases of definite dermatosis. After making a detailed anamnesis, the patients were administered a battery of biohumoral tests designed to establish their general state of health. Skin tests were performed if the patient’s medical history. Patients who were positive on the allergic contact lf sensitivity test were informed about methods of avoiding contact with the haptens concerned and were followed-up for at least 3 months. No medication was administered. Results. Thirty-seven of the S 3 patients tested positive for allergic contact sensitivity. At the final check-up, 15 of the above 37 patients presented complete objective and subjective remission. Conclusion. Our study concludes with the finding that latent contact sensitivity dissociated from clinically overt allergic contact dermatitis was present in 70 % of surveyed patients. We do not believe that this is a random association; rather, it is our opinion that subliminal or minimal, exogenous or endogenous exposure may elicit pruritus without actually <b>triggering</b> <b>contact</b> eczematous dermatitis.
