5|$|Dale Russell {{hypothesized}} that the more lightly built and more common Gorgosaurus may have preyed on the abundant hadrosaurs of the <b>time,</b> <b>while</b> the more robust and less common Daspletosaurus may have specialized on the less prevalent but better-defended ceratopsids, {{which may have been}} more difficult to hunt. However, a specimen of Daspletosaurus (OTM 200) from the Two Medicine Formation preserves the digested remains of a juvenile hadrosaur in its gut region. The higher and broader muzzles of tyrannosaurines like Daspletosaurus are mechanically stronger than the lower snouts of albertosaurines like Gorgosaurus, although tooth strengths are similar between the two groups. This may indicate a difference in feeding mechanics or diet.|$|E
