25|$|Despite its {{reputation}} for poor audio quality, the mobile <b>telephone</b> <b>industry</b> {{has started to}} make some progress on wideband audio. The 3GPP standards group has designated G.722.2 as its wideband codec and calls it Adaptive Multirate – Wideband (AMR-WB). A few handsets have been produced supporting this codec (for example, HTC, Nokia , Samsung and Sony), and network demonstrations have been conducted.|$|E

25|$|Bell {{did for the}} {{telephone}} what Henry Ford did for the automobile. Although {{not the first to}} experiment with telephonic devices, Bell and the companies founded in his name were the first to develop commercially practical telephones around which a successful business could be built and grow. Bell adopted carbon transmitters similar to Edison's transmitters and adapted telephone exchanges and switching plug boards developed for telegraphy. Watson and other Bell engineers invented numerous other improvements to telephony. Bell succeeded where others failed to assemble a commercially viable telephone system. It can be argued that Bell invented the <b>telephone</b> <b>industry.</b> Bell's first intelligible voice transmission over an electric wire was named an IEEE Milestone.|$|E
25|$|The origins can {{be traced}} back to 1876, when Elisha Gray lost his race to invent the telephone. Alexander Graham Bell put in a patent {{application}} just hours before Gray filed one. Gray nevertheless left his mark on the <b>telephone</b> <b>industry</b> in 1869 when he and Enos N. Barton formed Gray and Barton, a small manufacturing firm in Cleveland, Ohio. Three years later, the firm, now based in Chicago, was renamed the Western Electric Manufacturing Co. By 1880 it was the largest electrical manufacturing company in the US. A year later when growth of the telephone network was outstripping the capacity of smaller suppliers, American Bell purchased a controlling interest in Western Electric Company and made it the exclusive manufacturer of equipment for the Bell telephone companies. Western Electric Company was responsible for developing as well as manufacturing Bell equipment. In 1907, Theodore N. Vail combined the AT and Western Electric engineering departments into a single organization that became Bell Labs in 1925. Western Electric became the manufacturing arm of the Bell System.|$|E

50|$|Because {{the chips}} in {{financial}} cards {{are the same}} as those used in subscriber identity modules (SIMs) in mobile phones, programmed differently and embedded in a different piece of PVC, chip manufacturers are building to the more demanding GSM/3G standards.

This allows for smaller and cheaper financial card terminals.|$|R
