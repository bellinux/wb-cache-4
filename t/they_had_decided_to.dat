5|$|Having {{completed}} work on Oblivion in 2006, Bethesda Game Studios {{began work}} on Fallout 3. It was during this time that the team began planning their next The Elder Scrolls game. From the outset, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> set the new entry {{in the land of}} Skyrim, incorporating dragons into the main theme of the game. Full development begun following the release of Fallout 3 in 2008; the developers considered Skyrim a spiritual successor to both Fallout 3 and previous The Elder Scrolls games. The game was developed by a team of roughly 100 people composed of new talent {{as well as of the}} series' veterans. The production was supervised by Todd Howard, who was the director of several titles released by Bethesda Softworks.|$|E

5|$|On 23 February 2004, the U.S. Army {{announced}} that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> terminate all {{work on the}} Comanche program. At the time, it was stated that the Army had determined {{that a number of}} upgrades would be necessary in order for the RAH-66 to be capable of surviving on the battlefield in the face of current anti-aircraft threats; however, the Army had instead decided to re-direct the bulk of its funding for rotary development toward the renovation of its existing helicopter fleet of attack, utility, and reconnaissance aircraft. Specifically, the Army also had plans to reuse the funds allocated to the Comanche program to speed up development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which could also perform the scouting role intended for the vehicle. At the time of its termination, the Comanche program had reportedly spent US$6.9billion. The contract termination fees involved were estimated to total US$450â€“680million for the main program partners Sikorsky and Boeing.|$|E
5|$|Upon the Beatles' {{return to}} England, rumours began to {{circulate}} that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> break up. Harrison informed Epstein {{that he was}} leaving the band, but was persuaded {{to stay on the}} assurance {{that there would be no}} more tours. The group took a three-month break, during which they focused on individual interests. Harrison travelled to India for six weeks to study the sitar under the instruction of Ravi Shankar and develop his interest in Hindu philosophy. Having been the last of the Beatles to concede that their live performances had become futile, Paul McCartney collaborated with Beatles producer George Martin on the soundtrack for the film The Family Way. Lennon acted in the film How I Won the War and attended art showings, such as one at the Indica Gallery where he met his future wife Yoko Ono. Ringo Starr used the break to spend time with his wife Maureen and son Zak.|$|E
5|$|By August 1967, Baer and Harrison had {{completed}} a third prototype machine, but {{had found that}} to even come near to Baer's initial aim of a US$20 or $25 console would require {{so much to be}} excluded that the resulting console would not be very enjoyable. Baer additionally felt that he was not proving successful at designing fun games for the system; to make up for this he formally added Bill Rusch, who had helped him come up with the initial games for the console, to the project. Though the pair found Rusch difficult to work with, he soon proved his value to the team by coming {{up with a way to}} display three spots on the screen at once rather than the previous two, and proposing the development of a ping pong game. By November the team, now on their fourth prototype machine, had a ping pong game, a chasing game, a light gun game, and three types of controllers: joysticks for the chase game, a rifle for the light gun game, and a three dial controller for the ping pong game. Campman felt that the system was advanced enough to begin trying to find a manufacturer to buy it; <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> aim for selling the rights to produce the console, as Sanders was not in the business of making and selling commercial electronics.|$|E

These were â€˜Imperial Bushmenâ€™ units, which were identical in composition, recruitment and structure as the preceding â€˜bushmenâ€™ units, except that they had been funded by the Imperial government in London as opposed to local subscription and donation.
