25|$|The War whoop of anarchy, the Marseillais Hymn, is <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear,</b> I must confess, {{independently}} of all moral association, a most dismal, flat, and unpleasing ditty: and to any ear {{it is at}} any rate a long winded and complicated one. In the instance of a melody so mischievous in its application, it is a fortunate incident, if, in itself, it should be doomed neither in point of universality, nor permanence, to gain equal hold on the affections of the people.|$|E
25|$|However, Charlotte did {{not allow}} herself to be discouraged. Furthermore, {{coincidence}} came to her aid. One day in autumn 1845 while alone {{in the dining room}} she noticed a small notebook lying open on in the drawer of Emily's portable writing desk and of my sister Emily's handwriting. She read it and was dazzled by the beauty of the poems that she did not know. The discovery of this treasure was what she recalled five years later, and according to Juliet Barker, she erased the excitement that she had felt, more than surprise , a deep conviction that these were not common effusions, nor at all like the poetry women generally write. I thought them condensed and terse, vigorous and genuine. <b>To</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear,</b> they had a peculiar music â€“ wild, melancholy, and elevating. In the following paragraph Charlotte describes her sister's indignant reaction at her having ventured into such an intimate realm with impunity. It took Emily hours to calm down and days to be convinced to publish the poems.|$|E

60|$|There was one dreadful {{moment of}} silence. He still held his arms round my neck, {{and on a}} sudden he put his lips close <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|E

60|$|It was {{the sound}} of a whisper on my pillow, close <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear.</b> My strange {{insensibility}} to fear remained undisturbed. The whisper was welcome, it kept me company in the dark room.|$|E
60|$|Holmes was for {{the moment}} as startled as I. His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation. Then he broke into a low laugh and put his lips <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|E

6000|$|It seems, <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear,</b> {{that there}} is a sad want of harmony in Lord Byron's verses. Is it not unnatural to be always {{connecting}} very great intellectual power with utter depravity? Does such a combination often really exist in rerum naturae? ...|$|E

60|$|Presently, however, {{there came}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ears</b> the {{whirring}} of the propellers of a flier, and as each moment the sound grew fainter I {{realized that the}} party had proceeded toward the south without assuring themselves as <b>to</b> <b>my</b> fate.|$|R
60|$|Farnese {{dismissed}} {{the matter with}} a casual laugh. And then a lazy, drawling voice--a voice that once had been sweetest music <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ears,</b> but now was loathsome as the croaking of Stygian frogs--addressed me.|$|R
60|$|Spenser's Epithalamion {{is truly}} sublime; and pray mark the swan-like {{movement}} of his exquisite Prothalamion.

6000|$|... "Persuade {{the little}} ones not to be afraid, not to cry, to be as still and silent as may be," [...] {{continued}} the voice, which I felt must be that of one of God's own angels, so exquisitely kind did it sound <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{moved to}} {{a corner of the}} room behind him, and touched a knob in the wall which I had never before observed. A bell rang directly, which had a new tone in it <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ears.</b>|$|R
60|$|A time {{of silence}} followed, though {{how long it}} might be I could not exactly tell. Then I heard Captain England speak, the words coming <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>ears</b> as though from a great distance, because of my condition.|$|R
