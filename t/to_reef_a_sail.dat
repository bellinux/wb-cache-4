6000|$|... "Your {{brother is}} a smart young chap, Mr. Prendergast. I was {{watching}} him yesterday, and he is working away now as if he liked work. He has {{the makings of a}} first-rate sailor. I hold that a man will never become a first-class seaman unless he likes work for its own sake. There are three sorts of hands. There is the fellow who shirks his work whenever he has a chance; there is the man who does his work, but who does it because he has to do it, and always looks glad when a job is over; and there is the lad who jumps to his work, chucks himself right into it, and puts his last ounce of strength on a rope. That is the fellow who will make a good officer, and who, if needs be, can set an example to the men when they have to go aloft <b>to</b> <b>reef</b> <b>a</b> <b>sail</b> in a stiff gale. So, as I understand, Mr. Prendergast, he is going to leave the sea for a bit. It seems a pity too." ...|$|E
5|$|Like the board, {{which might}} be an ad hoc affair, the actual exam {{questions}} were not standardized and their content depended mostly on individual captains. In seamanship, the candidate {{was expected to be}} able <b>to</b> splice ropes, <b>reef</b> <b>a</b> <b>sail,</b> work <b>a</b> ship in <b>sailing</b> and shift his tides. In navigation, he was expected {{to be able to keep}} a reckoning of the ship's way by plane sailing, to use Mercator projection maps and observation of the sun and stars to determine the course and position of the ship, and to understand the variation of the compass. He was also expected to be qualified to do the duty of an able seaman and midshipman.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That doesn't follow at all,' said Captain Cuttwater, 'What sort of {{a figure}} would you make on <b>a</b> yard-arm, <b>reefing</b> <b>a</b> <b>sail</b> in <b>a</b> gale of wind?' ...|$|R
50|$|Roller furling is {{a method}} of furling or <b>reefing</b> <b>a</b> <b>sail</b> by rolling it around a stay or {{rotating}} spar. Roller furling is most prominent on foresails such as jibs, followed by mainsails.|$|R

5000|$|Coral <b>Reef</b> <b>Sailing</b> is <b>a</b> <b>sailing</b> trip aboard <b>a</b> 40-50 ft. <b>sailing</b> {{boat with}} <b>a</b> minimum of 5 {{snorkeling}} dives.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's so. It ain't {{enough to}} know how <b>to</b> <b>reef</b> <b>a</b> gasket, you got to make the mate know you know it. That's reputation. The good word, said at the right time, that's the word that makes us; and evil be to him that evil thinks, as Isaiah says." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You jes' wait," [...] he muttered, seating {{himself on}} an empty mess-kid where he could nurse his sore face. [...] "You jes' wait an' see if I don't fix the whole crowd! Talk about bein' sailors an' then cuffin' the cook when you're goin' to eat aft! I'll bet {{not one of them}} villains knows how <b>to</b> <b>reef</b> <b>a</b> jib, an' before they leave this vessel I'll show what I can do." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{estimation}} {{in which}} a ship's crew hold the knowledge of such accomplishments as these, is expressed in the phrase they apply to one who is a clever practitioner. To distinguish such a mariner from those who merely [...] "hand, reef, and steer," [...] that is, run aloft, furl sails, haul ropes, and stand at the wheel, they say he is [...] "a sailor-man" [...] which means that he not only knows how <b>to</b> <b>reef</b> <b>a</b> topsail, but is an artist in the rigging.|$|R
50|$|Equally {{bright as}} their {{coloration}} is their personality; they are valued additions <b>to</b> <b>reef</b> aquaria, with <b>a</b> {{reputation for being}} friendly and entertaining.|$|R
50|$|Both {{personal}} {{water craft}} and flyboard activities are one mile north of Frederiksted town (about 15-20 minute walk) at Rainbow Beach. A local bar (Rhythms at Rainbow Beach) is host <b>to</b> <b>Reef</b> Jam, <b>an</b> event encouraging marine conservation and stewardship through community education and outreach.|$|R
6000|$|... "Put {{all over}} the place!" [...] he cried, and found Mr. Rusper {{emerging}} from his shop with the large tranquillities of his countenance puckered to anger, like the frowns in the brow of <b>a</b> <b>reefing</b> <b>sail.</b> He gesticulated speechlessly for a moment.|$|R
50|$|<b>Reefing</b> <b>a</b> junk rigged <b>sail</b> is very easy. When sailing {{close to}} the wind, {{all that is needed}} is to ease the halyard. <b>As</b> the <b>sail</b> lowers by its own weight, the other running lines will also relax. The sail is lowered until the desired batten is along the boom. Then the gaff hauling parrel and luff hauling parrel are trimmed, and the sheet is hauled to reset the sail to the wind. When reefing on other points of sail, it is helpful to ease the sheet first to take the {{pressure}} off the sail, and then ease the halyard and trim the other running lines. When sailing dead down wind, it may be helpful to use <b>a</b> downhaul <b>to</b> <b>reef</b> larger <b>sails.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Trips to snorkel or scuba dive {{the reefs}} can be {{interspersed}} by excursions on the <b>reefs</b> themselves or <b>a</b> <b>sail</b> (or even fish) {{on the local}} [...] "jangada" [...] sailing rafts. The deserted beaches of Maragogi and other rural attractions can be accessed by renting beach buggies readily available at the hotels and pousadas.|$|R

5000|$|... "Refsnes" [...] {{stems from}} the Norwegian word [...] "rif" [...] (English: <b>reef)</b> due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>reef</b> in the Oslofjord just outside the mansion. [...] "Gods" [...] means mansion in Norwegian.|$|R
6000|$|... "Two watches on {{a single}} yardarm and unable <b>to</b> put <b>a</b> <b>reef</b> in <b>a</b> {{handkerchief}} like that!" [...] he snorted. [...] "What'll it be if we're off here a month?" ...|$|R
50|$|It takes {{approximately}} 10 {{thousand years}} for coral polyps <b>to</b> form <b>a</b> <b>reef,</b> and between 100,000 and 30 million years for <b>a</b> fully mature <b>reef</b> <b>to</b> form.|$|R

60|$|Meantime Captain Delano had again {{repaired}} to the deck, remaining {{there some}} time. Having at last altered the ship's course, so as <b>to</b> give the <b>reef</b> <b>a</b> wide berth, he {{returned for a}} few moments below.|$|R
60|$|At {{this stage}} an {{incident}} happened. It having become necessary for him <b>to</b> unfurl <b>a</b> <b>reef</b> the sailor vacated his seat.|$|R
50|$|In 1965 {{she took}} charge of rescuing the {{destroyer}} USS Frank Knox. The destroyer had run aground on <b>to</b> Pratus <b>Reef.</b> <b>A</b> severe storm followed that further anchored the ship <b>to</b> the <b>reef.</b> It took the USS Greenlet, with her divers, and Fleet tugs about 40 days to finally pull the destroyer off the reef. The USS Frank Knox was then towed to a dry dock in Yokosuka Japan for repairs. USS Greenlet crew members, ENFN Fred Elliott, were assigned to assist on repairs.|$|R
50|$|The great {{barracuda}} {{is present in}} tropical to warm temperate waters, in subtropical parts of the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic oceans, from mangrove areas <b>to</b> deep <b>reef,</b> with <b>a</b> lower depth limit of 110 metres.|$|R
50|$|The Black Middens is {{the name}} given <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>reef</b> {{at the mouth of}} the River Tyne in North East England, noted for the danger it poses to shipping.|$|R

5000|$|The Guardian found Off Armageddon <b>Reef</b> <b>to</b> have <b>a</b> {{predictable}} ending {{and called}} the character development [...] "perfunctory", but applauded Weber's pacing and vision.|$|R
5000|$|Seatoun, {{an eastern}} suburb of Wellington, {{the capital city}} of New Zealand, lies on the east coast of the Miramar Peninsula, close to the {{entrance}} to Wellington Harbour (Port Nicholson), some seven kilometres southeast of the CBD. The suburb sits on an exposed promontory close <b>to</b> Barrett <b>Reef,</b> <b>a</b> dangerous area of rocky shallows upon which many ships have foundered, most notably the inter-island ferry [...] in 1968.|$|R

50|$|The rest of {{the island}} is a large raised {{limestone}} formation. It rises 10 m inland, and 70 - 100 m along the cliffs at the eastern coast. The cliffs correspond <b>to</b> the <b>reef</b> of <b>an</b> ancient lagoon.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll get {{it worse}} when we {{open up the}} Arenas bight," [...] said Jake as {{he glanced at the}} lurching tug. [...] "It looks as if the skipper meant <b>to</b> give the <b>reef</b> <b>a</b> wide berth. He's {{swinging}} off to starboard. Watch his smoke." ...|$|R
50|$|The yellow clown goby {{is popular}} with aquarists and is {{generally}} considered <b>to</b> be <b>reef</b> safe. It is especially suited <b>to</b> nano <b>reef</b> tanks because of its small size, {{and the ability of}} the aquarist to closely monitor its health. Equally bright as their coloration is their personality; they are valued additions <b>to</b> <b>reef</b> aquaria, with <b>a</b> reputation for being friendly and entertaining.|$|R
50|$|When {{attempting}} <b>to</b> tie <b>a</b> <b>reef</b> knot (square knot), {{it is easy}} {{to produce}} a granny knot accidentally. This is dangerous because the granny knot can slip when heavily loaded. A tightened granny knot can also jam and is often more difficult to untie than the reef knot. It is better <b>to</b> tie <b>a</b> <b>reef</b> knot in nearly all circumstances. One way to distinguish them is that in the reef knot each loop passes completely over, or completely under (not through) the neck of the other.|$|R
5000|$|Pugwash {{takes its}} name from the native Mi'kmaq word, [...] "Pagweak," [...] meaning [...] "Shallow Water", in {{reference}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>reef</b> near the mouth of the harbour, making navigation through the shallow waters difficult.|$|R
60|$|Passing the <b>reef,</b> and <b>sailing</b> <b>a</b> little {{distance}} therefrom, the canoes were disposed in a circle; the one {{bearing the}} corpse in the center.
