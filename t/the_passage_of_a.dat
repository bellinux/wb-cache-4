5|$|A major {{accomplishment}} of the Johnson administration was <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> legislative redistricting bill. Despite {{the fact that}} the U.S. Constitution requires redistricting after every decennial census, Kentucky's legislative districts had remained virtually unchanged between 1893 and 1941. He asked the 1942 legislative session to adjourn early so he could call a special session {{for the sole purpose of}} considering a redistricting bill. The legislators obliged, and passed a bill by the end of the special session.|$|E

Cold north, northwest, or west winds generally blow across the lake following <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cold front, and the temperature difference between the warm lake and the cool air can form clouds that lead to precipitation downwind of the lake. It is typically heaviest from eastern Tooele County east and north into central Davis County. It can deposit excessive snowfall amounts, generally with a narrow band of snow highly dependent on the direction the wind is blowing.|$|E

He also overhauled the state auditing agencies and claimed to have saved the government millions of dollars. He was unsuccessful in passing {{the rest of the}} progressive platform agenda items or persuading the legislature to call a convention to rewrite the state constitution to expand the government's regulatory powers.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantic {{campaign}} of May 1794 {{was a series}} of operations conducted by the British Royal Navy's Channel Fleet against the French Navy's Atlantic Fleet, with the aim of preventing <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> strategically important French grain convoy travelling from the United States to France. The campaign involved commerce raiding by detached forces and two minor engagements, eventually culminating in the full fleet action of the Glorious First of June 1794, at which both fleets were badly mauled and both Britain and France claimed victory. The French lost seven battleships; the British none, but the battle distracted the British fleet long enough for the French convoy to safely reach port.|$|E

The law's creation and passage were spurred in part by testimony from Logan's parents, James Logan, Sr. and Karen Logan. The law allows a judge to order a mandatory psychiatric evaluation of a person, if the person presented a threat to themselves or to others.|$|E
5|$|When the Curule Aedileship {{had been}} created, {{it had only}} been opened to Patricians. Eventually, however, Plebeians won full {{admission}} to the Curule Aedileship. In addition, after the Consulship had been opened to the Plebeians, the Plebeians acquired a de facto right to hold both the Roman Dictatorship and the Roman Censorship (which had been created in 443 BC) since only former Consuls could hold either office. 356 BC saw the appointment of the first Plebeian Dictator, and in 339 BC the Plebeians facilitated <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> law (the lex Publilia), which required the election {{of at least one}} Plebeian Censor for each five-year term. In 337 BC, the first Plebeian Praetor was elected.|$|E

5|$|When the Second World War began, Bethe {{wanted to}} {{contribute}} to the war effort, but was unable to work on classified projects until he became a citizen. Following the advice of the Caltech aerodynamicist Theodore von Kármán, Bethe collaborated with his friend Teller on a theory of shock waves which are generated by <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> projectile through a gas. Bethe considered it one of their most influential papers. He also worked on a theory of armor penetration, which was immediately classified by the Army, making it inaccessible to Bethe, who was not an American citizen at the time.|$|E
5|$|Widespread {{rainfall}} occurred throughout Central America {{in early}} October 2008 due to <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tropical wave through the region. Later, another tropical wave approached the region, which {{was believed to}} have left {{the west coast of}} Africa on September17. The wave developed a low pressure area on October10 in the southwestern Caribbean, with sporadic convection. On October13, the system consisted of a large area of convection drifting northward offshore eastern Central America, and Dvorak classifications began, indicating gradual organization. At that time, there was another low pressure area on the Pacific coast, and both systems were producing rainfall across Central America.|$|E
5|$|After {{affecting}} the Philippines, Soudelor moved {{into an area}} of low wind shear and with favorable outflow. It became a typhoon on June17, and quickly developed an eye while rapidly intensifying. The storm struck the Japanese island of Iriomote-jima, where wind gusts reached 204km/h (127mph). It also affected Taiwan, where floods covered highways and caused mudslides. Early on June18, Soudelor reached peak 10‑minute sustained winds of 150km/h (90mph). Subsequently, an increase in shear and <b>the</b> <b>passage</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> trough weakened the typhoon and caused it {{to turn to the}} northeast. Soudelor weakened to a tropical storm on June19, and subsequently it passed between Japan and South Korea. It became an extratropical cyclone that day, dissipating on June24. In Japan, the storm caused widespread power outages, although damage was minimal, and there were 21injuries. In South Korea, there was $12.1million in damage and two deaths.|$|E
