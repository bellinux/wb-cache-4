40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} a supplier’s new service development capabilities and detail the means of capability development. Currently, most research stresses the active role of a customer in new service development. However, a service supplier needs to develop new service development capabilities to enable and enhance that active role. We use a multiple case study to detect such capabilities in a <b>technological</b> <b>service</b> setting. As a result, the study categorizes the capabilities into service-, structure- and interaction-based new service co-creation capabilities and finds interaction to be an important contributor to their development. The study provides tentative tools for managers that seek to involve their customers in the new service development process...|$|E

40|$|In this study, I {{analyze the}} various means of source {{taxation}} of <b>technological</b> and other <b>services</b> permitted by Finnish double taxation conventions {{and the future}} of source taxation of <b>technological</b> and other <b>services.</b> I attempt to shed light on the various means of source taxation of <b>technological</b> <b>services</b> permitted by Finnish tax treaties and by tax treaties also more generally. I analyze 1) the taxation of <b>technological</b> <b>services</b> in the source country as the profits of a permanent establishment constituted based on provision of services (the so called “service PE” provision of the United Nations Model Double Taxation Convention), 2) source taxation of independent personal services, 3) taxation of <b>technological</b> <b>services</b> as royalties, and 4) taxation of <b>technological</b> <b>services</b> under autonomous treaty provisions. Further, I analyze the interpretation of the concept of “fees for technical services” as understood in Indian case law, taking into account the specific formulation of the Finland-India double tax treaty and Indian domestic tax legislation. In Indian tax treaties and domestic tax legislation, technical services are understood as services of managerial, technical or consultancy nature. Finally, I analyze the autonomous technical service draft article which may be incorporated into the United Nations Model Double Taxation Convention in the near future. The definition of technical services in the proposed article corresponds largely to the definition used by India in its domestic tax legislation and its double tax treaties. Several challenges remain, such as the issue of high effective tax rates due to gross taxation of service income and the treatment of business to consumer transactions. It would be {{in the best interest of}} all countries to resolve these issues collectively before source taxation of services becomes more common and heterogeneous practices are established...|$|R
40|$|During {{the past}} few yers, {{remarkable}} affords have been made for the realization of microscale systems and devices. Whereas, due to advances in solid state and microsystem technologies, significant advances in designing, fabricating and testing of sensors, actuators and microsystems have been achieved at laboratory level, the technical and economical realization of microsystems production is considerably impeded ba the lack of satisfying device technology for the industrial production. A production concept for the industrial production of hybrid microelectromechanical systems, the MicroFab concept, was developed. The concept separates the microsystems fabrication into four different tasks: design and production planning by the microsystems manufacturer, fabrication of the signal processing part by and IC-manufacturer, execution of the know-how-bearing microstructuring process steps by the microsystem manufacturer, and execution of less efficient microstructuring process steps by externa l <b>technological</b> <b>service</b> centers.

40|$|Abstract This study explores {{customer}} perceived {{value in}} the context of emerging technology-intensive business service, in particular a mobile advertising service that is at the application phase of development. The purpose of the study is to conceptualise customer perceived value as a multidimensional concept by exploring 1) the complex interaction between benefits and sacrifices 2) temporality and 3) learning. This way the study contributes to the existing research within services marketing and business relationships. The empirical part of the study is conducted {{in the form of a}} qualitative single-case study. The empirical setting organised to acquire data is qualitative real-life experiment. It consists of three field experiments that were organised by the research project to simulate real-life situations and to gain understanding of developing technological services that are not yet in commercial use. Interviews, observations and personal experiences form the main sources of information and are complemented by secondary documental data. In this study the sources of value are first identified, which enhances understanding of what kind of value customers perceive from emerging <b>technological</b> <b>service.</b> In addition, value sub-elements have a complex interaction in service value co-creation, since certain sacrifices made by users may increase the benefits they perceive, whereas some benefits can increase the sacrifices and thus reduce the customer perceived net value. Second, the concepts of expected value, realised value and potential value are identified which enables deeper understanding of the temporality of customer perceived value. Third, learning has an important role in customer perceived value. When looking at learning at the process level, it is a sacrifice, but at the outcome level it turns into a benefit and thus also amplifies the customer perceived net value. Learning is needed from the customer to be able to use the new <b>technological</b> <b>service</b> and utilise it effectively, which in turn leads the customer to perceive higher value from the service. Moreover, the temporal dimensions of value are connected to each other through the customer’s learning that varies according to its type and object at different points of time. For the service providers of new technological services understanding value related to the service and its production is essential. The future success and viability of these kinds of services requires that service providers know what kind of value their customers perceive from the service and especially what kind of future expectations they have for it. This study provides implications for the service providers on how to co-create value with their business customers and thus make technology-intensive business service a profitable business in the future...|$|E
