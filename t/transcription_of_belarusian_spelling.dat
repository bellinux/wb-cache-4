As {{a result of these}} new rules, the existing 50- and 50,000-ruble notes dated 2000 now technically contain errors where the denominations are spelled out on the notes. On 29 December 2010, the National Bank of Belarus introduced new 50- and 50,000-ruble banknotes to bring the inscriptions on the notes into compliance with the new rules <b>of</b> <b>Belarusian</b> <b>spelling</b> and punctuation. The images, colors, and sizes of the notes remain consistent with the preceding issues of the same denominations dated 2000.
