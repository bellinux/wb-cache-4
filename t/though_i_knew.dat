5|$|Ian Chappell … always sweated on my blunders and {{reported}} {{them with an}} 'I told you so' mentality... To say Chappell's criticism irked me would be an understatement, <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> that, like anyone, he was entitled to an opinion. I don't mind the fact he criticised me — in fact, I would much rather someone make a judgement than not, but I have always felt that a critic must be either constructive or base his comments on fact... It was something I had to live with, and when I realised he {{was never going to}} cut me much slack, I decided anything he said that was positive would be a bonus and the rest just cast aside.|$|E
25|$|My {{mother always}} told me {{that no matter how}} much you dislike a person, when you meet them face to face you will find {{characteristics}} about them that you like. Jerry Falwell was a perfect example of that. I hated everything he stood for, but after meeting him in person, years after the trial, Jerry Falwell and I became good friends. He would visit me in California and we would debate together on college campuses. I always appreciated his sincerity even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> what he was selling and he knew what I was selling.|$|E
25|$|Madhubala {{was quite}} another matter. I {{knew she was}} very sick even before I married her. But a promise is a promise. So I kept my word and brought her home as my wife, even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> she was dying from a {{congenital}} heart problem. For 9 long years I nursed her. I watched her die before my own eyes. You can never understand what this means until you live through this yourself. She was such a beautiful woman and she died so painfully. She would rave and rant and scream in frustration. How can such an active person spend 9 long years bed-ridden? And I had to humour her all the time. That's what the doctor asked me to. That's what I did till her very last breath. I would laugh with her. I would cry with her.|$|E

500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of the Los Angeles Times {{rated the}} episode the 79th of all Lost episodes (apart from the series finale), {{described}} the episode as [...] "thrilling," [...] but opined {{that the show}} since [...] "has done similar things much better." [...] Whitney Pastorek of Entertainment Weekly did not care for Jack's flashbacks, but commended the scene in which Jack saved Charlie, stating [...] "even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> {{he was going to}} go back to the CPR and save Charlie's life, I started crying. This is how you identify good TV: When you know what's going to happen and you still get swept up in it all." ...|$|E
500|$|Price Peterson, {{writing for}} TV.com, gave a glowing review, calling it [...] "the best-yet episode of Veronica Mars". He {{elaborated}} by stating, This episode {{was just a}} total triumph for how it brought together SO MUCH from the past 22 episodes and beyond. I loved the Aaron Echolls assassination. I loved that last image of Duncan enjoying his victory in a perpetual magic hour on some Australian beach. I especially loved the It's a Wonderful Life-esque dream sequence. This episode was so good that even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> Beaver was the bad guy, I still came away shocked {{by many of the}} reveals. That's just good writing right there. Conversely, Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "B+".|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reactions}} of the episode were positive. Chris Carabott of IGN rated the episode 9 out of 10, calling it [...] "a swift return to form" [...] with [...] "plenty of striking and emotional moments" [...] that made {{it one of the}} better episodes of the first season. Carabott commented on the flashbacks; [...] "We don't necessarily learn anything new about Jack from a personality standpoint," [...] but Fox did [...] "an exceptional job of conveying Jack's heartbreak as he reveals that his father operated on a woman while under the influence of alcohol." [...] He enjoyed Jack and Ethan's encounter, calling it [...] "chilling." [...] Carabott also praised the scene where Jack tries to save Charlie; [...] "I remember believing that they had killed off Charlie on my initial viewing and even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> the outcome this time, it was still a hard scene to watch," [...] adding [...] "after Jack finally manages to resuscitate him, you have to feel for Charlie because you know that he's disappointed in himself for letting Claire down." [...] Another IGN article ranked [...] "All the Best Cowboys Have Daddy Issues" [...] the 33rd best Lost episode.|$|E

2500|$|In 1988, Flynt won a Supreme Court decision, Hustler Magazine v. Falwell, {{after being}} sued by Reverend Jerry Falwell in 1983, over an {{offensive}} ad parody in Hustler {{that suggested that}} Falwell's first sexual encounter was with his mother in an out-house. Falwell sued Flynt, citing emotional distress caused by the ad. The decision clarified that public figures cannot recover damages for [...] "intentional infliction of emotional distress" [...] based on parodies. After Falwell's death, Flynt said despite their differences, he and Falwell had become friends over the years, adding, [...] "I always appreciated his sincerity even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> what he was selling and he knew what I was selling." ...|$|E
2500|$|Knightley {{grew up in}} {{a modest}} {{household}} in Richmond, London, where she attended Stanley Junior School and Teddington School. At the age of six, she was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia but {{by the time she was}} eleven, with her parents' support and much tuition, Knightley said: [...] "they deemed me to have got over dyslexia sufficiently". She is still a slow reader and cannot sight-read. Knightley has noted that she was [...] "single-minded about acting" [...] during her childhood. Speaking of her fascination with acting, she has said: [...] "There was never anything else, I wanted to be a part of my parents' world, even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> there are times when you're unemployed". Knightley performed in a number of local amateur productions, which included After Juliet, written by her mother, and United States, written by her drama teacher, Ian McShane. She focused on art, history, and English literature while studying at the Esher College, but left after a year to pursue a full-time acting career.|$|E
2500|$|Shane Warne {{also thought}} very highly of Hooper's {{footwork}} and, in 2008, named him {{among the top}} 100 cricketers of his time, citing in particular his ability to disguise his dances down the track. [...] Warne felt that determining when a batsman {{was going to give}} the charge {{was one of the most}} important things for a spinner, and that Hooper was the best at making it indeterminable. [...] "During the 1995 series," [...] he wrote, [...] "this really nagged away at me, because I couldn't spot any of the usual clues even <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> there had to be a sign that would give him away. [...] On a number of occasions, I stopped at the point of delivery to see if he was giving anything away with his footwork. [...] Most batsmen would be looking to get out of their ground at that point, whereas Hooper just stayed set. [...] In the end, after watching him closely time after time, I managed to crack it. [...] When he wanted to hit over the top, he just looked at me instead of tapping his crease as usual and looking down. Of course, my knowing what he was going to do did not always stop him from doing it." ...|$|E
