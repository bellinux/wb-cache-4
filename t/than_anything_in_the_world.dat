500|$|Following their {{successful}} partnership on All Things Must Pass in 1970, Harrison and co-producer Phil Spector {{turned their}} attention to resurrecting the career of Spector's wife Ronnie, formerly lead singer of the Ronettes. Since the break-up of the Ronettes in 1967, Ronnie Spector's only musical release had been [...] "You Came, You Saw, You Conquered", a 1969 single on A Records. Her signing to the Beatles' Apple record label was a condition of Phil Spector's deal with the company, one that Harrison and Lennon, as avowed fans of the Ronettes, were happy to honour. The plan was to produce a comeback album, with Harrison providing many of the songs, and issue it on Apple Records. In his book Phil Spector: Out of His Head, Williams quotes music publisher Paul Case as having said during this period: [...] "Phil wants a hit record with Ronnie again more <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> I think he'd give up all his worldly possessions for that." ...|$|E

2500|$|As a German Romantic opera, Die Feen imitated {{the musical}} style of Carl Maria von Weber. According to Danilo Prefumo's notes {{to one of}} the {{recordings}} available, it also showed the influence of Italian opera, grand opera and opéra comique. On the other hand, Alan Blyth, Gramophone's regular Wagner reviewer, sees both Weber and Marschner as influences but says that, by avoiding the aping of Italian opera in Das Liebesverbot and of grand opera <b>in</b> Rienzi, <b>the</b> result was an opera more stylistically unified than its successors. [...] "The later works may contain individual passages that are more 'advanced' <b>than</b> <b>anything</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> youthfully imitative ways of Die Feen, but as entities they are less satisfying." ...|$|R

This choice procedure provides a simple explanation of the attraction/decoy effect. It reduces to rational choice when preferences are complete in two ways that are made precise.
