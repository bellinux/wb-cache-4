In their Redmond headquarters, a skeleton crew composed of Arakawa, his wife Yoko, James, Judy, Phillips and Stone set about gutting 2,000 surplus Radar Scope machines and converting them with Donkey Kong motherboards and power supplies from Japan. The game officially went on sale in July 1981. Actor Harris Shore created the first live-action Mario in the television commercials for Colecovision's hand-held Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong, Junior video games.|$|E
5|$|The Actor Rebellion of 1733 was {{an event}} that {{took place at the}} Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London, England when the actors who worked there, disapproving of the changes in the management, {{attempted}} to seize control.

40|$|Summary: Empirical {{evidence}} suggests that <b>managers</b> privately alter <b>the</b> risk in their compensation by trading in the financial markets. This paper analyzes the implications of <b>the</b> <b>manager’s</b> hedging ability on her op-timal compensation scheme, incentives and firm value. I allow <b>the</b> <b>manager</b> to reduce her systematic risk exposure by trading the market portfolio. I find that <b>the</b> <b>manager’s</b> optimal hedge depends on the liquidity of the market. Due to imperfect liquidity, <b>the</b> <b>manager’s</b> optimal hedge is not complete. The equilibrium pay-performance sensitivity and hence <b>the</b> <b>manager’s</b> equi-librium incentives and the firm value increases in the liquidity of the market...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{present a}} simple model of {{managerial}} reporting bias for a {{setting in which}} the capital market is uncertain about <b>the</b> <b>manager’s</b> reporting objective. In this setting, <b>the</b> <b>manager’s</b> reporting bias reduces the value rel-evance of <b>the</b> <b>manager’s</b> report; that is, it adds noise to the report. Through comparative static results, our model yields insights into factors that affect the slope and intercept terms in a regression of price on earnings. Specifically, {{we find that the}} information content of <b>the</b> <b>manager’s</b> report, as captured by the earnings slope coefficient, falls as the private cost to <b>the</b> <b>manager</b> of bi-asing reports falls, and as the uncertainty about <b>the</b> <b>manager’s</b> objective in-creases. We also find that the magnitude of the adjustment for the expected amount of bias, as captured by the absolute value of the intercept, falls as the uncertainty about <b>the</b> <b>manager’s</b> objective increases. Finally, to highlight conditions under which managers would lobby to retain an option to bias reports (i. e., retain reporting flexibility), we analyze the effect of the option to bias on <b>the</b> <b>manager’s</b> welfare. For example, we show that the ex ante benefit from biasing the report is positive if there is sufficient uncertainty about <b>the</b> <b>manager’s</b> reporting objective.

Myers used as an example, to win the $20,000 prize of the Aero Club the French balloonist Alberto Santos-Dumont spent more than that amount in six airships he entered into the tournament to win. Myers himself had an over abundance of ideas for balloons, but was short on cash to make many of them a reality even though he had the necessary balloon knowledge. The newspapers printed that Myers was making a balloon capable of holding 75,000 to 100,000 cubic feet of hydrogen.|$|E
