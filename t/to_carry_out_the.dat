5|$|In February 1919, {{with the}} war over, the C {{submitted}} a new bill that included provisions for an extension of time for the tunnel enlargement works approved {{in the act of}} 1913.

In 1920, under special wartime provisions, the LER was granted an extension of time <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> works for its own 1913 act. Although the permissions <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> works had been renewed, the Underground companies were {{not in a position to}} raise the funds needed to pay for the works.

His superior, Balamb Garden's master NORG, orders him to use SeeD members <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> {{assassination}} plot against Sorceress Edea. When Squall and his team travel to Galbadia Garden after fleeing Timber, Martine orders them <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> mission. He hopes that using Balamb Garden's SeeDs would deflect responsibility for the plot onto NORG. His actions trigger the conflict within Balamb Garden when Garden Master NORG tries to kill Headmaster Cid to appease Sorceress Edea after the mission fails. Afterward, the Galbadian military seizes Galbadia Garden and Martine flees to the pacifist city of Fishermans Horizon.|$|E

5|$|Theodore himself {{remained}} in captivity at Tarnovo for seven years. Initially {{he was treated}} with honour, {{but at some point}} during his captivity he was accused of plotting against John Asen and blinded as a result. This was the customary Byzantine punishment for treason and means of sidelining potential political rivals. According to a contemporary letter written in Hebrew, Asen initially ordered two Jews <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> deed, for Theodore had been persecuting the Jews in his territory and confiscating their wealth to fund his campaigns. Theodore begged to be spared, and they refused <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> blinding, whereupon the enraged Tsar had them thrown from a cliff. Finally, in 1237 Theodore was released when Asen, recently widowed, fell in love with Theodore's sole unmarried daughter, Irene. Immediately after the marriage, Theodore was released and allowed to depart Tarnovo to wherever he wished.|$|E
