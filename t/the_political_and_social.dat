5|$|On March 11, 1985, {{power in}} the Soviet Union was assumed by Mikhail Gorbachev.

5|$|The {{historian}} Jens Wehner {{notes that}} the German-language version of the book was immensely popular in Germany, but contained serious flaws in terms of presentation of historical realities.

5|$|After {{finishing}} his schooling Kagame made two visits to Rwanda, in 1977 and 1978. He was initially hosted {{by family members}} of his former classmates, but upon arrival in Kigali he made contact with {{members of his own}} family. He kept a low profile on these visits, believing that his status as a well-connected Tutsi exile could lead to arrest; on his second visit he entered the country through Zaire rather than Uganda to avoid suspicion. Kagame used his time in Rwanda to explore the country, familiarise himself with <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> situation, and make connections that would prove useful to him in his later activities.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 12th century, a range of new keep designs began to appear across France and England, {{breaking}} the previous unity of the regional designs. The use of keeps in castles spread through Iberia, but some new castles never incorporated keeps in their designs. One traditional explanation for these developments emphasises the military utility of the new approaches, arguing, for example, that the curved surfaces of the new keeps helped to deflect attacks, or that they drew on lessons learnt during the Crusades from Islamic practices in the Levant. More recent historical analysis, however, has emphasised <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> drivers that underlay these mid-medieval changes in keep design.|$|E

Each year during the Miller era, several thousand people traveled {{from across the country}} to wager on and watch the horses. In 1953, Rosecroft's attendance of 192,585 was the highest among all harness tracks in Maryland. Owners, trainers, and drivers from across the United States moved their farms to Maryland in the 1950s following the opening of Rosecroft, hoping to compete with the best horses.|$|E

5|$|The Icelandic sagas, in {{particular}} Snorri Sturluson in Heimskringla, claim that Sigurd, like Olaf's father, was a great-grandson of King Harald Fairhair {{in the male}} line. Most modern scholars believe that the ancestors attributed to Harald Hardrada's father, along with {{other parts of the}} Fairhair genealogy, are inventions reflecting <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> expectations of the time of the authors (around two centuries after Harald Hardrada's lifetime) rather than historical reality. Harald Hardrada's alleged descent from Harald Fairhair is not mentioned and played no part during Harald Hardrada's own time, which seems odd considering that it would have provided significant legitimacy in connection with his claim to the Norwegian throne.|$|E
5|$|According to {{historian}} Philippe Leymarie, the French crushing of the Uprising {{resulted in}} the near annihilation of the managerial class in Madagascar, with consequences that continued to reverberate for decades after the country's independence. Many of the leading figures in the Uprising went on to dramatically shape <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> landscape of Madagascar after independence. Monja Jaona, who was jailed by the French for nine years, founded the Madagascar for the Malagasy Party (MONIMA) in 1958 shortly after his release. His party was key in leading the rotaka peasant uprising against President Philibert Tsiranana which brought down his neo-colonial administration the following year. After initially supporting Admiral Didier Ratsiraka, Tsiranana's successor, in 1992 Jaona led demonstrations against it and in favor of federalism, being severely wounded in the process. His son, Monja Roindefo, is also {{an active member of}} MONIMA and served as Prime Minister under Andry Rajoelina.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving his}} former label Flying Dutchman Records, Gil Scott-Heron {{signed with the}} New York City jazz-based Strata-East label in early 1973, {{accompanied}} by jazz keyboardist and songwriter Brian Jackson, {{with whom he had}} worked with on his previous studio albums, Pieces of a Man (1971) and Free Will (1972). While some sources allege this may have been over financial or creative differences, Scott-Heron maintained the switch was due to producer Bob Thiele's unwillingness to give Jackson co-billing. By the time of their move to Strata-East, Scott-Heron and Jackson had achieved underground notice among R and soul music listeners, particularly for <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> nature of their music's themes, as well as Scott-Heron's emphasis on African-American culture and social plight in his compositions. Their musical fusion of jazz, blues, soul and spoken word styles helped them earn some notice among less-mainstream black music listeners at the time.|$|E

5|$|As {{his sons}} had desired and planned, Wilberforce {{has long been}} viewed as a Christian hero, a statesman-saint held up {{as a role model}} for putting his faith into action. More broadly, he has also been {{described}} as a humanitarian reformer who contributed significantly to reshaping <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> attitudes of the time by promoting concepts of social responsibility and action. In the 1940s, the role of Wilberforce and the Clapham Sect in abolition was downplayed by historian Eric Williams, who argued that abolition was motivated not by humanitarianism but by economics, as the West Indian sugar industry was in decline. Williams' approach strongly influenced historians for much of {{the latter part of the}} 20th century. However, more recent historians have noted that the sugar industry was still making large profits at the time of abolition, and this has led to a renewed interest in Wilberforce and the Evangelicals, as well as a recognition of the anti-slavery movement as a prototype for subsequent humanitarian campaigns.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of 1973, John Lennon began {{distancing}} himself from <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> issues he had embraced in the previous 18 months. It was also around this time {{that he and his}} wife, Yoko Ono, were going through marital problems. As Ono was completing her fourth album, Feeling the Space, Lennon decided he also wanted to record a new album, and liked the studio musicians that their assistant and production coordinator May Pang had assembled for Ono's album. Shortly thereafter, he asked Pang to book them for his sessions. Wanting to produce an album that would be more accepted than his previous politically charged commercial flop Some Time in New York City, Lennon began writing and demoing a few songs for Mind Games in his Greenwich Village apartment. He began composing after a period of almost a year of not writing any material.|$|E
5|$|The early 20th {{century is}} also {{marked by the}} {{presence}} of a group of composers called the generazione dell'ottanta (generation of 1880), including Franco Alfano, Alfredo Casella, Gian Francesco Malipiero, Ildebrando Pizzetti, and Ottorino Respighi. These composers usually concentrated on writing instrumental works, rather than opera. Members of this generation were the dominant figures in Italian music after Puccini's death in 1924. New organizations arose to promote Italian music, such as the Venice Festival of Contemporary Music and the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino. Guido Gatti's founding of the periodical il Piano and then La rassegna musicale also helped to promote a broader view of music than <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> climate allowed. Most Italians, however, preferred more traditional pieces and established standards, and only a small audience sought new styles of experimental classical music.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the Crusades in general, and {{particularly}} that of the First Crusade, is widely debated among historians. The confusion is partially due to the numerous armies in the first crusade, and their lack of direct unity. The similar ideologies held the armies to similar goals, but the connections were rarely strong, and the unity broke down often. The Crusades are most commonly linked to <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> situation in 11th-century Europe, {{the rise of a}} reform movement within the papacy, and the political and religious confrontation of Christianity and Islam in Europe and the Middle East. Christianity had spread throughout Europe, Africa, and the Middle East in Late Antiquity, but by the early 8th century Christian rule had become limited to Europe and Anatolia after the Muslim conquests.|$|E
5|$|Hellblazer {{was first}} {{published}} during {{the early days of}} the Modern Age of Comics, and so its themes were as dark, edgy, politically and morally complex as its contemporaries. The comic mixed supernatural and real life horror, akin to contemporary gothic, with noire, surrealism and occult detective fiction elements. Unlike other comic books, it is also unique as it follows real time in its span of 20 years, with its protagonist John Constantine aging in every publication. Because of this, writers of the series often places their era's culture and social commentary in their run. When Jamie Delano first wrote the series in the late 1980s and early 1990s, his issues were heavily inspired by the era such as punk rock and the British economy. Delano would be the first to put his political views in the series, an element never before seen in mainstream comics, such as his negative views of Thatcher's regime and by 2005 includes the War on Terror. This made John Constantine different from other comic book characters at that time, in that he fights <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> injustice of Great Britain.|$|E
