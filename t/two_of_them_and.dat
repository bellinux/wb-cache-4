500|$|Joshua Logan, in his memoirs, {{stated that}} {{after months of}} effort {{in the first half}} of 1948, Hammerstein had written only the first scene, an outline, and some lyrics. [...] Hammerstein was having trouble due to lack of {{knowledge}} of the military, a matter with which Logan, a veteran of the armed forces, was able to help. [...] The dialogue was written in consultation between the <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> eventually Logan asked to be credited for his work. [...] Rodgers and Hammerstein decided that while Logan would receive co-writing credit on the book, he would receive no author's royalties. Logan stated that a contract putting these changes into force was sent over to his lawyer with instructions that unless it was signed within two hours, Logan need not show up for rehearsals as director. Logan signed, although his lawyer did not then tell him about the ultimatum. [...] Through the decades that followed, Logan brought the matter up from time to time, demanding compensation, but when he included his version of the events in his 1976 memoirs, it was disputed by Rodgers (Hammerstein had died in 1960). [...] Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest suggests that Logan was compensated when South Pacific was filmed in 1958, as Logan received a substantial share of the profits as director. According to Michener biographer Stephen J. May, [...] "it is difficult to assess just how much of the final book Josh Logan was responsible for. [...] Some estimates say 30 to 40 percent. [...] But that percentage is not as critical perhaps as his knowledge of military lore and directing for the theatre, without which the creation of South Pacific would have collapsed during that summer of 1948." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to his {{resemblance}} with Roxas, {{video game}} publications initially thought that Roxas {{would be one}} of the protagonists from Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep when seeing one of Ventus' images. However, when it was revealed that the two were different, publications continued to discuss how similar they were and if there was a connection between them. GamesRadar particularly thought that there would be an eventual connection between the <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>and</b> Sora. Amanda L. Kondolojy from Cheat Code Central also commented on speculations regarding the similarities between both of them, but mentioned that due to the existence of Nobodies in series, it is hard to find them as coincidences. When Jesse McCartney confirmed he was working on the English localization of Birth by Sleep, sites thought that he would voice Ventus, as he also voiced Roxas in previous titles. The character's story and actions shown in the demonstrations were praised for being the [...] "most original take on Kingdom Hearts" [...] and yet [...] "frustratingly traditional". Upon Ventus' introduction in Birth by Sleep, X-Play found the character to be very similar to Sora's due to his friendly attitude. Kevin VanOrd from the same site gave praise to Ventus' character for his [...] "well-meaning" [...] and yet not [...] "annoying" [...] personality. The site also said that the time players spend playing with Ventus would be [...] "rewarding" [...] and commented on the English voice acting. PlayStation LifeStyle's Thomas Williams found the trio of Ventus, Terra and Aqua as welcome additions to the franchise, finding their stories enjoyable even though the three travel to the same worlds. On the other hand, PALGN found the three characters unappealing, labelling Ventus as [...] "just a Roxas clone, but without his personality." [...] In contrast to 1UP's comments towards Ventus' actions in Cinderella's world, VanOrd commented that such interactions to be [...] "more bothersome than boisterous." [...] Writing for GamesRadar, Chris Antistaer called Ventus a [...] "Roxas-clone", and did not understand why he was briefly featured in Kingdom Hearts II. Bob Muir from Destructoid noted that in Birth by Sleep Ventus was the most important character by fans due to his similarities with Roxas. Additionally, Miur praised Jesse McCartney's work as Ventus' English voice actor that make his story mode more engaging to players.|$|E
