After remotely shutting down the ship's engines, Geiger calls the bridge to tell the first officer, Juliano, that the captain is dead and he is in charge. Juliano is ordered by Geiger to evacuate the ship. Geiger steals jewelry from the ship's vault. As passengers evacuate, Drew, a young deaf girl, becomes trapped in an elevator, {{and a group of}} people become trapped behind locked fire doors in a hallway filling with smoke.

Alex jumps into the boat to rescue the passengers who are falling off, and Annie and Juliano use the ship's gangplank <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> on deck.|$|E

Hampshire also struggled, and scored only 94 for their first 6 wickets. Warne and Sean Ervine survived the last six overs to push the score to 111 for 6 at close.|$|E

His most valuable tool in scaring is his overwhelming armpit stench, as well as using his eyeballs. A running gag in the series is that Krumm sometimes loses his eyeballs and has <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>them</b> <b>back,</b> once {{going so far as to}} make a fake head to keep from losing them.

The Portuguese however were observed constructing a battery to command the entrance of the harbor, and Lancaster, sent a strong party of 275 men to destroy their work. Attacking at night the English surprised the Portuguese [...] who fled and the destruction was achieved, but some order was lost as fifty of the English ran forward, beyond the cover of the ships' broadsides, were met by a large body of Portuguese and their Indian allies and were ambushed.

Buoyed by this success the Portuguese with their Indian allies then launched another attack on the isthmus, only to be repelled again this time with the help of the ships guns.

Three continuing education schools were randomly selected for the study. Three hundred and twenty girls who re-enrolled in these schools were used for the study. Data was analysed using multiple regression analysis method. Results showed that there is a significant relationship between counselling, vocational interest and socio-economic status of parents on re-entry of girls into school. It is recommended that counselling services should be provided for girls who have dropped out of school with a view <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>them</b> <b>back</b> into the school system.
