When singing to entertain guests, courtesans not only composed the lyrics to their own songs, but they popularized {{a new form of}} lyrical verse by singing lines written by various renowned and famous men in Chinese history.|$|E
5|$|High {{levels of}} {{humidity}} {{are essential for}} optimum fruit body development, and growth is inhibited by either <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>or</b> too little light. Fruit bodies change their geotropic response three times during their development, which helps ensure that the teeth ultimately point downward for optimum spore release. The pure culture, cell division and the ultrastructure of A.vulgares hyphae and mycelia have been studied and described in search of potentially useful characters for phylogenetic analysis. When grown in culture, the fungus can be induced to produce fruit bodies under suitable conditions.|$|E
5|$|Precipitation, {{especially}} rain, has {{a dramatic}} effect on agriculture. All plants {{need at least}} some water to survive, therefore rain (being {{the most effective means}} of watering) is important to agriculture. While a regular rain pattern is usually vital to healthy plants, <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>or</b> too little rainfall can be harmful, even devastating to crops. Drought can kill crops and increase erosion, while overly wet weather can cause harmful fungus growth. Plants need varying amounts of rainfall to survive. For example, certain cacti require small amounts of water, while tropical plants may need up to hundreds of inches of rain per year to survive.|$|E

25|$|The leg in {{the initial}} {{position}} bends very slightly at the knees, and then kicks the lower leg and the foot downwards similar to kicking a football. The legs may be bent inward (or occasionally outward) slightly. After the kick, the straight leg moves back up.

25|$|Uneven {{pigmentation}} of {{some sort}} affects most people, regardless of bioethnic background or skin color. Skin may either appear lighter, or darker than normal, or lack pigmentation at all; there may be blotchy, uneven areas, patches of brown to gray discoloration or freckling. Apart from blood-related conditions such as jaundice, carotenosis, or argyria, skin pigmentation disorders generally occur because the body produces either <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>or</b> too little melanin.|$|E
25|$|The {{health effects}} of salt are the {{conditions}} associated with the consumption of either <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>or</b> too little salt. Salt is a mineral composed primarily of sodium chloride (NaCl) and is used in food for both preservation and flavor. Sodium ions are needed in small quantities by most living things, as are chloride ions. Salt is involved in regulating the water content (fluid balance) of the body. The sodium ion itself is used for electrical signaling in the nervous system.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} for gas blenders to create toxic and dangerous gas mixes for divers. <b>Too</b> <b>much</b> <b>or</b> too little oxygen in the mix can be fatal for the diver. Oxygen analysers are {{used to measure the}} oxygen content of the mix after blending. Inadequate mixing may cause inaccurate analysis. To ensure that the composition of the gas is known by the end user, the contents are analysed {{in the presence of the}} diver who acknowledges the contents by signing a log.|$|E
25|$|Changes in the {{schedule}} or environment, delusions, hallucinations, misperceptions, and sleep problems also may trigger behavior changes. It {{can help people}} with DLB to encourage exercise, simplify the visual environment, stick to a routine, and avoid asking <b>too</b> <b>much</b> (<b>or</b> too little) of them. Speaking slowly and sticking to essential information improves communication. The potential for visual misperception and hallucinations, {{in addition to the}} risk of abrupt and dramatic swings in cognition and motor impairment, should put families on alert to the dangers of driving with DLB.|$|E
25|$|Average urine {{production}} in adult humans is around 1.4 L of urine {{per person per}} day with a normal range of 0.6 to 2.6 L {{per person per day}}, produced in around 6 to 8 urinations per day depending on state of hydration, activity level, environmental factors, weight, and the individual's health. Producing <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>or</b> too little urine needs medical attention. Polyuria is a condition of excessive production of urine (> 2.5 L/day), oliguria when < 400 mL are produced, and anuria one of < 100 mL per day.|$|E

25|$|Copper is an {{essential}} trace element that {{is vital to the}} health of all living things (humans, plants, animals, and microorganisms). In humans, copper is essential to the proper functioning of organs and metabolic processes. The human body has complex homeostatic mechanisms which attempt to ensure a constant supply of available copper, while eliminating excess copper whenever this occurs. However, like all essential elements and nutrients, <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>or</b> too little nutritional ingestion of copper can result in a corresponding condition of copper excess or deficiency in the body, each of which has its own unique set of adverse health effects.|$|E
25|$|Symptoms of the {{depressive}} {{phase of}} bipolar disorder include persistent feelings of sadness, irritability or anger, loss {{of interest in}} previously enjoyed activities, excessive or inappropriate guilt, hopelessness, sleeping <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>or</b> not enough, changes in appetite and/or weight, fatigue, problems concentrating, self-loathing or feelings of worthlessness, and thoughts of death or suicide. In severe cases, the individual may develop symptoms of psychosis, a condition also known as severe bipolar disorder with psychotic features. These symptoms include delusions and hallucinations. A major depressive episode persists {{for at least two}} weeks, and may result in suicide if left untreated.|$|E
25|$|A {{reason that}} our galaxy is {{considered}} rare by Rare Earth {{is because it}} appears to have suffered fewer collisions with other galaxies over the last 10 billion years, and its peaceful history may have made it more hospitable to complex life than galaxies which have suffered more collisions, and consequently more supernovae and other disturbances. The level of activity of the black hole at the centre of the Milky Way may also be important: <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>or</b> too little and the conditions for life may be even rarer. The Milky Way black hole appears to be just right. The orbit of the Sun around the center of the Milky Way is indeed almost perfectly circular, with a period of 226 Ma (1 Ma=1 million years), one closely matching the rotational period of the galaxy. However, the majority of stars in barred spiral galaxies populate the spiral arms rather than the halo and tend to move in gravitationally aligned orbits, so there is little that is unusual about the Sun's orbit. While the Rare Earth hypothesis predicts that the Sun should rarely, if ever, have passed through a spiral arm since its formation, astronomer Karen Masters has calculated that the orbit of the Sun takes it through a major spiral arm approximately every 100 million years. Some researchers have suggested that several mass extinctions do correspond with previous crossings of the spiral arms.|$|E

500|$|Art {{historian}} Cornelius Vermeule said of Flanagan's quarter, [...] "a die designer {{could do}} little wrong in having Houdon's Neoclassic image as his prototype... Still, {{it might be}} asked {{whether or not it}} was fair to force an ideal portrait of Washington made in 1785 on an artist working in 1932. There is something cold and lifeless about the results." [...] Vermeule suggests that the quarter started a trend of similar portrait coins issued by the United States, notably the Jefferson nickel and Franklin half dollar. [...] The historian preferred Laura Fraser's version, and termed Flanagan's reverse [...] "a stiff bit of heraldry amid too large a wreath and <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>or</b> too large lettering".|$|E
