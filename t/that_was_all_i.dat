6000|$|... "No, no," [...] cried Molly. [...] "You're wrong. You're quite wrong. When you saw us, we {{were just}} agreeing {{that we should be}} very good friends. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>all.</b> <b>I</b> broke off the {{engagement}} before that. I--" ...|$|E
6000|$|The Commissioner's {{wife left}} hastily. The last {{sentence}} jarred upon her nerves. [...] "Doesn't ill-treat the child! As if <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>all!</b> <b>I</b> wonder what Tom {{would say if}} I only 'didn't ill-treat' Patsie!" ...|$|R
