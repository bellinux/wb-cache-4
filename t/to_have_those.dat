When is that quality of influence which our form of government was intended to secure to the electors to be restored? … in many parts of our country where the colored population is large the people of that race are by various devices deprived of any effective exercise of their political rights and of many of their civil rights. The wrong does not expend itself upon those whose votes are suppressed. Every constituency in the Union is wronged.|$|E

25|$|In 2012, Obama, who had {{previously}} demanded the resignation of Syria's president Bashar al-Assad, said {{that the use of}} chemical weapons by the Assad government would be crossing a red line and would entail U.S. military action. After reports on 21 August 2013 about the usage of chemical weapons in Syria, the Obama administration formally blamed the incident on the Syrian government and sought Congressional approval for military action in Syria. Besides, Obama sought support from Britain and France for an attack in Syria. The Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel approved plans for a barrage of Tomahawk cruise missile strikes <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>those</b> called off by Obama in September.

25|$|There are {{two types}} of {{township}} in Michigan: general law township and charter. Charter township status was created by the Legislature in 1947 and grants additional powers and stream-lined administration in order to provide greater protection against annexation by a city. As of April 2001, there were 127 charter townships in Michigan. In general, charter townships have many of the same powers as a city but without the same level of obligations. For example, a charter township can have its own fire department, water and sewer department, police department, and so on—just like a city—but it is not required <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>those</b> things, whereas cities must provide those services. Charter townships can opt to use county-wide services instead, such as deputies from the county sheriff's office instead of a home-based force of ordinance officers.|$|E
25|$|On November 18, {{head coach}} Kevin McHale {{was fired after}} the Rockets began {{the season with a}} 4–7 record. Later that night, Harden {{recorded}} 45 points and 11 assists in a 108–103 overtime win over the Portland Trail Blazers. On November 25, he recorded his fourth 40-point game of the season in a loss to the Memphis Grizzlies, dropping to 5–10 overall and 1–3 under interim coach J. B. Bickerstaff. Two days later, he recorded his third career 50-point game in a 116–114 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. On January 13, in his 492nd game, he scored 27 points against the Minnesota Timberwolves to reach 10,000 career points. On January 20, he recorded his first triple-double of the season and seventh of his career with 33 points, a career-high 17 rebounds and 14 assists in a 123–114 loss to the Detroit Pistons. He became the first player <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>those</b> numbers in a game since Wilt Chamberlain had 53 points, 32 rebounds and 14 assists on March 18, 1968. Four days later, he recorded second triple-double of the season with 23 points, 15 rebounds and 10 assists in a 115–104 win over the Dallas Mavericks. On February 2, he scored 26 points and tied a career-high with 14 assists as the Rockets snapped a three-game skid with a 115–102 win over the Miami Heat. On March 22, he recorded 24 points, a career-high 16 assists and seven rebounds in a 111–107 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. Three days later, he recorded his third triple-double of the season with 32 points, 13 assists and 11 rebounds in a 112–109 win over the Toronto Raptors. In March 2015, Harden recorded 457 points, 152 assists and 102 rebounds, becoming the first player to record at least 450 points, 150 assists and 100 rebounds in a single month since Oscar Robertson did so December 1967. On April 7, he tied a 38-year-old record for most turnovers in a season by committing his 366th turnover against the Phoenix Suns. He surpassed that record three days later against the Los Angeles Lakers. The Rockets scrapped into the postseason with a 41–41 record and an eighth-seeded finish. Harden completed the regular season with career high marks in points (29), assists (7.5) and rebounds (6.1) to join LeBron James, Michael Jordan and Oscar Robertson as the only players in NBA history to average at least 29 points, seven assists and six rebounds in a season.|$|E

It was played in New York and on country radio stations. Shortly {{after the release of}} [...] "Irreplaceable", Beyoncé told MTV: [...] "I love 'Irreplaceable'. I think it's important <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>those</b> songs. I've had so many {{people come up to me}} in tears, saying, 'I experienced my first breakup.

500|$|Millar {{described}} {{the first half}} of the film as being close to the graphic novel, and also said that the film's ending was similar, though it was relocated elsewhere from the setting in the graphic novel. The superhero costumes in the series were also removed, with the exception of the leather attire worn by Wesley and Fox. Coincidentally, this had been Millar's intent when writing the graphic novel, although he and artist J. G. Jones had forgotten to. He said, [...] "I wanted them <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>those</b> powers and then just wear those costumes for the initiation, but just for one panel. And then I forgot." [...] Millar also stated that he would have liked to keep the supervillain mythos that dictates the original comic in the film.|$|E

500|$|After {{six months}} of development, the team felt the game had not made enough progress. They {{examined}} other games and concluded that survival was a necessary component to implement. To achieve this, they devised enemies to present a threat, {{the first of which}} was the [...] "Lander". Jarvis enjoyed violent, action entertainment, and wanted the game <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>those</b> elements. However, he felt the action should have a reasonable objective. Inspired by the 1960s television show The Defenders, Jarvis titled the game Defender, reasoning that the title helped justify the violence. He added astronauts to expand on the space theme and give players something to defend while they shot enemies. The element of flying over a planetscape was added after a brainstorming session between Jarvis and Ritchie. The landscape is depicted as a line only a pixel wide, primarily because the hardware was not powerful enough to generate anything more detailed.|$|E
500|$|This {{brought the}} {{regiment}} into contact {{for the first}} time with someone it would later meet more seriously, Brigadier Bernard Law Montgomery (often referred to as [...] "Monty"), then commanding the 9th Infantry Brigade in Portsmouth. In 1937, the brigade was on an exercise in Wiltshire and RWY was attached to it for their two-week annual camp. The brigade major wrote that [...] " [...] was run like so much of the TA those days on rather feudal lines...when they heard they were going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>those</b> tremendous exercises – three nights out at a time – they jibbed violently....Most of them had looked forward to exercises all day and then going out for a bit of jollity at night." [...] The upshot was that the regiment was banished to a distant part of the camp where their socialising would not be disturbed by the Regulars. However, apparently the Yeomanry were so intrigued by Monty's exercises that their Commanding Officer (CO) approached him, asking to be included in the last brigade exercise.|$|E
500|$|In July 2014, Fazekas {{stated that}} it was [...] "fabulous from a writing perspective" [...] to have an eight episode order, as [...] "you can plan it and know where you're heading... They're all their own stories {{and they all have}} their own drive, but it's sort of {{building}} toward a big thing {{at the end of the}} eight episodes." [...] Elaborating on this, Atwell said, [...] "it's incredibly tight, the script, which is great. It's fast moving and fast paced but luckily because it's not stretched out of 22 episodes, nothing is diluted. Every line is vital to not only moving the story and the action [...] but also developing the characters." [...] The season's overarching storyline revolves around the chemical weapon Midnight Oil, which is based on the Madbomb of the Captain America comics. The Madbomb was originally considered for use in , before negotiations with actors to adapt the [...] "Civil War" [...] storyline were completed. Also in July, it was revealed that Carter's husband would be explored in the series. However, he was ultimately not explored much in the first season, with McFeely saying, [...] "This was the season where she says goodbye to Steve ... In a second season, she could be freer <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>those</b> conversations about a life after him." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1838, Stevens ran {{again for}} the legislature. [...] He hoped that if the {{remaining}} Anti-Masons and the emerging Whig Party gained a majority, he could be elected to the United States Senate, whose members until 1913 were chosen by state legislatures. [...] A campaign, dirty even {{by the standards of}} the times, followed. The result was a Democrat elected as governor, Whig control of the state Senate, and the state House in dispute, with a number of seats from Philadelphia in question, though Stevens won his seat in Adams County. [...] Stevens sought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>those</b> Philadelphia Democrats excluded, which would create a Whig majority that could elect a Speaker and himself as senator. [...] Amid rioting in Harrisburg—later known as the [...] "Buckshot War"—Stevens's ploy backfired, with the Democrats taking control of the House. [...] Stevens remained in the legislature most years through 1842, but the episode cost him much of his political influence, as the Whigs blamed him for the debacle and were increasingly unwilling to give leadership to someone who had not yet joined their party. Nevertheless, he supported the pro-business and pro-development Whig stances. He campaigned for the Whig candidate in the 1840 presidential election, former general [...] William Henry Harrison. [...] Though Stevens later alleged that Harrison had promised him a Cabinet position if elected, he received none, and any influence ended when Harrison died after a month in office, to be succeeded by John Tyler, a southerner hostile to Stevens's stances on slavery.|$|E
500|$|The {{second season}} {{introduces}} [...] "moving zorts," [...] an upgraded technique the film crew used {{to complete the}} effect where Druitt teleports. The zorts were used specifically to make the sequences where the cast around Heyerdahl freeze until he leaves the screen. The producers wanted to have the camera move during those shots, as they believed it would be [...] "way cooler <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>those</b> zorts on the move." [...] One of the more difficult moving zorts included a [...] "triple zort" [...] with other characters who could teleport on the same shot in [...] "End of Nights". The sequence was difficult for Tapping, as she had to carry a prop weighing approximately 73 pounds. A three-dimensional hologram of Rachel's office was included in [...] "Fragments"; it was originally intended to feature the hologram throughout the episode, but because doing so would be costly, the producers decided to have one scene with the hologram, so Henry could {{use it as a}} blueprint to make an identical office with boxes. For the finale, Anthem decided to make the macri and Big Bertha look like the same creature, though Bertha would be a considerably larger creature. Some scenes involve the macri interacting with real life objects, including clothing. To make a scene where the macri enters a jacket, Wilson used fishing wire to move a sleeve slightly. Big Bertha's actions meanwhile, were largely made underwater. Anthem found that making underwater effects was difficult because there was a different style of movement. Additionally, Anthem produced a sequence where Wexford launches depth charges from his ship. The producers were looking for stock footage of the dropping depth charges, but they could not find one in high-definition.|$|E
