This {{was the first}} usage of the Nintendo 3DS's sound capabilities for the Pokémon series, and Masuda expressed delight over improved sound quality and expression. Similar {{to the theme of}} X and Y themselves, the soundtrack of the games were designed to emphasize beauty. Kageyama sought inspiration from the music of France as well; however, he indicated hesitation in making the music sound too French. During an interview with Famitsu magazine, Masuda stated that the Japanese harp was used in place of an accordion in certain situations to avoid giving off excessive French vibes. Additionally, Kageyama cited Masuda himself as inspiration for his work. Although working primarily as the director for X and Y, Masuda composed the games' battle themes. In discussing , Masuda stated he wanted to <b>try</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> approach and added techno themes.|$|E
25|$|A {{campaign}} to improve water {{quality in the}} ship canal and the Mersey Basin began in 1985, which had implications for the treatment works. The National Rivers Authority set limits on the volumes of Biological Oxygen, suspended solids and ammonia in any effluent discharged in water courses. North West Water elected to <b>try</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> process called Biostyr to meet these demands, and subsequently, water quality in the canal reached the Class 2 standard, enabling coarse fish to thrive. The old secondary beds were declared a Site of Biological Importance in 1985. North West Water was privatised {{with the passing of}} the Water Act 1989. A pilot Biostyr plant was built in 1992, costing £2 million, and following the merger of North West Water with the North West Electricity Board (Norweb) in 1995, a contract {{for the construction of a}} 36 cell Biostyr plant was awarded. The project, costing £50 million, was completed in 1998.|$|E

500|$|In 1938, Ziff-Davis, a Chicago-based {{publisher}} {{looking to}} expand into the pulp magazine market, acquired Amazing Stories. [...] The number of science fiction magazines grew quickly; several new titles appeared {{over the next few}} years, including Fantastic Adventures, which was launched by Ziff-Davis in 1939 as a companion to Amazing. [...] Under the editorship of Raymond Palmer the magazines were reasonably successful but published poor quality work, and when Howard Browne took over as editor of Amazing in January 1950 he decided to try to move the magazine upmarket. [...] Ziff-Davis agreed to back the new magazine, and Browne put together a sample copy, but when the Korean War broke out Ziff-Davis cut their budgets and the project was abandoned. [...] Browne did not give up, and in 1952 received the go-ahead to <b>try</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> magazine instead, focused on high-quality fantasy, a genre which had recently become more popular. The first issue of Fantastic, dated Summer 1952, appeared on March 21 of that year.|$|E

On 11 October Chrisye performed [...] "Indonesia Perkasa" [...] ("Powerful Indonesia") at the opening ceremony of the 1997 Southeast Asian Games; the song was written for the event. The following month he released Kala Cinta Menggoda. The music video for the titular song, directed by Dimas Djayadiningrat, won the MTV Video Music Award for South-East Asia on 10 September 1998; Chrisye went to Los Angeles to accept the award at the Universal Amphitheatre.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, Scruggs {{was getting}} bored with {{repetition}} of the classic bluegrass fare. [...] By now, his sons were professional musicians, and he was caught up in their enthusiasm for more contemporary music. He said, [...] "I love bluegrass music, and still like to play it, but I do like to mix in some other music for my own personal satisfaction, because if I don't, I can get a little bogged down and a little depressed". Scruggs also wanted to play concerts in venues that normally featured rock and roll acts. Columbia Records executives told Flatt and Scruggs that they intended to <b>try</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> producer, Bob Johnston, instead of their long-time producer Don Law. Johnston had produced Bob Dylan's records. This new association produced Changin' Times, Nashville Airplane, and The Story of Bonnie and Clyde albums. [...] Flatt was not happy with some of this material — he didn't like singing Bob Dylan songs and refused to perform them, saying [...] "I can't sing Bob Dylan stuff, I mean. Columbia has got Bob Dylan, why did they want me?". Even the success of the Bonnie and Clyde album was not enough to prevent their breakup in 1969. After the split, Flatt formed a traditional bluegrass group with Curly Seckler and Marty Stuart called The Nashville Grass, and Scruggs formed the Earl Scruggs Revue with his sons.|$|E
