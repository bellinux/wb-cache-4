5|$|One of Combs' first {{official}} actions as governor {{was to call}} a special session of the legislature on December 19, 1959, to consider revising the state's constitution, which had been in effect since 1891. Calling a constitutional convention required that the General Assembly approve putting {{the issue of a}} convention on <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> <b>in</b> two consecutive legislative sessions. The call then had to be approved by Kentucky voters. Despite near-universal agreement by legal scholars that the constitution was badly in need of updating, Kentucky voters had rejected calls for a constitutional convention in 1931 and 1947, and had only approved 19 amendments since 1891. Combs wanted to address the issue during his four-year term, hence the haste in calling the special legislative session. The General Assembly easily approved the call for a convention during the special legislative session and again during the subsequent regular legislative session in 1960. Combs signed the measure, and the question of a constitutional revision was put on <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> <b>in</b> November 1960, when Kentucky voters defeated it by a margin of almost 18,000 votes. This was the closest Kentucky has come to replacing the 1891 constitution, which remains in effect today.|$|E

5|$|Pennsylvania Rep. William C. Kortz {{and retired}} {{manufacturer}} Joseph Vodvarka also {{ran in the}} Democratic primary, but neither remained {{for the duration of}} the race. Kortz, who was little known outside the western Pennsylvania area, dropped out of the race on January 14, 2010 after raising only $20,000 of the $2 million he sought to raise for his campaign. Vodvarka, an Allegheny County man who had been mostly overlooked throughout the race, was formally removed from <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> <b>in</b> mid-April 2010 after it was revealed he failed to garner the minimum amount of signatures for a nominating petition.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{the federal}} {{constitutional}} initiative allows citizens {{to put a}} constitutional amendment to a national vote, if 100,000 voters sign the proposed amendment within 18 months. The Federal Council and the Federal Assembly can supplement the proposed amendment with a counter-proposal, and then voters must indicate a preference on <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> <b>in</b> case both proposals are accepted. Constitutional amendments, whether introduced by initiative or in parliament, must be accepted by a double majority of the national popular vote and the cantonal popular votes.|$|E

Vogt without opposition, {{though he}} had died in April, {{a month before the}} May primary. (Vogt's was the only name on <b>the</b> <b>ballot.)</b> <b>In</b> September, the Democratic City Committee nominated State Representative Granville E. Jones in Vogt's place. For coroner, the nominations followed a similar pattern. The Hamilton-Meade faction nominated Edward E. Holloway, who defeated Meehan man Roger J. Soens and independent Vincent E.

5|$|In {{addition}} to her writing and speaking, Stanton was also instrumental in promoting women's suffrage in various states, particularly New York, Missouri, Kansas, where it was included on <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> <b>in</b> 1867, and Michigan, where it was put to a vote in 1874. She made an unsuccessful bid for a U.S. Congressional seat from New York in 1866, {{and she was the}} primary force behind the passage of the Woman's Property Bill that was eventually passed by the New York State Legislature.

City voters in 2006 passed two measures calling on UCSC {{to pay for the}} impacts of campus growth. A Santa Cruz Superior Court judge invalidated the measures, ruling they were improperly put on <b>the</b> <b>ballot.</b> <b>In</b> 2008, the university, city, county and neighborhood organizations reached an agreement to set aside numerous lawsuits and allow the expansion to occur. UCSC agreed to local government scrutiny of its north campus expansion plans, to provide housing for 67 percent of the additional students on campus, and to pay municipal development and water fees.|$|E
5|$|The electoral {{majority}} {{that brought the}} Democrats to power in 1951 combined organization Democrats with reform-minded independents. While successful in winning the election, the coalition started to fray soon after taking office. By 1954, however, Democrat James Hugh Joseph Tate and others in Council attempted to weaken the civil service reforms of the new charter by allowing city employees to be active in party politics. Dallas stood with the reform wing of the party, and the amendment effort fell {{just short of the}} two-thirds vote in Council to put the proposed charter amendment on <b>the</b> <b>ballot.</b> <b>In</b> doing so, Dallas worked against the wishes of Democratic City Committee chairman William J.

5|$|The nation {{initially}} did {{not know}} what to make of Coolidge, who had maintained a low profile in the Harding administration; many had even expected him to be replaced on <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> <b>in</b> 1924. Coolidge believed that those of Harding's men under suspicion were entitled to every presumption of innocence, taking a methodical approach to the scandals, principally the Teapot Dome scandal, while others clamored for rapid punishment of those they presumed guilty. Coolidge thought the Senate investigations of the scandals would suffice; this was affirmed by the resulting resignations of those involved. He personally intervened in demanding the resignation of Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty after he refused to cooperate with the congressional probe. He then set about to confirm that no loose ends remained in the administration, arranging for a full briefing on the wrongdoing. Harry A. Slattery reviewed the facts with him, Harlan F. Stone analyzed the legal aspects for him and Senator William E. Borah assessed and presented the political factors.|$|E

But few electors chose Taft and Butler, who won only Utah and Vermont, for a total of eight electoral votes. Roosevelt won 88, and Wilson 435. Wilson won though he had only a plurality of the popular vote and less of it than Taft and Roosevelt combined. Taft had hoped to better Roosevelt in the popular vote, but finished with just under 3.5 million, over 600,000 less than the former president. Taft was not on <b>the</b> <b>ballot</b> <b>in</b> California, due to the actions of local Progressives, nor in South Dakota.|$|E
5|$|Gravel did {{not compete}} in the initial 2008 vote, the Iowa caucuses, but was still {{subjected}} to a false report from MSNBC that he had {{pulled out of the}} race afterward.

There he received about 400 votes out of some 280,000 cast, or 0.14percent, before taking time off to improve his health. He resumed campaigning, but fared no better in subsequent states. By the end of January 2008, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and Gravel were the only remaining Democrats from the initial debates still running; Gravel vowed to stay in the presidential campaign until November. On March 11, 2008, Gravel continued to remain in the Democratic race but additionally endorsed a Green Party candidate for president, Jesse Johnson, saying he wanted to help Johnson prevail against Green Party rivals Cynthia McKinney and Ralph Nader.
