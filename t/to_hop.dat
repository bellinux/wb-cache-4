5|$|On the ground, the Australian magpie {{moves around}} by walking, {{and is the}} only member of the Artamidae to do so; woodswallows, butcherbirds and currawongs all tend <b>to</b> <b>hop</b> with legs parallel. The magpie has a short femur (thigh bone), and long lower leg below the knee, suited to walking rather than running, {{although}} birds can run in short bursts when hunting prey.|$|E
5|$|These sparrows feed {{primarily}} on {{seeds in the}} winter and insects in the spring and summer. The birds are often territorial, with males guarding their territory through song and displays. Flight is awkward for this species, which prefers <b>to</b> <b>hop</b> along the ground for locomotion. They are monogamous and breed during spring. Two to five eggs are laid in the bird's nest, which is cup-shaped and well hidden. Adult sparrows are preyed upon by house cats and small raptors, while young may be taken by a range of mammals and reptiles. They have been known to live for up to three years, two months. Although the species has been classified as least concern, or unthreatened with extinction, some subspecies are threatened by habitat destruction and one may be extinct.|$|E

However, the switch <b>to</b> <b>hops</b> started in Germany some four or five centuries before the Reformation. Its later gradual enforcement in the 15th and early 16th centuries can in part be traced through legislation drafted by political rulers before the Reformation started.|$|R

In order to avoid enemy fighter-bombers, the B-57s operated from several different airbases, taking off and returning to different bases <b>to</b> <b>hop</b> and avoid being attacked. The B-57 bombers would arrive over their targets in a stream at intervals of about 15 minutes, which led to achieving a major disruption of the overall IAF effort.|$|E
25|$|It {{is often}} {{reported}} that Swearengen died penniless while trying <b>to</b> <b>hop</b> a freight train, but recent research suggests {{he may have}} been murdered. According to his rediscovered obituary and contemporaneous newspaper accounts, Swearengen was found dead {{in the middle of a}} suburban Denver street on November 15, 1904, apparently of a massive head wound. Less than two months earlier, his twin brother Lemuel had been shot by unknown assailants, though suspiciously not robbed, and was perhaps mistaken for Al.|$|E

30|$|If we now {{compare the}} hop count {{for all the}} {{point-to-point}} connections between all the nodes, we notice that the maximum hop count is reduced from 14 <b>to</b> 8 <b>hops.</b> This is achieved because the maximum path length between a leaf node and the (virtual) sink is reduced from 7 <b>to</b> 4 <b>hops.</b> The average hop count is reduced from 6.06 <b>to</b> 5.4 <b>hops.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{enlargement}} or {{reduction of}} the path between two nodes is also possible in a DODAG with one sink. The structure of a DODAG can change over time. An example is that after a global repair, node 13 switches its preferred parent from node 18 to node 12. This will reduce the path length between nodes 12 and 13 from 3 <b>hops</b> <b>to</b> 1 <b>hop</b> and will increase the path length between nodes 13 and node 18 from 1 <b>hop</b> <b>to</b> 3 <b>hops.</b>|$|R
25|$|Arwing {{missions}} {{are similar to}} those of the first two games in the series. The player flies in space or close to the ground and shoots down enemies. Some levels are on rails, while others allow full freedom of movement in a relatively small area. As in previous games, the wing mates of Fox, the main character, occasionally call for help when chased by enemies. Additionally, in some levels, the player has the ability <b>to</b> <b>hop</b> in and out of the Arwing at will.|$|E
25|$|During the 1910s {{and early}} 1920s {{a number of}} {{researchers}} discovered that shorter wavelength signals were reflected off what would later be known as the ionosphere. This allowed the signal <b>to</b> <b>hop</b> over very long distances by reflecting multiple times off the ground and ionosphere. This greatly extended range, allowing lower power transmitters to be used for very long-range communications. By 1923 a number of amateur radio operators (hams) demonstrated excellent performance at 100m and started routine trans-Atlantic communications the next year. This led to a number of new frequency bands being defined in this shortwave region, as short as 10m (which is very long by today's standards). By 1930 these frequencies were in widespread use for many purposes.|$|E
25|$|The macropods {{are divided}} into three families: the Hypsiprymnodontidae, with the musky rat-kangaroo as its only member; the Potoroidae, with 11 species; and the Macropodidae, with 45 species. Macropods are found in all Australian environments except alpine areas. The Potoroidae include the bettongs, potaroos and rat-kangaroos, small species that make nests and carry plant {{material}} with their tails. The Macropodiae include kangaroos, wallabies and associated species; size varies widely within this family. Most macropods have large hind legs and long, narrow hind feet, with a distinctive arrangement of four toes, and powerfully muscled tails, which they use <b>to</b> <b>hop</b> around. The musky rat-kangaroo is the smallest macropod and the only species that is quadrupedal not bipedal, while the male red kangaroo is the largest, reaching a height of about 2m and weighing up to 85kg.|$|E

40|$|Resistance <b>to</b> <b>hops</b> is a {{prerequisite}} for lactic acid bacteria to spoil beer. In this study we analyzed mechanisms of hop resistance of Lactobacillus brevis at the metabolism, membrane physiology, and cell wall composition levels. The beer-spoiling organism L. brevis TMW 1. 465 was adapted to high concentrations of hop compounds and compared to a nonadapted strain. Upon adaptation <b>to</b> <b>hops</b> the metabolism changed to minimize ethanol stress. Fructose was used predominantly as a carbon source by the nonadapted strain but served as an electron acceptor upon adaptation <b>to</b> <b>hops,</b> with concomitant formation of acetate instead of ethanol. Furthermore, hop adaptation resulted in higher levels of lipoteichoic acids (LTA) incorporated into the cell wall and altered composition and fluidity of the cytoplasmic membrane. The putative transport protein HitA and enzymes of the arginine deiminase pathway were overexpressed upon hop adaptation. HorA was not expressed, and the transport of hop compounds from the membrane to the extracellular space did not account for increased resistance <b>to</b> <b>hops</b> upon adaptation. Accordingly, hop resistance is a multifactorial dynamic property, which can develop during adaptation. During hop adaptation, arginine catabolism contributes to energy and generation of the proton motive force until {{a small fraction of the}} population has established structural improvements. This acquired hop resistance is energy independent and involves an altered cell wall composition. LTA shields the organism from accompanying stresses and provides a reservoir of divalent cations, which are otherwise scarce as a result of their complexation by hop acids. Some of the mechanisms involved in hop resistance overlap with mechanisms of pH resistance and ethanol tolerance and as a result enable beer spoilage by L. brevis...|$|R
25|$|In walking, and {{for many}} animals running, the motion of legs {{on either side of}} the body {{alternate}}s, i.e. is out of phase. Other animals, such as a horse when galloping, or an inchworm, alternate between their front and back legs. An alternative to a gait that alternates between legs is hopping or saltation, where all legs move together. As a main means of locomotion, this is usually found in bipeds or semi-bipeds. Among the mammals saltation is commonly used among macropods (kangaroos and their relatives), jerboas, springhares, kangaroo rats, hopping mice, gerbils, and sportive lemurs. Certain tendons in kangaroo hind legs are very elastic, allowing kangaroos to effectively bounce along conserving energy from hop <b>to</b> <b>hop,</b> making hopping a very energy efficient way to move around in their nutrient poor environment. Saltation is also used by many small birds. Frogs and fleas also hop.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} {{link between}} the hopping action and breathing: as the feet leave the ground, air is {{expelled}} from the lungs; bringing the feet forward ready for landing refills the lungs, providing further energy efficiency. Studies of kangaroos and wallabies have demonstrated, beyond the minimum energy expenditure required <b>to</b> <b>hop</b> at all, increased speed requires very little extra effort (much less than the same speed increase in, say, a horse, dog or human), and the extra energy is required to carry extra weight. For kangaroos, the key benefit of hopping is not speed to escape predators—the top speed of a kangaroo is no higher than that of a similarly sized quadruped, and the Australian native predators are in any case less fearsome than those of other countries—but economy: in an infertile country with highly variable weather patterns, the ability of a kangaroo to travel long distances at moderately high speed in search of food sources is crucial to survival.|$|E

A noon attack was planned to mislead the Germans. On 6 September, a new attack was ordered with XIV Corps to advance to a line from Combles to Leuze Wood road, the Quadrilateral and Ginchy. The 55th Division to the north in the XV Corps area was to support the attack on Ginchy by attacking with the 164th Brigade, between the outskirts of the village and the eastern edge of Delville Wood.
