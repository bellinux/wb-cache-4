5|$|In north-west Nelson, {{there are}} three {{ecotypes}} defined by soil and exposure. Trees growing on limestone bluffs have stiff, blue-green leaves. On the river flats, <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> tall with narrow, lax, dark green leaves, and an uneven canopy. They resemble the cabbage trees of the North Island's East Cape. Along the coast to the far west, <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> robust with broad, bluish leaves. The latter two forms extend down the West Coast, with the lax-leaved forms growing in moist, fertile, sheltered river valleys while the bluish-leaved forms prefer rocky slopes exposed to {{the full force of}} the salt-laden coastal winds.|$|E
5|$|Silver birch {{can easily}} be {{confused}} with the similar downy birch (Betula pubescens). Yet, downy birch are characterised by hairy leaves and young shoots whereas the same parts on silver birch are hairless. The leaf base of silver birch is usually a right angle to the stalk while for downy birch it is rounded. In terms of genetic structure <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> quite different but do, however occasionally hybridise.|$|E
5|$|The site of North {{station has}} {{significantly}} changed. The ornate mausoleum of Sharif Al-Hussein Ben Ali (d.1998) stands directly opposite {{the remains of}} the platform. The operators of the Shia Islamic section of the cemetery have planted Leylandii along the boundary of their section of the cemetery, which includes the platform of North station. Unless <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> removed, {{the remains of the}} station will ultimately become hidden and destroyed by overgrowth.|$|E
5000|$|Hyperion was {{discovered}} August 25, 2006, by naturalists Chris Atkins and Michael Taylor. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> verified as standing 115.55 m tall by Stephen Sillett. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> {{found in a}} remote area of Redwood National and State Parks purchased in 1978. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> located at 41.20491 N and 124.01556 W, near Tom McDonald Creek and is accessible from <b>the</b> Tall <b>Trees</b> trailhead. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> estimated to contain [...] of wood. Sillett estimates <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> to <b>be</b> 600 years old while others report it to be roughly 700-800 years old.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> {{listed in}} <b>the</b> National Register of Historic Places under Criterion A, with NRIS number 76001576. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> {{placed in a}} Historic Preservation Zone at 18th Street and Cheyenne Avenue in Tulsa, Oklahoma in January, 1992. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> still living in 2014.|$|R
50|$|Another {{example is}} of a birds nest in a <b>tree.</b> <b>The</b> bird <b>is</b> benefitting because <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> giving <b>the</b> bird shelter and <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> not getting {{anything}} in return.|$|R
5|$|Old Village Farm (on Fishermans Lane) {{is now the}} {{location}} of a wood yard, used since the 1930s to prepare local willow for the production of cricket bats. <b>The</b> <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> grown at Harbour Hill Copse, where 70 trees are felled annually for this purpose. There are approximately 1000 trees growing at any given time. The workers at the yard cut the wood into approximate bat shapes, then cure the wood in a kiln. The clefts of wood are then shipped to India where the final manufacturing can be undertaken under moisture-controlled conditions.|$|E
5|$|Tarariki {{are found}} in the east of the North Island from East Cape to the Wairarapa. Māori valued the narrow spiky leaves as a source of {{particularly}} tough, durable fibre. Tarariki's strong leaf fibres may be an adaptation to the region's hot, dry summers. In parts of the Wairarapa, <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> particularly spiky, with stiff leaves and partially rolled leaf-blades. The trees near East Cape, by contrast, have leaves that hang laxly on the tree. In Hawke's Bay, some trees have greener, broader leaves, and this may be because of wharanui characteristics brought in across the main divide through the Manawatu Gorge.|$|E
5|$|Ficus rubiginosa {{was first}} {{cultivated}} in the United Kingdom in 1789, {{where it is}} grown in glasshouses. It is commonly used as a large ornamental tree in eastern Australia, in the North Island of New Zealand, and also in Hawaii and California, where it is also listed as an invasive species in some areas. It is useful as a shade tree in public parks and on golf courses. Not as prodigious as other figs, F. rubiginosa is suited to slightly more confined areas, such as lining car parks or suburban streets. However, surface roots can be large and intrusive and the thin bark readily damaged when struck. Tolerant of acid or alkaline soils, it is hardy to US Hardiness Zones 10B and 11, reaching 10m (35ft) high in 30 years. Planting trees 8–12m (30–40ft) apart will eventually result in a continuous canopy. <b>The</b> <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> of great value in providing fruit for birds and mammals, though drop large quantities of fruit and leaves, leaving a mess underfoot.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> {{considered}} sacred by Hindus as God Vishnu {{is believed}} to dwell in it. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> worshiped on Amalaka Ekadashi.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> {{variously}} rich in tannins {{that are}} of some antimicrobial interest. Some parts of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>are</b> used in regional traditional medicine.|$|R
5000|$|In the 20th century, {{during the}} {{construction}} boom in Bratislava, {{the area of}} <b>the</b> linden <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> endangered. In 1982, <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> proclaimed to <b>be</b> a preserved <b>tree.</b> <b>The</b> area <b>was</b> protected by fencing which enabled huge boughs to grow. Today the holes in <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> evidence of it. <b>The</b> linden <b>tree</b> however deprecated and today survived just as a remainder. In the 1990s its protection was cancelled. In 2003, <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> designated as <b>the</b> <b>Tree</b> - <b>the</b> Hero of the year 2003. <b>The</b> Bratislava <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> being {{referred to as the}} [...] "Palffy´s tree" [...] because it was displayed so in one masterpiece from 18th century. Referring to existing historical documents, <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> can <b>be</b> proven to be at least 236 years old. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> could <b>be</b> even older because no data is kept to prove whether <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> not in <b>the</b> past a <b>tree</b> connected and being part of [...] "Prepost" [...] gardens and maybe even the remainder of the original primeval forests of the Small Carpathian Mountains.|$|R
5|$|The {{ritual is}} {{the central part of}} the celebration. Vespers vary from place to place with respect to the time of the {{beginning}} of the service, its length and structure. The laying of badnjak on the fire usually comes after the service, and is done by a priest or by a respected parishioner. Before the burning, the tree may be processionally carried around the church. In the case of more than one badnjak, <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> placed in the shape of a cross. The assembled devotees throw then into the fire their twig bunches, each representing a small badnjak. The consecration or blessing is performed by a priest: he strews wheat grains over the badnjak, censes it while singing the Troparion of the Nativity, and as he intones prayers, he pours wine and spreads honey on it. Instead of applying wine and honey, holy water may be sprinkled on the tree by dipping a bunch of basil into a bowl with the water. This rite is generally performed after the placing on the fire, although it may happen before, in which case the consecration may be performed in the church itself or in its yard.|$|E
5|$|Young {{birds are}} {{initially}} mainly fed on invertebrates, often collected from low foliage or under bushes {{rather than in}} the grassland preferred by the adults. Adults will roam up to 1km (1000yd) from the nest on pasture or ploughed land. After fledging the young may accompany their parents until the onset of winter. Individuals or pairs will defend one or more fruit-bearing trees throughout the winter, mistletoe being preferred where available, with holly as the first choice elsewhere. Although the thrush normally feeds on the ground or other trees, the defence of this resource conserves the fruit for later in the season when other food items are becoming scarce. <b>The</b> <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> defended against conspecifics, other thrushes and species such as the bullfinch and great spotted woodpecker. In years when there is an abundance of winter fruit, this strategy may be abandoned, with the mistle thrushes foraging in flocks. Conversely, in hard winters, the defender may be overwhelmed by large flocks of fieldfares, redwings or Bohemian waxwings.|$|E
25|$|The {{spaces between}} <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> {{regularly}} fertilized.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> a {{vigorous}} grower with a large, dense canopy. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> moderately resistant to anthracnose {{and is a}} consistent but poor bearer.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> {{not known}} (2016) {{to be in}} {{cultivation}} beyond the Netherlands. It <b>is</b> claimed <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> able to 'grow easily in all soils'.|$|R
5000|$|The {{leaves are}} used for {{ornamental}} decoration during festivals. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> a main attraction in gardens throughout India. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> can <b>be</b> cut into various shapes and maintained in required sizes. In past, the flexible, straight and light-weight trunks {{were used in the}} making of masts for sailing ships. That <b>is</b> why <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> also known as <b>the</b> Mast <b>Tree.</b> Today, <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> mostly used for manufacturing small articles such as pencils, boxes, matchsticks, etc.|$|R
25|$|Ginkgos {{are also}} popular {{subjects}} for growing as penjing and bonsai; they can be kept artificially small and tended over centuries. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> easy to propagate from seed.|$|E
25|$|The Fabaceae have an {{essentially}} worldwide distribution, being found everywhere except Antarctica {{and the high}} arctic. <b>The</b> <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> often found in tropical regions, while the herbaceous plants and shrubs are predominant outside the tropics.|$|E
25|$|Where {{the olive}} is {{carefully}} cultivated, as in Languedoc and Provence, <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> regularly pruned. The pruning preserves the flower-bearing shoots {{of the preceding}} year, while keeping the tree low enough to allow the easy gathering of the fruit.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> a major tourist {{attraction}} for {{fans of the}} film, although located on private property at Malabar Farm. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> part of [...] "The Shawshank Trail" [...] which features many of the film's iconic locations and attracts up to 35,000 visitors annually. The farm where <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> located sometimes is a venue for weddings.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> an acacia, {{lying on}} a small mound on a promontory. Despite its small size, due to its remoteness, <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> an {{important}} landmark.|$|R
5000|$|In 1857 it {{was noted}} that the [...] "top half" [...] of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> broken off at about 150 feet, and that <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> hollow.|$|R
25|$|Pollards cut at {{only about}} a metre or so above the ground are called stubs (or stubbs). These were often used as markers in coppice or other woodland. Stubs cannot be used where <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> browsed by animals, as the regrowing shoots are below the browse line.|$|E
25|$|Cliff's {{patterns}} are highly stylised and interpreted in strong colours, {{such as the}} 1933 Honolulu pattern. <b>The</b> <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> enamelled in red (coral) orange and yellow. Cliff produced a colourway variation on this by simply changing the trees to shades of blue and pink, and this was then called Rudyard after a local Staffordshire beauty spot.|$|E
25|$|In 1956, Rabbi Yeshaye Gross, a Satmar from Brooklyn, {{proceeded}} {{to visit the}} orchards in Calabria, {{and found out that}} a large percentage of <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> actually grafted. From then on he realized that no etrog could be picked off the tree without a careful inspection, which he was allowed and able to do.|$|E
50|$|Parts of <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>are</b> {{used for}} dyestuff; <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> used for fodder; the foliage and seed pods make good forage for {{livestock}} and <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> stands up well to this use.|$|R
50|$|The {{remains of}} <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>were</b> removed on 29 July 2007. According to a Queensland Government release <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> {{undergoing}} {{a process of}} wood preservation {{and the remains of}} <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> - 7 metres tall and 2 across - are being transferred to a special preservation facility. In 2008 <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> successfully cloned in by workers at the former Queensland Department of Primary Industries.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> commercially {{available}} in the United States and Australia where it is popular as a bonsai subject. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> also listed in the UK until 2002.|$|R
25|$|The {{northern}} {{three-quarters of}} the property has tall mature deciduous trees sheltering most of the graves; the southern quarter is open. Among <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> a rare yucca {{and one of the}} few butternuts in the area. Rows of evergreens are located north and south of the hilltop; on the south the land is still wooded and not yet used for burials.|$|E
25|$|While Yukon {{is mostly}} covered with forests, most of <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> small {{and take a}} long time to grow and {{regenerate}} because of the dry cold climate. There is a considerable amount of small scale logging, but the only area that can sustain industrial forestry is in the southeast with its wetter climate. However, distance from markets and fluctuating prices have resulted in a boom-and-bust industry.|$|E
25|$|Caraiba grows very slowly; most of <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>are</b> 200–300 years old, {{and there}} has not been any {{regenerative}} growth for the last 50 years. In addition, 45% of the Caatinga dry forest in which the woodland galleries are embedded has been cleared for farms, ranches and plantations. Climate change resulting in desertification of significant parts of the Caatinga has permanently reduced the potential reclaimable habitat.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Teviotville <b>Tree</b> <b>is</b> {{located on}} private {{property}} in Teviotville. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> used in <b>the</b> filming of the 2010 film <b>The</b> <b>Tree.</b>|$|R
50|$|No {{specific}} aging {{statistics for}} <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>are</b> available, however, {{based on its}} size, numerous forestry sources, including the county's historical marker for <b>the</b> <b>tree,</b> estimate that <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> at least 2,000 years old.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> in {{a second}} growth forest and is much taller than <b>the</b> {{surrounding}} <b>trees.</b> <b>The</b> original old-growth forest was first logged in the 1893, yet this individual <b>tree</b> <b>was</b> spared. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> very large at the base as it flares out above ground into the root system. Many of its branches are covered in moss. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>is</b> surrounded by a fence to protect its root system from excessive trampling.|$|R
