40|$|Squids are {{cephalopods}} {{widely used}} as food in many cultures, {{where they are}} customarily cooked {{as a means of}} enhancing nutritional value, and as a way of temporarily preserving squid from spoilage. Modelled on a cooked, comminuted and fermented mussel product developed at AUT, this project primarily aimed to develop a tenderized fermented squid product in the form of spread or pieces. Squid mantle is chewy by virtue of its high collagen content. While this may appeal to some consumers, the New Zealand culinary tradition uses kiwifruit proteases to minimise this chewiness. Zyactinase, a standardized kiwifruit protease was used in this study as well as freshly prepared kiwifruit extract. Various product forms such as minced, bowl chopped and chopstick-suitable pieces were compared. Irrespective of the use of enzyme, during the preparation of fermented product, minced and bowl chopped squid mantles expanded when the required evacuation was applied. This was undesirable. It was laborious to expel all the gas from the system necessary for the subsequent anaerobic fermentation. It was also noticed that the finer the cut the harder it was to achieve the required vacuum. Light and electron microscopy revealed the fine structure of squid mantle, which led to this packaging problem. Therefore the preparation of finely comminuted squid spread was discontinued. Chopstick-suitable fermented pieces were more promising because they could be easily vacuum packed. The cooking step prior to evacuation and fermentation was thought to be a useful way of limiting the protease activity through enzyme denaturation. Over tenderized squid develops a mushy texture, and exposure to protease also led to a yellowing of squid mantle, possibly linked to the Maillard reaction. Thus the tenderizing effects of the kiwifruit protease preparations were examined under varying conditions of concentration, pH and incubation period. Based on the earlier experiments with comminuted squid, 1 % Zyactinase to the weight of the squid tissue was chosen as the starting point for <b>tenderising</b> the chopstick-suitable fermented product. However, it took overnight incubation to tenderise the mantle pieces. In contrast, freshly prepared kiwifruit was highly effective in tendering squid pieces when marinated for only five hours. Thus, the tendering ability of Zyactinase was questionable. The pH of the incubation medium can influence the texture of squid mantle, and it was found that acidic conditions toughened the mantle pieces irrespective of the presence of protease. This could be linked to the denaturation effect of food acids {{in the same way that}} the raw fish becomes sushi on the addition of lemon juice or vinegar. Fermentation was successful throughout the studies, with or without enzymes. The lactic acid produced might be anticipated to affect texture, but there were no significant difference in the textural values of squid pieces between after enzyme incubation and after fermentation, when enzyme incubations were conducted at ambient pH. In respect of <b>tenderising,</b> the springiness of the squid pieces was close to unity in most of the preparations with or without enzyme under varying pH and incubation times. However, a slight but significant drop in toughness was found for pieces after fermentation In conclusion, cooked fermented squid pieces could be commercially produced in a commercial environment, but Zyactinase is not effective as a tenderiser...|$|E
40|$|Pineapple crowns are an {{agricultural}} waste available in large quantity particularly from canned pineapple industry. Alternatives to its efficient utilisation are necessary as the crowns contain high enzyme activity {{which can be}} potentially used as a meat tenderiser. Thus, the aims {{of this study are}} to extract and purify bromelain from the pineapple crowns. The purified bromelain was freeze dried to produce bromelain powder which was later applied to tenderise the toughest Brahman part, round. The action of bromelain in <b>tenderising</b> beef was affected by different pHs of beef, immersion temperatures and times, and bromelain solution concentrations. Thus, response surface methodology (RSM) was used to determine the feasible optimum condition for the beef tenderisation by bromelain. The effect of bromelain treatment on the physico-chemical properties of beef and its nutritional quality was determined. The nutritional quality of beef was determined from the proximate extent between the bromelain-treated beef and the reference pattern protein and compared with the untreated beef. SDS-PAGE revealed that bromelain from pineapple crowns is a monomelic with a molecular weight of 30 kDa. The bromelain powder was less pure compared to that of standard bromelain powder. The bromelain powder stored in the frozen temperature was the most stable since it showed very little loss in bromelain activity and the lowest value in water activity compared to bromelain powder stored in the chilled and room temperatures after four weeks of storage. The beef tenderization treated with bromelain could be optimised by 89. 91 % at the feasible optimum condition whereby the pH of beef was 5. 6, the immersion temperature was 60 °C, the concentration of bromelain solution was 0. 17 % and the immersion time was 10 minutes. Bromelain decreased the hardness, water holding capacity (WHC), moisture content and a* value of beef. On the other hand, bromelain increased the pH, cooking loss, and L* and b* values of beef. Bromelain also fragmented and denatured the proteins in beef. The proximate extent of the bromelain-treated beef (0. 57) was inclined towards the reference pattern protein (1. 00) compared to the untreated beef (0. 51). This indicated that beef treated with bromelain had a desirable effect on the nutritional quality of beef. This study can contribute in promoting and increasing the economic value of beef. At the same time, the extraction of bromelain from pineapple crowns can solve the waste disposal problem generated by the canned pineapple industry...|$|E
40|$|The {{wireless}} {{sensor network}} is a paradigm shift from the conventional wired system and has made remarkable progress {{in the last ten}} years. The system is cost effective, efficient, and user friendly as {{there is no need for}} external cables to interconnect devices. There are significant opportunities widely available to assess existing wired systems, and with thorough feasibility studies, most of these could be easily converted into wireless systems. A conceptual pH Wireless Sensor Network based on decentralized architectural paradigm is proposed in this thesis to introduce wireless connectivity and enhance system characteristics of a wired meat <b>tenderising</b> system. The network consists of pH Sensor Nodes and Stimuli Actuator Nodes. The focus of this thesis is the architectural design of these nodes and development of prototypes. Carcass pH is determined non-intrusively using a proprietary pH analysis alogrithm and process. This method enables pH analysis of carcasses in a meat plant without stopping the conveyor. The basis of the design is distributed processing and the collaborative nature of a Wireless Sensor Network. This showed that a network of sensor/actuator nodes could replace the existing wired meat tenderizing system and effectively handle the meat tenderizing process. The key benefit anticipated from the proposed wireless network node architecture in this thesis, is an intelligent re-configurable system that is compact, modular, cheaper and easier to install. The need for precise and consistent results creates an opportunity for further improvements to signature (spectrum of carcass response to stimuli) sensing and signature analysis algorithm. There is also scope for adding intelligence to the actuator nodes to aid in developing a fault tolerant system with a failsafe mode. While this project is a miniaturised version of real time process control, future studies could target replacement of wired industrial process control entirely with {{wireless sensor network}}s. The objectives of the project were met following the set up of the ZigBig network to simulate meat tenderizing process control, and design of the sensor node and actuator node architecture.

The major achievement of the project was the development of sensor node and actuator node prototypes, consistent with the expectations of the sponsors and handed over to Merit of Measurement, Auckland...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the optimum condition for the tenderization of beef by bromelain using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). Initially, bromelain powder was produced from pineapple crown of variety N 36. Production of the bromelain powder involves several process steps such as extraction, purification, desalting and freeze drying. The cube size beef of round part was treated with bromelain at different pHs of beef, immersion temperatures, bromelain solution concentrations, and immersion times according to the experimental design which was recommended by RSM of MINITAB software version 15. Beef tenderness was then measured by Texture Analyser. The MINITAB software Version 15 was used to optimise the tenderisation of beef by bromelain. The determination coefficient R 2 was 99. 97 % meaning that the experimental data were acceptable. It was found that beef could be optimize <b>tenderised</b> 89. 907 % at the optimum condition at pH of beef of 5. 4, immersion temperature of 60 ℃, bromelain solution concentration of 0. 1682 % and immersion time of 10 minutes.

40|$|Actinidin from kiwifruit can <b>tenderise</b> {{meat and}} help to add value to low-value meat cuts. Compared with other {{traditional}} tenderisers (e. g. papain and bromelain) it is a promising way, due to its less intensive tenderisation effects on meat. But, as with other plant proteases, over-tenderisation of meat may occur if the reaction is not controlled. Therefore, the objectives {{of this study were}} (1) finding a suitable process to control the enzyme activity after desired meat tenderisation has been achieved; (2) optimising the dual processing conditions- actinidin pre-treatment followed by sous vide cooking to achieve the desired tenderisation in shorter processing times. The first part of the study focused on the thermal inactivation of actinidin in freshly-prepared kiwifruit extract (KE) or a commercially available green kiwifruit enzyme extract (CEE). The second part evaluated the effects of actinidin pre-treatment on texture and in vitro protein digestibility of sous vide cooked beef brisket steaks. The results showed that actinidin in KE and CEE was inactivated at moderate temperatures (60 and 65 °C) in less than 5 min. However, the enzyme inactivation times increased considerably (up to 24 h at these temperatures) for KE/CEE-meat mixtures, compared with KE/CEE alone. The thermal inactivation kinetics were used as a guide for optimising actinidin application parameters during {{the second phase of the}} study. For the final experiments, beef steaks were injected with 5 % (w/w, extract/meat) of CEE solution (3 mg/mL) followed by vacuum tumbling (at 4 °C for 15 min) and cooking (at 70 °C for 30 min) under sous vide conditions. This cooking time was considerably less than usual sous vide cooking times used in the meat industry. The actinidin-treated meat had no change in pH and colour, but showed a lower instrumental shear force; and improved sensory scores for tenderness, juiciness and flavour than the untreated meat steaks when tested by a sensory panel. Improved tenderness agreed well with the Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) results that showed considerable breakdown of the myofibrillar structure, particularly around the Z line. The addition of actinidin enhanced the rate of breakdown of muscle proteins, as shown by Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and led to an increase in both protein solubility and ninhydrin-reactive free amino N release, during simulated gastric digestion. These results demonstrate the positive effects of actinidin on meat tenderness and meat protein digestibility during gastric digestion in vitro...|$|R
