5|$|It {{must seem}} {{to the reader}} that this Colonel Beriah Norton was a traitor to his own people, but {{what could he do}} but give in to Grey's command! Grey had the force and the power and could have {{destroyed}} the towns on the island in half a day, and would have done so if they had resisted in any way. In the diary, September 12th and 13th are omitted. <b>Those</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> days when the British troops were ravaging the island from Edgartown to Gay Head.|$|E

5|$|All {{the regular}} first-choice players signed on {{again for the}} new campaign, apart from goalkeeper George Hollis. Of the less regular team members, Bernard Pumfrey left for Midland League club Gainsborough Trinity, William Reynolds and Gilbert Smith were {{released}} to join Birmingham & District League club Berwick Rangers, and Chris Charsley retired from League football to concentrate on his police career. Small Heath signed the former Sunderland full back Jack Oliver, whom they had failed to recruit earlier in the season, and forward Charlie Letherbarrow from Walsall, but <b>those</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> only major signings. The squad was boosted by players from local football, who included Alec Leake, Bill Lewis and a young Billy Pratt. Alfred Jones continued as secretary-manager, and Caesar Jenkyns retained the captaincy. There were no changes to the team's kit of light blue shirts with navy collar trim, cuffs and pocket, white knickerbockers and navy socks.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the next season, Morris was not made Australian captain despite being the {{incumbent}} vice-captain. Instead, he remained as deputy as Victoria's Ian Johnson was recalled to the team and assumed the captaincy. There was speculation that the two Queensland board members voted for Morris, the three New South Wales delegates voted for Miller, while the remainder voted Johnson. When England returned to Australia in 1954–55, Morris made his first Test century in almost four years during the opening Test at Brisbane. After English skipper Len Hutton won the toss and controversially sent Australia in, Morris made 153 to lay the foundation for a score of 8/601 declared and an innings victory. This included a partnership of 202 runs with Neil Harvey. The pair scored at a rate of nearly four runs per over, despite both players being repeatedly struck by the bowling of Frank Tyson, who was regarded as the fastest bowler of his era. <b>Those</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> only centuries made by Australian batsmen for the entire series, and Morris was covered in bruises; he deliberately used his body to fend off short-pitched balls rather than risk a catch.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} settle the matter, the federal {{authorities}} set up a five-member commission presided over by Milovan Đilas in June 1945. The commission identified three sets of disputed territories. <b>Those</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> districts of Subotica, Sombor, Apatin and Odžaci in Bačka, districts of Batina and Darda in Baranja, and districts of Vukovar, Šid and Ilok in Syrmia. The districts in Bačka were awarded to Vojvodina, while those in Baranja were awarded to Croatia, both primarily along ethnic lines. The commission also noted that if Yugoslavia managed to acquire the region of Baja from Hungary, the decision regarding Bačka would be reviewed. The district of Vukovar was also awarded to Croatia, while Ilok and Šid were assigned to Vojvodina. In case of Ilok, the decision was specified to be provisional until authorities are consolidated {{on either side of}} the boundary, when the issue would be reexamined.|$|E

5|$|The President of Croatia {{is elected}} for a five-year term by a direct vote of all {{citizens}} in a majority system, requiring runoff elections if no candidate wins more than 50 percent of {{votes in the}} first round. Members of Parliament are elected for a four-year term in ten multi-seat constituencies, with additional members elected in special constituencies reserved for the Croatian diaspora and national minorities. As of November 2011, legislation provides for the election of 151 members of the unicameral parliament (including three representatives of the Croatian diaspora and eight representatives of national minorities). Out of 31 political parties which won seats in Croatian parliamentary elections held since 1990, only six have won ten seats or more in any one parliamentary election. <b>Those</b> <b>were</b> <b>the</b> Croatian Democratic Union, the Croatian Peasant Party, the Croatian People's Party – Liberal Democrats, the Croatian Social Liberal Party, Social Democratic Party of Croatia and the Bridge of Independent Lists. The county prefects, city/town mayors and municipality presidents are elected for four-year term {{by a majority of}} votes cast within applicable local government units, with a runoff election if no candidate achieves a majority {{in the first round of}} voting. Members of county, city/town and municipal councils are elected for a four-year term through proportional representation, with the entire local government unit as a single constituency.|$|E
