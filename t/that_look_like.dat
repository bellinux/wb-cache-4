5|$|In North America, C.violaceus favours conifers, and, though rare {{over much}} of the continent, is {{relatively}} common in certain areas, including Mount Rainier National Park and Olympic National Park. It is more common in old growth forest in the Pacific Northwest, though has sprung up in regrowth areas populated with fir, pine, aspen and alder in the Great Lakes region. Fruit bodies occur singly or in small groups, often near rotting wood, and can grow in fairy rings. Closely related species <b>that</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> C.violaceus can be found in Central and South America, Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|Written by David Fisher, {{this story}} was {{discussed}} with Script Editor Douglas Adams in late 1979, shortly before Adams left Doctor Who. It would have featured the Doctor battling the Nephilim, creatures who travel through time in sleeping units <b>that</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> sarcophagi. The name Nephilim was drawn from the Old Testament and from various Jewish writings, where it refers {{to a kind of}} demon. New producer Nathan-Turner was not interested and instead The Leisure Hive was developed as the season opener.|$|E
5|$|The first {{element in}} the scheme of painted {{architecture}} is a definition of the real architectural elements by accentuating the lines where spandrels and pendentives intersect with the curving vault. Michelangelo painted these as decorative courses <b>that</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> sculpted stone moldings. These have two repeating motifs, a formula common in Classical architecture. Here, one motif is the acorn, the symbol of the family of both Pope Sixtus IV, who built the chapel, and Pope Julius II, who commissioned Michelangelo's work. The other motif is the scallop shell, one of the symbols of the Madonna, to whose assumption the chapel was dedicated in 1483. The crown of the wall then rises above the spandrels, to a strongly projecting painted cornice that runs right around the ceiling, separating the pictorial areas of the biblical scenes from the figures of Prophets, Sibyls, and Ancestors, who literally and figuratively support the narratives. Ten broad painted crossribs of travertine cross the ceiling and divide it into alternately wide and narrow pictorial spaces, a grid that gives all the figures their defined place.|$|E

25|$|Schecter {{has also}} {{made an effort to}} appeal to more select market {{segments}} by occasionally producing a very limited run of its mass-produced guitar models equipped with novelty finishes. The 'Aviation Series', which appeared around 2006 and ran for about a year, took certain mass-produced model bodies (the PT, Tempest, S-1, etc.) and equipped them with World War II US (and British) aircraft color and marking patterns, and even special pickup covers <b>that</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> cooling louvers.|$|E
25|$|Historically the European {{medicinal}} leech, another invertebrate parasite, {{has been}} used in medicine to remove blood from patients. They have three jaws (tripartite) <b>that</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> little saws, and on them are about 100 sharp teeth used to incise the host. The incision leaves a mark that is an inverted Y inside of a circle. After piercing the skin and injecting anticoagulants (hirudin) and anaesthetics, they suck out blood, consuming up to ten times their body weight in a single meal.|$|E

The site was founded by Koos Plegt and Paul Neve in 2006, and became widely known after being featured on several television programmes across Europe and Australia. The site is now only run by Neve. As of February 2013, the site contained photographs of over 8,000 cats, submitted by owners with digital cameras and internet access and then approved by Neve as content.|$|E

25|$|For instance, {{breast cancer}} cells {{look the same}} whether they {{are found in the}} breast or have spread {{to another part of the}} body. So, if a tissue sample taken from a tumor in the lung {{contains}} cells <b>that</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> breast cells, the doctor determines that the lung tumor is a secondary tumor. Still, the determination of the primary tumor can often be very difficult, and the pathologist may have to use several adjuvant techniques, such as immunohistochemistry, FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization), and others. Despite the use of techniques, in some cases the primary tumor remains unidentified.|$|E
25|$|The temple {{occupies}} {{parts of}} the first floor {{and all of the}} fourth, fifth, and sixth floors of the building. The interiors of these floors were completely renovated. The walls were soundproofed so traffic noise would not interrupt temple patrons. The total floor area for the temple part of the building is , with two progressive ordinance rooms and two sealing rooms. Unlike many of the smaller temples built since the pilot program, the ordinance rooms are perpendicular to each other to adapt to the size limitations of the building. The cornerstone containing the year of dedication, commonly found on the outside facade of most temples, is located in the interior lobby next to the elevator which leads to the chapel portion of the building. Inside the temple, beehives are carved into the molding, and door handles <b>that</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> the Statue of Liberty torch are found throughout. Paintings on the walls of many of the rooms depict scenes from nature.|$|E
25|$|As {{with most}} members of the {{composite}} family, the actual flowers appear in two different froms: as ray florets, which have strap-like appendages <b>that</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> petals and project around the outside of the capitulum, and as disc florets, which appear {{at the center of the}} flower head and are very small. The ray florets number between 5 and 10, though as many as 12 may be present. Their straps are white and measure 6 to 12mm long by 1.5 to 2.2mm wide. The disc florets number from 12 to 19 and up to 25 and have yellow corollas (i.e. petals, though they are fused into a tube) that are 4.1 to 4.8 and exceptionally 5.5mm long. Their corollas are abruptly ampliate, or enlarged, with tubes that are longer than their campanulate throats. The tubes measure 2.3 to 2.6mm while the throats are typically only 0.9 to 1.2mm long. The lobes, i.e. the friges of the throat, are reflexed and lanceolate in shape, measuring 0.7 to 1.4mm.|$|E

25|$|The first {{indications}} of A-T usually occur during the toddler years. Children start walking at a normal age, {{but may not}} improve much from their initial wobbly gait. Sometimes they have problems standing or sitting still and tend to sway backward or from side to side. In primary school years, walking becomes more difficult, and children will use doorways and walls for support. Children with A-T often appear better when running or walking quickly in comparison to when they are walking slowly or standing in one place. Around {{the beginning of their}} second decade, children with typical forms of A-T start using a wheelchair for long distances. During school years, children may have increasing difficulty with reading because of impaired coordination of eye movement. At the same time, other problems with fine-motor functions (writing, coloring, and using utensils to eat), and with slurring of speech (dysarthria) may arise. Most of these neurologic problems stop progressing after the age of about 12 – 15 years, though involuntary movements may start at any age and may worsen over time. These extra movements can take many forms, including small jerks of the hands and feet <b>that</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> fidgeting (chorea), slower twisting movements of the upper body (athetosis), adoption of stiff and twisted postures (dystonia), occasional uncontrolled jerks (myoclonic jerks), and various rhythmic and non-rhythmic movements with attempts at coordinated action (tremors).|$|E
500|$|Primarily {{a central}} midfielder, {{although}} he is also capable of playing on the left, in a holding role, or even as an attacking midfielder, Pogba {{has been described by}} his club Manchester United as a [...] "powerful, skilful, and creative" [...] player who has [...] "an eye for goal and a penchant for the spectacular." [...] In Italy, he gained the nicknames Il Polpo Paul ("Paul the Octopus") for his long legs <b>that</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> tentacles during tackling or running and [...] "Pogboom" [...] for his explosive playing style and energy on the pitch. A large, quick, hard-working and physically strong player, he excels in the air, and is also known for his stamina, as well as his powerful and accurate striking ability from distance; he has also drawn praise for his finesse, technique, flair, and dribbling skills. His characteristics and playing role in midfield have led him to be compared with former France international Patrick Vieira.|$|E
500|$|While rejecting this {{thematic}} {{concern as}} unrealized by Argento, McDonagh {{noted that the}} result of the director's experiment is a strange [...] "architectural landscape" [...] that becomes the [...] "key element in differentiating Tenebrae from Argento's earlier gialli." [...] Argento's use of unusual architectural space and so-called visual [...] "hyper-realism" [...] results in an enormously fake looking environment. Seizing on the director's additional comment, [...] "...I dreamed an imaginary city in which the most amazing things happen", she notes that the film's [...] "fictive space couldn't be less 'real'", with its [...] "vast unpopulated boulevards, piazzas <b>that</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> nothing more than suburban American malls, hard-edged Bauhaus apartment buildings, anonymous clubs and parking garages." [...] The EUR district of Rome, where much of Tenebrae was filmed, was built in preparation for the 1942 World's Fair, and intended by then-Prime Minister of Italy Benito Mussolini to be a celebration of twenty years of fascism. Rostock believes that Argento used this location as an attempt to realize his theme of an imaginary city; the district gives a glimpse of a future Rome that never was, showing the city how it might have looked had fascism not fallen.|$|E
