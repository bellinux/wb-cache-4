40|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{contains}} two distinct l-glutamate dehydrogenases. These enzymes are affected in a reciprocal fashion by growth on ammonia or dicarboxylic amino acids as the nitrogen source. <b>The</b> <b>specific</b> activity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide}} phosphate (NADP) (anabolic) enzyme is highest in ammonia-grown cells and is reduced in cells grown on glutamate or aspartate. Conversely, <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> activity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) (catabolic) glutamate dehydrogenase is highest in cells grown on glutamate or aspartate and is much lower in cells grown on ammonia. <b>The</b> <b>specific</b> activity <b>of</b> both enzymes is very low in nitrogen-starved yeast.

While the newest appeal was taking place, Pica and a number of his supporters, who had {{traveled}} to Rome to appeal in person, died in Rome in 1200, and some of the monks alleged this was by poison administered on the orders of Savaric. Meanwhile, Innocent had changed his mind, and reinstalled Savaric as abbot, ordering some English clergy to judge <b>the</b> <b>specifics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case, and allot the revenues of the abbey between Savaric and the monks.

5|$|During the 640s, the Muslim {{conquest of}} Syria and Egypt {{created a new}} threat to Byzantium. Not only did the Arabs conquer {{significant}} recruiting and revenue-producing areas, but, after the utility of a strong navy was demonstrated by the short-lived Byzantine recapture of Alexandria in 644, they took to creating a navy of their own. In this effort the new Muslim elite, which came from the inland-oriented {{northern part of the}} Arabian peninsula, largely relied on the resources and manpower of the conquered Levant (especially the Copts of Egypt), which until a few years previously had provided ships and crews for the Byzantines. There is, however, evidence that in the new naval bases in Palestine shipwrights from Persia and Iraq were also employed. The lack of illustrations earlier than the 14th century means that nothing is known about <b>the</b> <b>specifics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early Muslim warships, although it is usually assumed that their naval efforts drew upon the existing Mediterranean maritime tradition. Given a largely shared nautical nomenclature, and the centuries-long interaction between the two cultures, Byzantine and Arab ships shared many similarities. This similarity also extended to tactics and general fleet organization; translations of Byzantine military manuals were available to the Arab admirals.|$|E
