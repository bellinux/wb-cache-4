5|$|Although stiff {{wheels are}} more energy {{efficient}} than {{other means of}} locomotion when traveling over hard, level terrain (such as paved roads), wheels are not especially efficient on soft terrain such as soil, because they are vulnerable to rolling resistance. In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy to the deformation of its wheels and the surface on which they are rolling. Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to this effect. Softer surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. Rolling resistance on medium to hard soil can be five to eight <b>times</b> <b>greater</b> than on concrete, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen <b>times</b> <b>greater.</b> While wheels must deform the surface along their entire path, limbs induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact.|$|E

5|$|The {{construction}} of the Scottish Parliament Building has generated controversy in several respects.

By early 2004, the estimated final cost of the project was set at £430m, some ten <b>times</b> <b>greater.</b>|$|E

5|$|As an A-type main {{sequence}} star, Beta Pictoris is more luminous than the Sun: combining the apparent magnitude of 3.861 with {{the distance of}} 19.44 parsecs gives an absolute magnitude of 2.42, {{as compared to the}} Sun, which has an absolute magnitude of 4.83. This corresponds to a visual luminosity 9.2 <b>times</b> <b>greater</b> than that of the Sun.

5|$|Cannabis {{can be a}} {{contributory}} {{factor in}} schizophrenia, potentially causing the disease in those who are already at risk. The increased risk may require the presence of certain genes within an individual or {{may be related to}} preexisting psychopathology. Early exposure is strongly associated with an increased risk. The size of the increased risk is not clear, but appears to be in the range of two to three <b>times</b> <b>greater</b> for psychosis. Higher dosage and greater frequency of use are indicators of increased risk of chronic psychoses.|$|E
5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} also binds to the hemeprotein myoglobin. It {{has a high}} {{affinity for}} myoglobin, about 60 <b>times</b> <b>greater</b> than that of oxygen. Carbon monoxide bound to myoglobin may impair its ability to utilize oxygen. This causes reduced cardiac output and hypotension, which may result in brain ischemia. A delayed return of symptoms have been reported. This results following a recurrence of increased carboxyhemoglobin levels; this effect {{may be due to}} a late release of carbon monoxide from myoglobin, which subsequently binds to hemoglobin.|$|E
