5|$|TRIM is a SATA {{command that}} enables the {{operating}} system to <b>tell</b> <b>an</b> SSD which blocks of previously saved data are no longer needed {{as a result of}} file deletions or volume formatting. When an LBA is replaced by the OS, as with an overwrite of a file, the SSD knows that the original LBA can be marked as stale or invalid and it will not save those blocks during garbage collection. If the user or operating system erases a file (not just remove parts of it), the file will typically be marked for deletion, but the actual contents on the disk are never actually erased. Because of this, the SSD does not know that it can erase the LBAs previously occupied by the file, so the SSD will keep including such LBAs in the garbage collection.|$|E

25|$|Kazanbaev {{fought in}} combat from 1941 {{and served with}} the 6th Guards Airborne Division from its formation. In the spring of 1944 he was a squad leader in the Commandant's Platoon of the division's 14th Guards Airborne Regiment. Kazanbaev fought in the Uman-Botosani Offensive. On 31 March the {{regiment}} conducted a raid in the German rear, capturing Ciocîlteni village and blocking the road. The regiment held the highway and repulsed counterattacks by superior numbers of German troops. When the situation worsened and the German troops broke through {{to the outskirts of}} the village, the regiment's chief of staff ordered Kazanbaev and his squad to save the regimental colour. He led his squad to link up with advancing Soviet troops. They were attacked by German troops and a seriously wounded Kazanbaev was the only survivor. He buried the flag in the ground. When rescued by a cavalry patrol, Kazanbaev was able to <b>tell</b> <b>an</b> officer where the flag was. He died from his wounds shortly afterwards on 1 April.

[...] Todd VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club, despite noting his original dislike for the episode, awarded it a B rating and wrote, [...] "This episode works, almost in spite of itself.

[...] However, he denied that his intention was to give a warning about technology, but rather <b>tell</b> <b>an</b> adventure story about a [...] "new way [...] to invade" [...] based on something viewers were familiar with. Producer Marus Wilson suggested that the episode be an [...] "urban thriller", as the story would already be set in contemporary London to introduce Clara and the Wi-Fi monsters. Moffat compared the style to James Bond and The Bourne Identity. Moffat said that the episode was [...] "an action roller coaster" [...] rather than a story intended to be scary.|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} half of the series, Toriyama has said that he had become more {{interested}} in coming up with the story than actually drawing it, and that the battles became more intense with him simplifying the lines. In 2013, he stated that because Dragon Ball is an action manga the most important aspect is the sense of speed, so he did not draw very elaborate, going so far as to suggest one could say that he was not interested in the art. He also once said that his goal for the series was to <b>tell</b> <b>an</b> [...] "unconventional and contradictory" [...] story. In 2013, commenting on Dragon Balls global success, Toriyama said, [...] "Frankly, I don't quite understand why it happened.

500|$|Overseas reviews were {{consistently}} positive. The Rotten Tomatoes aggregate rating is 100% [...] "Fresh", based on 7 reviews, {{with an average}} rating of 7 out of 10. Richard James Havis of The Hollywood Reporter stated, [...] "This Bollywood epic crunches together romance, comedy, extraterrestrials, martial arts, dancing and action to <b>tell</b> <b>an</b> entertaining story about a reluctant Indian superhero" [...] but said it may be [...] "far too crazed for foreign viewers". David Chute of LA Weekly deemed it a [...] "hearty pulp cinema that really sticks to your ribs". Likewise, Laura Kern of The New York Times {{said it was a}} blend of carefree romance, show-stopping action and sci-fi. Ronnie Scheib of Variety said that it was an [...] "enjoyable, daffily improbable escapist romp". He praised the action sequences as ingeniously choreographed, but very family-friendly. Though Jaspreet Pandohar of BBC was critical of the script for being [...] "low on originality", he praised Hrithik Roshan's performance and the action scenes. Dr. P.V. Vaidyanathan, in a review for BBC Shropshire, said that the film's excellent special effects were as good as the best from Hollywood, praised Hritik's acting, but called the music mundane.|$|E

Haque praised Barrymore's portrayal of Jillian in the episode, saying that she had [...] "some great comedy moments." [...] He went on to grade the episode 8 out of 10, {{and said that the}} live-action footage [...] "seemed to work somehow here, and the storyline took center stage here" [...] and that [...] "you can't argue against an attempt to <b>tell</b> <b>an</b> actual story, and for that reason, this episode's definitely worth watching." [...] Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club praised the live-action footage as well, saying that he [...] "liked the splicing in of late night hosts and their jokes about Brian and , if only to add a certain element of timeliness to the material." [...] Heisler graded the episode B-, the second highest grade of the night. He said that [...] "often Family Guy is unbearable" [...] and [...] "has established a certain style and rhythm, jokes come off as smug", but said that he found himself enjoying the episode [...] "more and more as it went on [...] because it was willing to fully embrace the silliness and ridiculousness of what it was setting up." ...|$|E
500|$|Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine {{criticized the}} music videos for {{the songs on}} B'Day Anthology Video Album, writing that [...] "none of them are {{anything}} special, though most will please narrow-minded fans". To celebrate the album's tenth year anniversary, Billboard published [...] "Beyoncé's Best Fashion Moments from Her Decade-Old 'B'Day Anthology Video Album'", the list in which Billboard editor Da'Shan Smith commented on ten best outfits Beyoncé wore in the music videos, on April 3, 2017, and stated: [...] "The project has delivered audiences some of the singer's most iconic looks. In every frame she appears in, Beyoncé oozes a radiant confidence, wearing stunning outfits and costumes to match. Here is the project's ten best looks – from House of Deréon signatures to impromptu costume designs and haute couture get ups." [...] The same day, Vibe published a list in which Smith ranked all thirteen music videos from the worst to the best; he stated: [...] "B'Day Video Anthology Album must be heralded as an important pop culture artifact. As expressed before, it's the birther of Beyoncé's passion for providing fans visual sequences they need to <b>tell</b> <b>an</b> album’s story. Imagine a B'Day without its Anthology—although the go-go and funk infused tracks already made an impression upon audio listens only, the visuals made the record pop to life." ...|$|E

500|$|The Blessing has {{provoked}} a more divided response. Waugh's judgement was {{that those who}} criticised the book were [...] "lazy brutes..... can't bear to see a writer grow up". More recently, Philip Hensher and others have [...] argued that although the novel is immensely enjoyable and that Mitford's [...] "marvellous voice" [...] is undiminished, she is on less sure ground with her [...] "Frenchness" [...] than with the English country house ambience, and her picture of France {{as the embodiment of}} everything civilised is less than convincing. Similar mixed comments greeted Mitford's final novel, Don't Tell Alfred, Waugh again hailing it as her best, [...] "clamouring for a sequel". In this judgement he was largely alone; other critics perceived in the anecdotal framework of the book an uncertainty as to what it was about. An American reviewer wondered what parts were to be taken seriously: [...] "What exactly goes on?... Can you always <b>tell</b> <b>an</b> Etonian, even when he goes beat? Is all modern architecture a fraud? Do U-people really talk this way?" [...] Similar questions were raised in the Times Literary Supplements review, in relation to Mitford's fictional output as a whole: [...] "Would she have been a better novelist if she had 'tried harder', gone in further, dropped the pose of amateurishness, cut the charm, looked beyond the worlds that she knew and, more importantly, loved?" ...|$|E
500|$|As was {{the common}} {{practice}} for Italian films at the time, shooting was done without sound; dialogue was added later along {{with music and}} sound effects. [...] As a consequence, cast members generally spoke in their native language during filming: Quinn and Basehart in English, Masina and the others in Italian. [...] Liliana Betti, Fellini's long-time assistant, has described the director's typical procedure regarding dialogue during filming, a technique he called the [...] "number system" [...] or [...] "numerological diction": [...] "Instead of lines, the actor has to count off numbers in their normal order. [...] For instance, a line of fifteen words equals an enumeration of up to thirty. [...] The actor merely counts til thirty: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7. etc." [...] Biographer John Baxter has commented on the usefulness of such a system: [...] "It helps pinpoint an instant in the speech where he [...] wants a different reaction. 'Go back to [...] "27",' he'll <b>tell</b> <b>an</b> actor, 'but this time, smile.'" [...] Since he didn't {{need to worry about}} noise while shooting a scene, Fellini would keep up a running commentary during filming, a practice that scandalized more traditional filmmakers, like Elia Kazan: [...] "He talked through each take, in fact yelled at the actors. 'No, there, stop, turn, look at her, look at her. [...] See how sad she is, see her tears? [...] Oh, the poor wretch! [...] You want to comfort her? Don't turn away; go to her. [...] Ah, she doesn't want you, does she? What? Go to her anyway!'... That's how he's able... to use performers from many countries. [...] He does part of the acting for the actors." ...|$|E

'Born This Way', {{for the first time in}} a long time, made me feel like I could say I was a fan of Glee without a million qualifiers." [...] Gary Mills of the Florida Times-Union felt that the episode didn't live up to its hype, but also said that he wasn't disappointed. Brett Berk of Vanity Fair reacted positively, and noted that by [...] "focusing on what makes these lovable dorks, well, lovable dorks—and not pop, or high-school, superstars—tonight's episode, if a bit tidily, reminded us that these are supposed to be kids". Matt Zoller Seitz of Salon thought that [...] "Born This Way" [...] was [...] "the show's best episode to date", and [...] "an epic about a hero returning from a long journey, walking serenely through halls that once scared him, and performing with such skill and sincerity that his friends stared at him with love and awe." [...] Aly Semigran of MTV had mixed emotions. She criticized the abrupt changes of the storylines in the episode, and thought that the episode [...] "was a noble effort" [...] but [...] "it didn't quite work the way it was supposed to." [...] Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal stated that the episode [...] "sounded just the perfect notes" [...] and called it [...] "the best episode yet".
