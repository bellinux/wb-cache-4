5|$|The Mark III {{telescope}} {{was the same}} size as the Mark II, but was constructed to be <b>transportable.</b> However, it was never moved, and remained at its original site in Wardle, near Nantwich, where it was used as part of MERLIN. It was built in 1966, and was decommissioned in 1996.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 (amended 2011) UK Carriage of Dangerous Goods and Use of <b>Transportable</b> Pressure Equipment Regulations (CDG Regulations) {{implement}} the European Agreement Concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR). Dangerous goods {{to be carried}} internationally in road vehicles must comply with standards for the packaging and labelling of the dangerous goods, and appropriate construction and operating standards for the vehicles and crew.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{widespread}} application of technetium-99m in nuclear medicine, the radioactive isotope thallium-201, with a half-life of 73 hours, {{was the main}} substance for nuclear cardiography. The nuclide is still used for stress tests for risk stratification in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). This isotope of thallium can be generated using a <b>transportable</b> generator {{which is similar to}} the technetium-99m generator. The generator contains lead-201 (half-life 9.33 hours) which decays by electron capture to the thallium-201. The lead-201 can be produced in a cyclotron by the bombardment of thallium with protons or deuterons by the (p,3n) and (d,4n) reactions.|$|E
5|$|The GCV {{must have}} been <b>transportable</b> by cargo aircraft, rail, and ship. The Army {{required}} it to meet the availability rates of the current Stryker. The Army did not limit the vehicle by {{the dimensions of the}} C-130 Hercules, which, in the past, constrained many designs. Air mobility would be provided by the more spacious C-17 Globemaster III. The GCV was to have good cross-country mobility, with a baseline requirement of 30mph off-road speed. The GCV should have delivered higher sustainability levels and consume less fuel than the Bradley or other vehicles of similar weight and power. The military was accepting both tracked and wheeled designs. The operational maintenance cost requirement of the GCV was up to $200 per mile, compared to $168 per mile for the M2 Bradley.|$|E
5|$|Solar {{chemical}} processes use solar energy to drive chemical reactions. These processes offset energy {{that would otherwise}} come from a fossil fuel source and can also convert solar energy into storable and <b>transportable</b> fuels. Solar induced chemical reactions {{can be divided into}} thermochemical or photochemical. A variety of fuels can be produced by artificial photosynthesis. The multielectron catalytic chemistry involved in making carbon-based fuels (such as methanol) from reduction of carbon dioxide is challenging; a feasible alternative is hydrogen production from protons, though use of water as the source of electrons (as plants do) requires mastering the multielectron oxidation of two water molecules to molecular oxygen. Some have envisaged working solar fuel plants in coastal metropolitan areas by 2050 the splitting of sea water providing hydrogen to be run through adjacent fuel-cell electric power plants and the pure water by-product going directly into the municipal water system. Another vision involves all human structures covering the earth's surface (i.e., roads, vehicles and buildings) doing photosynthesis more efficiently than plants.|$|E
5|$|The {{technological}} design advances made by Whipple and Murphy, {{in addition}} to further advances in steel and iron fabrication, made wrought iron truss bridges a major industry in the United States. The Capon Lake bridge was a Whipple–Murphy truss bridge, since it incorporated Murphy's later modifications with double-intersections and horizontal chords. At {{the time of the}} bridge's original fabrication in 1874, metal truss bridges were ordered from catalogs by county courts and other entities responsible for transportation construction and maintenance. These entities provided the desired width, length, and other specifications, and the truss materials were shipped to the construction site and assembled by local construction teams. Metal truss bridges were more economically feasible, could span longer distances, and were simpler to construct than stone bridges, and they were more durable than wooden bridges. They were also marketed as detachable and <b>transportable</b> structures that could be dismantled and reassembled. The technology used in the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge revolutionized transport throughout West Virginia. While the Whipple truss bridge had waned in popularity by the 1890s, the bridges were commonly disassembled and re-erected for use on secondary roads, {{as was the case with}} the Capon Lake Whipple Truss Bridge in 1938.|$|E

25|$|In India, {{transfer}} of nitrous oxide from bulk cylinders to smaller, more <b>transportable</b> E-type, 1590 liter-capacity tanks, is legal when {{the intended use}} of the gas is for medical anaesthesia.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} <b>transportable</b> {{replicas of the}} Vietnam Veteran's Memorial created so {{those who are not}} able to travel to Washington, D.C., would be able to {{simulate}} an experience of visiting the Wall.|$|E
25|$|One {{or more of}} the {{external}} doors may be provided with a mating flange or collar to suit a portable or <b>transportable</b> chamber, which can be used to evacuate a diver under pressure.|$|E
25|$|JLTV is <b>{{transport}}able</b> by sea, rail, and air. The JLTV will be <b>transportable</b> on {{all classes}} of ocean-going transport ships with minimal dis-assembly. It {{is required to}} be rail-transportable on CONUS and NATO country railways. Air transportability will be by fixed-wing aircraft as large as or larger than the C-130 Hercules and sling-loadable with rotary-wing aircraft such as the CH-47/MH-47, and CH-53. The ambulance variant must be air-dropable by C-5 and C-17 fixed-wing aircraft. The JLTV can be prepared in 30 minutes for transport by aircraft, Maritime Prepositioning Force ships or rail. This is aided by an adjustable-height suspension.|$|E
25|$|The {{previous}} Category B variant {{was eliminated}} because {{it proved to}} be too heavy to meet the required weight of approximately 15,639lb to make it <b>transportable</b> by Army CH-47F and Marine Corps CH-53K heavy-lift helicopters.|$|E
25|$|In JLTV's Initial Capability Document (ICD) {{there were}} four payload options, this later reduced to three, Payload Categories A, B, and C. All were to be <b>transportable</b> {{externally}} by CH-47 and CH-53 helicopters and internally by C-130 aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Located {{adjacent}} to Corporation Street in Exchange Square was the Wheel of Manchester, a <b>transportable</b> Ferris wheel installation which provided views over Manchester city centre and beyond. The first wheel {{was installed in}} 2004, the second in May 2007.|$|E
25|$|The Small, sealed, <b>transportable,</b> {{autonomous}} reactor (SSTAR) {{is being}} primarily researched and {{developed in the}} US, intended as a fast breeder reactor that is passively safe and could be remotely shut down in case the suspicion arises that it is being tampered with.|$|E
25|$|The {{transistor}} radio {{first appeared}} {{on the market in}} 1954. In particular, it made portable radios even more <b>transportable.</b> All sets quicklly became smaller, cheaper and more convenient. The aim of radio manufacturers became a radio in every room, in the car, and in the pocket.|$|E
25|$|A pint of pub beer is famously more {{expensive}} {{in the south}} of England than the north, but supermarket beer prices are very similar. This may be treated as anecdotal evidence in favour of the Balassa–Samuelson hypothesis, since supermarket beer is an easily <b>transportable,</b> traded good. (Although pub beer is <b>transportable,</b> the pub itself is not.) The BS-hypothesis explanation for the price differentials is that the 'productivity' of pub employees (in pints served per hour) is more uniform than the 'productivity' (in foreign currency earned per year) of people working in the dominant tradable sector in each region of the country (financial services {{in the south of}} England, manufacturing in the north). Although the employees of southern pubs are not significantly more productive than their counterparts in the north, the pubs must pay wages comparable to those offered by other southern firms in order to keep their staff. This results in southern pubs incurring a higher labour cost per pint served.|$|E
25|$|Propane is a three-carbon alkane, {{normally}} a gas, but compressible to a <b>transportable</b> liquid. It {{is derived from}} other petroleum products during oil or natural gas processing. It is commonly used as a fuel for engines, barbecues, portable stoves, and residential central heating. Propane was first identified as a volatile component in gasoline by Dr. Walter O. Snelling of the U.S. Bureau of Mines in 1910.|$|E
25|$|Technetium-99m was {{discovered}} {{as a product}} of cyclotron bombardment of molybdenum. This procedure produced molybdenum-99, a radionuclide with a longer half-life (2.75 days), which decays to Tc-99m. At present, molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) is used commercially as the easily <b>transportable</b> source of medically used Tc-99m. In turn, this Mo-99 is usually created commercially by fission of highly enriched uranium in aging research and material testing nuclear reactors in several countries.|$|E
25|$|Transcription is {{the process}} of copying genetic {{information}} stored in a DNA strand into a <b>transportable</b> complementary strand of RNA. Eukaryotic transcription takes place in the nucleus of the cell and proceeds in three sequential stages: initiation, elongation, and termination. The transcriptional machinery that catalyzes this complex reaction has at its core three multi-subunit RNA polymerases. RNA polymerase I is responsible for transcribing RNA that codes for genes that become structural components of the ribosome.|$|E
25|$|Hovercraft {{are still}} {{manufactured}} in the UK, near {{to where they were}} first conceived and tested, and the Isle Of Wight. They can also be chartered {{for a wide variety of}} uses including inspections of shallow bed offshore wind farms and VIP or passenger use. A typical vessel would be a Tiger IV or a Griffon. They are light, fast, road <b>transportable</b> and very adaptable with the unique feature of minimising damage to environments.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{reaching}} a refinery, the synthetic crude is processed {{and a significant}} portion of the upgrading agent will be removed during the refining process. It may be used for other fuel fractions, but the end result is that liquid fuel has to be piped to the upgrading facility simply to make the bitumen <b>transportable</b> by pipeline. If all costs are considered, synthetic crude production and transfer using bitumen and an upgrading agent may prove economically unsustainable.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} form of loom is a horizontal; {{one that}} can be staked to the ground or supported by sidepieces on the ground. The necessary tension can be obtained through the use of wedges. This style of loom is ideal for nomadic people as it can be assembled or dismantled and is easily <b>transportable.</b> Rugs produced on horizontal looms are generally fairly small and the weave quality is inferior to those rugs made on a professional standing loom.|$|E
25|$|The Ultra-light {{had been}} {{conceived}} of as a straightforward, low cost and easily <b>transportable</b> helicopter. It lacked any tail rotor due to the decision to propel the rotorcraft using unconventional tip jets positioned {{at the ends of}} the rotor blades. It had been selected amongst various competing projects to meet a Ministry of Supply requirement for a lightweight helicopter to be used by the British Army for aerial observation purposes. Early trials with prototypes proved promising, however political factors ultimately undermined the project.|$|E
25|$|The {{same year}} Eiffel started {{work on a}} system of {{standardised}} prefabricated bridges, an idea that {{was the result of}} a conversation with the governor of Cochin-China. These used a small number of standard components, all small enough to be readily <b>transportable</b> in areas with poor or non-existent roads, and were joined together using bolts rather than rivets, reducing the need for skilled labour on site. A number of different types were produced, ranging from footbridges to standard-gauge railway bridges.|$|E
25|$|The BCC SRTV-22 (Osprey) variant has an {{internal}} crew of three with options for two additional crew or two (roll protected) patients, but loses either one crew member or patient as required. The variant {{is designed to}} quickly load and unload from the V-22 with no major adjustments other than collapsing the roll protection. Additionally, it is less than 900lbs per wheel, making it ideal for use as an Internally <b>Transportable</b> Vehicle (ITV) and can be ordered with the V-22 trailer.|$|E
25|$|The first North American {{occurrence}} of P. dominula {{was reported in}} Massachusetts in the late 1970s, and by 1995, this species had been documented throughout the northeastern USA. However, the species is also likely present in additional states, but has just not yet been reported. Although detailed mechanisms of the species' dispersal are still unknown, some number of individuals, including the foundresses, may have hidden inside <b>transportable</b> items such as shipping crates, trailers, boats, or other human-made structures used during international trading between countries.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the advent}} of the 7-8th century CE, Japan used {{commodity}} money for its exchanges. It generally consisted of material that was compact, easily <b>transportable</b> and had a widely recognized value. Commodity money was a great improvement over simple barter, in which commodities were simply exchanged against others. Ideally, commodity money had to be widely accepted, easily portable and storable, and easily combined and divided in order to correspond to different values. The main items of commodity money in Japan were arrowheads, rice grains and gold powder.|$|E
25|$|The Geiger counter was the {{original}} radiation detector, recording the total count rate from all energy levels of radiation. Ionization chambers and Geiger counters were first adapted for field use in the 1930s. The first <b>transportable</b> Geiger–Müller counter (weighing 25kg) was constructed at the University of British Columbia in 1932. H.V. Ellsworth of the GSC built a lighter weight, more practical unit in 1934. Subsequent models were the principal instruments used for uranium prospecting for many years, until geiger counters were replaced by scintillation counters.|$|E
25|$|The BMP-3 has a {{range of}} 600km, an {{altitude}} of operation of up to 3,000m and it is <b>transportable</b> by train, truck, sea, and air. The BMP-3 engine is a diesel four-stroke, liquid-cooled design. The transmission is a four-speed hydromechanical power unit, with power takeoff to its water jets. The suspension is independent, with a torsion bar and six hydraulic shock absorbers. Steering is by gear differential with hydrostatic drive. The track adjusting mechanism is remotely controlled from the driver's station, with tension force indication. The water-jet propulsion unit is single-stage, axial, auger-type.|$|E
25|$|The Ground Mobility Vehicle (GMV) {{formerly}} known as the Ultra Light Combat Vehicle (ULCV), is a U.S. Army proposed air-droppable light off-road vehicle to improve the mobility of light infantry brigades. In March 2015, the Army changed the name of the ULCV to the Ground Mobility Vehicle. GMV is intended to be carried internally in a CH-47 Chinook or externally by a UH-60 Black Hawk. In order to be survivable but <b>transportable,</b> the GMV would be lightly armored and use speed, maneuverability, and off-road mobility to avoid major threats.|$|E
25|$|Objects {{considered}} for inclusion on the NRHP, whether individually or {{as part of}} districts, should be designed for a specific location; objects such as <b>transportable</b> sculpture, furniture, and other decorative arts that lack a specific place are discouraged. Fixed outdoor sculpture, an example of public art, is appropriate for inclusion on the Register. The setting of an object is important in relation to the Register. It should be appropriate to its significant historical use, roles, or character. In addition, objects that have been relocated to museums are not {{considered for}} inclusion on the Register.|$|E
25|$|Marchetti’s team {{then went}} on to convert this into the AN/TPS-3, a light-weight, <b>transportable</b> system and the last major radar fully {{developed}} by the SCL. The set could be assembled and placed into operation by a small crew in 30 minutes. During the war, the AN/TPS-3 was used for early warning at beachheads, isolated areas, and captured air bases. A version, AN/TQS-3, was developed for locating motars. Zenith manufactured about 900 total of both versions. After the war, Marchetti became the first director of the Air Force Cambridge Research Center in Massachusetts.|$|E
25|$|The THAAD missile is {{manufactured}} at a Lockheed Martin facility near Troy, Alabama. The facility performs final integration, {{assembly and}} testing of the THAAD missile. The THAAD Radar is an X Band {{active electronically scanned array}} Radar developed and built by Raytheon at its Andover, Massachusetts Integrated Air Defense Facility. The THAAD radar and a variant developed as a forward sensor for ICBM missile defense, the Forward-Based X-Band – <b>Transportable</b> (FBX-T) radar, were assigned a common designator, AN/TPY-2, in late 2006/ early 2007. The THAAD radar can interoperate with Aegis and Patriot systems, in a 3-layer antimissile defense.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 1950s, the British Army was {{considerable}} {{interested in the}} potential use of compact helicopters in the observation and aerial observation roles. In 1953, there was a requirement issued by the British Ministry of Supply which sought for a low-cost two-seat helicopter, which would be suitable for reconnaissance, casualty evacuation and training duties. This specification {{was considered to be}} quite demanding, calling for it to be capable of high speeds and quick climb rates even under tropical conditions. The rotorcraft was also required to be <b>transportable</b> {{on the back of a}} standard Army three-ton truck, constricting the dimensions of the prospective vehicle considerably.|$|E
25|$|When the Pompeians {{began their}} {{breakout}} attempt, heavy and brutal fighting ensued, with the escaping defenders suffering heavy casualties. Several Pompeians, {{many of them}} Lusitanians, actually managed to escape, but not Gnaeus Pompeius himself. Unable to walk due to his wounds and not <b>transportable</b> by horse or litter because of the local terrains' inaccessibility, he could not flee quick enough and together with several of his followers remained behind. With many Pompeians either gone or killed, the Caesarians then launched a renewed assault against the Pompeian position and overran the remaining defenders. Gnaeus Pompeius fled into a cave, but was discovered after some captives betrayed his hiding place, and, despite his wounds, fought to the death.|$|E
