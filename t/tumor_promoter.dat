40|$|In the {{two-stage}} {{model of}} skin carcinogenesis, {{it is believed}} that initiators bind to DNA and that <b>tumor</b> <b>promoters</b> such as phorbol 12 -tetradecanoate 13 -acetate (TPA) bind noncovalently to membrane-associated high-affinity receptors, probably protein kinase C. Two other types of potent tumor-promoting substances, aplysiatoxin and teleocidin, appear to act also by binding to and activating protein kinase C, even though their chemical structures are quite different. Therefore, we have undertaken computer modeling of the special relationship of various functional groups in these three chemical classes of <b>tumor</b> <b>promoters</b> in an attempt to explain how these diverse structures bind to the same receptor molecule. We propose a stereochemical model in which the oxygens in TPA at C- 3, C- 4, C- 9, and C- 20 (O- 3, O- 4, O- 9, and O- 20) correspond to the O- 11, N- 13, N- 1, and O- 24 positions in teleocidin and the O- 27, O- 3, O- 11, and O- 30 oxygens in aplysiatoxin, respectively. In this model all distances with respect to overlap of the corresponding atoms are less than 1 A. In addition, all three types of molecules have their hydrophobic moieties oriented in a similar position. This model is further discussed with respect to other compounds showing various degrees of activity as <b>tumor</b> <b>promoters,</b> including mezerein, ingenol, and 4 alpha-TPA.

Non-tumor-promoting analogs (beta-phorbol, alpha-phorbol 12, 13 -didecanoate, and hydrolyzed teleocidin) {{had no effect on}} the levels of receptor phosphorylation. The ED 50 values of the inhibitory effect (0. 1 - 3 ng/ml) reflected the relative tumor-promoting abilities of these compounds in vivo.

Scatchard analysis, however, revealed two apparent EGF receptors in this cell type.
