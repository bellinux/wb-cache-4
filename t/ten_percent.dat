President Lincoln had authorized loyalist governments in Virginia, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Tennessee as the Union came to control large parts of those states and advocated a <b>ten</b> <b>percent</b> plan that would allow elections after <b>ten</b> <b>percent</b> of the voters in any state took an oath of future loyalty to the Union. Congress considered this too lenient; its own plan, requiring a majority of voters to take the loyalty oath, passed both houses in 1864, but Lincoln pocket vetoed it.|$|E
5|$|By 2014, the Bay Area's wealth gap was considerable: the top <b>ten</b> <b>percent</b> of income-earners {{took home}} over eleven {{times as much}} as the bottom <b>ten</b> <b>percent,</b> and a Brookings Institution study found the San Francisco metro area, which {{excludes}} four Bay Area counties, to be the third most unequal urban area in the country. Among the wealthy, there are forty-seven Bay Area residents made the Forbes magazine's 400 richest Americans list, published in 2007. Thirteen lived in San Francisco proper, placing it seventh among cities in the world. Among the forty-seven were several well-known names such as Steve Jobs, George Lucas, and Charles Schwab. The wealthiest resident was Larry Ellison of Oracle, worth $25 billion. A study by Capgemini indicates that in 2009, 4.5 percent of all households within the San Francisco-Oakland and San Jose metropolitan areas held $1 million in investable assets, placing the region first in the United States, just ahead of the New York City metro region. On the other hand, low income residents in the Bay Area saw their incomes fall by nine percent since 2007, with the bottom <b>ten</b> <b>percent</b> earning just $20,000 on average.|$|E
