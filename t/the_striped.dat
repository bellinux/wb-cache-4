5|$|Because of {{its wide}} {{distribution}} and stable numbers, the population status of <b>the</b> <b>striped</b> honeyeater has been {{evaluated by the}} IUCN as being of least concern.|$|E
5|$|The nests of <b>the</b> <b>striped</b> honeyeater are parasitized by the pallid cuckoo (Cacomantis pallidus).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>striped</b> honeyeater {{was first}} {{described}} by English ornithologist and bird artist, John Gould, in A Synopsis of the Birds of Australia and the Adjacent Islands, published in 1838. It {{is a member}} of the family Meliphagidae, the honeyeaters, and the sole member of the monotypic genus Plectorhyncha. Molecular studies indicate that genus is closely allied to the monotypic genus Grantiella, though dissimilar in appearance. The painted honeyeater (Grantiella picta) and <b>the</b> <b>striped</b> honeyeater are part of a subclade that includes also Philemon and Xanthotis.|$|E
5000|$|In {{most cases}} <b>the</b> <b>stripes</b> were painted {{on by the}} ground crews; {{with only a few}} hours' notice, few of <b>the</b> <b>stripes</b> were [...] "masked". As a result, {{depending}} on the abilities of the [...] "erks" [...] (RAF nickname for ground crew), <b>the</b> <b>stripes</b> were often far from neat and tidy.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>stripes</b> are {{embroidered}} with {{a pattern of}} alternating four- and five-petaled blossoms on <b>the</b> blue <b>stripes</b> and leafy vines on <b>the</b> mustard <b>stripes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Recent {{efforts have}} {{attempted}} to observe <b>the</b> <b>stripe</b> phase in a Rubidium-87 BEC, however <b>the</b> <b>stripes</b> were too small and too low contrast to be detected.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>striped</b> honeyeater's song is {{described}} as a chirp, chirp, cherry, cherry, its contact call as a sharp chewee and its alarm call as a shrill whistling note.|$|E
5|$|Farmiga won a Los Angeles Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress and was {{nominated}} for an Independent Spirit Award for Best Female Lead {{for her role in}} Down to the Bone (2004).

5|$|Ruffs of {{both sexes}} have an {{additional}} moult stage between the winter and final summer plumages, a phenomenon also seen in the bar-tailed godwit. Before developing the full display finery with coloured ruff and tufts, the males replace part of their winter plumage with striped feathers. Females also develop a mix of winter and striped feathers before reaching their summer appearance. The final male breeding plumage results from the replacement of both winter and striped feathers, but the female retains <b>the</b> <b>striped</b> feathers and replaces only the winter feathers to reach her summer plumage. <b>The</b> <b>striped</b> prenuptial plumages may represent the original breeding appearance of this species, the male's showy nuptial feathers evolving later under strong sexual selection pressures.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>stripe</b> phases {{found in}} {{correlated}} oxides {{can be viewed}} as an ordering of the solitons associated with doping the Mott-insulating state. Inspired by the recent observation that <b>the</b> <b>stripes</b> tilt away from the main axis of the crystal lattice in the regime x = 1 / 8, we propose that a new type of stripe phase is realized in the large doping regime. This new phase should be viewed as a doped version of the microscopically insulating x = 1 / 8 <b>stripes.</b> <b>The</b> topological excitations associated with the extra doping are fractionally charged kinks along <b>the</b> <b>stripes</b> whose motions make <b>the</b> <b>stripe</b> fluctuate. We argue that the directional degree of freedom of the kinks might order, causing <b>the</b> <b>stripe</b> phase to tilt. Quantitative predictions follow for the doping dependence of the tilt angle, which in turn can be used to determine the fundamental charge quantum associated with <b>the</b> <b>stripe</b> phase.

50|$|Asiatic striped {{squirrels}} can {{be identified}} by the differences in <b>the</b> <b>stripe</b> pattern. For example, in some species, <b>the</b> <b>stripe</b> of <b>the</b> cheek interrups in the shoulder region and does not continue to <b>the</b> outermost pale <b>stripe.</b>|$|R
40|$|Effect of {{periodic}} potential on <b>the</b> <b>stripe</b> phase {{realized in}} the higher Landau levels is investigated by the Hartree-Fock approximation. The period of the potential is chosen to be two to six times of the fundamental period of <b>the</b> <b>stripe</b> phase. It is found that <b>the</b> <b>stripe</b> aligns perpendicularly to the external potential {{in contrast to a}} naive expectation and hydrodynamic theory. Charge modulation towards the Wigner crystallization along <b>the</b> <b>stripe</b> is essential for the present unexpected new result.

5|$|While <b>the</b> <b>striped</b> honeyeater aggressively defends its nest by dive-bombing {{people and}} animals who come too close, {{and has been}} {{observed}} singing from display perches, {{it is not known}} to be territorial. It often feeds near other species of honeyeater and no inter-species aggression has been noted.|$|E
5|$|Although a honeyeater in origin, <b>the</b> <b>striped</b> honeyeater's {{food source}} is {{primarily}} insects, and its diet includes seeds and fruits {{as well as}} nectar. Its bill has evolved to a short, straight, sharply pointed shape more suited to probing crevices for insects, than to probing flower tubes. It has the honeyeater’s brush tongue and takes nectar from shallow flowers such as eucalypt blossoms.|$|E
5|$|Although a honeyeater, <b>the</b> <b>striped</b> honeyeater {{relies on}} insects as its major food source, and its bill has been adapted to an insect diet. When not {{breeding}} {{it has been}} recorded feeding and travelling in small groups, but it nests singly, laying around three eggs in a deep cup-shaped nest suspended {{from the end of}} drooping branches. It is widely distributed and common within its range, thus the population is listed as being of least concern for conservation by the IUCN.|$|E

50|$|Away: The away strip saw {{a return}} to <b>the</b> red-and-black <b>stripes,</b> <b>the</b> {{traditional}} Manchester City away colours that were famously introduced by the club's former co-manager Malcolm Allison in the 1960s. The most notable element of the strip was the position of <b>the</b> <b>stripes</b> on <b>the</b> arms, which was designed so that if a player scored and held his arms out horizontally whilst celebrating, <b>the</b> <b>stripes</b> would match up with <b>the</b> <b>stripes</b> on <b>the</b> body. The kit was embellished with gold applications and completed with black shorts and socks.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>stripes</b> {{may serve}} as visual cues and identification. Although <b>the</b> <b>striping</b> pattern is unique to each individual, {{it is not known}} whether zebras can {{recognize}} one another by their stripes.|$|R
5|$|Bosman and Kolben's {{descriptions}} went largely unnoticed until 1771, {{when the}} Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant, in his Synopsis of Quadrupeds, used the descriptions, {{as well as}} his personal experience with a captive specimen, as a basis for consistently differentiating the spotted hyena from <b>the</b> <b>striped.</b> The description given by Pennant was precise enough to be included by Johann Erxleben in his Systema regni animalis by simply translating Pennant's text into Latin. Crocuta was finally recognised as a separate genus from Hyaena in 1828.|$|E
5|$|For years, Europeans in Africa {{had heard}} of an animal that they came to call the 'African unicorn'. In his travelogue of {{exploring}} the Congo, Henry Morton Stanley mentioned a kind of donkey that the natives called the atti, which scholars later identified as the okapi. Explorers may have seen the fleeting view of <b>the</b> <b>striped</b> backside as the animal fled through the bushes, leading to speculation that the okapi {{was some sort of}} rainforest zebra.|$|E
5|$|It is arboreal, mostly feeding {{amongst the}} foliage in {{the canopy of}} trees. Most food is {{obtained}} from the leaves, and less often from the bark or flowers and fruit. The major foraging methods are gleaning from leaves and dead branches, probing under loose bark and in crevices, probing woody fruits of Black Oak, probing flowers of Yorrell (Eucalyptus gracilis) and sallying for insects. <b>The</b> <b>striped</b> honeyeater occasionally hangs upside-down to extract insects.|$|E
40|$|Strain {{relaxation}} in patterned Si 0. 77 Ge 0. 23 stripes {{grown on}} Si(001) by {{chemical vapour deposition}} was investigated after He+ ion implantation and annealing. Ion channeling measurements indicate asymmetric strain relaxation with a significantly higher residual strain parallel to <b>the</b> <b>stripes</b> than perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>stripes.</b> These results are confirmed by plan view transmission electron microscopy showing a much higher density of misfit dislocations running along <b>the</b> <b>stripes</b> than across <b>the</b> <b>stripes.</b> Estimates based on a piezoresistivity model indicate significant enhancements of electron and hole mobilities for asymmetrically strained Si cap layers on such SiGe stripes.

50|$|Marine {{tradition}} {{maintains that}} <b>the</b> red <b>stripe</b> is worn on the trousers of the Blue Dress uniform, {{commonly known as}} <b>the</b> blood <b>stripe,</b> {{because all of the}} Marine NCOs and officers of the detachment died while storming the castle of Chapultepec in 1847, though iterations of <b>the</b> <b>stripe</b> predate <b>the</b> war. In 1849, <b>the</b> <b>stripes</b> were changed to a solid red from dark blue stripes edged in red, which dated from 1839.|$|R
40|$|Many digital {{elevation}} models (DEM) {{produced by the}} U. S. Geological Survey suffer from <b>the</b> presence of <b>striping</b> artifacts, which limit their utility. The most common approaches to filtering the affected DEMs rely on simple low-pass filters that blur fine details. A new filtering algorithm has been developed that isolates <b>the</b> <b>stripes</b> by applying a low-pass filter along the axis of <b>the</b> <b>striping,</b> followed by high-pass filtering orthogonal to <b>the</b> <b>stripes.</b> Once isolated, <b>the</b> artifacts are subtracted from the DEM to yield clean, detailed terrain data...|$|R
5|$|The {{breeding}} season is from August to January, though dependent on local conditions. The nest site is {{usually in the}} drooping foliage of a tall shrub or low tree, such as Casuarina, Melaleuca, Acacia, and mallee eucalypts. The site is sometimes near to or overhanging water, and the nest is usually constructed {{at the end of}} a drooping branch, suspended from twigs or foliage. <b>The</b> <b>striped</b> honeyeater often nests in the vicinity of a nesting butcherbird. It builds a deep cup-shaped or bag-shaped nest, with thick walls and the lip of the opening turned slightly inwards. The nest is made from thin dry grass and coated with plant down, feathers or wool, the coating often completely obscuring the grass framework. It is lined with spider webs, hair, wool or rootlets, and on occasion flowers and tissue paper. <b>The</b> <b>striped</b> honeyeater will commonly re-use material from previous nests.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>striped</b> honeyeater breeds {{throughout}} its distribution range, usually as simple pairs, with both sexes building the nest, incubating and feeding the young. However cooperative breeding has been observed, {{with a third}} adult bird involved in feeding nestlings. It nests solitarily, and pairs use the same or adjoining trees for nesting over two or more seasons.|$|E
5|$|Dyspanopeus sayi lives {{predominantly}} on muddy bottoms, {{where it}} is a predator of bivalve molluscs. In its native environment, it hides among colonies of polychaetes to avoid being preyed on by the Atlantic blue crab, Callinectes sapidus. It is an important predator of the quahog, Mercenaria mercenaria, in Narragansett Bay, and of the barnacle Balanus improvisus in Delaware Bay. In the Adriatic Sea, {{it has been observed}} to feed on <b>the</b> <b>striped</b> venus clam, Chamelea gallina, and the introduced Asian date mussel, Musculista senhousia.|$|E
40|$|This practice-based {{research}} works through contemporary jewellery as its mode of practice. It investigates new contemporary jewellery {{by examining}} <b>the</b> <b>stripe</b> motif as a metonym occurring in selected paintings from fourteenth to fifteenth century Italy and the Netherlands, and interpreting the source material in new ways. The specific {{selection of the}} motif is <b>the</b> <b>stripe</b> acting as a metonym. The research investigates the potential of <b>the</b> <b>stripe</b> motif {{to speak of a}} specific condition, or attribute, or characteristic or occurrence in the source material. It enquires into how these occurrences in the selected sources can be translated into another material form, which is the jewellery object. This translation involves an interpretive process. The use of <b>the</b> <b>stripe</b> motif as a metonym affecting the cultural context of the composition implies a system of signification. <b>The</b> <b>stripe</b> motif may be identified as a mark selected by the painter to draw attention to a compositional area in the painting. As an iconographic occurrence <b>the</b> <b>stripe</b> has <b>the</b> potential to convey a particular meaning or embodiment of an idea as a fulcrum for that painting. Thus <b>the</b> <b>stripe</b> embodies different purposes within the image. In its iconographic characteristics lies its metonymic purpose for an iconological implication. This informs the practice-led research of jewellery making through an interpretive and translational process...|$|R

5|$|Finally, {{other species}} are {{encountered}} only accidentally, or so rarely in Canadian territory {{that it is}} impossible to tell whether they are permanent resident. Most of these species are cetaceans, some generally poorly known: Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus), the dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (Kogia sima and K. breviceps), Blainville's and True's beaked whale (Mesoplodon densirostris and M. mirus), the false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens), and <b>the</b> <b>striped</b> dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba). The big free-tailed and evening bats (respectively Nyctinomops macrotis and Nycticeius humeralis), as well as the New England cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis) are found mostly in areas south of the U.S.-Canada frontier, and occasionally in Canada.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the best}} {{explanation}} for <b>the</b> <b>stripes</b> {{is that they}} serve a social function. Individual zebras can apparently recognise each other by their <b>striping</b> patterns. <b>The</b> <b>stripes</b> may also serve as visual cues for grooming. In addition, they could serve to help zebra groups stay together when they are fleeing. A 2012 study suggests that stripes may have developed to discourage biting flies. Experiments have demonstrated that <b>the</b> <b>stripes</b> polarize light {{in such a way}} that it discourages tabanids (biting flies) in a manner not shown with other coat patterns. Another study from 2015 determined that environment temperature is a strong predictor for zebra striping patterns and proposed that <b>the</b> <b>stripes</b> may be related to thermoregulation.|$|R
40|$|Restricted Access. We {{report the}} {{discovery}} of a periodic stripe pattern consisting of alternate domains of uniaxial and biaxial smectic-A phases when a binary mixture made of rod-like and bent-core molecules is taken between rubbed glass plates. The same mixture usually exhibits only the biaxial smectic-A phase with a uniform concentration when the plates are not rubbed. The apolar director nb corresponding to the bow axes of the bent-core molecules aligns along the rubbing direction in <b>the</b> <b>stripes</b> with <b>the</b> wave vector of the pattern making a finite angle ω 0 with nb. <b>The</b> novel <b>stripe</b> pattern is extremely soft, as evidenced by the occurrence of isolated lattice disclinations, whose nature is dictated by ω 0. We argue that <b>the</b> <b>stripes</b> owe their origin to the underlying spatial modulation of surface charges generated on the glass plates by the rubbing action. Though <b>the</b> <b>stripe</b> structure is surface-induced <b>the</b> <b>stripe</b> spacing decreases with increase of sample thickness. Our calculations indicate that the novel origin also leads to the counter intuitive dependence of <b>the</b> <b>stripe</b> spacing on sample thickness...|$|R
40|$|Results from Brillouin light {{scattering}} experiments on guided spin waves propagating along metallic magnetic stripes are presented and analyzed. The spin waves propagate along <b>the</b> <b>stripe</b> axis and form mode families due to geometrical confinement in <b>the</b> <b>stripe</b> geometry. In consequence, the allowed wave vectors are quantized in the transverse directions by stripe width and height. We show that each standing spin-wave resonance across <b>the</b> <b>stripe</b> width {{is associated with}} a particular guided mode. In <b>the</b> case of <b>stripes</b> magnetized along their length, the group velocity of the guided modes is negative and all modes have a volume character. When <b>the</b> <b>stripes</b> are magnetized along their width, the modes are characterized by a positive group velocity, and the spectrum consists of a series of volume and localized modes...|$|R
