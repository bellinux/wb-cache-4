40|$|Switched Reluctance Machines (SRMs) {{applied in}} compact {{adjustable}} speed drives are receiving {{during the last}} two decades considerable attention from industry since they are characterised by rigid construction, high operation reliability, high efficiency, high torque to inertia ratio and finally low manufacturing costs. The successful realization of a SRM drive demands inter alia of the determina-tion of the best motor construction {{from the point of view}} of the requirements of considered drive. Design examples of two industrial SRMs made by factories are presented in this paper. These are pro-totypes of a high-speed 6 / 4 -motor for an electric spindle drive for <b>textile</b> <b>spinning</b> <b>machines</b> and an 8 / 6 -motor desired as a short-time actuator in an automatic truck gear. Laboratory tests were made for all SRM’s constructions. The comparison of both analytical calculation and experimental results are made. All SRM prototypes fulfil the high demands of their explicit industrial application. 1...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{strength}} parameters of cotton yarns formed on the Rieter R 1 <b>spinning</b> <b>machine</b> {{and on the}} Textima ring <b>spinning</b> <b>machine</b> were analysed. For the rotor <b>spinning</b> <b>machine,</b> the influence of linear density of the feeding sliver and of yarns on their specific strength, elongation and elasticity was evaluated. For the rotor <b>spinning</b> <b>machine,</b> the following parameters were used: ■ rotational speed of the rotor- 100, 000 r/min (1666. 7 r/s) ■ rotational speed of the opening roller- 7, 000 r/min (116. 7 r/s) ■ linear density of yarns: 18, 20, 25, 30 tex. The <b>spinning</b> <b>machine</b> was fed with slivers after the second passage of drawing with the linear densi-ties: 3. 5, 4. 0, 4. 5, 5. 0 ktex. On the ring <b>spinning</b> <b>machine,</b> yarns of linear densities of 25 and 40 tex were formed from the roving 400 tex. Analysis of the results for rotor-spun and ring-spun yarns showed that rotor-spun yarns are characterised by higher elasticity, which makes them a very good material for knitting purposes. Key words: rotor spinning, rotor spun yarn, yarn quality parameters, tenacity elongation, elasticity. Figure 1. Dependence of yarn breaking force o...|$|R

40|$|In a <b>textile</b> mill the <b>spinning</b> <b>machine's</b> {{ring frame}} {{comprises}} of a ring and a traveller. The yarn is twisted {{with the help}} of a traveller and is winded on the bobbin with the dual support of a ring and the traveller. The traveller is dragged along behind by the spindle even though it doesn’t have a drive on its own. During winding the centrifugal force generates high contact pressure between the ring and the traveller. This pressure results in the internal surface degradation of the ring which further affects its working life. The main aim of this study was to augment the working life of the ring in order to depreciate the idle time required to restore the rings on the spindle repeatedly during spinning. The objective was accomplished by the means of thermal spray coatings, where the effect of the coatings on the ambit of the wear and wear characteristics of the rings were inspected. In this study the plasma sprayed coatings, namely Cr 3 C 2 NiCr was analyzed on E 52100 of the ring. ATSMG 99 standards were used for performing wear tests on Pin-on-Disc for both the uncoated and coated samples of E 52100. The wear behavior of the coated as well as uncoated bearing alloy steel is interpreted with the result of wear data generated. The result exhibit that Cr 3 C 2 NiCr has been profitably deposited on E 52100 grade of bearing alloy steel by plasma spray process. In comparison to bare E 52100 the coated E 52100 have shown considerably less wear loss. The accruing volume loss for plasma sprayed coatings increases with the increase in load. The Cr 3...|$|R
