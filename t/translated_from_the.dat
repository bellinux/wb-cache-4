5|$|Transcription is {{the process}} where {{information}} in DNA, called the genetic code, is used to produce RNA copies called messenger RNA (mRNA). These migrate through the cell and carry the code to ribosomes where {{it is used to}} make proteins. This is called translation because the protein's amino acid structure is determined by the mRNA's code. Information is hence <b>translated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> language of nucleic acids to the language of amino acids.|$|E

50|$|The form Johanan, {{even closer}} to the Hebrew {{original}} than Latin Johannes, is customarily used in English-language translations of the Hebrew Bible (as opposed to John being used in English translations of the New Testament), in a tradition going back to Wycliffe's Bible, which uses Ioon when <b>translating</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Greek (e.g. of John the Baptist in Mark 1:4), but Johannan when <b>translating</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Hebrew (as in Jeremiah 40:8).|$|R

5|$|Æthelhard was <b>translated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> see of Winchester to the see of Canterbury in 792 and was enthroned as {{archbishop}} on 21 July 793. Æthelhard owed {{his appointment}} to King Offa of Mercia, and the enthronement was {{presided over by}} the then-senior bishop of the land: Hygberht, the Archbishop of Lichfield. King Offa consulted Alcuin of York over proper procedure, as the archbishopric of Lichfield was a new creation.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{composed}} Meine Seel erhebt den Herren for the Feast of the Visitation (2July), which commemorates Mary's {{visit to}} Elizabeth as narrated in the Gospel of Luke, 1st chapter, verses 39 to 56. In that narrative {{the words of}} the Magnificat, , are spoken by Mary. Traditionally, Luther's translation of the biblical text is sung to a German variant of the tonus peregrinus or ninth psalm tone, concluding with a doxology, <b>translated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Gloria Patri, on the same tune. Bach based his BWV10 cantata on Luther's German Magnificat and its traditional setting, working text and melody into the composition as he had done with Lutheran hymns in other chorale cantatas.|$|E
5|$|In the 2nd century, Galen of Pergamum, an anatomist, clinician, {{writer and}} philosopher, wrote the final and highly {{influential}} anatomy treatise of ancient times. He compiled existing knowledge and studied anatomy through dissection of animals. He {{was one of}} the first experimental physiologists through his vivisection experiments on animals. Galen's drawings, based mostly on dog anatomy, became effectively the only anatomical textbook for the next thousand years. His work was known to Renaissance doctors only through Islamic Golden Age medicine until it was <b>translated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Greek some time in the 15th century.|$|E

The second volume, a compilation of all his previously published works, was released in July 2012. The remaining 1,000 pages of materials produced by Rabearivelo have been published in digital format. The first complete English translation of his masterpiece <b>Translated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Night was published by Lascaux Editions in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin was <b>translated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> see of Worcester to the see of Canterbury in December 1184, after Henry II let it {{be known}} that he would accept only Baldwin at Canterbury; the {{previous}} incumbent, Richard of Dover, had died in April that year. The monks put forward three candidates from within Christ Church Priory: Odo, who had been prior of Christ Church and was then Abbot of Battle Abbey, Peter de Leia, a Cluniac prior of Wenlock Priory and later Bishop of St David's, and Theobald, Abbot of Cluny, but none of them found favour with the English bishops. Instead, the prelates selected the king's choice, Baldwin. The selection of Baldwin took place only after a dispute between the members of the cathedral chapter of Canterbury and the suffragan bishops of Canterbury, both of whom claimed the right to elect the new archbishop.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1852, McClellan {{published}} a manual on bayonet tactics that he had <b>translated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> original French. He also received an assignment to the Department of Texas, with orders to perform a survey of Texas rivers and harbors. In 1853 he participated in the Pacific Railroad surveys, ordered by Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, to select an appropriate route for the planned transcontinental railroad. McClellan surveyed the western portion of the northern corridor along the 47th and 49th parallels from St. Paul to the Puget Sound. In so doing he demonstrated a tendency for insubordination toward senior political figures. Isaac Stevens, governor of the Washington Territory, became dissatisfied with McClellan's performance in scouting passes across the Cascade Range. McClellan selected Yakima Pass without a thorough reconnaissance and refused the governor's order to lead a party through it in winter conditions, relying on faulty intelligence about the depth of snow pack in that area. In so doing, he missed three greatly superior passes in the near vicinity, {{which would be the}} ones eventually used for railroads and interstate highways. The governor ordered McClellan to turn over his expedition logbooks, but McClellan steadfastly refused, most likely because of embarrassing personal comments that he had made throughout.|$|E

5|$|Wulfhelm was <b>translated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Bishopric of Wells to be Archbishop of Canterbury {{in about}} 926. While {{he was a}}rchbishop, he was a {{frequent}} attendee of the royal court, and King Æthelstan of England says in his law code that Wulfhelm was consulted on the drafting of the laws. Wulfhelm also advised the king on the Ordinance on Charities issued by Æthelstan. One of the surviving manuscripts of Æthelstan's laws has an epilogue that stated that the law was declared and decided at a synod held at Grately where Wulfhelm was present. From {{other parts of the}} laws issued by the king, it appears that Wulfhelm also presided at a council held at Thunderfield, at which the reeves of London pledged to keep the king's peace. The implication of the various accounts of the laws of Æthelstan is that Wulfhelm was highly involved in royal efforts to improve the law code.|$|E
