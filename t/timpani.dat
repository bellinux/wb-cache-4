5|$|The cantata is scored festively {{for three}} vocal soloists (soprano (S), tenor (T), and bass (B)), a four-part choir, and a Baroque {{instrumental}} ensemble of three corni da caccia (Co), <b>timpani</b> (Ti, listed with the winds), bassoon (Fg), two violins (Vl), viola (Va) and basso continuo. It {{is the only}} Bach cantata to combine three corni da caccia with <b>timpani.</b>|$|E
5|$|The University of Massachusetts Amherst Minuteman Marching Band {{covered the}} song {{live in a}} version {{featuring}} xylophones, chimes, snare drums, cymbals, bass drum and <b>timpani.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{orchestra}} for The Fairy-Queen {{consists of}} two recorders, two oboes, two trumpets, <b>timpani,</b> string instruments and harpsichord continuo.|$|E
5|$|The work is scored for solo {{violin and}} a {{standard}} orchestra of its period, consisting of two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, <b>timpani,</b> and strings.|$|E
5|$|In 1867 Rossini orchestrated his {{mass for}} {{instrumental}} forces much larger: three flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, three bassoons, four horns, four trumpets, three trombones, ophicleide, two cornets, <b>timpani,</b> two harps, organ and strings.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} table of the movements, the scoring follows the Neue Bach-Ausgabe, and the abbreviations for voices and instruments the list of Bach cantatas. The time signature is provided using the symbol for common time (4/4). The <b>timpani</b> are listed with the trumpets because they always play together.|$|E
5|$|The cantata {{has seven}} movements, and is scored festively with four vocal parts and a Baroque {{orchestra}} of three trumpets, <b>timpani,</b> three oboes, bassoon, strings and continuo. Bach derived {{the music of}} the opening chorus from his Hunting Cantata, composed already in 1713.|$|E
5|$|The cantata is {{structured}} in nine movements, {{three of them}} choral (1, 7, 9), the others alternating arias and recitatives. The orchestra is large and representative, with four trumpets, <b>timpani,</b> two recorders and three oboes, in addition to strings and basso continuo. Bach led the Thomanerchor in the first performance.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in nine movements with choral {{movements as}} a frame and in movement 7, otherwise alternating recitatives and arias. He scored it for four vocal soloists (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir, and an orchestra of four trumpets (Tr), <b>timpani</b> (Ti), two recorders (Fl), three oboes (Ob), {{two of them}} also playing oboes da caccia (Oc), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), and basso continuo (Bc).|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements, {{an opening}} choral fugue, alternating arias and recitatives and closing chorale. He scored {{the work for}} four vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a festive Baroque instrumental ensemble of three trumpets and <b>timpani,</b> two oboes, strings and continuo. The oboes and strings play with the voices in motet style in the choral sections, while the trumpets add {{the style of a}} new time. The cantata is part of Bach's Picander cycle.|$|E
5|$|Elgar {{conducted}} {{the world premiere}} of Cockaigne (In London Town) at a Royal Philharmonic Society concert at Queen's Hall in London in June 1901. The Oregon Symphony last performed the overture in January 1990, under Norman Leyden. The work, which is approximately 15 minutes in length, employs two flutes, piccolo, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, one contrabassoon, four horns, two trumpets, two cornets, three trombones, tuba, <b>timpani,</b> five percussionists, strings.|$|E
5|$|The album {{prominently}} features flute, acoustic {{and electric}} guitars and Hammond organ, {{which had been}} used previously, but the instrumentation includes harpsichord, xylophone, <b>timpani,</b> violin, lute, trumpet, saxophone, and a string section—all uncommon in the band's earlier blues-inspired rock. Anderson later said that the lyrics were partly derived from experiences his own childhood, though the overall theme was showing Bostock's attempt {{to make sense of}} life from his point of view.|$|E
5|$|The chamber version {{replaces the}} brass mostly by the organ and uses only one each of flute, oboe, {{clarinet}} and horn. <b>Timpani,</b> percussion and harp {{are the same}} as in the orchestra version, and for the strings, a minimum of two first violins, two second violins, two violas, one cello and one double bass required.|$|E
5|$|The {{structure}} shows symmetry {{around the}} central chorale. Expansive chorale movements using the complete orchestra frame the work. Both parts contain besides the bible narration (rec.) a reflective accompagnato recitative (acc.) and an aria with obbligato instruments. In {{the following table}} of the movements, the scoring is taken the Neue Bach-Ausgabe. The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred Dürr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The <b>timpani</b> always play with the trumpets and are not mentioned.|$|E
5|$|The total {{vocal and}} {{instrumental}} resources {{required for the}} oratorio are a SATB chorus with soprano, alto, tenor and bass soloists, and an orchestra comprising two flutes, two oboes, English horn, two clarinets, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones, <b>timpani,</b> cymbals and strings. According to the vocal score, the approximate duration {{of the work is}} 66 minutes.|$|E
5|$|As {{written in}} the {{original}} 1926 edition of the score, the Fifth Symphony is scored for 3 flutes (third doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, <b>timpani,</b> cymbals, triangle, tambourine, snare drum, celesta, and strings. Some optional doublings are added in the 1950 edition of the score revised by Emil Telmányi and Erik Tuxen; these include the third flute doubling flute in G and the second bassoon doubling contrabassoon. These optional doublings are discarded in the latest 1998 Carl Nielsen Edition score, which was produced as a co-operation between the Danish Royal Library and Edition Wilhelm Hansen.|$|E
5|$|Orchestras {{continued}} to use noise {{in the form of}} a percussion section, which expanded though the 19th century: Berlioz was perhaps the first composer to thoroughly investigate the effects of different mallets on the tone color of <b>timpani.</b> However, before the 20th century, percussion instruments played a very small role in orchestral music and mostly served for punctuation, to highlight passages, or for novelty. But by the 1940s, some composers were influenced by non-Western music as well as jazz and popular music, and began incorporating marimbas, vibraphones, xylophones, bells, gongs, cymbals, and drums.|$|E
5|$|The work {{is one of}} {{only two}} minor-key piano concertos that Mozart composed, the other being the No. 20 in D minor. None of Mozart's other piano concertos {{features}} a larger array of instruments: the work is scored for strings, woodwinds, horns, trumpets and <b>timpani.</b> The concerto consists of three movements. The first, Allegro, is in sonata form and is longer than any opening movement of Mozart's earlier concertos. The second movement, Larghetto, is in the relative major of E-flat and features a strikingly simple principal theme. The final movement, Allegretto, returns to the home key of C minor and presents a theme followed by eight variations.|$|E
5|$|Both the soprano part, {{which covers}} two octaves and {{requires}} a high C, and the solo trumpet part, which at times trades melodic lines with the soprano {{on an equal}} basis, are extremely virtuosic. The Bach scholar Alfred Dürr assumes that Bach had an unusually gifted singer, adding that a female voice was unlikely in conservative Leipzig. According to Joshua Rifkin Christoph Nichelmann is a possible candidate because Bach being aware of his capabilities accepted him willingly to the Thomasschule and Nichelmann matriculated into the school {{three weeks before the}} first performance. The trumpet part was probably written for Gottfried Reiche, Bach's principal trumpeter at the time. The scoring is unique in Bach's cantatas, but was frequently used by Italian composers such as Alessandro Scarlatti. Bach's son Friedemann Bach arranged the work by adding a second trumpet and <b>timpani.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{his early}} pieces for the Bouffes-Parisiens, {{the size of}} the {{orchestra}} pit had restricted Offenbach to an orchestra of 16 players. He composed for flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, two horns, piston, trombone, <b>timpani</b> and percussion and a small string section of seven players. After moving to the Salle Choiseul he had an orchestra of 30 players. The musicologist and Offenbach specialist Jean-Christophe Keck notes that when larger orchestras were available, either in bigger Paris theatres or in Vienna or elsewhere, Offenbach would compose, or rearrange existing music, accordingly. Surviving scores show his instrumentation for additional wind and brass, and even extra percussion. When they were available he wrote for cor anglais, harp, and, exceptionally, Keck records, an ophicleide (Le Papillon), tubular bells (Le carnaval des revues), and a wind machine (Le voyage dans la lune).|$|E
5|$|The {{duration}} {{of the work is}} about 35 minutes. The score calls for one piccolo, three flutes (third doubling second piccolo), one alto flute, four oboes (fourth doubling second English horn), English horn, three clarinets in B and A (third doubling second bass clarinet), clarinet in E and D, one bass clarinet, four bassoons (fourth doubling second contrabassoon), one contrabassoon; eight horns (seventh and eighth doubling tenor Wagner tubas), trumpet in D, four trumpets in C (fourth doubling bass trumpet in E), two trombones, one bass trombone, two bass tubas; a percussion section with 5 <b>timpani</b> (requiring two players), bass drum, tam-tam, triangle, tambourine, cymbals, antique cymbals in A and B, güiro; and strings. Despite the large orchestra, much of the score is written chamber-fashion, with individual instruments and small groups having distinct roles.|$|E
5|$|The {{movements}} 1 (Magnificat), 7 (Fecit potentiam) and 12 (Gloria patri) are {{the cornerstones of}} the composition: {{they are}} in the tonic key (E major for BWV 243a, D major for BWV 243), and are the only movements that feature a five-part chorus as well as a tutti orchestra. The chorus also sings in movement 4 (Omnes generationes), accompanied by an orchestra without trumpets and <b>timpani.</b> Each of these four choral movements are, in the version without the Christmas hymns, followed by two movements for a vocal soloist, the second one often with richer scoring. In the movements for vocal soloists the instrumentation is as usual in Bach's cantata's: the soloists are accompanied by an obbligato instrument, only strings and/or continuo. Movement A (Vom Himmel hoch) is the only a cappella movement.|$|E
5|$|Beecham {{appointed}} Victor Olof as his orchestral manager, {{and they}} started recruiting. At {{the top of their}} list were leading musicians with whom Beecham had worked before the war. Four had been founder members of the LPO fifteen years previously: Reginald Kell (clarinet), Gerald Jackson (flute), James Bradshaw (<b>timpani)</b> and Jack Silvester (double-bass). From the current LPO they engaged the oboist Peter Newbury. Beecham persuaded the veteran bassoonist Archie Camden, who had been pursuing a solo career, to return to orchestral work. The cellos were led by Raymond Clark, enlisted from the BBC Symphony Orchestra. The principal horn player was Dennis Brain, who already held the same post in Legge's Philharmonia, but managed to play for both orchestras. Jenkins speculates that as Beecham knew all Britain's orchestral leaders at first hand he decided not to try to lure any of them away. His choice was John Pennington, who had been first violin of the London String Quartet from 1927 to 1934, and had then had a career in the US as concertmaster, successively, of the San Francisco Symphony, Los Angeles Philharmonic and Paramount Pictures orchestras.|$|E
25|$|During concert pieces, <b>timpani</b> {{were often}} {{grounded}} momentarily, using a ti-pod leg system. Eventually around 1981, <b>timpani</b> and mallet instruments {{were allowed to}} be grounded in the front, paving {{the way to the}} modern day front ensemble. For a few years, corps still marched <b>timpani.</b> Some corps took advantage of the new rule, and grounded their <b>timpani.</b> However, some corps couldn't afford a new set of concert <b>timpani,</b> so they just grounded their marching <b>timpani.</b>|$|E
25|$|Graupner {{wrote for}} exotic {{combinations}} of instruments, including the oboe d'amore, flute d'amore, and viola d'amore. Over {{half of his}} sinfonias require brass and <b>timpani,</b> with about 25 sinfonias requiring 3 to 4 <b>timpani,</b> one (sinfonia in G Major GWV 611) 5 <b>timpani,</b> and another, sinfonia in F Major (GWV 566), was composed for 6 <b>timpani.</b>|$|E
25|$|Later, <b>timpani</b> {{were adopted}} into other {{classical}} music ensembles such as concert bands. In the 1970s, marching bands and drum and bugle corps, which evolved both from traditional marching bands and concert bands, began to include marching <b>timpani.</b> Unlike concert <b>timpani,</b> marching versions had fiberglass shells {{to make them}} light enough to carry. Each player carried a single drum, which was tuned by a hand crank. Often, during intricate passages, the <b>timpani</b> players would put their drums on the ground by means of extendable legs, and performed more like conventional <b>timpani,</b> yet with a single player per drum. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, marching arts-based organizations' allowance for <b>timpani</b> and other percussion instruments to be permanently grounded became mainstream. This {{was the beginning of}} the end for marching timpani: Eventually, standard concert <b>timpani</b> found their way onto the football field as part of the front ensemble, and marching <b>timpani</b> fell out of common usage. <b>Timpani</b> are still used by the Mounted Bands of the Household Division of the British Army.|$|E
25|$|A few solo concertos {{have been}} written for <b>timpani.</b> They are for <b>timpani</b> and orchestral accompaniment. The 18th-century {{composer}} Johann Fischer wrote a symphony for eight <b>timpani</b> and orchestra, which requires the solo timpanist to play eight drums simultaneously. Rough contemporaries Georg Druschetzky and Johann Melchior Molter also wrote pieces for <b>timpani</b> and orchestra. Throughout the 19th century {{and much of the}} 20th, there were few new <b>timpani</b> concertos. In 1983, William Kraft, principal timpanist of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, composed his Concerto for <b>Timpani</b> and Orchestra, which won second prize in the Kennedy Center Friedheim Awards. There have been other <b>timpani</b> concertos, notably, Philip Glass, {{considered one of the most}} influential composers of the late 20th century, wrote a double concerto at the behest of soloist Jonathan Haas titled Concerto Fantasy for Two Timpanists and Orchestra, which features its soloists playing nine drums apiece.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the marching}} mallet percussion, <b>timpani</b> were marched first when drum corps {{required}} {{everything to be}} marched. However, the <b>timpani</b> were used prior to mallets.|$|E
25|$|Changing {{the pitch}} of a <b>timpani</b> by turning each tension rod {{individually}} is a laborious process. In the late 19th century, mechanical systems to change the tension of the entire head at once were developed. Any <b>timpani</b> equipped with such a system may be considered machine <b>timpani,</b> although this term commonly refers to drums that use a handle connected to a spider-type tuning mechanism.|$|E
25|$|Since <b>timpani</b> {{have a long}} sustain, {{muffling}} or dampening is {{an inherent}} part of playing. Often, timpanists will muffle notes so they only sound for the length indicated by the composer. However, early <b>timpani</b> did not resonate nearly as long as modern <b>timpani,</b> so composers often wrote a note when the timpanist was to hit the drum without concern for sustain. Today, timpanists must use their ear and the score to determine the length the note should sound.|$|E
25|$|Ludwig van Beethoven {{revolutionized}} <b>timpani</b> {{music in}} the early 19th century. He not only wrote for drums tuned to intervals other than a fourth or fifth, but he gave a prominence to the instrument as an independent voice beyond programmatic use. For example, his Violin Concerto (1806) opens with four solo <b>timpani</b> strokes, and the scherzo of his Ninth Symphony (1824) sets the <b>timpani</b> (tuned an octave apart) against the orchestra {{in a sort of}} call and response.|$|E
25|$|<b>Timpani</b> are {{typically}} struck {{with a special}} type of drum stick called a <b>timpani</b> stick or <b>timpani</b> mallet. <b>Timpani</b> sticks are used in pairs. They have two components: a shaft and a head. The shaft is typically made from hardwood or bamboo but may also be made from aluminum or carbon fiber. The head can be constructed {{from a number of}} different materials, though felt wrapped around a wooden core is the most common. Other core materials include compressed felt, cork, and leather, and other wrap materials include chamois. Unwrapped sticks with heads of wood, felt, flannel, and leather are also common. Wooden sticks are used as a special effect—specifically requested by composers as early as the Romantic era—and in authentic performances of Baroque music.|$|E
25|$|Resonance {{can cause}} <b>timpani</b> {{not in use}} to vibrate, causing a quieter sound to be produced. Timpanists must {{normally}} avoid this effect, called sympathetic resonance, but composers have exploited it in solo pieces such as Elliott Carter's Eight Pieces for Four <b>Timpani.</b> Resonance is reduced by dampening or muting the drums, {{and in some cases}} composers will specify that <b>timpani</b> be played con sordino (with mute) or coperti (covered), both of which indicate that mutes—typically small pieces of felt or leather—should be placed on the head.|$|E
25|$|By far {{the most}} common type of <b>timpani</b> used today is the pedal <b>timpani,</b> which allows the tension of the head to be {{adjusted}} using a pedal mechanism. Typically, the pedal is connected to the tension screws via an assembly of either cast metal or metal rods called the spider.|$|E
25|$|Percussion: 2 <b>timpani</b> (E and B), bass drum.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the late}} 19th century, <b>timpani</b> were hand-tuned; that is, {{there was a}} {{sequence}} of screws with T-shaped handles, called taps, which altered {{the tension in the}} head when turned by players. Thus, tuning was a relatively slow operation, and composers had to allow a reasonable amount of time for players to change notes if they were called to tune {{in the middle of a}} work. The first 'machine' <b>timpani,</b> with a single tuning handle, was developed in 1812. The first pedal <b>timpani</b> originated in Dresden in the 1870s and are called Dresden <b>timpani</b> for this reason. However, since vellum was used for the heads of the drums, automated solutions were difficult to implement since the tension would vary unpredictably across the drum. This could be compensated for by hand-tuning, but not easily by a pedal drum. Mechanisms continued to improve in the early 20th century.|$|E
