5|$|Additionally, {{there was}} a points classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for {{finishing}} in the top 10 in a stage. For all stages, the win earned 15points, second place earned 12points, third 10, fourth 8, fifth 6, and one point fewer per place down to a single point for 10th. Points towards the classification could also be achieved {{at each of the}} intermediate sprints; these points were given to the top three riders through <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>with</b> 5points for first, 3 for second, and 1 point for third.|$|E
5|$|In the 1940s and 1950s, several {{companies}} started a competing bus service. There were accusations that the route was cross-subsidized and that price dumping was occurring {{along the route}} from Sandnes to Ålgård. In the early 1950s, discussion started about closing the line, and on 1 November 1955, all passenger transport was terminated, after a decision in parliament on 26 May 1955. This is <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>with</b> the most frequent passenger traffic in Norway to have been closed.|$|E

5|$|Lemoine's {{system of}} constructions, the Géométrographie, {{attempted}} {{to create a}} methodological system by which constructions could be judged. This system enabled a more direct process for simplifying existing constructions. In his description, he listed five main operations: placing a compass's end on a given point, placing it on a given line, drawing a circle with the compass placed upon the aforementioned point or line, placing a straightedge on a given line, and extending <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>with</b> the straightedge.|$|E
5|$|The Trøndelag Commuter Rail was {{established}} in 1993, increasing the frequency on {{the western part of}} <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> <b>With</b> the retirement of the Di 3 in 2000, the Class 92 multiple units were introduced also on the Meråker Line. The concept, originally named Mittnabotåget, saw two daily services, originally running all the way to Östersund Central Station. From 2007 a train change was introduced at Storlien. Through traffic was closed from November 2013 to March 2015 with a bridge closed on the Swedish side.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{there was}} a points classification, which awarded a green jersey. In the classification, cyclists {{received}} points for finishing in the top 10 in a stage. For stages, 1, 2 and 4 the win earned 25points, second place 22, third 20, fourth 18, fifth 16, sixth 14, seventh 12, eighth 10, ninth 8 and tenth 6. For stages 5, 6, 7 and 8 the win earned 15points, second place 12, third 10, fourth 8, fifth 6, and 1 point fewer per place down to a single point for 10th.

5|$|After {{the first}} month, {{the actual number}} of {{passengers}} was 125,971, compared to the predicted annual total of around 650,000 return journeys, i.e. 1.3m single journeys. By 23 January 2016, 537,327 passengers had been carried on <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>with</b> weekly figures consistently showing over 20,000 journeys made. Figures released on 31 May 2016 showed that 694,373 persons had been carried since 6 September 2015, an increase of 22% by reference to the predicted patronage. Tweedbank station saw 183,918 journeys compared to a predicted 18,978, while Galashiels had 104,593 trips against a predicted 20,567. However, Eskbank, Gorebridge and Shawfair recorded less than their predicted usage. In September 2016, it was announced that one million passengers had been carried on the reopened line.|$|E
5|$|As Ali Riza Bey, the {{commander}} of the 13th Regiment, took charge of the Ottoman effort around Lone Pine, the grenading continued into the next day as the Ottomans began to prepare for a large-scale counterattack. Throughout the morning the remaining Australian positions overlooking The Cup were abandoned before the fighting stopped briefly as both the Australians and Ottomans evacuated their wounded and removed the dead from the front-line. By this time the 1st and 2nd Battalions, which had been defending the heavily counterattacked southern flank, had suffered so many casualties that they were withdrawn from <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> <b>with</b> the 7th Battalion moving into their positions late in the afternoon. The 3rd, 4th and 12th Battalions remained holding the north and centre of the Australian line.|$|E
5|$|Despite these difficulties, the Channel Fleet was {{possessed of}} one of the best naval commanders of the age; its commander-in-chief, Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe, had learned his trade under Sir Edward Hawke and fought at the Battle of Quiberon Bay in 1759. In the spring of 1794, with the French convoy's arrival in European waters imminent, Howe had {{dispersed}} his fleet in three groups. George Montagu, in HMS Hector, was sent with six ships of the line and two frigates to guard British convoys to the East Indies, West Indies and Newfoundland as far as Cape Finisterre. Peter Rainier, in HMS Suffolk and commanding six other ships, was to escort the convoys {{for the rest of their}} passage. The third force consisted of 26 ships of <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> <b>with</b> several supporting vessels, under Howe's direct command. They were to patrol the Bay of Biscay for the arriving French.|$|E

5|$|Goods {{traffic was}} more substantial, with fruit, hops and timber being sent out and coal being received. The 1937 {{timetable}} showed two down freight workings from Paddock Wood and one conditional working for Goudhurst, {{while in the}} other direction two conditional workings ran from Hawkhurst and one from Goudhurst. These were market trains and carried wagons for Blackfriars Goods attached to freight services at Paddock Wood. The volume of goods carried fell into steep decline after the Second World War as more and more freight was taken to market by road. Coal traffic remained constant as did the transport of pot plants from local nurseries at Flimwell and Wadhurst for F W Woolworth. This was an important source of revenue for <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>with</b> one million pot plants a year being transported from Hawkhurst, bringing in around £1,000 per week. Up to four parcels and miscellaneous vans were loaded daily at Hawkhurst and attached to the last train to Tonbridge, with further collections possibly being made at Horsmonden; special services were laid on in the busy period before Mothering Sunday.|$|E

Finding {{that the rest of}} the orchestra have stopped playing while he continued his one recurring note, Bean, with encouragement from Rattle, plays an extended flourish and lastly touches a note that makes a flatulent sound, then stops.|$|E
5|$|In 1780, another {{fleet and}} 6,000troops {{commanded}} by Lieutenant-General Comte Jean-Baptiste de Rochambeau, landed at Newport, and shortly afterwards was blockaded by the British. In early 1781, General George Washington and the comte de Rochambeau planned an attack agaynst the British in the Chesapeake Bay area coordinated {{with the arrival}} of a large fleet commanded by Vice-Admiral Comte François Joseph Paul de Grasse from the West Indies. British Vice-Admiral Sir George Brydges Rodney, who had been tracking de Grasse around the West Indies, was alerted to the latter's departure, but was uncertain of the French admiral's destination. Believing that de Grasse would return a portion of his fleet to Europe, Rodney detached Rear-Admiral Sir Samuel Hood and 15 ships of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>with</b> orders to find de Grasse's destination in North America. Rodney, who was ill, sailed for Europe {{with the rest of his}} fleet in order to recover, refit his fleet, and to avoid the Atlantic hurricane season.|$|E

2500|$|After {{a period}} of eclipse, Garnier was {{employed}} on the frontier of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies and was later installed as military governor of Rome. [...] In 1799 during the War of the Second Coalition, he defeated the Sicilian army at Monte Redondo on 21 September 1799. But he was bottled up in Rome and compelled to surrender. On 29 September his 4,500-man garrison capitulated to a 4,000-strong Anglo-Neapolitan force commanded by Lieutenant General Bourcard. The French garrisons in Italy were cut off in large part due to British seapower. After his exchange, he led a 2,792-strong division in Louis Gabriel Suchet's corps in northwestern Italy {{in the spring of}} 1800. His division included <b>the</b> 33rd <b>Line</b> <b>with</b> 487 men, <b>the</b> 39th <b>Line</b> <b>with</b> 422 men, <b>the</b> 55th <b>Line</b> <b>with</b> 213 men, <b>the</b> 68th <b>Line</b> <b>with</b> 620 men, and <b>the</b> 104th <b>Line</b> <b>with</b> 1,050 men.|$|R

5|$|In 1872, the Deutsche Eisenbahnbaugesellschaft (German Railway Construction Company - DEG) {{filed the}} {{planning}} {{application for a}} railway line through the city, connecting the then-Schlesischer Bahnhof (today Berlin Ostbahnhof) to Charlottenburg, and continuing to Potsdam. In December 1873, the state of Prussia {{as well as the}} private rail enterprises Berlin-Potsdamer Eisenbahn, Magdeburg-Halberstädter Eisenbahn and Berlin-Hamburger Bahn bought shares in the DEG, and jointly founded the Berliner Stadteisenbahngesellschaft (Berlin City Railway Company). However, things did not go as expected and the DEG went into bankruptcy in 1878, which forced the Prussian state government to take over operations, pay for the construction of <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>with</b> state money and to reimburse the former private owners of the DEG. The state's interest in the line was attributed to the military, which after the 1870-1871 Franco-Prussian War was of the opinion that the railway networks would hinder mobilisation when not properly interconnected.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, SIRT {{purchased}} {{the property of}} the B and merged it with the Staten Island Railway. The line had been worked with B and SIRT equipment since it opened in 1890. By 1949, there were no longer any staffed offices along the line except at Arlington. All of the stations on <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> <b>with</b> the exception of Harbor Road, Lake Avenue, Livingston and Snug Harbor, had waiting rooms and agents. The stations without waiting rooms were flag stops; the train would only stop if there was someone waiting at the station. The station at Port Ivory, which was used for workers of the Procter & Gamble Plant and was only open for the morning and evening rush hour, closed around the year 1950.|$|E
5|$|In June 1968, an {{agreement}} was reached where the state Transportation Assistance Authority would pay $2 million and Penn Central would pay $2.5 million for the 11 Metroliners for Harrisburg service. On July 14, a 4-car train was tested on <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> <b>with</b> several demonstration runs for officials on August 21. In early October, several test trains proved {{the viability of the}} planned sub-3-hour schedules. Substation modifications later that month and a legal settlement between Budd and Penn Central in November paved the way for service to begin. On December 20, Penn Central announced that Metroliner service would begin on January 16, 1969.|$|E

5|$|In Stjørdal, {{controversy}} arose {{over the}} route. The river of Stjørdalselva creates a barrier {{just north of}} Hell, which made it cheaper to build the line on the south shore of the river to Hegra. However, the major population center was located at Stjørdalshalsen, {{on the north shore}} of the river. Locally, there were many protests against the line bypassing such a large town, but the cost of the bridge made Parliament choose the southern alternative. This gave residents in the town a considerably longer route to the train, since they had to cross the river to get access to the railway. This decreased the railway's ability to compete with the steam ships and thus the overall profitability of <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> <b>With</b> the arrival of the railway, transport to Trondheim became much easier than to Stjørdalshalsen and Levanger, helping Trondheim grow as a regional center.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{plans for}} the station were for access to be from Monmouth Road, which runs {{parallel}} to the railway, north of the line. There {{was to be a}} fully accessible footbridge across <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> <b>with</b> both ramp and stairs, as well as a pedestrian crossing across Monmouth Road and a lit 50-space car park on the old goods yard at the eastern end of Monmouth Road. The very end of the goods yard would be maintained for Network Rail access. These plans were changed following an agreement to acquire a property on Station Road. The new plans have the entrance to be on Station Road, at the east end of the site, meaning there would be no need for a footbridge. There would be disabled parking and a pick up/drop off point adjacent to the entrance, although the exact design of this area is still under consideration. Noise mitigation options are to be investigated and there will be improvements to local footpaths. The line is due to reopen in 2020.|$|E
5|$|It {{had been}} {{decided that the}} Bergen Line, unlike the Voss Line, was to be built with {{standard}} gauge. So the newly laid line from Bergen to Voss had to be converted {{in time for the}} opening of the Bergen Line. This was especially challenging because of the continuous traffic on <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> <b>with</b> 36 departures per day to Nesttun, six to Garnes and four to Voss. In preparation a few curves had to be straightened, the tunnels widened and the bridges strengthened. On the night of 10/11 August 1904 all the track was changed and in the morning the trains could operate on standard gauge to Voss.|$|E
