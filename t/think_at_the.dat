25|$|I didn't {{play that}} well in {{stages of the}} tour and other players {{deserved}} a game. But we got to halfway through the tour and (captain) Greg Chappell {{came to me and}} said there was trouble at the top of the order and asked if I would like to open the batting in the county games. I did that and I was quite successful. I <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the tour I finished about fifth in the batting averages. But that didn't seem to make any difference. I was the only one who didn't play a Test match.|$|E
500|$|When {{production}} restarted in 2005, {{there was}} a more budget-conscious approach to filming The Fountain, whose original budget was mostly intended for visual effects. Libatique reflected, [...] "Visual effects [...] {{a lot of the}} budget in the original conception. The popcorn moments were in there to justify the budget and bring target audiences into the theater. Ultimately, I think the streamlining of the film helped us tell the story more effectively. It's been stripped down to the core, to what it's really about: a search for immortality, when the truth of life is mortality. I <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the day, the theme of the film will be easier to feel." ...|$|E
500|$|Fear of Scientology's {{litigiousness}} rendered American networks {{unwilling to}} license any {{material to the}} filmmakers, which Gibney found [...] "astounding". He commented that he [...] "found it interesting that universally this subject — {{more than any other}} — provoked all the networks to decline to license. I <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the day, that tells you more about Scientology than it does about the networks, which is how ruthless they've been in trying to silence any criticism." [...] The church's reputation for harassing its critics made it necessary for Gibney to use burner phones to contact interviewees and film in secret: [...] "Sometimes for the on-camera interviews we'd set up gear in somebody's house and I'd make sure I'd be there hours before. Then the person would show up there so it was like they were just going to somebody’s house." ...|$|E

[...] Speaking to Channel 5, Barber {{revealed}} Rhys would not do a lot to redeem himself in the new year, but viewers would get learn more about his back story, which could explain his dark side. During a 2012 interview with Kilkelly, Barber said his character is good at getting what he wants, saying [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the day, he just wants to win and he has this ability to justify why he does things, and if people are hurt in the process, it's their fault. His vision is the one that is most important." [...] Barber said that deep down, Rhys is sensitive and he means well. When asked about the reaction Rhys has received from viewers, Barber believed they liked the character as he is unpredictable and manipulative. He added that the viewers are interested in seeing what Rhys does next. When asked how he felt about playing a bad boy by DNA's Matthew Myers, Barber revealed that he loved it, saying [...] "It's always exciting getting the scripts because I never know which way they are going to turn or who I'm going to be turning on!" [...] The actor quipped that he is always wondering which character he is going to manipulate or [...] "screw over" [...] next and added [...] "But at the core of things Rhys has a heart of gold." ...|$|E
500|$|By 1935 Jack Mara had {{received}} a degree from Fordham Law School, passed the bar, and was, at age 27, the team's president. By that same year, 19‑year‑old Wellington had become the team's secretary, {{and he started to}} exert influence over personal decisions. Newman retired before the 1935 season rather than come back from a back injury suffered the previous year when the team refused to give him a raise. This left Strong as the team's top draw, and the Giants signed him to a contract which guaranteed him $4,000 but gave him a percentage of the draw that could make his salary reach a maximum of $6,000 depending on attendance. At midseason the team's attendance had increased by 15% from the previous year's record ticket sales. Although Strong was paid well that season, and took advantage of high ticket sales from games in which he was injured, many of the other team's players were not. [...] "I felt pretty damn good," [...] Strong later said about his salary, [...] "but guys like Hein, Morgan, and Burnett weren't making much more than a hundred dollars a game. The salaries the front office fed to the newspapers weren't exactly true. We had three All-Stars on the Giants making less money than most of the bench warmers on the Dodgers. Hein was the greatest player the Giants ever had, but he didn't start making $5,000 until after his 12th season." [...] Hein remarked that he felt he was well paid for the time however, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time $150 [...] was probably the highest pay of any lineman in the league. It was pretty good money, even though it wouldn't sound that way now, but you could buy a loaf of bread for a nickel and get a full meal for thirty-five cents in the Automat back then. And you had no income tax." ...|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2009, Donna and Ringo's {{relationship}} {{goes through}} a rocky patch and during schoolies week, Donna sleeps with Andrew Robinson (Jordan Smith). Andrew later turns up in Erinsborough much to Donna's shock. Robbie said that Donna begins to [...] "freak out" [...] {{because she did not}} expect to see Andrew again and now he could tell everyone what happened between them. Robbie added [...] "Ringo and Donna were definitely going through a rocky patch for a while, but things were starting to look up. If she comes clean, they might find a way to work through it. But it doesn't look good." [...] Sam Clark said that Ringo and Donna's love for each other is very strong, but he was not sure if it was strong enough to survive a betrayal. Robbie and Clark also said that the couple were heading in different directions career-wise and it would be challenging for them. Donna later begins an affair with Andrew after he helps her out and then puts pressure on her to give in to their attraction. Robbie said that Donna is [...] "flattered" [...] by Andrew's interest in her and when Ringo puts his career before her, Andrew tells Donna what she wants to hear. On Andrew and Donna's compatibility, Robbie said [...] "Andrew's more into the fashion scene than Ringo. He's suave and well-dressed, and he's an aspiring businessman. He's perfect for the world Donna is trying to get into." [...] However, Robbie admitted that Ringo is the perfect guy for Donna as they balance each other out well. Ringo leaves for Sydney after finding out Donna cheated on him and when he returns his relationship with Donna is [...] "frosty". Robbie commented on the ex-couple's future and said [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moment it's quite in the balance. It's right up to the network at the moment as to whether they'll get back together or not." ...|$|E

As for myself, I have only meant to act kindly by you." [...] After that, Mr Butterwell took himself off.|$|R

However Kevin Carlyon, the self-titled [...] "high priest of the British white witches" [...] proclaimed that such actions would give the curse more power. He commented that: [...] "A curse can only work if people believe in it. I <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> moment the sculpture is a nice piece of history, but if the council destroys it, they would be showing their belief in the curse." ...|$|E

After the next election, {{if we have a}} more finely balanced chamber than we have had in the recent past, {{it will be a very}} different ball game.... I hope I can help us deal with that." [...] Beckett received 70 votes in the first round and 74 votes in the second rounds of the 2009 Speaker election. She withdrew following the second round of voting.|$|E
2500|$|After {{ten years}} of living, recording, and touring together, Europe {{decided to take a}} break {{at the end of the}} 1992 tour.

[...] In that time, Tempest and Marcello released solo albums whilst the other members participated in several different projects and bands. In return, Europe was dropped from Epic Records.|$|E

2500|$|Evanescence paused their tour to {{take part}} in the Carnival of Madness Tour {{alongside}} Halestorm, Cavo, New Medicine and Chevelle. This tour began on July 31, 2012, in Springfield, Illinois, and ran through September 2, 2012, ending in Buffalo, New York. The Evanescence Tour resumed in October 2012 with stops in South America, Costa Rica and Panama. The tour wrapped with a series of shows in England, ending on November 9, 2012, in London's Wembley Arena. Lee stated the band plans to take an extended break after the tour, saying, [...] "At the end of any really long tour you need to get your head in order. I <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the run we'll go on a break for a while and figure things out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Soon afterward, Terry Glenn was {{released}} to waivers. Owner Jerry Jones explained that, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{end of the}} day, it {{had more to do}} with where we are right now, the managing of how he got to the field, the aspect of concentrating on the what ifs and how it might've impacted how we give our young players a chance, and how we evaluate that position." [...] The main story lines in camp have revolved around the new addition of Adam [...] "Pacman" [...] Jones, and the injury to Terence Newman. Jones was proving daily in camp that he is still worthy of being named one of the top cornerbacks in the league, but was not fully reinstated to the NFL until August 28. Newman injured his groin on July 28, and is expected to be out for three weeks.|$|E
2500|$|During {{this time}} of her life she also was distant from her family, as she had married without their consent. According to Loveless, [...] "...I think my father thought I had lost my mind. This music is going to just ruin your life... it ruined your life... But it was a music that I learned from again... You wouldn't believe the people that would come to this club. They would get off from work, and they wouldn't go home. They'd come to this club and have a few beers, or ... dance.... I {{learned a lot about}} people and life in those places. I mean there was all walks of life... people who had hit the very bottom. And myself, there was times I felt myself {{becoming}} one of those people too. There was some hard times for us both, my ex-husband and I. And I <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time, it caused us to be torn apart, and we lost respect for each other. And {{it got to the point}} that we didn't know each other..." [...] A low point of her life was in October 1979, when her father, whom she idolized, died near Louisville while Loveless was in North Carolina.|$|E

2500|$|With Acu-Gen {{choosing}} not {{to publish}} proof of its claims and evidence of several women receiving inaccurate predictions, doctors {{are concerned about the}} test. [...] Among the scientific evidence cited by Acu-Gen's web site is a paper co-authored by Diana Bianchi, an expert on fetal DNA at Tufts University. The NPR story quoted Bianchi as saying, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> present time we need to be concerned whether the test is accurate or not", and [...] "I think it's caveat emptor. Let the buyer beware." [...] Another criticism has come from Sandra Carson, professor of obstetrics and gynecology and involved in research in sex selection. Carson says, [...] "Until Acu-Gen releases its data, there's no way to know the test's reliability. [...] Until that's out, I think it shouldn't be on the market." [...] Carson at that time was at the Baylor College of Medicine. [...] Dr. Charles Lockwood, chairman {{of obstetrics and gynecology at}} Yale School of Medicine, said that it is possible for fetal DNA to be found in maternal blood as soon as the placenta has developed, and that detection after five weeks [...] "is not impossible" [...] and the president of Acu-Gen said the suit was [...] "totally bogus".|$|E
2500|$|Michael Hogan of The Telegraph {{noted that}} [...] "Capaldi {{is back to}} his charismatic best" [...] in [...] "The Pilot", stating [...] "devoted Whovian is keen {{to go out with}} a bang", and {{described}} his character as [...] "mercurial, magical and kind". Patrick Mulkern praised Sarah Dollard's writing of the Doctor in [...] "Thin Ice", noting how she [...] "examines his moral code; the ideals he aspires to and the crimes and misdemeanors he's prepared to indulge". Capaldi's performance in [...] "Extremis" [...] received praise, with Alasdair Wilkins stating [...] "Peter Capaldi is perilously close to becoming my unqualified pick for favorite Doctor, he underplays the moment, making small choices to signal both his compassion and his heartbreak". He also praised the interactions between him and Missy, noting how they recall [...] "a more emotionally complex version of the repartee that Jon Pertwee’s Doctor and Roger Delgado’s Master had during their many encounters". Patrick Mulkern praised Capaldi’s performance in [...] "The Lie of the Land" [...] proclaiming [...] "he wavers between downright nasty and at best disconcerting. He’s world-weary — specifically, Earth-weary. You can almost believe he’s working for the dark side, so great is his disenchantment with the human race". After the broadcast of World Enough and Time, Steven Moffat paid a special tribute to Capaldi, “Peter only has to <b>think</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> screen and you know what he’s thinking,” he said. “He only has to move his face and I know the particular blend of Scottish torment he’s feeling right now. Despite trying to fight his emotions, he has given us the most emotional Doctor.” [...] Capaldi received overwhelming praise for his performance in [...] "The Doctor Falls" [...] with Patrick Mulkern noted the episode as a story dedicated to the character and how he [...] "stands tall", along with Daniel Jackson of the Daily Mirror highlighting the twelfth Doctor, praising how he [...] "simply shines". Flickering Myth stated [...] "Peter Capaldi is a magnificent Doctor, a person who captures the wisdom, madness, caring and frustration of a two-thousand year old Time Lord". Digital Spy praised Capaldi's [...] "Where I stand is where I fall" [...] speech, noting it as quite possibly the actor's finest moment to date. Simon Brew of Den of Geek heavily praised the actor's performance stating: [...] "The majestic, wonderful, brilliant Peter Capaldi. If you needed a reminder of just how much he’s going to be missed when he finally departs Doctor Who {{at the end of the}} year, his outstanding work here was precisely that. When he was blasted, apparently mortally, and he kept holding off his regeneration I found myself saying out loud “I don’t want you to go”". Ross Ruediger of New York Magazine agreed, admitting that [...] "the man’s been a revelation. I love Peter Capaldi. He has without a doubt been my Doctor for this new incarnation of Doctor Who that’s wrapping up its tenth season, and we have been nothing short of fortunate to have been blessed with his talents. I don’t want you to go either, Peter".|$|E
