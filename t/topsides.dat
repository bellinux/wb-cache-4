5|$|Crash has {{the ability}} to jump into the air and land on an enemy character, spin in a tornado-like fashion to knock enemies off-screen, slide across the ground, and perform a body slam to break certain objects. Crash can jump higher than he {{normally}} can if he jumps immediately following a slide. All of these techniques can be used as offensive measures against most enemies, whom serve to deter Crash's progress. Enemies with deadly <b>topsides</b> cannot be jumped on, while enemies that attack from the front or have side spikes must be jumped on or undergo a body slam. Enemies with sharp necklines (such as frill-necked lizards or long-legged robots with heated circumferences) can only be defeated if Crash slides into them.|$|E
5|$|Since {{being brought}} to London Belfast has twice been drydocked {{as part of the}} ship’s {{long-term}} preservation. In 1982 she was docked at Tilbury, and in June 1999 Belfast was towed to Portsmouth. This {{was the first time she}} had been to sea in 28 years and thus required a Certificate of Seaworthiness from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. While in dock, her entire hull was cleaned, blasted, and repainted, her hull blanking plates inspected and an ultrasonic survey carried out. She is not expected to require further drydocking until 2020. While under tow to Portsmouth she was delayed by bad weather and arrived a day late: it had been intended that she would arrive on 6 June 1999, the fifty-fifth anniversary of the Normandy landings. During the maintenance work, Belfast hull and <b>topsides</b> were repainted in her specific camouflage scheme officially known as Admiralty Disruptive Camouflage Type 25, which she had worn from November 1942 to July 1944. This was objected to by some, due to the anachronistic conflict between her camouflage, which reflects the majority of her active Second World War service, and her present configuration, which was the result of the ship's extended refit from January 1956 to May 1959. With the establishment of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport's (DCMS) Advisory Committee on National Historic Ships in 2006, Belfast was listed as part of the National Historic Fleet.|$|E

40|$|The {{representation}} of the <b>topside</b> ionosphere (the region above the F 2 peak) is critical because of the limited experimental data available. Over the years, {{a wide range of}} models have been developed in an effort to represent the behaviour and the shape of the electron density (Ne) profile of the <b>topside</b> ionosphere. Various studies have been centred around calculating the vertical scale height (VSH) and have included (a) obtaining VSH from Global Positioning System (GPS) derived total electron content (TEC), (b) calculating the VSH from ground-based ionosonde measurements, (c) using <b>topside</b> sounder vertical Ne profiles to obtain the VSH. One or a combination of the <b>topside</b> profilers (Chapman function, exponential function, sech-squared (Epstein) function, and/or parabolic function) is then used to reconstruct the <b>topside</b> Ne profile. The different approaches and the modelling techniques are discussed with a view to identifying the most adequate approach to apply to the South African region’s <b>topside</b> modelling efforts. The IRI- 2001 <b>topside</b> model is evaluated based on how well it reproduces measured <b>topside</b> profiles over the South African region.

500|$|At 09:27 a shell hitting Bismarck {{penetrated}} the hydraulic machinery in turret 'Anton' and disabled it, causing the guns {{to run down}} to maximum depression. Her <b>topsides</b> were wrecked, and a large fire burned amidships. After firing steadily for over 30 minutes, without any problems, King George V , by 09:27, began having trouble with her main battery, and from that point onward every salvo missed at least one gun due to failures in the safety interlocks for antiflash protection and from ammunition feed jams. At [...] 10:21, with Bismarck silenced and obviously sinking, Admiral Tovey detailed the cruiser [...] to finish her off with torpedoes. King George V fired 339 14 in (354 mm) and over 700 5.25 in (133 mm) shells during the action. As both Rodney and [...] King George V were low on fuel they returned to port at , escorted by eleven destroyers to guard against German air or submarine attack.

500|$|Spee {{immediately}} {{turned to}} close and signalled his ships to open fire at 19:04 when the range closed to [...] Spee's flagship, Scharnhorst, engaged Good Hope while Gneisenau fired at Monmouth. Cradock's flagship was {{hit on the}} Scharnhorsts third salvo, when shells knocked out her forward 9.2-inch turret and set her forecastle on fire. Cradock, knowing his only chance was to close the range, continued to do so despite the battering that Spee's ships inflicted. By 19:23 the range was almost half of that when the battle began and the British ships bore onwards. Spee tried to open the range, fearing a torpedo attack, but the British were only [...] away at 19:35. Seven minutes later, Good Hope charged directly at the German ships, although they dodged out of her way. Spee ordered his armoured cruisers to concentrate their fire on the British flagship and she soon drifted to a halt with her <b>topsides</b> all aflame. At 19:50 her forward magazine exploded, severing the bow {{from the rest of}} the ship, and she later sank in the darkness. Spee estimated that his flagship had made 35 hits on Good Hope, suffering only two hits in return that did no significant damage and failed even to wound one crewman. Good Hope was sunk with all hands, a total of 919 officers and enlisted men. Four of the midshipmen aboard the ship were the first casualties of the newly formed Royal Canadian Navy.|$|E
40|$|In this {{investigation}} we apply a model-assisted technique {{to construct the}} <b>topside</b> electron density proﬁle. This technique {{is based on the}} <b>Topside</b> Sounder Model (TSM), which provides the plasma scale height (Ts), O+/H+ transition height (Th), and their ratio Rt=Ts/Th, derived from <b>topside</b> sounder data of Alouette and ISIS satellites. The <b>Topside</b> Sounder Model Proﬁler (TSMP) incorporates TSM and uses the model quantities as anchor points for the construction of <b>topside</b> density (Ne) proﬁles. In the present version, TSMP takes the F 2 peak characteristics – foF 2, hmF 2, and the neutral scale height HmF 2 at hmF 2 – from ground-based Digisonde measurements. Previous investigations have demonstrated that HmF 2, used in the Digisondes to construct the <b>topside</b> proﬁles, is smaller than the <b>topside</b> scale height extracted from <b>topside</b> sounder proﬁles, at middle latitudes. Therefore the Digisonde scale heights have to be adjusted by a factor estimated for each Digisonde location. When the Digisonde scale height is corrected by this factor, the reconstructed <b>topside</b> proﬁles are close to those provided by TSM. The new TSMP/Digisonde assisted technique of <b>topside</b> proﬁle construction can improve the <b>topside</b> proﬁles from the worldwide network of Digisonde sounders. Extensive comparison and veriﬁcation with ground and satellite derived TEC assesses the performance of the proposed technique. A ﬁrst indication from the comparison with CHAMP reconstructed proﬁles shows lower density of TSMP/Digisonde proﬁles between 400 km and 2000 km. Further comparisons with Vary-Chap proﬁles and RPI plasmagrams from the IMAGE satellite will lead to useful conclusions concerning the performance of the proposed method up to geosynchronous altitudes. ...|$|R
40|$|The IRI {{electron}} density <b>topside</b> has been constructed {{on the basis}} of the data available about thirty years ago. Recently a large amount of data from old <b>topside</b> sounders have been processed to get {{electron density}} profiles. These profiles allow to test IRI model under a wide spectrum of different conditions and to understand the behavior of the modeled <b>topside.</b> A set of 12 000 <b>topside</b> profiles have been chosen from the ISIS 2 database, selecting those with the better quality of the inverted profile. An analysis of each IRI <b>topside</b> constitutive parameter has been done for all the experimental cases allowing to find some critical conditions under which the IRI <b>topside</b> could become completely unrealistic. In particular for very high solar activity at high latitudes it has been found that some IRI parameters could reach values that change drastically the shape of IRI <b>topside.</b> A proposal to control their range of variability is formulated in order to avoid the occurrence of such cases...|$|R
40|$|To {{improve the}} {{accuracy}} of the real time <b>topside</b> electron density profiles given by the Digisonde software a new model-assisted technique is used. This technique uses the <b>Topside</b> Sounder Model (TSM), which provides the plasma scale height (Hs), O+–H+ transition height (HT), and their ratio Rt = Hs/HT, derived from <b>topside</b> sounder data of Alouette and ISIS satellites. The <b>Topside</b> Sounder Model Profiler (TSMP) incorporates TSM and uses the model quantities as anchor points in construction of <b>topside</b> density (Ne) profiles. For any particular location, TSMP calculates <b>topside</b> Ne profiles by specifying the values of foF 2 and hmF 2. In the present version, TSMP takes the F 2 peak characteristics – foF 2, hmF 2, and the scale height at hmF 2 – from the Digisonde measurements. The paper shows results for the Digisonde stations Athens and Juliusruh. It is found that the <b>topside</b> scale height used in Digisonde reconstruction is less than that extracted from <b>topside</b> sounder profiles. Rough comparison of their bulk distributions showed that they differ by an average factor of 1. 25 for locations of Athens and Juliusruh. When the Digisonde scale heights are adjusted by this factor, the reconstructed <b>topside</b> profiles are close to those provided by TSM. Compared with CHAMP reconstruction profiles in two cases, TSMP/Digisonde profiles show lower density between 400 and 2000 km...|$|R

2500|$|Empire Defender {{departed}} from Southend on 27 September {{as a member}} of Convoy FN 524, which arrived at Methil on 29 September. The next day, she {{departed from}} Methil to join Convoy EC 79, which had departed from Southend on 28 September and arrived at Oban, Argyllshire on 3 October. She sailed on to the Clyde, arriving on 3 October. Empire Defender was ordered to sail from Glasgow to Malta laden with ammunition, as part of Operation Astrologer. On 20 October 1941, 60 lascar sailors refused to sail, claiming that the vessel was cursed and would be sunk before the next new moon. The authorities were unable to persuade them to sail by either threats or inducements. An equivalent number of white sailors were procured with a payment of £10 in cash each to accept the lascar accommodation. The ship had been repainted with a black hull, white <b>topsides</b> and a buff funnel, contrary to wartime regulations. All armament had been removed {{in an effort to make}} the ship appear as though it belonged to a neutral country. She departed from the Clyde on 29 October to join Convoy OG 76, which departed from Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire on 26 October and arrived at Gibraltar on 11 November. Empire Defender passed Gibraltar on 11 November, and headed for Malta. The flag of whichever nation's waters she was in at the time was painted on her hull, thus she was passed off as a French, Spanish and Italian ship. Operation Astrologer had probably been compromised following the loss of the merchantman [...] on 2 May 1941 and the subsequent interrogation of her crew who were interned in France.
