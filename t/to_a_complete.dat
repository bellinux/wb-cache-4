5|$|Alkan's {{attachment}} to his Jewish origins is displayed both {{in his life}} and his work. He was the first composer to incorporate Jewish melodies in art music. Fluent in Hebrew and Greek, he devoted much time <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> new translation of the Bible into French. This work, like many of his musical compositions, is now lost. Alkan never married, but his presumed son Élie-Miriam Delaborde was, like Alkan, a virtuoso performer on both the piano and the pedal piano, and edited a number of the elder composer's works.|$|E

She won next at the Stanford International Pro-Am in April then following a week off, won again at the Michelob ULTRA Open at Kingsmill in a tournament record score, giving her three wins and over $1million in earnings by mid-May. It was her 72nd and final ever win on the LPGA Tour.|$|E
5|$|The {{mission of}} the Swiss Air Force {{historically}} has been to support ground troops (erdkampf) in repelling invasions of neutral Swiss territory, with a secondary mission of defending the sovereignty of Swiss airspace. During World War II this doctrine was severely tested when Switzerland was literally {{caught in the middle}} of an air war and subjected to both attacks and intrusions by aircraft of all combatants. Its inability to prevent such violations of its neutrality led for a period <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> cessation of air intercepts, followed by a practice of coercing small numbers of intruders to submit to internment.|$|E

5|$|Argentina, {{like many}} other countries, entered into a {{recession}} following the beginning of World War I as international flows of goods, capital and labour declined. Foreign investment in Argentina came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> standstill from which it never fully recovered: Great Britain had become heavily indebted to the United States {{during the war and}} would never again export capital at a comparable scale. And after the opening of the Panama canal in 1914, Argentina and the other Southern cone economies declined, as investors turned their attention to Asia and the Caribbean. The United States, which came out of the war a political and financial superpower, especially perceived Argentina (and to a lesser extent Brazil) as a potential rival on world markets. Neither the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange nor the private domestic banks developed rapidly enough to fully replace British capital.|$|E
5|$|As soon as {{the lead}} T-34s reached the minefield, they {{came under heavy fire}} from the fort's garrison. Soon all three tanks were either {{destroyed}} or damaged, so the combat engineers proceeded to breach the minefield on their own. Israeli aircraft began strafing and bombing the Egyptian forces for over {{two and a half hours}} while encountering no resistance, leading to the destruction of all six tanks and five vehicles. The Israelis bombed Egyptian forces at the minefield and on an area of the strip stretching two kilometers towards Port Fouad. Under fire from the air and from the fort, the attack bogged down <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> halt before the Egyptians began to retreat. Salah ordered his battalion to assume defensive positions east of Port Fouad to repel any Israeli counterattack and to regroup.|$|E
5|$|At 3 a.m. about 120 {{bank and}} trust company {{officials}} assembled {{to hear a}} full report {{on the status of}} the failing trust companies. While the Trust Company of America was barely solvent, the Lincoln Trust Company was probably $1 million short of what it needed to cover depositor accounts. As discussion ensued, the bankers realized that Morgan had locked them in the library and pocketed the key to force a solution, the sort of strong-arm tactic he had been known to use in the past. Morgan then entered the talks and advised the trust companies they must provide a loan of $25 million to save the weaker institutions. The trust presidents were still reluctant to act, but Morgan informed them that if they did not it would lead <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> collapse of the banking system. Through his considerable influence, at about 4:45a.m. he persuaded the unofficial leader of the trust companies to sign the agreement, and the remainder of the bankers followed. Having received these commitments, Morgan allowed the bankers to go home.|$|E

5|$|Discussions {{were held}} {{during the second}} wave of strikes, when Brendan Barber {{announced}} {{on the afternoon of}} Friday 30 October that proposals had been put to both Royal Mail and the CWU for them to consider over the weekend. Talks resumed on the Monday, however this news was overshadowed by the announcement that a further two days of strikes would be held on Friday 6 November and Monday 9 November. It was also announced that these would be all out strikes with everybody walking out at the same time rather than the rolling strike action that had been adopted previously, thus leading <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> stoppage throughout the course of the action. These were later called off in order for further talks to take place.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{creative}} differences, Kuntz {{backed out of}} the project, but created an adventure module that would be published {{at the same time as}} Gygax's first book. Gygax continued to painstakingly put Castle Zagyg together on his own, but even this slow and laborious process came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> halt when Gygax suffered a serious stroke in April 2004 and then another one a few weeks later. Although he returned to his keyboard after a seven-month convalescence, his output was reduced from 14-hour work days to only one or two hours per day. Finally in 2005, Castle Zagyg Part I: Yggsburgh, the first book in the six-book series, appeared. Later that year, Troll Lord Games also published Castle Zagyg: Dark Chateau (2005), the adventure module written for the Yggsburgh setting by Rob Kuntz. Jeff Talanian helped with the creation of the dungeon, eventually resulting in publication of the limited edition CZ9: The East Marks Gazetteer (2007).|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was caught}} by {{surprise}} at Le Mans but made a forced march north to Alençon, from where he could escape into the safety of Normandy. Suddenly, however, Henry turned back south towards Anjou, {{against the advice of}} his officials. The weather was extremely hot, the King was increasingly ill and he appears to have wanted to die peacefully in Anjou rather than fight yet another campaign. Henry evaded the enemy forces on his way south and collapsed in his castle at Chinon. Philip and Richard were making good progress, not least because it was now obvious that Henry was dying and that Richard would be the next king, and the pair offered negotiations. They met at Ballan, where Henry, only just able to remain seated on his horse, agreed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> surrender: he would do homage to Philip; he would give up Alice to a guardian and she would marry Richard {{at the end of the}} coming crusade; he would recognise Richard as his heir; he would pay Philip compensation, and key castles would be given to Philip as a guarantee.|$|E

5|$|In November 2006, Keyes criticized Massachusetts {{governor}} Mitt Romney for instituting {{gay marriage}} entirely on his own—according to Keyes—with no requirement or {{authority to do}} so under Massachusetts law. Keyes said Romney's actions, which he suggested were due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> misunderstanding of his role as governor and {{of the limitations of}} the judicial branch of government, were not necessitated by a ruling of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in November 2003 that directed the state legislature to institute same-sex marriage. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial court had ruled that the state law banning same-sex marriage was not constitutional. The court gave the Massachusetts Legislature 180 days to modify the law; after it failed to do so, Gov. Mitt Romney ordered town clerks to begin issuing marriage licenses on May 17, 2004, in compliance with the court ruling.|$|E
5|$|In United States v. Gooding (1827), the Court {{construed}} {{the elements}} of the fitting out offense. First, the Court held that the offense of fitting out a vessel for slave trading could be committed even if the owner of the vessel did not personally fit it out. Second, the Court held that the statute could be violated by a partial fitting out (as opposed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> fitting out) of a vessel for that purpose. Third, the Court held thatsince slave trading was a misdemeanorthere was no distinction between principal and accessory. Fourth, the Court held that, for the statute to be violated, the fitting out must have occurred within the United States. Finally, the Court held that the statute's mens rea required that the owner intend to cause the vessel to be used for slave trading, as opposed to intending that the vessel be used for slave trading (by some third party).|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years, Zara Yaqob became more despotic. When Takla Hawariat, abbot of Dabra Libanos, criticized Yaqob's beatings {{and murder of}} men, the emperor had the abbot himself beaten and imprisoned, where he died after few months. Zara Yaqob was {{convinced}} of a plot against him in 1453, which led to more brutal actions. He increasingly became convinced that {{his wife and children}} were plotting against him, and had several of them beaten. Seyon Morgasa, the mother of the future emperor Baeda Maryam I, died from this mistreatment in 1462, which led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> break between son and father. Eventually relations between the two were repaired, and Zara Yaqob publicly designated Baeda Maryam as his successor.|$|E

5|$|In making {{preparations}} for filming, the producers {{found that the}} cost of production in the New York City area would be prohibitive and it was also going to be difficult to find locations that resembled early 1950s New York. Part of the financing plan was hinging on a co-production deal with Canada, with filming taking place in Montreal, but Haynes joining the production led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> re-think. Karlsen recalled making a film 27 years earlier in Cincinnati, Ohio, that was set in 1950s New York. After researching the city, she found that it had not changed much in decades and the state of Ohio also had one of the best film tax incentives in the United States. The city of Cincinnati was very accommodating to the production, which employed many local citizens as crew.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} {{the passage of}} the Licinio-Sextian law of 367 BC, which required the election of at least one Plebeian Consul each year, a series of laws were passed which ultimately granted Plebeians political equality with Patricians. The Patrician era came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> end in 287 BC, with {{the passage of the}} Hortensian law. This era was also marked with significant external developments. Up until 295 BC, the Samnites and the Kelts had been Rome's chief rivals, but that year, at the Battle of Sentinum, the Romans defeated the combined armies of the Samnites and the Kelts. This battle was followed by the complete submission of both the Samnites and the Kelts to the Romans, and the emergence of Rome as the unchallenged mistress of Italy.|$|E
5|$|Marx {{continued}} to write articles for the New York Daily Tribune {{as long as}} he was sure that the Tribune's editorial policy was still progressive. However, the departure of Charles Dana from the paper in late 1861 and the resultant change in the editorial board brought about a new editorial policy. No longer was the Tribune to be a strong abolitionist paper dedicated <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> Union victory. The new editorial board supported an immediate peace between the Union and the Confederacy in the Civil War in the United States with slavery left intact in the Confederacy. Marx strongly disagreed with this new political position and in 1863 was forced to withdraw as a writer for the Tribune.|$|E

5|$|On 16 May SS-Standarte Deutschland, several {{kilometres}} to {{the west}} of the Zanddijk Position, approached the Canal through Zuid-Beveland, where the French 271e Régiment d’Infanterie was present, only partly dug in and now reinforced by the three retreated Dutch battalions. An aerial bombardment that morning routed the defenders before the ground attack had even started; the first German crossings around 11:00 led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> collapse. An attempt in the evening of the same day to force the eight hundred metres long Sloedam, over which most of the French troops had fled to Walcheren, ended in failure. On 16 May the island of Tholen was taken against light opposition; on 17 May Schouwen-Duiveland fell.|$|E
5|$|On 30 May 1916, Engadine was {{attached}} to the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron, commanded by Rear Admiral Trevylyan Napier, and carried two Short Type 184 and two Sopwith Baby floatplanes aboard. The two-seat Type 184s were intended for observation and were fitted with a low-power wireless while the Babys were intended to shoot down Zeppelins. Engadine accompanied the cruisers when the Battlecruiser Fleet sortied from Rosyth that evening to intercept the German High Seas Fleet. For a time on 31 May she was actually leading the BCF and may {{have been one of the}} first ships to spot the oncoming Germans. Her position in the vanguard was dictated by the requirement for smooth water to successfully launch her aircraft; turbulent water from ships' wakes was enough to ruin a take off attempt. She would also have to come <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> stop to hoist her aircraft over the side and prepare it for launch, a process that took at least 20 minutes at anchor. Thus she could launch her floatplane in unruffled water and then fall back among the main body of the fleet.|$|E
5|$|On {{the grand}} {{strategic}} level Marlborough had a rare {{grasp of the}} broad issues involved, and was able {{from the start of}} the Spanish Succession war to see the conflict in its entirety. He was one of the few influences working towards genuine unity within the Grand Alliance, but the extension of the war aims to include the replacement of PhilipV as King of Spain was a fatal mistake. Marlborough stands accused – possibly for political and diplomatic reasons – of not pressing his private doubts about reinforcing failure. Spain proved a continuous drain of men and resources, and ultimately hampered his chances of complete success in Flanders, the war's main theatre. The Allies did come close <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> victory on several occasions, but the increasingly severe conditions imposed upon LouisXIV forestalled an early end to hostilities. Although the Duke lost his political influence in the latter stages of the war he still possessed vast prestige abroad, yet his failure to communicate his innermost convictions to his allies or political masters means he must bear some responsibility for the continuance of the war beyond its logical conclusion.|$|E
