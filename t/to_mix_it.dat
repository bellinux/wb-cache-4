5|$|Peace Sells... but Who's Buying? is {{the second}} studio album and major label debut by the American thrash metal band Megadeth, {{released}} on September 19, 1986 by Capitol Records. The project was originally handled by Combat Records, resulting in the first mix of the album being co-produced by Randy Burns. Capitol Records then bought {{the rights to the}} album and hired another producer, Paul Lani, <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> <b>it</b> himself. The recording of the album was difficult for the band, because of the ongoing drug issues the members had at the time. This was the last Megadeth album to feature drummer Gar Samuelson and guitarist Chris Poland, who were fired shortly after the album's promotional tour for drug abuse. The title track, noted for its politically conscious lyrics, was released as the album's lead single.|$|E

25|$|To {{limit the}} {{environmental}} impact of returning the brine to the ocean, it can be diluted with another stream of water entering the ocean, such as the outfall of a wastewater treatment or power plant. With medium to large power plant and desalination plants, the power plant's cooling water flow is likely to be several times larger than that of the desalination plant, reducing the salinity of the combination. Another method to dilute the brine is <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> <b>it</b> via a diffuser in a mixing zone. For example, once a pipeline containing the brine reaches the sea floor, it can split into many branches, each releasing brine gradually through small holes along its length. Mixing can be combined with power plant or wastewater plant dilution.|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} was {{engineered by}} Jim Caruana and mixed by Jason Goldstein at Sony Music Studios in New York City. Goldstein was [...] hired to mix B'Day. He said: [...] "This song was really simple <b>to</b> <b>mix.</b> <b>It</b> {{was produced by}} Stargate and the sounds are really good and they all made sense, and {{there was lots of}} room for all the instruments." [...] Goldstein used a board equalizer for the drums' treatment. For the acoustic guitars, he used the analogue flanger of a TC 1210 spatial expander [...] "to sweeten the sound" [...] and to give them [...] "a little bit more spread". Goldstein thought [...] "Irreplaceable" [...] sounded [...] "a bit old-school"; an eighth note delay echo was placed on the song's lead vocal at 341ms, using the Echo Farm plug-in software. For the backing vocals, Goldstein used Echo Farm with a quarter note delay at 682ms and Sony's Oxford Dynamics compressor/limiter in dual-mono mode.|$|E
500|$|The final {{thing that}} he did {{was to create a}} {{breakdown}} using Auto-Tune and the Nord Lead synthesizer, applying its echo function. In total Ahmadzaï worked for 15days on the track, finally handing it to mixing engineer Mark [...] "Spike" [...] Stent. He explained in an interview with Keyboard magazine that the version that he created was almost same to the final track present in Music. On most of the other tracks, Stent tried to add a lot of mixing effects to Ahmadzaï's production. But for [...] "Impressive Instant", they tried <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> <b>it</b> first from the Sony digital tracks and failed get the original sound of the demo, since the compression present in the track was the actual sound to be produced. So Stent took the sound from Ahmadzaï's Yamaha 02R mixer, including the bass, loops, and the kick. Along with mixing the track at Olympic Studios, London, the mastering was done by Tim Young at Metropolis Studio. Other engineers working on the track included Mark Endert, Sean Spuehler, Tom Hannen and Tim Lambert.|$|E

500|$|The {{recording}} and mixing of [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] {{took place in}} summer and autumn of 2008. After Rowland heard the instrumental of [...] "When Love Takes Over"—a piano loop-based melody with throbbing percussion—she asked Guetta if she could take the demo and several other tracks to work on. She wrote the lyrics and recorded the vocals in London, within a day. She was aided by Australian songwriters and producers Miriam and Olivia Nervo (The Nervo Twins). However the song remained unfinished until Guetta rediscovered the track while compiling his One Love album. After getting selected for the album, [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] was given to Frédéric Riesterer who, aside from producing the song with Guetta, was tasked the final audio mixing of the song. However Riesterer decided to give the track to French mixing engineer Veronica Ferraro, who would later go {{on to say that}} [...] "Reisterer was supposed <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> <b>it,</b> but he wanted me to do it and see how it turned out. The first time I heard the track I immediately knew it would be a huge hit." [...] The track was mixed in September 2008, at Ferraro's Super Sonic Scale studio near Paris, the day after her birthday.|$|E
500|$|Furlan {{is said to}} {{have asked}} for her {{character}} to be written out of the series because {{she did not want to}} travel to Hawaii to film her scenes, although she later called this an untrue rumor. [...] The producers decided for Rousseau to be shot, with the possibility of her returning in season five. [...] Co-show runners and executive producers Damon Lindelof and Cuse originally intended for Rousseau to get her own flashback episode in season four, however as a result of the Writer's Strike, this did not come to pass. When asked whether Rousseau would have a flashback in season five, Lindelof said that Rousseau's story would [...] "definitively" [...] be revealed, but that [...] "to use the word flashback would be disingenuous". Cuse revealed that they were trying to steer away from the word flashback and were [...] "embracing a whole new word". He explained that [...] "there will still [...] be flashbacks and flash-forwards on the show, but we're going to do something different this year. We're going <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> <b>it</b> up." [...] Instead of using flashbacks and flashforwards like in previous seasons, stories of the fifth season will play out both on and off the island stories in different points in time. The writers were supposedly scheduling an appearance by Furlan for the fifth season, but Furlan did not end up making an appearance. [...] However, she returns in the form of Rousseau's [...] "sideways" [...] counterpart (who never crashed on the Island, lost Alex or went insane) in the sixth season.|$|E

2500|$|Liquorice sweet – {{the plant}} was {{thought to have been}} brought over to Yorkshire by {{returning}} Crusaders or Dominican monks in the 14thcentury.

As liquorice requires deep soil to grow, it was mainly grown in Pontefract. Although it is no longer grown in the area, Pontefract has two large confectionery factories as a legacy.|$|E

[...] On December 29, 1902, the Pierce brothers played {{in what was}} billed as the first professional football game played in New York City. [...] The game, played in front of 3,500 spectators at Madison Square Garden, matched the All-Syracuse team featuring the Pierce Brothers and Glenn Warner against a local New York City team. [...] The wood flooring of the arena was pulled up, and a gridiron was laid out on dirt, with a field 70 yards long and 35 yards wide. [...] A newspaper from Syracuse credited the Pierce brothers with playing to win. Pops Warner and Bemus Pierce were credited with [...] "tearing great holes in the Gotham line." [...] And on offense, the paper wrote that [...] "Bemus Pierce hurdled like a racehorse for distance."

2500|$|The Brothers in Rhythm remix of [...] "Too Far" [...] {{received}} favourable {{reviews from}} most music critics. Charlie Porter from Amazon.co.uk was positive towards the remix, stating [...] "Brothers In Rhythm work their slinky magic on [...] "Too Far"...". Porter highlighted the song as an album stand out track. Brendan Swift from AllMusic was mixed {{in his review}} from Impossible Remixes, which the Brothers in Rhythm remix of [...] "Too Far" [...] was included on. He commented that [...] "with ten versions of four songs ("Too Far", [...] "Some Kind of Bliss", [...] "Did it Again", and [...] "Breathe"), there's {{not a lot of}} room for variation... and the repetition certainly makes for classic club fodder." [...] However, Swift acknowledge that Brothers in Rhythm, and other remix artists from the two accompanying albums, [...] "do their best <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> <b>it</b> up, and they succeed by drip-drying the pop melodies and distilling them into pure club-style mash." [...] Despite an airplay and vinyl release, the Brothers in Rhythm remix failed to appear on any record charts. No music video was directed or produced.|$|E

2500|$|With {{the album}} {{ready to be}} mixed, Yello decided to try the new digital mixing process instead of the {{standard}} analogue process, and in August 1984 they visited Hartmann Digital Studio in Nuremberg where engineer Tom Thiel began mixing the album. However, Yello abruptly cancelled the sessions after just ten days, unhappy {{with the sound of}} the album. Meier explained that the duo felt that the songs were losing their soul, saying, [...] "Getting technically more experienced was leading us onto a slick perfectionist track. We even went to a German digital studio to do the most perfect remixes on a digital machine with the SSL Desk and the rest of it. And we had to learn, a difficult process for us, that perfection is just a way to escape from having nothing to say... With Stella we were being dragged down by an excess of perfection." [...] Blank later said, [...] "All the balances were wrong and the dynamic was lost, so I did lots of remixes again in Zurich to save this album". The group returned to their studios in Zurich and Blank started the process of remixing the tracks himself, with the exception of [...] "Desert Inn" [...] which he felt was acceptable as it was, [...] "Blue Nabou" [...] which the duo had already decided would not appear on the album and hence there was no urgency to improve it, and [...] "Angel No" [...] because Blank did not have time <b>to</b> <b>mix</b> <b>it</b> to the standard that he wanted. With the delay in mixing, the album's provisional release date of 1 October 1984 could not be met, and in order to avoid being lost among the Christmas releases, a new release date in January 1985 was set.|$|E
