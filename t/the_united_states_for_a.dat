5|$|In September 1951, Oliphant {{applied for}} a visa to travel to <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> nuclear physics conference in Chicago.

A subsequent request to travel to Canada via Hawaii in September 1954 was refused by the United States Department of State. Although Oliphant was granted a special waiver that allowed him to transit the US, he preferred to cancel the trip rather than accept this humiliation. The Menzies government subsequently excluded him from participating in or observing the British nuclear tests at Maralinga, nor was he allowed access to classified nuclear information for fear of antagonising the US.|$|E
