5|$|A few early sets {{experimented with}} {{alternate}} art for cards.

5|$|The three Group 4 {{elements}} that occur naturally are titanium, zirconium and hafnium.

A police manhunt begins, and Bangs is arrested without Sara coming to harm.|$|E
5|$|Most {{developing}} countries are taking steps to develop emergency medicine as a specialty, to develop accreditation mechanisms, and to promote the development of emergency medicine training programs. Their interest {{is a result of}} improved healthcare, increasing urbanization, aging populations, the rising number of traffic fatalities, and heightened awareness of emergency medicine among their citizens. In addition, emergency medicine is useful in dealing with time-sensitive illnesses, as well as improving public health through vaccinations, interventions, training, and data collection. Countries that lack mature EMSs are developing emergency medicine as a specialty so <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> able to set up training programs and encourage medical students to pursue residencies in emergency medicine.|$|E
