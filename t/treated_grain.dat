40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{investigated}} the fumigant potential of five edible essential oils (EOs) against Sitophilus oryzae and their phytochemical residues in <b>treated</b> <b>grains.</b> Among the tested EOs, peppermint oil proved significantly effective (P ≤ 0. 05) on S. oryzae at 400 μl/L air concentration, inducing 83 and 100 % mortalities in with-food and without-food conditions respectively over 72 h exposure. In addition, {{it was also}} observed that the binary mixtures of peppermint + lemon oil (1 : 1 ratio) produced an equivalent effect to that of peppermint oil alone treatments. The phytochemical residue analysis by GC-MS revealed the presence of six compounds upon 72 h exposure to EOs.

The residue levels of eugenol were significantly elevated corresponding to its high PSA value (29) in clove and cinnamon oils.

40|$|Due to {{environmental}} concerns, health hazards to {{man and the}} evolution of resistance in insect pests, there have been constant efforts to discover newer insecticides both from natural sources and by chemical synthesis. Natural sources for novel molecules hold promise in view of their eco-friendly nature, selectivity and mammalian safety. We have isolated one natural bioactive molecule from the leaves of Lantana camara named Coumaran, based on various physical-chemical and spectroscopic techniques (IR, H- 1 NMR, C- 13 NMR and MS). Coumaran is highly toxic and very low concentration is needed for control of stored product insects. This molecule has potent grain protectant potential and caused significant reduction in F 1 progeny of all the three species in the <b>treated</b> <b>grain</b> and the progeny was completely suppressed at 30 mu g/l. The differences in germination between the control and treated grains were not significant. The lack of any adverse effect of Coumaran on the seed germination is highly desirable for a grain protectant, becoming a potential source of biofumigant for economical and environmentally friendly pest control strategies against stored grain pests during storage of grains or pulses.

Because of the cosmic abundance mixture of elements, large supersaturations in some cases and low pressures, equilibrium is not expected in astronomical clouds.
