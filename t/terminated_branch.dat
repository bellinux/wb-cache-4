40|$|AbstractInside-out {{subcellular}} vesicles of Azotobacter vinelandii {{are found}} to produce ΔpH and ΔΨ (interior acidic and positive) when oxidising malate or menadiol. These effects are inherent in both Cyd+Cyo− (lacking the o-type oxidase) and Cyd+Cyo− (lacking the bd-type oxidase) strains. They appear to be myxothiazol-sensitive in the Cyd−Cyo+ strain {{but not in the}} Cyd+Cyo− strain. The H+/e− ratio for the terminal part of respiratory chain of a bd-type oxidase overproducing strain is established as being close to 1. It is also shown that NADH oxidation by the vesicles from the Cyd−Cyo+ strain is sensitive to low concentrations of myxothiazol and antimycin A whereas that of the Cyd+Cyo− strain is resistant to these Q-cycle inhibitors. It is concluded that (i) the bd-type oxidase of A. vinelandii is competent in generating a protonic potential but its efficiency is lower than that of the o-type oxidase and (iii) Q-cycle does operate in the o-type cytochrome oxidase <b>terminated</b> <b>branch</b> of the A. vinelandii respiratory chain and does not in the bd-type quinol oxidase <b>terminated</b> <b>branch.</b> These relationships are discussed {{in the context of the}} respiratory protection function of the bd-type oxidase in A. vinelandii...|$|E

5000|$|It is {{very well}} {{demonstrated}} that chronologically successive lineages of Cantius grew progressively larger mesostyles and hypocones, eventually gaining enough distinction dentally {{to be placed in}} the genus Pelycodus. This {{is one of the best}} stratophenetic sequences in the Eocene, and is supporting evidence for gradualism in evolution. However, even though this well documented fossil sequence appears linear, it probably is an underestimation of the diversity of these genera. It is not certain which, if any, lineages Pelycodus gave rise to. Some authors have suggested that it is closely related to Notharctus, while others have argued that its size already exceeded that of primitive Notharctus and therefore was not the most parsimonious phylogeny. [...] These scientists either link Pelycodus with the poorly known Hesperolemur or place it as a <b>terminating</b> <b>branch.</b>|$|R

40|$|We have {{analysed}} {{the molecular}} basis of pseudopod extension using biochemical and biophysical approaches. We {{and others have}} determined the atomic structures of the key proteins including actin, profilin, Arp 2 / 3 complex, capping protein and ADF/cofilin {{as well as the}} rate and equilibrium constants for their interactions.

40|$|To {{directly}} {{characterize the}} bioenergetic {{properties of the}} cytochrome bd <b>terminating</b> <b>branch</b> of the Azotobacter vinelandii electron transport chain, the purified cytochrome bd oxidase was reconstituted into a phospholipid environment consisting of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol (3 : 1). The average diameter of the proteoliposomes after extrusion through a polycarbonate membrane was 94 +/- 4 nm. Initiation of respiration upon the addition of 20 microM ubiquinone- 1 to proteoliposomes loaded with the pH-sensitive dye pyranine resulted in an immediate alkalization of the vesicle lumen by an average pH change of 0. 11 unit. This pH gradient was readily collapsed upon the addition of nigericin, carbonyl cyanide p-(tri-fluoromethoxy) phenyl-hydrazone, gramicidin, Triton X- 100, or 2 -heptyl- 4 -hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO). Proteoliposomal respiration initiated {{in the presence of}} the potentiometric membrane dye rhodamine 123 caused the generation of a transmembrane potential; the potential was collapsed upon the addition of either valinomycin or HQNO. The formation of both pH and potential gradients during turnover demonstrates that the A. vinelandii cytochrome bd oxidase is coupled to energy conservation in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Temperature {{distributions}} {{resulting from}} hyperthermia treatments on isolated perfused bovine tongues {{were compared with}} simulations by a treatment planning system. The aim was to test whether the discrete vessel model used for the treatment planning is able to predict correct generic temperature distributions. Tongues were heated with the multielectrode current source interstitial hyperthermia treatment (MECS IHT) system, while the steady-state temperature distribution was mapped by scanning 10 thermocouples along paths perpendicular to the interstitial implant. For simulations a tongue was defined with generic discrete vasculature and an electrode implant analogue to the experiments. To model vascular generations not described discretely, a local heatsink was implemented {{at the end of}} each <b>terminating</b> <b>branch.</b> The discretely modelled vasculature showed itself on the temperature distributions in two ways. Individual vessels caused very local, sharp wells in the tracked temperature profiles. In the presence of large vessels a collective behaviour was also seen, i. e. a regional lowering of temperature. Both phenomena can be recognized in the experimentally obtained temperature distributions too. Predicting correct generic temperature distributions is feasible with the discrete vessel model use...|$|R

40|$|Homoclinic snaking is a {{term used}} to {{describe}} the back and forth oscillation of a branch of time-independent spatially localized states in a bistable, spatially reversible system as the localized structure grows in length by repeatedly adding rolls on either side. On the real line this process continues forever. In finite domains snaking terminates once the domain is filled but the details of how this occurs depend critically on the choice of boundary conditions. With periodic boundary conditions the snaking <b>branches</b> <b>terminate</b> on a <b>branch</b> of spatially periodic states. However, with non-Neumann boundary conditions they turn continuously into a large amplitude filling state that replaces the periodic state. This behavior, shown here in detail for the Swift-Hohenberg equation, explains the phenomenon of “snaking without bistability”, recently observed in simulations of binary fluid convection by Mercader, Batiste, Alonso and Knobloch (preprint) ...|$|R

40|$|Targeting {{respiration}} and ATP synthesis {{has received}} strong interest {{as a new}} strategy for combatting drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Mycobacteria employ a respiratory chain <b>terminating</b> with two <b>branches.</b> One of the branches includes a cytochrome bc 1 complex and an aa 3 -type cytochrome c oxidase while the other <b>branch</b> <b>terminates</b> with a cytochrome bd-type quinol oxidase. In this communication we show that genetic inactivation of cytochrome bd, but not of cytochrome bc 1, enhances the susceptibility of Mycobacterium smegmatis to hydrogen peroxide and antibiotic-induced stress. The type-II NADH dehydrogenase effector clofazimine and the ATP synthase inhibitor bedaquiline were bacteriostatic against wild-type M. smegmatis, but strongly bactericidal against a cytochrome bd mutant. We also demonstrated that the quinone-analog aurachin D inhibited mycobacterial cytochrome bd at sub-micromolar concentrations. Our results identify cytochrome bd as a key survival factor in M. smegmatis during antibiotic stress. Targeting the cytochrome bd respiratory branch therefore {{appears to be a}} promising strategy that may enhance the bactericidal activity of existing tuberculosis drugs...|$|R
