The committee, consisting of {{the director of the}} Finnish Maritime Administration, Svante Sundman, and two experienced Finnish shipbuilders, K.

The main dimensions of the new 4,415-ton icebreaker, large enough to escort 10,000-ton dry cargo ships or 16,000-ton tankers, were based on the old Jääkarhu, but the triple-expansion steam engines were replaced with a modern diesel-electric propulsion system, similar to the 1939-built Sisu, with a combined output of 10,500 shp. In the early drafts, the new icebreaker was designed with three propellers (two in the stern and one in the bow) and an asymmetric stem that would compensate for the <b>transverse</b> <b>force</b> caused by the bow propeller. However, these features were later dropped after extensive model testing and co-operation with Swedish naval architects in favor of a completely new design.|$|E
25|$|Finnpusku uses {{a unique}} rigid {{coupling}} system, Wärtsilä Marine Locomotive, {{which consists of}} two hydraulic locking pins, {{one on each side}} of the pusher, and one fixed pin in the bow. When connected, the hydraulic pins exert a <b>transverse</b> <b>force</b> of 450 tons to the sockets, forcing the jaws of the barge apart by , and the angled faces of the coupling pins push the pusher forwards, resulting in a longitudinal force, also of 450 tons, at the bow pin. The three-point connection removes all degrees of freedom and results in the combination behaving hydrodynamically like a single ship, allowing unrestricted service and independent operation in the severe ice conditions of the Gulf of Bothnia. The pusher can be connected to the barge at three different levels, removing the need to ballast the barge to the same draught as the pusher when not carrying cargo. In addition to mechanical coupling the pusher is connected to the barge by several electrical cables on the starboard side and flexible pipes on the port side. The latter allow the pusher's fuel and freshwater tanks to be topped up from the much larger storage tanks of the barge.|$|E

Theoretically {{it would}} seem that, {{at the moment of}} {{discharge}} by the spark in one line of inductive force, not merely would all the other lines throw their forces into this one (1406.), but the lateral effect, equivalent to a repulsion of these lines (1224. 1297.), would be relieved and, perhaps, followed by a contrary action, amounting to a collapse or attraction of these parts. Having long sought for some <b>transverse</b> <b>force</b> in statical electricity, which should be the equivalent to magnetism or the <b>transverse</b> <b>force</b> of current electricity, and conceiving that it might be connected with the transverse action of the lines of inductive force, already described (1297.), I was desirous, by various experiments, of bringing out the effect of such a force, and making it tell upon the phenomena of electro-magnetism and magneto-electricity[A].|$|E
6000|$|... 1659. According to the {{beautiful}} theory of Ampère, the <b>transverse</b> <b>force</b> of a current may {{be represented by}} its attraction for a similar current and its repulsion of a contrary current. May not then the equivalent <b>transverse</b> <b>force</b> of static electricity be represented by that lateral tension or repulsion which the lines of inductive action appear to possess (1304.)? Then again, when current or discharge occurs between two bodies, previously under inductrical relations to each other, the lines of inductive force will weaken and fade away, and, as their lateral repulsive tension diminishes, will contract and ultimately disappear {{in the line of}} discharge. May not this be an effect identical with the attractions of similar currents? i.e. may not the passage of static electricity into current electricity, and that of the lateral tension of the lines of inductive force into the lateral attraction of lines of similar discharge, have the same relation and dependences, and run parallel to each other? ...|$|E

The direct {{inductive}} force, {{which may}} be conceived to be exerted in lines between the two limiting and charged conducting surfaces, {{is accompanied by a}} lateral or <b>transverse</b> <b>force</b> equivalent to a dilatation or repulsion of these representative lines (1224.); or the attractive force which exists amongst the particles of the dielectric {{in the direction of the}} induction is accompanied by a repulsive or a diverging force in the transverse direction (1304.).|$|E

40|$|As {{the search}} for oil in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) moves into deeper waters, {{floating}} platforms such as semisubmersibles are in increasing demand. As semi-submersibles increase in size, the effect of vortex-induced motions (VIMs) becomes a significant problem in their design. VIMs stem from <b>transverse</b> <b>forces</b> caused by the current affecting the platform, with vortexes moving downstream {{on either side of}} the structure. The loop/eddy current phenomenon in the GoM leads to a constant current being present in the area, with speeds of up to 1. 8 m/s. The accurate prediction of the vertical and transverse motions of semi-submersibles is crucial for the design of the riser systems. It is therefore beneficial to investigate the hydrodynamic forces acting on the geometry, and means of reducing these forces. A common method of reducing <b>transverse</b> <b>forces</b> is the addition of column appendages, such as helical strakes. In this paper, full-scale computational fluid dynamic analyses are carried out to examine the <b>transverse</b> <b>forces</b> caused by this vortex shedding using realistic current velocities in the GoM. Helical strakes are attached to the geometry to break up the coherence of the vortex shedding and the performance of these strakes is investigated numerically...|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{describes}} a method which, {{based on the}} laminate theory in accordance with Whitney/Pagano, furnishes improved transverse normal stresses. For this purpose, starting from the force equilibriums, a relation is derived between transverse shear stresses and <b>transverse</b> <b>forces.</b> The resulting functional matrix contains on its elements terms which are quadratic in z. This approach has two essential advantages over determining the <b>transverse</b> shear <b>forces</b> from the <b>transverse</b> shear distortions. On one hand, one obtains steady profiles of the transverse shear stresses over the laminate thickness. On the other hand, now {{it is also possible}} to calculate the transverse normal stress. For this purpose, the <b>transverse</b> <b>forces</b> must be derived to x and y. The above functional matrix is integrated over z. The execution of these steps comprised two essential points. First, the derivations of <b>transverse</b> <b>forces</b> had to be provided by the B 2000 finite element program. This meant that the corresponding B 2000 subroutine had to be extended to the calculation of the second derivatives of the interpolation functions. Subsequently, the SPANNUNG. FOR program developed at the Institute for Structural Mechanics of the German Aerospace Research Establishment (DLR), Braunschweig, was extended by the integration of the functional matrix in thickness direction and by the calculation of the transverse normal stress. The efficiency of this method was tested in a number of example calculations. (orig.)

An electrified cylinder is more affected by the {{influence of}} the surrounding conductors (which complete the condition of charge) at the ends than at the middle, because the ends are exposed to a greater sum of inductive forces than the middle; and a point is brought to a higher condition than a ball, because by relation to the conductors around, more inductive force terminates on its surface than on an equal surface of the ball with which it is compared. Here too, especially, can be perceived {{the influence of the}} lateral or <b>transverse</b> <b>force</b> (1297.), which, being a power of the nature of or equivalent to repulsion, causes such a disposition of the lines of inductive force in their course across the dielectric, that they must accumulate upon the point, the end of the cylinder, or any projecting part.|$|E
6000|$|... 1731. If {{the lateral}} or <b>transverse</b> <b>force</b> of {{electrical}} currents, or {{what appears to}} be the same thing, magnetic power, could be proved to be influential at a distance independently of the intervening contiguous particles, then, as it appears to me, a real distinction of a high and important kind, would be established between the natures of these two forces (1654. 1664.). I do not mean that the powers are independent of each other and might be rendered separately active, on the contrary they are probably essentially associated (1654.), but it by no means follows that they are of the same nature. In common statical induction, in conduction, and in electrolyzation, the forces at the opposite extremities of the particles which coincide with the lines of action and have commonly been distinguished by the term electric, are polar, and in the cases of contiguous particles act only to insensible distances; whilst those which are transverse to the direction of these lines, and are called magnetic, are circumferential, act at a distance, and if not through the mediation of the intervening particles, have their relations to ordinary matter entirely unlike those of the electrical forces with which they are associated.|$|E
6000|$|... 1304. I {{have used}} the phrases lines of {{inductive}} force and curved lines of force (1231. 1297. 1298. 1302.) in a general sense only, just as we speak of the lines of magnetic force. The lines are imaginary, and the force {{in any part of}} them is of course the resultant of compound forces, every molecule being related to every other molecule in all directions by the tension and reaction of those which are contiguous. The <b>transverse</b> <b>force</b> is merely this relation considered in a direction oblique to the lines of inductive force, and at present I mean no more than that by the phrase. With respect to the term polarity also, I mean at present only a disposition of force by which the same molecule acquires opposite powers on different parts. The particular way in which this disposition is made will come into consideration hereafter, and probably varies in different bodies, and so produces variety of electrical relation[A]. All I am anxious about at present is, that a more particular meaning should not be attached to the expressions used than I contemplate. Further inquiry, I trust, will enable us by degrees to restrict the sense more and more, and so render the explanation of electrical phenomena day by day more and more definite.|$|E
