5|$|I {{read this}} book, and I was totally stunned. At <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> was pretty upset with myself that I didn't know this book. I live in Amsterdam where Anne Frank is a {{national}} hero, and for me this book read like Anne Frank's diary but written 97 years before– a firsthand account of slavery. I basically made it my passion to make this book into a film.|$|E
5|$|I. orientalis, {{described}} by A. K. Rozhdestvensky in 1952, {{was based on}} poor material, but a skull with a distinctive arched snout that {{had been assigned to}} it was renamed Altirhinus kurzanovi in 1998. At <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I.</b> orientalis was considered to be a nomen dubium because it cannot be compared to I. bernissartensis.|$|E
25|$|I am {{honored to}} receive this award (the Distinguished Service Medal) today but at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> am saddened {{to be leaving}} active {{military}} service. The Army has been my life and I am proud of each of my twenty-five years of service.|$|E

25|$|I see and {{understand}} both the symbolic {{as well as}} the substantive elements of my life. Sometimes I visualise it as a journey of an individual from a remote village on the sidelines of society to the hub of social standing. But at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> also realise that my life encapsulates the ability of the democratic system to accommodate and empower marginalised sections of society.|$|E
25|$|In a {{subsequent}} article for The New York Review of Books, Soros emphasized thatI do not {{subscribe to the}} myths propagated by enemies of Israel and I am not blaming Jews for anti-Semitism. Anti-Semitism predates the birth of Israel. Neither Israel's policies nor the critics of those policies should {{be held responsible for}} anti-Semitism. At <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> do believe that attitudes toward Israel are influenced by Israel's policies, and attitudes toward the Jewish community are influenced by the pro-Israel lobby's success in suppressing divergent views.|$|E
25|$|The {{desirability}} of hiring directors over 60 is fairly diminished in this marketplace. At <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> hadn't had a good-sized hit {{in quite a}} while. And, frankly, I went {{through a couple of}} experiences that left me pretty disgusted with it all, and I was thinking the time had passed. I was just sitting at home reading magazines and looking out the window — a couple of projects I had had just fallen apart — when I got a call from Sly, who had sent me a script.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, you may, Mr Rubb. But {{you must}} tell them at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> that <b>I</b> am quite happy, and that Aunt Margaret is the dearest {{woman in the}} world." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'It {{is getting}} late, and I {{must be going}} home to my children,' he said, at length, 'but if you are here at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> to-morrow <b>I</b> will give you another treat.' ...|$|R
25|$|In {{the whole}} of the ten years I have been working on radio and television, I have been working to a {{majority}} of women. I think women prefer men to be well-mannered, so I always try to watch my manners. They like men to be well dressed, so I do my best to observe this. Others bring to my notice the fact that I sometimes make grammatical errors in my speech; so, because of this, I try to watch my grammar – but at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> bear in mind that it's more profitable for me to be entertaining than to be perfect in my use of English.|$|E
25|$|I {{think in}} casual {{conversation}} I {{would have told}} anybody I wanted to direct. At <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> knew Hollywood was a closed off place... It was much harder to get in. To be an older director was a very positive thing. It meant you had survived, knew your way, could make things and make them meet your economic responsibilities. It was always paramount in studio minds, especially in those days... If I was going to direct I was going to write my way in. No TV, no play, I was simply somebody who said I have a sensibility, I think I can do this, based on nothing other than my scripts basically.|$|E
25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah, yes! I {{know them}} well enough!" [...] {{the old man}} murmured. [...] "Its myself I'm most anxious about. And perhaps you'll {{be good enough to}} mention, at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> how <b>I</b> got here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> sir, <b>I</b> {{think that}} if Mr. Dryfoos felt a {{personal}} censure in Mr. Lindau's questions concerning his suppression of the strike among his workmen, he {{had a right to}} resent it." ...|$|R
500|$|Of {{this range}} Rimsky-Korsakov wrote in 1902, [...] "In every new work of mine I {{am trying to}} do {{something}} that is new for me. On the one hand, I am pushed on by the thought that in this way, [...] will retain freshness and interest, but at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> am prompted by my pride to think that many facets, devices, moods and styles, if not all, should be within my reach." ...|$|E
500|$|After a 49–9 {{victory over}} Texas A on November 27, 2008, McCoy {{said that he}} still {{intended}} {{to come back for}} his senior year, but that it would be [...] "foolish" [...] for him not to ask the NFL to evaluate his draft prospects. McCoy said that if he were rated a first- or second-round draft pick, he might change his mind about staying. McCoy said, [...] "But at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> want to play four years here. Not very many people {{have had the opportunity to}} do that. That's something that's real special to me and important to me." ...|$|E
500|$|Washington, {{frustrated}} at {{not being able}} to confront Howe in a more decisive action, wrote in his report to Henry Laurens, president of Congress, [...] "I sincerely wish, that they had made an Attack; the Issue in all probability, from the disposition of our Troops and the strong situation of our Camp, would have been fortunate and happy. At <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> must add that reason, prudence, and every principle of policy, forbade us quitting our post to attack them. Nothing but Success would have justified the measure, and this could not be expected from their position." ...|$|E
60|$|Now, then, I {{hope the}} wound is healed. I {{am willing to}} {{relinquish}} the portrait, and compromise on the Chair. At <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> if <b>I</b> were going to worship either, I should not choose the Chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you can't {{understand}} {{everything all}} at once," [...] Ralph answered. [...] "At <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> if <b>I</b> were you, I would try {{and see if}} the hint I have given you fits in {{with the rest of the}} puzzle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had some}} {{business}} with you, my good friend," [...] said the Colonel, addressing the Mayor; [...] "I shall be glad {{if it should}} so happen at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> that <b>I</b> may find occasion to pleasure you or your worthy pastor." ...|$|R
500|$|... "The {{whole time}} I {{definitely}} was thinking, 'Everyone knows, everyone can see.'...I {{just wanted to}} give everything I could... When you're pregnant, it's {{a little bit harder}} to breathe, so it was hard doing all the choreography and singing at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time.</b> <b>I</b> just got my strength from all the love from the fans. I can see all of my super fans in the audience when I'm performing because they're doing the choreography harder than me. Some of the fans were like, 'B, you better put me in this DVD.' So I made sure I did." ...|$|E
500|$|Five {{months after}} the Olympic session, with the Beatles having now broken up, [...] "My Sweet Lord" [...] was one of 30 or more tracks that Harrison {{recorded}} for his All Things Must Pass triple album. It was a song he had been reluctant to record, for fear of committing himself publicly to such an overt religious message. [...] "I was sticking my neck out on the chopping block because now I would have {{to live up to}} something," [...] Harrison explained in I Me Mine, [...] "but at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> thought 'Nobody's saying it; I wish somebody else was doing it.'" ...|$|E
500|$|He {{also makes}} a cameo {{appearance}} in the 2008 Silent Hill comic book Sinner's Reward, published by IDW Publishing. The writer, Tom Waltz, later said he regretted the cameo, which only functioned as fan service. To him, Pyramid Head is a psychological construct created for James; however, he stated that: [...] "At <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> don't think that ruined the comic. Some people really liked it. To some people, Pyramid Head should be in all the stories because they do like him." [...] Additionally, the character was portrayed from October 2 to 31, 2009, in the haunted attraction Sinister Pointe, based on Silent Hill, in Orange County, California, United States.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I haven't that's no sign I can't. I reckon I {{know enough}} 'bout the {{business}} to handle two cases at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> if <b>I</b> want to, an' you'll see if I don't pull Jip Collins over the coals before I'm a week older." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Everything that is, is not. Everything is, yet at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> nothing is. <b>I</b> myself am the emptiest of all." ...|$|R
60|$|The Bone of Contention {{was badly}} troubled. He had {{undoubtedly}} known {{what it was}} to have two women quarrelling over his hand at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> but <b>I</b> am willing to bet that the sensation of having them come together in his presence was new to him.|$|R
500|$|In September 2015, Tancharoen {{stated the}} overall {{theme for the}} season {{explored}} with each character was them [...] "trying {{to get back in}} touch with their humanity in a world where Inhumans are popping up," [...] with Whedon adding that the nature of couples–some having broken up in previous episodes, some getting back together, and potential for new ones–would be explored. Later that month, Bell talked about some of the new character pairings in the season, saying [...] "Putting Mack and Daisy together; putting Hunter and May together; putting Bobbi and Fitz together—suddenly you have all these different dynamics, all these different stories that you didn't have before." [...] Tancharoen later highlighted the number of characters in the season compared to previous, stating that [...] "There's more scale and scope, but at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> think we're diving into each character's internal struggle a little bit more." ...|$|E
500|$|Tabloid {{criticism}} of Islam4UK and Choudary since {{news of the}} proposed march first became public has, generally, been vitriolic, calling him a [...] "hate preacher". In January 2010, appearing on the BBC's The Daily Politics, he was asked by its presenter, Andrew Neil, for his opinions on the banning of Islam4UK, before being asked to comment on his financial status, claiming that it was [...] "relevant to our viewers". [...] Choudary told Neil that his finances were a personal matter, {{and that he was}} [...] "doing something, and I don't want to discuss that with you. [...] I'm not on Jobseeker's allowance, but at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time</b> <b>I</b> have family allowance, I have very firmly held views which I'm propagating at the same time." [...] Responding to the media's {{criticism of}} him, Choudary said [...] "I do believe that people have been whipped up into an anti-Islam anti-Muslim frenzy." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Battle of the Bastards" [...] {{was also}} the last episode for {{recurring}} character Rickon Stark (Art Parkinson), who had appeared since the series premiere episode [...] "Winter Is Coming". In an IGN interview, Parkinson {{said that he was}} tipped off about his character's death: [...] "Whenever I was told that I was coming back for Season 6, before they sent me through the scripts and stuff, they sent me through a ring just to say, 'Listen, so that you don't get a shock whenever you read the scripts, just know that you die this season. He continued, [...] "Whenever I came back, I was excited to come back, and the scenes all seemed pretty amazing. I was so happy to re-embrace the character." [...] According to Parkinson, he was sorry that Rickon would die but his manner of death was a compensation: [...] "It was a cool death, and it was {{always going to be a}} good death, so at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> <b>I</b> was pretty happy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very good, sir," [...] he said. [...] "I'll {{attend to}} it. At <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time,</b> if <b>I</b> {{might make the}} suggestion, I should {{take a couple of}} plain-clothes policemen with me. It's a pretty low part where you are going, and one hears of queer doings, nowadays." ...|$|R
60|$|The torch {{had been}} {{stuck in a}} socket beside the door, so that its rays {{illuminated}} both the corridor and the cell at <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>time.</b> As <b>I</b> saw <b>the</b> two warriors disappear I approached {{the entrance to the}} cell, with a well-defined plan already formulated.|$|R
3000|$|... “Exactly, I am {{not that}} kind of/for example Chris is {{accessible}} for this, he is the bootcamp kind of guy, being yelled at and so on.
