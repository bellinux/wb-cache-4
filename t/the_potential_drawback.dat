40|$|We {{present the}} theory and {{numerical}} results for least‐squares reverse time migration (LSRTM) of phase‐encoded supergathers, where each supergather is the superposition of phased‐encoded shots. Three type of encoding functions are used in this study: random time shift, random source polarity and random source location selected from a pre‐designed table. Numerical tests for the 3 D SEG/EAGE Overthrust model show that multi‐source LSRTM can suppress migration artifacts in the migration image and remove most of the crosstalk noise from multi‐source data. Empirical results suggest that multi‐source LSRTM can provide a noticeable increase in computational efficiency compared to standard RTM, when the CSGs in a supergather are modeled and migrated together with a finite‐difference simulator. If the phase‐encoding functions are dynamically changed after each iteration of LSRTM, the best images are obtained. <b>The</b> <b>potential</b> <b>drawback</b> is that the final results {{are very sensitive to}} the accuracy of the starting model...|$|E

40|$|Balancing {{treatment}} allocation for influential covariates {{is critical}} in clinical trials. This has become increasingly important {{as more and more}} biomarkers are found to be associated with different diseases in translational research (genomics, proteomics and metabolomics). Stratified permuted block randomization and minimization methods [Pocock and Simon Biometrics 31 (1975) 103 - 115, etc. ] are the two most popular approaches in practice. However, stratified permuted block randomization fails to achieve good overall balance when the number of strata is large, whereas traditional minimization methods also suffer from <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>drawback</b> of large within-stratum imbalances. Moreover, the theoretical bases of minimization methods remain largely elusive. In this paper, we propose a new covariate-adaptive design that is able to control various types of imbalances. We show that the joint process of within-stratum imbalances is a positive recurrent Markov chain under certain conditions. Therefore, this new procedure yields more balanced allocation. The advantages of the proposed procedure are also demonstrated by extensive simulation studies. Our work provides a theoretical tool for future research in this area.

Sarkar and Pawlikowski (2001) investigated the delay versus throughout characteristics and fairness performance of pi -persistent protocol, including the 1 -persistent protocol. The main advantage of 1 -persistent protocol over the pi -persistent protocol is the reduced mean packet delay (network-wide and also for individual stations), but <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>drawback</b> of this protocol {{is the lack of}} fairness.

40|$|Isoniazid (INH) {{resistance}} is most frequent among drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates. This {{study was conducted}} to investigate whether INH could induce its own resistance. During INH susceptibility testing in BACTEC 12 B and MGIT 960 media, weekly subcultures were made from the drug-containing media into fresh medium without drug and susceptibility testing was performed. Rifampin (RIF) was used as a control drug. M. tuberculosis H 37 Rv and three clinical isolates were tested in this study. INH-resistant subcultures were analyzed for catalase activity, INH susceptibility, and mutations associated with INH resistance. With inoculum size (104 bacilli) smaller than a size that contains spontaneously INH-resistant mutants, INH was found to induce resistance to itself in INH-tolerant persisters but not to other drugs. The minimum time required for induction of INH resistance was 5 to 6 days. In contrast, RIF did not induce RIF resistance. Eight subcultures with INH-induced resistance were analyzed, and two had a MIC of 0. 4 μg/ml INH and six had MICs of over 2 μg/ml INH. Four of the eight subcultures with INH-induced resistance had lost catalase activity, with three having katG mutations. Despite being a powerful frontline tuberculosis drug, INH has <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>drawback</b> of inducing its own stable genetic resistance in INH-tolerant persisters.

40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} {{the risks of}} ureteral damage occurring during urological and gynecological procedures utilizing energybased surgical devices (ESD) during both laparoscopic and open procedures. Materials and Methods: During the last 20 months we observed five cases of iatrogenic ureteral lesions caused by ESD which required open surgery. There were 3 lesions of the lower ureter occurring during gynecological laparoscopic or robotic procedures, and 2 lesions of the upper ureter occurring during open enucleation of low-stage renal cell carcinomas. Results: In the laparoscopic gynecological lesions the cause was attributable to monopolar cutting and bipolar coagulation: they presented with urine extravasation after 20, 15 and 15 days respectively and required ureteral reimplantation in 2 out of 3 cases. In the upper ureteral lesions the causes were bipolar coagulation and LigaSure Impact TM used for perirenal fat dissection: they presented after 2 and 4 months respectively and required uretero-ureterostomy and inferior nephropexy in one case and nephrectomy in the other. In 3 out of 5 cases there was an unsuccessful attempt at placing an ureteral double J stent, and in the 2 cases where it was placed it did not prevent the formation of subsequent stricture in one. Conclusions: The widespread diffusion of ESD has <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>drawback</b> of inadvertent thermal energy transmission to the ureter.
