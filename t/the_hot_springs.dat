5|$|Throughout its history, Banff National Park {{has been}} shaped by tension between {{conservationist}} and land exploitation interests. The park was established on 25 November 1885 as Banff Hot Springs Reserve, in response to conflicting claims over who discovered hot springs there and who {{had the right to}} develop <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>springs</b> for commercial interests. The conservationists prevailed when Prime Minister John A. Macdonald set aside <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>springs</b> as a small protected reserve, which was later expanded to include Lake Louise and other areas extending north to the Columbia Icefield.|$|E
5|$|Emanations of {{hydrogen}} sulfide {{have been reported}} around the volcano, preventing the mining of underground sulfur deposits, and the gas is also present in <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>springs.</b> The confirmed presence of sulfur dioxide would indicate hot magma beneath the volcano.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spring</b> was {{originally}} named <b>the</b> Ueshima <b>Hot</b> <b>Spring</b> during <b>the</b> Japanese rule of Taiwan. After the handover of Taiwan from Japan to the Republic of China in 1945, it was renamed to Hu Mountain <b>Hot</b> <b>Spring.</b> In 1978, President Chiang Ching-kuo visited <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spring</b> and renamed it as Tai'an <b>Hot</b> <b>Spring.</b>|$|R
50|$|According to tradition, <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spring</b> was {{discovered}} by Ennin in 876, during the Heian period. <b>The</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spring</b> was first used for steaming (mushi) hemp (Cannabis or asa), leading to the name, though the kanji character used for the name differs. When Hōnen visited in 1190, he popularized the custom of bathing in <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spring.</b>|$|R
5|$|Bath {{was charged}} with {{responsibility}} for <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>springs</b> in a Royal Charter of 1591 granted by Elizabeth I.

The thermal waters contain sodium, calcium, chloride and sulphate ions in high concentrations.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>hot</b> <b>springs</b> {{along the}} Chikuma River for example from {{tourists}} {{into the upper}} reaches of the river. The high rate of snow in the mountains surrounding both the Chikuma and Shinano Rivers make them attractive places for snow sports with a number of ski resorts scattered throughout the mountains. The 1998 Winter Olympics, which were held in Nagano, indicate the large number of locations for snow sports in the area.|$|E
5|$|Following its sale {{at auction}} {{following}} foreclosure, the Bowers Mansion was abandoned. Eventually purchased by Reno saloon owner Henry Riter, it was renovated and reopened as a resort in 1903. <b>The</b> <b>hot</b> <b>springs</b> were remodeled to feed warm swimming pools, and a spur was built from the Virginia and Truckee Railroad {{to serve the}} property. It continued to operate as a resort until 1946.

5|$|A 2008 genetic {{study showed}} {{that some of the}} woolly mammoths that entered North America through the Bering land bridge from Asia {{migrated}} back about 300,000 years ago and had replaced the previous Asian population by about 40,000 years ago, not long before the entire species became extinct. Fossils of woolly mammoths and Columbian mammoths have been found together in a few localities of North America, including <b>the</b> <b>Hot</b> <b>Springs</b> sinkhole of South Dakota where their regions overlapped. It is unknown whether the two species were sympatric and lived there simultaneously, or if the woolly mammoths may have entered these southern areas during times when Columbian mammoth populations were absent there.|$|E
5|$|For centuries, {{the people}} of Iceland have used their hot springs for bathing and washing clothes. The first use of {{geothermal}} energy for heating did not come until 1907 when a farmer ran a concrete pipe from a hot spring that led steam into his house. In 1930, the first pipeline was constructed in Reykjavík, and was used to heat two schools, 60 homes, and the main hospital. It was a 3km pipeline that ran from one of <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>springs</b> outside the city. In 1943, the first district heating company was started {{with the use of}} geothermal power. An 18km pipeline ran through the city of Reykjavík and by 1945 it was connected to over 2,850 homes.|$|E
50|$|Many people {{traveled}} to enjoy recreation on the lake, however, another major draw was <b>the</b> natural <b>hot</b> <b>spring.</b> Emile Jesserun bought 40 acre {{of land that}} included <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>spring</b> and built <b>the</b> first major resort in Big Bear, <b>the</b> Pan <b>Hot</b> <b>Springs</b> Hotel, in 1921.|$|R

5|$|Hot springs {{have been}} used for bathing at least since Paleolithic times. The oldest known spa is a stone pool on China's Lisan {{mountain}} built in the Qin Dynasty in the 3rd century BC, at the same site where the Huaqing Chi palace was later built. In the first century AD, Romans conquered Aquae Sulis, now Bath, Somerset, England, and used <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>springs</b> there to feed public baths and underfloor heating. The admission fees for these baths probably represent the first commercial use of geothermal power. The world's oldest geothermal district heating system in Chaudes-Aigues, France, has been operating since the 14th century. The earliest industrial exploitation began in 1827 with the use of geyser steam to extract boric acid from volcanic mud in Larderello, Italy.|$|E
5|$|It {{is often}} claimed {{that at the}} time, the pass of Thermopylae {{consisted}} of a track along {{the shore of the}} Malian Gulf so narrow that only one chariot could pass through at a time. In fact, as noted below, the pass was 100 metres wide, probably wider than the Greeks could have held against the Persian hordes. Herodotus reports that the Phocians had improved the defenses of the pass by channelling the stream from <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>springs</b> to create a marsh, and it was a causeway across this marsh which was only wide enough for a single chariot to traverse. In a later passage, describing a Gaulish attempt to force the pass, Herodotus describes how the Gauls who fell into the marsh disappeared and were drowned.|$|E
5|$|The Columbian mammoth shared its habitat {{with other}} now-extinct Pleistocene mammals (such as Glyptodon, Smilodon, ground sloths, Camelops and the American mastodon), horses and buffalos. It {{did not live}} in Arctic Canada, which was {{inhabited}} by woolly mammoths. Fossils of woolly and Columbian mammoths {{have been found in}} the same place in a few areas of North America where their ranges overlapped, including <b>the</b> <b>Hot</b> <b>Springs</b> Site. It is unknown whether the two species were sympatric and lived there simultaneously, or if the woolly mammoths entered southern areas when Columbian mammoth populations were absent. The Columbian mammoth coexisted with the other extinct proboscideans Stegomastodon mirificus and Cuvieronius tropicus at sites in Texas and New Mexico during the early Irvingtonian.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} tests {{conducted}} by the PSB Corporation and SGS Testing & Control Services found the spring water contains 420mg of chloride per litre, an amount which is substantially higher than the 35 to 100mg in the water from Choa Chu Kang and Bedok waterworks. It was {{also found that the}} sulphide content is three times more than tap water and the spring water is also slightly alkaline due to the presence of minerals. Natural spring waters may have health benefits, similar to <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>springs</b> of other countries near tectonic plates with volcanoes, in a search for cures for some skin conditions, as well as debilitating ailments like rheumatism and arthritis. Although local rheumatologists conceded that hydrotherapy is an accepted treatment that can be helpful for mild forms of rheumatism or muscle strain, they, along with dermatologists, remain skeptical of claims about the alternative healing of the natural spring water.|$|E
5|$|Borax, its mineral form {{then known}} as tincal, glazes were used in China from AD 300, and some crude borax reached the West, where the Persian alchemist Jābir ibn Hayyān {{apparently}} mentioned it in AD 700. Marco Polo brought some glazes back to Italy in the 13th century. Agricola, around 1600, reports the use of borax as a flux in metallurgy. In 1777, boric acid was recognized in <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>springs</b> (soffioni) near Florence, Italy, and became known as sal sedativum, with primarily medical uses. The rare mineral is called sassolite, which is found at Sasso, Italy. Sasso was {{the main source of}} European borax from 1827 to 1872, when American sources replaced it. Boron compounds were relatively rarely used until the late 1800s when Francis Marion Smith's Pacific Coast Borax Company first popularized and produced them in volume at low cost.|$|E
5|$|The baths {{have been}} {{modified}} on several occasions, including the 12th century, when John of Tours built a curative bath over the King's Spring reservoir, and the 16th century, {{when the city}} corporation built a new bath (Queen's Bath) {{to the south of}} the spring. The spring is now housed in 18th-century buildings, designed by architects John Wood, the Elder and John Wood, the Younger, father and son. Visitors drank the waters in the Grand Pump Room, a neo-classical salon which remains in use, both for taking the waters and for social functions. Victorian expansion of the baths complex followed the neo-classical tradition established by the Woods. In 1810 <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>springs</b> failed and William Smith opened up the Hot Bath Spring to the bottom, where he found that the spring had not failed but had flowed into a new channel. Smith restored the water to its original course and the baths filled in less time than before.|$|E

5|$|William Rufus {{granted the}} town, abbey and mint to a royal physician, John of Tours, who became Bishop of Wells and Abbot of Bath, {{following}} the sacking {{of the town}} during the Rebellion of 1088. It was papal policy for bishops to move to more urban seats, and John of Tours translated his own from Wells to Bath. The bishop planned and began a much larger church as his cathedral, to which was attached a priory, with the bishop's palace beside it. New baths were built around the three springs. Later bishops returned the episcopal seat to Wells while retaining the name Bath in the title, Bishop of Bath and Wells. St John's Hospital was founded around 1180 by Bishop Reginald Fitz Jocelin and is among the oldest almshouses in England. The 'hospital of the baths' was built beside <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>springs</b> of the Cross Bath, for their health-giving properties and to provide shelter for the poor infirm.|$|E
5|$|A {{victory against}} Los Angeles in the twelfth {{week of the}} season {{preserved}} Cleveland's undefeated record. The Dons began the scoring in the first quarter with a 75-yard drive engineered by quarterback Glenn Dobbs. The series ended with a short touchdown run by halfback Walt Clay. The Browns came back to tie the game in the second quarter after a 71-yard drive that features several completions from Graham to Lavelli. Lavelli caught a 49-yard pass from Graham for the score. On the next possession, Los Angeles converted a fourth down deep in their own territory, extending a long drive that ended with another touchdown by Clay. Cleveland again evened the score with under two minutes left in the first half on a touchdown pass to Edgar Jones. The Browns pulled away in the third quarter, when Graham ran a quarterback sneak for a touchdown. Groza later kicked a 36-yard field goal, and an interception by Cliff Lewis set up a run by Tony Adamle for a final touchdown. The final score was 31–14. Graham twisted his knee in the fourth quarter, and Edgar Jones, Parseghian and Bob Gaudio also had injuries. The Browns planned to stay at <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>springs</b> in Boyes, California to recover as they prepared to face the 49ers for a second time in San Francisco three days later.|$|E
