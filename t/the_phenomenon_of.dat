5|$|Another area of {{interest}} for Rubin was <b>the</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> counter-rotation in galaxies. Her discovery that some gas and stars moved {{in the opposite direction}} to the rotation {{of the rest of the}} galaxy challenged the prevailing theory that all of the material in a galaxy moved in the same direction, and provided the first evidence for galaxy mergers and the process by which galaxies initially formed.|$|E

5|$|In 1874, Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff and Joseph Achille Le Bel {{independently}} {{proposed that}} <b>the</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> optical activity {{could be explained}} by assuming that the chemical bonds between carbon atoms and their neighbors were directed towards the corners of a regular tetrahedron.

5|$|In {{everyday}} life, {{there are}} three familiar dimensions of space: height, width and depth. Einstein's {{general theory of relativity}} treats time as a dimension on par with the three spatial dimensions; in general relativity, space and time are not modeled as separate entities but are instead unified to a four-dimensional spacetime, three spatial dimensions and one time dimension. In this framework, <b>the</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> gravity is viewed {{as a consequence of the}} geometry of spacetime.|$|E

5|$|The {{cohesive}} forces among liquid molecules {{are responsible}} for <b>the</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> surface tension. In {{the bulk of the}} liquid, each molecule is pulled equally in every direction by neighboring liquid molecules, resulting in a net force of zero. The molecules at the surface {{do not have the same}} molecules on all sides of them and therefore are pulled inwards. This creates some internal pressure and forces liquid surfaces to contract to the minimal area.|$|E

5|$|Although {{scientists}} began observing reduced {{populations of}} several European amphibian species {{already in the}} 1950s, awareness of the phenomenon as a global problem and its subsequent classification as a modern-day mass extinction only dates from the 1980s. By 1993, more than 500 species of frogs and salamanders present on all five continents were in decline. Today, <b>the</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> declining amphibian populations affects thousands of species in all types of ecosystems and is thus {{recognized as one of}} the most severe examples of the Holocene extinction, with severe implications for global biodiversity.|$|E
5|$|As {{noted by}} Copernicus himself, {{the notion that}} the Earth rotates is very old, dating at least to Philolaus (c. 450 BC), Heraclides Ponticus (c. 350 BC) and Ecphantus the Pythagorean. Roughly a century before Copernicus, the Christian scholar Nicholas of Cusa also {{proposed}} that the Earth rotates on its axis in his book, On Learned Ignorance (1440). Al-Sijzi also proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis. Empirical evidence for the Earth's rotation on its axis, using <b>the</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> comets, was given by Tusi (1201–1274) and Ali Qushji (1403–1474).|$|E
5|$|Because {{it is so}} {{far from}} the nearest major landmass, the {{ecosystem}} of Kohala has experienced <b>the</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> geographic isolation, resulting in an ecosystem radically different from that of other places. Invasive species introduced by man present a problem to Kohala's ecosystem, as they push native species out of their habitat. There are several initiatives to preserve Kohala's ecosystem. Crops, especially sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), have been harvested on the Leeward side of the volcano for centuries as well. The northern part of the island is named after the mountain, with two districts named North and South Kohala. King Kamehameha I, the first King of the Kingdom of Hawaii, was born in North Kohala, near Hawi.|$|E

5|$|By 1929, <b>the</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> {{beta decay}} {{prompted}} Bohr to again {{suggest that the}} law of conservation of energy be abandoned, but Enrico Fermi's hypothetical neutrino and the subsequent 1932 discovery of the neutron provided another explanation. This prompted Bohr {{to create a new}} theory of the compound nucleus in 1936, which explained how neutrons could be captured by the nucleus. In this model, the nucleus could be deformed like a drop of liquid. He worked on this with a new collaborator, the Danish physicist Fritz Kalckar, who died suddenly in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Cell theory {{states that}} the cell is the {{fundamental}} unit of life, that all living things are composed {{of one or more}} cells, and that all cells arise from other cells through cell division. In multicellular organisms, every cell in the organism's body derives ultimately from a single cell in a fertilized egg. The cell is also considered to be the basic unit in many pathological processes. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> energy flow occurs in cells in processes {{that are part of the}} function known as metabolism. Finally, cells contain hereditary information (DNA), which is passed from cell to cell during cell division. Research into the origin of life, abiogenesis, amounts to an attempt to discover the origin of the first cells.|$|E
5|$|Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand {{presents}} {{a detailed analysis}} and refutation of climate change denial. In her foreword to the book, Naomi Oreskes writes that people fall victim to <b>the</b> <b>phenomenon</b> <b>of</b> denial due to feeling frightened. The book examines several arguments against global warming, and uses peer-reviewed evidence from the scientific consensus to back-up rationale for disputing the validity of each argument. The methodology of those denying climate change is assessed, including: cherry picking data purporting to support their specific viewpoints, maintaining a high bar for evidence of climate change by those denying it, and criticism {{of the values of}} climate scientists themselves. The book puts forth an explanation why certain individuals, and the wider public, have a tendency to deny the scientific consensus for climate change.|$|E
