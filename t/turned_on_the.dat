5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of the Jurchens the Song dynasty was for centuries engaged in a {{stand-off}} against the Western Xia and the Khitan Liao dynasty. This balance was disrupted when the Song dynasty developed a military alliance with the Jurchens for the purpose of annihilating the Liao. This balance of power disrupted, the Jurchens then <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Song, resulting in the fall of the Northern Song and the subsequent establishment of the Southern Song.|$|E
5|$|During 632 or 633, Edwin of Northumbria {{was overthrown}} and slain and his kingdom was ravaged by Cadwallon ap Cadfan, {{supported}} by Penda of Mercia. The Mercians then <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> East Angles and their king, Ecgric. In 640 or 641, they routed the East Anglian army {{in a battle}} in which Ecgric and his predecessor Sigeberht both perished.|$|E
5|$|During his {{recuperation}} Formby contracted gastroenteritis and had {{a suspected}} blood clot on his lung, after which he underwent an operation to clear a fishbone that was stuck in his throat. He had recovered sufficiently by April 1953 to undertake a 17-show tour of Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), before a special appearance at the Southport Garrick Theatre. That September he <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Blackpool Illuminations.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} {{movements}} {{in place that}} are commonly used in dressage training: <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forehand, <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> haunches, and the pirouette. Additionally, <b>the</b> pivot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hindquarters and <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> center are seen in Western riding. The roll-back turn, seen in jumping events and in reining, is a variation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pirouette. All these movements are performed in relatively one place, in a circular motion.|$|R

5000|$|To ride a <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forehand, {{the rider}} should {{encourage}} a square halt {{by moving the}} horse leg-to-hand with proper riding aids, creating energy with the legs and containing the energy with the hands. When asking for <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forehand, the inside and outside aids switch {{in relation to the}} new direction of the bend.|$|R
5|$|In 1549, Robert Kett led an {{uprising}} in Norfolk; marching on Norwich, his army camped on the north-east {{side of the}} river, overlooking Cow Tower. Two rebel attacks were then made across the river into the Hospital meadows, {{in an attempt to}} take Bishop Bridge, which would have given them access to the city. Kett had brought artillery, which he <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Cow Tower, damaging the latter's parapets. The rebellion failed, and the tower {{does not seem to have}} required extensive repairs.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, {{the first}} {{hydroelectric}} power plant in the United States was built at the falls on Upton Island. The Brush Electric Company, headed by Charles F. Brush, supplied the equipment, which included five generators. The electricity was transmitted via four circuits to shops on Washington Avenue. The power plant <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lights on September 5, 1882, {{just ahead of the}} Vulcan Street Plant in Appleton, Wisconsin, which started generating electricity on September 30. The company competed with the Minneapolis Gas Light Company, which later became Minnegasco and is now part of CenterPoint Energy.|$|E
5|$|In the Somerset town of Bridgwater, revolt {{broke out}} on 19 June, led by Thomas Ingleby and Adam Brugge. The crowds {{attacked}} the local Augustine house and forced their master {{to give up}} his local privileges and pay a ransom. The rebels then <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> properties of John Sydenham, a local merchant and official, looting his manor and burning paperwork, before executing Walter Baron, a local man. The Ilchester gaol was stormed, and one unpopular prisoner executed.|$|E

50|$|Common {{problems}} with <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> haunches include pivoting on one leg, backing through the turn (it {{is a much}} lesser sin for the horse to be moving slightly forward and make a wider circle), and loss of rhythm, {{as well as an}} incorrect turn (such as doing a <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forehand or a <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> center if the rider allows the hindquarters to swing out). The horse should also remain straight (i.e. correctly bent) through the turn, rather than overbent in the neck or tilting the head.|$|R

5|$|Lazarus Malkoth (voiced by Keith Szarabajka): A Roman {{who first}} founded the Darkwatch society in 66 AD {{in order to}} battle the dark forces {{responsible}} for {{the decline of the}} Roman Empire. He eventually got possessed by a demon and himself became a powerful vampire and <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> organization he founded, raising an undead army to aid him in his task. The Darkwatch then pursued Lazarus across Europe and later America. During the game's development, the villain's name was Scourge.|$|E
5|$|The Jazira {{remained}} under Buyid control until 989, when Abu Taghlib's brothers Abu Abdallah Husayn and Abu Tahir Ibrahim, who had {{submitted to}} the Buyids, were installed as governors to oppose {{the power of the}} Kurdish chieftain Badh, who had taken control of Mosul. In this fight, the two brothers relied upon the Uqaylis; after the defeat of Badh, the Banu Uqayl <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Hamdanids and deposed and killed Abu Tahir Ibrahim, establishing the Uqaylid Dynasty as the rulers of the Jazira.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other insects, P.exclamans use sexual pheromones to attract members of the {{opposite}} sex. Researchers have attempted to determine the exact role that sexual pheromones play in sexual attraction in paper wasps. They set up a wind tunnel where males and females were exposed to a sexual pheromone wick that was isolated from males and females. These pheromones were taken by hexane extracts from wholes bodies and thoraces of unmated females. The male extracts {{were taken from the}} ectal mandibular and seventh sternal glands. It was found that the opposite sex was attracted upwind of the scent and the results were intensified when a fan was <b>turned</b> <b>on.</b> <b>The</b> range of the scent was found to be around 2 metres.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{forehand}} is {{the simplest}} of the exercises, asking the horse to move his hindquarters around his forehand, so that the hindquarters inscribe an arc. <b>The</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> haunches asks the horse to move his forehand around the hindquarters, so that the forelegs inscribe an arc, with the horse bent {{in the direction of}} the turn. It is therefore more difficult than <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forehand, requiring better balance and engagement. The pirouette is the most difficult and advanced maneuver, asking the horse to bend in the direction of movement and remain engaged, and requiring collection.|$|R

5|$|Blake {{arrived at}} St Helen's Pool in April 1651 {{and set about}} taking the island of Tresco, attacking the harbour of Old Grimsby and the blockhouse. Blake {{deployed}} a force of men in small boats, but they landed on the wrong island {{and had to be}} recalled to the ships. The next day the men landed on the beaches below the blockhouse; fighting ensued and the attackers were driven back. Blake's men made another landing which also saw fierce resistance, and the guns of the blockhouse were probably <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> landing parties. Around 15 of the assault force were killed, but the guns of Blake's ships guns had a longer range than those of the blockhouse and Old Grimsby fell. Blake went on to use Tresco as a basis for taking St Mary's.|$|E
5|$|Connal, Cline's boss, was {{available}} in case of trouble, watching {{from his home in}} Connecticut. His superior, NBC Sports vice president Chet Simmons, who alternated weekends with Connal as on-call in the event of difficulties, was also watching from his Manhattan home. NBC president Goodman and NBC Sports head Carl Lindemann also <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> game, which was expected to be exciting, in their New York area homes. The Buffalo Bills–San Diego Chargers game, shown as the first of a network doubleheader, was running long in its 2½-hour time slot, and NBC unhesitatingly cut its ending to go to the Jets and Raiders.|$|E
5|$|Following further {{fighting}} between 1648 and 1649, the Third English Civil War {{broke out in}} 1651. Royalist forces {{under the command of}} Charles II advanced as far as Worcester, where the army paused to reinforce the walls further and await reinforcements in relative safety. The Parliamentary forces under Oliver Cromwell attacked in early September; the ensuing battle of Worcester saw the Royalist forces pushed steadily back into the city. Fort Royal was successfully stormed by the Essex militia and its guns <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> city itself. Cromwell's men began forcing their way into the city from west, south and east and by the evening the city had fallen. The collapse marked the end of the Third Civil War. In the aftermath the bastions and other fortifications were mostly destroyed by Parliament, although the medieval walls and gates were spared.|$|E

5|$|Herodotus {{tells us}} that, on seeing {{the outcome of}} the battle hung in the balance, the {{disarmed}} Samians had joined in {{on the side of the}} allies, doing what they could. This inspired the other Ionian contingents to turn on the Persians as well. At which stage in the battle this happened is not clear; the Samians were presumably not in the main battle line (being disarmed), so it may have been after the Persians retreated to the camp. Meanwhile, the Milesians who were guarding the passes of Mycale also <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Persians. At first they misdirected the fleeing Persian contingents so that they ended up back amongst the Allied troops; then, perhaps seeing {{the outcome of the}} battle was certain, they began killing the fleeing Persians.|$|E
5|$|In 1516, Ottoman forces conquered Mamluk territory. Agricultural {{villages in}} Jordan {{witnessed}} {{a period of}} relative prosperity in the 16th century, but were later abandoned. For the next centuries, Ottoman rule in the region, at times, was virtually absent and reduced to annual tax collection visits. This led to a short-lived occupation by the Wahhabi forces (1803–1812), an ultra-orthodox Islamic movement that emerged in Najd in modern-day Saudi Arabia. Ibrahim Pasha, son of {{the governor of the}} Egypt Eyalet under the request of the Ottoman sultan, rooted out the Wahhabis between 1811 and 1818. In 1833 Ibrahim Pasha <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Ottomans and established his rule over the Levant. His oppressive policies led to the unsuccessful peasants' revolt in Palestine in 1834. The cities of Al-Salt and Al-Karak were destroyed by Ibrahim Pasha's forces for harbouring a peasants' revolt leader. Egyptian rule was later forcibly ended, with Ottoman rule restored.|$|E

5|$|Lütjens {{then decided}} to move to a new area, as the {{surviving}} members of the dispersed convoy had sent distress signals. He chose the Cape Town-Gibraltar convoy route, and positioned himself to the northwest of Cape Verde. The two ships encountered another convoy, escorted by the battleship , on 8 March. Lütjens again forbade an attack, but he shadowed the convoy and directed U-boats to attack. A pair of U-boats sank a total of 28,488 tons of shipping on the night of 8–9 March. Malaya <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> two battleships and closed to , well within the range of the Germans' guns, but Lütjens refused to be drawn into an engagement.
