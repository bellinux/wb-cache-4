5|$|Many horses died as {{a result}} of the {{conditions}} at the front—of exhaustion, drowning, becoming mired in mud and falling in shell holes. Other horses were captured after their riders were killed. Horses also endured poor feeding and care, poison gas attacks that injured their respiratory systems and skin, and skin conditions such as mange. When gas warfare began in 1915, nose plugs were improvised for the horses to allow them to breathe during attacks. Later, several types of gas masks were developed by both the Central and Allied nations, although horses often confused them with feedbags and destroyed them. Soldiers found that better-bred horses were more likely to suffer from shell shock and act up when exposed to <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> <b>and</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> war than less-well-bred animals, who often learned to lie down and take cover at the sound of artillery fire. Veterinary hospitals were established to assist horses in recovering from shell shock and battle wounds, but thousands of equine corpses still lined the roads of the Western Front. In one year, 120,000horses were treated for wounds or disease by British veterinary hospitals alone. Ambulances and field veterinary hospitals were required to care for the horses, and horse trailers were first developed for use on the Western Front as equine ambulances. Disease was also a major issue for horses at the front, with equine influenza, ringworm, sand colic, sores from fly bites, and anthrax among the illnesses that affected them. British Army Army Veterinary Corps hospitals treated 725,216 horses over the course of the war, successfully healing 529,064. Horses were moved from the front to veterinary hospitals by several methods of transportation, including on foot, by rail and by barge. During the last months of the war, barges were considered ideal transportation for horses suffering wounds from shells and bombs.|$|E

25|$|From the beginning, Westwood had no {{interest}} in doing a straight adaptation of the film as either a shoot 'em up or traditional point-and-click adventure game. As a result, the team decided to write a new story set within the fictional milieu of the film – a story in which players would play not as Rick Deckard, but as a new character, Ray McCoy. This allowed fans of the film the experience of seeing <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> <b>and</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> the movie, but without knowing where the story is heading.|$|E

Reviewing the film for History Extra, the website of BBC History Magazine, she said: [...] "The film starkly and powerfully unveiled <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> <b>and</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> enslavement– from slaves picking cotton as they sang in the fields, to the crack of the lash down people's backs. [...] We also heard a lot about the ideology behind enslavement. Masters such as William Ford and Edwin Epps, although very different characters, both used an interpretation of Christianity to justify their ownership of slaves. They believed the Bible sanctioned slavery, and that it was their 'Christian duty' to preach the scriptures to their slaves." ...|$|E

500|$|Pat Wheeler, {{a scholar}} of literature, {{describes}} the narrative style as [...] "both naturalistic and realistic and {{very much in the}} manner of the nineteenth century writers [...] cites as literary influences"—Wheeler notes Émile Zola, Charles Dickens and George Gissing among these. Wheeler emphasizes that the naturalistic tendencies of the narrative allow treatment of the war setting without an idealization of the [...] "human" [...] parts of the narrative. Consistently, reviews emphasize the novel's imagery of the battle experience in and amongst the trenches. For Slade, the novel [...] "produces a vivid and traumatizing description of <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> <b>and</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> life and death in (and under the trenches)"; the principal cause of this, he says, is [...] "the pure fury and intensity of the imagery created page after page".|$|E
500|$|Steven Biel, an American {{cultural}} historian, {{notes the}} novelistic {{way in which}} Lord tells the story. The book depicts events {{through the eyes of}} multiple individuals, violating simple chronology to present an overlapping series of narratives. Nathaniel Philbrick, writing in the introduction to the fiftieth anniversary edition of A Night to Remember, notes {{that at the time of}} publication it was the first significant book about Titanic for nearly forty years. He argues that the book's hallmarks are its restraint, brevity and readability, which downplays the extravagant and mythical aspects of the disaster and instead puts in the foreground the stories of the people on the ship. The narrative builds suspense, making the reader care about the characters and revisit the disaster from their perspective. It tells the story in a highly visual and aural way, describing <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> <b>and</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> the night of the disaster [...] "with the immediacy of a live broadcast or a television documentary", as Biel puts it.|$|E
500|$|Fred Dibnah {{was the son}} of Frank and Betsy Dibnah (née Travis), {{who were}} {{initially}} both employed at a bleach works. His mother later worked as a charwoman at a gas works. [...] Named after his uncle Frederick, he was born on 28April 1938 and brought up in the historic Lancashire town of Bolton, then a predominantly industrial town with a history in the spinning and weaving of cotton. As a child, Dibnah was fascinated by <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> <b>and</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> industry and the dozens of chimney stacks visible around Burnden Park, and paid particular attention to the steeplejacks he saw on his way to school. [...] A popular pastime for local children was playing around the many mill lodges (industrial ponds) which once littered the area. [...] An inventive child, Dibnah and some friends designed a makeshift diving suit from a crisp tin, a car inner tube and some piping. After being told to remove it from the local swimming baths, they tested it in one of the lodges, but were unsuccessful.|$|E

2500|$|Susan Aronoff, one of {{the founders}} of WoW, praised Haredi women's prayer, saying, [...] "The women of WoW also benefit from {{proximity}} to haredi women at prayer. Hearing haredi women cry to God, praise God, and address God in the direct and personal way they know how to do so well, uplifts others.". However, in the same article, she admits to the provocative nature of the WoW group, stating, [...] "Like it or not <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> <b>and</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> women leading services may initially shock them (traditional women)" [...] and that this will lead traditional women to make changes in religious practice. One supporter of WoW writes that traditional women [...] "mouth their words silently" [...] when they pray, and thus think they are holier than others.|$|E
2500|$|More recently, George MacDonald Fraser {{claimed in}} his novel Flashman's Lady (1977) that Harry Flashman was the first cricketer to record a [...] "hat-trick". The caddish fictional hero participates in a cricket match at Lord's in 1842 that {{features}} some of the leading cricketers of that era – Felix, Fuller Pilch, and Alfred Mynn. (Flashman gets Felix's wicket through skill, Pilch's through luck, and Mynn's by 'knavery'.) MacDonald Fraser takes great care to describe <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> <b>and</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> Lord's {{as it was in}} the 1840s. Although very different from Sassoon's style, his descriptions of the cricket match and its setting often reach an idyllic beauty that fits in well with the romantic nostalgia for village cricket during much of the 20th century.|$|E
2500|$|The Western Australian Museum's {{research}} and other works (notably Barbara Winters' HMAS Sydney: Fact, Fantasy and Fraud, Tom Frame's HMAS Sydney: Loss and Controversy, and Wes Olson's, Bitter Victory) supported the German account regarding {{the location of}} the battle. In late 2005, University of Western Australia Press published Glenys McDonald's book, Seeking the Sydney: A Quest for the Truth. McDonald had conducted extensive interviews with residents of the coastal area nearest the battle, much of which had been tabled at the 2001 SPC seminar. According to McDonald, many residents of Port Gregory, about [...] north of Geraldton, reported <b>the</b> <b>sights</b> <b>and</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> a naval battle at about the time that Sydney and Kormoran engaged. This suggested—incorrectly—that the ships may have sunk much further south than the location given by Detmers or the Australian government.|$|E
