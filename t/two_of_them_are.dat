5|$|Oklahoma Gas & Electric, {{commonly}} referred to as OG (NYSE: OGE) operates four base electric power plants in Oklahoma. <b>Two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> coal-fired power plants: one in Muskogee, and the other in Redrock. Two are gas-fired power plants: one in Harrah and the other in Konawa. OG was the first electric company in Oklahoma to generate electricity from wind farms in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Sappho's life. She was from a wealthy family from Lesbos, though the names of both of her parents are uncertain. Ancient sources say that she had three brothers; the names of <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> {{mentioned}} in the Brothers Poem discovered in 2014. She was exiled to Sicily around 600 BC, and may have continued to work until around 570. Later legends surrounding Sappho's love for the ferryman Phaon and her death are unreliable.|$|E
5|$|The 20 {{amino acids}} that are encoded {{directly}} by the codons of the universal genetic code are called standard or canonical amino acids. A modified form of methionine (N-formylmethionine) is often incorporated in place of methionine as the initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Other amino acids are called non-standard or non-canonical. Most of the non-standard amino acids are also non-proteinogenic (i.e. they cannot be incorporated into proteins during translation), but <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> proteinogenic, {{as they can be}} incorporated translationally into proteins by exploiting information not encoded in the universal genetic code.|$|E
30|$|DNA {{database}} {{comparison of}} the DNA sequences obtained with the full-sequence ITS 2 and partial-sequence 5.8 S rDNA from the ocular samples demonstrated that they were derived from the fungal ITS regions. Thirteen filamentous fungi and seven yeasts were identified. Regarding filamentous fungi, four <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> Aspergillus ssp. (<b>two</b> sequences were identical to Aspergillus niger ITS 2 / 5.8 S rDNA region, and one of each were identical as Aspergillus fumigatus and Aspergillus oryzae sequences), <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> Fusarium ssp. (Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium solani), <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>were</b> Alternaria ssp.

5|$|The four Buddha statues, which {{depict the}} Dhyana mudra, are also carved from solid rock. <b>Two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> {{more or less}} intact today, while only parts {{of the other two}} remain. The stupa in the middle appears to have been of the Bubbulakara (bubble shaped) design {{commonly}} seen in Sri Lanka. The upper part has been destroyed, and only the dome shaped lower part now remains. However, it has only two Pesavas (the rings found at the base of stupas) rather than the traditional three.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} churches in Romford. Confusingly, <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> {{dedicated}} to Edward the Confessor, one of England's two kings {{that were made}} saints, and who lived at Havering-atte-Bower nearby. The main church, which is Anglican, is Romford's original church and situated in Market Place, {{in the heart of}} the town. The other one, which is Roman Catholic, is located to the north of the town centre, in Park End Road.|$|E
5|$|Eleven of the 31 {{described}} {{species of}} Monoplacophora (a class of mollusks) live below 2000meters. Of these 11 species, two live {{exclusively in the}} hadal zone. The greatest number of monoplacophorans are from the eastern Pacific Ocean along the oceanic trenches. However, no abyssal monoplacophorans have yet {{been found in the}} Western Pacific and only one abyssal species has been identified in the Indian Ocean. Of the 922 known species of chitons (from the Polyplacophora class of mollusks), 22 species (2.4%) are reported to live below 2000meters and <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> restricted to the abyssal plain. Although genetic studies are lacking, at least six of these species are thought to be eurybathic (capable of living {{in a wide range of}} depths), having been reported as occurring from the sublittoral to abyssal depths. A large number of the polyplacophorans from great depths are herbivorous or xylophagous, which could explain the difference between the distribution of monoplacophorans and polyplacophorans in the world's oceans.|$|E

5|$|Glee club {{director}} Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) has {{the club}} split up into pairs to sing ballads to one another. As Matt Rutherford (Dijon Talton) is absent, Will {{is forced to}} take his place and sing with Rachel (Lea Michele), who develops a crush on him. Will is dismayed, remembering Suzy Pepper (Sarah Drew), the last student who had such strong feelings for him. When her feelings were not reciprocated, she was so distraught she ate an extremely hot pepper from Mexico, was hospitalized, and had to have an esophagus transplant. Rachel visits Will's apartment, where his wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) puts her to work cooking and cleaning. After an encounter with Suzy Pepper, during which Suzy explains that the <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> similar and that chasing after Will won't repair Rachel's self-esteem, Rachel realizes her feelings for Will reflect her concerns about her own self-worth, and apologizes for her behavior. Afterward, Will assures her that she will find the man of her dreams who loves her for who she is.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} approach, the radii of the given circles are {{modified}} appropriately by an amount Δr so that <b>two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> tangential (touching). Their point of tangency is {{chosen as the}} center of inversion in a circle that intersects each of the two touching circles in two places. Upon inversion, the touching circles become two parallel lines: Their only point of intersection is sent to infinity under inversion, so they cannot meet. The same inversion transforms the third circle into another circle. The solution of the inverted problem must either be (1) a straight line parallel to the two given parallel lines and tangent to the transformed third given circle; or (2) a circle of constant radius that is tangent to the two given parallel lines and the transformed given circle. Re-inversion and adjusting the radii of all circles by Δr produces a solution circle tangent to the original three circles.|$|E
5|$|Naturally {{occurring}} cadmium {{is composed}} of 8 isotopes. <b>Two</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> <b>are</b> radioactive, and three are expected to decay but have not done so under laboratory conditions. The two natural radioactive isotopes are 113Cd (beta decay, half-life is 7.7 × 1015 years) and 116Cd (two-neutrino double beta decay, half-life is 2.9 × 1019 years). The other three are 106Cd, 108Cd (both double electron capture), and 114Cd (double beta decay); only lower limits on these half-lives have been determined. At least three isotopes– 110Cd, 111Cd, and 112Cd– are stable. Among the isotopes that do not occur naturally, the most long-lived are 109Cd with a half-life of 462.6 days, and 115Cd with a half-life of 53.46 hours. All of the remaining radioactive isotopes have half-lives of less than 2.5 hours, and the majority have half-lives of less than 5 minutes. Cadmium has 8 known meta states, with the most stable being 113mCd (t1⁄2= 14.1 years), 115mCd (t1⁄2= 44.6 days), and 117mCd (t1⁄2= 3.36 hours).|$|E
