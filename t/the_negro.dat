5|$|Between 1971 and 1977, nine {{players from}} <b>the</b> <b>Negro</b> Leagues were {{inducted}} {{by a special}} Negro Leagues Committee, which was given the task of identifying worthy players who played in <b>the</b> <b>Negro</b> Leagues prior to the breaking of baseball's color line. Since 1977, players from <b>the</b> <b>Negro</b> Leagues have been considered by the Veterans Committee, and nine more individuals have been approved by that body. In 2005, the Hall announced {{the formation of a}} Committee on African-American Baseball, which held a 2006 election for eligible figures from <b>the</b> <b>Negro</b> Leagues and earlier 19th-century teams; 17 additional Negro League figures were chosen in that election, including executive Effa Manley, the first woman inducted.|$|E

As more industrial art subjects were added, a separate arts and trade school on the secondary level called <b>the</b> <b>Negros</b> Oriental Trade School, which became the East Visayan School of Arts and Trades in 1956 and the Central Visayas Polytechnic College in 1983.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Negro</b> Motorist Green Book (at times styled <b>The</b> <b>Negro</b> Motorist Green-Book or titled <b>The</b> <b>Negro</b> Travelers' Green Book) was {{an annual}} guidebook for African-American roadtrippers, {{commonly}} referred to simply as the Green Book. It was originated and published by New York City mailman Victor Hugo Green from 1936 to 1966, during the era of Jim Crow laws, when open and often legally prescribed discrimination against non-whites was widespread. Although pervasive racial discrimination and poverty limited black car ownership, the emerging African-American middle class bought automobiles {{as soon as they}} could, but faced a variety of dangers and inconveniences along the road, from refusal of food and lodging to arbitrary arrest. In response, Green wrote his guide to services and places relatively friendly to African-Americans, eventually expanding its coverage from the New York area to much of North America, as well as founding a travel agency.|$|E
5|$|The years 1916–1930 {{marked the}} largest {{migration}} of African-Americans to Pittsburgh. Known as the cultural nucleus of Black Pittsburgh, Wylie Avenue in the Hill District {{was an important}} jazz mecca. Jazz greats such as Duke Ellington and Pittsburgh natives Billy Strayhorn and Earl Hines played there. Two of <b>the</b> <b>Negro</b> League's greatest rivals, the Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Homestead Grays, often competed in the Hill District. The teams dominated <b>the</b> <b>Negro</b> National League in the 1930s and 1940s.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{discharge}} from the military, Day returned to the Eagles in time for Opening Day on May 5, 1946. He threw a no-hitter against the Philadelphia Stars, despite his absence, in a 2–0 victory, allowing just three base runners via a walk and two errors charged to his teammates. Hampered by a lingering arm injury, Day nonetheless lead the league that season in wins, strikeouts, and complete games. That same year, in <b>the</b> <b>Negro</b> League World Series, he pitched in two games as the Eagles edged the Monarchs in seven games, winning the championship. He played his final season in <b>the</b> <b>Negro</b> leagues in 1949 with the Baltimore Elite Giants. Recordkeeping was poor during Day's career; partial statistics credit him with a 67–29 record, but league historians claim he won as many as 300 games.|$|E

5|$|Lawrence Eugene Doby (December 13, 1923 – June 18, 2003) was an American {{professional}} baseball player in <b>the</b> <b>Negro</b> leagues and Major League Baseball (MLB) {{who was the}} second black player to break baseball's color barrier. A native of Camden, South Carolina and three-sport all-state athlete {{while in high school}} in Paterson, New Jersey, Doby accepted a basketball scholarship from Long Island University. At 17 years of age, he began his {{professional baseball}} career with the Newark Eagles as the team's second baseman. Doby joined the United States Navy during World War II. His military service complete, Doby returned to baseball in 1946, and along with teammate Monte Irvin, helped the Eagles win <b>the</b> <b>Negro</b> League World Series.|$|E
5|$|McBride {{was born}} in Fulton, Missouri, to Arnold McBride and Wanna Robinson McBride. The elder Arnold McBride had been a pitcher for <b>the</b> <b>Negro</b> league {{baseball}} team known as the Kansas City Monarchs. Bake McBride starred in football at Fulton High School, earning all-state honors, and he also played basketball and ran track. Fulton High School did not offer a baseball program.|$|E
5|$|The 1910s were a {{productive}} time for Du Bois. In 1911 {{he attended the}} First Universal Races Congress in London and he published his first novel, The Quest of the Silver Fleece. Two years later, Du Bois wrote, produced, and directed a pageant for the stage, The Star of Ethiopia. In 1915, Du Bois published <b>The</b> <b>Negro,</b> a general history of black Africans, and {{the first of its}} kind in English. The book rebutted claims of African inferiority, and would come to serve as the basis of much Afrocentric historiography in the 20th century. <b>The</b> <b>Negro</b> predicted unity and solidarity for colored people around the world, and it influenced many who supported the Pan-African movement.|$|E

60|$|Their blood once {{thoroughly}} up, <b>the</b> <b>negroes</b> {{were ready}} for anything.

5|$|The {{policy was}} revised, with Negro {{soldiers}} serving in provisional platoons. In the 12th Army Group these {{were attached to}} regiments, while in the 6th Army Group the platoons were grouped into whole companies attached to the division. The former arrangement were generally better rated by the units they were attached to, because <b>the</b> <b>Negro</b> platoons had no company-level unit training.|$|E
5|$|After his acquittal, he was {{transferred}} to Camp Breckinridge, Kentucky, where {{he served as a}} coach for army athletics until receiving an honorable discharge in November 1944. While there, Robinson met a former player for the Kansas City Monarchs of <b>the</b> <b>Negro</b> American League, who encouraged Robinson to write the Monarchs and ask for a tryout. Robinson took the former player's advice and wrote to Monarchs' co-owner Thomas Baird.|$|E
5|$|An exhibit honoring Pittsburgh's Negro league {{baseball}} teams {{was introduced in}} 2006. Located by the stadium's left field entrance, the display features statues of seven players who competed for the city's Homestead Grays and Pittsburgh Crawfords, including Josh Gibson and Satchel Paige. The exhibit also includes the Legacy Theatre, a 25-seat facility that plays a film about Pittsburgh's history with <b>the</b> <b>Negro</b> leagues.

History professor Timothy Gilfoyle wrote that Banks' talent for baseball was discovered by Bill Blair, a family friend who scouted for the Kansas City Monarchs of <b>the</b> <b>Negro</b> American League.

5|$|Baseball was {{introduced}} to Puerto Rico by immigrants during the nineteenth century. The first sanctioned baseball game in the island was played on January 9, 1898 in Santurce, Puerto Rico, where two teams composed of Puerto Rican, American and Cuban players participated. After this game, baseball became a widespread sport and professional and amateur leagues were organized. During this time period, the Puerto Rico national teams experienced success on international competition and Afro-Puerto Rican players began to participate in <b>the</b> <b>Negro</b> Leagues.|$|E
5|$|Because of his soft-spoken demeanor, Day's accomplishments {{were not}} {{immediately}} recognized {{as opposed to}} other elite pitchers of the league like Satchel Paige.

In 1995, Day was elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame, just six days before his death at 78 years old.|$|E
