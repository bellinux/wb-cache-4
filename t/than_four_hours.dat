5|$|Travel {{time from}} Oslo to Gothenburg was {{slightly}} more <b>than</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours.</b> Prices varied from NOK633 {{for a business}} class ticket, NOK355 for a second class ticket to NOK187 for pre-booked tickets. X2 trains were never introduced on the section from Oslo to Gothenburg. Instead, conventional Swedish trains from the 1960s hauled by Rc locomotives were used. Passengers traveling from Oslo to Copenhagen had to change train in Gothenburg.|$|E

5|$|During the trial, the {{prosecution}} alleged bribery and witness tampering {{attempts by the}} Frank legal team. Meanwhile, the defense requested a mistrial because it believed the jurors had been intimidated by the people {{inside and outside the}} courtroom, but the motion was denied. Fearing for the safety of Frank and his lawyers in case of an acquittal, Roan and the defense agreed that neither Frank nor his defense attorneys would be present when the verdict was read. On August 25, 1913, after less <b>than</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> of deliberation, the jury reached a unanimous guilty verdict convicting Frank of murder.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of their second album, Led Zeppelin {{completed}} several more US tours. They played initially in clubs and ballrooms, and then in larger auditoriums as their popularity grew. Some early Led Zeppelin concerts lasted more <b>than</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours,</b> with expanded and improvised live versions of their repertoire. Many of these shows have been preserved as bootleg recordings. It was {{during this period of}} intensive concert touring that the band developed a reputation for off-stage excess.|$|E
5|$|After a rough {{position}} of the burst had been determined, Enrico Costa of the BeppoSAX team contacted astronomer Dale Frail at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's Very Large Array. Frail began making observations at a wavelength of 20centimeters at 01:30UTC, less <b>than</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> after the discovery. While preparing for his observations Frail contacted astronomer Stanislav Djorgovski, who was working with the Hale telescope. Djorgovski immediately compared his images of the region with older images from the Digitized Sky Survey, but he found no new sources of light within the error box. Mark Metzger, a colleague of Djorgovski at the Caltech observatory, conducted a more extensive analysis of the data, but was also unable to identify any new light sources.|$|E

5|$|Fingleton then scored his maiden {{first-class}} {{century of}} 117 in less <b>than</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> {{in the following}} match, against the touring South Africa, helping his team to 3/430 in their runchase. The hosts were 18 runs short of victory when time ran out. Although Fingleton made only five in New South Wales' second match against the South Africans, Fingleton was selected for the Test series against the same team. This came after only ten matches for his state. Starting with the Second Test, he was twelfth man for three consecutive Tests, and as a result, did not play any cricket for six weeks before he added a pair of 40s in a win over arch-rivals Victoria.|$|E
5|$|The two {{aftershocks}} {{the following}} morning were separated by less <b>than</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> and both caused {{at least as much}} damage as the mainshock. A large fire was triggered following the first aftershock at a shopping center in Scotia that destroyed four businesses, with the resulting damage at that site alone estimated at $15 million, and was the largest individual financial misfortune of the sequence of earthquakes. The water supply in Rio Dell was terminated when the water main was severed at the abutment to the Eel River bridge and power outages were widespread throughout Humboldt County. Some were mere seconds while others lasted for hours, but the hydroelectric plant's performance at Ruth Reservoir was deemed acceptable, and power that was not generated locally was unaffected.|$|E
5|$|In 195758, the Australian Test team toured South Africa {{during the}} {{southern}} hemisphere summer, opening up opportunities in the Shield competition back in Australia. Booth established himself at first-class level with 503 runs at 50.30. After scoring two fifties, he broke through for his maiden first-class century against the Victorian Bushrangers at the Sydney Cricket Ground, in his last match of the season. He put on a partnership of 325 with future Test teammate Norm O'Neill in fewer <b>than</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours.</b> It was his fifteenth first-class match, and helped his state secure a fifth successive title with a ten-wicket win over their arch-rivals. With the Test players returning to Australia in 195859, Booth again faced more competition for places. He struggled, playing six matches and aggregating only 190 runs at 31.66. He only had six innings for the entire season, and in his only opportunity against Peter May's touring Englishmen, he made a duck. Booth passed 50 on two occasions during the season, making 75 and 85. In one high-scoring match against South Australia, he took 0/97 with his part-time off spin.|$|E

5|$|The alert was {{declared}} upon {{the advice of}} the Interstate Sanitation Commission. Members of the commission had been monitoring the smog situation in shifts for three days, nonstop. Thomas R. Glenn Jr., the commission's director and chief engineer, recommended the alert at 11:25a.m. after seeing instruments in New York and New Jersey that showed carbon monoxide greater than 10 ppm (parts-per-million) and smoke greater than 7.5 ppm, both for more <b>than</b> <b>four</b> consecutive <b>hours.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In August 2017, the United Nations {{human rights}} office called Israel, the State of Palestinian and Hamas {{authorities}} {{to resolve the}} conflict, saying [...] ""We are deeply concerned about the steady deterioration in the humanitarian conditions {{and the protection of}} human rights in Gaza", and that the supply of electricity for less <b>than</b> <b>four</b> a <b>hours</b> a day since April [...] "has a grave impact on the provision of essential health, water and sanitation services".|$|R
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Australia, he {{established}} his partnership with Bill Ponsford, and in the 1926–27 Shield season, they put on a 375-run opening stand in less <b>than</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours,</b> which {{laid the foundation for}} the world record first-class score of 1107 against New South Wales. The stand eclipsed the Sheffield shield record of 298 for the first wicket by Victor Trumper and Reg Duff in 1902–03. Woodfull made 133 and the Victorians won by an innings and 656 runs. He ended the season by scoring 140 and 29 not out as the Australian XI defeated The Rest by seven wickets. He scored two further fifties and ended the season with 483 runs at 69.00 in five matches. He then toured Malaya and Singapore with Bert Oldfield's team during the off-season, scoring three centuries; none of the matches were first-class.|$|E
5|$|These {{delays in}} turn {{affected}} the fly-in of 1 RAR, with the companies forced to wait at the departure point in AO Colombus before they commenced the air move to FSB Coral. Hughes visited Bennett at FSB Coral at 15:30 to discuss {{aspects of the}} defence, as well as events planned for the following day. The deployment of the second battalion was not complete until 16:10, with the 1 RAR Mortar Platoon arriving on the last flight, more <b>than</b> <b>four</b> <b>hours</b> late. It became clear to Bennett that 1 RAR would need to deploy {{to the east of}} the FSB, and with just two hours before last light the companies were moved into hasty defensive positions, the last of which were not established until 17:00. Due to the hurried deployment, by dusk the two battalions of 1 ATF and their supporting elements were scattered around FSB Coral in four roughly connected groups, rather than in a co-ordinated defensive position. The task force headquarters advance party and part of its Defence Platoon were located centrally, yet the task force tactical headquarters and the artillery tactical headquarters under Lieutenant Colonel Jack Kelly—Commanding Officer of 12th Field Regiment—both remained in Bearcat. Hughes was not present either, having left Bearcat to attend to matters at the task force rear headquarters at Nui Dat, and was due to move forward with the tactical headquarters to FSB Coral the following day.|$|E

40|$|Hair follicles undergo {{continuous}} {{cycles of}} growth, involution and rest. This process, {{referred to as}} the hair growth cycle, has a periodicity of weeks to months. At the same time, skin and hair follicles harbor a functional circadian clock that regulates gene expression with a periodicity of approximately twenty <b>four</b> <b>hours.</b> In our recent study we found that circadian clock genes play a role in regulation of the hair growth cycle during synchronized hair follicle cycling, uncovering an unexpected connection between these two timing systems within skin. This work, therefore, indicates a role for circadian clock genes in a cyclical process of much longer periodicity <b>than</b> twenty <b>four</b> <b>hours...</b>|$|R
30|$|Phenol is an {{environmental}} pollutant; {{the present study}} was conducted to examine the adsorption of phenol by rice straw. For this purpose raw (untreated), physically treated (boiled and dried) and thermally treated (heated at 230  °C for 3  h to produce ash) rice straw were selected to determine phenol removal efficiency at different contact times and adsorbent dosages for 1 and < 1  mm rice straw particles. Residual phenol concentrations were determined by colorimetric method. Highest 84  % of phenol removal was observed for thermally treated < 1  mm rice straw particle. Equilibrium time was more <b>than</b> <b>four</b> <b>hour.</b> Percentage of removal of phenol increased as the adsorbent dose increase. The removal efficiency increase in the order of: raw rice straw < physically treated < thermally treated (ash) rice straw. Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm was developed for 1 and < 1  mm particle size of thermally (ash) treated rice straw. Freundlich isotherm best fit the equilibrium data for 1  mm thermally treated rice straw. The results showed that thermally treated rice straw (ash) can be developed as a potential adsorbent for phenol removal from aqueous solution.|$|R
