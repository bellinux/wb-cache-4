5|$|The figurine that {{is awarded}} to prize winners {{originated}} from a competition {{held by the}} local newspaper Haugesunds Avis in 1985, to create a sculpture of the legendary Amanda. The competition was won by Kristian Kvakland from Nesodden in Akershus. The full-size sculpture now stands outside the newspaper's office, but a miniature version was adopted as a trophy for the Amanda Award. The figurine is 30cm (11.81in) tall, with a skirt measuring 14cm (5.51in) in diameter. While the current sculpture is hollow and weighs 2.5kg (5.51lbs), {{for the first few}} years it was made of solid metal. Weighing in at 4.5kg (9.92lbs) it was difficult <b>to</b> <b>hoist</b> for many winners.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on 15 February, {{both the}} British and French forces raised their colours. Dance hoped to persuade Linois that his ships {{included}} some fully armed warships and he therefore ordered the brig Ganges {{and the four}} lead ships <b>to</b> <b>hoist</b> blue ensigns, {{while the rest of}} the convoy raised red ensigns. By the system of national flags then in use in British ships, this implied that the ships with blue ensigns were warships attached to the squadron of Admiral Rainier, while the others were merchant ships under their protection. Dance was unknowingly assisted by the information that had reached Linois at Batavia, which claimed that there were 23 merchant ships and the brig in the convoy. Dance had collected six additional ships during his journey, and the identity of these were unknown to the French, who assumed that at least some of the unidentified vessels must be warships, particularly as several vessels had been recently painted at Canton to resemble ships of the line.|$|E

5|$|In game {{three of}} the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, Horton {{suffered}} a devastating late hit by Vancouver Canucks defenseman Aaron Rome. Rome received a five-minute major for interference and a game misconduct. Horton was unresponsive as he was carried out on a stretcher and put into an ambulance. He was moving all his extremities in the ambulance. He was later diagnosed with a severe concussion and missed {{the remainder of the}} 2011 Stanley Cup Finals. This was arguably the turning point in the series, as the Bruins would go on to win 4 of the next 5 games, and score 21 of the next 25 goals after the hit. Rome was suspended for 4 games. Although Horton missed the remainder of the finals, he was able <b>to</b> <b>hoist</b> the Stanley Cup in Vancouver on June 15 after the Bruins won game 7.|$|E
5|$|The {{first major}} groups of {{amphibians}} {{developed in the}} Devonian period, around 370 million years ago, from lobe-finned fish which were similar to the modern coelacanth and lungfish. These ancient lobe-finned fish had evolved multi-jointed leg-like fins with digits that enabled them to crawl along the sea bottom. Some fish had developed primitive lungs to help them breathe air when the stagnant pools of the Devonian swamps were low in oxygen. They could also use their strong fins <b>to</b> <b>hoist</b> themselves {{out of the water}} and onto dry land if circumstances so required. Eventually, their bony fins would evolve into limbs and they would become the ancestors to all tetrapods, including modern amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Despite being able to crawl on land, many of these prehistoric tetrapodomorph fish still spent most of their time in the water. They had started to develop lungs, but still breathed predominantly with gills.|$|E
40|$|Material {{transportation}} for high-rise building construction {{relies heavily on}} tower cranes. Hence {{the proper use of}} tower cranes is of paramount importance for high-rise residential building construction. In planning and monitoring crane usage in Hong Kong, a schedule is usually prepared <b>to</b> coordinate <b>hoisting</b> operations. Apart from that, little research in optimizing crane usage has been carried out previously, except on operation cycle times, e. g. concreting using a crane and skip and formwork erection. Allocation of time for the hoisting schedule is based on the planners' and operators' experience. The accuracy of the hoisting schedule for crane dominated construction works has significant effects on the materials supply and on concreting operations. Imbalance in the allocation of crane usage for subcontractors may lead to conflicts between trades and idling of workers due to a shortage of materials. Although planners understand that the load hoisting time is proportional <b>to</b> <b>hoisting</b> height and other factors, floor construction cycles usually, for simplicity, are assigned to be constant six day, eight day or ten day cycles without making the necessary compensation for the longer hoisting times for upper floors. The prediction of hoisting times is of great importance to planners to ensure the accuracy of the construction schedule for crane dominated construction. This paper describes the derivation of a mathematical model <b>to</b> predict the <b>hoisting</b> times for a tower crane for public housing construction. Work measurement is used <b>to</b> collect <b>hoisting</b> times data for analysis. Twelve factors considered <b>to</b> influence <b>hoisting</b> time are identified for the model. Multiple regression models are built for predicting supply hoisting times and return hoisting times. The effects of the variables on hoisting time are reviewed. Estimated hoisting times calculated from the models are compared with actual hoisting times, and a worked example illustrating the application of the models is presented.

5|$|The {{raising of}} the British flags on Alexander and Canada {{was a clear}} {{indicator}} to Nielly that the British were aware of his identity, and he instead ordered his squadron <b>to</b> <b>hoist</b> the French tricolour, finally abandoning the ruse that his ships were British. During the preceding three hours, {{the division of the}} French squadron in pursuit of Alexander had steadily closed the gap between the ships, Alexander responding by firing stern-chasers at the pursuers. The French ships responded by firing their bow-chasers at the British vessel. At 09:00 Canada too came in range, Nielly ordering his flagship Marat to fire on the Hamilton's ship, the shot flying over the vessel and harmlessly into the sea. Hamilton responded with fire from his own stern-chasers and Bligh issued signals for Alexander and Canada to form a line, Canada in the lead, so that the British vessels might mutually support one another.|$|E

Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) convinces him that before he sells the boat, they should take it out for one last sunset cruise, and they drive to Stamford, Connecticut, where the boat is docked. Andy starts <b>to</b> <b>hoist</b> the main sail, but is stopped by a broker who is to sail it to the Caribbean for the buyer. With Erin's encouragement, Andy decides to take the boat to the Caribbean himself. He then finds his drunken brother Walter (Josh Groban) passed out in the liquor closet.

5|$|Broke himself led {{a charge}} against {{a number of}} the Americans who had managed to rally on the forecastle. Three American sailors, {{probably}} from the rigging, descended and attacked him. Taken by surprise, he killed the first, but the second hit him with a musket which stunned him, whilst the third sliced open his skull with his sabre, knocking him to the deck. Before the sailor could finish Broke off, the American was bayoneted by a British Marine named John Hill. Shannons crew rallied to the defence of their captain and carried the forecastle, killing the remaining Americans. Broke sat, dizzied and weak, on a carronade slide, and his head was bound up by William Mindham, who used his own neckerchief. One of Shannons lieutenants, Provo Wallis, believed that Broke's three assailants were probably British deserters. The desperate and violent attempt on Broke's life made by these men may have been motivated {{by the fact that they}} faced the death penalty under the Royal Navy's Articles of War as deserters. Meanwhile, Shannons First Lieutenant, Mr George T. L.

5|$|Having ascertained the {{identity}} of the ships Dance signalled for his merchants to form the line of battle, and continued their heading, while the French closed, but made no move to attack. Dance used the delay to gather his ships together so the stronger East Indiamen stood between the French and the weaker country ships. The merchants continued on towards the straits, followed by Linois, who was trying to gauge the strength of the convoy. There were more ships in the convoy than he had expected, and taken in by Dance's manoeuvres and the painted gunports, Linois suspected that several warships were escorting them. He seemed to be confirmed in his suspicions when at dawn on 15 February, both forces raised their colours. Dance ordered the brig Ganges and the four lead ships <b>to</b> <b>hoist</b> Blue Ensigns, {{while the rest of the}} convoy raised Red Ensigns.

5|$|On 30 May 1916, Engadine was {{attached}} to the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron, commanded by Rear Admiral Trevylyan Napier, and carried two Short Type 184 and two Sopwith Baby floatplanes aboard. The two-seat Type 184s were intended for observation and were fitted with a low-power wireless while the Babys were intended to shoot down Zeppelins. Engadine accompanied the cruisers when the Battlecruiser Fleet sortied from Rosyth that evening to intercept the German High Seas Fleet. For a time on 31 May she was actually leading the BCF and may {{have been one of the}} first ships to spot the oncoming Germans. Her position in the vanguard was dictated by the requirement for smooth water to successfully launch her aircraft; turbulent water from ships' wakes was enough to ruin a take off attempt. She would also have to come to a complete stop <b>to</b> <b>hoist</b> her aircraft over the side and prepare it for launch, a process that took at least 20 minutes at anchor. Thus she could launch her floatplane in unruffled water and then fall back among the main body of the fleet.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} traditions {{associated}} with the Stanley Cup. One of the oldest, started by the 1896 Winnipeg Victorias, dictates that the winning team drink champagne from the top bowl after their victory. The Cup is also traditionally presented on the ice to {{the captain of the}} winning team after the series-winning game; each member of the victorious club carries the trophy around the rink. However, this has not always been the case; prior to the 1930s, the Cup was not awarded immediately after the victory. The first time that the Cup was awarded on the ice may have been to the 1932 Toronto Maple Leafs, but the practice did not become a tradition until the 1950s. Ted Lindsay of the 1950Cup champion Detroit Red Wings became the first captain, upon receiving the Cup, <b>to</b> <b>hoist</b> it overhead and skate around the rink. According to Lindsay, he did so to allow the fans to have a better view of the Cup. Since then, it has been a tradition for each member of the winning team, beginning with the captain, to take a lap around the ice with the trophy hoisted above his head.|$|E
