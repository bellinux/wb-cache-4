60|$|We {{have given}} the pilgrims a good many {{examples}} that might benefit them, but it is virtue thrown away. They have never heard a cross word out of our lips toward each other--but they have quarreled once or twice. We love to hear them at it, {{after they have been}} lecturing us. The very first thing they did, coming ashore at Beirout, was to quarrel in the boat. I have said I like them, and I do like them--but every time they read me a scorcher of a lecture I mean <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>back</b> in print.|$|E
60|$|After a {{while the}} weather grew milder, and the clouds lifted somewhat. The troop ceased to shiver, and their spirits began to improve. They grew more and more cheerful, and finally began to chaff each other and insult {{passengers}} along the highway. This showed that they were awaking to an appreciation of life and its joys once more. The dread in which their sort was held was apparent {{in the fact that}} everybody gave them the road, and took their ribald insolences meekly, without venturing <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>back.</b> They snatched linen from the hedges, occasionally {{in full view of the}} owners, who made no protest, but only seemed grateful that they did not take the hedges, too.|$|E

60|$|I {{was sick}} for days afterward, and I needed {{none of my}} mother's {{injunctions}} to avoid John Barleycorn in the future. My mother had been dreadfully shocked. She held that I had done wrong, very wrong, and that I had gone contrary to all her teaching. And how was I, who was never allowed <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>back,</b> who lacked the very words with which to express my psychology--how was I to tell my mother {{that it was her}} teaching that was directly responsible for my drunkenness? Had it not been for her theories about dark eyes and Italian character, I should never have wet my lips with the sour, bitter wine. And not until man-grown did I tell her the true inwardness of that disgraceful affair.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was plain}} to Ken that {{not the least}} of Arthurs' {{troubles}} was the incessant gibing of the students on the platform. There was always a crowd watching the practice, noisy, scornful, abusive. They would never recover from the shock of having that seasoned champion varsity barred out of athletics. Every once in a while one of them would yell out: [...] "Wait, Worry! oh! Worry, wait till the old varsity plays your yanigans!" [...] And every time the coach's face would burn. But he had ceased <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>back</b> to the students. Besides, the athletic directors were always present. They mingled with the candidates and talked baseball to them and talked to Arthurs. Some of them might have played ball once, but they did not talk like it. Their advice and interference served only to make the coach's task harder.|$|E
60|$|Lord Marshmoreton had rallied {{from his}} initial panic. The spirit of revolt began to burn {{again in his}} bosom. Once the die is cast for revolution, {{there can be no}} looking back. One must defy, not apologize. Perhaps the {{inherited}} tendencies of a line of ancestors who, whatever their shortcomings, had at least known how to treat their women folk, came to his aid. Possibly there stood by his side in this crisis ghosts of dead and buried Marshmoretons, whispering spectral encouragement in his ear--the ghosts, let us suppose, of that earl who, {{in the days of the}} seventh Henry, had stabbed his wife with a dagger to cure her tendency to lecture him at night; or of that other earl who, at a previous date in the annals of the family, had caused two aunts and a sister to be poisoned apparently from a mere whim. At any rate, Lord Marshmoreton produced from some source sufficient courage <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E
6000|$|I {{found all}} this very uncomfortable, and tried <b>to</b> turn the <b>talk</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{a point that}} I felt curious about: [...] "But in Altruria, if the {{literary}} class is not exempt from the rule of manual labor, where do they find time and strength to write?" ...|$|R

60|$|Echoes, sir. His first {{purchase}} was an echo in Georgia that repeated four times; his next was a six-repeater in Maryland; his next was a thirteen-repeater in Maine; his next was a nine-repeater in Kansas; his next was a twelve-repeater in Tennessee, which he got cheap, so to speak, {{because it was}} out of repair, a portion of the crag which reflected it having tumbled down. He believed he could repair it at a cost of a few thousand dollars, and, by increasing the elevation with masonry, treble the repeating capacity; but the architect who undertook the job had never built an echo before, and so he utterly spoiled this one. Before he meddled with it, it used <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>back</b> like a mother-in-law, but now it was only fit for the deaf-and-dumb asylum. Well, next he bought a lot of cheap little double-barreled echoes, scattered around over various states and territories; he got them at twenty per cent. off by taking the lot. Next he bought a perfect Gatling-gun of an echo in Oregon, and it cost a fortune, I can tell you. You may know, sir, that in the echo market the scale of prices is cumulative, like the carat-scale in diamonds; in fact, the same phraseology is used. A single-carat echo is worth but ten dollars over and above the value of the land it is on; a two-carat or double-barreled echo is worth thirty dollars; a five-carat is worth nine hundred and fifty; a ten-carat is worth thirteen thousand. My uncle's Oregon-echo, which he called the Great Pitt Echo, was a twenty-two carat gem, and cost two hundred and sixteen thousand dollars--they threw the land in, for it was four hundred miles from a settlement.|$|E
6000|$|About a {{year later}} I got my chance. But I was not hunting for it. Goodman went off to San Francisco for a week's holiday, and left me to be chief editor. I had {{supposed}} that that was an easy berth, there being {{nothing to do but}} write one editorial per day; but I was disappointed in that superstition. I couldn't find anything to write an article about, the first day. Then {{it occurred to me that}} inasmuch as it was the 22nd of April, 1864, the next morning would be the three-hundredth anniversary of Shakespeare's birthday--and what better theme could I want than that? I got the Cyclop√¶dia and examined it, and found out who Shakespeare was and what he had done, and I borrowed all that and laid it before a community that couldn't have been better prepared for instruction about Shakespeare than if they had been prepared by art. There wasn't enough of what Shakespeare had done to make an editorial of the necessary length, but I filled it out with what he hadn't done--which in many respects was more important and striking and readable than the handsomest things he had really accomplished. But next day I was in trouble again. There were no more Shakespeares to work up. There was nothing in past history, or in the world's future possibilities, to make an editorial out of, suitable to that community; so there was but one theme left. That theme was Mr. Laird, proprietor of the Virginia [...] "Union." [...] His editor had gone off to San Francisco too, and Laird was trying his hand at editing. I woke up Mr. Laird with some courtesies of the kind that were fashionable among newspaper editors in that region, and he came back at me the next day in a most vitriolic way. He was hurt by something I had said about him--some little thing--I don't remember what it was now--probably called him a horse-thief, or one of those little phrases customarily used to describe another editor. They were no doubt just, and accurate, but Laird was a very sensitive creature, and he didn't like it. So we expected a challenge from Mr. Laird, because according to the rules--according to the etiquette of duelling as reconstructed and reorganized and improved by the duellists of that region--whenever you said a thing about another person that he didn't like, it wasn't sufficient for him <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>back</b> in the same offensive spirit: etiquette required him to send a challenge; so we waited for a challenge--waited all day. It didn't come. And as the day wore along, hour after hour, and no challenge came, the boys grew depressed. They lost heart. But I was cheerful; I felt better and better all the time. They couldn't understand it, but I could understand it. It was my make that enabled me to be cheerful when other people were despondent. So then it became necessary for us to waive etiquette and challenge Mr. Laird. When we reached that decision, they began to cheer up, but I began to lose some of my animation. However, in enterprises of this kind you are in the hands of your friends; there is nothing for you to do but to abide by what they consider to be the best course. Daggett wrote a challenge for me, for Daggett had the language--the right language--the convincing language--and I lacked it. Daggett poured out a stream of unsavory epithets upon Mr. Laird, charged with a vigor and venom of a strength calculated to persuade him; and Steve Gillis, my second, carried the challenge and came back to wait for the return. It didn't come. The boys were exasperated, but I kept my temper. Steve carried another challenge, hotter than the other, and we waited again. Nothing came of it. I began to feel quite comfortable. I began to take an interest in the challenges myself. I had not felt any before; but it seemed to me that I was accumulating a great and valuable reputation at no expense, and my delight in this grew and grew, as challenge after challenge was declined, until by midnight I was beginning to think that there was nothing in the world so much to be desired as a chance to fight a duel. So I hurried Daggett up; made him keep on sending challenge after challenge. Oh, well, I overdid it; Laird accepted. I might have known that that would happen--Laird was a man you couldn't depend on.|$|E
