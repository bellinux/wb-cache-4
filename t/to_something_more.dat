5|$|At {{the scene}} of the shooting, Scully reasons that at the short range from which Goodensnake was shot, it would have been {{impossible}} to mistake him for an animal. However, Mulder finds tracks leading to the area that appear to change from human <b>to</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> animal in nature. Scully dismisses this, but finds a large section of shed human skin nearby. She believes that the Parkers knowingly killed Goodensnake, but knows that they could not have skinned him since no signs of such injury were found on the body.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, around the {{coronation}} of Edward VII, a discussion started {{on the need for}} a heraldic symbol that was representative of the Indian empire. William Coldstream, a British member of the Indian Civil Service, campaigned the government to change the heraldic symbol from a star, which he considered to be a common choice, <b>to</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> appropriate. His proposal was not well received by the government; Lord Curzon rejected it for practical reasons including the multiplication of flags. Around this time, nationalist opinion within the dominion was leading to a representation through religious tradition. The symbols that were in vogue included the Ganesha, advocated by Bal Gangadhar Tilak, and Kali, advocated by Aurobindo Ghosh and Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay. Another symbol was the cow, or Gau Mata (cow mother). However, all these symbols were Hindu-centric and did not suggest unity with India's Muslim population.|$|E
5|$|Many of the fortifications at {{sea level}} have survived, though not always in their {{original}} condition. A substantial number have been built over. The Inundation was drained after World War II {{and is now the}} site of the Laguna Estate, named after the Inundation's lagoon. The glacis was likewise used as the foundations of the Glacis Estate. The flat ground of the retired batteries made them prime building spots during Gibraltar's post-war building boom, thus many of them have disappeared under recent developments. The city walls have almost entirely survived and are progressively being cleared of modern structures to restore them <b>to</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> like their original appearance. However, they are no longer at the water's edge due to extensive land reclamation. Various parts of the fortifications have been converted to civilian use. After being used for some years as a hostel for Moroccan migrant workers, the Grand Casemates Barracks have been renovated and converted into restaurants and shops. An electricity generating station was built inside the King's Bastion in the 1960s but has since been demolished and the bastion has been converted into a leisure centre.|$|E

When Benny protests this injustice, they beat him savagely.|$|E
25|$|Yeah sure, we see {{ourselves}} as a metal band, but without boundaries and limitations to our sound. We do not necessarily belong to a certain subgenre within metal. We're just playing dark and heavy music and keeping an open mind to evolve and being true to ourselves. I'm proud to say that I believe KATATONIA sounds like no other band. We have eloquently avoided the gothic metal genre most bands tend to fall in when changing their sound from doom/death metal <b>to</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> rocking and melodic. We're leaning towards more of a contemporary alternative sound, free of all cheese and clichés.|$|E
25|$|The {{characteristic}} of Edgeworth is to connect an identifiable strain of formal realism, both philosophical and rhetorical, and therefore display an objective interest {{in human nature}} {{and the way it}} manifests itself in social custom. One would expect this from Edgeworth, an author whose didacticism often has struck modern readers as either gendered liability, technical regression, or familial obligation. Critics have responded to Edgeworth's eccentricities by attributing them <b>to</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> deep-seated, temperamental, and psychological. In their various, often insightful representation, Edgeworth's fondness for the real, the strange, and the pedagogically useful verges on the relentless, the obsessive, and the instinctive. There is an alternative literary answer to explain Edgeworth's cultural roots and ideological aims which shifts focus away from Edgeworth's familial, psychological, and cultural predicaments to the formal paradigms by which her work has been judged. Rather than locating Edgeworth's early romances of real life exclusively within the traditions of eighteenth-century children's literature or domestic realism, they can be read primarily as responses to late eighteenth-century debates over the relation between history and romance, because the genre attempts to mediate between the two differentiating itself from other kinds of factual fiction. Edgeworth's romances of real life operate in the same discursive field but do not attempt to traverse between self-denied antinomies. In fact, they usually make the opposite claim.|$|E

25|$|The Númenóreans moved against Sauron, who {{saw that}} he could not defeat them by force and allowed himself to be taken as a {{prisoner}} to Númenor. There he quickly enthralled the king, Ar-Pharazôn, urging him to seek out the immortality that the Valar had apparently denied him, thus nurturing the seeds of envy that the Númenóreans had begun to hold against the Elves of the West and the Valar. So it was that all the knowledge and power of Númenor was turned towards seeking an avoidance of death; but this only weakened them and sped the gradual waning of the lifespans <b>to</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> similar to that of other Men. Sauron urged them to wage war against the Valar themselves to win immortality, and to worship his master Melkor, whom he said could grant them their wish. Ar-Pharazôn created the mightiest army and fleet Númenor had seen, and sailed against Aman. The Valar and Elves of Aman, stricken with grief over their betrayal, called on Ilúvatar for help. When Ar-Pharazôn landed, Ilúvatar destroyed his fleet and drowned Númenor itself as punishment for the rebellion against the rightful rule of the Valar. Ilúvatar created a great wave, such as had never before been seen, which utterly destroyed and submerged the isle of Númenor, killing all but those Dúnedain who had already sailed east, and changing the shape of all the lands of Middle-earth.|$|E
500|$|According to its chairman, by 2014, {{the club}} would be further renamed [...] "Hull Tigers," [...] because, as he claimed, [...] "in marketing, the shorter the name the more {{powerful}} ," [...] while [...] "Association Football Club" [...] made the name too long. Allam stated he dislikes the word [...] "City", as it is too [...] "common" [...] and a [...] "lousy identity", since it is associated also with other clubs, such as Leicester City, Bristol City and Manchester City. He told David Conn of The Guardian that [...] "in a few years many clubs will follow and change their names <b>to</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> interesting and I will have proved I am a leader," [...] adding {{that if he were}} the owner of Manchester City, he would change their name to [...] "Manchester Hunter." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode's plot {{originated}} from one which Lan O'Kun submitted entitled [...] "Love Beyond Time and Space", although at one point, the episode was called [...] "Eye of the Beholder". O'Kun's script {{was on the}} verge of being cut from the show when it was handed to Tracy Tormé for re-writes. Tormé later described it as a [...] "no-lose" [...] situation as he felt that O'Kun's script was so bad anything would be an improvement. Tormé changed the script from O'Kun's serious outline <b>to</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> comedic, although he felt that a lot of the comedy elements were later removed before filming. He didn't like the overall result, saying [...] "I didn't particularly like the episode when it first aired. It's still one of my least favourite shows that I've been involved with". Because of the work on the episode, Tormé was recruited as executive story editor.|$|E

500|$|The {{first two}} anime DVD volumes {{released}} by Media Blasters were also reviewed by Mania Entertainment. In {{the review of}} the first DVD, the reviewer Chris Beveridge felt the anime reminded him of [...] "parts of Princess Princess, especially {{when it came to the}} Elder status piece. It's even reminiscent of Strawberry Panic in this way." [...] The series is described as [...] "all about the [...] "moe" [...] factor, bringing about an atmosphere that makes you like the characters, care about them and feel good about seeing them interact. It does it well even if it doesn’t have an amazing hook." [...] For the second DVD volume, Beveridge commented that the series continues to be [...] "very predictable and bland" [...] which is [...] "at this point fun but entirely forgettable." [...] Beveridge also wrote how [...] "the characters are all pleasant, nicely designed and with mildly interesting personalities that could lead <b>to</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> but never does." ...|$|E
500|$|When Wagner {{returned}} to writing {{the music for}} the last act of Siegfried and for Götterdämmerung (Twilight of the Gods), as the final part of the Ring, his style had changed once more <b>to</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> recognisable as [...] "operatic" [...] than the aural world of Rheingold and Walküre, though it was still thoroughly stamped with his own originality as a composer and suffused with leitmotifs. This was {{in part because the}} libretti of the four Ring operas had been written in reverse order, so that the book for Götterdämmerung was conceived more [...] "traditionally" [...] than that of Rheingold; still, the self-imposed strictures of the Gesamtkunstwerk had become relaxed. The differences also result from Wagner's development as a composer during the period in which he wrote Tristan, Meistersinger and the Paris version of Tannhäuser. From act 3 of Siegfried onwards, the Ring becomes more chromatic melodically, more complex harmonically and more developmental in its treatment of leitmotifs.|$|E

[...] At Syfy.co.uk, the episode was listed as the seventh best episode in their list of the top 10 Buffy episodes, saying [...] "This surreal episode marks the show's turning point, as it moved from a very well-executed urban fantasy drama series <b>to</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> creative, more thoughtful, and more surprising than pretty much anything else on television." [...] In The Futon Critic's list of the 20 best episodes of 2000, the episode was placed at #1, with the author calling it an even more daring episode than [...] "Hush", another acclaimed episode from the fourth season.|$|E

500|$|The CP+B {{produced}} Coq Roq advertisements {{followed a}} pattern of controversy for the company, as previous advertisements produced by CP+B had come under fire for perceived or overt sexual innuendo. An earlier example {{of this type of}} advertisement was a promotion for a LTO version of Burger King's TenderCrisp sandwich which featured Darius Rucker in a commercial singing a variant of Burger King's Have It Your Way jingle that featured a line about [...] "a train of ladies with a nice caboose," [...] where caboose was not referring to the last car of a train, but the buttocks of the actresses featured in the commercial. The issues raised by public interest groups in this instance came from complaints over the double entendres and sexual innuendo on the Coq Roq website. Pictures of scantily clad women posing as groupies of the band were featured in one section of the site and sported comments such as [...] "groupies love the Coq" [...] and [...] "Groupies love Coq". Protests from the public over the sexual innuendo of the comments forced BK to request CB+P to have content be changed <b>to</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> appropriate for a family oriented restaurant.|$|E
500|$|The stereo {{version of}} the song has an organ moving from speaker to speaker; the effect is lost on the mono {{version of the}} song, where it simply gains an extra organ and guitar sound. However, the organ is very {{prominent}} during the first 50 seconds of the mono version—along with some special effects—but inaudible in the stereo mix until the improvised section. Five takes of the song were originally recorded on 27 February 1967, with a sixth later recorded on 16 March 1967, {{in an attempt to}} create a shorter version, with overdubs in June of that year, the Piper version also appears on the official compilation albums Relics and A Nice Pair. Despite Smith trying to bring the rest of the album's tracks from a jam-long length <b>to</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> manageable, Smith relented for [...] "Interstellar Overdrive", as Jenner recalled: [...] "It was definitely the deal that—hey, here you can do 'Interstellar Overdrive', you can do what you like, you can do your weird shit. So 'Interstellar Overdrive' was the weird shit [...] [...] [...] and again, hats off to Norman for letting them do that." [...] A delay effect was created by producer Norman Smith by superimposing a second version of the song over a previous version. Smith played the drum roll on the song. After the drum roll, the opening riff is played with severe stereo panning.|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} B-stage, U2 often played [...] "Bad" [...] or [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday", with {{performances}} of [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky" [...] and [...] "Running to Stand Still" [...] following. For [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky", the video screens displayed burning crosses and swastikas. During [...] "Running to Stand Still", Bono mimed {{the actions of}} a heroin addict from the B-stage, rolling up his sleeves and then pretending to spike his arm during the final lyric. Afterwards, red and yellow smoke flares ignited from either end of the B-stage, before the band re-grouped on the main stage for U2 classics played straight. [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] was accompanied by sped-up video of the group in the desert from The Joshua Trees photo shoot. U2 often finished their set with [...] "Pride (In the Name of Love)" [...] while a clip from Martin Luther King, Jr.'s famed [...] "I've Been to the Mountaintop" [...] speech was played on the video screens. The group was initially unconvinced that the leap {{from the rest of the}} show's irony and artifice <b>to</b> <b>something</b> <b>more</b> sincere would be successful, but they thought that it was important to demonstrate that certain ideals were so strong and true that they could be held onto no matter the circumstance. The group alternated performances of [...] "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" [...] in acoustic form on the B-stage with using it to close the main set.|$|E
