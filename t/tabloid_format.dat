Partially in response to declining circulation and the struggle to earn a profit, the church's directors and the manager of the Christian Science Publishing Society were purportedly forced to plan cutbacks and closures (later denied), which led in 1989 to the mass protest resignations by its chief editor Kay Fanning (an ASNE president and former editor of the Anchorage Daily News), managing editor David Anable, associate editor David Winder, and several other newsroom staff. These developments also presaged administrative moves to scale back the print newspaper in favor of expansions into radio, a magazine, shortwave broadcasting, and television. Expenses, however, rapidly outpaced revenues, contradicting predictions by church directors. On the brink of bankruptcy, the board was forced to close the broadcast programs in 1992.|$|E

[...] Soon Haydn Dimmock, Scoops editor, began to receive more sophisticated stories, targeted at an adult audience; he tried to change the magazine's focus to include more mature fiction, but within twenty issues falling sales led Pearson's to kill the magazine. [...] The failure of Scoops gave British publishers the impression that Britain could not support a science fiction publication.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the influence of an emotionally arousing writing style – as it is common in <b>tabloid</b> <b>formats</b> – on attitude formation and attitude change. It was proposed that different writing styles induce attitudes based on either affect or cognition as well as attitudes with either high or low certainty. Further, it was proposed that the interplay of these attitude characteristics determines the persuasiveness of emotionally and rationally framed persuasion. To test the hypotheses, participants in an experimental study read articles form a magazine about a fictitious attitude object. In the first step, four different types of attitudes varying in attitude basis and attitude certainty were induced through a respectively manipulated article. In the second step, this attitude was affected by a further article, which presented either an emotionally or rationally framed persuasive appeal. The hypotheses on attitude induction through media stimuli as well as three of four hypotheses regarding the persuasiveness of emotionally and rationally framed articles were supported...|$|R
