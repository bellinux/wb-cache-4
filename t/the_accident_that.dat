Construction work was halted after the accident on the orders of Fayette Circuit Judge Pamela Goodwine in order to preserve evidence in the crash pending the inspection by safety experts and attorneys for the families of the victims.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí's {{personal}} appearance—Nordic features, {{blond hair}} and blue eyes—changed radically {{over the course of}} time. As a young man, he dressed like a dandy in costly suits, sporting well-groomed hair and beard, indulging gourmet taste, making frequent visits to the theatre and the opera and visiting his project sites in a horse carriage. The older Gaudí ate frugally, dressed in old, worn-out suits, and neglected his appearance to the extent that sometimes he was taken for a beggar, such as after <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> <b>that</b> caused his death.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>accident</b> <b>that</b> {{would take}} the life of Samuel Collyer came in July 1884. While {{responding}} to the fire alarm, hose carriage number one struck an upright stone post on the corner on Mineral Spring and Lonsdale Avenue and tipped over. All six firefighters were injured in the accident, those less seriously were on the step and seat of the carriage, but Collyer who rode on the reel was crushed underneath. Collyer sustained a punctured lung and broken ribs, but managed to survive for almost three weeks before succumbing to his injuries. Contemporary accounts state that the funeral service and procession were the most elaborate of any in the town's history. Collyer's home, known as the Potter-Collyer House, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.|$|E

25|$|M.M.C. captain Freddie Brown, and a {{joint manager}} of the team, Brigadier M. A. Green, were injured in a car {{accident}} on North Terrace, city, last night. Brigadier Green was admitted to the Royal Adelaide Hospital in a semi-conscious condition, suffering from a probable fractured nose, and Brown was treated for cuts to the head and left knee. Brown, who had four stitches inserted in his left knee and two in his head, is reported to have said soon after <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> <b>that</b> he would play today. Doctors at the hospital, however, think it is doubtful, because he will be suffering from stiffness. Brown told the police that he was driving along North Terrace when he swerved to avoid another car. In doing so he crashed head-on into a tram standard {{in the middle of the}} road.|$|E
25|$|On many occasions, Doom’s {{only real}} {{weakness}} {{has been his}} arrogance. Layla Miller once reflected that Doom is incapable of accepting that he himself might be {{the reason for his}} failures. This is most keenly reflected in Doom’s continued refusal to accept responsibility for <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> <b>that</b> fully scarred his face, instead preferring to blame Reed Richards for sabotaging his experiment. While his high opinion of himself is generally accurate, he is generally unable to accept when others may {{have a better understanding of}} a situation than he does – with the occasional exception of hearing the recommendations of heroes such as Mister Fantastic or the Thing when it is to his advantage. Even when teaming up with others against a greater threat, Doom will often try to subvert the alliance for personal gain. For instance, while allied with Adam Warlock and other heroes against the Titan Thanos, he attempted to steal Thanos’ Infinity Gauntlet before its owner had been defeated.|$|E

In 2008, the BBC published an article that was based on its examination of partly declassified documents obtained some years earlier, via the United States Freedom of Information Act. The documents appeared to confirm that within weeks of the accident, investigators realized only three of the weapons could be accounted for. One of the declassified documents—dated to January 1968—details a blackened section of ice which had refrozen with shroud lines from a weapon parachute: [...] "Speculate something melted through the ice such as burning primary or secondary."

40|$|Half of all Swedish {{forests are}} owned by private individuals, and at least 215 000 people work in these privately owned forest holdings. However, only lethal {{accidents}} are systematically monitored among self-employed forest workers. Therefore, data from the registries of the Swedish Work Environment Authority, the Labor Insurance Organization and the regional University Hospital in Umeå were gathered {{to allow us to}} perform a more in-depth assessment of the rate and types of <b>accidents</b> <b>that</b> occurred among private forest owners. We found large differences between the registries in the type and number of <b>accidents</b> <b>that</b> were reported. We encountered difficulties in defining “self-employed forest worker” and also in determining whether <b>the</b> <b>accidents</b> <b>that</b> did occur happened during work or leisure time. Consequently, the estimates for <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> rate <b>that</b> we obtained varied from 32 to > 4300 injured persons per year in Sweden, depending on the registry that was consulted, the definition of the sample population that was used, and <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> severity definition <b>that</b> was employed.

500|$|Gabriel Luna, who portrays Reyes, {{explained}} {{at the end}} of October 2016 {{that the}} confrontation between his character and the last member of the Fifth Street Locos gang in the episode [...] "Lockup" [...] revealed to Reyes that <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> <b>that</b> caused him to become Ghost Rider [...] "wasn’t just random, it was a hit, somebody ordered that, these guys were just the guys who carried it out—there’s a whole batch of new questions that Robbie has after that. In episode 6, we’re going to find out exactly how it happened, and we may find out why later." [...] Luna said that the series' take on Reyes' origin story would mix elements from Felipe Smith's original comic with [...] "this new angle that we’re approaching from, but that new angle still draws from the source material." [...] He also felt the episode's approach to revealing the story, by having Reyes tell it to his brother Gabe for the first time, was [...] "really interesting and powerful" [...] and the most surprising aspect of the script for him.|$|E
500|$|Two {{days after}} the sinking, on 11 February, U.S. President George W. Bush apologized for the {{accident}} on national television, stating, [...] "I want to reiterate what I said {{to the prime minister}} of Japan: [...] I'm deeply sorry about <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> <b>that</b> took place; our nation is sorry." [...] Secretary of State Colin Powell and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld also publicly apologized. [...] The U.S. ambassador to Japan, Tom Foley, personally apologized to both Prime Minister Mori and to the Emperor of Japan. The public apologies to the Japanese from the highest American officials stirred resentment among some American veterans of the Pacific War and their families, as well as among Asian victims of Imperial Japanese aggression and occupation. Richard Cohen wrote a column in the Washington Post, saying [...] "We've Apologized Enough to Japan", denounced the [...] "hypocrisy" [...] of Japan's recent gestures of compensation and remorse to some of its World War II victims, which he said were offered [...] "grudgingly", while noting that the U.S. had apologized profusely over the accidental collision.|$|E
500|$|On March 6, 2007, in Beaumont, Texas, Richardson's {{body was}} exhumed for reburial {{in a more}} fitting part of the local Forest Lawn cemetery. The musician's son, Jay Perry, took the {{opportunity}} to have his father's body re-examined to verify the original findings, and asked forensic anthropologist William Bass to carry out the procedure. [...] Among the rumors surrounding <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> <b>that</b> this second examination sought to verify was that an accidental firearm discharge took place on board the aircraft and caused the crash, since two months after the event, a farmer had found at the crash site a [...]22 (5.6mm) pistol known to have belonged to Buddy Holly. Another rumor had Richardson surviving the initial impact and crawling out of the aircraft in search for help, prompted by the fact that his body was found farther from the wreckage than the other three. [...] Bass and his team took several X-rays of Richardson's body and eventually concluded that the musician had indeed died instantly from extensive, nonsurvivable fractures to almost all of his bones; no traces of lead were found from any bullet. Coroner Smiley's original report was, therefore, confirmed.|$|E

500|$|The only {{fatality}} on the Central Link project {{occurred on}} February 7, 2007 near the west portal of the northbound Beacon Hill Tunnel, where 49-year-old mechanic Michael Merryman was thrown from a supply train after it collided with an unoccupied locomotive, also injuring another worker who {{was released from}} a local hospital the following day with minor injuries. The accident prompted the public release of an ongoing Sound Transit audit of Obayashi {{in addition to an}} investigation led by the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries into workplace safety at the tunnel site. The Sound Transit audit, which began after a previous supply train accident the previous October, released a report days after <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> <b>that</b> recommended unannounced brake inspections and criticized Obayashi's Beacon Hill managers for not participating in safety meetings and inspections; the report also blamed frequent employee turnover for the lack of safety awareness. Obayashi was fined $29,000 for the accident in addition to other workplace violations, ranging from failure to properly train the workers operating the supply trains to a lack of a bumper stop to prevent train collisions. Another controversy emerged during tunnel construction shortly after work began in December 2004, when caustic mud found at a landfill was traced back to the Beacon Hill Tunnel project by a state inspection. The contamination was determined to have originated in the jet grout, a highly alkaline substance, used to solidify dirt around the vertical station shafts during the early stages of station construction. Obayashi decontaminated nearly [...] of dirt and debris dumped at a sand mine in Maple Valley at a cost of $2.4 million.|$|E
500|$|Seven days of {{pre-production}} {{began on}} August 15, 1997. On the first day, Fleder met with Yoshimura and Fontana {{to discuss the}} script and the director's vision for the episode. Fleder suggested modifying the prologue, and storyboarded the introduction which {{was included in the}} episode. The new prologue involved commuters coming down to the train station while a street band performed, leading up to the subway accident before the opening credits rolled. The song featured in this prologue, [...] "Killing Time", was written by Lisa Matthews, the lead singer of the Baltimore-area band Love Riot. Matthews also had a brief cameo on [...] "Subway" [...] as one of the witnesses to Lange's fall. On August 16, the show creators scouted out the Johns Hopkins Hospital Metro Subway Station, where the episode was to be filmed. At the request of the authority, the subway was renamed the fictional Inner Harbor station during filming. Fleder himself had only one hour to scout the location with his technical crew. Art director Vincent Peranio created a dummy wall to place in the empty space between two subway cars, making it appear that the two trains were one big car. Inside the dummy wall was a space in which the actor could stand and appear cut. Stunt coordinator G.A. Aguilar also choreographed <b>the</b> <b>accident</b> <b>that</b> day, and Peranio simulated the accident itself by tying a dummy into the hole in the dummy wall. Peranio originally wanted a stuntman to fall against the moving train, spin and fall into the padded hole in the dummy wall, but the transit authority refused to allow it.|$|E
