30|$|Anticoagulation clinics (ACCs) are {{specialty}} {{clinics that}} manage patients with blood clotting problems. Since labor costs usually {{account for a}} substantial portion of a healthcare organization’s budget, optimizing the number and types of staff required was often the focus, especially for ACCs, where labor-intensive staff-patient interactions occur. A significant portion of tasks performed by clinical pharmacists might be completed by clinical pharmacist technicians, which are less-expensive resources. While nurse staffing models for a hospital inpatient unit are well established, these models are not readily applicable to staffing ACCs. Therefore, the objective {{of this paper is to}} develop a framework for determining <b>the</b> <b>right</b> staff <b>mix</b> <b>of</b> clinical pharmacists and clinical pharmacy technicians that increases the efficiency of care delivery process and improves the productivity of ACC staff. A framework is developed and applied to build a semi-automated full-time equivalent (FTE) calculator and compare various staffing scenarios using a simulation model. The FTE calculator provides <b>the</b> <b>right</b> staff <b>mix</b> for a given staff utilization target. Data collected from the ACCs at VA Boston Healthcare System is used to illustrate the FTE calculator and the simulation model. The result of the simulation model can be used by ACC managers to easily determine the number of FTEs of clinical pharmacists and clinical pharmacy technicians required to reach the target utilization and the corresponding staffing cost.|$|R

Background The nurse practitioner/advanced practice nurse has the advanced, complex skills and experience {{to play an important}} role in providing equitable health care across all nations. Introduction Key factors that contribute to health disparities include lack of access to global health human resources, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> skill <b>mix</b> <b>of</b> healthcare providers and the satisfaction and retention of quality workers. Methods The study utilized a descriptive analysis and cross-sectional survey methodology with quantitative and qualitative sections of 1419 job satisfaction survey respondents from an online survey. Results Age, number of hours worked in a week and length of time that nurse practitioners/advanced practice nurses worked in their current jobs were statistically significant in job satisfaction. A key barrier was the lack of respect from supervisors and physicians. Discussion It was clear from the number of comments in the qualitative section of the survey that having a wide scope of practice is rewarding and challenging to the nurse practitioner and advanced practice nurse.
