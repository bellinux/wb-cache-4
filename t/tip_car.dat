40|$|The act of {{guarding}} {{a car at}} {{a public}} parking space is a common service offered by "car guards" in Southern Africa. The car guard normally relies solely on tips {{in return for the}} service given. The objective of this research study is to better understand the predictors of consumer tipping decisions. More specifically this study examines, from a consumer decision making perspective, the role that service quality, personal norms and social norms play in determining a consumers' decision to <b>tip</b> <b>car</b> guards. The results showed that service quality and personal norms were significant predictors of tip size, while social norms are not significant predictors of tip size. The study discusses the theoretical and practical implications of these findings...|$|E
40|$|From a {{mainstream}} economic perspective, tipping {{is often seen}} as a rather anomalous or irrational economic activity since consumers could legally and willingly avoid paying tips altogether. Nevertheless, this pervasive economic activity generates {{tens of billions of}} dollars in income a year, worldwide. In order to better understand this seemingly irrational behavior to tip, this study investigates other potential motives for tipping that draw from the behavioral economics and psychology literature. We test several of these motives in the context of <b>tipping</b> <b>car</b> guards in South Africa and find evidence supporting the ideas that tipping is motivated by desires to: reward good quality service, help service workers, and gain social approval. <b>Tipping</b> <b>Car</b> guard Service quality Gratuity Social norm...|$|R

However, the [...] "send all" [...] button he pressed {{actually}} sends the invite to absolutely every alien race in the entire universe including the Gorg. Everyone, aggravated with Oh for revealing their location to the enemy, starts chasing him down. Oh runs into a convenience store to hide just as Tip and Pig enter the same store to grab supplies. They come across each other, and after <b>Tip's</b> <b>car</b> fails to start, Oh transforms it into a fantastical, hovering craft named Slushious to continue transportation. Oh hitches a ride with Tip when he promises to help her find Lucy, but unfortunately, they must to go to the Boov Command Center in Paris and locate her from there.|$|R

5000|$|A {{spreader}} {{is a type}} {{of maintenance}} equipment designed to spread or shape ballast profiles. The spreader spreads gravel along the railroad ties.

Enzo is out campaigning for Marty, telling them that longshoreman work is only less dangerous than lumberjack work. Rocky’s men stop workers from asking Enzo any questions. Marty realizes that Rocky’s men are hindering them from gaining the trust of the workers. He shows Marty the pier beneath which the last clean union candidate’s body was found.

Enzo makes the speech, Rocky spits in his face, and the workers desert him. Marty goes to Rocky’s place and calls him a punk to his face. He advises Rocky to apologize to Enzo if he wants a good name in the neighborhood. He shakes Enzo’s hand and the people are amazed.|$|R

25|$|In {{common with}} all {{contemporary}} Formula One designs, the FW30's basic architecture {{is built around}} a carbon fibre, aramid and honeycomb composite material monocoque. The design carries over the FW29's zero keel, double wishbone suspension arrangement, along with the twin-pillar rear wing. The FW30's front wing is one {{area in which the}} design of the FW29 was not followed. In place of the older car's two-element wing a three-element design was introduced, similar to that used on the 2007 McLaren MP4-22. As with the McLaren design the Williams wing's upper element features a central section that is raised up and passes over the <b>tip</b> of the <b>car's,</b> slightly lower, nose cone.

50|$|Despite {{their low}} intelligence, the two mutant's {{incredible}} physical strength {{made them more}} than a match for the Turtles. On their first encounter at Shredder and Tatsu's junkyard base, the Turtles were ill-prepared and barely managed to escape when trying to save their brother Raphael from capture and rescue Dr. Perry. During the escape they trapped Tokka in a manhole from the waist down. Michaelangelo teased Tokka and tickled {{the bottom of the}} snapper's clawed feet. Later that night, Shredder let them loose in the city, telling to 'go play', which they did by <b>tipping</b> over <b>cars,</b> knocking down telephone poles, and trashing buildings. After doing a report on the devastation the next day, April O'Neil was confronted by the Foot with a message for the Turtles: If they didn't meet the Foot at a construction site near the docks that night, Shredder would set Tokka and Rahzar out again into Central Park. As many people would get hurt, the Turtles and Splinter agreed that there was no other choice but to face Shredder, regardless of their disadvantage against Tokka and Rahzar's immense strength. However, the professor had a plan; with the help of Donatello and Keno and using the contamination is the ooze that mutated Tokka and Rahzar as a basis, Dr. Perry prepared an anti-mutagen to de-mutate them, which had to be ingested.|$|R
40|$|Highly {{qualified}} Instructor / Teaching Assistant {{teams are}} needed to teach a class of approximately 18 academically-gifted students in grades 7 - 10 each week between Monday morning and Saturday afternoon. Instructors are responsible for designing and teaching a challenging course, planning and supervising the activities of a teaching assistant, and evaluating each student in the class. In addition to daily classroom duties, teaching assistants facilitate an evening study period after dinner Monday through Thursday. Both positions require that the candidate be able to demonstrate depth of knowledge in subject matter related to marine biology, marine zoology, or oceanography. The instructor position requires {{at least a year}} of graduate coursework and/or teaching experience, while the teaching assistant position requires completion of at least two years of undergraduate coursework. Due to the small size of this site and the likelihood of field trips, there is also a driving requirement. Eligible drivers must possess a valid driver’s license, be at least 21 years old, submit an approved driving record, and be willing to drive students in Duke <b>TIP</b> vehicles (<b>cars,</b> minivans, and eight-passenger SUVs). Additionally, applicants must possess a genuine interest in the academic, social, and emotional growth of adolescents and a willingness to work cooperatively with others.

Next is a shot of empty infirmary beds followed by a view of two empty chairs in a white room. A motionless Pink fades into the chair on the left, with his nude wife fading into the right chair a short time later. After turning her {{head to look at}} her unresponsive husband, she fades out of the scene, which shifts to a montage of rioting scenes, with people <b>tipping</b> over <b>cars</b> and throwing Molotov cocktails at riot police. After the montage, a hand is shown clawing at a window (the colour version of this is actually shown at the end of [...] "The Trial") followed by a large group of maggots (the [...] "worms" [...] eating into Pink's brain). After a shot of Pink in an infirmary bed and his screaming wife superimposed over the image, the scene takes back to the riot, where a long line of police officers hold back a mob of rioters who have barricaded themselves behind a pile of desks and mattresses. The scene ends with Pink against his wall, having given up on finding a way out.|$|R

That being the case, Mojos on-air personalities were encouraged to be risque and push the envelope. Corus further obtained radio broadcasting rights of the Toronto Maple Leafs games, programming much of Mojos schedule around them with added content such as analysis shows like Leafs Lunch.|$|R
