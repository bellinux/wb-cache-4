5|$|The band plead {{not guilty}} on the charges. A Polish {{interpreter}} explained the court proceedings to <b>the</b> <b>musicians</b> over a speakerphone {{after which they}} entered their pleas in English.

Finally, the stage attendants are garbed in virtually unadorned black garments, much {{in the same way}} as stagehands in contemporary Western theatre.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>musicians</b> at the {{sessions}} were recruited by Shambhu Das, who had assisted in Harrison's sitar tuition on his previous visit to Bombay, in 1966, and Vijay Dubey, {{the head of}} A for HMV Records in India. The line-up on the track was Aashish Khan (sarod), Mahapurush Misra (pakhavaj), Hanuman Jadev (shehnai), Hariprasad Chaurasia (bansuri) and Rijram Desad (harmonium). In Lavezzoli's estimation, although these instruments are more commonly associated with the Hindustani discipline, the performers play them in a South Indian style, which adds to the Carnatic identity of the song. The recording features tabla tarang over the quiet, vocal interludes. Author Simon Leng refutes {{the presence of the}} oboe-like shehnai, however, saying that this part was played on an esraj, a bow-played string instrument. As with the Wonderwall selections recorded at HMV, Harrison directed <b>the</b> <b>musicians</b> but did not perform on the instrumental track.|$|E
5|$|Although the sextet had {{declined}} after 1986, in 1990 {{they got together}} to record Zyryab, a groundbreaking Arabic flamenco/jazz album with jazz pianist Chick Corea and fellow virtuoso flamenco guitarist Manolo Sanlúcar. The album is named after Ziryab, an 8th–9th century Shiraz-born poet/musician at the Umayyad court in Córdoba, credited with introducing to Spain the Persian lute, which evolved into the Spanish guitar—and according to some, established flamenco itself. One track on the album, a tarantas, is dedicated to Sabicas. The album was critically well-received; Jazz Times praised the passion and rhythm of <b>the</b> <b>musicians</b> featuring on the album.|$|E
5|$|Among <b>the</b> <b>musicians</b> {{who were}} quick to spot Saint-Saëns's talent were the composers Gioachino Rossini, Hector Berlioz and Franz Liszt, and the {{influential}} singer Pauline Viardot, who all encouraged him in his career. In early 1858 Saint-Saëns moved from Saint-Merri to the high-profile post of organist of La Madeleine, the official church of the Empire; Liszt heard him playing there and declared him the greatest organist in the world.|$|E

5|$|Arthur Fiacco, a cellist, {{arrived at}} Carriage House first. He {{was dressed in}} formal black and white attire, having {{traveled}} from an afternoon concert. Fiacco {{was surprised to find}} there were no scores written for <b>the</b> <b>musicians</b> to play; he then wrote a part based on riffs Francis had shown him. The violinists, Corinne Metter and Karen Karlsrud, also followed the directions of Francis and Norton. Another cellist, Ann Rorich, credited on the album and single, was sent home; according to Fiacco he doubled her parts.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of his career, comedian Spede Pasanen asked Vainio and his friends to play in a radio show called Ruljanssiriihi ("Thrashing House of Rigmarole").

They played in Pasanen's shows including Speden saluuna ("Spede's Saloon") and 50 pientä minuuttia ("50 Small Minutes").|$|E
5|$|At {{this time}} in the United States, McCarthyism was at its height, {{generating}} fear and suspicion of entertainment industry figures, academics, military figures, and government officials by accusing them of real or suggested links to communist activities. The TSO was required to submit to United States immigration authorities all the names of its musicians and other staff who would be accompanying the tour. The immigration department approved visas for all but seven musicians, suspecting them of communist activities. One of <b>the</b> <b>musicians</b> was later cleared, leaving six musicians who were denied entry.|$|E

5|$|Beyond the {{decorative}} {{features of the}} building, the 5th Avenue Theatre also contained notable technical features when originally built. An ascending orchestra pit and independent Wurlitzer organ platform allowed <b>the</b> <b>musicians</b> to be raised up to main stage height or to orchestra pit level from the basement below. The ventilation system had thermostatic controls throughout the building, and allowed the air to be 'washed' prior to its introduction into the venue at outlets under every third seat.|$|E
5|$|Following {{multiple}} {{changes in}} personnel {{after the release}} of Last Splash (1993), singer and songwriter Kim Deal was the only remaining constant member of the Breeders by 1996.

5|$|In 1996, American guitarist Ry Cooder {{had been}} invited to Havana by British world music {{producer}} Nick Gold of World Circuit Records to record a session in which African musicians from Mali were to collaborate with Cuban musicians. On Cooder's arrival (via Mexico to avoid the ongoing U.S. trade and travel embargo against Cuba), it transpired that <b>the</b> <b>musicians</b> from Mali had not received their visas and were unable to travel to Havana. Cooder and Gold changed their plans and decided to record an album of Cuban son music with local musicians.|$|E
5|$|Juha Vainio became {{interested}} in music and started socializing with musicians in the mid-1950s. The centre of jazz music in Kotka was the restaurant Fennia where performers including Keijo Laitinen and the cousin of Vainio's mother, Olli Miettinen played. Although Vainio was under-21 and classed as a minor, he managed to slip into the restaurant where he presented his lyrics to <b>the</b> <b>musicians</b> and was occasionally allowed to play the piano. Vainio recalled that his friends remembered him as being always penniless. He started drinking more and more, often asking his friends for a drink.|$|E
