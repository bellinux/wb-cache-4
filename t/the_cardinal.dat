5|$|During the sede vacante, as {{the papal}} vacancy is known, certain limited powers {{pass to the}} College of Cardinals, which is convoked by the Dean of the College of Cardinals. All {{cardinals}} are obliged to attend the General Congregation of Cardinals, except those whose health does not permit, or who are over eighty (but those cardinals may choose to attend if they please). The Particular Congregation, which deals with the day-to-day matters of the Church, includes <b>the</b> <b>Cardinal</b> Camerlengo and the three Cardinal Assistants—one Cardinal-Bishop, one Cardinal-Priest and one Cardinal-Deacon—chosen by lot. Every three days, new Cardinal Assistants are chosen by lot. <b>The</b> <b>Cardinal</b> Camerlengo and Cardinal Assistants are responsible, among other things, for maintaining the election's secrecy.|$|E

Although <b>the</b> <b>Cardinals</b> and <b>the</b> Washington Redskins finished with identical 10-4 records, <b>the</b> <b>Cardinals</b> won <b>the</b> NFC East title, because of their two victories over Washington that season.|$|R
5|$|In 1151, David again {{requested}} a pallium for the Archbishop of St Andrews. Cardinal John Paparo met David at his residence of Carlisle in September 1151. Tantalisingly for David, <b>the</b> <b>Cardinal</b> {{was on his}} way to Ireland with four pallia to create four new Irish archbishoprics. When <b>the</b> <b>Cardinal</b> returned to Carlisle, David made the request. In David's plan, the new archdiocese would include all the bishoprics in David's Scottish territory, as well as bishopric of Orkney and the bishopric of the Isles. Unfortunately for David, <b>the</b> <b>Cardinal</b> does not appear to have brought the issue up with the papacy. In the following year the papacy dealt David another blow by creating the archbishopric of Trondheim, a new Norwegian archbishopric embracing the bishoprics of the Isles and Orkney.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cardinal</b> {{opened the}} season by {{defeating}} Football Bowl Subdivision team Sacramento State, then beat conference opponent UCLA in the first Pacific-10 game of the season. The win over Sacramento State pushed Stanford to No. 25 nationally, and the win over UCLA raised Stanford to No. 19, the rank it held when it defeated Atlantic Coast Conference foe Wake Forest 68–24 on September 18. The following week, Stanford defeated Notre Dame as the nation's No. 16 team, and the win raised <b>the</b> <b>Cardinal</b> to No. 9.|$|E
5|$|The Trojans next {{faced the}} Stanford Cardinal. Though <b>the</b> <b>Cardinal</b> {{were the last}} team to beat the Trojans at home back in 2001, they were {{slightly}} struggling under first–year head coach Walt Harris and quarterback Trent Edwards with a 4–3 record. The Trojans jumped to an early lead with a LenDale White rushing touchdown, a Reggie Bush rushing touchdown, a Leinart touchdown pass to White, and a Mario Danelo field goal. With a 24-point lead, Leinart threw two more touchdown passes before Edwards passed for the first Cardinal touchdown of the game. Leinart's fourth touchdown pass came with threeminutes left in the half to give the Trojans a 44–7 half-time lead. <b>The</b> <b>Cardinal</b> scored on a rush in the third quarter, and with many starters out the Trojans answered {{in the fourth quarter}} with their own rushing touchdown. <b>The</b> <b>Cardinal</b> ended the scoring with 23seconds remaining with their second rushing touchdown of the game to bring the score to 51–21. With the win, the Trojans extended their winning streak to 31games.|$|E

On November 18, 1974, {{he was part of}} a three-team deal {{involving}} <b>the</b> <b>Cardinals,</b> Padres and Detroit Tigers. <b>The</b> <b>Cardinals</b> sent Folkers, Alan Foster and Sonny Siebert to the Padres, who sent a player to be named later to <b>the</b> <b>Cardinals</b> and Nate Colbert to the Tigers.

5|$|The curial {{office of}} Cardinal Secretary of State {{in many ways}} evolved from the roles {{formerly}} filled by cardinal-nephews. From 1644 to 1692, the power of <b>the</b> <b>Cardinal</b> Secretary of State was essentially inversely proportional to that of <b>the</b> <b>Cardinal</b> Nephew, to whom the Secretariat was subordinate. During some pontificates, for example that of Pope Pius V (1566–1572) and his nephew Michele Bonelli, the cardinal-nephew {{and secretary of state}} were one and the same.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} the pope is {{verified}} by <b>the</b> <b>Cardinal</b> Camerlengo, or Chamberlain, who traditionally performed the task by calling out his Christian (not papal) name {{three times in the}} presence of the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations, and of the Cleric Prelates, Secretary and Chancellor of the Apostolic Camera. <b>The</b> <b>Cardinal</b> Camerlengo takes possession of the Ring of the Fisherman worn by the pope; the ring, along with the papal seal, is later destroyed before the College of Cardinals. The tradition originated to avoid forgery of documents, but today merely is a symbol of the end of the pope's reign.|$|E

In the second quarter, after Brohm threw a long touchdown, and the Huskies answered with a Lou Allen run, <b>the</b> <b>Cardinals</b> opened scoring with another touchdown pass by Brohm and a second field goal by Carmody. <b>The</b> <b>Cardinals</b> took a 27-10 lead into halftime. In the second half <b>the</b> <b>Cardinals</b> scored three times without being answered by the Huskies, including two more Brohm Touchdown passes and a second running touchdown by Anthony Allen.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cardinals</b> next faced <b>the</b> South Florida Bulls, a team <b>the</b> <b>Cardinals</b> lost to in 2005.

5|$|If he accepts, and {{is already}} a bishop, he {{immediately}} takes office. If {{he is not a}} bishop, however, he must be first consecrated as one before he can assume office. If a priest is elected, <b>the</b> <b>Cardinal</b> Dean consecrates him bishop; if a layman is elected, then <b>the</b> <b>Cardinal</b> Dean first ordains him deacon, then priest, and only then consecrates him as bishop. Only after becoming a bishop does the pope-elect take office. These functions of the Dean are assumed, if necessary, by the sub-Dean, and if the sub-Dean is also impeded, they are assumed by the senior cardinal-bishop in attendance. In 2005 the Dean himself—Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger—was elected pope. In 2013, the Dean and sub-Dean were not in attendance (over the age limit), and these functions were assumed by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re.|$|E
5|$|Mesa Verdeans used astronomical {{observations}} to plan their farming and religious ceremonies, drawing on both natural {{features in the}} landscape and masonry structures built for this purpose.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cardinal</b> {{protector}} of England was an appointed crown-cardinal of England from 1492 until 1539.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cardinals</b> next went on {{the road}} to face the Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders, led by first-year head coach Rick Stockstill and quarterback Clint Marks. <b>The</b> <b>Cardinals</b> scored on an early field goal, but the Blue Raiders took the lead when Damon Nickson {{returned}} the ensuing kickoff 88-yards for a touchdown. After a field goal by the Blue Raiders gave them a 10-3 lead, <b>the</b> <b>Cardinals</b> opened up <b>the</b> scoring with two more field goals and a pair of touchdown passes by Hunter Cantwell to Mario Urrutia. At halftime <b>the</b> <b>Cardinals</b> led 23-10.

5|$|The {{aforementioned}} Cardinals plus Borja's own vote numbered 14, {{one short}} of the required two-third majority. However, Cardinals Carafa, Costa, Piccolomini, Cibò, and Zeno, followed by Medici, were unwilling to be bribed. Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, followed by Basso, was intractably opposed to Borja's election. Thus, the eighty-six-year-old Gherardo, <b>the</b> <b>Cardinal</b> Patriarch of Venice, who was paid only 5,000 ducats, constituted the deciding vote.|$|E
5|$|The {{right of}} the laity to reject the person elected was {{abolished}} by a Synod held in the Lateran in 769, but restored to Roman noblemen by Pope Nicholas I during a Synod of Rome in 862. The pope was also subjected to oaths of loyalty to the Holy Roman Emperor, who had the duty of providing security and public peace in Rome. A major change came in 1059, when Pope Nicholas II decreed in In Nomine Domini that the cardinals were to elect a candidate, who would take office after receiving the assent of the clergy and laity. <b>The</b> <b>cardinal</b> bishops were to meet first and discuss the candidates before summoning <b>the</b> <b>cardinal</b> priests and cardinal deacons for the actual vote. The Second Council of the Lateran in 1139 removed the requirement for obtaining the assent of the lower clergy and the laity, while the Third Council of the Lateran in 1179 gave equal rights to the entire College of Cardinals when electing a new pope.|$|E
