Regrettably, the construction of analogue tachograph, an original <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>tachograph</b> used in road transport, encouraged to numerous frauds and counterfeits of social rules for drivers In order to solve these all problems, they led with Directive of Advice No. 2135 / 98 from 24 September 1998 of the August of 2004 from the beginning of {{in the area of the}} European Union, new type of registering setting up in the road transport- digital tachograph.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{technical}} report is to describe the proof-of-concept of the CEN-DSRC imple- mentation of the remote interrogation function of the new version <b>of</b> the digital <b>tachograph.</b> The current digital tachograph (DT) system to monitor the driving time in commercial ve- hicles above 3. 5 tons is governed by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3821 / 85 of 20 December 1985, which was modified at several occasions and more recently in 2006, when the digital tachograph was introduced, and in 2009, when it was updated to technical progress to avoid fraud and reduce the administrative burden. In July 2011 the Commission made a proposal (COM(2011) 451 final) to modify the tachograph regulation, {{which has been the}} object of discussions in Council and Parliament {{in the course of the}} ordinary legislative procedure. The final version of the approved regulation was published in February 2014 (Regulation 165 / 2014 (Commission, 2004)). The technical specifications <b>of</b> the smart <b>tachograph</b> were published as Regulation 799 / 2016 (Commission, 2011). One of the main functions is the remote interrogation <b>of</b> the Smart <b>Tachograph</b> (ST) installed in the commercial vehicle through the CEN-DSRC standard. The function supports law enforcers in the checking of potential frauds or malfunctions in the ST. To support the future deployment <b>of</b> the smart <b>tachograph</b> and to validate the technical specifications <b>of</b> the smart <b>tachograph</b> regarding the remote interrogation function, JRC issued a tender to the DSRC manufacturer Q-FREE to implement a prototype of the new remote interrogation systems.

40|$|At {{requests}} from several insurance companies, more than 100 advisory opinions and expert conclusions on commercial vehicle driver's infringements {{in the field}} of compliance with the rules for working and resting times as well as for application <b>of</b> recording equipment (<b>tachograph)</b> in the local and international road haulage operations have been developed from 2008 to 2013. The aim of the research is to investigate the most common infringements of social provisions committed by commercial vehicle drivers involved in road transport accidents (RTA). The data included in this paper refer particularly to infringements committed by the drivers involved in driving vehicles which were registered in the Latvian registry. The paper summarizes and evaluates most common infringements of social legislation requirements for drivers involved in RTA in accordance with the Directive 2009 / 5 /EC of the European Commission and the corresponding Latvian Cabinet of Ministers Regulations No. 411 entered into force in 2008. Offences on drivers' allowed work and rest time periods, shortcomings at record keeping and inappropriate use <b>of</b> recording equipment (<b>tachograph)</b> by drivers <b>of</b> commercial vehicles are characterized in this paper based on findings and conclusions of in-depth case studies, advisory opinions and expert conclusions. The paper provides evaluation of infringements of social legislation requirements by their importance in relation to road safety, by <b>type</b> <b>of</b> recording equipment fitted to vehicles, by the quantity and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> offences committed simultaneously, as well as by other minor aspects. It was found that drivers have committed up to 10 different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> infringements at a single case. Most of the infringements discovered should be defined as very serious ones. Even in those cases when only one violation was found, in half of the cases it was defined as very serious infringement.

Design of circumferential involvement of the chosen conception is detailed described and divided into several parts (controlling part, frequency inputs, analog inputs, binary inputs).

Thesis includes theoretical calculations, which is needed for the design of software. On a functional input module is developed and debugged operating firmware, which is based on single-fiber design of the program. To measure the actual speed are debugged two algorithms - method of periodic sampling and the method of external interrupt.
