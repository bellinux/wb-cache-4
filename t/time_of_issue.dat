5|$|The {{price and}} value of a Zimbabwean {{banknote}} depend on various factors: the rarity, based on {{factors such as the}} name of capital city, how long it was printed, or the type of watermark; its condition, and the national situation at <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue,</b> such as shortages or hyperinflation. Common designs and variants such as the $100 note of 1995 (Pick no. 9) are usually valued at about $1 apiece, while rare varieties such as the $10 Salisbury error note (Pick no. 3b) and the Standard Chartered issues are valued at around $100 or more. Zimbabwean banknotes are usually sold by banknote dealers over the counter or on the internet, although the most valued types theoretically qualify for inclusion in auction.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to showing the ship, the coin depicts {{a version of}} the Hudson city seal, with Neptune riding a whale, a design that has caused commentary over the years. Most of the coins were most likely bought by coin dealers, leaving few for collectors, with the result that prices spiked from the $1 cost at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue.</b> This caused anger among coin collectors, but did not lower the coin's value, which has continued to increase for the eighty-plus years since it was struck.|$|E
500|$|The Lewis and Clark Exposition dollar was {{the first}} {{commemorative}} gold coin to be struck and dated in multiple years. A total of 60,069 pieces were struck, from both years, of which 40,003 were melted. According to numismatists Jim Hunt and Jim Wells in their 2004 article on the coin, [...] "the poor reception afforded the coin at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> virtually guaranteed their rarity for future generation".|$|E
500|$|In the 1880s, {{despite the}} return of gold to {{commerce}} nationwide with the resumption of specie payments {{at the end of}} 1878, few three-dollar pieces were coined. [...] There was a small speculative boom by the public in putting aside three-dollar pieces; nevertheless, thousands remained at the Philadelphia Mint. [...] Few were sent to banks; the coins sold for a small premium when banks had some or when they were purchased from exchange brokers. [...] The coins' main use was as gifts, or in jewelry. [...] The pieces were struck only at Philadelphia after the 1870-S rarity, and early numismatist S.H.Chapman noted of the 1879 through 1889 issues, [...] "of the later years of the$3, large numbers were remelted at the Philadelphia Mint." [...] The Mint apparently favored certain Philadelphia dealers in the distribution of the gold dollar, but the three-dollar piece could be obtained without a premium at the cashier's window of the Philadelphia Mint. Large numbers of the 1879 three-dollar piece (mintage 3,000for circulation), 1880 (1,000), and 1881 (500) were hoarded by early coin collector and dealer Thomas L.Elder, who asked bank tellers to look out for them. [...] Elder could not have obtained them directly from the Mint at the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>issue</b> as he was still a child in 1880, and did not begin collecting coins until 1887.|$|E

[...] Postal rates were often set bilaterally, by postal conventions between nations, such as the 1817 and 1837 postal treaties between France and Prussia, and the 1847 and 1853 conventions between the United States and Bremen (a city-state at the time).
