5|$|The total {{quantity}} of ATP in <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> about 0.2moles. The majority of ATP is recycled from ADP by the aforementioned processes. Thus, {{at any given}} time, {{the total amount of}} ATP + ADP remains fairly constant.|$|E
5|$|Biomes {{are larger}} units of {{organization}} that categorize {{regions of the}} Earth's ecosystems, mainly according to the structure and composition of vegetation. There are different methods to define the continental boundaries of biomes dominated by different functional types of vegetative communities that are limited in distribution by climate, precipitation, weather and other environmental variables. Biomes include tropical rainforest, temperate broadleaf and mixed forest, temperate deciduous forest, taiga, tundra, hot desert, and polar desert. Other researchers have recently categorized other biomes, such as the human and oceanic microbiomes. To a microbe, <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> a habitat and a landscape. Microbiomes were discovered largely through advances in molecular genetics, which have revealed a hidden richness of microbial diversity on the planet. The oceanic microbiome {{plays a significant role}} in the ecological biogeochemistry of the planet's oceans.|$|E
5|$|Divers {{operate in}} an {{environment}} for which <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> not well suited. They face special physical and health risks when they go underwater or use high pressure breathing gas. The consequences of diving incidents range from merely annoying to rapidly fatal, and the result often depends on the equipment, skill, response and fitness of the diver and diving team. The hazards include the aquatic environment, the use of breathing equipment in an underwater environment, exposure to a pressurised environment and pressure changes, particularly pressure changes during descent and ascent, and breathing gases at high ambient pressure. Diving equipment other than breathing apparatus is usually reliable, but {{has been known to}} fail, and loss of buoyancy control or thermal protection can be a major burden which may lead to more serious problems. There are also hazards of the specific diving environment, and hazards related to access to and egress from the water, which vary from place to place, and may also vary with time. Hazards inherent in the diver include pre-existing physiological and psychological conditions and the personal behaviour and competence of the individual. For those pursuing other activities while diving, there are additional hazards of task loading, of the dive task and of special equipment associated with the task.|$|E

25|$|The {{theme of}} the crumbling, haunted castle is a key feature of Horace Walpole's Castle of Otranto (1764), which largely contributed in {{defining}} the Gothic genre.

25|$|The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and the New Catholic Encyclopedia give two {{possible}} replies to these objections.

25|$|Because the {{conversion}} of retinol from provitamin carotenoids by <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> actively regulated {{by the amount of}} retinol available to the body, {{the conversion}}s apply strictly only for vitamin A-deficient humans.

25|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> only {{slightly}} less dense than water, water supports {{the weight of the}} body during swimming. As a result, swimming is “low-impact” compared to land activities such as running. The density and viscosity of water also create resistance for objects moving through the water. Swimming strokes use this resistance to create propulsion, but this same resistance also generates drag on the body.|$|E
25|$|In Latter-day Saint (Mormonism) theology, {{the spirit}} and the body {{constitute}} the human soul. Whereas <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> subject to death on earth, they believe that the spirit never ceases to exist and that one day the spirits and bodies of all mankind will be reunited again. This doctrine stems from their belief that the resurrection of Jesus Christ grants the universal gift of immortality to every human being.|$|E
25|$|In {{ancient and}} medieval era texts of Hinduism, <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body</b> <b>is</b> {{described}} as a temple, and deities are described to be parts residing within it, while the Brahman (Absolute Reality, God) is described to be the same, or of similar nature, as the Atman (self, soul), which Hindus believe is eternal and within every living being.
