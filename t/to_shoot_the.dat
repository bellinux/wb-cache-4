After filming {{was completed}} five days later, Pearce's voice-overs were recorded.

5|$|After several sightings, the Fringe team {{move into}} some nearby storm drains to bait the chimera with its larvae. Feeling {{somewhat}} responsible, Walter locks himself {{in with the}} chimera and ingests some poison that will kill him within the hour, believing that if it kills him, the chimera will only be killing itself. He manages <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>the</b> chimera in time however, and they use its blood {{to find a cure}} for Charlie.|$|E
5|$|An assault is {{not caused}} if a {{defendant}} threatens <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>the</b> victim, but {{the victim is}} aware that the gun is not loaded or fake. However, {{it would be the}} actus reus of an assault if the victim wrongly believes the gun is, or may be, loaded. Since assault is a summary offence, no prosecutions take place for attempted assault. However, it is possible to commit attempts of aggravated forms of assault.|$|E

25|$|I {{requested}} him to {{send the}} army to Gujarat and suppress the riots. The military was sent, {{but they were not}} given powers <b>to</b> <b>shoot.</b> If <b>the</b> military was given powers <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> at <b>the</b> perpetrators of violence, recurrence of tragedies in Gujarat could have been avoided.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{budgetary}} constraints, {{the production}} {{was not able}} <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>the</b> remounted scenes of episode one in the north-east, and they instead had to be filmed in and around Watford. Beach-set scenes were shot at Folkestone rather than Whitley Bay, which was obvious to locals on screen due {{to the presence of}} pebbles on the beach, which are not present at Whitley. This led to some critics mockingly referring to the production as Our Friends in the South.|$|E
5|$|Iñárritu had {{stated that}} he {{originally}} wanted <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>the</b> film chronologically, a process that would have added $7 million to the film's production budget. Iñárritu later confirmed that the film was shot in sequence, despite Hardy's statement that the film could not be shot chronologically, due to weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|Posin and Stanford had {{originally}} planned <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>the</b> film {{using their own}} funds, but they sent the script to producers Lawrence Bender and Bonnie Curtis who agreed to produce the film and help to raise the budget. Bell was cast in the lead role after an extensive auditioning process, and the film was shot in various California locations over 30 days in April 2004.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{director was}} Silvio Narizzano who left <b>the</b> project prior <b>to</b> <b>shooting.</b> <b>The</b> screenwriters were Chris Bryant and Allan Scott, {{who were so}} upset with subsequent changes made they requested their names {{be taken off the}} film.|$|R

5|$|Principal {{photography}} for Ip Man {{began in}} March 2008, and {{was completed by}} the end of August. A majority of the film focuses on events surrounding Ip Man that took place in Foshan in the 1930s and 1940s during the Sino-Japanese War. Since the buildings in modern-day Foshan are architecturally different from the ones of the film's period, the filmmakers decided <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>the</b> film in Shanghai.|$|E
5|$|According to Peter Freuchen, {{the scene}} in which the wolf attacks Mala is real. Freuchen says that Mala, armed with {{a rock and a}} pistol beneath his fur jacket, spent three afternoons trying to lure a wolf into attacking him. A rifleman and a cinematographer using a camera with a {{telephoto}} lens followed at a distance. The wolf attack was filmed from far away, with the rifleman ready <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>the</b> wolf in case Mala was unable to kill it. As shown in film, Mala was able to kill the wolf without using his pistol or relying on the rifleman, and was not injured in the attack.|$|E
5|$|After Belushi's wife Judy and Aykroyd had a {{talk with}} Belushi about his antics, the {{production}} returned to Los Angeles. Filming there again ran smoothly, until it came time <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>the</b> final sequence at the Hollywood Palladium. Just beforehand, Belushi fell off a borrowed skateboard and seriously injured his knee, making it unlikely he could go through with the scene, which required him to sing, dance, and do cartwheels. Wasserman persuaded the city's top orthopedic surgeon to postpone his weekend plans long enough to stop by and sufficiently anesthetize Belushi's knee, and the scene was filmed as intended.|$|E

The film was an adaptation of the Betty Comden and Adolph Green Broadway musical about sailors on leave in New York City {{and was the first}} musical to be filmed on location. Donen and Kelly had wanted <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>the</b> entire film in New York, but Freed would only allow them to spend one week away from the studio.|$|E

As the patrol drew near Tournai in the afternoon, they intercepted a group of 15 Fokker D.VIIs. The Snipes swept towards the German aircraft, and Baker attempted to engage the formation leader, but the machine guns on his Snipe jammed. He brought in his aircraft for a second attempt, and managed <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>the</b> Fokker down out of control. In all, the Australians destroyed five of the Fokkers before the engagement ended.|$|E

5|$|During this period, Bakshi reread J. D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye, {{which he}} had first read in high school, and saw {{parallels}} between his situation {{and that of the}} book's protagonist, Holden Caulfield. Inspired to seek the film rights, he intended <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>the</b> story's bracketing sequences in live action and to animate the core flashback scenes. Salinger had rejected previous offers to adapt the novel, and had not made a public appearance since 1965 or granted an interview since 1980. Bakshi sent Salinger a letter explaining why he should be allowed to adapt the novel; the writer responded by thanking Bakshi and asserting that the novel was unfit for any medium other than its original form.|$|E
5|$|Former Viceroy Santiago de Liniers {{organized}} a counter-revolution in Córdoba, and this {{became the first}} military campaign of the independent government. Despite the importance of Liniers himself, and his prestige as a popular hero for his role when the British invaded, the population of Córdoba preferred to support the revolution. This reduced {{the power of the}} counter-revolutionary army by means of desertions and sabotage. Liniers's troops were quickly defeated by the forces led by Francisco Ortiz de Ocampo. Ocampo refused <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>the</b> captive Liniers; hence the execution ordered by the Junta was carried out by Juan José Castelli. After the victory, the Primera Junta sent military expeditions to many other cities, to demand support and the election of representatives to it.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel Byrne as Dean Keaton. Kevin Spacey met Byrne at a {{party and}} asked him to do the film. He read the {{screenplay}} and turned it down, thinking that the filmmakers could not pull it off. Byrne met screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie and Singer and was impressed by the latter's vision for the film. However, Byrne was also dealing with some personal problems at the time and backed out for 24 hours until the filmmakers agreed <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>the</b> film in Los Angeles, where the actor lived, and make it in five weeks.|$|E

He was aware that the brothers had left the safehouse to go to St. Francis Xavier's Church. Led by General Mai Hữu Xuân, the officers took an M113 armored personnel carrier (APC), four jeeps, and several soldiers to Cholon. As they left, Minh gestured to Nhung with two fingers, taken to be an order <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>the</b> brothers.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{shortly before}} the U.N. Headquarters {{underwent}} major renovations, Del Toro and Soderbergh shot the scenes of Guevara speaking to the U.N. General Assembly in 1964. The director wanted <b>to</b> <b>shoot</b> <b>the</b> first part of The Argentine in Cuba, but was prevented from travelling there by the U.S. government's embargo. Doubling Santa Clara proved to be difficult {{because it was a}} certain size and had a certain look. Soderbergh spent four to five months scouting for a suitable replacement, looking at towns in Veracruz/Yucatán before settling on Campeche, which had the elements they needed.|$|E
