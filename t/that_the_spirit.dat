5|$|Extracts of {{the speech}} {{appeared}} in The New Yorker on June 10. Several weeks later, The New York Times printed the whole text, quickly followed by Life magazine and Reader's Digest. Hand's message that liberty is safeguarded by everyday Americans struck a popular chord, and he suddenly found himself a folk hero. Though he enjoyed the acclaim, he thought it unmerited. His biographer Gerald Gunther, noting the paradox of the agnostic Hand's use of religious overtones, suggests that the most challenging aspect {{of the speech}} was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> of liberty must entertain doubt.|$|E
5|$|I {{then got}} some Coal {{from one of}} the Pits nearest thereunto, which I {{distilled}} in a Retort in an open Fire. At first there came over only Phlegm, afterwards a black Oil, and then likewise a Spirit arose, which I could noways condense, but it forced my Lute, or broke my Glasses. Once, when it had forced the Lute, coming close thereto, {{in order to try to}} repair it, I observed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> which issued out caught Fire at the Flame of the Candle, and continued burning with Violence as it issued out, in a Stream, which 1 blew out, and lighted again, alternately, for several times.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} century the neglect continued until some basic external renovation work was undertaken between 1965 and 1971, making the structure {{wind and water}} tight, although it remained unoccupied. The castle was again abandoned and left unmaintained. The condition of the building further declined, becoming derelict. It was in a ruinous state when marketed for sale in April 2013 {{after the death of}} Count Robin Mirrlees, who had owned it for about fifty years. At the end of that year it was purchased by the former model Olga Roh, who said she intended to restore it. Modern day reports suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> of the 3rd Lord Banff and that of a white dog haunt the castle, which is classified as a category A listed building.|$|E

5|$|Lotus Temple, is a Bahá'í House of Worship {{completed}} in 1986. Notable for its flowerlike shape, {{it serves as}} the Mother Temple of the Indian subcontinent {{and has become a}} prominent attraction in the city. The Lotus Temple has won numerous architectural awards and been featured in hundreds of newspaper and magazine articles. Like all other Bahá'í Houses of Worship, is open to all regardless of religion, or any other distinction, as emphasised in Bahá'í texts. The Bahá'í laws emphasise <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> of the House of Worship be that it is a gathering place where people of all religions may worship God without denominational restrictions. The Bahá'í laws also stipulate that only the holy scriptures of the Bahá'í Faith and other religions can be read or chanted inside in any language; while readings and prayers can be set to music by choirs, no musical instruments can be played inside. Furthermore, no sermons can be delivered, and there can be no ritualistic ceremonies practised.|$|E
5|$|While in Mexico, Cameron began {{performing}} blood rituals in {{the hope}} of communicating with Parsons' spirit; during these, she cut her own wrists. As part of these rituals, she claimed to have received a new magical identity, Hilarion. When she learned that an unidentified flying object had been seen over Washington D.C.'s Capitol Building she considered it a response to Parsons' death. After two months, she returned to California and attempted suicide. Increasingly interested in occultism, she read through her husband's papers. Embracing his Thelemic beliefs, she came to understand his purpose in carrying out the Babalon Working and also came to believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> of Babalon had been incarnated into herself. She came to believe that Parsons had been murdered by the police or anti-zionists, and continued her attempts at astral projection to commune with his spirit.|$|E
5|$|During {{the initial}} unleashing of the king's power, Veigue's Force of Ice {{goes out of}} control, causing his friend Claire to become imprisoned in an ice pillar. One year after this, Veigue is {{contacted}} by Eugene and Mao, who help free Claire from the ice pillar. Shortly after this, Claire is taken away by agents of Agarte, who is searching for the most beautiful Huma woman in the land. Veigue heads out with Eugene and Mao to rescue Claire, eventually joining forces with Annie, Tytree and Hilda. Upon reaching the royal capital of Balka, the group find Agarte using her Force of the Moon to resurrect Geyorkias in the belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> will save her kingdom from the chaos consuming it, having been prompted by Zilva. When summoned, Geyorkias declares his intent to destroy the Huma population, forcing the group to attack and destroy his physical form. With Geyorkias gone and Claire rescued, the group part ways, but are brought back together as outbreaks of racial violence from both Huma and Gajuma begin destabilizing Karegia, caused by the hatred the summoned Geyorkias released after his defeat. To quell the violence, the group decide to summon the other Sacred Beasts {{in the hope of}} purging Geyorkias' hatred from the land. After rescuing Agarte from a Huma mob, it is revealed that Agarte switched bodies with Claire. In the aftermath, Agarte reveals that she originally captured Claire so she could switch bodies and realize her love for her bodyguard Milhaust, as relations between Huma and Gajama are taboo. Unfortunately, the trauma of events has caused Agarte to lose her Force abilities, leaving Claire and Agarte trapped in each other's bodies.|$|E

25|$|True {{scale of}} the problem became evident during the {{following}} years. The Frankish view of the Filioque was emphasized again in the Libri Carolini, composed around 791-793. Openly arguing that the word Filioque {{was part of the}} Creed of 381, the authors of Libri Carolini demonstrated not only the surprising lack of basic knowledge but also the lack of will to receive right advice and council from the Mother-Church in Rome. Frankish theologians reaffirmed the notion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> proceeds from the Father and the Son, and rejected as inadequate the teaching <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Spirit</b> proceeds from the Father through the Son. That claim was both erroneous and dangerous for the preservation of the unity of the Church.|$|E

This doctrine stems from their belief that the resurrection of Jesus Christ grants the universal gift of immortality to every human being.|$|E

25|$|At 10:00pm on Saturday, the King and Queen Sirikit, {{with the}} help of a {{hydraulic}} tappet, set light to a 40m (130ft) high funeral pyre. The $5.7m (£3.8m) temporary royal crematorium, a complex of pavilions constructed on the Sanam Luang parade ground over seven months, had been lavishly decorated with flowers, garlands and carved banana stalks. After the cremation, the funeral buildings will be torn down, as they are sombre reminders of a royal death. According to Hindu belief, it is said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> of the princess will then return home to Mount Meru, where all deities eternally live.|$|E

25|$|Around {{the time}} of the royal saltworks, Ledoux formalized his {{innovative}} design ideas for an urbanism and an architecture intended to improve society, of a Cité idéale charged with symbols and meanings. Along with Étienne-Louis Boullée and his project for the Cenotaph of Newton, he is considered a precursor to the utopians who would follow. Boullée and Ledoux were a specific influence on subsequent Greek Revival architects and especially Benjamin Henry Latrobe who carried through the style in the United States for public architecture with the intention <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> of the ancient Athenian democracy would be echoed by buildings serving the new democracy of the United States of America.|$|E
25|$|Spiritualists often set March 31, 1848 as the {{beginning}} of their movement. On that date, Kate and Margaret Fox, of Hydesville, reported that they had made contact with the spirit of a murdered peddler. What made this an extraordinary event was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>spirit</b> communicated through audible rapping noises, rather than simply appearing to a person in a trance. The evidence of the senses appealed to practical Americans, and the Fox sisters became a sensation. Demonstrations of mediumship (seances and automatic writing, for example) proved to be a profitable business, and soon became popular forms of entertainment and spiritual catharsis. The Foxes earned a living this way, as did many others.|$|E
