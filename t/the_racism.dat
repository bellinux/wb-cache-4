5|$|The Crisis carried editorials by Du Bois that {{supported}} the ideals of unionized labor but excoriated <b>the</b> <b>racism</b> demonstrated by its leaders, who systematically excluded blacks from membership. Du Bois also supported {{the principles of the}} Socialist Party (he was briefly a member of the party from 1910 to 1912), but he denounced <b>the</b> <b>racism</b> demonstrated by some socialist leaders.Lewis, p. 275 (denounced). Frustrated by Republican president Taft's failure to address widespread lynching, Du Bois endorsed Democratic candidate Woodrow Wilson in the 1912 presidential race, in exchange for Wilson's promise to support black causes.|$|E

5|$|Soon after Minas Geraes {{arrival in}} Brazil, the country's {{prosperity}} began to wane, and a severe depression hit the Brazilian economy. The economic hardship, <b>the</b> <b>racism</b> prevalent in all {{branches of the}} Brazilian armed forces, and the severe discipline enforced on all navy ships spawned a mutiny known as the Revolt of the Lash, or Revolta da Chibata, among sailors on the most powerful ships.|$|E

5|$|The Sun Bowl was not {{the only}} bowl game to involve racial exclusion. Many {{football}} games during the twentieth century affected the integration of collegiate football and sports in general: in addition to Lafayette, there were games played at The University of California, Los Angeles (19381941), Drake University (19481952), Georgia Tech (19541956), and the University of Wyoming (19671970) that led to integrated football games. At the time, these schools conducted studies to monitor the treatment of African American players and how the schools reacted to certain situations involving segregation and prejudice. The teams that were in favor of African Americans participating in football gave players a chance to speak out against <b>the</b> <b>racism</b> {{that took place in the}} sport. As a result of protests and communities coming together to support black football players, college football slowly became integrated.|$|E
5|$|The changes paid off. In 1963, {{the team}} {{finished}} 10–4, and Jim Brown broke the NFL's single-season rushing record with 1,863 yards. Brown was also voted the league's Most Valuable Player. Cleveland, however, finished a game behind the New York Giants {{and did not}} reach the championship game. The Browns had started out 6–0 but faltered after racial divisions cropped up within the team. Some black players believed white teammates were getting to play ahead of them because of their race. Toward {{the end of the}} season, Collier met with the team's leaders and told them <b>the</b> <b>racism</b> had to stop. After the season, he traded away players he thought were sowing discord and opened up a dialogue with those who remained to stamp out the tension.|$|E

25|$|Weapons of Choice {{has been}} both hailed and criticized {{by members of the}} {{alternative}} history community.

25|$|The railroads coordinated their {{response}} through the General Managers' Association, {{which had been}} formed in 1886 and included 24 lines linked to Chicago. The railroads began hiring replacement workers (strikebreakers), which increased hostilities. Many blacks were recruited as strikebreakers and crossed picket lines, as they feared that <b>the</b> <b>racism</b> expressed by the American Railway Union would lock them out of another labor market. This added racial tension to the union's predicament.|$|E
25|$|Although Parks' {{autobiography}} recounts early {{memories of}} the kindness of white strangers, she could not ignore <b>the</b> <b>racism</b> of her society.

50|$|Fazio used <b>the</b> Modern <b>Racism</b> Scale as an {{explicit}} measure of racial biases in his experiments.

Fazio tested the reactivity of Modern Racism Scale by conducting an experiment where race of the experimenter {{and whether or not}} the subject thought the experimenter would see their scores were manipulated. Subjects showed less negative bias towards Blacks on <b>the</b> Modern <b>Racism</b> Scale when they knew their scores would be seen, and their scores dropped even more when the experimenter was Black. The Bona Fide Pipeline results may not have correlated with <b>the</b> Modern <b>Racism</b> Scale, but they were found to correlate with the Black experimenter's ratings of subject friendliness and interest.|$|R

25|$|There {{are many}} reasons for the history and {{continued}} prevalence of racial segregation in U.S. churches, including racism, denominational differences, and isolation. This segregation also has effects on individuals and the larger society, including increased racism and segregation even outside of the church. However, segregated Black churches also have been a positive place for community organizing for civil rights and other issues, as well as offering a respite for Black individuals from <b>the</b> <b>racism</b> they face in integrated society.|$|E
25|$|Steel {{companies}} also turned toward strikebreaking and rumor-mongering to demoralize the picketers. Between 30,000 and 40,000 unskilled African-American and Mexican American workers {{were brought to}} work in the mills. Company officials played on <b>the</b> <b>racism</b> of many white steelworkers by pointing out how well-fed and happy the black workers seemed now that they had 'white' jobs. Company spies also spread rumors that the strike had collapsed elsewhere, and they pointed to the operating steel mills as proof that the strike had been defeated.|$|E
