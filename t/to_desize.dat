30|$|The {{proposed}} sustainable pre-treatment {{process was}} highly efficient in conserving water, energy and process chemicals. When the scouring and bleaching process baths were recycled, 36  % excess utilisation of alkali in the scouring process was observed {{when compared with}} the conventional process whereas in bleaching, 30  % excess usage of alkali and 25.6  % of that of hydrogen peroxide was seen. The fabric properties after recycling remained unchanged. When the scouring and bleaching process water containing unexhausted alkali and hydrogen peroxide was reused <b>to</b> <b>desize</b> a new grey fabric, there was a 10 -fold increase in absorbency and 2.7 times increase in whiteness index. Considering the economical perspective, for processing 1  ton fabric/day, there was a saving of 83  % water, 74  % energy and 101542 INR. By properly understanding the potential of waste stream, we can generate new resources of water and chemicals. This will reduce the intake of fresh water and minimise the load on the effluent treatment plant.|$|E
30|$|Simple and {{sustainable}} reuse and recycle strategies were investigated {{with the intention}} of assessing ways to curb water consumption in the textile wet processing. Textile pre-treatment involves desizing, scouring and bleaching processes. Each process requires a plethora of chemicals along with water, out of which the unexhausted chemicals are drained in the effluent stream. Conventionally, 7.3  % alkali and 6.9  % hydrogen peroxide are utilised in the scouring and bleaching process. Attempts were made to reutilise the unexhausted 92.7  % alkali and 93.1  % hydrogen peroxide from the scouring and bleaching process. After recycling the scouring and bleaching process bath three times, effluent still contained 55  % alkali and 67.5  % hydrogen peroxide which was reused <b>to</b> <b>desize</b> a new grey fabric. The fabric properties like Tegewa rating, absorbency and whiteness were found to be better than the conventional enzyme desized fabric. The desized fabrics were then subjected to dyeing using reactive dyes Yellow HE 6 G and Navy Blue HER, where analogous dyeing and fastness properties were obtained when compared with fresh water samples. Economical feasibility has been calculated considering a production of 1  ton of fabric/day. It was observed that 83  % water and 74  % energy were conserved per ton of processed fabric which contributes to a saving of around 1 lac INR/ton.|$|E

30|$|From Table  1, it {{is clear}} that the {{pre-treatment}} process, i.e. desizing, scouring and bleaching, involves more water usage. Also, about 55 to 60  % energy consumed in the textile industry is used in various pre-treatment stages [5]. The high consumption of water and energy for textile wet-processing sector emphasises the urge for improvement of process, i.e. to adopt cost effective practices to reduce the use of scarce resources like water and energy. Hence, the logical approach <b>to</b> combine <b>desizing,</b> scouring and bleaching operations to save energy and water was put forward by many researchers [6, 7, 8, 9, 10].|$|R
40|$|In this study, corona {{discharge}} was applied <b>to</b> optimize the <b>desizing</b> of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) on cotton fabric. The weight of sized fabric decreased slightly when the PVA sized fabric was treated by {{corona discharge}}. Percent desizing rate (PDR) of PVA sized fabric increased evidently after the fabric {{was subjected to}} corona discharge treatment, PDR increased with the enhancement of corona discharge treatment by increase of applied voltage and treating time. Water dissolution time and water-contact angle decreased at the same time. SEM and AFM photos show the surface of PVA film was modified into uneven morphology with many ridges pores and cracks. ATR-FTIR analysis shows that the content of C=O, ACOOH, and CAO bonds was increased after the PVA film was treated by corona discharge.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Polyvinyl alcohol-containing {{desizing}} wastewater discharged within final textile wastewater has a {{great impact}} to the environment due to its poor biodegradability. An improved lab-scale hybrid anaerobic baffled reactor was developed <b>to</b> treat <b>desizing</b> wastewater. The modification was achieved by increasing the height of hybrid anaerobic baffled reactor and application of proper effluent recycle enabled to increase the ability of entrapping microbe-rich small particles in the reactor and prompted the formation of granules. The significant difficulty in hybrid anaerobic baffled reactor operation is the slow start-up procedure, which {{is crucial to the}} overall polyvinyl alcohol-containing desizing wastewater treatment. Therefore, the ability of a hybrid anaerobic baffled reactor, treating <b>desizing</b> wastewater, <b>to</b> achieve a prompt start-up was studied at lab-scale. Results showed that inoculated with anaerobic granular sludge and adoption of effluent recycle during start-up, the system demonstrated a good performance of polyvinyl alcohol removal efficiency (above 17. 2 %) and satisfactory stability of pH and alkalinity in effluent (range around 7. 4 - 8. 0 and 700 - 920 mg/L, respectively) and the sludge appeared obviously granulation. Thus, the prompt start-up was achieved after 60 days. The start-up strategy used for this process has achieved its goals by creating an active microbial population. The improved lab-scale hybrid anaerobic baffled reactor proved to be an efficient reactor configuration for the treatment of desizing wastewater, which favored the prompt start-up of hybrid anaerobic baffled reactor.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} to develop one-bath preparatory process for cotton towel {{by the use}} of different enzymes. The results obtained were compared with the conventional processing method. Instead of using amylase enzyme in the conventional method, amyloglucosidase / pullanase enzyme was used <b>to</b> carry out <b>desizing</b> in one-bath process that produces glucose units. The next process of bleaching (GOx treatment) was carried out in the spent bath of desizing, the glucose oxidase enzyme (Aspergillus Oryzae) was used to generate hydrogen peroxide from the residual glucose generated during desizing previously. The hydrogen peroxide yield was 85 mg/l. Glucose oxidase enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of glucose units to gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide simultaneously in the presence of oxygen. The decomposition of residual hydrogen peroxide from bleached towel was done with catalase enzyme. The results revealed similar Tegewa scale rating and Absorbency coupled with acceptable degree of Whiteness with integrated method when compared with the conventional method. The proposed integrated method is more economical as it requires less utilities and having environmental benefit owing to the elimination of desizing process effluent discharge...|$|R

In this paper, the {{application}} of the ultrasonic technology <b>to</b> the enzyme <b>desizing</b> pretreatment of polylactic acid (PLA) fiber was studied, and the different effect of such technology and traditional treatment on the PLA properties was also discussed. The results showed that, with the aid of the ultrasonic wave, the mass decrease rate and the whiteness of fiber increased 15 % and 25 % respectively, while the tear strength decreased nearly 6 % after the enzyme pretreatment. Besides, the time of ultrasonic pretreatment also decreased 20 % compared with traditional process.

40|$|Wide {{range of}} {{application}} of enzymes allowed their use in many textile processes such as biopolishing, desizing and bleaching. Cellulase enzymes {{have been used for}} the biopolishing of cellulosic fibers and fabrics. In this work the focus was on two seperate applications of modified enzymes in textile processing, one is to retain strength of viscos during pilling process and the second is <b>to</b> combine <b>desizing</b> and the bleaching processes of the fabric. Cellulases are used to prevent pilling {{on the surface of the}} viscose fabric but they couse a loss in the tensile strength of the viscose fabric. Commercial celluloses were crosslinked using different parameters in an attempt to ameliorate the loss of tensile strength and to improve enzyme properties. Native and modified enzymes were characterized and their activities against CMC and their effects on the properties of viscose (such as pilling, bursting strength) fabric were determined. Effects of mechanical agitation and surfactants were examined. Crosslinking of cellulase was found to prevent the loss of strength due to the fact that larger enzyme complexes formed by crosslinking were minly resticted to the fabric surface. Enzymes are replacing the use of harsh chemicals in many of the textile processes such as desizind and bleaching and immobilizations of these enzymes on solid supports allow their recycling. Enzymatically produced peroxide is used for bleaching of the cotton fabrics. Commercial Glucosse oxidase (GOx) enzyme was immobilized on different supports such as alumina, silica, Sepharose 4 B and crosslinked enzyme aggragates of GOx were prepared. Their efficiencies against glucose substrate for the production of peroxide were analyzed. Moreover, the starch size of the cotton fabric is hydrolized into glucose by the action of amyloglucosidase and this liquor was also used to produce peroxide. The activities of immobilized enzymes and CLEAs against desizing liquor and the whiteness values of the cotton fabrics after bleaching were examined. The whiteness values reached with immobilized enzyme are not appropriate for white textile but is sufficient for further dyeing processe. Combination of desizing and bleaching in a single bath and recycling of the immobilized enzyme is an environmently friendly alternative...|$|R
30|$|For {{cellulase}} {{production in}} submerged fermentation, seed inoculum was prepared in actinomycete broth medium (HiMedia Laboratories, Mumbai, India). Preliminary cellulase productions were tested using 1  % (w/v) CMC as carbon source in different growth media compositions viz. minimal salt media, Mandels mineral media [16], Czapek media [17], and Vogel’s mineral media [18]. The detailed composition of growth media were given in Additional file 1 : Tables S 2 to S 5. Production of cellulase was tested on different ligocellulosic biomass residues. The carbon sources tested were rice straw (RS), wheat bran (WB), rice husk (RH), wheat husk (WH), coco pith (CP), saw dust (SD), Walseth cellulose (WC), cardboard waste (CW), and newspaper waste (NW), respectively. Except WC, other carbon sources were <b>desized</b> <b>to</b> 0.5 – 1  cm using a hammer mill machine {{and subjected to}} extensive washing with distilled water and finally dried at 60  °C overnight until the moisture content was < 5  %, while the WC substrate was prepared using commercial cellulose powder (Sigma Aldrich, USA) and pre-treated with 83  % (w/v) phosphoric acid for 25  h at 40  °C. The precipitate obtained from the Buchner funnel filtration method was then collected and washed twice with 70  % (v/v) ethanol and neutralized to pH 7.0. Finally, the precipitate was dehydrated by acetone rinsing and dried under vacuum.

40|$|Graduation date: 1997 A {{series of}} {{chemical}} penetrants are employed {{to investigate the}} chemical characteristics of size bonds in different sizing systems. The bonding strength has been proved {{to be determined by}} the type of bonding. In rosinalum size the size bond is an indirect coordinate bond, which is vulnerable to the attack by acid, alkaline and especially by aluminum-affinited ligands, in which ligand substitutions take place and determine the rate of ink penetration in the Hercules Size Test (HST) test. Alkyl Ketene Dimer (AKD) can react with cellulose to form a direct fl-keto ester bond. This covalent bond is strong enough to resist the attack of acid or alkaline and is almost inert to these chemicals. However, if a small amount of alum is used in AKD sizing, there will be two types of size bond existed in the acid condition. Therefore, different HST values will be observed depending on what ink is used. A hypothesized mechanism about ligand substitution has been proposed and verified indirectly. This simple desizing approach provides important information on sizing mechanisms and will benefit new sizing agent research. As a new approach to rosin soap sizing, it was found that dipping handsheets in the rosin soap solution and drying the sheets at elevated temperatures could induce effective sizing on different pulps. No mordant (alum) is needed in this process. The pH of the dipping solution seems to have little effect on the sizing result. Some desizing inks with strong effects on conventional rosin soap sized paper were found <b>to</b> have little <b>desizing</b> effect on these type of handsheets. These facts strongly indicate that covalent ester linkages could be the bonds that form between rosin molecules and fibers in this process. The dry schedule, heat temperature, and the concentration of dipping solution have shown various effects on the sizing results depending on the types of pulp used. Completely understanding the sizing mechanism and making this process commercial is well worth additional research work. This method, however, suffers from its speed of fugitiveness...|$|R
