25|$|The Douglas {{response}} was more radical. When it flew on July 1, 1933, the prototype DC-1 had a robust <b>tapered</b> <b>wing,</b> retractable landing gear, and two 690hp (515kW) Wright radial engines driving variable-pitch propellers. It seated 12 passengers.|$|E
25|$|Trefethen Sport-Aire II - A wider {{fuselage}} tricycle gear version {{based on}} Stark's Super Skyhopper jigs. Built by Stark, Art Thistle and Al Trefethen. Other changes made were a swept tail, a <b>tapered</b> <b>wing,</b> and a Lycoming O-295 engine.|$|E
25|$|The Merlin EZ {{uses the}} same foam-rib {{construction}} as previous models, but with a constant-chord wing with a Clark Y airfoil replacing the previously <b>tapered</b> <b>wing.</b> The fuselage is of 4130 welded steel tube construction, covered in aircraft fabric.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{tables and}} charts {{for use in}} determining the characteristics of <b>tapered</b> <b>wings.</b> Theoretical factors are given from which the following characteristics of <b>tapered</b> <b>wings</b> may be found: the span lift distribution, the induced-angle-of attack distribution, the lift-curve slope, the angle of zero lift, the induced drag, the aerodynamic-center position, and the pitching moment about the aerodynamic center...|$|R
25|$|A unique {{feature of}} the Thunderceptor was its unusual inverse <b>tapered</b> <b>wing,</b> in which the chord length {{increased}} along the wing span from the root to the tip, the opposite of conventional swept wing designs. This {{was an attempt to}} address the problem of pitch-up, a potentially deadly phenomenon that plagued early high-speed models. The Thunderceptor's design meant the entire wing stalled smoothly, more like a straight-wing design.|$|E
500|$|Outwardly {{similar to}} the Il-4, the Il-6 was faster and had a longer and slimmer {{fuselage}} fitted with a completely new, highly <b>tapered</b> <b>wing</b> with an aspect ratio of 8. The engine nacelles were streamlined to reduce drag and increase speed as the engine radiators were mounted in the wing center section, fed by slits in {{the leading edge of}} the wing. Defensive armament was greatly improved with five [...] cannon fitted on flexible mountings in the nose, dorsal turret, two waist positions and a ventral blister forward of the tailplane.|$|E

50|$|A {{rectangular}} planform wing produces stronger wingtip vortices {{than does}} a <b>tapered</b> or elliptical <b>wing,</b> therefore many modern <b>wings</b> are <b>tapered.</b> However, an elliptical planform {{is more efficient}} as the induced downwash (and therefore the effective angle of attack) is constant across {{the whole of the}} wingspan. Few aircraft have this planform because of manufacturing complications — the most famous examples being the World War II Spitfire and Thunderbolt. <b>Tapered</b> <b>wings</b> with straight leading and trailing edges can approximate to elliptical lift distribution. Typically, straight edged non-tapered wings produce 5%, and <b>tapered</b> <b>wings</b> produce 1-2% more induced drag than an elliptical wing.|$|R
2500|$|Model {{announced}} at Sun'n'Fun, Lakeland, Florida, succeeding the StingSport. This is an advanced {{version of the}} StingSport with a new, <b>tapered</b> <b>wing</b> of greater span (9.11m or 29ft11in), area and aspect ratio and with larger flaps.

2500|$|Based on this experience, Westland {{decided to}} enter the Widgeon into {{production}} for the private owner. [...] It was therefore redesigned with a simpler, constant chord, wing replacing the <b>tapered</b> <b>wing</b> of the Widgeon I and II to ease production. [...] The resulting Widgeon III could be powered either a radial engine like the Genet or an inline engine such as the Cirrus. The first Widgeon III flew in March 1927, with production starting later that year. [...] The design was further refined with a duralumin tube fuselage and a new undercarriage to produce the Widgeon IIIA.|$|E
2500|$|The Zlín XIII {{was a very}} aerodynamically clean, low-powered, all wood {{monoplane}} with a one-piece, low set, <b>tapered</b> <b>wing</b> {{equipped with}} flaps. It was powered by a [...] Walter Minor four cylinder inverted engine, driving a two blade propeller and with a fixed, faired tailwheel undercarriage. [...] The enclosed cockpit placed the pilot well behind the wing trailing edge with a passenger seat ahead of him; a change of canopy to a shorter version, together with a forward fairing, removed the forward seat. This versatility was intended to allow the type XIII to operate as either a high speed executive transport or a single seat competition aircraft.|$|E

2500|$|The Allied {{reporting}} {{name was}} [...] "Oscar", {{but it was}} often called the [...] "Army Zero" [...] by American pilots because it bore a certain resemblance to the Mitsubishi A6M Zero, the Imperial Japanese Navy's counterpart to the Ki-43. [...] Both aircraft had generally similar layout and lines, and also used essentially the same Nakajima Sakae radial engine, with similar round cowlings and bubble-type canopies (the Oscars being distinctly smaller and having much less framing than the A6M). While relatively easy for a trained eye to tell apart with the [...] "finer" [...] lines of the Ki-43's fuselage — especially towards the tail — and more <b>tapered</b> <b>wing</b> planform; {{in the heat of}} battle, given the brief glimpses and distraction of combat, Allied aviators frequently made mistakes in enemy aircraft identification in the heat of a dogfight, reportedly having fought [...] "Zeros" [...] in areas where there were no Navy fighters.|$|E
2500|$|The CB-16 was a twin-engined high-wing monoplane, {{constructed}} of metal. [...] The slightly <b>tapered</b> <b>wing</b> was braced {{from the lower}} fuselage by pairs of parallel struts. [...] The fuselage was 36ft (11m) long and 12ft (3.7m wide) wide externally, with an airfoil cross section. [...] As with the earlier RB-1 and RB-2, the twin engines were embedded within {{the leading edge of}} the fuselage though, unlike them, the rest of this surface was largely filled with radiators. To reduce yaw after an engine failure, the 500hp (370kW) water cooled Curtiss Conqueror inline engines were mounted with slight toe out. [...] The internal dimensions of the cabin, which could seat 12-20 passengers, were 18ft (5.49m) by 11ft4in (3.45m) long, with a height of 5ft6in (1.71m). This provided both seating and lounge space. [...] At the rear of the cabin there was a small kitchen and toilets. [...] The pilots sat in open cockpits placed at the wing leading edge.|$|E
2500|$|Because most {{fighter pilots}} of the Luftwaffe {{were used to}} biplanes with open cockpits, low wing loading, light g-forces and easy {{handling}} like the Heinkel He 51, they were very critical of the Bf 109 at first. However, it soon {{became one of the}} frontrunners in the contest, as the Arado and Focke-Wulf entries, which were intended as [...] "backup" [...] programmes to safeguard against failure of the two favourites, proved to be completely outclassed. The Arado Ar 80, with its gull wing (replaced with a straight, <b>tapered</b> <b>wing</b> on the V3) and fixed, spatted undercarriage was overweight and underpowered, and the design was abandoned after three prototypes had been built. The parasol winged Fw 159, potentially inspired by the same firm's earlier Focke-Wulf Fw 56, was always considered by the E-Stelle Travemünde facility's staff to be a compromise between a biplane and an aerodynamically more efficient, low-wing monoplane. Although it had some advanced features, it used a novel, complex retractable main undercarriage which proved to be unreliable.|$|E
2500|$|The {{resulting}} {{design was}} a single engined biplane with single bay, unequal span <b>tapered</b> <b>wings</b> and a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. The aircraft was powered by a [...] Pratt & Whitney Twin Wasp Junior radial engine.|$|R
50|$|Fouga's {{greatest}} {{success was}} the CM.170 Magister, a jet-powered military trainer aircraft {{derived from the}} firm's post-war work on sailplanes, and reflecting its sailplane heritage in its slender, <b>tapering</b> <b>wings.</b> With {{the success of the}} Magister, a new plant was established at Toulouse in 1953 specifically for its manufacture.|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} study of pitching-moment data on <b>tapered</b> <b>wings</b> indicated that excellent agreement with test data {{was obtained by}} locating the quarter-chord point of the average chord on the average quarter-chord point of the semispan. The study was therefore extended to include most of the available data on tapered-wing models tested by the NACA...|$|R
2500|$|The most {{immediately}} obvious {{difference between}} the two designs was that the Fafnir 2 was a mid-wing aircraft. [...] The original Fafnir had a high wing and initially suffered serious aerodynamic drag losses at the wing-fuselage junctions. [...] Wind tunnel studies at the University of Göttingen showed that these losses were lower with mid-wing designs. They also suggested that the wing and fuselage be integrated and the latter be cambered to provide some lift. [...] The strongly <b>tapered</b> <b>wing</b> was ply covered ahead of the single spar, forming a torsion resisting D-box, and fabric covered aft over most of the span, though the surface near the fuselage was wholly ply covered. The wing section, designed by Lippisch himself, was much thinner and less cambered than on the Fafnir, with less low speed lift but also less high speed drag, reflecting the increasing understanding that cross country gliding required speed between thermals as well as the ability to climb within them. As on the original Fafnir, only the inner 40% of the span had dihedral. Tapered ailerons, their chord increasing outwards, occupied all the trailing edge of the outer panels.|$|E
2500|$|In December 1944 Hawker refined the {{proposed}} design substantially. The jet exhaust was moved {{from beneath the}} tail and re-designed as two short split-lateral [...] exhausts (which gained the name [...] "trouser legs"), embedded in {{the trailing edge of}} the wing root, which needed a corresponding thickening of the wing root; the air intakes were moved to the wing root leading edge, similar to the contemporary de Havilland Vampire. The shorter unusual bifurcated jet pipe reduced pressure losses in the jet pipe and had the additional advantage of freeing up space in the rear fuselage for fuel tanks, which gave the aircraft [...] a longer range than many other early jets. The absence of fuel tanks also meant a thinner wing could be adopted without the penalty of reduced range; to ease manufacture, the elliptical wingform of the Fury was discarded in favour of a straight <b>tapered</b> <b>wing</b> design. The fuselage fuel tanks, being fore and aft of the engine, also provided for a stable centre of gravity during flight. The tail plane was raised in order to clear the jet exhausts. The Sea Hawk also featured a nosewheel undercarriage arrangement, the first for a Hawker-built aircraft. The aircraft was built to accommodate four 20mm Hispano-Suiza Mk. V cannons.|$|E
