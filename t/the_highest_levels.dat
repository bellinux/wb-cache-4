5|$|Fischer heavily disparaged chess {{as it was}} {{currently}} being played (at <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>levels).</b> As a result, on June 19, 1996, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Fischer announced and advocated a variant of chess called Fischerandom Chess (later known as Chess960). The goal of Fischerandom Chess was {{to ensure that a}} game between two players is a contest between their understandings of chess, rather than their abilities to memorize opening lines or prepare opening strategies.|$|E

50|$|Multi-level caches can be {{designed}} in various ways {{depending on whether the}} content of one cache is present in other level of caches. If all blocks in <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> cache are also present in the lower level cache, then the lower level cache is said to be inclusive of <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> cache. If <b>the</b> lower level cache contains blocks that are not present in <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> cache, then <b>the</b> lower level cache is said to be exclusive of <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>level</b> cache.

5|$|A {{study of}} trace {{elements}} in mushrooms {{in the eastern}} Black Sea Region of Turkey found E.sinuatum to have <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>levels</b> of copper (64.8 ± 5.9μg/g dried material—insufficient to be toxic) and zinc (198μg/g) recorded. Caps and stalks tested in an area {{with high levels of}} mercury in southeastern Poland showed it to bioaccumulate much higher levels of mercury than other fungi. The element was also found in high levels in the humus-rich substrate. Entoloma sinuatum also accumulates arsenic-containing compounds. Of the roughly 40μg of arsenic present per gram of fresh mushroom tissue, about 8% was arsenite and the other 92% was arsenate.|$|E

5|$|A third form of progeny {{arises when}} F1 hybrids are bred with animals genetically {{dissimilar}} to their parents. If heterozygosity is maintained or increased as a result, hybrid vigour and other production benefits {{occurring in the}} F1 generation will be maintained or increased. Maintenance of heterozygosity {{is the key to}} maintaining <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>levels</b> of hybrid vigour. This requires complex breeding programmes and high levels of management. Simplified crossbreeding programmes have been developed using hybrid or composite bulls, which was the motivation behind the development of Lim-Flex hybrids.|$|E
5|$|After {{spending}} {{his childhood in}} his birth town of Ponce, Paoli moved to Spain where, {{with the assistance of}} his well-connected sister Amalia, he obtained a Royal scholarship to take singing lessons in Italy. After singing to standing ovation crowds in both Spain and Italy, Paoli made his grand debut in Paris, France, where he was encouraged to perform on <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>levels</b> of the world stage. Before the end of the 19th century and while Paoli was still in his twenties, he went on a tour of Europe that earned him both popular acclaim, and imperial honors from princes, kings, and emperors.|$|E
5|$|Dayton Project {{employees}} {{were not allowed}} to eat or smoke in processing areas, and had to scrub their hands before leaving these areas. They also had to shower {{at the end of each}} day's work, and were subjected to weekly urine tests. Employees with elevated levels of polonium were not allowed in the processing areas. Working with polonium without spreading contamination proved to be almost impossible. Fortunately, it was not a bone-seeker like radium or plutonium, and was readily excreted in urine. Detection methods had already been developed, making it easy to track. The employee at Unit IV with <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>levels</b> of polonium in her urine had contaminated her hair, and often held bobby pins in her mouth.|$|E
50|$|The {{closure of}} the Three Bridges-Ashurst Junction line after the last train on Sunday 1 January 1967 spelt the end for <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> station and St Margaret's Loop which would receive no further traffic. The goods yard had been {{virtually}} closed for some time except for coal and all freight facilities were formally withdrawn as from 10 April. Although very nearly redundant, <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> goods sidings could still be accessed via <b>the</b> low to <b>high</b> <b>level</b> connecting spur; both spurs serving <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> station were however closed in 1967. The last train to use the station was in February 1968, a tracklifting train hauled by a Class 33 diesel locomotive. As the footbridge at the low-level platforms had been demolished in Summer 1965, passengers used <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> station as a short-cut between platforms, thereby avoiding the need to go around a local housing estate. <b>The</b> <b>high</b> <b>level's</b> demolition in 1970 led to protests from passengers {{at the loss of}} the short-cut, as a result of which British Rail erected a footbridge which today marks the site of <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>level</b> station.|$|R
50|$|For scheduling, the {{scheduler}} always starts {{picking up}} processes {{from the head}} of <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>level</b> queue. Only if <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>level</b> queue has become empty will the scheduler take up a process from the next lower level queue.

5|$|Despite the scare {{over his}} back complaint, Miller {{returned}} from New Zealand {{to play in}} the 1946 season, {{which turned out to be}} his last season in the VFL; St Kilda's finished second-last. Miller played with more aggression than during his pre-war years and his high leaping marks were a noted feature of a season that saw him chosen to represent Victoria against South Australia. Miller thus became one of the few players to play at <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>levels</b> of both cricket and Australian rules football.|$|E
5|$|Hunting {{with lead}} shot, {{along with the}} use of lead sinkers in angling, has been {{identified}} as a major cause of lead poisoning in waterfowl, which often feed off the bottom of lakes and wetlands where the shot collects. A Spanish study showed that northern pintail and common pochard were the species with <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>levels</b> of lead shot ingestion, higher than in northern countries of the western Palearctic flyway, where lead shot has been banned. In the United States, Canada, and many western European countries, all shot used for waterfowl must now be non-toxic, and therefore may not contain any lead.|$|E

5|$|In other areas, {{such as the}} Mediterranean, some {{individuals}} have adverse reactions to apples because of their similarity to peaches. This form of apple allergy also includes OAS, but often has more severe symptoms, such as vomiting, abdominal pain and urticaria, and can be life-threatening. Individuals with this form of allergy can also develop reactions to other fruits and nuts. Cooking does not break down the protein causing this particular reaction, so affected individuals can eat neither raw nor cooked apples. Freshly harvested, over-ripe fruits tend to have <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>levels</b> of the protein that causes this reaction.|$|E

Some 3,900vehicles used this segment of trunkline daily in 2007. Outside of town, the trunkline runs south of Runkle Lake through hilly, wooded terrain. The roadway crosses the southern section of the Michigamme River west of the Dickinson County line.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the move from Zeus to Nike-X was concern that the Zeus radars would not be able to tell the {{difference}} between the warhead and a decoy until it was too late to launch. One solution to this problem was the Sprint missile, which had the performance required to wait until decluttering was complete. Another potential solution was to look for some sort of signature of the reentry through <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>levels</b> of the atmosphere that might differ between a warhead and decoy; specifically, it appeared that the ablation of the heat shield might produce a clear signature pointing out the warhead.|$|E
