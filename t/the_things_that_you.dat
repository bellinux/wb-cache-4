For much of his career, Harrison repeatedly identified Dylan {{as one of his}} biggest musical influences, along with Ravi Shankar. To Inglis, these verse-two lines reflect the level of Harrison's respect for his work, since [...] "while millions of others may look to the Beatles for guidance, he looks to Dylan".|$|E
500|$|Quenya nouns {{can have}} up to four numbers: {{singular}}, general plural ("plural 1"), particular/partitive plural ("plural 2"), and dual. However, not all Quenya nouns can have all four numbers since {{some of them are}} pluralia tantum (plural only) having no singular variant for referring to a single object, such as armar [...] "goods (things for sale, or <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> own)"; some other nouns, especially monosyllabic ones, use only one of the two plurals judged the most aesthetic by Elves (i. e.

500|$|When Stephen King {{created the}} {{character}} of Flagg, he based him around what he believed evil represented. To King, Flagg is [...] "somebody who’s very charismatic, laughs a lot, [...] tremendously attractive {{to men and women}} both, and [...] somebody who just appeals to the worst in all of us". This idea carries over into The Stand, in which Flagg first appears as the personification of evil opposing Mother Abagail, the personification of good. Character Tom Cullen ascribes to Flagg the ability to kill animals and inflict cancer at will, referring to him as the demon Legion, while character Glen Bateman refers to him as the Lovecraftian entity Nyarlathotep, among other ancient names. King wanted Flagg to embody a [...] "gigantic evil", although he intended the character to weaken by the end of The Stand. He said, [...] "I think the Devil is probably a pretty funny guy. Flagg is like the archetype of everything that I know about real evil, going back all the way to Charles Starkweather in the '50s—he is somebody who is empty and who has to be filled with other people's hates, fears, resentments, laughs. Flagg, Koresh, Jim Jones, Hitler—they're all basically the same guy". Although Flagg was not intended to represent Satan, this did not detract from what King sees as his ultimate goal. He notes that no matter who sees him or how he is seen as Flagg appears differently to different individuals, his message is the same: [...] "I know all <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> want and I can give them to you and {{all you have to do}} is give me your soul".|$|E

2500|$|The song's message {{recalls that}} of Dylan's September 1965 single [...] "Positively 4th Street", as Harrison {{appears to be}} ending a relationship, {{possibly}} with a lover. The lyrics adopt an accusatory stance from the opening line: [...] "I've got {{a word or two}} to say about <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> do." [...] Author Ian Inglis describes the song as [...] "a withering attack" [...] in which [...] "Harrison's blunt 'I left you far behind' and Dylan's curt 'It's not my problem' [...] could be spoken by the same voice." [...] Harrison also incorporates Dylan-esque surrealism in his reference to [...] "opaque" [...] minds and in the line [...] "the good things that we can have if we close our eyes".|$|E
2500|$|Paul Cantor, in {{his short}} text called simply Hamlet, formulates a {{compelling}} {{theory of the}} play that places the prince {{at the center of}} the Renaissance conflict between Ancient and Christian notions of heroism. Cantor says that the Renaissance signified a [...] "rebirth of classical antiquity within a Christian culture". But such a rebirth brought with it a deep contradiction: Christ's teachings of humility and meekness ("whoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also") are in direct conflict with the ancient ethos that is best represented by Achilles' violent action in the Iliad ("I wish only that my spirit and fury would drive me to hack your meat away and eat it raw for <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have done to me").|$|E

2500|$|However, {{recording}} did {{not begin}} until April 2010. Friend and Pretty. Odd. producer Rob Mathes was [...] "like family" [...] to Smith and Urie, inspiring them to be excited to record despite the duo's initial beginning.

Just {{get out of bed}} in the morning, don’t loathe <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> actually love doing, because it’s just going to keep you down," [...] for which Urie recalled the band [...] "owed a lot" [...] for. After working with the demos produced during the summer with Feldmann for several months afterward, the duo decided they weren't satisfactory, so the band started over with new material. The biggest difference for the band was that it was now half the previous band, with Urie and Smith writing everything. The album was produced by Feldmann and Butch Walker. Urie recalled that they were initially nervous to experiment with new producers, but instead regarded Feldmann and Walker's input positively, regarding their help as [...] "Hey, this is your record, I want to help you with your ideas. So you bring me the ideas, and we’ll help you do that. I don’t want to write anything for you, this is your record, it has to be your voice." [...] The band continued working with Feldmann for four months in early 2010, later going to Walker to finalize and improve the songs.|$|E
