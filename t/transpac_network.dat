50|$|CFT was for {{mainframe}} computers {{using the}} French X.25-based <b>Transpac</b> <b>network,</b> but was later ported to use Internet protocols (TCP/IP) as well. Client software must be purchased from Axway, {{and includes a}} license manager that enforce machine and transfer limits.|$|E
50|$|Data {{transmission}} was a {{state monopoly}} in France at the time, and IRIA needed a special dispensation to run the CYCLADES network. The PTT did not agree to funding {{by the government of}} a competitor to their <b>Transpac</b> <b>network,</b> and insisted that the permission and funding be rescinded. By 1981, Cyclades was forced to shut down.|$|E
5000|$|Minitel {{used the}} {{existing}} <b>Transpac</b> <b>network</b> for commercial users; its popularity caused problems for its existing commercial users. After a severe disruption in June 1985, France Télécom divided business and Minitel traffic. When connecting, the Minitel integrated modem generally dialed a special number connecting to a PAVI (Point d'Accès VIdéotexte, [...] "videotext access point"). The PAVI transmitted {{information to the}} servers of the appropriate company or administration using Transpac.|$|E
50|$|By 1976, the French PTT was {{developing}} <b>Transpac,</b> a packet <b>network</b> {{based on the}} emerging X.25 standard. The academic debates between datagram and virtual circuit networks continued for some time, but were eventually cut short by bureaucratic decisions.|$|R
50|$|In , Rémi Després — {{who was one}} of {{the creators}} of the <b>Transpac</b> data <b>network</b> in France in the 1970s — {{proposed}} to Free, the second largest ISP in France, to use the 6rd mechanism he had invented to rapidly deploy IPv6. While Free had until then no short-term plan to offer IPv6 service, Rani Assaf, the CTO of Free, immediately decided to implement the solution. Five weeks later, with due marketing approval and operational validation, the press release announcing that IPv6 was available to Free's customers was issued.|$|R
50|$|Jean-Marc Jézéquel {{received}} an engineering degree from Telecom Bretagne in 1986 and a PhD from the University of Rennes 1 in Rennes in 1989. He then {{worked for the}} <b>Transpac</b> (<b>network)</b> company on an Intelligent Network project. In 1991, he became a researcher (Chargé de recherche) at the CNRS (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique). During most of 1996, {{he has been an}} invited researcher in Pr. Yonezawa's lab, in the University of Tokyo, Japan.|$|E
50|$|From 1971 to 1980, Rémi Després was {{in charge}} of R&D of the French PTT on packet switching. As such, he {{clarified}} and formalized the concept of Virtual Circuits. With his team at CNET, he validated it on the RCP experimental network. He then successfully submitted for the X.25 Recommendation of CCITT, the standard of Data networks of the 1970s - 1980's. He was the first Chief Technical Officer in charge of the French <b>Transpac</b> <b>network</b> whose X.25 service has been operational from 1978 to 2011.|$|E
40|$|Transcript, 23 pp. In this interview, Rémi Després, who was {{the main}} {{architect}} of the <b>Transpac</b> <b>network,</b> describes {{the context in which}} the first packet-switching networks began in France in the 70 ’s. He also describes his role in European data networking history and the birth of the X. 25 recommendation at CCITT in 1976. This set of nine interviews conducted with Tilly Bayard-Richard, Najah Naffah, Louis Pouzin, Marc E. Levilion, Michel Gien, Jean-Louis Grangé, Gérard Le Lann, Rémi Després, and André Danthine was funded by the ACM History Committee with a fellowship on “European Contributions to Computer Networks: An Oral History Project. ”ACM History Committe...|$|E
