He also expresses doubts that Ali, as it is alleged, had made a chronologically arranged collection. Darwaza was very critical of other modern interpreters who used certain verses of the Quran to deduce and support scientific theories. He argues <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> have done harm to Islam by trivializing the sacred character of the Quran.|$|E

It is {{important}} to note that 5,629,429 people (3.94% of the overall population.) did not declare any ethnic origin, compared to about 1 million in the 2002 Census. This is due to the fact <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> were counted from administrative databases and not directly, and were therefore unable to state their ethnicity. Therefore, the percentages mentioned above are taken from the total population that declared their ethnicity, given that the non-declared remainder is thought to have an ethnic composition similar to the declared segment.|$|E

500|$|Following {{a hunger}} strike, an IRA {{prisoner}} named Frank Stagg died in Wakefield Prison on 12 February 1976. [...] The case brought international media attention as the British Government denied Stagg's last {{request for a}} military funeral march from Dublin to Ballina, and instead arranged {{for the police to}} bury him secretly. [...] On 1 March 1976, Merlyn Rees, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in the Wilson ministry, announced <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> convicted of causing terrorist offences would no longer be entitled to Special Category Status. The policy was not introduced for existing prisoners, but for those convicted of offences after 1 March 1976. The end to Special Category Status was a serious threat to the authority which the paramilitary leaderships inside prison had been able to exercise over their own men, as well as being a propaganda blow.|$|E
500|$|The second episode {{included}} {{the death of}} a main character. The idea was originally going {{to be used in the}} series finale. However, the producers did not know how to fill in episode two, so the death was moved up. According to Wolstencroft, the inclusion of Helen's death was to give the audience the message that [...] "the world of Spooks isn't the world where the cavalry always arrive, because in reality these people [...] do risk their lives on our behalf and they do get into sticky situations with genuinely nasty people." [...] The producers also wanted main characters to die on occasion rather than on a weekly or bi-weekly basis; otherwise it would show MI5 officers as not doing their jobs properly. Although Spooks is a serious show, the writers add occasional humour from the characters. According to Wolstencroft, he felt that anybody who works in such an occupation with high responsibilities tends to have humour around, and <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> make jokes even though they have seen [...] "heinous things". This became the basis for creating Jools Siviter.|$|E

Then I thought, well now Germany has lost, now America has saved us from this nightmare, but since nobody can doubt on which side I stood, I'll see what can be done from a literary point of view in favor of the Nazis.

2500|$|The poem {{addresses}} and interrogates {{the concept of}} the noble savage, an idea which had gained popular currency in the Romantic Age which held <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> who live further from [...] "civilization" [...] live [...] "in harmony with nature and a more simple, childlike and blessed life" [...] than the alienated and unhappy people in European cities. Aleko's failure to integrate with the gypsies and his continued insistence on the moral standards of the city in the gypsy encampment challenge the notion that happiness can be found by reverting to nature. The poem closes with a clear attack on the idea of the noble savage: [...] "But even among you, poor sons of nature, there is no happiness! Tormenting dreams live below your bedraggled tents".

Another, Volunteer G, was quoted as saying that he [...] "never agreed with Kingsmill". Republican activist Peter John Caraher said that those ultimately responsible were [...] "the loyalists who shot the Reavey brothers". He added, [...] "It was sad <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> [...] had to die, but I'll tell you something, it stopped any more Catholics being killed". This view was reiterated by a County Tyrone republican and Gaelic Athletic Association veteran who spoke to Ed Moloney. [...] "It's a lesson you learn quickly on the football field...

Colin Worton, whose brother was killed in the massacre, said [...] "Kingsmill did stop Catholics being killed in South Armagh, but that doesn't justify it".|$|E

2500|$|When John Howard's Coalition {{government}} came {{to power}} in 1996, it intervened in the Hindmarsh Island bridge controversy with legislation that introduced an exception to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984, in order to allow the bridge to proceed. The Ngarrindjeri challenged the new legislation in the High Court on the basis that it was discriminatory to declare that the Heritage Protection Act applied to sites everywhere but Hindmarsh Island, and that such discrimination – essentially {{on the basis of race}} – had been disallowed since the Commonwealth was granted the power to make laws with respect to the [...] "Aboriginal race" [...] as a result of the 1967 Referendum. The High Court decided, by a majority, that the amended s.51(xxvi) of the Constitution still did not restrict the Commonwealth parliament to making laws solely for the benefit of any particular [...] "race", but still empowered the parliament to make laws that were to the detriment of any race. This decision effectively meant <b>that</b> <b>those</b> <b>people</b> who had believed that they were casting a vote against the discrimination of Indigenous people in 1967 had in fact allowed the Commonwealth to participate in the discrimination against Indigenous people which had been practised by the States.|$|E
