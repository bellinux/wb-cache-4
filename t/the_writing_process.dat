The research was carried out at the first semester from September 20 th to October 13 rd, 2010. It involved the English teacher and the students of Grade X B. The steps were reconnaissance, planning and observations, and reflections. The research was conducted in two cycles. The problems of this research were the Students’ passiveness in <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> teaching-learning <b>process,</b> <b>the</b> teacher does not pay much attention to the students, the students’ lack of vocabulary, the students’ tendency to copy their friends’ work to finish the task, and the materials given are uninteresting. The actions were implemented the CIRC (Cooperative Integrated Reading and Composition) method and The Text-Based Approach, namely BKOF, MOT, JCOT, and ICOT. The researcher also gave interesting materials. The data were obtained by interviewing the English teacher, and the students of Grade X B, observing <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> teaching-learning <b>process</b> and taking pictures in the teaching-learning process. The key instrument was the researcher. The data were in the forms of interview transcripts, field notes and photographs. The implementation of the method and technique were obviously effective to improve the students’ motivation and interest in <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> teaching-learning <b>process.</b> <b>The</b> improvement covers (1) the students’ interest toward <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> teaching-learning <b>process,</b> (2) <b>the</b> students’ enthusiasm in reading, (3) the students’ involvement in <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> teaching-learning <b>process,</b> (4) <b>the</b> students’ concentration during <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> teaching-learning <b>process,</b> and (5) the students’ cooperation during <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> teaching-learning <b>process...</b>|$|R

Though most songs originated from a guitar or bass riff from Ballou or Newton, all members had equal input on <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>process,</b> with each member proposing different songs.

During this time, Cochrane published articles in Res Publica, Utilitas and Political Studies presenting aspects of his interest-based theory of animal rights, which is defended in the final chapter of An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory.

5|$|The game's {{script was}} written by Naotaka Hayashi, a staff writer at 5pb. whose most notable work {{at the time was}} visual novel Steins;Gate. After playing through Steins;Gate on the {{recommendation}} of another staff member, Asano decided that Hayashi would be able to create the appealing characters and surprising scenario needed for the story, and asked 5pb. if Hayashi could work on Bravely Default. Another reason Asano wanted Hayashi was due to the plot's heavy use of parallel worlds. Hayashi's work on the game involved creating the plot and character settings. While he wrote the majority of the game's dialogue, more detailed work was given to writers at Square Enix and Silicon Studio. One of the supplementary writers was Silicon Studio's Keiichi Ajiro, who wrote the contents of D's Notebook. Ajiro also created the initial story outline with Asano. The initial story concept was kept deliberately simple, but its complexity increased during <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>process.</b> During his work, Hayashi was given guidelines by Square Enix about the characters and story: for instance, Asano wanted the heroes and villains to be equally compelling, along with raising the game's targeted age group. Something that Hayashi needed to remember during <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>process</b> was the need to limit the length of dialogue segments. While visual novels had a high leeway for dialogue quantity, Asano would make requests such as a sentence being within a 22-character limit, and to not overrun into multiple dialogue boxes.|$|E

[...] In her dissertation, Dyson drew heavily from scholars such as Britton, Vygotsky,Ferreiro,and others who emphasized the critical role that oral language has in literacy learning. For instance, Britton was quoted by Dyson as stating: “All that <b>the</b> children <b>write,</b> your response to what they write, their response to each other, all this takes place afloat upon a sea of talk. Talk is what provides the links between you and them and what they have written, between what they have written and each other.” [...] In her dissertation,Dyson elected qualitative research to investigate the role of oral language in <b>the</b> early <b>writing</b> <b>processes</b> of five kindergarten students over a three-month period. During her case study she collected data, such as observational notes, audio recordings of children’s talk, written products, daily log entries, child and parent interviews, and informal assessment tasks. At the conclusion of this study, some of Dyson's findings include: that talk {{is an integral part of}} <b>the</b> early <b>writing</b> <b>process,</b> young children <b>write</b> for different purposes, and that there is no one early <b>writing</b> <b>process.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Open Door is {{the second}} studio album by American rock band Evanescence. It was {{released}} on September 25, 2006, through Wind-up Records.

The record symbolizes a new beginning for the band, incorporating new elements into their previous musical styles, including gothic rock, symphonic rock and pop music as well as the use of choirs on several songs. <b>The</b> <b>writing</b> <b>process</b> for the album took over 18 months to complete; most of the songs were written by Amy Lee and Terry Balsamo, while production was handled by Dave Fortman.|$|E

These scripts generally include cutaway gags. Various gags are pitched to MacFarlane and the rest of the staff, and those deemed funniest are included in the episode. MacFarlane has explained that normally it takes 10 months to produce an episode because the show uses hand-drawn animation. The show rarely comments on current events for this reason. The show's initial writers had never written for an animated show; and most came from live-action sitcoms.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>writing</b> <b>process</b> for Pleasant Dreams {{began in}} January 1981. With Sire Records {{management}} being insistent on allowing a celebrity record producer {{to work on}} the album, they hired Graham Gouldman—songwriter and musician for the British band 10cc—to produce the album. Prior to working with Gouldman, the Ramones had been with audio engineer Ed Stasium to record several demos and, though Sire rejected, the band had intended that Steve Lillywhite produce the album. The studio recording process began on March 30, 1981, and initiated several conflicts between band members. This tension was partially due to Dee Dee Ramone's drug addiction. Additionally, Marky Ramone and Joey Ramone were both developing alcohol problems, resulting in the frustration of Johnny Ramone. These conflicts and differences became evident in the song writing, as each song was credited to individual rather than multiple members; Pleasant Dreams was the first album in which writing is acknowledged this way.|$|E
