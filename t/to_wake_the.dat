5|$|The Dawn of Love, {{also known}} as Venus Now Wakes, and Wakens Love, is an oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1828 and currently in the Russell-Cotes Art Gallery & Museum in Bournemouth. Loosely based on a passage from John Milton's 1634 masque Comus, it shows a nude Venus leaning across <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>the</b> sleeping Love by stroking his wings. While Etty often included nude figures in his work he rarely depicted physical intimacy, and owing to this The Dawn of Love {{is one of his}} more unusual paintings. The open sensuality of the work was intended to present a challenge to the viewer mirroring the plot of Comus, in which the heroine is tempted by desire but remains rational and detached.|$|E
5|$|The police's {{operating}} procedure—and the {{law which}} governed their actions—meant {{they were unable}} to open fire without being fired upon first. This, along with the structure of the building, which had a narrow, winding stairwell up which police would have to pass, meant any approach to the gang members was too perilous to attempt. It was decided to wait until dawn before taking any action. At about 7:30am a policeman knocked on the door of number 100, which elicited no response; stones were then thrown at the window <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>the</b> men. Svaars and Sokoloff appeared at the window and opened fire at the police. A police sergeant was wounded in the chest: he was evacuated under fire across the rooftops, and taken to the London Hospital. Some members of the police returned fire, but their guns were only effective over shorter ranges, and proved ineffective against the comparatively advanced automatic weapons of Svaars and Sokoloff.|$|E
5|$|With {{help from}} a peasant named Ratpouch, Diermot manages {{to escape from the}} dungeon and visits Luthern, the blacksmith. Luthern reveals that a girl named Goewin who runs a herb shop has {{recently}} disappeared. Diermot discovers that she had been arrested by the Skorl. With help from Ratpouch, Diermot breaks into the house of Taidgh, the magician, where he creates a potion which disguises him as Selena. He enters the mansion where Goewin is being held and orders the Skorl to free her. Not long after, a man named Mallin gives Diermot a book wrapped in cloth to take to a man named Morkus. In the process of delivering the book, Diermot sees a notice stating that whoever returns the book to its rightful owner will be rewarded. Diermot delivers the book to a man named Toby, who rewards him with a statuette. Toby reveals that the dragon can help Diermot defeat Selena, but that he will need an infusion made of three herbs <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>the</b> dragon up, which Goewin then makes for Diermot.|$|E

5|$|In 1896, Baden-Powell was {{assigned}} to the Matabeleland region in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) as Chief of Staff to Gen. Frederick Carrington during the Second Matabele War, and it was here (in June, 1896) that he first met and began a lifelong friendship with Frederick Russell Burnham, the American-born Chief of Scouts for the British Army in Africa. This was a formative experience for Baden-Powell not only because he had the time of his life commanding reconnaissance missions into enemy territory, but because many of his later Boy Scout ideas took hold here. During their joint scouting patrols into the Matobo Hills, Burnham augmented Baden-Powell's woodcraft skills, inspiring him and sowing seeds for both the programme and for the code of honour later published in Scouting for Boys. Practised by frontiersmen of the American Old West and Indigenous peoples of the Americas, woodcraft was generally little known to the British Army but well-known to the American scout Burnham. These skills eventually formed the basis of what is now called scoutcraft, the fundamentals of Scouting. Both men recognised that wars in Africa were changing markedly and the British Army needed to adapt; so during their joint scouting missions, Baden-Powell and Burnham discussed the concept of a broad training programme in woodcraft for young men, rich in exploration, tracking, fieldcraft, and self-reliance. It was also during this time in the Matobo Hills that Baden-Powell first started to wear his signature campaign hat like the one worn by Burnham, and it was here that Baden-Powell acquired his Kudu horn, the Ndebele war instrument he later used every morning at Brownsea Island <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>the</b> first Boy Scouts and to call them together in training courses.|$|E

Ovlur now arrives to say that he has prepared horses for Igor and Vladimir and Igor now agrees to escape. The distressed Konchakovna comes, challenging Vladimir to show his love by either taking her with him or by staying.

500|$|Beginning in 1942, the Blair family began leasing the {{property}} to the U.S. government for use by visiting dignitaries; the government purchased {{the property}} outright the following December.

500|$|Etty's {{painting}} {{is not a}} direct illustration of a scene from Comus. Instead, it is inspired by an early passage in which Comus, prior to his meeting with The Lady, muses {{on the notion that}} sin is only problematic if others become aware of it, and thus that it is right and natural to surrender to base desires while under cover of darkness, arguing that [...] "What hath night to do with sleep? Night hath better sweets to prove, Venus now wakes, and wakens Love". Etty's painting shows the nude Venus, as [...] "Goddess of nocturnal sport", reaching across <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>the</b> sleeping Love by stroking his wings. While Etty had built his reputation on his renowned ability to paint realistic human figures, Venus in The Dawn of Love is highly stylised, and painted in a deliberate pastiche of the style of Rubens.|$|E

500|$|Around 2:00a.m., a few {{boats were}} finally {{procured}} for the crossing.

[...] Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham, the assistant to the fort's commander, Captain William Delaplace, was awakened by the noise, and called <b>to</b> <b>wake</b> <b>the</b> captain. Stalling for time, he demanded to know by what authority the fort was being entered. Allen, who later claimed that he said it to Captain Delaplace, said, [...] "In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!" [...] Delaplace finally emerged from his chambers, fully dressed, and surrendered his sword. The rest of the fort's garrison surrendered without firing a shot. The only casualty had been a British soldier who became concussed after Allen hit the soldier with a cutlass, hitting the man's hair comb and saving his life.|$|E

However, boats did not arrive until 1:30am, and they were inadequate to carry the whole force. Eighty-three of the Green Mountain Boys made the first crossing with Arnold and Allen, and Douglas went back for the rest. As dawn approached, Allen and Arnold became fearful of losing the element of surprise, {{so they decided to}} attack with the men at hand. The only sentry on duty at the south gate fled his post after his musket misfired, and the Americans rushed into the fort. [...] The Patriots then roused the small number of sleeping troops at gunpoint, and began confiscating their weapons. [...] Allen, Arnold, and a few other men charged up the stairs toward the officers' quarters.

2500|$|Williamsburg {{was still}} a sleepy little town in the early 20th century. Some newer {{structures}} were interspersed with colonial-era buildings, but the town was much less progressive than other busier communities of similar size in Virginia.
