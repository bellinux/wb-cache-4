5|$|Flagstaff {{is fairly}} bike-friendly; there are bike lanes on many major streets, and the Flagstaff Urban Trails System (FUTS) {{includes}} more than 50 miles of off-street <b>trails</b> <b>that</b> wind throughout the community. In 2006 Flagstaff was designated a Bicycle-Friendly Community by the League of American Bicyclists. About nine percent of trips in Flagstaff are made by bicycle.|$|E
5|$|Settlers {{arrived in}} the area from Bella Coola in the early 1900s to {{establish}} ranches. One particular ranch, the Home Ranch, used the Blackwater Trail between the Ilgachuz and Itcha ranges to carry supplies and cattle to be sold at cattle sales in the small city of Quesnel. Remains of this ranch are still present, {{as well as many}} <b>trails</b> <b>that</b> were used as supply routes.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the highway system in Michigan {{dates back to the}} old Native American <b>trails</b> <b>that</b> crossed the state. These trails were {{pathways}} no wider than approximately , permitting single-file traffic. Many of the modern highways in the state follow the path of these old trails, including the Great Trail from Fort Pitt to Fort Detroit which is now US24 from Detroit to Toledo, Ohio. This trail connected with Braddock's Road which led to the Atlantic Coast.|$|E

50|$|Gangnim {{followed}} the directions {{into a place}} where the road branched in seventy-seven different ways. There was already an old man there. As the old man ate his sirutteok, Gangnim discovered that it was again same as his own tteok. The man was Munshin, the door god. Munshin told him the names of all seventy-seven trails. They included 'the <b>trail</b> <b>that</b> was made when the sky and earth were one', 'the <b>trail</b> <b>that</b> was made when the sky and earth were parted', 'the <b>trail</b> <b>that</b> was made in the creation of man', 'the <b>trail</b> <b>that</b> the Cheonjiwang of the Sky uses', 'the <b>trail</b> <b>that</b> the Cheonjiwang of the Earth uses', 'the <b>trail</b> <b>that</b> the Chenjiwang of man uses', 'the mountain trail', 'the money trail', 'the trail of the officials', 'the trail of the kings', 'the trail of the nation', 'the trail of the dead', 'the trail of the Sanshin king', 'the trail of the Sanshin officials', and 'the trail of the five dragons'. Finally, Munshin pointed out the seventy-seventh trail; 'the trail of Gangnim the Mortal'. Gangnim headed on <b>that</b> <b>trail.</b>|$|R
5|$|In the 1860s and 1870s, {{the city}} {{became a major}} {{outfitting}} center for the major <b>trails</b> <b>that</b> went across Nebraska, including the Oregon, California and Mormon Trails. Jobbers Canyon was built in Downtown Omaha {{for the purpose of}} outfitting these migrants. Stagecoach lines had arrived by 1858, including the Local Stage Coach Company in 1857, and the Western Stage Company which began its easterly and westerly routes in Omaha. The Pony Express and Wells Fargo lines maintained offices in the city.|$|E
5|$|Pioneers {{traveling}} in wagon trains on the Oregon Trail in the 1850s and 1860s followed an alternative route {{in the area}} that used old Indian <b>trails</b> <b>that</b> skirted the lava flows. This alternative route was later named Goodale's Cutoff and part of it is {{in the northern part of}} the monument. The cutoff was created to reduce the possibility of ambush by Shoshone warriors along the Snake River such as the one that occurred at Massacre Rocks, which today is memorialized in Idaho's Massacre Rocks State Park.|$|E
5|$|Most park {{visitors}} sightsee {{using the}} scenic drive, which {{provides access to}} 13 viewpoints over the amphitheaters. Bryce Canyon has eight marked and maintained hiking <b>trails</b> <b>that</b> can be hiked {{in less than a}} day (round trip time, trailhead): Mossy Cave (one hour, State Route 12 northwest of Tropic), Rim Trail (5–6 hours, anywhere on rim), Bristlecone Loop (one hour, Rainbow Point), and Queens Garden (1–2 hours, Sunrise Point) are easy to moderate hikes. Navajo Loop (1–2 hours, Sunset Point) and Tower Bridge (2–3 hours, north of Sunrise Point) are moderate hikes. Fairyland Loop (4–5 hours, Fairyland Point) and Peekaboo Loop (3–4 hours, Bryce Point) are strenuous hikes. Several of these trails intersect, allowing hikers to combine routes for more challenging hikes.|$|E
50|$|Light Blue Trail: 0.8-mile <b>trail</b> <b>that</b> {{parallels}} the northwestern {{portion of the}} White Trail between Sixty Foot Road and Seymore Road.Orange Trail: 0.7-mile <b>trail</b> <b>that</b> connects Shavox Road and the White Trail to the Light Blue Trail.|$|R
50|$|For example, the {{portions}} of the <b>trail</b> <b>that</b> are in Allegany State Park {{are subject to the}} rules of the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation ("NYS OPRHP").

The portions of the <b>trail</b> <b>that</b> pass over county owned lands are subject to the rules of the particular county.|$|R
50|$|Portions of the <b>trail</b> <b>that</b> {{pass over}} private lands are closed during various hunting season (fall turkey season, fall big game season, and spring turkey season.) The {{portions}} of the <b>trail</b> <b>that</b> pass over public lands are generally open all year long including public lands on which hunting is allowed.|$|R
5|$|Wilkins Peak is not gated, {{and it can}} {{be reached}} via an unpaved road known as Wilkins Peak Road that starts on U.S. Route 191 {{southwest}} of Rock Springs, Wyoming. The mountain can also be accessed via another unpaved road that begins in the Scott's Bottom Nature Area in Green River, Wyoming. The peak is accessible year-round, weather permitting. The Green River access road is in worse shape than the Rock Springs side, and it has several road hazards such as steep grades, poor grading, and off-road vehicle traffic. Along with serving radio needs, the peak also is a popular hiking and mountain biking location in the area. There are many smaller roads and <b>trails</b> <b>that</b> spring from the peak that offer varied degrees of challenge.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{communicate}} with each other using pheromones, sounds, and touch. The use of pheromones as chemical signals is more developed in ants, such as the red harvester ant, than in other hymenopteran groups. Like other insects, ants perceive smells with their long, thin, and mobile antennae. The paired antennae provide information about the direction and intensity of scents. Since most ants live on the ground, they use the soil surface to leave pheromone <b>trails</b> <b>that</b> may be followed by other ants. In species that forage in groups, a forager that finds food marks a trail {{on the way back to}} the colony; this trail is followed by other ants, these ants then reinforce the trail when they head back with food to the colony. When the food source is exhausted, no new trails are marked by returning ants and the scent slowly dissipates. This behaviour helps ants deal with changes in their environment. For instance, when an established path to a food source is blocked by an obstacle, the foragers leave the path to explore new routes. If an ant is successful, it leaves a new trail marking the shortest route on its return. Successful trails are followed by more ants, reinforcing better routes and gradually identifying the best path.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1943, the 3rd Battalion {{landed at}} Cape Torokina {{with the rest}} of 3rd Marines, just east of the Koromokina River. While {{resistance}} was extremely light, the rough surf and dense jungle (which in many places extended {{all the way to the}} water) resulted in numerous landing craft being lost or damaged beyond repair. For the next two weeks, the battalion helped construct a series of <b>trails</b> <b>that</b> linked the beachhead with the advancing units, and made supply much easier. On 16 November the battalion reached the Numa Numa Trail and began probing for Japanese units On 18 November after a sharp firefight near a Japanese roadblock the battalion recovered a Japanese map with valuable intelligence on Japanese defenses. From 19–21 November 3rd Battalion continued probing for Japanese units, which had been identified as elements of the 23rd Infantry Regiment, and engaging in sporadic firefights. In the lead-up to the Battle of Piva Forks, 3rd Battalion was able to seize critical high terrain that would give the Marines the advantage in the upcoming fight. The actual battle, from 22–26 November, saw some of the most vicious close combat experienced in the Pacific War as of that date. 3rd Battalion additionally suffered many casualties from unusually accurate Japanese mortar and artillery fire. Two days later, after 27 days of continuous action, 3rd Battalion was moved to a relatively quiet sector on the 3rd Division's flank where it remained for the remainder of the operation.|$|E
