5|$|However, {{the gains}} {{provided}} by Harvey were outweighed by Lindwall's absence, which severely hampered Australia's bowling {{and made their}} eventual victory much more difficult. England made 441 and Australia reached their target of 98 on the final afternoon <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> <b>an</b> eight-wicket victory. Due to his injury, Lindwall was omitted from the team for the two matches {{leading up to the}} Second Test. Australia proceeded to defeat Northamptonshire by an innings before drawing with Yorkshire.|$|E

5|$|After the {{historic}} {{win in the}} Fourth Test, Australia had five tour matches before the final Test. They won three while two ended in rain-curtailed draws. Australia completed the series in style with an innings victory in the Fifth Test at The Oval to complete a 4–0 result. The Fifth Test was the last international match, and the tourists only had seven further matches to negotiate in order to fulfil Bradman's aim of going through the tour undefeated. Apart from two matches that were washed out after Australia had secured first innings leads of more than 200, Bradman's men had little difficulty, winning the remaining five fixtures by an innings. They thus became the first touring Test team <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> <b>an</b> English season undefeated, earning themselves the sobriquet The Invincibles.|$|E

5|$|All Marriott School {{students}} may also earn the Global Management Certificate. To earn the certificate, {{students are required}} to take a business language course, pertinent international business classes, and participate in an international field study or study abroad program. Undergraduate {{students may}} also qualify for graduation honors. University Honors is the highest distinction BYU awards its graduates.

The university also awards Latin scholastic distinctions: summa cum laude top 1 percent, magna cum laude top 5 percent, and cum laude top 10 percent.|$|E
5|$|Another death {{brought about}} a {{creative}} renewal. The passing of Tchaikovsky presented a twofold opportunity—to write for the Imperial Theaters and to compose an opera based on Nikolai Gogol's short story Christmas Eve, a work on which Tchaikovsky had based his opera Vakula the Smith. The success of Rimsky-Korsakov's Christmas Eve encouraged him <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> <b>an</b> opera approximately every 18 months between 1893 and 1908—a total of 11 during this period. He also started and abandoned another draft of his treatise on orchestration, but made a third attempt and almost finished it {{in the last four}} years of his life. (His son-in-law Maximilian Steinberg completed the book in 1912.) Rimsky-Korsakov's scientific treatment of orchestration, illustrated with more than 300 examples from his work, set a new standard for texts of its kind.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{traditionally}} fielded its first-choice team in {{the tour}} opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. Hassett thus played as vice-captain of Bradman's first-choice team and took a catch as Australia dismissed the hosts for 233. However, when Australia batted, Bradman rearranged the order and Hassett came in at No. 7 with Australia’s score at 5/320 after losing 4/55 in a middle-order collapse. Hassett made 25 in 66 minutes with three fours as Australia declared at 8/462; the hosts were bowled out for 212 <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> <b>an</b> Australian victory by an innings and 17 runs. Hassett was rested for next match against Leicestershire, which resulted in another innings win for the tourists.|$|E

5|$|Booth brought {{himself into}} {{contention}} for the Test selection {{with a series}} of strong displays in 196061. He aggregated 981 runs at an average of 65.40, with three centuries. Only five players scored more runs, all at lower averages. Two of the centuries were in combined Australian XI matches {{at the end of the}} season for expected Test squad members. In a match against the Tasmanian Tigers, Booth struck a breezy 100 from 104 balls in 90 minutes of batting. Another highlight was an 87 against the touring West Indies, helping New South Wales <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> <b>an</b> innings win.

5|$|Equestrian {{sports are}} among those contested at the Summer Olympic Games.

Most of these events were later discontinued, although equestrian events have continued through the 2008 Summer Olympics, and now include team and individual dressage, three-day eventing and show-jumping.

During this period, Barnes returned to action after recuperating from his rib injury. Australia then completed the series in style with a convincing innings victory in the Fifth Test at The Oval to complete a 4–0 result. The Fifth Test was the last international match, and the tourists only had seven further matches to negotiate in order to fulfil Bradman's aim of going through the tour undefeated.

After his graduation in December 1910, he was awarded a scholarship <b>to</b> <b>complete</b> <b>an</b> education diploma at the University of Melbourne, but decided to defer for a year in order to teach at schools in country Victoria. He became a schoolteacher, teaching first at Tragowell in the Swan Hill district, and then at Fine View State School in the Horsham district. In 1911 he entered Trinity College at the University of Melbourne. After failing an exam in deductive logic, he decided to quit the state school system, and in 1912 took up a position at The Armidale School in the New England district of New South Wales.
