40|$|The {{influence}} of the stellar plasma on the production and destruction of K-isomers is studied for the examples 176 Lu and 180 Ta. Individual electromagnetic transitions are enhanced predominantly by nuclear excitation by electron capture, whereas the other mechanisms of electron scattering and nuclear excitation by electron transition give only minor contributions. It is found that individual transitions can be enhanced significantly for low transition energies below 100 keV. Transitions with higher energies above 200 keV are practically not affected.

40|$|International audienceCorticosteroids are hormones {{involved}} in many physiological responses such as stress, immune modulation, protein catabolism and water homeostasis. The subfamily of glucocorticoids are used systemically {{in the treatment}} of inflammatory diseases or allergic reactions. In the eye, glucocorticoides are used to treat macular oedema, inflammation and neovascularization. The most commonly used glucocorticoid is Triamcinolone acetonide (TA). The pharmaceutical formulation of TA is not adapted for intravitreal administration but has been selected by ophthalmologists because its very low intraocular solubility provides sustained effect.

40|$|Tantalum (Ta) trabecular metal {{components}} are increasingly used to reconstruct major bone defects in revision arthroplasty surgery. It {{is known that}} some metals such as silver have antibacterial properties. Recent reports have raised the question regarding whether Ta components are protective against infection in revision surgery. This laboratory study aimed to establish whether Ta has intrinsic antibacterial properties against planktonic bacteria, {{or the ability to}} inhibit biofilm formation. Equal-sized pieces of Ta and titanium (Ti) acetabular components were sterilised and incubated with a low dose inoculum of either Staphylococcus (S.) aureus or S. epidermidis for 24 hours. After serial dilution, colony forming units (cfu) were quantified on Mueller-Hinton agar plates. In order to establish whether biofilms formed to a greater extent on one material than the other, these Ta and Ti pieces were then washed twice, sonicated and washed again to remove loosely adhered planktonic bacteria. They were then re-incubated for 24 hours prior to quantifying the number of cfu. All experiments were performed in triplicate. More than 1 x 10 (8) cfu/ml were observed in both the Ta and Ti experiments. After washing and sonication, more than 2 x 10 (7) cfu/ml were observed for both Ta and Ti groups. The results were the same for both S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Compared with Ti controls, Ta did not demonstrate any intrinsic antibacterial activity or ability to inhibit biofilm formation. Hence, intrinsic antimicrobial properties of <b>Ta</b> <b>do</b> not account for the previously observed reduction in the frequency of subsequent infections when Ta was used in revision procedures.

40|$|A large {{database}} of major, trace and isotope (Sr, Nd, Pb, O) data exists for rocks {{produced by the}} volcanic activity of Somma-Vesuvius volcano. Variation diagrams strongly suggest a major role for evolutionary processes such as fractional crystallization, contamination, crystal trapping and magma mixing, occurring after magma genesis in the mantle. Most mafic magmas are enriched in LILE (K, Rb, Ba), REE (Ce, Sm) and Y, show small Nb–Ta negative anomalies, and have values of Nb/Zr at about 0. 15. Enrichments in LILE, REE, Nb and <b>Ta</b> <b>do</b> not correlate with Sr isotope values or degree of both K enrichment and silica undersaturation. The results indicate mantle source heterogeneity produced by slab-derived components beneath the volcano. However, the Sr isotope values of Somma-Vesuvius increase from 0. 7071 up to 0. 7081 with transport through the uppermost 11 – 12 km of the crust. The Sr isotope variation suggests that the crustal component affected the magmas during ascent through the lithosphere to the surface. Our new geochemical assessment based on chemical, isotopic and fluid inclusion data points {{to the existence of}} three main levels of magma storage. Two of the levels are deep and may represent long-lived reservoirs, and an uppermost crustal level that probably coincides with the volcanic conduit. The deeper level of magma storage is deeper than 12 km and fed the 1944 AD eruption. The intermediate level coincides with the seismic discontinuity detected by Zollo et al. (1996) at about 8 km. This intermediate level supplies magmas with 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values between 0. 7071 and 0. 7074, and δO 18 8 ‰ that typically erupted both during interplinian (i. e. 1906 AD) and sub-plinian (472 AD, 1631 AD) events. The shallowest level of magma storage at about 5 km was the site of magma chambers for the Pompei and Avellino eruptions.

40|$|As a Physical Education (PE) {{teacher in}} both special and {{mainstream}} schools over a 15 year period, I witnessed {{the use of}} the teaching assistant (or Learning Support Assistant as they were known) for purposes which might be deemed to be related to a medical/welfare/care-giver role. In addition, previous small-scale research into the experiences of secondary-age disabled pupils in mainstream as opposed to special school PE showed that their experiences in an inclusive setting were restricted and that the presence of a TA did little to rectify this situation (Farr, 2005). Recently, the professionalisation {{of the role of the}} TA may have created a ‘teacher-in-waiting’ (Neill, 2002) and thus the nature of the TA’s role in PE, and the ability of the specialist teacher to work collaboratively with them is complex. This mixed methods study, inspired by critical ethnography (Thomas, 1993, 2003) incorporated five techniques of enquiry initially based on the work of Giangreco and Broer (2005). In keeping with a constructionist paradigm and integrating what I have termed a distorical theoretical perspective, I counted the interaction between people and the social structure in which they operated as important (Crotty, 1998, Broido, 2002) and drew on dominant participant voices (Lincoln and Guba, 2003). Adopting a theoretical perspective grounded in disability studies, I explored the perceptions of the role of the TA in inclusive PE through qualitative and quantitative data and presented a role definition which combines the humanistic with the instructional (or professional) after Reiter, 2000. I argued whether responsibility for the child’s learning should be devolved through the <b>TA.</b> <b>Do</b> we use the TA to make the teacher’s life easier or to support, collaboratively, the inclusion of the disabled pupil? The impact of this study on professional practice relates to the clarity of role definition for TAs generally and for TAs specifically who work in PE; the collaborative nature (or otherwise) of the TA/teacher relationship and the implications of these findings for the future training and deployment of teaching assistants in PE with a physically disabled pupil in a mainstream secondary school. This study found that TAs in PE share many traits or characteristics with those TAs working in other subject disciplines, or across subjects. However, in PE they were inclined to rate a willingness and ability to ‘join in’ and participate in practical activities alongside pupils above pedagogical knowledge. Training either reinforces an instructional or coaching role, or it focuses on the caring or medical aspects. The reality for the TA in this study however, is that they neither define themselves as one or the other but see themselves as drawing on their own skills, empathy and initiative to facilitate a positive, inclusive environment, with or without the input of the PE teacher. They deem themselves to be both care-givers where appropriate as well as supporters of autonomous participation (as opposed to learning). That the professionalization of their role moves them towards the pedagogical places the TA between a rock and a hard place...|$|E
40|$|O propósito deste estudo foi avaliar a influência dos cimentos endodônticos na resistência de união (RU) de pinos de fibra de vidro à dentina radicular, utilizando dois sistemas de cimentação, dois períodos de armazenamento e as diferentes regiões radiculares. Foram utilizados 56 dentes humanos, caninos hígidos, seccionados transversalmente imediatamente após a junção cemento-esmalte. Em seguida, as raízes foram divididas em dois grupos (n= 28) de acordo com o cimento endodôntico (com ou sem eugenol [Endofill e Sealer 26, respectivamente]). Posteriormente, as raízes foram subdivididas em dois subgrupos cada (n= 14) de acordo com o período de armazenamento antes da cimentação adesiva, sendo 7 e 180 dias. Cada subgrupo foi novamente subdividido de acordo com o cimento resinoso a ser utilizado sendo um cimento resinoso convencional dual (Variolink II) e sistema adesivo dual (Excite DSC), e outro cimento resinoso dual auto condicionante e auto adesivo (RelyX U 100). Os pinos de fibra de vidro (White Post DC) foram cimentados de acordo com as instruções do fabricante de cada sistema de cimentação. Todas as raízes foram armazenadas por uma semana após a cimentação adesiva, e posteriormente seccionadas transversalmente em seis discos de aproximadamente 1 mm de espessura cada, e os terços coronário (TC), médio (TM) e apical (<b>TA)</b> <b>do</b> canal radicular foram identificados. O teste de {{push-out}} foi realizado a uma velocidade de 0, 5 mm/min. Os dados obtidos foram analisados estatisticamente por meio do teste ANOVA fatorial e pós teste de Tukey (p= 0, 05). A análise de variância demonstrou um efeito estatisticamente significante para os fatores tempo (F= 6, 58; p= 0, 01) e terço radicular (F= 26, 67; p= 0, 0005). Os espécimes que receberam pino intra-canal após 6 meses do tratamento endodôntico apresentaram maior RU do que os espécimes tratados após 7 dias do tratamento endodôntico. O TA demonstrou valores de RU estatisticamente inferiores às dos TC e TM. Pode-se concluir que a resistência de união dos pinos de fibra à dentina radicular não foi afetada pelos cimentos endodônticos e sistemas de cimentação. The {{purpose of}} this study was to evaluate the influence of root canal sealers on the bond strength (BS) of glass fiber posts to root dentin using two cementation systems, two storage periods and the different root regions. It was used 56 human teeth,healthy canines, transversely sectioned immediately after the cement-enamel junction. Then the roots were divided into two groups (n = 28) according to the sealer (with or without eugenol [Endofill and Sealer 26, respectively]). Subsequently, the roots were subdivided into two subgroups each (n = 14) according to the period of storage before the adhesive cementation, 7 and 180 days. Each subgroup was further again subdivided according to the resin cement to be used, being a conventional dual resin cement (Variolink II) and a dual adhesive system (Excite DSC), and the other a dual resin cement autoconditioning and self-adhesive (RelyX U 100). The glass fiber posts (White Post DC) were cemented according to manufacturer's instructions for each cementation system. All roots were stored for one week after adhesive cementation, and were subsequently sectioned transversely into six discs about 1 mm thick each, and the coronal (CT), middle (MT) and apical (AT) thirds of the root canal identified. The push-out test was carried out at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 mm/min. The data were statistically analyzed by ANOVA factorial and post-hoc Tukey`s test (p= 0. 05). The analysis of variance showed a statistically significant effect for the factors time (F= 6. 58, p= 0. 01) and root third (F= 26. 67, p= 0. 0005). The specimens that received intra-canal posts 6 months after the endodontic treatment had higher BS than the specimens treated 7 days after endodontic treatment. The AT showed statistically lower BS than those of CT and MT. It can be concluded that the bond strength of fiber posts to root dentin was not affected by the root canal sealers and cementation systems...|$|E

O aprendizado e memória espacial foram avaliados 10 T. i. denigratus (250 ± 34 g), 18 T. yonenagae (125 ± 7, 8 g) e seis Clyomys bishopi (338 ± 34 g), a partir do: tempo até a saída do labirinto (TFL) e o número de erros cometidos (NER), em indivíduos colocados em labirinto de seis caminhos cegos e uma saída (0, 20 x 1, 10 x 1, 50 m), durante cinco testes consecutivos (30 min) por dia, durante três dias consecutivos (fase de aprendizagem). Os ratos foram novamente testados em única sessão realizada após 48, 120 e 504 h (fase de memória). O desempenho foi testado ao longo dos testes utilizando uma ANOVA um-fator (p< 0, 05). As taxas de aprendizagem (<b>TA)</b> <b>do</b> TFL das duas espécies foram mensuradas a partir do b da equação da curva de aprendizagem, e comparadas usando-se ANOVA um-fator (p< 0, 05). As variáveis do último teste de cada dia com os do primeiro teste do dia seguinte foram usadas como indicativas de memória-de-médio-prazo (MMP) e comparadas por espécie (teste T, dados-pareados, p< 0, 05). As taxas de retenção da aprendizagem (TR) com relação aos intervalos dos testes de memória, foram usadas como índice de memória-de-longo-prazo (MLP) e foram comparadas pela ANOVA um-fator (p< 0, 05). As espécies não apresentaram diferença significativa entre si mas não entre os testes tanto para TFL (F= 0, 85; p = 0, 705; F= 8, 86; P < 0, 000) quanto para NER (F= 0, 56; p= 0, 979; F = 3, 65; p = 0, 000). A TA foi marginalmente significativa (F = 2, 784; p = 0, 077) entre as espécies, sendo que T. yonenagae e C. bishopi não apresentaram diferença entre eles e ambos diferiram do T. i. denigratus. Com relação à memória-de-médio-prazo, T. Yonenagae e T. i. denigratus apresentaram diferença significativa para TFL entre os testes 10 - 11 (t = - 3, 406; p = 0, 003) (t=- 2, 300; p= 0, 050), mas não entre os testes 5 - 6 (t=- 0, 779; p= 0, 447) (t = - 1, 061; p= 0, 320). Já o C. bishopi sofreu redução entre os testes 5 - 6 e os testes 10 - 11, mas sem diferença significativa. Para a variável NER, não foi detectada diferença significativa, tanto para T. yonenagae (entre os 5 testes 5 e 6 : t = 314, 000, P = 0, 558; testes 10 e 11 : t= 325, 000, P= 0, 812) quanto para T. i. denigratus (entre os testes 5 - 6, t= 0, 590, P= 0, 562; testes 10 - 11 : t=- 1, 855 P= 0, 080), por outro lado, C. bishopi apresentou a tendência de redução dos valores de NER entre os testes 5 - 6 (t = 0, 442; p = 0, 676) e 10 - 11 (t = 3, 558; p = 0, 016) sendo esta significativa. Quanto à MLP, dentre cada espécie não houve diferença significativa. Assim o semi-fossorial T. yonenagae e o fossorial C. bishopi se destacam quanto a aprendizagem do que a terrestre T. idenigratus, entretanto apenas C. bishopi é mais eficiente com relação a memoria-de-médio-prazo.

We compared the spatial learning and memory in complex maze of Trinomys iheringi denigratus (terrestrial Atlantic rainforest), T. yonenagae (semifossorial Dunes of Caatinga) and Clyomys bishopi (fossorial of Cerrado). The spatial learning and memory were assessed 10 T. i. denigratus (250 ± 34 g), 18 T. yonenagae (125 ± 7. 8 g) and six Clyomys bishopi (338 ± 34 g), from: time to exit the maze (TFL) {{and the number of}} errors (NER) in individuals placed on the complex maze of paths six blind and an outlet (0, 20 x 1, 10 x 1, 50 m) for five consecutive tests (30 min) per day for three consecutive days (learning phase). The rats were tested in one session held after 48, 120 and 504 Hours (memory phase). The performance was analyzed over the tests using a one-way ANOVA (p < 0. 05). Learning rates (TA) of the TFL of both species were measured from the b of the equation of the learning curve, and compared using one-way ANOVA (p <. 05). The variables for each of the last test day with the first test the following day were used as indicators of memory to medium-term (MMP) and compared by species (t-test, paired-data, p < 0. 05). Retention rates of learning (TR) with respect to the intervals of memory tests, were used as an index of memory-to-long-term (MLP) and were compared by one-way ANOVA (p < 0. 05). The species did not differ significantly from each other but not between tests for both TFL (F = 0. 85, p = 0. 705 F = 8. 86, P < 0. 000) and for NER (F = 0. 56, p = 0. 979, F = 3. 65, p = 0. 000). The TA was marginally significant (F = 2. 784, p = 0. 077) between species, and T. yonenagae and C. bishopi showed no difference between them and both were different from T. i. denigratus. With respect to memory-to-medium term, T. yonenagae and T. i. denigratus showed significant difference between the tests 11 and 10 for TFL (t = - 3. 406, p = 0. 003) (t = - 2. 300, p = 0. 050), but not between tests 5 and 6 (t = - 0. 779, p = 0. 447) (t = - 1. 061, p = 0. 320). Already C. bishopi showed decreased between tests 5 - 6 and tests 10 - 11, but without significant difference. For variable NER, no significant differences were detected for both T. yonenagae (between tests 5 and 6 : t = 314. 000, P = 0. 558, Tests 10 and 11 : t = 325, 000 P = 0. 812) and for T. i. denigratus (between tests 5. 6, t = 0. 590, P = 0. 562; Tests 10 - 11 : 7 t = - 1. 855 p = 0. 080), on the other hand C. bishopi showed a trend to decreased NER between tests 5 - 6 (t = 0. 442, p = 0. 676) and 10 - 11 (t = 3. 558, p = 0. 016) which is significant. As for MLP, among each species there was no significant difference. Thus the semi-fossorial T. yonenagae and fossorial C. bishopi stand out as the learning of the terrestrial T. i. denigratus, however only C. bishopi is more efficient with respect to memory-to-medium term, if the effect of phylogeny is controlled, we suggested that the fossoriality could comprising the part of selective regime for evolution of the spatial cognitio...|$|E
