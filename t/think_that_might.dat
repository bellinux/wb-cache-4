Ed Boon said on his Twitter account that the plan for DLC had been scrapped, which occurred because, as clarified by 1UP, Midway had filed for bankruptcy and was purchased by Warner Bros. Interactive after the suggestion of downloadable content.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rotten Tomatoes, Gosling was asked what had attracted him to the film, and whether he had read the script at the time Jackman and director Neil Marshall were attached to it. He replied: I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> be the original one I read. I read a few drafts. I read one as well where he wasn't a stunt driver at all, which was a newer draft [...] maybe that's the one Hugh Jackman had; I'm not sure exactly. Basically when I read it, in {{trying to figure out}} who would do something like this, the only way to make sense of this is that this is a guy that's seen too many movies, and he's started to confuse his life for a film. He's lost in the mythology of Hollywood and he's become an amalgamation of all the characters that he admires. [...] When Ryan Gosling signed on for the leading role, he was allowed to choose the director, a first in his career. A fan of his work, the actor chose the Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn. [...] "It had to be [...] There was no other choice." ...|$|E

2500|$|As an umpire, Quirk {{often is}} {{responsible}} for breaking up scuffles among players. [...] During a 1999 NFL season game between the Chicago Bears and St. Louis Rams, Quirk attempted {{to break up a}} skirmish between the Rams Jeff Robinson and the Bears Ty Hallock. [...] Quirk grabbed Robinson by the waist and tackled him to the ground. [...] Robinson was ejected by Quirk for throwing a punch at Hallock. [...] As the game was concluding, Robinson asked Quirk if he could have a photo taken together. [...] Robinson later had the photo enlarged and hung it on the wall of his den. [...] After the game, Todd Lyght commented on Quirk's tackle saying, [...] "He did that with authority, and that was an older guy, too. That wasn't one of the young umps. He put it on him. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> open up (ESPN's) Prime Time." [...] Dick Vermeil, then-coach of the Rams, later joked with Robinson, asking him, [...] "(Quirk is a) Hell of a tackler, isn't he?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Just to {{complete}} this impression let me repeat a pleasant story about this king and our Prince of Wales, who recently visited the Italian front. The Prince {{is a source of}} anxiety on these visits; he has a very strong and very creditable desire to share the ordinary risks of war. He is keenly interested, and unobtrusively bent upon getting as near the fighting as line as possible. But the King of Italy was firm upon keeping him out of anything more than the most incidental danger. [...] "We don't want any historical incidents here," [...] he said. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> well become an historical phrase. For the life of the Effigy is a series of historical incidents.|$|E

I do nor {{know the names of}} the hotels on shore, so you must watch me when I land and see where I put up. Come there in the evening at nine o'clock. I will issue out and give you the bundle of clothes, and tell you at what hour in the morning I have arranged to start. I will hire two horses; when they come round to the door, join me in front of the hotel and busy yourself in packing my trunks on the baggage mules. When you have done that, mount the second horse and ride after me; the people who will go with us with the horses will naturally suppose that you have landed with me. Should any of our shipmates here see us start, it is not likely that they will recognize you. If they do so, I need simply say that as you had shown me such kindness on board ship I had resolved to take you with me to Madrid in order to see if anything could be done to restore you to reason. However, it is better that you should keep in the background as much as possible. I will arrange to start at so early an hour in the morning that none of those who may land with me from the ship, and may put up at the same inn, are likely to be about." ...|$|E

50|$|I was {{beginning}} to feel that there would never be another American uprising, that the energy was gone, and I have some reasons to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>might</b> be true. I {{like to point out that}} the crime rate in America has been declining for a long time, and in my opinion it’s because Americans don’t even have enough gumption to commit crimes anymore: the creative aspect of crime has fallen into decay. As for the uprising that takes a principled stand against violence, hats off to them, I admire the idealism, but I don’t think it’s going to accomplish much.|$|E
