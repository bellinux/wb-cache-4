2500|$|Linguist George Lakoff {{argued that}} the [...] "ad has raised vital {{questions}} that need a thorough and open discussion. The ad worked brilliantly to reveal, via its framing, an essential but previously hidden truth: the Bush Administration and its active supporters have betrayed {{the trust of the}} troops and the American people." [...] Liberal blogger Arianna Huffington argued that [...] "Was the MoveOn ad blunt? Yes. Did it go for the ? No doubt. But while the way it chose to make its points can be debated, the accuracy of those points cannot." [...] Anti-war activist and Congressional candidate Cindy Sheehan stated that [...] "I have often been critical of MoveOn.org, basically because I feel, for the most part that they support Democrats to the detriment of democracy... The occupation of Iraq is a disaster and I applaud MoveOn for moving a little closer to the true 'anti-war' movement and encourage them <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> farther." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{the time}} came to groom a {{successor}} for the king, {{there seemed to be no}} suitable heir. Soldiers were dispatched to the village to find the illegitimate children. After their arrival, they overheard a peasant woman call to her son named Wamba, who was tending cattle with a stick. The soldiers knew they had come upon the youth they sought and declared: [...] "You are the rightful king and we must ask you <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> to the palace." [...] Wamba was unwilling, or at least pretended to be. He took his stick and thrust it into the ground, saying, [...] "I will only accept the throne if this stick takes root." [...] The stick he carried, was of chopo or black poplar, which easily takes root in fertile soil. When it began to grow, Wamba agreed to go with the soldiers to become the new king of the Visigoths, being elected and crowned in what is today the tiny village of Wamba in the region around Madrid.|$|E
