5|$|In 1901, {{the course}} of study at City College went {{through a series of}} further changes. The most {{significant}} was the reduction of the five-year course of study to four years; though students who entered prior to 1900 were allowed to complete the five-year course. The new course, like the course it replaced, allowed graduates to be admitted to Johns Hopkins University without examination, and provided students with greater flexibility. Instead of requiring students to complete the same set of courses, it allowed students to choose <b>their</b> <b>courses,</b> as long as they completed 150 credits.|$|E
5|$|The band {{managed to}} persuade fellow student Caleb Bradley to manage them, {{and by the}} start of 1968, the band had managed to record a demo tape {{influenced}} by blues and jazz, sending it to Lou Reizner, then the U.K. head of Mercury Records, who offered the trio of Hammill, Smith, and Pearne a recording contract in May. At this point, the band {{had to make a decision}} whether to stay on at university, or quit <b>their</b> <b>courses</b> and move to London to turn professional. Pearne was not keen to abandon his studies, so decided to leave the group.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{potential}} for tropical cyclone development, Météo-France declared yellow cyclone alerts for Guadeloupe and Martinique, warning of imminent squally weather. Due {{to the presence of}} Emily, a state of emergency was declared for all of Puerto Rico. Officials ordered the preparation of over 400 storm shelters and ensured adequate water supply. The morning before the storm, government workers were dismissed, and national courtrooms remained closed. The United States Coast Guard issued a statement urging residents of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to avoid recreational boating and swimming until Emily had passed. JetBlue Airways waived fees for flights into the Dominican Republic because of the inclement weather conditions. Four cruise ships, Oasis of the Seas, Freedom of the Seas, Carnival Dream and Carnival Liberty altered <b>their</b> <b>courses</b> through the Caribbean to avoid the storm.|$|E

5|$|Georgetown University offers {{undergraduate}} {{degrees in}} forty-eight majors {{in the four}} undergraduate schools, {{as well as the}} opportunity for students to design <b>their</b> <b>courses</b> of study. All majors in the College are open as minors to students in the College, the School of Nursing and Health Studies, and the School of Business. Students in the School of Foreign Service can complete select certificates which complement the school's focus on foreign affairs and attain a minor in one of twelve languages but {{do not have access to}} the same minor selection as the other three schools. All courses are on a credit hour system. Georgetown offers many opportunities to study abroad, and about 50% of the undergraduate student body spends time at an institution overseas.|$|E
5|$|On August22, governments {{across the}} Lesser Antilles issued {{tropical}} storm watches. The islands of Antigua, Anguilla, Barbuda, Montserrat, Nevis, Saba, St. Eustatius, and St. Kitts were placed under {{a tropical storm}} warning the following day. These advisories were discontinued following Danny's degradation to a tropical depression on August24. Leeward Islands Air Transport cancelled 40flights across the eastern Caribbean due to the hurricane and cruise ships altered <b>their</b> <b>courses.</b> Although members of the Haiti Office of Civil Protection issued an official statement to residents saying Danny was {{not a threat to}} the country, they convened to discuss potential preparations and the status of emergency supplies. Officials in the United States Virgin Islands distributed sandbags and opened shelters.|$|E
5|$|Three cruise ships, Carnival Pride, Carnival Destiny, and Grandeur of the Seas had {{to alter}} <b>their</b> <b>courses</b> {{due to the}} {{presence}} of Bonnie. Due to the threat of a tropical storm, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal {{declared a state of emergency}} on July22. Along the Gulf Coast, concerns arose regarding the potential effects of the storm on the BP oil spill earlier in the year. Due to risk of intoxicated storm surge, authorities prepared for possible evacuations of low-lying areas along coastlines. On July23, Admiral Thad Allen ordered the oil spill site to be evacuated, as Bonnie posed a safety threat to nearly 2,000 people in that area. The ships and vessels in the area began preparation for evacuation on July24. Closer to shore, approximately 1,300 fishing boats laying boom had to evacuate.|$|E

5|$|To the south, the White Salmon River has {{its source}} {{on the lower}} flanks of {{the west side of}} Adams and gains {{additional}} flows from streams along the southwest side of the mountain. Streams on the east side all flow to the Klickitat River. Streams on all sides, at some point in <b>their</b> <b>courses,</b> provide essential irrigation water for farming and ranching. The Klickitat and White Salmon rivers are nearly completely free flowing, with only small barriers to aid irrigation (White Salmon) and erosion control (Klickitat). The Cispus and Lewis rivers have been impounded with dams farther downstream for flood control and power generation purposes.|$|E
5|$|In Baxter's eyes, {{the main}} {{role of the}} {{university}} was to provide trained engineers and technologists for industry, which he believed was suffering from a critical skill shortage. With this constantly in mind, he pursued a rapid expansion of the university. Student numbers grew from 3,751 when he became vice-chancellor in 1955, to over 15,988 when he retired in 1969. This was {{far short of the}} university of 25,000 students that he had hoped to create, but in the 1950s the idea of a university that large horrified some academics. Baxter considered it wasteful when good students returned to academia after only a brief time working in industry, but even more so when they dropped out or failed <b>their</b> <b>courses.</b> While his critics saw high failure rates as the inevitable result of lowering admission standards in order to boost student numbers, Baxter viewed it as result of poor teaching and inefficient administration. He walked out of a heated Staff Association meeting on the matter. To help industry, he established Unisearch Limited, a company that provided expert assistance in 1959.|$|E
5|$|While Deloraine {{attended}} to the torpedoed ships, {{the other four}} escorts attempted to locate the Japanese submarine. I-174 had not been detected approaching the convoy, and after the attack the Australian corvettes reversed <b>their</b> <b>courses</b> to conduct a sonar sweep of the area from where she was presumed to have attacked. This was in accordance with tactics that had recently been adopted by the RAN after they proved successful in the Battle of the Atlantic. Warrnambool detected the submarine 23 minutes after the attack, and she and Kalgoorlie subjected I-174 to four depth charge attacks over two hours until contact was lost. An Anson from No. 71 Squadron was escorting the convoy {{at the time the}} two ships were torpedoed but was low on fuel and returned to base shortly after the attack. While the corvettes believed that they had sunk I-174, she was only lightly damaged and withdrew to the east. The Australian failure to sink the submarine was {{due to a lack of}} practice and too few ships being available to create an adequate search scheme.|$|E

50|$|One {{issue to}} {{consider}} {{is the fact that}} not all AP students take <b>their</b> <b>course's</b> test.
