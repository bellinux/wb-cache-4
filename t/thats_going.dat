5000|$|The Gators played another tight {{game for}} the second {{straight}} year, holding a mere 7-3 lead through the first quarter. The Gators scored another touchdown in the second quarter to extend their lead to a comfortable 14-3. Florida could not score {{for the remainder of the}} game, however their defense was able to hold Kentuckys potent offense led by Patrick Towles, one of the SECs top returning quarterbacks, to only two additional field goals, and intercepted a desperation pass on 4th & 27 to secure the result and kneel off the remaining time. Starting quarterback Will Grier played for the entire game, and was the teams top rusher with 61 yards. Treon Harris did warm up on the sideline when Griers offense seemed to dwindle, but Jim McElwain asked if Grier could continue, which he affirmed. McElwain called his first SEC victory a [...] "heck of a road win against a team <b>thats</b> <b>going</b> to win a lot of games in this league and is getting better and better." ...|$|E

[...] "I was going to the theater and I just turned the radio on in the car and the man said, Heres a record <b>thats</b> <b>going</b> nationwide: Hound Dog by Willie Mae Thornton.

They were just playing Hound Dog all over the theater. So I goes up in the operating room, I say, Do you mind playing that again? Cause I hadnt heard the record in so long I forgot the words myself. So I stood there while he was playing it, listening to it. So that evening I sang it on the show, and everybody went for it. Hound Dog just took off like a jet." ...|$|E
5000|$|On October 25, 2013, it was {{announced}} CBS, which owns Spelling Televisions properties, was developing a reboot of Charmed. Kate Ward of Bustle connected CBSs decision to revisit the supernatural drama with Cuocos success as [...] "one of the networks most bankable stars" [...] for her role on the sitcom The Big Bang Theory. On August 12, 2014, TVLines Michael Ausiello announced CBS would not proceed with the reboot. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Milano alluded {{to the possibility of}} a Charmed reunion and said; [...] "It seems like <b>thats</b> <b>going</b> to happen any second". Glenn Garner of Out magazine said Cuocos character should be excluded from the possible reunion. Bustles Sabienna Bowman wrote the reunion should address Billies fate following the series finale, arguing the characters future should be [...] "more interesting than babysitting for the Halliwell brood". While Shannon Doherty and McGowan publicly supported the idea of a reunion, Dan Avery of NewNowNext.com wondered whether Cuoco had been asked to revisit her role as Billie. On March 5, 2016, Milano said there were no concrete plans for a reunion in development, but confirmed CBS was {{still in the process of}} producing a reboot without the original cast.|$|E
5000|$|To {{signify the}} {{characters}} 8 years living in America, Johnson {{was required to}} use an American accent while playing Vicki. She was given a voice coach and a sheet of American phrases to practice weekly. She commented, [...] "It is hard work, but its becoming second nature now. As soon as I know that Im Vicki, the accent just comes with it." [...] After 6 months in the role, Vicki dropped the American accent. Johnson explained {{the reason for the}} change in 2004: [...] "The producers knew that I had to have an American accent when I came into the show because my character had been living in America but its not the kind of accent that youd want to have for a long time on a show like EastEnders. Its not something <b>thats</b> <b>going</b> to fit in {{for a long period of}} time. What would have been perfect would have been to have it gradually fade out, but as you film 8 episodes at a time, this would be nigh on impossible. The decision was made that in the story Vicki was coming to terms with the fact that she wanted to live in London so therefore she was going to make a conscious effort to fit in with everyone around her and blend in with London life." ...|$|E

5000|$|Matt Casamassina of IGN {{praised the}} {{graphics}} of the Nintendo 64 version, writing that Stormfront Studios had [...] "successfully translated {{the look of}} Hot Wheels plastic tracks {{into the world of}} polygons. Hot Wheels Turbo Racing features roads that glow bright red, stripe yellow and orange, green, blue -- everything but black, really. While these tracks are most definitely reminiscent of the toy courses they were inspired by, as a game we must admit that they still come off looking overly tacky and far too bright in appearance. ... Because background graphics are of a much more realistic tone, the end effect is certainly unique, if not confusing. We end up with rainbow roads stretching through realistic environments. A bit odd to be sure, but it works. Vehicles, meanwhile, which are [...] the classic Hot Wheels collection, come to life with solid polygon models and detailed textures. The colorful environments themselves, it must be said, are not overly detailed." [...] Casamassina noted that the game had a [...] "very polygon look," [...] giving background objects and roads a [...] "blocky appearance". Casamassina felt that the game looked outdated in comparison to other racing games of that time, and wrote that he preferred [...] "the wide-open, go-anywhere racing environments and heavy car physics of the Rush series to Hot Wheels seemingly weightless cars and sometimes confined 3D tracks. With that said, the title comes recommended as a good racer <b>thats</b> <b>going</b> to appeal to stunt-lovers and not simulation junkies." ...|$|E
5000|$|Following [...] "The Puppy Episode", Ellen was renewed {{for another}} season. ABC prefaced each episode of season five with a parental {{advisory}} warning. DeGeneres strongly criticized ABC for including the warnings, saying {{in an interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, [...] "It was like this voice like youre entering some kind of radiation center. It was very offensive, and you dont think <b>thats</b> <b>going</b> to affect ratings?" [...] DeGeneres further noted demonstrable hypocrisy on the part of ABC, citing episodes of ABC series The Drew Carey Show and Spin City which included two men kissing (the Carey episode was even promoted using the kiss). [...] "Theres no disclaimer on Carey show at all, because its two heterosexual men, and theyre making fun of heterosexuality...City aired without a disclaimer because neither (Michael J. Fox nor Michael Boatman) is really gay in real life." [...] Episodes after [...] "The Puppy Episode" [...] dealt with Ellens coming out to her parents and boss, quitting her job at the bookstore and finding a series of new jobs. Other episodes dealt with her search for a romantic partner and learning more about the LGBT community. Even some gay people began criticizing the amount of gay content in the series, including Chaz Bono, formerly known as Chastity Bono, who was at the time working for GLAAD. Bono was quoted as saying, [...] "Ellen is so gay its excluding a large part of our society. A lot of the stuff on it is somewhat of an inside joke. Its one thing to have a gay lead character, but its another when every episode deals with specific gay issues." [...] Bono would later say that the comments were taken out of context. Ellen was canceled after its fifth season.|$|E
