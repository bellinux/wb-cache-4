5|$|Luftwaffe {{reconnaissance}} units plotted Soviet troop concentration, supply dumps and airfields, {{and marked}} them down for destruction. Additional Luftwaffe attacks {{were carried out}} against Soviet command and control centers in order to disrupt the mobilization and organization of Soviet forces. In contrast, Soviet artillery observers based at the border area had been under the strictest instructions not to open fire on German aircraft prior to the invasion. One plausible reason given for the Soviet hesitation to return fire was Stalin's initial belief that the assault was launched without Hitler's authorization. Significant amounts of Soviet territory were lost along with Red Army forces as a result; it took several days before Stalin comprehended {{the magnitude of the}} calamity. The Luftwaffe reportedly destroyed 1,489 aircraft on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> of the invasion and over 3,100 during the first three days. Hermann Göring, Minister of Aviation and Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe, distrusted the reports and ordered the figure checked. Luftwaffe staffs surveyed the wreckage on Soviet airfields, and their original figure proved conservative, as over 2,000 Soviet aircraft were estimated to have been destroyed on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> of the invasion. In reality, Soviet losses were likely higher; a Soviet archival document recorded the loss of 3,922 Soviet aircraft in the first three days against an estimated loss of 78 German aircraft. The Luftwaffe reported the loss of only 35 aircraft on <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day</b> of combat. A document from the German Federal Archives puts the Luftwaffe's loss at 63 aircraft for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>day.</b>|$|E
