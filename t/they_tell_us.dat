They had the information... You concealed the facts, {{that is what you}} did.|$|E
25|$|Siporin (1990) {{uses the}} family {{folklore}} of ethnic Jews to their collective history and its transformation into an historical art form. <b>They</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> how Jews have survived being uprooted and transformed. Many immigrant narratives bear {{a theme of}} the arbitrary nature of fate and the reduced state of immigrants in a new culture. By contrast, ethnic family narratives tend to show the ethnic more in charge of his life, and perhaps {{in danger of losing}} his Jewishness altogether. Some stories show how a family member successfully negotiated the conflict between ethnic and American identities.|$|E
500|$|A second blast {{rocks the}} Lusitania, which sinks {{slowly into the}} deep as more {{passengers}} fall off its edges, and the ship submerges amid scenes of drowning bodies. [...] The liner vanishes from sight, and the film closes with a mother struggling to keep her baby above the waves. [...] An intertitle declares: [...] "The man who fired the shot was decorated for it by the Kaiser! [...] And yet <b>they</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> not to hate the Hun." ...|$|E

500|$|Henkes and Bindervoet {{generally}} summarise {{the critical}} consensus when they argue that, between the thematically indicative {{opening and closing}} chapters, the book concerns [...] "two big questions" [...] which are never resolved: {{what is the nature}} of protagonist HCE’s secret sin, and what was the letter, written by his wife ALP, about? HCE's unidentifiable sin has most generally been interpreted as representing man's original sin as a result of the Fall of Man. Anthony Burgess sees HCE, through his dream, trying [...] "to make the whole of history swallow up his guilt for him" [...] and to this end [...] "HCE has, so deep in his sleep, sunk to a level of dreaming in which he has become a collective being rehearsing the collective guilt of man." [...] Fargnoli and Gillespie argue that although undefined, [...] "Earwicker's alleged crime in the Park" [...] appears to have been of a [...] "voyeuristic, sexual, or scatological nature". [...] ALP's letter appears a number of times throughout the book, in a number of different forms, and as its contents cannot be definitively delineated, it is usually believed to be both an exoneration of HCE, and an indictment of his sin. Herring argues that [...] "he effect of ALP's letter is precisely the opposite of her intent [...] the more ALP defends her husband in her letter, the more scandal attaches to him." [...] Patrick A. McCarthy argues that [...] "it is appropriate that the waters of the Liffey, representing Anna Livia, are washing away the evidence of Earwicker's sins as [...] for (<b>they</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us)</b> she takes on her husband's guilt and redeems him; alternately she is tainted with his crimes and regarded as an accomplice".|$|E
2500|$|In their 1974 paper, Clauser and Horne {{show that}} the CHSH {{inequality}} {{can be derived from}} the CH74 one. [...] As <b>they</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us,</b> in a two-channel experiment the CH74 single-channel test is still applicable and provides four sets of inequalities governing the probabilities p of coincidences.|$|E

50|$|Analytic {{observations}} give us new knowledge, {{because they}} reveal unsuspected implications of our statements and beliefs. But analytic observations {{do not give}} us new knowledge of matters of fact, because <b>they</b> only <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> what is already known.|$|R
500|$|The {{simplest}} {{definition is}} [...] "the study of ancient life".

2500|$|A 2006 article {{reported}} {{incidents of}} violence, disputes and discrimination against Dalits in Maharashtra. The article noted that non-Dalit families claimed {{they do not}} treat Dalits differently.

2500|$|The backstory {{of one of}} the {{surviving}} epistles, directed to Constantine I, recounts how the fame of Saint Anthony spread abroad and reached Emperor Constantine. The Emperor wrote to him offering praise and requesting prayers. The brethren were pleased with the Emperor's letter, but Anthony did not pay any attention to it, and he said to them, [...] "The books of God, the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords, commands us every day, but we do not heed what <b>they</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us,</b> and we turn our backs on them." [...] Under the persistence of the brethren who told him [...] "Emperor Constantine loves the church", he accepted to write him a letter blessing him, and praying for the peace and safety of the empire and the church.|$|E

50|$|All these texts, variably dated c. second-sixteenth century AD, <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> about a {{prevailing}} convention for {{the classification}} of divine images - based on the materials used in making them. <b>They</b> also <b>tell</b> <b>us,</b> categorically, how each and every such classification has referred to wood {{as one of the}} most suitable medium for this purpose.|$|R
2500|$|Next, The Chairman {{is called}} in to play another {{character}} as that actor is unable to come, {{but it turned out}} that the scenes of his character and the scenes of Mayor Sapsea coincide- and the characters have to disagree with each other. This results in major confusion for poor Mayor Sapsea/The Chairman, and laughs for the audience. He and Jasper sing of their conflicting minds- Jasper, of course, meaning it literally- in the patter song [...] "Both Sides Of The Coin". We are then introduced to the drunken stonemason Durdles, and his assistant Deputy. In the graveyard, <b>they</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> that Edwin and Rosa, who have been promised to each other since they were children and so cannot tell if they truly love each other, have called off their engagement ("Perfect Strangers"). As a parting gift, Rosa gives Drood her hair clasp, which once belonged to her mother.|$|E
60|$|Now, {{people do}} not often {{understand}} clearly why this is. They feel, more or less, that so it is; but they cannot explain it. I could tell you why they cannot; but I will not take up your time. But if they cannot explain it, {{there are those who}} can. St. Paul explains it in the Epistle. The Lord Jesus Himself explains it in the Gospel. <b>They</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> why money will not make a gentleman. <b>They</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> why poverty will not unmake one: but <b>they</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> more. <b>They</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> the one only thing which makes a true gentleman. And <b>they</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> more still. <b>They</b> <b>tell</b> <b>us</b> how every one of us, down to the poorest and most ignorant man and woman in this church, may become true gentlemen and ladies, in the sight of God and of all reasonable men; and that, not only in this life, but after death, for ever, and ever, and ever.
