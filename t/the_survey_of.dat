5|$|The Schiehallion {{experiment}} was an 18th-century experiment {{to determine the}} mean density of the Earth. Funded {{by a grant from}} the Royal Society, it was conducted in the summer of 1774 around the Scottish mountain of Schiehallion, Perthshire. The experiment involved measuring the tiny deflection of a pendulum due to the gravitational attraction of a nearby mountain. Schiehallion was considered the ideal location after a search for candidate mountains, thanks to its isolation and almost symmetrical shape. One of the triggers for the experiment were anomalies noted during <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> <b>of</b> the Mason–Dixon Line.|$|E

Starting on January 15, 1788 and running until March 12, 1788, Jones surveyed Barton Township. From April 1, 1788April 24, 1788 Jones surveyed Clinton Township.

5|$|As {{a sitting}} president, Reagan {{did not have}} the highest {{approval}} ratings, but his popularity has increased since 1989. Gallup polls in 2001 and 2007 ranked him number one or number two when correspondents were asked for the greatest president in history. Reagan ranked third of post–World War II presidents in a 2007 Rasmussen Reports poll, fifth in an ABC 2000 poll, ninth in another 2007 Rasmussen poll, and eighth in a late 2008 poll by British newspaper The Times. In a Siena College survey of over 200 historians, however, Reagan ranked sixteenth out of 42.

5|$|In 1791 and 1792, Jones {{surveyed}} the lakeshore of townships east from York, Upper Canada, to the Trent River, from the lakeshore to {{a distance of}} one mile (1.6km) from Lake Ontario. Jones and his team had set out from Scarborough to the eastern boundary of the Nassau District, the approximate area of {{the mouth of the}} Trent River. From there, they began surveying townships along Lake Ontario travelling westwards. They surveyed in turn Murray Township, then Cramahe Township, Haldimand Township, Hamilton Township, Hope Township, Clarke Township, Darlington Township, Pickering Township, Glasgow Township, York Township and Etobicoke Township. Sideroads were then run north to the first concession road. Clarke township had previously been unnamed, Jones was the one to name it. <b>The</b> <b>survey</b> <b>of</b> the west end of the Nassau district finalised the boundary of the Toronto Purchase, which had been agreed upon in principle, but could not be completed because the land areas involved were not well known.

5|$|The parkway {{was to be}} {{built as}} a two-lane {{alternative}} to Route31 defining {{the border of the}} suburban and rural portions of Flemington Borough and Raritan Township. Along with the new parkway, a brand-new local street network was proposed to help support the new alignment. These would minimize the pressure of traffic on Route31 and include better roads for bicycles and pedestrians. More direct routes to different portions of the community would be provided to maintain the community's character. The proposed parkway was to also help upgrade the sensitive history along the South Branch River. According to the 2008 highway plans, the South Branch Parkway would cost the state more than $2.2 million (2008 USD) in funds to put together <b>the</b> <b>survey</b> <b>of</b> lands in the proposed alignment.

5|$|Stratton wrote Experimental Psychology and its Bearing upon Culture {{to explain}} both typical {{psychological}} experiment methodology {{and how the}} results obtained answered philosophical problems. The book covered experimental results in psychology and how they influenced overall social behavior and the everyday cultural life of people. It did so {{by looking at the}} history of experimental psychology, and then surveying experimental methods covering both their applications and limits. Stratton pointed out how psychological experiments differed from the ones in physiology. <b>The</b> <b>survey</b> <b>of</b> experiments also included studies on mental perception, including among the blind. Stratton noted that the blind did have a sense of space. He also described how measurements of mental phenomena were both possible and being done in practice, though he did believe the results had to be interpreted on a psychic scale different from the usual physical ones used for measures such as lengths and weights. He rejected the argument the mind was unitary and could not be studied by splitting it into parts, by drawing on the analogy of studying a tree by looking at its constituent parts, themselves not functionally trees. He presumed sensations were akin to trees in how they could be split up into parts.|$|E
