5|$|The theatre's {{capacity}} is 1,216seats on four levels. Really Useful Theatres Group purchased it in January 2000 with nine other London theatres formerly {{owned by the}} Stoll-Moss Group.

In 2014, Really Useful Theatres split-off from <b>the</b> <b>Really</b> Useful Group and owns the theatre.|$|E

25|$|His company, <b>the</b> <b>Really</b> Useful Group, {{is one of}} {{the largest}} theatre {{operators}} in London. Producers in several parts of the UK have staged productions, including national tours, of the Lloyd Webber musicals under licence from <b>the</b> <b>Really</b> Useful Group. Lloyd Webber is also the president of the Arts Educational Schools London, a performing arts school located in Chiswick, West London. He is involved in a number of charitable activities, including the Elton John AIDS Foundation, Nordoff Robbins, Prostate Cancer UK and War Child. In 1992 he set up the Andrew Lloyd Webber Foundation which supports the arts, culture and heritage in the UK.|$|E

25|$|The {{feeling of}} {{cultural}} outrage {{was much more}} important than anti-Semitism as such; or rather, it turned into anti-Semites, at any rate for the moment, people who normally never expressed such feelings.

25|$|In September 2008, Lloyd Webber {{announced}} {{that he would not be}} returning to the BBC in 2009 for another series as he wished to concentrate his efforts on his latest musical. He would, however, be returning to BBC screens in 2010 with a brand new search to find a new Dorothy for The Wizard of Oz, to which his company, <b>The</b> <b>Really</b> Useful Group, recently acquired the rights.|$|E

25|$|Clemens, your lecture was {{magnificent}}. It was eloquent, moving, sincere. Never in {{my entire}} life have I listened to such a magnificent piece of descriptive narration. But you committed one unpardonable sin– the unpardonable sin. It is a sin you must never commit again. You closed a most eloquent description, by which you had keyed your audience up to a pitch of the intensest interest, with a piece of atrocious anti-climax which nullified all <b>the</b> <b>really</b> fine effect you had produced.|$|E
25|$|Dark Horse Comics {{released}} {{a number of}} MirrorMask related merchandise in 2005. Three PVC figure sets, which included three figures per set, were released from May to June 2005. These sets included figures of characters such as Helena, Valentine, the Dark Queen, as well as figures of minor characters like the Librarian and the Small Hairy Guy. A journal {{made to look like}} <b>the</b> <b>Really</b> Useful Book, which provided aid for Helena in the film, was released in July 2005, and a seven-inch tall bust of the Dark Queen was released in August 2005.|$|E
25|$|The plays began a West End {{run at the}} Duchess Theatre on 7 September 2002, {{with the}} same cast and {{production}} team. However, the success of RolePlay over led to play's producers, <b>the</b> <b>Really</b> Useful Group, gradually {{reducing the number of}} performances of the other two plays. Finally, it was decided to stage only RolePlay during the week, with the other two staged only during the day on a Saturday as part of the whole trilogy. This caused considerable upset amongst the cast and led to a long-standing rift with the West End in general.|$|E

Materialism is really our established Church; for <b>the</b> Government will <b>really</b> help it to persecute its heretics. Vaccination, in its hundred years of experiment, has been disputed {{almost as much as}} baptism in its approximate two thousand.

25|$|Sonnino's uncompromising {{severity}} towards others {{proved to}} be an obstacle to form his own government for a long time. Nevertheless, Sonnino served twice briefly as Prime Minister. On 8 February 1906 Sonnino formed his first government, which lasted only three months; on 18 May 1906, after a mere 100 days, he was forced to resign. He proposed major changes to transform Southern Italy, which provoked opposition from the ruling groups. Land taxes were to be reduced by one-third, except for <b>the</b> <b>really</b> big landowners. He also proposed the establishment of provincial banks and to subsidize schools. His reforms provoked opposition from the ruling groups. He was succeeded by Giovanni Giolitti.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that there}} is a big {{difference}} between pool types. Indoor pools of 25 m give the advantage of being able to use the turning point to push off again using ones legs, thus giving a clear advantage over 50 m and of course open water venues. Open sea gives <b>the</b> <b>really</b> bad side effect of large waves and the tides, which will sometimes push the swimmer back to where they came from, this can be clearly seen in the differences in times between the Channel crossing and the almost double in length Maraton Acuatica Rio Coronda which she performed in two hours less.|$|E
25|$|Even such thinkers {{as opposed}} the ascetic view could not extricate {{themselves}} entirely from the meshes of Neoplatonic mysticism, which beheld {{in the flesh}} or in matter the source of evil. Thus Abraham ben Ḥiyya strongly refutes the Neoplatonic conception of evil as being identical with matter, and maintains against BaḦya that indulgence in fasting and other modes of penitence is not meritorious, since only he who is ruled by his lower desires may resort to asceticism as the means of curbing his passion and disciplining his soul, whereas <b>the</b> <b>really</b> good should confine himself to such modes of abstinence as are prescribed by the Law.|$|E

25|$|The new {{custom-built}} Imperial sedan {{was based}} on the Chrysler New Yorker. It shared the same trim, but had a canvas-covered roof and leather and broadcloth Imperial upholstery. These features were installed by Derham, on the all new postwar Chrysler sheetmetal. Early 1949 Imperial Crowns were actually leftover 1948s. <b>The</b> <b>really</b> new models didn't arrive until March, 1949. Their styling was sleeker than previous models, yet conservative. Fewer, but heavier bars were used in the cross-hatched grille. The upper and center horizontal pieces wrapped around the front fenders. Rocker panel moldings, rear fender stoneguards, full length lower window trim and horizontal chrome strips on the rear fenders, and from the headlights to about halfway across the front doors, were used to decorate the side body.|$|E
25|$|The musical, Closer to Heaven, {{opened at}} the Arts Theatre in London, in 2001, with {{financial}} backing from Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful Group. Reviews were mixed and although the run was initially extended, it closed earlier than expected, due to poor ticket sales, in October 2001. Around {{the time of the}} London closure, Tennant said that they were in talks to take the musical to various locations in Europe (particularly Germany, which is a big market for Pet Shop Boys) and to take it to New York. Nothing further was issued by the Pet Shop Boys or Really Useful Group regarding these performances; in 2005, a series of performances were staged in the Brisbane Powerhouse, Australia, though they were arranged independently of Pet Shop Boys and <b>the</b> <b>Really</b> Useful Group.|$|E
25|$|The {{series of}} assistants to the vicar, {{now known as}} vices-gerentes (vicegerent), begins with 1560. Until the time of Pope Clement XI (1700) they were named by the vicar; since then the pope has {{appointed}} them by a special Brief. The vicesgerens is therefore not a representative (locum tenens) of the vicar, but a subordinate auxiliary bishop appointed for life, though removable at any time. His authority (faculties) relative to jurisdiction and orders is identical {{with that of the}} vicar; for its exercise, however, he depends on the latter, as is expressly stated in the Brief of his nomination. In particular, the vicar has committed to him the administration of the treasury of relics known as the Lisanotheca or relic-treasury of the vicariate, the censorship of books, and the permission to print. The censorship of books was entrusted to the vicar by a Bull of 4 May 1515 (in the Magnum Bullarium); this right, however, is now exercised by the vices-gerens subject to the Magister sacri palatii, to whose imprimatur he adds his own name without further examination of the book in question. <b>The</b> <b>really</b> responsible censor is therefore the Magister sacri palati, not the vicesgerens. Occasionally there have been two assistants of the vicar, to one of whom were committed all matters of jurisdiction, to the other the pontificalia and ordinations; the latter was known as suffragan of the vicar.|$|E
