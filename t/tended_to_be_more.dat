5|$|A death {{sentence}} {{had to be}} passed unanimously, and confirmed in writing by various officers as the verdict passed up the chain of command. A man's battalion and brigade commander tended to comment on his own record, but senior generals <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> concerned {{with the type of}} offence and the state of discipline in that unit. The Judge Advocate General at GHQ also checked the records for irregularities, before final confirmation (or otherwise) by the Commander-in-Chief of the relevant theatre.|$|E

5|$|Ethnically, the Middle Colonies {{were more}} diverse {{than the other}} British colonial regions in North America and <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> {{socially}} tolerant. For example, in New York, any foreigner professing Christianity was awarded citizenship, leading to a more diverse populace. As a consequence, early German settlements in the Americas concentrated in the Middle Colonies region. Indentured servitude was especially common in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York in the eighteenth century, though fewer worked in agriculture.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the Maryland Senate lie in the {{creation}} of an assembly during {{the early days of the}} Maryland colony. This assembly first met in 1637, making it the longest continuously operating legislative body in the United States. Originally, the assembly was unicameral, but in 1650, the Governor and his appointed council began serving as the upper house of a now bicameral legislature. These appointees had close political and economic ties to the proprietors of the Maryland colony, Cecilius Calvert and his descendants. Thus, the upper house in colonial times often disagreed with the lower house, which was elected, <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> populist, and pushed for greater legislative power in the colony.|$|E
5|$|Kosovo Albanians were {{generally}} less hospitable to Jews {{than their counterparts}} in Albania. Due to their historical experiences with Serbs and the Ottoman Empire, they <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> unfriendly towards local non-Albanians. Many enthusiastically supported the Germans as a result. Claims have been made that Kosovo Albanians protected Jews after German forces took over territories that Italian authorities had controlled during the war, but the protection that Jews received in Kosovo {{in the early years of}} the war was due more to the Italian authorities than to the local Albanian population. It is estimated that 210 Jews from Kosovo perished during the war. An official Yugoslav state report published in 1964 recorded 74 Jewish wartime fatalities in the region. Approximately 600 Jews were killed in Albania, Kosovo and other Albanian-controlled territories during the war. A somewhat greater number, as well as several hundred refugees, hid and survived with the assistance of the local Albanian population.|$|E

In a 2010 study of veterinarians and rescuers in the United States, 66% of respondents had socialization programs for kittens, and 8% for adult cats.|$|E
25|$|In other {{countries}} in the Americas, where mixing among groups was overtly more extensive, social categories have <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> numerous and fluid.

25|$|As Branscombe documents, {{the earlier}} {{performances}} were often of highly altered, sometimes even mutilated, {{versions of the}} opera (see Ludwig Wenzel Lachnith). Productions {{of the past century}} have <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> faithful to Mozart's music, though faithful rendering of Mozart and Schikaneder's original (quite explicit) stage directions and dramatic vision continues to be rare; with isolated exceptions modern productions strongly reflect the creative preferences of the stage director.|$|E
25|$|Although he {{had been}} friends with Field Marshal Phibunsongkhram during {{the early days of}} the People's Party, the two fell out in the {{following}} years. Pridi was violently anti-Japanese as well as a left-leaning, and therefore opposed many of Phibun's militaristic policies which <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> conciliatory toward the Japanese. The antipathy between the two characters would define how Thailand fared by World War II when Japan was quickly consuming territory in Asia.|$|E
25|$|Khosrow {{promoted}} honest {{government officials}} based on trust and honesty, rather than corrupt nobles and magi. The small landowning deghans were favored over the high nobles because they <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> trustworthy and owned {{their loyalty to}} the Shah for {{their position in the}} bureaucracy. The rise of deghans became the backbone of the empire because they were now held the majority of land and positions in local and provincial administration.|$|E

Thus, the placement of unrounded vowels {{to the left of}} rounded vowels on the IPA vowel chart is reflective of their position in formant space.|$|R

25|$|Following the Civil War, Jewish shop-owners and landlords {{engaged in}} {{business}} with black customers and tenants, often filling a need where white business owners would not venture.

Jewish shop-owners <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> civil than other whites to black customers, treating them with more dignity. Blacks often had more immediate contact with Jews than with other whites.|$|E
25|$|When criminals were convicted, {{punishment}} was severe. Aside from the occasional Western sheriff and Marshal, {{there were other}} various law enforcement agencies throughout the American frontier, such as the Texas Rangers and the North-West Mounted Police. These lawmen were not just instrumental in keeping peace, but also in protecting the locals from Indian and Mexican threats at the border. Law enforcement <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> stringent in towns than in rural areas. Law enforcement emphasized maintaining stability more than armed combat, focusing on drunkenness, disarming cowboys who violated gun-control edicts and dealing with flagrant breaches of gambling and prostitution ordinances.|$|E

25|$|The Peranakans, {{descendants}} of mixed Malay and Chinese ancestries, were once {{the political and}} business elites in George Town. Some of the city's most influential associations, such as the Penang Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the Penang Straits Chinese British Association, were led by the Peranakans, who also represented Penang in the Straits Settlements Legislative Council. As the Peranakans <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> loyal to the British Crown than to China, they were {{also known as the}} King's Chinese. In spite of Malaysia's ethnic policies that have effectively forced the Peranakans to identify themselves as Chinese, Peranakan culture still thrives in George Town to this day, in the form of Straits Chinese architectural styles and dishes like asam laksa.|$|E
25|$|Michael Palin {{attended}} Oxford, {{where he}} met his Python writing partner Jones. The two also wrote the series Ripping Yarns together. Palin and Jones originally wrote face-to-face, but soon found it was more productive to write apart and then come together to review what the other had written. Therefore, Jones and Palin's sketches <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> focused {{than that of the}} others, taking one bizarre situation, sticking to it, and building on it. After Flying Circus, Palin hosted Saturday Night Live four times in the first 10 seasons. His comedy output began to decrease in amount following the increasing success of his travel documentaries for the BBC. Palin released a book of diaries from the Python years entitled Michael Palin Diaries 1969–1979, published in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Slapp Happy {{then left}} Polydor Germany {{and moved to}} London where a record deal was signed {{a deal with the}} then {{emerging}} Virgin Records label, which was looking for experimental groups. Faust and Henry Cow had already signed up. At Virgin's Manor Studios in Oxfordshire, Slapp Happy re-recorded Casablanca Moon with the help of session musicians (under the direction of violinist Graham Preskett) and Virgin released it as Slapp Happy in 1974. It was not until 1980 that Recommended Records released the original Casablanca Moon (with Faust) as Acnalbasac Noom (the words of the original title written backwards). Comparison of the two releases revealed two very different musical arrangements. Acnalbasac Noom had a raw and unsophisticated feel about it, whereas Casablanca Moon <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> sentimental with more complex arrangements, including a string orchestra.|$|E
