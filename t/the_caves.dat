5|$|<b>The</b> <b>caves</b> {{are open}} to {{visitors}} but flashlights are needed except in Indian Tunnel and some form of head protection is highly recommended when exploring any of <b>the</b> <b>caves.</b> Lava tubes are created when the sides and surface of a lava flow hardens. If the fluid interior flows away a cave is left behind. Entering caves requires a free permit.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>caves</b> {{date from}} between the 1st and 3rd century AD; the Ganesha shrine {{situated}} in Cave 7 is dated to the 1st century AD, though the date of conversion to a Hindu shrine is unknown. All of <b>the</b> <b>caves</b> arise from Hinayana Buddhism.|$|E
5|$|A 1000-year-old {{skeleton}} of a woman was discovered in <b>the</b> <b>caves</b> by Balch in 1912, and has also traditionally {{been linked to the}} legendary witch. The remains {{have been part of the}} collection of the Wells and Mendip Museum, which was founded by Balch, since they were excavated, though in 2004 the owner of <b>the</b> <b>Caves</b> said that he wanted them to be returned to Wookey Hole.|$|E
50|$|The {{allegory of}} <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> is {{also called the}} analogy of <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> myth of <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> metaphor of <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> parable of <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> and Plato's Cave.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cave</b> temples at <b>the</b> Ajaṇṭā <b>Caves,</b> <b>the</b> Ellora <b>Caves,</b> and <b>the</b> Karla <b>Caves</b> are {{associated}} with the Mahāsāṃghikas.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>cave</b> is [...] long, its width varies between , {{the height}} between [...] <b>The</b> <b>cave</b> {{temperature}} is constant at [...] year-round, with a humidity of about 95%. The age of <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> is estimated {{between one and}} two million years. During this time, all forms of sintering on the walls or on <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> floor have been created, including stalactites (dripping stones hanging from <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> ceiling) and stalagmite drips that grow up from <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> bottom.|$|R
5|$|Balch became {{interested}} in stratigraphy and cave archaeology after attending a talk by William Boyd Dawkins. Balch led much of the exploration through <b>the</b> <b>caves</b> near Wookey Hole village, discovering and mapping many caves. He also made discoveries of artefacts used {{by the people who}} lived in <b>the</b> <b>caves</b> during the Iron Age. Balch was a founder member of the Wells Natural History and Archaeology Society and through the society he founded the Wells Museum, largely including his own collection of artefacts.|$|E
5|$|Boat trips from Tobermory, Oban, Ulva Ferry and Fionnphort on Mull, and Iona allow {{visitors}} to view <b>the</b> <b>caves</b> and the puffins that nest {{on the island}} between May and September.|$|E
5|$|Cave 7, {{originally}} a Buddhist vihara, has been adapted as a Hindu temple {{dedicated to the}} god Ganesha. It {{is one of the}} Ashtavinayak shrines, a set of the eight prominent Ganesha shrines in Western Maharashtra. Twenty-six of <b>the</b> <b>caves</b> are individually numbered. <b>The</b> <b>caves</b> face to the south and are numbered serially from east to west. Caves 6 and 14 are chaitya-grihas (chapels), while the rest are viharas (dwellings for monks). The latter are in the form of dwellings and cells. There are also several rock-cut water cisterns; two of them have inscriptions. The layout of <b>the</b> <b>caves,</b> in general, are similar in pattern and shape. They generally have one or two sides with two long benches for occupants' use.|$|E
50|$|Anatakitaki <b>Cave,</b> or <b>the</b> <b>Cave</b> of <b>the</b> Kopekas, is a karst cave {{located on}} Atiu, Cook Islands. <b>The</b> <b>cave</b> {{is a large}} solutional cave, with many {{offshoot}} chambers and passages. A freshwater lake {{is to be found}} at the base of <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b> <b>The</b> Tiroto Tunnel connects this lake to the Pacific Ocean, and can be waded along until the last portion which is totally submerged. There is a great array of all sorts of speleothems decorating <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> throughout its length. <b>The</b> <b>cave's</b> alternate name comes from its population of Atiu swiftlets, which roost in <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> in vast numbers. They never land outside of <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> and use echolocation just like bats. Roots, mainly from banyan trees, permeate <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> to its furthest depths.|$|R
5000|$|Nickajack Cave was a {{commercial}} cave, off and on, {{since at least}} 1872. At that time, a newspaper clipping dated July 2, 1872 describes tours leaving from Chattanooga on the steamer R. J. Jackson providing trips to <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> where guides would take visitors into <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> in boats. Upon exiting <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> <b>the</b> visitors could catch the train from Shellmound (located {{directly in front of}} <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> entrance) back to Chattanooga. By 1927 <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> was being shown by Lawrence S. Ashley, who supposedly disappeared in <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> during exploration. His disappearance was covered by both the local Chattanooga newspapers and the New York Times. After being [...] "lost" [...] from August 15, 1927 through August 22, 1927, Ashley reappears, claiming that he dug his way out through a new entrance located 8 miles away. This entire episode was a hoax designed to gain publicity for <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> and increase <b>the</b> number of tourists visiting <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b> By <b>the</b> 1940s, <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> was being run by Leo Lambert, who is also known for developing nearby Chattanooga tourist attraction Ruby Falls. A cave brochure from this time period refers to <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> as [...] "Nickajack LaCaverns". <b>The</b> <b>cave</b> closed as {{a commercial}} operation sometime in the late 1940s. In the early 1960s, before <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> was flooded, <b>the</b> ruins of the gatehouse were present and in concrete floors were evident in the front passages. The entrance to <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> is extremely large. There was a small lake in front of <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> fed by <b>the</b> stream that flowed through <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cave</b> is 222 m. <b>The</b> dry <b>cave</b> is {{developed}} generally horizontal and partly vertical dry cave. Potsherds found in <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> point <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> {{was used as}} a settlement in ancient times.|$|R
5|$|In February 2009 Cottle {{turned the}} Victorian bowling green next to <b>the</b> <b>caves</b> into a crazy golf course without first obtaining {{planning}} permission.|$|E
5|$|Large {{areas of}} {{limestone}} on the Mendips have been worn away by water, making the hills a national centre for caving. Some of <b>the</b> <b>caves</b> {{have been known}} about since {{the establishment of the}} Mendip lead mining industry in Roman times. However, many have been discovered or explored only in the 20th century. Specialist equipment and knowledge is required to visit the vast majority of <b>the</b> <b>caves,</b> but Cheddar Gorge and Wookey Hole Caves are two show caves which are easily accessible to the public. The active Mendip Caving Group and other local caving organisations organise trips and continue to discover new caverns.|$|E
5|$|Several of <b>the</b> <b>caves</b> {{have been}} {{scheduled}} as ancient monuments as nationally important archaeological sites including: Gough's Old Cave, Great Oone's Hole, Saye's Hole, Soldier's Hole and Sun Hole.|$|E
50|$|When William Lynch died in 1927, {{ownership}} of <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> passed to his daughters {{and the name}} of <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> was changed to Marvel <b>Cave.</b> <b>The</b> Lynch family operated <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> for nearly fifty years until a Chicago vacuum cleaner salesman, Hugo Herschend, purchased a 100-year lease on <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Visitors {{are guided}} through <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> by audio head sets which inform them about {{chambers}} and rock formations. Since <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> {{has only one}} public opening, visitors exit <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> <b>the</b> way they entered. <b>The</b> <b>cave</b> stays at an average temperature of 57 degrees Fahrenheit (13.8 degrees Celsius) year round.|$|R
50|$|In June 2015 <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> {{administration}} {{reported that}} cave divers managed {{to explore a}} further underwater section of <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> leading towards Planina <b>Cave,</b> thus lengthening <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> system from 20570 m to 24120 m. <b>The</b> <b>cave</b> also houses <b>the</b> world’s only underground post office.|$|R
5|$|Smaller shrines {{are located}} at {{the east and west}} ends of <b>the</b> <b>caves.</b> The eastern {{sanctuary}} serves as a ceremonial entrance, and its shrine shows iconography of Shaktism tradition.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>caves</b> {{have been}} used by humans for around 45,000 years, {{demonstrated}} by the discovery of tools from the Palaeolithic period, along with fossilised animal remains. Evidence of Stone and Iron Age occupation continued into Roman Britain. A corn-grinding mill operated on the resurgent waters of the River Axe as early as the Domesday survey of 1086. The waters of the river are used in a handmade paper mill, the oldest extant in Britain, which began operations circa 1610. The low, constant temperature of <b>the</b> <b>caves</b> means that they can be used for maturing Cheddar cheese.|$|E
5|$|The hill is {{also known}} as Suleman Pahar ("Suleman hill") or Ganesh Pahar ("Ganesha hill"). An ancient {{inscription}} calls the place Kapichita (Kapichitta). <b>The</b> <b>caves</b> are also known as Ganesh Lena or Ganesh Caves.|$|E
50|$|The {{entrance}} to <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> is {{situated on the}} banks of the Wye through a gated doorway at the foot of a bluff. This is locked as a precaution against illegal entry to <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> both to protect the rare forms inside <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> and also to prevent anyone wandering into <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> and being trapped accidentally as <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> floods in sync with the tide.|$|R
50|$|Doubts {{about the}} {{accuracy}} of <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> survey (stated depth was anywhere between 575 and 630 m) led to a resurvey of most of <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> by Stein-Eric Lauritzen and others in 1991, which corrected the depth of <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> to 580 m. The entrances to <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> are located at elevations of 582 m, 80 m, and 3 m above sea level, with the low point of <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> at 2 m above sea level. <b>The</b> <b>cave</b> is known to resurge below sea level.|$|R
5000|$|Akelarrenlezea: a large cave of Zugarramurdi, (Navarre). The witches met {{actually}} outside <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> in <b>the</b> {{place of}} Berroskoberro. Some {{say that the}} goat talked to its worshippers from {{a hole in the}} stone outside <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b> Inside <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> <b>the</b> widest part measures 120 metres. The river of [...] "hell" [...] crosses along the centre of <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b> It has been eroding the floor of <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> for centuries, <b>the</b> ceiling of <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> is already 12 metres high. A limestone oven from the eighteenth century remains inside <b>the</b> biggest <b>cave.</b> Farmers found it useful to take more harvest out of the limestone oven. We can access another <b>cave</b> from <b>the</b> biggest cave: <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> of <b>the</b> Akelarre. The name of <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> derives from <b>the</b> meadow at the entrance of <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b> Akelarre used to be celebrated there. Further the river follows a deep gorge called [...] "the <b>cave</b> of <b>the</b> witches".|$|R
5|$|The {{significant}} {{statues of}} Vishnu {{are difficult to}} explain and to position inside other surviving caves. One theory states that some of <b>the</b> <b>caves</b> must have represented the Vaishnavism tradition. Another theory by some scholars such as Moti Chandra suggests that the island once had open air structural Hindu temples in addition to <b>the</b> <b>caves,</b> but these were the first victims of art destruction.|$|E
5|$|These caves are the inspirations for <b>the</b> <b>caves</b> behind Helm's Deep in J.R.R. Tolkien's The Two Towers.|$|E
5|$|Additional live {{specimens}} {{recovered in}} 2010 and 2011 from Oregon were all found deep inside caves. Except {{for a single}} juvenile specimen recovered from the understory debris of old growth redwood forests of northwest California, none have been found outside <b>the</b> <b>caves.</b> This specimen has different markings than T. marchingtoni and may represent a new undescribed species.|$|E
50|$|Artifacts {{recovered}} from <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> indicate that <b>the</b> <b>cave's</b> inhabitants used spears {{to hunt and}} fish. A ring of smaller stones surrounding a larger stone was found in <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> suggesting that ceremonies were held. Pottery shows that more recent Native Americans also lived in <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b>|$|R
25|$|Marvel Cave was {{originally}} called Marble Cave, after explorers in 1882 saw {{what they thought}} was marble on <b>the</b> <b>cave's</b> ceiling. This started <b>the</b> Marble <b>Cave</b> Mining Company, although later it was realized that there was never any marble in <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b> <b>The</b> Marble <b>Cave</b> Mining Company ceased all operations after only four and a half years. William Lynch purchased <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> in 1889, and soon after opened <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> to <b>the</b> public. In 1950, Hugo Herschend leased <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> for 99 years. The Herschends made renovations to <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> and later opened a theme park, Silver Dollar City, on the surface above <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b> Marvel Cave is known for being one of <b>the</b> largest <b>caves</b> in Missouri, having one of <b>the</b> largest <b>cave</b> entry rooms (<b>the</b> Cathedral Room) of any cave in North America, and for being one of the longest running tourist attractions in the Ozarks.|$|R
50|$|One of Sweden's longest <b>caves,</b> <b>the</b> Lummelunda <b>Cave,</b> is {{situated}} at Lummelunda. <b>The</b> <b>cave</b> {{is part of}} a nature reserve with the same name as <b>the</b> <b>cave,</b> Lummelundagrottan. <b>The</b> reserve, established in 1989, is 17 ha and includes <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> and <b>the</b> ground above it.|$|R
5|$|After declaring <b>the</b> <b>caves</b> a World Heritage Site, UNESCO and the ASI {{have worked}} {{together}} to monitor the site and implement conservation methods on a routine basis. The Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) is also involved with the Archaeological Survey of India in improving the local conditions at the cave site.|$|E
5|$|Balch was {{a member}} of caving clubs such as the Wessex Cave Club. He was a serious speleologist and often made ten-hour trips wearing cloth cap, old suit and tie. Balch Cave near Stoke St Michael is named after him. As an {{authority}} on <b>the</b> <b>caves</b> under the Mendip Hills, Balch was consulted by water companies who were looking for new water supplies.|$|E
5|$|Balch {{was awarded}} an honorary Master of Arts by Bristol University in July 1927 for devoting his leisure time to {{exploring}} and recording <b>the</b> <b>caves</b> of the Mendip Hills, becoming {{an authority on}} the subject. He retired as postmaster on 31 March 1931, whilst continuing his caving, working as the curator at the museum and giving lectures on archaeology.|$|E

5000|$|Barr's 1961 {{discussion}} of <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> says that <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> was intersected by a railway tunnel, and thus <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> accumulated soot {{that led to}} its closing to tourists. He says that [...] "exploring of <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> is unpleasant because {{of the necessity of}} wading, crawling, climbing, and becoming covered with soot, which coats all the upward-facing surfaces." [...] He says the soot extends well over a mile into <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cave</b> as it {{is today}} was {{discovered}} in 1922 but has been known to locals for many years. <b>The</b> <b>cave</b> is named for the disappearance of livestock in the vicinity of <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> being attributed to the Devil. Centuries later, after <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> had been fully explored, the missing livestock as well as numerous other animals including deer and cave bears were discovered to have fallen into <b>the</b> <b>cave</b> and died. One of these cave bear skeletons has been reconstructed and can be seen on the tour of <b>the</b> <b>cave.</b>|$|R
