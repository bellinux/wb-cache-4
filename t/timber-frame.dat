5|$|The {{surrounding}} {{area has been}} extensively landscaped to create outdoor learning areas and a wildlife garden. Energy-saving features include photovoltaic panels for electricity and {{ground source heat pump}} for heating. A green roof (a living roof that is partially or completely covered with vegetation and a growing medium), is used to absorb rainfall and provide insulation. The centre is constructed using <b>timber-frame</b> walls insulated with straw bales.|$|E
25|$|The {{old town}} core is small. It is {{distinguished}} by a many <b>timber-frame</b> buildings, some opulently painted and decorated, {{in which the}} Rhenish influences on the Hessian-Franconian <b>timber-frame</b> building style can already be seen. Therefore Idstein {{is part of the}} German Framework Road. The town core stretches between the castle area with its Hexenturm and the Höerhof, the representative <b>timber-frame</b> building built in 1620–1626 by the palace building master on the heights across from the Schloss. The painter Ernst Toepfer bought the property in 1911 and restored the building. Today, the Höerhof is a stylish hotel and restaurant with an idyllic inner courtyard.|$|E
25|$|König-Adolf-Platz is {{seamlessly}} {{ringed by}} representative <b>timber-frame</b> houses, mainly dating from about 1600. To the Town Hall's left stands the Schiefes Haus ("Crooked House"), which was renovated {{a few years}} ago, and which Nicolay, the major of the town militia, had built in 1527. On {{the way out of}} the square towards the Unionskirche, is the richly adorned Killingerhaus built in 1527, which has served as a museum and tourism office since 1987. It is one of Germany's most important <b>timber-frame</b> houses with regards to art history. According to one story, the building was originally built in Strasbourg, and when the owner moved to Idstein, he brought the house with him.|$|E
40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of Downtown Lisbon after the 1755 earthquake {{was based on}} a novel constructive system of masonry buildings with an internal three-dimensional <b>timber-framed</b> structure named ‘‘gaiola pombalina’’. This internal structure aimed at improving the global stability of masonry buildings, enhancing their capacity to dissipate energy under seismic loadings. But this structural system is not only typical of Portugal, but constitutes part of the built heritage of various countries. This paper aims at getting experimental insight on the mechanical behaviour of <b>timber-framed</b> walls subjected to in-plane loading, as only scarce information is available in literature, in order to assess their effective performance to seismic actions. To do this, the experimental results of cyclic tests carried out on traditional <b>timber-framed</b> walls with distinct typologies will be analysed, namely (1) unreinforced <b>timber-framed</b> walls without infill; (2) <b>timber-framed</b> walls without infill with Glass Fibre-Reinforced Polymer sheets (GFRP) placed at the connections; (3) <b>timber-framed</b> walls with brick masonry infill...|$|R

The town's oldest preserved house was originally built in 1410.|$|E
50|$|Parts of the 45 ha site {{are listed}} on the Commonwealth Heritage List, since 2004, with the {{citation}} stating:The heritage items include several <b>timber-framed</b> and fibrous-cement clad houses, the <b>timber-framed</b> Sergeants Mess and Single Officer's Mess, the former Airmen's Mess, the Administrative Building, the Gymnasium and Canteen building, the Commanding Officers' Residence, the non-denominational chapel, the water tower, Guard House, the <b>timber-framed</b> School of Instruction, and various other residential quarters.|$|R
50|$|Yarpole is one {{of several}} Herefordshire parishes whose {{belltower}} stands separate from the church. The ground stage is built of stone; the roofs and upper stage are <b>timber-framed.</b> It {{is one of}} a number of partly or largely <b>timber-framed</b> belltowers in Herefordshire. It is a Grade I listed building. The tower was thought to be 13th-century, but dendrochronology has dated its main timbers to 1192, making it one of the oldest <b>timber-framed</b> structures in England.|$|R
50|$|Also {{located near}} the slab hut is a stables, which is <b>timber-framed</b> and clad with {{corrugated}} iron, with large double timber doors located along one elevation. Attached to the stables is a <b>timber-framed</b> shed and set of timber yards.|$|R

25|$|The city of Wetzlar, {{located in}} the state of Hesse, Germany, is a former Free {{imperial}} city that owed much of its fame to being the seat of the Imperial Supreme Court (Reichskammergericht) of the Holy Roman Empire. Located at 8° 30′ E, 50° 34′ N, Wetzlar straddles the river Lahn and is on the German <b>Timber-Frame</b> Road which passes mile upon mile of half-timbered houses. Historically, the city has acted as the hub of the Lahn-Dill-Kreis on the north edge of the Taunus. The city is known for its ancient town and its medieval cathedral.|$|E

25|$|About 1800 BCE, {{there is}} a major {{cultural}} change in the Swat Valley with the emergence of the Gandhara grave culture. With its introduction of new ceramics, new burial rites, and the horse, the Gandhara grave culture is a major candidate for early Indo-Aryan presence. The two new burial rites—flexed inhumation in a pit and cremation burial in an urn—were, according to early Vedic literature, both practiced in early Indo-Aryan society. Horse-trappings indicate the importance of the horse to the economy of the Gandharan grave culture. Two horse burials indicate the importance of the horse in other respects. Horse burial is a custom that Gandharan grave culture has in common with Andronovo, though not within the distinctive <b>timber-frame</b> graves of the steppe.|$|E
25|$|During the 15th century, Sutton Coldfield {{underwent}} {{a process of}} change {{due in part to}} the turbulent ongoings with the Earls of Warwick and their possession of the manor house. In 1397, Thomas de Beauchamp, 12th Earl of Warwick, was punished by King Richard II for being a member of the Lords Appellant. All his possessions were confiscated, including the land at Sutton which was transferred to Thomas Holland, 3rd Earl of Kent. Upon King Richard II's death in 1400, Thomas de Beauchamp was returned his possessions although he died the following year. In 1446, Henry de Beauchamp, 14th Earl of Warwick died and the earldom was passed to his two-year-old daughter Anne, however King Henry VI collected the profits of the land whilst Anne was in her infancy. Anne died in 1448, and the estate and earldom passed to her aunt Anne Neville, although this was contested by her three older half-sisters. In his Itinerary, John Leland mentions that Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick and his wife Anne Neville, are believed to have built a new manor of <b>timber-frame</b> construction, with a lease given by King Henry VI in 1460 to Edward Mountfort suggesting that the manor was then occupied by the Mountfort family.|$|E

There are two single six-paned <b>timber-framed</b> casement windows in the rear wall. All windows, other than the louvre window in the porch, have semi-circular fanlights and textured glass. There are five buttresses along each wall.|$|R

500|$|As {{with its}} Bognor Regis and Minehead counterparts, the Skegness resort {{underwent}} further improvement work in 1998 {{with the construction}} of the Skyline Pavilion. This tented structure is described by tourism writer Bruce Prideaux as a [...] "Baby Millennium Dome" [...] even though it pre-dated the dome. The Pavilion contains entertainment facilities such as stages, bars, restaurants, shops and amusements. [...] The improvement programme also included the construction of 1,045 brand new accommodation units, making it the largest <b>timber-frame</b> construction project in Europe that year. At the same time, the company dropped its use of the possessive apostrophe, changing from Butlin's to Butlins; after the refurbishment the resort was renamed as Butlins Resort Skegness, as it remains to date.|$|E

The building has served a variety of purposes with shops {{on the ground floor}} and workshops and living quarters on the first and second floors. At one time The King's Head Inn occupied part of the building and a sculpture of a king's head, which acted as a sign for the pub is preserved within, and a replica is attached to the outside.
