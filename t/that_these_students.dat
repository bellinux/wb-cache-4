5|$|The {{images and}} media reports of {{children}} dying terrorized many children who, {{as demonstrated by}} later research, showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Children became a primary focus of concern {{in the mental health}} response to bombing and many bomb related services were delivered to the community, young and old alike. These services were delivered to public schools of Oklahoma and reached approximately 40,000 students. One of the first organized mental health activities in Oklahoma City was a clinical study of {{middle and high school students}} conducted 7 weeks after the bombing. The study focused on middle and high school students that had no connection or relation to the victims of the bombing. This study showed <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>students,</b> although deeply moved by the event and showing a sense of vulnerability on the matter, had no difficulty with the demands of school or home life, contrasting those who were connected to the bombing and its victims, who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.|$|E

2500|$|The pensionandos were a {{group of}} {{students}} sent to the U.S. for the purpose of gaining an education from an American university, with the hopes <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>students</b> can go back home to contribute to Filipino society. Starting in 1901, the pensionado program allowed for Filipino students to gain an education from an American university; unlike the “Manong” generation, there were a significant amount of Filipina women in the program. The Philippines was under U.S. colonial rule during the time the pensionado program was first put into place. American teachers in the Philippines encouraged Filipino students back home to adopt American styles of fashion and clothing and leave behind traditional Filipino garments. In the 1920’s, the camisa (blouse) and the saya (skirt) were used in conjunction to form {{what is known as the}} terno. The terno is alternatively referred to as the Maria Clara gown. The inspiration for the terno came about due to American evening gowns more utilitarian, with diminished skirts and sleeves. The terno was commonly worn among Filipina students as a replacement to the camisa. The perception was that traditional Filipino clothing such as the camisa were cumbersome and inconvenient for daily use. Because of this, American clothing became the standard for everyday wear in Filipino society. Physical education class in the Filipino curriculum was pivotal for this change. It allowed specifically for women to dress in non-traditional Filipino clothing and in athletic wear that was fashionable in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|Colleges use high sticker prices {{because it}} allows them wide {{latitude}} in how to use funds to attract the best students, as well as entice students with special skills or increase its overall racial or ethnic diversity. The most sought-after students can be enticed by high discounts while marginal students can be charged full freight. Further, the high sticker price is a marketing tool to suggest the overall worth of a college education, {{along the lines of}} encouraging people to think that [...] "schools that cost more must provide a better education." [...] A report by the Pew Research Center found that while there was growing concern about escalating college prices, most Americans believed that their personal investment in higher education was sound. But discounting adds complexity to decision-making, deterring some students from applying in some instances based on a false sense of unaffordability. In recent years, there has been attention to the problem of bright students from low-income backgrounds not applying to top colleges, and attending less challenging colleges instead or skipping college entirely; this phenomenon has been called undermatching in the sense <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>students</b> are not properly paired or [...] "matched" [...] with academically challenging colleges; there have been efforts at some colleges such as Williams to actively seek out bright low-income students. According to NBC reporter Nona Willis-Aronowitz, the financial makeup of the student body at elite colleges tends to be mostly affluent students, with some low-income students if the college actively seeks out bright low-income applicants, but few students from middle-class backgrounds. As a result, middle-class applicants are increasingly faced with a tough choice: to either attend an elite school, paying close to the sticker price, and graduate with substantial debt, or to attend a publicly supported state school with less debt; Aronowitz described this as the [...] "middle class squeeze". In 2015, however, there were several instances of private colleges reducing their tuition by more than 40%.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse the {{competencies}} of future primary school teachers in solving data analysis projects.

Even when the future teachers show a conceptual and procedural competence, they lack interpretative and application skills.

40|$|This article {{reports on}} a {{small-scale}} research project that explored the class-consciousness and working-class identities {{of a small group}} of student teachers in a university in south-east England.

It is argued <b>that</b> <b>these</b> <b>student</b> teachers' identities and class experiences have sculpted their motivations to become teachers and that the form of class-consciousness that they exhibit ultimately acts to mould attitudes and perspectives that suit the objectives of twenty-first-century primary education in a capitalist society.
