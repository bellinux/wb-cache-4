50|$|Two basic corona <b>treater</b> {{stations}} {{are used in}} extrusion coating applications. Bare Roll and Covered Roll.

5|$|Equality under Article 12(1) {{does not}} require that all persons are <b>treated</b> alike, but rather that all persons in like {{situations}} should be <b>treated</b> alike.

Article 12(1) prohibits laws which require that some individuals within a single class should be <b>treated</b> more harshly than others. However, the law is not unconstitutional if all persons discriminated against are equally discriminated against, and all persons not discriminated against are equally not discriminated against.
