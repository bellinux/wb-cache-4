5|$|Linguist Derek Bickerton, {{building}} {{on the work of}} biologist Bernd Heinrich, has argued that ravens are one of only four known animals (the others being bees, ants, and humans) who have demonstrated displacement, the capacity to communicate about objects or events that are distant in space or time from the communication. Young, unmated common ravens roost together at night, but usually forage alone during the day. However, when one discovers a large carcass guarded by a pair of adult ravens, the unmated raven will return to the roost and communicate the find. The following day, a flock of unmated ravens will fly to the carcass and chase off the adults. Bickerton argues that the advent of linguistic displacement was perhaps the most important event in the evolution of human language, and that ravens are the only other vertebrate <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>this</b> with humans.|$|E
5|$|Sir Tom Farmer {{took control}} of Hibs in 1991, but the club was still faced {{with the need to}} develop a stadium that would meet the {{requirements}} of the Taylor Report. Hibs entered talks with Edinburgh District Council about sharing a new stadium with Hearts, but the proposed site of Ingliston was in the wrong part of the city for Hibs. The club was more interested in the possibility of playing at Meadowbank Stadium, only a few hundred yards from Easter Road, but there were planning difficulties with adapting Meadowbank into a large football stadium. The reorganisation of the club after Farmer took control meant that there was no real pressure to move, as he also owned Easter Road. The Hibs board made an assessment, however, that the ground could not be renovated in a cost-effective fashion before the August 1994 deadline set by the Taylor Report. Hibs proposed in January 1992 to sell Easter Road and move to a site owned by Farmer in Straiton. Hibs also invited Hearts <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>this</b> stadium, as their proposal for a site in Millerhill had been rejected by planners. Those plans were scaled down in 1993 when Lothian Regional Council refused to allow the rest of the Straiton site to be used for commercial development. The Hibs board continued to back the Straiton proposal and they insisted the installation of bucket seats in the uncovered South Terrace was merely to comply with the Taylor Report deadline. This measure also reduced the capacity of Easter Road to 13,500.|$|E

25|$|The {{islands are}} famous among birdwatchers {{for their ability}} to attract rare birds from all corners of the globe. The peak time of year for this is {{generally}} in October when {{it is not unusual for}} several of the rarest birds in Europe <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>this</b> archipelago. One reason for the success of these islands in producing rarities is the extensive coverage these islands get from birdwatchers, but archipelagos are often favoured by rare birds which like to make landfall and eat there before continuing their journeys and often arrive on far flung islands first.|$|E
25|$|The PAM {{sequence}} {{appears to}} be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (nt) adjacent to the first nt of the protospacer. This nt becomes the final base in the first direct repeat. This suggests that the spacer acquisition machinery generates single-stranded overhangs in the second-to-last position of the direct repeat and in the PAM during spacer insertion. However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>this</b> mechanism as PAMs in other organisms do not show {{the same level of}} conservation in the final position. It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated {{at the very end of}} the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition.|$|E

25|$|Iohannis {{established}} {{contacts with}} foreign officials and investors. Sibiu was declared the European Capital of Culture of 2007, along with Luxembourg (the bearer {{of the distinction}} in 1995). Luxembourg chose <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>this</b> honourable status with Sibiu {{due to the fact}} that many of the Transylvanian Saxons emigrated in the 12th century to Transylvania from the area where Luxembourg is today. Sibiu, or Hermannstadt in German, was built by the Transylvanian Saxons, was for many centuries the cultural centre of that group, and was a predominantly German-speaking city until the mid 20th century. Many Germans left the city after World War II, and especially in 1990, within months of the fall of the Iron Curtain.|$|E
25|$|Only {{the females}} {{incubate}} the eggs. Once the female has laid the eggs, the male stops displaying {{and leaves the}} breeding grounds. This is unlike {{other members of the}} calidris genus where incubation is shared between males and females; therefore, the trait of male incubation has been independently lost in this species. There are only three documented species who have been known <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>this</b> behaviour. This development seems bizarre since experiments have shown that a decrease in the amount of male care is linked to a decrease in male fitness by lowering the number of male descendants that survive. One explanation for this evolution is that a decrease in male care allows the males to explore other breeding options. This hypothesis ties in {{with the fact that the}} white-rumped sandpiper is polygynous; males will mate with several females but females will only mate with one male.|$|E

Pennsylvanian surgeons the Attlee brothers made this procedure very routine for a total of 465 surgeries–John Attlee performed 64 successfully of 78 while his brother William reported 387– between the years of 1843 and 1883.

25|$|When Pottinger left Hong Kong on 13 June {{to rejoin}} the expedition, Johnston was again left in charge and was told not to grant land except for barracks and the troops' {{families}} who began to arrive from Britain. In October 1842, he informed Pottinger of the crime and disorder in the colony. Piracy was frequent and isolated houses were attacked, often by gangs who landed from boats. The jail was full, but Johnston said he lacked the authority to impose sentences on the inmates awaiting trial. Such conditions helped the Colonial Office {{be aware of the}} importance of establishing full control of law and order, and the danger of allowing the Chinese <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>this</b> responsibility. On 2 December, Pottinger returned from the north, and Johnston remained Deputy Superintendent of Trade, which was changed in 1843 to the Assistant and Registrar to the Superintendent of Trade. After Pottinger became the first Governor of Hong Kong on 26 June 1843, he appointed Johnston as a member of the Executive and Legislative Councils on 21 August.|$|E
25|$|When P. exigua catch prey, {{they return}} to the nest with a solid, usually glossy mass, held in their mouthparts. If the size of prey is {{relatively}} large, the wasp may hold the crop with its anterior legs. Wasps were reported <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>this</b> food with other adults and offer the protein in a macerated form to larvae. The water gathered by workers is placed directly onto {{the walls of the}} nest cells, usually without any contact with other wasps. Wood pulp and fibers are collected primarily for nest building. Wasps return to the nest with a solid mass taken in the mouthparts; they are usually smaller and darker than the prey crop. P. exigua has the habit of building white or light brown nests, so the item taken to the nest for colony growth was white and larger than the prey. This item is chewed, mixed with saliva and incorporated in the cell walls. Resin is gathered in order to build layers within the nest. Workers carrying resin to the nest travel to substrate sheets and proceed to lay their foraged material on top of the structure. This new layer remains there until the sheets stuck together and formed a stronger partition.|$|E

40|$|Efficient use {{of limited}} {{available}} resources on an FPGA remains a crucial problem for synthesizing pipelined designs. Resource <b>sharing</b> addresses <b>this</b> challenge.

We propose different techniques <b>to</b> address resource <b>sharing</b> problems of varying restrictions. Specifically, we propose an optimal algorithm for Constant-Slack Resource Sharing and a heuristic for the general Intra-Pipeline Stage Resource Sharing.
