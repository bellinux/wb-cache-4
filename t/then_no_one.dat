These are people, in fact, who have no knowledge of military matters, no skill in fighting, no moderation in ruling. There is no room then left for fear, but rather for shame, that those whom we have always sought on their own soil and overcome [...].have ...come flocking into our country." ...|$|E

Emperor Jillius himself informs Klonoa that he broke the sacred law of his kingdom by dreaming, which he views as a worthless endeavor and a total waste of time. The Emperor himself suffers from insomnia, and decrees that if he cannot be allowed to dream, <b>then</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> can. Rather than punish Klonoa outright, he instead offers him a challenge: defeat the four great monsters that are wreaking havoc on the land, {{and he will be}} set free. [...] Joined by his friend Huepow, Klonoa {{has no choice but to}} travel to the surrounding lands and do battle with the monsters living there, hoping to earn his freedom and bring peace to the kingdom at last. As they defeat the monsters, Klonoa and Huepow become suspicious that someone is using people's dreams for their own ends, as the monsters are in fact transformed versions of various people from each region (including Chipple). Once the duo figure out the culprit is at the imperial castle, they engage Jillius in a fight and manage to defeat him. Only afterwards it is revealed that Jillius' minister, Bagoo, was behind everything. Bagoo, revealing himself to be the King of Despair, explains that through Jillius he had orchestrated a master plan to create his own kingdom of stolen dreams, even if it meant turning all dreamers in the empire into monsters. Klonoa and Huepow manage to destroy him and Jillius afterwards seems to die in Klonoa's arms. It all turns out to be a dream that Jillius himself had had and he decides that to give his people their dreams and to protect them as well is his real purpose, thus remaking his empire into the Empire of Dreams.|$|E

2500|$|The {{impossibility of}} {{answering}} truly {{the question whether}} the 100th (or 10,000th) decimal {{in the evaluation of}} Pi is or is not a 9, splendidly illustrates how impossible it is to predicate truth in abstraction from actual knowing and actual purpose. For the question cannot be answered until the decimal is calculated. Until <b>then</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> knows what it is, or rather will turn out to be. And no one will calculate it, until it serves some purpose to do so, and some one therefore interests himself in the calculation. And so until then the truth remains uncertain: there is no 'true' answer, because there is no actual context in which the question has really been raised. We have merely a number of conflicting possibilities, not even claims to truth, and there is no decision. Yet a decision is possible if an experiment is performed. But his experiment presupposes a desire to know. It will only be made if the point becomes one which it is practically important to decide. Normally no doubt it does not become such, because for the actual purposes of the sciences it makes no difference whether we suppose the figure to be 9 or something else. I.e. the truth to, say, the 99th decimal, is ' true enough ' for our purposes, and the 100th is a matter of indifference. But let that indifference cease, and the question become important, and the ' truth ' will at once become ' useful '. Prof. Taylor's illustration therefore conclusively proves that in an actual context and as an actual question there is no true answer to be got until the truth has become useful. This point is illustrated also by the context Prof. Taylor has himself suggested. For he has made the question about the 100th decimal important by making the refutation of the whole pragmatist theory of knowledge depend on it. And what nobler use could the 100th decimal have in his eyes? If in consequence of this interest he will set himself to work it out, he will discover this once useless, but now most useful, truth, and—triumphantly refute his own contention! ...|$|E
2500|$|Scipio Africanus (235–183). His {{father a}} Roman general died at war in Hispania; years earlier his son Publius Cornelius Scipio (later Africanus) had saved his life. As <b>then</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> offered to succeed to his father's post, the son offered himself. The people's comitia {{accepted}} the son for the father, [...] "all this made a wonderful and indelible {{impression on the}} citizens and farmers of Rome." [...] Publius Scipio [...] "himself enthusiastic" [...] about others, accordingly [...] "inspired enthusiasm." [...] The Roman Senate acquiesqued to the mere military tribune serving {{in place of a}} praetor or consul, i.e., his father. [...] "He was not {{one of the few who}} by their energy and iron will constrain the world to adopt and to move in new paths for centuries, or who at any rate grasp the reins of destiny for years till its wheels roll over them." [...] Though he won battles and conquored nations, and became a prominent statesman at Rome, he was not an Alexander or a Caesar. [...] "Yet a special charm lingers around the form of that graceful hero; it is surrounded, as if with a dazzling halo... in which Scipio with mingled credulity and adroitness always moved." [...] His enthusiasm warmed the heart, but he did not forget the vulgar, nor fail to follow his calculations. [...] "ot naïve enough to share the belief of the multitude in his inspirations... yet in secret thoroughly persuaded that he was a man specially favored of the gods." [...] He would accept merely to be an ordinary king, but yet the Republic's constitution applied even to heroes such as him. [...] "o confident of his own greatness that he knew nothing of envy or of hatred, [...] courteously acknowledged other men's merits, and compassionately forgave other men's faults." [...] After his war-ending victory over Hannibal at Zama, he was called Africanus. He was an excellent army officer, a refined diplomat, an accomplished speaker, combining Hellenic culture with Roman. [...] "He won the hearts of soldiers and of women, of his countrymen and of the Spaniards, of his rivals in the senate and of his greater Carthaginian antagonist. His name was soon on every one's lips, and his was the star which seemed destined to bring victory and peace to his country." [...] Yet his nature seemed to contain [...] "strange mixtures of genuine gold and glittering tinsel." [...] It was said he set [...] "the fashion to the nobility in arogance, title-hunting, and client-making." [...] In his politics Scipio Africanus [...] "sought support for his personal and almost dynastic opposition to the senate in the multitude." [...] No demagogue, however, he remained content to merely be [...] "the first burgess of Rome".|$|E
