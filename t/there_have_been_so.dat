It wasn't like we helped ourselves when we described what was in people's heads. It wasn't to shock people, though, but to get people involved in what we were doing. We had to get peoples' attention.

500|$|Over {{the course}} of her {{appearances}} in Angel, Cordelia would develop enormously as a character. Describing this evolution, Carpenter comments, [...] "When I first started playing Cordelia, she wasn't nice. She has really deepened and has a stronger sense of responsibility. She's a team player, which was not the case in the beginning." [...] Carpenter cherishes what playing a multi-faceted character like Cordelia meant for her as an actress, describing The road Cordelia has travelled, the journey she has taken up to now has been such a joy to play as an actress, because <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> many chances to do so many different emotions. Heroic, vulnerable, just angry, possessed, funny [...] I get to be all those different things rolled into one. Getting this role, in hindsight... God I made a good decision, or they did. Cultural critic Jennifer Crusie points out how Cordelia was initially perfect for the transition to [...] "selfish, superficial Los Angeles", {{which turned out to be}} her [...] "trial by fire".|$|E
500|$|Mullins {{found that}} [...] "To choreograph a fight is {{constantly}} {{trying to be}} open to doing things differently, and making things creative as possible. Any sequence that you ever do, it doesn’t matter if it’s two punches or 50 punches. The same amount of danger is always there. In order to make something look organic and real, the performers and stunt performers have got to punch each other as hard as they can ... Both of us—myself and Sam—we worked with Kevin [...] on , so we knew the level that the director was wanting. So we both felt every piece had to be awesome, because he’s known for putting together amazing sequences that are both unique and hard hitting." [...] Jo also noted that [...] "trying to come up with things people haven’t seen before. <b>There</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> many action movies and so many Marvel movies, you’re constantly wanting to set the bar higher and higher. And it feels like the moves that are even possible just get narrower and narrower cause they’ve been done before." [...] Tancharoen later reflected that [...] "everyone really liked the May versus May fight", and so he and the stunt team would use it as a benchmark to overcome when designing action sequences for future episodes.|$|E

500|$|The {{miscarriage}} leaves Steffy devastated and {{she decides}} to leave town, ending her marriage to Liam. Wood noted that [...] "Steffy was so set on she really messed this up" [...] and noticed that Liam still had feelings for Hope. Speaking of the miscarriage {{and the end of}} Liam and Steffy's marriage, Wood explained: [...] "She is obviously trying a reason to get out of it. In her heart and soul, she wants to be with him. She felt he was her soulmate, but with everything that has happened, she feels it was her fault and she can't change that. She should never have gotten on that motorcycle and he told her not to. <b>There</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> many things that happened that it opens her eyes to the possibility that maybe he should be with Hope." [...] Upon Steffy's brief return to the show in 2015, she realizes that she still loves Liam, despite believing that these feelings were gone. Wood explained [...] "They lost a child together, so they’ll always have that emotional connection." [...] Despite liking the fact that Steffy [...] "speaks up" [...] and [...] "fights for love", Wood said that she wanted [...] "to see someone come in and sweep her off her feet and take that pain away", not wanting her to fight for [...] "a man that flip flops". However, Liam is involved with Steffy's cousin Ivy Forrester (Ashleigh Brewer) and Steffy does not win him back. Wood noted that [...] "in Steffy's mind, Ivy is just some new woman in town and Liam is fair game. He and Ivy have no history." [...] Eventually Liam breaks up with Ivy and after Steffy's marriage to Wyatt breaks down, Steffy and Liam rekindle their love and romance and they marry each other again for the third time.|$|E
500|$|Since independence, Latin American {{countries}} {{have been subject to}} both right and left-wing authoritarian regimes, stemming from a history of colonialism in which one group dominated another. Given this long history, it is unsurprising that <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> many novels [...] "about individual dictators, or about the problems of dictatorship caudillismo, caciquismo, militarism and the like." [...] The legacy of colonialism is one of racial conflict sometimes pushing an absolute authority to rise up to contain itthus the tyrant is born. Seeking unlimited power, dictators often amend constitutions, dismantling laws which prevent their reelection. Licenciado Manuel Estrada Cabrera, for example, altered the Guatemalan Constitution in 1899 to permit his return to power. The dictators who have become the focus of the dictator novel (Augusto Roa Bastos's I, the Supreme, for instance, is based on Paraguay's dictator of the early nineteenth century, the so-called Dr Francia) do not differ much from each other in terms of how they govern. As author González Echevarría states: [...] "they are male, militaristic, and wield almost absolute personal power." [...] Their strong-arm tactics include exiling or imprisoning their opposition, attacking the freedom of the press, creating a centralized government backed by a powerful military force, and assuming complete control over free thought. Despite intense criticisms leveled at these figures, dictators involved in nationalist movements developed three simple truths, [...] "that everybody belonged, that the benefits of Progress should be shared, and that industrial development should be the priority". Epitácio Pessoa, who was elected President of Brazil in 1919, wanted to make the country progress {{regardless of whether or not}} Congress passed the laws he proposed. In particular, during the Great Depression, Latin American activist governments of the 1930s saw the end of neocolonialism and the infusion of nationalist movements throughout Latin America, increasing the success of import substitution industrialization or ISI. The positive side-effect of the collapse of international trade meant local Latin American manufacturers could fill the market niches left vacant by vanishing exports.|$|E

[...] "And in the 1970s, I used to watch Willie Tyler and his Lester as well as Jay Johnson and Bob.

Look what happened. Did you hear of any particular efforts of the United Nations UNIFIL force in the south of Lebanon to prevent the attacks against Israel in the first place. So they were not useful and that is why we were unhappy with them." ...|$|E
2500|$|In August 2010, scenes showing Phil and Rainie {{taking the}} drug crack cocaine {{prompted}} over 200 complaints from viewers who felt the scenes were inappropriate. The BBC responded by saying [...] "EastEnders in no way – and at no point – glamorises or condones the use of drugs, and furthermore we took great care to avoid any demonstration on how to prepare or take drugs. We feel that Phil's decline will highlight the destructive nature of drugs, and rather than encourage drug use, will act as a deterrent." [...] A former cocaine addict, Sarah Graham, agreed with the BBC, saying [...] "I think it's really important that a mainstream character like Phil Mitchell is doing this storyline. [...] I'm not surprised that <b>there</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>so</b> many complaints about seeing this {{on one of our}} favourite soaps. The episode showed the brutal reality of addiction. [...] I can see that many people will be worried about children watching these scenes.
