50|$|At first, the Jewish {{community}} {{had to make}} do with a simple prayer room that had been set up in one of the Jewish houses. In the Judenordnung decreed by the Warsberg lordship in 1749, it was stipulated that a synagogue was not to be built too near the church. Shortly after 1750, a new synagogue (actually a new prayer room) was established; a new decree, a Synagogenordnung, was made for that to regulate the “ritual character” in the “shul at Hennweiler”. To be able to hold regular services, Jewish inhabitants from Bruschied and Schneppenbach also came to Hennweiler. In the 1781 great fire, the house that contained the prayer room was burnt down. It is not known when the Jewish community managed to set up a new one. It is believed that in the 1830s, community members Joseph Gottschall and his wife Sara acquired a building {{that could be used to}} establish a synagogue. For this synagogue, there came in February 1838 from the Israelite Consistory a new edict. By 1868 the building had fallen into disrepair and badly needed to be renovated. In 1895, the building had once again fallen into such disrepair that it was closed by police order. There were plans to build a new synagogue. Since, however, most Jewish families lived in relative poverty, it was thought that, among other things, a door-to-door collection in other Jewish communities in the Regierungsbezirke of Koblenz and Trier might be undertaken to raise the needed funds, but the authorities forbade this. In 1896, approval was granted to build a new synagogue. Master mason Johann Böres, from Hennweiler, built the new place of worship on Obergasse (a lane); the quarrystone and the sand was put at the builders’ disposal by the municipality from its own quarry. The new synagogue was consecrated amid much merrymaking on 22 August 1896. Until the mid 1930s, the Hennweiler synagogue was the hub of the local Hennweiler-Bruschied Jewish community’s religious life. The land <b>title</b> <b>register</b> listed the following as the synagogue’s owners: Martin Becker (broker), Bernhard Braun (cigar maker), Salomon Kahn (merchant), Alexander Sender (merchant), Max Sender (merchant), Jakob Schmelzer (merchant), Moses Vogel (merchant), Jacob Vogel (merchant), Lazarus Jakobi (merchant), Leopold Binnes (merchant) and Siegmund Sender (merchant), all of whom were from Hennweiler, and Michael Bornhard I (merchant) and Michael Bornhard II (merchant), both of whom were from Bruschied. During the pogrom in November 1938 (actually the evening after Kristallnacht), the synagogue was defiled. The windows and doors were smashed up and the pews were chopped up with axes. The Torah scrolls as well as other written matter, and the Judaica were burnt out in the street. In the spring of 1939, the Jewish community was forced by the Nazis to sell the synagogue property and the Jewish graveyard to the municipality. In the winter of 1939/1940, the synagogue building was further desecrated by being used by Wehrmacht troops as a munitions storage. It was then used from August 1940 to February 1945 as a school gymnasium. After 1945, the building was once more transferred to the municipality according to a decision handed down at restitution proceedings in March 1951. The municipality then sold it to a private citizen, and before the year had ended, the new owner had had it torn down so that a house could be built on the lot. The synagogue’s address was Obergasse 29.|$|E

40|$|Since {{public access}} to the {{register}} of land titles was introduced under the Land Registration Act 1988, title registration has undertaken a transformation. The opening of the register provided for a transformation to arise, changing title registration from a record of land holding into a data resource of significant economic value. As a consequence of processes of commodification, that utilise the new wealth and property found in and on title data, {{it is argued that}} a practical and conceptual transformation has arisen. This study will examine the commodification of data and of risk that has arisen in response to the exploitation and manipulation of title data initiated by the Land Registry. The case studies in this thesis will explore the use of data derived from the register, and its integration within associated business models outside of the Registry to create revenue streams and to exploit the new property found in and on data. The thesis will explore and evidence multiple processes of the commodification of data and of risk that change conveyancing and marketing practices. Examples of the commodification of title data will be explored through an analysis of: the publication of 'Price Paid' data, the use of the <b>title</b> <b>register</b> and title data by the real estate sector and the emergence of property title fraud. This research will also explore the sale of insurance that focus on related 'risk' for chancel repair liability and property title fraud; illustrating further the transformation of title registration from record into data...|$|E

40|$|Ecologically {{sustainable}} development {{has become a}} major feature of legal systems at the international, national and local levels throughout the world. In Australia, governments have responded to environmental crises by enacting legislation imposing obligations and restrictions over privately-owned land. Whilst these obligations and restrictions may well be necessary to achieve sustainability, the approach to management of information concerning these instruments is problematic. For example, management of information concerning obligations and restrictions in Queensland is fragmented, with some instruments registered or recorded on the land <b>title</b> <b>register,</b> some on external registers, and some information only available in the legislation itself. This approach is used in most Australian jurisdictions. This fragmented approach has led to two separate but interconnected problems. First, the Torrens system is no longer meeting its goal of providing a complete and accurate picture of title. Second, this uncoordinated approach to the management of land titles, and obligations and restrictions on land use, has created a barrier to sustainable management of natural resources. This is because compliance with environmental laws is impaired in the absence of easily accessible and accurate information. These problems demonstrate a clear need for reform in this area. To determine how information concerning these obligations and restrictions may be most effectively managed, this thesis will apply a comparative methodology and consider three case studies, which each utilise different models for management of this information. These jurisdictions will be assessed according to a set of guidelines for comparison to identify which features of their systems provide for effective management of information concerning obligations and restrictions on title and use. Based on this comparison, this thesis will devise a series of recommendations for an effective system for the management of information concerning obligations and restrictions on land title and use, taking into account any potential legal issues and barriers to implementation. This series of recommendations for reform will be supplemented by suggested draft legislative provisions...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{preprint}} of a {{paper from}} the International Conference on Cadastral Reform, Korea, 16 - 17 July, 1996. Australian cadastral systems have been strongly influenced by the historical settlement of the Australian states and territories. An important consequence is that no cadastral office was ever established {{and as a result}} a coordinated cadastre never developed. Departments of Lands or Surveyors General departments administered the ever decreasing Crown lands as a result of rapid alienation, as well as the jurisdictions' surveying and mapping infrastructure. As a result Australia lacked a European style cadastral office providing a complete cadastral record which could be used for land administration purposes. Land Titles Offices historically had the responsibility for all freehold or private lands, which now comprise the vast majority of land parcels in the states. These Offices have been responsible for examining all cadastral surveys and ensuring appropriate regulations for such surveys, however they have only ever been concerned with individual transactions in support of an efficient land market. The maintenance of the cadastral map for each jurisdiction however has usually remained {{under the control of the}} Surveyor General or in recent years a geographic information coordination agency. Increasingly the <b>title</b> <b>register</b> in each jurisdiction is including all Crown and government lands and is assuming the role of a European cadastre, albeit the cadastral index has legal significance since it is based on actual land titles. Due to computerisation of the titles register and the establishment of digital cadastral data bases (DCDB), the trend in Australia is for the textual and spatial components of the cadastre to come together technically and administratively. This has allowed Australian jurisdictions for the first time to have a complete cadastral record to support land administration. The resulting model has permitted Australia to move from a land administration structure that was conceptually well behind that of most developed and many developing countries to a position at the forefront of developments due to innovation and computerisation. The development of coordinated cadastres formed by upgrading the now complete DCDBs in Australia is the key in the future improvement of Australia's cadastral systems. This paper reviews this development and shows how the Australian systems differ from their European counterparts. It concludes by attempting to describe a future conceptual model for an Australian state wide geographic information system based on a legal cadastre. Australian states and territories are well advanced to achieving this vision. 16 - 17 July, 1996 Open Acces...|$|E
