5|$|Pilots {{noted that}} in a crosswind, <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plane would not point {{directly}} at the enemy, but could be, say, 20 degrees off, {{to compensate for the}} wind. Since making the beams bright enough at such a wide angle was impracticable, pilots were instructed to fly on the curving approach path which keeps the nose pointed towards the enemy at all times, rather than a straight-line path with the nose pointed upwind.|$|E
5|$|An {{introduction}} to the series is the Pilot Assist feature. Intended for players new to the series, it is a passive auto-piloting feature that assists players by nudging {{them away from the}} edges of the track or from walls, though its effects at higher speed settings are less desirable. Wipeout HD allows players to control their craft by using the motion-sensitive features of the PlayStation's Sixaxis controller. Motion control comes in two variants: pitch and steering, or pitch only. The former allows the craft to be totally controlled by moving the controller, while the latter only allows <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> craft to be raised or lowered by motion control, with the steering either controlled by analogue stick or D-pad.|$|E
5|$|Investigators {{believed}} the aircraft captain survived {{for a short}} time after the crash. His body was a short distance away from his seat and both were a few metres ahead of the wreckage where they had been thrown after <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft was split open in the impact with a large tree. The seat belt had not broken, but it had been undone. The captain's tunic was pulled up over his head as though to protect his face from the heat of the nearby inferno. Investigators believed he survived the crash and undid his seat belt to drag himself away from the fire. His body was not burnt, but autopsy showed both his legs were broken and he died from a fractured skull.|$|E

50|$|During {{his time}} with the Tigers, Bert made many friends by using his artistic talents to {{personalize}} <b>the</b> <b>noses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> P-40Bs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> “Panda Bear” squadron <b>of</b> <b>the</b> AVG with cartoons and caricatures for the pilots.|$|R
25|$|TGVs have semi-permanently coupled {{articulated}} un-powered coaches, with Jacobs bogies {{between the}} coaches supporting both of them. Power cars {{at each end}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trains have their own bogies. Trains can be lengthened by coupling two TGVs, using couplers hidden in <b>the</b> <b>noses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> power cars.|$|R
5|$|The XF6U {{was a small}} {{aircraft}} with tricycle {{landing gear}} and with straight wings and tail surfaces. The wings were short enough {{that they did not}} need to fold. In order to fit more aircraft into crowded hangars, the nose gear could be retracted and the aircraft's weight would rest on a small wheel attached by the ground crew. This raised the tail up so that it could overlap <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft behind it, allowing more aircraft to fit into available hangar space. The turbojet engine was mounted {{in the rear of the}} fuselage and was fed by ducts in each wing root.|$|E
5|$|The YF-23 was an unconventional-looking aircraft, with {{diamond-shaped}} wings, {{a profile}} with substantial area-ruling to reduce aerodynamic drag at transonic speeds, and an all-moving V-tail. The cockpit was placed high, near <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft for good visibility for the pilot. The aircraft featured a {{tricycle landing gear}} configuration with a nose landing gear leg and two main landing gear legs. The weapons bay {{was placed on the}} underside of the fuselage between the nose and main landing gear. The cockpit has a center stick and side throttle.|$|E
5|$|The face appears wide due to ruffs of {{extended}} hair beneath the ears. Bobcat eyes are yellow with black pupils. <b>The</b> <b>nose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bobcat is pinkish-red, {{and it has}} a base color of gray or yellowish- or brownish-red on its face, sides, and back. The pupils are round, black circles and will widen during nocturnal activity to maximize light reception. The cat has sharp hearing and vision, and a good sense of smell. It is an excellent climber, and swims when it needs to, but normally avoids water. However, cases of bobcats swimming long distances across lakes have been recorded.|$|E
50|$|He again helped organise {{numerous}} escape attempts, {{including a}} daring daylight attempt, when two officers cut through <b>the</b> wire under <b>the</b> <b>noses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sentries. Buckley had organised elaborate diversions, allowing the escapees {{to cut through}} to freedom. Unfortunately, both men were recaptured within a few days.|$|R
50|$|He later left San Francisco {{and began}} setting {{up his own}} crime {{syndicate}} centered on pearl smuggling. He quickly became an accomplished criminal, acting under <b>the</b> <b>noses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Navy and becoming adept at <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> espionage. When Kagg’s criminal empire was at its top, he was {{a force to be}} reckoned with.|$|R
25|$|By dawn, Wuchao {{had turned}} into an inferno and <b>the</b> morale <b>of</b> Yuan Shao's army {{plummeted}} sharply due to <b>the</b> loss <b>of</b> food supplies. Cao Cao also cut off <b>the</b> <b>noses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead, mixed them with <b>noses</b> and lips <b>of</b> oxen and horses, and showed them to Yuan Shao's men, {{as a form of}} intimidation.|$|R
5|$|The {{most radical}} {{feature of the}} {{original}} car was its use of flat plate heat exchangers mounted flush {{to the surface of}} the bodywork in place of conventional water radiators. The absence of standard radiators allowed Murray to compensate somewhat for the large engine and fuel tanks and produce a relatively light design with a low frontal cross section (important to reduce drag). In practice the heat exchangers did not provide anything like enough cooling capacity, one of South African Murray’s rare design failures, and were replaced by more standard radiators in <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car, similar to that of the BT45, compromising its aerodynamic efficiency. In addition to the question of drag the nose-mounted radiators moved weight towards the front of the car.|$|E
5|$|Two Gemini-derived {{spacecraft}} {{were considered}} for unmanned resupply flights. The {{first of these}} would have involved a Gemini spacecraft, with all systems for manned flight, re-entry and landing removed. The spacecraft would have docked using a port {{at the front of}} the spacecraft. Cargo would have been transferred through <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spacecraft, where the re-entry attitude control system was located on the manned spacecraft. The spacecraft was equipped with a liquid propellant engine to perform rendezvous, and to reboost the space station. The other proposal was for a new spacecraft to be built for unmanned missions, but re-using as many Gemini systems as possible. It would have had a higher cargo capacity than the stripped-down version of the Gemini spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|Tank, {{himself a}} capable {{development}} test pilot, {{took over the}} test program to investigate the aircraft's stalling characteristics, although the requisite airframe changes took several months to complete, with the Pulqui II N. 02(m) so modified not able to undertake its third proving flight until 23 October. During the ensuing high-altitude test, on two successive occasions, the IAe 33 stalled inadvertently, although Tank had sufficient height at 9,000 m for recovery. Adding ballast to <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft cured the problem. On 8 February 1951, Tank publicly demonstrated the IAe 33 before Perón at the Aeroparque Jorge Newbery in Buenos Aires. The audience also included government officials, legislators and the foreign diplomatic corps in the military attaches of the embassies, along with a large crowd of spectators. Both the IAe 27 Pulqui I and IAe 33 Pulqui II flew during the demonstration.|$|E
50|$|For Six Flags Great America's Fright Fest {{event in}} 2005 {{almost all of}} Demon's {{original}} theming returned. Decals similar to the original logos were added to <b>the</b> <b>noses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trains, fog returned in the tunnels, the Demon Song played in the queue again, red lights shined around the ride, and tiki torches were placed all around the ride.|$|R
50|$|Hallasholm - <b>The</b> capital <b>of</b> Skandia. This is the where Erak rules <b>the</b> whole <b>of</b> Skandia {{as well as}} an {{excellent}} harbor. The Andomal is also kept here, until Zavac steals it right under <b>the</b> <b>noses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Heron Brotherband after winning the Brotherband training. For this reason, they chase Zavac to gain back the Andomal as well as their honour.|$|R

5|$|Transmissions {{took place}} {{from a single}} {{arrowhead}} antenna mounted on <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft. This consisted of a folded dipole with a passive director in front of it, both bent rearward at about 35 degrees, projecting from the nosecone on a mounting rod. For vertical reception, the receiver antennas consisted of two half-wave unipoles mounted {{above and below the}} wing, with a reflector behind them. The wing acted as a signal barrier, allowing the antennas to see only the portion of the sky above or below the wing as well as directly in front. These antennas were angled rearward at the same angle as the transmitter. The horizontal receivers and directors were mounted on rods projecting from {{the leading edge of the}} wing, the antennas aligned vertically. The fuselage and engine nacelles formed the barriers for these antennas.|$|E
5|$|The Horsa and Hamilcar gliders of {{the brigade}} landed at 21:00 on 6 June in a landing zone cleared of {{obstructions}} by the 5th Parachute Brigade. The primary tasks of the brigade were {{to bring in}} reinforcements and supplies, and to aid the two parachute brigades in consolidating the area held by the division; the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Squadron was {{to aid in the}} latter task, acting as a reconnaissance force to scout out German positions and impede the movement of German forces attempting to counter-attack. The Tetrarchs of 'A' Squadron were to play an integral part in this reconnaissance role due to their speed, but the squadron's strength of twenty tanks was severely depleted by the time it landed in Normandy. It lost one tank before the formation landed when the Tetrarch broke loose of its shackles and crashed through <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> glider that was carrying it, causing both to fall into the sea mid-flight. The squadron's strength was further weakened when two gliders collided with each other in the landing zone, destroying themselves and the Tetrarchs they carried; a third Hamilcar hit another Tetrarch as it was being unloaded and flipped the tank upside down, rendering it unusable, although the crew escaped without injury. The surviving tanks were then rendered temporarily immobile when parachute rigging lines became tangled in their suspensions, forcing their crews to cut the lines away with welding torches.|$|E

2500|$|The two {{projects}} were legally joined and renamed the Virginian Railway in early 1907. Despite efforts to stop them, they then built the [...] "Mountains to Sea" [...] railroad under <b>the</b> <b>noses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> big railroads and <b>the</b> elite group <b>of</b> a few industrialists (so-called [...] "robber barons") who controlled them. Completed in 1909, the Virginian Railway was largely financed with Rogers' personal fortune. It was a modern, well-engineered railroad with all-new infrastructure and could operate {{more efficiently than}} its larger competitors.|$|R
50|$|For {{nearly two}} years Pathfinder {{operated}} along the dangerous New Guinea-New Britain-Solomon Islands areas allied land-air-sea forces fought to break the Japanese grip on the area. An isolated reef, an uncharted harbor, a lonely stretch of enemy hold coastline—each presented a different problem. At Bougainville, Treasury Island, Green Island, Emirau and Guam, advance Pathfinder parties were sent ashore under <b>the</b> <b>noses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Japanese to work in close cooperation with Allied amphibious elements in laying out harbor charts or surveying inland channels.|$|R

2500|$|Israeli {{journalist}} Gideon Levi {{described the}} area around the Tel Rumeida settlement in the following terms:There is no neighbourhood like this one. Not a day passes without <b>the</b> throwing <b>of</b> stones, garbage, and feces at the frightened (Palestinian) neighbours cowering in their barricaded houses, afraid even to peek out the window. Neighbours whose way home is always a path of torment and anxiety. All this is happening right under <b>the</b> <b>noses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> soldiers and police, representatives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legal authorities, who merely stand by.' ...|$|R
25|$|The {{pre-season}} saw plenty <b>of</b> action off <b>the</b> ice. Toronto NHA owner Eddie Livingstone {{had found}} a partner in Percy Quinn, manager <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Toronto Arena Gardens, {{to take on the}} NHA/NHL owners. The two together tried to lease the ice time at the Toronto Arena Gardens, Ottawa Arena and Montreal Jubilee Rink from under <b>the</b> <b>noses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> NHL owners, launched several lawsuits, attempted to launch a competing league and attempted to relaunch the NHA, but ultimately were unsuccessful. The NHA, while not operating, met three times.|$|R
25|$|The Conroy Tri-Turbo-Three was a Douglas DC-3 {{fitted with}} three Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6 engines by Conroy Aircraft; the third engine was mounted on <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Ford 4-AT-C: Similar to the Ford 4-AT-B, {{equipped}} with a 400-hp (300-kW) Pratt & Whitney Wasp radial piston engine, fitted in <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft; one built.|$|E

5|$|All four {{receiver}} antennas {{were connected}} via separate {{leads to a}} motorized switch that selected each one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> inputs in turn, sending it into the amplifier. The output was then switched, using the same system, to one of four inputs into the CRTs. The entire radar dipole aerial setup for the AI Mk.IV was simple {{in comparison to the}} 32-dipole Matratze (mattress) transceiving array fitted to <b>the</b> <b>noses</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earliest German night fighters to use AI radar, for their own UHF-band Lichtenstein B/C airborne radar design from 1942–43.|$|R
2500|$|The second McKinnon {{conversion}} was {{the model}} G-21D, which {{differed from the}} G-21C only by <b>the</b> insertion <b>of</b> a 36-inch (91-cm) extension in <b>the</b> <b>nose</b> section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft in front <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cockpit, and 12-inch (30-cm) extensions that {{were added to the}} horizontal stabilizers and elevators. <b>The</b> extended <b>nose</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> G-21D was distinguishable by <b>the</b> addition <b>of</b> two new windows on each side, and it housed four additional passenger seats. Only one G-21D was built and it was actually reconverted from the first G-21C. When later further converted to turbine engines, it was nicknamed [...] "Turboprop Goose".|$|R
