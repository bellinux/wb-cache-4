5000|$|..... the Tajika or {{the annual}} horoscopy, has been rather {{overwhelmingly}} {{dominated by the}} natal horoscopy. Recently, however, the need to resort to annual horoscopy has been increasing in our industrial society where career planning, travel planning, work planning and job planning are done with in a specified time-table of one to, say, five years. In which of {{the next five years}} it would be more fruitful to start a venture is a question many people ask. This question is generally answered {{on the basis of the}} birth horoscope, the dasha periods and transits.The question is, whether such pinpointed guidance and counselling can be further refined and put in sharp focus astrologically? ... The Tajika takes care of all those areas that are covered by the natal horoscopy. Thus it can reveal about health and disease, marriage, childbirth, income, expenditure, promotions, <b>transfer,</b> <b>travel,</b> rise and fall in career, imprisonment, death, etc. It is true to say that the Tajika cannot give what the birth horoscope does not promise. It is truer to say that the Tajika reveals, with greater clarity, the year in which the promise of the birth horoscope will be fulfilled. The Tajika is thus complimentary, supplementary and confirmatory in nature." ...|$|E

The GIS-based methodology takes into account timber, hunting, carbon sequestration, non-use and recreation benefits and opportunity costs of converting agricultural land, as well as planting and management costs of the new forest. The recreation benefits of new forest sites are estimated using function transfer techniques. We show that the net social benefit of new forest combinations respecting the area constraints may differ up to a factor 21. The substitution effect between forests, both new and existing, {{turned out to be}} the dominant factor in the benefit estimation.

The GIS-based methodology takes into account use benefits such as timber, hunting, carbon sequestration and recreation, non-use benefits (both bequest and existence values), opportunity costs of converting agricultural land, as well as planting and management costs of the new forest. The recreation benefits of new forest sites are estimated using function transfer techniques.

40|$|The {{sharing of}} {{information}} between vehicles via vehicle-to-vehicle communication {{has a great}} potential for future traffic surveillance and management applications. One possible use case is the communication {{of information about the}} state of the road network, for example by <b>transferring</b> <b>travel</b> times into the navigation devices enabling them to compute routes using this knowledge. This work reports about a set of simulation results where the benefit of using information exchanged between vehicles was evaluated for a city scenario using an extended microscopic traffic flow simulation. The scenario is based on validated real-life data for a normal weekday within a middle-sized German city. Contrary to other approaches, the used model of vehicle-to-vehicle communication was implemented directly into the traffic simulation. It was kept as simple as possible in order to allow a fast execution needed for evaluating the effects on a large scale and was calibrated using data from the real life. This simulation study evaluates the influences of the model’s parameters and of the amount of vehicles equipped with vehicle-to-vehicle devices on the mean travel time within the simulated city. ...|$|R

50|$|Integration {{of traffic}} data with {{navigation}} systems enables navigation systems to use traffic {{and other related}} data to optimise routing and travel times by taking into account traffic conditions and other disruptions to traffic flows. The integration may occur {{in a number of}} ways. For example, integrated automobile navigation systems use an on-board navigation system and cellular telephone. The navigation system would use the global positioning system (GPS) to position the automobile with respect to streets in a map database, to determine a route to the destination and to update the location as the automobile moves. A cellular telephone in the automobile may then communicate with a traffic information server to obtain travel times for each street segment of the route, which would then be used to refine the planned route, or to offer to the driver as an alternative. The cellular telephone {{can also be used to}} provide dynamic travel time information to the traffic information server, with each automobile in the system periodically <b>transferring</b> <b>travel</b> times for each segment that is traversed. The traffic information server would then analyse travel times to update travel time data for each street segment, which is then available to other users when they next connect to the traffic server. Other integration models exist.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to study}} the use of travel approaches in transit users’ access stop choice behavior. For this purpose, discrete choice models are developed with nested logit structure where users travel approaches are placed in the upper level (nest) and the associated stops are modelled as children of each nest. Stop choice attributes includes: facility attributes, path attributes associated with each stops, correction factors to address {{the correlation between the}} paths and users socio-economic factors. The data used in this research was taken from the household travel survey (HTS) of 2009 in Southeast Queensland (SEQ), Australia. This study proves that the transit users use travel approaches like minimize travel time, minimize access time and minimize number of transfer to choose their access stop. They even use dual approaches for access stop choice. It further shows that path attributes along with some stop attributes affect the decision making. The path attributes like walking time in the path, <b>transfers,</b> <b>travel</b> time etc. and stop attributes like walking time to access, number of routes, presence of lighting, number of maps show significant effects on transit stop choice. The results also show that the walking time needed to access the preferred stop is valued very highly than the travel time or walking time in the path. Users seem to prefer choosing stops that have more direct route (minimum transfer) and/or more route option to reach the destination...|$|R
