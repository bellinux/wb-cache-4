5|$|Previously, <b>Tajikistan</b> was {{on track}} to become a {{potential}} member of the union, having signed the treaty on the Eurasian Customs Union and the Single Economic Space. However, due to border disputes between Kyrgyzstan and <b>Tajikistan,</b> the integration process in <b>Tajikistan</b> has stalled. Both countries exchanged fire in December 2013 and August 2014, which resulted in casualties. Both countries have since announced they would resolve conflicts and improve border cooperation. Officials hope to make significant progress {{by the end of}} 2015.|$|E
5|$|Antigua and Barbuda, <b>Tajikistan,</b> Lesotho, and Kyrgyzstan {{introduced}} an Electronic Visa facility for {{citizens of the}} Republic of Lebanon on 3 July 2016, 3 June 2016, 1 May 2017, and August 9 respectively..|$|E
5|$|In 1991, Dani {{was made}} an Honorary Citizen of Bukhara and an Honorary Member of the Paivand Society in <b>Tajikistan.</b> He was made an Honorary Life Patron of the Al-Shifa Trust, Rawalpindi, in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Because Kazakhstan {{was once}} {{a member of the}} USSR, its rail system connects with and carries the same rail gauge as the Russian rail system, {{as well as the other}} Central Asian republics of Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and <b>Tajikistan.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, {{and later}} acceding states Kyrgyzstan and <b>Tajikistan</b> signed the first {{agreements}} on {{the establishment of}} a Customs Union. Its purpose was to gradually lead the way toward the creation of open borders without passport controls between member states.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Saleh was {{appointed}} by mujahideen leader Massoud to serve as Northern Alliance's liaison office inside the Afghan Embassy in Dushanbe, <b>Tajikistan,</b> handling contacts to international non-governmental (humanitarian) organizations and intelligence agencies. In late 2010, Saleh created a pro-democracy and anti-Taliban movement called Basej-e Milli (National Mobilization) and Green Trend.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, Kyrgyzstan and <b>Tajikistan</b> {{signed the}} Treaty on the Customs Union and the Single Economic Space by {{clarifying}} {{the goals and}} policies the states would undertake in order to form the Eurasian Customs Union and the Single Economic Space.|$|E
5|$|P. m. dilutus, {{described}} by Charles Wallace Richmond in 1856, is resident {{in the extreme}} northeast of Iran, northern Pakistan and northwest India. It also occurs further north, from Uzbekistan and <b>Tajikistan</b> east to China. Compared to P. m. montanus, it is paler, with sandy-brown upperparts.|$|E
5|$|T. m. intermedius is an Asiatic race {{breeding}} from Central Russia to <b>Tajikistan,</b> {{western and}} north east Afghanistan, and eastern China. Many birds are resident {{but some are}} altitudinal migrants and occur in southern Afghanistan and southern Iraq in winter. This is a large subspecies, with a sooty-black male and a blackish-brown female.|$|E
5|$|The Sogdian states, {{although}} never politically united, were {{centred on}} the main city of Samarkand. Sogdiana lay north of Bactria, east of Khwarezm, and southeast of Kangju between the Oxus (Amu Darya) and the Jaxartes (Syr Darya), embracing the fertile valley of the Zeravshan (ancient Polytimetus). Sogdian territory corresponds to the modern provinces of Samarkand and Bokhara in modern Uzbekistan {{as well as the}} Sughd province of modern <b>Tajikistan.</b> During the High Middle Ages, Sogdian cities included sites stretching towards Issyk Kul such as that at the archeological site of Suyab. Sogdian, an Eastern Iranian language, is no longer a spoken language, but its direct descendant, Yaghnobi, is still spoken by the Yaghnobis of <b>Tajikistan.</b> It was widely spoken in Central Asia as a lingua franca and even served as one of the Turkic Khaganate's court languages for writing documents.|$|E
5|$|The {{jungle cat}} is listed under CITES Appendix II. Hunting is {{prohibited}} in Bangladesh, China, India, Israel, Myanmar, Pakistan, <b>Tajikistan,</b> Thailand and Turkey. But {{it does not}} receive legal protection outside protected areas in Bhutan, Georgia, Laos, Lebanon, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|The media guide listed 71 {{nations as}} participating, but seven nations listed did not compete (Cameroon, Dominican Republic, Montenegro, Nigeria, South Korea, Togo and Uganda) while four nations who competed were not listed (Ghana, Kyrgyzstan, Senegal and <b>Tajikistan).</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{use of a}} {{specific}} alphabet generally corresponds with stages in history, with Arabic being used first, followed by Latin {{for a short period}} and then Cyrillic, which remains the most widely used alphabet in <b>Tajikistan.</b> The Bukhori dialect spoken by Bukharan Jews traditionally used the Hebrew alphabet but more often today is written using the Cyrillic variant.|$|E
5|$|Alexander viewed Bessus as a usurper {{and set out}} {{to defeat}} him. This campaign, {{initially}} against Bessus, turned into a grand tour of central Asia. Alexander founded a series of new cities, all called Alexandria, including modern Kandahar in Afghanistan, and Alexandria Eschate ("The Furthest") in modern <b>Tajikistan.</b> The campaign took Alexander through Media, Parthia, Aria (West Afghanistan), Drangiana, Arachosia (South and Central Afghanistan), Bactria (North and Central Afghanistan), and Scythia.|$|E
5|$|Ban Chao (d.AD 102) {{enlisted the}} aid of the Kushan Empire, occupying the area of modern India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and <b>Tajikistan,</b> to subdue Kashgar and its ally Sogdiana. When a request by Kushan ruler Vima Kadphises (r.c.90–c.100 AD) for a {{marriage}} alliance with the Han was rejected in AD 90, he sent his forces to Wakhan (Afghanistan) to attack Ban Chao. The conflict ended with the Kushans withdrawing because of lack of supplies. In AD 91, the office of Protector General of the Western Regions was reinstated when it was bestowed on Ban Chao.|$|E
5|$|Centuries {{before the}} conquest of Sogdiana by the Achaemenid Empire of Persia, Sogdiana possessed a Bronze Age urban culture that was {{gradually}} displaced by the Indo-European migrations of the Iron Age. This large-scale migration included Eastern Iranian speaking peoples such as the Sogdians. The original Bronze Age towns appear in the archaeological record beginning with the settlement at Sarazm, <b>Tajikistan,</b> spanning {{as far back as}} the 4th millennium BC and then at Kök Tepe, near modern-day Bulungur, Uzbekistan, from at least the 15th century BC.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Saleh {{was a member}} of the Northern Alliance (also known as the United Front) and was {{fighting}} against the Taliban expansion. In 1997, Saleh was appointed by Massoud to lead the United Front's international liaison office at the Embassy of Afghanistan in Dushanbe, <b>Tajikistan,</b> where he served as a coordinator for non-governmental (humanitarian) organizations and as a liaison partner for foreign intelligence agencies.|$|E
5|$|Railways {{transport}} {{goods from}} China to the European Union through Kazakhstan and Russia. The country has {{pushed for the}} construction of more railway lines to connect Berlin to east China to reduce shipping time. It proposed major high-speed railway lines going towards Europe via Russia and Kazakhstan and another through the Middle East via <b>Tajikistan,</b> a potential future member for the union. China has signed numerous energy deals with Russia and Kazakhstan, as it tries to move from coal to less pollutant alternatives.|$|E
5|$|Some golden jackals carry {{diseases}} and parasites harmful to human health. These include rabies, and Donovan's Leishmania that is harmless to jackals but may cause leishmaniasis in people. Jackals in southwestern <b>Tajikistan</b> can carry up to 16 species of parasitic cestodes (flatworm), roundworms, and acanthocephalans (thorny-headed worms), these being: Sparganum mansoni, Diphyllobothrium mansonoides, Taenia hydatigena, T.pisiformis, Taenia ovis, Hydatigera taeniaeformis, Dipylidium caninum, Mesocestoides lineatus, Ancylostoma caninum, Uncinaria stenocephala, Dioctophyma renale, Toxocara canis, Toxascaris leonina, Dracunculus medinensis, Filariata and Macracanthorhynchus catulinum. Jackals infected with Dracunculus medinensis can infect {{bodies of water}} with their eggs, which cause dracunculiasis in people who drink from them. Jackals may also play a large part in spreading coenurosis in sheep and cattle, and canine distemper in dogs. In <b>Tajikistan,</b> jackals carry at least 12 tick species (which include Ixodes, Rhipicephalus turanicus, R. leporis, R. rossicus, R. sanguineus, R. pumilio, R. schulzei, Hyalomma anatolicum, H. scupense and H. asiaticum), four flea species (Pulex irritans, Xenopsylla nesokiae, Ctenocephanlides canis and C. felis), and one species of louse (Trichodectes canis).|$|E
5|$|Zardari {{returned}} to Pakistan on 10 August. He {{first visit to}} an area affected by the flooding was in Sukkur on 12 August. He cancelled the 14 August Independence Day celebrations and instead visited Naushera. He flew over devastated areas with United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on 15 August. He left the country on 18 August and attended the four-way Russian summit at Sochi, which included <b>Tajikistan</b> and Afghanistan. On 19 August, he visited Jampur with U.S. Senator John Kerry. He ordered local authorities to concentrate efforts to save Shahdadkot from inundation on 24 August.|$|E
5|$|Athletes from 87 {{countries}} won medals, leaving 115 countries {{without a}} medal, and 54 of them won {{at least one}} gold medal. Both of these categories set new records until surpassed in 2016. Athletes from China won the most gold medals, with 48 gold medals. Athletes from the United States won the most total medals, with 111. Afghanistan, Mauritius, Sudan, <b>Tajikistan</b> and Togo won their first Olympic medals. Athletes from Mongolia (which previously held the record for most medals without a gold) and Panama won their first gold medals. Serbian swimmer Milorad Čavić won the first medal for the country as an independent NOC. Serbian athletes have previously won medals as nationals of Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro. Samoa won its first Olympic medal due to medals reallocation after 2016 wave of doping samples retesting.|$|E
5|$|Eighty-seven nations earned medals, 54 {{of which}} won gold medals, both setting new records for Olympic Games. 118 {{participating}} countries {{did not win}} a medal. Athletes from China won 48 gold medals, {{the most of any}} nation at these Olympics, becoming the first nation other than the United States and Russia (Soviet Union) to lead in medals since Germany at the 1936 Summer Olympics. The United States team won the most medals overall, with 111. Afghanistan, Mauritius, Sudan, <b>Tajikistan</b> and Togo won their first Olympic medals. Athletes from Mongolia (which previously held the record for most medals without a gold) and Panama won their nation's first gold medals. An athlete from Serbia won its first medal under that name, having previously won medals as part of Yugoslavia and Serbia and Montenegro.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{allegations}} were {{made that the}} government of Pakistan had shielded bin Laden. Critics cited the proximity of bin Laden's heavily fortified compound to the Pakistan Military Academy, that the U.S. chose to not notify Pakistani authorities before the operation, and the double standards of Pakistan regarding the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai attacks. U.S. government files, leaked by Wikileaks, disclosed that American diplomats had been told that Pakistani security services were tipping off bin Laden every time U.S. forces approached. Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), also helped smuggle al-Qaeda militants into Afghanistan to fight NATO troops. According to the leaked files, in December 2009, the government of <b>Tajikistan</b> had also told U.S. officials that many in Pakistan were aware of bin Laden's whereabouts.|$|E
5|$|The Yaghnobi {{people living}} in the Sughd {{province}} of <b>Tajikistan</b> still speak a dialect of the Sogdian language. Yaghnobi is largely a continuation of the medieval Sogdian dialect from the Osrushana region of the western Fergana Valley. The great majority of the Sogdian people assimilated with other local groups such as the Bactrians, Chorasmians, and in particular with Persians and came to speak Persian. In 819 the Persians founded the Samanid Empire in the region. They are among the ancestors of the modern Tajiks. Numerous Sogdian cognates {{can be found in the}} modern Tajik language, although the latter is a Western Iranian language.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} emblem of Belarus, which replaced the historic Pahonia {{arms in a}} 1995 referendum, features a ribbon in the colours of the national flag, a map of Belarus, wheat ears and a red star. It is {{sometimes referred to as}} the coat of arms of Belarus, although this is incorrect {{due to the lack of}} several heraldic elements. The emblem is an allusion to one that was used by the Belorussian SSR, designed by Ivan Dubasov in 1950, with the biggest change being a replacement of the hammer and sickle with an outline map of Belarus. Emblems reminiscent of the times of the Soviet Union are also used in Macedonia, <b>Tajikistan,</b> Uzbekistan and the region of Transnistria.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} wild {{ancestor of}} Malus pumila was Malus sieversii, found growing wild {{in the mountains}} of Central Asia in southern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, <b>Tajikistan,</b> and Xinjiang, China. Cultivation of the species, most likely beginning on the forested flanks of the Tian Shan mountains, progressed {{over a long period of}} time and permitted secondary introgression of genes from other species into the open-pollinated seeds. Significant exchange with Malus sylvestris, the crabapple, resulted in current populations of apples being more related to crabapples than to the more morphologically similar progenitor Malus sieversii. In strains without recent admixture the contribution of the latter predominates.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} {{sources of}} silver are the ores of copper, copper-nickel, lead, and lead-zinc obtained from Peru, Bolivia, Mexico, China, Australia, Chile, Poland and Serbia. Peru, Bolivia and Mexico have been mining silver since 1546, {{and are still}} major world producers. Top silver-producing mines are Cannington (Australia), Fresnillo (Mexico), San Cristóbal (Bolivia), Antamina (Peru), Rudna (Poland), and Penasquito (Mexico). Top near-term mine development projects through 2015 are Pascua Lama (Chile), Navidad (Argentina), Jaunicipio (Mexico), Malku Khota (Bolivia), and Hackett River (Canada). In Central Asia, <b>Tajikistan</b> {{is known to have}} some of the largest silver deposits in the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{sheer size}} of the newly conquered lands made it {{difficult}} to govern through the Tang military garrisons. The Tang emperor Gaozong appointed two puppet qaghans to rule over the Western Turks, who were later overthrown in a rebellion that began in 662. The revolt reduced Tang's western extent to Beshbalik, Dzungaria in northern Xinjiang and ended direct Tang control of Central Asia beyond the Pamir Mountains in modern <b>Tajikistan</b> and Afghanistan. The expansion of the Tibetan Empire from the south threatened China's hold on southern Xinjiang. Tibet invaded the Tarim Basin in 670, but Tang forces regained the area in 693 and Kashgar in 728, restoring the Anxi Protectorate and Four Garrisons. The conflict between Tibet and the Tang continued {{for the remainder of the}} Tang Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The tiger was {{historically}} widespread throughout eastern Eurasia, {{with the}} Pontic Caspian steppe, Eastern Turkey and Mesopotamia {{serving as the}} westernmost fringe of their range, and the coasts between eastern Siberia and the Indonesian islands of Java, Bali and Sumatra acting as the frontier to the Pacific Ocean. In between, tigers roamed what is today Armenia, Azerbaijan, Iran, Iraq, Georgia, southern Russia, Syria, Turkey and eastern Ukraine (as part of the Black Sea region), Afghanistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Nepal (comprising South Asia), Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, <b>Tajikistan,</b> Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan (composing Central Asia) China, Mongolia, North Korea, Siberia and South Korea (constituting East Asia) and South East Asia (Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam).|$|E
5|$|Uzbekistan remains {{hesitant}} {{to join the}} Economic Union, with Uzbek officials making opposing claims on the prospect of integration. The country prefers not to pursue economic and political integration as of now. Russian officials have stated that integration with {{the country would be}} slow and analysts state that as Russian influence and trade increases in Kyrgyzstan and <b>Tajikistan</b> it may persuade Uzbekistan to join in the future. Uzbekistan began its integration process when Russia announced it would write off USD$865 million off debt owed by the country. Uzbekistan joined the CIS Free Trade Area in 2014, meaning it has free trade with EEU member states.|$|E
5|$|After 649, the Tang Dynasty {{continued}} their {{war against the}} Western Turks under the reign of Emperor Gaozong, Taizong's successor. Gaozong conducted a campaign led by general Su Dingfang against the Western Turk qaghan, Ashina Helu in 657. The qaghan surrendered, the Western Turks were defeated, and the khaganate's former territories were annexed by the Tang. The Tang retreated from beyond the Pamir Mountains in modern <b>Tajikistan</b> and Afghanistan after a Turkic revolt in 662, and lost the Tarim Basin to local revolts and Tibetan incursions in 665-670. The Tang regained the Tarim Basin in 692 and again lost it to the Tibetans in the 790s, the Four Garrisons having already been {{cut off from the}} rest of the Tang empire by a Tibetan conquest of the Gansu Corridor. Although the Tibetan empire collapsed in the middle of the ninth century, the Tang Dynasty lacked the means to regain dominance in the Tarim Basin and itself ended in 907 with the abdication of Emperor Ai.|$|E
5|$|It took Đurić three {{personal}} attempts {{before he}} received his Singaporean citizenship on 27 September 2007 as he {{was not on the}} Football Association of Singapore's Foreign Sports Talent Scheme. Despite obtaining his Singapore passport for non-footballing reasons, coach Radojko Avramović called him up to the Singapore national team on 1 November 2007. He made his international debut at the age of 37 years and 89 days against <b>Tajikistan</b> in the first leg of {{the second round of the}} 2010 World Cup qualifiers on 9 November, contributing with an immediate impact by scoring both goals in a 2–0 victory. Đurić started the match following injuries to attacking midfielder Shi Jiayi and striker Indra Shahdan Daud. The result coupled with a 1–1 draw in the second leg meant that Singapore progressed to the third round of the Asian Qualifying Tournament for the first time, where they were drawn against Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and Uzbekistan. He continued his fine form on the international stage, scoring against Lebanon and Uzbekistan as Singapore finished third in Group 4.|$|E
5|$|The Afrasiab {{paintings}} of the 6th to 7th centuries in Samarkand, Uzbekistan offer a rare surviving example of Sogdian art. The paintings, showing scenes of daily life and {{events such as the}} arrival of foreign ambassadors, are located within the ruins of aristocratic homes. It is unclear if any of these palatial residences served as the official palace of the rulers of Samarkand. The oldest surviving Sogdian monumental wall murals date to the 5th century and are located at Panjakent, <b>Tajikistan.</b> In addition to revealing aspects of their social and political lives, Sogdian art has also been instrumental in aiding historians' understanding of their religious beliefs. For instance, it is clear that Buddhist Sogdians incorporated some of their own Persian deities into their version of the Buddhist Pantheon. At Zhetysu, Sogdian gilded bronze plaques on a Buddhist temple show a pairing of a male and female deity with outstretched hands holding a miniature camel, a common non-Buddhist image similarly found in the {{paintings of}} Samarkand and Panjakent.|$|E
5|$|The first awards {{were given}} in 1991 to American photo{{journalist}} Bill Foley and his wife, journalist Cary Vaughan; Cameroonian reporter Pius Njawé; Chinese dissidents Wang Juntao and Chen Ziming; Russian television news anchor Tatyana Mitkova; and Guatemalan reporter Byron Barrera. In 2014, the organization awarded its twenty-fourth group of journalists. On three occasions, an award was also {{given to a}} news organization of which multiple staffers have been at risk: <b>Tajikistan</b> newspaper Navidi Vakhsh (1994), several reporters of which murdered during the 1992–97 civil war; Guatemalan newspaper Siglo Veintiuno (1995), which was subject to police and army raids for its uncensored coverage of government corruption and human rights violations; and Turkish newspaper Özgür Gündem (1996), which was subject to a campaign of publication bans, assassinations, and arrests for its reporting on {{the conflict between the}} Turkish Armed Forces and the Kurdistan Workers' Party.|$|E
5|$|The jackal moults twice a year, {{in spring}} and in autumn. In Transcaucasia and <b>Tajikistan,</b> the spring moult begins {{at the end of}} winter. If the winter has been warm, the spring moult starts in the middle of February; if the winter has been cold, it begins in the middle of March. The spring moult lasts for 60–65 days; if the animal is sick, it loses only half of its winter fur. The spring moult commences with the head and limbs, extends to the flanks, chest, belly and rump, and ends at the tail. Fur on the underparts is absent. The autumn moult occurs from mid-September with the growth of winter fur; the {{shedding}} of the summer fur occurs at the same time. The development of the autumn coat starts with the rump and tail and spreads to the back, flanks, belly, chest, limbs and head, with full winter fur being attained at the end of November.|$|E
5|$|The victory {{strengthened}} Tang {{control of}} the Western Regions, now modern Xinjiang, and brought the regions formerly ruled by the Khaganate into the Tang empire. Puppet qaghans, the Turkic title for ruler, and military garrisons were installed to administer the newly acquired territories. The Tang Dynasty achieved its maximum extent as China's western borders reached the eastern frontier of the Arabic Umayyad Caliphate. Later on, Turkic revolts ended Chinese hegemony beyond the Pamir Mountains in modern <b>Tajikistan</b> and Afghanistan, but a Tang military presence remained in Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin. Central Asia absorbed cultural influences from the conflict. Turkic culture and language spread into Central Asia, as did artistic and political influences from the Tang Dynasty. Many of the Tang generals and soldiers stationed in the region were ethnically Turkic, and the prevalence of Indo-European languages in Central Asia declined with acceleration of Turkic migration. The Turks, Tibetans, and the Tang competed for control over Central Asia {{for the next few}} centuries.|$|E
