5|$|As La Dispute have {{promoted}} {{their music}} on headline tours <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> create a play different songs {{and create a}} different experience for each live show. They have also used songs after {{a certain period of}} time: an example is 'King Park', which although was initially considered too emotionally draining for live performances, the band eventually started to play the song live. The band played 'St Paul Missionary Baptist Church Blues' from Wildlife at its first performance in September 2012.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the band}} have been labeled emo, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> avoid writing in that fashion. Grand Unification and One Day Son, This Will All Be Yours themes were apocalyptic, and {{subsequent}} work varied from patriotism ("The English Way") to self-loathing ("Damocles" [...] and [...] "Animal"). Fightstar {{have been influenced}} by author Chuck Palahniuk, films and comics such as the Neon Genesis Evangelion series.|$|E

"All cricket {{writers of}} {{the last half century}} have been {{influenced}} by Cardus, whether they admit it or not, whether they have wished to be or not, whether <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> copy him or tried to avoid copying him. He was not a model, any more than Macaulay, say, was a model for the aspiring historian. But just as Macaulay changed the course of the writing of history, Cardus changed the course of the writing of cricket. He showed what could be done. He dignified and illuminated the craft".|$|E

2500|$|In 1910, as the American Craftsman {{movement}} {{was in full}} bloom in Southern California, Grey wrote that California architecture was distinctive because local architects were simply trying to be [...] "natural"—not so much [...] "because our architects have striven to be unique in their designing as because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> eliminate features not belonging to this climate and to local conditions." [...] Grey also emphasized simplicity, once writing that [...] "the greatest fault {{that can be found}} with the architecture of Southern California is that which may be found with all American architecture {{to a greater or lesser}} extent, namely, a lack of simplicity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{most people}} have labeled Calle 13's music as reggaeton, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> {{distance}} themselves from the style. Indeed, Residente once admitted the group played reggaeton in their first album as way of gaining some initial popularity more easily, while assuring that the group has nothing against the genre. Visitante, being a professional musician, tries to fuse diverse styles in the group's songs. Early cuts featured elements from jazz, bossa nova and salsa, while recent songs feature cumbia, tango, electronica and others. In their recent tours around Latin America they have added different musical elements according to the place the band is playing in, yet many of their songs carry the traditional reggaeton [...] "Dem Bow" [...] beat such as in their hit [...] "Tango del Pecado" [...] and the remix to [...] "Suave".|$|E

Radke stated in an interview, [...] "They make a whole album called This War Is Ours, and then they try to say, 'We didn't name that album after you, dude.' Which in fact, they did. I could be wrong; they could {{be talking about the}} war on terrorism or something. I don't know. But I just have a feeling that record name was about me. They talk a lot of shit. It is always about forgive and forget, but there's some things that I would like to say. So I did. On the record." ...|$|E

Never in the history of Rajasthan such a heinous incident has happened and this is not an attack on the state but on the nation". She also added, [...] "there are some slender leads on which the state agencies are working and its difficult to name any terror outfit at present". The Chief Minister also laid emphasis on a new anti-terror legislation either similar to POTA or to the one in the neighbouring state of Gujarat. She also criticised the President of India for not signing an anti-terror bill passed by the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly in 2006. Raje also expressed her concern that the terrorist attacks in Jaipur will negatively affect the tourism industry there. The Chief Minister also said that Rajasthan will have its own anti-terror force and also proposed a joint task force between Indian states.|$|E
2500|$|Though it is {{difficult}} to sum up almost five centuries of evolution and differentiation among the Anabaptists, five distinctive attributes of Anabaptist Christians can be discerned: Firstly, they do not practice infant baptism – they believe it is important for someone to be old enough to make a mature choice about whether to be baptized and to be a church member. Secondly, Anabaptists have put special emphasis on the New Testament’s teachings on nonviolence and peacemaking. They also have stressed simple, non-materialistic lifestyles, and communities based on service to others or “works of love.” Finally, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> put their understandings of Jesus' teachings into daily practice. As explained by Menno Simons, the 16th-century leader from whom the term “Mennonite” comes: “True evangelical faith cannot lie dormant. It clothes the naked, it feeds the hungry, it comforts the sorrowful, it shelters the destitute and it serves those who harm it. It seeks those who are lost. It binds up what is wounded. It becomes all things to all people.” ...|$|E

They have wanted to prosecute me in order to take as much money as possible from me. They have wanted to ruin me. They have wanted to convince Ecuadorians that I am just one more heir, however what I own, I have through my own labors of more than 40 years. [...] They have wanted to accuse me be unfair economically to my siblings when those family members are all very well off and I have never affected them. They have wanted to damage my image with slander of all kinds. [...] They have attacked my sense of honor. [...] " ...|$|E

6000|$|Admiral West, {{with part of}} the fleet, {{happened}} to be {{at that time in}} Plymouth Sound. He at once sent a sloop with a fire-engine to the rock. They attempted to land in a boat, but could not. So violent was the surf, that the boat was at one time thrown bodily upon the rock by one wave and swept off again by the next. The escape on this occasion was almost miraculous, the men therefore did not venture to make another attempt, but contented themselves with endeavouring to work the engine from the boat, in doing which they broke it, and thus all hope of doing anything further was gone. But indeed the engine they had would have availed nothing, even though it had been twice as powerful, against such a mighty conflagration.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to study display rules and emotional suppression in an employment interview. Participants, 74 graduating university students, were told that their videotaped performance in a simulated job interview would be evaluated by personnel experts. In a post-interview questionnaire, participants were asked about the display rules influencing their behavior in the interview. They were also asked whether <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> suppress or hide (negative) emotions during the interview. More men than women stated that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> hide or suppress their feelings; these participants were classified as (emotion) suppressors. Participants who stated that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> not <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> hide or suppress their feelings during the interview were classified as nonsuppressors. The validity of self-reported suppression was supported by the external evaluations of two judges, who observed less nonverbal expressiveness (hand to head movements) in suppressors of both sexes and less anxiety in female suppressors. Suppressors were evaluated as more competent than nonsuppressors. In women, but not in men, emotional suppression was associated with increased self-reports of depressed state in the post-interview questionnaire...|$|R
