5|$|Couillard first {{appeared}} in <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>media</b> when she dated the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Maxime Bernier. The Bernier-Couillard Affair erupted in May 2008 over confidential, NATO-related documents left at Couillard's house. Media coverage, and Bernier's reaction, left Couillard feeling victimized. To help dispel rumours regarding her life and her role with Bernier, Couillard signed a book deal.|$|E

5|$|In 2007 Hareide {{announced}} that he had left politics for the time being to pursue a career in <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>media</b> conglomerate Schibsted, as an organizational director. His career in the company started with the position of trainee in 1997. Outside politics, his only paid full-time appointments have been in Schibsted. He still works behind the scenes for his party, occasionally commenting on issues in <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>media.</b> He did not rule out a return to national politics in the future, and in late 2008 he was selected by his party as the top candidate on the party's ticket in Akershus county. The Christian Democratic Party formerly held a seat in this county, but lost it in 2005. Hareide has never lived in Akershus. Party leader Dagfinn Høybråten hails from Akershus, but he runs on the Rogaland ticket to secure a safe seat.|$|E

5|$|Cal Neva Resort & Casino, {{previously}} {{known as}} the Calneva Resort, Cal-Neva Lodge, is a resort and casino straddling the border between Nevada and California {{on the shores of}} Lake Tahoe. The original building was constructed in 1926, and became famous when <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>media</b> picked up a story about actress Clara Bow cancelling checks she owed to the Cal Neva worth $13,000 in 1930. After a fire, the building burnt down in 1937 and was rebuilt over the course of 30 days. In 1960, entertainer Frank Sinatra purchased the Resort alongside Dean Martin and Chicago mobster Sam Giancana.|$|E

5|$|Although O'Malley was {{loyal to}} his {{employees}}, {{he did not}} take kindly to demands from employees such as manager Charlie Dressen's request for a three-year contract. When Dressen requested a multi-year contract after losing a second consecutive World Series to the Yankees, he was released. Then when he hired Walter Alston as a replacement, he made it clear to the press that Alston would only receive one-year contracts and would not attempt to show up the management in <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>media.</b> There were rumors that Alston even signed blank contracts in the fall and showed up in the spring to find out his salary. O'Malley also did not support those who remained friends with Rickey, which was a large factor in Red Barber quitting as Dodgers announcer.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>media</b> began {{to report the}} extreme wealth of some Texans in {{magazines}} such as Life and Fortune. A stereotype emerged of the nouveau-riche Texas oil millionaire, popularized by the media. The popular image was often characterized by a rough and combative personality, heavy drinking, and extravagant spending. In 1956, the motion picture Giant helped to crystallize the image of Texans in the popular imagination as comical, eccentric figures. Glenn McCarthy was {{the inspiration for the}} character of Jett Rink in the film. Other films such as Boom Town and War of the Wildcats, and books such as The Lusty Texans of Dallas and Houston: Land of the Big Rich, also contributed to public perceptions of oil's influence in Texas and surrounding states.|$|E

5|$|In December 2010, he {{was made}} joint {{caretaker}} manager at Vale, along with Mark Grew, following the departure of Adams. Vale were beaten 5–0 by Rotherham United {{in his first game}} in charge, but rallied to beat Burton Albion 2–1, before Jim Gannon was appointed manager. Gannon retained Horsfield as his assistant. On the way to a match at Aldershot on 25 February, Gannon left the team bus after an apparent bust-up with Horsfield. <b>The</b> <b>national</b> <b>media</b> reported that Gannon granted Horsfield's request for a day off for family reasons but then wrote to the board complaining about his conduct. Having been shown the letter by a director, Horsfield confronted Gannon over the issue. After an internal inquiry, during which Horsfield stayed away from the club, no disciplinary action was taken against either party. Gannon was sacked on 21 March, and Grew was appointed as caretaker-manager with Horsfield as his assistant.|$|E
5|$|Michigan enjoyed high {{expectations}} from <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>media</b> as well during the preseason. Sporting News named {{them to the}} number 5 position in its preseason poll, while conference foes Indiana and Ohio State were ranked number 1 and 3, respectively. Michigan also earned the number 5 ranking in both the preseason Coaches' Poll and preseason Associated Press poll, but behind Indiana (#1) and Ohio State (#4) in both. This was Michigan's highest preseason ranking since the 1992–93 team. Sports Illustrated ranked Michigan number 9 in its October preseason power rankings, again behind Indiana (#1) and Ohio State (#6), but when it printed its November preseason poll listed Michigan at number 6 ahead of Ohio State (#7), but behind Indiana (#1). Prior to the first exhibition game on November 1, senior Josh Bartelstein was named team captain.|$|E
5|$|On August 29, 2008, McCain {{revealed}} Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as {{his surprise}} choice for running mate. McCain {{was only the}} second U.S. major-party presidential nominee (after Walter Mondale) to select a woman for his running mate and the first Republican to do so; Palin would have become the first female Vice President of the United States if McCain had been elected. On September 3, 2008, McCain and Palin became the Republican Party's presidential and vice presidential nominees, respectively, at the 2008 Republican National Convention in Saint Paul, Minnesota. McCain surged ahead of Obama in national polls following the convention, as the Palin pick energized core Republican voters who had previously been wary of him. However, by the campaign's own later admission, the rollout of Palin to <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>media</b> went poorly, and voter reactions to Palin grew increasingly negative, especially among independents and other voters concerned about her qualifications.|$|E

5|$|On October 18, 2006, the Department of Homeland Security warned National Football League {{officials}} in Miami, New York City, Atlanta, Seattle, Houston, Oakland, and Cleveland {{about a possible}} threat involving the simultaneous use of dirty bombs at stadiums. The threat claimed that the attack would be carried out on October 22, {{the final day of}} the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Both the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security expressed doubt concerning the credibility of the threats, but warned the relevant organizations as a precaution. The games proceeded as planned but under a higher level of security awareness. The threats came to light in <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>media</b> after Jake Brahm admitted to having posted the threats on 4chan and repeating them on other websites approximately 40 times.|$|E
5|$|In the 1995–96 season, Nash began {{attracting}} {{the attention of}} <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>media</b> and professional scouts. He had spent the summer before that honing his skills, playing with the Canadian national team and working out {{with the likes of}} established NBA players Jason Kidd and Gary Payton. Santa Clara again captured the WCC title, and for the second consecutive year, Nash was named Conference Player of the Year, the first Bronco to do so since Kurt Rambis. He scored 28 points in leading the No. 10 seed Broncos to a first round upset win over No. 7 seed Maryland, but then the Broncos were eliminated by Kansas. Nash's performances ensured that he earned an honourable mention All-America as a senior by The Associated Press and the USBWA. He also finished his career as Santa Clara's all-time leader in career assists (510), free-throw percentage (.862), and made and attempted three-pointers (263–656). He remains third on the school's all-time scoring list (1,689), and holds Santa Clara's single-season free-throw percentage record (.894). In September 2006, Nash had his jersey (#11) retired, becoming the first Santa Clara student-athlete to receive that honour.|$|E
5|$|James played {{high school}} {{basketball}} at St. Vincent–St. Mary High School {{in his hometown of}} Akron, Ohio, where he was highly promoted in <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>media</b> as a future NBA superstar. After graduating, he was selected by his home team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. James led Cleveland to the franchise's first Finals appearance in 2007, ultimately losing to the San Antonio Spurs. In 2010, he left the Cavaliers for the Miami Heat in a highly publicized ESPN special titled The Decision. James spent four seasons with the Heat, reaching the Finals all four years and winning back-to-back championships in 2012 and 2013.
