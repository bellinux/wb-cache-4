5|$|A {{mirror on}} the back wall {{reflects}} the upper bodies and heads of two figures identified from other paintings, and by Palomino, as King PhilipIV(10) and Queen Mariana(11).

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} estimating <b>the</b> <b>poses</b> of a reference plane in specular shape recovery. Unlike existing methods which require an extra mirror or an extra reference plane and camera, our proposed method recovers <b>the</b> <b>poses</b> of <b>the</b> reference plane directly from its reflections on the specular surface. By establishing reflection correspondences on the reference plane in three distinct poses, our method estimates <b>the</b> <b>poses</b> of <b>the</b> reference plane in two steps. First, by applying a colinearity constraint to the reflection correspondences, a simple closed-form solution is derived for recovering <b>the</b> <b>poses</b> of <b>the</b> reference plane relative to its initial pose. Second, by applying a ray incidence constraint to the incident rays formed by the reflection correspondences and the visual rays cast from the image, a closed-form solution is derived for recovering <b>the</b> <b>poses</b> of <b>the</b> reference plane relative to the camera. The shape of the specular surface then follows. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data are presented, which demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our proposed method. © 2011 IEEE. published_or_final_versionThe 2011 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), Barcelona, Spain, 6 - 13 November 2011.

5|$|Daksinakaali is {{typically}} shown {{with her right}} foot on Shiva's chest—while depictions showing Kaali with her left foot on Shiva's chest depict the even more fearsome Vamakaali. <b>The</b> <b>pose</b> shows the conclusion of an episode in which Kaali was rampaging out of control after destroying many demons. Shiva, fearing that Kaali would not stop until she destroyed the world, could only think of one way to pacify her. He {{lay down on the}} battlefield so {{that she would have to}} step on him. Seeing her consort under her foot, Kaali realized that she had gone too far, and calmed down. In some interpretations of the story, Shiva was attempting to receive Kaali's grace by receiving her foot on his chest.|$|E
5|$|Velázquez's {{portrait}} is {{a staging}} {{of a private}} moment of intimacy and a dramatic departure from the classical depictions of sleep and intimacy found in works from antiquity and Venetian art that portray Venus. However, the simplicity with which Velázquez displays the female nude—without jewellery {{or any of the}} goddess's usual accessories—was echoed in later nude studies by Ingres, Manet, and Baudry, among others. In addition, Velázquez's depiction of Venus as a reclining nude viewed from the rear was a rarity before that time, although <b>the</b> <b>pose</b> has been painted by many later artists. Manet, in his stark female portrayal Olympia, paraphrased the Rokeby Venus in pose and by suggesting the persona of a real woman rather than an ethereal goddess. Olympia shocked the Parisian art world when it was first exhibited in 1863. Olympia gazes directly out at the viewer, as does Velázquez's Venus, only through the reflection of the mirror.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} novel {{methods for}} estimating <b>the</b> <b>poses</b> of a reference plane from its reflections for specular surface recovery. Traditional methods for specular surface recovery usually introduce a second camera and an auxiliary calibration pattern to calibrate <b>the</b> <b>poses</b> of <b>the</b> reference plane {{with respect to}} the camera. The calibration procedures are comparatively tedious. Auto-estimating <b>the</b> <b>poses</b> of <b>the</b> reference plane is therefore an appealing problem. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, two novel and practical methods are proposed to recover <b>the</b> <b>poses</b> of a moving reference plane from its reflections produced on the specular surface given its initial position. As for the first approach, the reference plane is constrained to undergo an unknown pure translation. By observing the reflections of the moving reference plane produced on the specular surface, a closed form solution is derived for recovering the unknown translation. Degenerate cases in which the proposed method fails are studied. As for the second approach, the constraint on the motion of the reference plane is removed, and the reference plane can move freely. Again, a closed form solution is derived for the unknown motion defined by a rotation matrix and a translation vector, and the degenerate cases are also presented. The thesis finally considers the problem for auto-calibrating the reference plane against the camera for specular surface recovery without prior knowledge of the reference plane’s initial position. By only observing its reflections produced on the specular surface, <b>the</b> <b>poses</b> of <b>the</b> reference planes can be recovered in two steps. First, by applying a collinearity constraint to the specular correspondences, a simple closed form solution is derived for recovering <b>the</b> <b>poses</b> of <b>the</b> reference plane relative to its initial pose. Second, by applying a ray incidence constraint to the incident rays formed by the specular correspondences and the visual rays cast from the image, a closed form solution is derived for recovering <b>the</b> <b>poses</b> of <b>the</b> reference plane relative to the camera. The shape of the specular surface then follows. published_or_final_versionComputer ScienceDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
