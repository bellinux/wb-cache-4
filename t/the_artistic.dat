5|$|Agrippa was {{extremely}} influential—as a sigil for <b>the</b> <b>artistic</b> community {{to appreciate the}} potential of electronic media—for {{the extent to which}} it entered public consciousness.

Agrippa was also used as the key of a book cipher in the Cicada 3301 mystery.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of his death, his {{reputation}} and fame were waning, and his passing was little noticed within <b>the</b> <b>artistic</b> community. His artwork had certainly been acknowledged during his lifetime, but not widely.

By 1838, his work no longer sold or received attention from critics; the Romantic movement had been moving away from the early idealism that the artist had helped found.|$|E
