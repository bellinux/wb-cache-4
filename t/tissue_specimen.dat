40|$|BACKGROUND. The endothelin axis {{has been}} implicated in cancer growth, angiogenesis, and metastasis, but to the authors 2 ̆ 7 {{knowledge}} the expression of endothelin genes has not been defined in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). METHODS. <b>Tissue</b> <b>specimens</b> were harvested from both normal and tumor-affected regions {{at the time of}} radical nephrectomy from 35 patients with RCC (22 with clear cell RCC [ccRCC] and 13 with papillary RCC [PRCC]). Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis determined the expression profile of the preproendothelins (PPET- 1, PPET- 2, and PPET- 3), the endothelin receptors (ETA and ETB), and the endothelin-converting enzymes (ECE- 1 and ECE- 2). RESULTS. PPET- 1 was found to be up-regulated in ccRCC tumor specimens and down-regulated in PRCC tumor specimens. ETA was significantly down-regulated in PRCC tumor specimens. ECE- 1 was expressed in all <b>tissue</b> <b>specimens</b> at comparable levels, with moderate but significant elevation in normal <b>tissue</b> <b>specimens</b> associated with PRCC. Of the other genes, PPET- 2 and ETB were expressed in all <b>tissue</b> <b>specimens</b> and no differences were observed between tumor subtypes or tumor-affected and normal <b>tissue</b> <b>specimens,</b> whereas PPET- 3 and ECE- 2 were present in all <b>tissue</b> <b>specimens</b> but were barely detectable. CONCLUSIONS. The endothelin axis was expressed differently in the two main subtypes of RCC and appeared to match macroscopic features commonly observed in these tumors (i. e., high expression of PPET-I in hypervascular ccRCC contrasted against low PPET- 1 and ETA expression in hypovascular PRCC). The presence of ECE- 1 mRNA in these <b>tissue</b> <b>specimens</b> suggested that active endothelin ligands were present, indicating endothelin axis activity was elevated in ccRCC compared with normal kidney, but impaired in PRCC. The current study provided further evidence that it is not appropriate to consider ccRCC and PRCC indiscriminately in regard to treatment. (C) 2004 American Cancer Society...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{breast cancer}} {{resistance}} protein (BCRP) is a recently characterized xenobiotic half‑transporter protein {{that acts as}} an energy‑dependent efflux pump and {{may be associated with}} the multidrug‑resistant phenotype. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the association between BCRP expression and 5 ‑fluorouracil (5 ‑FU) resistance in clinical breast cancer <b>tissue</b> <b>specimens.</b> The BCRP expres-sion was investigated using quantitative reverse‑transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT‑PCR) by use of the Master SYBR-Green I reagent and immunohistochemistry (IHC) by use of the BXP‑ 21 anti‑BCRP monoclonal antibody in clinical breast cancer <b>tissue</b> <b>specimens.</b> Chemosensitivity to 5 ‑FU for BCRP‑positive clinical breast cancer <b>tissue</b> <b>specimens</b> was colorimetrically assessed with the cytotoxicity assay through methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) reduction.

The fold resistance to 5 ‑FU was 7 ‑ 12 compared to sensitivity to pacli-taxel as determined by the colorimetric assay through MTT reduction in the 37 specimens.

50|$|Although tissue {{embedding}} is not necessary, it {{is highly}} recommended that very small and soft specimens be embedded in agar or agarose. Embedding the tissue {{has no effect on}} the tissue itself, and agar or agarose embedding can be used for both live and fixed tissues. This process is very similar to the Compresstome vibratome procedures. One commonly encountered problem with the Leica vibratome is that the cutting knife pushes away the specimen which results in shearing or tearing of tissue. An agar block can be glued below the <b>tissue</b> <b>specimen</b> in an attempt to overcome this obstacle.|$|E
5000|$|A {{variation}} on the vibrating microtome is the Compresstome microtome, which is designed and made by Precisionary Instruments. The Compresstome uses a specimen syringe or [...] "lipstick-like" [...] tube to hold the tissue. The <b>tissue</b> <b>specimen</b> is completely embedded in agarose, and the tissue is slowly and gently pressed out of the tube for the vibrating blade to cut. The device operates in the following way: {{the end of the}} specimen tube where the tissue emerges is slightly narrower than the loading end, which allows gentle [...] "compression" [...] of the tissue as it comes out of the tube. The slight compression prevents shearing, uneven cutting, and vibration artifacts from forming. Note that the compression technology does not damage or affect the tissue being sectioned.|$|E
50|$|The chronaxie {{values for}} {{mammalian}} ventricles at body temperature range from 0.5 ms (human) to 2.0 to 4.1 ms (dog); {{this is an}} 8.2/1 ratio. It {{has been reported that}} large-diameter myelinated axons havechronaxie times ranging from 50 to 100 µs and 30 to 200 µs, and neuronal cell bodies and dendrites have chronaxie times ranging from 1 to 10 ms or even up to 30 ms. The chronaxietimes of grey matter were reported asbeing 380 +/- 191 ms and 200±700 ms. Interpretations ofchronaxie times are further confounded by additional factors. Thechronaxie times reported for soma and dendrites have been establishedusing intracellular pulses that cannot be readily extrapolated to extra-cellular stimuli. Datareported in the literature use either motor response as the physiologicalthreshold in humans or action potential generation in animals. Theseare largely based on stimulation through a macro-electrode, which inthe case of humans is a 1.5 Â 1.2-mm DBS electrode. Data derived from micro-electrodestimulation and physiological mapping of sensory thalamus are scarce.The two stimulation methods may result in significantly differentresults. Few studies have attempted to correlatechronaxie times with sensory perception, although understandingthe neural elements that are involved in a subjective percept, suchas tingling, has important physiological implications.The measurements were taken with different types of electrodes and with stimulators having unknown output impedances. The chronaxie values for human arm sensory nerves rangefrom 0.35 to 1.17 ms, a ratio of 3.3. The values were obtained with insufficient information to establishthe cause of variability. The chronaxie values for human denervated skeletal muscle ranges from 9.5 to 30 ms at body temperature, representing aratio of 3.16. A reduction in chronaxie occurs during reinnervation. The published values for chronaxie have a wide range. If chronaxie is the best descriptor of tissueexcitability in a homogeneous <b>tissue</b> <b>specimen,</b> at a known temperature, it should be determined with a constant-current stimulator providing a rectangular cathodal stimulus waveform.Chronaxie is derived from the strength-duration curve for current and it shows that if the stimulus duration is shorter than chronaxie, more current is required to stimulate,with any type or location of electrodes with a stimulator of any known or unknown output impedance.In addition, the chronaxie value, however determined, identifies the pulse duration for minimum energy. In addition,the charge delivered at chronaxie, however determined, is 2, twice the minimum charge. Therefore, if minimum charge delivery is sought to prolong the life of a battery in an implantedstimulator, a pulse duration of less than the measured chronaxie should be selected; a duration of one-tenth chronaxie providesa charge that is only 10% above the minimum charge.|$|E

METHODS: Paraffin-embedded <b>tissue</b> <b>specimens</b> from Ugandan patients with KS and non-KS tumor control patients attending a university-based oncology clinic were examined in a blinded case-control study. <b>Tissue</b> DNA <b>specimens</b> were examined for detectable KSHV genome by nested polymerase chain reaction performed at two independent laboratories.
