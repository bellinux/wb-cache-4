5|$|In {{the third}} session on Saturday, Sebastian Vettel set the fastest time, at 1:07.098, {{a little over}} a <b>tenth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second ahead of his {{teammate}} Räikkönen. Rosberg had the slowest time of the session, as he crashed out when his suspension broke after going over the kerbs at turn 2. His accident caused a ten-minute red flag period. His teammate Hamilton was third fastest, albeit running wide at turn 8 on one of his laps. Ricciardo was fourth fastest, half a second down on Vettel and one <b>tenth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second ahead of teammate Verstappen in fifth. Fernando Alonso, who lost parts of his bodywork when running over the kerbs late in the session, was tenth fastest, 1.2 seconds behind Vettel. Due to his crash, Mercedes had to change the gearbox on Rosberg's car, handing him a five-place grid penalty.|$|E

Nico Rosberg was second, about a <b>tenth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second behind, but did not set any timed laps in the last twenty minutes as his car was losing gearbox oil. Lewis Hamilton meanwhile struggled on the super-soft tyres, making several errors that left him fifth. Both Lotus cars {{made it into the}} top ten, with Pastor Maldonado and Romain Grosjean in fourth and seventh respectively.

Along with several others barns it was used to collect the tithes or dues to the abbey, often one <b>tenth</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> farm's produce.
