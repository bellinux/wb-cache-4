5|$|Deimatic {{displays}} {{are made}} by insects including the praying mantises (Mantidae) and stick insects (Phasmatodea). While undisturbed, these insects are usually well camouflaged. When disturbed by a potential predator, <b>they</b> <b>suddenly</b> reveal their hind wings, which are brightly coloured. In mantises, the wing display is sometimes reinforced by showing brightly coloured front legs, and accompanied by a loud hissing sound created by stridulation. For example, the grasshopper Phymateus displays red and yellow areas on its hind wings; it is also aposematic, producing a distasteful secretion from its thorax. Similarly the threat display of the walking stick phasmid (Peruphasma schultei) is not a bluff: the insect sprays defensive dolichodial-like monoterpene chemical compounds at attackers.|$|E
5|$|Mehmed II ordered Hadım Suleiman Pasha, Beylerbey (or governor) of Rumelia, {{to invade}} Moldavia – an Ottoman army of about 120,000 strong broke into Moldavia in late 1475. Wallachian troops also joined the Ottomans, while Stephen {{received}} support from Poland and Hungary. Outnumbered {{three to one}} by the invaders, Stephen was forced to retreat. He joined battle with Hadım Suleiman Pasha at Podul Înalt (or the High Bridge) near Vaslui on 10 January 1475. Before the battle, he had sent his buglers to hide behind the enemy fronts. When <b>they</b> <b>suddenly</b> sounded their horns, they caused such a panic among the invaders that they fled from the battlefield. Over the next three days, hundreds of Ottoman soldiers were massacred and the survivors retreated from Moldavia.|$|E
5|$|Following this disaster, Sayf al-Dawla {{needed time}} to recover his strength, {{but as soon as}} Nikephoros Phokas {{returned}} victorious from Crete in summer 961, he resumed the offensive in the east. The Byzantines captured Anazarbus in Cilicia, and followed a deliberate policy of devastation and massacre to drive the Muslim population away. Sayf al-Dawla's attempts to halt the Byzantine advance in Cilicia failed, and Nikephoros Phokas, with an army reportedly 70,000 strong, took Marash, Sisium, Duluk and Manbij, securing the western passes over the Anti-Taurus Mountains. Sayf al-Dawla sent his army north under Nadja to meet the Byzantines, but Nikephoros ignored them. Instead, the Byzantine general led his troops south and in mid-December, <b>they</b> <b>suddenly</b> appeared before Aleppo. There they defeated an improvised army before the city walls. The Byzantines stormed the city and plundered it, except for the citadel, which continued to hold out. The Byzantines departed in early 963, taking much of the populace with them as captives.|$|E

5|$|Rosebeary, flying Cobra Blue Ghost 28, {{called a}} Mayday but {{was able to}} safely exit the area and landed his {{severely}} damaged helicopter. His aircraft was totaled. He and Gunner Warrant Officer Charles Gorski were {{picked up by a}} HH-53C helicopter (Jolly Green 67), without incident. Rosebeary warned other aircraft against crossing the river. When Morse in Sandy 07 learned that the quick-snatch had failed, he and his wingman Sandy 08 broke off engaging the North Vietnamese and returned to Da Nang. Both Sandys were found to be so damaged they would take several days to repair. At 9:00p.m., Nail 59, {{a new version of the}} OV-10A Bronco aircraft equipped with the Pave Nail LORAN radar piloted by Gary Ferentchak, took over FAC duties. The SAR efforts were suspended for the night and the U.S. and ARVN forces remained unaware of the true strength of the NVA offensive. Advised by the FAC to remain in place, Hambleton moved to a safer spot in the jungle and dug a hole to hide in until morning. During the night, Nail 59 and King 27, an HC-130 commanded by Maj. Dennis Constant, stayed. <b>They</b> <b>suddenly</b> found themselves painted by Fan Song radar and narrowly missed getting shot down as well. At 53 years old, Hambleton was not a prime candidate to survive the cold, wet weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor and Donna, {{neither one}} {{aware of the}} other's involvement, both {{investigate}} Adipose Industries, which is marketing a special diet pill {{to the people of}} London. They find that the pill's slogan, The Fat Just Walks Away, is literal. The pills use latent body fat to parthenogenetically create small white aliens called Adipose that spawn at night and leave the host's body. The Doctor and Donna separately infiltrate the offices of Adipose Industries, each unaware that the other is there. Donna hides out in a toilet cubicle until they close, the Doctor stays in a storage room. As they explore the building, <b>they</b> <b>suddenly</b> encounter each other through opposite windows in an office. They are confronted by Miss Foster, an alien who is using Britain's overweight population to create the Adipose babies for the Adiposian First Family. Miss Foster pursues the Doctor and Donna around the building, finally catching them in an office. She tells the Doctor that the Adipose lost their breeding planet and hired Miss Foster to find a replacement. The Doctor uses Miss Foster's sonic pen and his sonic screwdriver to create a diversion and escape.|$|E
25|$|From {{the mid-1960s}} to the mid-1970s there were 65 Moon {{landings}} (with 10 in 1971 alone), but after Luna 24 in 1976 <b>they</b> <b>suddenly</b> stopped. The Soviet Union started focusing on Venus and space stations and the U.S. on Mars and beyond, {{and on the}} Skylab and Space Shuttle programs.|$|E

25|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the unusually great height of the corn, the French line of skirmishers, strengthened by whole battalions so as to give then a decided superiority over that of the Prussians, approached so cautiously and silently as to continue unperceived until <b>they</b> <b>suddenly</b> possessed themselves of the outermost hedges and gardens.|$|E
25|$|Mangammal had {{frequent}} troubles {{from the}} time of her regency with Maratha King Shaji of Thanjavur. In the following year the Madurai forces under Dalavoy Narasappiah crushingly defeated the Tanjore Marathas near their capital, when <b>they</b> <b>suddenly</b> stormed into their capital. The disheartened King Shaji of Tanjore was only glad enough to buy off the invading army with an enormous bribe, after almost emptying his treasury.|$|E

As a result, Jokerit had a near-perfect season and advanced {{all the way to}} the SM-Liiga finals, where they were comprehensively beaten by local rival HIFK.|$|E
25|$|Losing {{the war and}} the 13 colonies was a {{shock to}} Britain. The war {{revealed}} the limitations of Britain's fiscal-military state when they discovered that <b>they</b> <b>suddenly</b> faced powerful enemies with no allies, and they were dependent on extended and vulnerable transatlantic lines of communication. The defeat heightened dissension and escalated political antagonism to the King's ministers. Inside parliament, the primary concern changed from fears of an over-mighty monarch to the issues of representation, parliamentary reform, and government retrenchment. Reformers sought to destroy what they saw as widespread institutional corruption.|$|E
25|$|Crayfish {{often find}} {{themselves}} in a conflicting situation where they are performing the highly motivated behavior of feeding when <b>they</b> <b>suddenly</b> receive a tail flip stimulus. Often, the crayfish will not perform a tail flip in this situation. This is because when a crayfish is actively feeding, the LGI itself is modulated by the behavior. Feeding increases the threshold for the tail flip, and even when the tail is tapped, no spikes are initiated. As a result, it takes an especially strong stimulus to elicit the tail flip. This prevents the crayfish from going hungry unless it is absolutely necessary.|$|E

25|$|As part of {{his plan}} to seize his ally the Kingdom of Spain in a {{military}} coup, Emperor Napoleon ordered several key points, including Barcelona, to be captured in February 1808. On 29 February, General of Division Giuseppe Lechi's troops were moving through Barcelona. Lechi ordered a military review, and, as his soldiers marched past the main gate of the citadel, <b>they</b> <b>suddenly</b> veered left and rushed into the fortress. Without bloodshed, the Imperial troops hustled the stunned Spanish garrison out of the fortifications and occupied the place. Among other strong places, the French also seized San Sebastian, Pamplona and Figueras. On 2 May, the Spanish people rose in revolt against the French occupiers.|$|E
25|$|While the Prussian Infantry {{in rear of}} Ligny were in {{movement}} {{for the purpose of}} relieving their comrades who were already giving way before this renewed attack, <b>they</b> <b>suddenly</b> perceived, on the French right of Ligny, a column issuing from under the heavy smoke that rolled away from the well served batteries which had so unexpectedly opened upon them, and, which continued so fearfully to thin their ranks; and, as the mass rapidly advanced down the slope with the evident design of forcing a passage across the valley, they could not fail to distinguish both by its well sustained order and compactness, and by its dark waving surface of bearskins, that they had now to contend against the redoubted Imperial Guard.|$|E
25|$|Emperor Napoleon I plotted {{to replace}} the royal family of the Kingdom of Spain. Pursuant to his design, he ordered several key points, {{including}} Barcelona, to be seized in February 1808. On 29 February, General of Division Giuseppe Lechi's Imperial French troops were marching through Barcelona, ostensibly to help fight Portugal. Lechi staged a military review, {{but it was a}} cover for gaining control of the citadel. As the soldiers marched past the main gate of the fortress, <b>they</b> <b>suddenly</b> turned left and rushed inside. Without spilling a drop of blood, the Imperial troops herded the baffled Spanish garrison out of the fortifications and occupied the place. Among other key points, the French also grabbed San Sebastian, Pamplona and Figueras. On 2 May 1808, the infuriated Spanish people rose in rebellion against their French occupiers.|$|E

25|$|William M'Culloch (1691 – 18 December 1771) was Minister of Cambuslang {{during the}} {{extraordinary}} {{events of the}} Cambuslang Work (1742) when 30,000 people gathered in the hillsides near his church for preaching and communion. Many were there struck by their own depravity and horrified at the probable punishment after death. Trembling, wailing, great pain, nose-bleeding and other strange behaviour was followed in some cases by striking conversions when <b>they</b> <b>suddenly</b> felt accepted by Christ. This gave rise to great rejoicing and singing. It was later calculated that about 400 people had been converted, though many had backslided. The Reverend M’Culloch was a strange person {{to be at the}} centre of this phenomenon — one that was being repeated in the American Colonies at the time. He was a poor preacher and claimed never to have experienced the strong feelings of sin or conversion that so many others had reported.|$|E
25|$|Sarah Jane Smith is {{a fictional}} {{character}} played by Elisabeth Sladen in the long-running BBC Television science fiction series Doctor Who {{and two of}} its spin-offs. In the fictional universe of Doctor Who and its spin-offs, Sarah Jane is a dogged investigative journalist who first encounters alien time traveller the Doctor while trying to break a story on a top secret research facility, and subsequently becomes his travelling companion {{on a series of}} adventures spanning the breadth of space and time. After travelling with the Doctor in four seasons of the show <b>they</b> <b>suddenly</b> part ways, and after this she continues to investigate strange goings-on back on Earth. Over time, Sarah Jane establishes herself as a committed defender of Earth from alien invasions and other threats, occasionally reuniting with the Doctor in the course of her own adventures, all the while continuing to work as a freelance investigative journalist.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Dr Xun Zhou, a {{research}} fellow at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, published doubts regarding the authenticity of the Kaifeng community. Zhou asserts that the apparent presence of the Jews was largely a Western cultural construct, which grew following the publication by James Finn of The Jews in China (1840) and The Orphan Colony of Jews in China (1874) whose initial research was based upon the accounts of the 17th century Jesuit missionaries. She maintains that the community had no Torah scrolls until 1851, when <b>they</b> <b>suddenly</b> appeared to be sold to eager Western collectors. She also states that drawings of the synagogue were doctored in the West because the original did not look like one, and that the Kaifeng community claimed to have kept some Jewish practices since before they are known to have begun. Xun Zhou's conclusion is that the Kaifeng community was not Jewish in any meaningful sense.|$|E
