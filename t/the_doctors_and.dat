5|$|Over 90% of <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> 93% of {{the nurses}} in Hiroshima were killed or injured—most {{had been in the}} {{downtown}} area which received the greatest damage. The hospitals were destroyed or heavily damaged. Only one doctor, Terufumi Sasaki, remained on duty at the Red Cross Hospital. Nonetheless, by early afternoon, the police and volunteers had established evacuation centres at hospitals, schools and tram stations, and a morgue was established in the Asano library.|$|E
5|$|After the incident, Bågenholm {{became a}} subject of fiction and medical textbooks, and her case has been {{discussed}} in the leading British medical journal The Lancet. On 25 October 2009 her story was featured on CNN's television program Another Day: Cheating Death. Hosted by Sanjay Gupta, the program features stories {{from people who have}} survived severe conditions against all odds. Bågenholm hoped the program would give the people watching it more knowledge of hypothermia. The story is also included in Gupta's companion book, Cheating Death: <b>The</b> <b>Doctors</b> <b>and</b> Medical Miracles that Are Saving Lives Against All Odds. On 30 October 2009, Bågenholm and Gilbert appeared together on the popular Norwegian NRK talk show Skavlan, hosted by Fredrik Skavlan.|$|E
5|$|The {{health system}} has {{more or less}} collapsed. At the end of November 2008, some {{operations}} at three of Zimbabwe's four major referral hospitals had shut down, along with the Zimbabwe Medical School, and the fourth major hospital had two wards and no operating theatres working. Due to hyperinflation, those hospitals still open {{were not able to}} obtain basic drugs and medicines. The situation changed drastically after the Unity Government and the introduction of the multi-currency system in February 2009 although the political and economic crisis also contributed to the emigration of <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> people with medical knowledge.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{receiving}} notification, the OAEP {{sent two}} officers to investigate, who met <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> {{patients at the}} hospital shortly after noon on 18 February. After questioning the scrapyard owner, they searched for the cylindrical metal pieces initially suspected to be the radiation source, but found {{that they were not}} radioactive. They then headed to the scrapyard, and noted abnormally high levels of radiation as they approached, late in the evening. At the scrapyard entrance they measured radiation at an equivalent dose of 1 millisievert per hour (mSv/h) and decided to request additional assistance.|$|E
5|$|Clouzot's {{return to}} work {{reassured}} <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> insurers and {{he returned to the}} film studio to make his final film La Prisonnière. The film began production in September 1967 and was halted when Clouzot fell ill and was hospitalized until April 1968. He began filming La Prisonnière again in August 1968. Clouzot incorporated stylistic elements of his aborted film L'enfer into La Prisonnière. La Prisonnière is about a woman who is introduced to a photographer who takes masochistic submissive pictures of young women. The woman volunteers herself as a model for these pictures and is surprised at her own pleasure in the activity. After finishing La Prisonnière, Clouzot's health grew worse. In the 1970s, he wrote a few more scripts without ever filming them, including a feature about Indochina. He also planned to direct a pornographic film in 1974 for Francis Micheline, but the film was abandoned. Clouzot's health grew worse and he required open-heart surgery in November 1976. On 12 January 1977 Clouzot died in his apartment while listening to The Damnation of Faust. Clouzot is buried beside Véra in the Montmartre Cemetery.|$|E

25|$|The doctor's wife is {{the only}} {{character}} in the entire novel who does not lose her sight. This phenomenon remains unexplained in the novel.

Once inside, she attempts to help the compound organize, but she is increasingly unable to hold back the animality of the compound.
