Subsequently, the developing thread was found to consist mainly of intermediate filaments (IFs) aligned in parallel not only to one another but also to a far fewer number of interspersed microtubules (see accompanying paper). In the present report, urea extracts of GTCs were purified and characterized to establish the properties of thread components.

40|$|In a bolted joint, it {{is known}} that {{failures}} usually happen {{at the root of the}} first bolt thread where the maximum stress concentration occurs. Previously several methods were proposed to reduce the stress concentration through improving bolts and nuts profile. Among those methods, <b>tapering</b> <b>threads</b> have been widely used in mechanical structures.

Several experimental studies indicated that CD bolts have higher fatigue strength although little FEM analyses is available.

The reduction of the stress concentration is realized by <b>tapering</b> bolt <b>thread.</b> Then, it is found that the stress reduction is notable when the height of bolt threads is reduced significantly near the bolt heat and the nut is closer to the bolt head.
