This study analyzes and compares the vulnerability of <b>tree</b> and loop <b>systems</b> under various rainfall events to structural failure represented by pipe blockage. Different pipe blockage scenarios, in which one of the pipes in an urban drainage network is assumed to be blocked individually, are constructed and their impacts on the network are simulated under different storm events. Furthermore, a vulnerability index is defined to measure the vulnerability of the drainage systems before and after the implementation of adaptation measures. The results obtained indicate that the <b>tree</b> <b>systems</b> have a relatively larger proportion of critical hydraulic pipes than the loop systems, thus the vulnerability of <b>tree</b> <b>systems</b> is substantially greater than that of the loop systems. Furthermore, the vulnerability index of <b>tree</b> <b>systems</b> is reduced after they are converted into a loop system with the implementation of adaptation measures. This paper provides an insight into the differences in the vulnerability of <b>tree</b> and loop <b>systems,</b> and provides more evidence for development of adaptation measures (e. g., tanks) to reduce urban flooding...|$|R

Three levels of debarking effort by the harvester (minimal, partial and full), and two levels of screening (with and without) were evaluated. The harvester had the lowest production rate and highest cost of the system elements. Harvester production rate was strongly affected by tree size and somewhat by debarking level. Bark contents for full debarliing averaged 1. 5 %; screening apparently did not reduce bark content any further.
