50|$|There {{has been}} a great deal of {{research}} into kamacite's trace elements. The most notable trace elements in kamacite are gallium, germanium, cobalt, copper, and chromium. Cobalt is the most notable of these where the nickel content varies from 5.26% to 6.81% and the cobalt content can be from 0.25% to 0.77%. All of these trace elements are metallic and their appearance near the kamacite taenite border can give important clues to the environment the meteorite was formed in. Mass spectroscopy has revealed kamacite to contain considerable amounts <b>of</b> platinum <b>to</b> be <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> 16.31 (µg/g), iridium <b>to</b> be <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> 5.40 (µg/g), osmium <b>to</b> be <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> 3.89 (µg/g), tungsten <b>to</b> be <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> 1.97 (µg/g), gold <b>to</b> be <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> 0.75 (µg/g), rhenium <b>to</b> be <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> 0.22 (µg/g).

5|$|In 2012, a study {{conducted}} by , UC Davis, US Forest Service, and the Hoopa Tribe showed that fishers in California were exposed to and killed by anticoagulant rodenticides associated with marijuana cultivation. In this study, 79% of fishers that were tested in California were exposed <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> 1.61 different anticoagulant rodenticides and four fishers died directly attributed to these toxicants. A 2015 follow-up study building on this data determined that the trend of exposure and mortality from these toxicants increased to 85%, that California fishers were now exposed <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> 1.73 different anticoagulant rodenticides, and that nine more fishers died, bringing the total to 13. The extent of marijuana cultivation within fishers' home ranges was highlighted in a 2013 study focusing on fisher survival and impacts from marijuana cultivation within the Sierra National Forest. Research showed that fishers had an average of 5.3 individual grow sites within their home range. One fisher had 16 individual grow sites within its territory.|$|E

5|$|An ambush predator, the Pacific {{angelshark}} conceals {{itself on}} the sea floor and waits for approaching prey, primarily bony fishes and squid. Prey are targeted visually and, with a quick upward thrust of the head, snatched in protrusible jaws. Individual sharks actively choose ideal ambush sites, where they stay for several days {{before moving on to}} a new one. This species is more active at night than during the day, when it stays buried in sediment and seldom moves. Reproduction is ovoviviparous, with the embryos hatching inside the mother's uterus and being sustained by a yolk sac until birth. Females give birth <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> six young every spring.|$|E
5|$|As a hominid brain, {{the human}} brain is {{substantially}} enlarged even {{in comparison to the}} brain of a typical monkey. The sequence of human evolution from Australopithecus (four million years ago) to Homo sapiens (modern man) was marked by a steady increase in brain size. As brain size increased, this altered {{the size and shape of}} the skull, from about 600 cm3 in Homo habilis <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>average</b> <b>of</b> about 1520cm3 in Homo neanderthalensis. Differences in DNA, gene expression and gene–environment interactions help explain the differences between the function of {{the human brain}} and other primates.|$|E

The proportion of workers who achieved 100 percent or less of their quota varied from as low as 5.1 percent in iron and steel industries, to 31.4 percent in coal mining. Across Soviet industry, the average level of quota fulfillment fell from 169 percent before the reform, to 120 percent in October 1963.|$|E
