5|$|A large {{subdivision}} near Route30 sustained minor {{roof and}} tree damage, which was rated as EF0intensity. However, as the tornado was intensifying <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood,</b> three homes to the subdivision's east suffered more considerable roof and siding damage and was assigned an EF1damage intensity rating. The tornado then crossed Missouri Route 141, where it blew a Honda CR-V into a highway barrier; {{the driver of}} the vehicle suffered critical injuries and died eleven days later from those injuries. After crossing the highway, a number of buildings were damaged including a church, elementary school, and parsonage. Damage in this area was rated as EF2 due to the partial debarking of a nearby tree. Minor tree damage occurred as the tornado moved through Fenton Park and tracked over the Meramec River.|$|E
5|$|Passing {{the park}} gate, M-203 {{continues}} northeasterly. The roadway skirts the northern shore of Bear Lake {{on the eastern}} end of the state park. At Lakeshore Drive, M-203 turns inland running due east to Cloverland Road then turning north and east along Veterans Memorial Highway. Along this section of roadway, the AADT was measured at 440vehicles in 2007. The highway follows Veterans Memorial Highway <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> of Tamarack west of Calumet.

The northern terminus of M-203 is at the intersection of Pine Street and Calumet Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{reaching}} Taylorsville, {{the highway}} intersects I-215. Shortly thereafter, the road passes Salt Lake Community College and enters West Valley City. It soon reaches a single-point urban interchange at SR-201 that {{lies on the}} border of West Valley City and Salt Lake City. The highway loses one lane in each direction past the frontage road of SR-201. West of Salt Lake City, the highway passes over the surplus canal of the Jordan River as it goes through the neighborhoods of Glendale and Poplar Grove. It arrives at an interchange with I-80 east of Salt Lake City International Airport. The road loses one lane northbound beyond 1000 North as it proceeds <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> of Rose Park in the northwestern portion of the city; the second southbound lane is lost north of 1300 North. The highway crosses the Jordan River before exiting the county.|$|E

5|$|The video premiered on October 4, 1994, on MTV. It {{begins with}} showing the {{neighborhood}} of Harlem, with Madonna as a singer in a small jazz club. She simply sits in the club with her band and sings for her small, mostly black and Latino audience. Interspersed throughout the video are scenes {{of people living in}} Harlem, doing their daily chores, including a supporting cast of transvestite prostitutes, a pimp, and a black gang member who shows off the scars on his body. During the intermediate verses, Madonna is shown writhing in the lap of an older, maternal woman, who symbolically baptizes her by splashing water on her forehead. Near the video's end, Madonna walks <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> and climbs a set of stairs to have a reunion with her family, a young Latin man and their supposed son. The video ends with Madonna smiling towards the camera while sitting at the nightclub.|$|E

25|$|Elmhurst {{developed}} as a fashionable district due to a housing development built by the Cord Meyer Development Company between 1896 and 1910, north of the Port Washington Branch railroad station.

25|$|The Union-Miles Park {{neighborhood}} is somewhat close to both downtown Cleveland and the University Circle arts and museum area, but the {{neighborhood is}} relatively isolated from both of them. The only major north-south road <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> is E. 93rd Street, which is in poor condition, does not extend to University Circle, and which has two active at-grade railroad crossings. Harvard, Miles, and Union Avenues, the major east-west roads, are in relatively good condition but provide no access to downtown. The many railroad lines also isolate the neighborhood from the surrounding city and suburbs. Abandoning or changing the route of these rail lines, and eliminating the numerous at-grade crossings in the neighborhood, are not currently feasible.|$|E

At that point, 17-year-old Augustin Lizama was to be retried. During the {{sentencing}} of the three convicted murderers, Margaret Fregoso, Rodriguez's grandmother, defended him and said that people outside of the court speculated that the Kuhen automobile traveled <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>neighborhood</b> so one or more occupants could purchase recreational drugs. Robynn Kuhen, the mother of Stephanie Kuhen, said that her family {{was trying to find}} a shortcut home and said that Fregoso's statements were not true. The defense in the trial suggested that the Kuhen family knew the layout of the area and would not have found themselves lost in their car. On Friday, August 29, 1997, Lizama agreed to a plea bargain in which he received a conviction for assault.|$|E
