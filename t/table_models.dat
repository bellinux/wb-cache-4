50|$|The {{specifics}} of any ancient age distribution, moreover, {{would have seen}} heavy variation under the impact of local conditions. In pre-modern societies, the major {{cause of death was}} not the chronic, end-of-life conditions that characterize mortality in industrialized societies, nor primary malnutrition, but acute infectious disease, which has varied effects on age distributions in populations. Pulmonary tuberculosis, for example, characterized much of the Roman region in antiquity; its deaths tend to be concentrated in the early twenties, where model life tables show a mortality trough. Similarly, in pre-modern societies for which evidence is available, such as early modern England and early eighteenth-century China, infant mortality varies independently of adult mortality, to the extent that equal life expectancies at age twenty can be obtained in societies with infant mortality rates of 15% to 35% (life <b>table</b> <b>models</b> omit this; they depend on the assumption that age-specific mortality ratios co-vary in uniform, predictable ratios). No ancient evidence can gauge this effect (the sources have a strong tendency to overlook infant death), and the model life tables might overstate it, but comparative evidence suggests that it is very high: mortality was strongly concentrated {{in the first years of}} life.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: This {{exploratory}} {{study examined the}} preferences of healthcare providers and patients with respect to overbed table fea-tures and functions, {{as well as how}} the devices tend to be used. BACKGROUND: In order to improve the design of overbed tables, {{it is important to understand}} which features and functions of existing models are valued by healthcare providers and patients. METHODS: A sample of overbed <b>table</b> <b>models</b> was presented to vol-unteers, who were asked to choose which models ’ implementation of specific features and functions they preferred. Structured interviews incorporating both forced choice and free response questions were administered to the volunteers—healthcare providers and patients at a rehabilitation hospital. RESULTS: While the overbed tabletop and extendable tray are heavily used, all other features of the overbed <b>table</b> <b>models</b> are rarely used. Usability of the models exhibits the potential for improvement. Health-care providers ’ and patients ’ feature preferences differ and occasion-ally conflict. CONCLUSIONS: Existing overbed tables are valued primarily for the top surface. Other features and functions of the overbed table present opportunities for refinement of design, durability, and usability. There are strong patterns of agreement and disagreement in the preferenc-es of healthcare providers and patients with respect to overbed table design, use, features, and functionality.

In addition, statistical tests of results of each model indicate a consistency in each model's prediction capabilities, and most of the variation in the results could be explained by model parameters.

The model {{is applied to the}} Framingham Heart Study 46 -year follow-up data. Life table functions and projections of risk factors are calculated to demonstrate the nonlinear effects on observable quantities over time. A set of statistically significant nonlinear contributions to covariate dynamics is identified. Their synergistic effect on dynamics and use of them as “new” risk factors are discussed. An important advantage of this approach is the ability to study the effects of health interventions at the individual level. This is illustrated in several examples. stochastic differential Equations, quadratic hazard, life table, risk factors, Fokker-Planck equation, longitudinal data,...|$|E
