5|$|I {{realized}} <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{trying to}} push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try {{and figure out what}} the point of living was... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built... I realized that that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of {{the whole point of the}} movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.|$|E

Producers told me, 'Boy, you really stuck it to the {{networks}}.' The networks told me, 'Boy, you really hammered the studios.' Nobody got to <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> indicting all of us. What is frustrating about this is nothing has changed. Everybody wants to do everything the way it has been done 100 times before." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2007, Boxer was in {{the news}} for {{comments}} she made when responding to Bush's plans to send an additional 20,000 troops to Iraq. [...] "Who pays the price?" [...] Boxer asked Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. [...] "I'm {{not going to pay}} a personal price. My kids are too old and my grandchild is too young. You're not going to pay a personal price with an immediate family. So who pays the price? The American military and their families... not me, not you." [...] When Rice interjected, Boxer responded by saying, [...] "Madam Secretary, please. I know you feel terrible about it. That's not <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> making the case as to who pays the price for your decisions. And the fact that this administration would move forward with this escalation with no clue as to the further price that we're going to pay militarily... I find really appalling." ...|$|E

2500|$|Madonna {{has been}} a strong {{supporter}} of U.S. President Barack Obama. She urged fans to vote for Obama and claimed that he is a [...] "Black Muslim" [...] which was largely seen as offensive since Obama is a Christian and has discussed about his faith in the past. Madonna clarified her statements by saying that she merely being ironic and said [...] "Yes, I know Obama is not a Muslim— though I know that plenty {{of people in this country}} think he is. And what if he were? <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> making is that a good man is a good man, no matter who he prays to. I don’t care what religion Obama is— nor should anyone else in America." [...] Madonna's support for President Obama has generally been met with cheers from her audience. [...] However, when Madonna voiced her support for President Obama in the traditionally conservative state of Louisiana during her New Orleans performance, she was booed by the audience. [...] Madonna tried to rectify the situation by saying to her audience, [...] "I don't care who you vote for. [...] Do not take this great privilege for granted." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} in October 2001, Mundine said of the 11 September terrorist attacks, [...] "They call it an act of terrorism, {{but if you can}} understand religion, and our way of life, it’s not about terrorism. It’s about fighting for God’s law, and America’s brought it upon themselves". Offering some insight into his tendency to make controversial comments in the media, Mundine stated that [...] "If you want to toe the line, {{if you want to be}} some corporate guy and say the right things, do the right things, you might be okay in the media's eye, but it won't be real for me." [...] Mundine later claimed he was taken out of context stating: [...] "Those comments were just spun around like I was clapping my hands. I have a family too, I know what it is like to suffer the loss of someone close to me, and I would never wish that upon anyone. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> trying to get across was that it was in a war state of mind, and there is always going to be tit for tat, so why put yourself in a situation where you can endanger people. I have got nothing against any American, I have got nothing against any human being. It breaks my heart that people think I would even have that line of thought about being happy about people dying. That is crap and I want to clarify that because it is wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|Madonna {{also met}} {{controversy}} while performing in the United States. Madonna created controversy at her performance in Washington, D.C. when she urged fans {{to vote for}} President Barack Obama and claimed {{that he is a}} [...] "Black Muslim" [...] which was largely seen as offensive since President Obama is a Christian and has discussed about his faith in the past.

I don’t care what religion Obama is— nor should anyone else in America." [...] In her Los Angeles performance, Madonna dedicated her performance to Malala Yousafzai, a 14-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot by the Taliban for speaking out on her right to have an education. Madonna responded in the concert by saying [...] "This made me cry. The 14-year-old Pakistani girl who was shot on a school bus for writing a blog… who wrote a blog about how important education was to her. The Taliban stopped her bus and shot her… Do you understand the sickness and absurdity of this?" [...] Madonna went on to shout, [...] "Support education! Support the people who support women!" [...] Madonna showed the audience a written tattoo on her back with Malala's name on it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Upon my word," [...] said Miss Featherstone, [...] "I {{should think}} it was the Fourth of July; but <b>I</b> yield <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> convinced; and {{henceforth}} you will see me among the most stringent of the leaguers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The meaning was, {{that this}} poor {{child had been}} told it was {{etiquette}} {{for me to have}} a chaperon at my heels, and made such a disturbance that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> obliged to give up <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not ashamed. She is a good girl, though a troublesome one at times.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{understand}} <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> making," [...] Paula took up. [...] "Here are {{the pair}} of you. Neither will see forty again.

You've roughed and rowdied over the world--" ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. LINCOLN: You and I {{will be on}} {{the best}} terms in the world, but I do not wish to be {{diverted}} from <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> trying to press.|$|E
6000|$|... "I should {{consider}} it a species of sacrilege," [...] answered Seymour, [...] "and I shall be far from pressing <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to make against a house of Mrs. Corey's." ...|$|E
60|$|But that I {{will tell}} about later. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> coming to was that I did not realise {{until after the}} crash how {{recklessly}} my uncle had kept his promise of paying a dividend of over eight per cent. on the ordinary shares of that hugely over-capitalised enterprise, Household Services.|$|E
60|$|However, that <b>is</b> not <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{intending}} to discuss. What I {{want to speak}} about is the progress of medicine. There, if you like, is something wonderful. Any lover of humanity (or of either sex of it) who looks back on the achievements of medical science must feel his heart glow and his right ventricle expand with the pericardiac stimulus of a permissible pride.|$|R
50|$|The problem <b>is</b> {{not that}} <b>I</b> {{disagree}} with the timelessness crowd, it’s that <b>I</b> don’t see <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not motivated to {{make the effort to}} carefully read what they <b>are</b> writing, because <b>I</b> <b>am</b> very unclear about what is to be gained by doing so. If anyone could spell out straightforwardly what <b>I</b> might <b>be</b> able to understand by thinking of the world in the language of timelessness, I’d be very happy to re-orient my attitude and take these works seriously.|$|R
40|$|For a given set of N <b>points,</b> <b>the</b> goal is {{to select}} a subset of exemplars and to assign other points {{to one of the}} exemplars.

6000|$|... "Both," [...] laughed Graham. [...] "He was a Hawick terry; I {{was born}} between Selkirk and Ettrick shaws. The {{official}} {{language of the}} Company was Caledonian; but that's beside <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> young enough to feel hurt; though I knew my man and how staunch he was to the Company's traditional policy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{what did}} he reply, Mrs. Wilkins," [...] I asked; [...] "your brass-finishing friend, who was holding forth {{on the subject of}} Chinese cheap labour." [...] Mrs. Wilkins as a conversationalist is not easily kept to <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> curious to know what the working classes were {{thinking}} on the subject.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That is just <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{not mistaken}} in,' said Ladywell warmly. 'She did care for me, and I stood {{as well with}} her as any man could stand until this fellow came, whoever he is. I {{sometimes}} feel so disturbed about it that I have a good mind to call upon her and ask his name. Wouldn't you, Neigh? Will you accompany me?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, {{my little}} nephews and nieces--that's <b>the</b> very <b>point!</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> helping {{to bring them}} up," [...] said Morris Townsend. [...] "I am a kind of amateur tutor; I give them lessons." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not--and that <b>is</b> just <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{trying to}} make," [...] went on Tom {{to the owner}} of Putnam Hall. [...] "As soon as the firecracker went off, this man rushed up and demanded an explanation. He was going to lock up my brother first, but I said I had fired the cracker, and so he {{compelled}} {{me to go to}} the guardroom with him. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> locked in and treated to bread and milk for supper, and he wanted to steal the keys of my trunk and valise from me." ...|$|R
60|$|Your {{remarks on}} the Black Arrow <b>are</b> to <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> pleased you liked Crookback; he is a fellow whose hellish energy has always fixed my attention. I wish Shakespeare had written the play after he had learned some of the rudiments of {{literature}} and art rather than before. Some day, I will re-tickle the Sable Missile, and shoot it, moyennant finances, once more into the air; I can lighten it of much, and devote some more attention to Dick o' Gloucester. It's great sport to write tushery.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, that's <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> coming to," [...] {{returned}} the King with his comical smile. [...] "The ocean {{is a beautiful}} place, and we who belong here love it dearly. In many ways it's a nicer place for a home than the earth, for we have no sunstroke, mosquitoes, earthquakes or candy ships to bother us. But I am convinced that the ocean is no proper dwelling place for earth people, and I believe the mermaids did an unwise thing when they invited you to visit them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, boy, that's just <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> comin' to. A {{thousand}} pounds will do. Now, if you lend me that sum, I'm willin' {{to take you}} into partnership, and we'll buy the place and farm it together. I think we'll pull well in the same boat, for I think you like me well enough, and I'm sure I like you, and I know Ailie don't object to either of us; and after I'm gone, Glynn, you can work the farm for Ailie and give her her share.

60|$|Although I had {{resolved}} {{to go with}} them, and had set Nuflo's mind at rest on <b>the</b> <b>point,</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> bent on getting the request from Rima's own lips; {{and the next morning}} the opportunity of seeing her alone presented itself, after old Nuflo had sneaked off with his dogs. From the moment of his departure I kept a close watch on the house, as one watches a bush in which a bird one wishes to see has concealed itself, and out of which it may dart at any moment and escape unseen.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] he said, [...] "now we <b>are</b> {{getting to}} <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> {{wondering}} {{how long it}} would take you to see it, Allan, but if you are slow, you are sure." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know she}} has used {{him as a}} vehicle for her {{particular}} form of insanity, but that's not <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> What <b>I</b> <b>am</b> asking is why she was introduced at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just <b>the</b> very <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> working round to. There, as you say, is the snag. Why not chuck {{the whole}} idea of {{hitching}} up with me? Wash it out altogether. I mean, if you love old Gussie----" ...|$|R
60|$|I fled away to {{yet other}} friends. I sought vindication. The thing had become vital, and I needs must put myself right. I felt {{called upon to}} explain, though well knowing that he who {{explains}} is lost. I {{told the story of}} the poppy over again. I went into the minutest details. I added to it, and expanded. I talked myself hoarse, and when I could talk no more they looked bored. Also, they said insipid things, and soothful things, and things concerning other things, and not at all to <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> consumed with anger, and there and then I renounced them all.|$|E
6000|$|First Letter.--"My statement, as your Lordship requests, {{shall be}} short and to <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{doing very well}} as a portrait-painter in the country; and I had a wife and {{children}} to consider. Under the circumstances, if I had been left to decide for myself, I should certainly have waited until I had saved a little money before I ventured on the serious expense of taking a house and studio at {{the west end of}} London. Your Lordship, I positively declare, encouraged me to try the experiment without waiting. And here I am, unknown and unemployed, a helpless artist lost in London--with a sick wife and hungry children, and bankruptcy staring me in the face. On whose shoulders does this dreadful responsibility rest? On your Lordship's!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As {{for what}} this woman writes," [...] her husband went on, [...] "it is true. I {{suppose it is}} useless to deny a single word of it. She was hidden behind the curtain, then! She heard and saw all! If Vimpany had found her! He was right. No one so {{dangerous}} as a woman. Yes; she has told you exactly what happened. She suspected all along. We should have sent her away and changed our plans. This comes of being too clever. Nothing would do for the doctor but the man's death. I hoped--we both hoped--that he would die a natural death. He did not. Without a dead man we were powerless. We {{had to get a}} dead man, Iris, I will hide nothing more from you, whatever happens. I confess everything. I knew {{that he was going to}} die. When he began to get well I was filled with forebodings, because I knew that he would never be allowed to go away. How else could we find a dead body? You can't steal a body; you can't make one up. You must have one for proof of death. I say"--his voice was harsh and hoarse--"I say that I knew he must die. I saw his death in the doctor's face. And there was no more money left for a new experiment if Oxbye should get well and go away. When it came to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> seized with mortal terror. I would have given up everything--everything--to see the man get up from his bed and go away. But it was too late. I saw the doctor prepare the final dose, and when he had it to his lips I saw by his eyes that it was the drink of death. I have told you all," [...] he concluded.|$|E

60|$|Long ere {{the last}} of the column could hope to reach the upper pits which lay above <b>the</b> danger <b>point</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{convinced}} that <b>the</b> waters would surge after us in overwhelming volume, and that fully half the expedition would be snuffed out.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> reflected. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{driven to}} <b>the</b> <b>point</b> now. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> brought {{face to face}} with Necessity.
