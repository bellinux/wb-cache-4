5|$|Due {{to their}} {{technical}} knowledge, {{the most important}} officers were the three Prothonotaries, {{the first and third}} of whom were appointed by the Chief Justice and the second by the Chief Justice on the advice of the Custos Brevium. They were responsible for enrolling records of litigation, including anything that raised a point of law, and were often consulted by the court due to their detailed technical knowledge. The Chief Justice also appointed <b>the</b> <b>Clerk</b> of the Warrants, Clerk of the Treasury (also known as <b>the</b> <b>Clerk</b> of Hell), the Keeper of the Seal, <b>the</b> <b>Clerk</b> of Essoins and <b>the</b> <b>Clerk</b> of Acknowledgments of Fines and Recoveries (who was officially the Chief Justice's own clerk, rather than that of the court), as well as other officials.

5|$|Before {{the reign}} of Henry VIII, the {{sovereign}} always granted his or her assent in person. The sovereign, wearing the Imperial State Crown, would be seated on the throne in the Lords chamber, surrounded by heralds {{and members of the}} royal court—a scene that nowadays is repeated only at the annual State Opening of Parliament. The Commons, led by their speaker, would listen from the Bar of the Lords, just outside the chamber. <b>The</b> <b>Clerk</b> of the Parliaments presented the bills awaiting assent to the monarch, save that supply bills were traditionally brought up by the speaker. <b>The</b> <b>Clerk</b> of the Crown, standing on the sovereign's right, then read aloud the titles of the bills (in earlier times, the entire text of the bills). <b>The</b> <b>Clerk</b> of the Parliaments, standing on the sovereign's left, responded by stating the appropriate Norman French formula.|$|E
5|$|Independently of {{the method}} used to signify royal assent, it is the {{responsibility}} of <b>the</b> <b>Clerk</b> of the Parliaments, once the assent has been duly notified to both houses, not only to endorse the act in the name of the monarch with the formal Norman French formula, but to certify that assent has been granted. <b>The</b> <b>clerk</b> signs one authentic copy of the bill and inserts the date (in English) on which the assent was notified to the two houses after the title of the act. When an act is published, the signature of <b>the</b> <b>clerk</b> is omitted, as is the Norman French formula, should the endorsement have been made in writing. However, the date on which the assent was notified is printed in brackets.|$|E

5|$|Under the Acts of Union in 1800, Irish peers {{were allowed}} to elect twenty-eight {{representative}} peers, each of whom could serve for life. The Chamber of the Irish House of Lords, located in Parliament House on College Green in central Dublin, housed the first election, attended by the peers or their proxies. <b>The</b> <b>Clerk</b> of the Crown in Ireland was responsible for electoral arrangements; each peer voted by an open and public ballot. The results of the first election were announced by <b>the</b> <b>Clerk</b> of the Crown and published in both The Dublin Gazette and The London Gazette. After the Union, new elections were held whenever vacancies occurred due {{to the death of}} any peer. The Lord Chancellor of Great Britain—the presiding officer of the House of Lords—certified the vacancy, while the Lord Chancellor of Ireland directed <b>the</b> <b>Clerk</b> of the Crown to issue ballots to Irish peers.

5|$|The Dialogus de Scaccario or Dialogue {{concerning}} the Exchequer, written in about 1178, details {{the workings of}} the Exchequer and gives an early account of how the Pipe rolls were created. The Dialogue was written by Richard FitzNeal, the son of Nigel of Ely, who was Treasurer for both Henry I and Henry II of England. According to the Dialogue, the Pipe rolls were the responsibility of <b>the</b> <b>clerk</b> of the Treasurer, who was called <b>the</b> <b>Clerk</b> of the Pipe and later <b>the</b> <b>clerk</b> of the pells. FitzNeal wrote his work to explain {{the inner workings of the}} Exchequer, and in it he lists a number of different types of rolls used by the Treasury. He also describes the creation of the Pipe rolls and how they are used. The Dialogue also states that the Pipe rolls, along with Domesday Book and other records, were kept in the treasury, because they were required for daily use by the Exchequer clerks.|$|E

5|$|The justices were {{assisted}} by {{a staff of}} over 50 officials, most of whom sat in Westminster Hall but also kept offices at the various Inns of Court. The Chief Clerk was the Custos Brevium, appointed by the crown, but in practice clerking matters were handled by his deputy, as the office was a royal favour rather than a serious judicial appointment. The crown also appointed the court chirographer, the officer responsible for noting final concords and filing records of fines. Another high-ranking clerk was <b>the</b> <b>Clerk</b> of the Outlawries, an under-clerk of the Attorney General for England and Wales, who was tasked with recording recognizances to protect {{the interests of the}} King in common law matters. In 1541 his position was replaced with the office of Clerk of the King's Process. Other offices created during the reign of Henry VIII include <b>the</b> <b>Clerk</b> of the Recognizances in 1432, who recorded debts secured by recognizances and the office of Receiver of Debts, who was tasked with receiving and recording money coming into the court via debts and fines, and was first appointed in 1536.|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} after the execution, the ten {{condemned}} prisoners who had had their sentences commuted to twelve months' imprisonment were transported to the prison hulk Justitia, moored at Woolwich on the River Thames. Such ships were used as holding areas prior to convicts being transferred to a regular vessel for penal transportation to, at this time, Australia. Residents of Ely tried to hold meetings to complain at this apparent extension of the prisoners' sentences. Despite, or because of, media attention—newspapers of the time took sides depending whether they supported the government or not—the prisoners were returned to Ely gaol; it may all have been a simple mistake by <b>the</b> <b>clerk</b> of the assizes.|$|E
