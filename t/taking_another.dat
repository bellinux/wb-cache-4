5|$|In July, Spears {{announced}} her engagement to American dancer Kevin Federline, {{whom she had}} met three months before. As Federline had only recently ended his relationship with actress Shar Jackson, who was pregnant with their second child, this engagement {{was the subject of}} extensive media coverage. They held a wedding ceremony on September 18, 2004, but were not legally married until three weeks later on October 6 due to a delay finalizing the couple's prenuptial agreement. In October 2004, the singer announced she would be <b>taking</b> <b>another</b> career break to start a family.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{struggled}} {{against the new}} ball in the first {{hour of the day}} three. Miller played and missed three times in one over before being trapped lbw for 31; the tourists added only nine runs in the first hour. Four runs later, Morris reached 51 and fell to Bedser, leaving Australia at 5/139. It had been a slow morning for Morris—he took 21 minutes to add a single to his overnight total and reached 50 after <b>taking</b> <b>another</b> 24 minutes to register his second run of the day. Australia fell for 221, narrowly avoiding the follow on, and England declared at 3/174 on the last morning after many rain delays. This left Bradman’s team with a victory target of 317, but the rain kept falling and the entire morning was lost.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{played a}} key part in Victoria's win over New South Wales away at the SCG. Having taken two catches as the hosts batted first, he made 61 as the {{visitors}} made 234 to take a 52-run first innings lead. After <b>taking</b> <b>another</b> catch in the second innings, he then made an unbeaten 106 to guide the Victorians to their target of 268 with five wickets in hand. Harvey's run-scoring tapered away {{in the last two}} matches of the season; he made 74 runs in three innings in the match. Nevertheless, he ended the season with 699 runs at 49.92; he had made the same number of runs in his first six first-class seasons since his debut in 1947–48. As a result of his performances in this season, he was hailed as the best batsman outside the Australian Test team.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, the BAA and NBL merged to {{form the}} NBA. The new league started the inaugural 1949–50 NBA season, {{featuring}} 17 teams, with the Lakers in the Central Division. Mikan again was dominant, averaging 27.4 points per game and 2.9 assists per game and <b>taking</b> <b>another</b> scoring title; Alex Groza of Indianapolis Olympians {{was the only other}} player to break the 20-point-barrier that year. After comfortably leading his team to an impressive 51–17 record and storming through the playoffs, Mikan's team played the 1950 NBA Finals against the Syracuse Nationals. In Game 1, the Lakers beat Syracuse on their home court when Lakers reserve guard Bob Harrison hit a 40-foot buzzer beater to give Minneapolis a two-point win. The team split the next four games, and in Game 6, the Lakers won 110–95 and won the first-ever NBA championship. Mikan scored 31.3 points per game in the playoffs.|$|E

50|$|No {{law in the}} Torah or Talmud {{directly}} prohibits disturbing another's sleep. Nevertheless, some rabbis have prohibited or discouraged {{such behavior}} as being unkind to others and because it cannot be rectified. The closest Torah law that is invoked is Love thy neighbor as thyself (Leviticus 19:18). Concerns are that <b>taking</b> <b>another's</b> sleep injure a person by making them less productive, less able to concentrate properly following their unexpected arousal, less competently able to perform their duties {{due to lack of}} sleep, more angry, and depriving one of a meaningful dream.|$|R

50|$|A Social Story is an {{individualized}} short story that describes social relevant cues {{in any given}} situation.

It includes answers to questions such as who, what, when, where, and why in social situations {{through the use of}} visuals and written text. Social Stories are used to teach particular social skills, such as identifying important cues in a given situation; <b>taking</b> <b>another’s</b> point of view; understanding rules, routines, situations, upcoming events or abstract concepts; and understanding expectations.|$|R

25|$|In July 2004, Spears {{announced}} her engagement to American dancer Kevin Federline, {{whom she had}} met three months before. The romance received intense attention from the media, since Federline had recently broken up with actress Shar Jackson, who was still pregnant with their second child at the time. The initial stages of their relationship were chronicled in Spears's first reality show , which aired on UPN {{in the spring of}} 2005. They held a wedding ceremony on September 18, 2004, but were not legally married until three weeks later on October 6 due to a delay finalizing the couple's prenuptial agreement.

They decide to explore the attic connecting the houses, but take the wrong door and surprise Digory's Uncle Andrew in his study. Uncle Andrew tricks Polly into touching a yellow magic ring, causing her to vanish. Then he explains to Digory that he has been dabbling in magic, and that the rings allow travel between one world and another. He blackmails Digory into <b>taking</b> <b>another</b> yellow ring to follow wherever Polly has gone, and two green rings so that they both can return.|$|E

40|$|<b>Taking</b> <b>another’s</b> {{perspective}} {{is central to}} effective social interactions. Understanding another’s visual perspective (e. g. what another person can see (level 1), and how another person can see something (level 2)) can help to resolve potential ambiguities in social communication. This research takes a novel approach by exploring {{the extent to which}} biases in a person’s thoughts, the saliency of objects in the environment, and the environment itself affects the ability to take another’s visual perspective. In study 1, we explored whether a distracting environment (e. g. a bar for social drinkers) and specific thoughts (cravings for alcohol) impacted visual perspective-taking. Results showed that neither had a significant effect on perspective-taking ability (ps >. 1). In study 2, we explored whether the presence of personally salient objects (e. g. alcohol objects in social drinkers) interfered with visual perspective-taking. These objects delayed visual perspective-taking when they were visually available to both parties and there was inconsistent information between the perspectives (p <. 05). In study 3, we examined the role of objects further by exploring whether the frequency of exposure to unfamiliar objects (e. g. abstract symbols) affected visual perspective-taking. Here the frequency of occurrence did not affect perspective-taking. Together, these findings indicate that the salient nature of objects, rather than specific environments or related cognitions, impact the ability to effectively take others’ visual perspective, but only where they relate to a specific context (e. g. alcohol cues instead of abstract symbols). We will discuss implications for the impact of external influences on <b>taking</b> <b>another’s</b> perspective...|$|R
