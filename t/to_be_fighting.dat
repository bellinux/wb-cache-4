5|$|Basil Mitchell {{responded to}} Flew's falsification {{principle}} {{with his own}} parable. He described an underground resistance soldier who meets a stranger who claims to be leading the resistance movement. The stranger tells the soldier to keep faith in him, {{even if he is}} seen <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fighting</b> for the other side. The soldier's faith is regularly tested as he observes the stranger fighting for both sides, but his faith remains strong. Mitchell's parable teaches that although evidence can challenge a religious belief, a believer still has reason to hold their views. He argued that although a believer will not allow anything to count decisively against his beliefs, the theist still accepts the existence of evidence which could count against religious belief.|$|E
5|$|No. 4 Commando {{was formed}} in Weymouth on 21 July 1940, when the first intake of 500 volunteers arrived. The unique nature of the commandos {{immediately}} became apparent when every man was held responsible for finding his own quarters. As commandos were expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fighting</b> troops, they had no administrative personnel, such as clerks and cooks for example. To assist them with living 'off camp', with no cook house all ranks were given a daily allowance and a ration card, the allowance being 67 pence for officers and of 34 pence for other ranks. This arrangement meant that commandos lived on civilian rations, {{while the rest of}} the armed forces had the more plentiful military scale of rations.|$|E

5|$|The {{player is}} first fully {{introduced}} to the Terrans in Episode I of StarCraft. For {{a number of years}} before the game begins, the Confederacy is shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fighting</b> a slowly losing war against the Sons of Korhal. When the Zerg and Protoss make their existence known, the pace of the war quickly changes. The player, accompanied by Jim Raynor, joins up with Arcturus Mengsk and the Sons of Korhal, and helps bring about the fall of the Confederacy by using Confederate technology to lure the Zerg into destroying the Confederate capital Tarsonis. In the process however, Mengsk abandons his second-in-command, Sarah Kerrigan, to the Zerg on Tarsonis. As a result of the brutal tactics used by Mengsk and his needless sacrifice of Kerrigan to the Zerg, Raynor abandons Mengsk and his newly formed Dominion to search for the lost Kerrigan. When Raynor finally finds her on the planet Char it is revealed that she had been captured and infested by the Zerg Overmind. He then meets Zeratul and Tassadar and consequently becomes an ally to the Protoss. Raynor's forces assist the Protoss in defending their homeworld from the Zerg and in destroying the Zerg Overmind in the game's conclusion.|$|E

25|$|The {{reasons for}} {{fighting}} vary from group to group. The FARC and other guerrilla movements claim <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fighting</b> {{for the rights}} of the poor in Colombia to protect them from government violence and to provide social justice through communism. The Colombian government claims <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fighting</b> for order and stability, and seeking to protect the rights and interests of its citizens. The paramilitary groups claim to be reacting to perceived threats by guerrilla movements. Both guerrilla and paramilitary groups have been accused of engaging in drug trafficking and terrorism. All of the parties engaged in the conflict have been criticized for numerous human rights violations.|$|E

25|$|Training {{exercises}} continued {{along the}} north coast, which caused {{a certain amount of}} boredom amongst the officers and men who by now had expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fighting.</b> On 19 April 1941, the regiment moved to Abercorn Barracks at Ballykinlar and re-equipped as an armoured regiment with Mk I Valentine tanks.|$|E
25|$|The Houthis {{have urged}} their {{supporters}} in northern Yemen {{to support the}} Syrian government.

Many Houthis were reported <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fighting</b> {{on the side of the}} government.|$|E
25|$|Coming off {{a series}} defeat in India, England were low in confidence, {{and even their}} star {{performer}} in India and Sri Lanka, Graeme Hick, was still considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fighting</b> for his place, judging by comments to the media by coach Keith Fletcher. Graham Gooch resigned the captaincy after the Fourth Test, once the series was decided, and Mike Atherton led the side {{in the final two}} tests, winning the Sixth, at The Oval.|$|E

He was subsequently placed in a medically-induced coma. He was released from hospital in September 2015.|$|E
25|$|Kennedy later {{decided to}} embark on the trip with three basic goals in mind: {{he wanted to help}} raise more Democratic Party presidential {{campaign}} fund contributions; he wanted to begin his quest for reelection in November 1964; and, because the Kennedy-Johnson ticket had barely won Texas in 1960 (and had even lost in Dallas), President Kennedy wanted to help mend political fences among several leading Texas Democratic party members who appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fighting</b> politically amongst themselves.|$|E
25|$|Marilyn Burns: Marilyn Burns is the Alberta Alliance justice {{critic and}} {{candidate}} for Stony Plain in the 2004 election. Marilyn {{was the first}} candidate to get her campaign off the ground. One of her main principles is defending Alberta's provincial rights, under a heavily expanded version of the Alberta Agenda. She is a lawyer, politician and mother of four from Edmonton Alberta. Informal polls have shown her <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fighting</b> for {{the lead in the}} race with David Crutcher.|$|E

25|$|From 1948 until 1961, Israeli {{citizens}} {{required an}} exit visa {{as well as}} a passport to travel overseas even temporarily. Initially the intention was to prevent the departure of Jews who ought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fighting,</b> but also due to a perception that those leaving harmed national solidarity. After the war the restrictions were eased somewhat but still many administrative hurdles were put in front of those wishing to leave. To prevent the outflow of foreign currency, tickets could only be purchased with money sent from abroad. The general need for an exit visa was finally abolished in 1961 after several court cases and Knesset decisions.|$|E

25|$|The {{decision}} to relieve General Stilwell represents the political triumph of a moribund, anti-democratic regime {{that is more}} concerned with maintaining its political supremacy than in driving the Japanese out of China. The Chinese Communists... have good armies that they are claiming <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fighting</b> guerrilla warfare against the Japanese in North China—actually they are covertly or even overtly building themselves up to fight Generalissimo's government forces... The Generalissimo naturally regards these armies as the chief threat to the country and his supremacy... has seen no need to make sincere attempt to arrange at least a truce with them {{for the duration of the}} war... No diplomatic genius could have overcome the Generalissimo's basic unwillingness to risk his armies in battle with the Japanese.|$|E
25|$|It {{has since}} been argued, that Svend Poulsen wasn't {{necessarily}} linked to Gønge at all. In the 109 primary sources pertaining to Svend Poulsen, only three mention the Gynge/Göinge name; none of these three are written by Svend Poulsen himself. Likewise, the men in his 1657 dragoon company were from Halland and not Gønge. The 1658 snaphane company on Zealand were made up of locals and did not contain any Gønge people, who served the army elsewhere. The authors of the 19th century historical accounts of Svend Poulsen were also unclear on the historicity of their claims, rehashing each other's myths and fictions, while transforming Svend Poulsen into a Gønge leader. His only documented link to Gønge prior to 1673, seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fighting</b> in Scania during the 1657–1658 Dano-Swedish War, {{in close proximity to}} Gønge.|$|E
25|$|The {{first ground}} attack {{came at the}} Battle of Umm Qasr on 21 March 2003 when a {{combined}} force of British, American and Polish forces seized control of {{the port city of}} Umm Qasr. Baghdad, Iraq's capital city, fell to American troops in April 2003 and Saddam Hussein's government quickly dissolved. On 1 May 2003, Bush announced that major combat operations in Iraq had ended. However, an insurgency arose against the U.S.-led coalition and the newly developing Iraqi military and post-Saddam government. The rebellion, which included al-Qaeda-affiliated groups, led to far more coalition casualties than the invasion. Other elements of the insurgency were led by fugitive members of President Hussein's Ba'ath regime, which included Iraqi nationalists and pan-Arabists. Many insurgency leaders are Islamists and claim <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>fighting</b> a religious war to reestablish the Islamic Caliphate of centuries past. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was captured by U.S. forces in December 2003. He was executed in 2006.|$|E
