5|$|Results of craniological {{analysis}} of 111 <b>tiger</b> skulls from Southeast Asian range countries indicate that Sumatran <b>tiger</b> skulls differ from Indochinese and Javan <b>tiger</b> skulls, whereas Bali <b>tiger</b> skulls {{are similar in}} size to Javan <b>tiger</b> skulls. The authors proposed to classify Sumatran and Javan <b>tiger</b> as distinct species, P. sumatrae and P. sondaica with Bali <b>tiger</b> as subspecies P. sondaica balica.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, morphological, {{ecological}} and molecular traits of all putative <b>tiger</b> subspecies were analysed in a combined approach. Results support distinction {{of the two}} evolutionary groups continental and Sunda tigers. The authors proposed recognition of only two subspecies, namely Panthera tigris tigris comprising the Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South Chinese, Siberian and Caspian <b>tiger</b> populations, and Panthera tigris sondaica comprising the Javan, Bali and Sumatran <b>tiger</b> populations. The authors also noted that this reclassification will affect <b>tiger</b> conservation management.|$|E

5|$|Since Carcharocles {{is derived}} from Otodus, and the two had teeth that bear a close {{similarity}} {{to those of the}} sand <b>tiger</b> shark (Carcharias taurus), megalodon may have had a build more similar to the sand <b>tiger</b> shark than to other sharks. However, this is unlikely since sand <b>tiger</b> sharks are axial swimmers that flex their body for propulsion, meaning that they are adapted for acceleration rather than for maintaining high cruising speeds. A large sand <b>tiger</b> shark would require large fins to propel itself, however this in itself would create more drag and offset efficiency, so it is unlikely that they had similar body shapes given how large megalodon was.|$|E
5|$|Six National Guardsmen arrive, led by Sergeant Winshiser (Aleks Paunovic), as does Colonel James Livingston-Graham (Ian D.

Sergeant Winshiser and his men arrogantly refuse to use the sheriff's advice and help. Graham tells the sheriff the soldiers will fail due to their arrogance {{and that he will}} start his hunt for the <b>tiger</b> when they finish. When the guardsmen search for the <b>tiger,</b> it kills one silently. Graham appears and explains how the <b>tiger</b> did it and helps them find the body. Later, Deputy Weinman and Deputy Ezra Hundt (Karl Thordarson), the mayor's son, find one of the National Guard trucks sitting empty on the road. They investigate and Weinman tells Hundt to call their position in to headquarters. She finds that the two guardsmen were attacked by the <b>tiger,</b> one being killed and the other shot by his partner. Hearing Hundt blowing the patrol car horn, she runs back to the car, but the <b>Tiger</b> has already killed him. Meanwhile, Roy encounters Graham in the woods and they discuss the <b>tiger.</b> When Roy asks if Graham is going to kill the <b>Tiger,</b> Graham tells him that he must because it can't chose not to hunt whatever is around it, including people. They shake hands and part ways with Graham continuing {{to the scene of the}} National Guard attack. When he arrives, he explains how the <b>tiger</b> attacked the guardsmen and deputy.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Tiger</b> II was {{developed}} {{late in the}} war and built in relatively small numbers. Orders were placed for 1,500 <b>Tiger</b> IIs — slightly more than the 1,347 <b>Tiger</b> I tanks produced — but production was severely disrupted by Allied bombing raids. Among others, five raids between 22 September and 7 October 1944 destroyed 95 percent of the floor area of the Henschel plant. It is estimated that this caused the loss in production of some 657 <b>Tiger</b> IIs. Only 492 units were produced: one in 1943, 379 in 1944, and 112 in 1945.
