5|$|After the work-in had finished, the {{boarding}} {{of the stone}} floor was completed and the mill <b>thoroughly</b> <b>cleaned</b> in preparation for an open day which was held in late autumn. The work done in 1981 cost £3,250. Donations received were £2,000 from Rank Xerox, £1,704 from the Historic Buildings Council and £130 from St Edmundsbury Borough Council. Other donations and income received amounted to £70. The project received further coverage in local media, the Eastern Daily Press, and South Norfolk News.|$|E
5|$|Because Armero's {{hospital}} {{was destroyed in}} the eruption, helicopters moved survivors to nearby hospitals. Six local towns set up makeshift emergency relief clinics, consisting of treatment areas and shelters for the homeless. To help with the treatment, physicians and rescue teams came {{from all over the}} country. Of the 1244 patients spread over the clinics, 150 died from infection or associated complications. Had antibiotics been readily available and all of their lacerations been <b>thoroughly</b> <b>cleaned,</b> many of these people could have been saved.|$|E

50|$|Note: Be sure {{to clean}} any {{residual}} paint from the hopper area. If it builds up, it {{can increase the}} chance of chopping a ball in the future. Q-tips work good for cleaning the hopper area. Also remember to <b>thoroughly</b> <b>clean</b> the barrel.|$|R
50|$|Colored dye or smudges {{can affect}} the {{perceived}} color of a gem. Historically, some jewelers' diamonds were mis-graded due to smudges on the girdle, or dye on the culet. Current practice is to <b>thoroughly</b> <b>clean</b> a gem before grading its color as well as clarity.|$|R
25|$|The {{cast-iron}} pedestal was restored in place atop the dome.

50|$|Polymers can be light, with {{resistance}} to the body's chemical reactions and can be safe against most allergies. However, many polymers are absorbent and have a porous surface, which makes it necessary to often take the jewelry out and <b>thoroughly</b> <b>clean</b> or replace it to avoid infection or sensitization from residues.|$|R
50|$|The product quickly grew to be {{the second}} best selling oven cleaner. The product's {{popularity}} was limited by the strong fumes it created, {{as well as the}} length of time required to <b>thoroughly</b> <b>clean.</b> Consumers were not thrilled at the prospect of awakening in the morning to the task of wiping chemicals, carbon, and grease out of their ovens. However, there is now one available for the public to view.|$|R
25|$|The Saga of Eric the Red relates {{that the}} {{settlers}} in Greenland c. 1000 were suffering {{a time of}} starvation. In order {{to prepare for the}} future, the vǫlva Þórbjǫrgr lítilvǫlva ("the little vǫlva") was summoned. Before her arrival the whole household was <b>thoroughly</b> <b>cleaned</b> and prepared. The high seat, which was otherwise reserved for the master and his wife, was furnished with down pillows.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the house}} is assumed to have been <b>thoroughly</b> <b>cleaned</b> by the night before Passover, there is some concern that making a blessing over the search for chametz will be in vain (bracha l'vatala) if nothing is found. Thus, 10 morsels of bread or cereal smaller than {{the size of an}} olive are {{traditionally}} hidden throughout the house {{in order to ensure that}} some chametz will be found.|$|E
25|$|The {{antiseptic}} {{properties of}} phenol {{were used by}} Sir Joseph Lister (1827–1912) in his pioneering technique of antiseptic surgery. Lister decided that the wounds themselves had to be <b>thoroughly</b> <b>cleaned.</b> He then covered the wounds {{with a piece of}} rag or lint covered in phenol, or carbolic acid as he called it. The skin irritation caused by continual exposure to phenol eventually led to the introduction of aseptic (anti-septic, germ-free) techniques in surgery.|$|E
5000|$|Chrome Peel is a {{condition}} which occurs when the chrome coating of a wheel, usually that of an automobile, disintegrates {{in the area where}} the tire is bound to the wheel. Gradually the air escapes and a slow leak of pressure from the tire occurs. A common cause is failure to <b>thoroughly</b> <b>clean</b> the inside of the wheel and tire after the usage of emergency tire inflation applications such as [...] "Fix-A-Flat." ...|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, the Catholic church <b>thoroughly</b> <b>cleans</b> {{the church}} altar and {{everything}} {{associated with it}} on Maundy Thursday, the day before Good Friday, in the Spring. Spring cleaning persists today in Greece, and other Orthodox nations. It is traditional to <b>clean</b> the house <b>thoroughly</b> either right before or {{during the first week}} of Great Lent, which is referred to as Clean Week. This also often corresponds with the Julian New Year, or April 1.|$|R
50|$|Compurgation, {{also called}} wager {{of law and}} oath-helping, was a defence used {{primarily}} in medieval law. A defendant could establish his innocence or nonliability by taking an oath and by getting a required number of persons, typically twelve, to swear they believed the defendant's oath. From Latin, com = with, purgare = make clean, cleanse, excuse.Latin com is also an intensifier and turns a word into the superlative form, so compurgation, by etymology, means 'to <b>thoroughly</b> <b>clean</b> or excuse'.|$|R
25|$|Passover (Pesach) is {{a week-long}} holiday {{beginning}} {{on the evening}} of the 14th day of Nisan (the first month in the Hebrew calendar), that commemorates the Exodus from Egypt. Outside Israel, Passover is celebrated for eight days. In ancient times, it coincided with the barley harvest. It is the only holiday that centers on home-service, the Seder. Leavened products (chametz) are removed from the house prior to the holiday and are not consumed throughout the week. Homes are <b>thoroughly</b> <b>cleaned</b> to ensure no bread or bread by-products remain, and a symbolic burning of the last vestiges of chametz is conducted {{on the morning of the}} Seder. Matzo is eaten instead of bread.|$|E

25|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the Muslim conquest of Jerusalem in 638 CE, Caliph 'Omar ibn al Khatab, disgusted by the filth covering the site, had it <b>thoroughly</b> <b>cleaned,</b> and granted Jews access to the site. Among Sunni Muslims, the Mount is widely considered the third holiest site in Islam. Revered as the Noble Sanctuary, the location of Muhammad's journey to Jerusalem and ascent to heaven, the site is also associated with Jewish biblical prophets who are also venerated in Islam. Muslims preferred to use the esplanade as the heart for the Muslim quarter, since it had been abandoned by Christians, to avoid disturbing the Christian quarters of Jerusalem. Umayyad Caliphs commissioned {{the construction of the}} al-Aqsa Mosque and Dome of the Rock on the site. The Dome was completed in 692 CE, {{making it one of the}} oldest extant Islamic structures in the world. The Al Aqsa Mosque rests on the far southern side of the Mount, facing Mecca. The Dome of the Rock currently sits in the middle, occupying or close to the area where the Holy Temple previously stood.|$|E

500|$|In February 1917, Horthy began {{preparations}} {{for a major}} raid on the drifters; he planned to use Novara and both of her sisters, which he modified to look like large British destroyers by cutting down their mainmasts. Each of the ships also received a 7cm anti-aircraft gun, and their engines were <b>thoroughly</b> <b>cleaned</b> and repaired. While the preparations were being made in late April and early May, destroyers made several sweeps down to the coast of Albania to reconnoiter the Entente defenses in the area; they found none. On 13 May, Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) Alexander Hansa issued the order to begin the operation the following morning. The three cruisers steamed south to the drifter line, arriving after night fall; at the same time, a pair of destroyers, [...] and , mounted a diversionary attack {{off the coast of}} Albania. At around 03:30 on 15 May, Novara and the other cruisers opened fire on the drifters, sinking fourteen and damaging four more before they broke off the attack and withdrew, hoping to return to port before Entente forces could react.|$|E
500|$|Shemanski {{petitioned the}} City Council {{to let him}} gift the fountain, which began {{operating}} on September 3, 1926. In 1987, the fountain's plumbing was repaired and a new base was poured {{as part of a}} renovation of the South Park Blocks. That same year, Logan and two other men—David L. Lipman and Jeff Wolfstone, grandson and great-grandson of Shemanski, respectively—approached the Portland Bureau of Parks and Recreation, advocating for the fountain's restoration. During the renovation process, the fountain was <b>thoroughly</b> <b>cleaned,</b> had missing pieces such as finials and urns replaced and chipped corners repaired, and was coated with a sealant to protect it from the elements and graffiti. In July 1988, the fountain re-opened following nearly a year of reconditioning. A dedication ceremony to mark the restoration was held on the afternoon of July 18. One park designer with the Park Bureau said, [...] "the water will be turned on {{for the first time that}} anybody can remember." [...] Lipman, Logan and Wolfstone attended the ceremony. Logan, aged 88, was the only surviving person who participated in the fountain's design and construction. The men offered funds for part of the renovation and the purchase of a bronze plaque that includes the original rendering done by Logan and describes the fountain's history and recent work. Costs for the plaque and renovation totaled $14,000.|$|E

50|$|A common {{inference}} made {{by scientists}} {{predicts that the}} zebra mussel will continue spreading passively, by ship and by pleasure craft, to more rivers in North America.
