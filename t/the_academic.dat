40|$|The main {{objective}} of this pilot study was to obtain preliminary data for the main study. In the paper, the perception of <b>the</b> <b>academics</b> at a Malaysian university college on {{the transformation of the}} university college towards university was examined using a questionnaire developed for the purpose of the study. The questionnaire items were utilized to examine the perception of <b>the</b> <b>academics</b> on <b>the</b> problems in eight main areas including performance management and promotion; role overload, role conflict or both; financial remuneration; research and teaching; work uncertainty; training and development; equipment and working conditions and leadership and governance. Other sections of the questionnaire also investigate the effects of the problems to <b>the</b> <b>academics</b> and supports provided. The results revealed that majority of <b>the</b> <b>academics</b> faced problems in five main areas related to their work scope as teachers and researchers. They also agreed that the problems affect them in achieving personal and university institutional KPI, their teaching and research workload, motivation and job satisfaction. In fact, supports were provided by the management to <b>the</b> <b>academics</b> for <b>the</b> development of six elements. However, the results prove that there were room for improvements on the supports provided by the management of the university college so that <b>the</b> <b>academics</b> are able to perform and achieve more their personal and institutional key performance indicators...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{addresses}} the epistemological challenges facing South African Public Universities {{in light of}} the #FeesMustFall campaign and the associated outcomes. Of particular interest are <b>the</b> <b>academics</b> who are to embrace the changes while they remain in the education system. The decolonisation of knowledge, which is still not clearly understood nor agreed upon, necessitates a rapid review of the status quo in the major universities and how they conduct their business. While transformation and decolonisation are not synonymous, the universities will be undergoing transformation to address the decolonisation needs of the majority of its students, which has already created dilemmas for <b>the</b> <b>academics</b> who have largely followed a Eurocentric approach, and are now to implement the changes addressing decolonisation. The immediate aspects facing <b>the</b> <b>academics</b> are <b>the</b> undefined curriculum changes, as well as the new teaching and learning strategies, which need to reflect the epistemology of the students addressing an Afrocentricity that has not been embraced in the past. A cybernetic perspective relying on Pask’s Conversation Theory may be integral in allowing <b>the</b> <b>academics</b> <b>the</b> skill to contextualise the curriculum, embracing those who are the consumers of this new co-created locally generated knowledge...|$|R
