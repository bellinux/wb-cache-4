5|$|Life at the Bottom: The Worldview That Makes <b>the</b> <b>Underclass</b> is a {{collection}} of essays written by British writer, doctor, and psychiatrist Theodore Dalrymple and published in book form by Ivan R. Dee in 2001. In 1994, the Manhattan Institute started publishing the contents of these essays in the City Journal magazine. They are about personal , the mentality of society as a whole, and the troubles of <b>the</b> <b>underclass.</b> Dalrymple had problems in finding a British publisher to help him turn his individual essays into {{a collection}}, so he eventually turned to American companies for publication.|$|E

Thousands quickly fled, although nearly all were unable to. The press initially stoked these peoples' fears, although they later flipped to lionizing the rebels, portraying them as heroes.|$|E

40|$|This {{book was}} passed as a PhD thesis at Bayreuth University, Germany. The author {{challenges}} African Biblical scholars and Christian leaders to premise Biblical interpretation on {{the experiences of}} <b>the</b> often neglected <b>underclasses.</b> <b>The</b> author argues that from a comparative historical, cultural and material methodological point of view, the experiences of <b>the</b> Zimbabwean <b>underclasses</b> whose collective ordeal {{is represented by the}} experiences of domestic workers are strikingly similar to those suffered by slaves among other <b>underclasses</b> in <b>the</b> biblical world. In the same way religion was appropriated by the elite to validate oppression of <b>the</b> <b>underclasses</b> in <b>the</b> biblical world, the author shows that since the colonial era, Christianity in Africa, through biblical interpretation among many other tactics has been an influential force {{on the side of the}} dominant class to advance their racial, class and gender interests. To date, in Zimbabwe for example, the Bible (and religion in general) is manipulated by the dominant minority to justify and entrench the exploitation of <b>the</b> majority <b>underclasses.</b> On <b>the</b> other hand, the author observes that the history of ancient Israel, Roman colonial Palestine and colonial Zimbabwe evidences that when religion is appropriated (and/or the Bible is read and interpreted) from the historical cultural and material conditions of <b>the</b> <b>underclasses,</b> it can be a valuable resource not only for their mobilization to overthrow oppressive systems but also for justifying their resistance tactics.

5|$|Fonseca and the navy's {{high command}} {{were faced with}} two {{extremely}} unpalatable choices. They could use the government-controlled ships to attack and possibly destroy the rebel ships, but doing so would mean destroying three incredibly expensive ships that had received significant global attention and were—in their eyes—a crucial part of refashioning Brazil as a serious international power. Worse, {{there was a significant}} chance that the remaining Brazilian ships, all of which were smaller and much older than the ships controlled by the mutineers, would lose if it came to open combat. But by folding and giving into the rebel's list of demands—that is, demands from <b>the</b> <b>underclass</b> and broadly black naval crews—the elites would suffer an incredible embarrassment.|$|E
5|$|Rather {{than the}} typical anarchist interpretation, others have {{analysed}} the character as a Marxist (opposite to Batman's capitalist), arguing that anarchism requires the rejection of all authority in favor of uncontrolled freedom. The Joker rejects most authority, but retains his own, using his actions to coerce and consolidate power in himself and convert the masses to his own way of thinking, while eliminating any that oppose him. In The Killing Joke, the Joker is an abused member of <b>the</b> <b>underclass</b> who is driven insane by failings of the social system. The Joker rejects material needs, and his first appearance in Batman #1 sees him perpetrate crimes against Gotham's wealthiest men and the judge who had sent him to prison. Batman is wealthy, yet the Joker is able to triumph through his own innovations.|$|E

25|$|The {{frequency}} of lynchings rose during years of poor economy and low prices for cotton, demonstrating {{that more than}} social tensions generated the catalysts for mob action against <b>the</b> <b>underclass.</b> Researchers have studied various models to determine what motivated lynchings. One study of lynching rates of blacks in southern counties between 1889 and 1931 found a relation to the concentration of blacks {{in parts of the}} Deep South; where black population was concentrated, lynching rates were higher. Such areas also had a particular mix of socioeconomic conditions, with a high dependence on cotton cultivation.|$|E
25|$|Massey and Denton {{propose that}} the {{fundamental}} cause of poverty among African Americans is segregation. This segregation has created the inner city black urban ghettos that create poverty traps and keep blacks {{from being able to}} escape <b>the</b> <b>underclass.</b> It is sometimes claimed that these neighborhoods have institutionalized an inner city black culture that is negatively stigmatized and purports the economic situation of the black community. Sociolinguist, William Labov argues that persistent segregation supports the use of African American English (AAE) while endangering its speakers. Although AAE is stigmatized, sociolinguists who study it note that it is a legitimate dialect of English as systematic as any other. Arthur Spears argues that there is no inherent educational disadvantage in speaking AAE and that it exists in vernacular and more standard forms.|$|E

25|$|The {{remaining}} cadets {{choose the}} Citizen-Leader Track to pursue civilian careers or officer training or officer candidate training programs after graduation, or attend professional or graduate schools. Eighty-three {{percent of the}} Citizen-Leader Track cadets had a job or graduate school offer in hand upon graduation in May 2016. Recently, Northrop Grumman funded six scholarships for Citizen-Leader Track cadets or Military-Leader Track cadets not on scholarship which included an opportunity to intern with Northrop Grumman as well. Citizen-Leader Track cadets participate in an exercise called Job-Ex, where the junior and senior cadets learn to write a job description, freshman and sophomore cadets apply to those jobs, the upperclass cadets review them, and then they conduct panel interviews with <b>the</b> <b>underclass</b> cadets, so they can learn from their peers what is successful in an job interview. The upperclass cadets learn what interviewers expect, so they can improve their interviewing skills as well. The Rice Center Board of Advisors, made up from executives from organizations like Northrop Grumman, Union Pacific, Dell, the Defense Intelligence Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigations, advise the Corps staff on curriculum and skill sets cadets need to develop to be more employable after graduation.|$|E
500|$|The main {{argument}} {{represented in}} the collection is that, rather than economics and wealth, modern-style poverty is described by a [...] "wildly dysfunctional set of values". A number of chapters discuss the [...] "ferocious young egoist" [...] that is meant to represent male youths who are violent and obsessive toward their significant others. Dalrymple also writes about his views on the [...] "destruction of...family ties", arguing that without family ties {{it is nearly impossible}} to rise out of <b>the</b> <b>underclass.</b> These issues, among others, are described as resulting from the [...] "intellectual foundation... makes a permanent underclass possible". This is meant to be directed against intellectuals and liberals that form the many ideas absorbed into the mentality of <b>the</b> <b>underclass.</b>|$|E
500|$|In {{the larger}} first section titled [...] "Grim Reality", Dalrymple [...] "uses {{specific}} stories from his practice and from some journalistic forays {{to show how}} the 'fundamental premise of popular culture' leads to actions that wreck people's lives." [...] This section covers things like modern Bohemianism, drug addictions and overdoses, lack of education, familial obligations, physical abuse, and the concept of personal responsibility for choices made. Then, in the section [...] "Grimmer Theory", he [...] "shows that the twentieth century's intellectuals have provided members of <b>the</b> <b>underclass</b> with a battery of rationalizations by which they can shift the blame for their misery away from their actions and attitudes and can unleash their hatred of everyone who challenges their outlook.". Focusing on ideas more than events, this section considers the concepts of relativism, determinism, and egalitarianism, and how each idea, in their creation by the bourgeoisie intellectuals, adversely affects <b>the</b> <b>underclass.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Since the 1960s, {{critics of}} culture of poverty {{explanations}} for the persistence of <b>the</b> <b>underclasses</b> have attempted to show that real world data do not fit Lewis's model (Goode and Eames, 1996). In 1974, anthropologist Carol Stack issued a critique of it, calling it [...] "fatalistic" [...] and noticing the way that believing {{in the idea of}} a culture of poverty does not describe the poor so much as it serves the interests of the rich.|$|R

500|$|In 2006 a {{group of}} left-wing activists calling itself [...] "Hamburg for Free" [...] dressed as superheroes, robbing food from upper-class stores to {{distribute}} to <b>the</b> <b>underclass.</b> The media considered the crimes inspired by the film, and some protesters had T-shirts and banners reading [...] "Die fetten Jahre sind vorbei" [...] (The Edukators original title). In 2009, a statue stolen from Bernard Madoff was returned with a note ("Bernie the Swindler, Lesson: Return stolen property to rightful owners") signed by [...] "The Educators".|$|E
500|$|The {{experiences}} and situations described are largely anecdotal, but Dalrymple {{explains that he}} interviewed over 10,000 people who attempted suicide and had them tell stories about [...] "the lives {{of four or five}} other people", resulting in a sample base of around 50,000 individuals. Since he is writing about the English underclass, Dalrymple acknowledges {{that the majority of the}} people interviewed, remembered, and discussed about are white. According to social critic Thomas Sowell, this allows a look at <b>the</b> <b>underclass</b> [...] "without fear of being called 'racist'." ...|$|E
500|$|The work {{explores the}} various worldviews of {{individuals}} and societies, and the impositions of society on those within it. Dalrymple states that [...] "...everyone has a Weltanschauung, a worldview, whether he knows it or not...Their ideas make themselves manifest even in the language they use." [...] The example stated {{is the use of}} passive speech by [...] "those who refuse to accept responsibility for their acts". The type of language that <b>the</b> <b>underclass</b> uses, according to Dalrymple, professes their own ideas and ideology about the world.|$|E
5000|$|Finally, Schippel and Hicketier {{exchange}} a long silence, before the latter offers {{a complete and}} honest apology for his behaviour, welcoming him to {{the ranks of the}} middle classes and finally bringing himself to call the other man by his name, raising his hat and saying [...] "goodbye, dear Mr. Schippel". Left alone, Schippel's transformation is complete; he has escaped the realm of <b>the</b> <b>underclasses,</b> and joined those who had long considered themselves his betters. For {{the first time in his}} life, he is truly happy.|$|R

500|$|An {{important}} subset to this deterministic theme, {{related to}} the original worldview idea as well, {{is the lack of}} personal responsibility that those in <b>the</b> <b>underclass</b> accept for their own actions. An example of this, which is repeated numerous times throughout the collection, is the statement, [...] "The knife went in", in reference to the words of one of Dalrymple's patients who was in jail for murder. This sort of speech makes a person's actions seem like they are something separate from the person themselves and that they have no control over it.|$|E
500|$|The {{collection}} of essays has an introduction, an index, and two sections called [...] "Grim Reality" [...] and [...] "Grimmer Theory". The sections are individually broken up into chapters, with sixteen in [...] "Grim Reality" [...] and six in [...] "Grimmer Theory". Each chapter is an individual essay, which were published in separate issues of City Journal around seven years prior. The chapters are organised thematically, not necessarily in chronological order. The essays focus largely on <b>the</b> <b>underclass</b> and the premise that {{in the latter half}} of the 20th century, poverty, and hunger are no longer descriptive of the poor. Instead, lack of money has been replaced with [...] "emptiness, agonies, violence, and moral squalor".|$|E
500|$|In July 1897, Du Bois left Philadelphia {{and took}} a {{professorship}} in history and economics at the historically black Atlanta University in Georgia.Lewis, pp. 143, 155. His first major academic work was his book The Philadelphia Negro (1899), a detailed and comprehensive sociological study of the African-American people of Philadelphia, based on the field work he did in 1896–1897. The work was a breakthrough in scholarship, {{because it was the}} first scientific study of African Americans and a major contribution to early scientific sociology in the U.S. In the study, Du Bois coined the phrase [...] "the submerged tenth" [...] to describe the black underclass. Later in 1903 he popularized the term, the [...] "Talented Tenth", applied to society's elite class. Du Bois's terminology reflected his opinion that the elite of a nation, both black and white, was critical to achievements in culture and progress. Du Bois wrote in this period in a dismissive way of <b>the</b> <b>underclass,</b> describing them as [...] "lazy" [...] or [...] "unreliable", but– in contrast to other scholars– he attributed many of their societal problems to the ravages of slavery.|$|E
5000|$|Critical {{response}} to Pedestrian Verse has been positive.
