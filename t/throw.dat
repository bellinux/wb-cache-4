The stipulations stated {{that the only way}} to win was to force the person in your opponent's corner to <b>throw</b> a towel into the ring. Davey Boy Smith was in Bret's corner, while Owen Hart was in Backlund's corner. Smith chased Owen around the ring until Smith suffered a kayfabe injury, leaving nobody to <b>throw</b> in Bret's towel. As Backlund performed the crossface chickenwing on Bret, Owen pretended to show remorse. He convinced his mother, Helen, to <b>throw</b> in Bret's towel.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to clarify the possibility of progress of <b>throwing</b> ability on adult females, and to examine effective instructional methods of <b>throwing.</b> Twenty-four female students who had no special experiences of motor learning of <b>throwing</b> were divided into three groups; two training groups (WI group: <b>throwing</b> exercise with verbal instruction and demonstration, and NI group: <b>throwing</b> exercise without instruction) and one control group. Training was carried out three days per week for four weeks. Measuring physical fitness and analyzing <b>throwing</b> motions were performed before and after the training period. In the WI group, <b>throwing</b> distance increased significantly from 24. 38 m to 30. 38 m. Actions of arm and legs during preparatory phase of <b>throwing</b> were changed, consequently factors of action at starting of main phase of <b>throwing</b> were also changed. It seemed that these changes leaded to faster forward rotation of shoulder during main phase of <b>throwing,</b> skillful whip-like action and wrist action. In the NI group, <b>throwing</b> distance increased from 24. 67 m to 27. 17 m insignificantly. Remarkable changes of <b>throwing</b> motions were not recognized except for the increase of range of shoulder rotation. It is concluded that <b>throwing</b> distance and <b>throwing</b> motion are changed remarkably by <b>throwing</b> exercise with proper instructions of technique...|$|R

5|$|Discus {{is one of}} {{the events}} where the athlete has to <b>throw</b> a heavy disc in the attempt to mark a farther {{distance}} than their competitors. As one of the events within the ancient pentathlon, the history of the discus <b>throw</b> dates back to 708 BC. In ancient times a heavy circular disc was thrown from a set standing position on a small pedestal, and it was this style that was revived for the 1896 Olympics. This continued until the 1906 Intercalated Games in Athens, which featured both the ancient style and the increasingly popular modern style of turning and throwing. By the 1912 Olympics, the ancient standing <b>throw</b> style had fallen into disuse and contests starting within a 2.5m squared throwing area became the standard. The discus implement was standardised to 2kg (4.4pounds) in weight and 22cm (8inches) in diameter in 1907. The women's discus was among the first women's events on the Olympic programme, being introduced in 1928., although they had been competing at some national and regional levels previously.The first modern athlete to <b>throw</b> the discus while rotating the whole body was Czech athlete Frantisek Janda-Suk. He invented the technique when studying the position of the famous statue of Discobolus.|$|E
