5|$|A new Baroque {{building}} was constructed on {{site of the}} first Castellania by the same Grand Master, creating significant employment as Pinto had hoped for, with works commencing in 1757. Throughout the course of construction, prisoners were held in a torre near Valletta's Porta Reale, probably the tower of Saint James Cavalier. The new Castellania was built to a design by the architect Francesco Zerafa, but he died before its completion, so he was substituted by the architect Giuseppe Bonici. Zerafa is accredited for the main design, and for the subjected building he has post mortem {{established himself as a}} respected architect. The edifice was completed in 1760, with its chapel being consecrated on 15 November of that year. As a general rule, buildings in Valletta were required <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> within three-years period from start to completion. The prisoners were transferred to the new prison three days later, on 18 November 1760.|$|E
5|$|By 24–28days after hatching, {{the young}} birds start to perch on {{branches}} near the nest {{and take their}} first flight. They are fed by their parents for a further 28–30days, staying close to the nest while growing and practicing flying. At this stage they are extremely vocal, and their cries to their parents can often be heard a considerable distance away. The young hawks disperse after their parents stop provisioning them. Though they receive {{the same amount of}} food, male chicks (roughly half the size of females) mature more quickly and seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> to leave the nest sooner. In a study in the Forest of Ae, south-west Scotland, it was found that 21% of nestlings over two days old died, with the causes of death being starvation, wet weather, predation and desertion by the parents. The parasite Leucocytozoon toddi can be passed from parent to nestling at the nest, possibly {{because of the number of}} birds sharing a small space, thus allowing transmission.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1944 the 4th Armoured Brigade {{was located}} in Southport, Queensland. As of 1 June, the brigade had a {{strength}} of 4,719 men and was scheduled <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>ready</b> for offensive operations by October that year. During June it also established a training area at Nerang in Queensland, where armoured units could practice operating in tropical conditions. In September 1944 the brigade gained the 2/1st Armoured Brigade Reconnaissance Squadron when the 1st Armoured Brigade Group was disbanded; this unit was reorganised to become the Armoured Squadron (Special Equipment) in January 1945. The 2/6th Armoured Regiment was also reassigned to the 4th Armoured Brigade, but was stationed in the Sydney area. Following the disbandment of the 1st Armoured Brigade Group the 4th Armoured Brigade was the last remaining armoured brigade in the Australian Army.|$|E
