The annual <b>tax</b> <b>payable</b> had spiralled and was twenty {{times greater than}} in 1870 {{resulting}} in the break-up of many larger land-holdings. Pitfour was no exception and the dispersal of the estate continued piecemeal after the sequestration of George Arthur, the sixth laird.

25|$|Several charges {{described}} as taxes are not, in the literal sense, actual taxes, but withholdings from certain payments made. In each case, the payer withholds the relevant percentage and pays it to Revenue. The recipient is still liable for {{tax on the}} full amount, but can set the withholding against his overall tax liability. If the amount withheld {{is less than the}} <b>tax</b> <b>payable,</b> the recipient is still liable for the difference, and if the amount withheld exceeds the <b>tax</b> <b>payable,</b> the recipient can set it off against other tax due, or obtain a refund. This contrasts with DIRT, which, while a withholding tax, discharges the entire tax liability of the recipient.|$|E

40|$|The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) has {{undertaken}} research on accounting for income taxes. The IASB {{research suggests that}} a fundamental change from International Accounting Standard 12 : Income Taxes (IAS 12), the balance sheet method, to another method may be considered. Other methods for accounting for deferred tax include the <b>taxes</b> <b>payable</b> method, the comprehensive basis under the income statement method, and the partial basis under the income statement method. This thesis provides evidence on this issue by using non-United States data to examine these deferred tax methods. This thesis examines the research question “are deferred tax methods, relative to the <b>taxes</b> <b>payable</b> method, information relevant?” Information that is ‘information relevant’ has two components: predictability and value relevance (Ohlson, 1995). The predictability of deferred tax methods is measured by its ability to predict future tax payments relative to the <b>taxes</b> <b>payable</b> method. The value relevance of deferred tax methods is measured by its association with share price relative to the <b>taxes</b> <b>payable</b> method. Literature examining deferred taxes predominately uses United States US data and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP), and only partially examines deferred tax methods. This thesis {{contributes to the literature}} by examining all three deferred tax line items: deferred tax liabilities, deferred tax assets and deferred tax expense. The data is collected from the financial information for firms listed on the NZ Stock Exchange. Two samples of firms are examined: from 2000 to 2004 (pre IFRS) and 2008 to 2012 (post IFRS). The results show that the comprehensive basis under the income statement method is a better predictor of future tax payments and is value relevant relative to the <b>taxes</b> <b>payable</b> method. This indicates that it is information relevant. The partial basis under the income statement method is a better predictor of future tax payments relative to the <b>taxes</b> <b>payable</b> method however it is only value relevant for firms in the highest three deciles of mean increases in tax paid over the period. The balance sheet method is not a better predictor of future tax payments relative to the <b>taxes</b> <b>payable</b> method. The balance sheet method is, however, value relevant. The balance sheet method using disaggregated deferred tax is also value relevant relative to the balance sheet method...|$|R

25|$|The Isle of Man is a low-tax {{economy with}} no capital gains tax, wealth tax, stamp duty, or {{inheritance}} tax {{and a top}} rate of income tax of 20%. A tax cap is in force; {{the maximum amount of}} <b>tax</b> <b>payable</b> by an individual is £120,000 or £240,000 for couples if they choose to have their incomes jointly assessed. The £120,000 tax cap equates to an assessable income of £589,550. Personal income is assessed and taxed on a total worldwide income basis rather than a remittance basis. This means that all income earned throughout the world is assessable for Manx tax rather than only income earned in or brought into the Island.|$|E

50|$|As a {{consequence}} of this increased demand, some distillers prioritized quantity over quality, {{to the detriment of}} their product. This prompted parliament to pass an Act in 1759 prohibiting distillers from using any ingredient other than malt, grain, potatoes or sugar in the production of whiskey, and specifically prohibiting several unsavory ingredients. Another consequence, was that the potential revenue lost to the exchequer through the under-reporting of output at legal distilleries, and the tax avoidance of illicit producers became more significant, prompting parliament to introduce another Act of Parliament. This was enacted in 1779 and significantly reformed how the <b>taxes</b> <b>payable</b> on whiskey production were calculated. Previously, <b>taxes</b> were <b>payable</b> on production volumes, which were subject to manipulation. However, this Act removed the potential for under-reporting by making <b>taxes</b> <b>payable</b> on a distillery's potential output (based on the capacity of its pot stills), rather than its actual, or reported output. In addition, the Act penalised smaller distillers in an attempt to reduce reporting fraud.|$|R

500|$|The Ottomans {{attacked}} Transylvania {{almost every}} year starting in 1420. The peasants {{had to pay}} the increasing costs for defence against the Ottomans. They were regularly obliged to pay [...] "extraordinary taxes" [...] {{in addition to the}} chamber's profit (the traditional <b>tax</b> <b>payable</b> by each peasant household to the royal treasury). The king also ordered that every tenth peasant should take up arms in case of an Ottoman attack, although peasants had always been exempt from military obligations. The accommodation of the troops was also an irksome duty, because the soldiers often forced the peasants to supply them with food and clothes. The landowners also began to collect the ninth from the peasants. Although the ninth had already been introduced in 1351, it was not regularly collected in Transylvania. The noblemen also made attempts to hinder the free movement of their serfs.|$|E
500|$|Over {{most of this}} period, Banat, Crişana, Maramureş and Transylvania –now {{regions in}} Romania {{to the west of}} the Carpathian Mountains– were part of the Kingdom of Hungary. They were divided into several types of {{administrative}} units, such as [...] "counties" [...] and [...] "seats". The heads of the Transylvanian counties or [...] "counts" [...] were subordinated to a special royal official called voivode, but the province was seldom treated as a single unit, since the Székely and Saxon seats were administered separately. In the kingdom, Romanian peasants, being Orthodox, were exempt from the tithe, an ecclesiastical <b>tax</b> <b>payable</b> by all Roman Catholic commoners. However, Romanian noblemen slowly lost the ability to participate in political life, as the 14th-century monarchs pursued a zealous pro-Catholic policy.

2500|$|Starting {{from the}} mid-1980s, Cuba {{experienced}} a crisis {{referred to as}} the [...] "Special Period". When the Soviet Union, the country's primary source of trade, was dissolved in late 1991, a major supporter of Cuba's economy was lost, leaving it essentially paralyzed because of the economy's narrow basis, focused on just a few products with just a few buyers. National oil supplies, which were mostly imported, were severely reduced. Over 80% of Cuba's trade was lost and living conditions declined. A [...] "Special Period in Peacetime" [...] was declared, which included cutbacks on transport and electricity and even food rationing. In response, the United States tightened up its trade embargo, hoping it would lead to Castro's downfall. But the government tapped into a pre-revolutionary source of income and opened the country to tourism, entering into several joint ventures with foreign companies for hotel, agricultural and industrial projects. As a result, the use of U.S. dollars was legalized in 1994, with special stores being opened which only sold in dollars. There were two separate economies, dollar-economy and the peso-economy, creating a social split in the island because those in the dollar-economy made much more money (as in the tourist-industry). However, in October 2004, the Cuban government announced an end to this policy: from November U.S. dollars would no longer be legal tender in Cuba, but would instead be exchanged for convertible pesos (since April 2005 at the exchange rate of $1.08) with a 10% <b>tax</b> <b>payable</b> to the state on the exchange of U.S. dollars cash though not on other forms of exchange.|$|E
2500|$|Due to the {{profitable}} Slave Trade and {{the high}} quality of Nevisian sugar cane, the island soon became a dominant source of wealth for Great Britain and the slave-owning British plantocracy. When the Leeward Islands were separated from Barbados in 1671, Nevis became {{the seat of the}} Leeward Islands colony and was given the nickname [...] "Queen of the Caribees". It remained colonial capital for the Leeward Islands until the seat was transferred to Antigua for military reasons in 1698. During this period, Nevis was the richest of the British Leeward Islands. The island outranked larger islands like Jamaica in sugar production in the late 17th century. The wealth of the planters on the island is evident in the tax records preserved at the Calendar State Papers in the British Colonial Office Public Records, where the amount of tax collected on the Leeward Islands was recorded. The sums recorded for 1676 as [...] "head tax on slaves", a <b>tax</b> <b>payable</b> in sugar, amounted to 384,600 pounds in Nevis, as opposed to 67,000 each in Antigua and Saint Kitts, 62,500 in Montserrat, and 5,500 total in the other five islands. [...] The profits on sugar cultivation in Nevis was enhanced {{by the fact that the}} cane juice from Nevis yielded an unusually high amount of sugar. A gallon (3.79 litres) of cane juice from Nevis yielded 24 ounces (0.71 litres) of sugar, whereas a gallon from Saint Kitts yielded 16 ounces (0.47 litres). Twenty percent of the British Empire's total sugar production in 1700 was derived from Nevisian plantations. Exports from West Indian colonies like Nevis were worth more than all the exports from all the mainland Thirteen Colonies of North America combined at the time of the American Revolution.|$|E
