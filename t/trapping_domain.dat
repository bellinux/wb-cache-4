40|$|We {{construct}} an explicit model of gravity <b>trapping</b> <b>domain</b> wall potential where {{for the first}} time we can study explicitly the graviton wave function fluctuations for any thickness of the domain wall. A concrete form of the potential depends on one parameter 0 0 and x -> pi/ 2 corresponding to the thin and the thick wall, respectively. The analysis of the continuum Kaluza Klein fluctuations yields explicit expressions for both the small and large Kaluza Klein energy. We also derive specific explicit conditions in the regime x > 1, for which the fluctuation modes exhibit a resonance behaviour, and which could sizably affect the modifications of the four-dimensional Newton's law at distances, which typically are by four orders of magnitude larger than those relevant for Newton's law modifications of thin walls.

40|$|We {{consider}} the possibility of particles being injected at {{the interior of a}} reconnecting current sheet (RCS), and study their orbits by dynamical systems methods. As an example we consider orbits in a 3 D Harris type RCS. We find that, despite the presence of a strong electric field, a ‘mirror ’ trapping effect persists, to a certain extent, for orbits with appropriate initial conditions within the sheet. The mirror effect is stronger for electrons than for protons. In summary, three types of orbits are distinguished: (i) chaotic orbits leading to escape by stochastic acceleration, (ii) regular orbits leading to escape along the field lines of the reconnecting magnetic component, and (iii) mirror-type regular orbits that are trapped in the sheet, making mirror oscillations. Dynamically, the latter orbits lie on a set of invariant KAM tori that occupy a considerable amount of the phase space of the motion of the particles. We also observe the phenomenon of ‘stickiness’, namely chaotic orbits that remain trapped in the sheet for a considerable time. A <b>trapping</b> <b>domain,</b> related to the boundary of mirror motions in velocity space, is calculated analytically. Analytical formulae are derived for the kinetic energy gain in regular or chaotic escaping orbits. The analytical results are compared with numerical simulations.

40|$|Coercivity is an {{important}} concept for proving existence and uniqueness of solutions to variational problems in Hilbert spaces. But while coercivity estimates are well known for many variational problems arising from partial differential equations, they are still an open problem {{in the context of}} boundary integral operators arising from acoustic scattering problems, where rigorous coercivity results have so far only been established for combined integral operators on the unit circle and sphere. The fact that coercivity holds, even in these special cases, is perhaps surprising, as formulations of Helmholtz problems are generally thought to be indefinite. The main motivation for investigating coercivity in this context is that {{it has the potential to}} give error estimates for the Galerkin method which are both explicit in the wavenumber $k$ and valid regardless of the approximation space used, thus they apply to hybrid asymptotic-numerical methods recently developed for the high frequency case. One way to interpret coercivity is by considering the numerical range of the operator. The numerical range is a well established tool in spectral theory and algorithms exist to approximate the numerical range of finite dimensional matrices. We can therefore use Galerkin projections of the boundary integral operators to approximate the numerical range of the original operator. We prove convergence estimates for the numerical range of Galerkin projections of a general bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space to justify this approach. By computing the numerical range of the combined integral operator in acoustic scattering for several interesting convex, nonconvex, smooth, and polygonal domains, we numerically study coercivity estimates for varying wavenumbers. We find that coercivity holds, uniformly in the wavenumber $k$, for a wide variety of domains. Finally, we consider a <b>trapping</b> <b>domain,</b> for which there exist resonances (also called scattering poles) very close to the real line, to demonstrate that coercivity for a certain wavenumber $k$ seems to be strongly dependent on the distance to the nearest resonance...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{describe}} {{a number of}} studies to examine some high order effects of advanced trapping dynamics beyond the standard single gradient force optical trap. Our interests lay primarily on low symmetry particles, specifically on high refractive index, high aspect ratio nanowires. We examine higher order dynamics due to coupling between rotational and translational degrees of freedom when a single high aspect ratio nanowire is trapped. We also study the coupling of the trapping laser into the waveguiding modes of the trapped nanowire, as well as the coupling interactions between multiple trapped nanowires. On single optically trapped nanowires, we show calculations beyond the standard power spectral analysis to demonstrate the emergence of resonance behaviour in overdamped systems due to the coupling between rotational and translational degrees of freedom. We also experimentally demonstrate the effects of such coupling which shows up in the form of resonance peaks in the power spectrum when single nanowires are trapped in optical tweezers. Next we examine the coupling of light into the waveguide modes of high refractive index nanowires by calculating the field profiles, dispersion and group velocity. We then investigate the optical coupling between multiple high refractive index nanowires in close proximity. In particular, we calculate the field profiles, dispersion and optical force of coupled nanowire waveguides with the Coupled Mode Theory and Perturbation Theory. The optical forces between coupled waveguides is also calculated and compared to results obtained from Maxwell’s Stress Tensor calculations. In the final results chapter, we explore various experimental approaches to experimentally measure the coupled nanowire system that was calculated in the previous chapter. We propose time-shared optical tweezers with interferometric particle tracking as a means of physically measuring the coupling between nanowires and investigate the feasibility of this measurement technique for our system.

40|$|ABSTRACT We {{have studied}} the growth {{dynamics}} of domains on ternary fluid vesicles composed of saturated (dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine), unsaturated (dioleoylphosphatidylcholine) phosphatidylcholine lipids, and cholesterol using a fluorescence microscopy. The domain coarsening processes are classified into two types: normal coarsening and trapped coarsening. For the normal coarsening, the domains having flat circular shape grow in a diffusion-and-coalescence manner and phenomenologically the mean size grows as a power law of;t 2 / 3. The observed growth law is not described by a two-dimensional diffusion-and-coalescence growth mechanism following the Saffman and Delbrück theory, which may originate from the two-body hydro-dynamic interactions between <b>domains.</b> For <b>trapped</b> coarsening, on the other hand, the domain coarsening is suppressed at a certain domain size because the repulsive interdomain interactions obstruct the coalescence of domains. The two-color imaging of the <b>trapped</b> <b>domains</b> reveals that the repulsive interactions are induced by the budding of domains. The model free energy consisting of the bending energy of domains, the bending energy ofmatrix, the line energy of domain boundary, and the translation energy of domains can describe the observed trapped coarsening.

We have developed procedures for recombinant production of the entire ECD (extracellular domain) and A <b>domain</b> of <b>TRAP</b> using bacterial- and baculovirus-expression systems respectively. The ECD and A domain were purified to homogeneity and migrated on gel-filtration columns as non-aggregated, monomeric proteins. These adhesive modules bound to HepG 2 cells in a dose-dependent and bivalent cation-independent manner. The binding of ECD and the A domain to HepG 2 cells was inhibited poorly by an excess of sulphatide analogues, suggesting the presence of as yet unidentified receptors for the A domain on hepatocytes. Using surface-plasmon-resonance-based sensor technology (Biacore), we demonstrate that TRAP ECD has higher affinity for heparin (K(D) = 40 nM) compared with the A domain (K(D) = 79 nM).

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is an investigation which aims to quantitatively characterise the physical microstructure, magnetic structure and micromagnetic behaviour of nanostructured thin films for magnetic recording and spintronics application. The nanostructures in the present work involve continuous and patterned thin films. Chapters 1, 2, and 3 present the overview backgrounds directly relevant to the work. Chapter 4 focuses on vortex structure in magnetic nanodots. The results confirm that the behaviour of the vortex can be modified by changing the edge geometry of the dots. It is demonstrated a practical method to determine the out-of-plane component of the vortex core with high accuracy and speed. Additionally in-plane curling magnetisation of the vortex is also mapped by reconstructing the electron phase using the transport-of-intensity equation. However this method is susceptible to spurious low spatial frequency and this aspect is explored to show limitations of the method. Chapter 5 deals with the characterisation of magnetic structure in nanoconstrictions intended to <b>trap</b> <b>domain</b> walls (DWs) in the nanoconstrictions. A structure was fabricated with two micron-sized pads as the sources for creation of DWs. A DW can be driven to be pinned at the nanoconstriction resulting in a change of magnetoresistance due to {{the contribution of the}} DW to the resistance of the device. The magnetisation configuration around the constriction is studied during the reversal process. It is apparent that that understanding the magnetisation rotation around the constriction and into the pads {{is the key to the}} magnetoresistance measurements and the DW resistance is part of this process. Evidences of DW compression at the nanoconstriction were noted. In Chapter 6 the investigation of the physical structure and micromagnetism of CoIr film is described. A hexagonal crystal structure with a [0001] texture normal to the film plane was characterised. Weak anisotropy is observed in the film denoted by a complex reversal on the hard axis due to incoherent rotation of magnetic moments. The film exhibits typical soft magnetic behaviour it merits compared to other soft materials are discussed in light of the results obtained here.
