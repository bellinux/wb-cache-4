The knowledge-based economy, the shortage of skilled labour, and shifting work force demographics have made retention issues particularly significant in the IT industry. This exploratory study examined {{the application of a}} best practice retention model in IT organizations. The model consists of the six factors most cited in the literature to affect turnover, namely, orientation, training, career development, motivation, compensation, and feedback/evaluation. Three main aspects <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> were explored. First, the extent of application of the six best practices in IT organizations was examined.

40|$|Undecynoic acid (UDA) {{attached}} to a silica hydride surface {{has been found to}} exhibit weak cationic exchange properties and an aqueous normal phase (ANP) <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention.</b> ANP is a mechanism similar to normal phase chromatographic retention, except for the use of a polar solvent such as water in the mobile phase. In ANP, the retention of a polar molecule is increased with a higher concentration of the non-polar mobile phase solvent (usually acetonitrile). Non-polar molecules exhibit retention behavior as in reverse phase (RP) chromatography. The goal of this research was to characterize the chromatographic retention pattern of an undecynoic based silica hydride column by studying various polar and nonpolar analytes. Also investigated were the effects of varying the buffer concentrations -formic acid and ammonium acetate and the effect of temperature on the retention of selected compounds. It has been established from the current work that a silica hydride based UDA column can be used for separation and analysis of nucleotides and nucleosides as well as phenolic acid components in pomegranate peel samples. A phenyl hydride column was additionally used to complete the study on the peel samples since the UDA column was not effective in separating isobaric compounds found in the peels. In conclusion, silica hydride based UDA column has been found to exhibit dual retention capabilities for polar and non-polar molecules...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{systematically}} appraise {{the impact}} of mechanical/technical risk factors on implant-supported reconstructions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A MEDLINE (PubMed) database search from 1966 to April 2008 was conducted. The search strategy {{was a combination of}} MeSH terms and the key words: design, dental implant(s), risk, prosthodontics, fixed prosthodontics, fixed partial denture(s), fixed dental prosthesis (FDP), fixed reconstruction(s), oral rehabilitation, bridge(s), removable partial denture(s), overdenture(s). Randomized controlled trials, controlled trials, and prospective and retrospective cohort studies with a mean follow-up of at least 4 years were included. The material evaluated in each study had to include cases with/without exposure to the risk factor. RESULTS: From 3, 568 articles, 111 were selected for full text analysis. Of the 111 articles, 33 were included for data extraction after grouping the outcomes into 10 risk factors: type of retentive elements supporting overdentures, presence of cantilever extension(s), cemented versus screw-retained FDPs, angled/angulated abutments, bruxism, crown/implant ratio, length of the suprastructure, prosthetic materials, number of implants supporting an FDP, and history of mechanical/technical complications. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of a metal framework in overdentures, the presence of cantilever extension(s) > 15 mm and of bruxism, the length of the reconstruction, and a history of repeated complications were associated with increased mechanical/technical complications. The <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention,</b> the presence of angled abutments, the crown-implant ratio, and the number of implants supporting an FDP were not associated with increased mechanical/technical complications.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To study occlusal wear of {{anterior}} teeth in orthodontic patients retained with different retainers until 5 years post-treatment, and {{to investigate whether}} <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> influences occlusal wear. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Orthodontic patients (n= 222), aged 15 years maximally {{at the start of}} treatment, were followed until 5 years post-treatment. In the maxilla, a retainer bonded on all six teeth or a removable retainer was used; in the mandible, a lingual retainer was bonded on all {{anterior teeth}} or on canines only. Dental casts were analyzed before treatment (T(0)), after treatment (T(1)), and 5 years post-treatment (T(5)). Incisal and canine wear were scored by applying a grading scale. Intercanine width, overjet, and overbite were measured with an electronic caliper. Statistics used were: Paired samples t-test for differences over time; Pearson correlation coefficients for associations between wear and retention type; and backward linear regression for influence of retention type on wear. RESULTS: There was an increase in wear during all time periods and for all teeth. From T(0) to T(5) an increase in maxillary intercanine width and maxillary retention had an effect on changes in canine wear. Incisal wear was associated with an increase in upper intercanine width (T(1) -T(5)). For both arches, an increase in maxillary intercanine width during treatment was associated with less progression of canine and incisal wear, but the explained variance was low, 13. 4 % and 19. 3 %, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Retention type and, occasionally, an increase in intercanine width influence anterior teeth wear post-treatment. However, the clinical significance and impact of the examined retention methods on occlusal wear are small...|$|E
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] The use {{of formal}} {{consensus}} development to determine appropriate indications for prostatectomy {{and to identify}} factors underlying clinical decisions about appropriateness is described. DESIGN [...] A nominal group technique was used. SETTINGS [...] The study took place in an academic research institution. PARTICIPANTS [...] The panel consisted of six urologists and three general practitioners. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] The panel identified agreed indications for prostatectomy, {{expressed in terms of}} different combinations of <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention,</b> type and severity of symptoms, and level of comorbidity. Agreement was reached for 67 % of the indications considered. For acute on chronic retention, surgery is indicated, regardless of symptom severity, if life expectancy is greater than one year. For acute or chronic retention, surgery is generally indicated if symptoms are severe, or if symptoms are moderate and life expectancy is greater than five years. For patients with neither acute nor chronic retention, surgery is indicated if symptoms are severe, or if these are moderate and life expectancy is greater than five years. For chronic or acute retention surgery is inappropriate if symptoms are mild and life expectancy is less than one year, or if there is no retention and only mild symptoms. An "appropriateness score" was developed. This confirmed that in general the ratings were internally consistent, that the panel attached little weight to mild symptoms, that a combination of irritative and obstructive symptoms was no more indicative of surgery than obstructive symptoms alone, and that the type of symptom was less important than the other factors considered.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The present prospective, {{longitudinal}} study assessed {{the outcome of}} posterior extensive restorations and identified risk factors for failure of the restorations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample consisted of 722 amalgam restorations, 115 composite resin restorations and 89 crowns placed in 428 adults by one dentist from 1982 to 1999 in Belgium. Well-defined criteria were used for cavity preparation design, <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> and selection of restorative material. RESULTS: At {{the closure of the}} study 48 % of the restorations were well functioning, 24 % were lost to lack of follow-up, and 28 % had failed. The most frequent reasons for failure were fracture of restoration (8 %), secondary caries (6 %) and fracture of cusp (5 %). Failures were more often found in premolar teeth (34 %) than in molars (27 %) (P= 0. 05) and occurred in 28 % of the amalgam restorations, 30 % of the resin restorations and 24 % of the crowns (P= 0. 55). Molar restorations were more frequently repaired than replaced in contrast to premolar restorations. The highest percentage of extractions was related to complete amalgam restorations in premolars. The Kaplan-Meier median survival times were 12. 8 years for amalgam restorations, 7. 8 years for resin restorations, and more than 14. 6 years for crowns, considering all retreatment as failures (P= 0. 002). The survival was influenced by extension of restoration, age of patient, pulpal vitality, 3 -year period of treatment, use of base material and dentinal retentive pins. CONCLUSION: Within the limits of the study the data support the view that extensive amalgam restorations but not composite resin restorations can be used as an appropriate alternative to crowns, with due consideration to the longevity of the restorations...|$|E
40|$|A tetrapeptide-imprinted {{capillary}} monolithic {{column was}} synthesized {{successfully in the}} presence of YPLG (Tyr-Pro-Leu-Gly) as template by in situ thermo-initiated polymerization. For exploring the recognition mechanism of molecularly imprinted polymer in a capillary electrochromatography (CEC) mode, YPLG and its structural analogue, YPGL (Tyr-Pro-Gly-Leu), differing in amino acid sequence, were used as model compounds. It is hard work to separate the two tetrapeptides by a simple CEC or a capillary electrophoresis mode due to their similar chemical structures and values of pI. However, the results showed that YPLG could be recognized specially by the imprinted monolith. The separation factor (alpha') and the resolution (R(s)) between YPLG and YPGL were 1. 73 and 3. 72, respectively. The effects of organic modifier concentration, pH value of buffer, salt concentration of buffer and column temperature on the recognition of YPLG and YPGL were investigated. A non-linear Van't Hoff behavior of the template was observed on a YPLG-imprinted column, which suggested the presence <b>of</b> multiple <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> mechanisms or multiple <b>types</b> <b>of</b> binding sites.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: A {{retainer}} {{bonded to}} the lingual {{surfaces of the}} mandibular canines (3 - 3 retainer) is a widely used <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention.</b> Our aim {{in this study was}} to assess the effectiveness of the 3 - 3 mandibular lingual stainless steel retainer to prevent relapse of the orthodontic treatment in the mandibular anterior region. METHODS: The sample consisted of the dental casts of 235 consecutively treated patients (96 boys, 139 girls) from the archives of the Department of Orthodontics and Oral Biology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center, The Netherlands, who received a 3 - 3 mandibular lingual stainless steel retainer at the end of active orthodontic treatment. The casts were studied before treatment (Ts), immediately after treatment (T 0), and 2 years (T 2), and 5 years (T 5) posttreatment. RESULTS: The main irregularity index decreased significantly from 7. 2 mm (SD, 4. 0) at Ts to 0. 3 mm (SD, 0. 5) at T 0; it increased significantly during the posttreatment period to 0. 7 mm (SD, 0. 8) at T 2 and 0. 9 mm (SD, 0. 9) at T 5. The irregularity index was stable during the 5 -year posttreatment period (T 0 -T 5) in 141 patients (60 %) and increased by 0. 4 mm (SD, 0. 7) in 94 patients (40 %). The intercanine distance increased 1. 3 mm between Ts and T 0 and remained stable during the posttreatment period. CONCLUSIONS: The 3 - 3 mandibular lingual stainless steel retainer (bonded to the canines only) is effective in preventing relapse in the mandibular anterior region in most patients, but a relatively high percentage will experience a small to moderate increase in mandibular incisor irregularity...|$|E
30|$|Strategies need {{to provide}} drought {{proofing}} of crops as well as limiting damages caused by floods in non-drought years to reduce risk to farmers and the region. Strategies should also allow for sustainable water management by providing multiple benefits when possible, such as bioproduction and nutrient retention (Government of Manitoba 2014). According to the Lake Winnipeg Stewardship Board (2006), retention basins should be further reviewed to determine how effective and appropriate they can be as a nutrient abatement option in Manitoba. Surface water retention systems are ideal sites for nutrient retention as they act as concentration sites within a watershed for collecting excess nutrients allowing for maximum nutrient removal from bioproducts such as cattails. Surface water retention systems have shown success in reducing nutrient and sediment loading in various locations worldwide. Within America and Europe, retention systems have reduced total nitrogen by 38 – 56 % and total phosphorus by 17 – 82 %, with reduction levels dependent on the size and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> system (Tiessen et al. 2011; Sharpley et al. 1996; Kovacic et al. 2006; Salvia-Castellvi et al. 2001; Avilés and Niell 2007; Uusi-Kämppä et al. 2000). On the Canadian Prairies, dams were found effective in reducing total suspended sediment (65 – 85 % reduction), particulate nitrogen (41 – 43 % reduction during snowmelt, 7 – 11 % reduction from summer rainfall events), and particulate phosphorus (27 – 38 % reduction in snowmelt runoff) (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada 2012). A system of dams within one watershed provided a reduction in peak flow of 9 – 19 % from spring snowmelt runoff and 13 – 25 % from rainfall runoff (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada 2012). Another on-farm retention pond in Saint-Samuel, Quebec was found to reduce peak flows by 38 %, on average, from rainfall runoff events (Chrétien et al. 2016). These additional benefits provided by retention ponds bolster the benefits of retention systems {{when they are not}} required for irrigation (Grosshans et al. 2012; Government of Manitoba 2014; Rittenburg et al. 2015).|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Retention is {{the phase}} of {{orthodontic}} treatment that attempts to keep teeth in the corrected positions after orthodontic (dental) braces. Without a phase of retention {{there is a tendency}} for the teeth to return to their initial position (relapse). To prevent relapse almost every patient who has orthodontic treatment will require some <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention.</b> OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of different retention strategies used to stabilise tooth position after orthodontic braces. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched. Several journals were handsearched. No language restrictions were applied. Authors of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were identified and contacted to identify unpublished trials. Most recent search: December 2002. SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs on children and adults, who have had retainers fitted or adjunctive procedures undertaken, following orthodontic treatment with braces to prevent relapse. The outcomes are: how well the teeth are stabilised, survival of retainers, adverse effects on oral health and quality of life. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Screening of eligible studies, assessment of the methodological quality of the trials and data extraction were conducted in duplicate and independently by two reviewers. As no two studies compared the same retention strategies (interventions) {{it was not possible to}} combine the results of any studies. MAIN RESULTS: Four trials satisfied the inclusion criteria. These trials all compared different interventions: circumferential supracrestal fiberotomy (CSF) combined with full-time removable retainer versus a full-time removable retainer alone; circumferential supracrestal fiberotomy (CSF) combined with a nights-only removable retainer versus a nights-only removable retainer alone; removable Hawley retainer versus a clear overlay retainer; and three types of fixed retainers versus a removable retainer. There was weak unreliable evidence, based on data from one trial, that there was a statistically significant increase in stability in both the mandibular (p< 0. 001) and maxillary anterior segments (p< 0. 001) when the CSF was used, compared with when it was not used. There was also weak, unreliable evidence that teeth settle quicker with a Hawley retainer than with a clear overlay retainer after 3 months. The quality of the trial reports was generally poor. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There are insufficient research data on which to base our clinical practice on retention at present. There is an urgent need for high quality randomised controlled trials in this crucial area of orthodontic practice...|$|E
40|$|Although green tree {{retention}} {{has been}} proposed {{as a means of}} maintaining forest structural attributes normally found after stand replacing disturbances, there is some concern about mortality and fall rates of residual trees. Very little data regarding windthrow after green tree retention is currently available for Quebec, eastern Canada. The present study documents windthrow after two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> in two regions with contrasting biophysical characteristics, and identifies the most influential factors. A retrospective survey of windthrow was conducted in dispersed and group retention cuts conducted two to five years previously. In the Abitibi region of northwestern Quebec, the level of windthrow was comparable between group and dispersed tree retention. In the North Shore region of eastern Quebec, windthrow was higher in dispersed <b>retention</b> and levels <b>of</b> mortality were generally lower than in the Abitibi region. Windthrow probability was best explained by edaphic variables, tree species, slenderness ratio, tree height or diameter at breast height, and sapling abundance. Variables such as regional mean wind speed, retained group area, simple fetch and topographical exposure (Topex to distance) {{were not included in the}} best models. Although mortality rates increased after green tree retention, it remains to be established whether this increase has detrimental effects in terms of maintaining biodiversity...|$|R
40|$|Long and {{intensive}} forest management has made conservation {{measures in the}} forest landscape necessary to maintain forest biodiversity. The most common measure is to set aside land for conservation purposes. This, however, requires large financial resources and available budgets are generally insufficient. In this thesis, a set of key factors affecting the cost-efficiency when selecting conservation areas were investigated. I studied (1) the conservation quality and economic land value <b>of</b> three common <b>types</b> <b>of</b> conservation areas: nature reserves, woodland key habitats, and retention patches on harvested areas; (2) the capacity <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> patches to harbour bryophytes and lichens over time; and (3) factors determining what information should be used when selecting con¬servation areas, including the conservation goal, correlation and variability <b>of</b> different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> data, and the costs for collecting information. Two large field studies {{formed the basis for}} the studies, where data on bryophytes, lichens and structural characteristics were collected, and economic land values were calculated. Site-selection analyses were used in combination with other analytical tools to investigate and compare efficiency of different con¬servation strategies. The results showed that woodland key habitats had a very high conservation quality, and were generally also the most cost-efficient <b>type</b> <b>of</b> conservation area for the measures of biodiversity used in the studies. Different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>retention</b> patches comple¬mented each other in terms of species composition and the variation in conservation quality and economic value was large among patches. Many bryophytes decreased in retention patches following harvesting, while some lichens decreased and others increased. The costs for obtaining information on conservation quality of areas were generally low compared to the economic land values. The studies indicate that a conservation strategy based on many <b>types</b> <b>of</b> conservation areas is most likely efficient for long-term conservation of forest biodiversity. To increase cost-efficiency, systematic selection of areas within each conservation area type should be carried out, where both conservation quality and economic values of areas are taken into account...|$|R
5000|$|A 1992 {{meta-analysis}} {{suggested that}} overlearning does significantly affect recall over time. It also {{concluded that the}} size of this effect may be moderated by the amount <b>of</b> overlearning, task <b>type,</b> and length <b>of</b> <b>retention.</b> The meta-analysis included 15 studies. These 15 studies tested overlearning effects on physical and cognitive tasks. Both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> task showed an effect of overlearning. The effect size for physical tasks was smaller than the effect size for cognitive tasks. The amount of overlearning affected retention: more overlearning led to more <b>retention</b> on both <b>types</b> <b>of</b> task. [...] The length <b>of</b> the <b>retention</b> interval also affected overlearning, but the effects were different for physical and cognitive tasks. Whereas participants overlearning physical tasks increased in ability during the retention interval, participants who overlearned cognitive tasks decreased in recall ability over time.|$|R
