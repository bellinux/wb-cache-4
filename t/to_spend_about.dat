5|$|In 1967, the United States Embassy in London chose Thatcher to {{take part}} in the International Visitor Leadership Program (then called the Foreign Leader Program), a {{professional}} exchange programme that gave her the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>about</b> six weeks visiting various US cities and political figures as well as institutions such as the International Monetary Fund. Although she was not yet a Cabinet or Shadow Cabinet member, the embassy reportedly described her to the State Department as a possible future Prime Minister. The description helped Thatcher meet with many prominent people during a busy itinerary focused on economic issues, including Paul Samuelson, Walt Rostow, Pierre-Paul Schweitzer and Nelson Rockefeller. In 1967, Heath appointed Thatcher to the Shadow Cabinet as Fuel and Power spokesman. Prior to the 1970 general election, she was promoted to Shadow Transport spokesman and later to Education.|$|E

He held this office until he was {{appointed}} to the Governor's Council in the Virginia General Assembly in 1733. This position was a lifetime appointment. The Council was made up of twelve appointees who were selected by the Governor of Virginia and was the upper half of the Virginia General Assembly. The lower half was made up of the House of Burgesses. This position also gave Lee the rank of Colonel, a military rank that was second only to the governor.

Their work led them <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> <b>about</b> a third of the year in the capital Williamsburg.|$|E

40|$|Consumer {{compulsive}} buying {{has been}} an important area of study in consumer behavior research. The goal {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of factors like age, tendency <b>to</b> <b>spend,</b> post purchase guilt, drive <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> compulsively, feeling <b>about</b> shopping and <b>spending</b> and dysfunctional spending on compulsive buying behavior of youth in Pakistan. The primary data for this study was collected from questionnaire that was administered in Bahawalpur, Lahore and Islamabad. A convenience sample of three hundred and seventy one respondents was used in the study. Statistical techniques of correlation and regression were used for data analysis. The empirical findings show that the age has a significant but negative relationship with the compulsive buying behavior. However the factors tendency <b>to</b> <b>spend,</b> drive <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> compulsively, feeling <b>about</b> shopping and <b>spending,</b> dysfunctional spending and post purchase guilt are positively related to compulsive buying behavior. ...|$|R

He was mainly addicted to cocaine and later admitted <b>to</b> <b>spending</b> <b>about</b> $7,000 per week on drugs for five years straight. In 1991, he and future wife Tanya Hijazi were accused of holding 24-year-old Frances Alley hostage {{for up to six}} days although accounts vary on how long she was actually held, tying her up, forcing her to perform sexual acts, and burning her legs and abdomen with the hot end of a crack cocaine pipe, during a week-long cocaine binge. In 1993, while out on bail for that incident, James, under the influence of cocaine, assaulted music executive Mary Sauger at the St. James Club and Hotel in West Hollywood. Sauger claims she met James and Hijazi for a business meeting, but said the two then kidnapped and beat her over a 20-hour period.|$|R
