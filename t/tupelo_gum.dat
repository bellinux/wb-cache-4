50|$|There are Tennessee {{state record}} trees located in its {{bottomland}} forests, including a <b>Tupelo</b> <b>Gum</b> that is 17 ft in circumference. Other hardwoods include green ash, red maple, swamp chestnut oak, blackgum, and the majestic bald cypress. Native flowering plants include cardinal flower, ironweed, swamp iris, false loosestrife, spatterdock, swamp rose, blue phlox and spring cress.|$|E
50|$|Important {{species in}} the lower {{elevations}} are overcup oak, bitter pecan, and honey locust, with cypress and <b>tupelo</b> <b>gum</b> being found in sloughs and old lakes. Understory species commonly found on Boeuf WMA include deciduous holly, hawthorn, swamp privet, rattan, greenbriar and grape. Boeuf has a greentree reservoir and several moist soil impoundments available for waterfowl and other wetland species.|$|E
50|$|Beaver Creek Swamp is {{the name}} of a <b>tupelo</b> <b>gum</b> swamp located ten miles {{northeast}} of Decatur, Alabama in Limestone County, Alabama. While this type of swamp is usually located in the coastal plain, Beaver Creek Swamp is an exception; it is located in the Interior Low Plateaus region. It is part of the Wheeler National Wildlife Refuge. Star Study Academy helped build this Creek. It has a short hiking trail and boardwalk. It was designated a National Natural Landmark in May 1974.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the side}} of the Old York Road grew [...] "Old Peppy," [...] the {{official}} tree of the Township of Cranford in what is now Lincoln Park (formerly the 1899-era grounds of the Cranford Golf Club, now moved to Westfield and called the Echo Lake Country Club). Felled in April 2015 out of safety concerns, the tree was a Nyssa sylvatica, also known as a black <b>tupelo,</b> <b>tupelo,</b> black <b>gum,</b> sour gum or pepperidge tree. A cross section of its trunk is preserved in a gazebo in Lincoln Park. Apparently in connection with the controversy surrounding the removal of [...] "Old Peppy," [...] a copper commemorative plaque was stolen from Lincoln Park. The plaque had been mounted by the Cranford Historical Society on a rock near the tree, and was originally placed in 1964. Since the removal of the tree on April 21, 2015, the plaque was all that remained to remind Cranford of the tree's history.|$|R
50|$|Today {{the river}} is not {{extensively}} used for navigation. It is {{an important source of}} electric power and public water supplies, as well as recreational use. While the Pee Dee is free-flowing in South Carolina, upstream in North Carolina, several dams have been constructed on it. The opening and closing of these dams causes dramatic swings in the depth of the river in South Carolina. The sharing of water between the two states has sometimes been a matter of controversy, particularly during period of drought. Some commercial fishing is done during the winter shad run, and for shrimp in the lower reaches. The river is excellent for recreational fishing and boating. There are numerous boat landings, yet most of {{the river is}} wild, with forests of <b>tupelo,</b> oak and <b>gum</b> along its shores. Herons and alligators can be seen along the way, and a lucky sighting of a bald eagle is possible.|$|R
40|$|General Information Thick {{pieces of}} wood, such as logs or boards, cannot be {{bleached}} satisfactorily {{all the way}} through. Wood should be made into the furniture or other find product, and then the surface bleached if desired Woods differ in {{the ease with which}} they can be bleached. Oak, birch, mahogany, ash, maple, beech, and walnut can be bleached fairly easily <b>gum,</b> <b>tupelo,</b> pine, and poplar are said {{to be very difficult to}} bleach satisfactorily. If varnish, stain, or other finishing material is present on wood surface that is to be bleached, it must be removed completely before bleaching is started. Even waxy materials left on the wood by varnish removers may interfere with the action of bleaching chemicals. A final sanding before bleaching is desirable in such cases. Where stain has penetrated into the wood, scraping or sanding until all of the stained wood has been removed is usually necessary. The wood bleaches may not bleach the dyes or pigments used in wood stains. Many bleaching chemicals are injurious to the skin and eyes. Goggles, heavy rubber gloves, and aprons should be worn when handling and applying wood bleaches, particularly those containing hydrogen peroxide or sodium hydroxide. Reasons for Bleaching Woods such as walnut or mahogany, which are naturally dark in color, may be bleached to a lighter color or even to white, and light-colored woods may be made lighter, in conformity with the vogue for light-colored, or blond, furniture. 1 Only a Iimited amount of experimental work on the bleaching of wood has been done at the Forest Products Laboratory. The information presented here is based chiefly on the published literature and on materiaI suppIied by makers and users of wood bleaches. This Researc...|$|R
50|$|The Francis Beidler Forest is an Audubon {{wildlife}} sanctuary in Four Holes Swamp, a blackwater creek system in South Carolina, United States. It consists of over 16,000 acres (65 kmÂ²) of mainly bald cypress and <b>tupelo</b> <b>gum</b> hardwood forest and swamp with approximately 1800 acre of old-growth forest. It {{is the largest}} virgin stand of these trees in the world, with some trees over 1,000 years old. It is a favorite haunt of birdwatchers and is used for biological research projects by area schools.|$|E
50|$|The Alcovy River {{rises in}} eastern Gwinnett County, 5 mi {{northeast}} of Lawrenceville, and flows generally south through Walton, Newton and Jasper counties. The river {{is used to}} define portions of the boundary between Newton and Jasper counties. It joins the Yellow and South rivers to form the Ocmulgee River as part of Lake Jackson, a reservoir formed by a dam on the Ocmulgee. North of I-20, the Alcovy River becomes a lowland swamp for about 4 mi before resuming {{the nature of a}} Piedmont stream. The lowland area contains an ecological rarity: the <b>tupelo</b> <b>gum</b> tree.|$|E
5000|$|Kisatchie National Forest {{contains}} two significant roadless areas, established to protect native species: Cunningham Brake and Saline Bayou. Cunningham Brake {{is a large}} cypress-tupelo gum swamp that also protects flows in Kisatchie Bayou. Saline Bayou has mixed forests associated with alluvial habitats, ranging from shortleaf pine to <b>tupelo</b> <b>gum.</b> Roads are known to cause significant damage to forests, prairies, streams and wetlands. Roads are particularly harmful to native populations of amphibians and reptiles that migrate to vernal pools. [...] A third large roadless area, the Kisatchie Hills, is protected under a different designation, as a National Wilderness Area. More information of these important areas {{can be found in}} the Final Environmental Impact Statement for Kisatchie, prepared by the Forest Service in 1999.|$|E
50|$|Bond Swamp National Wildlife Refuge, located 6 mi {{south of}} Macon, Georgia, United States, was {{established}} in 1989 to protect, maintain and enhance the forested wetland ecosystem of the Ocmulgee River floodplain. It {{opened to the public}} in 2000 and currently consists of 6500 acre situated along the fall line separating the Piedmont and Coastal Plains. The refuge has a diversity of vegetation communities, including mixed hardwood-pine, bottomland hardwoods, <b>tupelo</b> <b>gum</b> swamp forests, creeks, tributaries, beaver swamps and oxbow lakes. The refuge is rich in wildlife diversity including white-tailed deer, wood ducks, black bears, alligators, wild turkey, a nesting pair of bald eagles and excellent wintering habitat for waterfowl. Extensive bottomland hardwoods provide critical habitat for neotropical songbirds of concern, such as Swainson's warbler, wood thrush, prothonotary warbler and yellow-billed cuckoo. The combination of warm weather and wet areas at Bond Swamp provide ideal conditions for a variety of reptile and amphibian species.|$|E
50|$|Southeastern Louisiana's disappearing {{wetlands}} {{have a broad}} impact {{ranging from}} cultural to economic. Commercial fishing in Louisiana {{accounts for more than}} 300 million dollars of the state's economy. More than 70% of that amount stems from species such as shrimp, oysters and blue crabs that count on the coastal wetlands as a nursery for their young. Annually Louisiana sells more than 330,000 hunting licenses and 900,000 fishing licenses to men and women who depend on the wetlands as a habitat for their game. Additional recreational activities such as boating, swimming, camping, hiking, birding, photography and painting are abundant in wetland areas. Wetlands host a variety of trees such as the bald cypress, <b>tupelo</b> <b>gum</b> and cottonwood. Other plants such as the dwarf palmetto and wax myrtle and submerged aquatic plants such as Vallisneria and Ruppia are native to Louisiana wetlands. Wetland plants act as natural filters, helping to remove heavy metals, sewage, and pesticides from polluted water before reaching the Gulf of Mexico. Animal species native to these areas include osprey, herons, egrets, alligators, and beavers. Although there are several naturally occurring forces that adversely affect the wetland regions of Louisiana, many believe it is human intervention that has caused the majority of the decline.|$|E
40|$|To {{more fully}} {{understand}} Ferguson Lake as an ecosystem and eventually relate its {{water quality and}} production potential to fisheries management, several limnological variables were sampled monthly from April 1997 through March 1999. Vertical profiles of temperature and dissolved oxygen were recorded, and water samples from 0. 5 m. depth were tested for turbidity, pH, total alkalinity, total hardness, ortho-phosphate, nitrate-nitrogen, sulfate, iron and specific conductance. Evaporation rate experiments, spillway discharge and rainfall records were used to estimate lake hydrology. Depth transects on the lake and USGS topographic maps were used to measure and calculate morphometric and watershed features. The lake is essentially the deep end of a swamp (dmax = 4. 27 m.; dmean = 1. 92 m.) which is dominated by a lowland hardwood species-pine mix. Numerous cypress (Taxodium distichum) and <b>tupelo</b> <b>gum</b> (Nyssa aquatic) trees stand in the uppermost one-third of the lake. The rapid deposition and slow decomposition of organic debris on the lake bottom are the primary contributors to the brown water, relatively low pH, and hypoxia in and near the sediments from May through November. There {{was no evidence of}} thermal stratification, and pH ranged between 6 and 7, except for brief periods of rapid photosynthesis during the summers. Alkalinity, hardness and specific conductance were quite low, compared to most natural waters in this region. Phosphate, nitrate and sulfur were also comparatively low, and iron was low except after rainfall events which resulted in fairly heavy runoff...|$|E
