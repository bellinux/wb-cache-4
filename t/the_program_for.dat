40|$|Abstract—The {{software}} package for analysis and synthesis of continuous-signal and digital filters has been developed. This package consists of 25 “EXE ” <b>programs.</b> There are <b>the</b> <b>programs</b> <b>for</b> continuous-signal filter network synthesis and for computation of their impulse response in this package. They allow to synthesize the uneven digital FIR–filters and to compute their frequency responses. There are also <b>the</b> <b>programs</b> <b>for</b> a recursive filter synthesis in this package. Besides, there are <b>the</b> <b>programs</b> <b>for</b> synthesis of <b>the</b> more complete filters, high order filters. All these programs use both our scientific results [1 – 10] {{and the results}} from [11 – 15]. The article is an application description of the developed {{software package}}. The theoretical questions of filtering, of wave digital filters, of z-transforms {{and the others are}} discussed in this description. It contains a lot of synthesis examples, too...|$|R

5|$|The Second Avenue Subway was {{supposed}} to be the flagship project of <b>the</b> <b>Program</b> <b>for</b> Action. In a 1964 report, it was given top priority on a list of projects to be completed. Prior attempts to build the line had failed, and the city wished to have a Second Avenue subway line to alleviate overcrowding on the IRT Lexington Avenue Line. Twenty-two blocks of tunnel were ultimately constructed, excluding seven blocks in the East Village that were prepared for tunneling operations, but never excavated.|$|E

5|$|The {{station was}} part of the {{original}} Second Avenue Subway as outlined in <b>the</b> <b>Program</b> <b>for</b> Action in 1968. Construction on that project started in 1972, but stalled in 1975 due to lack of funding. In 2007, a separate measure authorized a first phase of the Second Avenue Line to be built between 65th and 105th Streets, with stations at 72nd, 86th, and 96th Streets. The station opened on January 1, 2017, as an intermediate station along Phase 1. Since opening, the presence of the Second Avenue Subway's three Phase 1 stations has improved real estate prices along the corridor.|$|E
5|$|A {{railroad}} link to JFK Airport {{had been}} proposed since 1968 {{as part of}} <b>the</b> <b>Program</b> <b>for</b> Action, but was not actually implemented for almost three decades. From the 1970s to the early 1990s, various plans surfaced to try to build such a link. Meanwhile, the JFK Express subway service and shuttle buses provided an unpopular transport system to and around JFK. There were 21 failed proposals for rail links to New York City airports during this time. Serious planning for a dedicated transport system at JFK began in 1990. An environmental impact statement for a JFK light-rail system was released in 1997, and the current people-mover system started construction a year later. AirTrain JFK opened on December 17, 2003, despite being the subject of several lawsuits during construction and a death {{during one of the}} system's test runs.|$|E
