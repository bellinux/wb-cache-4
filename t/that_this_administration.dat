[...] Two-thirds of American women with school-age children were in the workforce and three-fifths of married men with children had working wives.

500|$|Two months later, the EPB granted an {{interview}} to Claridad, where the organization discussed its stance on several topics. The group opened by expressing that the 2009 administration change did little to the [...] " [...] neoliberal politics of both parties", claiming that both exploit demagogue to entice voters but that in reality they [...] "only serve the bourgeoisie of the United States of Puerto Rico, among which are the bankers, developers and contractors". However, the organization did differentiate Fortuño from his predecessor, claiming that that [...] "as a fervent servant of the Republican neoliberal capitalism" [...] he employed [...] "an strategy to downsize the government, privatize anything that is of interest to bond and capital holders and to eliminate all that is preserving {{the culture of the}} Puerto Rican nation alive". The Macheteros expressed concern <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>administration</b> wanted to portray the wealthy as the answer to the economic crisis, [...] "which are really the fault of all government administrations, including Mr. Fortuño's". The group also disregarded all measures adopted by the legislature, which in their view only responded to the economic interests of the wealthy, which they considered [...] "perhaps the worst of all" [...] and warning the PPD legislators led by Hector Ferrer that [...] "weak opposition [...] into accomplices".|$|E

He concluded: [...] "Lichtman's case for impeachment is plausible, certainly, but it is far stronger as an argument for why Americans never should have elected Trump in the first place. Yet we did. So it may not be too soon for this book, after all. It may be too late." [...] Joy Lo Dico reviewed the book for the London Evening Standard writing: [...] "His argument races through 200 pages, with steam for more." [...] New York Journal of Books contributor Basil Smilke Jr. reviewed the book favorably, writing: [...] "The Case for Impeachment is a good backdrop for conversations that will likely remain a part of our national dialogue for some time – or if you are a member of Congress trying to grapple with all <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>administration</b> has wrought." [...] AM Joy host Joy-Ann Reid said it was a [...] "fascinating book," [...] particularly because Lichtman {{had been one of the}} only prognosticators to correctly predict Trump would win the 2016 election.

It was naturally quite enough for parliament that the accounts showed a surplus of £1,350,000; that the last tax on raw material vanished with the repeal of the duty on timber; that a series of commercial treaties had been successfully negotiated; and that homage should be paid to virtue by the nibbling of a mouse at the mountain of the national debt.
