5|$|An {{applicant}} has {{the burden}} of proving that a legislative restriction on {{the freedom of speech}} {{has nothing to do with}} public order, public health or morality. There must be some substance in the applicant's complaint – <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have an immediate duty to justify making a decision that restricts the applicant's right to freedom of speech simply because the applicant complains of an alleged infringement of Article 15(1).|$|E
25|$|The {{constitution}} and laws prohibit discrimination against people with {{physical or mental}} disabilities in employment, education, access to health care, or the provision of other state services, but <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> effectively enforce these laws.

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{legislative}} councillor Gary Fan {{claimed that the}} protests happened because <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> take any adjustment policies. He suggested that <b>the</b> <b>government</b> should put limitation on the individual visit scheme and cancel multiple-entry permit. He believed that the demonstrations will continue if <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> adjust their policy.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Government</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> need to {{have the}} {{confidence}} of the new Senate, and the Senate cannot pass a motion of no confidence against the Government.|$|E
25|$|Some aid {{agencies}} {{have reported that}} the toll may be higher than the official figures because <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> track deaths in rural areas where people never reached a hospital or emergency treatment center. In 2011, reports suggested over 6,700 people had been killed during the outbreak.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Government</b> of Guinea {{demonstrated}} minimal {{efforts to}} conduct anti-trafficking or educational campaigns during the reporting period.

25|$|Discriminatory acts constituting {{harassment}} or infringement of a person's dignity on {{the basis}} of origin, citizenship, race, religion, or sex (Penal Code Article 313).

25|$|As a {{response}} to globalization, some countries have embraced isolationist policies. For example, the North Korean government makes {{it very difficult for}} foreigners to enter the country and strictly monitors their activities when they do. Aid workers are subject to considerable scrutiny and excluded from places and regions <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> wish them to enter. Citizens cannot freely leave the country.|$|E
25|$|Security {{agencies}} sporadically persecuted Muslim {{converts to}} Christianity. In Egypt <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> officially recognize conversions from Islam to Christianity; because certain interfaith marriages {{are not allowed}} either, this prevents marriages between converts to Christianity and those born in Christian communities, and also results in the children of Christian converts being classified as Muslims and given a Muslim education.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>government</b> <b>did</b> <b>not</b> {{restrict}} emigration or {{prohibit the}} return of citizens who had left the country.|$|R

25|$|Religious {{freedom is}} {{virtually}} non-existent. <b>The</b> <b>Government</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> provide legal recognition or protection {{for freedom of}} religion, and it is severely restricted in practice. As a matter of policy, the Government guarantees and protects the right to private worship for all, including non-Muslims who gather in homes for religious practice; however, this right is not always respected in practice and is not defined in law.|$|E
25|$|The Constitution {{provides}} {{for freedom of}} religion, and the government generally respects this right. While {{separation of church and}} state is mandated by the Constitution, Liberia is considered a Christian state in practice.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Government</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> permit non-Muslim clergy {{to enter}} {{the country for the}} purpose of {{conducting}} religious services, although some come under other auspices and perform religious functions in secret. Such restrictions make it very difficult for most non-Muslims to maintain contact with clergymen and attend services. Catholics and Orthodox Christians, who require a priest on a regular basis to receive the sacraments required by their faith, particularly are affected.|$|E
25|$|In Singapore, where Chinese {{is one of}} the {{official}} languages, simplified characters are {{the official}} standard and used in all official publications as well as government-controlled press. While simplified characters are taught exclusively in schools, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> officially discourage the use of traditional characters. While all official publications are in simplified characters, the government still allows parents to choose whether to have their child's Chinese name registered in simplified or traditional characters.|$|E
25|$|Healthcare in Canada is {{delivered}} through a publicly funded healthcare system, which is mostly free {{at the point}} of use and has most services provided by private entities. The system was established by the provisions of the Canada Health Act of 1984.

Elections are relatively free and fair. There are 17 registered political parties, which are able to conduct their activities freely.|$|E
25|$|The {{high density}} of {{wildlife}} along La Mosquitia coast {{makes it a}} popular destination for ecotourists. Although private organizations are launching ecotourism enterprises throughout the region, <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> have a comprehensive plan to control or benefit from ecotourists. Ecotourism can offer relief for poverty stricken local populations, increased awareness of biological value, and can generate income {{that can be used}} to fund projects for the reserve. Currently there are guided 10- to 12-day rafting trips being offered down the entire length of the Rio Plátano.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} by the Icelandic Government of an Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) system of fisheries management across virtually all its major fisheries {{was followed by}} the introduction of a ban of at-sea discarding of catch. The Icelandic regulations require the retention of most fish for which quotas have been set or species for which a market exists. Since it is compulsory to land smaller fish but <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>does</b> <b>not</b> wish to encourage their capture, there are upper limits on the percentage weight of fish that can be landed below minimum landing size.|$|E
