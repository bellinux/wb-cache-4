30|$|The {{introduction}} of unemployment insurance savings accounts (UISA) in October 2002 changed labor market conditions for formal private sector workers in Chile. UISA are individual savings accounts to which employer and employee <b>transfer</b> <b>a</b> <b>share</b> of the worker’s salary for possible unemployment spells. Before the introduction, unemployment protection was practically limited to severance pay {{in case of}} job termination due to economic necessities of the firm. Additionally, high opportunity costs were involved in job change, and employers {{had to deal with}} rigid labor market regulations. After the {{introduction of}} UISA, the access to and amount of benefits transferred to workers in case of unemployment or inactivity increased, and opportunity costs of workers changing employment decreased, while ad-hoc obligations of employers to lay off workforce were reduced.|$|E

To address the stra-tegic implications of stakeholders over negotiations, we consider a model where two bargainers interact {{in the presence}} of a third party that (a) can <b>transfer</b> <b>a</b> <b>share</b> of her benefits to the bargainers but cannot receive a share of the bilateral surplus, and (b) while she may not participate in all periods of the negotiation, she cannot remain entirely inhibited. Our main findings are:(1) the stakeholder’s (reverse) liquidity constraint implies the existence of a multiplicity of stationary subgame perfect equilibria that include outcomes with very asymmetric bilateral agreements, and (2) the partial participation of the stakeholder may be the source of severe inefficiency...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe model {{conflict}} between two agents {{in which each}} one has two possible strategies: cease-fire or rejection of the truce. We use the concept of pre-donations, namely, a redefinition {{of the game in}} which each agent commits to <b>transfer</b> <b>a</b> <b>share</b> of its output to the other agent (Sertel, 1991). Conditions are established under which a system of pre-donations may facilitate a truce. In particular, for conflicts involving high costs there is a distributive mechanism, acceptable for both parties, whereby cease-fire is the best strategy for both of them. However, in many cases the conditions are not right for such a scheme of pre-donations to be effective. Some limitations of the framework are analyzed and the model is extended to deal with certain shortcomings in the basic setup. To illustrate the relevance of the theoretical results, we briefly describe the circumstances that have characterized the negotiation processes between the Colombian government and various illegal groups in this long-lasting armed conflict...|$|E
40|$|In my {{dissertation}} I analyse {{the issue}} of the <b>transfer</b> of <b>a</b> <b>share</b> in <b>a</b> limited liability company {{which is one of the}} most common legal dispositions with the share. The work is based on the new legal regulation of private law which will come into effect on 1 January 2014 but at the same time it compares the existing and new legislation. Besides the applicable law, the work examines the legal literature, periodicals, as well as the case law of the Czech courts. The main contribution of this work is to provide a possible future interpretation of some institutes associated with the <b>transfer</b> of <b>a</b> <b>share</b> as well as to point out the changes that the new legislation will bring. The work is divided into five chapters whereas each of the chapters focuses on the specific issue of the share transfer. The first chapter defines the <b>share</b> in <b>a</b> limited liability company and introduces it as an eligible subject-matter of the legal relations. The second chapter deals with the various modes of the <b>transfer</b> of <b>a</b> <b>share</b> and certain preconditions of the <b>transfer</b> of <b>a</b> <b>share</b> such as the consents with the transfer and the necessary respect of the duty of loyal behaviour of the company's members.

40|$|We study {{economic}} conflicts using a game theoretical approach. We model {{a conflict}} between two agents where each one has two possible strategies: cease-fire or neglect the truce. Under this setting, we use the concept of pre-donations, namely, a redefinition of the game where agents commit to <b>transfer</b> <b>a</b> <b>share</b> of their output to the other agent (Sertel, 1992), and explain under which conditions a system of pre-donations can facilitate a truce.

However, in many cases there are no sufficient conditions for the scheme or pre-donations to be effective. We also analyze some limitations of this framework and extend the model {{in order to deal}} with some of these flaws.

40|$|Theories of {{employee}} ownership implicitly assume that its essential features {{are the same}} in all countries. In fact, employee ownership varies considerably across institutional environments. In this paper, I compare its development in the United States, Germany, and Sweden {{to show that the}} institutional background - in particular, the existing bodies of corporate and labor law - against which a program {{of employee}} ownership arises determines its course. Background institutions determine the cost of worker control over management, the cost of collective decision-making, and the expected gains from risk-bearing. Those consequences of corporate and labor law in turn determine whether employee ownership legislation transfers, or creates incentives for firms to <b>transfer,</b> <b>a</b> <b>share</b> of profits to workers (residual income rights); or whether legislation instead empowers workers to raise the present and/or deferred price of labor in proportion to profitability (control). Workers and their representative organizations push (or allow) only those employee ownership programs that secure what is absent but feasible in light of their existing range of tools. Even when employee ownership is a viable program, employee ownership legislation can only augment, not revise, the present institutional resources of organized labor...|$|E

40|$|Globalization, either {{directly}} or indirectly (e. g. through structural adjustment reforms), has called for profound changes in the previously existing institutional order. Some changes adversely impacted the production and market environment of many coffee producers in developing countries resulting in more risky and less remunerative coffee transactions. This paper focuses on customization of a tropical commodity, fair-trade coffee, as an approach to mitigating the effects of worsened market conditions for small-scale coffee producers in less developed countries. fair-trade labeling is viewed as a form of “de-commodification” of coffee through product differentiation on ethical grounds. This is significant not only as a solution to the market failure caused by pervasive information asymmetries along the supply chain, but also as a means of revitalizing the agricultural-commodity-based trade of less developed countries (LDCs) that has been languishing under globalization. More specifically, fair-trade {{is an example of how}} the same strategy adopted by developed countries’ producers/ processors (i. e. the sequence product differentiation - institutional certification - advertisement) can be used by LDC producers to increase the reputation content of their outputs by transforming them from mere commodities into “decommodified” (i. e. customized and more reputed) goods. The resulting segmentation of the world coffee market makes possible to meet the demand by consumers with preference for this “(ethically) customized” coffee and to <b>transfer</b> <b>a</b> <b>share</b> of the accruing economic rents backward to the Fair-trade coffee producers in LDCs. It should however be stressed that this outcome cannot be taken for granted since investments are needed to promote the required institutional innovations. In Italy FTC is a niche market with very few private brands selling this product. However, an increase of FTC market share could be a big commercial opportunity for farmers in LDCs and other economic agents involved along the international coffee chain. Hence, this research explores consumers’ knowledge of labels promoting quality products, consumption coffee habits, brand loyalty, willingness to pay and market segmentation according to the heterogeneity of preferences for coffee products. The latter was assessed developing a D-efficient design where stimuli refinement was tested during two focus groups. fair-trade coffee, product decommodification, choice experiments, International Relations/Trade,...|$|E
