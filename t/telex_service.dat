50|$|Of {{very great}} {{consideration}} is the town's tremendous improvement in {{social services and}} infrastructure facilities since 1975. In the 1980s and 1990s, multistory buildings were constructed in the poblacion greatly changing Tuguegarao's skyline.

50|$|A related {{innovation}} {{that came from}} AUTODIN was Western Union's computer based EasyLink service. This system allowed {{for one of the}} first marketable email systems for non-government users. In addition, the system allowed the same message to be sent simultaneously to multiple recipients via email, fax, mailgram, or <b>telex</b> <b>services</b> as well as allowing messages to be sent from the integrated formats. With the service, users could also perform research utilizing its InfoLink application. EasyLink Services International Corporation is now a separate company.|$|R
50|$|Short-wave {{telephone}} communications {{with other countries}} were opened in 1935. The submarine cable, Scotice, between Scotland and Iceland was opened in 1962. In connection with the cable, <b>telex</b> <b>services</b> were established in Iceland. A year later, the Icecan cable between Iceland and Canada was formally opened. In 1980, the Skyggnir Earth Station came online, and telephone calls to other countries then went via satellite. Direct dialling to other countries became possible for the first time. In 1994, a new submarine cable, CANTAT-3, was opened.|$|R
50|$|Teletex was {{designed}} as an upgrade to the conventional <b>telex</b> <b>service.</b> The terminal-to-terminal communication service of telex would be turned into an office-to-office document transmission system by teletex. Teletex envisaged direct communication between electronic typewriters, word processors and personal computers. These units had storage for transmitting and receiving messages. The use of such equipment considerably enhanced the character set available for document preparation.|$|E

The station discontinued commercial operation in 1998, but is operated occasionally as a historic service - its signal can be tuned in throughout {{a large portion of}} the western hemisphere.|$|E
5000|$|The Telex {{input method}} {{is based on}} a set of rules for {{transmitting}} accented Vietnamese text over telex (máy điện tín) first used in Vietnam during the 1920s and 1930s. <b>Telex</b> <b>services</b> at the time ran over infrastructure that was designed overseas to handle only a basic Latin alphabet, so a message reading [...] "vỡ đê" [...] ("the dam broke") could easily be misinterpreted as [...] "vợ đẻ" [...] ("the wife is giving birth"). Nguyễn Văn Vĩnh, a prominent journalist and translator, is credited with devising the original set of rules for telex systems.|$|R

In 1946 the first <b>Telex</b> <b>service</b> was offered, and in 1976 satellite telephone connections to oil platforms in the North Sea were installed. In 1980 the first steps to digitalise the telephone network were taken.|$|E
5000|$|Western Union {{purchased}} the TWX system from AT&T in January 1969. The TWX {{system and the}} special US area codes (510, 710, 810 and 910) continued right up to 1981 when Western Union completed the conversion to the Western Union Telex II system. Any remaining [...] "3-row" [...] Baudot customers were converted to Western Union <b>Telex</b> <b>service</b> during the period 1979 to 1981. Bell Canada retained area code 610 until 1992; its remaining numbers were moved to non-geographic area code 600.|$|E
50|$|Canada-wide {{automatic}} teleprinter exchange {{service was}} introduced by the CPR Telegraph Company and CN Telegraph in July 1957 (the two companies, operated by rivals Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway, would join to form CNCP Telecommunications in 1967). This service supplemented the existing international <b>telex</b> <b>service</b> that {{was put in place}} in November 1956. Canadian telex customers could connect with nineteen European countries in addition to eighteen Latin American, African, and trans-Pacific countries. The major exchanges were located in Montreal (01), Toronto (02), and Winnipeg (03).|$|E
50|$|Telex {{began in}} the UK as an {{evolution}} from the 1930s <b>Telex</b> Printergram <b>service,</b> appearing in 1932 on a limited basis. This used the telephone network {{in conjunction with a}} Teleprinter 7B and signalling equipment {{to send a message to}} another subscriber with a Teleprinter, or to the Central Telegraph Office.|$|R
50|$|<b>Telex</b> {{complements}} <b>services</b> like Tor (anonymity network) {{by placing}} Telex {{stations in the}} network infrastructure of free countries. A client can create a TLS tunnel that is indistinguishable from allowed traffic. That way, firewalls in censored countries are neither able to detect nor to block access to specific parts of the Internet, assuming they allow access at all.|$|R
50|$|Whilst in Singapore, Wilde founded Contact Communication Services in 1983, a {{telecommunications}} company specialising in high-speed data communications and offering low-cost <b>telex</b> relay <b>services</b> throughout South-East Asia. The company quickly expanded through {{the establishment of}} operational offices in Hong Kong, East and West Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Australia. Wilde eventually exited the company through a sale to European Telecommunication giants, the Great Northern Telegraph Company of Copenhagen in 1988.|$|R
