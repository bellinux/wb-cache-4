5|$|The {{report also}} {{considered}} using specialised Vietnamese language {{skills as a}} means of gathering intelligence and to control the minds of Vietnamese troops, but discarded it, citing that infiltration and clandestine anti-colonial techniques were rendering them irrelevant. The report thus concluded that deeper specialisation would not improve intelligence, and that a degree of expertise – to improve command skills – was all <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> need.|$|E
5|$|During the Han Dynasty, silk became {{progressively}} more valuable {{in its own}} right, and became more than simply a material. It was used to pay government officials and compensate citizens who were particularly worthy. By the same token <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> sometimes estimate the price of products according to a certain weight of gold, {{the length of the}} silk cloth became a monetary standard in China (in addition to bronze coins). The wealth that silk brought to China stirred envy in neighboring peoples. Beginning in the 2nd century BCE, the Xiongnu regularly pillaged the provinces of the Han Chinese for around 250 years. Silk was a common offering by the emperor to these tribes in exchange for peace.|$|E
5|$|However, out at {{the site}} of the accident, it was {{discovered}} that the bags of cement had solidified and had to be separated before the BX could be raised and the salvage could not be completed before freeze-up. In the spring of 1920, the salvage work was completed and at a cost of $40,000 the BX was raised and patched sufficiently to get her back to Fort George. The newly overhauled BC Express pushed her back upstream through the Fort George Canyon and to the shipyard at Fort George. This would be the first time in the history of sternwheelers <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> push another upriver through a canyon. That it could be accomplished was a fitting testament to the craftsmanship of Alexander Watson Jr and the skill of Captain Browne and Captain Bucey.|$|E

Even if this had been reported from many different places, so <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> have to exclude the possibility that all agreed upon a lie, yet, we would not accept this as proof to the contrary, for the moon is not seen in the same way by different people...

5|$|One of {{the newest}} residences on the Boca Raton campus is the Innovation Village Apartments (IVA), {{consisting}} of two buildings: IVA North and IVA South. It is a 1,200-bed apartment-style housing facility for upperclassmen, graduate, and medical students. It offers amenities <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> find in a high-rise apartment complex: lounges, retail dining, fitness centers, a pool/cabana, a volleyball court, common areas, and more. The facility opened in fall 2011. FAU's newest residence hall is Parliament Hall, a lakeside freshmen housing facility offering 614 beds, a fitness center, lounges, retail dining, and views of the nearby Atlantic Ocean from top floors.|$|E
5|$|The form of {{the second}} {{movement}}, an Andante in B-flat major, is indefinable. The movement involves elements of a theme and variations, but also has characteristics of both a ternary form movement and a rondo. Unlike a conventional theme and variation movement, the minor mode variation is placed immediately after the statement of the theme; normally, the minor mode theme would be held back for later in the movement. The second variation involves very little actual variation, and is closer to a literal re-statement of the theme <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> see in ternary form or a rondo. Also unconventionally, {{the second and third}} so-called variations are separated by an eight-measure free-form passage. The cello enjoys a prominent role throughout the movement, with the viola often substituting as the bass accompaniment. The cello also presents the movement's opening theme.|$|E

An early intervention to manage sleep would overall relieve patient with side effects.|$|E
25|$|La Mancha is {{a region}} of Spain, but mancha (Spanish word) means spot, mark, stain.

25|$|West, for his part, cites a known {{software}} {{issue with}} phones like Hedgepeth's {{that resulted in}} inaccurate timestamps. He discounts the background sound as being music, since his analysis did not produce any sounds like percussion, a heavy bass or synthesizers. Further, he adds, there are none of the background sounds, like glasses clinking and others talking, <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> associate with a nightclub.|$|E
25|$|Declaration against interest: A {{statement}} that would incriminate or expose the declarant to liability {{to such an}} extent that it can be assumed he would only make such a statement if it were true. It would be assumed <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> lie to further one's interests, so a statement against his interests (such as exposing oneself to criminal or civil liability) likely would not be made unless it were true.|$|E
25|$|The many-worlds {{interpretation}} {{could be}} one possible way to resolve the paradoxes <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> expect to arise if time travel {{turns out to be}} permitted by physics (permitting closed timelike curves and thus violating causality). Entering the past would itself be a quantum event causing branching, and therefore the timeline accessed by the time traveller simply would be another timeline of many. In that sense, it would make the Novikov self-consistency principle unnecessary.|$|E

25|$|In Scandinavian folklore, witches who magically {{replenish}} food sometimes {{appear in}} tales, the food usually being herring. However, in fear <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> waste away {{if one were}} fed the same morsel again and again, folk tales describe {{the breaking of the}} herring bones when eating it as a form of precaution. Thematic similarities—bone breaking ending food rejuvenation—between this folk belief and the Old Norse tales of Tanngrisnir and Tanngnjóstr have led scholars Reimund Kvideland and Henning Sehmsdorf to highlight a connection between the two.|$|E
25|$|Proof {{beyond a}} {{reasonable}} doubt, therefore, is proof of such a convincing character <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> be willing to rely and act upon it without hesitation in {{the most important of}} one's own affairs. However, it does not mean an absolute certainty. The standard that must be met by the prosecution's evidence in a criminal prosecution is that no other logical explanation can be derived from the facts except that the defendant committed the crime, thereby overcoming the presumption that a person is innocent unless and until proven guilty.|$|E

25|$|While some science related {{subjects}} {{were not allowed}} in the government curriculum in the 1850s the private institutions could also not follow science courses {{due to lack of}} funds required to establish laboratories etc. The fees for scientific education under the British rule were also high. The salary <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> get in the colonial administration was meager and made the prospect of attaining higher education bleak since the native population was not employed for high positions in the colonial setup. Even the natives who did manage to attain higher education faced issues of discrimination in terms of wages and privileges.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} half of the 10th century, between the fall of Tang Dynasty and the rise of Song, there was brisk trading between the {{overseas}} world with the Fujian kingdom of Min and the rich Guangdong kingdom of Nan Han. Srivijaya undoubtedly benefited from this. Sometime around 903 CE, the Muslim writer Ibn Rustah was so impressed with the wealth of the Srivijayan ruler that he declared <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> not hear of a king who was richer, stronger or who had more revenue. The main urban centres of Srivijaya were then at Palembang (especially the Karanganyar site near Bukit Seguntang area), Muara Jambi and Kedah.|$|E
25|$|Jefferson {{was raised}} in the Church of England {{at a time when it}} was the {{established}} church in Virginia and only denomination funded by Virginia tax money. Before the Revolution, parishes were units of local government, and Jefferson served as a vestryman, a lay administrative position in his local parish. Office-holding qualifications at all levels—including the Virginia House of Burgesses, to which Jefferson was elected in 1769—required affiliation with the current state religion and a commitment <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>would</b> neither express dissent nor do anything that did not conform to church doctrine. Jefferson counted clergy among his friends, and he contributed financially to the Anglican Church he attended regularly.|$|E
