5|$|I {{asked him}} not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> field, {{that you were}} going there. He laughed at the idea of being {{restricted}} to any locality and said he intended to go whether I aided him or not. I was anxious to secure the cooperation of such a worker as an honor to my corps. I could not be responsible for the field he selected in as much as I pay him no salary and a portion of his expenses. You will see therefore that while it is not a pleasant thing to work in competition with others it seems almost a necessity. You can sympathize.|$|E
500|$|As {{the first}} female {{presenter}} of Grandstand, Helen Rollason was a pioneer of British sports broadcasting, an industry that was predominantly male at the time, and she established a precedent that allowed others to follow. Sue Barker, Hazel Irvine, Gail McKenna, Shelley Webb and Gabby Yorath all followed in Rollason's footsteps to become noted UK sports presenters, with Yorath joining ITV as their first female sports presenter in the late 1990s, where she co-hosted the football show On the Ball and was a contributor to The Premiership. Yorath paid tribute to Rollason shortly after her death, saying she would be [...] "an icon for young girls who want <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> field because she showed what could be done. She was a great example to everyone." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} for the New York Times magazine, Danger Mouse was compared to a film auteur, basing his music production philosophy on the cinematic philosophy of directors like Woody Allen. [...] "Woody Allen was an auteur: he did his thing, and that particular thing was completely his own," [...] he said. [...] "That's what I decided to do with music. I {{want to create a}} director's role within music, which is what I tried to do on this album (St. Elsewhere)... I can create different kinds of musical worlds, but the artist needs the desire <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> world... Musically, there is no one who has the career I want. That's why I have to use film directors as a model." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I propose <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> all <b>that</b> {{at length}} after breakfast,' {{returned}} Alexander. 'There is the half-hour going; {{we must not}} keep Miss Mackenzie waiting.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's the {{district}} visiting instinct, I suppose," [...] said Melville. [...] "They all have it. It's the canvassing. All women like <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> houses <b>that</b> don't belong to them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's no need <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> all <b>that</b> again, young feller. You {{accepted}} 'im {{freely and}} without prejudice when the fair exchange was suggested, so {{for all practical}} intents and purposes he is your Reggie Byng. I 'ope you're going to send him a wedding-present." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it's all right; {{you are the}} new boys. You are <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> planing-shop," [...] and {{he pointed}} {{to one of the}} doors opening into the yard.|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] {{said his}} wife, [...] "it would have frightened {{me to death}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> room and see that head on a cushion on a table--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When Mr. Temple comes in, {{he is not}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> room," [...] I said, {{pointing}} {{to the door of}} the saloon; [...] "I have my reasons for requesting it." ...|$|E
6000|$|A sudden light {{illuminated}} Uncle Billy's face again, but he said, with a grim desperation, [...] "Not to-night! I've got <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> town. <b>That</b> fren' o' mine expects me <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the theayter, don't ye see? But I'll be out to-morrow at sun-up, and we'll fix up {{this thing}} o' the ranch." ...|$|R
6000|$|Christina shrugged her shoulders. [...] "Every {{one expects}} me <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> ecstacies over <b>that!</b> Could {{anything}} be more vulgar? They may chuckle by themselves! Will {{you let me}} stay to dinner?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{bugs and}} ants that I find {{here are the}} finest flavored in the world," [...] {{declared}} the yellow hen, [...] "and {{there are plenty of}} them. So here I shall end my days; and I must say, Dorothy, my dear, that you are very foolish <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back <b>into</b> <b>that</b> stupid, humdrum world again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't," [...] she interrupted, almost beseechingly. [...] "Mr. Brown, {{you were}} very good to me just then. Thank you! I was most abominably rude <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> room without your permission." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} foolish <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> in the dark," [...] he thought. [...] "I might fall into some ugly hole, or have worse luck. I'll stay here and see what comes." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's mad as a {{medicine}} man, is Clark, <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> country {{with less than}} two hundred rifles. And he'll force us, will he? I'd as lief have the King for a master." ...|$|E
60|$|Just then Martin heard a {{very low}} voice close to his ear {{speaking}} to him, but when he looked round he could see no person near him. He {{knew it was the}} same voice which had spoken to him in the cave where he slept, and had told him <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down <b>into</b> <b>that</b> place underground.|$|R
60|$|It {{was then}} that he had met Captain Hannock, who was an old school chum, and been persuaded <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> the scheme <b>that</b> had ended so disastrously. The {{remainder}} the reader already knows.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would to}} me," [...] she retorted, with tender reproach. [...] "Do you suppose {{it would be}} {{pleasant}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> a family <b>that</b> didn't like you? Suppose papa and mamma didn't like you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not," [...] said Cheyne. [...] "I don't {{know that}} it is my {{business}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> question; but {{one or two of the}} efforts you have made lately would scarcely impress the fact on me." ...|$|E
60|$|As I say, it {{was when}} Jeff made money that they saw how gifted he was, and when he lost it,--but still, there's no need <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>that.</b> I believe it's {{something}} the same in other places too.|$|E
6000|$|Curtis took a seat, while Brisbane {{stretched}} {{himself out}} in a big chair and fixed his cold, gray-blue eyes on the soldier, who hesitated a moment before replying, [...] "I don't think it wise <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> matter, Senator." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's nothin' in the house," [...] said Mrs. Lecks, [...] "which {{you need}} {{put your hand}} to; but, if you choose <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out <b>into</b> <b>that</b> garden, and see if there's {{anything}} {{can be done in}} it, or got out of it,--that is, if you know anything about garden work,--I'm sure we'd be very glad of any fresh vegetables we could get." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{light came}} to the {{darkness}} of little Otto's wonderment; he saw what all this talk meant and why his father had come hither. He was to leave the happy, sunny silence of the dear White Cross, and <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out <b>into</b> <b>that</b> great world that he had so often looked down upon from the high windy belfry on the steep hillside.|$|R
6000|$|... "If I am <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> {{partnership}} with <b>that</b> man alone," [...] said Mr. Brown, turning to his young friend almost in despair, [...] "I may {{prepare for the}} Gazette at once.--And for my grave!" [...] he added, solemnly.|$|R
6000|$|Sister,' {{said the}} youngest, 'I cannot think {{how you can}} tempt us to break our father's command. When he told us not <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> room {{he must have known}} what he was saying, and have had a good reason for saying it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{not to say}} high-colored, {{but with}} a bloom like a Chiny rose. But always smelling those leather books, what can be expected? Do rest a little this morning, madam. Let me say you are ill and not able <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> close library." ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{stopped a}} moment and pulled the team up again. [...] "I wonder if you can guess what it will cost me <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> store, but I am going. After all, {{it would be a}} little absurd for Charley Leland's wife to be particular." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{great deal}} better. I {{will tell you}} now that I could never induce myself <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> church with <b>that</b> man as his bride. With a man I didn't love I might have done so, but not with a man I despised." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nathaniel Peacock and I are minded <b>to</b> <b>go</b> {{with you}} <b>into</b> <b>that</b> new world, Captain John Smith, if so be you permit us," [...] I said, [...] "and there we will serve you with honesty and industry." ...|$|R
50|$|The humeral veil {{is one of}} {{the liturgical}} vestments of the Roman Rite, also used in some Anglican and Lutheran churches. It {{consists}} of a piece of cloth about 2.75 m long and 90 cm wide draped over the shoulders and down the front, normally of silk or cloth of gold. At the ends there are sometimes pockets in the back for hands <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> so <b>that</b> the wearer can hold items without touching them with the hands.|$|R
60|$|The tumbled darkling sky, monstrous {{masses of}} {{frowning}} blue, with icy gaps of cold light, {{was like the}} great confusions of the war. All our youth has had <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> terrible and destructive chaos--because of the kings and churches and nationalities sturdier-souled men would have set aside.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, friends," [...] said Kenneth McTavish, [...] "you {{may hold}} what opinion you like on that point, but my {{business}} just now is <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> town {{and see if}} I can find Junkie Brook. The sooner I do so the better, so let those who choose follow me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{she said}} hurriedly, [...] "I think you can. I have an idea. He is afraid <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>that</b> cave, I am sure. Let us hide {{ourselves}} there. We can take food and shall {{have plenty of}} water, whereas, unless rain falls, he can get nothing to drink." ...|$|E
60|$|The naval {{camp was}} now broken up, the sailors {{returned}} on board ship, {{and the army}} prepared <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> winter quarters, <b>that</b> is to say, to dig deep holes under their tents, to erect sheltering walls, {{and in some instances}} to dig complete subterranean rooms.|$|R
6000|$|After dinner we men-folks (leaving the women, in the [...] "good old way," [...] {{to clear}} away the dinner dishes) {{went out on}} the grass under the trees, and as I talked of my {{mountaineering}} Uncle Frank said, with a wistful note in his voice, [...] "I've always wanted <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out <b>into</b> <b>that</b> country with you. Chasing a deer through a Wisconsin swamp don't satisfy me--I'd like to get into the grizzly bear country--but now I'm too old." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{main reason}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> hiatus was <b>that,</b> in early 2003, their lead singer Gwen Stefani started {{work on her}} 1980s-inspired new wave/dance-pop music side project, under which she has {{released}} two solo albums—Love. Angel. Music. Baby. on November 23, 2004 and The Sweet Escape on December 5, 2006.|$|R
