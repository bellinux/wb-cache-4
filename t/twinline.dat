5000|$|Over {{the past}} three centuries, {{hundreds}} of music notation systems have been proposed as alternatives to traditional western music notation. Many of these systems seek to improve upon traditional notation by using a [...] "chromatic staff" [...] in which each of the 12 pitch classes has its own unique place on the staff. Examples are the Ailler-Brennink notation, Jacques-Daniel Rochat's Dodeka system, Tom Reed's <b>Twinline</b> notation, Russell Ambrose's Ambrose Piano Tabs, Paul Morris' Clairnote, John Keller's Express Stave, and José A. Sotorrio's Bilinear Music Notation. These notation systems do not {{require the use of}} standard key signatures, accidentals, or clef signs. They also represent interval relationships more consistently and accurately than traditional notation. The Music Notation Project (formerly known as the Music Notation Modernization Association) has a website with information on many of these notation systems.|$|E
5000|$|Historically, high {{altitude}} kite flights {{were made by}} atmospheric scientists and meteorologists in the late 19th to early 20th centuries. Routine flights around the world were made using steel wire with single kites and kite trains. The highest recorded flight was made by a German meteorological station at Lindenberg in 1919. It is reported that the top kite reached 31,955 ft above the launch point. The line was over 20 km of high tensile steel piano wire with a breaking strength varying between 134 and 225 kg. [...] In 2014 the single-line single-kite altitude world record was made using a kite line of Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE, Dyneema) with 300 pound breaking-strength. Robert Moore and his team used 12,400 metres of line to fly a 12 square metre kite to 16,009 feet above the launch point. Dyneema, a braided Ultra High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMWPE) line, and the identically structured line, Spectra, are stronger and lighter than Kevlar for a given diameter. One {{of the most important}} characteristics of line for {{high altitude}} kite flying is small diameter and high strength to weight ratio. The greatest barrier to high altitude kite flights is aerodynamic line drag. The use of Dyneema over an extended period has shown that it is highly resistant to ultra violet degradation in comparison to Kevlar. Richard Crawford, a high altitude flyer from the USA, made an attempt on the world single kite altitude record using a 220 lb test, Technora line manufactured by <b>Twinline.</b> He reported that he flew a delta kite to approximately 6,500 ft in September 2008.|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} were {{conducted at the}} University of Arizona Maricopa Agricultural Center in 2002 designed to evaluate cotton yield and fiber quality at various plant populations and to test cotton variety performance in a <b>twinline</b> per bed cotton production system. The plant population experiment consisted of four target populations which included 60, 80, 100, and 120, 000 plants per acre (PPA) and two varieties, Stoneville 4892 BR and AG 3601. The resulting plant populations were 52800, 69200, 82800 and 96200 for ST 4892 BR and 54800, 70800, 90500 and 104500 for AG 3601. The two lowest plant populations resulted in the highest lint yields for both varieties and were similar {{but there was a}} significant linear of decreasing yield with increasing plant population. The highest lint yields in the twin line variety experiment were DP 449 BR (1743 lb/acre) and DP 5415 R (1702 lb/acre) which were not statistically different...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} {{here the}} development of the Impulse Slot Antenna (ISA), which is a conformal ultra-wideband (UWB) antenna printed onto a non-conducting aircraft wing. This antenna, which looks out over the wingtip, will likely be useful in UWB radar applications with only limited space available for an antenna. We describe the fabrication and testing of the ISA and a number of earlier designs, and we demonstrate the improved performance of the ISA over its predecessors. The frequency range of interest is 250 MHz to 2 GHz, and we built a series of 1 / 8 th scale models operating in the range of 2 - 16 GHz. We first investigated several tapered slot antennas with 50 -ohm input impedance. However, none of these exhibited satisfactory performance. This led to {{the development of}} the ISA, which is a 200 -Ω hybrid antenna consisting of flattened biconical coplanar plates near the feed and a spline-tapered slot farther out. The antenna is fed by a 50 -to- 200 -ohm splitter balun through a 200 -ohm <b>twinline.</b> This device performed nearly as well as the Farr Research TEM sensor, model TEM- 1 - 50, while avoiding the aerodynamic drag of a TEM horn. In this paper we design, build, and test an ISA, and compare its performance to its immediate predecessor, the linear tapered slot antenna (LTSA) and to the Farr Research model TEM- 1 - 50 sensor. 1...|$|E
40|$|Twin-line (two seed lines 7. 25 in apart per bed) and {{conventional}} single seed line per bed cotton production systems were compared at 16 sites across Arizona and Blythe, Ca. in 2002. The twin-line system produced more lint than the conventional single-line system at 4 of 16 locations; the yields of the <b>twinline</b> and single-line systems were 1273 and 1186 lb/acre, 1572 and 1461 lb/acre, 1478 and 1290 lb/acre, and 1309 and 1210 lb/acre, respectively, at the Grasty, Ramona, Rovey, and Wells sites, respectively. There {{were no significant}} differences in yield or fiber micronaire in 7 of the 16 experiments. The twin-line system produced less lint than the conventional system at 5 of 16 locations; yields of the twin-line and single-line systems were 2019 and 2189 lb/acre, 1400 and 1489 lb/acre, 1537 and 1845 lb/acre, 1065 and 1200 lb/acre, and 1271 and 1431 lb/acre, respectively, at the Chaffin (75 K), Cooley, Hull, Papago, and Wakimoto sites, respectively. Fiber micronaire was reduced in five experiments; the micronaire values were 4. 25 and 4. 73, 4. 46 and 4. 78, 4. 60 and 4. 85, 4. 76 and 4. 98, and 4. 93 and 5. 15, in the twin-line and single-line systems, respectively, at the Rogers, Papago, Grasty, Hull, and Perry sites, respectively. Research will continue in 2003 in order to develop system comparison data for multiple years and to elucidate the reasons for the variable results measured in the 2002 cotton season...|$|E
