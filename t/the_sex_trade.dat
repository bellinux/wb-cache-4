5|$|In 2001, Falle began {{counselling}} {{women in}} prostitution at Streetlight Support Services. Once she received her diploma from George Brown College, she redeveloped the organization's Choices program, a four-week program that helps women leave prostitution. Between 1997 and 2005, Choices helped 325 {{women out of}} <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> <b>trade.</b> Women entered into the program through {{the criminal justice system}} after being arrested for offences related to prostitution. By 2011, Falle had conselled more than 800 women. Of these women, 97% wrote on their intake surveys that they wanted to exit the sex industry, and 95% wrote that they had been physically abused by either a pimp, a client, or another woman in the sex industry. Falle believed these statistics to be representative of women in prostitution in Canada because the women she counselled did not come to her by choice; they were required to undergo the counselling by court order. In 2010, Falle said that hundreds of the women she had met were controlled by pimps, either as sexual partners or as traffickers. She also said that women in prostitution tend to be moved around a lot because they tend to fetch higher prices when they are new to a region. One of the women she counselled through Streetlight Support Services had been kept in a closet when she was not providing sexual services to men.|$|E

25|$|Prostitution in Pakistan is a taboo {{culture of}} sex-trade that exists as an open secret but illegal. Prostitution is largely based in {{organisational}} setups like brothels or furthered by individual call {{girls in the}} Punjab province of Pakistan. <b>The</b> <b>sex</b> <b>trade</b> is deemed illegal in the country due to the declaration of extramarital sex as an immoral activity.

25|$|Although, {{as noted}} above, the women {{staffing}} comfort facilities {{were intended to}} be those already involved in <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> <b>trade,</b> in practice there were nowhere near enough prostitutes available, especially in the Tokyo area.

Tokyo's most famous red light district, Yoshiwara, had been reduced from a prewar population of 2,000 prostitutes to only a few dozen {{by the end of}} the war. Therefore, it was inevitable that efforts were made to recruit from the general population, a tactic that was authorized by the police.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{international}} NGOs {{and human rights}} organisations have criticised the PRC government for failing {{to comply with the}} UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, accusing PRC of penalising and abusing lower tier prostitutes, many of whom are victims of human trafficking, while exonerating men who buy sex, and ignoring the ongoing problems of governmental complicity and involvement in <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> <b>trade</b> industry. The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women reads: Art. 6: States Parties shall take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to suppress all forms of traffic in women and exploitation of prostitution of women. However, it does not advocate a system of legal and regulated prostitution. There has, though, been some calls for legalization; a minor rally for this caused was held in 2010 organized by sex worker activist Ye Haiyan, who was arrested by police for her role in organizing the protests.|$|E
25|$|The plot {{begins in}} 1992 with an elderly woman, Aliide Truu, {{who lives in}} a remote portion of Estonia. The woman had {{isolated}} herself from the surrounding society and watches the youth of her nation, including her daughter, leaving the countryside for the more urban regions and Finland. One day while looking out the kitchen window, she discovers Zara, the granddaughter of her sister Ingel. Zara had been forced to partake in <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> <b>trade</b> by the Russian Mafia but escaped them. The only guide she had to help her find help, was a photograph from her grandmother with Aliide's name on it. The story then continues with a series of flashbacks which develops the relationship of Aliide and her sister, which hinged upon their competition for the love of Hans Pekk during World War II. The story ends as Aliide begins to reconcile herself with her jealousy of her sister and Zara's redemption from her disenchantment with the world caused by her sexual subjugation.|$|E

25|$|The clan {{system in}} South Asia, {{involving}} various clans and sects, {{has always been}} a ground for segregated skill development. In the region, occupational clans evolved over time providing specific skills to the society through hereditary exclusion from others. Being a blacksmith, goldsmith, shoemaker, or gardener etc. Thus, became hereditary professions of specific communities. Over time, a professional clan which favoured the society with services of prostitution also evolved. Men and women belonging to the community committed themselves to <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> <b>trade,</b> where men stayed as supportive influences and women were the main workers. The non-elite had a parallel system, that of brothels, which evolved much later when they no longer were controlled by the kings and nobility was loosened. It coincided with the growth of sea-trade where sailors became good clientele for the low-ranking prostitutes. During the British Raj, the earlier nobility was replaced by a new nobility composed of those who showed loyalty for the British. This new nobility was incapable of taking the role of patrons like earlier kings, and so the British provided much need patronage for the profession to grow and regulated the trade.|$|E

Pornai apparently charged one to six obols for each sexual act; hetairai were more likely to receive gifts and favours from their clients, enabling to them to maintain a fiction that they were not being paid for sex.|$|E
500|$|The women's route into <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> <b>trade,</b> as {{described}} by the lists, is usually ascribed to youthful innocence, with tales of young girls leaving their homes for the promises of men, only to be abandoned once in London.

[...] Lenora Norton was apparently [...] "seduced" [...] in such fashion, her entry elucidating on her experience, which occurred {{while she was still}} a child. [...] The [...] "old urban legend" [...] of young girls being apprehended from the crowd by devious bawds is illustrated by William Hogarth's A Harlot's Progress, but although in reality such stories were not unheard of, women entered into prostitution for a variety of reasons, often mundane. [...] Rural immigrants in search of work could sometimes find themselves at the mercy of unscrupulous employers, or manipulated into <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> <b>trade</b> by underhand means. [...] Some entries in Harris's List illustrate how some women managed to lift themselves out of penury. [...] Becky LeFevre, once a streetwalker, used her business sense to amass considerable wealth, as did a Miss Marshall and Miss Becky Child, who are each mentioned in several editions. [...] Many of these women had rich keepers, and some married wealthy aristocrats; Harriet Powell married Kenneth Mackenzie, 1st Earl of Seaforth, and Elizabeth Armistead married Charles James Fox.|$|E

50|$|Before the war, {{the police}} and {{municipal}} judges used their powers to regulate rather than eliminate <b>the</b> <b>sex</b> <b>trades.</b> In antebellum St. Louis, prostitutes working in orderly, discreet brothels were seldom arrested or harassed—unless they were unusually boisterous, engaged in sexual activities outside of their established district, or violated other rules of appropriate conduct. In 1861, St. Louis passed a vagrancy ordinance, criminalizing any woman who walked on the streets after sunset. In 1871, the city passed a law forbidding women from working in bars and saloons, even if the women were owners. These laws were meant to keep prostitution at a minimum but adversely affected women who were legitimately employed.|$|R
