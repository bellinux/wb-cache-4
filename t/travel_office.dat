5|$|On May 19, 1993, Clinton fired seven {{employees}} of the White House <b>Travel</b> <b>Office,</b> causing the White House <b>travel</b> <b>office</b> controversy even though the <b>travel</b> <b>office</b> staff served {{at the pleasure of}} the president and could be dismissed without cause. The White House responded to the controversy by claiming that the firings were done in response to financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief FBI investigation. Critics contended that the firings had been done to allow friends of the Clintons to take over the travel business and the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted.|$|E
5|$|The White House <b>travel</b> <b>office</b> controversy, {{sometimes}} referred to as Travelgate, was the first major ethics controversy of the Clinton administration. It began in May 1993, when seven employees of the White House <b>Travel</b> <b>Office</b> were fired. This action was unusual because although theoretically staff employees serve at the pleasure of the President and could be dismissed without cause, in practice, such employees usually remain in their posts for many years.|$|E

5|$|The White House {{stated the}} firings were done because {{financial}} improprieties in the <b>Travel</b> <b>Office</b> operation during previous administrations had been revealed by an FBI investigation. Critics contended the firings were done to allow friends of President Bill Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton {{to take over}} the travel business and that the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted. Heavy media attention forced the White House to reinstate most of the employees in other jobs and remove the Clinton associates from the travel role.|$|E

25|$|The law conferred broad investigative powers on Starr and {{the other}} {{independent}} counsels named to investigate the administration, {{including the right to}} subpoena nearly anyone who might have information relevant to the particular investigation. Starr would later receive authority to conduct additional investigations, including the firing of White House <b>Travel</b> <b>Office</b> personnel, potential political abuse of confidential FBIfiles, Madison Guaranty, Rose Law Firm, Paula Jones law suit and, most notoriously, possible perjury and obstruction of justice to cover up President Clinton's sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. The Lewinsky portion of the investigation included the secret taping of conversations between Lewinsky and coworker Linda Tripp, requests by Starr to tape Lewinsky's conversations with Clinton, and requests by Starr to compel Secret Service agents to testify about what they might have seen while guarding Clinton. With the investigation of Clinton's possible adultery, critics of Starr believed that he had crossed a line and was acting more as a political hit man than as a prosecutor.|$|E

500|$|According to the White House, the {{incoming}} Clinton administration had heard reports of irregularities in the <b>Travel</b> <b>Office</b> and possible kickbacks {{to an office}} employee from a charter air company. [...] They looked at a review by KPMG Peat Marwick which discovered that Dale kept an off-book ledger, had $18,000 of unaccounted-for checks, and kept chaotic office records. [...] White House Chief of Staff Mack McLarty and the White House counsels thus decided to fire the <b>Travel</b> <b>Office</b> staff and reorganize it. [...] The actual terminations were done on May 19, 1993, by White House director of administration David Watkins. [...] There was also a feeling among the White House and its supporters that the <b>Travel</b> <b>Office</b> had never been investigated by the media due to its close relationship with press corps members and the plush accommodations it afforded them and favors it did for them. (Congress would later discover that in October 1988, a whistleblower within the <b>Travel</b> <b>Office</b> had alleged financial improprieties; the Reagan White House counsel looked into the claim but took no action.) ...|$|E

500|$|Scrutiny of the May 1993 firings of the White House <b>Travel</b> <b>Office</b> employees, {{an affair}} that {{became known as}} [...] "Travelgate", began with charges that the White House had used audited {{financial}} irregularities in the <b>Travel</b> <b>Office</b> operation {{as an excuse to}} replace the staff with friends from Arkansas. The 1996 discovery of a two-year-old White House memo caused the investigation to focus on whether Clinton had orchestrated the firings and whether the statements she made to investigators about her role in the firings were true. The 2000 final Independent Counsel report concluded she was involved in the firings and that she had made [...] "factually false" [...] statements, but that there was insufficient evidence that she knew the statements were false, or knew that her actions would lead to firings, to prosecute her.|$|E
500|$|The House Government Reform and Oversight Committee {{issued its}} {{majority}} report on September 18, 1996, {{in which it}} accused the Clinton administration of having obstructed the committee's efforts to investigate the Travelgate scandal.

[...] The report's chapter titles were lurid: [...] "The White House Stonewalled All Investigations into the White House <b>Travel</b> <b>Office</b> Firings and Related Matters", [...] "The White House Initiated a Full-Scale Campaign of Misinformation in the Aftermath of the <b>Travel</b> <b>Office</b> Firings and President Clinton Led the Misinformation Campaign from the First Days of the Travelgate Debacle", [...] "Foster's Death Shattered a White House Just Recovering from an Abysmal First 6 Months of Administration", and so forth. [...] Democratic members of the Committee walked out in protest over the report, with ranking member Henry Waxman calling it [...] "an embarrassment to you , this committee and this Congress" [...] and [...] "a crassly partisan smear campaign against President Clinton, Mrs. Clinton and this administration." [...] The following month Clinger forwarded the report, along with one on Filegate, to the Independent Counsel, suggesting that the testimony of several witnesses be looked at for possible perjury or obstruction of justice. [...] Democrats said this was politically motivated in an attempt to influence the 1996presidential election.|$|E
