40|$|Graphite {{samples from}} a {{metamorphic}} contact aureole between phyllites of the Cerro Azul Association (Palaeozoic) and La Soledad Monzogranite, in the Venezuelan Andes, were studied by chemical (% inorganic carbon and isotopic distribution), crystallographic (DRX) and spectroscopic (Raman) techniques {{in order to}} assess changes in the graphite {{in the vicinity of the}} contact, the correlation between the different parameters, and the determination of the higher temperature reached by the host rock during igneous intrusion. The δ 13 C reached less negative values near the monzogranite, caused by devolatilization; the graphite present just in contact with the pluton experienced retrograde recrystallization, which causes a shift towards more negative values. The calculated degree of graphitization intervals (GD = 53 – 80) corresponds to a well-structured mineral with ordered packaging. The peak metamorphic temperature at the contact was calculated from crystallographic (XRD) and spectroscopic (Raman) parameters with great agreement in both techniques, registering the 528 ± 16 and 526 ± 20 ºC respectively. The metapelitic rocks reached the Cordierite Zone (cordierite + biotite + muscovite) in the contact aureole where the graphite is well ordered and in hexagonal microtexture. Factors such as fluid activity and the subsequent retrograde recrystallization have an effect on isotopic redistributions after the intrusive event, as well as on <b>the</b> <b>crystallinity</b> <b>change</b> rate with the temperature, avoiding a clear correlation between the isotopic variations of 13 C in graphite and the temperature...|$|E
40|$|Zinc oxide (ZnO) is a well-studied {{wide band}} gap (~ 3. 37 eV) n-type {{semiconductor}} material with significant properties such as large {{exciton binding energy}} (60 meV). Recently, 1 -dimensional ZnO nanostructures have attracted {{a lot of attention}} owing to their dimensionality-dependent chemical, physical, electrical, and magnetic properties. In this project, we have grown patterned low-aspect-ratio, well-separated single ZnO nanorods using a hydrothermal method on two different substrates with dissimilar crystal orientations. ZnO nuclei have been used as a seed layer to compensate the crystal mismatch between the substrates and nanorods. Based on XRD results, in order to have highly oriented nanorods, the seed layer must be annealed over 300 ̊ C. Micro-Raman spectra show that our patterned nanorods have a wurtzite crystal structure, with most nanorods presenting vertical orientation relative to the substrate. Room-temperature micro-photoluminescence spectra from the nanorods show sharp band edge emission at 385 nm and a common broadband defect emission in the visible range. This method is a significant step towards an economical controlled synthesis of 1 -dimensional ZnO for application in mass-production advanced devices. In the second part, undoped and C-doped (C: Mg, Ni, Mn, Co, Cu, Cr, Na) ZnO nanorods were synthesized by a hydrothermal method at temperatures as low as 60 ̊C. The effect of doping on morphology of the ZnO nanorods was visualized by taking their cross section and top SEM images. <b>The</b> <b>crystallinity</b> <b>change</b> of the ZnO nanorods due to each cationic dopant was thoroughly investigated according to their XRD patterns.

Finally, the band gap shift and defect emission of undoped and doped nanorods were measured by a photoluminescence set up at room temperature.

40|$|International audienceThe kinetic model, {{established}} {{in a previous}} article (François-Heude et al., J. Appl. Polym. Sci., in press) to predict the homogeneous oxidation in iPP films typically thinner than 100 µm, is now extended to simulate the oxidation profiles in thicker plates by coupling the oxygen diffusion and its consumption by the chemical reactions. In this perspective, oxygen transport properties (namely oxygen solubility, diffusivity, and permeability) are measured by permeametry on a reference iPP. These values are compared with an exhaustive compilation of literature data to evaluate their variability among the whole iPP family, which one has been reasonably ascribed to initial differences in polymer morphology, but also to evaluate their consistency, especially their temperature dependence between 20 and 140 °C. Failing to simulate oxidation profiles, the kinetic model is then used as an inverse resolution method for estimating more satisfactory values of oxygen transport properties.

Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) was used to analyse the film morphologies. The chemical compositions of the films were investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The optical properties (transmittance and optical indirect band gap) were assessed using UV-VIS spectrophotometry. In {{the first set of}} samples, undoped TiO 2 films were coated on fused quartz substrates and annealed at 750 ° to 900 °C. These films were fully dense, ~ 400 nm thick, and consisted of agglomerated grains. <b>The</b> <b>crystallinity</b> <b>changed</b> from anatase → anatase + rutile →rutile with increasing temperatures.

In the second set, TiO 2 thin films were doped with iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) in concentrations of 1, 3, 5, and 7 wt% (metal basis relative to Ti), and deposited on both FTO and soda-lime-glass substrates, followed by annealing at 500 °C.

In Mn-doped TiO 2 films, the major phase was anatase and its crystallinity decreased with increasing doping owing to lattice expansion.

Results from the radiolysis of the FK- 800 showed predominant main chain scission taking place, these results in the release of volatile fluorine containing products {{and an increase in}} <b>the</b> polymer’s <b>crystallinity.</b> <b>The</b> <b>changes</b> to the FK- 800 ’s structural properties result in an increase in Young’s modulus and yield stress whilst reducing both ultimate tensile strength and elongation at maximum stress. Dynamic mechanical analysis shows the material softening initially upon irradiation, then stiffening as crystallinity increased. TATB was found to turn green and have increased sensitiveness to impact and electric spark discharge with gamma radiation. Analysis by HPLC and LC-MS identified a decomposition product with a mass of 240 g mol- 1. No significant changes to the mechanical properties of TCV were identified; however, its sensitiveness to impact and electric spark discharge were found to increase similar to TATB’s. In conclusion, gamma irradiation of TCV has identified significant changes to the mechanical and chemical properties of the FK- 800 binder, have little to no effect on mechanical properties of PBX up to 100 kGy. The predominant radiolytic effects on TCV were to its hazard characteristics caused by changes in the TATB. A mono-furazan derivative of TATB has been suggested as the decomposition product identified, and as a possible cause for the increase in sensitiveness of TATB upon gamma irradiation. AWE pl...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a mathematical model that describes and even predicts the hydrolytic degradation of aliphatic polyesters. From literature, it is known that the main process of degradation of aliphatic polyesters is the autocatalytic hydrolysis of ester bonds. Because of this hydrolysis, polymer chains are cleaved and the molecular weight will decrease. With time, the molecules become small enough for the system to start losing weight, since the small molecules dissolve in the aqueous medium. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>crystallinity</b> can <b>change</b> during degradation and influence the degradation rate of the polymer and the monomer ratio of a copolymer. In order to test the model several aliphatic polyesters were synthesized. The degradation behavior of these polymers was investigated by placing them in an aqueous environment (pH = 7. 4) at 37 °C. At certain time intervals, samples of the polymers were taken and analyzed. A mathematical model was developed based on the autocatalytic hydrolytic degradation mechanism of aliphatic polyesters and verified with the measured results. Up to now, no models are known that include the autocatalytic hydrolysis behavior of aliphatic polyesters. The calculations of the new developed model are compared with measured results. It shows that it describes the concentration change of all polymer chains present as function of the degradation time. Hence, the change in molecular weight distribution, the decrease of the average molecular weight and the mass loss of the polymer as function of the degradation time can be predicted. This is a major advancement with respect to any earlier developed model. The only unknown input parameter for the model is the hydrolysis rate constant. The mathematical model is valid for semicrystalline as well as amorphous polymers and for copolymers...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} evaluates the {{synthesis}} of biocompatible osteoconductive and osteoinductive nano calcium phosphate (CaP) particles by industrially applied, aerosol-derived flame spray pyrolysis method for biomedical field. Calcium phosphate nanoparticles were produced {{in a range of}} calcium-to-phosphorus ratio, (1. 20 – 2. 19) in order to analyze <b>the</b> morphology and <b>crystallinity</b> <b>changes,</b> and to test the bioactivity of particles. The characterization results confirmed that nanometer-sized, spherical calcium phosphate particles were produced. The average primary particle size was determined as 23  nm by counting more than 500 particles in TEM pictures. XRD patterns, HRTEM, SAED, and SEM analyses revealed the amorphous nature of the as-prepared nano calcium phosphate particles at low Ca/P ratios. Increases in the specific surface area and crystallinity were observed with the increasing Ca/P ratio. TGA–DTA analysis showed that the thermally stable crystal phases formed after 700  °C. Cell culture studies were conducted with urine-derived stem cells that possess the characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells. Synthesized amorphous nanoparticles did not have cytotoxic effect at 5 – 50  μg/ml concentration range. Cells treated with the as-prepared nanoparticles had higher alkaline phosphatase (ALP) enzyme activity than control cells, indicating osteogenic differentiation of cells. A slight decrease in ALP activity of cells treated with two highest Ca:P ratios at 50  μg/ml concentration was observed at day 7. The findings suggest that calcium phosphate nanoparticles produced in this work have a potential to be used as biomaterials in biomedical applications. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht...|$|R

Characterizations of kenaf core wood liquefied residue {{were carried out}} to measure the degree of liquefaction. This provides {{a new approach to}} understand some fundamental aspects of the liquefaction reaction. Functional groups on the raw kenaf core wood and liquefied residue were examined using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). <b>The</b> <b>crystallinity</b> index of <b>the</b> kenaf wood liquefied residue, which represents <b>crystallinity</b> <b>changes</b> of <b>the</b> cellulose component after the liquefaction process, was studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The surface morphology of the wood residue was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The thermal behavior of the residues was analyzed using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Abroad peak around 3450 - 3400 cm- 1 representing OH stretching in lignin start to disappear as P/K ratio increases.

SEM images showed that the small fragments attached on the liquefied kenaf residue surface were gradually removed as the P/K ratio was increased from 1. 5 / 1. 0 to 2. 5 / 1. 0, which is mainly attributed to the greater chemical penetration toward reactive site of the kenaf fibres.

Having good {{mechanical}} and barrier properties, polypropylene films {{are widely used}} in food-packing industry. <b>The</b> relation of <b>crystallinity</b> and orientation of polypropylene with these properties are well known. Temperature increase has an important effect on <b>the</b> <b>crystallinity</b> and orientation of polypropylene. The {{purpose of this study}} is to understand better <b>crystallinity</b> and orientation <b>changes</b> of the cast and bi-axially oriented polypropylene films with respect to temperature effect. These changes were investigated using especially in-situ FT-IR and dichroism as well as XRD and Raman spectroscopy. For this purpose, an in-situ variable temperature set-up is developed and adapted for FT-IR studies. Accordingly, the changes in the peaks related to the amorphous and crystalline contents of the films as well as the peaks reflecting the orientation of the films were investigated over the temperature range from 120 - 170 o C. Temperature cycle was also applied.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Although wood–plastic {{composites}} have be-come more {{accepted and}} used {{in recent years and}} are pro-moted as low-maintenance, high-durability building prod-ucts, they do experience a color change and a loss in me-chanical properties with accelerated weathering. In this study, we attempted to characterize the modulus-of-elastic-ity (MOE) loss of photostabilized high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and composites of wood flour and high-density polyethylene (WF/HDPE) with accelerated weathering. We then examined how weathering changed the surface chem-istry of the composites and looked at whether or not the surface changes were related to the MOE loss. By examining surface chemistry changes, we hoped to begin to understand what caused the weathering changes. The materials were left unstabilized or were stabilized with either an ultraviolet absorber or pigment. After 1000 and 2000 h of accelerated weathering, the samples were tested for MOE loss. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy was employed to monitor carbonyl and vinyl group formation at the surface. <b>Changes</b> in <b>the</b> HDPE <b>crystallinity</b> were also determined with FTIR techniques. It was determined that structural changes in the samples (carbonyl group formation, terminal vinyl group formation, and <b>crystallinity</b> <b>changes)</b> could not be reliably used to predict changes in MOE with a simple linear relationship. This indicated that the effects of crosslinking, chain scission, and <b>crystallinity</b> <b>changes</b> due to ultraviolet exposure and interfacial degradation due to moisture exposure were interrelated factors for the weath-ering of HDPE and WF/HDPE composites. © 2004 Wile...|$|R
