40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} address {{problems}} of accountability in systems of multi-level governance organized around networks, more particularly the system obtaining in <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Union. Discussion {{of these problems}} has previously focused on the ‘accountability deficit’ created when gaps are left by the accountability machinery {{of two of the}} several levels of government, supranational and national. This paper suggests that the hierarchical and pyramidal assumptions that presently underpin accountability theory in the EU context need to be tested and that new evaluative frameworks may be necessary. Using case studies of the Community Courts and <b>European</b> <b>Ombudsman</b> as examples, <b>the</b> paper suggests that new, flatter ‘accountability networks’ are emerging, composed of agencies specializing in a specific method of accountability, which come together or coalesce in a relationship of mutual dependency, fortified by shared professional expertise and ethos. These might ultimately be capable of providing effective machinery for accountability in network governance systems. governance; accountability; networks; European Court of Justice; <b>European</b> <b>Ombudsman...</b>|$|R

40|$|Presentation on {{department}} page: [URL] forskning_isl/isl_working_papers_seriesABSTRACT One relatively unstudied {{development in}} <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Union’s evolving multilayered administrative {{system is the}} development of the ombudsman as a core institution of governance. At the national level, nearly all EU Member States have introduced an ombudsman. At the supranational level, there has been a <b>European</b> <b>Ombudsman</b> (EO) since 1995. This chapter sheds light on the strategies with which the EO proves itself able to build its capacity and adjust its institution successfully to the changing politico-administrative context. Drawing on an analysis of documents and a secondary analysis of existing empirical data, this chapter examines the institutional development of the EO over the past two decades. This chapter describes, first, the turbulent expansion of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> Union’s administrative system in terms of both administrative and accountability institutions. It then focusses on the EO’s development as an institutional ombudsman by examining three elements of its accountability capacity, together with the external, turbulent environment and political context in which it exists. The internal turbulence within the system may be seen in both the way the system is set up (administrative order and accountability landscape) and the way it works (accountability practices). ...|$|R
