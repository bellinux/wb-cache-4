5000|$|Vers libre is {{a poetic}} form of flexibility, {{complexity}} and naturalness {{created in the}} late 19th century in France, in 1886, largely through the activities of La Vogue, a weekly journal founded by Gustave Kahn, {{and the appearance of}} a band of poets unequalled at any one {{time in the history of}} French poetry, the ‘Counter-Romanticism’ led by Baudelaire, Verlaine, Rimbaud, Mallarmé, Laforgue, Corbière, concerned with synaethesis (the harmony or equilibrium of sensation) later described as ‘the moment when French poetry began to <b>take</b> <b>consciousness</b> of itself as poetry’. Gustave Kahn was commonly supposed to have invented the term Vers libre and according to F. S. Flint 'was undoubtedly the first theorist of the techniques'. Later in 1912, Robert de Souza published his conclusion on the genre 'that a vers libre was possible which would keep all the essential characteristics of vers classique, but would free it from the encumbrances which usage had made appear indispensable'. Thus the practice of verse libre was not the abandoning of pattern, but the creation of an original and complicated metrical form for each poem.|$|E
5000|$|Bergson {{really does}} {{distinguish}} the spirit from the body, but {{as opposed to}} in Descartes's classical philosophy the distinction resides in the temporal domain, not in the spatial. The spirit is the abode of the past, {{the body of the}} present; the soul or spirit always anchored in the past, not residing in the present; lodged in the past and contemplating the present. To have or <b>take</b> <b>consciousness</b> of anything, means looking at it from the viewpoint of the past, in light of the past. Contenting oneself with reacting to an external stimulus means being unconscious of the act; an existence within the sheer presence of the body. Consciousness means, invariably, delaying reaction to stimuli, the interval accompanied by the conscious awareness that the spirit is anchored within the past. One becomes conscious while being anchored in the past, in light of the past, in view of appropriate action directed towards the immediate future. The articulation of time — past, present, future — finds place through the union of spirit and body. The more the spirit descends into the past, the more one becomes conscious. The more one acts automatically, the more one exists in the present, in the temporal domain of the body. And one always stays within one domain or the other. True awareness necessitates the united action of body and spirit. According to Bergson, the [...] "impulsive person" [...] suspends his consciousness and stays within the unreflective domain of automatism.|$|E

For Heidegger, humanism <b>takes</b> <b>consciousness</b> as the paradigm of philosophy, leading it to a subjectivism and idealism that must be avoided. Like Hegel before him, Heidegger rejected the Kantian notion of autonomy, pointing out that humans were social and historical beings, as well as Kant's notion of a constituting consciousness.

Class consciousness is thus not a simple subjective act: [...] "as consciousness here is not the consciousness of an object opposed to itself, but the object's consciousness, the act of being conscious of oneself disrupts the objectivity form of its object" [...] (in [...] "Reification and the Proletariat's Consciousness" [...] §3, III [...] "The proletariat's point of view"). In other words, instead of the bourgeois subject and its corresponding ideological concept of individual free will, the proletariat {{has been transformed into}} an object (a commodity) which, when it <b>takes</b> <b>consciousness</b> of itself, transforms the very structure of objectivity, that is of reality.|$|R

Concisely, the main objectives of this paper are: to show clearly the most relevant soil functions; to analyze how soil management can influence positive or negatively soil capacity of production; to present a methodology for private soil assessment, making clear that privates valuate almost exclusively the soil capacity to produce market goods and ser - vices; to stress that many goods and services have global public effects; to emphasize that society ought to recognize soil multifunctionality and must try to impute some value to all those goods and services although some of them have no market value, at present. The paper concludes that: (1) without productive soil life on earth, as we know it, would be impossible; (2) although {{it is almost impossible to}} assess the real value of all goods and services produced by the soil, it is of great importance to develop appropriate methodologies to do so, in order to improve cost-benefit analysis helping to take correct decisions regarding the sustainable use of the soil...|$|E
40|$|In {{this review}} essay, I discuss four recent books ranging from {{philosophical}} to neuropsychological approaches to consciousness. The books {{are just a}} small selection from {{a large number of}} recent texts that have not only been insisting that we should <b>take</b> <b>consciousness</b> as a serious subject for scientific study, but which also have identified themselves with the new field of ‘consciousness studies’. The books in review represent not just new publications of this line of study. They also represent a typical variety of approaches, mirroring different interpretations of ‘the problem of consciousness’. Consciousness studies has developed over the last 20 or so years as an autonomous, yet interdisciplinary, field of research and theory, embracing philosophy, psychology and neuroscience. Since consciousness studies have yet {{to become part of the}} curriculum of mainstream psychology, I first provide an outline of the field of consciousness studies, and its central themes and problems. Furthermore, as the books under review themselves demonstrate, there is no consensus about what even constitutes the problem of consciousness, although each takes consciousness as its central topic. Each of the books attempts, in its own way, to provide an overview of this new field of research, and so, having reviewed each according to it...|$|E

Transformational leaders {{take responsibility for}} all and, guided by positive values, lead society into the future. These {{men and women of}} profound vision give expression to the subconscious aspirations of society that are striving to awaken, and act as a catalyst for their realization. Empathy, compassion, humility, emotional and social intelligence, and effective decision-making skills are characteristics of the transformational leader. Power, wealth and glory hold little value for them, they are above ego and have no thought of personal gain. They <b>take</b> <b>consciousness</b> responsibility for all, far greater than their authority warrants or requires. Espousing the collective cause, they forge ahead with great courage and conviction. Any setback or hurdle is faced with equanimity. Their original and creative thinking converts challenges into opportunities. They know that the unrealized is not unrealizable. They are able to inspire others to realize more of their potential, channelize the collective social energy and organize it into a power that accomplishes. Transformational leadership defines accomplishment in the broadest sense. One country cannot prosper at the cost {{of the rest of the}} world, one group of people cannot be secure when there are others somewhere on the planet who are insecure. No problem is isolated from all else, and a comprehensive solution is possible only for those who have overcome dualistic thinking and can reconcile apparent opposites. Transformational leaders have such an integrated view of every issue and situation, and can usher in a new paradigm of human development that ensures peace, security and well-being for all. This article analyzes the various facets of transformational leadership...|$|E

50|$|The {{human being}} is a {{culmination}} of the substantialisation of the essence; from here the reverted process can begin, that of the re-essentialisation of the substance. The first process, {{the separation of the}} essence or its substantialisation, was also called analysis. The process of the re-essentialistion of the substance is called synthesis. Through this synthetic process which is the human creation, the re-essentialised substance can be transposed as a magnetic double in a great harmonic system, which is the image of the pure essence, regarded as re-essentialised substance. Thus, the essence stand in front of itself and, {{with the help of the}} human creation, <b>takes</b> <b>consciousness</b> of itself. This implies an ethics of creation and a theory of immortality. Through his creations the man constitutes a magnetic double of his personality, which is integrated in the great harmonic system which is the Essence.

40|$|This {{research}} {{deals with}} the Leonardo Sciascia’s writings on art, which are been collected and examined here {{in order to understand}} the complex posture of the Sicilian writer as art reviewer. Even tough he used to confront himself with the work and the reflections of the main contemporary critics and essayists in art matters, he was able to elaborate a very personal way to approach the artistic expressions. So, if on one hand he carefully paid attention to Roberto Longhi’s masterly lesson on the necessity of a literary way in the art criticism exercise, and thus he transfused in his reviews his own system of stylistic solutions and themes experienced in his narrative production, on the other hand he never aimed to a verbal restitution of the work of art, as Longhi did. Sciascia instead chose to write about arts as another declination of his intellectual engagement, an effort to <b>take</b> <b>consciousness</b> of the context in which he lived in by the recognition of the relationships that connected the reality. The work of art seems in this sense exceptionally capable to show this kind of structure of the reality, while it shows at the same time a new order of that. For this reason Sciascia’s writings are built by the proceeding of digressions in order to capture the synonymic substance of the thought and the reality. But the digression are also the natural expression of a passionate gaze upon its loved object, as such art is for the stendhalian «happy few». As art reviewer Sciascia experimented a critical discourse deeply formed by a rational and pragmatic thought as much as by a empathetic participation, according to the legacy of his elective models, Montaigne and Stendhal. ...|$|E
40|$|O presente estudo tem como objetivo analisar com professoras do ensino {{fundamental}} os saberes mobilizados na organização do processo de ensino-aprendizagem e suas implicações na dinamização desse processo. A investigação foi desenvolvida com duas professoras dos anos iniciais do ensino fundamental de uma escola pública do município de Pau dos Ferros-RN. Adota como fundamento a noção de saber como um conjunto de relações individuais e sociais que os sujeitos mantêm com o mundo e consigo mesmo, na relação com o ensinar e o aprender. (CHARLOT, 2000). Considera, ainda, que tais saberes são processos mediados, (re) construídos e mobilizados pelo exercício da reflexão, em contextos dialógicos e interacionais na relação com o outro. (BAKHTIN, 2002, 2003; VYGOTSKY, 1991, 2004, 2005). A abordagem colaborativa foi o referencial teórico-metodológico que orientou o processo de investigação-formação. Ao escolher a investigação colaborativa como orientação do caminho investigativo, parte do pressuposto de que a reflexão crítica e colaborativa desenvolvida com as professoras dos anos iniciais do ensino fundamental contribui para explicitar e ressignificar os sentidos atribuídos aos saberes que estas mobilizam na organização do ensino-aprendizagem e suas implicações nesse processo. Os resultados do processo investigativo e reflexivo desenvolvido com as professoras demonstram que os saberes da trajetória familiar, escolar, acadêmica, profissional e do trabalho vivido constituem o saber-ser docente, e que esses saberes implicam-se na dinâmica do processo de ensinar-aprender, mas nem sempre as professoras tomam consciência deles. A reflexão crítica e colaborativa, mediada pelas ações do descrever, informar, confrontar e reconstruir, oportunizou às partícipes da pesquisa a percepção dos saberes de si e do outro, das dificuldades e das possibilidades na organização do processo de ensino-aprendizagemThe {{present study}} has the objective to analyze with teachers from Elementary School the knowledge mobilized {{in the organization}} of the teaching-learning process, and its implications in the exploitation of that process. The investigation was developed with two teachers from {{the first years of the}} Elementary School, from a public school in Pau dos Ferros-RN. It adopts as basis the notion of knowledge as a set of individual and social relations that the individuals maintain with the world and with themselves, in the teaching and learning relation. (CHARLOT, 2000). It considers yet that the knowledges are immediate processes, reconstructed and mobilized by the practice of reflection, in dialogical and interactional contexts in contact with others. (BAKHTIN, 2002, 2003; VYGOTSKY, 1991, 2004, 2005). The collaborative approach was the theoretical and methodological background that oriented the investigative-educative process. By choosing a collaborative research as basis of the investigative pathway, it starts from the knowledge that the critical and collaborative reflection developed with the teachers from the first years of the Elementary School contribute to explicitate and resignify the meanings assigned to the knowledges that these teachers mobilize {{in the organization of}} the teaching-learning and its implications in this process. The results of the reflexive and investigative process developed with the teachers demonstrate that the familiar, scholastic, academic, professional, and the work knowledges lived, constitute the consciousness of being a teacher, and that these knowledges implicate in the dynamics of the process of teaching-learning, but not always the teachers <b>take</b> <b>consciousness</b> about these knowledges.
