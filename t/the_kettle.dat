5|$|Hard {{surfacing}} {{of roads}} {{in part of}} <b>the</b> <b>Kettle</b> Creek watershed began in 1930 to 1938. The Alvin R. Bush Dam {{was built on the}} creek in the late 1950s to protect against flooding. The creek was the subject of an Operation Scarlift study from 1970 to 1972. A USGS gauge was installed on the stream in 1972. <b>The</b> <b>Kettle</b> Creek Watershed Association (also known as the KWCA) was founded in the late 1990s. The creek became the third Home Rivers initiative of Trout Unlimited in 1998. The main industries in <b>the</b> <b>Kettle</b> Creek watershed in the 21st century are tourism, agriculture, and lumbering.|$|E
5|$|The soils in {{the lower}} part of <b>the</b> <b>Kettle</b> Creek {{watershed}} are highly acidic, deep, and well-drained. A total of 22 percent of the surface rock in this area is interbedded sedimentary rock, while sandstone makes up 78 percent. The Lower Kittanning coal seam is found in <b>the</b> <b>Kettle</b> Creek watershed. Rock formations in <b>the</b> <b>Kettle</b> Creek watershed include the Huntley Mountain Formation, the Burgoon Sandstone, the Pottsville Group, and the Allegheny Group. The Huntley Mountain Formation is from the Devonian period and the Mississippian epoch. The Burgoon Sandstone is from the Mississippian epoch and the Allegheny and Pottsville Groups are from the Pennsylvanian epoch. The Allegheny Group is the only rock formation in the watershed to contain coal that is economically worth mining.|$|E
5|$|In the 1800s, {{settlement}} of {{the upper reaches of}} <b>the</b> <b>Kettle</b> Creek watershed centered on Germania, while the {{settlement of}} the lower reaches centered on the community of Leidy. A community near Trout Run began to attract people in the 1870s and 1880s.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Kettle</b> Creek Path {{used by the}} Native Americans {{historically}} {{linked the}} Cowanesque River with the West Branch Susquehanna River via Kettle Creek. It is possible that Native Americans camped on the creek while hunting and fishing in the area. An Indian village existed {{at the mouth of}} the creek until it was destroyed by the military in 1763.

5000|$|The word {{block was}} derived from the masonry setting of <b>the</b> <b>kettles.</b> <b>The</b> <b>kettles</b> were {{hemispherical}} in form, cast-iron in material, and about 3 ft in diameter. They were sunk in walls of brick or gray limestone from 50 to 100 in a row, sheltered in long, narrow houses. The walls were hollow, admitting the circulation of the fire of a furnace and the heat was driven under <b>the</b> <b>kettles</b> by a powerful blower. A worker tending the furnace would open the close fitting doors and shovel coal which [...] "would disappear in the ferocious glow of the fire." ...|$|R
