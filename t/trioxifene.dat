40|$|<b>Trioxifene</b> (LY 133314) is a {{selective}} estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) with competitive binding activity against estradiol for estrogen receptor � (ER�) and antagonistic activity against ER�-mediated gene expression. The PAIII rat prostatic adenocarcinoma (PCa) is an androgen receptor-negative, ER�- and ER�-positive, spontaneously metastatic rodent tumor cell line. After s. c. implantation of 10 6 PAIII {{cells in the}} tail, s. c. administration of <b>trioxifene</b> (2. 0, 4. 0, 20. 0, or 40. 0 mg/kg-day) for 30 days produced significant (P < 0. 05) inhibition of PAIII metastasis from the primary tumor in the tail to the gluteal and iliac lymph nodes (maximum nodal weight decreases, 86 % and 88 % from control values, respectively). PAIII metastasis to the lungs was significantly inhibited by <b>trioxifene</b> treatment. Numbers of pulmonary foci in PAIII-bearing rats were significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced by <b>trioxifene</b> administration in a dose-related manner (maximal reduction, 98 % from control values). Continual administration of the compound significantly (P < 0. 05) extended survival of PAIII-bearing rats. <b>Trioxifene</b> inhibited the proliferation of PAIII cells at micromolar levels in vitro but did not slow growth of the primary tumor growth in the tail. <b>Trioxifene</b> administration also produced regression of male accessory sex organs. In PAIII-tumor-bearing animals, <b>trioxifene</b> administration produced a maximal regression of 76 % for ventral prostate and 64 % for seminal vesicle (P < 0. 05 for both). SERMs may be preferable to estrogens given their efficacy in experimental PCa models and relative lack of side effects observed in clinical trials. Our data support the contention that <b>trioxifene</b> represents a SERM with potential antimetastatic efficacy {{for the treatment of}} androgen-independent, metastatic PCa...|$|E
