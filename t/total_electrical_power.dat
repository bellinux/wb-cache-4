50|$|The Class 31/4s, {{numbered}} from 31400 to 31469, were conversions of 31/1s {{to which}} ETH was fitted.

The early conversions tapped off the main generator such that none of the ETH power was available for traction even if the ETH was not being used. The traction power output of some of the 31/4 subclass was therefore limited to a maximum of two-thirds of that of the non-ETH variants, this did not help the performance of an already somewhat underpowered locomotive, and late running of these 31/4-hauled services sometimes happened. Later conversions allowed unused ETH power to be used for traction.|$|E
40|$|The energy-conversion {{efficiency}} {{is a key}} metric that facilitates comparison {{of the performance of}} various approaches to solar energy conversion. However, a suite of disparate methodologies has been proposed and used historically to evaluate the efficiency of systems that produce fuels, either directly or indirectly, with sunlight and/or <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> as the system inputs. A general expression for the system {{efficiency is}} given as the ratio of the <b>total</b> output <b>power</b> (<b>electrical</b> plus chemical) divided by the <b>total</b> input <b>power</b> (<b>electrical</b> plus solar).

Herein, system-level efficiencies, beyond the STH efficiency, as well as component-level figures of merit are defined and discussed to describe the relative energy-conversion performance of key photoactive components of complete systems. These figures of merit facilitate the comparison of electrode materials and interfaces without conflating their fundamental properties with the engineering of the cell setup. The resulting information about the components can then be used in conjunction with a graphical circuit analysis formalism to obtain “optimal” system efficiencies that can be compared between various approaches. The approach provides a consistent method for comparison of the performance at the system and component levels of various technologies that produce fuels and/or electricity from sunlight...|$|R

50|$|The {{power level}} of the lamps is rated in watts/area, <b>total</b> <b>electrical</b> input <b>power</b> divided by the lamp's inner wall surface. Cooling of the {{electrodes}} and the lamp envelope is of high importance at high power levels. Air cooling is sufficient for lower average power levels. High power lamps are cooled with a liquid, typically by flowing demineralized water through a tube in which the lamp is encased. Water-cooled lamps will generally have the glass shrunk around the electrodes, to provide a direct thermal conductor {{between them and the}} cooling water. The cooling medium should flow also across {{the entire length of the}} lamp and electrodes. High average power or continuous-wave arc lamps must have the water flow across the ends of the lamp, and across the exposed ends of the electrodes as well, so the deionized water is used to prevent a short circuit. Above 15 W/cm2 forced air cooling is required; liquid cooling if in a confined space. Liquid cooling is generally necessary above 30 W/cm2.|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increasing}} need for automated fault detection tools in buildings. The total energy request in buildings can be significantly reduced by detecting abnormal consumption effectively. Numerous models are used to tackle this problem but either they are very complex and mostly applicable to components level, or they cannot be adopted for different buildings and equipment. In this study a simplified approach to automatically detect anomalies in building energy consumption based on actual recorded data of active <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> for lighting and <b>total</b> active <b>electrical</b> <b>power</b> of a cluster of eight buildings is presented. The proposed methodology uses statistical pattern recognition techniques and artificial neural ensembling networks coupled with outliers detection methods for fault detection.

The method allows to identify patterns of faults occurring in a cluster of bindings; in this way the energy consumption can be further optimized also through the building management staff by informing occupants of their energy usage and educating them to be proactive in their energy consumption. Finally, in the context of smart buildings, the common detected outliers in the cluster of buildings demonstrate that the management of a smart district can be operated with the whole buildings cluster approach...|$|R
