I was enjoying it immensely, I got to go with these guys and fire off AK-47s. I always like to go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I {{got to see the}} world. I used to think that World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously.

[...] The duo set the order of the tracks to cover the four sides of a two-disc vinyl LP. De Homem-Christo remarked, [...] "There was no intended theme because all the tracks were recorded before we arranged the sequence of the album. The idea was to make the songs better by arranging them the way we did; to make it more even as an album." [...] The name Homework, Bangalter explained, relates to [...] "the fact that we made the record at home, very cheaply, very quickly, and spontaneously, trying to do cool stuff." ...|$|E

At the Hydra station, Jack finds his door unlocked and unguarded, and outside reaches a surveillance room, where he sees Kate and Sawyer cuddling together on a monitor.

500|$|I {{remember}} {{not just}} because it was a win, but also because it was a big fight right into the last night. Fabrizia reminded me the other night <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> problem with the brake pads, so we lost a lot of time. We finished three days rallying (with one day to go), night and day, 32 seconds in front of Ari Vatanen. We drove the last special stage for the night, came back to the hotel and I could not sleep at all, four hours {{in front of me and}} no sleep. Then I arrive at the special stage, it's about 42km long, and I look at Fabrizia and I said [...] "OK, we forget everything, and we are at the first stage of the rally again, because one of us will crash." [...] And so Ari hit a rock, and we won the rally.|$|E
500|$|Originally, Descent 3 was {{intended}} to support both a software and a hardware renderer, implying that the rendering process of the game could take place either in the CPU or dedicated hardware like a video card. However, about six months after starting development, the team decided {{to go with a}} hardware-only renderer because it allowed them to create [...] "visually stunning" [...] graphics and maintain a solid frame rate without worrying about the limitations imposed by the software renderer. This was a difficult decision since the team had to scrap many tools and software rendering technology that were already developed. In addition, computers with hardware acceleration were not common at the time the decision was made. As the developers noted, [...] "We knew just by looking at our progress on the game under acceleration <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> beautiful looking game with all the latest technologies — but would anyone actually be able to play it?" [...] Fortunately, as development progressed, hardware acceleration became more popular with each passing year. The game natively supports the Direct3D, Glide and OpenGL rendering APIs for graphics, and the A3D and DirectSound3D technologies for sound.|$|E

500|$|The band {{released}} Deja Entendu through Razor & Tie/Triple Crown Records in June 2003, being {{issued in}} Europe and Australia in October 2003. The album's title, Deja Entendu, is French for [...] "already heard." [...] It was explained as [...] "very tongue-in-cheek" [...] by vocalist Jesse Lacey. Elaborating on the title's meaning, he told MTV, [...] "No {{matter who you}} are or what your band is about, you can't put a record out without people saying it's derivative of something else. So by saying the record's already been heard, it's kind of like saying, 'Yeah, you're right. We're doing something that's already been done before.'" [...] He reinforced, [...] "We're not trying to break new ground in music. We're {{just trying to make}} good music." [...] The album was described as a [...] "stylistic leap" [...] from Your Favorite Weapon, with a [...] "decidedly matured" [...] sound. In an interview with Billboard, Lacey said that although Deja Entendu does offer a different sound, the album [...] "doesn't seem like we're departing from anything, really. I think we always knew <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> lot of potential and there's a lot of different stuff we were able to do, and a lot of different sounds we wanted to make. Not too long after we recorded the first record, we were already wondering where {{we were going to go}} from there." ...|$|E
500|$|The co-music supervisor, Billy Gottlieb, {{called the}} episode a [...] "little mini feature {{film in the}} sense <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> lot of camera {{performances}} with the music." [...] In {{order to get the}} best performances out of the cast and be able to shoot the scenes in various different ways, the producers had the actors go into a music studio in Vancouver and record their respective musical numbers. According to Gottlieb, the actors were very nervous about singing in the episode, despite their parts being around a mere 40 seconds. Actor Joshua Jackson, who plays Peter Bishop, was adamant that he not sing in the episode, despite the fact he frequently sings on set, causing him {{to be one of the}} few cast members with no musical part. As the original script contained no musical number for Jasika Nicole, she emailed Jeff Pinkner specifically asking him to let her sing, which he then approved. Some critics noted their surprise that Tony Award-winning actor Michael Cerveris did not sing in the episode. The producers were initially going to have him sing Django Reinhardt's [...] "Blue Moon", but changed their minds because they thought it would be better to keep the Observer out of the musical aspect of the episode. Despite the pre-recordings, the audio used in the episode was taken from the actors actually singing on set. Tanya Swerling believed the recordings were not a wasted effort however, as it helped make the actors more comfortable about singing on set. At the end of shooting, Gottlieb believed [...] "everybody was great... they could jump on stage and do Broadway and it wouldn't be a problem for any of them". He and other crew members called Jasika Nicole [...] "probably the most accomplished" [...] musical person of the cast. As one of the episode writers, Akiva Goldsman chose the Stevie Wonder song [...] "For Once in My Life".|$|E

2500|$|No [...] "Crystal" [...] {{variants}} of characters {{have been designed}} for Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes, unlike the first game. The Disney Infinity team wanted {{to focus on a}} more diverse array of characters, as said by John Vignocchi [...] "we're not planning on doing the crystal characters again. Our focus this time around – rather than create a whole series of chase characters, {{we wanted to make sure}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> wider variety of characters," [...] he said. [...] "What we decided to do instead was really put our horsepower into creating different characters as opposed to variants. We think our fans appreciate having a character like Star-Lord or Rocket Raccoon as opposed to another version of Mickey Mouse." [...] The game has been designed to be less violent, in order to appeal to a wider audience. Despite this, a Crystal variation of Sorcerer's Apprentice Mickey Mouse will be released.|$|E
2500|$|Development of Rock Band 4 {{began in}} the last quarter of 2014. This {{followed}} from several factors. Harmonix's former CEO and current creative director Alex Rigopulos explained that the studio had awaited both a [...] "critical mass" [...] of adoption for the next-generation consoles, and a [...] "clear and compelling creative vision" [...] for the game before beginning work on a successor—prompting the franchise's hiatus. Rigopulos said that internally if they were going to bring back Rock Band band, they wanted to [...] "really make the best game that we had ever made; <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> vision for what Rock Band 4 was going to be, that made it worth making, really". A clear vision of the goals for the game came about more than a year prior to the game's release. Harmonix's Greg LoPiccolo added that they did not want to try to introduce Rock Band 4 during the new consoles' first year where they would have to compete with major franchises. Funding for development was aided by $15 million in investments from Spark Capital and Foundry Group, not only to support Rock Band 4 but the remake of Harmonix' Amplitude and future projects involving virtual reality.|$|E
