When reading one line, the lines above and below it would appear upside down, {{as can be seen}} in the image at left.|$|E

25|$|A raft is a {{structure}} {{with a flat}} <b>top</b> <b>that</b> floats. It is the most basic boat design, characterised {{by the absence of}} a hull. The classic raft is constructed by lashing several logs, placed side by side, to two or more additional logs placed transverse to the others. In many Asian countries, the rafts are similarly constructed using bamboo.|$|E

25|$|The Hellas {{drainage}} basin may be almost one-fifth {{the area of}} the entire northern plains. A lake in Hellas in today's Martian climate would form thick ice at the <b>top</b> <b>that</b> would eventually be removed by sublimation: the ice would turn directly from a solid to a gas, as dry ice (solid CO2) does on Earth. Glacial features (terminal moraines, drumlins, and eskers) have been found that may have been formed when the water froze.|$|E
25|$|In 1838, he {{also studied}} the still-mysterious perceptual {{illusion}} {{of what is}} still called the Fechner color effect, whereby colors are seen in a moving pattern of black and white. The English journalist and amateur scientist Charles Benham, in 1894, enabled English-speakers to learn of the effect through {{the invention of the}} spinning <b>top</b> <b>that</b> bears his name. Whether Fechner and Benham ever actually met face to face for any reason is not known.|$|E
25|$|Before flight, {{ground support}} {{equipment}} (GSE) supplies cooled, filtered ventilating air to the IU, entering via the large duct {{in the middle of}} the umbilical panel (location 7), and branching into two ducts at the <b>top</b> <b>that</b> are carried around the IU in the cable rack. Downward pointing vents from these ducts release ventilating air to the interior of the IU. During fueling, gaseous nitrogen was supplied instead of air, to purge any propellant gases that might otherwise accumulate in the IU.|$|E

Three classes of thunderstorm cloud tops including storm <b>tops</b> <b>that</b> have a monotonic temperature-height pattern {{with the highest}} point being the coldest point (class 1), <b>tops</b> <b>that</b> have a colocated cold and high point with the warm point on the downward slope {{to the rear of}} the highest point (class 2), and tops in which the cold point is offset upwind from the high point, with a cold-warm couplet straddling the convective cloud top (class 3), are described. A one-dimensional cloud parcel model applied in the overshooting region is used to explore the causes of the storm top's unique temperature/height structures...|$|R
25|$|In {{hydroxyapatite}} implants {{a secondary}} procedure can insert an externalized, round-headed peg or screw into the implant. The prosthesis {{is modified to}} accommodate the peg, creating a ball-and-socket joint: after fibrovascular ingrowth is completed, a small hole can be drilled into the anterior surface of the implant. After conjunctivalization of this hole, it can be fitted with a peg with a rounded <b>top</b> <b>that</b> ﬁts into a corresponding dimple at the posterior surface of the artiﬁcial eye. This peg thus directly transfers implant motility to the artiﬁcial eye.|$|E
25|$|A pet door (also {{known as}} a cat flap or dog door) is an opening in a door to allow pets to enter and exit without the main door's being opened. It may be simply covered by a rubber flap, {{or it may be}} an actual door hinged on the <b>top</b> <b>that</b> the pet can push through. Pet doors may be mounted in a sliding glass door as a new (permanent or temporary) panel. Pet doors may be unidirectional, only {{allowing}} pets to exit. Additionally, pet doors may be electronic, only allowing animals with a special electronic tag to enter.|$|E
25|$|This {{opening on}} the end of the north wing {{consists}} of a full width, battened door bearing four vertical, recessed panels similar to the south door. The frame and brickwork surrounding it are probably reworked. This is especially evident in the brick framing on the <b>top</b> <b>that</b> is now a simple course of Flemish bond. The wooden door frame consists of three sets of flat boards, becoming progressively narrower toward the doorway. There is a bevel between the outermost frame member and a semi-round molding between the two inner boards. Both the north and south doors are secured by strap hinges on the inside.|$|E
