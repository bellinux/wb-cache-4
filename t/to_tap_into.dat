5|$|In 2009, {{the lake}} began being {{filled with water}} {{provided}} by the Inland Feeder after nearly two years without a source. The water replenished much of what was lost after drought conditions required the MWD <b>to</b> <b>tap</b> <b>into</b> the lake.

5|$|The {{title was}} {{released}} in place of an aborted attempt to port the 2006 game Sonic the Hedgehog to the Wii. Producer Yojiro Ogawa conceived Secret Rings <b>to</b> <b>tap</b> <b>into</b> the Wii Remote's capabilities. He chose the theme of Arabian Nights, using many elements of the stories in the game's setting, characters, and Middle Eastern-influenced music. Sega changed {{the title of the}} game several times, originally being announced as Sonic Wild Fire, before settling on Sonic and the Secret Rings to tie in the theme of Arabian Nights.|$|E
5|$|Black and the FBI {{investigate}} the crime scene; Black not only realises the bomber's proficiency with explosives, but {{is able to}} work out that he viewed the bombing from the parking garage. In a bin in the garage, they find a tissue covered in Dees' semen. Black informs the FBI that the bomber is smart {{enough to be able}} <b>to</b> <b>tap</b> <b>into</b> their phonecalls, and volunteers to bait him into eavesdropping on his mobile phone. Black's deduction is correct, and as he attempts to stall Dees on the phone while the FBI trace the call, he realises from Dees' language that the bomber is seeking to become famous through his actions. Dees informs the FBI that he has planned another bombing for the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Media {{scholar and}} folklorist Andrew Peck {{attributes}} {{the success of}} the Slender Man to its highly collaborative nature. Because the character and its motives are shrouded in mystery, users can easily adapt existing Slender Man tropes and imagery to create new stories. This ability for users <b>to</b> <b>tap</b> <b>into</b> the ideas of others while also supplying their own helped inspire the collaborative culture that arose surrounding the Slender Man. Instead of privileging the choices of certain creators as canonical, this collaborative culture informally locates ownership of the creature across the community. In these respects, the Slender Man is similar to campfire stories or urban legends, and the character's success comes from enabling both social interaction and personal acts of creative expression.|$|E

50|$|Conversely, trees {{growing in}} close {{proximity}} to the sea almost universally yield much more fruit, as they are able <b>to</b> <b>tap</b> directly <b>into</b> the sea water which permeates the limestone in such areas. Not only do these trees produce a significantly higher yield, but also the fruit itself tends to be far more fertile due to the higher milk content. Trees found growing in Bermuda's marshy inland areas enjoy a similar degree of success, as they are also able <b>to</b> <b>tap</b> directly <b>into</b> a constant supply of water.|$|R

Vivec {{presents}} the player with the gauntlet 'Wraithguard', an ancient Dwemer artifact that allows the use of the tools Sunder and Keening.

5|$|The Simpson {{family are}} busy {{preparing}} for Bart's birthday party. Homer sees a commercial on television for a prank microphone called the Superstar Celebrity Microphone {{that can be}} used <b>to</b> <b>tap</b> <b>into</b> localized AM radio systems and instantly decides to buy one for Bart. Subsequently, Bart experiences a crushingly disappointing birthday party when all his gifts turn out to be useless things like a cactus, a label maker, and a new suit. At first, he is also disappointed by the microphone, but later finds a use for it in creating practical jokes, such as tricking Ned's boys Rod and Todd into believing that God is talking to them, listening in on Lisa and Janey's conversations about boys, and persuading Homer that Martians are invading the Earth.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} further enhance the appeal of its new {{flagship}} product, in 1993 the firm established a Communication Services division, designed <b>to</b> <b>tap</b> <b>into</b> the commercial market. The firm started making deals with major telecommunication companies, such as BellSouth and MCI Inc. {{in preparation for the}} services the firm was about to offer. In November of that year the division launched its Fax Broadcast service. The Fax Broadcast service allowed subscribers to upload a single fax and a recipient list to Delrina. Systems at Delrina would then send out the fax to the recipients on that list, to a maximum of 500 fax numbers. A subsequent Fax Mailbox feature—which enabled subscribers to remotely access both fax and voice messages from a single phone number—was initially held up following a dispute with AlphaNet Telecom for the rights to the technology. This dispute was resolved by June 1994, though with both sides publicly disputing the story of the other, and with AlphaNet receiving an undisclosed sum in compensation.|$|E
5000|$|In interviews, Liefeld has {{compared}} {{himself to}} other popular artists who experienced meteoric success and acclaim {{early in their}} careers but near-pariah status afterwards, such as LeBron James or Britney Spears, who [...] "became vapid in pop music, and perhaps I {{was nothing more than}} a vapid comic book artist." [...] He seems to credit his success <b>to</b> <b>tapping</b> <b>into</b> the zeitgeist: [...] "I'll be the first to tell you that we Image collective were never the best artists. We were never the best at anything, but just like a song or a band or whatever, we caught on and we toured rigorously." ...|$|R

40|$|The {{resurgence}} of audiovisual productions in Latin America during the 1990 s not only affected the cinematographic sphere, but TV production as well. The latest production of HBO Latin America {{to explore this}} genre is a Chilean series, called Prófugos (“Fugitives”), starring four popular local actors and directed by Pablo Larraín, from the acclaimed film Tony Manero (2008, Brasil/Chile). Prófugos shows that soap operas are definitely no longer the only Latin American fictional format, in addition <b>to</b> <b>tapping</b> <b>into</b> the global action genre tradition and marking the consolidation of a policy of intervention in the local market {{on the part of}} the major networks...|$|R
5|$|The {{cultural}} historian Jeremy Black {{points out}} that From Russia, with Love was written and published {{at a time when}} tensions between East and West were on the rise and public awareness of the Cold War was high. A joint British and American operation <b>to</b> <b>tap</b> <b>into</b> landline communication of the Soviet Army headquarters in Berlin using a tunnel into the Soviet-occupied zone had been publicly uncovered by the Soviets in April 1956. The same month the diver Lionel Crabb had gone missing on a mission to photograph the propeller of the Soviet cruiser Ordzhonikidze while the ship was moored in Portsmouth Harbour, an incident that was much reported and discussed in British newspapers. In October and November that year a popular uprising in Hungary was repressed by Soviet forces.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 16th century, England and the Netherlands {{began to}} {{challenge}} Portugal's monopoly of trade with Asia, forming private joint-stock companies to finance the voyages—the English, later British, East India Company and the Dutch East India Company, chartered in 1600 and 1602 respectively. The primary aim of these companies was <b>to</b> <b>tap</b> <b>into</b> the lucrative spice trade, an effort focused mainly on two regions; the East Indies archipelago, and an important hub in the trade network, India. There, they competed for trade supremacy with Portugal and with each other. Although England ultimately eclipsed the Netherlands as a colonial power, in the short term the Netherlands' more advanced financial system and the three Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th century left it with a stronger position in Asia. Hostilities ceased after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 when the Dutch William of Orange ascended the English throne, bringing peace between the Netherlands and England. A deal between the two nations left the spice trade of the East Indies archipelago to the Netherlands and the textiles industry of India to England, but textiles soon overtook spices in terms of profitability, and by 1720, in terms of sales, the British company had overtaken the Dutch.|$|E
