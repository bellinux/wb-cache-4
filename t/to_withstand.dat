5|$|Unlike semiaquatic temnospondyls, {{terrestrial}} temnospondyls have skulls {{that are}} adapted for biting land-living prey. The sutures between {{the bones of}} the skull in the dissorophoid Phonerpeton are able <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> a high degree of compression. Compressive forces would have been experienced when biting down on prey. Earlier aquatic tetrapods and tetrapod ancestors differ from temnospondyls like Phonerpeton in that their skulls were also built <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> tension. This tension would have been experienced during suction feeding underwater. Temnospondyls like Phonerpeton were among the first tetrapods that were almost exclusively terrestrial and fed by biting.|$|E

5|$|Approximately 1000 {{passengers}} {{were trapped in}} darkness for several hours inside two Eurostar trains {{on the night of}} 19/20 February 1996.

5|$|Arsenal faced Tottenham Hotspur in the semi-final and it {{was their}} local rivals who had {{taken the lead in}} the 14th minute.

5|$|Banksia serrata plants {{generally}} become fire tolerant by five {{to seven}} years of age in that they are able to resprout afterwards. Regrowth is generally from epicormic buds under their thick bark if the plant is between 2 and 6m (7-20ft) high or possibly from the woody subterranean base known as the lignotuber of younger and smaller plants. There is doubt as to whether recovery from a lignotuber is possible, although it has been demonstrated in other Banksia species such as B. menziesii. Stem size is a critical factor; stems with a DBH of under 1cm (0.4in) are unable <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> low intensity fires. A stem/trunk DBH of 2cm (0.8in) is needed to survive low intensity fires and of around 5cm (2in) <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> a high intensity fire.|$|E
5|$|Crucibles used {{to contain}} {{plutonium}} {{need to be}} able <b>to</b> <b>withstand</b> its strongly reducing properties. Refractory metals such as tantalum and tungsten along with the more stable oxides, borides, carbides, nitrides and silicides can tolerate this. Melting in an electric arc furnace can be used to produce small ingots of the metal without the need for a crucible.|$|E

In 1635, construction of the Floriana Lines commenced, enclosing Valletta's land front. The Floriana Lines were also modified until the 18th century.
