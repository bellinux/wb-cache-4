The degree to which B.serrata trees exhibit bradyspory seems <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> nature of the site where they grow. One study recorded plants at coastal sites having more than 30% of their follicles open, compared to those further inland having fewer than 5% open. Follicles also open when part of the tree dies.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} of research support for each recommendation varies; {{some of the}} more robustly researched and supported recommendations include the negative effects of noisy sleep environments, alcohol consumption in the hours before sleep, engaging in mentally difficult tasks before sleep, and trying too hard to fall asleep. There is a lack of evidence for the effects of certain sleep hygiene recommendations, including getting a more comfortable mattress, removing bedroom clocks, not worrying, and limiting liquids. Other recommendations, such as the effects of napping or exercise, have a more complicated evidence base. The effects of napping, for example, seem <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> length and timing of napping, in conjunction with how much cumulative sleep an individual has had in recent nights.|$|E

During the Cultural Revolution, the women’s movement {{was viewed as}} bourgeois and reactionary since it had originated in the West. The ACWF shutdown in 1968 because it was considered anti-revolutionary. The party argued that the women’s movement needed to be completely immersed in the revolutionary movement instead of harboring its own agenda. The offices of the ACWF were occupied by the army {{and many of the}} female cadres who had been involved with the women’s movement were sent to labor camps in the countryside. Women’s work ceased to function until the arrest of the Gang of Four in 1976.|$|E

5|$|There {{is no one}} way to do Archaeoastronomy. The {{divisions}} between archaeoastronomers tend not to be between the physical scientists and the social scientists. Instead it tends <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> location of kind of data available to the researcher. In the Old World, there is little data but the sites themselves; in the New World, the sites were supplemented by ethnographic and historic data. The effects of the isolated development of archaeoastronomy in different places can still often be seen in research today. Research methods can be classified as falling into one of two approaches, though more recent projects often use techniques from both categories.|$|E

25|$|Classical economics, {{developed}} in the 18th and 19th centuries, included a value theory and distribution theory. The value of a product was thought <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> costs involved in producing that product. The explanation of costs in Classical economics was simultaneously an explanation of distribution. A landlord received rent, workers received wages, and a capitalist tenant farmer received profits on their investment. This classic approach included the work of Adam Smith and David Ricardo.|$|E

25|$|For a solid that dissolves in a redox reaction, {{solubility}} {{is expected}} <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> potential (within {{the range of}} potentials under which the solid remains the thermodynamically stable phase). For example, solubility of gold in high-temperature water is observed to be almost {{an order of magnitude}} higher (i.e. about ten times higher) when the redox potential is controlled using a highly oxidizing Fe3O4-Fe2O3 redox buffer than with a moderately oxidizing Ni-NiO buffer.|$|E
25|$|It {{is worth}} noting that the spinor Lie {{derivative}} is independent of the metric, and hence also of the connection. This is not obvious from the right-hand side of Kosmann's local expression, as the right-hand side seems <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> metric through the spin connection (covariant derivative), the dualisation of vector fields (lowering of the indices) and the Clifford multiplication on the spinor bundle. Such is not the case: the quantities on the right-hand side of Kosmann's local expression combine so as to make all metric and connection dependent terms cancel.|$|E
25|$|Religious {{education}} was also strictly reviewed. At first, she simply attempted to revise clerical studies, proposing a reform of religious schools. This reform never progressed beyond the planning stages. By 1786, Catherine excluded all religion and clerical studies programmes from lay education. By separating the public interests {{from those of}} the church, Catherine began a secularisation of the day-to-day workings of Russia. She transformed the clergy from a group that wielded great power over the Russian government and its people to a segregated community forced <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> state for compensation.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{evidence}} that SAT scores systematically underestimate future performance of minority students. However, the predictive validity of the SAT has been shown <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> dominant ethnic and racial composition of the college. Some studies have also shown that African American students under-perform in college relative to their white peers with the same SAT scores; researchers have argued that this is likely because white students tend to benefit from social advantages outside of the educational environment (for example, high parental involvement in their education, inclusion in campus academic activities, positive bias from same-race teachers and peers) which result in better grades.|$|E
25|$|The fur trade {{became one}} of the main {{economic}} ventures in North America attracting competition among the French, British, Dutch, Spanish, and Russians. Indeed, in the early history of the United States, capitalizing on this trade, and removing the British stranglehold over it, was seen as a major economic objective. Many Native American societies across the continent came <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fur trade as their primary source of income. By the mid-1800s, however, changing fashions in Europe brought about a collapse in fur prices. The American Fur Company and some other companies failed. Many Native communities were plunged into long-term poverty and consequently lost much of the political influence they once had.|$|E
25|$|Women in Nigeria {{have had}} various {{challenges}} {{in order to}} obtain equal education in all forms of formal education in Nigeria. Education is a basic human right and has been recognized as such since the 1948 adoption of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. A positive correlation exists between the enrollment of girls in primary school and the gross national product and increase of life expectancy. Because of this correlation, enrollment in schools represents the largest component of the investment in human capital in any society. Rapid socio-economic development of a nation has been observed <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> calibre of women and their education in that country. Education bestows on women a disposition for a lifelong acquisition of knowledge, values, attitudes, competence and skills.|$|E

25|$|Unlike many {{viruses that}} enter the cell through endocytosis, polyomaviruses {{penetrate}} the cell membrane {{and enter the}} cytosol from the late endoplasmic reticulum rather than from endosomes, although conformational changes in response to low pH in endolysosomes have been hypothesized as critical steps in the process. MPyV membrane exit is believed <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> presence of specific host proteins located in the late ER; for example, the host protein ERp29, {{a member of the}} protein disulfide isomerase family, has been shown to disrupt the conformation of VP1. It is not known whether entry into the cytosol is obligatory for MPyV infection or whether the particle could enter the cell nucleus directly from the ER. Even a single viral particle entering the nucleus can be sufficient for infection.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of the Lake Street Elevated led to a political quarrel in west suburban Cicero, Illinois, {{which at the time}} included Oak Park and Austin. In 1898, Austinites, having a majority on Cicero's town council, used political influence to allow the extension of the Lake Street line from the city border at Laramie Avenue (then called 52nd Avenue) into their community. This infuriated other Cicero residents, who retaliated the following year by holding a joint election to force Austin's annexation to the City of Chicago. Much to the dismay of local residents, this effort succeeded, and Austin became part of Chicago in 1899. A century later, Oak Park commuters, who had come <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> service, were among the most vocal critics of the Green Line's closure for rehabilitation.|$|E
25|$|Typical MRI studies scan a few {{different}} subjects. To {{integrate the}} results across subjects, one possibility {{is to use a}} common brain atlas, and adjust all the brains to align to the atlas, and then analyze them as a single group. The atlases commonly used are the Talairach one, a single brain of an elderly woman created by Jean Talairach, and the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) one. The second is a probabilistic map created by combining scans from over a hundred individuals. This normalization to a standard template is done by mathematically checking which combination of stretching, squeezing, and warping reduces the differences between the target and the reference. While this is conceptually similar to motion correction, the changes required are more complex than just translation and rotation, and hence optimization even more likely <b>to</b> <b>depend</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> first transformations in the chain that is checked.|$|E
