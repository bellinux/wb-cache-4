5|$|A key {{strategy}} was {{the establishment of}} colonial towns across the territories that underwent the process of conquest and colonisation; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> project Spanish power over the surrounding countryside. The Spanish were particularly horrified by the Mesoamerican religious practice of human sacrifice, prompting them to attempt to eradicate the native religion.|$|E
5|$|After the Munich Agreement, two tank battalions {{were sent}} to {{reinforce}} the 3rd Mobile Division in Slovakia. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> repel Hungarian and Polish border-crossers, sometimes up to a battalion in strength. They screened the infantry {{when they had to}} evacuate southern Slovakia after the First Vienna Award on 2 November 1938.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd Infantry Division {{then moved}} to the offensive, in early May 1951 <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> scout for Chinese {{concentrations}} and then call in artillery to destroy them. These actions have been viewed by historians as one of few instances where Rangers in Korea were effectively employed, used as a stealthy infiltration force for terrain too difficult for conventional units.|$|E

50|$|Free abelian {{groups have}} {{properties}} which make them similar to vector spaces. They have applications in algebraic topology, where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> define chain groups, and in algebraic geometry, where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> define divisors. Integer lattices also form examples of free abelian groups, and lattice theory studies free abelian subgroups of real vector spaces.|$|R

5|$|The Song {{people used}} the {{turntable}} trebuchet, the single-pole trebuchet and the squatting-tiger trebuchet. They were all called 'fire trebuchets' because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> project fire-weapons like the (fire-)ball, (fire-)falcon, and (fire-)lance. They were {{the ancestors of}} the cannon.|$|E
5|$|Toward {{the end of}} June, the ZNDH {{received}} the first of 22 Bücker Bü 181 Bestmann aircraft. The 19th and 20th Transport Squadrons received five each, with the remainder issued to the 1st Pilot School. Besides liaison duties, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> transport fresh meat from Bosnia to Zagreb, {{where there was a}} food shortage.|$|E
5|$|Australian {{special forces}} played a {{significant}} role in the Pacific War. Following the outbreak of war commando companies were deployed to Timor, the Solomon and Bismarck islands and New Caledonia. Although the 1st Independent Company was swiftly overwhelmed when the Japanese invaded the Solomon Islands in early 1942, the 2/2nd and 2/4th Independent Companies waged a successful guerrilla campaign on Timor which lasted from February 1942 to February 1943 when the Australian force was evacuated. Other commando units also played an important role in the New Guinea, New Britain, Bougainville and Borneo campaigns throughout the war where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> collect intelligence, spearhead offensives and secure the flanks of operations conducted by conventional infantry.|$|E

5|$|During the American {{participation}} in World War I, the Connecticut-class ships {{were used to}} train sailors for an expanding wartime fleet. In late 1918, they began to escort convoys to Europe, and in September that year, Minnesota was badly damaged by a mine laid by a German U-boat. After the war, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> bring American soldiers back from France and later as training ships. The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, which mandated major reductions in naval weapons, cut the ships' careers short. Within two years, all six ships had been sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|During the American {{participation}} in World War I, the Virginia-class ships {{were used to}} train sailors for an expanding wartime fleet. In September 1918, they began to escort convoys to Europe, though Germany surrendered two months later, ending the conflict. After the war, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> bring American soldiers back from France and later as training ships. The 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, which mandated major reductions in naval weapons, cut the ships' careers short. Virginia and New Jersey were sunk in bombing tests in 1923, {{and the other three}} ships were broken up for scrap later that year.|$|E
5|$|In 1163 Henry {{returned}} to England, intent on reforming {{the role of}} the royal courts. He cracked down on crime, seizing the belongings of thieves and fugitives, and travelling justices were dispatched to the north and the Midlands. After 1166, Henry's exchequer court in Westminster, which had previously only heard cases connected with royal revenues, began to take wider civil cases on behalf of the king. The reforms continued and Henry created the General Eyre, probably in 1176, which involved dispatching a group of royal justices to visit all the counties in England over a given period of time, with authority to cover both civil and criminal cases. Local juries were used occasionally in previous reigns, but Henry made much wider use of them. Juries were introduced in petty assizes from around 1176, where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> establish the answers to particular pre-established questions, and in grand assizes from 1179, where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> determine the guilt of a defendant. Other methods of trial continued, however, including trial by combat and trial by ordeal. After the Assize of Clarendon in 1166, royal justice was extended into new areas through the use of new forms of assizes, in particular novel disseisin, mort d'ancestor and dower unde nichil habet, which dealt with the wrongful dispossession of land, inheritance rights and the rights of widows respectively. In making these reforms Henry both challenged the traditional rights of barons in dispensing justice and reinforced key feudal principles, but over time they greatly increased royal power in England.|$|E

30|$|The Internet of Things {{is being}} {{applied to the}} natural {{environment}} to defend the Earth’s ecosystems more efficiently. Sensors are being installed across cities, suburbs and in rural communities to measure pollution levels and warn the public about toxic conditions, to minimise public exposure and protect public health; in the soil, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> detect subtle changes in vibrations and earth density, to inform scientists {{about the risk of}} avalanches, volcanic eruptions and earthquakes; in rivers, lakes, and oceans, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> report changes in the quality of water, and in wild animals and along migratory trails, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> evaluate environmental and behavioural changes (Del Giudice et al. 2013).|$|R

5|$|In March–April 1918, Battleship Division Nine escorted the Scandinavian Convoy {{two more}} times. Both {{missions}} were hampered by storms {{that made the}} going particularly slow, but were otherwise uneventful. Still, confidence in the wisdom of using battleships as an escort was fading at the Admiralty, and Admiral Beatty in particular was opposed to it. When the American ships returned to the new Grand Fleet base at Rosyth {{at the end of}} the second mission on 20 April, it was the last time <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> escort the Scandinavian Convoy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Percherons {{also began to}} be {{exported}} from the United States to Great Britain, where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> pull horse-drawn buses in large cities. The first Percherons imported to Britain included some {{of the thousands of}} crossbreds from the United States. In Britain, many of the horses, once they finished their bus-pulling career, were sold to farmers. Other imported horses were sold to the British Army, and in 1900, 325 horses were shipped to South Africa for use in the Boer War.|$|E
5|$|The first {{ships were}} {{designed}} {{around the time}} of the Vietnam War, and certain aspects of the design were influenced by operations there. To a certain extent, the carrier operations in Vietnam demonstrated the need for increased capabilities of aircraft carriers over their survivability, as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> send sorties into the war and were therefore less subject to attack. As a result of this experience, Nimitz carriers were designed with larger stores of aviation fuel and larger magazines in relation to previous carriers, although this was partly as a result of increased space available by the new design of the ships' propulsion systems.|$|E

5|$|The {{waterwheel}} {{appeared in}} Chinese records during the Han. As mentioned by Huan Tan in about 20 AD, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> turn gears that lifted iron trip hammers, and {{were used in}} pounding, threshing and polishing grain. However, there is no sufficient evidence for the watermill in China until about the 5th century. The Nanyang Commandery Administrator and mechanical engineer Du Shi (d.38 AD) created a waterwheel-powered reciprocator that worked the bellows for the smelting of iron. Waterwheels were also used to power chain pumps that lifted water to raised irrigation ditches. The chain pump was first mentioned in China by the philosopher Wang Chong in his 1st-century-AD Balanced Discourse.|$|E
5|$|Venus transits are {{historically}} {{of great}} scientific importance as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> gain the first realistic {{estimates of the}} size of the Solar System. Observations of the 1639 transit, combined with the principle of parallax, provided an estimate of the distance between the Sun and the Earth that was more accurate than any other up to that time. The 2012 transit provided scientists with a number of other research opportunities, particularly in the refinement of techniques to be used in the search for exoplanets.|$|E
5|$|Welsh Black cattle are the {{traditional}} breed of Wales. These hardy cows with horns and shaggy coats {{are able to}} thrive on poor quality pasture and moorland {{and can be used}} to provide both milk and beef. Large numbers were raised in Wales and herded on foot to be fattened in England for selling in English markets. On Welsh farms <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> pull ploughs and sometimes wagons during the nineteenth century, and were the prized possessions by which a man's wealth could be estimated. Nowadays, many have been crossed with Charolais, Limousin or Hereford bulls but pure bred herds can still be found {{in many parts of the}} uplands.|$|E
50|$|A gastroprokinetic agent, gastrokinetic, or prokinetic, {{is a type}} of drug which enhances {{gastrointestinal}} motility {{by increasing}} the frequency of contractions in the small intestine or making them stronger, but without disrupting their rhythm. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> relieve gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, bloating, constipation, heart burn, nausea, and vomiting. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> treat a number of gastrointestinal disorders, including irritable bowel syndrome, gastritis, acid reflux disease, gastroparesis, and functional dyspepsia.|$|R

5|$|Barr {{died before}} AAA {{had a chance}} to move on with the storyline after When Worlds Collide. Barr's death was {{followed}} shortly afterwards by the Mexican peso crisis, which meant most of the US-based wrestlers were able to earn only a fraction of what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> while working for AAA. The peso crisis led to Eddie Guerrero working for the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania-based Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) instead. At the time of Barr's death, both wrestlers were in negotiations to work for ECW part-time, which became full-time in 1995. Guerrero would later end up working full-time for World Championship Wrestling, which had produced When Worlds Collide. After Barr's death, AAA retired the AAA World Tag Team Championship in Barr's honor. With Barr dying and Guerrero leaving, Los Gringos Locos was abandoned as well.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the war, the 12th Light Horse Regiment {{remained}} in the Middle East for a number of months, during which time, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Phillip Chambers, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> suppress the 1919 Egyptian Uprising. During the uprising, the 12th carried out security operations to protect infrastructure in the Ismailia area. As the situation was resolved, the regiment handed back its stores and equipment in preparation for repatriation back to Australia and most of their horses were transferred to the Australian Remount Depot at Moascar. Due to concerns about costs, availability of shipping and quarantine restrictions, the decision was made that the horses would not be returned to Australia, but that they would be sold to the British Indian Army for further service, or to local Egyptians. According to Hollis, though, many were also put down by the troopers due to concerns they might be mistreated.|$|E
5|$|For the show, Minogue {{collaborated with}} {{creative}} director William Baker and art director Alan MacDonald. Baker and MacDonald had previously {{worked with the}} singer on her KylieFever2002 tour. The musical arrangements were handled by Steve Anderson, while the dance routines were choreographed by Michael Rooney. Display hardware manufacturer Barco was hired to provide 100 square metres large LED displays, which were {{set up on the}} stage behind Minogue. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> show animations and high resolution graphics. Minogue wore five different costumes during the 75-minute-long show. Fashion houses like Balenciaga, Chanel, and Helmut Lang designed these costumes. Minogue was backed by 12 dancers and a full-piece band. The seating capacity of the show was restricted to 4000 spectators and the entire staging of the show cost £1 million.|$|E
