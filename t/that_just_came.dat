500|$|In September 2009, Janet Jackson {{performed}} [...] "Scream" [...] on the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards {{as part of}} {{a medley}} tribute to Michael Jackson, who died three months earlier. MTV General Manager Stephen Friedman stated [...] "his is not something <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>came</b> together—we've been in talks with [...] for a while... We felt there was no one better than Janet to anchor it and send a really powerful message." [...] She worked with several world-renowned choreographers, including Dave Scott, Cris Judd, Brian Friedman, Wade Robson, Tyce Diorio, Travis Payne, Jeri Slaughter, Laurie Ann Gibson, Mia Michaels and Tina Landon, with her personal creative director, Gil Duldulao, coordinating the performance. Gil Kaufman of MTV commented [...] "earing a black-and-white, skintight leather dress with matching pants, Janet busted some of her and Michael's signature moves, flawlessly re-creating her late brother's steps as they were projected on the screen behind her." [...] Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly commented, [...] "she worked that stage harder than an underpaid assistant doin’ overtime, and as tributes go, this was as energetic as it was heartfelt." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 2010, when Jill's adoptive mother, Liz Foster (Julianna McCarthy), died, it {{was then}} learned that her {{biological}} father was Neil Fenmore. Walton stated: [...] "Liz was the dream mother for Jill. She always could handle Jill." [...] During an interview with On-Air On-Soaps speaking about how her character has been thrown in different directions, Walton said: [...] "It used to bother me. I would try and keep a steady course with it, and now I can’t. Now I just roll with the punches. It’s impossible." [...] Walton noted that Jill was finally {{happy to have a}} blood relative through Neil's other daughter, Lauren Fenmore (Tracey E. Bregman). She said: [...] "Liz dies within a week {{and all of a sudden}} it’s, 'I am a Fenmore'. And we really didn’t have a chance to explore it much, but in real life that happens. My first thought as Jill is, 'I actually know who my blood is, and I have a sister.' And, Jill was very moved and touched and shocked from the death of Liz, but full of love for her sister." [...] On her relationship with Lauren, Walton stated that, [...] "Most people don’t like Jill, and she hasn’t particularly loved Lauren. I have never had that much to do with Lauren, really." [...] Nekeeta Borden of Zap2it noted: [...] "The redhead told Jill in no uncertain terms that she intended to keep her father’s memory, and only child status, firmly in tact [...] and had no interest in a close relationship." [...] Borden also noted that Jill always wanted a sense of belonging, which prompted her to legally change her name to Jill Fenmore. The sisters were initially bitter towards each other having to share half of the Fenmore Boutique, but have since gotten closer. Walton said that, [...] "From my point of view, I think that Lauren has a really big heart; she's a naturally lovely person. Lauren was really awful a few times, and <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>came</b> out of her pain. So, it looks like Lauren and Jill are kind of getting along okay, but there's nothing else coming up in the scripts for them yet." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 5. I dined to-day with {{my friend}} Lewis, and we were deep in {{politics}} how to save the present Ministry; for I am afraid of Mr. Secretary, as I believe I told you. I went in the evening to see Mr. Harley; and, upon my word, I was in perfect joy. Mr. Secretary was just going out of the door; but I made him come back, {{and there was the}} old Saturday Club, Lord Keeper, Lord Rivers, Mr. Secretary, Mr. Harley, and I; the first time since his stabbing. Mr. Secretary went away; but I stayed till nine, and made Mr. Harley show me his breast, and tell all the story; and I showed him the Archbishop of Dublin's letter, and defended him effectually. We were all in mighty good humour. Lord Keeper and I left them together, and I walked here after nine two miles, and I found a parson drunk fighting with a seaman, and Patrick and I were so wise to part them, but the seaman followed him to Chelsea, cursing at him, and the parson slipped into a house, and I know no more. It mortified me to see a man in my coat so overtaken. A pretty scene for one <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>came</b> from sitting with the Prime Ministers! I had no money in my pocket, and so could not be robbed. However, nothing but Mr. Harley shall make me take such a journey again. We don't yet know who will be President in Lord Rochester's room. I measured, and found that the penknife would have killed Mr. Harley if it had gone but half the breadth of my thumb-nail lower, so near was he to death. I was so curious as to ask him what were his thoughts while they were carrying him home in the chair. He said he concluded himself a dead man. He will not allow that Guiscard gave him the second stab; though my Lord Keeper, who is blind, and I that was not there, are positive in it. He wears a plaster still as broad as half a crown. Smoke how wide the lines are, but, faith, I don't do it on purpose: but I have changed my side in this new Chelsea bed, and I do not know how, methinks, but it is so unfit, and so awkward, never saw the like.|$|E

I started the idea and West was like, 'That's hot.' ... So I brought that music and he brought his editorial to it and then wrote the melody, and said we're gonna get Jeezy on it. We were searching for sort of a tribal-ish drum sounds and <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>came</b> out. It's a very simple and dark sounding piano figure.|$|E

5000|$|I {{went to see}} {{the movie}} Doctor Zhivago the night I wrote it. Everyone's made a whole lot out of that.

He determined that venom of winter snakes had relatively low potency, venom of snakes <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>came</b> out of theirs holes had high potency, venom of snakes during the season of spring had higher potency, and venom of pregnant snakes had the highest potency. By utilizing his theory, he was able to apply the right type and amount of medicine to cure his patients. At this time, the name of Ji Desheng and his medicine began to spread.|$|E

50|$|The fully {{developed}} S. phrynosoma lives inside the stomach of P. platyrhinos and mating occurs there as well. Once filled with mature eggs, the female {{travels to the}} lizard's cloaca (butt). Another unique aspect {{of the life cycle}} of S. phrynosoma {{is that it does not}} just lay eggs that are cast out of the lizard and left alone exposed to other elements. S. phrynosoma cares so much about their offspring that the female devotes herself for the safety of the eggs by casting her body filled with eggs out of the lizard through its feces. Once outside the host, the female worm dies with the eggs inside her. This also helps her eggs reach the next host - the ant. The ant finds the dead body filled with eggs and use it to feed its brood of growing larvae. Then the larvae of S. phrynosoma infects the ant larvae, which results in pre-infected worker ant upon maturation. Then the pre-infected worker ants emerge from the colony and are consumed by P. platyrhinos <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>came</b> of hibernation.|$|E
