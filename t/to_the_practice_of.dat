5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> cursing and sorcery {{peculiar}} to Sinhala Buddhists, Kataragama deviyo has his dark side represented by Getabaru and Kadavara. The current Getabaru shrine {{is located in}} an isolated place near Morawaka. The shrine for Kadavara is {{in the town of}} Kataragama.

Despite his eventual opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> sword fighting for sport, his work during this period laid the foundations for the modern sport of kendo. In his later years he taught a number of noted martial artists, and was honoured by the All Japan Kendo Federation after his death.|$|E

5|$|Burnett's {{actions were}} deemed treasonable by {{his colleagues in}} Congress, and he was {{expelled}} from the House in 1861.

5|$|During {{the late}} colonial period, {{under the rule}} of the House of Bourbon, the ideas of the Enlightenment on public health and social control shaped the {{development}} of Lima. New buildings undertaken during this period include a cockfighting coliseum and a bullring, the Plaza de toros de Acho, as well as the General Cemetery. The first two were built to regulate these popular activities by centralizing them at a single venue, while the cemetery put an end <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> burials at churches which was considered unhealthy by public authorities.|$|E

Monroe retired to his farm on the Little Cacapon River and died in 1905.|$|E
50|$|A strong {{organizational}} culture {{can also be}} extremely influential in mitigating the risk of negative behavior.

5|$|Stichometry refers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> {{counting}} {{lines in}} texts: Ancient Greeks and Romans measured {{the length of}} their books in lines, just as modern books are measured in pages.

Stichos is the Greek word for a 'line' of prose or poetry and the suffix '-metry' {{is derived from the}} Greek word for measurement.|$|E

5|$|The 1885 herd book {{describes}} {{two distinct}} types of Highland cattle. One was the West Highland, or Kyloe, originating and living {{mostly on the}} Western Islands, which had harsher conditions. These cattle tended to be smaller, to have black coats and, due to their more rugged environment, to have long hair. These cattle were named due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> relocating them. The kyles were narrow straits of water the cattle were driven across to get to market.|$|E
5|$|The Jé and Mé {{colleges were}} {{established}} to train monks, over a 20-year programme of tsennyi mtshan nyid grwa tshang (philosophical knowledge), which {{concludes with a}} geshe degree.

He also worked to secure Portland’s economic future by promoting the construction of the railroad line to California to link with the transcontinental rail line. From 1870 to 1876 he started three companies with the goal of creating a railroad connecting Portland to the Union Pacific’s transcontinental railroad. Chapman’s proposed line would have traveled through the Columbia River Gorge to The Dalles, Oregon, where it would then travel southeast to Salt Lake City, Utah, linking to the Union Pacific line.|$|E
5|$|With {{the release}} of the fourth edition, Wizards of the Coast {{introduced}} its Game System License, which represented a significant restriction compared to the very open policies embodied by the OGL. In part as a response to this, some publishers (such as Paizo Publishing with its Pathfinder Roleplaying Game) who previously produced materials in support of the D product line, decided to continue supporting the 3rd Edition rules, thereby competing directly with Wizards of the Coast. Others, such as Kenzer & Company, are returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> publishing unlicensed supplements and arguing that copyright law does not allow Wizards of the Coast to restrict third-party usage.|$|E
5|$|As the 1876 presidential {{election}} approached, Garfield was {{loyal to the}} candidacy of Senator Blaine, and fought for the former Speaker's nomination at the 1876 Republican National Convention in Cincinnati. When it became clear, after six ballots, that Blaine could not prevail, the convention nominated Ohio Governor Rutherford B. Hayes. Although Garfield had supported Blaine, he had kept good relations with Hayes, and wholeheartedly supported the governor. Garfield had hoped to retire from politics after his term expired to devote himself full-time <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> law, but to help his party, he sought re-election, and won it easily that October. Any celebration was short lived, as Garfield's youngest son, Neddie, fell ill with whooping cough shortly after the congressional election, and soon died.|$|E

5|$|Before Æthelberht's {{death in}} 616 {{a number of}} other bishoprics had been {{established}} but after that date, a pagan backlash set in and the see, or bishopric, of London was abandoned. Æthelberht's daughter, Æthelburg, married Edwin, the king of the Northumbrians, and by 627 Paulinus, the bishop who accompanied her north, had converted Edwin and {{a number of other}} Northumbrians. When Edwin died, in about 633, his widow and Paulinus were forced to flee to Kent. Although the missionaries could not remain in all of the places they had evangelised, by the time the last of them died in 653, they had established Christianity in Kent and the surrounding countryside and contributed a Roman tradition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> Christianity in Britain.|$|E
5|$|In 1795, he {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> law in New York. He {{tried to control}} the policies of President Adams (1797–1801). In 1798–99, Hamilton called for mobilization against France after the XYZ Affair and became commander of a new army, which he readied for war. However, the Quasi-War was never officially declared and did not involve army action, though it was hard-fought at sea. In the end, President Adams found a diplomatic solution that avoided a war with France. Hamilton's opposition to Adams' re-election helped cause his defeat in the 1800 election. Jefferson and Aaron Burr tied for the presidency {{in the electoral college}} in 1801, and Hamilton helped to defeat Burr, whom he found unprincipled, and to elect Jefferson despite philosophical differences.|$|E
5|$|Ion Creangă {{was born}} in Humulești in the Principality of Moldavia, a former village which has since been {{incorporated}} into Târgu Neamț city, the son of Orthodox trader Ștefan sin Petre Ciubotariul and his wife Smaranda. His native area, bordering on heavily forested areas, was in the Eastern Carpathian foothills, and included into {{what was then the}} principality of Moldavia. The surrounding region's population preserved an archaic way of life, dominated by shepherding, textile manufacturing and related occupations, and noted for preserving the older forms of local folklore. Another characteristic of the area, which left an impression on Creangă's family history, was related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> transhumance and the links between ethnic Romanian communities {{on both sides of the}} mountains, in Moldavia and Transylvania: on his maternal side, the writer descended from Maramureș-born peasants, while, according to literary historian George Călinescu, his father's origin may have been further southwest, in Transylvania-proper.|$|E
