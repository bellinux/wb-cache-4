Downey also housed Destro's MARS base in the Arctic, his legitimate weapons factory in an ex-Soviet state, as well as filming various submarines' interiors, including a SHARC (Submersible High-speed Attack and Reconnaissance Craft) manned by two G.I. Joes.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, the station's twin towers, {{which had}} been Grade II listed in 1972, were {{restored}} in a project costing £242,000 (now £). The works revealed that the east tower still contained a large water tank which was used during the days of steam traction to replenish locomotives and to power the station's hydraulic systems. The brickwork was repaired, cleaned and repointed, and the weather vanes gilded <b>to</b> <b>complement</b> <b>the</b> dome of nearby St Paul's Cathedral.

5|$|The Museum of Contemporary Art (MCA) Chicago {{was created}} {{as the result}} of a 1964 meeting of 30 critics, {{collectors}} and dealers at the home of critic Doris Lane Butler to bring the long-discussed idea of a museum of contemporary art <b>to</b> <b>complement</b> <b>the</b> city's Art Institute of Chicago, according to a grand opening story in Time. It opened in fall 1967 in a small space at 237 East Ontario Street that had for a time served as the corporate offices of Playboy Enterprises. Its first director was Jan van der Marck. In 1970 he invited Wolf Vostell to make the Concrete Traffic sculpture in Chicago.|$|E

5|$|The South Pavilions were {{designed}} by architect Renzo Piano of Renzo Piano Building Workshop. Piano designed the Art Institute of Chicago's Modern Wing, which is across Monroe Street from the South Pavilions and opened in 2009. The facades of the South Pavilions are limestone and glass in order <b>to</b> <b>complement</b> <b>the</b> Modern Wing, {{even though it was}} not completed until several years after the pavilions were finished. Piano also designed the Nichols Bridgeway, which connects Millennium Park and the Art Institute, and is next to the Southwest Pavilion.|$|E
5|$|The choir is {{entered through}} a screen {{designed}} by George Gilbert Scott, with gates made by Skidmore. The rood {{was designed by}} Scott, and was made by F.Stuflesser. The bishop’s throne or “cathedra” was designed by Scott <b>to</b> <b>complement</b> <b>the</b> choir stalls. It was constructed by Farmer and Brindley in 1876. The reredos and the floor mosaic date from 1876, and were designed by J.R.Clayton. The east window has tracery of an elegant Decorated Gothic design which is filled with stained glass of 1884 by Heaton, Butler and Bayne.|$|E
5|$|The main {{use for the}} agung in Maguindanao and Maranao {{society is}} as a supportive/accompanying {{instrument}} of an orthodox kulintang ensemble. Using basic patterns and interlocking rhythms, a player would use the agung <b>to</b> <b>complement</b> <b>the</b> melody played by the kulintang. The patterns players use are normally considered freer than either the babendil or the dabakan; players could manipulate the patterns freely {{as long as they}} conform, reaffirm, reinforce and even generate the rhythmic mode of the piece. The length of the patterns themselves may vary depending on how they fit into the melodic improvisation. Rapid style is useful especially during exhibition of playing skills.|$|E

5|$|<b>To</b> <b>complement</b> <b>the</b> garden, a bath {{house and}} summer house were {{constructed}} {{at the corners}} of the garden furthest from the castle. The bath house is ruined, but the two-storey summer house survives intact. It comprises a groin-vaulted lower room, with an upper chamber, containing the only surviving example of the castle’s carved-oak wall panelling. Charles McKean attributes the design and construction of the garden buildings to Thomas Leiper, an Aberdeenshire stonemason, based on the elaborately decorated gun holes in the summer house.|$|E
5|$|As {{the city}} water supply from Aldershawe was {{diminishing}} {{in the early}} 19th century, money was spent diverting surface waters from 'Swan Moggs' into a common conduit. The two streams across it were diverted into underground culverts; the land was raised with silt and mud dredged from Minster Pool. The area was subsequently developed into the formal gardens of Beacon Park by the Lichfield Corporation, but {{paid for by the}} Conduit Lands Trust. The Museum Gardens were opened in 1859 <b>to</b> <b>complement</b> <b>the</b> new Italianate Free Library and Museum. The Recreation Grounds, opened in 1891, is the small area between the Museum Gardens and the wider Beacon Park. The central fountain was unveiled as the central focus of the Museum Gardens in 1871. A bandstand was also installed close to the junction of the Museum Gardens and Recreation Grounds, and was positioned to provide a focus for the avenue through the Museum Gardens.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, Istanbul had {{established}} itself as a regional artistic center, with Turkish, European, and Middle Eastern artists flocking to the city. Despite efforts to make Ankara Turkey's cultural heart, Istanbul had the country's primary institution of art until the 1970s. When additional universities and art journals were founded in Istanbul during the 1980s, artists formerly based in Ankara moved in. Beyoğlu has been transformed into the artistic center of the city, with young artists and older Turkish artists formerly residing abroad finding footing there. Modern art museums, including İstanbul Modern, the Pera Museum, Sakıp Sabancı Museum and SantralIstanbul, opened in the 2000s <b>to</b> <b>complement</b> <b>the</b> exhibition spaces and auction houses that have already contributed to the cosmopolitan nature of the city. These museums have yet to attain the popularity of older museums on the historic peninsula, including the Istanbul Archaeology Museums, which ushered in the era of modern museums in Turkey, and the Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum.|$|E

5|$|Early {{work was}} {{promising}} {{and by the}} fall of 1976 the project was building momentum. Fans organized a mail campaign that flooded the White House with 400,000 letters, influencing President Gerald Ford to rechristen the Space Shuttle Constitution to Enterprise. Bryant and Scott's proposal became the first accepted by the studio in October; Roddenberry immediately stopped work on other projects to refocus on Star Trek, and the screenwriters and producers were swamped with grateful fan mail. By the start of 1977 the project's official title was changed to Star Trek—The Motion Picture (a title reapplied to the eventually released 1979 film). The elation was short-lived; the first draft of the completed script was not finished until March 1, 1977, and pressure was mounting for Paramount to either begin production or cut its losses and cancel the project. Producer Jerry Isenberg began scouting filming locations and hired designers and illustrators <b>to</b> <b>complement</b> <b>the</b> script.|$|E

The original plans called for the building to be constructed out of red brick, but the final execution was mostly in sandstone quarried in Connecticut, with some examples of stone from Newark. Geology Hall, built {{on the south side}} of Old Queens, was the second of three projects that Hardenberg designed for the college, following an addition to a building (now Alexander Johnston Hall) that housed the college's grammar school (now Rutgers Preparatory School) the year before. The third project, Kirkpatrick Chapel (1873), was designed <b>to</b> <b>complement</b> <b>the</b> simple Gothic Revival style of Geology Hall and was erected on the north side of Old Queens.|$|E
