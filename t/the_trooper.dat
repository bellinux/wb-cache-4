The vehicle was chased by three patrol {{cars and the}} booths down the turnpike were alerted. Acoli then exited the car and, after being ordered to halt by a trooper, fled into the woods as <b>the</b> <b>trooper</b> emptied his gun. Assata Shakur then walked towards <b>the</b> <b>trooper</b> with her bloodied arms raised in surrender.

5|$|On December 12, 2004, Route 83 was {{dedicated}} as <b>the</b> <b>Trooper</b> Bertram T. Zimmerman III Memorial Highway {{in honor of}} a New Jersey State Police trooper who was killed on the route {{earlier in the year}} while responding to an armed robbery. In the 2000s, plans were made to improve the intersections at both termini of Route 83. The intersection with Route 47 saw realignment and the installation of a traffic light, along with improvements to Route 47, that cost $6.7 million and was completed in July 2007. In 2006, reconstruction of the Yintersection of US 9 and Route 83 to a T intersection and a new traffic light was planned following a school bus accident. The reconfigured intersection was completed on June 10, 2008.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the Scarpetta novels, Cornwell has written three pseudo-police fictions, known as <b>the</b> <b>Trooper</b> Andy Brazil/Superintendent Judy Hammer series, which are set in North Carolina, Virginia, and off the mid-Atlantic coast.

50|$|After Bill Clinton was elected, Brock was {{assigned}} to write a story, later dubbed Troopergate, about four Arkansas state troopers who held a grudge against Bill Clinton.

He later discovered he was deceived and that <b>the</b> <b>troopers</b> had been paid by Richard Mellon Scaife, who bankrolled The American Spectator and the Arkansas Project, a secret project to discredit Clinton.|$|R
50|$|As they roamed their beat {{in their}} yellow and blue striped jeep, {{each pair of}} Constabulary troopers was usually {{accompanied}} by a German policeman who rode in the back seat. The German policeman knew some English and <b>the</b> <b>troopers</b> were trained at the Constabulary school to understand a number of German phrases useful in police work. If the patrol investigated a disturbance in a German home, <b>the</b> <b>troopers</b> stood by while the German officer made the arrest. If they apprehended suspected displaced persons outside their camp, <b>the</b> <b>troopers</b> again stood by while the German policeman handled the situation. If the offender was an American or Allied soldier or civilian, <b>the</b> <b>troopers</b> made <b>the</b> arrest. This procedure built up {{the prestige of the}} new German police in the eyes of their own people.|$|R

25|$|Each faction {{contains}} different classes, {{each with}} a distinct backstory and a branching storyline affected by players' moral choices. Classes are exclusive to one faction or the other. However, the classes of one faction mirror the classes of the other (for example, Jedi Knight and Sith Warrior). Eight classes exist: the Bounty Hunter, Sith Warrior, Imperial Agent, and Sith Inquisitor for the Sith Empire; and <b>the</b> <b>Trooper,</b> Smuggler, Jedi Knight, and Jedi Consular for the Galactic Republic. Although each class has a distinct storyline, they are integrated with the game's overall arc.|$|E
25|$|Other historians {{claim that}} Custer never {{approached}} the river, but rather continued north across the coulee {{and up the}} other side, where he gradually came under attack. According to this theory, by the time Custer realized he was badly outnumbered, {{it was too late}} to break back to the south where Reno and Benteen could have provided assistance. Two men from the 7th Cavalry, the young Crow scout Ashishishe (known in English as Curley) and <b>the</b> <b>trooper</b> Peter Thompson, claimed to have seen Custer engage the Indians. The accuracy of their recollections remains controversial; accounts by battle participants and assessments by historians almost universally discredit Thompson's claim.|$|E

He then began feuding with Mr. Saito, who defeated {{him for the}} AWA World Heavyweight Championship on February 10, 1990 in the Tokyo Dome during a tour of Japan. Zbyszko regained the title at SuperClash 4 on April 8, 1990, in Saint Paul and successfully defended it against <b>The</b> <b>Trooper,</b> Brad Rheingans, and Nikita Koloff (who he defeated on May 5, 1990 at Twin Wars '90) {{toward the end of}} his reign.

The Governor was not wearing a seat belt. Friends had long {{said that they had}} rarely seen him wear one. When asked why the state trooper who was driving would not have asked Corzine to put on his seat belt, a staffer said the governor was [...] "not always amenable to suggestion".
