Several regimes of the structural properties are observed for the nanotubes and the polyiodides under pressure. Raman responses of both compounds exhibit correlations over the whole pressure range (0 – 17 GPa). Modifications, in particular, take place, respectively, between 1 and 2. 3 GPa for polyiodides and between 7 and 9 GPa for nanotubes, depending on the experiment. Differences between one experiment to another are {{discussed in terms of}} nanotube filling homogeneity. These transitions can be presumably assigned to the tube ovalization pressure and to the <b>tube</b> <b>collapse</b> pressure. A nonreversibility of several polyiodide mode modifications is evidenced and interpreted in terms of a progressive linearization of the iodine polyanions and a reduction in the charged species on pressure release. Furthermore, the significant change in the mode intensities could be associated to an enhancement of lattice modes, suggesting the formation of a new structure inside the nanotube. Changes in the nanotube mode positions after pressure release point out a decrease in the charge transfer in the hybrid system consistent with the observed evolution of the charged species...|$|E

Theoretical models, numerical calculations, and simulations describing the formation of these features have existed for a few decades, but {{there are only a}} few observational studies in direct support of the simulations. In this study we present the evolution of small-scale magnetic features with a spatial resolution close to 0. 15 arcsecond and compare these observations with those predicted by numerical simulations and also with previous observational work of a similar nature. We analyze a 40 min time sequence of full Stokes spectropolarimetric 630. 25 nm data from a plage region near the Sun center. We use line-of-sight velocities and magnetic field measurements obtained using Milne-Eddington inversion techniques with and without stray-light compensation along with measured continuum and line minimum intensities. We discuss the results in relation to earlier observations and simulations. We present eight cases involving strong downflows and magnetic field intensification. All cases studied are associated with the formation of a bright point in the continuum. In three out of the eight cases we find the presence of weak opposite polarity field in close proximity to the downflow. Our data are consistent with earlier simulations describing flux <b>tube</b> <b>collapse,</b> but the transition to a state with stronger field appears transient and short-lived, rather than resulting in a permanent field intensification. Three cases of weak opposite polarity field found adjacent to the downflows do not appear related to reconnection but may be related to overturning convection pulling down some field lines and leading to up/down "serpentine" field, as seen in some simulations.

40|$|The Sun's {{magnetic}} field is structured over {{a range of}} scales that span approximately seven orders of magnitudes, four of which lie beyond the resolving power of current telescopes. Here {{we have used a}} Hinode SOT/SP deep mode data set for the quiet-sun disk center in combination with constraints from the Hanle effect to derive scaling laws that describe how the magnetic structuring varies from the resolved scales down to the magnetic diffusion limit, where the field ceases to be frozen-in. The focus of the analysis is a derivation of the magnetic energy spectrum, but we also discuss the scale dependence of the probability density function (PDF) for the flux densities {{and the role of the}} cancellation function for the average unsigned flux density. Analysis of the Hinode data set with the line-ratio method reveals a collapsed flux population in the form of flux tubes with a size distribution that is peaked in the 10 - 100 km range. Magnetic energy is injected into this scale range by the instability mechanism of flux <b>tube</b> <b>collapse,</b> which is driven by the external gas pressure in the superadiabatic region at the top of the convection zone. This elevates the magnetic energy spectrum just beyond the telescope resolution limit. Flux tube decay feeds an inertial range that cascades down the scale spectrum to the magnetic diffusion limit, and which contains the tangled, "hidden" flux that is known to exist from observations of the Hanle effect. The observational constraints demand that the total magnetic energy in the hidden flux must be of the same order as the total energy in the kG flux tubes. Both the flux tubes and the hidden flux are found to be preferentially located in the intergranular lanes, which is to be expected since they are physically related.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Boston UniversityThe mid-Infrared (mid-IR: 3 - 12 µm {{wavelength}} range) {{spectral range}} represents {{a part of}} the electromagnetic spectrum that impacts practically every aspect of human society, and is used for biomedical surgery, chemical sensing to technologies that enhance defense capabilities. Semiconductors like silicon and germanium can effectively transmit light in the mid infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. In addition to remote transmission ofmid-Infrared light, by tailoring the index of refraction of a semiconductor fiber waveguide, one can manipulate the nonlinear properties of light pulses, which leads to temporally and spectrally shaping them, thus using the passive optical fiber itself as a medium to create new color sources, or detection systems. To create low loss waveguides {{and to be able to}} manipulate light, there is the necessity to fabricate refractive index structures. Current semiconductor waveguides that have refractive index structures are short in length (~ 30 cm), while long semiconductor waveguides do not possess refractive index structures. Optical fiber is fabricated by drawing preforms in a fiber draw tower. The most versatile technique for preform fabrication with refractive index structures is the Modified Chemical V apor Deposition (NICVD) process. In this research, the MCVD and the draw tower in the BU Photonics Center were used to deposit silicon and germanium inside glass tubes which has not been done before. Precursor gases like silane and germane were flown through Duran, Vycor and Fused silica tubes in a tube fm·nce to deposit silicon and germanium in the inner surface of the tubes. The as-deposited glass tubes were collapsed in the flame on the MCVD lathe to form solid preforms. The preforms were characterized using X-Ray Diffraction, optical and electron microscopy to understand the MCVD reaction kinetics. The characterization data was used to model the deposition behaviour with temperature and gas flow rates. Fluid dynamics software was used to model the <b>tube</b> <b>collapse</b> parameters.

40|$|We {{consider}} the steady propagation {{of an air}} finger into a buckled elastic tube initially filled with viscous fluid. This study is motivated by the physiological problem of pulmonary airway reopening. The system is modelled using geometrically nonlinear Kirchhoff–Love shell theory coupled to the free-surface Stokes equations. The resulting three-dimensional fluid–structure-interaction problem is solved numerically by a fully coupled finite element method. The system is governed by three dimensionless parameters: (i) the capillary number, Ca=[mu]U/[sigma]*, represents the ratio of viscous to surface-tension forces, where [mu] is the fluid viscosity, U is the finger's propagation speed and [sigma]* is the surface tension at the air–liquid interface; (ii) [sigma]=[sigma]*/(RK) represents the ratio of surface tension to elastic forces, where R is the undeformed radius of the tube and K its bending modulus; and (iii) A[infty infinity]=A*[infty infinity]/(4 R 2), characterizes the initial degree of <b>tube</b> <b>collapse,</b> where A*[infty infinity] is the cross-sectional area of the tube {{far ahead of the}} bubble. The generic behaviour of the system is found to be very similar to that observed in previous two-dimensional models (Gaver et al. 1996; Heil 2000). In particular, we find a two-branch behaviour in the relationship between dimensionless propagation speed, Ca, and dimensionless bubble pressure, p*b/([sigma]*/R). At low Ca, a decrease in p*b is required to increase the propagation speed. We present a simple model that explains this behaviour and why it occurs in both two and three dimensions. At high Ca, p*b increases monotonically with propagation speed and p*b/([sigma]*/R) [is proportional to] Ca for sufficiently large values of [sigma] and Ca. In a frame of reference moving with the finger velocity, an open vortex develops ahead of the bubble tip at low Ca, but as Ca increases, the flow topology changes and the vortex disappears. An increase in dimensional surface tension, [sigma]*, causes an increase in the bubble pressure required to drive the air finger at a given speed; p*b also increases with A*[infty infinity] and higher bubble pressures are required to open less strongly buckled tubes. This unexpected finding could have important physiological ramifications. If [sigma]* is sufficiently small, steady airway reopening can occur when the bubble pressure is lower than the external (pleural) pressure, in which case the airway remains buckled (non-axisymmetric) after the passage of the air finger. Furthermore, we find that the maximum wall shear stresses exerted on the airways during reopening may be large enough to damage the lung tissue...|$|E
