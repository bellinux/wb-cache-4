5|$|Cleveland Lakefront Station is an Amtrak {{train station}} at North Coast Harbor in Cleveland, Ohio. The station {{was built in}} 1977 <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>service</b> to the Lake Shore Limited route, which was {{reinstated}} by Amtrak via Cleveland and Toledo in 1975.

5|$|In 2014 and 2015 several {{incidents}} involving worker mistreatment surfaced, {{indicating that}} employment agencies often neglect workers' rights or are complicit in {{the cycle of}} abuse; {{there have also been}} many instances of failure <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>service</b> to employers. According to media reports, between 2009 and 2012 the Consumer Council in Hong Kong received nearly 800 complaints about agencies. Many complaints concerned workers who did not match the descriptions provided, {{to the extent that it}} was suspected that the agencies deliberately misrepresented the workers' experience. The 2015 death of Elis Kurniasih, awaiting her work visa before beginning employment, exposed grey areas and legal loopholes in the Employment Agency Regulations; Kurniasih was crushed to death by falling masonry at an agency boarding house in North Point. Worker protections against illegal fees, unsanitary accommodations and lack of insurance were criticised as inadequate.|$|E

Lakefront Station was built in 1976–1977 and opened for service in 1977 <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>service</b> for the Lake Shore Limited, which had resumed service via Toledo in 1975. The station officially opened on June 29, 1977, with the formal dedication occurring on July 12.
