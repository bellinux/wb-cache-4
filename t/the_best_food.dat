5|$|The {{first people}} known {{to live in}} the Catlins, Māori of the Kāti Mamoe, Waitaha, and Kāi Tahu iwi (tribes), merged via {{marriage}} and conquest into the iwi now known as Kāi Tahu. Archaeological evidence of human presence dates back to approximately 1350 AD. The area's inhabitants were semi-nomadic, travelling from Stewart Island/Rakiura in the south and inland to Central Otago. They generally dwelt near river mouths for easy access to <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>food</b> resources. In legend, the Catlins forests further inland were inhabited by Maeroero (wild giants).|$|E
25|$|Individual ants do not exhibit complex behaviours, yet {{a colony}} of ants collectively {{achieves}} complex tasks such as constructing nests, {{taking care of their}} young, building bridges and foraging for food. A colony of ants can collectively select (i.e. send most workers towards) the best, or closest, food source from several in the vicinity. Such collective decisions are achieved using positive feedback mechanisms. Selection of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>food</b> source is achieved by ants following two simple rules. First, ants which find food return to the nest depositing a pheromone chemical. More pheromone is laid for higher quality food sources. Thus, if two equidistant food sources of different qualities are found simultaneously, the pheromone trail to the better one will be stronger. Ants in the nest follow another simple rule, to favor stronger trails, on average. More ants then follow the stronger trail, so more ants arrive at the high quality food source, and a positive feedback cycle ensures, resulting in a collective decision for <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>food</b> source. If there are two paths from the ant nest to a food source, then the colony usually selects the shorter path. This is because the ants that first return to the nest from the food source {{are more likely to be}} those that took the shorter path. More ants then retrace the shorter path, reinforcing the pheromone trail.|$|E

25|$|The Klabautermann's benevolent {{behaviour}} lasts {{as long as}} {{the crew}} and captain treat the creature respectfully. A Klabautermann will not leave its ship until it {{is on the verge of}} sinking. To this end, superstitious sailors in the 19th century demanded that others pay the Klabautermann respect. Ellett has recorded one rumour that a crew even threw its captain overboard for denying the existence of the ship's Klabautermann. Heinrich Heine has reported that one captain created a place for his ship's Klabautermann in his cabin and that the captain offered the spirit <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>food</b> and drink he had to offer. Klabautermanns are easily angered. Their ire manifests in pranks such as tangling ropes and laughing at sailors who shirk their chores.|$|E

2500|$|Tsar Nicholas I (reigned 1825–1855) lavished {{attention}} on his very large army; {{with a population}} of 60–70 million people, the army included a million men. [...] They had outdated equipment and tactics, but the tsar, who dressed like a soldier and surrounded himself with officers, [...] gloried in the victory over Napoleon in 1812 and took enormous pride in its smartness on parade. [...] The cavalry horses, for example, were only trained in parade formations, and did poorly in battle. The glitter and braid masked profound weaknesses that he did not see. He put generals in charge of most of his civilian agencies regardless of their qualifications. An agnostic who won fame in cavalry charges was made supervisor of [...] Church affairs. The Army became the vehicle of upward social mobility for noble youths from non-Russian areas, such as Poland, the Baltic, Finland and Georgia. [...] On the other hand, many miscreants, petty criminals and undesirables were punished by local officials by enlisting them for life in the [...] Army. [...] The conscription system was highly unpopular with people, as was the practice of forcing peasants to house the soldiers for six months of the year. Curtiss finds that [...] "The pedantry of Nicholas' military system, which stressed unthinking obedience and parade ground evolutions rather than combat training, produced ineffective commanders in time of war." [...] His commanders in the Crimean War were old and incompetent, and indeed so were his muskets as the colonels sold the best equipment and <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>food.</b>|$|E
