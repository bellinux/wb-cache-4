40|$|Obviously, human speech {{comprehension}} works in an incremental way: Unbiased introspection {{as well as}} evidence from psycholinguistics strongly suggest that we start to recognize a word before it has been completely uttered; even more, we may interrupt our conversation partner at that point if we disagree with what we <b>think</b> (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> will be saying. Thus, incrementality is not restricted to any particular level of human {{speech comprehension}}, but is a general principle that is valid for all levels of processing [...] - thus making simultaneous interpretation possible. From a more technical point of view, incrementality would offer several advantages when constructing a machine interpretation system. The enormous processing amount {{that is necessary to}} cope with e. g. input consisting of continuous and spontaneous speech can partially be reduced by means of incremental processing. There have been several investigations on the use of incrementality for natural language understanding at various levels [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The Vanilla Passport Option is an {{insurance}} against trading loss. In this paper, we add various exotic features to the Vanilla contract and price the resulting financial products. The assumptions {{that we make}} {{are the same as}} the Black-Scholes ones and the resulting pricing equations are Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman type equations or parabolic free boundary PDE's which can be solved via finite difference methods. 1 1 Introduction: the Vanilla Passport Option The Passport Option is {{an insurance}} against trading loss. The noteholder is allowed to `trade' a particular asset (of price S) during the life of the Option, T. The number of assets he 'holds' at a particular time t is denoted q and can be positive (if the noteholder thinks the asset price is going to go up) or negative (if <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>S</b> is going to go down). There is however a constraint (specified in the contract) on q, this is the position limit C: jqj C. So q can be any value in [; C] and it is the noteholder who decide [...] ...|$|R
