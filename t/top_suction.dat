40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of steady laminar flow of viscous {{incompressible}} fluid between two parallel porous plates with bottom injection and <b>top</b> <b>suction.</b> The flow is driven by a pressure gradient @ p @ x and uniform vertical flow is generated i. e. the vertical velocity is constant everywhere in the field flow i. e. v = v w = constant. Also a solution for the small and large Reynold number is discussed and the graph of velocity profile for flow between parallel plates with the bottom injection and <b>top</b> <b>suction</b> for different values of Reynold numbers is drawn...|$|E

Since ambient {{currents}} are faster at the <b>top,</b> the <b>suction</b> effect that they produce by Bernoulli's principle does some of the work for free. Sponges can control the water flow by various combinations of wholly or partially closing the osculum and ostia (the intake pores) and varying the beat of the flagella, and may shut it down if {{there is a lot of}} sand or silt in the water.|$|R

In 2015 Hunan TV Investment Association, the exclusive naming rights of season 3 is still gotten by Liby Enterprise Group, 3 millions to obtain the naming rights, higher than season 2 0.65 millions, as the <b>top</b> 3 <b>suction</b> gold programme of Hunan Television programme, after Where Are We Going?Dad (season 3) (5 millions) and Happy Camp (3.5 millions).|$|R
40|$|Pure {{shear wave}} data are only very rarely {{acquired}} for offshore site investigations and exploration. Here, we present {{details of a}} novel, seabed-coupled, shear wave vibrator and field data recorded by a densely populated, multicomponent ocean-bottom cable, to improve shallow soil characterization. The prototype shear wave vibrator uses vibroseis technology adopted for marine environments through its instalment on <b>top</b> of a <b>suction</b> anchor, assuring seabed coupling in combination with self-weight penetration. The prototype is depth rated to 1500 m water depth, and can be rotated while installed in the seabed. The philosophy is to acquire fully complementary seismic data to conventional P- and P-to-S-converted waves, in particular for 2 -D profiling, VSP (vertical seismic profiling) or monitoring purposes, thereby exploiting advantages of shear waves over compressional waves for determining, for example, anisotropy, small-strain shear modulus and excess pore pressures/effective stress. The source was primarily designed for reservoir depths. However, significant energy is emitted as surface waves, which provide detailed geotechnical information through mapping of shear wave velocities in potentially high resolution of the upper soil units. To fully utilize pure shear wave content, a proper analysis of surface waves is paramount, due to the proximity of surface wave propagation speed with shear wave velocities. The experiment {{was carried out in}} the northern North Sea in 364 m water depth. Cable dragging was necessary to obtain close receiver spacing (2. 5 m effective spacing), with total line length of 600 m. Frequency-waveform transforms reveal both Scholte and Love waves. Up to six surface wave modes are identified, that is, fundamental mode and several higher surface wave modes. The occurrence of these two different dispersive surface wave types with well-resolved higher modes allows for a unique analysis and inversion scheme for highresolution mapping of physical properties in the shallow subsurface as well as anisotropy, which is discussed in an accompanying paper. The data presented in this paper are thus a unique (long and densely populated receiver array allows for multimodal Love and Scholte surface waves from the marine environment) but challenging (marine operations) marine data set...|$|R
40|$|Nitrate (NO₃⁻) {{leaching}} from agriculture {{has become}} an increasigly important issue in New Zealand. There {{has been an increase}} in NO₃⁻ leaching in recent years, with the cause of this mainly due to increases in cattle numbers and the application of N fertilisers. NO₃⁻ leaching is of importance due to its economic cost to farmers, environmental impact and potential health risk. Economic cost to the farmers occurs when leached nitrogen (N) has to be replaced with fertiliser N. There is also a major environmental concern about eutrophication. Eutrophication causes an increase in algae and aquatic life and reduces the recreational value of waterways. Winter forage grazing systems leach disproportitally high amounts of N, compared {{with the rest of the}} farming system. There are very few measurements of nitrate leaching losses from below winter grazed fodder beet (FB) in New Zealand. Measurements are needed urgently to quantify and ultimately minimise NO₃⁻ losses from these systems. The current systems of measuring NO₃⁻ leaching suffer from limitations such as being labour intensive, the inability to measure nitrate leaching under cultivation and the need to scale up results from small plots or lysimeters. The objective of this research project was to develop a new system of measuring N leaching that could accurately quantify N leaching under a winter grazed FB crop without the limitations of current systems. The suction cup and lysimeter array (SCALAR) system was developed to overcome these limitations. This was done through having a single collection/retrieval site, changing the depth of the <b>top</b> of the <b>suction</b> cup shaft to below the level of cultivation in soil, increasing the number of suction cups per unit area and having a large measurement area (0. 16 ha). The SCALAR system was developed and tested in this research project. The results showed that the SCALAR system successfully overcome the limitations of previous measurement systems. The results of this study showed the total N leaching under the winter grazed FB crop was 106. 9 kg N/ha. Of this, 101. 5 kg N/ha was leached in the form of NO₃⁻ and 5. 4 kg N/ha was leached in the form of ammonium (NH₄⁺). However, these values are likely to have been affected by the development and testing of the SCALAR system and are therefore not considered to be representative of a typical winter grazed FB crop. Future research is still needed to quantify N leaching losses under a winter grazed FB crop using the SCALAR system that has been developed in this project. The SCALAR system will potentially remain in the ground for 20 - 30 years, allowing it to be used in future research to quantify N leaching under a variety of farming systems...|$|R
