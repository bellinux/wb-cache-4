60|$|The snow-banks on {{the face}} of the {{dome-shaped}} mountain appearing favourable for ascertaining the position of the level of perpetual snow, I ascended to them on the 6th of September, and found the mean elevation along an even, continuous, and gradual slope, with a full south-west exposure, to be 15,985 feet by barometer, and 15,816 feet by boiling-point. These beds of snow, however broad and convex, cannot nevertheless be distinguished from glaciers: they occupy, it is true, mountain slopes, and do not fill hollows (like glaciers commonly so called), but they display the ribboned structure of ice, and being viscous fluids, descend at a rate and to a distance depending on the slope, and on the amount of annual accumulation behind. Their termination must therefore be far below that point at which all the snow that falls melts, which is the <b>theoretical</b> <b>line</b> of perpetual snow. Before returning I attempted to proceed northwards to the great glacier, hoping to descend by its lateral moraine, but a heavy snow-storm drove me down to Yeumtong.|$|E

30|$|To {{properly}} {{obtain the}} spectrum, we first determine the intensity profile {{by comparing the}} pixel brightness (in arbitrary intensities) versus the number of pixels along the given direction.

To this end, the program uses a database containing the main frequencies and typical emissions of meteor spectra. These frequencies have been taken from the NIST Atomic Spectra Database ([URL] Thus, the software can superimpose the <b>theoretical</b> spectral <b>lines</b> with the new lines of the observed spectrum. Then, it selects some known lines of the spectrum, such as Na and Mg, and the software automatically sets the different positions of other well-known <b>theoretical</b> <b>lines.</b>|$|R

By analyzing the temporal characteristics of the morphological responses, corresponding to chemotaxis and cell arrest, we have recently discovered that the choice between them is made by transduction of the continuous binding process into either single or multiple stimuli within defined time intervals, initiating chemotaxis or cell arrest, respectively. Both experimental and <b>theoretical</b> <b>lines</b> of evidence are presented to support the validity of this unique mechanism...|$|R
