But humanity cannot produce the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> in the universe – the heavenly bodies, etc. The being, therefore, who produces them is superior to humanity. But who is there that is superior to humanity, except God? Therefore, God exists.|$|E
5|$|Most living <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> {{visible to}} the naked eye in their adult form are eukaryotes, {{including}} humans. However, a large number of eukaryotes are also microorganisms. Unlike bacteria and archaea, eukaryotes contain organelles such as the cell nucleus, the Golgi apparatus and mitochondria in their cells. The nucleus is an organelle that houses the DNA that makes up a cell's genome. DNA (Deoxyribonuclaic acid) itself is arranged in complex chromosomes.|$|E
5|$|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle a spiritualist who {{supported}} the mediumship of Home stated that he was unusual in that he had four different types of mediumship: direct voice (the ability to let spirits audibly speak); trance speaker (the ability to let spirits speak through oneself); clairvoyant (ability to see <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> out of view); and physical medium (moving objects at a distance, levitation, etc., which {{was the type of}} mediumship in which he had no equal).|$|E

Their staple diet is mostly bloodworms and other insect larvae, {{but they also}} feed on tadpoles and small fish. A few species, especially those that live in temporary waters, are likely to leave water. Nymphs of Cordulegaster bidentata sometimes hunt small arthropods {{on the ground at}} night.|$|E
5|$|The last heroine in Clannad is {{a first-year}} student named Fuko Ibuki {{who has a}} distant {{attitude}} towards others and, before she met Tomoya, was generally seen alone by herself making wood carvings of starfish with a small knife to give to others as presents. Fuko is extremely enthralled by starfish, or <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> star-shaped, and will often go into short euphoric bouts where her awareness of her surroundings is completely overtaken.|$|E
5|$|To {{offset the}} {{difficulty}} of having things forbidden for use, there are certain <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> recommended by the Judges, and therefore grant Judge Points if used. Judge Points (JP) are used to carry out combos with nearby allies or to summon a Totema. JP are also received upon knocking out an opponent. Later in the game, the player gains {{the ability to use}} law cards, which can add laws, and anti-law cards, which can nullify laws that are already in effect.|$|E

50|$|In Nemesius' fourth {{theory of}} {{providence}} he describes <b>that</b> there <b>are</b> certain <b>things</b> <b>that</b> can <b>be</b> attributed neither to mind nor {{to the nature}} of things.

5|$|Some lead {{compounds}} are colorful {{and are used}} widely in paints, and lead paint is a major route of lead exposure in children. A study conducted in 1998–2000 found that 38 million housing units in the US had lead-based paint, down from a 1990 estimate of 64 million. Deteriorating lead paint can produce dangerous lead levels in household dust and soil. Deteriorating lead paint and lead-containing household dust are the main causes of chronic lead poisoning. The lead breaks down into the dust and since children {{are more prone to}} crawling on the floor, it is easily ingested. Many young children display pica, eating <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not food. Even a small amount of a lead-containing product such as a paint chip or a sip of glaze can contain tens or hundreds of milligrams of lead. Eating chips of lead paint presents a particular hazard to children, generally producing more severe poisoning than occurs from dust. Because removing lead paint from dwellings, e.g. by sanding or torching creates lead-containing dust and fumes, it is generally safer to seal the lead paint under new paint (excepting moveable windows and doors, which create paint dust when operated). Alternately, special precautions must be taken if the lead paint is to be removed. In oil painting it was once common for colours such as yellow or white to be made with lead carbonate. Lead white oil colour was the main white of oil painters until superseded by compounds containing zinc or titanium in the mid-20th century. It is speculated that the painter Caravaggio and possibly Francisco Goya and Vincent Van Gogh had lead poisoning due to overexposure or carelessness when handling this colour.|$|E

25|$|Deception is {{the act of}} {{propagating}} {{beliefs in}} <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not true, or not the whole truth (as in half-truths or lying by omission). Deception can involve dissimulation, propaganda, and sleight of hand, as well as distraction, camouflage, or concealment. There is also self-deception, as in bad faith.|$|E
25|$|Sleep {{paralysis}} is when, during awakening {{or falling}} asleep, one is aware {{but unable to}} move. During an episode, one may hear, feel, or see <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> not there. It often results in fear. Episodes generally last less {{than a couple of}} minutes.

25|$|Lesbians often attract media attention, {{particularly}} {{in relation to}} feminism, love and sexual relationships, marriage and parenting. Some writers who have asserted this trend can lead to exploitative and unjustified plot devices. The lack of lesbian portrayal in the media can also influence the consumer's view of the particular sexuality. Common tropes of lesbians in the media include butch or femme lesbians and lesbian parents. The word Butch lesbian comes {{from the idea of}} a lesbian expressing themselves as masculine by dressing masculine, behaving masculinely, or liking <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> deemed masculine, while the word femme lesbian comes from the idea of a lesbian expressing themselves as feminine by dressing feminine, behaving femininely, or liking <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> deemed feminine. In the media, lesbian marriage and parenting are depicted in shows such as the live action television show The Fosters and even the children's cartoon Steven Universe.|$|E

25|$|Nick Yee has {{surveyed}} {{more than}} 35,000 MMORPG players {{over the past}} several years, focusing on psychological and sociological aspects of these games.
