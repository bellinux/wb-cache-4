Laboratory Information Management Systems help by tracking these processes. Regulation applies to both staff and supplies. , twelve US states require molecular pathologists to be licensed; several boards such as <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Medical Genetics and <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Pathology certify technologists, supervisors, and laboratory directors.|$|E

The NBO was never itself {{accepted}} as an accrediting entity by {{organizations such as}} <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Medical Specialties, and its certification was considered invalid by many hospitals and insurance companies. Paul let his own ABO certification lapse in 2005, which did not affect his practice in Kentucky, since the state does not require board certification.|$|E

5|$|After {{the repeal}} of the Stamp Act, Parliament took a {{different}} approach to raising revenue, passing the Townshend Acts in 1767 which established new duties on various goods imported into the colonies. These duties were relatively low because the British ministry wanted to establish the precedent that Parliament had the right to impose tariffs on the colonies before raising them. Revenues from these duties were to be used to pay for governors and judges who would be independent of colonial control. To enforce compliance with the new laws, the Townshend Acts created a customs agency known as <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Custom Commissioners, which was headquartered in Boston.|$|E

In 1960, she established the professional certification agency known as <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Health Physics. Despite contracting leukemia in 1956, Anderson remained undeterred in her career and maintained her position for several years until her eventual death in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Once {{undergraduate}} education is completed the individual should proceed to graduate level courses. Typically, forensic anthropologists obtain doctorates in physical anthropology and have completed coursework in osteology, forensics, and archaeology. It is also recommended that individuals looking {{to pursue a}} forensic anthropology profession get experience in dissection usually through a gross anatomy class as well as useful internships with investigative agencies or practicing anthropologists. Once educational requirements are complete one can become certified by the forensic anthropology society in the region. This can include the IALM exam given by the Forensic Anthropology Society of Europe or the certification exam given by <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Forensic Anthropology.|$|E

5|$|The {{arrival of}} Protestant missionaries {{on a large}} scale {{beginning}} in 1814 was a primary contributor to the development of political awareness among Sri Lankan Tamils. Activities by missionaries of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Commissioners for Foreign Missions and Methodist and Anglican churches led to a revival among Hindu Tamils who created their own social groups, built their own schools and temples, and published their own literature to counter the missionary activities. The success of this effort led to a new confidence for the Tamils, encouraging them {{to think of themselves as}} a community, and it paved the way for their emergence as a cultural, religious, and linguistic society in the mid-19th century.|$|E
5|$|While in Hawaiʻi, Pitman and {{his older}} sister Mary {{attended}} Mrs.Wetmore's children's school in Hilo. The school was located at the Wetmores' residence on Church Street. Taught by Lucy Sheldon Taylor Wetmore, the wife of American missionary doctor and government physician Charles Hinckley Wetmore, {{who had come to}} Hawaii in 1848 with <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM), the two elder Pitman children received their education in English rather than Hawaiian. This was unusual since Hawaiian was the official language of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi, and all other schools in Hilo were conducted in the Hawaiian language. Mrs.Wetmore taught the children reading, writing, spelling, arithmetic and singing, while also reinforcing the curriculum with a strong adherence to the principles of the Protestant faith. Like the Pitman siblings, many of their classmates were also of half-Hawaiian (hapa-kanaka) descent with a majority of them being Chinese-Hawaiians (hapa-pake).|$|E
5|$|Balaji Sadasivan {{was born}} on 11 July 1955 in Singapore, the son of Indian immigrants. A student at Raffles Institution, Siglap Secondary School (1969–1971) and National Junior College (1972–1973), he {{subsequently}} studied medicine at the University of Singapore. In his second year, he won an essay competition organised by the World Health Organization (WHO) and received the opportunity to attend a healthcare workshop in Minamata, Japan, where he learned about the devastating effects of Minamata disease, a neurological syndrome caused by severe mercury poisoning. This led him to specialise in neurosurgery later on, which was not a popular discipline at the time. In 1979, Sadasivan graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (M.B.B.S.), {{and two years later}} embarked on further studies at the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, becoming a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons (F.R.C.S.) in 1984. He trained at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, Michigan, between 1985 and 1990, obtaining a diploma from <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Board</b> <b>of</b> Neurology Surgery and becoming a fellow at Harvard University in 1990. He also worked at Brigham and Women's Hospital, a teaching affiliate of Harvard, and at the Children's Hospital Boston in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1997, he obtained a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B. (Hons.)) from the University of London.|$|E
