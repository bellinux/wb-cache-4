The ion beams bombard the surface and alter the microstructure of the film. When the deposition reaction takes place on the hot substrate surface, the films can develop an internal <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> due to the mismatch in the {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} between the substrate and the film. High-energy ions can be used to bombard these ceramic thermal barrier coatings and change the <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> into compressive stress.

40|$|Distribution of {{stresses}} about rectangular openings excavated in {{bedded rock}} was investigated {{by means of}} photoelastic experiments using 37 kinds of models made of gelatine jelly. By those model experiments, influence of ratio of the breadth to {{the height of the}} opening, thickness and elastic modulus of immediate roof and high roof, thickness of packs in the goaf, and fissures contained in the immediate roof or the high roof on the distribution of stresses around the opening was studied. Influence of the thickness of immediate roof, height of caved rocks in the goaf or rigidity of face props in long wall working face were investigated as well. As the results of those experiments, following conclusions were obtained : 1. The <b>tensile</b> <b>stresses</b> of the roof in the bedded rock are larger than these stresses which arise in the non-bedded rock, and the <b>tensile</b> <b>stresses</b> on the roof are larger than the <b>tensile</b> <b>stresses</b> on the floor. 2. When the immediate roof is thick, the <b>tensile</b> <b>stresses</b> on the roof and the compressive stresses on the side walls are considerably smaller than those stresses which arise when the immediate roof is thin. 3. When the high roof is thick, the <b>tensile</b> <b>stresses</b> on the roof are still more small, and the compressive stresses on the side walls are a little larger than these stresses which arise when the high roof is thin. 4.

25|$|The {{reinforcement}} in a RC structure, {{such as a}} steel bar, has {{to undergo}} the same strain or deformation as the surrounding concrete {{in order to prevent}} discontinuity, slip or separation of the two materials under load. Maintaining composite action requires transfer of load between the concrete and steel. The direct stress is transferred from the concrete to the bar interface so as to change the <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> in the reinforcing bar along its length, this load transfer is achieved by means of bond (anchorage) and is idealized as a continuous stress field that develops {{in the vicinity of the}} steel-concrete interface.|$|E
25|$|Rearranging the Laplace and Poiseuille {{relations}} {{suggests that}} radial growth occurs {{as a result}} of circumferential stretch and circumferential growth {{occurs as a result}} of shear stress. Shear stress is proportional to the speed inside the vessel as well as the pressure drop between two fixed points on the vessel wall. The precise mechanism of vessel remodelling is believed to be high stress on the inner wall of the vessel which can induce growth, which heads toward uniform compressive and <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> {{on both sides of the}} vessel wall. Generally, it has been found that circumferential residual stress is compressive and tensile, indicating that inner layers of the endothelial tube grow more than outer layers.|$|E

25|$|Early designs {{including}} Siemens, Westinghouse, and Combustion Engineering had {{a mostly}} can-like shape built with reinforced concrete. As concrete {{has a very}} good compression strength compared to tensile, this is a logical design for the building materials since the extremely heavy top part of containment exerts a large downward force that prevents some <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> if containment pressure were to suddenly go up. As reactor designs have evolved, many nearly spherical containment designs for PWRs have also been constructed. Depending on the material used, this is the most apparently logical design because a sphere is the best structure for simply containing a large pressure. Most current PWR designs involve some combination of the two, with a cylindrical lower part and a half-spherical top.|$|E
25|$|The {{hip joint}} {{is unique in}} that it {{experiences}} combined mechanical loads. An axial load along the shaft of the femur results in compressive stress. Bending load at {{the neck of the}} femur causes <b>tensile</b> <b>stress</b> along {{the upper part of the}} neck and compressive stress along the lower part of the neck. While osteoarthritis and osteoporosis are associated with bone fracture as we age, these diseases are not the cause of the fracture alone. Low energy falls from standing are responsible for the majority of fractures in the elderly, but fall direction is also a key factor. Elderly tend to fall to the side as instead of forward, and the lateral hip and strikes the ground first. During a sideways fall, the chances of hip fracture see a 15-fold and 12-fold increase in elderly males and females, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Carotid IMT {{has been}} {{measured}} in numerous epidemiological and clinical studies. These have shown associations with numerous risk factors, including {{type 2 diabetes}} and impaired glucose tolerance, familial hypercholesterolemia, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides, rheumatoid arthritis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and air pollution. Since the 1990s, some small and larger scale clinical trials of lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions have also used carotid artery IMT as a surrogate endpoint for evaluating the regression and/or progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However the appropriateness of carotid IMT {{in this context is}} uncertain. Although carotid intima-media thickness is strongly associated with atherosclerosis, thickening of the intima-media may not always be due to atherosclerosis. Intima-medial thickening is a complex process, depending on a variety of factors, including local hemodynamics, blood pressure, shear stress and circumferential <b>tensile</b> <b>stress.</b> Changes in shear stress may adversely affect endothelial function and particle residence time, affecting the delivery and transport of potentially atherogenic particles into the arterial wall and consequent plaque formation. Blood pressure may affect IMT through blood vessel remodelling or wall hypertrophy in response to altered circumferential stress. Variations in IMT between different locations, such as the inflow side of branches, the inner curvature at bends and opposite the flow divider at bifurcations may reflect differences in local hemodynamic forces. However, an IMT greater than 0.9-1mm is highly likely to be indicative of atherosclerosis and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Often, the measurement of the IMT is measured in three locations: in the common carotid (typically at one cm proximal to the flow divider), at the bifurcation, and in the internal carotid artery. IMT measurements of the far (deeper) wall, by ultrasound, are generally considered more reliable than measurements performed on the near (more superficial) wall; although measurement of both near and far wall IMT has also been advocated.|$|E
