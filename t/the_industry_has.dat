5|$|Oil sands in Alberta have {{a proven}} reserve of , {{the second largest}} proven {{reserves}} of crude oil in the world. They have become the largest source of oil imported into the United States. With significant economic development and investment into the oil sands, <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> been enjoying strong support by both the province's government and the federal government. However, <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> also been subject to criticism due to {{the environmental impacts of}} bitumen exploitation. While <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> attempted to resolve these issues by developing new techniques, such as in situ extraction, environmental organizations, such as Greenpeace, have launched campaigns to delegitimize the resource, based on its greenhouse gas emission records.|$|E

The industry contributed a total of US$3.35 billion to the Oregon economy. 17,100 people participate in the wine industry with $527 million in wages. In 2014 70% was sold to US markets outside Oregon and 4% was sold internationally.|$|E
5|$|Biomass {{for heat}} and {{power is a}} fully mature {{technology}} which offers a ready disposal mechanism for municipal, agricultural, and industrial organic wastes. However, <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> remained relatively stagnant over the decade to 2007, even though demand for biomass (mostly wood) continues to grow in many developing countries. One {{of the problems of}} biomass is that material directly combusted in cook stoves produces pollutants, leading to severe health and environmental consequences, although improved cook stove programmes are alleviating some of these effects. First-generation biomass technologies can be economically competitive, but may still require deployment support to overcome public acceptance and small-scale issues.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe parametrically {{estimate}} total-factor {{energy efficiency}} (TFEE) scores for 10 industries in 14 developed countries {{for the period}} 1995 - 2005 using stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) technique. The model includes four inputs (labor, capital stock, energy, and non-energy intermediate inputs) and one output (value added). Unlike previous studies that use data envelopment analysis (DEA), our method can take into account statistical noises. The results show that More than half of <b>the</b> <b>industries</b> <b>have</b> insignificant changes in the inefficiency trend. However, construction, paper, and textile <b>industries</b> <b>have</b> significantly increasing inefficiency (decreasing efficiency). <b>The</b> metal <b>industry</b> is <b>the</b> only <b>industry</b> which <b>has</b> decreasing inefficiency (increasing efficiency). As a result, most of <b>the</b> OECD <b>industries</b> <b>have</b> much room in improving their total-factor energy efficiency. Moreover, {{more than half of}} <b>the</b> <b>industries</b> <b>have</b> insignificant changes in the inefficiency trend. However, construction, paper, and textile <b>industries</b> <b>have</b> significantly increasing inefficiency. <b>The</b> metal <b>industry</b> is <b>the</b> only <b>industry</b> which <b>has</b> decreasing inefficiency.

5|$|Most state-run {{radio and}} {{television}} stations are based in Ankara, but Istanbul is the primary hub of Turkish media. <b>The</b> <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> {{its roots in the}} former Ottoman capital, where the first Turkish newspaper, Takvim-i Vekayi (Calendar of Affairs), was published in 1831. The Cağaloğlu street on which the newspaper was printed, Bâb-ı Âli Street, rapidly became the center of Turkish print media, alongside Beyoğlu across the Golden Horn.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 13 {{million people}} went whale watching globally in 2008, in all oceans except the Arctic. Rules and {{codes of conduct}} have been created to minimize harassment of the whales. Iceland, Japan and Norway have both whaling and whale watching industries. Whale watching lobbyists {{are concerned that the}} most inquisitive whales, which approach boats closely and provide much of the entertainment on whale-watching trips, {{will be the first to}} be taken if whaling is resumed in the same areas. Whale watching generated US$2.1 billion (UK£1.4 billion) per annum in tourism revenue worldwide, employing around 13,000 workers. In contrast, the whaling industry, with the moratorium in place, generates US$31 million (UK£20 million) per year. The size and rapid growth of <b>the</b> <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> led to complex and continuing debates with the whaling industry about the best use of whales as a natural resource.|$|E

It has also been accused of harming the environment, particularly by causing soil contamination. Sitakunda's ecosystems are further threatened by deforestation, over-fishing, and groundwater contamination.

5|$|Denver's {{position}} {{near the}} mineral-rich Rocky Mountains encouraged mining and energy companies to spring {{up in the}} area. In {{the early days of}} the city, gold and silver booms and busts played a large role in the city's economic success. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the energy crisis in America and resulting high oil prices created an energy boom in Denver captured in the soap opera Dynasty. Denver was built up considerably during this time with the construction of many new downtown skyscrapers. When the price of oil dropped from $34 a barrel in 1981 to $9 a barrel in 1986, the Denver economy also dropped, leaving almost 15,000 oil industry workers in the area unemployed (including former mayor and current governor John Hickenlooper, a former geologist), and the nation's highest office vacancy rate (30%). <b>The</b> <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> recovered and the region has 700 employed petroleum engineers. Advances in hydraulic fracturing have made the DJ Basin of Colorado into an accessible and lucrative oil play. Energy and mining are still important in Denver's economy today, with companies such as EnCana, Halliburton, Smith International, Rio Tinto Group, Newmont Mining, Noble Energy, and Anadarko headquartered or having significant operations.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>industry</b> <b>has</b> {{come under}} threat, both from {{a decline in}} the number of ships {{scrapped}} annually – down from 70–80 to about 20 – and because of environmental and work safety concerns. There have been complaints that journalists and human rights activists are being barred from the ship breaking yards. The ship breaking industry is purportedly damaging the local ecology as well, taking a toll on the fish population and soil quality. A survey conducted by students of the Institute of Marine Science of Chittagong University in 2007 revealed that the soil of the locality is polluted by heavy metals including mercury (0.5 to 2.7ppm), lead (0.5 to 21.8ppm), chromium (220ppm), cadmium (0.3 to 2.9ppm), iron (2.6 to 5.6ppm), calcium (5.2 to 23.2ppm) and magnesium (6.5 to 10.57ppm). Safety standards in the industry are low; between 1995 and 2005, 150 workers were killed and 576 were maimed or injured. The main causes of death were fire or explosion, suffocation and inhaling CO2. These old ships also contain hazardous substances like asbestos, lead paint, heavy metals and PCBs. The workers are paid US$1.75 a day and have little access to medical treatment. Among the workers, 41% of are aged between 18 and 22 years, and many are reported to be as young as 10 years of age. There have also been allegations of large quantities of steel and non-ferrous items, such as bronze, aluminum, copper, and bronze-amalgam recovered from ship breaking being smuggled out of Bangladesh. There also are reports of pirates targeting tugboats pulling ships in.|$|E
