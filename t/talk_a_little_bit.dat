He travels across the United States and pits two bar owners {{against each other}} {{to see who can}} turn the most profit. But the twist is they have to run each other's bars for a night. How the show works is Mandel {{introduces}} each bar owner. Each owner then gets to <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> about what their bar offers and how they run things. Then the owners travel to each other's bars to spend a week there and meet the staff. In repeated interviews, the owners talk about how they feel about how the other bar is run and what types of changes they would make if they were the owner. Later on during the week, the owners [...] "take over" [...] the establishment and implement their rules and TV viewers observe how the staff reacts to these changes. Many times, there is friction between the staff and the owners at this stage in the competition. One major stipulation of the show is that the new owner cannot fire any staff members for breaking any of the new rules, but can discipline them in other ways. Finally, there is the [...] "relaunch" [...] night where the owner has complete control of the bar. This is the night that counts towards the profit totals which will determine who wins the competition. The winner receives a $10,000 grand prize.|$|E

5000|$|Following {{the success}} of the singer's 1993 career best-selling album Music Box, Carey and her {{management}} at Columbia Records began devising ideas and strategies for subsequent projects. Carey's then-husband, Tommy Mottola, head of Columbia's parent label Sony Music Entertainment, began mapping out possible follow ups for the singer during the pinnacle years of her career. During initial discussions regarding the thought of doing a Christmas-themed album with Carey and her writing partner of over four years, Walter Afanasieff, fear arose that it was not commercially expedient or wise to release holiday music at the peak of one's career, as it was more often equated with a release towards the end of a musician's waning career. Afanasieff recalled his sentiments during initial discussions for a holiday record: [...] "Back then, you didn't have a lot of artists with Christmas albums. It wasn't a known science at all back then, and there was nobody who did new, big Christmas songs. So we were going to release it as kind of an everyday, 'Hey, you know, we're putting out a Christmas album. No big deal.'" [...] Ultimately, with Mottola's persistence and Carey's initiative to be a [...] "risk-taker" [...] as Afanasieff put it, the song and its parent album, Merry Christmas, began taking form in early-mid 1994. Recording for the album began in June, while the Carey-Afanasieff songwriting duo penned [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] in late August. Often referencing herself a festive person and demonstrating a usual penchant for her love of all things Christmas, Carey began decorating the home she shared with Mottola in upstate New York (which also came equipped with a personal recording studio) with Christmas ornaments and other holiday-inspired trinkets. In doing so, Carey felt she could capture the essence and spirit of what she was singing and make her vocal performance and delivery more emotive and authentic. The songwriting pair carved out the chords, structure and melody for the song in just a quarter of an hour: [...] "It's definitely not 'Swan Lake,' ' admits Afanasieff. 'But that's why it's so popular — because it's so simple and palatable!". At first, Afanasieff admitted that he was puzzled and [...] "blanched" [...] as to where Carey wanted to take the melody and vocal scales, though she was [...] "adamant" [...] in her direction for the song. In an interview with Billboard, Afanasieff described the type of relationship he and Carey shared in the studio and as songwriters for the song and in general:It was always the same sort of system with us. We would write the nucleus of the song, the melody primary music, and then some of the words were there as we finished writing it. I started playing some rock 'n' roll piano and started boogie woogie-ing my left hand, and that inspired Mariah {{to come up with the}} melodic Sings. 'I don't want a lot for Christmas.' And then we started singing and playing around with this rock 'n' roll boogie song, which immediately came out to be the nucleus of what would end up being 'All I Want For Christmas Is You.' That one went very quickly: It was an easier song to write than some of the other ones. It was very formulaic, not a lot of chord changes. I tried to make it a little more unique, putting in some special chords that you really don't hear a lot of, which made it unique and special.Then for the next week or two Mariah would call me and say, 'What do you think about this bit?' We would <b>talk</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> until she got the lyrics all nicely coordinated and done. And then we just waited until the sessions began, which were in the summer of '94 where we got together in New York and started recording. And that's when we first hear her at the microphone singing, and the rest is history.Afanasieff flew back to California where he finished the song's programming and production. Originally, he had a live band play the drums and other instruments with the thought of giving it a more raw and affective sound. He was unhappy with the results of the recording and subsequently scrapped the effort and used his original, personal arrangement and programmed all the instruments heard on the song (with the exception of the background vocals) including the piano, effects, drums and triangle. While Carey continued writing material in her rented home in The Hamptons, Afanasieff completed the song's programming and awaited to rendezvous with her a final time in order to layer and harmonize the background vocals. In touching on several aspects of what excited her to record and release a Christmas album, Carey went into detail on what writing and recording the song and album meant for her: [...] "I'm a very festive person and I love the holidays. I've sung Christmas songs since I was a little girl. I used to go Christmas caroling. When it came to the album, we had to have a nice balance between standard Christian hymns and fun songs. It was definitely a priority for me to write at least a few new songs, but for the most part people really want to hear the standards at Christmas time, no matter how good a new song is." ...|$|E

5000|$|The book {{is built}} upon one what it terms {{one of the}} largest {{participatory}} photography programs ever undertaken, which the editors brought to the New York City Housing Authority in 2010 on behalf of the 501(c)(3) non-profit Seeing for Ourselves. Participants recruited from the projects were given single-use film cameras and trained in a twelve-week lecture/workshop course in photography. In between sessions, the participants would put into practice the lesson learned at the previous class. As Davis would tell CUNY-TV, [...] "We <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> about photography technique, such as light and shadow, or camera language, or composition. And we <b>talked</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> about the history of photography, and offered some inspirational photographers. And then the latter half was the photographers sharing their own work." [...] According to the book, cameras were donated by Kodak and computers by Dell Computers, while film was processed at cost by Duggal Visual Solutions. Beginning in a project in West Harlem that fall with 15 participants, the program is said by the book to have mushroomed to serving hundreds of residents of 16 projects by the time it ended in the spring of 2013. The program was covered by a New York City tabloid early on.|$|R

Based on a resulted transformation relation between arbitrary angle dependence of bottom scattering and the range dependence of reverberation in shallow water, some experimental data on bottom scattering at small grazing angles and low frequencies will be given in the third part.

40|$|If {{we want to}} {{say what}} “fundamentality” means, we have to start by {{approaching}} what we generally see at the empty place of the predicate “____ is fundamental”.

The difference led us to talk about the entities’ structures and their powers, and about the supervenience between these last two. The supervenience talk made us to see the fight between emergentism and reductionism as the difference between the irreducibility of laws and the reducibility of powers and structures to lower-order domains. Then, we conclude that “fundamentality” is a mereological relation – a relation that a whole structure has to a certain combination of its structural parts or that a power has to a certain combination of its constituent powers – of to be identical and to exist in virtue of them...|$|E

This is an honor for me to meet with you and to have this time to talk. RICHARD B. GOODE: My pleasure. GARDNER: Well, I know that you were born in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1916. Why don’t we begin by <b>talking</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> about your family background. What did your grandparents and your parents do in the Fort Worth area? 2 GOODE: Well, one of my grandfathers was a Baptist preacher. The other grandfather was an active Baptist layman. It so happens that my birthday and their birthdays were all on July thirty-first; an unusual coincidence. So I’m named after both of them: Richard and Benjamin. I don’t use the middle name much, but that’s my middle name. When I was born, my father was a small farmer. He had a varied career. Later, he was a carpenter and small contractor, and we always lived around in that area. My father was born in East Texas; my mother was born in Georgia. And that’s the family history. I was the only one of my immediate family—I had two older sisters—to attend college. Neither my parents nor my older sisters did. GARDNER: Your grandfather who was a preacher, was he a pastor of a church? GOODE: I think he was at various times, but not when I remember him. He was—well, he was essentially retired when I remembered him. My great-grandfather, by the way, was born in the eighteenth century. GARDNER: Is that right? GOODE: In 1786. GARDNER: Was that also in Texas...|$|R
500|$|As I was {{reporting}} to the Triton, I remember saying, [...] "This ship is an unusual one. We've {{got to do something}} special with it. What could it be?" [...] We <b>talked</b> about it <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit,</b> and nobody had any ideas. Finally, I got an idea. We'll do a stunt. We'll go around the world from North Pole to South Pole. That was my brainstorm. If {{you take a look at}} a map of the world, you'll see that's not a very easy way to go. [...] So we didn't do that. But I do remember thinking of it. And I made a speech to the crew, advising them of my thinking—that we were going to put this ship on the map. Well, that died out. Suddenly ... a phone call came, asking me if I could be in Washington tomorrow.|$|R
40|$|The topic I {{was asked}} to speak on today is {{cooperation}} in developing Asian bond markets. This is a subject on which there has been <b>a</b> lot of <b>talk</b> and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> of action. One reason why {{there has not been}} more progress in addressing this issue at the regional level may be that there is no agreement on the severity of the problem. Optimists emphasize that there has been very considerable progress in developing local currency bond markets since the Asian crisis. The capitalization of domestic bond markets has roughly doubled since 1997, from about 25 to nearly 50 per cent of GDP. 2 The relative importance of the bond market has also risen from less than 10 per cent of outstanding Asian credit in 1995 to for more than 20 per cent in 2002. Slowly but surely we can see increasing diversity of issuers and investors characteristic of a efficient and well-functioning market. Looking forward, {{there is every reason to}} expect that Asian bond markets will continue to grow. The region is likely to remain the fastest growing part of the world for the foreseeable future, and its growth will produce an expanding population of firms that will wish to finance some of their operations with debt as well as equity (among othe...|$|R
