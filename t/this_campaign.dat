5|$|<b>This</b> <b>campaign</b> takes places {{years after}} the {{events that led to}} the First Crusade and capture of Jerusalem. Saladin (who the player acts as {{throughout}} <b>this</b> <b>campaign)</b> is first tasked with establishing himself in Egypt and removing the Crusaders there, in order to become Sultan of Egypt. A villainous Crusader by the name of Reynald de Chatillon has continuously violated the fragile peace between the Crusaders and the Saracens, causing great concern to Saladin. Raids by Crusaders in the Red Sea are eventually suppressed by the Saracens. At the Battle of Hattin, the Saracens win a decisive victory over the combined strength of the Knights Templar, Knights Hospitallers, Jerusalem and the English Crusaders, capture Reynold de Chatillon (who is the only prisoner executed by Saladin personally) and obtain a piece of the True Cross as an important relic.|$|E

5|$|Alexander viewed Bessus as a usurper {{and set out}} {{to defeat}} him. <b>This</b> <b>campaign,</b> {{initially}} against Bessus, turned into a grand tour of central Asia. Alexander founded a series of new cities, all called Alexandria, including modern Kandahar in Afghanistan, and Alexandria Eschate ("The Furthest") in modern Tajikistan.

5|$|As in Britain, some Southern Rhodesian women {{during the}} war {{presented}} men not wearing military uniform with white feathers (symbolising cowardice). <b>This</b> <b>campaign</b> often went awry, {{as many of the}} men presented with the feathers were not in fact shirking from service. In 1916, hoping to save them further harassment, the Rhodesia Herald and other newspapers began publishing lists of men who had volunteered only to be deemed medically unfit by the army doctors.|$|E

5|$|Even though <b>this</b> <b>campaign</b> is {{overshadowed by}} other {{battles of the}} revolution, {{it was one of}} the most important.
