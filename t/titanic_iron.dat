50|$|Robert {{produced}} some steel here, and some finished tools, {{but more importantly}} he made great progress in his experiments with steel alloys and {{it became clear that}} a new operation would be required to facilitate production. The alloy for which Robert held most aspiration was one using Titanium; so he named the new company The <b>Titanic</b> Steelworks and <b>Iron</b> Works Co. Ltd., known as The Titanic Steelworks. It opened in October 1862, less than 250 yards from the old works of Darkhill. Three hundred men were employed there, but demand for the new alloys, and profits, did not meet expectations. Robert returned to his experiments and in 1868 he invented 'R Mushet's Special Steel' (R.M.S.).|$|R
