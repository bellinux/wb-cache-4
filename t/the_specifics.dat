5|$|The {{mechanism}} by which a polyubiquitinated protein is targeted to the proteasome is not fully understood. Ubiquitin-receptor proteins have an N-terminal ubiquitin-like (UBL) domain and one or more ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domains. The UBL domains are recognized by the 19S proteasome caps and the UBA domains bind ubiquitin via three-helix bundles. These receptor proteins may escort polyubiquitinated proteins to the proteasome, though <b>the</b> <b>specifics</b> of this interaction and its regulation are unclear.|$|E
5|$|At first, Innocent {{took the}} side of the monks, and lifted Pica's excommunication. While the newest appeal was taking place, Pica and a number of his supporters, who had {{traveled}} to Rome to appeal in person, died in Rome in 1200, and some of the monks alleged this was by poison administered on the orders of Savaric. Meanwhile, Innocent had changed his mind, and reinstalled Savaric as abbot, ordering some English clergy to judge <b>the</b> <b>specifics</b> of the case, and allot the revenues of the abbey between Savaric and the monks. Savaric then attempted to secure more control over other monasteries in his diocese, but died before he could set the plans in motion.|$|E

5|$|The topics the Drapier {{addresses}} span from absentee land {{owners to}} importing of goods from Britain to the favouring of Englishmen over Irishmen for Irish governmental positions.

However, these individual issues {{were not as}} important as the independence and unity of Ireland: <b>the</b> <b>specifics</b> of independence were less important than self-rule. Some argue that Swift, after Wood's patent was withdrawn, removed himself from the political landscape to focus on writing Gulliver's Travels, in which he picked up many of the same ideas.|$|E
5|$|After three years, on 15 November 1761, Schmitt {{received}} a commission a Fähnrich (ensign) in Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 15 Pallavicini. During his assignment with this regiment, he saw {{service in the}} last years of the Seven Years' War (1765–1763) in the Bohemian theatre. The lack of accurate maps had hampered the conduct of the Seven Years' War and, in 1764, Schmitt was assigned to a project to improve the map-making capacity of the military. The idea of the scientific soldier, or a soldier educated in <b>the</b> <b>specifics</b> of military operations, led to an investment in the training and education of officers. The development of map making, and Carlos Pallavicini was at the forefront of this movement. On 1 February 1769, after proving himself capable in this assignment, he was promoted to Oberleutnant (Lieutenant) and transferred to the reorganized General-Quartermaster staff.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>specific</b> {{heat of a}} {{material}} is simply {{the measure of the}} amount of energy required to raise the temperature of a unit mass of the material by one degree. <b>The</b> <b>specific</b> heat of {{a material}} depends on the structure, pressure, and temperature of the material. Hence, measurement of specific heat can indicate structural changes and transitions in the material. Previous work at the State University of New York at Buffalo, shored anomalies in <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> heats of Glassy Carbon samples which had been exposed to neutron irradiation. Neutron irradiation of the carbon introduced defects in the material and <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> heat was dependent on the time of sample irradiation. <b>The</b> <b>specific</b> heat plotted as a function of temperature showed peaks at temperatures below 2. 0 °K. This indicates some kind of transition in the material. Also <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> heat values, which were measured up to 4. 5 °K, were much lower than <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> heat of <b>the</b> original nonirradiated material. Measurements indicated that the two kinds of samples had <b>the</b> same <b>specific</b> heat at room temperature. This kind of change in <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> heat of carbon has not been explained. The purpose of this project was to investigate <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> heats of these samples above 4. 50 K to determine where and how the anomalies in <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> heat disappeared at higher temperatures. <b>The</b> <b>specific</b> heats were measured by cooling the sample with liquid helium.

5|$|Both Newt Lee, {{after the}} {{discovery}} of Phagan's body, and the police, just after 4a.m., had unsuccessfully tried to telephone Frank early on Sunday, April 27. The police contacted him later that morning and he agreed to accompany them to the factory. When the police arrived after 7a.m. without telling <b>the</b> <b>specifics</b> of {{what happened at the}} factory, Frank seemed extremely nervous, trembling, and pale; his voice was hoarse, and he was rubbing his hands and asking questions before the police could answer. Frank said he was not familiar with the name Mary Phagan and would need to check his payroll book. The detectives took Frank to the morgue to see Phagan's body and then to the factory, where Frank viewed the crime scene and walked the police through the entire building. Frank returned home about 10:45a.m. At this point, Frank was not considered a suspect.|$|E
5|$|For {{attack and}} defense, the common torpedo can deliver a strong {{electric}} shock {{of up to}} 200 volts. It is a solitary, nocturnal ambush predator that feeds mainly on bony fishes and crustaceans. This species is aplacental viviparous, with the developing embryos nourished by yolk and histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Females produce litters of up to 28 young every year in late summer or autumn, after a gestation period of 4–8 months; <b>the</b> <b>specifics</b> vary between geographical regions. The common torpedo's shock is painful but otherwise of little danger to humans. Its electrogenic properties led it {{to be used in}} medicine by the ancient Greeks and Romans. In modern times, it has no economic value and is mostly discarded when caught as bycatch in fisheries. The impact of fishing on its population is uncertain, and pending more data the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed it as Data Deficient.|$|E
5|$|The {{land that}} would become part of Sully was likely {{controlled}} by several groups before the Doeg claimed the area. English settlers encountered Algonquian language speaking members of the Doeg tribe in modern-day Northern Virginia. The Doeg are most well known for their raid in July 1675 that {{became a part of}} Bacon's Rebellion. English colonists settling in modern Northern Virginia came into conflict with the Doeg from 1661 to 1664. When diplomatic attempts failed, the governor sent the Rappahannock County militia in June 1666. <b>The</b> <b>specifics</b> of that military action are unclear, but later land grants to English settlers are not disputed, suggesting the English gained control of the area. The English presumptively took control after a violent conflict with the Doeg in 1666. Little is recorded about the disposition of this land from the time when the English gained control of it until the land is patented by the Lee family of Virginia.|$|E

5|$|When Kitase was put {{in charge}} of Final Fantasy VII, he and Nomura entirely {{reworked}} the initial plot. Scenario writer Kazushige Nojima joined the team after he had finished his work on Bahamut Lagoon. While Final Fantasy VI adopted a style of making all playable characters equally important, the team soon decided that they needed a central protagonist for Final Fantasy VII. The pursuit of Sephiroth that made up {{a large part of the}} main narrative was suggested by Nomura, as it had not been done in the series before. Kitase and Nojima conceived AVALANCHE and Shinra as opposing organizations, and created Cloud's backstory as well as his relationship to Sephiroth. Among Nojima's biggest contributions to the plot were Cloud's memories and split personality; this included the eventual conclusion involving his newly created character of Zack. The crew helped Kitase adjust <b>the</b> <b>specifics</b> of Sakaguchi's original Lifestream concept.|$|E
5|$|During the 640s, the Muslim {{conquest of}} Syria and Egypt {{created a new}} threat to Byzantium. Not only did the Arabs conquer {{significant}} recruiting and revenue-producing areas, but, after the utility of a strong navy was demonstrated by the short-lived Byzantine recapture of Alexandria in 644, they took to creating a navy of their own. In this effort the new Muslim elite, which came from the inland-oriented {{northern part of the}} Arabian peninsula, largely relied on the resources and manpower of the conquered Levant (especially the Copts of Egypt), which until a few years previously had provided ships and crews for the Byzantines. There is, however, evidence that in the new naval bases in Palestine shipwrights from Persia and Iraq were also employed. The lack of illustrations earlier than the 14th century means that nothing is known about <b>the</b> <b>specifics</b> of the early Muslim warships, although it is usually assumed that their naval efforts drew upon the existing Mediterranean maritime tradition. Given a largely shared nautical nomenclature, and the centuries-long interaction between the two cultures, Byzantine and Arab ships shared many similarities. This similarity also extended to tactics and general fleet organization; translations of Byzantine military manuals were available to the Arab admirals.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{consensus}} on when or where Bundy began killing women. He told different stories to different people, and refused to divulge <b>the</b> <b>specifics</b> of his earliest crimes, even as he confessed in graphic detail to dozens of later murders in the days preceding his execution. He told Nelson that he attempted his first kidnapping in 1969 in Ocean City, New Jersey, but did not kill anyone until sometime in 1971 in Seattle. He told psychologist Art Norman that he killed two women in Atlantic City in 1969 while visiting family in Philadelphia. To homicide detective Robert D. Keppel, he hinted at a murder in Seattle in 1972, and another in 1973 involving a hitchhiker near Tumwater, Washington, but refused to elaborate. Rule and Keppel both believe {{that he may have}} started killing as a teenager. Circumstantial evidence suggests that he abducted and killed 8-year-old Ann Marie Burr of Tacoma in 1961 when he was 14, an allegation he denied repeatedly. His earliest documented homicides were committed in 1974 when he was 27 years old. By then he had (by his own admission) mastered the necessary skills—in the era before DNA profiling—to leave minimal incriminating evidence at a crime scene.|$|E
