5|$|Gentlemen may tither, and tither, and tither, and may <b>think</b> <b>it</b> a bad measure; {{but their}} heads at present are hot, and will so remain till they grow cool again, {{and so they}} can't decide right now, but when the day of {{judgement}} comes then honourable gentlemen will be satisfied with this most excellent union.|$|E
5|$|I had to {{therefore}} {{come up with}} my {{own decisions}} about what this meant and what this character was going through, what was dream and what was reality. My interpretation could end up being completely different, from both David and the audience. But I did have to reconcile all of that, and people seem to <b>think</b> <b>it</b> works.|$|E
5|$|If {{you please}} Sir I am a widow; & I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> very wrong {{that there is}} not any Mrs. Fisher, but I would not marry Mr. Jeremy not for worlds, the way he does live in that house all slippy-sloppy; not any lady would stand it, & not a bit of good {{starching}} his cravats.|$|E

5|$|It must be {{concluded}} that the Tower from Top to Bottom and the adjacent parts are such a heap of deformaties that no Judicious Architect will <b>think</b> <b>it</b> corrigible by any Expense that can be laid out upon new dressing it.|$|E
5|$|And others again, whom God {{had formed}} with mild and gentle dispositions, <b>think</b> <b>it</b> {{necessary}} {{to put a}} force upon their own tempers, by acting a noisy, violent, malicious part, {{as a means to}} be distinguished. Thus hath party got the better of the very genius and constitution of our people; so that whoever reads the character of the English in former ages, will hardly believe their present posterity to be of the same nation or climate.|$|E
5|$|At about midnight EST on February 4th, 2016 Say Anything {{released}} I Don't <b>Think</b> <b>It</b> Is {{without any}} prior announcement besides several teaser posts the day before. The album was co-produced by Bemis and Darren King of Mutemath, who also played drums and percussion. The record was mixed by Will Yip and featured contributions {{by members of}} The Hotelier, Tiny Moving Parts, Eisley, Japanese Breakfast and others.|$|E
5000|$|The song's verse sounds {{similar to}} Tears For Fears' 1982 single [...] "Mad World". Yusuf/Cat made a {{reference}} to this at a concert on his 2016 tour while playing 'Matthew and Son', inserting the lyrics 'I <b>think</b> <b>it’s</b> kind of funny, I <b>think</b> <b>it’s</b> kind of strange, yes I <b>think</b> <b>it’s</b> kind of funny, that this sounds the same!‘.|$|R

5|$|Descartes' famous {{argument}} for this position {{can be summarized}} as follows: Seth has a clear and distinct idea of his mind as a thinking thing that has no spatial extension (i.e., it cannot be {{measured in terms of}} length, weight, height, and so on). He also has a clear and distinct idea of his body as something that is spatially extended, subject to quantification and not able to <b>think.</b> <b>It</b> follows that mind and body are not identical because they have radically different properties.|$|E
5|$|Famitsu writers {{appreciated}} {{the amount of}} freedom the player has. In their reviews of the PlayStation and the Game Boy Advance versions, {{they said that the}} gameplay still holds up. They found the demon fusion system to be excellent and fun, and did not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> felt outdated. Kurt Kalata and Cristopher J. Snelgrove of Hardcore Gaming 101 {{appreciated the}} game's lowered difficulty compared to that of the first Shin Megami Tensei.|$|E
5|$|I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> {{was really}} special to have behind-the-scenes photos, you know, {{pictures}} that the fans haven't seen before, all together {{of a very}} specific moment of my life, an album of my life. They just get {{to see all the}} things that they hadn't seen that were going on behind the scenes; really cool stuff, not typical. They're really fun photos. And even for me, when I look at them, they say so much. Photos really tell a thousand words.|$|E

6000|$|Mr Nadgett {{rubbed his}} hands slowly, stroked his chin, looked round the room, and said, 'Yes, yes, I <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> a good case. I am {{disposed}} to <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> a good case. Will you go into it at once?' ...|$|R
5|$|In some cases, yes, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> has {{in terms}} {{of some of the}} stuff they did in the Middle East {{supporting}} the pro-democracy demonstrators. But a lot of bad things too, unnecessarily harassing people – I would class that as a bad thing. DDOSing the CIA website, stealing customer data and posting it online just for shits and giggles is not a good thing.|$|E
5|$|Lobengula {{refused to}} allow any of the izinDuna to sign the document. Exactly why he did this is not clear. Rudd's {{interpretation}} was that the king considered them to have already been consulted at the day's indaba, and so did not <b>think</b> <b>it</b> necessary for them to also sign. Keppel-Jones comments that Lobengula might have felt {{that it would be}} harder to repudiate the document later if it bore the marks of his izinDuna alongside his own.|$|E
5|$|That's how I {{wanted to}} open the video, because I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> really sets {{up the rest of}} the story. It allows you to imagine you {{yourself}} are not just one person; you're so many. That person has so many stories and memories to draw from, and they all affect your journey profusely. I'm battered quite brutally at the beginning of the video, but at the end, I'm not battered; I'm a bit strange. It's not meant to be an answer video; it's meant to be a profuse number of the question.|$|E

5000|$|The {{song was}} {{composed}} by Tiffany Fred and Paul [...] "Phamous" [...] Shelton. [...] "It's {{a very special}} song. I <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> very different and unexpected for me because I feel like it's on a higher level production wise," [...] Zendaya {{said in an interview}} with Radio Disney: [...] "It's one of those songs that's creating its own lane or genre. I don't <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> pop, I don't <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> hip hop, I don't <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> R&B. I don't even know where you would consider it because it kind of mixes that pop sound beat with a very R&B kind of melody". Zendaya describes the single as not basic pop music, but having an urban twist to it.|$|R
5|$|The body {{is divided}} into coeloms, {{compartments}} lined with mesothelium. The main body cavity, {{under the crown of}} tentacles, is called the metacoelom, and the tentacles and their base share the mesocoelom. Above the mouth is the epistome, a hollow lid which can close the mouth. The cavity in the epistome is sometimes called the protocoelom, although other authors disagree that it is a coelom and Ruppert, Fox and Barnes <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is built by a different process.|$|E
5|$|The rest of {{this edition}} I have not read, but, from the little that I have seen, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> not {{dangerous}} to declare that, in my opinion, its pomp recommends it more than its accuracy. There is no distinction made between the ancient reading, and the innovations of the editor; {{there is no reason}} given for any of the alterations which are made; the emendations of former editions are adopted without any acknowledgement, and few of the difficulties are removed which have hitherto embarrassed the readers of Shakespeare.|$|E
5|$|There's {{something}} special about that first single, we were never quite able to recapture that sound. I don't {{know if it was}} the guitars or the recording. It was just a really gnarly, gnarly guitar sound. We've gotten some since, but they've been a different kind. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> {{had more to do with}} the actual electromagnetic chemistry of what was going through our amps that day. It was just a cool, fried-out sound.|$|E
5000|$|I {{was looking}} for gear that was djenty. I was like: ‘Are these pickups djenty?’ For some reason it caught on, but {{completely}} in the wrong way, because people <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> a style of music and they <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> a style of music I play.|$|R

5|$|Writing in the Handbook of Texas, {{historian}} Thomas Ricks Lindley {{maintains that}} the Wagner cannon does not match the Smithwick account. The Wagner gun is made of iron and is smaller than a six-pounder. Historians such as Lindley <b>think</b> <b>it</b> {{more likely that the}} Gonzales cannon was taken to San Antonio de Béxar, where it was used during the Battle of the Alamo and captured by Mexican troops in March 1836. It was likely melted down with many of the other cannons when the Mexican army retreated.|$|E
25|$|If {{we accept}} {{the fact that they were}} above the Second Step, they would have seemed to be {{incredibly}} close to the summit of Everest and I think at that stage something takes hold of most climbers... And I think therefore taking all those circumstances in view... I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is quite conceivable that they did go for the summit... I certainly would love to think that they actually reached the summit of Everest. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is a lovely thought and I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is something, you know, gut emotion, yes I would love them to have got there. Whether they did or not, I think that is something one just cannot know.|$|E

I <b>think</b> <b>it’s</b> absolutely ridiculous, but once again, I <b>think</b> <b>it’s</b> kind of the way our country has gone. We want more, but we want to do less.
