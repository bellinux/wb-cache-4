5|$|Gary Steinman of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine {{said that}} the lack of a plotline gave the player no {{incentive}} <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>playing</b> through what he felt was a poor combat system. Both of those criticisms were repeated by Electronic Gaming Monthlys Sam Kennedy in his review. RPGamer's Bilyk felt that the smaller plots, while sometimes simplistic and not focused on the player, were enjoyable experiences. IGN's Smith concluded that while he enjoyed the game, he felt {{that it was not a}} complete game like Secret of Mana, but instead a collection of fun experiences.|$|E
5|$|Before the season, Juventus manager Claudio Ranieri {{remarked that}} Del Piero would have {{as good a}} season, or an even better one, than the {{previous}} term. In August 2008, Del Piero {{announced that he would}} try <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>playing</b> professional football with Juventus until he turned 40. Juventus were drawn into the same Champions League group as Real Madrid, and UEFA Cup winners Zenit Saint Petersburg. Del Piero marked Juventus's return to the competition with a match-winning free kick to seal a home win against Zenit. On 21 October, Del Piero netted a notable goal as Juventus defeated Real Madrid 2–1 in Turin, scoring with a first-time, curling strike from distance, in the fifth minute of play.|$|E
5|$|To {{give each}} world a theme, they were each {{designed}} {{with a particular}} gameplay element in mind. This approach created a structure where players would be introduced to new gameplay mechanics frequently. The intention {{was to keep the}} game engaging and continually expand the depth of gameplay as players progressed through the game. The first stage of each world is designed to be a simple puzzle that teaches players the new mechanic. Initially, the development team were creating large stages that would take a fairly long time to complete. However, they later decided that players should be able to complete them quicker, and thus the level structure was changed and the amount of content per stage was reduced. Story elements were also added to encourage players <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>playing.</b> Creating an intuitive and easy control scheme was an important factor as the development team wanted to ensure that the action of creating boxes was comfortable and fun. The development team had considered implementing a multiplayer mode for BoxBoy!. Utimately, the feature was excluded as they believed that making a fun single-player experience should be the priority.|$|E
5000|$|The XFL {{imposed a}} number of {{restrictions}} on punting that are not present in most other leagues' rules, {{the net effect of}} which made punts in the XFL operate under rules more akin to kickoffs. The purpose of these provisions was <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>play</b> going after the ball was punted, encouraging the kicking team to make the ball playable and the receiving team to run it back. To this effect: ...|$|R

25|$|An early {{variation}} of tic-tac-toe was {{played in the}} Roman Empire, around the first century BC. It was called terni lapilli (three pebbles at a time) and instead of having any number of pieces, each player only had three, thus they had to move them around to empty spaces <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>playing.</b> The game's grid markings have been found chalked all over Rome.|$|E
25|$|Cartman gathers all {{the boys}} of South Park and convinces them all to log in {{at the same time}} in order to execute a massive retaliatory attack on the griefer. However, once the battle begins, the griefer summons giant {{scorpions}} and easily dispatches the boys' characters. Cartman convinces Stan, Kyle, and Kenny <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>playing.</b> For the next two months, the boys play the game for 21 hours a day, killing low-level boars in the game's forests to gain experience points. In the process, the boys become lazy, long-haired, obese and acne-ridden. The boys' characters grow so quickly that the Blizzard executives, who have also been monitoring the griefer, take notice.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{variations}} of the game, such as trying <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> the feathercock in the air until an agreed target of kicks (e.g. 100) is reached, either alone or in a pair. In circle play, the aim may be simply <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>play</b> going. In {{all but the most}} competitive formats, a skillful display is a key component of play.There are 2 informal games in Chinese JJJ games using the same middle net: [...] "Team game" [...] having 3 players on each side & [...] "Half court game" [...] using just a half court for double player game only.|$|R

25|$|Having just {{broken into}} the South Australian cricket team, Pyke opted <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>playing</b> cricket and {{appeared}} in eight of their 10 matches in the 1986/87 Shield season. He {{was also a}} member of South Australia's McDonald's Cup winning side that summer {{and at the end of}} the season joined the team in a tour of New Zealand. In the second List A fixture against the Ian Smith led Central Districts, at Fitzherbert Park in Palmerston North, Pyke scored 177 off 159 balls with five sixes. This bettered his previous best limited overs score of just 19 and set a record for the highest individual innings for a List A match in New Zealand. The record remained until 2007, when Matthew Hayden scored an unbeaten 181 in a One Day International. It was the highest limited overs score by a South Australian until 2015.|$|E

And if the NFL is there for me, then I hope that I'll get <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>playing,</b> because I love to play this game. Hopefully, it will work out." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 1, 2011 Sucker Punch {{announced}} a mission creation feature for Infamous 2 {{that had been}} in development since 2009. A limited beta for testing this feature was released in April 2011. Sucker Punch wanted to give players a way to continue enjoying the game after completing it and felt there was immense pressure to incorporate multiplayer and that many games were tacking it on. They considered cooperative gameplay, though found it did not make for an experience you wanted <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>playing,</b> saying [...] "ultimately, the game still ends." ...|$|E

He {{appreciated}} the shows on {{the first leg of}} the tour, where they played the entire 20-song The River album in sequence, because [...] "when you play something night after night you really get to dig into the material, just as an instrumentalist." [...] He attributed his ability <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>playing</b> during some of the longest shows in E Street Band history to his keeping in top physical condition, including exercise by swimming, and to his love of playing with Springsteen.|$|E
500|$|Keenor {{joined the}} 17th Middlesex Battalion, which {{became known as}} the Football Battalion due to the large number of footballers that made up the core of the unit, led by Frank Buckley. Stationed in London with the regiment, Keenor would travel by train every weekend to the site of each Cardiff fixture in order <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>playing</b> for the team and would be listed in the matchday {{programme}} as [...] "Private Keenor" [...] {{for the remainder of the}} season as Cardiff finished third in the First Division of the Southern Football League. He made 21 appearances in the league during the season, scoring two goals. With the war escalating, the Football Association officially suspended all of its competitions at the end of the 1914–15 season.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked why}} the {{mechanism}} of unlocking maps and characters - accomplished in previous titles by purchasing them with points or coins won through battle - was removed, the developers apologized, commenting that after long deliberation, they felt that such a mechanic was detrimental to the enjoyment of gamers who are too busy {{to take the time}} to unlock all of these things. As a result, they designed this game in a way that allowed players to play any non-story based map they wanted, introducing other mechanics to encourage players <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>playing.</b> The developers commented that Days of Ruin had more strategy than previous entries in the series due to the changes and removals made to the game compared to the other titles.|$|E

50|$|Two {{specific}} rules were created <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>play</b> moving. The first {{was that a}} player in their own defensive half was not permitted to kick the ball directly over the boards out of play. Doing so {{would result in a}} two-minute penalty for delay of game. The second allowed the goalie to clear the ball only by throwing the ball to teammates within the defensive half of the field. Kicking the ball to clear it or throwing the ball to a teammate beyond midfield would result in an indirect free kick from the spot of the illegal pass.|$|R

500|$|In one of {{the early}} matches of the 1889 {{football}} season, Wilson was best on ground in Launceston's win against City. It was reported in June 1889 by The Colonist that Wilson had moved to Hobart and was likely to join Railway Football Club in the Southern Tasmanian Football Association (STFA). However, before completing the move, Wilson changed his mind and elected <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>playing</b> for Launceston. When Victorian Football Association (VFA) side South Melbourne toured in July, Wilson represented the NTFA against them—he was named {{one of the}} local side's better players in a six-goal loss.

500|$|The story {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews.

Eurogamer's Simon Parkin cited the story as being very good, though he found Nowe [...] "a little nauseating to watch as the weighty, dark (and pretty good) plot unfolds", and VideoGamer.com's Adam Jarvis called the story [...] "one of the highlights of the package". The 1UP reviewer called the [...] "clear undercurrent of [...] "maybe the good guys are the bad guys,"" [...] {{one of the main reasons}} <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>playing</b> the game.

500|$|What was not {{publicly}} known {{during the regular}} season and playoffs was that Smith had torn his rotator cuff after suffering an impingement in his right shoulder during the July 11–14 homestand against the Padres.

There are going to be different sides of him that you're going to get to see."
