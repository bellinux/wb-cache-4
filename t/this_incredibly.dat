25|$|Bedouin girls face {{additional}} {{obstacles to}} their education. Among {{the biggest problems}} {{is the nature of}} the schools. Most Bedouin schools are co-ed, meaning that boys and girls study together. For many families (especially the more traditional ones), this is unacceptable, particularly because of the presence of boys from other tribes. The drop out rate for Bedouin girls is much higher than that of Bedouin boys (85% vs. 71%, respectively). The fact that boys and girls study together is arguably a driving force behind <b>this</b> <b>incredibly</b> high rate. A study conducted by Abu-Rabia-Queder found that the most important factor in whether girls remained in schools was the decision of her father. In other words, if the girl’s father did not agree with her education, there was little chance of her remaining in school. Generally, men who were themselves educated and/or employed were much more likely to support their daughters' educations. However, of the fathers surveyed by the study, none approved of coeducation. Those who disapproved most strongly were more likely to pull their daughters out of school, even if they recognized the benefits education could bring for their daughters.|$|E

AllMusic's Fred Thomas {{in his review}} of PBX Funicular Intaglio Zone stated: [...] "The ever-winding path of John Frusciante's solo career is a confusing one to say the least. [...] The thing is, there's no doubt that Frusciante is sincere in his expression with <b>this</b> <b>incredibly</b> warped music. There's no easy explanation for these sounds, no context {{for a lot of}} the choices he makes with the rapid-fire style changes and jarring production choices that come one after another after another on almost every song here." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} of Walter goes through much development {{during the first}} season. Stuart believed that he changes {{the most out of}} the main cast, and his return to St. Claire's reflects this progression. Actor John Noble explained his character's evolution in a November 2008 interview, [...] "We see Walter from a different angle, very vulnerable. He goes back to the asylum again, and we see the very, very fearful man return for a while. Although he does have some wonderful moments earlier in the episode, when he goes back inside he turns into <b>this</b> <b>incredibly</b> fearful, stuttering fellow that we saw when we first met him.

Fellowes chose not to end the film at Albert's death because he was wary of copying [...] "the horror of biopics," [...] where there is simply an important event after important event. Believing it had been done before and that the audience was already familiar with that part of Victoria's history, {{he thought it would be}} better suited for a television series or for another film.|$|E

She stated, [...] "But it was always sort of built in that the peak of 'Diwali' would be <b>this</b> <b>incredibly</b> romantic overture [...]" [...] Kaling was pleased that much of [...] "Diwali" [...] took place at Stamford, especially as she was able to explore the contrasts between the two offices.

Deccan Chronicle rated it 3.5/5 and cited: [...] "Thuppaki has come out as an action thriller that depends on mind games and smart plans rather than bloody fights. This is Murugados's film in its true sense and Vijay adds immense value to it by his performance".

500|$|The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie was long-planned; Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures had {{approached}} series creator Stephen Hillenburg {{for a film}} based on the show, but he refused {{for more than a}} year. Hillenburg was concerned, after watching The Iron Giant and Toy Story with his sons, about the challenge of SpongeBob and Patrick doing something more cinematically-consequential and inspiring without losing what he calls the SpongeBob [...] "cadence." [...] He said, on a break from season-four post-production, [...] "To do a 75-minute movie about SpongeBob wanting to make some jellyfish jelly would be a mistake, I think This had to be SpongeBob in a great adventure.

[...] Essayist Amy Britton interpreted the artwork as an allusion to the Bush administration's [...] "road map for peace" [...] plan for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

500|$|... "Battle of the Bastards" [...] {{was written}} by the series' creators, David Benioff and D. B. Weiss.

Martin hoped to {{complete}} before the sixth season aired. In an [...] "Inside the Episode" [...] segment published by HBO shortly after the episode aired, Benioff and Weiss said that the final battle was primarily inspired by the Battle of Cannae and the American Civil War. According to Weiss, [...] "We went back to the Roman fight against the Carthaginians in the Battle of Cannae where the Romans got caught in an encirclement by Hannibal and just slaughtered to the man. We used that as our model". Benioff said, [...] "The 'Battle of the Bastards' becomes incredibly compact. All these men, all these combatants, crammed into <b>this</b> <b>incredibly</b> tight space on the battlefield. You read accounts of the battles in the Civil War where the bodies were piled so thick it was actually an obstruction on the battlefield".

Scott has said: [...] "Let’s face facts: [...] Victor and Nikki will always be a huge dynamic, they’ve been in a circular cycle for over 30 years! [...] Finding a new leading man that you have chemistry with is like finding gold." [...] In a 1994 interview with The Los Angeles Times, the newspaper reported that Victor's relationship with Nikki had [...] "registered an enduring appeal among viewers", with Braeden replying that, [...] "Arguably, it's the idea of <b>this</b> <b>incredibly</b> powerful, wealthy man taking a woman who comes from {{the wrong side of the}} tracks into his life, and shaping her and forming her more to his liking. But, of course, no one can shape or form anyone, she remains who she is, has retained her strength, and that causes conflict." [...] In other interviews, Braeden stated that he loves working with Scott and that he [...] "always thought it was an honestly felt love story with great material for conflict with Nikki". He also stated in an interview that he considers Victor's storylines with Nikki to be some of his favorites. Discussing Victor and Nikki's union, former As the World Turns actress Martha Byrne stated: [...] "Young and Restless Victor and Nikki are the perfect example of a couple who they can tear apart and put back together how many times? And [...] do it really well because they're so stable as characters that you can basically do anything with them now, and the audience will go on the journey with them." [...] The Museum of Television and Radio wrote: [...] "Combined with a series of social-issue storylines covering everything from AIDS to date rape to the plight of the elderly, as well as featuring a group of popular young African-American characters, and several long-term romantic and professional relationships, Victor and Nikki's love story has kept viewers enthralled for many years." [...] They also described their relationship as being a [...] "dominant force" [...] in the soap opera. Daytime journalist Michael Fairman stated: [...] "Victor and Nikki just can’t, we mean can’t, ever get it together long enough to find any happiness with each other. So, many would say that they deserve each other and the baggage and betrayals that come along with their co-dependent relationship." ...|$|E
