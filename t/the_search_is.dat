5|$|Supernova {{searches}} {{fall into}} two classes: those focused on relatively nearby events and those looking farther away. Because of {{the expansion of the}} universe, the distance to a remote object with a known emission spectrum can be estimated by measuring its Doppler shift (or redshift); on average, more-distant objects recede with greater velocity than those nearby, and so have a higher redshift. Thus <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>is</b> split between high redshift and low redshift, with the boundary falling around a redshift range of z=0.1–0.3—where z is a dimensionless measure of the spectrum's frequency shift.|$|E

30|$|Scientific {{articles}} were obtained using electronic databases including Science Direct, Cinahl, Springer Link, Medline, Web of Science, and Pubmed. <b>The</b> <b>search</b> <b>was</b> performed in <b>the</b> month of December 2015.

5|$|Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) and Ethan Gross (Geoffrey Arend) {{begin to}} believe that Noah is being held by fresh water, so <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>is</b> narrowed. Bud is also cleared of {{voluntary}} manslaughter, and him, Curtis, Megan and Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan) suspect that the kidnapping may be an inside job, meaning that someone close to Noah kidnapped him. Bud checks his parents, Tom (Stephen Barker Turner) and Jennifer (Keira Naughton) {{but they are not}} the culprits. They then find that Helen's friend, Jason's girlfriend, Rena Talbot (Wrenn Schmidt) looked after Noah whilst Helen was on taking care of her boyfriend Oscar Mendez who had been injured badly in a fight. They find Rena, and result in finding Noah, who is sick but alive, and is reunited with his parents. Whilst Rena is arrested, Derek asks Megan to have a ride on her motorbike, to which she rejects and instead goes to see Joan, having a conversation about her father.|$|E

25|$|However, even if {{valid consent}} to a search {{has been given}} it does not {{automatically}} make the search reasonable. A lack of entitlement to conduct the search or {{the manner in which}} <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>is</b> conducted may still make the search unreasonable under s21.|$|E

50|$|Sills {{was criticized}} by {{civil rights groups}} for {{defending}} a warrantless search for stolen guns by 300 heavily armed New Jersey State Police and National Guardsmen during the 1967 Plainfield riots. <b>The</b> <b>search</b> <b>was</b> carried out without warrant sunder a declaration of emergency by Governor Hughes. <b>The</b> <b>search</b> <b>was</b> called off when residents protested that their homes were being damages.|$|R
25|$|The Talmud in Pesahim (p.2a) {{derives from}} the Torah that the search for chametz be {{conducted}} {{by the light of}} a candle and therefore is done at night, and although the final destruction of the chametz (usually by burning it in a small bonfire) is done on the next morning, the blessing is made at night because <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>is</b> both in preparation for and part of the commandments to remove and destroy all chametz from one's possession.|$|E
25|$|The Windows Vista Instant Search index {{can also}} be {{accessed}} programmatically using both managed as well as native code. Native code connects to the index catalog by using a Data Source Object retrieved from Windows Vista shell's Indexing Service OLE DB provider. Managed code use the MSIDXS ADO.NET provider with the index catalog name. A catalog on a remote machine {{can also be}} specified using a UNC path. The criteria for <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>is</b> specified using a SQL-like syntax.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the wide}} variety of {{mutations}} leading to TSC, no simple genetic tests are available to identify new cases, nor are any biochemical markers known for the gene defects. However, once a person has been clinically diagnosed, the genetic mutation can usually be found. <b>The</b> <b>search</b> <b>is</b> time-consuming and has a 15% failure rate, which is thought to be due to somatic mosaicism. If successful, this information can be used to identify affected family members, including prenatal diagnosis. , preimplantation diagnosis is not widely available.|$|E

25|$|There is {{also the}} ability to save {{searches}} as a Search Folder where opening the folder will execute a specific search automatically and display the results as a normal folder. A search folder is just an XML file which stores the search query, including the search operators as well. When these files are accessed, <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>is</b> run with the saved query string and the results presented as a virtual folder. Windows Vista also supports query composition, where a saved search (called a scope) can be nested within the query string of another search.|$|E
25|$|Ryder's {{first stop}} on <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>is</b> Eos, a desert planet plagued by radiation, where Nakmor Drack and Pelessaria B'Sayle (Peebee) join the crew. With SAM's help, Ryder unlocks a Remnant vault, which houses a {{terraforming}} system that gradually repairs the planet's ecosystem to more hospitable levels. The planet's newly-improved viability allows Ryder to establish Andromeda's first successful outpost. Ryder also discovers a star chart pinpointing {{the location of}} other worlds that might hold similar structures. It is deduced that these worlds could sustain the Initiative.|$|E
25|$|Windows Search is the indexed search {{platform}} in Windows Vista, Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008, {{and offers a}} superset of the features provided by Windows Desktop Search, while being API compatible with it. Unlike WDS, it can seamlessly search indexed as well as non-indexed locations – for indexed locations the index is used and for non-indexed locations, the property handlers and IFilters are invoked on the fly as <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>is</b> being performed. This allows for more consistent results, though {{at the cost of}} searching speed over non-indexed locations. Windows Search uses Group Policy for centralized management.|$|E
5000|$|... 1940: <b>The</b> <b>search</b> <b>was</b> {{expanded}} systematically by H.S.M. Coxeter in his publication Regular and Semi-Regular Polytopes.|$|R
5000|$|Search efforts, {{including}} a separate <b>search</b> by <b>the</b> Green Berets found no trace. Heavy rains during <b>the</b> first day's <b>search</b> hampered efforts, [...] and heavy mist the next day. Footprints {{were found in}} the area, but dismissed as being his. A shoe and sock were also found. More than a thousand searchers continued to look until June 26, when <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>was</b> cut back. <b>The</b> <b>search</b> <b>was</b> abandoned on June 29, after a last search.The <b>search</b> <b>was</b> officially closed down on September 14.|$|R
50|$|By 19 January <b>the</b> <b>search</b> had <b>been</b> broadened {{to an area}} of 55000 sq mi {{southwest}} of Bermuda. USAF Major Keith Cloe, who had been put in charge, said that <b>the</b> <b>search</b> would <b>be</b> continued until 22 January and extended if any reports of debris <b>were</b> received. <b>The</b> <b>search</b> <b>was</b> finally abandoned on 23 January, with aircraft from Kindley Field having flown over 1000000 mi. No sign of debris, oil slicks or wreckage had been found.|$|R
25|$|If {{a search}} or seizure is {{unlawful}} under the Search and Surveillance Act 2012 {{then it is}} also likely to be considered an unreasonable search or seizure. However, the concepts of unlawfulness and unreasonableness are independent and it is therefore possible that, for example, a lawful search can be unreasonable. Despite this, the courts have said that in terms of the most common remedy of exclusion of evidence an unlawful search should usually be considered an unreasonable search. Elias CJ {{went so far as to}} say that unlawful searches should automatically be unreasonable. An exception is that where <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>is</b> only unlawful on minor or technical grounds it may still be reasonable.|$|E
25|$|Alpha–beta search can be {{made even}} faster by {{considering}} only a narrow search window (generally determined by guesswork based on experience). This is known as aspiration search. In the extreme case, <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>is</b> performed with alpha and beta equal; a technique known as zero-window search, null-window search, or scout search. This is particularly useful for win/loss searches {{near the end of}} a game where the extra depth gained from the narrow window and a simple win/loss evaluation function may lead to a conclusive result. If an aspiration search fails, it is straightforward to detect whether it failed high (high edge of window was too low) or low (lower edge of window was too high). This gives information about what window values might be useful in a re-search of the position.|$|E
500|$|Although the Fourth Amendment {{generally}} prohibits unreasonable {{searches and}} seizures, the Supreme Court of the United States has clarified that searches and seizures are not unreasonable when citizens consent to them. Scholars have traced {{the origins of}} the Consent to Search Doctrine {{as far back as the}} 1920s, but it was not until the 1970s that the Court clarified that searches are reasonable if, under a [...] "totality of the circumstances", <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>is</b> [...] "voluntary". Courts generally look to whether officers believed, at the time of the search, the individual being searched provided voluntary consent. Officers may also rely on the consent of someone who reasonably appears to have authority to consent to a police search, even if that person actually has no such authority. However, if officers obtain consent after engaging in an unconstitutional seizure, the consent is considered [...] "tainted" [...] and evidence obtained from such a search cannot be admitted during a subsequent criminal prosecution.|$|E
30|$|As {{the answer}} to our {{question}} {{could not be found}} from a systematic review of the diagnostic test accuracy literature, we searched Medline and Embase using <b>the</b> same <b>search</b> terms for primary studies. In Medline, <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>was</b> limited to 2004 – 2009 and we used the clinical query ‘Diagnosis–Best Balance’ to identify studies of diagnostic accuracy. In Embase, <b>the</b> <b>search</b> <b>was</b> combined with <b>the</b> following terms: (Sensitivity or Specificity or Diagnostic Accuracy).|$|R
