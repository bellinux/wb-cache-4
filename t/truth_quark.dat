40|$|Scientists are {{imprisoned by}} Golden Bars of Consensus, says Burton Richter (hep-ex/ 0001012). A {{case in point}} is the mass of the <b>Truth</b> <b>Quark.</b> The {{consensus}} analysis of the experimental data indicates that the mass of the <b>Truth</b> <b>Quark</b> is about 170 GeV. On the other hand, an alternative analysis of the same data indicates that the mass of the <b>Truth</b> <b>Quark</b> is about 130 GeV. If the design of future experiments, including trigger, event selection, data analysis procedures, error analysis, etc., takes into account only the consensus value, and if the consensus value happens to be incorrect, then results of future experiments might be compromised.

40|$|A 130 GeV mass is {{calculated}} for the t-quark, also called the <b>truth</b> <b>quark</b> or the top quark. The 130 GeV T-quark mass {{is consistent with the}} analysis of Dalitz and Goldstein (131 GeV (- 11, + 22)) of a CDF T-quark candidate event [1]. It is not consistent with the theoretical calculations of Dimopoulos, Hall, and Raby that the T-quark mass range should be 176 to 190 GeV [2]. The calculation uses a model in which the 28 -dimensional adjoint representation of Spin(8) forms the gauge group of the model with an 8 -dimensional spacetime whose tangent vector space is represented by the vector representation of Spin(8); the first generation fermion particles and antiparticles are represented by the two mirror image 8 -dimensional half-spinor representations of Spin(8). The 8 -dimensional spacetime of the model is reduced to 4 dimensions. Dimensional reduction gives the fermions a 3 -generation structure. At request, I added a chronology including work of others.

Microfiche. xvi, 160 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmAn optimized {{search for}} the top (or <b>truth)</b> <b>quark</b> is performed in tt̄ → μ+ jet events produced by pp̄ collisions with √s= 1. 8 TeV at the Fermilab Tevatron and observed with the DØ detector. The data set analyzed is identical to that used by the DØ Collaboration in its reported discovery of the top quark which engaged other decay channels as well. Four events are observed with an expected background' of 1. 40 ± 0. 71 events. The probability for an upward fluctuation of the background to produce the observed number of events is 0. 081 (equivalent to 1. 7 standard deviations). An analysis for the top quark mass is carried out based {{on the amount of}} jet activity transverse to the pp̄ beam direction. The resultant top quark mass value is measured to be 185 (+ 16) (- 26) (stat.) (+ 6) (- 8) (syst.) GeV/c^ 2 with a corresponding production cross section of 5. 3 ± 4. 4 pb...|$|E
