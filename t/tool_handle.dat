5000|$|Wheels {{sometimes}} need replacing. The grinder is unplugged, {{and then}} the outer guard is removed. Typically a large nut holds the wheel on the arbor. The handedness (sense) of each nut is assigned to avoid any loosening tendency during grinder use. Thus on a typical grinder the nut is left-handed {{on the left side}} of the grinder from the operator's viewpoint, with wheel rotation [...] "toward" [...] the operator (if the wheel could travel), whereas on the other side the nut is right-handed. [...] "In other words, to remove the nut, it must be turned in the direction that the spindle revolves when the wheel is in operation." [...] Holding the wheel against the wrench's turning action is difficult, but usually the wrench is gently tapped with a hammer instead, which neatly taps the nut loose. A large steel flange is on either side of the wheel, then a paper washer (blotter), then the wheel. The paper is conventionally held to be absolutely necessary to prevent the steel flange from bearing directly against the wheel and tending to crack it; trained workers are expected to know and obey this rule. Thus the entire contact area between flange and wheel is covered, either with paper or with compressible coating (rubber or gasket) on the flange. The wheel's inner diameter may meet the arbor precisely or may be larger with a bushing (sleeve) to reduce it. Before the new wheel is mounted it is ring tested, which involves gently tapping it with a fingernail or <b>tool</b> <b>handle</b> (wood or plastic) to hear its high-pitched ring (comparable to a bell's ring, although not loud), indicating that it is not cracked. It is rung in various spots to be sure. A [...] "flat" [...] or [...] "hoarse" [...] sound (failing to [...] "sing") indicates a crack. With the wheel having passed the ring test, the bushing (if any), wheel, paper blotters, steel flanges, and nut are assembled, and the nut is tightened, not as hard as possible, but enough to be firmly fastened in place. The guard is reinstalled, {{and then the}} grinder can be plugged in again. Dressing may be needed afterward. When the wheel is first started, the operator stands a bit off center, so that if it were to explode, less pathway for injury exists.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to design and test a {{mechanical}} DC torque tool testing rig that is capable of simulating dynamic response of the human arm under a torque impulse. The mechanical simulation of the human arm response is based on a nonlinear model derived from human subject testing. The testing rig, which uses both tension and compression springs to provide a bilinear stiffness rate to resist the motion of the torque <b>tool</b> <b>handle,</b> is used to analyze the <b>tool</b> <b>handle</b> angular displacement and reaction force, which has been strongly linked in previous studies to operator discomfort and injury. The mechanical simulation of the human arm response was tested under a number of different conditions, and compared to an analytical nonlinear model. The results showed that the mechanical simulation consistently underestimated the <b>tool</b> <b>handle</b> displacement by up to 16. 2 % when compared to the nonlinear model predictions. The discrepancy in handle displacement between the nonlinear model and mechanical simulation is likely due the coulomb friction not being included in the nonlinear model.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{whether the}} perceived roughness {{of the end}} of a tool is influenced by the texture of the handle used to hold it. Participants rated the roughness of the ends (caps) of a series of tools by rubbing them along their forearm, and indicated the perceived roughness of the tool's cap by means of an anchored visual scale. The caps of the tools had one of eight different levels of roughness varying from very smooth (sample 1) to very rough (sample 8). The participants held the <b>tool</b> <b>handle</b> in one hand while rubbing the cap of the tool against their contralateral forearm. The <b>tool</b> <b>handle</b> was either smooth (similar in smoothness to sample 1) or else very rough (matched in roughness to sample 8). Overall, participants were remarkably good at ignoring the roughness of the tool's handle when discriminating the roughness of the tool's cap. Nevertheless, the roughness of the <b>tool</b> <b>handle</b> was shown to modulate roughness judgments concerning the tool cap under certain conditions: in particular, tool caps at the rougher end of the scale (6 and 7) were rated as being significantly less rough when the participants held tools with a rough handle than when they held tools with a smooth handle.

40|$|Tool {{manufacturers}} {{continue to}} incorporate new designs {{to the internal}} mechanism of tools in order to decrease the vibration that is delivered to the hand during operation. Modification of some tools to minimize tool vibration is not easily resolved through internal tool design. For this reason, vibration damping materials applied between the tool and the hand are a simple alternative. The damping materials may {{be applied to the}} area of the tool directly contacted by the operator or in a glove containing a vibration absorbing pad. These interventions are developed specifically to damp vibration but are not necessarily produced and tested under the same work conditions that a company may expose their workers. Therefore, it is important to test the value of the proposed interventions for the specific applications. This study evaluates the effectiveness of anti-vibration interventions currently in use at a local manufacturing company. Methods The design of this study evaluates the vibration energy produced at the <b>tool</b> <b>handle</b> and {{from the back of the}} operator 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s hand. Each operator performed a series of fastener installations in metal using several interventions and one series with no intervention as a control. Four of the interventions were gloves containing anti-vibration material and the fifth intervention was an anti-vibration material wrapped around the <b>tool</b> <b>handle.</b> The protocol for wrapping the <b>tool</b> <b>handle</b> was developed and is part of the equipment procedure at this manufacturing company. Test conditions mimicked production work conditions including similar materials, fasteners and technique for installation. Vibration values were collected using 3 tri-axial accelerometers with one firmly glued to the <b>tool</b> <b>handle</b> close the hand grip as recommended by ISO 5349. A second accelerometer was placed on the top of the pistol shaped tool. The third accelerometer was attached to the back of the hand close to the third knuckle using double sided tape. Results Preliminary results for 3 volunteers show a difference between the vibration values of the control condition (mean hand vibration on bare hand = 1. 77 Gs) compared to all of the interventions (p=. 0001 using Mixed Procedure, Tests of Fixed Effects). The graph below shows individual trials for each subject for each condition. Glove 3 with the air bladder insert shows large variability between subjects (Range = 0. 84 - 3. 33 Gs).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a prototype anthropomorphic kinesthetic telepresence {{system that is}} being developed at JPL. It utilizes dexterous terminus devices {{in the form of}} an exoskeleton force-sensing master glove worn by the operator and a replica four finger anthropomorphic slave hand. The newly developed master glove is integrated with our previously developed non-anthropomorphic six degree of freedom (DOF) universal force-reflecting hand controller (FRHC). The mechanical hand and forearm are mounted to an industrial robot (PUMA 560), replacing its standard forearm. The notion of 'terminus control mode' refers to the fact that only the terminus devices (glove and robot hand) are of anthropomorphic nature, and the master and slave arms are non-anthropomorphic.

40|$|Exposure to hand-transmitted {{vibration}} (HTV) {{arising from}} operating hand-held power tools {{has been associated}} with various health consequences. The magnitude of HTV is strongly affected by the hand-handle interface coupling forces, handle geometry and gripping method apart. Assessment of the HTV exposure currently does not incorporate the impact of coupling forces exerted at the hand-handle interface, mostly due to lack of reliable measurement methods for hand-handle interface forces. This dissertation seeks to develop a low cost hand-handle coupling force measurement system and methods for quantifying the hand grip and push forces applied to the tool handles. A hand-handle interface force measurement system was developed using flexible force sensing resistors (FlexiForce). The static properties of the sensors were thoroughly characterized in terms of linearity, hysteresis and repeatability. Moreover, the sensors’ output characteristics were observed by considering the effect of positioning, area and flexibility of the loading medium used to transmit the applied forces. Five different cylindrical and elliptical instrumented handles were subsequently chosen to observe the input-output characteristics of the sensors under stationary and vibrating conditions. The measurements under static and dynamic conditions revealed good linearity and repeatability of the sensors, and affirmed their feasibility for accurate estimations of the hand grip and push forces. The sensors’ outputs also showed strong dependence on the loading medium’s area, position and flexibility as well as the length of the sensor suggesting the need for individual sensor calibration, which was noted as the primary limitation of the system. The effectiveness of the measurement system was further explored through measurements of hand forces on a percussion <b>tool</b> <b>handle</b> and biodynamic responses of the human hand-arm system. The measurement system provided reasonably good estimations of the hand grip and push forces when applied to the percussion <b>tool</b> <b>handle</b> under both stationary as well as vibration conditions. The biodynamic impedance responses measured with six subjects showed trends similar to the reference response. However, a compensation function was necessary and subsequently proposed to account for the limited bandwidth of the sensors. ...|$|E

Magnetic levitation haptic interaction was previously demonstrated using a fine motion robot wrist. A new magnetic levitation device was then designed specifically to address the requirements of realistic tool-based haptic interaction. A hemispherical device shape was adopted to maximize the ranges of translation and rotation and the ratio of actuator surface area to the levitated mass while enabling the user to grip a <b>tool</b> <b>handle</b> at the hemisphere center, {{near the center of}} mass, where translation, rotation, force, and torque ranges are the same [...] ...|$|E

40|$|When we send {{humans to}} search for life on other planets, we'll {{need to know what}} we brought with us versus what may already be there. To ensure our crewed systems meet {{planetary}} protection requirements-and to protect our science from human contamination-we'll need to assess whether microorganisms may be leaking or venting from our spacecraft. Microbial sample collection outside of a pressurized spacecraft is complicated by temperature extremes, low pressures that preclude the use of laboratory standard (wetted) swabs, and operation either in bulky spacesuits or with robotic assistance. Engineers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) recently developed a swab kit for use in collecting microbial samples from the external surfaces of crewed spacecraft, including spacesuits. The Extravehicular Activity (EVA) Swab Kit consists of a single swab <b>tool</b> <b>handle</b> and an eight-canister sample caddy. The design team minimized development cost by re-purposing a heritage Space Shuttle tile repair handle that was designed to quickly snap into different tool attachments by engaging a mating device in each attachment. This allowed the <b>tool</b> <b>handle</b> to snap onto a fresh swab attachment much like popular shaving razor handles can snap onto a disposable blade cartridge. To disengage the handle from a swab, the user performs two independent functions, which can be done with a single hand. This dual operation mitigates the risk that a swab will be inadvertently released and lost in microgravity. Each swab attachment is fitted with commercially available foam swab tips, vendor-certified to be sterile for Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA). A microbial filter installed in the bottom of each sample container allows the container to outgas and repressurize without introducing microbial contaminants to internal void spaces. Extensive ground testing, post-test handling, and sample analysis confirmed the design is able to maintain sterile conditions as the canister moves between various pressure environments. To further minimize cost, the design team acquired extensive ground test experience in a relevant flight environment by piggy-backing onto suited crew training runs. These training runs allowed the project to validate tool interfaces with pressurized EVA gloves and collect user feedback on the tool design and function, as well as characterize baseline microbial data for different types of spacesuits. In general, test subjects found the EVA Swab Kit relatively straightforward to operate, but identified a number of design improvements that will be incorporated into the final design. Although originally intended to help characterize human forward contaminants, this tool has other potential applications, such as for collecting and preserving space-exposed materials to support astrobiology experiments...|$|E
