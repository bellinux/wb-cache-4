5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>the</b> <b>calculation</b> of association, {{it is common}} to take into account any variables that could potentially confound the results. Sex and age are common examples of confounding variables. Moreover, it is also known that many genetic variations are associated with the geographical and historical populations in which the mutations first arose. Because of this association, studies must take account of the geographical and ethnical background of participants by controlling for what is called population stratification.|$|E
5|$|Most {{data about}} the {{encounter}} were acquired using photographic observations by cameras of the European Fireball Network.

Both were equipped with all-sky fisheye objectives.|$|E
5|$|One {{major change}} {{was made to}} <b>the</b> <b>calculation</b> for the general {{classification}} {{before the start of}} the second Giro d'Italia.

50|$|A sanity test {{in which}} the {{above-mentioned}} procedures are used to check for errors in arithmetical <b>calculations.</b> <b>The</b> test is carried out by applying the same sequence of arithmetical operations to the digital roots of the operands as are applied to the operands themselves. If no mistakes are made in <b>the</b> <b>calculations,</b> <b>the</b> digital roots of the two resultants should be the same. If they are different, therefore, one or more mistakes must {{have been made in}} <b>the</b> <b>calculations.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Serre {{spectral}} sequence {{was used}} by Serre to prove some of the results mentioned previously. He used the fact that taking the loop space of a well behaved space shifts all the homotopy groups down by 1, so the nth homotopy group of a space X is the first homotopy group of its (n−1)-fold repeated loop space, which {{is equal to the}} first homology group of the (n−1)-fold loop space by the Hurewicz theorem. This reduces <b>the</b> <b>calculation</b> of homotopy groups of X to <b>the</b> <b>calculation</b> of homology groups of its repeated loop spaces. The Serre spectral sequence relates the homology of a space to that of its loop space, so can sometimes be used to calculate the homology of loop spaces. The Serre spectral sequence tends to have many non-zero differentials, which are hard to control, and too many ambiguities appear for higher homotopy groups. Consequently, it has been superseded by more powerful spectral sequences with fewer non-zero differentials, which give more information.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>calculation</b> of {{the general}} {{classification}} changed from the previous editions of the race, shifting to a team-based event, with each team only allowed four riders.

A total of fourteen teams participated, with 56 riders registering and 54 officially starting the race.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>calculation</b> {{time for}} the {{probability}} function can be high when the sum in P0 has many terms. <b>The</b> <b>calculation</b> time can be reduced by calculating the terms in the sum recursively relative to the term for y = x and ignoring negligible terms in the tails (Liao and Rosen, 2001).|$|E
