60|$|How far brutes {{partake in}} this faculty, {{is not easy}} to determine. I imagine they have it not in any great degree, for, though <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> several ideas {{distinct}} enough, yet it {{seems to me to be}} the prerogative of human understanding, when it has sufficiently distinguished any ideas, so as to perceive them to be perfectly different, and so consequently two, to cast about and consider in what circumstances they are capable to be compared. And therefore, I think, beasts compare not their ideas further than some sensible circumstances annexed to the objects themselves. The other power of comparing, which may be observed in men, belonging to general ideas, and useful only to abstract reasonings, we may probably conjecture beasts have not.|$|E

6000|$|First, {{when the}} men of facts despise design. This is the error of the common Dutch painters, of merely {{imitative}} painters of still life, flowers, &c., and other men who, having either the gift of accurate imitation or strong sympathies with nature, suppose that all is done when the imitation is perfected or sympathy expressed. A large body of English landscapists come into this class, including most clever sketchers from nature, who fancy that to get a sky of true tone, and a gleam of sunshine or sweep of shower faithfully expressed, is all that can be required of art. These men are generally themselves answerable for much of their deadness of feeling to the higher qualities of composition. <b>They</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> not originally the high gifts of design, but they lose such powers as they originally possessed by despising, and refusing to study, the results of great power of design in others. Their knowledge, {{as far as it}} goes, being accurate, they are usually presumptuous and self-conceited, and gradually become incapable of admiring anything but what is like their own works. They see nothing in the works of great designers but the faults, and do harm almost incalculable in the European society of the present day by sneering at the compositions of the greatest men of the earlier ages,[62] because they do not absolutely tally with their own ideas of [...] "Nature." ...|$|E
6000|$|But where, in that translation, {{would be}} the gold braided red or blue jackets of the British army and navy which lend their lustre and color here to the veranda groups? Where should one get the house walls of {{whitewashed}} stone and the garden walls which everywhere glow in the sun, and belt in little spaces full of roses and lilies? These things must come from some other association, {{and in the case}} of him who here confesses, the lustrous uniforms and the glowing walls rise from waters as far away in time as in space, and a long-ago apparition of Venetian Junes haunts the coral shore. (They are beginning to say the shore is not coral; but no matter.) To be sure, the white roofs are not accounted for in this visionary presence; and if one may not relate them to the snowfalls of home winters, then one must frankly own them absolutely tropical, together with the green-pillared and green-latticed galleries. They at least suggest the tropical scenery of Prue and I as one remembers seeing it through Titbottom's spectacles; and yet, if one supplies roofs of brown-red tiles, it is all Venetian enough, with the lagoon-like expanses that lend themselves to the fond effect. It is so Venetian, indeed, that it wants but a few silent gondolas and noisy gondoliers, in place of the dark, taciturn oarsmen of the clumsy native boats, to complete the coming and going illusion; and there is no good reason why the rough little isles that fill the bay should not call themselves respectively San Giorgio and San Clemente, and Sant' Elena and San Lazzaro: <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> no other names! ...|$|E
50|$|Shipping {{over the}} Pacific Ocean and using {{container}} trains in the US, or through Panama Canal are the established transport route between China and eastern USA. <b>They</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> lower costs.|$|E

50|$|As {{compared}} to regression analysis, which creates {{a formula that}} health care providers can use to calculate {{the probability that a}} patient has a disease, recursive partition creates a rule such as 'If a patient has finding x, y, or z <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> disease q'.|$|E
50|$|Back in the present, Angel {{is trying}} to locate Darla, over the {{objections}} of the group, who suggest Wolfram and Hart may just be trying to keep him distracted. Gunn suggests that <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> connections to the place where she`s staying, and Angel gives criteria for the kind of place she would want to live. They go off to check into it.|$|E
50|$|In the Earth's outer core, {{electric}} {{currents in}} the highly conductive liquid iron create magnetic fields by electromagnetic induction (see geodynamo). Alfvén waves are magnetohydrodynamic waves in the magnetosphere or the Earth's core. In the core, <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> little observable effect on the geomagnetic field, but slower waves such as magnetic Rossby waves may be one source of geomagnetic secular variation.|$|E

50|$|Physogaleus {{teeth are}} smaller than the tiger sharks, they also {{do not have the}} heavy serrations, and are slender and can be twisted toward the crown. This {{indicates}} <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> a diet of bony fish, similar to the living sand-tiger shark.|$|R
25|$|The {{ankles and}} the {{sacroiliac}} joint were quite loosely fixed, while the pelvis had a flexible joint {{with only one}} coccygeal vertebra. The anteorbital muscle fenestrae in their crania suggest <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> a long and mobile snout, {{similar to that of}} elephant shrews.|$|R
50|$|Nanochemistry can be {{characterized}} by concepts of size, shape, self-assembly, defects and bio-nano; So the synthesis of any new nano-construct is associated with all these concepts. Nano-construct synthesis is dependent on how the surface, size and shape will lead to self-assembly of the building blocks into the functional structures; <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> functional defects and might be useful for electronic, photonic, medical or bioanalytical problems.|$|E
50|$|Settlement geography, {{including}} urban geography, is {{the study}} of urban and rural areas with specific regards to spatial, relational and theoretical aspects of settlement. That {{is the study}} of areas which have a concentration of buildings and infrastructure. These are areas where the majority of economic activities are in the secondary sector and tertiary sectors. In case of urban settlement, <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> a high population density.|$|E
50|$|Reuther {{claimed they}} were use as 'signposts' on vacating a camp to tell those {{following}} {{where they had}} gone. Each toas thus represented a particular place, by way of its carved shape and painted detail. In 1906 Reuther retired from the mission and sold 385 toas to the South Australian Museum (images of toas) for £400. <b>They</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> {{more in common with}} 'marker pegs' than message sticks.|$|E
50|$|Based on the {{remnants}} {{that have been}} studied, {{it has not been}} determined if these birds had teeth like the others from this order. However, they were believed to not have well-developed wings. Like other hesperornithines, <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> lobed feet for swimming, rather than webbed feet.|$|R
50|$|Their exact {{cultural}} meaning remains unknown, but <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> religious and/or astronomical purposes. Most of the taulas face south, {{which seems}} to suggest some astronomical meaning. Archeologist Michael Hoskin has suggested the taulas may {{have been part of}} an ancient healing cult. They are frequently found near talayots.|$|R
5000|$|Gregory S. Paul {{used the}} term [...] "protobird" [...] in a wider sense in 1988, {{to refer to the}} {{extremely}} bird-like non-avian dinosaurs (Maniraptora), including oviraptorosaurs, troodontids, and dromaeosaurids. [...] Paul speculated that these forms were so bird-like <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> feathers, an idea later proven by fossil evidence.|$|R
5000|$|Because the visual-dramatic {{nature of}} a {{performance}} is so evident, Stockhausen calls {{special attention to the}} sounds in the first movement: [...] "Please listen to the sound of nailing. … Perhaps you will not have noticed that this is music". The sounds of the leaves in the last movement also constitute [...] "music which perhaps only a few have experienced—and if as children, <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> forgotten it [...]|$|E
5000|$|Jewell sued NBC News {{for this}} statement, made by Tom Brokaw: [...] "The {{speculation}} {{is that the}} FBI is close to making the case. <b>They</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> enough to arrest him right now, probably enough to prosecute him, but {{you always want to}} have enough to convict him as well. There are still some holes in this case". Even though NBC stood by its story, the network agreed to pay Jewell $500,000.|$|E
50|$|The Indian Fashion Industry also {{recruits}} {{models from}} Brazil as {{their approach to}} fashion is more professional and their exposure has been extensive. They are also recruited because they are much less inhibited, so assignments which require them to don a bikini or a swimsuit are easier than for Indian girls. However they earn less than Indian models but the rates are at par with {{other parts of the}} world. The only difference is that <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> to do three shows instead of one in India.|$|E
50|$|During his rule, the Garulakas or Garudakas had {{accepted}} the Maitrkas as their overlord. The Garulaka <b>had</b> captured Dwarika <b>probably</b> with help of the Maitrakas. <b>They</b> <b>probably</b> <b>has</b> an emblem of the Garuda and it his clear from their grants that they were Vaishnavas. They had made grants to Brahmanas and Buddhists alike.|$|R

50|$|These early figurines {{are among}} {{the first signs of}} human culture. One cannot know in some cases how they were used. <b>They</b> <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> {{religious}} or ceremonial significance and may have been used in many types of rituals. Many are found in burials. Some may have been worn as jewelry or intended to amuse children.|$|R
50|$|There is no {{information}} available on when these poems were collected or on {{the identity of the}} anthologist. These poems have passed through four stages of evolution. The poems were created by the bardic authors between 100 BCE and 200 CE. The poems were collected into the various anthologies; colophons were added and the poems classified into various thinais around the eighth century CE. Still later, the invocatory poems were added to the collection. Finally, around the tenth century CE commentaries were written. The whole process occurred over many centuries. As these poems have no internal safeguard to preserve them intact, <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> gone through some changes over these centuries.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origins of}} the hymn are unknown. But the {{similarity}} of this hymn with the hymns for Terce (Nunc sancte nobis spiritus) and None (Rerum Deus Tenax Vigor) means that it probably shares the same author. Baudot ("The Roman Breviary", London, 1909, 34) thinks the hymn is [...] "probably" [...] by St. Ambrose. However none of this set of three hymns {{are found in the}} oldest Benedictine collections of hymns, where Ambrose's other works are found. All three of these hymns are found in later Celtic collections. suggesting that <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> a different author. (For discussion of authorship, see Rerum Deus Tenax Vigor).|$|E
5000|$|Following news of Manchester City's interim {{financial}} results showing another huge deficit, UEFA president Michel Platini {{said he had}} been given personal assurances from club management that they would abide by the new rules. UEFA's Head of Licensing Andrea Traverso also stated, [...] "We are in talks with the club, they are aware of the rules and <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> a strategy to raise their income." [...] Despite Chelsea and Manchester City’s losses, Premier League Chief Executive Richard Scudamore said that he did not expect UEFA's rules to lead to any English club being banned from European competition. He stated, [...] "I don't see any circumstances where any of our clubs could get near to exclusion.... UEFA is too sensible, and it's not in its interests to do so. It's more about taking the steam out of the system and acting as a speed bump rather than about barring clubs." ...|$|E
5000|$|Cursuses {{are perhaps}} the most enigmatic of ancient monuments. They {{typically}} comprise two parallel ditches, the larger of which can be a mile or more in extent, cut to create a [...] "cigar shaped" [...] enclosure. Typically, burial mounds and mortuary enclosures are found alongside cursus monuments indicating that <b>they</b> <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> a ceremonial function.|$|R
