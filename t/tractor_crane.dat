Calculations in July 2015 indicated a peak of 254 g0 (2,490m/s2), and data from the FIA's World Accident Database—which sources information from racing accidents worldwide—indicate that Bianchi's impact occurred 2.61 seconds after loss of control, at a speed of 123km/h (76mph) and an angle of 55 degrees. Bianchi was reported unconscious after not responding to a team radio call or marshals. Marshals reported the accident, and safety and medical cars were dispatched. Bianchi was extracted from his car and treated at the crash site before being taken by ambulance to the circuit's medical centre.

During plus-up drills in past years, there was little need or focus in having a methodical or objective basis for prioritizing unfunded requirements and optimizing resource dollars.

The difficulties of road communications in Burma included dusty or muddy unimproved roads, jungle, obstacles, and unserviceable abandoned vehicles. At Kalewa, on the Chindwin river, impromptu boat yards were set up. Ramped cargo lighters were among the craft assembled and launched there by Indian Engineers. A <b>tractor</b> <b>crane</b> was used to position the stern, centre, and bow sections of RCLs for joining. RCLs were among the simplest craft to assemble, requiring no riveting and being composed of relatively light subsections. As soon as a vessel was launched more prefabricated sections were placed onto the slipway for assembly. [...] Following the assembly of the major subsections, deck work and finishing were accomplished. The engineers then put the RCLs through speed trials on the river. Once deployed in ferry work the RCLs could encounter river depths shallower than 3 feet. RCL crewmen would need to pilot the helmsman through shallows. The crew needed to check depth often with a pole.|$|E

40|$|This study aims to {{optimize}} the logistics processes of container terminals. Potentially powerful pipe-flow models of container terminal logistics processes have been neglected to date and modelling of terminals is rare. Because research which adopts a pipe flow and dynamic operational perspective is rare, a case application in Alexandria, Egypt collated empirical container and information flows using interviews and company records to describe its logistics processes and model container and information flows. The methodology used includes qualitative and quantitative methods and a descriptive methodology proceeds sequentially. Primary and secondary data were presented as a pipe flow model to show interrelations between the company’s resources and to identify bottlenecks. Simulation modelling used Simul 8 software. Operational level modelling of both import and export flows simulated the actual inbound and outbound flows of containers from entry to exit. The import logistics process includes activities such as unloading vessels by quay cranes, moving containers by <b>tractors</b> to yard <b>cranes</b> to go for storage where customs procedures take place before exiting the terminal by customer’s truck. The export logistics process includes the activities associated with customers’ trucks, lifters, storage yards, <b>tractors</b> and quay <b>cranes.</b> The model {{takes into account the}} uncertainties in each activity. This study focuses on operational aspects rather than cost issues, and considers container flows rather than vessel flows. Although the simulated model was not generalized, implementation elsewhere is possible. Following successful validation of a base simulation model which reproduces the case company’s historical scenario, scenario testing empowered the case company to pro-actively design and test the impact of operational changes on the entire logistics process. The study evaluates a typical container terminal logistics system including both import and export containers in the presence of multiple uncertainties in terminal operations (e. g. quay <b>crane</b> operations, <b>tractor</b> operations, yard <b>crane</b> operations).
