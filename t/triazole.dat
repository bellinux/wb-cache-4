5|$|Alprazolam is classed as a high-potency triazolo{{benzodiazepine}}: a benzodiazepine with a <b>triazole</b> ring {{attached to}} its structure. As a benzodiazepine, alprazolam produces {{a variety of}} therapeutic and adverse effects by binding to the benzodiazepine receptor site on the GABAA receptor and modulating its function; GABA receptors are the most prolific inhibitory receptor within the brain. The GABA chemical and receptor system mediates inhibitory or calming effects of alprazolam on the nervous system. The GABAA receptor {{is made up of}} 5 subunits out of a possible 19, and GABAA receptors made up of different combinations of subunits have different properties, different locations within the brain, and, importantly, different activities with regard to benzodiazepines. Alprazolam and other triazolobenzodiazepines like triazolam that have a triazol ring attached to their structure appear to have antidepressant properties, since the structure resembles that of tricyclic antidepressants, which also have rings. Alprazolam causes a marked suppression of the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal axis. The therapeutic properties of alprazolam are similar to other benzodiazepines and include anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, hypnotic and amnesic; however, it is used mainly as an anxiolytic.|$|E
25|$|Voriconazole, (trade name Vfend) is a <b>triazole</b> {{antifungal}} medication used {{to treat}} and prevent invasive fungal infections including aspergillosis and candidiasis and fungal infections caused by Scedosporium and Fusarium species.|$|E
25|$|In 2007 a {{new family}} of <b>triazole</b> NNRTIs was {{presented}} by researchers from the pharmaceutical company Ardea Biosciences. The selected candidate from the screening executed was RDEA806 belonging {{to the family of}} triazoles. It has similar resistance profile against selected NNRTI resistant HIV-1 strains to other next generation NNRTIs. The candidate entered phase IIb clinical trials in the end of 2009.|$|E
25|$|For comparison, {{another group}} of azoles is the <b>triazoles,</b> which {{includes}} fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole. The difference between the imidazoles and the <b>triazoles</b> involves the mechanism of inhibition of the cytochrome P450 enzyme. The N3 of the imidazole compound binds to the heme iron atom of ferric cytochrome P450, whereas the N4 of the <b>triazoles</b> bind to the heme group. The <b>triazoles</b> {{have been shown to}} have a higher specificity for the cytochrome P450 than imidazoles, thereby making them more potent than the imidazoles.|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} MICs of <b>triazoles</b> against 15 Candida glabrata {{clinical}} isolates by the NCCLS M 27 -A 2, Sensititre YeastOne, and Etest methods by using media at pHs 6. 0, 7. 0, and 7. 4. Thirteen isolates were {{less susceptible to}} <b>triazoles</b> at pH 6. 0 and more susceptible to <b>triazoles</b> at pH 7. 4 compared to pH 7. 0...|$|R
30|$|<b>Triazoles</b> 4 having electron-releasing substituents at para {{position}} of aryl ring of pyrazole moiety (4 a, 4 b and 4 c) are more antifungal than <b>triazoles</b> containing electron-withdrawing groups (4 a, 4 e, 4 f and 4 g) {{at the same}} position.|$|R
25|$|This species shows {{elevated}} {{resistance to}} antifungal drugs; however, four classes of drugs (itraconazole (a <b>triazole),</b> voriconazole, caspofungin and amphotericin B) demonstrate fungicidal effectiveness {{that is most}} pronounced in combination. One promising regimen combines voriconazole and caspofungin. Although disseminated infection carries a high mortality rate, the response of skin to treatment varies depending {{on the degree of}} drug susceptibility exhibited by the particular strain.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} described technique, known as sparing, involves using an antifungal agent to clear spores from airways adjacent to corticosteroid therapy. The antifungal aspect aims to reduce fungal causes of bronchial inflammation, whilst also minimising the dose of corticosteroid required {{to reduce the}} immune system’s input to disease progression. The strongest evidence (double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trials) is for itraconazole twice daily for four months, which resulted in significant clinical improvement compared to placebo, and was mirrored in CF patients. Using itraconazole appears to outweigh the risk from long-term and high-dose prednisone. Newer <b>triazole</b> drugs—such as posaconazole or voriconazole—have not yet been studied in-depth through clinical trials in this context.|$|E
25|$|A high {{temperature}} anhydrous example is PCMOF2, {{which consists of}} sodium ions coordinated to a trisulfonated benzene derivative. To improve performance and allow for higher operating temperatures, water can be replaced as the proton carrier by less volatile imidazole or <b>triazole</b> molecules within the pores. The maximum temperature achieved was 150°C with an optimum conductivity of 5 x 10−4 S/cm, which is lower than other current electrolyte membranes. However, this model holds promise for its temperature regime, anhydrous conditions, and ability to control the quantity of guest molecules within the pores, all of which allowed for the tunability of proton conductivity. Additionally, the triazole-loaded PCMOF2 was incorporated into a H2/air membrane-electrode assembly and achieved an open circuit voltage of 1.18 V at 100°C that was stable for 72 hours and managed to remain gas tight throughout testing. This was the first instance that proved MOFs could actually be implemented into functioning fuel cells, and the moderate potential difference showed that fuel crossover due to porosity was not an issue.|$|E
40|$|Background. Multiple {{international}} treatment guidelines recommend amphotericin-based combination regimens for {{induction therapy}} of cryptococcal meningitis. Yet, only 1 trial has reported a mortality benefit for combination amphotericin-flucytosine, and none have reported a mortality benefit for combination amphoteri-cin-fluconazole. Methods. We conducted a Bayesian network meta-analysis {{to estimate the}} comparative effectiveness of re-commended induction therapies for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis. We searched PubMed and Cochrane CENTRAL for clinical reports of induction therapy for HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis. We extracted or calculated early (two-week) and late (six to 12 -week) mortality by treatment arm for the following induction regimens: amphotericin B alone, amphotericin B + flucytosine, amphotericin B + <b>triazoles,</b> amphotericin B + flucytosine + <b>triazoles,</b> <b>triazoles</b> alone, <b>triazoles</b> + flucytosine, liposomal amphotericin B, and amphotericin B + other medicines. Results. In the overall sample (35 studies, n = 2483), we {{found no evidence of}} decreased mortality from addi-tion of flucytosine or <b>triazoles</b> to amphotericin B, compared with amphotericin B alone. Although we did find a nonsignificant benefit for addition of flucytosine to amphotericin B in studies including participants with altered levels of consciousness, we did not identify a benefit for combination therapy in restricted analyses in either re...|$|R
30|$|In addition, <b>triazoles</b> also display wide {{spectrum}} of biological activities and are widely employed as pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. <b>Triazoles</b> are reported to possess antibacterial, antifungal, and antihelminthic activities [16]-[21]. They have been regarded as an interesting unit in terms of biological activity [22],[23], {{and some of them}} have also shown significant anticancer activity in many of the human cell lines [24].|$|R
40|$|Invasive {{pulmonary}} aspergillosis (IPA) is a {{fungal infection}} that is seen with particular frequency in immunocompromised patients, and {{associated with high}} rates of mortality. To combat or prevent IPA, <b>triazoles</b> such as voriconazole or itraconazole and posaconazole have become accepted as first- and second-line therapy, respectively. However, <b>triazoles</b> are associated with issues of oral bioavailability, high liver metabolism, and/or drug–drug interactions, increasing the variability of systemic concentrations. As a way to overcome these issues, inhalation {{appears to be a}} promising route for delivery of <b>triazoles</b> for prophylactic or curative therapy in IPA. Indeed, pulmonary drug delivery drastically increases the drug in situ while decreasing the systemic exposure, thereby limiting drug metabolization, side effects, and drug–drug interactions. The development of <b>triazoles</b> for inhalation has focused on voriconazole and itraconazole, drugs which are both highly permeable but with significant different solubility. In this review, we describe the most advanced and promising pharmaceutical developments for voriconazole and itraconazole. SCOPUS: re. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

500|$|A {{persistent}} carbene (also {{known as}} stable carbene) {{is a type}} of carbene demonstrating particular stability. The best-known examples and by far largest subgroup are the N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHC) (sometimes called Arduengo carbenes), for example diaminocarbenes with the general formula (R2N)2C:, where the 'R's are typically alkyl and aryl groups. The groups can be linked to give heterocyclic carbenes, such as those derived from imidazole, imidazoline, thiazole [...] or <b>triazole.</b>|$|E
500|$|Stable carbenes are {{believed}} to behave {{in a similar fashion}} to organophosphines in their co-ordination properties to metals. These ligands are said to be good σ-donors through the carbenic lone pair, but poor π-acceptors due to internal ligand back-donation from the nitrogen atoms adjacent to the carbene centre, and so are able to co-ordinate to even relatively electron deficient metals. Enders [...] and Hermann have shown that these carbenes are suitable replacements for phosphine ligands in several catalytic cycles. Whilst they have found that these ligands do not activate the metal catalyst as much as phosphine ligands they often result in more robust catalysts. Several catalytic systems have been looked into by Hermann and Enders, using catalysts containing imidazole and <b>triazole</b> carbene ligands, with moderate success. Grubbs [...] has reported replacing a phosphine ligand (PCy3) with an imidazol-2-ylidene in the olefin metathesis catalyst RuCl2(PCy3)2CHPh, and noted increased ring closing metathesis as well as exhibiting [...] "a remarkable air and water stability". Molecules containing two and three carbene moieties have been prepared as potential bidentate and tridentate carbene ligands.|$|E

40|$|Azole {{resistance}} is an emerging {{problem in the}} opportunistic mould Aspergillus fumigatus. The <b>triazoles</b> {{are the most important}} agents for the management of Aspergillus diseases in humans. Selection for acquired resistance may occur in the hospital setting through exposure to high doses of azoles during azole therapy, but evidence is accumulating that A. fumigatus may become resistant to medical <b>triazoles</b> through environmental exposure to fungicides. The recovery of A. fumigatus isolates resistant to the medical <b>triazoles</b> from azole-naive patients {{as well as from the}} environment strongly indicates an environmental route of resistance selection. Molecule alignment studies have identified five fungicides that share a very similar molecule structure with the medical <b>triazoles,</b> and thus may have selected for mechanisms that confer resistance to both groups of compounds. It is important to explore further the presumed fungicide-driven route of resistance selection in order to implement effective preventive measures as the prevalence of azole resistance in A. fumigatus continues to increase and causes major challenges in the management of azole-resistant Aspergillus disease...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to aging}} and {{increasingly}} overweight in human population, {{the incidence of}} non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM or Type 2 DM) is increasing considerably. Therefore, searching for new aglycosidase inhibitors (GIs) capable of slowing down carbohydrate assimilation by humans is an important strategy towards control of NIDDM. In this report, we disclose the search for new easily accessible synthetic <b>triazoles</b> as anti-diabetic compounds. Two series of non-glycosid <b>triazoles</b> were synthesized (series A and B) and screened against baker’s yeast a-glucosidase (MAL 12) and porcine pancreatic a-amylase activity (PPA). Of the 60 compounds tested at 500 mM, were considered hits (60 % inhibition) six <b>triazoles</b> against MAL 12 and three against PPA, with the inhibition reaching up to 99. 4 % on MAL 12 and 88. 6 % on PPA. The IC 50 values were calculated for both enzymes and ranged from 54 to 482 mM for MAL 12 and 145 to 282 mM for PPA. These results demonstrated the potential activity of simple and non-glycosidic <b>triazoles</b> as an important novel class of GIs {{for the development of}} drugs to treat Type 2 DM...|$|R

The endpoint for reading caspofungin was the minimum effective concentration (MEC). Among the <b>triazoles,</b> posaconazole was most active, inhibiting 95 % of isolates at ≤ 1 μg/ml, followed by ravuconazole (91 %), voriconazole (90 %), and itraconazole (79 %). Caspofungin and amphotericin B inhibited 93 % and 89 % of isolates at ≤ 1 μg/ml, respectively, with caspofungin demonstrating an MEC 90 of 0. 12 μg/ml.

2500|$|Ribavirin is {{possibly}} best {{viewed as a}} ribosyl purine analogue with an incomplete purine 6-membered ring.
