5|$|Among {{the more}} {{original}} castings was Anette Sagen, the world's leading female ski jumper, {{in her first}} film role. Sagen, 22 at the time, played the part of 70-year-old Owe's ski jumping mother, although in a younger incarnation. Hamer had already considered Sagen for the role, when he ran into her by chance at the Holmenkollen Ski Museum. Without knowing to whom he was talking, Hamer mentioned that he was shooting a film in this location, and was planning to ask Anette Sagen <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> The reason the theme of ski jumping was chosen was that Hamer's own mother performed the sport, and the film {{has been described as}} a tribute to all female ski jumpers. Sagen herself had also earlier been involved in a controversy over women's access to professional venues and competitions. Incidentally, Sagen and Owe are also both from the Norwegian town of Mosjøen.|$|E
5|$|The {{team had}} a short time for finalizing the {{different}} aspects of the shoot, including rehearsing the whole sequence. They also had just one night to complete shooting and due to the casual nature of the song, decided to invite Madonna's close friends and family <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> Contrary to normal shooting schedules, the team had to work fast before the sun came up, since they were portraying a party at night. Following the choreography, every person on set had cues about their position and where their part would come in the shooting. A number of designers contributed clothing for the singer to wear, including Moschino, Discount Universe, SSUR, Chanel, Majesty Black and shoes by Giuseppe Zanotti. According to Amber Kallor from Style.com, various contemporary fashion trends appeared in the video, including candy-colored hairs, black lips, white bows and glitter eye makeup.|$|E

However, McGann {{went on to say that}} he could still be in the 50th but at the last moment. Radio Times reported rumours that a Doctor from the classic era (pre-2005) would feature in the special, citing unknown sources. Freema Agyeman and John Barrowman, who played Tenth Doctor companions Martha Jones and Jack Harkness, respectively, both stated they would not be in the 50th, but may return to the show at some point. Barrowman stated that he would have liked <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> but speculated that the producers wanted to try some different things.|$|E

500|$|In 1997, Baker {{was cast}} in a {{supporting}} role in David Fincher's thriller The Game, in which she plays a housekeeper to a billionaire San Franscisco banker (played by Michael Douglas) who becomes embroiled in a sadistic game by his antagonistic brother, played by Sean Penn. In an interview with The New York Post following the film's release, Baker commented on her role, saying: [...] "It's an important movie and I'm honored <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> Of course, I'd {{like to be the}} romantic lead, and I'm actually closer to Michael's [...] age than Deborah Kara Unger is, [...] I think it's always worked that way in Hollywood. When I was in my 20s, I played opposite Jimmy Stewart, Robert Mitchum, and Clark Gable, all of whom were old enough to be my father." [...] The Game proved to be a major success among Baker's later films, performing successfully at the box office and garnering widespread critical acclaim.|$|E

500|$|DreamWorks {{announced}} Burton's {{appointment in}} August 2006, and Johnny Depp was cast as Todd. Christopher Lee, Peter Bowles, Anthony Head, {{and five other}} actors were set to play the ghost narrators, but their roles were cut (Head does appear in an uncredited cameo as a gentleman who congratulates Depp after the shaving contest). According to Lee, these deletions were due to time constraints caused by a break in filming during March 2007, while Depp's daughter recovered from an illness. Burton's domestic partner Helena Bonham Carter was cast in October 2006, as well as Sacha Baron Cohen. In December 2006, Alan Rickman was cast.

500|$|In total, 51 EastEnders {{cast members}} were {{involved}} in the live broadcast. Several cast members expressed trepidation at the prospect of the live episode. Before details of the episode's plot were confirmed, Turner hoped that she would not be involved in it, deeming herself [...] "awful" [...] at performing live, unable to even deliver speeches. Neil McDermott feared that he would lose his composure and laugh during the broadcast, while Palmer hoped that the episode would not turn into a pantomime, commenting: [...] "I hope we're a bit more professional than that." [...] Simons stated that she was looking forward to the challenge the episode presented, though she would be happier once she had seen the script. Clements denied any apprehension, likening the performance to acting in theatre, and Nina Wadia stated that she was [...] "really looking forward to it", enjoying experiences with an [...] "adrenaline rush." [...] Once the script was released, Wadia was [...] "disappointed yet relieved" [...] to learn she did not have a speaking role, explaining: [...] "You want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> but not to mess it up."

500|$|During 2007 spring practice, Scott {{was third}} on the depth chart, but {{suffered}} a left knee injury, which forced him to miss most of camp. During the 2007 season, he played in nine games as a reserve tailback behind Lance Ball and Keon Lattimore and as a kickoff returner. Despite the team's abundance of running backs, Friedgen wanted to utilize Scott in some capacity because of his speed, which had been recorded at 4.25seconds in the 40-yard dash. Maryland wide receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey said, [...] "On paper it says I'm faster, but Da'Rel, he's just {{a different type of}} animal." [...] Against Wake Forest, he saw his first action when he returned four kickoffs for 101yards. Scott's special teams performance in that game sufficiently impressed head coach Friedgen that he said, [...] "I think I've got to try to get him involved within the offense. I think he's a guy that can make some plays for us." [...] The following week, unranked Maryland upset 10th-ranked Rutgers, and Scott made his first career appearance as a tailback. He had three carries for 29yards. After sitting out the Georgia Tech game because of an ankle injury, he returned four kicks for 68yards against Virginia, three for 56yards against Clemson, and two for 40yards against North Carolina. Against eighth-ranked Boston College, Scott caught a short screen pass from quarterback Chris Turner and ran 57yards for a touchdown. It was his first career reception and first career touchdown. It was one of just two offensive plays for Scott in that game, and incidentally, he was not intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> Friedgen said:"When he was in the game, I didn't even know he was in the game. I called a screen pass. I looked up, and it was Da'Rel in there. I figured we were just giving Lance a rest, but I asked [...] Zacharias about it Sunday and he started laughing. I said 'Did you put Da'Rel in for that screen pass?' He said, 'Lance's equipment was broken, so he had to go in the game.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Apple and NeXT {{marketing}} executive and Jobs' confidant in the film. When discussing her audition for the film, Winslet later commented that she [...] "heard about {{it through a}} crew member who I happened {{to be working with}} , I didn't even care what role it was. I just wanted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> Found out the nature of the role. Googled [...] Found one picture of her. Got my husband to go to a wig shop. Buy a short-haired dark wig. Stuck it on my head. Sent a photograph of myself to [...] Scott Rudin. Danny Boyle came to Melbourne and we had a meeting and he gave me the part." [...] Winslet spent considerable time with Joanna Hoffman to prepare for the role before production began. She noted that Hoffman [...] "has a softness to her. She came to America as a young woman and achieved a great deal. One thing that was unique about her as a figure in Steve's life was that she didn't need anything from him. She just needed for him to be the best version of himself. And that's what really set their relationship apart from any relationship with all his other colleagues." [...] Winslet credits Hoffman's difficult childhood (that began in Armenia) with her ability to manage Jobs. [...] On {{the nature of the relationship}} between Hoffman and Jobs, Winslet said that she and Fassbender [...] "were able to develop as literally co-workers. I do believe it was very similar to the relationship that Steve and Joanna had. She was like his work wife. She was head of marketing for the Macintosh, and then she stayed with him for his working life. She was an extraordinary, feisty Eastern European person who was pretty much the only person who could actually knock sense into Steve, and she was also kind of an emotional compass." [...] In developing her sense of the character, Winslet stated that she [...] "just wanted to please [...] as much as I could. How she sounds, and her accent, is fairly complicated. She grew up largely in Armenia, spent some time in Poland, and has Russians in her family, so she has all three accents, but she's been in America since she was a teenager, so she had American rhythms. You know, she really has this accent that goes way up and down. It's almost impossible to copy because of just how singsongy it becomes. So I had to put it into my own register. But we were all doing accents. I mean, Michael's Irish, and he's playing Steve Jobs, for God's sake." [...] Finally, Winslet notes that Hoffman [...] "did genuinely love [...] And spending time with her, when I was figuring out how to play this difficult part, she would become very emotional. She misses him terribly." ...|$|E
