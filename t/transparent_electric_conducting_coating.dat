40|$|Due to {{the health}} azards of {{asbestos}} fibres, industry is searching hard for safe fibrous ubstitutes. The question however emains if these new fibres endanger health not just as much. So {{it is important to}} investigate the relation between different fibre parameters and their health hazards. One of the first objectives is to gain information on the transport and deposition of fibres in the lung. For this purpose a physical lung model has been designed and built, simulating as much as possible the actual conditions in the human lung. For the experiments, well designed uniform fibres are highly desirable. To obtain these it was necessary toadd an extra separation step with a large inertial spectrometer (LASPEC),designed by Prodi et al (1984), to the production process of the fibres. This production process was developed at the Delft University of Technology by Buwalda et al. (1990). The dispersion of these fibres into the system proved to be possible with a spinning top aerosol generator (STAG). The lung model itself consists of glass tubes according to a model designed by Yeh and Schum (1980) with <b>electric</b> <b>conducting</b> inner <b>coating.</b> A newly designed humidification system creates a near saturated atmosphere in the lung model...|$|R

40|$|A {{general theory}} {{to study the}} {{electromagnetic}} diffraction by imperfect half planes immersed in linear homogeneous bianisotropic media is presented. The problem is formulated in terms of Wiener-Hopf equations by deriving explicit spectral domain expressions for the characteristic impedances of bianisotropic media, which allow one to exploit their analytical properties. In the simpler case of perfect <b>electric</b> <b>conducting</b> and perfect magnetic conducting half planes, the Wiener-Hopf equations involve matrices of order 2, which can be factorized in closed form if the constitutive tensors of the bianisotropic material are of special form.
