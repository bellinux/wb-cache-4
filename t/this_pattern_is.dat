5|$|In animals, the {{mitochondrial}} genome {{is typically}} a single circular chromosome that is approximately 16 kb long and has 37 genes. The genes, while highly conserved, may vary in location. Curiously, <b>this</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> {{not found in}} the human body louse (Pediculus humanus). Instead, this mitochondrial genome is arranged in 18 minicircular chromosomes, each of which is 3–4 kb long and has one to three genes. <b>This</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> also found in other sucking lice, but not in chewing lice. Recombination has been shown to occur between the minichromosomes. The reason for this difference is not known.|$|E

5|$|Gorgosaurus {{spent as}} much as half its life in the {{juvenile}} phase before ballooning up to near-maximum size in only a few years. This, along with the complete lack of predators intermediate in size between huge adult tyrannosaurids and other small theropods, suggests that these niches may have been filled by juvenile tyrannosaurids. <b>This</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> seen in modern Komodo dragons, whose hatchlings start off as tree-dwelling insectivores and slowly mature into massive apex predators capable of taking down large vertebrates. Other tyrannosaurids, including Albertosaurus, have been found in aggregations that some have suggested to represent mixed-age packs, but {{there is no evidence of}} gregarious behavior in Gorgosaurus.|$|E

5|$|A {{consequence}} of describing electrons as waveforms {{is that it}} is mathematically impossible to simultaneously derive the position and momentum of an electron. This became known as the Heisenberg uncertainty principle after the theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg, who first described it and published it in 1927. This invalidated Bohr's model, with its neat, clearly defined circular orbits. The modern model of the atom describes the positions of electrons in an atom in terms of probabilities. An electron can potentially be found at any distance from the nucleus, but, depending on its energy level, exists more frequently in certain regions around the nucleus than others; <b>this</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> referred to as its atomic orbital. The orbitals {{come in a variety of}} shapes-sphere, dumbbell, torus, etc.-with the nucleus in the middle.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} Maastrichtian, albertosaurines {{appear to have}} gone extinct, while the tyrannosaurine Tyrannosaurus roamed from Saskatchewan to Texas. <b>This</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> {{mirrored}} in other North American dinosaur taxa. During the Campanian and early Maastrichtian, lambeosaurine hadrosaurs and centrosaurine ceratopsians are common in the northwest, while hadrosaurines and chasmosaurines were more common to the south. By {{the end of the}} Cretaceous, centrosaurines are unknown and lambeosaurines are rare, while hadrosaurines and chasmosaurines were common throughout the Western Interior. A study published in the journal Scientific Reports on February 2, 2016 by Steve Brusatte, Thomas Carr et al. indicates that during the later Maastrichtian, Tyrannosaurus itself might have been partially responsible for the extinction of the other tyrannosaurids in most of western North America. The study indicates that Tyrannosaurus might have been an immigrant from Asia as opposed to having evolved in North America (possibly a descendent of the closely related Tarbosaurus) that supplanted and outcompeted other tyrannosaurids. This theory is further supported by the fact that few to no other types of tyrannosaurid are found within Tyrannosaurus known range.|$|E
5|$|Recently, {{the theory}} that temnospondyls were the {{ancestors}} of all lissamphibians has gained wide support. The skull morphology of some small temnospondyls {{has been compared to}} those of modern frogs and salamanders, but the presence of bicuspid, pedicellate teeth in small, paedomorphic or immature temnospondyls has been cited as the most convincing argument in favor of the temnospondyl origin of lissamphibians. Seen in lissamphibians and many dissorophoid temnospondyls, pedicellate teeth have calcified tips and bases. During the development of most tetrapods, teeth begin to calcify at their tips. Calcification normally proceeds downward {{to the base of the}} tooth, but calcification from the tip stops abruptly in pedicellate teeth. Calcification resumes at the base, leaving an area in the center of the tooth uncalcified. <b>This</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> seen in living amphibians and fossils.|$|E

Other nearby highways include US12 (Michigan Ave.), M-17 (Washtenaw Ave.), and M-153 (Ford Rd.). Several of the major surface arteries lead to the I-94/M-14 interchange in the west, US 23 in the east, and the city's southern areas. The city also has a system of bike routes and paths and includes the nearly complete Washtenaw County Border-to-Border Trail.|$|E
5|$|This {{alone is}} not enough to protect Pluto; {{perturbations}} from the planets (especially Neptune) could alter Pluto's orbit (such as its orbital precession) over millions of years so that a collision could be possible. Pluto is also protected by its 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune: for every two orbits that Pluto makes around the Sun, Neptune makes three. Each cycle lasts about 495 years. <b>This</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> such that, in each 495-year cycle, the first time Pluto is near perihelion, Neptune is over 50° behind Pluto. By Pluto's second perihelion, Neptune will have completed a further one and a half of its own orbits, and so will be nearly 130° ahead of Pluto. Pluto and Neptune's minimum separation is over 17AU, which is greater than Pluto's minimum separation from Uranus (11AU). The minimum separation between Pluto and Neptune actually occurs near the time of Pluto's aphelion.|$|E
5|$|Trapalcotherium is {{a fossil}} mammal from the Cretaceous of Argentina {{in the family}} Ferugliotheriidae. The single species, T. matuastensis, is known from one tooth, a first lower molar. It is from the Allen Formation, which is {{probably}} Maastrichtian in age, and was first described in 2009. The tooth bears two rows of cusps, one at the inner (lingual) side and the other at the outer (labial) side, which are connected by transverse ridges separated by deep valleys. <b>This</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> reminiscent of Ferugliotherium, a gondwanathere mammal from similarly aged deposits in Argentina, and Trapalcotherium is therefore recognized {{as a member of}} the same family Ferugliotheriidae.

5|$|Lions are {{the most}} {{socially}} inclined of all wild felids, most of which remain quite solitary in nature, and have two types of social organisation. Some lions are residents, living in groups of related lionesses, their mates, and offspring. Such a group is called a pride. Females form the stable social unit in a pride and do not tolerate outside females. Membership only changes with the births and deaths of lionesses, although some females do leave and become nomadic. Although extremely large prides, consisting of up over 30 individuals, have been observed, the average pride consists of around fifteen lions; including several adult females, up to four males (known as a coalition if more than one) and their cubs of both sexes. The sole exception to <b>this</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> the Tsavo lion pride which always has just one adult male. Male cubs are excluded from their maternal pride when they reach maturity at around 2–3 years of age. The second organisational behaviour is labeled nomads, who range widely and move about sporadically, either singularly or in pairs. Pairs are more frequent among related males who have been excluded from their birth pride. Note that a lion may switch lifestyles; nomads may become residents and vice versa. Interactions between prides and nomads tend to be hostile, although pride females in estrous may allow nomad males to approach them.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} of the shell is basically whitish or yellowish, with a net-like dark reddish or violet pattern. <b>This</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> very variable (depending on environmental factors), sometimes partly presenting bands, and even occasionally being evenly dark. The shell is very variable in color and color patterns, showing great polymorphism. Shell coloration and patterns are very plastic in all species of the genus Theodoxus and these qualities {{may be influenced by}} factors like ionic composition of water, type of substratum and nutrition of individuals in various habitats. Zettler and colleagues (2004) showed that in the outer coastal waters of the Baltic Sea, the nearly black and often corroded shell form of Theodoxus fluviatilis is predominant, whereas in the inner (sheltered) parts of coastal waters, yellowish-green forms prevail. Glöer and Pešić (2015) observed that specimens from a darker stony substrate were black or dark brown. Shells of specimens of Theodoxus fluviatilis from Northern Europe are ornamented with a pattern of white, drop-like spots on a dark or red background. Specimens from South France and Spain are ornamented with a pattern of zigzag stripes, while specimens from the Balkans show all possible combinations of white drop-like spots and zigzag stripes. Animals from lacustrine habitats show dark or light bands on the shell.|$|E
5|$|The natural diets {{of snakes}} in the {{widespread}} viper genus Echis are highly varied, and include arthropods, such as scorpions, {{as well as}} vertebrates. Various Echis species consume different quantities of arthropods in their diet. A study carried out in 2009 injected scorpions with the venom of various Echis species, and found a high correlation between the proportion of arthropods that the snakes consumed in their natural habitat, and the toxicity of their venom to scorpions. The researchers also found evidence that the evolution of venom more toxic to arthropods was related {{to an increase in}} the proportion of arthropods in the snakes' diet, and that diet and venom may have evolved by a process of coevolution. A phylogeny of the genus constructed using mitochondrial DNA showed that one instance of a change in venom composition in the species ancestral to all Echis snakes was correlated with a shift to an arthropod based diet, whereas another shift in a more recent lineage was correlated with a shift to a diet of vertebrates. Despite the higher toxicity of the venom of arthropod-consuming species, it was not found to incapacitate or kill prey any faster than that of species with fewer arthropods in their diet. Thus, the venom is thought to have evolved to minimize the volume required, as the production of venom carries a significant metabolic cost, thus providing a fitness benefit. <b>This</b> <b>pattern</b> <b>is</b> also found in other lineages. Similar results were obtained by a 2012 study which found that the venom of arthropod-consuming Echis species was more toxic to locusts than that of vertebrate-consuming species.|$|E
