40|$|Edge {{computing}} {{has evolved}} to be a promising avenue {{to enhance the}} system computing capability by offloading processing tasks from the cloud to edge devices. In this paper, we propose a multi- layer edge computing framework called EdgeFlow. In this framework, different nodes ranging from edge devices to cloud data centers are categorized into corresponding layers and cooperate together for data processing. With the help of EdgeFlow, one can balance the trade-off between computing and communication capability so that the tasks are assigned to each layer optimally. At the same time, resources are carefully allocated throughout the whole network to mitigate performance fluctuation. The proposed open-source data flow processing framework is implemented on a platform that can emulate various computing nodes in multiple layers and corresponding network connections. Evaluated on a mobile sensing scenario, EdgeFlow can significantly reduce <b>task</b> <b>finish</b> time and is more tolerant to run-time variation, compared to traditional cloud computing and the pure edge computing approach. Potential applications of EdgeFlow, including network function visualization, Internet of Things, and vehicular networks, are also discussed {{in the end of}} this work.

In this dissertation, we focus on channel allocation and media access organization for Vehicle-to-Roadside Units (V 2 R) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V 2 V) communications. An efficient channel allocation algorithm for Roadside Unit (RSU) access is proposed. The goal of the algorithm is to increase system throughput by admitting more tasks (vehicles) and at the same time reduce the risk of the admitted tasks. The algorithm admits the new requests only when their requirements can be fulfilled and all in-session tasks 2 ̆ 7 requirements are also guaranteed. The algorithm calculates the expected <b>task</b> <b>finish</b> time for the tasks, but allocates a virtual transmission plan for the tasks as they progress toward the edges of the RSU range.

In order to make this method efficient in rapid topology change environment like VANET, it 2 ̆ 7 s important to make the network topology less dynamic by forming local strongly connected clustering structure, which leads to a stable network topology on the global scale.

40|$|Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) as an {{emerging}} paradigm utilizing cloudlet or fog nodes to extend remote cloud computing {{to the edge}} of the network, is foreseen as a key technology towards next generation wireless networks. By offloading computation intensive tasks from resource constrained mobile devices to fog nodes or the remote cloud, the energy of mobile devices can be saved and the computation capability can be enhanced. For fog nodes, they can rent the resource rich remote cloud to help them process incoming tasks from mobile devices. In this architecture, the benefit of short computation and computation delay of mobile devices can be fully exploited. However, existing studies mostly assume fog nodes possess unlimited computing capacity, which is not practical, especially when fog nodes are also energy constrained mobile devices. To provide incentive of fog nodes and reduce the computation cost of mobile devices, we provide a cost effective offloading scheme in mobile edge computing with the cooperation between fog nodes and the remote cloud with task dependency constraint. The mobile devices have limited budget and have to determine which task should be computed locally or sent to the fog. To address this issue, we first formulate the offloading problem as a <b>task</b> <b>finish</b> time inimization problem with given budgets of mobile devices, which is NP-hard. We then devise two more algorithms to study the network performance. Simulation results show that the proposed greedy algorithm can achieve the near optimal performance. On average, the Brute Force method and the greedy algorithm outperform the simulated annealing algorithm by about 28. 13 % on the application finish time.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} energy {{management}} techniques for distributed {{systems such as}} hand-held mobile devices, sensor nodes, and data center servers. One of the major design problems in multiple application domains is the mismatch between workloads and resources. Sub-optimal assignment of workloads to resources can cause underloaded or overloaded resources, resulting in performance degradation or energy waste. This work specifically focuses on the heterogeneity in system hardware components and workloads. It includes energy management solutions for unregulated or batteryless embedded systems; and data center servers with heterogeneous workloads, machines, and processor wear states. This thesis describes four major contributions: (1) This thesis describes a battery test and energy delivery system design process to maintain battery life in embedded systems without voltage regulators. (2) In battery-less sensor nodes, this thesis demonstrates a routing protocol to maintain reliable transmission through the sensor network. (3) This thesis has characterized typical workloads and developed two models to capture the heterogeneity of data center tasks and machines: a task performance model and a machine resource utilization model. These models allow users to predict <b>task</b> <b>finish</b> time on individual machines. It then integrates these two models into a task scheduler based on the Hadoop framework for MapReduce tasks, and uses this scheduler for server energy minimization using task concentration. (4) In addition to saving server energy consumption, this thesis describes a method of reducing data center cooling energy by maintaining optimal server processor temperature setpoints through a task assignment algorithm. This algorithm considers the reliability impact of processor wear states. It records processor wear states through automatic timing slack tests on a cluster of machines with varying core temperatures, voltages, and frequencies. These optimal temperature setpoints are used in a task scheduling algorithm that saves both server and cooling energy...|$|E

40|$|Multiprocessor Systems on a Chip (MPSoCs) are {{suitable}} platforms for executing complex embedded applications. To {{reduce the cost}} of the hardware platform, applications share resources, which may result in inter-application timing interference due to resource request conflicts. Bounding or prohibiting this interference is crucial, as the timing of real-time applications has to be predicted in each possible case. Resources that allow sharing without application interference are denoted as composable. Composability is a desired platform property, as it enables the design and analysis of applications in isolation, and their integration with linear effort. Previous work demonstrates composability for different resources, i. e., processor, interconnect, memory. Processor composability is achieved by utilizing an Operating System (OS) that schedules fixed duration task slots, using a two-level, hierarchical approach. First, the OS determines which application owns the next slot following a strict, preemptive Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) policy, and then it picks and schedules a task of that application. As scheduling decisions are taken exclusively at slots borders, when a task finishes before its slot depletes, the time left is wasted. This may result in low processor utilization for streaming applications for which the execution of a task may start after its predecessor tasks have finished. In this work we propose a new task scheduling strategy, namely application-space task scheduling that eliminates wasted slot time. We make use of the fixed duration slots and the application TDM, to preserve composability, but the application invokes the task scheduler immediately after each <b>task</b> <b>finish,</b> inside its slot. As the application-space task scheduling strategy alone may not support all types of task scheduling, e. g., preemptive, we propose to combine OS-space and application-space scheduling on the same processor. To experimentally investigate the composability and performance of our scheme we survey existing benchmarks for the embedded domain, and build a workload consisting of two streaming applications and a synthetic application. We executed these applications on an MPSoC with two processor tiles, a monitor tile, all connected by a Æthereal NoC. Our experiments indicate that mixing application-space and OS-space task schedulers is composable. Furthermore, the application-space task scheduling achieves 17 % to 40 % better performance than the OS-space task scheduling for the streaming applications exercised.
