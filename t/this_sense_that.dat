25|$|The secret police, Securitate, {{had become}} so omnipresent that it made Romania {{essentially}} a police state. Free speech was limited and opinions that did not favor the Communist Party were forbidden. The large numbers of Securitate informers made organised dissent nearly impossible. The regime deliberately played on <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> everyone was being watched {{to make it easier}} to bend the people to the Party's will. Even by Soviet-bloc standards, the Securitate was exceptionally brutal.|$|E
25|$|Therefore, all sins {{are also}} against {{the natural law}}. But the natural law of many aspects of life is knowable apart from special revelation by {{examining}} the forms and purposes of those aspects. It is in <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> Aquinas considered homosexuality unnatural, since it involves a kind of partner other than the kind to which the purpose of sexuality points. He considered it comparable to heterosexual sex for pleasure (rather than reproduction).|$|E
25|$|The Bayesian {{approach}} {{is superior to}} use in decision making {{when there is a}} high level of uncertainty or limited information in which to base decisions on and where expert opinion or historical knowledge is available. Bayes is also useful when explaining the findings in a probability- sense to people who are less familiar and comfortable with comprehending statistics. It is in <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> Bayesian methods are thought of as having created a bridge between business judgments and statistics for the purpose of decision-making.|$|E
5000|$|A clear {{motivation}} of conceptualism, in <b>this</b> <b>sense,</b> is <b>that</b> {{the kind of}} perception that rational creatures like humans enjoy is unique {{in the fact that}} it has conceptual character. McDowell explains his position in a recent paper as: ...|$|R
50|$|Muktzeh is {{essentially}} a restriction on objects that were not 'prepared' before the Sabbath. The absence of preparedness in <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> means <b>that</b> {{the vast majority of}} people would not expect to use this particular item or substance on Shabbat.|$|R
50|$|In 1959 the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) {{recommended}} that 'the word metalloid {{should not be}} used to denote nonmetals' although it was still being used in <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> (around <b>that</b> time) by, for example, the French.|$|R
25|$|In Christianity, God the Father's {{relationship}} with humanity is {{as a father}} to children—in a previously unheard-of sense—and not just as the creator and nurturer of creation, and the provider for his children, his people. Thus, humans in general are sometimes called children of God. To Christians, God the Father's {{relationship with}} humanity is that of Creator and created beings, and in that respect he {{is the father of}} all. The New Testament says, in <b>this</b> <b>sense,</b> <b>that</b> the very idea of family, wherever it appears, derives its name from God the Father, and thus God himself is the model of the family.|$|E
25|$|Evolution, like prohibition, {{is a broad}} term. In recent bickering, however, {{evolution}} has been understood to mean the theory which holds that man has developed from some pre-existing lower type. This is the popular significance of evolution, just as the popular significance of prohibition is prohibition of the traffic in intoxicating liquors. It was in that sense that evolution {{was used in this}} act. It is in <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> the word will be used in this opinion, unless the context otherwise indicates. It is only to the theory of the evolution of man from a lower type that the act before us was intended to apply, and much of the discussion we have heard is beside this case.|$|E
25|$|Spencer {{followed}} Comte in {{aiming for}} the unification of scientific truth; it was in <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> his philosophy aimed to be 'synthetic.' Like Comte, he was committed to the universality of natural law, {{the idea that the}} laws of nature applied without exception, to the organic realm as much as to the inorganic, and to the human mind as much as to the rest of creation. The first objective of the Synthetic Philosophy was thus to demonstrate that there were no exceptions to being able to discover scientific explanations, in the form of natural laws, of all the phenomena of the universe. Spencer's volumes on biology, psychology, and sociology were all intended to demonstrate the existence of natural laws in these specific disciplines. Even in his writings on ethics, he held {{that it was possible to}} discover 'laws' of morality that had the status of laws of nature while still having normative content, a conception which can be traced to George Combe's Constitution of Man.|$|E
5000|$|In Transaction Costs, Institutions and Economic Performance (1992), Douglass C. North {{argues that}} institutions, {{understood}} as the set of rules in a society, are key in the determination of transaction costs.

50|$|In {{a literal}} sense, the term modern physics, means {{up-to-date}} physics. In <b>this</b> <b>sense,</b> {{a significant portion}} of so-called classical physics is modern. However, since roughly 1890, new discoveries have caused significant paradigm shifts: the advent of quantum mechanics (QM) and of Einsteinian relativity (ER). Physics that incorporates elements of either QM or ER (or both) is said to be modern physics. It is in <b>this</b> latter <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> the term is generally used.|$|R
25|$|Suppose {{a system}} is {{thermally}} and mechanically isolated from the environment (isolated system). For example, consider an insulating rigid box divided by a movable partition into two volumes, each filled with gas. If the pressure of one gas is higher, it will expand by moving the partition, thus performing work on the other gas. Also, if the gases are at different temperatures, heat can flow from one gas to the other provided the partition allows heat conduction. Our above result indicates that the entropy of {{the system as a}} whole will increase during these processes. There exists a maximum amount of entropy the system may possess under the circumstances. This entropy corresponds to a state of stable equilibrium, since a transformation to any other equilibrium state would cause the entropy to decrease, which is forbidden. Once the system reaches this maximum-entropy state, no part of the system can perform work on any other part. It is in <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> entropy {{is a measure of the}} energy in a system that cannot be used to do work.|$|E
500|$|By [...] "traditional power", Russell has in {{mind the}} ways in which people will appeal to the force of habit to justify a {{political}} regime. It is in <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> traditional power is psychological and not historical; since traditional power is not entirely based on a commitment to some linear historical creed, but rather, on mere habit. Moreover, traditional power need not be based on actual history, but rather be based on imagined or fabricated history. Thus he writes that [...] "Both religious and secular innovators – at any rate those who have had most lasting success – have appealed, as far as they could, to tradition, and have done whatever lay in their power to minimise the elements of novelty in their system."

50|$|An {{implication}} of permission culture is that creators are blocked by systemic procedures and this discourages innovation. Requiring permission in <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> means <b>that</b> creators {{will have to}} prove their usage of material is fair, even where legally unnecessary, which {{is a process that}} some would decide not to continue.|$|R
50|$|That evening, Steve and Jean are playfully {{sharing a}} joint of marijuana. Johnna sees <b>this</b> and, <b>sensing</b> <b>that</b> {{he intends to}} molest her, goes after him with a shovel. Barbara confronts Jean and slaps her. This impels Bill to take Jean back to Colorado, leaving Barbara. Karen also leaves with Steve.|$|R
5000|$|The San Francisco Chronicle {{described}} Gray's Anatomy as an unremarkable story. [...] "There's something intrinsically insincere {{about the}} whole quest. <b>This</b> creeping <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> Gray isn't really interested in anything he's talking about - that he, alone, {{is the subject of}} his own obsession gives Gray's Anatomy a distasteful edge." ...|$|R
2500|$|By {{the mid-19th}} century Snap-dragon was firmly entrenched as a Christmas parlour game, {{and it is in}} <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> it is {{referenced}} in 1836, in Charles Dickens' The Pickwick Papers [...] and in 1861, in Anthony Trollope's novel Orley Farm.|$|E

2500|$|During the 15th and 16th centuries, a new {{intensive}} form of Talmud study arose. Complicated logical {{arguments were}} used to explain minor points of contradiction within the Talmud. The term pilpul was applied {{to this type of}} study. Usage of pilpul in <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> (<b>that</b> of [...] "sharp analysis") harks back to the Talmudic era and refers to the intellectual sharpness this method demanded.|$|E

Cramér's theorem in <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> states <b>that</b> the probabilities of [...] "large deviations" [...] away from the mean in this sequence decay exponentially with the rate given by the Cramér function, which is the Legendre transform of the cumulant-generating function of Xk.|$|R
5000|$|This {{is based}} on the notion of an {{asymptotic}} function which cleanly approaches a constant value (the asymptote) as the independent variable goes to infinity; [...] "clean" [...] in <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> meaning <b>that</b> for any desired closeness epsilon there is some value of the independent variable after which the function never differs from the constant by more than epsilon.|$|R

2500|$|Although the 1968 Condon Report {{came to a}} {{negative}} conclusion (written by Condon), {{it is known that}} many members of the study strongly disagreed with Condon's methods and biases. Most quit the project in disgust or were fired for insubordination. A few became ETH supporters. Perhaps the best known example is David Saunders, who in his 1968 book UFOs? Yes lambasted Condon for extreme bias and ignoring or misrepresenting critical evidence. Saunders wrote, [...] "It is clear... that the sightings have been going on for too long to explain in terms of straightforward terrestrial intelligence. It's in <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> ETI (Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) stands as the 'least implausible' explanation of 'real UFOs'." ...|$|E
2500|$|Two {{sets are}} Turing {{equivalent}} {{if they have}} the same level of unsolvability; each Turing degree is a collection of Turing equivalent sets, so that two sets are in different Turing degrees exactly when they are not Turing equivalent. [...] Furthermore, the Turing degrees are partially ordered so that if the Turing degree of a set X is less than the Turing [...] degree of a set Y then any (noncomputable) procedure that correctly decides whether numbers are in Y can be effectively converted to a procedure that correctly decides whether numbers are in X. It is in <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> the Turing degree of a set corresponds to its level of algorithmic unsolvability.|$|E

[...] "When an Ottoman sultan established a new medrese, he would invite scholars from the Islamic world—for example, Murad II brought scholars from Persia, such as ʻAlāʼ al-Dīn and Fakhr al-Dīn who helped enhance {{the reputation of the}} Ottoman medrese". This reveals that the Islamic world was interconnected in the early modern period as they travelled around to other Islamic states exchanging knowledge. <b>This</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> the Ottoman Empire was becoming modernised through globalization is also recognised by Hamadeh who says: [...] "Change in the eighteenth century as the beginning of a long and unilinear march toward westernisation reflects the two centuries of reformation in sovereign identity." ...|$|E
25|$|In {{this context}} Frame defines rationalism as {{any attempt to}} {{establish}} the finite human mind as the ultimate standard of truth and falsity.

50|$|The {{importance}} to network {{analysis of the}} PR condition lies in the realisability condition. Z(s) is realisable as a one-port rational impedance {{if and only if}} it meets the PR condition.

2500|$|We {{experience}} the world subjectively thus we create subjective representations of our experience. These subjective representations of experience are constituted {{in terms of}} five senses and language. That is to say our subjective conscious experience {{is in terms of}} the traditional senses of vision, audition, tactition, olfaction and gustation such that when we—for example—rehearse an activity [...] "in our heads", recall an event or anticipate the future we will [...] "see" [...] images, [...] "hear" [...] sounds, [...] "taste" [...] flavours, [...] "feel" [...] tactile sensations, [...] "smell" [...] odours and think in some (natural) language. [...] Furthermore it is claimed that these subjective representations of experience have a discernible structure, a pattern. It is in <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> NLP is sometimes defined as the study of the structure of subjective experience.|$|E
2500|$|The {{dismantling}} of the false self [...] "leaves the impaired real self {{with the opportunity to}} convert its potential and its possibilities into actualities." [...] Working through brings unique rewards, of which the most important element is the growing realization that the individual has a fundamental, internal need for relatedness that may be expressed in a variety of ways. [...] "Only schizoid patients", suggests Klein, [...] "who have worked through the abandonment depression... ultimately will believe that the capacity for relatedness and the wish for relatedness are woven into the structure of their beings, that they are truly part of who the patients are and what they contain as human beings. It is <b>this</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> finally allows the schizoid patient to feel the most intimate sense of being connected with humanity more generally, and with another person more personally. For the schizoid patient, this degree of certainty is the most gratifying revelation, and a profound new organizer of the self experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{understand}} the definition above, one must understand [...] "informal" [...] which takes its meaning {{in contrast to}} its counterpart [...] "formal." [...] (This point was not made {{for a very long}} time, hence the nature of informal logic remained opaque, even to those involved in it, for a period of time.) Here it is helpful to have recourse to Barth and Krabbe (1982:14f) where they distinguish three senses of the term [...] "form." [...] By [...] "form1," [...] Barth and Krabbe mean the sense of the term which derives from the Platonic idea of form—the ultimate metaphysical unit. Barth and Krabbe claim that most traditional logic is formal in <b>this</b> <b>sense.</b> <b>That</b> is, syllogistic logic is a logic of terms where the terms could naturally be understood as place-holders for Platonic (or Aristotelian) forms. In this first sense of [...] "form," [...] almost all logic is informal (not-formal). Understanding informal logic this way would be much too broad to be useful.|$|E
