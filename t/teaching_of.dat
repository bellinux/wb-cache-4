This opposition developed into the creation–evolution controversy involving Christian literalists in the United States objecting to the <b>teaching</b> <b>of</b> evolution in public schools. Although early objectors dismissed evolution as contradicting their interpretation of the Bible, this argument was legally invalidated when the Supreme Court ruled in Epperson v.

Without a reward that is meaningful, providing delayed or immediate gratification serves little purpose, as the reward is not a strong reinforcer of the desired behavior.|$|E
