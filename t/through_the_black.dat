5|$|The {{crew of the}} Obsidian have {{temporarily}} {{abandoned the}} vessel {{in order to allow}} it to pass through a black hole. The Obsidian's internal systems are capable of withstanding the black hole, but the station cannot shield its human inhabitants from the gravitational forces. The crew have taken refuge in a smaller craft which has been shielded, intending to return to the Obsidian when both vessels have passed <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> hole. A radiation storm has damaged the Obsidian's engine protection systems and erased its flight path, leaving the station drifting towards the black hole where it will be destroyed. Only one member of the crew has the skills necessary to return to the Obsidian and prepare it to pass <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> hole, this is the game's player character. The astronaut is forced to contend with the Obsidian's re-activated security system which has resulted in security robots being deployed, the space station's internal doors sealing and defensive laser grids becoming active. Once the player has restored power, reactivated the Obsidian's engines and reset the station's flight path, there is a limited time to teleport back to the smaller shielded craft before the Obsidian's engines carry the astronaut <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> hole without being shielded.|$|E

5|$|Emmendingen {{lies in the}} Elz valley, which winds <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Forest. The Elz {{creates a}} series of hanging valleys which {{challenge}} the passage of large bodies of troops; the rainy weather further complicated the passage through the Elz valley. The area around Riegel am Kaiserstuhl is noted for its loess and narrow transition points, which greatly influenced the battle.|$|E
5|$|The Army met little {{resistance}} as it advanced <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Forest in four columns, {{through the}} Höllental (Hölle valley), via Oberkirch, and Freudenstadt, {{and at the}} southern end of the forest, along the Rhine bank. Although prudent counsel might have advised Jourdan to establish a position on the eastern slope of the mountains, he did not; instead he pushed across the Danube plain, taking position between Rottweil and Tuttlingen.|$|E
5|$|The Habsburg and Imperial armies were {{in danger}} of encirclement, as the French pressed hard at Rastatt. Ferino moved quickly east along the shore of the Rhine; from there, an {{approach}} from the rear might have flanked the entire force. To prevent this, Charles executed an orderly withdrawal in four columns <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Forest, across the Upper Danube valley, and toward Bavaria, trying to maintain consistent contact with all flanks as each column withdrew <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Forest and the Upper Danube. By mid-July, the column encamped near Stuttgart. The third column, which included the Condé's Corps, retreated through Waldsee to Stockach, and eventually Ravensburg. The fourth Austrian column, the smallest (three battalions and four squadrons), Ludwig Wolff de la Marselle, marched the length of the Bodensee's northern shore, via Überlingen, Meersburg, Buchhorn, and the Austrian city of Bregenz.|$|E

5|$|The army {{advanced}} in four columns. First Division, the right wing, assembled at Hüningen, crossed at Basel and advanced eastward {{along the north}} shore of the Rhine toward Lake Constance. The Advanced Guard crossed at Kehl, and Vandamme led it north-east through the mountains via Freudenstadt. This column eventually became the left flank. It was followed across the Rhine, also at Kehl, by the II. Division. The Third Division and the Reserve also crossed at Kehl, and then divided into two columns, III. Division traveling <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Forest via Oberkirch, and the Reserve, with most of the artillery and horse, further south via the valley at Freiburg im Breisgau, where they would find more forage, and then over the mountains past the Titisee to Löffingen and Hüfingen.|$|E

5|$|As winter broke on 1 March 1799, General Jean Baptiste Jourdan and his 25,000-man Army of the Danube {{crossed the}} Rhine at Kehl. The Army of the Danube met little {{resistance}} as it advanced <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Forest and eventually took a flanking {{position on the}} north shore of Lake Constance. Instructed to block the Austrians from access to the Swiss alpine passes, Jourdan planned to isolate the armies of the Coalition in Germany from allies in northern Italy, and prevent them from assisting one another. His was a preemptive strike. By crossing the Rhine in early March, Jourdan acted before Archduke Charles' army could be reinforced by Austria's Russian allies, who had agreed to send 60,000 seasoned soldiers and their more-seasoned commander, Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov. Furthermore, if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland, they could not only prevent the Austrians from transferring troops between northern Italy and southwestern Germany, but could use the routes to move their own forces between the two theaters.|$|E
5|$|At the Battle of Amberg on 24 August and the Battle of Würzburg on 3 September, Charles {{defeated}} Jourdan's northern {{army and}} compelled the French army to retreat, eventually {{to the west}} bank of the Rhine. With Jourdan neutralized and retreating into France, Charles left Franz von Werneck to watch the Army of Sambre and Meuse, making sure it did not try to recover a foothold on the east bank of the Rhine. He then turned on Moreau, who belatedly began to withdraw from southern Germany. Although Moreau briskly repulsed Latour at the Battle of Biberach, he did not make it <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Forest before Charles was able to cut French access to the Bruchsal and Kehl crossings. At the battle of Battle of Emmendingen and the Battle of Schliengen in October, Charles forced Moreau to retreat south. During the winter the Austrians reduced the French bridgeheads in the Siege of Kehl and the Siege of Hüningen, and forced Moreau's army back to France. Despite Charles' success in Germany, Austria lost the war in Italy to a new French army commander, Napoleon Bonaparte, which resulted in the Peace of Campo Formio.|$|E
5|$|Moreau {{preferred}} to retreat <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Forest via the Kinzig River valley, but Nauendorf blocked that route. Instead, Saint-Cyr's column {{led the way}} over the Höllenthal, breaking through the Austrian net at Neustadt and reaching Freiburg im Breisgau on 12 October. Moreau's supply trains took a route down the Wiese River to Hüningen. The French general wanted to reach Kehl farther down the Rhine, but by this time Charles barred the way with 35,000 soldiers. In order for his trains to get away, Moreau needed to hold his position for a few days. The Battle of Emmendingen was fought on 19 October, the 32,000 French losing 1,000 killed and wounded plus 1,800 men and two guns captured. The Austrians sustained 1,000 casualties out of 28,000 troops engaged. Beaupuy and Wartensleben were both killed. There was some fighting on the 20th, but when Charles advanced on 21 October the French were gone.|$|E

5|$|News {{arrived from}} eastern Albania that the Ottomans had {{initiated}} massacres in the area. The pope was distressed by this {{and called on}} the Christian princes of Europe to aid Skanderbeg. Soon after, Mehmed's men marched into Albania. Unlike his father Murad II, Mehmed considered {{that the only way}} Albania could be conquered would be through isolating Krujë, the main Albanian fortress, by reducing Skanderbeg's manpower, supplies, and political and moral backing. Afterwards, Krujë would be put under siege. The Ottoman campaign was thus sent in two directions: one through the Shkumbin River valley and another <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Drin River valley. Both fielded men in the frontier regions, right and left of both valleys, and would engage in massacring the local populations, raiding inhabited areas, and burning every village which offered resistance. The populations thus decided to flee into safe areas.|$|E
5|$|Shephard soon {{encounters}} more stranded Marine {{units in}} {{the wreckage of the}} base, and tries to break <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>black</b> operations units to reach an escape point past the facility's storage unit, but meets heavy resistance from both Race X and the black operations units. A surviving Black Mesa security guard reveals to Shephard that the black operators intend to detonate a tactical nuclear weapon in the base, thereby totally sealing it off and killing everything in it. After successfully neutralizing the guarding black operations unit, Shephard disarms the device and proceeds to the nearby storage areas, intent on escape. However, the G-Man rearms the device as Shephard departs. The storage unit has become a thick battleground between Race X and the black operation units, and although Shephard manages to evade them, he is informed by another security guard that something very large is coming through an alien portal blocking the exit path.|$|E
5|$|By mid-summer, the {{situation}} looked grim for the Coalition: Wartensleben continued to withdraw to the east-northeast despite Charles' orders to unite with him. It appeared probable that Jourdan or Moreau would outmaneuver Charles by driving {{a wedge between}} his force and that of Wartensleben. At Neresheim on 11 August, Moreau crushed Charles' force, forcing him to withdraw further east. At last, however, with this loss, Wartensleben recognized the danger and changed direction, moving his corps to join at Charles' northern flank. At Amberg on 24 August, Charles inflicted a defeat on the French, yet that same day, his commanders lost a battle to the French at Friedberg. Regardless, the tide had turned in the Coalition's favor. Both Jourdan and Moreau had overstretched their lines, moving far into the German states, and were separated too far from each other for one to offer the other aid or security. The Coalition's concentration of troops forced a wider wedge between the two armies of Jourdan and Moreau, similar to what the French had tried to do to Charles and Wartensleben. As the French withdrew toward the Rhine, Charles and Wartensleben pressed forward. On 3 September at Würzburg, Jourdan attempted to halt his retreat. Once Moreau received word of the French defeat, he had to withdraw from southern Germany. He pulled his troops back <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Forest, with Ferino supervising the rear guard. The Austrian corps commanded by Latour drew too close to Moreau at Biberach and lost 4,000 men taken as prisoners, some standards and artillery, after which Latour followed at a more prudent distance.|$|E

5|$|The {{summer and}} fall {{included}} various conflicts throughout the southern territories of the German states as the armies of the Coalition and the armies of the Directory sought to flank each other. By mid-summer, the situation looked grim for the Coalition: Wartensleben continued to withdraw to the east-northeast despite Charles' orders to unite with him. It appeared probable that Jourdan or Moreau would succeed in flanking Charles or driving a wedge between his force and that of Wartensleben. At Neresheim on 11 August, Moreau crushed Charles' force, forcing him to withdraw further east. At last, however, Wartensleben recognized the danger and changed direction, moving his corps to join at Charles' northern flank.

As the French withdrew toward the Rhine, Charles and Wartensleben pressed forward. On 3 September at Würzburg, Jourdan attempted unsuccessfully to halt the retreat; subsequently at the Battle of Limburg, Charles pushed {{him back to the}} Rhine. Once Moreau received word of this defeat, he had to withdraw from southern Germany. He pulled his troops back <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Black</b> Forest, with Ferino supervising the rear guard. The Austrian corps commanded by Latour drew too close to Moreau at Biberach and lost 4,000 prisoners, some standards and artillery, and Latour followed at a more sensible distance. The two armies clashed again at Emmendingen, where Wartensleben was mortally wounded in the Coalition victory. After Emmendingen, the French withdrew to the south and west, and formed for battle by Schliengen.|$|E
