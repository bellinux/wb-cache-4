5|$|In {{secondary}} adrenal insufficiency, a dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis {{leads to}} decreased {{stimulation of the}} adrenal cortex. Apart from suppression of the axis by glucocorticoid therapy, {{the most common cause}} of secondary adrenal insufficiency are tumors <b>that</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the pituitary gland. This type of adrenal insufficiency usually does not affect the production of mineralocorticoids, which are under regulation of the renin-angiotensin system instead.|$|E

5|$|The major {{criteria}} include {{liver disease}} with portal hypertension; kidney failure; {{the absence of}} shock, infection, recent treatment with medications <b>that</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> function of the kidney (nephrotoxins), and fluid losses; the absence of sustained improvement in kidney function despite treatment with 1.5 litres of intravenous normal saline; the absence of proteinuria (protein in the urine); and, the absence of kidney disease or obstruction of kidney outflow as seen on ultrasound.|$|E
5|$|Additional factors <b>that</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> BFO are a {{translation}} {{made at the}} ground station between the reception and processing of the signal (which is monitored and can be factored in) and a fixed bias in the aircraft and satellite oscillators due to drift and ageing (which can be calibrated by measures recorded when the aircraft's location and speed were known). At 2:40 and 6:14, ground-to-aircraft phone calls were made that were unanswered by the cockpit but acknowledged by the SDU. The signals associated with these calls could not be analysed to generate a BTO value, but BFO values of these signals can {{be considered in the}} analysis with the other BTO and BFO data.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the third}} week of development, the embryo is a three-layered disc, covered with ectoderm, {{mesoderm}} and endoderm. A tube-like formation develops in the midline, called the notochord. The notochord releases extracellular molecules <b>that</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> transformation of the overlying ectoderm into nervous tissue. The neural tube, forming from the ectoderm, contains CSF prior {{to the development of the}} choroid plexuses. The open neuropores of the neural tube close after the first month of development, and CSF pressure gradually increases.|$|E

5|$|During {{conversations with}} characters, Mass Effect employs a radial command menu, called Dialogue Wheel, where the player's {{dialogue}} options depend on wheel direction. The {{left side of}} the wheel is normally reserved for options that will continue the conversation in depth, while options on the right side tend to move the conversation towards completion. Responses at the top are generally more polite and selfless, while those at the bottom are more aggressive and hostile. Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard and affect the player's chosen morality. Morality is measured by Paragon (charm) and Renegade (intimidate) points. These points allow the player to develop talents <b>that</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> availability of new special Paragon and Renegade dialogue options with significant impact in the game.|$|E
5|$|In the game, {{the player}} takes {{the role of}} Makoto Ishihara, a college student who attends a seminar camp on an island {{together}} with three other students; he also befriends three other people who he meets on the island. The game takes place {{over the course of}} a week, and consists of the player reading the story, occasionally making choices <b>that</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> direction of the plot; on the sixth day, one of the female characters dies, and the game moves back in time to the beginning, letting the player use knowledge from the first set of six days to make new choices, to try to prevent the character's death.|$|E
5|$|Mutations <b>that</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> rate or {{the extent}} of RCL {{insertion}} into the A-sheet can cause the serpin to undergo its S to R conformational change before having engaged a protease. Since a serpin can only make this conformational change once, the resulting misfired serpin is inactive and unable to properly control its target protease. Similarly, mutations that promote inappropriate transition to the monomeric latent state cause disease by {{reducing the amount of}} active inhibitory serpin. For example, the disease-linked antithrombin variants wibble and wobble, both promote formation of the latent state.|$|E

5|$|Planning for dental {{implants}} {{focuses on}} the general health condition of the patient, the local health condition of the mucous membranes and the jaws and the shape, size, and position of {{the bones of the}} jaws, adjacent and opposing teeth. There are few health conditions that absolutely preclude placing implants although there are certain conditions that can increase the risk of failure. Those with poor oral hygiene, heavy smokers and diabetics are all at greater risk for a variant of gum disease that affects implants called peri-implantitis, increasing the chance of long-term failures. Long-term steroid use, osteoporosis and other diseases <b>that</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> bones can increase the risk of early failure of implants.|$|E

The Division of Supreme Court Administration is staffed by clerks who oversee the fiscal management of the courts, including payroll and expenses. In addition, the division is responsible for maintaining the Court's records and assists in its administrative functions.|$|E
5|$|The game follows Cocoro Fuyukawa and Satoru Yukidoh, who {{frequently}} experience {{a phenomenon that}} makes their minds switch place with each other, putting them in the other person's body. Cocoro is stuck in a blizzard in an emergency cabin on a mountain together with three other people, while Satoru is in an institute {{for the treatment of}} mentally ill criminals, having lost his memory. The player takes the role of Cocoro, and reads the story while occasionally making choices <b>that</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> course of the story, attempting to keep her alive for seven days; after doing so, they are able to play through the seven days from Satoru's perspective as well.|$|E

5|$|The game {{is divided}} into six environments, each {{representing}} a different setting from the film. To accomplish {{the objective of the}} game, the player must guide E.T. into the wells. Once all items found in a well are collected, the player must levitate E.T. out of them. An icon at the top of each screen represents the current area, each area enabling the player to perform different actions. Antagonists include a scientist who takes E.T. for observation and an FBI agent who chases the alien to confiscate one of the collected telephone pieces, or candy. The game offers diverse difficulty settings <b>that</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> number and speed of humans present, and the conditions needed to accomplish the objective.|$|E

They have invaded police stations to demand that police investigate these matters, and other things <b>that</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> community such as corruption. India’s police are notoriously corrupt and sometimes only {{the threat of a}} full-scale female riot will get them to act.|$|E
5|$|The major {{determinant}} is PSORS1, {{which probably}} accounts for 35%–50% of psoriasis heritability. It controls genes <b>that</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> immune system or encode skin proteins that are overabundant with psoriasis. PSORS1 {{is located on}} chromosome 6 in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), which controls important immune functions. Three genes in the PSORS1 locus have a strong association with psoriasis vulgaris: HLA-C variant HLA-Cw6, which encodes a MHC class I protein; CCHCR1, variant WWC, which encodes a coiled protein that is overexpressed in psoriatic epidermis; and CDSN, variant allele 5, which encodes corneodesmosin, a protein which is expressed in the granular and cornified layers of the epidermis and upregulated in psoriasis.|$|E

There are no specific conditions relating the skin <b>that</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> breed, but they can be affected by common dog related conditions such as parasites and mange. Scotties typically live from 11 to 13 years.|$|E
5|$|Animal testing, {{also known}} as animal experimentation, animal {{research}} and in vivo testing, {{is the use of}} non-human animals in experiments that seek to control the variables <b>that</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> behavior or biological system under study. This approach can be contrasted with field studies in which animals are observed in their natural environments. Experimental research with animals is usually conducted in universities, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, defense establishments and commercial facilities that provide animal-testing services to industry. The focus of animal testing varies on a continuum from pure research, focusing on developing fundamental knowledge of an organism, to applied research, which may focus on answering some question of great practical importance, such as finding a cure for a disease. Examples of applied research include testing disease treatments, breeding, defense research and toxicology, including cosmetics testing. In education, animal testing is sometimes a component of biology or psychology courses. The practice is regulated to varying degrees in different countries.|$|E
5|$|For 10days, Myanmar's {{government}} did not report about the cyclone, which usually under-reports on storms <b>that</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> country. There was also little to no advanced warning of the storm. The storm destroyed over 2,650homes and severely damaged another 1,385, leaving around 25,000people homeless, mostly in Pauktaw. Four hospitals in the region were heavily damaged, including the one in Sittwe that was unable to continue normal operations. About 300schools were damaged or destroyed, including 44 in Sittwe. The storm also damaged or destroyed 133religious buildings and 176government buildings. Across the region, high winds knocked down telephone lines and disrupted power supply. About 2,000cattle were killed, and many rice mills were knocked down, causing a 70% increase of food prices. Transportation was disrupted after roads were washed away, which contributed to food shortages, while damaged wells caused water shortages. During the storm, 84ships were lost at sea, {{in addition to a}} lost ocean liner, while the main harbor at Sittwe was damaged, along with several fishing piers.|$|E
