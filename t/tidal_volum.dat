40|$|Summary. Adelie {{penguins}} (Pygoscelis adeliae) {{experience a}} wide range of ambient temperatures (T,) in their natural habitat. We examined body temperature (Tb), oxygen consumption (l) o~), carbon dioxide production (V co 2), evaporative water loss (rhH 2 o), and ventilation at T ~ from [...] 20 to 30 ~ Body temperature did not change significantly be-tween- 20 and 20 ~ (mean Tb= 39. 3 ~ Tb increased slightly to 40. 1 ~ at Ta = 30 ~ Both l) o~ and l/co 2 were constant and minimal at Ta between- 10 and 20 ~ with only minor increases at- 20 and 30 ~ The minimal 1 /o 2 of adult penguins (mean mass 4. 007 kg) was 0. 0112 ml/[g-min], equivalent to a metabolic heat production (MHP) of 14. 9 Watt. The respiratory exchange ratio was approximately 0. 7 at all Ta. Values of rhn 2 o were low at low T~, but increased to 0. 21 g/rain at 30 ~ equivalent to 0. 3 % of body mass/h. Dry conductance increased 3. 5 -fold between- 20 and 30 ~ Evaporative heat loss (EHL) comprised about 5 % of MHP at low Ta, rising to 47 % of MHP at Ta = 30 ~ The means of ventilation parameters (tidal volume [VT], respiration frequency [f], minute volume [l/I], and oxygen extraction leon]) were fairly stable between- 20 and 10 ~ (VT did not change significantly over the entire Ta range). However, there was considerable inter- and intra-individual variation in ventilation patterns. At Ta = 20 - 30 ~ f increased 7 -fold over the minimal value of 7. 6 breaths/rain, and 1 ~I showed a similar change. Eo ~ fell from 28 - 35 % at low Ta to 6 % at Ta= 30 ~ Abbreviations: C thermal conductance; EHL evaporative heat loss; Eo 2 oxygen extraction;frespiratory frequency; MHP metabolic heat production; rh~i~o evaporative water loss; LCT lower critical temperature; RE respiratory exchange ratio; T. ambient temperature; Tb body temperature; 1 /o 2 rate of oxygen consumption; l) co 2 rate of carbon dioxide production; l? ~ inspiratory minute volume; VT <b>tidal</b> <b>volum...</b>|$|E
