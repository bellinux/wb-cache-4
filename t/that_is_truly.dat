5|$|Peter Ackroyd {{believes}} {{that it is impossible}} to paraphrase the content of the poem; the poem is too abstract to describe the events and the action that make up the poem's narrative structure. However, the philosophical basis for the poem can be explained since the discourse on time is connected to the ideas within St. Augustine's Confessions. As such, there is an emphasis on the present moment as being the only time period that really matters, because the past cannot be changed and the future is unknown. The poem emphasizes that memory must be abandoned to understand the current world, and humans must realize that the universe is based on order. The poem also describes that although consciousness cannot be bound within time, humans cannot actually escape from time on their own. The scene beneath London is filled with the time-bound people who are similar to the spiritually empty populace of The Hollow Men; they are empty because they do not understand the Logos or the order of the universe. The conclusion of the poem emphasizes that God is the only one <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> able to exist out of time and have knowledge of all times and places, but humankind is still capable of redemption through belief in Him and His ability to save them from the bounds of the material universe.|$|E

500|$|A {{retrospective}} feature by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's program Good Game highlighted Red Alarm {{as one of}} the Virtual Boy's most visually impressive games due to its polygonal graphics. The outlet praised it as one of {{the most}} entertaining titles on the console. Video game database AllGame gave the game a two and a half out of five rating, noting how the graphics made it difficult to play. The review stated that the design of the graphics [...] "makes structures hard to see because there is empty space between the lines defining them. Add multiple enemy fighters and ground defenses into the mix, and it can be very difficult to navigate your ship, especially when you are trying to fight back!" [...] The review concluded that the developers [...] "have created a very detailed setting for which to fight in. Walls have faces stretching out of them like a scene from The Abyss, there are several interesting bosses to combat, and you'll even hear some speech. Deep down there is a fine shooter that is simply hard to enjoy due to the limitations of the hardware... and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> a shame." [...] In 2008, Kolan called it [...] "a really competent shooter" [...] with strong visuals and gameplay. The following year, Damien McFerran of Retro Gamer summarized Red Alarm as [...] "pretty good fun to play", although inferior to Star Fox. However, Wireds Chris Kohler later opined that the game [...] "kind of sucked".|$|E

[...] Another review in the same paper also commended the [...] "simple beauty of the story itself" [...] and also praised Beban's performance:"George Beban, who has the difficult role of Pietro Donnetti, gives a piece of character work <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> marvelous. [...] This artist has developed mimicry to its highest form of expression. [...] His mobile countenance mirrored every emotion so perfectly, each varying mood was portrayed so truly, that it was hard to believe that this man was naught but a pantomimist.

2500|$|The {{standard}} {{solution to the}} measurement problem is the [...] "Orthodox" [...] or [...] "Cophenhagen" [...] interpretation, which claims that the wave function collapses {{as the result of}} a measurement by an observer or apparatus external to the quantum system. An alternative interpretation, the Many-worlds Interpretation, was first described by Hugh Everett in 1957 (where it was called the relative state interpretation, the name Many-worlds was coined by Bryce Seligman DeWitt starting in the 1960s and finalized in the 70s). His formalism of quantum mechanics denied that a measurement requires a wave collapse, instead suggesting that all <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> necessary of a measurement is that a quantum connection is formed between the particle, the measuring device, and the observer.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the most}} widely publicized {{confrontations}} saw Lowell debate Lodge, the League's most prominent opponent, in Boston’s Symphony Hall on March 19, 1919, with Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge presiding. That debate proved gentlemanly, since Lowell believed that the resolution of the policy dispute required Wilson and Lodge to compromise. Lowell had sharper exchanges with the die-hard Republican isolationist Senator William Borah of Idaho. Lowell repeatedly argued that George Washington’s Farewell Address and its stricture against entangling alliances held no relevance for the present. Senator Borah saw a lack of patriotism: [...] "There are a vast number of people supporting the league of nations who never let an opportunity go by of belittling...everything <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> American: and Dr. Lowell is one of them."

2500|$|GameSpy's Tom Chick {{scored the}} PC version 3 out of 5, writing [...] "The Thing starts out strong, but it's {{the sort of}} game you don't have to feel bad about not finishing.

[...] Tom Ham scored both the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions 4 out of 5, writing [...] "not only is the game a solid action-adventure frenzy, it also manages to tell a tale <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>truly</b> chilling. Combined with topnotch graphics, incredible use of sound, and a very cool trust/fear interface, The Thing manages to do what so many movie licensed game have failed to do -- succeed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reviewing Blink, The Baltimore Sun dubbed Gladwell [...] "the most {{original}} American [...] journalist {{since the}} young Tom Wolfe".

[...] The Economist called Outliers [...] "a compelling read with an important message". David Leonhardt wrote in The New York Times Book Review: [...] "In the vast world of nonfiction writing, Malcolm Gladwell is as close to a singular talent as exists today" [...] and Outliers [...] "leaves you mulling over its inventive theories for days afterward". Ian Sample wrote in The Guardian: [...] "Brought together, the pieces form a dazzling record of Gladwell's art.
