2500|$|Over the years, St. John's College {{has been}} ranked {{everywhere}} from third, second, and first tier, {{to one of}} the [...] "Top 25" [...] liberal arts colleges. Yet, <b>the</b> <b>curious</b> <b>thing</b> is: We haven't changed. Our mission and our methods have been virtually constant for almost 60 years. So {{when it comes to the}} U.S. News & World Report rankings, we would rather be ourselves and have our college speak for itself, than be subjected to fluctuating outside analysis.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cause of}} the {{explosion}} was later {{said to be the}} failure of a safety valve (called a [...] "fusible plug") to blow when the water level in the boiler fell too low. [...] Just how this occurred was not quite certain. [...] The vessel had been recently inspected, and while she was 16 years old at the time, she had been rebuilt in 1887 just six years before. [...] <b>The</b> <b>curious</b> <b>thing</b> about this explosion was that it seemed to fit a pattern of explosions occurring not while racing but rather just after or before the vessel was coming in for a landing, {{as in the case of}} the Gazelle and the Senator.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 July, the Serbian government, expecting an Austrian {{declaration}} of war the next day, mobilized while Austria broke off diplomatic relations. The British Ambassador to Austria-Hungary reported to London: [...] "War is thought imminent. Wildest enthusiasm prevails in Vienna." [...] Asquith {{wrote in a letter}} to Venetia Stanley that he was worried that:"Russia is trying to drag us in. The news this morning is that Serbia had capitulated on the main points, but it is very doubtful if any reservations will be accepted by Austria, who is resolved upon a complete and final humiliation. <b>The</b> <b>curious</b> <b>thing</b> is that on many, if not most of the points, Austria has a good and Serbia a very bad case. But the Austrians are quite the stupidest people in Europe (as the Italians are the most perfidious), and there is a brutality about their mode of procedure, which will make most people think that is a case of a big Power wantonly bullying a little one. Anyhow, it is the most dangerous situation of the last 40 years." [...] In order to stop a war, the Permanent Secretary of the British Foreign Office, Sir Arthur Nicolson, suggested again that a conference be held in London chaired by Britain, Germany, Italy and France to resolve the dispute between Austria and Serbia.|$|E

60|$|What was <b>the</b> <b>curiousest</b> <b>thing</b> he had seen? Well! He didn't know. He couldn't momently name {{what was}} <b>the</b> <b>curiousest</b> <b>thing</b> he had seen--unless {{it was a}} Unicorn, and he see him once at a Fair. But supposing a young gentleman not eight year old was to run away with a fine young woman of seven, might I think that a queer start? Certainly. Then that was a start as he himself had had his blessed eyes on, and he had cleaned the shoes they run away in--and they was so little that he couldn't get his hand into 'em.|$|R

6000|$|The girl smiled significantly. [...] "I guess that's not astonishing. She wears it {{low down}} on her neck--and <b>the</b> <b>curious</b> <b>thing</b> is that it lay by and she never looked at it for ever so long." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>curious</b> <b>thing</b> is, {{that it was}} at Robert's {{suggestion}} that that particular poem was reprinted there (it never had appeared in England), though 'Barkis was willing'; I had no manner of objection. I never have to justice.|$|E
6000|$|... "True," [...] replied Mrs. Gray; [...] "but {{you will}} not wish to devote so great a portion of time to them.

6000|$|Miss Jardine laughed. [...] "I was {{interested}} in the man. He told us a good deal about himself, although it would have embarrassed him if he'd guessed. <b>The</b> <b>curious</b> <b>thing</b> is that he imagines he's practical, while he's really a reckless sentimentalist." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To begin with, {{they were}} people who had {{traveled}} and knew the world; I know the North and some Canadian cities, but there I stop. <b>The</b> <b>curious</b> <b>thing</b> was, they didn't talk like strangers; I felt I'd got their point of view." ...|$|E

60|$|When I {{came here}} before, I {{was with a}} party of ladies and gentlemen.
