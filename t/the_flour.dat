The farmers of the southern plains developed a variety of hardy red winter wheat suitable for bread flour, and the Kansas City area gained prominence in milling.

5|$|The small burns {{that are}} tributaries to the East Burn {{contributed to the}} {{draining}} of the lands of Dunnikier Estate. The burn emerges from a deep-set culvert to flow under the Victoria Viaduct, down a deep gorge, through the site of Hutchison's Flour Mills before running parallel to the harbour wall and into the sea. From the mid-19th century, the Hutchison's buildings became a significant landmark adjacent to the burn. <b>The</b> <b>flour</b> millers chose this area for its railway connection which linked the main station to the harbour, rather than for the {{need to use the}} burn to power the mills. The West (or Tiel) Burn, was also important, providing power for textile mills.

The mill owners in Linktown also made use of the burn.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota's {{earliest}} industries were fur {{trading and}} agriculture. The city of Minneapolis grew around <b>the</b> <b>flour</b> mills powered by St. Anthony Falls. Although {{less than one}} percent of the population is now employed in the agricultural sector, it remains a major part of the state's economy, ranking sixth in the nation in the value of products sold. The state is the U.S.'s largest producer of sugar beets, sweet corn, and green peas for processing, and farm-raised turkeys. Minnesota is also a large producer of corn and soybeans. Minnesota has the most food cooperatives per capita in the United States. Forestry remains strong, including logging, pulpwood processing and paper production, and forest products manufacturing. Minnesota was famous for its soft-ore mines, which produced a significant portion of the world's iron ore for over a century. Although the high-grade ore is now depleted, taconite mining continues, using processes developed locally to save the industry. In 2004, the state produced 75 percent of the country's usable iron ore. The mining boom created the port of Duluth which continues to be important for shipping ore, coal, and agricultural products. The manufacturing sector now includes technology and biomedical firms in addition to the older food processors and heavy industry. The nation's first indoor shopping mall was Edina's Southdale Center and its largest is Bloomington's Mall of America.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Treculia africana {{seeds are}} used {{in a variety of}} foods like porridges, {{pastries}} and weaning food formulations. These food applications require processed seed flour. In processing, parboiling is employed for easy dehusking of the seeds for improved appeal of the products. This study was carried out on four groups of parboiled and native T. africana seed <b>flours</b> to investigate <b>the</b> effect of parboiling on the composition and physicochemical properties of <b>the</b> <b>flours.</b> Results indicate that parboiling had significant effect on the composition and properties of T. africana seed <b>flours</b> though <b>the</b> effect varied from one tree source to another. Higher yields of flour were obtained with parboiled (61. 26 - 87. 65 %) compared with native (52. 84 - 74. 02 %). The proximate composition, inorganic minerals, tannins and phytates levels of <b>the</b> <b>flours</b> of <b>the</b> parboiled were significantly lower than those of <b>the</b> <b>flours</b> of unparboiled. <b>Flours</b> of <b>the</b> parboiled seeds exhibited lower water absorption capacity and lower freeze-thaw stability than <b>the</b> <b>flours</b> of <b>the</b> unparboiled seeds.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study the functional properties and proximate composition of three different flours prepared from cactus pear cladodes. Immature cactus pear cladodes were dried at 60 °C, 70 °C and 80 °C. <b>The</b> <b>flours</b> were analyzed for chemical composition, amino acid profile, fatty acid composition, functional properties and color.

Nevertheless, during the drying at 80 °C, a reduction of the water holding capacity (55 %) was observed, along with a reduction of the green color intensity (34 %) - characteristic of cactus pear.

40|$|ABSTRACT Yacon (Smallanthus sonchifolius) is a {{tuberous}} root from the Andean {{region in the}} South America rich em water, fructooligosaccharides and phenolic compounds, {{some of which are}} natural antioxidants and may help prevent the deleterious action of free radicals in the body. The yacon has attracted much attention due to their potential health benefits to humans. In this study the levels of total phenolics, tannins, phenolic acids, and total antioxidant activity were measured in the peel and pulp of yacon tubers both in <b>the</b> fresh and <b>flour</b> forms. <b>The</b> <b>flours</b> of yacon presented higher concentrations of total phenolics and tannins, especially peel <b>flour.</b> <b>The</b> yacon pulp <b>flour</b> stood out as the main source of phenolic acids, mainly caffeic and chlorogenic acid.
