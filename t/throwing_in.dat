5|$|A right-arm fast bowler, Halcombe {{moved from}} South Australia to Western Australia after two seasons {{due to a}} lack of opportunity. With more regular {{selection}} on the field, Halcombe was considered a leading contender to become his state's first ever representative for Australia in Test cricket due to his express pace, but his career was derailed after he was no balled for <b>throwing</b> <b>in</b> two consecutive matches in early 1930.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Allen became {{chairman}} of the MCC's Cricket Committee. The committee looked at ways to improve cricket, for example analysing whether reducing {{the size of the}} ball would help bowlers. Allen also began to pursue bowlers with illegal bowling actions; commentators were aware that this was a growing issue but no action had been taken, and Allen took the lead. Three English bowlers were no-balled for <b>throwing</b> <b>in</b> 1959 and another five in 1960. Geoff Griffin, a bowler who toured England with the South African team in 1960, was perceived to have a suspect action; when the bowler was no-balled for <b>throwing</b> <b>in</b> a Test match, the South African press suggested that Allen had played a prominent part. Later that year, Allen met Bradman, Australia's representative at the Imperial Cricket Conference (ICC); the pair wanted to ensure that bowling actions would be fair in future, and the ICC agreed to take action. When Australia toured England in 1961, no bowlers whose actions had been questioned were included in either team. Allen later took the lead in re-drafting the law on throwing.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} superb club cricket {{performances}} removed {{any doubt that}} Wills would play for Victoria in the next intercolonial against New South Wales, scheduled for March 1872 on the MCG. Before the game, representatives from both colonies met and entered into a bilateral agreement designed to call Wills. When he opened the bowling, Wills became the first cricketer to be called for <b>throwing</b> <b>in</b> a top-class Australian match. He was called two more times in two overs, and did not bowl again. He was again no-balled when a Victorian side under his captaincy lost to a combined XIII from New South Wales, Tasmania and South Australia late in 1872.|$|E
5|$|Crossland {{remained}} in Lancashire after his expulsion from their county side, {{playing for a}} variety of club sides; East Lancashire from 1885 to 1889, Church and Oswaldtwistle in 1890 and Colne in 1891. He also worked in a coal pit at Clayton-le-Moors. He died on 26 September 1903 in Blackburn. His burial was paid for by Lancashire County Cricket Club. <b>Throwing</b> <b>in</b> cricket came to a head {{in the early part of}} the twentieth century when the careers of a number of professional bowlers came to a close, most notably those of Lancashire's Arthur Mold, Somerset's Ted Tyler and Leicestershire's Frederic Geeson.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1896 tour, the English {{authorities}} realised action {{had to be}} taken. Jim Phillips, an Australian-born umpire who journeyed {{each year}} between his native country and England, travelled to Australia with an English touring team in 1897–98. During two of the matches he umpired, Phillips no-balled Ernie Jones for throwing. Upon returning to England for the 1898 season, Phillips also called C. B. Fry, a prominent amateur cricketer and all-round sportsman, for throwing. This was the second of three occasions in 1898 that Fry was no-balled. Other umpires, following Phillips' lead, no-balled Fry and Frank Hopkins. Two further bowlers, albeit not famous cricketers, were called for <b>throwing</b> <b>in</b> 1899.|$|E

5|$|However, the Germans {{launched}} a counterattack at 03:15 on 16 December, <b>throwing</b> <b>in</b> {{men from the}} 6th Parachute Regiment, sent by Herr to the 26th Panzer Division to relieve the exhausted 9th Panzergrenadier Regiment. These troops had arrived late that evening after a long journey. Supported by tanks, they attacked the right-hand New Zealand positions held by the 21st NZ Battalion, but were held off and had retired by daylight. Meanwhile, even before the German counterattack had been repelled, the 20th Regiment had attacked toward Orsogna with two squadrons of Sherman tanks. Under intense artillery and anti-tank fire, the tanks and infantry became separated and the tanks became a target rather than a threat.|$|E
5|$|In 1959–60, {{the season}} {{started with a}} Test trial between the XIs of Lindwall and Benaud. Meckiff claimed a match total of 4/90 for Lindwall's men and was {{selected}} for the Test tour of Pakistan and India. Before the team departed, Meckiff demonstrated his new bowling action, which used a rigid left arm during the run-up, before swinging the arm over during the delivery stride. Over the next two years, sceptics and sporting opponents mostly regarded his action as fair, and said so in public. He was not called for <b>throwing</b> <b>in</b> either India or Pakistan, meaning that he had played in five nations without being sanctioned.|$|E
5|$|In {{the face}} of a looming crisis in his career, Wills {{admitted}} to <b>throwing</b> <b>in</b> his 1870–71 Australian Cricketers' Guide, and in so doing taunted his enemies to stop him. Nonetheless, he was made Victoria XI captain for the March 1871 intercolonial against New South Wales, held at the Albert Ground. Wills' first innings top score of 39* was offset by his drunken behaviour in the field and his apparent reluctance to bowl for fear of being called. Victoria won by 48 runs. Not long after, Wills was no-balled for throwing {{for the first time in}} a club match. Rumour spread that the umpire had conspired against him with the opposing club's owner.|$|E

He won seven consecutive national titles in the indoor weight throw from 1941 to 1947, a streak that remained unparalleled until Lance Deal won eight {{times in a row}} starting in 1989.

5|$|The {{next day}} in Mumbai, two motorcycle-borne MNS {{supporters}} hurled bottles at Amitabh Bachchan's bungalow at Juhu. A group of MNS workers barged inside the booking office of the Grant Road railway station, damaged the booking office windows and tore off posters of a newly released Bhojpuri film put up there. Party workers resorted to stone <b>throwing</b> <b>in</b> some parts of Kandivli, a North-Mumbai suburb that has a sizeable North Indian lower middle-class population. In the Central-Mumbai suburb of Bandra, a clash ensued when MNS workers tried to plant party flags at an open market dominated by North Indians.|$|E
5|$|Born in Waukegan, Illinois, Graham's first {{interest}} {{growing up}} was music. Encouraged by his parents, {{both of whom}} were music teachers, he took up several instruments: the piano, violin, cornet and French horn. Graham also excelled in athletics, and attended Northwestern University on a basketball scholarship in 1940. There he played on the varsity basketball team as a freshman and continued to study music. Graham did not take up football until his sophomore year, when Northwestern coach Pappy Waldorf saw him <b>throwing</b> <b>in</b> an intramural game and invited him to practice with the team. Northwestern's coaches were impressed with his running and passing, and Waldorf convinced him to sign up. Although football became Graham's primary sport, he also played baseball and continued on the basketball team. As a senior, he was named a first-team basketball All-American, part of a squad selected by news outlets comprising the best players at each position.|$|E
5|$|Ian Meckiff (born 6 January 1935) is {{a former}} cricketer who {{represented}} Australia in 18 Tests between 1957 and 1963. A left-arm fast bowler, he {{is best known for}} two matters that were unrelated to his skill as a player: He was the batsman run out by Joe Solomon in 1960, causing the first Tied Test in cricket history; and in December 1963, his career was sensationally ended when he was called for <b>throwing</b> <b>in</b> the First Test against South Africa by Australian umpire Col Egar. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, there had been a media frenzy about the perceived prevalence of illegal bowling actions in world cricket. The controversy and speculation that dogged Meckiff in the years preceding his final match caused sections of the cricket community to believe that he had been made a scapegoat by the Australian cricket authorities to prove their intent to stamp out throwing.|$|E

5|$|While Rokossovsky's Central Front {{continued}} its offensive against the German Second Army, which had by now been substantially reinforced with fresh divisions, the renewed German offensive towards Kharkov took it by surprise. On 7 March, Manstein {{made the decision}} to press on towards Kharkov, despite the coming of the spring thaw. Instead of attacking east of Kharkov, however, Manstein decided to orient the attack towards the west of Kharkov and then encircle it from the north. The Großdeutschland Panzergrenadier Division had also returned to the front, and threw its weight into the attack, threatening to split the 69th Army and the remnants of the 3rd Tank Army. Between 8–9 March, the SS Panzer Corps completed its drive north, splitting the 69th and 40th Soviet Armies, and on 9 March it turned east to complete its encirclement. Despite attempts by the Stavka to curtail the German advance by <b>throwing</b> <b>in</b> the freshly released 19th Rifle Division and 186th Tank Brigade, the German drive continued.|$|E
5|$|Born {{into the}} Bundjalung people at Yulgilbar on the Clarence River in {{northern}} New South Wales, Marsh first {{made an impression}} as a professional runner, travelling to Sydney and then competing interstate, winning races as a sprinter and a hurdler. While in Sydney, Marsh began competing in the local club cricket competition and his action quickly came under scrutiny. He was first no-balled for <b>throwing</b> <b>in</b> 1897, {{but it was not}} until 1900 that he came to prominence in a trial match against the New South Wales state team. Marsh dismissed leading Test cricketers Victor Trumper and Monty Noble, but was called for throwing. Marsh vowed to prove the legitimacy of his action by bowling with his arm encased in splints, which prompted the umpire to resign in humiliation. Having topped the bowling averages in the local competition, Marsh was selected to make his debut in the Sheffield Shield. He made an immediate impression and led the first-class bowling averages for the season after three matches. He was no-balled in his second match by Bob Crockett, but things came to a head in his fourth match when the same umpire no-balled him seventeen times, leading to angry crowd demonstrations. The cricket community was divided on whether Marsh's action was fair and various theories were propounded, which sought to show a motive for foul play against Marsh. The most popular of these theories was that Marsh was scapegoated in a campaign against throwing and was a soft target because of his race.|$|E
