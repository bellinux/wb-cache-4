5|$|In non-competitive inhibition, <b>the</b> <b>binding</b> of the {{inhibitor}} to {{the enzyme}} reduces its activity {{but does not}} affect <b>the</b> <b>binding</b> of substrate. As a result, the extent of inhibition depends only on the concentration of the inhibitor. Vmax will decrease due to the inability for the reaction to proceed as efficiently, but Km will remain {{the same as the}} actual binding of the substrate, by definition, will still function properly.|$|E
5|$|A mixed {{inhibitor}} binds to an {{allosteric site}} and <b>the</b> <b>binding</b> of the substrate and the inhibitor affect each other. The enzyme's function is reduced but not eliminated when {{bound to the}} inhibitor. This type of inhibitor does not follow the Michaelis-Menten equation.|$|E
5|$|Clindamycin has a {{primarily}} bacteriostatic effect. It is {{a bacterial}} protein synthesis inhibitor by inhibiting ribosomal translocation, {{in a similar}} way to macrolides. It does so by binding to the 50S rRNA of the large bacterial ribosome subunit, overlapping with <b>the</b> <b>binding</b> sites of the oxazolidinone, pleuromutilin, and macrolide antibiotics, among others.|$|E

5|$|In mixed inhibition, the {{inhibitor}} {{can bind to}} {{the enzyme}} {{at the same time}} as the enzyme's substrate. However, <b>the</b> <b>binding</b> of the inhibitor affects <b>the</b> <b>binding</b> of the substrate, and vice versa. This type of inhibition can be reduced, but not overcome by increasing concentrations of substrate. Although it is possible for mixed-type inhibitors to bind in the active site, this type of inhibition generally results from an allosteric effect where the inhibitor binds to a different site on an enzyme. Inhibitor binding to this allosteric site changes the conformation (i.e., tertiary structure or three-dimensional shape) of the enzyme so that the affinity of the substrate for the active site is reduced.|$|E
5|$|In some enzymes, no {{amino acids}} are {{directly}} involved in catalysis; instead, the enzyme contains sites to bind and orient catalytic cofactors. Enzyme structures may also contain allosteric sites where <b>the</b> <b>binding</b> of a small molecule causes a conformational change that increases or decreases activity.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Binding</b> Blade was {{developed}} by Intelligent Systems. It was directed by Tōru Narihiro, and produced by Takehiro Izushi. The designer was Masayuki Horikawa, while programming was handled by Takafumi Kaneko. The scenario was written by Masayuki Horikawa and series newcomer Kouhei Maeda. The character designs were handled by Eiji Kaneda. The music was composed by Yuka Tsujiyoko, who had worked on every title in the series up to that point. <b>The</b> <b>Binding</b> Blade began development as Fire Emblem: Maiden of Darkness, a Fire Emblem title intended for the Nintendo 64 and its peripheral 64DD. This version was revealed in 1997 by Shigeru Miyamoto under the working title Fire Emblem 64. When they were well into the development of Maiden of Darkness, the internal development structure at Intelligent Systems was changed, which combined with the poor sales of the 64DD resulted in the game's development being restarted in 2000 for the Game Boy Advance (GBA). Very little of the original Nintendo 64 game concept survived the transition. Aside from the characters Roy and Karel, most of the original game's characters were scrapped. The subtitle Maiden of Darkness remained in use as a working title up until 2001, when it became <b>The</b> <b>Binding</b> Blade. Production on {{the final version of}} <b>The</b> <b>Binding</b> Blade took approximately one year.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Binding</b> of Isaac {{has been}} well-received, with critics praising the game's roguelike nature to {{encourage}} repeated playthroughs. By July 2014, McMillen reported over 3 million copies had been sold. The game {{has been said}} to contribute to renewed interest in the roguelike genre from both players and developers.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Binding</b> of Isaac is an indie roguelike {{video game}} {{designed}} by Edmund McMillen and Florian Himsl, initially released in 2011 for Microsoft Windows; {{the game was}} later ported for OS X, and Linux operating systems. The game's title and plot are inspired by the Biblical story of <b>the</b> <b>Binding</b> of Isaac: after Isaac's mother receives a message from God demanding the life of her son as proof of her faith, Isaac flees into the monster-filled basement of their home, where he must fight to survive. Players control Isaac or one of six other unlockable characters through a procedurally generated dungeon in a roguelike manner, fashioned after those of The Legend of Zelda, defeating monsters in real-time combat while collecting items and power-ups to defeat bosses and eventually Isaac's mother.|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of excitonic localization on <b>the</b> biexcitonic <b>binding</b> energy in quasi- 3 D and quasi- 2 D structures is investigated. We consider here localization energies smaller than <b>the</b> exciton <b>binding</b> energy, not significantly changing the exciton internal motion. We show, that <b>the</b> biexciton <b>binding</b> energy increases for localization energies comparable to or larger than <b>the</b> biexciton <b>binding</b> energy. In <b>the</b> limit of large localization energies, <b>the</b> biexciton <b>binding</b> energy reaches about 40 % of <b>the</b> exciton <b>binding</b> energy, {{independent of the}} initial dimensionality of the system. This is discussed considering the zero-point kinetic energy of the exciton–exciton motion in the biexciton. <b>The</b> biexciton <b>binding</b> energy accordingly shows a dependence on the localization depth and on {{the shape of the}} exciton localization potential...|$|R

40|$|Protein-DNA {{bindings}} {{are essential}} activities. Understanding them {{forms the basis}} for further deciphering of biological and genetic systems. In particular, <b>the</b> protein-DNA <b>bindings</b> between transcription factors (TFs) and transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) {{play a central role}} in gene transcription. Comprehensive TF-TFBS binding sequence pairs have been found in a recent study. However, they are in one-to-one mappings which cannot fully reflect the many-to-many mappings within <b>the</b> <b>bindings.</b> An evolutionary algorithm is proposed to learn generalized representations (many-to-many mappings) from <b>the</b> TF-TFBS <b>binding</b> sequence pairs (one-to-one mappings). The generalized pairs are shown to be more meaningful than <b>the</b> original TF-TFBS <b>binding</b> sequence pairs. Some representative examples have been analyzed in this study. In particular, it shows that <b>the</b> TF-TFBS <b>binding</b> sequence pairs are not presumably in one-to-one mappings. They can also exhibit many-to-many mappings. The proposed method can help us extract such many-to-many information from <b>the</b> one-to-one TF-TFBS <b>binding</b> sequence pairs found in the previous study, providing further knowledge in understanding <b>the</b> <b>bindings</b> between TFs and TFBSs. © 2011 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
5|$|Toxin-antitoxin {{systems are}} {{typically}} classified {{according to how}} the antitoxin neutralises the toxin. In a Type I toxin-antitoxin system, the translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) that encodes the toxin is inhibited by <b>the</b> <b>binding</b> of a small non-coding RNA antitoxin to the mRNA. The protein toxin in a type II system is inhibited post-translationally by <b>the</b> <b>binding</b> of another protein antitoxin. A single example of Type III toxin-antitoxin system has been described whereby a protein toxin is bound directly by an RNA molecule. Toxin-antitoxin genes are often transferred through horizontal gene transfer and are associated with pathogenic bacteria, having been found on plasmids conferring antibiotic resistance and virulence.|$|E

Combined with the Fire Emblem, Roy is granted its incredible power and wields <b>the</b> <b>Binding</b> Blade in the final assault on Bern's capital. Zephiel is eventually killed by the Etrurian Army and his Divine Weapon is taken from him, but the war does not end with his death. Before his last battle, Zephiel had sent his remaining forces to gather somewhere in Elibe. The eight Divine Weapons suddenly emit a light that leads the Lycian Army to this location: an ancient temple that had long ago been built by the dragons.|$|E
