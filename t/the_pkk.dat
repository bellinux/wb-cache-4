On 5 March 2015, an F-4E-2020 crashed in central Anatolia killing both crew. After the recent accidents, the TAF withdrew RF-4Es from active service. Turkey {{was reported to have}} used F-4 jets to attack PKK separatists and the ISIS capital on 19 September 2015. The Turkish Air Force has reportedly used the F-4E 2020s against the more recent Third Phase of <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> conflict on heavy bombardment missions into Iraq on 15 November 2015, 12 January 2016, and 12 March 2016.|$|E
25|$|The Turkish {{newspapers}} have several times claimed that <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> has admitted the murder but <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> have always denied all claims. In 1998, <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> {{said that there}} is a strong indication that the Turkish side is trying to discredit <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> using Olof Palme's murder. Also many Kurdish organizations believe that the initial claims were propaganda of the Turkish government.|$|E
25|$|With the {{increase}} of Turkey's activities to cope with <b>the</b> <b>PKK,</b> 10 percent of income was spent on fighting against <b>the</b> <b>PKK.</b> One year the military spent $8,000,000,000 in operational expenses, and PKK's activity was not curbed. <b>The</b> <b>PKK</b> succeeded to get support from Kurdish activists.|$|E
50|$|In <b>the</b> <b>PKK's</b> {{first meeting}} in 1978, Bayik was {{appointed}} Deputy Secretary General of the organisation, making him <b>the</b> <b>PKK's</b> second man (after Abdullah Öcalan) and until 1995 {{he served as}} the leader of <b>the</b> <b>PKK's</b> military wing, <b>the</b> Arteshen Rizgariya Gelli Kurdistan (ARGK) or Peoples' Liberation Army. In the early nineties he was the camp director at the Mahsum Korkmaz Academy, <b>the</b> <b>PKK's</b> training camp in the Syrian-controlled Beqaa Valley in Lebanon.|$|R
50|$|He {{was imprisoned}} {{for several years}} after the 1980 Turkish coup d'état, after his release he {{became a member of}} <b>the</b> <b>PKK's</b> politburo (leadership council) and led the group's popular front: the ERNK. After working in <b>the</b> <b>PKK's</b> {{political}} wing for 3 years, in Europe he was called back to South-Eastern Turkey by Abdullah Ocalan to gain more battle experience. He is currently the member of the Executive Council (de facto government) of the Koma Civakên Kurdistan (KCK), which is <b>the</b> <b>PKK's</b> umbrella organisation.|$|R
50|$|Since 2004 he {{has been}} part of <b>the</b> three-man <b>PKK</b> Executive Committee, {{including}} acting PKK leader Murat Karayılan and PKK co-founder Cemil Bayik, who preceded Bahoz Erdal as <b>the</b> <b>PKK's</b> military commander.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>PKK</b> blew up {{a bridge}} to prevent {{reinforcements}} thirty minutes before the attack using 15 kilograms of explosives, cutting off the main route. <b>The</b> <b>PKK</b> attackers then launched an assault on a military outpost, killing 12 soldiers and wounding 16. Eight Turkish soldiers were captured by <b>the</b> <b>PKK.</b>|$|E
25|$|When ISIL {{invaded the}} Sinjar Mountains in 2014 {{and began to}} {{massacre}} its Yezidi population, <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> intervened with hundreds of fighters {{in order to save}} the locals from the Islamic State militants. Since then, <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> set up two local Yezidi self-defense groups, namely the Sinjar Resistance Units and the Êzîdxan Women's Units. In late 2015, anti-ISIL forces finally succeeded in driving the Islamic State mostly from the Sinjar area, but <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> fighters have since refused to leave and continue to train and equip the local PKK-affiliated militias. This has caused resentment among the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), which regards Sinjar as part of Iraqi Kurdistan and sees <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> as local political rival.|$|E
25|$|The Partiya Karkerên Kurdistan (PKK), {{also known}} as KADEK and Kongra-Gel is Kurdish militant {{organization}} which has waged an armed struggle against the Turkish state for cultural and political rights and self-determination for the Kurds. Turkey's military allies the US, the EU, and NATO see <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> as a terrorist organization while the UN, Switzerland, Russia, China and India have refused to add <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> to their terrorist list. Some of them have even supported <b>the</b> <b>PKK.</b>|$|E
50|$|On 8 May, <b>the</b> <b>PKK's</b> armed wing HPG {{announced}} that Turkish UAVs are flying over PKK camps.|$|R
50|$|Sebahat Tuncel, {{an elected}} MP from the BDP, put <b>the</b> <b>PKK's</b> {{casualties}} at 18,000 as of July 2011.|$|R
50|$|November 27, 1991, {{more than}} 1,500 shops were closed in Bismil and Idil to mark <b>the</b> <b>PKK's</b> 13th anniversary.|$|R
25|$|In early June 2010, {{following}} {{a visit to}} Turkey by one of <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> leaders, <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> announced {{an end to the}} cease fire, followed by an air attack on several border villages and rebel positions by the Turkish air force.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between the HDP and <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> has been put forward by the governing Justice and Development Party (AKP) as a reason why {{it would be better}} for the HDP to not gain representation in Parliament, though government journalists alleged that this would result in greater violence by <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> and attempts to establish a separate parliament in Diyarbakır. In election posters and propaganda, the HDP has been accused of scaremongering and using <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> to coerce voters into voting for them, stating that there would be more violence if the HDP failed to pass the election threshold. In contrast, HDP politicians also accused the AKP of scaremongering when they claimed that their affiliation to <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> made them unfit for parliamentary representation. PKK militants have also been accused of raiding local shops and cafes in the south-east of Turkey and demanding votes for the HDP, with one civilian being wounded when a group of PKK youth militants raided a cafe in Silvan. Selahattin Demirtaş has denied having an 'organic relationship' with <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> and claimed that the allegations of PKK militants demanding votes for the HDP from voters was untrue.|$|E
25|$|More Kurdish rebellions {{would occur}} {{throughout}} the region. The most violent were those by the Kurdistan Workers Party (or <b>the</b> <b>PKK)</b> that {{was founded in}} 1978. The war between <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> and the Turkish government, which spanned the 1980s through the 1990s, caused numerous deaths and internally displaced persons on the Kurdish side.|$|E
50|$|The 2016 Şemdinli {{bombing was}} a car bomb attack on Turkish {{military}} base carried out by <b>the</b> <b>PKK's</b> armed wing HPG in Turkey which occurred on 9 October 2016. According to the Turkish authorities, a car bomb killed at least 18 people including 10 soldiers and 8 civilians. Also, another 27 people were wounded according to initial reports. <b>The</b> <b>PKK's</b> armed wing HPG claimed the attack and claimed to have killed more than 32 soldiers.|$|R
50|$|Öcalan evaded {{assassination}} after {{a television}} reporter, Yalçın Küçük, publicized the plan on <b>the</b> <b>PKK's</b> TV channel, MED-TV. Küçük was also detained in the Ergenekon investigation.|$|R
5000|$|He {{served as}} the head of the People's Defence Forces (HPG), <b>the</b> <b>PKK's</b> armed wing from June 2004 until July 2009, when he was {{replaced}} by Sofi Nurettin.|$|R
25|$|The next {{development}} was on August 23, 1994, when Syria officially linked the water issue to <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> in the summit between Turkey, Syria and Iran. During this summit another interesting {{development was}} the Hatay issue, which {{was brought to}} table. While the summit was going at Damascus, <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> was building its structure in Hatay; in July 1995, it performed its first activity there, later using this province as a base to extend its activities to Adana and Mersin; <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> was extending to the East Mediterranean. This region {{was one of the}} centers of immigration from the southeast, and also is a temporary summer work area for the southeast region. For Turkey the region was sensitive, not because of the Kurds, but because of the Arab population. Beginning late 1995, Syrian backing of PKK operations at Hatay was perceived by Turkish governments as an active hostile threat from Syria more than <b>the</b> <b>PKK.</b> The PKK's Hatay operations ended with the undeclared war with Syria.|$|E
25|$|Some of the {{heaviest}} fighting {{of the entire}} KDP-PUK civil war ensued starting October 13, 1997. Hundreds were killed and thousands displaced. PUK used six GRAD missiles in Suleymaniye. There were no negotiations to bring a truce. Same missiles were used against military targets in Turkey. From Turkey's perspective the KDP was trying to push PKK out of North Iraq and the KUP was getting support from <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> which was supported by Syria and Iran. Turkey intervened {{on the side of}} the KDP and saw it as an opportunity to attack <b>the</b> <b>PKK.</b> Turkey also warned Talabani, the leader of PUK, not to cooperate with <b>the</b> <b>PKK.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Iraqi Kurdish Civil War {{took place}} between rival Kurdish factions in the mid-1990s. Over {{the course of the}} conflict, the various factions drew Kurdish factions from Iran and Turkey, as well as Iranian, Iraqi, American forces into the fighting. On {{friendly}} terms with the PUK, <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> began attacking KDP Peshmergas and members of the KDP. <b>The</b> <b>PKK</b> was moved to Qandil mountains from Bekaa Valley after the civil war ended.|$|E
50|$|On 4 January, rocket attacks {{launched}} by <b>the</b> <b>PKK's</b> youth militant arm YDG-H at security forces in Şırnak {{resulted in an}} incurring shoot-out in which 2 rebels where killed.|$|R

50|$|According to Howard Eissenstat, a Turkey {{expert at}} St Lawrence University in New York, the TAK is {{damaging}} <b>the</b> <b>PKK's</b> short-term and long-term goals, and it's {{unlikely that the}} TAK is under PKK control.|$|R
50|$|Police chief Hanefi Avcı {{said that}} the gangs fell into infighting after alleged PKK financiers Behçet Cantürk and Savaş Buldan were assassinated, as the gangs had {{completed}} their mission of dismantling <b>the</b> <b>PKK's</b> financial foundation.|$|R
50|$|In {{operations}} {{taking place}} in Elazığ, five suspects who were allegedly part of <b>the</b> <b>PKK's</b> youth organisation were arrested. The police officers taking party in the operations also confiscated two unlicensed firearms and numerous organisation-related documents.|$|R
25|$|Turkey {{recognized}} {{it was impossible}} to eliminate the organization as a fighting force as long as it could retreat to Syria, Iraq and Iran. The organization's revenues have been estimated by various countries at USD 200–500 million annually during the 1990s. Turkish authorities claimed that after Kurdish activist and state support, an important source of income became drug trafficking as substantial amounts of heroin formerly transiting Iran were now re-routed through Iraq after the war in Iraq (Gulf War). <b>The</b> <b>PKK</b> had denied all accusations that their members had been involved in drug trafficking. Turkish authorities also claimed that the organization had been working on developing methods of drug-trafficking and according to Interpol's records, 298 people somehow connected with the organization were arrested for drug trafficking between 1984 and 1993. According to Aliza Marcus, an expert who has analyzed <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> since the 80's, it doesn't seem that <b>the</b> <b>PKK,</b> as an organization, directly produced or traded in narcotics.|$|E
25|$|With the 1980 {{assassination}} {{of a former}} prime minister, Nihat Erim who was assassinated by radical Turkish leftist organization Dev Sol, the discovery of gun depots, civil disorder, political indecision (parliament was unable to select a president) and, most importantly, the Iran–Iraq War, a coup took place, initiating a series of trials. In the central trial, against the left-wing organization Devrimci Yol (Revolutionary Path) at Ankara Military Court, the defendants listed 5,388 political killings before the military coup. Among the victims were 1,296 right wingers and 2,109 left-wingers. The others could not clearly be related. In this period, {{the number of deaths}} attributed to <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> was approximately 240. Many right-wing organizations saw <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> as a threat to their existence. The military tribunals of the 1980 coup which tried 7,000 people revealed a recorded 5,241 dead and 14,152 wounded from 1979 to 1980. <b>The</b> <b>PKK</b> made up 21% of the total 5,241 caseload.|$|E
25|$|On April 25 and 26, 2008, the Turkish Air Force bombed <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> {{bases in}} the {{northern}} Iraqi regions of Zap, Avasin-Basyan and Hakurk. This was described as the largest attack {{since the end of}} Operation Sun. First the T-155 Fırtına howitzers (which have a range between 30 and 56km, {{depending on the type of}} ammunition) were used to shell <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> positions starting from 18:00pm on April 25, which lasted for two hours. Then F-16 jets equipped with LANTIRN belonging to the 181st Squadron (Pars Filo) and F-4E 2020 Terminator jets belonging to the 171st Squadron (Korsan Filo) began bombing the PKK's positions in northern Iraq, which lasted 45 minutes. In the meantime, Heron MALE UAVs were used for gaining reconnaissance data regarding the PKK's positions, and about 1000 Turkish commandos entered 8 kilometers into northern Iraq from the border area near Derecik (Şemdinli) in pursuit of <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> militants. On April 26, 2008, at around 06:00am, a second aerial strike by the jets of the Turkish Air Force from Diyarbakır Air Base took place, in which <b>the</b> <b>PKK</b> militants using the cemetery area in Hakurk as a hideout were bombed. This was followed by another air strike at 10:00am in the same morning, during which the Turkish Air Force jets entered 30 kilometers into Iraqi air space.|$|E
