Kira lurches the runabout to one side, causing Tahna to fall over and allowing her to pilot the ship through the wormhole to the Gamma Quadrant; where she ejects the bomb causing it to explode harmlessly in space. However, Tahna has regained control of his weapon and orders Kira {{to return to the}} Alpha Quadrant. There, Sisko gives Tahna an ultimatum, either to give himself over to the station's authorities, or to wait to be destroyed by the Cardassians. Tahna hands over his weapon to Kira, and turns himself in; Kira explains that he may come to understand why <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> thing to do someday.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} new Waldorf-Astoria {{hotel was}} based on the concept {{that there should be a}} large opulent hotel in New York for {{distinguished}} visitors. Financial backing was not difficult to get in the summer of 1929 as times were prosperous; the stock market had not yet crashed nor had the Depression arrived. However, before ground was broken for the new building, some of the investors became dubious about whether <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> time to be investing in a luxury hotel. The land for the new hotel was formerly owned by the New York Central Railroad, who had promised $10 million toward the building of the new Waldorf-Astoria. The railroad and all the other investors decided to honor their commitments and take their chances with the uncertain financial climate.|$|E

500|$|The case of R v Baillie, a {{prosecution}} for criminal libel, opened on 23 November 1778 at 1pm before Lord Mansfield, the Lord Chief Justice, in the Court of King's Bench. Prior to this, Baillie and his counsel had been debating {{how to respond}} to the case; Bearcroft, Peckham, Murphy and Hargrave advocated negotiating a settlement before it went to trial, while Erskine urged them to argue Baillie's case before the court and eventually succeeded in convincing Baillie that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> thing to do. The case opened with an address by Sir John Scott, the Solicitor General for England and Wales, who was prosecuting Baillie, followed by [...] "long, dreary" [...] speeches by Bearcroft, Peckham, Murphy and Hargrave, defending him. An illness that befell Hargrave caused several interruptions to the proceedings, and as a result darkness had fallen by the time he finished speaking. Lord Mansfield announced that rather than dragging the proceedings out late into the night, the court session would end for the evening and resume the next morning, when Erskine would have his chance to speak. Erskine recognised this as a great opportunity, as it would present him with a refreshed court the following day, rather than an exhausted one; he said later that he [...] "always blessed God for the providential [...] of Hargrave".|$|E

500|$|Donald P. Baker of The Washington Post {{commented that}} Mathias' lasting {{reputation}} {{would be that}} of a maverick. Though {{he was elected to}} the House in 1960 as a moderate/conservative, his life in the Congress moved him to the center, and he frequently deviated from the party line and sided with Democrats. The fact that he [...] "went out of his way to disassociate himself from [...] " [...] in the 1980 elections had hindered his chances at a chairmanship. Mathias also established a record on civil rights, having played an important role in passing a fair housing bill while he was in the House, and also in establishing a national holiday for Martin Luther King Jr. He held liberal views on abortion, defense spending, and the Equal Rights Amendment, and, along with Senator John Warner of Virginia, was one of the sponsors of a bill to authorize the construction of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. In discussing Mathias' retirement, Tom Wicker of The New York Times commented that [...] "he was fair, flexible, concerned, able to rise above partisanship but not above responsibility". When Wicker asked him which senators he respected the most, Mathias listed J. William Fulbright (D), Jacob Javits (R), John Sherman Cooper (R), Cliff Case (R), Phil Hart (D), Mike Mansfield (D), and George Aiken (R), because [...] "each one of those people would take an issue on his own responsibility... They'd simply come to the conclusion that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> thing for the country." ...|$|E

It was released in August 1995, again as two different CDs, with B-sides [...] "Charlene", [...] "I Go Humble", [...] "Venus as a Boy", and several remixes. Less commercially successful than [...] "Army of Me", it debuted at number 23 on the UK Singles Chart, remaining in the Top 75 for three weeks. The Post Tour was her first proper North American tour as a solo artist, with Aphex Twin as her opening act. While in the United States, she also appeared on Late Night with David Letterman; this tour [...] "helped maintain Posts momentum and keep Björk in the public eye", since airings of [...] "Army of Me" [...] and [...] "Isobel" [...] had been relegated primarily to after-hours alternative music shows in MTV. In the United Kingdom, Björk also performed on Top of the Pops on several occasions. [...] "It's Oh So Quiet" [...] was released as a single in November, once again as two CDs.

500|$|Starting with Justice for All, {{the series}} {{localization}} direction has been handled by Janet Hsu; {{by the time}} she joined Capcom's localization team in 2005, the first Ace Attorney had already been localized, with the original localization team having decided to do a full localization, changing the setting from Japan to Los Angeles. While Hsu thought that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> choice to make, as it made the characters and dialogue more relatable and made for an emotional experience closer to what players of the Japanese version experience, it resulted in issues with each following game. According to the localization editor, Brandon Gay, Justice for All was one of their largest games to localize due to its focus on the story, and how it needs to convey the whole game world and its characters through just text; this made it a challenge to make the characters relatable for an American audience. Another thing the localization team had to keep in mind was to ensure that recurring characters were consistent with how they behave in the first Ace Attorney. According to JP Kellams, another staff member working on the localization, {{there was a lot of}} pressure on them to make a good localization, as the first game's localization had been well received; he also felt that there was room for creativity due to the game's style and subject, with room for humor that might not fit in other localizations. A lot of the humor in the original was based on Japanese wordplay; these jokes had to be redone entirely for the English release. Hsu felt that the game was more demanding than previous projects she had worked on, as the localizers [...] "almost have to become [...] " [...] in order to get the nuance and motivations right due to their complexity.|$|E

2500|$|However, this {{campaign}} did no go as expected, the Legal Adviser of the Department of State {{did not support}} the notion that the Commonwealth could be an [...] "inalterable pact" [...] that could only be modified by mutual consent, recognizing the fact that Congress -as the holder of Puerto Rico's sovereignty- was capable of doing so unilaterally. This development triggered a sharp turn in Muñoz's ideology and strategy, which would lead to efforts to ensure that the Commonwealth's development was to be through its full sovereignty. This placed him in the same line of Fernós {{for the first time in}} years. The strategy of both leaders would now be focused on acquiring concrete changes, instead of pushing partial measures. On February 10, 1961, Fernós noted that the Commonwealth, as it stood, had an absence of democracy and shortly afterwards created another plan in line with the Fernós-Murray Project. Despite all if the failed efforts, he still believed that the Commonwealth should mirror the relation of Canada and the United Kingdom and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> time to launch a pro-sovereignty campaign. The new plan became known as the Aspinall Project and its main key difference to the Fernós-Murray Project was that in order to be implemented, the Senate was to renounce to all of the Commonwealth's sovereignty, resulting in the momentary creation of a Republic of Puerto Rico, which would then negotiate with Congress directly. This concept, known then as the [...] "culminated" [...] or [...] "perfected Estado Libre Asociado" [...] was consistent with the definition of free association approved by the United Nations on December 14, 1960, through [...] UN General Assembly Resolution 1514 (XV).
