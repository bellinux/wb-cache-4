5|$|Some {{ransomware}} strains {{have used}} proxies tied to Tor hidden services {{to connect to}} their command and control servers, increasing the difficulty of tracing <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the criminals. Furthermore, dark web vendors have increasingly started to offer the technology as a service.|$|E
50|$|Position-based routing methods use {{information}} on <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nodes. This information is obtained for example via a GPS receiver. Based on <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>location</b> <b>the</b> best path between source and destination nodes can be determined.|$|R
50|$|Though Ptolemy {{provides}} coordinates, it {{is unknown}} which prime meridian he used. Moreover the coordinates provided have been polluted by mistakes by copyists. <b>The</b> <b>exact</b> <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> places mentioned remained unsure until recently.|$|R
50|$|Farming {{and mining}} were the {{principal}} {{pillars of the}} Commonwealth economy, the latter being particularly profitable since the Commonwealth already knew <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> gold and other mines because {{of the history of}} FirstSide.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>exact</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> {{the battle}} is disputed, and depends on which group of sources is preferred: it is only Icelandic sources that place it near a place called Svolder, while Adam of Bremen places it in Øresund.|$|E
5|$|A key {{assessment}} {{that is made}} after diagnosis is whether surgical removal of the tumor is possible (see Staging), as {{this is the only}} cure for this cancer. Whether or not surgical resection can be offered depends on how much the cancer has spread. <b>The</b> <b>exact</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the tumor is also a significant factor, and CT can show how it relates to the major blood vessels passing close to the pancreas. The general health of the person must also be assessed, though age in itself is not an obstacle to surgery.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Étretat, Monet {{completed}} three paintings of fishing boats, one of a rural road, and, sometime between late 1868 and January or February 1869, The Magpie (W 133). Painted five years before the first major Impressionist exhibition in 1874, The Magpie is one of Monet's 140 winter landscapes, the largest in its class. <b>The</b> <b>exact</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the snow scene depicted in The Magpie is unknown. Ralph T. Coe proposed that Monet painted the scene near the Farm Saint-Siméon above the Seine estuary in Honfleur.|$|E

50|$|While {{significant}} {{attempts have}} been made recently to identify <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual Upanishads, the results are tentative. Witzel identifies the center of activity in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad as the area of Videha, whose king, Janaka, features prominently in the Upanishad.|$|R
5|$|All of the 46 National Treasures are {{presently}} located in Japan; two {{were discovered in}} China and three were found in Japan, but <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> their excavation sites is unknown.

5|$|English Heritage, a {{government}} body {{in charge of}} conservation of historic sites, roughly locates the battlefield in an area 800 to 1600metres (0.5 to 1.0 mile) north {{of the town of}} Barnet. Over the centuries, much of the terrain has changed, and records of the town's boundaries and geography are not detailed enough for English Heritage or historians to conclude <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the battle. Geographical features corresponding to contemporary descriptions allow approximations of where the fighting took place.|$|E
5|$|Michael Francis Egan {{was born}} in Ireland on September 29, 1761. <b>The</b> <b>exact</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> his birth is disputed. Early biographers {{believed}} Egan was possibly born in Galway; more recent scholarship suggests it was Limerick. He joined the Order of Friars Minor (commonly known as the Franciscans) and studied at the Old University of Leuven and Charles University in Prague. Egan received minor orders, subdiaconate, and diaconate at Mechelen, in modern-day Belgium. He was ordained a priest, probably in Prague, in 1785 or 1786. While studying on the continent, Egan became fluent in German.|$|E
5|$|Stuart {{left his}} family deeply in debt, {{and his wife}} and daughters were unable to {{purchase}} a grave site. He was, therefore, buried in an unmarked grave which was purchased cheaply from Benjamin Howland, a local carpenter. His family recovered from their financial troubles roughly ten years later, and they planned to move his body to a family cemetery in Newport. However, they could not remember <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> his body, and it was never moved. There is a monument for Stuart, his wife, and their children at the Common Burying Ground in Newport.|$|E
50|$|The {{interpretation}} of Puliran {{as part of}} Tondo and Maynila's alliance network is instead implied by the challenge posed by the Pila Historical Society Foundation and local historian Jaime F. Tiongson to Postma's assertions regarding <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> places mentioned in the Laguna copperplate.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>exact</b> <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{tests are}} unknown, {{as they were}} all air drops. However, the planned ground zero was set at [...] for all except the Fox shot, which was [...] "500 feet west and 300 feet south" [...] in order to {{minimize}} damage to the control point.|$|R
5|$|The Allies possessed little {{intelligence}} on western New Britain's terrain and <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> Japanese forces, so they flew extensive air photography sorties over the region, and small ground patrols were landed from PT boats. A team from Special Service Unit No. 1 reconnoitered Arawe {{on the night}} of 9/10December and concluded that there were few Japanese troops in the area. The Japanese detected this party near the village of Umtingalu and strengthened their defenses there.|$|E
5|$|The St. Edmund {{memorial}} coins were minted {{in great}} quantities {{by a group}} of more than 70 moneyers, many of whom appear to have originated from continental Europe: over 1800 specimens were found when the great Cuerdale Hoard was discovered in Lancashire in 1840. The memorial coins were widely used within the Danelaw. Coins have mainly been found in the east of England, but <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> any of the mints they came from is not known with certainty, although scholars have assumed that they were made in East Anglia.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{ended in}} victory for Dutthagamani's forces and {{considerably}} weakened Elara's army, ultimately leading to his defeat and death. <b>The</b> <b>exact</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> Vijithapura is unknown, though historians {{have made some}} speculations on this. The battle is still regarded by Sri Lankans as a legendary event in the country's history, and has even been compared with victories of the Sri Lanka Army during the country's civil war.|$|E
2500|$|Maqdesi, an Arab geographer, named Hazarajat as Gharj Al-Shar-Gharj meaning [...] "mountain" [...] area {{ruled by}} chiefs. The region {{was known as}} Gharjistan in the late Middle Ages, though <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> main cities still remain unidentified. The name Hazarajat first appears in the 16th century Baburnama, written by Mughal Emperor Babur.|$|R
30|$|The large slip of the {{foreshock}} {{and small}} events immediately after this foreshock {{also seem to}} have had a complementary distribution in space (Fig.  8 b). Although the fault plane of the foreshock was partially overlain with that <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mainshock, <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> large slips at shallow depth were not the same as those of the mainshock.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>exact</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> Fort Prudhomme is unknown. Some historians {{claim that}} Fort Prudhomme {{was built on}} the first Chickasaw Bluff, in modern-day Lauderdale County. The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture {{suggests}} that the fort was constructed on the second Chickasaw Bluff near modern-day Randolph. Other research mentions the third Chickasaw Bluff as the location of the fort, at the border of modern Tipton and Shelby Counties. Again other sources assume that the fourth Chickasaw Bluff in modern Shelby County at Memphis was the location of Fort Prudhomme.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>exact</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the Vijithapura {{fortress}} is uncertain. A {{village with}} the same name near the ancient Kalawewa reservoir {{may have been the}} place where the battle took place. There is an ancient temple here as well as a granite stone that locals believe to have been used by Dutthagamani's soldiers to sharpen their swords However, other historians and archaeologists believe that the location is close to Kaduruwela near Polonnaruwa, where the ruins of an ancient fortress have been found.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>exact</b> <b>{{location}}</b> <b>of</b> {{the olive}} grove of Kountouras in Messenia is unknown; the Greek {{version of the}} Chronicle records, apart from the owner's name (Kountouras or the variant form Koundouron), a location name Kepeskianous (Κηπησκιάνους), while a variant form is recorded as Kapsikia (Καψικία). Efforts {{have been made to}} identify the locality, with some linking it with the modern village of Kapsia west of Mantinea in Arcadia, but this is too far from the reported area of the battle based on the sources, and furthermore olive trees do not grow in the region.|$|E
50|$|After {{the maps}} have been {{declared}} ready for field mapping, they are printed out by humanitarian volunteers on the ground. They work {{in collaboration with}} locals from the community to collect local data about road names, settlements, the natural landscape, and <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people {{they are trying to}} help. This information is then put into the online map and declared ready for use.|$|R
5000|$|Each milecastle on Hadrian's Wall had two {{associated}} turret structures. These turrets were positioned approximately one-third {{and two-thirds}} of a Roman {{mile to the}} west of the Milecastle, and would probably have been manned by part of the milecastle's garrison. The turrets associated with Milecastle 77 are known as Turret 77A (...) and Turret 77B (...) [...] <b>The</b> <b>exact</b> <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> turrets have not been found.|$|R
30|$|The linear {{systems are}} {{influenced}} by the <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> eigenvalues. Therefore, for a system to get good response, both in transient and steady states, it is necessary to locate all eigenvalues in desired positions. Due to approximations, it is difficult to attain <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> all eigenvalues. Hence it is sufficient that all eigenvalues are placed within a suitable region in complex s-plane, using strip eigenvalue assignment method.|$|R
5|$|With no {{above ground}} remains, <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the abbey had been lost, {{and so in}} the 1840s, {{the editor of the}} Leicester Chronicle, James Thompson, tried, and failed, to attempt to locate the abbey church. In the 1850s the Leicester Architectural and Archaeological Society would also carry out excavations, but also failed to locate the abbey. Prior to the 9th Earl of Dysart's {{donation}} of the abbey precinct, another attempt was undertaken, but again, no trace of the abbey was found.|$|E
5|$|Bartlett {{decided to}} send a team back to {{establish}} <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> the island that the Anderson party had approached, and to determine if Anderson had actually landed there. An injury to his knee ruled Mamen out from this mission, which was undertaken by ship's steward Ernest Chafe, with the Inuit pair, Kataktovik and Kuraluk. Chafe's group came within 2 miles (3km) of Herald Island before being stopped by open water. A careful examination through binoculars revealed no signs of the missing party, and Chafe concluded that Anderson and company had not reached the island. Chafe and his party then returned to Shipwreck Camp.|$|E
5|$|Fossil Prionomyrmecini ants {{existed in}} Europe during the Eocene and Late Oligocene. Cesare Baroni Urbani {{collected}} Prionomyrmex janzeni in Baltic amber from Kaliningrad, Russia and Prionomyrmex wappleri in Germany. Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr collected Prionomyrmex longiceps in Baltic amber from the Eocene, but <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>location</b> <b>of</b> its discovery is unclear, {{due to the}} lost type material. P. longiceps were an arboreal nesting species, living in trees instead of the ground. William Morton Wheeler assumed this due to its long legs, sharp claws and elongated mandibles. Prionomyrmex may have preferred a jungle habitat at low elevations.|$|E
5|$|While {{significant}} {{attempts have}} been made recently to identify <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual Upanishads, the results are tentative. Witzel identifies the center of activity in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad as the area of Videha, whose king, Janaka, features prominently in the Upanishad. The Chandogya Upanishad was probably composed in a more western than eastern location in the Indian subcontinent, possibly somewhere in the western region of the Kuru-Panchala country.|$|R
30|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} (WSNs) are {{an emerging}} technology that has potential applications in various fields, such as healthcare, surveillance, astronomy, military and agriculture [1 – 4]. Most of these applications require knowledge <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sensor nodes used {{to sense the}} data. In {{the absence of such}} information, data may not be useful for users. Therefore, the precise localization of sensors is a critical requirement in WSNs [5].|$|R
50|$|In 1912 Gumpel {{graduated}} {{with a degree in}} construction and founded the firm Gumpel & Bengtsson, which soon assumed a leading position in Sweden. During World War II Gumpel was involved in espionage with his friend Eric Erickson. With their help the allied powers obtained <b>the</b> <b>exact</b> <b>locations</b> <b>of</b> Germany's petroleum refineries and then bombed them. This event was reflected in a book and the 1962 film The Counterfeit Traitor.|$|R
