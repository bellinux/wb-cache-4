5|$|In the Brazilian Amazon, {{members of}} the Tupí–Guaraní {{language}} family have been observed using Pachycondyla commutata ants during female rite-of-passage ceremonies, and prescribing <b>the</b> <b>sting</b> of Pseudomyrmex spp. for fevers and headaches.|$|E
5|$|M. nigrocincta ants have highly venomous stings {{which are}} painful and produce intense burning sensations. The sensations last for many days and <b>the</b> <b>sting</b> itches. If left untreated, <b>the</b> <b>sting</b> may develop into an ulcer. The venom of a closely related species, M. pilosula is amongst the strongest of the Formicidae and {{contains}} active ingredients such as acid and alkaline phosphatases, hyaluronidase, {{as well as}} phospholipases A2 and B. In a 2011 Australian ant allergy venom study, the objective of which was to determine what native Australian ants were associated with ant sting anaphylaxis, it was shown that 265 of the 376 participants taking {{part of the study}} reacted to <b>the</b> <b>sting</b> of several Myrmecia species. Of these, 176 reacted to the M. pilosula, 15 to M. nigrocincta, three to M. ludlowi, and 56 to other Myrmecia ants. The study concluded that four main groups of Australian ants were responsible for causing anaphylaxis. Besides Myrmecia species, these included the green-head ant (Rhytidoponera metallica).|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Stinging</b> Fly is a {{literary}} magazine published in Ireland featuring {{short stories and}} poetry. It publishes three issues each year. In 2005, <b>The</b> <b>Stinging</b> Fly moved into book publishing {{with the establishment of}} <b>The</b> <b>Stinging</b> Fly Press.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Stinger</b> - This {{was only}} {{introduced}} when Sally Gray and Angellica Bell were presenting. The players must guide <b>The</b> <b>Stinger</b> - a long metal rod attached by four ropes - {{through the course}} to pass it from one zone to the next. Each zone is worth 10 points and there are eight in total. One player acts as the captain and gives advice to the other four players guiding <b>The</b> <b>Stinger</b> by pulling and moving the ropes. If <b>the</b> <b>stinger</b> touches <b>the</b> edges before reaching the next zone, the team must return <b>The</b> <b>Stinger</b> to <b>the</b> previous zone and start again from there.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> worker bee's <b>stinger</b> is {{a complex}} organ that allows a bee to defend itself and the hive from most mammals. Attacking bees aim for the face by sensing regions {{with high levels of}} carbon dioxide (like mosquitos). Bee stings against mammals and birds {{typically}} leave <b>the</b> <b>stinger</b> embedded in <b>the</b> victim due to the structure of flesh and the stinger's barbs. In this case, the venom bulb stays with <b>the</b> <b>stinger</b> and continues to pump. Upon losing its <b>stinger,</b> <b>the</b> bee will subsequently die since the portion where <b>the</b> <b>stinger</b> bulb was removed rips out part of its insides.|$|R
5|$|Established in 1983, <b>The</b> <b>Sting</b> is the school's {{official}} {{student newspaper}} {{and is a}} member of the Georgia Scholastic Press Association. The monthly publication has been recognized on multiple occasions by the GSPA and the Henry W. Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Georgia. The newspaper features news, editorials, opinions, features, entertainment, and sports. The staff also maintains the paper's related website.|$|E
5|$|In rural Alberta, Canada, a {{telephone}} lineman is stung by a bee {{as he works}} {{at the top of}} a pole. Five identical boys approach and watch as the lineman adversely reacts to <b>the</b> <b>sting,</b> causing him to fall to the ground and die. The boys look down at his body, then walk off silently.|$|E
5|$|Queen {{and worker}} {{bumblebees}} can sting. Unlike in honeybees, a bumblebee's sting lacks barbs, so the bee can sting repeatedly without injuring itself; {{by the same}} token, <b>the</b> <b>sting</b> is not left in the wound. Bumblebee species are not normally aggressive, but may sting in defence of their nest, or if harmed. Female cuckoo bumblebees aggressively attack host colony members, and sting the host queen, but ignore other animals unless disturbed.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, the morphology, {{histology}} {{and fine}} structure of <b>the</b> <b>stinger,</b> {{a part of}} the venom apparatus of Euscorpius mingrelicus (Kessler, 1874) (Scorpiones: Euscorpiidae) were studied by light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). <b>The</b> <b>stinger,</b> located at <b>the</b> end section of the telson, is sickle-shaped. The venom is ejected through a pair of venom pores on its subterminal portion. Both venom ducts extend along <b>the</b> <b>stinger</b> without contact with each other since they are separated by connective tissue cells. <b>The</b> <b>stinger</b> cuticle is composed of two layers. Additionally, there are many pore canals and some hemolymph vessels in the cuticle. This work constitutes the first histological and fine structure study on Euscorpius mingrelicus stinger...|$|R
5000|$|Queens {{and workers}} have a {{modified}} ovipositor, a stinger, {{with which they}} defend the hive. Unlike bees of any other genus and the queens of their own species <b>the</b> <b>stinger</b> of worker honey bees is barbed. Contrary to popular belief, a bee does not always die soon after stinging; this misconception {{is based on the}} fact that a bee will usually die after stinging a human or other mammal. <b>The</b> <b>stinger</b> and its venom sac, with musculature and a ganglion allowing them to continue delivering venom after they are detached, are designed to pull free of the body when they lodge. This apparatus (including barbs on <b>the</b> <b>stinger)</b> is thought to have evolved in response to predation by vertebrates, since the barbs do not function (and <b>the</b> <b>stinger</b> apparatus does not detach) unless <b>the</b> <b>stinger</b> is embedded in elastic material. The barbs do not always [...] "catch", so a bee may occasionally pull its stinger free and fly off unharmed (or sting again).|$|R

5|$|Scorpions perform non-bluffing threat displays, as {{they have}} {{powerful}} defences, but various predators still eat them. When provoked, they spread their pincers {{and in some cases}} raise their abdomens, their tails standing near-erect with <b>the</b> <b>sting</b> ready for immediate use. Some scorpions in addition produce deimatic noises by stridulating with the pedipalps and first legs.|$|E
5|$|The {{great grey shrike}} is able {{to detect}} flying {{bumblebees}} up to 100 metres away; once captured, <b>the</b> <b>sting</b> is removed by repeatedly squeezing the insect with the mandibles and wiping the abdomen on a branch. The European honey buzzard follows flying bees back to their nest, digs out the nest with its feet, and eats larvae, pupae and adults as it finds them.|$|E
5|$|After {{releasing}} <b>The</b> <b>Sting</b> (1986) and Electro Reggae (1987) {{as members}} of their Taxi Gang band, Sly and Robbie enlisted Laswell again to work on Rhythm Killers. They recorded the album {{over a period of}} three months at Quad Recording in New York City. Before entering the studio, Sly and Robbie originally had planned music and demos to work with, but scrapped them after Chris Blackwell of Island discouraged the idea. Blackwell wanted the duo to come up with original material at the studio, as they had been known to do since their early years in Jamaica.|$|E

5|$|Announcing {{plans for}} the future of the British {{military}} on 21 July 2004, the Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon detailed plans to reduce the upgrade programme to cover only 16 MRA4 aircraft, and suggested that an eventual fleet of 12 might suffice. PA02, the second development MRA4, achieved its first flight in December 2004 and was used to test elements of the mission system and the air vehicle. BAE Systems received a contract worth £1.1 billion for 12 MRA4s on 18 July 2006; three were to be development aircraft and nine more converted to production standard. The Nimrod MRA4 successfully released <b>the</b> <b>Sting</b> Ray torpedo for the first time on 30 July 2007.|$|E
5|$|Between 1980 and 2000, {{there have}} been four {{recorded}} deaths, all in Tasmania and all due to anaphylactic shock. All known patients who died from jack jumper stings were at least 40 {{years old and had}} cardiopulmonary comorbidities. Severe laryngeal oedema and coronary atherosclerosis was detected in most of the autopsies of those who died. Most of the victims died within 20 minutes after being stung. Prior to any desensitisation program being established, the fatality rate was one person every four years from <b>the</b> <b>sting.</b>|$|E
5|$|In its 2007 expose , the {{political}} weekly Tehelka released hidden camera footage of {{several members of}} the Bharatiya Janata Party, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Bajrang Dal admitting their role in the riots. While the report was criticised for being politically motivated, some newspapers said the revelations simply reinforced what was common knowledge. Several inaccuracies in the statements cast doubt on <b>the</b> <b>sting</b> operation. Bajrangi and Suresh Richard said that Narendra Modi visited Naroda Patiya a day after the massacre to thank them, but the official record shows that Modi did not visit Naroda Patiya. The Gujarat government blocked cable news channels from broadcasting the expose, an action which was criticised by the Editors Guild of India.|$|E
5000|$|When <b>the</b> <b>Stinger</b> missile was {{supplied}} to the Mujahideen, {{they began to}} ambush Soviet helicopters and fixed wing aircraft in proximity of the military airfields. This was because <b>the</b> <b>Stinger</b> was only effective at a range of 15000 ft, requiring the Mujahideen to attack the aircraft as they were landing or taking off. <b>The</b> <b>Stinger,</b> however, was not the [...] "weapon that won the war". Although it did {{have a significant effect}} on the conduct of war, it was not used to shoot down very many aircraft. It did force the Soviets to modify their helicopter tactics. Helicopters begun to cooperate more closely with the ground forces, fixed wing aircraft began flying at higher altitudes, and armor and anti-missile electronic defense systems were added to aircraft to help protect them from <b>the</b> <b>Stinger.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{partnership}} {{with her husband}} Michael, Julia Phillips {{was one of the}} most successful film producers in Hollywood during the 1970s. Their second film, <b>The</b> <b>Sting,</b> grossed almost $160million and won seven Academy Awards, making Julia the first woman to win a Best Picture Oscar. Their third film, Taxi Driver, brought them a second Oscar nomination and won the Palme d'Or in 1976. In 1977 they co-produced their most financially successful movie, Steven Spielberg's $300million-grossing Close Encounters of the Third Kind.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{the episode}} {{would be about}} pool hustling, however as writing ensued, the script went through several incarnations until the Simpsons writers settled on the grifting story seen in the episode. Omine read several books about grifters for {{preparation}} for writing the episode. The other writers also prepared themselves by watching several heist films, including House of Games, Paper Moon and <b>The</b> <b>Sting,</b> the latter {{two of which are}} referenced in the episode. For example, the revelation that Devon Bradley, the FBI agent in the episode who is revealed to be a con artist, was inspired by such films.|$|E
5|$|The {{females are}} iron blue, and have orange legs and black antennae. This is a notable {{distinction}} from Sirex juvencus, which has red antennae. The females also have yellowish wings. The ovipositor {{is below the}} tapering tip of the abdomen. <b>The</b> <b>sting</b> is connected with the mycetangia, which are special organs on the abdomen, where the female stores the oidiae (asexual fungus spores), from broken segments of hyphae. These spores are deposited, together with the eggs, in the host tree wood to germinate. Both larvae and adults have strong mandibles and can drill through lead plates.|$|E

5|$|The {{nature of}} {{treatment}} for a Myrmecia sting depends on {{the severity of the}} reaction. If no signs of an allergic reaction are seen, an ice pack or commercially available spray is used to relieve the pain. Washing the stung area, stingose, and the use of antihistamine tablets are other methods to reduce the pain. Indigenous Australians use bush remedies to treat Myrmecia stings, such as rubbing the tips of bracken ferns onto the stung area. Carpobrotus glaucescens is also used to treat stung areas, using juices that are squeezed and rubbed onto the area, which quickly relieves the pain from <b>the</b> <b>sting.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of Arthur re-intensified somewhat as it traversed The Maritimes; a sting jet with gusts of 65–80mph (100–130km/h) developed along the storm's backside. The former hurricane made an additional landfall {{in the region}} near Fundy National Park by 18:00UTC. By July6, <b>the</b> <b>sting</b> jet had dissipated, and steady weakening of the cyclone resumed as only a split jet provided upper-level support to the storm. Turning back to the northeast, Arthur moved through Labrador later that day. Once over the Labrador Sea, Arthur turned northwest while weakening before doubling back to the southeast. After weakening below gale-force strength, the extratropical system dissipated late on July9.|$|E
5|$|The thorax {{has three}} segments, {{each with a}} pair of robust legs, and a pair of {{membranous}} wings on the hind two segments. The front legs of corbiculate bees bear combs for cleaning the antennae, and in many species the hind legs bear pollen baskets, flattened sections with incurving hairs to secure the collected pollen. The wings are synchronised in flight and the somewhat smaller hind wings connect to the forewings by a row of hooks along their margin which connect to a groove in the forewing. The abdomen has nine segments, the hindermost three being modified into <b>the</b> <b>sting.</b>|$|E
