5|$|Because the Bill of Rights did not {{initially}} {{apply to the}} states, and federal criminal investigations were less common {{in the first century}} of the nation's history, there is little significant case law for the Fourth Amendment before the 20th century.

5|$|In some {{interpretations of}} the novella, the male {{characters}} represent patriarchal society, with Hyde signifying its moral corruption. Other interpretations suggest {{that the lack of}} female companionship for the male characters indicates their latent homosexuality and that Hyde is engaged in homosexual activity. These interpretations are harder <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>to</b> the play because of Sullivan's addition of female characters and heterosexual relationships.|$|E

5|$|The Vicinage clause has {{its roots}} in medieval English {{criminal}} procedure, the perceived abuses of criminal vicinage and venue during the colonial period and Anti-federalist objections to the United States Constitution.

She began teaching Greek Drama, before earning a position teaching literature. By age 30, Godwin had written three novels, {{but was unable to}} get any of them published.|$|E
