40|$|Plants of {{the meadow}} annual Agrostemma githago (Caryophyllaceae) were grown in 1 -m 2 field plots {{prepared}} with three fertilizer treatments as follows: (a) "low", no fertilizer, (b) "medium", 75 g of slow release fertilizer granules, (c) "high", 175 g of granular <b>treatment.</b> <b>After</b> <b>sowing</b> in spring the plants were left until flowering in late summer. Nectar was extracted using 5 -μl glass microcapillary tubes. The material was frozen and sampled at a later date. The samples were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using the AccQtag (Waters Corp.) system. Analysis showed that the total concentration of amino acids increased significantly with increasing fertilizer treatment (P < 0. 05). Of the amino acids present glutamine showed a large and significant increase (P < 0. 01), proline showed an increase (P < 0. 05) and γ-amino butyric acid (GABA) showed a decrease (P < 0. 05). No others showed a significant change. It {{is interesting to note}} that a common biosynthetic pathway (from α-ketoglutarate) links the amino acids that altered in concentration. Due to these changes the relative abundance of about half of the amino acids in the nectar was significantly altered. Glutamine showed a significant increase (P < 0. 001) in percentage of the total with most of the remaining amino acids declining in relative abundance. The results show that, in contradiction to earlier work, soil conditions can affect the amino acid complement of nectar. This may have implications for plant-insect interactions, as local populations of pollinators may benefit from the increased amino acid content of the nectar and preferentially visit plants growing in high nutrient conditions...|$|E

For this purpose Turkish bread wheat cultivar Gönen 98 was used in this research. Changing of proline and lipid peroxidation content (malonyl dialdehyde, MDA) at five different harvesting times (7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 days <b>after</b> <b>sowing)</b> during early vegetative stage was determined in relation to dry matter production and relative water content of leaves.

The decreasing of relative water content and increasing of proline concentration of stressed plants harvested 28 days <b>after</b> <b>sowing</b> was markedly more than at other harvesting times. Water stress caused an increase of MDA content in leaves of plants. It reached highest level 28 days <b>after</b> <b>sowing.</b> The data showed that proline accumulation increased after lipid peroxidation content became higher and relative water content of leaves became lower.

40|$|The Forestier {{silvicultural}} systems {{trial was}} established {{over the period}} 1987 to 1989 and was designed to evaluate a variety of silvicultural systems in wet eucalypt forests. Treatments tested included clearfelling and sowing, with and without burning; harvesting of small gaps (group selection) of approximately 100 m diameter, with and without burning; and partial logging, which involved thinning of the overstorey. Successful regeneration was achieved only in the coupes that were clearfelled, burnt and sown. Stocking levels were adequate in the partially logged <b>treatments</b> shortly <b>after</b> <b>sowing</b> but declined in subsequent years {{and the result was}} poor by age five. Regeneration in all other treatments was unsuccessful. The ultimate failure of the regeneration within the alternative treatments is attributed to the intense browsing pressure which is thought to have followed the harvesting. Partial logging resulted in a noticeable increase in the growth rate of the retained trees in those treatments where between three quarters and one half of the trees were removed. However, thinning also resulted in a major proliferation of epicormic shoot development on the boles of the retained stems. The results of this trial have been compromised by the lack of browsing monitoring and subsequent control. The trial has clearly demonstrated that monitoring of browsing damage to regeneration, and control of browsing animals where damage levels are unacceptable, {{is an essential part of}} native forest silviculture...|$|R

40|$|The {{germination}} {{process of}} mustard seeds (Sinapis alba L.) {{has been characterized}} by the time courses of water uptake, rupturing of the seed coat (12 hours <b>after</b> <b>sowing),</b> onset of axis growth (18 hours <b>after</b> <b>sowing),</b> and {{the point of no}} return, where the seeds lose the ability to survive redesiccation (12 to 24 hours <b>after</b> <b>sowing,</b> depending on embryo part). Abscisic acid (ABA) reversibly arrests embryo development at the brink of radicle growth initiation, inhibiting the water uptake which accompanies embryo growth. Seeds which have been kept dormant by ABA for several days will, after removal of the hormone, rapidly take up water and continue the germination process. Seeds which have been preincubated in water lose the sensitivity to be arrested by ABA after about 12 hours <b>after</b> <b>sowing.</b> This escape from ABA-mediated dormancy is not due to an inactivation of the hormone but to a loss of competence to respond to ABA during the course of germination.

40|$|The {{effects of}} three tillage {{practices}} (minimum tillage 7 cm depth, conventional tillage 15 cm depth, and deep tillage 50 cm depth) on some soil physical properties and Cotton (Gossypium barbadence L.) performance and yield were {{studied at the}} Gezira Research Station Farm, at Wad Medani during 1989 ̸ 1990 season. It was found that bulk density values {{were not significantly different}} at the upper depths (0 - 15 cm and 15 - 30 cm) but at 45 - 60 cm depth bulk density was significantly lower under deep tillage than under minimum tillage. conventional tillage resulted in higher bulk density compared to deep tillage but the differences were not significant. The differences between conventional tillage and minimum tillage were not significant. Soil penetration resistance was periodically measured to 40 cm depth. At all measurement periods, deep tillage resulted in the lowest soil penetration resistance (SPR) for all depths followed by minimum tillage and conventional tillage. There {{were no significant differences in}} SPR between tillage practices at the upper depths (10 - 20 cm and 20 - 30 cm), while at the lower depth (30 - 40 cm) tillage treatments were significantly different. It was found that moisture depletion decreased with increasing depth for all measurement periods. Maximum depletion was limited to the top 30 cm for all treatments. Results showed no significant differences between tillage treatments but moisture depletion under deep tillage was higher compared to conventional and minimum tillage. No significant differences were observed in infiltration rate, wetting front depth and cumulative intake between the <b>treatments</b> 28 weeks <b>after</b> <b>sowing</b> however, deep tillage improved soil infiltratio...|$|R

40|$|Pattern of 3 H-uridine {{incorporation}} into RNA of spores of Onoclea sensibilis imbibed in complete darkness (non-germinating conditions) and induced to germinate in red light {{was followed by}} oligo-dT cellulose chromatography, gel electrophoresis coupled with fluorography and autoradiography. In dark-imbibed spores, RNA synthesis was initiated about 24 h <b>after</b> <b>sowing,</b> {{with most of the}} label accumulating in the high mol. wt. poly(A) -RNA fraction. There was no incorporation of the label into poly(A) +RNA until 48 h <b>after</b> <b>sowing.</b> In contrast, photo-induced spores began to synthesize all fractions of RNA within 12 h <b>after</b> <b>sowing</b> and by 24 h, incorporation of 3 H-uridine into RNA of irradiated spores was nearly 70 -fold higher than that into dark-imbibed spores. Protein synthesis, as monitored by 3 H-arginine {{incorporation into}} the acid-insoluble fraction and by autoradiography, was initiated in spores within 1 - 2 h <b>after</b> <b>sowing</b> under both conditions. Autoradiographic experiments also showed that onset of protein synthesis in the cytoplasm of the germinating spore is independent of the transport of newly synthesized nuclear RNA. One-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 35 S-methionine-labelled proteins revealed a good correspondence between proteins synthesized in a cell-free translation system directed by poly(A) +RNA of dormant spores and those synthesized in vivo by dark-imbibed and photo-induced spores. These results indicate that stored mRNAs of O. sensibilis spores are functionally competent and provide templates for the synthesis of proteins during dark-imbibition and germination...|$|R
