5|$|Around {{midnight on}} Sunday morning, March 18, 1990, a red Dodge Daytona pulled {{up near the}} side {{entrance}} of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum along Palace Road. Two men with fake police uniforms waited {{for at least an}} hour in the car, possibly trying to avoid being noticed by people leaving a St. Patrick's Day party nearby. Later at around 1a.m., security guard Richard Abath returned to the front desk after patrolling the museum to switch positions with the other security guard. The two guards were the only people in the building. At this time, Abath opened and quickly shut the Palace Road door, claiming he was trained <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> ensure the door was locked. He claimed security logs from other nights would show that he had done this many times previously. The FBI has seized the logs, but has not commented on the issue further.|$|E
5|$|The Joes {{locate the}} secret base and fly there, as McCullen loads three {{missiles}} with nanowarheads, which are aimed for Beijing, Moscow, and Washington, DC, the world's {{three most important}} cities. He intends <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> strike fear into the hearts of every man, woman, and child on the planet, after which they will turn to {{the person with the}} most power in the world, the President of the United States. After Snake Eyes takes out one missile, Ripcord destroys the remaining two by using a stolen M.A.R.S. prototype Night Raven jet, while Scarlett, Breaker, and Snake Eyes infiltrate the base. Snake Eyes duels and prevails over Storm Shadow. Duke learns that the Doctor is Rex Lewis, Ana's brother, believed to have been killed by a mistimed airstrike during a mission led by Duke (also the origin of the alienation between Duke and Ana). Rex had encountered Doctor Mindbender (Kevin J. O'Connor) in the bunker and was seduced by the nanomite technology, taking too long to retrieve the data and getting caught in the bombing, which disfigured him. After freeing Duke, the Baroness is subdued, as the Doctor reveals he has implanted her with nanomites, which has put her under his control for the past four years. Attempting to kill Duke, McCullen ends up being burned, so the Doctor and he flee to an escape vessel. Duke and the Baroness pursue him while the Joes fall back; when the Doctor activates the base's self-destruct sequence, which involves 'blowing the ice cap' to create blocks of ice which then nearly crush the Joes.|$|E

500|$|The Battle of Towton was {{associated}} with a tradition previously upheld in the villages of Tysoe, Warwickshire. For centuries the villagers had {{made it a point to}} clear an area on a slope of the Vale of the Red Horse on each anniversary of the engagement, exposing a large figure of a horse cut into the red soil. They claimed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> honour the Earl of Warwick's inspirational deed of slaying his horse to show his resolve to stand and fight with the common soldiers. Local historian Mary Dormer Harris believed that the villagers modified the original Red Horse, which dated to pre-historic times, to a version that reflected mediaeval horses. The tradition died in 1798 when the Inclosure Acts implemented by the English government redesignated the common land, on which the equine figure was located, as private property. [...] The scouring was revived during the early 20th century but has since stopped.|$|E
500|$|... "Bedtime Story" [...] {{was written}} by Icelandic singer-songwriter Björk, Marius De Vries and Hooper, and co-produced by Madonna and Hooper. According to author Mark Pytlik in his book Björk: Wow and Flutter, Madonna was {{inspired}} at that time by Björk's second studio album, Debut (1993). Through her connections with De Vries and Hooper, Madonna {{got in touch with}} Björk and offered her a chance to write a track for Bedtime Stories. Björk did not consider herself a fan of Madonna's music, but she was intrigued by the offer and she accepted it. She wrote a song initially named [...] "Let's Get Unconscious", with the opening lyrics [...] "Today is the last day, That I'm using words"—the lines being born out of Björk's own criticism of Madonna's aesthetic. The singer clarified, [...] "When I was offered to write a song for , I couldn't really picture me doing a song that would suit her... But on second thought, I decided <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> write the things I have always wanted to hear her say that she's never said." ...|$|E

2500|$|Speaking {{about her}} {{relationship}} with Prince {{in an interview with}} Norwegian station NRK in November 2014 she said, [...] "I did meet him a couple of times. [...] We didn’t get on at all. [...] In fact we had a punch-up." [...] She continued: [...] "He summoned me to his house after 'Nothing Compares 2U'. I made it without him. [...] I’d never met him. [...] He summoned me to his house – and it’s foolish <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> an Irish woman – he said he didn’t like me saying bad words in interviews. So I told him to fuck off....He got quite violent. I had to escape out of his house at 5 in the morning. He packed a bigger punch than mine." [...] She told a similar story to an interviewer from Hot Press in December 1990. Prince said the events she described never took place, replying to the allegations in his song [...] "Days of Wild", which deals with misogyny. In a 2004 interview with Graham Norton, O'Connor claimed that the story was [...] "much exaggerated by the press" [...] and referred to him as [...] "a sweet guy".|$|E
2500|$|How can {{understanding}} of species' natural history aid their effective conservation in human-dominated ecosystems? [...] Humans often conduct activities {{that allow for}} the incorporation of other species, whether as a by-product or {{as a result of}} a focus on nature. [...] Traditional natural history can only inform how best <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>to</b> a certain degree, because landscapes have been changed so dramatically. [...] However, there is much more to learn through direct study of species' ecology in human-dominated ecosystems, through what is known as focused natural history. [...] Rosenzweig [...] cites four examples: shrikes (Laniidae) thrived in altered landscapes when wooden fence post perches allowed them easy access to pouncing on prey, but inhospitable steel fence posts contributed to their decline. [...] Replacing steel fence posts with wood fence posts reverses the shrikes' decline and allows humans to determine the reasons for the distribution and abundance of shrikes. [...] Additionally, the cirl bunting (Emberiza cirlus) thrived on farms when fields alternated between harvests and hay, but declined where farmers began to plant winter grain crops, natterjack toads (Bufo calamatus) declined when reductions in sheep grazing ceased to alter ponds to their preferred shape and depth, and longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) declined in the Southeastern United States when lack of wildfires prevented its return after timbering. [...] Thus, applying focused natural history in human-dominated landscapes can contribute to conservation efforts.|$|E
