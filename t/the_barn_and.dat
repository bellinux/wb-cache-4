5|$|At sunset, {{the group}} {{discusses}} Randall's fate, and Dale's arguments {{have failed to}} sway the group, and he storms out. Rick, Shane, and Daryl return to <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> <b>and</b> Rick prepares to shoot Randall when Carl runs in and urges his father to do it. Rick is horrified and stops the execution, much to Shane's annoyance.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus) and Glenn (Steven Yeun) {{report the}} death and {{reanimation}} of Randall to the others, but also that he turned without being bit. Lori Grimes (Sarah Wayne Callies) begs Daryl {{to go out and}} search for Rick and Shane. However, they too soon see the walker horde and start arming themselves. While Rick's group is ready to abandon the farm, Hershel Greene (Scott Wilson) intends to protect his land with his own life, if needed. As the group starts to dispatch walkers, Rick and Carl are able to lure a number into <b>the</b> <b>barn,</b> <b>and</b> set it ablaze. Jimmy (James Allen McCune) drives the RV near <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> <b>and</b> allows Rick and Carl to safely escape the burning barn, but he is killed when the walkers overrun the RV.|$|E
5|$|Fortunately for the Invaders, one {{of their}} members Mike Shonsey managed to slip from <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> <b>and</b> was able to contact Governor Barber the next day.

5|$|As {{the militia}} fell back, {{the three men}} who had set out in search of their horses {{returned}} and they too {{were killed by the}} Native American forces. The natives continued to assault <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> <b>and</b> cabin; their attacks did not cease and during the battle about 25 horses were killed. Finally, the native forces withdrew, leaving nine of their own dead behind. The June 25 battle was the last of the Black Hawk War on Illinois soil. Dement's company lost five men with another three were wounded, many horses were killed as well.|$|E
5|$|Glenn (Steven Yeun), at {{the urging}} of Dale (Jeffrey DeMunn), finally tells the group that the Greene family's barn is full of walkers. The group {{inspects}} <b>the</b> <b>barn,</b> <b>and</b> Shane (Jon Bernthal) believes they should clear the barn, but Rick (Andrew Lincoln) believes they need to get Hershel (Scott Wilson)'s blessing since they are still guests on his property. Shane criticizes Rick for continuing the seemingly pointless search for Carol (Melissa McBride)'s daughter Sophia, infuriating Daryl (Norman Reedus).|$|E

5|$|The {{property}} {{contains the}} house and two outbuildings; <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> <b>and</b> the remains of an old windmill foundation. Constructed in 1861, the Glidden House adheres mostly to a French Colonial style of architecture. The raised basement and full-length porch {{are two of the}} architectural elements found on the Glidden House that are consistently found in French Colonial homes. The barn, a building of high historical significance, was not included as part of the National Register listing for the property until 2002, nearly 30 years after the original nomination was approved.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>barn</b> <b>and</b> the {{surrounding}} Manor Farm property were purchased in 1986 by the John Wiltshier Group, a builder/property developer which aimed {{to restore the}} barn {{to serve as a}} showcase for the company. The farm underwent major changes, with several of the more dilapidated buildings demolished and a new L-shaped office building constructed facing the barn. Planning permission was granted on the basis that income from the new offices was supposed to pay for ongoing repairs to the barn, following an initial renovation carried out in 1989. However, in 2006, the company went into receivership. The other buildings were individually sold to new owners but the receiver's attempts to sell the barn separately fell through.|$|E
25|$|The October 26, 1929, {{edition of}} the Rhinebeck Gazette {{describes}} bins found in the top story or garret of the house. These were traditionally used to store grain {{out of the reach}} of pilfering Indians. However, there are more practical reasons that local grain was stored in the garret of the house. It was more secure from rodents in <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> <b>and</b> would have been a dryer atmosphere, because even when heat was not required, a fire for cooking was always burning in the fireplace.|$|E

25|$|Once at the site, the Jews were {{housed in}} <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> <b>and</b> taken {{in groups of}} 20 of a time to a point 40 or 50 meters from the trench, where they were ordered to lie {{face down on the}} ground. Groups of ten were then ordered to stand up, and, except for children, remove their outer clothing. As they were moved closer to the pit, they were ordered to strip completely. A Latvian guard, Bulvāns, later testified that he saw two Germans, SS-Scharführer ("squad leader") Karl-Emil Strott and Philip (or Filip) Krapp, using a whip on people who did not move on to the pit.|$|E
25|$|The next day, Lennie accidentally kills his puppy while {{stroking}} it.

After finding out about Lennie's habit, she offers to let him stroke her hair, but panics and begins to scream when she feels his strength. Lennie becomes frightened, and unintentionally breaks her neck thereafter and runs away. When the other ranch hands find the corpse, George realizes that their dream is at an end. George hurries to find Lennie, hoping he {{will be at the}} meeting place they designated in case he got into trouble.|$|E

25|$|Ex-Governor Charles Robinson was {{an object}} of special search among them. He {{was one of the}} men they {{particularly}} wanted. During the whole time they were in town he was in his large stone barn on the hillside. He had just gone to the barn to get his team to drive out into the country, when he saw them come in and saw them make their first charge. He concluded to remain where he was. The barn overlooked the whole town, and he saw the affair from beginning to end. Gangs of raiders came by several times and looked at <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> <b>and</b> went round it, but it looked so much like a fort, that they kept out of range.|$|E
25|$|The next oldest {{buildings}} are the barn, the bunkhouse, the smaller {{of the wooden}} sheds, and the storage building (commissary), {{all of which were}} constructed circa 1910. The barn is the largest building in the district, measuring 60 feet long by 35 feet wide. Two stories tall, the walls are covered with board-and-batt siding, and has a corrugated metal roof of medium pitch. It has two single-story additions. The northern addition is 60 feet long with a shed roof, while the eastern addition runs the length of the original structure, widening the footprint of the barn by 15 feet. It has a lean-to structure. The entire barn complex is enclosed by a corral, which has a split rail fence approximately 5 feet high. Also within the corral is a 15 by 15 foot granary. Built circa 1940, it is constructed with the same materials as <b>the</b> <b>barn,</b> <b>and</b> has a shed roof.|$|E
25|$|The Kamnas {{had four}} children, though one {{died in an}} {{accident}} at the farm at age three. One son, Edgar, in time took over the farming on the farm. About 1910 the Kamna family built an addition to <b>the</b> <b>barn,</b> <b>and</b> around 1920 built a second addition to the barn. They continued adding buildings to the farm in the early 1900s including a woodshed, privy, pumphouse, chicken coop, smokehouse, potato shed, and a canning shed. The last addition was a garage in the 1920s. In the 1920s the family added indoor plumbing to the farmhouse, {{and in the process}} enclosed parts of two porches. The Kamnas grew oats, fescue, rye grass, vetch, and sub-clover on the farm and used the barn for sorting and packing the seeds, running the farm into the 1950s. As of 2007 the farm was owned by Wayne Reed and Petrina Pometto. On October 10, 2007, the Manning–Kamna Farm was added to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E

25|$|King Tirian of Narnia {{calls on}} Aslan for help, and Jill and Eustace arrive in Narnia. They help Tirian and the {{remaining}} loyal Narnians battle the Calormenes and their allies, but are all forced through the stable door along with several Black Dwarfs. They find themselves not {{within the confines of}} a stable, but in a paradise: Aslan's Country. Aslan is there, with King Peter and the other Pevensies (except for Susan, who no longer believes in Narnia) with other characters from previous books, and they watch through the stable door as the world of Narnia is destroyed with the dragons and the salamanders ripping up the trees and Father Time crushing the sun. All of the people and animals (including those who had previously died) gather outside <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> <b>and</b> are judged by Aslan. The animals who have been loyal to Aslan or the morality upheld by Narnians join Aslan in Aslan's Country. The animals who have opposed or deserted him become ordinary animals and vanish to an unknown place that not even C.S. Lewis knows where they went. The Black Dwarfs (who unlike the Red Dwarfs have lost faith in Aslan) are unable to see Aslan's Country, certain that they are still inside an ordinary stable. When Lucy asks Aslan to help them, he tells her that he will show her what he can and what he cannot do. He then growls at the Black Dwarfs, and makes food magically appear in their hands. This fails to convince them: they think that the growling is a machine and that the food is only what would normally be found in a stable. Aslan tells the children that the Black Dwarfs shut themselves out from him, and therefore cannot be reached, much like Uncle Andrew in The Magician's Nephew.|$|E
25|$|Through many generations, it {{remained}} in the Taylor family until 1896, when Lucy W. Taylor sold the farm to George and William Bray, two brothers {{who had worked for}} the Taylors, and who were probably distant relatives. The property that Lucy sold for $400 included 50 acres (20 hectares) of uplands and adjacent marshlands which were capable of producing each year six tons of a combination of salt and fresh hay. The deed described the property as being in that part of Yarmouth known as Hockanom. It was sustained as a prosperous working farm by the Bray family until 1941. They continued to harvest salt marsh hay from Black Flat Marsh to feed their farm animals. The Brays often sold their strawberry and blueberry crops from a wheelbarrow on Old Kings Highway. In 1946 Robert J Williams purchased the farm and 88 acres for the tax due on the property. He moved from New Jersey to work for the Buzzards Bay Gas company until he retired. Robert Williams along with wife Katherin and son Robert Jr. lived on the farm and restored and improved the original farmhouse and surrounding land. They also improved <b>the</b> <b>barn</b> <b>and</b> a small apartment built {{into the side of the}} hill under the large ice-age boulder adjacent to the barn. Robert Williams introduced sheep to the farm and maintained them throughout his ownership. Although he worked a full-time job, he raised the sheep like the proud Welshman he was. He showed his sheep all over Massachusetts in county fairs. He sheared them and sold the wool. He also had several large vegetable gardens as well as wild and cultivated blueberries, and raspberries. The farm provided a great deal of food for the family. Robert Jr. built a home up the road for his new wife, and had a son in that house in the mid-1950s. Later he would move the family to south Yarmouth. The grandchildren would spend weekends on the farm up until the mid-1960s. The Williams family sold the farm they loved and cared for to a developer in the 1970s when Katherine became ill and could not keep up with the demands of the property. The terms stipulated that the farmhouse and barn be preserved. The Williams family saved the farm from destruction in the 1940s and in the 1970s. By the late 1980s, ownership changed hands a number of times, and the buildings saw neglect.|$|E
