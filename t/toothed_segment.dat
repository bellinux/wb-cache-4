5000|$|Astrantia bavarica reaches {{on average}} 30 cm of height. The stem is erect and glabrous, with little {{branches}} and few leaves. The basal leaves {{have a long}} petiole 10 - 20 cm, 3 to 7 lobes and <b>toothed</b> <b>segments.</b> Size: 8 - 15 cm. The cauline leaves are generally two, sessile, [...] and lanceolate-shaped with a trilobed apex. The inflorescence is umbrella-shaped, with 2 - 3 cm of diameter. The floral bracts are numerous (10 - 20), 10 - 18 mm long, greenish-white with acuminate apex. The small flowers are greenish-white (with pink undertones). The central ones are hermaphrodite, while the external ones are male. The flowering period extends from April through to November. It has a RHS Hardiness Rating: H7.|$|R

50|$|The glossy {{leaves are}} 15 - 45 cm long, long-stalked, {{alternate}} and palmate with 5-12 deep lobes with coarsely <b>toothed</b> <b>segments.</b> In some varieties they start off dark reddish purple or bronze when young, gradually changing {{to a dark}} green, sometimes with a reddish tinge, as they mature. The leaves of some other varieties are green practically from the start, whereas in yet others a pigment masks the green colour of all the chlorophyll-bearing parts, leaves, stems and young fruit, so that they remain a dramatic purple-to-reddish-brown throughout {{the life of the}} plant. Plants with the dark leaves can be found growing next to those with green leaves, so there is most likely only a single gene controlling the production of the pigment in some varieties. The stems (and the spherical, spiny seed capsules) also vary in pigmentation. The fruit capsules of some varieties are more showy than the flowers.|$|R

50|$|Woodsia plummerae is {{a species}} of fern known by the common name Plummer's cliff fern. It is native to the southwestern United States and {{northern}} Mexico, where it grows in rocky habitat in deserts and other areas. It has leaves up to 25 centimeters long with flexible reddish or purplish rachises covered in glandular hairs.

5000|$|Pedicularis semibarbata is a {{perennial}} herb producing several stems up to 20 centimeters long from a caudex, {{but most of}} the stem is beneath the soil and the plant is low on the ground.

50|$|Perideridia howellii is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the carrot family known by the common name Howell's yampah. It is native to the mountains of Oregon and northern California, where it grows in moist soils, often near streams and rivers. It is a perennial herb which may exceed 1.5 metres in maximum height, its slender, erect stem growing from a cluster of many narrow fibrous roots measuring up to 15 centimetres long. Leaves near {{the base of the}} plant have lance-shaped blades up to half a metre long which are divided into many leaflets made up of <b>toothed,</b> oval <b>segments.</b> Leaves higher on the plant are similar, but generally smaller. The inflorescence is a compound umbel of many spherical clusters of small white flowers. These yield ribbed, oblong-shaped fruits each about half a centimetre long.|$|R
40|$|The article {{considers}} {{the problem of}} reducing energy consumption in the mountainous arable farming and approved {{that one of the}} effective ways to solve this problem is minimal technology of tillage machines with disk working organs, using cultivators and harrows. Is proposed for universal working organ of minimum tillage, which is a spherical disc welded with <b>segmented</b> <b>toothed</b> flat disk. When machining of soil with the elaborated spherical working body the value of overlap groove decreases, provided loosening of the ridges formed between the grooves, which provide high technological quality of soil processing and stability of aggregate motion.
