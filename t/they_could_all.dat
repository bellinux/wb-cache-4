5|$|Among {{the many}} {{technical}} {{challenges of the}} ion-deposition apparatus was obtaining a sufficiently high ion current (mass deposition rate) while simultaneously decelerating the ions so <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>all</b> deposit onto a target electrode embedded in a balance pan. Experiments with gold showed the ions had to be decelerated to very low energies to avoid sputtering effects—a phenomenon whereby ions {{that had already been}} counted ricochet off the target electrode or even dislodged atoms that had already been deposited. The deposited mass fraction in the 2003 German experiments only approached very close to 100% at ion energies of less than around 1eV (<1km/s for gold).|$|E
5|$|One of the {{significant}} events of Darius's early reign was the slaying of Intaphernes, {{one of the seven}} noblemen who had deposed the previous ruler and installed Darius as the new monarch. The seven had made an agreement that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>all</b> visit the new king whenever they pleased, except when he was with his wife. One evening, Intaphernes went to the palace to meet Darius, but was stopped by two officers who stated that Darius had retired for the night. Becoming enraged and insulted, Intaphernes drew his sword and cut off the ears and noses of the two officers. While leaving the palace, he took the bridle from his horse, and tied the two officers together. The officers went to the king and showed him what Intaphernes had done to them. Darius began to fear for his own safety; he thought that all seven noblemen had banded together to rebel against him and that the attack against his officers was the first sign of revolt. He sent a messenger to each of the noblemen, asking them if they approved of Intaphernes's actions. They denied and disavowed any connection with Intaphernes's actions, stating that they stood by their decision to appoint Darius as King of Kings.|$|E

25|$|Sauropods {{that have}} been {{discovered}} include Diplodocus (most famously, the first nearly complete specimen of D. carnegii, which is now exhibited at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), Camarasaurus (the most commonly found sauropod), Brachiosaurus, Apatosaurus, Brontosaurus, Barosaurus, the uncommon Haplocanthosaurus and Supersaurus. The very diversity of the sauropods has raised some questions about how <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>all</b> co-exist. While their body shapes are very similar (long neck, long tail, huge elephant-like body), they are assumed to have had very different feeding strategies, in order for all to have existed {{in the same time}} frame and similar environment.|$|E
500|$|The name Ladas, {{derived from}} that of Alexander the Great's messenger, had {{previously}} been used by Lord Rosebery's father for a horse who ran unplaced in the 1869 Derby. Rosebery, then an under-graduate at Oxford University, had tipped the horse to his friends as a likely winner and was reportedly mortified by the result. By way of an apology, Rosebery told his friends that if he ever had a horse with a [...] "prime chance" [...] of winning the Derby, he would name him [...] "Ladas" [...] so that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>all</b> [...] "take the tip and back him." [...] It was the memory of this incident which reportedly persuaded Rosebery to abandon his original plan to name the colt [...] "Hampton Wick".|$|E

Of particular interest were the recent murders of Tracey Turner and Samo Paull, whose bodies were also found on motorways after they had been strangled. McCammont ruled out a link at a press conference on 4 January: [...] "I would stress that at this stage there is no firm evidence whatsoever to link Celine's murder with any other investigations." [...] He appealed for information concerning a bottle of Pascal Chretien champagne, a gift given to Figard before she came to England: [...] "This particular type of champagne is not exported to anywhere in the world outside France and is not sold in this country. It is a 1993 vintage and only 60,000 bottles have been produced." ...|$|E

500|$|By October 2013, Marvel was {{preparing}} four drama series and a miniseries, totaling 60 episodes, {{to present to}} video on demand services and cable providers, with Netflix, Amazon, and WGN America expressing interest. In November 2013, {{it was announced that}} Disney would provide Netflix with live-action series based on Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist, and Luke Cage, leading up to a miniseries based on the Defenders. Disney CEO Bob Iger stated that Netflix was chosen to air the shows, [...] "when Disney realized it could use the streaming service as a way to grow the popularity of the characters". He added that, if the characters prove popular, they could become feature films. Loeb later stated that Marvel was not [...] "interested in making four pilots and then hoping someday that <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>all</b> get together. Netflix really understood what it is we wanted to do. They're very open to directors that might not have that same opportunity in broadcast television. The notion of having all 13 episodes at one time, particularly in serialized storytelling, is very appealing." [...] Loeb also added that the four characters chosen [...] "all had a previous existing relationship and all grew up on the same kind of stoop in New York [...] So it lent itself to a world. Does that mean these shows {{are going to be the}} same? No. They can't be. The characters have different issues, different problems, different feelings about them ... the example that I continually give is that I cannot think of two films that are more different in tone than [...] and Guardians of the Galaxy. And yet, if you watch them back to back, they feel very Marvel. They feel very much like, 'Oh, it is still the same universe that I'm in.'" ...|$|E
