5|$|Australia carried eight BL 12-inch Mark X guns in four BVIII* twin turrets; {{the largest}} guns fitted to any Australian warship. Two turrets were mounted {{fore and aft}} on the centreline, {{identified}} as 'A' and 'X' respectively. The other two were wing turrets mounted amidships and staggered diagonally: 'P' was forward and to port of the centre funnel, while 'Q' was situated starboard and aft. Each wing turret had some limited ability to fire <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>side.</b> Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen BL 4-inch Mark VII guns positioned in the superstructure. She mounted two submerged tubes for 18-inch torpedoes, {{one on each side}} aft of 'X' barbette, and 12 torpedoes were carried.|$|E

5|$|Serious issues {{concerning}} {{safety and security}} in the building arose after Donald Trump was declared as President-elect of the United States on November 8, 2016. Trump Tower {{had served as a}} rallying point for the protests against Donald Trump {{in the days after the}} election's results were announced, thus requiring extra deployments of security officials. The Federal Aviation Administration imposed a no-fly zone over Trump Tower until January 20, 2017, and the NYPD stated that it was projected to spend $35 million to provide security to the tower, of which $7 million would be repaid by Congress. The NYPD later revised its estimate to $24 million. Street closures were imposed along the east side of Fifth Avenue and on the north side of 56th Street, with NYPD officers stopping and questioning pedestrians on these sidewalks as to their destinations. The block of 56th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues was closed completely to vehicular traffic, but part of the street west of Madison Avenue was later reopened to allow local deliveries. Customers to the Gucci and Tiffany's stores in Trump Tower's lobby were allowed to proceed, while other pedestrians were redirected <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> of the street. During presidential visits, dump trucks from the New York City Department of Sanitation were parked outside the tower to prevent car bombs. The press nicknamed the now-heavily secured building White House North, comparing it to the White House's West Wing.|$|E

5|$|The {{depression}} strengthened {{further and}} officially attained tropical storm status at 0000UTC on December 27, {{based on the}} analysis by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), though the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) unofficially classified it as a tropical storm six hours prior. Shortly thereafter, an eye with a 39km (24mi) diameter became apparent on satellite imagery, along with rainbands extending southward <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> of the equator. At 0600UTC, the JMA first classified the system as Tropical Storm Vamei, about 65km (40mi) northeast of Singapore, and the agency estimated the storm attained peak winds of 85km/h (50mph) at the same time. However, the JTWC upgraded Vamei to typhoon status with peak winds of 140km/h (85mph), based on a United States Navy ship report from within the eye; a second ship reported wind gusts of 195km/h (120mph) in the southern portion of the eyewall. The storm was small and compact, with gales extending about 45km (30mi) from its center. At about 0830UTC on December 27, Vamei made landfall approximately 60km (35mi) northeast of Singapore, in the southeastern portion of the Malaysian state of Johor. Initially, the Malaysian Meteorological Department (MetMalaysia) classified the cyclone as a tropical storm, though it was later re-assessed as a typhoon at landfall.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of commencement, Alumni Hall is {{outfitted}} with patriotic red white and blue banners and flags. Commencement exercises begin each year at 1:50 pm {{as members of the}} senior class gather in the Stoutenburg Gymnasium and process through the campus, crossing by the Cushing Center and Hilary Hall and arriving at Alumni Hall for the commencement ceremony. The graduating class processes onto the quad to the designated seating area directly in front of Alumni Hall as a hired brass ensemble plays the Pomp and Circumstance March. If the weather is inclement, commencement takes place in the Thomas F. Sullivan Arena. The academic processional of the College's Mace, color guard, graduands, members of the monastic community, and the faculty can take over twenty minutes. The national anthem is performed by a student or students selected. The performer is usually a member of the Saint Anselm College Choir. Next, a student selected by the administration delivers the coveted student address that he/she submitted for consideration. This is followed by the College President's address. The faculty award of the year from the Saint Anselm College Chapter of the American Association of University Professors is presented to a deserving faculty member. The student award for service and citizenship is presented to a community service-minded senior in recognition for an outstanding community project. This award is not given every year, only when there is consensus among administration that a particular student is deserving. Honorary doctorates are then conferred among selected honorary degree recipients. After the keynote address by one of the honorary degree recipients, the graduates are awarded their degrees of Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science. After the benediction, graduates flip their graduation tassel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> of their cap and process out to the recessional song as the Abbey bells resound throughout campus. Finally, family and friends meet with the new graduates to take photographs.|$|E

50|$|Ceva studied {{geometry}} {{for most}} of his long life. In 1678, he published a now famous theorem on synthetic geometry in a triangle called Ceva’s Theorem. <b>The</b> theorem,already known <b>to</b> Yusuf Al-Mu'taman ibn Hűd in 11th century, states that if three line segments are drawn from the vertices of a triangle <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>sides,</b> then <b>the</b> three line segments are concurrent if, and only if, the product of the ratios of the newly created line segments {{on each side of the}} triangle is equal to one.

30|$|Most recently, several {{important}} breakthroughs {{have increased the}} brightness of IFN-λs as a new spotlight in innate immunity.

In this structure, the IFN-λ 3 helical bundle binds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> gorge formed by the two domains at the distal ends of its two receptors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cellular membrane. In contrast, the two receptors bind <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>sides</b> of <b>the</b> helical bundles of type I IFNs (Mendoza et al., 2017).|$|R

25|$|Professional-level timpani {{use either}} the ratchet or {{friction}} system and have copper bowls. These drums can {{have one of}} two styles of pedals. The Dresden pedal is attached at the side nearest the timpanist and is operated by ankle motion. A Berlin-style pedal is attached {{by means of a}} long arm <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> of the timpani, and the timpanist must use his entire leg to adjust the pitch. In addition to a pedal, high-end instruments have a hand-operated fine-tuner, which allows the timpanist to make minute pitch adjustments. The pedal is on either the left or right side of the drum depending on where it is set up.|$|E
25|$|The eye is {{connected}} to the visual cortex by the optic nerve coming {{out of the back of}} the eye. The two optic nerves come together behind the eyes at the optic chiasm, where about half of the fibers from each eye cross over <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> and join fibers from the other eye representing the corresponding visual field, the combined nerve fibers from both eyes forming the optic tract. This ultimately forms the physiological basis of binocular vision. The tracts project to a relay station in the midbrain called the lateral geniculate nucleus, part of the thalamus, and then to the visual cortex along a collection of nerve fibers called the optic radiation.|$|E
25|$|In June 2007, the City of Calgary {{released}} {{information on}} the schedule for the refurbishment of the remaining original downtown stations.

25|$|A {{few years}} ago there were many {{children}} and men who turned out immediately after a snow-fall, and were daily to be met during the thaw, brushing the crossings as clean as they could. For this small service many foot passengers gladly gave a few small coins, regarding the sweepers not as beggars or vagrants, but as laborers, whose hard and disagreeable work enabled well-shod people to pass neatly on their way. There has, however, been a prohibition of street sweepers...The result is that on Wednesday last...there was not one crossing on which they snow and mud did not come full two inches above the sole of a thick gaiter, and it was entirely impossible to find a single crossing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> of the avenue which could be trod without sinking to the ankle...let us have the volunteer sweepers back for the comfort of a LADY PEDESTRIAN.|$|E
25|$|Topic marking 2 (tm2) and topic marking 3 (tm3) {{are both}} used with base-generated topics. Tm2 is {{characterized}} by raised eyebrows, widened eyes, and the head tilted backwards and to the side. Toward {{the end of the}} sign the head moves forward and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>side,</b> and there is a pause and often an eye blink before continuing. For tm3 the eyebrows are raised and the eyes are opened wide, the head starts tilted down and jerks up and down, the lips are opened and raised, and the head is nodded rapidly a few times before pausing and continuing the sentence. Although both tm2 and tm3 accompany base-generated topics, they are used in different contexts. Tm2 is used to introduce new information and change the topic of a conversation to something that the signer is going to subsequently characterize, while tm3 is used to introduce new information that the signer believes is already known by his/her interlocutor. Tm2 may be used with any base-generated topic, whereas only topics that are co-referential with an argument in the sentence may be marked with tm3.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} half of 2002, the {{entrance}} to the Tower of Terror was relocated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>side</b> of the track. This was followed by the closure of the Central Cafe, Kennyland and part of Village Oval. Shortly after, a temporary children's area opened in Gum Tree Gully. Known as the Kid's Carnival, the area featured several of the rides from Kennyland including the Dream Copters, Kenny Karts and Adventure Trails. A children's ferris wheel was also included in the lineup. In August 2002, it was announced that Dreamworld would be adding Nickelodeon Central, however, specific details at the time were sparse. After investing $7 million Dreamworld officially opened Nickelodeon Central on 26 December 2002. New attractions included Rugrats Runaway Reptar roller coaster, Wild Thornberry's Rainforest Rampage and the Slime Bowl. The Zumer from the Country Fair themed area was relocated to Nickelodeon Central and rethemed to Swinger Zinger. Kennyland's Dream Copters ride was relocated and resumed operation under the same name and theme. The existing Carousel, Bumper Bowl and Avalanche were renamed to Nick-O-Round, Rocket Power Bumper Beach and Angry Beavers Spooty Spin, respectively.|$|E
