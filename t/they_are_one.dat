5|$|Narcissi are now {{popular as}} {{ornamental}} plants for gardens, parks and as cut flowers, providing colour {{from the end}} of winter to the beginning of summer in temperate regions. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>one</b> of the most popular spring flowers and one of the major ornamental spring flowering bulb crops, being produced both for their bulbs and cut flowers, though cultivation of private and public spaces is greater than the area of commercial production. Over a century of breeding has resulted in thousands of varieties and cultivars being available from both general and specialist suppliers. They are normally sold as dry bulbs to be planted in late summer and autumn. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>one</b> of the most economically important ornamental plants. Plant breeders have developed some daffodils with double, triple, or ambiguously multiple rows and layers of segments.
