30|$|Moreover, in the {{commercial}} pneumatic <b>tube</b> <b>conveyor</b> combined with a parts feedersystem, parts are supplied via the pushing force of a parts feeder system. However, as mentioned, Au grains must be aligned before the treatment, and cannot be supplied by the pushing force of a part feeder system during the treatment. Therefore, a special pneumatic <b>tube</b> <b>conveyor</b> needs to be designed to shoot Au grains. The shooting subdevice that we developed satisfies the requirement for shooting Au grains.|$|E
30|$|Pneumatic tube {{conveyors}} that shoot parts {{supplied by}} parts feeder systems are slso commercially available [13]. However, {{they are designed}} to shoot specific parts, e.g., bolts or nuts. Air leak in a pneumatic <b>tube</b> <b>conveyor</b> may be negligible for sufficiently heavy parts such as bolts and nuts. Au grains are small and lightweight, and an air leak can blow away subsequent grains in the buffer.|$|E
30|$|Therefore, Au grains {{need to be}} aligned {{and saved}} in a buffer prior to the {{treatment}} even if such commercial parts feeder systems are used. A supplying device that sends the aligned Au grains in the buffer into a pneumatic <b>tube</b> <b>conveyor</b> one by one is necessary during the treatment. The pushing subdevice and the setting subdevice that we developed serve as a supplying device, and therefore, they are essential.|$|E

It was a spiral-shaped, flat-roofed house in glass and concrete, incorporating a private garage, a boathouse and a helicopter pad. Other striking features were windows that rolled down like car windows, a <b>conveyor</b> <b>tube</b> for the mail and a kitchen stocked with ready-made meals. A Dodge Cabriolet Coupé was parked in the garage, there was a Chris Craft in the boathouse and an Autogyro on the roof. Jacobsen immediately became recognised as an ultra-modern architect.|$|R
50|$|Inventories in Space Engineers {{are very}} {{flexible}} {{and work in}} a whole-ship manner rather than in an individual one. All inventories connected to a ship can be viewed from any access panel on the same ship, however inventories must be connected via <b>conveyors</b> and <b>conveyor</b> <b>tubes</b> in order for items to be transferred among them. Inventories of refineries and arc furnaces will automatically request items to refine from connected inventories when they get low, and will send items into an available inventory when it fills up. The conveyor sorter allows inventories to be automatically removed and sorted from and into certain inventories. Instead of a common slot system, Space Engineers uses a volumetric system, measured in litres, with every item having {{a certain amount of}} volume and every inventory a certain capacity that it cannot exceed.|$|R
5000|$|Flemming Lassen {{was born}} on 23 February 1902 in Copenhagen into an artistic family.

40|$|Due {{to modern}} technology, screw blades are often {{manufactured}} by rolling {{them out of}} one single strip of steel. When simultaneously some blade inclination is applied, less residual stresses and/or larger possible ratios between outer and shaft diameter are claimed by some manufacturers, which seems plausible. However, it is sometimes also claimed that {{the efficiency of the}} conveyors is increased by such an inclined blade. The underlying idea is that the blade will cause extra pressure between the material to be conveyed and the <b>tube</b> of the <b>conveyor.</b> This in turn would delay the angular speed of the material, thus resulting in a steeper upward motion. In order to investigate this phenomenon, previous investigations based upon the conveyance of a single point mass have been modified for an inclined screw blade. It appeared that such a blade has no significant advantages over a normal one, which was confirmed by a series of tests. For completeness, tests were also carried out with a leading screw, resulting in worse results. In the case that the pitch equals the diameter and for friction coefficients of 0. 3 at both screw blade and tube wall, an increase of no more than 5...|$|R
40|$|A logical {{sequence}} {{for evaluating the}} mechanical properties of N-Reactor pressure tubing in the as-received condition is similar to evaluation after reactor service. The usual difficulties associated with testing a heavy tube to failure with 300 C water are compounded after reactor service by the high gamma radioactivity of the discharged tubes. Success in testing of discharged reactor pressure tubing in a pilot underwater facility led {{to the construction of}} an Irradiated Tube Testing ·Facility (ITTF) adjacent to the Radiometallurgy Building. The ITTF consists of a 10. ft 6 in. deep, water-filled basin 15 ft long by 10 ft wide, with six test chambers placed within the basin. These chambers are stainless steel bell jars that enclose the specimen, blast shielding, and electric furnace. The vessels exclude water from the hot specimen and furnace during testing and contain the pressure surge that occurs when the hot pressurized water flashes to steam upon failure of the test specimen. The ITTF basin is connected to the Radiometallurgy Building Basin by an underwater <b>tube</b> containing a <b>conveyor</b> system. The conveyor makes it possible to transfer highly radioactive materiais with ease and safety. Remote handling tools were developed to measure the tubes, attach end closures, attach thermocouples, and load lhe specimen within the furnace containment vessels...|$|R
40|$|The {{handling}} of pigments and powders in paint manufacturing cause emissions of airborne particles. A {{great variety of}} substances occur. Previous studies (Bohgard et al., 1994) of simulations of pouring of pigments, which occur in small scale weighing procedures, showed typically bimodal size distribution including a sub-micron and a super-micron mode. The objective {{of the study was}} to get detailed knowledge on the relation between different source processes (depending on production technology, equipment and the manual handling routines) and aerosol characteristics. Super-micron particles were continuously measured with a time-of-flight instrument (Aerodynamic Particle Sizer, APS TSI Inc.) and sub-micron particles with an electric mobility spectrometer (Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer, SMPS TSI Inc.). In addition filter sampling techniques for standardised work-place sampling (so-called total dust filter cassettes, a cyclone sampler for respirable dust and IOM-samplers for inhalable dust) have been used for idealised exposure/area measurements using a rotating mannequin as a carrier of these samplers. The filters were analysed gravimetrically and with Particle Induced X-ray Emission Analysis. The aerosols were measured during manufacturing of batches of paint. Sources and source mechanisms, as pouring pigments from bags, disposal of packages, mixing of powders and pigments and suspected re-suspension sources, were documented simultaneously with the performance of the measurements. Figure 1 shows examples of size distributions obtained with the APS and SMPS. The size distributions have essentially bimodal shapes with median diameters of 0. 05 - 0. 4 [mu]m and of 2 - 5 [mu]m respectively. Rapid variation in concentration occurs. Preliminary results show that several sources occur. Irregular activities and events as disposal of package material, cleaning, leakage from <b>conveyor</b> <b>tubes</b> and re-suspension due to wind velocities from open gates and moving vehicles significantly contribute to the particle concentrations. Filter sampling with the samplers mounted on a mannequin torso, rotating 360 degrees forth and back, is advantageous by giving idealised measures on exposure. Samplers mounted on equal horizontal level will have equal sampling location integrated over time. Furthermore, the sampling procedure emulate sampling in accordance with sampling conventions. Inlet characteristics of samplers mounted on a body differ from characteristics of free-hanging samplers (Vincent, 1989). Higher estimated mass concentrations were obtained with the IOM-samplers for inhalable dust than with the 37 mm open-face [ldquo]total dust[rdquo] cassettes. Figure omitte...|$|R
