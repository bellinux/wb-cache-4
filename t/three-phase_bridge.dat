25|$|If the <b>three-phase</b> <b>bridge</b> {{rectifier}} {{is operated}} symmetrically (as {{positive and negative}} supply voltage), the center point of the rectifier on the output side (or the so-called isolated reference potential) opposite the center point of the transformer (or the neutral conductor) has a potential difference in form of a triangular common-mode voltage. For this reason, the two centers must never be connected to each other, otherwise short-circuit currents would flow. The ground of the <b>three-phase</b> <b>bridge</b> rectifier in symmetrical operation is thus decoupled from the neutral conductor or the earth of the mains voltage.

40|$|Abstract—A {{bi-directional}} multi-port converter {{can accommodate}} various energy storages and sources. Therefore, a multiport converter {{will be a}} good candidate for application as a future universal converter for (hybrid) electrical vehicles or local distribution systems. The main design challenge of the multiport converter analyzed in this paper is the design of its three-phase symmetrical transformer. In this converter symmetry of the leakage inductances is essential to ensure balanced three-phase currents (transferred power). These currents are interconnected by <b>three-phase</b> <b>bridges</b> which are linked together by a three-phase, three-port, transformer. To realize the equality of the leakage inductances a specific transformer design is necessary. Since conventionally wound three-phase transformer core shapes suitable for high-frequency are expensive and difficult to build, a coaxial wound transformer will be designed in this paper.
