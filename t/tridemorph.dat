5000|$|The exact {{cause of}} the {{widespread}} illnesses is still disputed. Initial investigations by Ashfield District Council looked {{into a variety of}} possible causes, including contaminated water supplies, food poisoning, radio waves, and crop spraying of the nearby fields. The use of pesticides became the favoured explanation, with a 2003 episode of the BBC news and current affairs programme Inside Out revealing the local use of the pesticide <b>tridemorph.</b> Banned by the British government in 2000, <b>tridemorph</b> was discovered to be a harmful substance described by the World Health Organization (WHO) as [...] "moderately hazardous". However, these investigations took place over 20 years after the event and disagree with the official findings. The official inquiry did reveal the use of Calixin, a pesticide that contains <b>tridemorph,</b> but it was not considered to be dangerous at the time.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tridemorph</b> is a {{fungicide}} used {{to control}} Erysiphe graminis. It was developed by BASF in the 1960s who use the trade name Calixin. The World Health Organization has categorised it as a Class II [...] "moderately hazardous" [...] pesticide because it is believed harmful if swallowed and can cause irritation to skin and eyes.|$|E
50|$|The 1992 Ecuadorian TS {{epidemic}} occurred concurrently with {{an outbreak}} of black leaf wilt disease in banana plantations.The outbreak of black leaf disease led {{to an increase in}} fungicide usage within the Taura River basin district near the city of Guayaquil. The fungicides propiconazole (Tilt, Ciba-Geigy) and <b>tridemorph</b> (Calixin, BASF) used to control black leaf, ran off into nearby ponds and were initially thought to be responsible for the disease. Analytical data demonstrated propiconazole in water, sediments and hepatopancreas tissues of shrimp harvested from affected farms in Ecuador. No other pesticides were discovered.|$|E
5000|$|In addition, {{multiple}} fungicides {{have been}} seen to reduce Banana Freckle disease. In Hawaii, spraying the leaves and fruit with maneb (1 lb./100 gal water plus 4 oz of sticker-spreader) every 2 weeks or once a month throughout the year has remarkably reduced the spread of inoculum. In Taiwan, spraying fungicides, such as phaltan, orthocide, chlorothalonil, dithiocarbamates, and propiconazole, biweekly have produced effective results against the disease. In the Philippines, chemical controls used against Black or Yellow Sigatoka disease have been helpful. These consist of mancozeb, triazoles, <b>tridemorph,</b> and strobilurin. Mancozeb {{seems to be the}} most effective fungicide against Banana Freckle disease in Hawaii and the Philippines [...] These fungicides do not eliminate the pathogen completely, but they reduce the inoculum levels and eventually reduce yield loss.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT- <b>Tridemorph</b> is a {{systemic}} morpholine fungicide for crops. The {{objective of this}} study was to develop reliable and sensitive analytical method for determination of <b>tridemorph</b> residues in tea samples for ensuring the food safety. <b>Tridemorph</b> residues in samples were extracted with acetonitrile after hydration, partitioned with saline water, and then purified using an aminopropyl (NH 2) SPE cartridge. The purified samples were detected and quantified using LC-ESI-MS/MS. The linear detection limits for <b>tridemorph</b> ranged from 0. 02 to 1. 0 mg L− 1 with a correlation coefficient of 0. 9999. The method was validated using tea samples spiked with <b>tridemorph</b> at different con-centration levels (0. 02 and 0. 05 µg mL− 1). The average recovery ranged between 75. 0 and 84. 7 % with relative standard deviations less than 10 %. The LOD and LOQ were 0. 01 and 0. 02 mg L− 1, respectively. The developed method was applied successfully to the identification of <b>tridemorph</b> in real tea samples obtained from different sources, and tride-morph was not detected in any of the samples. The results show that the developed analytical method is accurate and suitable for <b>tridemorph</b> determination in tea samples.

40|$|<b>Tridemorph</b> (2, 6 -dimethyl-N-tridecylmorpholine) {{was active}} against {{representative}} {{of nearly all}} taxonomic groups of fungi; gram-positive bacteria were also sensitive although gram-negative were not. <b>Tridemorph,</b> 3 – 10 μg/ml, inhibited the multiplication of sporidia of Ustilago maydis more strongly than the increase of dry weight. The treated sporidia appeared swollen, multicellular, and sometimes branched. Unsaturated lipophilic compounds like α-tocopherol and trilinolein alleviated the toxicity of <b>tridemorph</b> to Botrytis allii and U. maydis. Protein and RNA syntheses were inhibited slightly. DNA synthesis was rather strongly affected already after 2 hr. Lipid synthesis was first inhibited but later stimulated. At an early stage (2 hr) treated cells differed already from control cells by a higher content of free fatty acids. <b>Tridemorph</b> also inhibited sterol biosynthesis. The antimicrobial spectrum, the characteristic morphology of treated cells of U. maydis, the observations on cross-resistance, the alleviating effect of unsaturated lipophilic compounds, and the alterations in neutral lipid pattern suggest strong similarity of the mode of action of <b>tridemorph</b> {{with that of the}} known inhibitors of sterol biosynthesis...|$|E

40|$|The halotolerant alga Dunaliella {{responds}} to hyperosmotic stress by synthesis of {{massive amounts of}} glycerol. The trigger for this osmotic response is the change in cell volume, but the mechanism that senses volume changes is not known. Preincubation of Dunaliella salina with <b>tridemorph,</b> a specific inhibitor of sterol biosynthesis, inhibits glycerol synthesis and volume recovery. The inhibition is associated with suppression of [14 C]bicarbonate incorporation into sterols and is correlated with pronounced depletion of plasma membrane sterols. Incubation of sterol-depleted cells with cholesterol hemisuccinate restores the capacity for volume regulation in response to hyperosmotic stress. <b>Tridemorph</b> as well as lovastatin also inhibit volume changes that are induced by high light in Dunaliella bardawil, a species that {{responds to}} high light intensity by synthesis of large amounts of [beta]-carotene.

Fungicide effects on diseases, green leaf area and breadmaking quality of cv. Avalon were studied. Additionally, three of the field experiments investigated grain filling, drying, and nitrogen accumulation, and two of these experiments tested fungicide effects over different cultivars. When averaged over all cultivars, the fungicide significantly (p < 0. 05) increased grain yield and thousand-grain weight (TGW) in five, and specific weight in three field experiments. Grain crude protein concentration (CP) and Hagberg falling number (HFN) were significantly reduced once following Septoria tritici control, and HFN alone was reduced a second time following powdery mildew (Erysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici) control.

Toxic sterol precursors, such as 8 -dehydrosterols, {{are present}} {{in a wide range}} of biologically {{relevant}} situations, from human rare diseases such as Conradi-Hünnermann-Happle Syndrome to amine fungicide-treated fungi and crops. However, the molecular and cellular bases of their toxicity are still obscure. Here we show that 8 -dehydrosterols affect vacuole acidification producing Vma [...] like phenotypes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Upon expression of a gene construct of the proton-pumping membrane-embedded pyrophosphatase AVP 1 from the plant Arabidopsis thaliana as an alternative proton pump, erg 2 -derived strains revert their Vma [...] like phenotypes and wild-type cells can proliferate in the presence of lethal concentrations of <b>tridemorph.</b> Also, endo- and exocytotic defects in erg 2 mutants are alleviated by the presence of a plant H+-pyrophosphatase. Despite their effect on endo/exocytic traffic, 8 -dehydrosterols do not induce endoplasmic reticulum stress or assembly defects on the V-ATPase. On the contrary, they exert their influence directly at the vacuole level by inducing PEP 4 -dependent proteolytic degradation of V 0 components, like a subunit Vph 1 p. These results can help to understand the etiology of sterol-related diseases, the fungicidal effect of amine compounds and the tolerance to this type of compounds observed in certain field fungi isolates and, in general, in plants.

40|$|The {{rise in the}} {{frequency}} of fungal infections and the increased resistance noted to the widely employed azole antifungals make the development of new antifungals imperative for human health. The sterol biosynthetic pathway has been exploited for the development of several antifungal agents (allylamines, morpholines, azoles), but additional potential sites for antifungal agent development are yet to be fully investigated. The sterol methyltransferase gene (ERG 6) catalyzes a biosynthetic step not found in humans and has been shown to result in several compromised phenotypes, most notably markedly increased permeability, when disrupted in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Candida albicans ERG 6 gene was isolated by complementation of a S. cerevisiae erg 6 mutant by using a C. albicans genomic library. Sequencing of the Candida ERG 6 gene revealed high homology with the Saccharomyces version of ERG 6. The first copy of the Candida ERG 6 gene was disrupted by transforming with the URA 3 blaster system, and the second copy was disrupted by both URA 3 blaster transformation and mitotic recombination. The resulting erg 6 strains were shown to be hypersusceptible to a number of sterol synthesis and metabolic inhibitors, including terbinafine, <b>tridemorph,</b> fenpropiomorph, fluphenazine, cycloheximide, cerulenin, and brefeldin A. No increase in susceptibility to azoles was noted. Inhibitors of the ERG 6 gene product would make the cell increasingly susceptible to antifungal agents as well as to new agents which normally would be excluded and would allow for clinical treatment at lower dosages.

40|$|Resumen del póster presentado al 22 nd IUBMB & 37 th FEBS Congress, celebrado en Sevilla (España) del 4 al 9 de septiembre de 2012. Inhibitors of the sterol-D 8, D 7 -isomerase (ERG 2 gene in yeast) {{are widely}} used as {{fungicides}} and comprise a family known as amine fungicides. Recently, it has been proposed that V-ATPase inhibition is behind the fungicidal effect of the closely related azole fungicides. However, the cellular mode of action of amine fungicides is still debatable. Here we show that abnormal D 8 -unsaturated sterols inhibit proton transport by negatively affecting vacuolar H+-ATPase functionality in yeast. Accordingly, cells defective in ERG 2 show V-ATPase-like phenotypes such as sensitivity to alkaline pH or zinc. Plants typically show a double set of electrogenic proton pumps at their vacuoles and are resistant to these fungicides. Expression of an alternative proton pump, a chimaera of the plant vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase AVP 1, efficiently complements V-ATPase-like defects in erg 2 - mutants. <b>Tridemorph,</b> an Erg 2 p-specific fungicide, induces V-ATPase defects even at low concentrations. However, V-ATPase inhibition is {{not the cause of}} cell death since erg 2 - mutants can grow under standard conditions, while fungicide-treated wild-type cells die by apoptosis. A consequence of V-ATPase inhibition are defects in the process of autophagy akin to those found in V-ATPase mutants.

The study {{was carried out}} at three different sites with varying levels of strand-sensitivity to fungicides, Santa Clara (a wild strand), La Rita (a moderate resistance strand), and finally Palacios (a resistant strand); and two stages. First, the in vitro sensitivity of the three populations was analyzed by treating ascospores grown on culture media with different concentrations of fungicide (0. 001 - 0. 01 - 0. 1 - 1. 0 - 10 mg L- 1). A loss of sensivity was observed to propiconazole, difenconazole, <b>tridemorph,</b> fenpropimorph, spiroxamine, pyraclostrobin, boscalid, thiphanate-methyl and diethofencarb in La Rita and Palacios, a loss of sensitivity to epoxiconazole in La Rita only, and to pirymethanil in Palacios only, with respect to inhibition percentages in distinct doses of 0, 01 y 0, 1 mg L- 1 and CE 50.

We used a mini sprayer modified for CORBANA according to Calpouzos (1962) and an airbrush (Titan®, modelo BD- 132 ª), in a random design experiment with a 12 x 3 factorial arrangement (11 fungicides and mineral oil application), to apply 5 treatment repetitions on 5 test plants for a total of 185 experimental units. The incubation period (PI), amount of time to reach the first stage of infection (PE 4), the latency period (PL), the progression of infection severity and the efficacy of the fungicides were evaluated. PI was shorter in the wild strand in all cases, PE 4 was longest in the resistant strand, and PL was similar between the wild and resistant strands. The progression of infection severity was very accelerated in the wild and moderately resistant strands, and very slight in the resistant population, which took 24 days longer to reach 100 % necrosis in the experimental area on the test plants. This shows a loss of parasitic fitness in that population. In addition, we observed a decrease in the efficacy of the fungicides in the moderately resistant (LR) and resistant population strands (PAL), due to the xvii loss of effectiveness. These results are evidence of a serious resistance problem to the main systemic fungicides in populations of M. fijiensis that is both prevailing and increasing in the banana growing zone of the Caribbean region of Costa Rica...|$|E
