After a protracted development process involving U.S. enrichment company USEC acquiring and then relinquishing commercialization {{rights to the}} technology, GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy (GEH) signed a commercialization agreement with Silex Systems in 2006. GEH has since built a demonstration <b>test</b> <b>loop</b> and announced plans to build an initial commercial facility.

SILEX has been projected to be {{an order of magnitude}} more efficient than existing production techniques but again, the exact figure is classified. In August, 2011 Global Laser Enrichment, a subsidiary of GEH, applied to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a permit to build a commercial plant. In September 2012, the NRC issued a license for GEH to build and operate a commercial SILEX enrichment plant, although the company had not yet decided whether the project would be profitable enough to begin construction, and despite concerns that the technology could contribute to nuclear proliferation.|$|E

40|$|Conducted {{immunity}} tests are always {{performed by the}} use of CDNs in laboratories in accordance with the standard EN 61000 - 4 - 6. However, it is not always possible to use CDNs because of some limitations. If the EUT (Equipment Under Test) has large dimensions or high currents, it is not, most of the time, possible to send it to an EMC laboratory or to use CDNs during the test. As a consequence, usage of BCI probes is inevitable in industry. In this paper, we compared the laboratory setup installed with CDNs and alternative setups installed directly on mains without any CDNs in terms of loop impedances and injected loop currents. We also established a link based on the loop impedances and the injected currents on the <b>test</b> <b>loops</b> between the two setups.

40|$|Culture supernatants {{from two}} strains of E. coli were placed into {{different}} ligated intestinal sections (loops) of each animal. The two bacterial strains were identical except that one contained a plasmid carrying the heat-stable enterotoxin b (STb) gene, {{while the other}} did not. Morphometric techniques {{were used to assess}} villous epithelial surface areas and mucosal volumes in both intestinal segments exposed to STb-positive (test) and to STb-negative (control) supernates. In pigs whose intestines were exposed to STb-positive supernatants for 2 hours, both villous epithelial surface area and mucosal volume were significantly smaller in <b>test</b> <b>loops</b> than in control loops (P 3 ̆c 0. 02). In pig <b>test</b> <b>loops</b> incubated for 1 hour and in lamb <b>test</b> <b>loops</b> incubated for 2 hours, villous epithelial surface area decreased although not significantly (0. 05 3 ̆c P 3 ̆c 0. 10). Rabbit <b>test</b> <b>loops</b> did not differ from rabbit control loops in either villous epithelial surface area or mucosal volume. Histological examination of the tissues from all three species revealed epithelial changes in pig and lamb tissues only. Intestinal tissues from pigs were examined by transmission electron microscopy, but no difference between test and control tissues was seen. We conclude that STb is capable of causing partial villous atrophy in young pigs after only 2 hours;In intact neonatal piglets, three strains of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) attracted greater numbers of neutrophils into the lumen and wall of the intestine than did a nonenteropathogenic strain of E. coli. Ligated loops of small intestine in 8 -week-old pigs were used in attempts to identify the attributes of ETEC involved in stimulating an increased enteroluminal migration of neutrophils. The three positive strains all produced enterotoxin STb. Neither of the negative ETEC strains produced STb. An STb-containing culture supernatant prepared from a strain of E. coli which contained an STb plasmid did not attract significantly more neutrophils than did a control supernatant prepared from the same strain of E. coli without the plasmid. It was concluded that there are increased numbers of neutrophils in the intestinal lumen during ETEC infection of newborn pigs. However, attempts to identify the attribute(s) of ETEC responsible for eliciting enteroluminal neutrophils were not successful...|$|R

40|$|Information {{technology}} {{can enhance the}} effectiveness of the part of the laboratory <b>testing</b> <b>loop</b> that occurs outside of the clinical laboratory.

Improvements made in the clinician-computer interface can conceivably enhance the quality of information transfer of this part of the <b>testing</b> <b>loop</b> and thereby improve {{the effectiveness of the}} entire loop. Our experience has been that results presentation is easier to address than order reception and that the economic benefits from improved result presentation can be substantial. Improving order reception requires more finesse, especially with the limitations of today's health systems and their information systems in mind. For instance, effective computer-based management of prospectively developed orders (eg, clinical protocols) not only can have a substantial positive impact on test use, but is actually welcomed by clinicians. Application of information technology at the clinician-computer interface has good potential to foster more appropriate use of clinical laboratory resources. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Most {{hardware}} compilers apply loop pipelining {{to increase}} the parallelism achieved, but pipelining is restricted to the only innermost level in a nested loop. In this work we extend and adapt an existing outer loop pipelining approach known as Single Dimension Software Pipelining to generate schedules for FPGA hardware coprocessors. Each loop level in nine <b>test</b> <b>loops</b> is pipelined and the resulting schedules are implemented in VHDL and targeted to an Altera Stratix II FPGA. The {{results show that the}} fastest solution for {{all but one of the}} loops occurs when pipelining is applied one to three levels above the innermost loop. Across the nine <b>test</b> <b>loops</b> we achieve an acceleration over the innermost loop solution of up to 7 times, with a mean speedup of 3. 2 times. The results suggest that inclusion of outer loop pipelining in future hardware compilers may be worthwhile as it can allow significantly improved results to be achieved at the cost of a small increase in compile time.

50|$|The main {{goals for}} Sub Project 2 are {{to select the}} best {{candidate}} alloys for the HP and ID steam turbines operating at high steam temperatures (≥720˚C). A number of nickel-base alloys have been developed whose properties have been proven at the laboratory scale and for small-scale components.

40|$|Digital {{subscriber}} line (DSL) {{is considered}} as an attractive approach to transmit high-speed data {{due to its}} advantage {{in the provision of}} affordable broadband services {{in a wide range of}} end users without massive capital outlays. Very-high-speed DSL (VDSL) is the latest generation of the xDSL family. It is a promising internet access technique for broadband services, which is capable of supporting high-definition television (HDTV), Voice over IP, and general Internet access over a single twisted pair of wires. In order to overcome the harsh VDSL transmission environment and to realize a reliable high-speed data transmission, equalization technique is required at the receiver to compensate for the channel attenuation and distortion. In this thesis, we focus on the design and performance study of VDSL systems using the per-tone equalization (PTEQ). Some background material pertaining to VDSL systems and equalization techniques is first presented. The per-tone equalization technique is then investigated. Based on a two-port model of the subscriber loop, namely, the so-called ABCD theory, the transfer function of various VDSL <b>test</b> <b>loops</b> are well formulated and simulated. A practical VDSL system with configurations following the standard as well as the PTEQ in the receiver is designed and simulated. Performance study is conducted over several VDSL <b>test</b> <b>loops</b> with various channel conditions, showing a great improvement on the SNR of the received signal and the overall transmission bit-rate of the VDSL system as a result of employing the PTEQ.
