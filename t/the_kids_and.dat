Wolverine founded the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning, spending all the fortune that he had amassed over the years upon it.

Wolverine made it clear that he didn't want to lose any of <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>and</b> fought as hard as he could against the Frankenstein Monsters whom Iceman defeated by making Ice clones of himself.

[...] Cloke described her part as [...] "strong and sassy – in control. After the crash she comes unglued, probably more than any of <b>the</b> <b>kids,</b> <b>and</b> it's a quick, drastic change.

[...] He also praised the episode's guest voice actors, citing in particular Bill Hader's character Mickey as [...] "very odd, but so much fun"; Bonaime gave [...] "Bob Fires the Kids" [...] an overall grade of 8.3 out of 10. Jen Johnson, writing for Den of Geek, also cited Mickey as a highlight of the episode, stating: [...] "I would say that I hope {{this is the end}} of Mickey and the chaos he brings to the Belcher family, but [...] was just too much fun.

500|$|Roy Hrab of DVD Verdict was {{positive}} on the season, but wrote [...] "I {{do not think}} that adults will be as entertained as in previous seasons.

[...] In conclusion, he said [...] "there's nothing new here and adults will be disappointed, but the latest installment of SpongeBob SquarePants delivers a lot of silly and good-natured fun for <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>and</b> there's nothing wrong with that." [...] In the Volume 2 review also for the DVD Verdict, Dennis Prince said [...] " [...] is not the series' best work but, nevertheless, is an improvement".

500|$|Although he {{had done}} {{research}} on pandemics six {{months prior to the}} 2009 flu pandemic, the outbreak was [...] "really helpful" [...] to his studies, because it provided a glimpse of the societal apparatus following the onset stages of a pandemic.
