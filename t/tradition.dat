5|$|Still {{friends with}} Martello, Buczynski {{initiated}} him up till the third degree of the Welsh Traditionalist <b>tradition,</b> in return receiving third degree initiation into the Strega <b>tradition.</b> At the same time, {{he was facing}} problems within his own <b>tradition</b> as one couple running their own Welsh outer coven, Claudia and Gerard Nero, had decided to abandon Buczynski's <b>tradition</b> and receive initiation into Gardnerianism from the Kneitals; they had ultimately decided to do so after becoming increasingly sceptical of his historical claims to Palaeolithic roots. They took their initiates, including Margot Adler, with them, much to Buczynski and Slater's annoyance, leading to {{a breakdown of the}} friendship that they had had with the Kneitals. His <b>tradition</b> nevertheless continued to grow and spread, and in January 1973, the <b>tradition</b> joined the Council of Earth Religions (COER), a pan-Pagan umbrella organisation founded the previous year to work for the common defence of the movement. His primary inner coven grew to a size that it had to divide into two at Midsummer 1973. His high priestess, Kay Smith, decided to take lead of one of them, while Eddie remained in the other, being joined by a new ritual consort named Judith. By August, there were two outer court covens of the Welsh <b>tradition</b> in New York City, and one each in Philadelphia and in Hopewell, Virginia.|$|E

They also drew upon the pre-Reformation British theological <b>tradition,</b> which emphasized biblical knowledge and was influenced by the Augustinian theological <b>tradition</b> exemplified by Anselm, Thomas Bradwardine, and John Wycliffe. The recorded debates of the Assembly are full of citations of church fathers and medieval scholastic theologians.|$|E

5|$|According to {{historian}} Paolo Delogu {{it may be}} that Agnellus' narrative better reflects Lombard oral <b>tradition</b> than Paul's. In his interpretation, Paul's narrative {{represents a}} late distortion of the Germanic myths and rituals contained in the oral <b>tradition.</b> In a telling consistent with Germanic <b>tradition,</b> it would be Helmichis who was seduced by the queen, and by sleeping with him Rosamund would pass Alboin's royal charisma magically to the king's prospective murderer. A symbol of this passage of powers is found in Paul's account of the assassin's entry: Alboin's inability to draw his sword represents here his loss of power.|$|E
