40|$|It is {{well known}} that the welding process induces {{residual}} stresses near the <b>bead</b> <b>toe.</b> These stresses could influence the high cycle fatigue strength of welding joints therefore {{it is very important to}} know their distribution. Among the local criteria, the Notch-Stress Intensity Factors (N-SIFs) method considers the weld toe like a sharp V- notch and estimates the fatigue strength according to the asymptotic stress distribution near the <b>bead</b> <b>toe.</b> Such distribution is evaluated taking into account only the external applied loads [1]. It is obvious that the residual stresses change such distribution and the size of the plastic zone near the weld toe, modifying the range of validity of a linear- elastic hypothesis. The aim of this work is to analyse, by means of a numerical model of a T-joint, the residual stress distribution near the toe due to a welding process. The 2002 ®...|$|R

5000|$|Trials bike rims are {{significantly}} wider than those used for cross country, downhill and BMX bikes. Wider rims mean that any given tyre fitted {{to the rim}} will hold a bigger volume of air thanks to the <b>tyre</b> <b>beads</b> being held further apart by the rim. This means the tyre has a wider contact patch and therefore can be run at lower tyre pressure. The change in volume of a tyre on a wide rim when landed on a sharp corner will tend to be {{greater than that of}} a narrow rim, which again leads to improved pinch puncture resistance, critical for trials as landing on sharp edges is a very common requirement of both competition and street trials. A wider rim also makes it much harder for a tyre to roll off the rim when exposed to side loads, again a very common occurrence in trials riding.|$|R

Steel coupons were coated with varying compositions of Cu-Sn via immersion coating, where the electrolyte bath composition was varied. Chemical analysis of the coatings using ICP-OES confirmed increase in Sn content with increasing SnSO 4 concentration in the coating baths, keeping other parameters constant. No change in the coating weight was observed with change in Sn concentration in the coatings. Bare spots on the coating surface was observed under SEM XPS analysis confirmed formation of Fe oxide at the bare locations. The coated steel plates were vulcanized with SBR based rubber and peel strength was measured. The results confirmed an optimum Sn concentration of 3 - 4 wt % in the coatings up to which an increase (~ 25 %) in adhesion strength was exhibited compared to only Cu coatings.

40|$|AbstractAn iron {{base alloy}} {{containing}} 10 wt. % Cr and 10 wt. %Ni with a martensite start temperature around 180 °C {{has been developed}} by Ohta et al. Numerous {{studies have shown that}} Low γ→α’ Transformation Temperature (LTT) welding consumables enable weld beads to be in compression after cooling. Owing to this, fatigue strength can be substantially improved. Low carbon martensitic stainless steel consumables (EN ISO 17633 -A -T Z 16 5 1) are widely available on the market in Europe, which also exhibit γ→α’ low temperature transformation (around 225 °C), despite dilution with base material. Experimental work conducted on partially penetrated symmetric and asymmetric fillet welded test pieces have shown good results with respect to weld root crack initiation and a substantial improvement of fatigue resistance with respect to weld <b>bead</b> <b>toe</b> crack initiation (m = - 5, FAT > 160). These results are all the more interesting because the weld bead connecting radius obtained with a heterogeneous welding consumable is smaller than with a homogeneous consumable such as G 3 Si 1. This study shows that using a LTT –type consumable with designation G 16 5 1 is an interesting alternative to more conventional techniques such as TIG re-melting or high frequency mechanical impact to improve fatigue strength of welded structures...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRecently boron microalloyed steels {{have become}} an {{alternative}} in weight saving in structural elements in automotive industry, especially for parts like pillars and columns and reinforcements. These materials are used as quenched and tempered, reaching strength values between 1000 and 1500 MPa. Welding is a relevant issue as a fabrication process in automotive industry, in particular for high strength steels.

Throughout the study, the COD removal was over 80 %, of which a significant fraction was contributed by the attached growth. In general, the specific bioactivity (expressed as mg O 2 uptake per g sludge-hour) of the attached biomass was somewhat {{higher than that of}} the suspended growth at a given substrate concentration.

40|$|Two bench-scale hybrid systems, {{employing}} <b>tyre</b> <b>beads</b> and Kaldnes {{elements as}} carriers, respectively, {{were used in}} this research. The aim was to evaluate the dynamic changes of carbonaceous and nitrifying bioactivities in suspended and attached growth under different operating conditions such as SRT, carrier concentrations and loading rates. The distinct advantage of hybrid systems in achieving nitrification at short SRT operation was demonstrated in the comparison with an activated sludge system. With the operating SRT of suspended growth varying from 0. 17 d to 7. 1 d, the two hybrid systems gradually changed from a biofilm-dominant to a suspended-growth-dominant system. At the fixed loading rates of 4. 2 kg COD/m 3 -d and 0. 78 kg TKN/m 3 -d, the relative contribution of attached growth towards the overall organic removal was reduced from 50 % at 0. 17 -d SRT to 5 % at 7. 1 -d SRT and its corresponding contribution to nitrification was reduced from 95 % to 15 %. For both growth types, with the increasing SRT, carbonaceous activities decreased due to the limiting substrate while nitrifying activities increased because of the accumulation of nitrifiers. It {{was found that the}} attached growth always showed a higher nitrifying activity but a lower carbonaceous activity as compared to the suspended growth. The long SRT of the biofilm favored the nitrifying growth at the short operating SRT, which enabled the hybrid systems to achieve a remarkable nitrification rate of 0. 45 - 0. 6 kg TKN/m 3 -d at a short SRT of 1 to 2 days. This rate was about 3 to 8 times as high as that of the activated sludge system. In addition, the suspended growth in the hybrid systems also showed a considerable nitrification rate of 0. 2 to 0. 4 kg TKN/m 3 d at short SRT operation because of the continuous input of nitrifiers from the biofilm detachment. Moreover, the suspended growth was found to shoulder 80 to 90 % of total organic loading when the SRT was 1 to 2 d. This greatly relieved the organic burden on attached growth and exempted it from the negative influence of increased organic loading rate. With this kind of cooperation between suspended and attached growth, the hybrid system was able to achieve a higher nitrification rate at a fixed organic loading rate, as compared to an activated sludge system. As biofilm became dominant at short SRT operation, the hybrid system encountered a severe oxygen deficiency in biofilm at a high organic loading rate, which greatly limited the system nitrification rate. Both the operating DO and the surface organic loading rate were found to have profound impacts on the nitrification rate of the biofilm. At the same loading rate (4. 2 kg COD/m 3 -d and 0. 78 kg TKN/m 3 -d), the surface organic loading was reduced by varying the carrier concentration from 10 to 30 g/L. This drastically boosted the system nitrification rate from 0. 01 kg TKN/m 3 -d to 0. 40 kg TKN/m 3 -d and also made the biofilm less sensitive to the changes of operating DO concentration and applied volumetric loading rate. As comparing the two carriers used in this study, it was found that Kaldnes elements were able to maintain a relatively constant attached biomass concentration under the varying surface organic loading rate due to its relatively closed structure. This feature would be favorable for treating a seasonally fluctuating loading. However, the closed structure of Kaldnes element also incurred a significant diffusion resistance. Therefore, more energy input was needed to overcome the diffusion resistance to increase the nitrification rate.

It is a fluffy powder of extreme fineness and high surface area, composed essentially of elemental carbon. Carbon black is one of thermo-stable product among the chemicals used in rubber compounding. Carbon black in general is the most widely used filler material in rubber industry. Carbon black is made from hydrocarbon fuel and therefore costly and has to be imported to Srilanka. Paddy husk is a natural source which can be converted to Carbon black and can be very cost effective. In an Agricultural country like Srilanka, paddy husk is abundantly available and also it would be uplifting to local industry as a readily available renewable raw material source. Carbon black particle size plays a major role with regard to cured rubber properties. It is directly related to strength of cured article. When a compound is used for tyre tread or plies, Carbon black particle size will be the most critical parameter. Carbon black particle size is not so critical when compounding in <b>tyre</b> <b>bead,</b> inner liner, and chafer compounds. When Carbon black is to be produced from paddy husk, first, it is under gone pyrolysis in inert atmospheric conditions and converted into carbonized paddy husks. Then, carbonized paddy husk is ground in a grinder and further fined by ball milling. Accordingly it can be made fine 200 nm level of particle size which is confirmed by Iodine adsorption number analysis. As per the tensile, hardness, rheological test results, it was decided to use Paddy Husk Carbon Black (PHCB) for the inner liner compound of tube type pneumatic bias ply tyre. Accordingly, differently proportionate compound samples were prepared by replacing the existing normal carbon black with PHCB. Seven compound batches were prepared and rheological and physical properties were analyzed. According to test results, it was found that 40 % of Normal carbon black could be replaced by PHCB for inner liner compound.

The finite element simulations basing on aircraft tyre test and operational scenarios could predict the loads transferred from tyre and the stresses distributed to the wheel rim. The virtual analysis could assess the safety criteria of different tyre structures, which would lead to the cost and time circle reduction in tyre R&D process. An H 41 x 16. 0 R 20 radial ply aircraft test tyre and its corresponding test wheel, provided by Dunlop Aircraft Tyres Limited, are adopted as the subject of this research. The material properties, especially the rubber and fabric materials, have been investigated. The finite element hyperelastic models have been utilized to represent rubbers and been correlated to experimental data. The 2 D and 3 D finite element tyre models, along with the finite element wheel models are created in the commercial finite element code, LS-Dyna.

Parameters such as <b>bead</b> shape and <b>toe</b> or root radius vary from joint to joint even in well-controlled manufacturing operations. The worst case configuration {{can be achieved by}} modelling as a sharp, zero radius, notch both the toe and the weld root. The intensity of asymptotic stress distributions obeying Williams' solution is quantified by means of the Notch Stress Intensity Factors (NSIFs). For steel welded joints with failures originated from the weld roots, where the lack of penetration zone is treated as a crack-like notch, units for NSIFs are the same as conventional SIFs used in LEFM. The different dimensionality of NSIFs for different notch opening angles does not allow a direct comparison of failures occurring at the weld toe or at the weld root. In order to overcome the problem related to the variability of the V-notch opening angle, a simple scalar quantity, i. e. the value of the strain energy density (SED) averaged in the structural volume surrounding the notch tip, has been introduced. This energy is given in closed form {{on the basis of the}} relevant NSIFs for modes I, II and III. The radius Rc of the averaging zone is carefully identified with reference to conventional arc welding processes being equal to 0. 28 mm for welded joints made of steel.

40|$|Robotic Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) {{is used in}} fatigue loaded {{structures}} where {{demands on}} weld quality are very high. Bead dimensions of a weld such as penetration <b>bead</b> thickness and <b>toe</b> radius can reveal whether a weld can reach high fatigue life. However, several welding parameters have high impact on these dimensions. From previous research it has been indicated that geometrical parameters such as torch angle, weld position, push or pull direction etc. are the most influential ones concerning quality of a weld with solid wires. Welding technology offers solid or metal cored wires for robotic GMAW. Even though metal cored wires depict several advantages compared to solid, a lot of skepticism is faced among industries due to its higher cost. Response parameters of a fillet weld by robotized GMAW using metal cored wire were investigated {{as a function of}} welding geometry parameters. The goal is to reveal the optimal settings aiming at as high productivity as possible. Iteration of welding tests using solid wire has been made in order to depict repeatability of previous test results with the same settings. Next step consisted of several series of experiments varying geometrical parameters using metal cored electrode. Repetition of this series for different values of wire feed rate has been carried out and comparisons are made. In order to reveal higher possible productivity, a few tests were carried out for the optimal welds from previous steps for different welding speeds and with pulsed welding. Specimens were cut, grinded and etched. Measurement of weld dimensions was performed via Lumenera software. Analysis of the results was made with JMP 11 software by SAS. Results indicated that for metal cored wire the majority of high quality welds were performed in push direction, PA position and gun angle of 35 o. Correlation analysis showed the nature of the relationships between input and output parameters. Prediction models were constructed for all weld dimensions using regression analysis. Tests with higher welding speeds suggest that there are possibilities for productivity improvement.

40|$|Weld bead {{geometry}} cannot, by its nature, be precisely defined. Parameters such as <b>bead</b> {{shape and}} <b>toe</b> radius vary from joint to joint even in well-controlled manufacturing operations. In {{the present paper}} the weld toe region is modelled as a sharp, zero radius, V-shaped notch {{and the intensity of}} asymptotic stress distributions obeying Williams' solution are quantified by means of the Notch Stress Intensity Factors (NSIFs). When the constancy of the angle included between weld flanks and main plates is assured and the angle is large enough to make mode II contribution non-singular, mode I NSIF can be directly used to summarise the fatigue strength of welded joints having very different geometry. By using a large amount of experimental data taken from the literature and related to a V-notch angle of 135 degrees, two NSIF-based bands are reported for steel and aluminium welded joints under a nominal load ratio about equal to zero. A third band is reported for steel welded joints with failures originated from the weld roots, where the lack of penetration zone is treated as a crack-like notch and units for NSIFs are the same as conventional SIF used in LEFM. Afterwards, in order to overcome the problem related to the variability of the V-notch opening angle, the synthesis is made by simply using a scalar quantity, i. e. the mean value of the strain energy averaged in the structural volume surrounding the notch tips. This energy is given in closed form {{on the basis of the}} relevant NSIFs for modes I and II and the radius R-c of the averaging zone is carefully identified with reference to conventional arc welding processes. Rc for welded joints made of steel and aluminium considered here is 0. 28 mm and 0. 12 mm, respectively Different values of Rc might characterise welded joints obtained from high-power processes, in particular from automated laser beam welding. The local-energy based criterion is applied to steel welded joints under prevailing mode I (with failures both at the weld root and toe) and to aluminium welded joints under mode I and mixed load modes (with mode II contribution prevailing on that ascribable to mode I).

40|$|This licentiate thesis {{focuses on}} the fatigue {{cracking}} behaviour of laser and hybrid laser-MAG welded structures. Beside the welding process and the resulting weld, several topics related to fatigue of welded structures are treated such as; macro and micro surface geometry, weld defects and their influence on fatigue performance of welded structures, fatigue analysis by the nominal and effective notch stress method, fatigue life prediction using LEFM (Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics), fatigue testing, metallurgical analysis, elastic and elastic-plastic finite element analysis. The main objective is to gain understanding {{of the impact of}} weld defects and weld shape details on the fatigue behaviour of laser and hybrid laser welded joints. The first paper is a literature survey which compiled useful information regarding fracture and fatigue analysis of various welded joints. In the second paper fatigue testing by bending of laser hybrid welded eccentric fillet joints was carried out. The weld surface geometry was measured and studied {{in order to understand the}} crack initiation mechanisms. The crack initiation location and the crack propagation path were studied and compared to Finite Element stress analysis, taking into account the surface macro- and micro-geometry. Based on the nominal stress approach, SN-curves were designed for laser hybrid welded eccentric fillet joints. The competing criteria of throat depth and stress raising by the weld toe radii and by the surface ripples are explained, showing that surface ripples can be critical. The third paper is the continuation of the second paper, but studying the fatigue crack propagation of laser hybrid welded eccentric fillet joints. Microscopic analysis was carried out to identify internal weld defects. Nominal and effective notch stress analysis was carried out to compare standardized values. LEFM analysis was conducted for this joint geometry for four point bending load in order to study the effect of LOF on fatigue life. In good agreement between simulation and metallurgy, cracking starts and propagates from the lower toe, but for certain geometries alternatively from the weld <b>bead</b> or upper <b>toe,</b> even in case of Lack of Fusion, as was well be explained. Improved understanding of the crack propagation for these geometrical conditions was obtained and in turn illustrated. Lack of fusion surprisingly was not critical and only slightly lowered the fatigue life. Two dimensional linear elastic finite element analyses is carried out in the fourth paper on laser welding of a beamer in order to study the impact of geometrical aspects of the joint design and of the weld root on the fatigue performance. Critical geometrical aspects were classified and then studied by FE-analysis with respect to their impact on the fatigue behaviour. Stress comparison of full 15 mm and partial 6 mm weld penetration of the beam was done by varying the toe and root geometry to identify the critical details. Generalization of the knowledge by new methods was an important aspect, particularly to apply the findings for other joints. Together the papers provide better understanding of fatigue behaviour for complex geometries and are therefore suitable guidelines for improved weld design.
