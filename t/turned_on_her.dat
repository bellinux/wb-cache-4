5|$|Kroonlands lifeboat, {{manned by}} a fresh crew, headed {{back out and}} {{returned}} with 13 steerage passengers. On board Volturno, the crew {{and some of the}} male passengers, unable to extinguish the fire, were at least able to keep it from spreading to the aft cargo holds, over which the others on board were gathered. Shortly before dawn, a large explosion—probably of her boilers—rocked Volturno, and the rescuers felt that the ship, which had not been in imminent danger of sinking up to this point, might founder at any time. The tanker Narragansett <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> pumps and sprayed lubricating oil on the sea to help calm the surface. The combined effect of the oil and the lessening of the storm allowed many more lifeboats to be sent to Volturnos aid. Kroonland launched two more boats herself and saved 75 more, including Captain Inch, the last person to leave the stricken ship. In all, some 520 passengers and crew were rescued by the ten ships—89 on Kroonland alone. The loss of life was limited to around 130, mostly women and children from the early lifeboat launchings.|$|E

25|$|In {{the final}} boardroom, Sir Alan {{did not feel}} that Adele was {{responsible}} for First Forte's loss, despite backing out on the presentation and showing signs she was unenthusiastic. Miriam, whom Lindsay brought back to help get Adele fired, soon found herself in the firing line when Sugar criticised her for being indecisive on the task and for having an unsuitable personality, while Lindsay <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> and backed up his criticism. However, he soon decided to let her stay when Miriam was spurred into defending herself, yet warned her to be more proactive in future tasks.|$|E
25|$|On 27 November 2013, Değirmendere {{was taken}} into a drydock of Alaybey Naval Dockyard in İzmir Province, western Turkey for {{maintenance}} and repair works. She capsized during the transfer to the water at 12:50 hours local time (10:50 UTC) on 23 December 2013 following the launching of a minesweeper, which {{was also in the}} same drydock for repairs. Within 20 seconds, Değirmendere <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> starboard in water as keel blocks broke, killing ten and injuring seventeen, who were on board to conduct and supervise the transfer action. One petty officer, seven enlisted of the Navy and two civilian dockyard workers were found dead in the compartments under water by navy divers.|$|E
25|$|On February 15, 1996, the Gunns vacated {{the title}} because Billy was {{in need of}} neck surgery. After Billy {{returned}} from hiatus, The Smoking Gunns won the Tag Team Title for the third time by defeating The Godwinns in May. After the match, The Godwinns' manager Sunny <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> team in favor of the Gunns. On September 22 at In Your House: Mind Games, the Gunns lost the Tag Team Title to Owen Hart and The British Bulldog. After the match, Sunny abandoned The Gunns, saying that she would only manage title holders. Billy, frustrated with losing both the championship and Sunny, walked out on Bart, breaking up The Smoking Gunns.|$|E

500|$|On the 31 August {{episode of}} Raw, {{all members of}} PCB competed in the first ever [...] "Divas Beat the Clock challenge", in which Charlotte was named the number one {{contender}} to Nikki Bella's Divas Championship, which she won at Night of Champions on 20 September, and the following night on Raw, Paige <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> partners during Charlotte's celebration and cut a worked shoot promo, where she claimed that Charlotte was only there because of her father Ric Flair, and called Lynch the [...] "least relevant" [...] member of Divas division. Throughout October, Paige tried to reconcile with Lynch and Charlotte only to attack them, officially disbanding Team PCB in the process. On the 2 November episode of Raw, Lynch failed to win a fatal four-way number one contender's match for Charlotte's Divas Championship, which Paige won after she pinned her. The following week on Raw, Lynch gained revenge over Paige and defeated her in a singles match.|$|E
500|$|In January, Candice {{appeared}} at New Year's Revolution {{in the first}} ever Bra and Panties Gauntlet match, where she was eliminated by Maria. On the February 13 episode of Raw, Michelle accompanied Torrie in a losing effort to Ashley. After winning a number one contender's Diva battle royal on Raw, Candice got her first singles WWE Women's Championship match, but lost to then-champion Trish Stratus on February 27. After the match, Candice slapped Wilson, blaming her, in storyline, for the loss. Vince's Devils later broke up when Torrie became a fan favorite after Candice and Victoria <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> during Candice's Playboy cover unveiling. This feud led to a match at WrestleMania 22 in which both Playboy cover girls competed in a Playboy Pillow Fight. Torrie Wilson won the match. On the June 12 episode of Raw, Candice was defeated by Torrie in the first ever [...] "Wet and Wild match", a wrestling match involving water balloons and squirt guns, in which {{the winner of the}} match would be {{on the cover of the}} WWE 2006 Summer Special magazine. The feud continued sporadically in backstage segments where Candice was depicted as Vince McMahon's [...] "sex slave". On the July 11 episode of ECW, the villainous Candice appeared as Kelly Kelly's dance partner on that night's Kelly's Exposé segment, and attempted to seduce Kelly in a backstage segment before their performance.|$|E

2500|$|The {{impact of}} Garbo's acting and screen {{presence}} quickly established her {{reputation as one}} of Hollywood's greatest actresses. Film historian and critic David Denby argues that Garbo introduced a subtlety of expression to the art of silent acting and that its effect on audiences cannot be exaggerated. She [...] "lowers her head to look calculating or flutters her lips," [...] he says. [...] "Her face darkens with a slight tightening around the eyes and mouth; she registers a passing idea with a contraction of her brows or a drooping of her lids. Worlds <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> movements." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rainier {{then had}} Amboyna escort a ship with a cargo of spices to China. Dobbie's mission was also to procure {{supplies}} for the British squadron in the Moluccas.

While Dobbie went up to Whampoa, he left Amboyna in the Typa (inner harbour) under the supervision of Lieutenant Arthur Farquhar, a friend who had traveled on her as a supernumerary. While she was being <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> side, a gang of [...] "ladrones" [...] (thieves) attempted to capture and loot her; fortunately Farquhar was able to drive them off.|$|E

At 11:27 local time on July 18, 1942 in {{position}} , southeast of Trinidad, German submarine [...] (Georg Lassen) launched four torpedoes and hit Carmona on the starboard side. [...] The first torpedo struck the engine room, and killed four crew members. The second hit at #2 hatch about 10 minutes later, {{and the other two}} struck shortly after. The ship <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> side and sunk at 12:00 noon. The Master ordered to abandon ship and the survivors were picked up by a United States Navy Patrol Boat [...] and taken to Port of Spain. There were 31 survivors.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the weeks}} before her execution, Wuornos gave a series of {{interviews}} to Broomfield. She depicts, [...] "being taken away to meet God and Jesus and the angels and whatever is beyond the beyond". In her final interview, she once again charged that her mind was [...] "tortured" [...] at BCI, and her head crushed by [...] "sonic pressure". Food poisonings and other abuses worsened, she said, each time she complained, with the goal of making her appear insane, or to drive her insane. She also <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> interviewer: [...] "You sabotaged my ass! Society, and the cops, and the system! A raped woman got executed, and was used for books and movies and shit!" [...] Her final on-camera words were [...] "Thanks a lot, society, for railroading my ass." [...] Dawn Botkins, a childhood friend of Wuornos, later told Broomfield that her verbal abuse was directed at society and the media in general, not at him specifically.|$|E
2500|$|A British {{squadron}} under Captain George Miller in [...] {{arrived at}} Deshaies on 12 December to reconnoiter the harbour. There {{they found the}} French navy's brig Nisus about to leave, having loaded a cargo of coffee. Miller sent in boats with the marines from [...] Thetis, Pultusk, , and , and 78 sailors.

Spruance. [...] On June 19, Japanese carrier aircraft began attacking the Fifth Fleet which remained close to the beachhead on orders from Spruance. [...] Wright concurred that this controversial decision was the correct one given the importance of protecting the landing force. During the ensuing Battle of the Philippine Sea, Santa Fe's anti-aircraft guns helped to protect the fleet during these enemy air attacks while American naval aviators counter-attacked the Japanese fleet. [...] Later, on June 20, Santa Fe ignored possible Japanese submarine activity when she <b>turned</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> lights to help guide returning American aircraft back to their carriers during highly hazardous night landings. [...] After air strikes on Pagan Island, Santa Fe returned to Eniwetok for reprovisioning.|$|E
