5|$|A {{resolution}} to this apparent inconsistency {{is offered by}} inflationary theory in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently {{on opposite sides of}} the observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then follows from the fact that <b>this</b> <b>larger</b> region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.|$|E
5|$|Although the Admiralty saw no use {{to which}} Halkett's designs could be put in general naval service, <b>this</b> <b>larger</b> design was {{extremely}} well received by explorers. John Franklin bought one {{to take on the}} ill-fated 1845 expedition in which the entire expedition party of 129men and two ships vanished. Franklin saw Halkett boats as so essential to travel in Canada that he gave the boat intended for his expedition to Sir George Simpson, Governor-in-Chief of Rupert's Land, for use in his travels in the region. He ordered a replacement boat from Halkett, who delivered it in time for him to take possession before setting out on his last expedition.|$|E
5|$|In 1745, Brettingham {{designed}} Gunton Hall in Norfolk for Sir William Harbord, {{three years}} after the former house on the site was gutted by fire. The new house of brick had a principal facade like that of Hanworth Hall, however, <b>this</b> <b>larger</b> house was seven bays deep, and had a large service wing on its western side. His commissions began to come from further afield: Goodwood in Sussex and Marble Hill, Twickenham.|$|E

5|$|The Kafka {{family had}} a servant girl living with them in a cramped apartment. Franz's room was often cold. In November 1913 the family moved into a bigger apartment, {{although}} Ellie and Valli had married and {{moved out of the}} first apartment. In early August 1914, just after World War I began, the sisters did not know where their husbands were in the military and moved back in with the family in <b>this</b> <b>larger</b> apartment. Both Ellie and Valli also had children. Franz at age 31 moved into Valli's former apartment, quiet by contrast, and lived by himself for the first time.|$|E
5|$|The Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero or Virgin Islands dwarf gecko (Sphaerodactylus parthenopion) is {{a species}} of gecko and {{also one of the}} {{smallest}} terrestrial vertebrates. It has only been found on three of the British Virgin Islands: Virgin Gorda, Tortola, and Moskito Island (also spelled “Mosquito Island”). It was discovered in 1964 and is suspected to be a close relative of Sphaerodactylus nicholsi, a dwarf sphaero from the nearby island of Puerto Rico. It shares its range with the big-scaled least gecko (S.macrolepis), which is found in leaf litter. Unlike <b>this</b> <b>larger</b> gecko, the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero lives on drier hillsides, yet prefers moist microhabitats found under rocks because it lacks the adaptations necessary for preventing water loss, which is a significant problem due to its small body size.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>larger</b> scale {{building}} activity, {{from the}} mid-8th century on, was {{a manifestation of}} the emergence of tribal organisms, a new civilizational quality that represented rather efficient proto-political organizations and social structures on a new level. They were based on these fortifications, defensive objects, of which the mid-8th century and later Vistulan gords in Lesser Poland are a good example. The threat coming from the Avar state in Pannonia could have had provided the original motivation for the construction projects.|$|E

5|$|The game's plot {{describes}} {{a journey through}} a child's emotions and anxieties. After befriending the monster, the boy leaves Earth on the creature's back to look for life elsewhere in the galaxy. He hopes {{to find someone to}} relate to. The hollow planet Gravida's surface is patrolled by a creature that complains of stomach pains. <b>This</b> <b>larger</b> creature is followed by several tiny creatures, some of which ride on its back. One of these smaller inhabitants has fallen into the core of Gravida. Though it is isolated and lonely, the creature consoles itself that nobody can harm it. The planet Malaisus is composed of water, with a monster identical to the player's swimming around with a shoal of fish. The monster tells the player to leave. Planet Bibulon has two faces on opposite sides, one angry and one happy. A two-faced creature travels across the surface; one is happy and the other morose. Bibulon is orbited by four moons, each of which has differing opinions on an unnamed man or boy. When players find the planet Debasa, they discover that it is surrounded by a green fog. Gravity is very intense within the fog. Four orbiting satellites produce the fog, which has trapped two boys. Earth shrinks slightly after each planet has been completed. After restoring color to all the surrounding planets, the game is completed by returning to Earth. The Earth has shrunk until it is only slightly larger than the monster; it is destroyed when the boy and his monster land. Both fly upwards and land on the moon, where the boy is free to craft a future of his choosing.|$|E

25|$|Mack {{noted that}} there was a {{worldwide}} history of visionary experiences, especially in pre-industrial societies. One example is the vision quest common to some Native American cultures. Only fairly recently in Western culture, notes Mack, have such visionary events been interpreted as aberrations or as mental illness. Mack suggested that abduction accounts might best be considered as part of <b>this</b> <b>larger</b> tradition of visionary encounters.|$|E

25|$|Critics {{considered}} the score to be Sullivan's finest, including its overture, {{which is in}} sonata form, rather than being written as a sequential pot-pourri of tunes from the opera, as {{in most of the}} other Gilbert and Sullivan overtures.

This recommendation would realign Reno's (101) C-130s to the Air National Guard at Little Rock Air Force Base (17), where a larger, more effective squadron size would be possible. <b>This</b> <b>larger</b> squadron at Little Rock would also create the opportunity for an association between active duty and the Air National Guard, optimizing aircraft utilization.|$|E

Because of this available airpower, Vang Pao planned to commit his guerrillas to a spoiling attack ranging out from forward bases at Nakhang and Houei Hinsa to sweep across Route 6. The Central Intelligence Agency section stationed in the American embassy believed that by disrupting the communists' expected usual dry season offensive, Vang Pao could gain the initiative {{in the struggle for}} northern Laos.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of February 2015, {{it was reported that}} Fremantle Volunteer Sea Rescue would likely become based in the signal station. This drew criticism from members of the Cantonment Hill Working Group who had developed the master plan for the site which the City of Fremantle had previously given assurances to implement. In late March 2015 draft plans were presented at a council meeting detailing the creation of a convention center and restaurant for the site, with the FSR suggested as being a medium-term occupant while <b>this</b> <b>larger</b> plan came to fruition.|$|E

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>larger</b> church stood {{close to}} St Andrews church, Histon. It was mainly {{demolished}} in about 1595 by Sir Francis Hinde {{to raise money}} and to provide building materials for a new wing at Madingley Hall. Hinde did not, however, completely demolish the church: in 1728 the chancel {{was said to be}} still standing. The churchyard survived until 1757 but was then taken into Abbey Farm. It is possible that the reduced population of Histon following the Black Death encouraged Hinde to demolish the church. Today the church site is not visible and is still shut off on the land of Abbey Farm.|$|E
25|$|Turner later {{travelled}} to New York {{where he}} bought the schooner Toronto, sailing her back to California. There he went into business with Captain Richard Thomas Rundle and started shipping timber to San Francisco from the Mendocino coast. They were soon able to replace the Toronto with another larger schooner, the Louis Perry, {{and a few years}} later they purchased the brig Temandra. When Turner took <b>this</b> <b>larger</b> vessel to the Sea of Okhotsk he noticed the abundance of cod and so bought the Porpoise to capitalize on this, as cod were selling in San Francisco at a high price. Meanwhile, Turner also set up a company to trade with Tahiti.|$|E
