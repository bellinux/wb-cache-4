50|$|After {{the release}} of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, DC Comics became the Star Trek comic licensee, {{publishing}} stories from 1984 set in the movie era (see Star Trek DC comics). In 1988, the series ended when Paramount withdrew its license at the advice of Richard Arnold following a series of disputes between Arnold and DC Comics, specifically with the comic's main author, Peter David. After a year's hiatus DC's second Star Trek series was launched with an adaptation of Star Trek V. Original stories {{took place in the}} large gap between Star Trek V and Star Trek VI, but did not continue from the previous series, so storylines from that series were either ignored or rewritten. Although more limited in scope than the first series due to restrictions from Paramount - which included a prohibition by Richard Arnold against the creation and use of original and non-series-related ongoing characters in the comic stories - and the controversial removal of Peter David as head writer, the series still lasted 80 issues. Howard Weinstein, who like David was also a Star Trek novelist, took over writing the comic with issue No. 20, and used the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>flesh-out</b> some of the changes between Star Trek V and VI, such as Sulu's promotion to captain of the Excelsior.|$|E

40|$|Increased {{interest}} in and debate in Europe and at European Union (EU) level about the potential utility of ‘temporary’ and ‘circular’ forms of migration {{is accompanied by a}} certain elusiveness about the meaning of these terms.

By focusing on information gathering and the role of knowledge, the article develops a practice-based approach to analyse the relationship between research and policy, the role of the Commission and the activities of European Migration Network (EMN) in the quest for the meaning of temporary and circular migration. Information gathering and knowledge creation at EU level are shown to serve instrumental purposes by informing policy choices (‘evidence-based policy-making’) but it is also shown that existing policy choices cast a long shadow to shape the context within which knowledge is developed (policy-based evidence-making) while information gathering and knowledge development can legitimate institutional roles, such as the Commission (policy-based institution-building) ...|$|E

40|$|This is a {{study of}} the {{concerns}} and life - style of the clergy of the established Church in two Kent Deaneries throughout the hundred year period, 1770 - 1870. How far, it is considered, were episcopal hopes, which were expressed in the Charges of Bishop and Archdeacon, fulfilled in the parishes, especially in the matters of residence and education. The extent of non-residence is deduced from. such evidence as is available for the earlier part of the period and after 1830 from Visitation and other returns. The provision of Sunday Schools is used as an example of clerical response to a diocesan policy in the field of education. The exercise of patronage, residence, plurality, the length ofincumbencies, the employment of curates and their prospects, are looked at throughout the period. The provision of new churches, agrarian unrest, tithe and clerical emoluments, church rate, relationship with dissent, worship provision, the visitation process, the clergyman's role in society, the differing demands of town ministry and rural ministry are examined as events bring them to the fore. The priorities of successive bishops are noted and the lives of sample clergymen are taken for each period, both <b>to</b> <b>flesh-out</b> the statistics and to illustrate the evolving pattern of ministry...|$|E
40|$|The {{corpus of}} {{the duty to}} prevent {{genocide}} was partially circumscribed {{for the first time}} in a court of law in the 2007 Bosnian Genocide case. In that case, the International Court of Justice adopted the due diligence standard to define the scope of the duty to prevent genocide. This standard provides that if a State has the capacity to effectively influence genocidal actors and the knowledge that there exists a serious risk that genocide may occur, then that State must do everything within its power - everything within the means available to it - to prevent the genocide from occurring. While the Court's holding in the Bosnian Genocide case was an important step in the normative development of the duty to prevent genocide, the Court nevertheless neglected to expound the full extent of the scope of the due diligence standard. For instance, the Court's holding did not address whom among the several States of the international order must act, and how such States once identified must act when the duty to prevent genocide is triggered. This dissertation attempts to do so. First, it provides an overview of the obligations laid out it in the Genocide Convention, and expounds the significance of the due diligence standard in the prevention of genocide. Second, it identifies the central role to be played in genocide prevention by the five permanent members of the Security Council (the P 5), which, as the 'great powers' of the international order, have the greatest capacity to not only effectively influence genocidal actors but also to remain informed about imminent or ongoing genocides. Third, it explores the manner in and the extent to which the P 5 must act within and without the Security Council when faced with an imminent genocide, as dictated by the due diligence standard. Finally, it analyzes the standing of the duty to prevent genocide under customary international law and dispels, through a conflict of norms analysis, any doubts arising from possible conflicting obligations held by the P 5 under the UN Charter, in favor of their ultimate duty to prevent the occurrence of genocidal acts. Ultimately, the findings described in this dissertation have significant consequences for not only the duty to prevent genocide, but also the responsibility to protect doctrine, the responsibility not to veto initiative, and the prohibition of the use of force in general. They go beyond the soft spoken political commitments to protect national, ethnic, racial, or religious groups from what has been considered 'the crime of crimes', <b>to</b> <b>flesh-out</b> the self-standing legal value of the duty to prevent genocide, and the consequences thereof to the international community at large. As a result, Everything Within Their Power: The P 5 's Duty to Prevent Genocide will be of particular interest to scholars and students of international law and international relations...|$|E
40|$|In my thesis, Bleached Bones Rattling: Reviving the Art of Sacramental Reading, I examine recent novels by David Adams Richards, Michael Winter, Lisa Moore, and Michael Crummey {{in order}} <b>to</b> <b>flesh-out</b> {{the idea of}} "holiness" and to show ways in which this idea has been refigured in {{contemporary}} Atlantic Canadian fiction. I begin with Richards {{because he is a}} writer who has long claimed that the holiness of human life is his central subject matter: a theme that has received harsh, cursory criticism by Christopher Armstrong and Herb Wyile (1997) and more in-depth, historical treatment by Tony Tremblay in David Adams Richards of the Miramichi (2010). Beginning with Richards and working through novels by these three other Atlantic Canadian authors (who do not necessarily share Richards' Catholic worldview), I examine varying ways in which holiness confronts a reader, calls her to responsibility, draws her out of herself into a world of others, and, through a sacramental encounter, returns that reader to herself and her world with a broader view and experience of others. [...] Each chapter begins with an articulation of these stages in terms of theory and then explores the shape that theory takes in a reading of a specific novel. In chapter one, I bring the "religious" philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas and Jacques Derrida to bear on David Adams Richards' Incidents in the Life of Markus Paul (2011) in order to illuminate how a reader is called to responsibility through the "adieu" of another. In the second chapter, I examine the covenant a reader makes with a story (and the dialogic world of others therein) in a discussion that approaches Michael Winter's The Death of Donna Whalen (2010) through the literary criticism of J. Edward Chamberlin and Deborah Bowen. In the third chapter, I give shape to a reader's journey out from herself- her own ego- in looking at Lisa Moore's February (2009), Gregory Wolfe's essay "Stalking the Spirit," and the philosophy of Paul Ricoeur. And in the fourth and final chapter, I examine the sacramental nature of the reading experience by comparing the theoretical views of Daniel Coleman with those of Richard Kearney and "tasting" the substantiation of these views in Michael Crummey's Galore (2009). [...] My aim throughout this work is to construct a new theoretical language, out of an old religious language, in which to house the idea of holiness and to give it new critical shape in contemporary literary studies. In doing so, I demonstrate how holiness, despite its religious history and connotations, is more than an "idea" but a "real" life-giving and humanizing presence in fiction that can be encountered by all readers. [...] This encounter, far from being idealistic or utopian, is a messy, combative affair which I depict as Jacob wrestling the angel: a reader grappling with that which is beyond her. In doing so, I demonstrate what Jean-Louis Chretien, in Hand to Hand: Listening to the Work of Art (2003), describes as the "intimate violence" of this encounter: this covenant. I do this by confronting theories of holiness with their "twin" forms in specific novels, forcing these theories to wrestle with their fictive figurations-like the left-handed and right-handed twins of Mother Earth in Iroquoisian myth- in order to see how stories can wound and bless these theories and transfigure them into a new theory of holiness. [...] Ultimately, I argue that reading allows for a continuing substantiation of holiness-an empathetic sense of human worth-{{in the life of a}} reader. Such readings, as I demonstrate in my encounters with novels by Richards, Winter, Moore, and Crummey, open a reader to be both wounded and blessed by the humanity of others, allowing that reader imaginative opportunities to become ever more human herself. This involves more than "recovering the human in an ideological age," to riff on the subtitle of Gregory Wolfe's recent book Beauty Will Save the World (2011). What I propose is are-imagination of what it can mean to be human if we see our fellow humans as, in some way, holy and irreplaceable: utterly unique and of infinite value. [...] Central to my thesis is the belief that stories wrestle from us such re-imaginations: of ourselves and our worlds. And we too leave our mark on stories in our interpretations of them. Stories, after all, can be catalysts for imaginative awakenings in the life of a reader, and these awakenings-these re-imaginations-are, ultimately, the prophetic outworking of sacramental readings: Ezekiel's valley of dry bones rattling, beginning to rise up. ...|$|E
