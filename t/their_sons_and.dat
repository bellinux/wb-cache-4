5|$|The Gouldens {{included}} {{their children}} in social activism. As part of the movement to end slavery in the US, Goulden welcomed American abolitionist Henry Ward Beecher when he visited Manchester. Sophia Jane Goulden used the novel Uncle Tom's Cabin – written by Beecher's sister Harriet Beecher Stowe – as a regular source of bedtime stories for <b>their</b> <b>sons</b> <b>and</b> daughters. In her 1914 autobiography My Own Story, Pankhurst recalls visiting a bazaar {{at a young age}} to collect money for newly freed slaves in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Women were {{expected}} to obey the will of their father, then their husband, and then their adult son in old age. However, it is known from contemporary sources {{that there were many}} deviations to this rule, especially in regard to mothers over <b>their</b> <b>sons,</b> <b>and</b> empresses who ordered around and openly humiliated their fathers and brothers. Women were exempt from the annual corvée labor duties, but often engaged in a range of income-earning occupations aside from their domestic chores of cooking and cleaning.|$|E
5|$|Macedonia's {{parliament}} {{adopted a}} declaration of independence from Yugoslavia in January 1991, {{but it did not}} take effect until a referendum in September 1991 confirmed it. A group of Macedonian JNA officers secretly sought to prevent soldiers from Macedonia being sent to Croatia, and busloads of soldiers' parents, funded by the Macedonian government, travelled to Montenegro to find <b>their</b> <b>sons</b> <b>and</b> bring them home. Meanwhile, Macedonians continued to be conscripted into the JNA and serve in the war in Croatia. The commander of JNA forces in {{the first phase of the}} battle, Gen. Aleksandar Spirkovski, was a Macedonian. His ethnicity was probably a significant factor in the decision to replace him with Života Panić, a Serb. In 2005, the Macedonian Army's Chief of Staff, Gen. Miroslav Stojanovski, became the focus of international controversy after it was alleged that he had been involved in possible war crimes following the battle.|$|E

5|$|The Chinese clan or lineage {{involved}} men {{who shared}} a common patrilineal ancestor, yet were divided into subgroups whose behavior towards each other was regulated according to Confucian mores which dictated what relative should be closer and more intimate. The four different subgroups were: (1) brother, brother's sons, and brother's grandsons; (2) father's brothers, father's brother's sons and grandsons; (3) paternal grandfather's brothers, <b>their</b> <b>sons,</b> <b>and</b> grandsons; and (4) paternal great-grandfather's brothers, their sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons. While one was expected to mourn {{for an entire year}} over the death of any relative in the first subgroup, one was expected to mourn for only five months when a relative in the second subgroup had died. No ritual mourning was expected at all for relatives in the third and fourth subgroups. While a son mourned three years for a father's death, he only mourned one year for his mother's. Since carrying on the patrilineal line meant the continuation of ancestor worship, it was important to have at least one son, even if he was adopted from another family (although it was considered imperative that he share the same surname, otherwise his ancestral sacrifices could be considered null and void).|$|E
25|$|The titles {{themselves}} were {{given by the}} Kings, Sultans and Emperors (equivalent to the western Fount of honour) to <b>their</b> <b>sons</b> <b>and</b> grandsons, or even distant kins. Noblemen loyal to the kings also received this Title.|$|E

25|$|Hereditary salt {{merchant}}s {{in the city}} of Yangzhou became the symbol of wealth. One merchant commissioned a chamber-pot made of gold which was so tall that he had to climb a ladder to use it.

25|$|The {{reluctance}} of Sicilian men to allow women to take paid work meant that women usually remained at home, their seclusion often increased {{due to the}} restrictions of mourning.

25|$|Lewis and Julia Levin had one child, a {{daughter}} called Louise or Louisa (1840–1919). (It is occasionally reported erroneously {{that there was}} a son named Louis.) Louisa married a Brazilian diplomat named Carlos de Barros in Washington City in 1862, and later lived in South America, Philadelphia and New York City. One of <b>their</b> <b>sons</b> <b>and</b> two grandsons were institutionalized in the 20th century for insanity.|$|E

25|$|Yesün Temür {{was born}} in Mongolia in 1293 to Gammala, a son of Zhenjin, who was presumed heir to his father Kublai Khan. Gammala was {{appointed}} as Jinong (jinwang, 晉王) in 1292 after Zhenjin's death, but he lost the race for successor to his younger brother Temür. Khanship was assumed by Temür, Darmabala, and <b>their</b> <b>sons</b> <b>and</b> grandson, so Gammala and his son Yesün Temür {{were out of the}} race. As Jinong, Gammala owned Mongolia north of the Gobi Desert and enshrined Genghis Khan in the Four Great Ordo. In 1302 Gammala died and Yesün Temür took over as Jinong.|$|E

25|$|Clovis I divided his realm {{between his}} four sons, who united to defeat Burgundy in 534. Internecine feuding {{occurred}} during the reigns of the brothers Sigebert I and Chilperic I, which was largely fuelled by the rivalry of their queens, Brunhilda and Fredegunda, and which continued during the reigns of <b>their</b> <b>sons</b> <b>and</b> their grandsons. Three distinct subkingdoms emerged: Austrasia, Neustria and Burgundy, each of which developed independently and sought to exert influence over the others. The influence of the Arnulfing clan of Austrasia ensured that the centre of political gravity in the kingdom gradually shifted eastwards to the Rhineland.|$|E
25|$|With its society {{disrupted}} by slave losses during the Revolution, South Carolina did not embrace manumission as readily as {{states of the}} Upper South. Most of its small number of free blacks were of mixed race, often the children of major planters or <b>their</b> <b>sons</b> <b>and</b> slave mothers. Their wealthy fathers sometimes passed on social capital to such mixed-race children, arranging for their manumission even if officially denying them as legal heirs. Fathers sometimes arranged to have their slave children educated, arranged apprenticeships in skilled trades, and other preparation for independent adulthood. Some planters sent their mixed-race slave children to schools and colleges in the North for education.|$|E
25|$|The median wasp, as in {{all other}} Hymenoptera species, {{produces}} females from fertilized diploid eggs, but males are produced from unfertilized haploid eggs. This means that although workers are unable to mate they can still produce male offspring. This type of sex determination is known as haplodiploidy. The result is that brothers have a relatedness of 0.5 as expected of full siblings, but sisters have a higher relatedness of 0.75. Sisters receive half of their mother’s genes {{as well as all}} their father’s genes because all of the sperm he produces are identical. Mothers have a relatedness of 0.5 to both <b>their</b> <b>sons</b> <b>and</b> daughters.|$|E
