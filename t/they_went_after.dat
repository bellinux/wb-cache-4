5|$|While at Coldwater Canyon in 1977, Cagney had a minor stroke. After {{two weeks}} in the hospital, Zimmermann became his {{full-time}} caregiver, traveling with Billie Vernon and him wherever <b>they</b> <b>went.</b> <b>After</b> the stroke, Cagney was no longer able to undertake many of his favorite pastimes, including horseback riding and dancing, and as he became more depressed, he even gave up painting. Encouraged by his wife and Zimmermann, Cagney accepted an offer from the director Miloš Forman to star in a small but pivotal role in the film Ragtime (1981).|$|E
25|$|Feeling qualms of guilt, {{they went}} to go tell the king of Samaria, and called to the porters of the city telling them what they had seen, and the porters told the king's {{household}} within. The king arose in the night, and told his servants that he suspected that the Arameans had hidden in the field, thinking that when the Samaritans came out, {{they would be able}} to get into the city. One of his servants suggested that some men take five of the horses that remained and go see, and they took two chariots with horses to go and see. <b>They</b> <b>went</b> <b>after</b> the Arameans as far as the Jordan River, and all the way was littered with garments and vessels that the Arameans had cast away in their haste, and the messengers returned and told the king. So the people went out and looted Arameans' camp, so that the price of fine flour and two measures of barley each dropped to a shekel, as God had said it would. And the king appointed the captain on whom he leaned to take charge of the gate, and the people trampled him and killed him before he could taste of the flour, just as the man of God Elisha had said.|$|E
500|$|As {{this was}} happening, Briskin {{was asked to}} return to active duty, {{this time in the}} navy, for a brief stint in the {{beginning}} of March, 1945; he was assigned to the Photographic Sciences Laboratory, where he was to evaluate the Navy's filming activity. By the end of the month, he had finished his study, and submitted his findings to Captain Gene Markey, head of the Navy's Photographic Services, after which he returned to Hollywood to continue setting up Capra-Briskin. With Capra still in the service, Briskin incorporated the new film studio, with the name Liberty Films, in late April 1945. One of the first properties <b>they</b> <b>went</b> <b>after</b> was the hugely successful play, Harvey. In July, they convinced William Wyler to join their fledgling company, and he became part-owner, agreeing to start work for the company {{as soon as he was}} discharged from the army, and produce one film per year for the studio. In August, Briskin negotiated a deal with RKO Studios for Liberty Pictures to film 9 movies at the RKO studio, [...] and in September Wyler announced that the company would produce 3 films a year for their deal with RKO. Before the end of the year George Stevens had also become a part owner in the venture.|$|E

In his speech he said [...] "some of the worst governments that we've ever had, do you {{know one of the}} first things they did? <b>They</b> <b>went</b> <b>after</b> unions.

2500|$|At the Convention, Stevenson, as {{governor}} of the host state, was assigned to give the welcoming address to the delegates. His speech was so stirring and witty that it helped stampede his nomination, {{in spite of his}} continued protests that he was not a presidential candidate. In his welcoming speech he poked fun at the 1952 Republican National Convention, which had been held in Chicago in the same coliseum two weeks earlier. Stevenson described the achievements of the Democratic Party under Presidents Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, but noted [...] "our Republican friends have said it was all a miserable failure. For almost a week pompous phrases marched over this landscape in search of an idea, and the only idea that they found was that the two great decades of progress...were the misbegotten spawn of bungling, of corruption, of socialism, of mismanagement, of waste and worse...after listening to this everlasting procession of epithets about our [...] misdeeds I was even surprised the next morning when the mail was delivered on time.

2500|$|On {{the first}} day of the Battle of Stones River near Murfreesboro, December 31, 1862, Rosecrans and Bragg both {{intended}} to attack their opponent's right wing. The Confederates attacked first and drove back Major General Alexander McCook's right wing. Rousseau's division was Rosecrans's only reserve but he had to use them in the battle to stop the Union retreat on his right. Rousseau's forces formed to the right of Brigadier General Philip H. Sheridan's division which was holding the right side of the line while men of the units in retreat passed by. Captain Keteltas's E Company, 1st Battalion, 15th U.S. Infantry Regiment was in an advanced position across a cotton field and in front of isolated cedar trees and deployed as skirmishers while the rest of the regiment was back in the trees. Bugler William J. Carson later wrote that the skirmishers fell back to the trees in the face of an overwhelming Confederate attack. After holding for about 20 minutes, the regulars began to fall back quickly but with some of the men firing as <b>they</b> <b>went.</b> <b>After</b> the men had gone back about 100 yards, Keteltas ordered Carson to sound the rally. With this bugle call, many of the men turned and began to return the Confederate fire. [...] At this time, Carson's cousin, Private William B. McCall, was killed.|$|E
