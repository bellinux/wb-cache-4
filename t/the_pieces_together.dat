5|$|After {{not telling}} anyone about hitting Delia, Adam fears the {{investigation}} is closing in on him. He names Jack Connor's godfather and makes him promise to protect him should anything happen to him, and then proposes to Chelsea again and asks her to move to Paris with him, like they had planned during their first marriage. At the same time, Victor's private investigation on the hit-and-run driver leads him to Adam. He agrees to not turn him in {{as long as he}} can take part in Connor's life; a role he had initially refused him. Adam agrees as he and Chelsea remarry. Days before their flight to Paris, Delia's father Billy Abbott (Billy Miller) puts <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>together</b> and realizes Adam is the one who killed his daughter. He holds him at gunpoint and demands he drive them to places where milestones in Delia's life occurred. While driving, Adam attempts to grab the gun as a shot is fired and the car drives off a ravine. One of them staggers away from the crash and collapses, revealed to be Billy. Nick and Paul Williams (Doug Davidson) find the overturned vehicle as it catches fire and explodes. Adam's body is thrown from the vehicle, is not recovered and he is presumed dead, devastating Chelsea just as news that Adam killed Delia breaks. However, Adam's bloody hand is later shown to be moving, alluding that he survived. Soon after, he is shown to be lying in a bed, being held captive by an unknown captor. Later Victor informs Chelsea that his investigators have found Adam's remains, but elsewhere Adam is seen paying off Victor's investigator, confirming that Adam has faked his death.|$|E

25|$|Angel's {{searching for}} a kidnapped child, only to stumble upon a force of unspeakable evil and unimaginable power, seeking him for some reason. Angel ends up {{fighting}} a walking volcano, and must try and survive long enough to discover who or what is behind the recent strange series of events. Finally, the strange evil reveals itself; Perfect Zheng, a vampire who beat Angel up in the 1920s. Angel, Wesley, Cordelia, and Gunn try to put <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>together</b> in time {{to make sense of}} present events, a possible product of Angel's past encounter with Zheng. In fact, as it turns out, the gypsy curse that was used on Angel was meant to be used on Zheng, turning him into the 'vampire champion', but it didn't take, and Zheng is determined to find out why Angel's soul was restored and his wasn't. A battle for survival between the pair ensues, which Angel wins. Supposed to be set early in the second season of Angel. Collected in Angel: Long Night's Journey.|$|E
25|$|At this point, {{the toilet}} parts without their molds look like and {{are about as}} strong as soft clay. After about one hour the top core mold (interior of toilet) is removed. The rim mold bottom (which {{includes}} a place to mount the holding tank) is removed, and it then has appropriate slanted holes for the rinsing jets cut, and the mounting holes for tank and seat are punched into the rim piece. Valve holes for rapid water entry into the toilet are cut into the rim pieces. The exposed top of the bowl piece is then covered with a thick slip and the still-uncured rim is attached {{on top of the}} bowl so that the bowl and hollow rim are now a single piece. The bowl plus rim is then inverted, and the toilet bowl is set upside down on the top rim mold to hold <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>together</b> as they dry. Later, {{all the rest of the}} mold pieces are removed. As the clay body dries further it hardens more and continues to shrink. After a few hours, the casting is self-supporting, and is called greenware.|$|E

25|$|Fergus and Mandy try to {{reassemble}} {{the broken}} {{pieces of the}} mirror. Fergus has {{the idea that if}} they put <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>together</b> on their side the mirror will repair itself on the other side. It works. While in the Hall of Mirrors, a kind woman appears to Daniel and Constance. She tells Constance she was right to steal the crown as the heir is dead. She also reveals that the crown can make a difference to the future. Meanwhile, in 1867 Gervais strikes gold, meaning he no longer has any need to sell the crown. The mirror appears and Constance goes through. Upon her return, Constance discovers that her father has entrusted the crown to her to do as she sees fit, but before she can arrange this with her friends in the 1990s, the mirror vanishes, signifying the end of their adventures. Back in 1997, Daniel, Fergus and Mandy visit Constance's grave and discover a clue to the location of the crown. Someone arrives and gives them a letter from Constance. The letter states that they are the new proprietors of the Crown Foundation. Now that their adventures had come to an end, Daniel decides to go back home and stay with this mum.|$|E
500|$|Panels are {{individual}} images {{containing a}} segment of action, often surrounded by a border. [...] Prime moments in a narrative are broken down into panels via a process called encapsulation. [...] The reader puts <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>together</b> via the process of closure by using background knowledge {{and an understanding of}} panel relations to combine panels mentally into events. [...] The size, shape, and arrangement of panels each affect the timing and pacing of the narrative. [...] The contents of a panel may be asynchronous, with events depicted in the same image not necessarily occurring at the same time.|$|E

Music industry attorney and author Martin Frascogna writes that [...] "it's unmistakably clear that Burnley started the group, is the creative force behind the group and essentially dictates the group's decisions." [...] Bands such as Nirvana, Live, Bush, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, and The Beatles have been cited as influences. Burnley remarked in 2009 that while the other band members did contribute, it was [...] "always left {{up to me to}} put all <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>together</b> and make it so that it's even anything at all." [...] However, Burnley expressed how he considered Rauch to be his [...] "writing partner" [...] during Dear Agony, and that he looked forward to writing with him in the future. After joining the band in 2014 as part of the new lineup, Rauch provided writing contributions on Dark Before Dawn, writing the intro and outro tracks as well as riffs on two other tracks. Burnley revealed in 2015 that the whole band would write songs for Breaking Benjamin in the future, and that [...] "It just so happens that when they came on board for this album, I was already 95 percent done", adding, [...] "I'm really looking forward to writing the next one all together." ...|$|E

500|$|Others {{have argued}} that the film is itself a metaphor for filmmaking, and that the filmgoing {{experience}} itself, images flashing before one's eyes in a darkened room, is akin to a dream. Writing in Wired, Jonah Lehrer supported this interpretation and presented neurological evidence that brain activity is strikingly similar during film-watching and sleeping. In both, the visual cortex is highly active and the prefrontal cortex, which deals with logic, deliberate analysis, and self-awareness, is quiet. Paul argued that the experience of going to a picturehouse is itself an exercise in shared dreaming, particularly when viewing Inception: the film's sharp cutting between scenes forces the viewer to create larger narrative arcs to stitch <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>together.</b> This demand of production parallel to consumption of the images, {{on the part of the}} audience is analogous to dreaming itself. As in the film's story, in a cinema one enters into the space of another's dream, in this case Nolan's, as with any work of art, one's reading of it is ultimately influenced by one's own subjective desires and subconscious. At Bir-Hakeim bridge in Paris, Ariadne creates an illusion of infinity by adding facing mirrors underneath its struts, Stephanie Dreyfus in la Croix asked [...] "Is this not a strong, beautiful metaphor for the cinema and its power of illusion?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The castings, too, had problems. Several pieces had cracked, in {{some cases}} severely. Music and Harvest had a [...] long crack that {{extended}} more than halfway around the statue. Welding {{proved to be an}} unsatisfactory solution to the cracks because the bronze could not be heated to a temperature high enough to accept welding. Where possible, cracks were filled using a solder composed of 97 percent tin and 3 percent silver. Where the widest cracks occurred, interior straps were applied to help keep <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>together.</b>|$|E

50|$|Stripping: Avoid {{stripping}} antiques {{at almost}} any cost, stripping in its true sense involves dipping <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> in a chemical bath that will remove finish, patina, {{and in some cases}} the glue holding <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> <b>together.</b> A stripped antique is truly stripped, mainly of its value. Veneering may peel, joints will swell or break apart, and <b>the</b> <b>piece</b> usually has to be completely rebuilt.

2500|$|Solder ( [...] , [...] or in North America [...] ) is a {{fusible metal}} alloy {{used to create}} a {{permanent}} bond between metal workpieces.

In fact, solder must be melted in order to adhere to and connect <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>together,</b> so a suitable alloy for use as solder will have a lower melting point than the pieces it is intended to join.

Perforated plates of steel (known as [...] "tie-plates") are bolted to this seam as well. Steel bolts were used in all the statues to join pieces together, and steel angle irons were used in each statue's interior to make them more rigid.

2500|$|The Dillinger Escape Plan {{is often}} {{regarded}} as one of the pioneers of mathcore, a genre rooted in both hardcore punk and heavy metal.

Listening to it sometimes feels like being ground between a system of elaborate gears. Chromatic turns and cycling patterns notch all <b>the</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>together.</b> The guitars are often dissonant, shifting into double and triple time, with vocals that deliver a blow-torch scorch.
