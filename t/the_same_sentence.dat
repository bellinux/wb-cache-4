5|$|As with {{previous}} codes, Han law distinguished {{what should be}} considered murderous killings (with malice and foresight), wittingly killing, killing by mistake, and killing by accident. Although a father was the undisputed head of the family, he {{was not allowed to}} mutilate or kill any of its members as punishment; if he did, he would be tried for physical assault or murder, respectively. Yet not all murders were given <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sentence,</b> since relation and circumstance were considered in the sentencing. For example, A father would be given a much less severe sentence for murdering a son than if a son murdered his father. Women had certain rights under Han law. It was against the law for husbands to physically abuse their wives. Rape cases were also commonly filed in court and were punished by Han law. Women could level charges against men in court, while it was commonly accepted in Han jurisprudence that women were capable of telling the truth in court.|$|E
5|$|In the {{footnotes}} to his 1873 compilation, Milne-Edwards correlated the subfossil {{species with}} parrots mentioned by Leguat. In 1875, A. Newton analysed Tafforet's then newly rediscovered account, and identified {{a description of}} the Rodrigues parrot therein. In a footnote in an 1891 edition of Leguat's memoir, the English writer Samuel Pasfield Oliver doubted that the parrots mentioned were the Rodrigues parrot, due to their smaller size, and suggested they may have been Newton's parakeet (Psittacula exsul). As Leguat mentioned both green and blue parrots in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sentence,</b> the English palaeontologist Julian Hume suggested in 2007 that these could either be interpreted as references to both the Rodrigues parrot and Newton's parakeet, or as two colour morphs of the latter.|$|E

25|$|The {{supremum}} axiom of the reals {{refers to}} subsets of the reals {{and is therefore}} a second-order logical statement.

25|$|The regular {{spelling}} {{system of}} Old English was {{swept away by}} the Norman Conquest, and English itself was supplanted in some spheres by Norman French for three centuries, eventually emerging with its spelling much influenced by French. English had also borrowed large numbers of words from French, which naturally kept their French spellings as {{there was no reason}} or mechanism to change them. The spelling of Middle English, such as in the writings of Geoffrey Chaucer, is very irregular and inconsistent, with the same word being spelled in different ways, sometimes even in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sentence.</b> However, these were generally much better guides to the then pronunciation than modern English spelling is.|$|E
25|$|The modern Hebrew {{calendar}} {{follows a}} seven-day weekly cycle, which runs concurrently but {{independently of the}} monthly and annual cycles. The origin of Hebrew seven day week and the Sabbath, {{as well as the}} true meaning of the name, is uncertain. The earliest Biblical passages which mention it (Exodus. 20 v. 10; and 24 v. 21; Deut. 5. v. 14; Amos 8 v. 5) presuppose its previous existence, and analysis of all the references to it in the canon makes it plain that its observance was neither general nor altogether spontaneous in either pre-exilic or post-exilic Israel. It was probably originally connected in some manner with the cult of the moon , as indeed is suggested by the frequent mention of Sabbath and New-Moon festivals in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sentence</b> (Isa. 1 v. 13; Amos 8 v. 5; H Kings 6 v. 23).|$|E
40|$|AbstractTwo {{context-free}} grammars {{are defined}} as being structurally-equivalent if they generate <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sentences</b> and assign similar parse trees (differing only in the labelling of the nodes) to each. It is argued {{that this type of}} equivalence is more significant than weak equivalence, which requires only that <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sentences</b> be generated. While the latter type of equivalence is in general undecidable, it is shown here that there exists a finite algorithm for determining if two arbitrary context-free grammars are structurally equivalent. A related result is a procedure for converting an arbitrary context-free grammar into a structurally equivalent “simple” grammar (S-grammar) where this is possible, or else indicating that no such grammar exists. The question of structural ambiguity is also studied and a procedure is given for determining if an arbitrary context-free grammar can generate <b>the</b> <b>same</b> string in 2 different ways with similar parse trees...|$|R

25|$|Alternate {{theoretical}} {{approaches to}} syntax make different assumptions regarding {{what is considered}} a constituent. In mainstream phrase structure grammar (and its derivatives), individual words are constituents {{in and of themselves}} as well as being parts of other constituents, whereas in dependency grammar, certain core words in each phrase are not a constituent by themselves, but only members of a phrasal constituent. The following trees show <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sentence</b> in two different theoretical representations, with a phrase structure representation on the left and a dependency grammar representation on the right. In both trees, a constituent is understood to be the entire tree or any labelled subtree (a node plus all the nodes dominated by that node); note that words like killed and with, for instance, form subtrees (and are considered constituents) in the phrase structure representation but not in the dependency structure representation.|$|E
25|$|The genealogical {{position}} of Huni {{in the family}} line of ruling kings, during {{the time when the}} 3rd dynasty ended and the 4th started, is highly disputed. Contemporary and later documents often mention Huni and his follower Snefru in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sentence,</b> always in direct succession. Therefore, Egyptologists and historians believe that Huni might have even been related to Snefru. A key figure in this case is queen Meresankh I, the royal mother of Snefru. She definitely bore the title of a queen, but no contemporary source connects her name with the title of a daughter or wife of Huni. This circumstance raises doubts in the family relationship between Huni and Snefru. Today most scholars prefer to believe the historian Manetho, who claims in his Aegyptiacae that with the inthronisation of Snefru a different royal house gained power over Egypt and a new dynasty had begun.|$|E
25|$|The {{sentence}} {{from the}} appeal traded jail time for increased fines. After the initial trial, each defendant was {{to serve a}} year of jail time and pay fines just under one million dollars each. After the appeal, Fredrik Neij was sentenced to 10 months, Peter Sunde to eight months, and Carl Lundstrom to four months in prison. The Svea Court of Appeal decided to grant all Nordic companies their full request in compensation for copyright infringement due to The Pirate Bay, with outside companies being granted smaller gains in compensation. The total fine for the three defendants was increased from 32 million Kronor to 46 million Kronor (US$6.5 million) Each defendant was issued different sentences because of individual contribution toward facilitating illegal file sharing. Instead of issuing all defendants <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sentence,</b> they were each judged on their contribution and sentenced accordingly. However, the fine is to be paid by the three defendants present at the sentencing. The verdict was appealed to the Supreme Court.|$|E

25|$|Beginning {{in about}} 1955, {{a new wave}} of composers appeared, {{inspired}} by Bartók and breathing new life into Hungarian music. Composers from this era included András Mihály, Endre Szervánszky, Pál Kadosa, Ferenc Farkas and György Ránki. These composers both brought back old techniques of Hungarian music, as well as adapting imported avant-garde and modernist elements of Western classical music. György Ligeti and György Kurtág are often mentioned in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>sentence.</b> They were born near each other in Transylvania and studied in Budapest in the 1940s. Both were influenced by Stockhausen. Kurtág's modernism borrowed many influences from the past. By contrast Ligeti invented a new language with chromatic tone clusters and elements of parody. Both were multi-lingual and became exiles. This is reflected in the texts for their works. The foundation of the New Music Studio in 1970 helped further modernize Hungarian classical music though promoting composers that felt audience education was as important a consideration as artistic merit in composition and performance; these Studio's well-known composers include László Vidovszky, László Sáry and Zoltán Jeney. Miklós Rózsa, who studied in Germany and eventually settled in the United States, achieved international recognition for his Hollywood film scores as well as his concert music.|$|E
