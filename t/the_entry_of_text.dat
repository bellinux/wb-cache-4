40|$|Abstract — we {{constructed}} an interface {{system that}} would allow a similarly paralyzed user to interact with a computer with almost full functional capability. That is, the system operates as a mouse initially, but the user {{has the ability to}} toggle {{in and out of a}} keyboard mode allowing <b>the</b> <b>entry</b> <b>of</b> <b>text.</b> This is achieved by using the control from a single eye, tracking the position of the pupil for direction, and using blinking as an input. As detection of eye motion proved too challenging, we built an accelerometer based tilt detector to determine head motion, so that, although not as applicable in this particular case, it might be use by a quadriplegic individual Introduction The system uses accelerometers to detect the user's head tilt in order to direct mouse movement on the monitor. The clicking of the mouse i...|$|E

We have designed a language that is a full-function programming language with embedded text. This shift in emphasis results in a level of consistency, flexibility, and power not otherwise possible. Introduction A batch-style computer typesetting system accepts text files as input, to produce formatted documents as output. Most such systems are extensible. They allow definitions of new document styles and commands. Some, like T E X, also allow the input syntax to be changed. To do all this, {{the format of the}} input must be a complex language. The design of this language affects the robustness, ease of use, and overall quality of the whole system. A document, therefore, is a mix of text and commands, some of which define new comman [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Structured {{interviews}} or questionnaires often comprise open-ended questions, {{especially to}} obtain additional {{information from the}} interviewee not covered by standardised questions. Ordinarily, the analysis of these open-ended questions cannot be undertaken by the same computer program, in which quantitative data is entered and managed, which impedes the combination of open-ended and closed answer formats. The usage of the database management program Microsoft Access is widespread. It allows for various ways of entering quantitative data, of data management and data export. <b>The</b> <b>entry</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> material is convenient and almost unrestricted due to memo-format variables. Given the possibility to manage quantitative and qualitative data with the same computer software, we tried to use the programming properties of MS Access (Visual Basic with MS-Access-supplements) {{for the purpose of}} content analysis. The present paper comprises a description of the construction of data tables, queries, code lists and data entry forms. In addition, the construction of coding units (paraphrasing of text data), the coding process and the restructuring for subsequent statistical analysis is illustrated. In addition, the export of data into the statistical software package SPSS and the analysis of inter-coder reliability are discussed. This is based on the data collected from open-ended quality of life interviews with chronic schizophrenic persons and a paper-pencil assessment of patient satisfaction during a psychiatric hospital stay.

40|$|Speech {{and other}} recognition-based {{technologies}} offer {{the promise of}} a simple, natural, and readilyavailable way of interacting with the devices and systems around us. But recognition is a difficult task and errors are bound to occur. My research is about how to design user interfaces that are efficient, enjoyable, and accessible despite reliance on imperfect recognition. Let me expand on these goals with respect to one particular application that I have worked on extensively, <b>the</b> <b>entry</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> using speech recognition. Efficient – People can speak at 200 words per minute (wpm), but corrected text entry rates using speech recognition are much slower (typically 5 - 25 wpm). Software like Dragon NaturallySpeaking has used the same basic correction process for years. Using Dragon, the user must first notice an error has occurred, then select a text region containing the error, and finally choose an alternate from a list of choices {{that may or may not}} contain the correct text. I believe this process can be significantly streamlined by cleverly leveraging the probabilistic information available from both the recognizer and the user. Enjoyable – Users of speech recognition software are often dissatisfied and frequently give up using speech recognition. One cause for this is that the correction process can become very frustrating if, while trying to correct a recognition error, another recognition error occurs that requires additional effort to correct. Interfaces need fallback methods that provide a clear and consistent route to correction success...|$|E

40|$|Students {{still take}} class notes using {{pencil and paper}} [...] {{although}} digital documents are more legible, easier to search in and easier to edit [...] {{in part because of}} the lack of software to support note-taking. Class notes are characterized by free spatial organization, many small chunks <b>of</b> <b>text,</b> and a dense mix <b>of</b> <b>text</b> and graphic elements. These characteristics imply that a note-taking system should use pen, keyboard, and mouse-or-equivalent; allow <b>the</b> swift <b>entry</b> <b>of</b> <b>text</b> at any desired position; and minimize the need to switch between input tools. A system with these properties was built and used by 10 subjects in a controlled study and by 4 users in their classes.

40|$|This is {{a current}} {{print-out}} of {{results of a}} survey, undertaken {{in the spring of}} 1985, to identify those known binary stars which might produce significant gravitational wave amplitudes at earth, either dimensionless strain amplitudes exceeding a threshold h = 10 (exp - 21), or energy fluxes exceeding F = 10 (exp - 12) erg cm(exp - 2) s(exp - 1). All real or putative binaries brighter than a certain limiting magnitude (calculated as a function of primary spectral type, orbital period, orbital eccentricity, and bandpass) are included. All double degenerate binaries and Wolf-Rayet binaries with known or suspected orbital periods have also been included. The catalog consists of two parts: a listing of objects in ascending order of Right Ascension (Equinox B 1950), followed by an index, listing of objects by identification number according to all major stellar catalogs. The object listing is a print-out of the spreadsheets on which the catalog is currently maintained.

Greek characters are not available; they are represented here by the first two or three letters of their Roman names, the first letter appearing as a capital or lower-case letter according to whether the capital or lower-case Greek character is represented. Neither superscripts nor subscripts are available; they appear here in normal position and type-face.
