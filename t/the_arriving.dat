5|$|At 4:00a.m. on August 1, 1944 most trolleys, {{buses and}} subways in Philadelphia stopped running.

By noon of August 1 the entire PTC transportation system was paralyzed.|$|E
5|$|As allied {{intentions}} became clear, General Pigot {{decided to}} redeploy his {{forces in a}} defensive posture, withdrawing troops from Conanicut Island and from Butts Hill. He also decided to move nearly all livestock into the city, ordered the levelling of orchards to provide a clear line of fire, and destroyed carriages and wagons. <b>The</b> <b>arriving</b> French ships drove several of his supporting ships aground, which were then burned to prevent their capture. As the French worked {{their way up the}} channel toward Newport, Pigot ordered the remaining ships scuttled to hamper French access to Newport's harbour. On 8 August d'Estaing moved the bulk of his fleet into Newport Harbour.|$|E
30|$|During {{the update}} process, the first frame {{template}} and <b>the</b> newly <b>arrived</b> template are considered simultaneously. However, when {{the target is}} occluded, <b>the</b> <b>arrived</b> template usually cannot describe the real target effectively. Therefore, the weight μ of <b>the</b> <b>arrived</b> template should decrease at this time. Otherwise, the weight μ should increase due to the accurately estimate of <b>the</b> <b>arrived</b> template without other disturbance factors. In this paper, we set the parameter μ change with the reconstruction error. If On increases, which denotes the target may be disturbed by some factors, such as illumination and occlusion, <b>the</b> <b>arrived</b> template may be inaccurate, hence {{the weight of the}} template should decrease, while the weight of the first frame template should increase.|$|R

This document demonstrates how <b>the</b> <b>ARRIVE</b> guidelines {{can be used in}} practice to report animal research, by providing specific examples for each point of the guidelines.

30|$|An {{adaptive}} template update {{scheme is}} developed {{to adapt to}} the target appearance changes improving the robustness of the tracker. It is because the appearance of the target often changes significantly due to the disturbance of illumination changes, occlusion, rotation, and scale variation. When the target is occluded, <b>the</b> <b>arrived</b> template usually cannot describe the real target effectively. Therefore, the weight of <b>the</b> <b>arrived</b> template should decrease at this time. Otherwise, the weight should increase due to the accurately estimate of <b>the</b> <b>arrived</b> template without other disturbance factors.|$|R
5|$|As reviewers would note, the {{production}} {{was not without}} its faults. One error occurred with the photographer improperly taking pictures of the mermaid. The developed photographs of the mermaid were also impossible given the distances involved. A more minor error {{in the operation of}} the hotel was given by the office boy who handled <b>the</b> <b>arriving</b> guests with remarkable speed. Despite these errors, the company was {{at the forefront of the}} Independent producers and given great praise by Frank E. Woods of the American Biograph Company in The New York Dramatic Mirror.|$|E
5|$|At the {{entrance}} of the queue, ticket inspectors check passengers' tickets for Universal Studios. The queue then leads into a forested area which later leads into the Hogsmeade station building. Upon climbing a flight of steps, travellers reach the Hogsmeade station platform. Once <b>the</b> <b>arriving</b> passengers on the Hogwarts Express have left the platform, passengers waiting may then board the train and enter one of the twenty-one passenger compartments within the train.|$|E
5|$|German {{reaction}} to the second airborne landings involved mortar barrages and small arms fire, but casualties were negligible. Generalmajor Feuchtinger of 21st Panzer Division watched the gliders descending and, believing <b>the</b> <b>arriving</b> force would threaten his lines of communication, ordered those elements of the division that had reached the beaches to withdraw {{to the north of}} Caen. The gliders' arrival had inadvertently stopped the only German armoured attack on D-Day.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to module-specific equipment, Kvant-2, Kristall, Spektr and Priroda were each equipped with one Lyappa arm, a robotic arm which, after the module had docked {{to the core}} module's forward port, grappled one of two fixtures positioned on the core module's docking node. <b>The</b> <b>arriving</b> module's docking probe was then retracted, and the arm raised the module {{so that it could}} be pivoted 90° for docking to one of the four radial docking ports.|$|E
5|$|Operationally, {{the design}} of the cargo holds led to {{considerable}} difficulty for the ground crew, especially baggage handlers at the airports. The cargo hold had its doors located directly underneath the aircraft, so each item of baggage or cargo had to be loaded vertically upwards {{from the top of the}} baggage truck, then slid along the hold floor to be stacked inside. The individual pieces of luggage and cargo also had to be retrieved in a similarly slow manner at <b>the</b> <b>arriving</b> airport.|$|E
5|$|Despite these difficulties, the Channel Fleet was {{possessed of}} one of the best naval commanders of the age; its commander-in-chief, Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe, had learned his trade under Sir Edward Hawke and fought at the Battle of Quiberon Bay in 1759. In the spring of 1794, with the French convoy's arrival in European waters imminent, Howe had {{dispersed}} his fleet in three groups. George Montagu, in HMS Hector, was sent with six ships of the line and two frigates to guard British convoys to the East Indies, West Indies and Newfoundland as far as Cape Finisterre. Peter Rainier, in HMS Suffolk and commanding six other ships, was to escort the convoys {{for the rest of their}} passage. The third force consisted of 26 ships of the line, with several supporting vessels, under Howe's direct command. They were to patrol the Bay of Biscay for <b>the</b> <b>arriving</b> French.|$|E

5|$|Following their {{experiences}} with the Sitgreaves and Whipple expeditions, and encounters with Mormons and the soldiers at Fort Yuma, the Mohave were aware that whites were immigrating to the region in increasing numbers. It was difficult for the Mohave to predict the behavior of <b>the</b> <b>arriving</b> whites, some of whom, like Whipple, were amiably disposed towards them, whereas others such as the Mormons were hostile. The kwanami were divided on how the situation should be approached; some advocated an aggressive posture, denying whites all passage through their territory, but others, including Irataba, preferred a peaceful approach, or even an alliance with them that could put the Mohave in a stronger position relative to their traditional enemies the Paiute, Chemehuevi, and Walapai.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Murphy's distress call, a quick reaction force team assembles, boards two CH-47 Chinook helicopters, and {{heads toward the}} location without gunship escort seeking to extract the remaining members of the reconnaissance and surveillance team. During an attempt to insert <b>the</b> <b>arriving</b> forces, the Taliban insurgents shoot {{down one of the}} helicopters, killing eight Navy SEALs and eight Special Operations aviators who were on board. The second helicopter is forced to turn back. After witnessing the attack, Luttrell and a badly injured Axelson are left behind. Axelson attempts to find cover, but is killed when he leaves his hiding spot to attack several approaching insurgents. When Luttrell is discovered by the Taliban, one of the insurgents fires a rocket-propelled grenade, and its impact causes him to land {{at the bottom of a}} rock crevice where he is able to hide from the Taliban fighters.|$|E
5|$|On 23 March 1933, the Reichstag {{assembled}} at the Kroll Opera House under turbulent circumstances. Ranks of SA men {{served as}} guards inside the building, while large groups outside opposing the proposed legislation shouted slogans and threats towards <b>the</b> <b>arriving</b> members of parliament. The {{position of the}} Centre Party, the third largest party in the Reichstag, was decisive. After Hitler verbally promised party leader Ludwig Kaas that Hindenburg would retain his power of veto, Kaas announced the Centre Party would support the Enabling Act. The Act passed {{by a vote of}} 441–84, with all parties except the Social Democrats voting in favour. The Enabling Act, along with the Reichstag Fire Decree, transformed Hitler's government into a de facto legal dictatorship.|$|E

5|$|The VRS and JNA {{attacked}} {{north of}} Ston on 11 April, pushing back {{elements of the}} HV 115th Infantry Brigade and elements of <b>the</b> <b>arriving</b> HV Guards Brigades for only modest territorial gain. The frontline stabilized by 23 April and the HV counterattacked and reclaimed some ground after 27 April. On 17 May, Bobetko ordered a major attack of the two full guards brigades. The 1st Guards Brigade was tasked with advancing to link up with the Ston Company guarding access to the Pelješac Peninsula and advance to Slano. The 4th Guards Brigade was ordered to secure the hinterland of the Dubrovačko Primorje by advancing along {{the rim of the}} Popovo field. At the same time, the JNA was pressured by the international community to pull back east of Dubrovnik to Konavle.|$|E
5|$|The action {{came about}} as a direct {{consequence}} of the Battle of Grand Port three weeks earlier, in which a British squadron had been destroyed in a failed attack on Grand Port harbour on Isle de France. This gave the French forces on the island a significant regional advantage, outnumbering the British frigate on the recently captured Île Bourbon, commanded by Commodore Josias Rowley, by six to one. British reinforcements were hastily despatched to the area but the French were blockading Île Bourbon in force and <b>the</b> <b>arriving</b> reinforcements were in constant danger of attack by more powerful French units. Africaine was the first ship to reinforce Rowley's squadron, but within three days of her arrival in the region was engaged by two French ships while attempting to drive them away from Saint Denis on Île Bourbon. Corbet was severely wounded in the opening exchanges and subsequently died. Although his crew fought hard, they were overwhelmed by the French frigates and forced to surrender, only for Rowley to arrive in HMS Boadicea and drive off the French warships, recapturing Africaine.|$|E
5|$|The liner {{arrived at}} Haifa on March 31, {{nearly a week}} late. Herman Hirsch {{reported}} that a passenger from Chicago, Jacob Drapekin, 72, had died aboard the ship on March 24. The man's dying wish was {{to be buried in}} the Holy Land, and the crew of President Arthur helped fulfill his wishes. After arrival in Haifa, his flag-draped coffin was placed on deck and services were conducted in English and Hebrew by Rabbi Ashinsky before the body was taken ashore for interment. A sizable crowd, comprising delegations from Jerusalem, Jaffa, and Tel Aviv, greeted <b>the</b> <b>arriving</b> ship. Most of the passengers on President Arthur were hurried to Jerusalem for the Hebrew University dedication ceremony the next day.|$|E

5|$|The {{siege of}} Medina began in January 627 and lasted for 27 days. Since sieges were {{uncommon}} in Arabian warfare, <b>the</b> <b>arriving</b> confederates were unprepared {{to deal with}} the trenches dug by the Muslims. The Confederates tried to attack with horsemen in hopes of forcing a passage, but the Medinans were rigidly entrenched, preventing such a crossing. Both of the armies gathered {{on either side of the}} trench and spent two or three weeks exchanging insults in prose and verse, backed up with arrows fired from a comfortable distance. According to Rodinson, there were three dead among the attackers and five among the defenders. On the other hand, the harvest had been gathered and the besiegers had some trouble finding food for their horses, which proved of no use to them in the attack.|$|E
5|$|PTV {{becomes a}} huge success, and Brian and Stewie, {{impressed}} by the hits, join in to help Peter expand his television programming, as well as performing their own show Cheeky Bastard sitcom on PTV. Lois is furious about everyone's lust for perverted TV, as she is concerned {{over the issue of}} how children will be influenced by his programming (in the episode's DVD release, Peter and Cleveland, in a parody of Jackass, defecate on top of Lois' car). Brian then tells Lois that parents and legal guardians are the ones who should take full responsibility for what kids watch on TV and also points out that there are much worse influences besides TV. Regardless of that, Lois calls the FCC to have PTV shut down. This prompts Peter, Brian, and Stewie to perform an elaborate musical number about how insane the FCC's regulations are. Despite being impressed with the song, <b>the</b> <b>arriving</b> FCC representatives shut down PTV. When Peter tells the FCC representatives that while they can censor television they can't stop people from being who they are or how they live their lives, they decide to take on the challenge.|$|E
