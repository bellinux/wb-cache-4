50|$|The {{church was}} damaged in the 4 September 2010 Canterbury {{earthquake}} and the <b>tower</b> <b>braced</b> <b>with</b> an external steel structure; {{it was a}} much photographed item for its decoration with mannequins. Within two months, the restaurant was operating again. The building suffered further damage by the strong aftershock on Boxing Day of that year that was centred underneath the central city. Within two days, the restaurant opened again.|$|R

5000|$|When Ford {{introduced}} the newly modeled Mustang in 2015, {{it did not}} offer the California Special Edition package. However, a mere year later, Ford brought back the highly sought after package when it debuted the 2016 model. The 2016 Mustang GT/CS offers 435 hp stock with a 6-speed manual transmission. One of the signature additions to the GT/CS package are the Ebony Leather/Miko® Suede Seat Inserts with Red Contrast Stitching and Embossed Logo. Under the hood is a performance strut <b>tower</b> <b>brace</b> <b>with</b> the special [...] "California Special" [...] badge.|$|R
50|$|Restoration {{work was}} carried out in 1930 as part of the relocation. Further {{restoration}} {{was carried out}} as a community project, financed by local businesses, in 1978. More substantial renovation {{was carried out in}} 2003-2004, including earthquake strengthening. The middle section of the <b>tower</b> was <b>braced</b> <b>with</b> steel, and rods were inserted into the stonework. The renovation budget was NZ$295,000.|$|R

50|$|The {{forms for}} the walls {{consisted}} of <b>towers,</b> fronted <b>with</b> <b>braced</b> vertical sheets, 7.5 in thick, mounted on rails {{to allow the}} locks to be constructed in sections. A section of lock would be poured behind the form, {{and when it was}} set, the form would be moved to do the next section. Each of the twelve towers was 78 ft high by 36 ft wide. The forms for the culverts were made of steel and were collapsible so they could be removed and moved along after each section of culvert had set. In all, there were 33 forms for the centre and side-wall culverts, each 12 ft long, and 100 smaller forms for the lateral culverts.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis {{paper is}} devoted to {{computer}} modeling of composite structure the column base under question is contact interaction of bodies, which, when taken into account, allows to simulate the interaction of their constituent elements undergoing deformation. In modern <b>tower</b> buildings <b>with</b> <b>braced</b> framing, column structural design for compression is usually done taking into account random eccentricities. To attain a relatively uniform load transmission from a column to a foundation, the column base {{has to be made}} of high-strength metal. The required height of the column base can be composed of single individual plates, without reducing the design strength of metal. The strain state in contact zones and distribution patterns of contact pressure are extremely diverse. It depends on a number of factors affecting cohesion. That is why we considered the system of approximating models, which allows to find out to what extent their complication is necessary with the view to modern computers’ potential. We used design diagram with “soft” loading, which evaluates the upper bound of structure bearing capacity and the diagram with “stiff” loading, which evaluates the lower bound...|$|R
50|$|The ST165 chassis {{design was}} quite {{acclaimed}} in its time. Toyota {{chose not to}} make any drastic suspension changes for the AWD GT-Four.The front suspension comprises MacPherson struts with an anti-swaybar and strut <b>tower</b> <b>brace,</b> while the rear employs struts with a trailing link and twin lateral links per side plus an anti-swaybar.|$|R
2500|$|Not a trim level, the M-Theory edition was a 2007-only {{appearance}} {{package with}} an exclusive [...] "Speedway Blue" [...] color. For , a customer got 17-inch Caldina wheels, a chrome exhaust tip, a numbered plaque (1 of 2500), four wheel disc brakes, and a spoiler. To improve handling, a [...] "sport tuned suspension" [...] and strut <b>tower</b> <b>brace</b> were included.|$|R
2500|$|The Mustang GT {{gained the}} same non-powertrain related {{upgrades}} that standard V6 Mustangs got for 2011. Other, new features exclusive to the 2011 Mustang GT included [...] "5.0" [...] fender badges replacing the [...] "GT" [...] badges used previously, an optional Brembo Brake Package includes 14 inch Brembo front disk brakes {{taken from the}} Shelby GT500, unique 19-inch wheels with Pirelli P-Zero ultra high performance summer only tires, a unique calibration of the Advanced Track stability system including a [...] "sport" [...] mode, and suspension enhancements such as stiffer springs (less aggressive than the BOSS 302 and Shelby models but {{more so than the}} regular GT models) and various other suspension enhancements. Convertible versions of the Mustang GT in particular received a front strut <b>tower</b> <b>brace,</b> stiffened crossmembers, and other enhancements resulting in a 12% increase in structural rigidity compared to 2010 Mustang GT convertibles. All 2011 Mustang GT's with 19inch wheels (brembo brake equipped, California special, etc.) also received the strut <b>tower</b> <b>brace</b> and stiffened cross members.|$|R
50|$|The {{metallic}} look may not {{be desirable}} to some people, although transparent or lingual (behind-teeth) varieties are available. According to a survey published in the American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics, dental <b>braces</b> <b>with</b> no visible metal were considered the most attractive. Ceramic <b>braces</b> <b>with</b> thin metal or clear wires were a less desirable option, and <b>braces</b> <b>with</b> metal brackets and metal wires were rated as the least aesthetic combination.|$|R
50|$|To stiffen the chassis, a strut <b>tower</b> <b>brace</b> was {{installed}} {{to tie the}} cowl together, {{and a pair of}} V-braces (used on all 1983-1993 Mustang convertibles) attached in an X-pattern tied the subframes together. The Cobra R featured Eibach springs that were a bit too stiff for the street, but perfect on a racetrack. The Cobra R also benefitted from the adjustable Koni shocks and struts, helping to cement the car's reputation as a serious driving machine.|$|R
5000|$|Shear {{legs are}} a lifting device {{related to the}} gin pole, derrick and tripod (lifting device). Shears are an A-frame {{of any kind of}} {{material}} such as timbers or metal, the feet resting on or in the ground or on a solid surface which will not let them move and the top held in place <b>with</b> <b>guy-wires</b> or guy ropes simply called [...] "guys". Shear legs only need two guys whereas a gin pole needs at least three. The U. S. Army Field Manual FM 5-125 gives detailed instruction on how to rig shears.|$|R
2500|$|Ford Racing Performance Group {{provided}} Shelby its FR1 Power Pack to add 25 horsepower to {{the existing}} Mustang GT powertrain with an additional 10ft/lb of torque.

50|$|Skull <b>Tower</b> (<b>Braće</b> Tasković bb), {{the name}} of the tower is not a metaphor. This is {{actually}} a tower made of skulls, about 3 meters tall, which was built by the Turks on the order of Khurshid Pasha.
