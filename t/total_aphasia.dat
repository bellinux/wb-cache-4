40|$|The {{cerebral}} pathological findings {{obtained in}} 4 cases of <b>total</b> <b>aphasia</b> have been presented. Of these, Case 1 {{is considered to}} have a lesion in the right anterior cerebral artery area, which gave rise to severe <b>total</b> <b>aphasia</b> alone without such concurrent manifestations as agnosia, apraxia, diaturbance of intelligence or neurological symptoms or signs, Cerebrovascular disturbance of syphilitic originm especially a lesion in the frontal lobes was suspected in Case 2, where aphasia concurred with aprazia. In Case 3 with a previous history of injury to the head, there was Wallenberg's syndrome with evidence suggestive of aneurysma at {{the origin of the}} right anterior cerebral artery. This case, in which aphasic symptoms were outstanding, is of interest in view of the relationship between language disturbances and the nuslei in the brain stem. Case 4, right-handed patient with aphasia due to a lesion in the right median verebral artery, is also of signilicance in dealing with the problem of predminance of cerebral function...|$|E
40|$|Cerebral {{blood flow}} (133 xenon {{inhalation}} method) {{has been studied}} in 30 aphasic stroke patients at 15, 30, 60 and 90 days after onset. In <b>total</b> <b>aphasia</b> the CBF values are low and the regional hypoperfused areas are extensive. In Broca's, Wernicke's and nominal aphasias, resting CBF measurements do not provide the clinician with useful additional information and clinical improvement can by no means {{be attributed to a}} resting CBF rise during the observation period.

40|$|A 62 year old, right handed man {{developed}} a pure agraphia {{as the result}} of a left temporal lobe stroke. Isolated writing disturbances persisted for seven months until he had a second cerebrovascular accident resulting in <b>total</b> <b>aphasia</b> and right hemiplegia. A CAT scan obtained four months after the first episode showed a localised dilatation of the posterior portion of the left Sylvian cistern and patchy areas of low absorption in the left temporal lobe. The report supports suggestions that localised damage to the language area can produce a pure agraphia as the sole detectable disorder of language organisation...|$|E
40|$|The {{extent of}} {{recovery}} from aphasia following ischemic stroke has been evaluated by a quantitative method. The greatest improvement was observed {{during the first}} 3 months following onset. The rate of recovery was similar for expression and for comprehension, but comprehension was usually less disturbed than expression. Final prognosis depends {{on the type of}} aphasia (the poorest prognosis was found for <b>total</b> or global <b>aphasia)</b> and on the severity of the initial insult.

40|$|A 36 -year-old female with {{a history}} of {{recurrent}} pregnancy loss experienced sudden onset of disturbance in consciousness, with right hemiparesis and <b>total</b> <b>aphasia.</b> Computed tomography revealed a massive hemorrhage in the left frontal lobe, and angiography showed occlusion of the anterior two-thirds of the superior sagittal sinus. Laboratory investigations detected the presence of lupus anticoagulant, elevation of the anticardiolipin β_ 2 -glycoprotein I complex antibody level, and a decreased protein S activity level. There were no underlying conditions, such as connective tissue disorders, malignancies, infectious diseases, and drug-induced disorders, so the diagnosis was primary antiphospholipid syndrome. Primary antiphospholipid syndrome should be considered in the evaluation of patients with "idiopathic" or "primary" sinus and cerebral venous thrombosis...|$|E
30|$|An 80 -year-old Japanese {{man with}} no other {{underlying}} disease was diagnosed with unresectable advanced lung cancer (stage IV) without brain metastasis and {{had not yet been}} treated. The patient suddenly presented with disturbance of consciousness, right hemiplegia, and <b>total</b> <b>aphasia,</b> and was admitted to our hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed acute cerebral infarction extending from the basal ganglia to the corona radiata of the left cerebrum and multiple small areas of bilateral cerebral cortices. Cardiogenic cerebral embolism was considered among the differential diagnoses, but the brain natriuretic peptide level was within the normal range, and no arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation were observed. With no other causes, the patient was diagnosed with Trousseau syndrome due to hypercoagulability associated with the advanced lung cancer. The patient received intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) at 96  minutes after onset of symptoms. His symptoms partially improved, but they suddenly deteriorated at 84  minutes after the thrombolysis. A computed tomography (CT) scan immediately after the neurological deterioration revealed a subcortical hemorrhage in the left occipital lobe. A repeat CT scan the day after onset showed enlargement of the left occipital hemorrhage and two new subcortical hemorrhages in the right frontal and right temporal lobes. These hemorrhages were located in areas remote from the acute ischemic lesions.|$|E
40|$|When {{a patient}} has {{suffered}} a severe stroke, inves-tigations and treatments should be terminated when they no longer are useful. This statement, simple as it may seem, has many intricate ethical implications that are discussed in this article. As consulting physicians caring for strokepatients, we often encounter patients forwhom {{it is difficult to}} determine what investigations, treatments, and basic life support measures should be instituted and what measures should be withheld. When are investigations and treatments no longer useful? How certain can we be in determining the prognosis of an individual patient? Is there any outcome other than early death that is so grave that life support may be withheld or withdrawn? These are some of the questions we address in this article. A brief case history serves as a focus for our discussion. Case History A married man born in 1911 had polio at the age of 30 years. He was left with a slight-to-moderate weakness of his right leg. He also had hypertension and non-insulin-dependent diabetes. He was admitted to the stroke unit of Umea University Hospital on January 9, 1988, because of the sudden onset of <b>total</b> <b>aphasia</b> and the inability to rise from bed. On admission, he had a flaccid paresis in his right arm and leg and was stuporous and unable to take any liquid by mouth. His condi-tion remained essentially unchanged and his level of consciousness fluctuated between stupor and som-nolence until his death on April 5, 1988. His wife visited him once or twice a week during the first month, then less frequently. She found the visits to be traumatic. In Sweden, the attending physician has the formal responsibility for decisions on life support if the patient is incompetent. The patient's wife was therefore not part of the formal decision-making process. However, when she was asked to express an opinion, she declined to take...|$|E
40|$|The dynamic {{follow up}} of aphasic {{disorders}} {{in patients with}} acute ischemic stroke is of great importance because of its prognostic value for their future recovery. The purpose of that clinical study is to compare the type of aphasia with the CT data about the infarction localization and to evaluate the prospective aphasia recovery. In the clinical study were included 37 patients with ischemic stroke and aphasia, theated in II-nd Neurology Clinic, Medical University Pleven. The diagnosis ischemic stroke was confirmed by clinical and CT investigations. Partial and full recovery of sensory aphasia was registered in all the patients with <b>total</b> <b>aphasia,</b> while motor aphasia showed little tendency of reduction in acute ischemic stroke. Aphasic disorders were more severe in cases with ischemic infarctions localized in the specific anatomical regions responsible for the speech function. The dynamic follow up of aphasic disorders has prognostic value for the speech recovery. Better prognosis show sensory and amnestic aphasia. Lesion localization also influences the prognosis. Key words: ischemic infarction, aphasia, prognosis The dynamic follow up of aphasic disorders in patients with acute ischemic stroke is very important because of its prognostic value for their future recovery. The purpose of that clinical study is to compare the type of aphasia and its severity in the acute stage of ischem-ic stroke with the CT data about the infarction localization and to evaluate the prospective aphasia recovery. MATERIAL AND METHODS 37 patients with ischemic stroke and aphasia were in-cluded in the clinical study (23 males and 14 females) from 52 to 88 years old, treated in II-nd Neurologic Clinic, Uni-versity Hospital Pleven for the period from September 2003 till June 2004. The patients were admitted on the 1 st- 3 rd day of the onset and were treated till the 14 -th- 18 -th day. The diagno-sis ischemic stroke was confirmed by clinical and CT exam-ination...|$|E
