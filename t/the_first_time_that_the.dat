5|$|In {{the decades}} after Otto Jesse's death in 1901, {{there were few}} new {{insights}} into the nature of noctilucent clouds. Wegener's conjecture, that they were composed of water ice, was later shown to be correct. Study was limited to ground-based observations and scientists had very little knowledge of the mesosphere until the 1960s, when direct rocket measurements began. These showed for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> occurrence of the clouds coincided with very low temperatures in the mesosphere.|$|E
