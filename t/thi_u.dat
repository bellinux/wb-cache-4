50|$|On 12 June 1886, the British {{started an}} attack near U Ottama’s {{position}} at Salin. U Ottama’s men killed Captain Dunsford and then besieging the British forces at Salin. The siege {{was broken by}} a relieving British force but only after the Burmese had killed its commander again, Captain Atkinson. Riding on his success, U Ottama reconsolidated his forces in the Minbu region. He then assumed the title of Mingyi and appointed five lieutenants - Bo Yaw Baw, Bo Kan <b>Thi,</b> <b>U</b> Ottara, Bo Kin and Bo Byaing Gyi - to take over villages under his domain. Theirs was a successful stronghold with the British {{not being able to}} make any progress infiltrating without U Ottama knowing their movements well in advance. The British then resorted to means of persuading and even buying over U Ottama’s followers, at the same time imposing severe penalties for those villagers who aided or abetted the resistance leaders. Gradually, these tactics succeeded and 1,204 of U Ottama’s men surrendered to the British. U Ottama himself was finally captured by the British near Legaing in June 1889.|$|E
