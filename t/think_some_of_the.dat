It's quite dense and I <b>think</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decisions we made don't always go in the most obvious direction. We were thinking {{a lot more about}} what we'd want to play when we were up onstage rather than actually what you'd want to hear on a record." [...] He then questioned the future of the band, saying, [...] "I {{think a lot of the}} record is about us trying to make decisions about how long the band should go on. When I listened back to it, I realized how many songs are about something coming to a close, or knowing when it's time to put something away and move on." ...|$|E

Esposito was the only player on either team to score four points in a game during the series. According to Ron Ellis, he had [...] "never seen another player have a period where {{there was so much}} {{pressure}} and was still able to accomplish what he did." [...] Sinden considered it to be Esposito's [...] "finest hour." [...] Esposito describes it as [...] "there was no stopping me. And I <b>think</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guys got a little angry with me. If we had lost, I would have been the goat. But we didn't lose. I just had enough faith in myself, that I was going to get it done, one way or another." ...|$|E

"Part of Your World" [...] {{continues}} to be covered extensively by various recording artists and musicians, leading some critics {{to believe that it}} is one of the most covered Disney songs in recent memory. Although Benson has never been overprotective of the song, she admitted [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> covers were not necessarily what I think Howard would have liked", particularly [...] "dance versions" [...] of the ballad. In 1996, singer Faith Hill recorded a cover of [...] "Part of Your World" [...] for the country music compilation album The Best of Country Sing the Best of Disney.

Players are required to achieve five [...] "Excellent" [...] combos while playing [...] "Part of Your World" [...] in order to advance to the next level. Singer and actress Miley Cyrus recorded a pop rock version of the song for the compilation album Disneymania 5 (2007).

In 2012, recording artist Bruno Mars performed [...] "Part of Your World" [...] live in concert at BBC's Live Lounge. Mars introduced the ballad as [...] "the best song ever written", claiming that he has always struggled to sing it without crying. Lyrically, Mars changed Ariel's amount of thingamabobs owned from 20 to 30. Video footage of Mars' performance became very popular on the Internet, which Sally Mercedes of Latina opined [...] "made us love him even more". German opera singer Diana Damrau covered [...] "Part of Your World" [...] in her native language ("Ein Mensch zu sein") for her album Forever (2013). Writing for Opera News, Judith Malafronte dismissed Damrau's rendition as one of the album's [...] "near-misses", accusing her of sounding too [...] "syrupy" [...] and [...] "brassy" [...] on the track. However, Gramophones Adrian Edwards enjoyed Jason Carr's musical arrangement.|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{its release}} Brian Lane noted that fans either seem {{to love the}} album or [...] "fucking hate it".

2500|$|Keane caused {{controversy}} in November 2000, when he criticised sections of United supporters after the Champions League victory over Dynamo Kyiv at Old Trafford. He {{complained about the}} lack of vocal support given by some fans when Dynamo were dominating the game, stating, [...] "Away from home our fans are fantastic, I'd call them the hardcore fans. But at home they have a few drinks and probably the prawn sandwiches, and they don't realise what's going on out on the pitch. I don't <b>think</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people who come to Old Trafford can spell 'football', never mind understand it." [...] Keane's comments started a debate in England about the changing atmosphere in football grounds, and the term [...] "prawn sandwich brigade" [...] is now part of the English football vocabulary, referring to people who attend football games or claim to be fans of football because it is fashionable rather than due to any genuine interest in the game.|$|E
