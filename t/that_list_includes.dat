5000|$|Further {{details about}} the school's history {{are to be found}} on the Old Edwardians website (see {{references}} below, Archive). This comprehensive site includes about 1150 relevant articles and photographs, with documents such as School magazines, Speechday Leaflets and official form photographs, plus a list of approximately 400 Old Edwardians. <b>That</b> <b>list</b> <b>includes</b> many in the [...] "golden era" [...] of admissions during the Clapton era, especially 1952-59, not included in the less widely based Alumni list below, and concentrates on those it has been possible to trace of significant achievement after they left the school. Surprisingly, the school itself maintains no such records. The OE list reveals that a noteworthy proportion of Old Edwardians went on to become professors at universities around the world. Remarkably, there were substantially more Old Edwardian British ambassadors than Old Edwardian members of parliament. The school's historian has picked up on the fact that in 2000, the British ambassadors to Ukraine, Colombia and NATO were all Old Edwardians; all three of them had been 'soldiers' in a school performance of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar in March 1956. As befits an industrial and engineering city such as Sheffield, the school also produced more than its fair share of prominent industrialists and world-class engineers.|$|E
