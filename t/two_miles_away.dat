5|$|In October 1952, Chinese forces {{conducted}} a large offensive against IX Corps' sector, against the hilly countryside around the Iron Triangle region of Chorwon, Kumhwa, and Pyongyang. The 38th CPV Field Army sent heavy assaults against the South Korean forces guarding Hill 395 in the Battle of White Horse. At the same time, Chinese forces attacked Arrowhead Hill, {{which was held}} by the 2nd Infantry Division <b>two</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away.</b> Both hills changed hands several times, but after two weeks and almost 10,000 casualties, the Chinese were unsuccessful in capturing either objective and withdrew.|$|E
5|$|Many navvies {{had been}} farm labourers from the Yorkshire Dales, North East England and the Fens, or {{had come for}} work from Scotland and Ireland. Drunkenness and {{fighting}} was such that Jos Midgeley, a railway police inspector, was hired for £1.25 per week to keep order. At one time he was attacked {{by a group of}} men, and at Wescoe Hill, <b>two</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> {{on the opposite side of}} the River Wharfe, a riot occurred when the contractors tried to cut off the beer supply to keep the men sober enough to work.|$|E
5|$|As {{the date}} approaches, Sir Gawain sets {{off to find}} the Green Chapel and keep {{his side of the}} bargain. Many adventures and battles are alluded to (but not described) until Gawain comes across a splendid castle where he meets Bertilak de Hautdesert, the lord of the castle, and his {{beautiful}} wife, who are pleased to have such a renowned guest. Also present is an old and ugly lady, unnamed but treated with great honour by all. Gawain tells them of his New Year's appointment at the Green Chapel and that he only has a few days remaining. Bertilak laughs, explains that the Green Chapel is less than <b>two</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> and proposes that Gawain rest at the castle till then. Relieved and grateful, Gawain agrees.|$|E

5|$|Sheffield Hallam University (SHU) is a {{university}} on two sites in Sheffield. City Campus {{is located in}} the city centre, close to Sheffield railway station, and Collegiate Crescent Campus is about <b>two</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away,</b> adjacent to Ecclesall Road in south-west Sheffield. The university is the third largest in the UK, with more than 37,000 students (of whom over 4,000 are international students), 4,170 staff and 747 courses. Sheffield Hallam University's history goes back to 1843 with the establishment of the Sheffield School of Design. During the 1960s several independent colleges (including the School of Design) joined to become Sheffield Polytechnic (Sheffield City Polytechnic from 1976) and was finally renamed Sheffield Hallam University in 1992.|$|E
5|$|The {{approaching}} Turkish forces convinced Chetwode to {{call off}} the attack. But at 16:30, as the other brigades were retiring, the New Zealanders charged and captured their objective. This allowed them to bring enfilade fire onto {{the rest of the}} position. The rest of the division then resumed the attack and captured the village. By now the Turkish relief force was about <b>two</b> <b>miles</b> <b>away</b> to the north-east. By 17:15 all the wounded had been evacuated and the covering patrols recalled. As there were no water supplies at Rafa, at 18:30 the brigade was ordered to withdraw back to Sheikh Zowaiid. Although not as heavily involved in the battle as other units, the regiment still had twelve men dead and eighteen wounded.|$|E
5|$|The chicks {{take from}} 34 to 50 days to fledge, the period {{depending}} on the abundance of their food supply. In years of fish shortage, the whole colony may experience a longer fledgling period but the normal range is 38 to 44 days, by which time chicks will have reached about 75% of their mature body weight. The chick may come to the burrow entrance to defecate but does not usually emerge into the open and seems to have an aversion to light until it is nearly fully fledged. Although the supply of fish by the adults reduces {{over the last few}} days spent in the nest, the chick is not abandoned as happens in the Manx shearwater. On occasions, an adult has been observed provisioning a nest even after the chick has departed. During the last few days underground, the chick sheds its down and the juvenile plumage is revealed. Its relatively small beak and its legs and feet are a dark colour and it lacks the white facial patches of the adult. The chick finally leaves its nest at night, when the risk of predation is at its lowest. When the moment arrives, it emerges from the burrow, usually for the first time, and walks, runs and flaps its way to the sea. It cannot fly properly yet so descending a cliff is perilous; when it reaches the water it paddles out to sea, and may be three kilometres (<b>two</b> <b>miles)</b> <b>away</b> from the shore by daybreak. It does not congregate with others of its kind and will not return to land for two or three years.|$|E

25|$|What is {{consistent}} {{in the stories}} of Lowe are accounts of his insatiable appetite for learning.
