5|$|Many beetles have {{beautiful}} and durable elytra {{that have been}} used as material in arts, with beetlewing <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>example.</b> Sometimes, they are incorporated into ritual objects for their religious significance. Whole beetles, either as-is or encased in clear plastic, are made into objects ranging from cheap souvenirs such as key chains to expensive fine-art jewellery. In parts of Mexico, beetles of the genus Zopherus are made into living brooches by attaching costume jewelry and golden chains, which is made possible by the incredibly hard elytra and sedentary habits of the genus.|$|E
5|$|Mobile's French and Spanish colonial {{history has}} {{given it a}} culture {{distinguished}} by French, Spanish, Creole, African and Catholic heritage, in addition to later British and American influences. It is distinguished from all other cities {{in the state of}} Alabama. The annual Carnival celebration is perhaps <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>example</b> of its differences. Mobile is the birthplace of the celebration of Mardi Gras in the United States and has the oldest celebration, dating to the early 18th century during the French colonial period.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} are a group (column) in the {{periodic}} table consisting of the chemical elements lithium (Li), sodium (Na), potassium (K), rubidium (Rb), caesium (Cs), and francium (Fr). This group lies in the s-block of {{the periodic table}} of elements as all alkali metals have their outermost electron in an s-orbital: this shared electron configuration results in them having very similar characteristic properties. Indeed, the alkali metals provide <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>example</b> of group trends in properties in the periodic table, with elements exhibiting well-characterised homologous behaviour.|$|E

5|$|Although little {{evidence}} of settlements {{has been found in}} the Rhondda that date between the Neolithic and Bronze Age periods, several cairns and cists have been discovered throughout the length of both valleys. <b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>example</b> of a round-cairn was found at Crug yr Afan, near the summit of Graig Fawr, west of Cwmparc. The cairn consisted of an earthen mound with a surrounding ditch 28 metres in circumference and over 2 metres tall. Although most cairns discovered in the area are round, a ring cairn or cairn circle exists on Gelli Mountain. Known as the 'Rhondda Stonehenge' the cairn consists of 10 upright stones no more than 60cm in height encircling a central cist. All the cairns found within the Rhondda are located on high ground, many on ridgeways, and may have been used as waypoints.|$|E
5|$|However, Shakespeare {{soon began}} to adapt the {{traditional}} styles to his own purposes. The opening soliloquy of Richard III {{has its roots in}} the self-declaration of Vice in medieval drama. At the same time, Richard's vivid self-awareness looks forward to the soliloquies of Shakespeare's mature plays. No single play marks a change from the traditional to the freer style. Shakespeare combined the two throughout his career, with Romeo and Juliet perhaps <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>example</b> of the mixing of the styles. By the time of Romeo and Juliet, Richard II, and A Midsummer Night's Dream in the mid-1590s, Shakespeare had begun to write a more natural poetry. He increasingly tuned his metaphors and images to the needs of the drama itself.|$|E
5|$|In 1826 {{an ornate}} range was erected by St Mary Hall in the Gothic Revival style, {{incorporating}} the old gate of St Mary Hall, {{on the west}} side of the quad. Designed by Daniel Robertson, it contains two quite ornate oriels placed asymmetrically, one is of six lights, the other four. They are <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>example</b> of the pre-archaeological Gothic in Oxford. The large oriel on the first floor at the north end was once the drawing room window of the Principal of the Hall. Parts of the street wall incorporated into this range show traces of blocked windows dating from the same period of rebuilding in the 15th century as the present-day staircase ten.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, Dodson raised two {{objections}} to Horner's hypothesis. Firstly, {{the possession of}} just one pair of main spikes seemed more basal than the presence of three pairs, as with Styracosaurus albertensis. This suggested {{to him that the}} Einiosaurus-Achelousaurus lineage was a separate branch within the Centrosaurinae. Secondly, he was concerned that Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus were a case of sexual dimorphism, one type being the males, the other the females. This would be suggested by the short geological time interval between the layers their fossils had been found in, which was estimated by him at about 250,000 years. But if the hypothesis were true, it would be perhaps <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>example</b> of fast evolution in the Dinosauria.|$|E
5|$|In the 14th {{century the}} kings {{continued}} to build vesara or Deccan-style monuments but later incorporated Dravida-style gopuras {{to meet their}} ritualistic needs. The Prasanna Virupaksha temple (underground temple) of Bukka and the Hazare Rama temple of Deva Raya are examples of Deccan architecture. The varied and intricate ornamentation of the pillars is a mark of their work. At Hampi, though the Vitthala temple is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>example</b> of their pillared Kalyanamantapa style, the Hazara Ramaswamy temple is a modest but perfectly finished example. A visible aspect of their style is their return to the simplistic and serene art developed by the Chalukya dynasty. A grand specimen of Vijayanagara art, the Vitthala temple, took several decades to complete {{during the reign of}} the Tuluva kings.|$|E
5|$|Nettlecombe Park blends into woodlands, {{with the}} house serving as the Leonard Wills Field Centre for field {{scientists}} who wish to study the surrounding natural environment, which is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>example</b> {{of this type of}} ecosystem remaining in England. Today, nearby hills and woodlands, including Exmoor National Park, have provided opportunities for general scientific introductory field courses on environmental themes and botany. Habitats include marine, freshwater and heather moorland and the surrounding settlements range from hamlets to villages to the country town of Taunton. An archaeological excavation {{on the edge of the}} property, near the sea coast, has revealed the remains of Danish Vikings who were defeated there circa 900.|$|E

5|$|As Khalid was the {{architect}} {{of most of the}} early Muslim military doctrines, he was also the pioneer of almost every major tactic that Muslims used during Early Islamic conquests. One of Khalid's major achievements in this context was utilizing the individual skills of Arab Bedouin warriors to a larger scale. He is believed to have developed them into an almost regular unit called Mubarizun ("champions"), who would issue personal challenges to the enemy officers. These were highly trained and skilled swordsmen, whom Khalid utilized effectively to slay as many enemy officers as possible, giving a psychological blow to enemy morale. The Battle of Ajnadayn is perhaps <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>example</b> of this form of psychological warfare. Moreover, his biggest achievement was the conversion of Arab tactical doctrine into a strategic system. Until Khalid, the Arabs were basically raiders and skirmishers. Khalid turned those skirmishing tactics into something that could be used anywhere. Thus he would skirmish the enemy to death: he would bring his army in front of his enemies and wait until the whole battle degenerated into a skirmishing affair between small units. Then, after exhausting the enemy units, he would launch his cavalry at their flanks employing Hammer and Anvil tactics.|$|E
