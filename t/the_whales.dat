5|$|Taylor learns <b>the</b> <b>whales</b> {{have been}} {{released}} early, and goes to Kirk for assistance. Taylor, Kirk, and McCoy rescue Chekov {{and return to the}} now recharged Bird of Prey. After transporting <b>the</b> <b>whales</b> aboard the ship, the crew returns with Taylor to their own time. On approaching Earth, the ship loses power and comes down in San Francisco Bay. Once released, <b>the</b> <b>whales</b> respond to the probe's signal, causing the object to reverse its effects on Earth and return to the depths of space. All charges against the Enterprise crew are dropped, save one for insubordination: for disobeying a superior officer, Kirk is demoted from Admiral back to the rank of Captain where he is returned to command of a starship. The crew departs on their ship, the newly christened USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-A), and leaves on a new mission.|$|E
5|$|Whales in the Great Salt Lake: Local legend {{maintains}} that in 1875, entrepreneur James Wickham had two whales {{released into the}} Great Salt Lake, {{with the intent of}} using them as a tourist attraction. <b>The</b> <b>whales</b> are said to have disappeared into the lake and subsequently sighted multiple times over a number of months, but there have never been any confirmed sightings of <b>the</b> <b>whales</b> since the time of their supposed release.|$|E
5|$|Captive whales have {{occasionally}} {{been known}} to mimic human speech. Scientists have suggested this indicates a strong desire on behalf of <b>the</b> <b>whales</b> to communicate with humans, as whales {{have a very different}} vocal mechanism, so imitating human speech likely takes considerable effort.|$|E

5|$|Much of the Cetacean Institute, Taylor's workplace, {{was created}} by using the real-life Monterey Bay Aquarium. A holding tank for <b>the</b> <b>whales</b> was added via special effects to the Aquarium's exterior. For close-ups of the {{characters}} as they watched <b>the</b> <b>whales</b> in the tank, the Aquarium's walls and railings were measured and replicated for a set on the Paramount parking lot. One scene takes place by a large glass through which observers view the whales—and Spock's initiation of a mind meld—underwater. Footage of the actors shot {{in front of them}} as they reacted to a brick wall in the Aquarium was combined with shots taken from their rear as they stood in front of a large blue screen at ILM to produce this scene. The footage of Spock's melding with <b>the</b> <b>whales</b> was shot weeks later in a large water tank used to train astronauts for weightlessness.|$|E
5|$|The hunt of {{the pilot}} whale is known by the locals as the Grindadráp. There are no fixed hunting seasons. As soon as a pod close enough to land is spotted, the locals set out to begin the hunt, after {{approval}} from the sysselman. The animals are driven into a bay which is approved for whaling by the Faroese government, and then {{they try to make}} <b>the</b> <b>whales</b> to beach themselves. The only way out is being blocked off by some of the boats, which stay there until men who have been waiting on shore have slaughtered all <b>the</b> <b>whales.</b>|$|E

50|$|Leela becomes {{obsessed with}} killing <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> to take revenge for eating the statue and delaying {{their return to}} Earth {{in time for the}} memorial, and grows {{increasingly}} insane with each failed effort. <b>The</b> <b>whale</b> eventually devours <b>the</b> Planet Express ship and swallows the crew alive (with the exception of Zoidberg, who again returns to Earth in an escape pod). Inside <b>the</b> <b>whale,</b> Leela encounters <b>the</b> captain of the first crew, Lando Tucker, fused to the inside of <b>the</b> <b>whale's</b> belly. Lando explains that <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> feeds on obsession, luring obsessive space captains into the Tetrahedron to feed itself. Leela is fused to <b>the</b> <b>whale's</b> belly like Lando, but her overwhelming obsession with completing her delivery grants her control over <b>the</b> <b>whale,</b> allowing her to bring it to the Planet Express building in time for the memorial. She forces <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> to release everyone and everything it has swallowed, including the statue and the first crew. Despite acknowledging that <b>the</b> space <b>whale</b> is not a monster, as it merely follows its instinct, everyone proceeds to kill <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> out of revenge for swallowing them.|$|R

5|$|Vocalizations made {{by right}} whales are not {{elaborate}} {{compared to those}} made by other whale species. <b>The</b> <b>whales</b> make groans, pops and belches typically at frequencies around 500Hz. The purpose of the sounds is not known but may {{be a form of}} communication between whales within the same group. Northern right whales responded to sounds similar to police sirens—sounds of much higher frequency than their own. On hearing the sounds, they moved rapidly to the surface. The research was of particular interest because northern rights ignore most sounds, including those of approaching boats. Researchers speculate this information may be useful in attempts {{to reduce the number of}} ship-whale collisions or to encourage <b>the</b> <b>whales</b> to surface for ease of harvesting.|$|E
5|$|In Brazil, Imbituba in Santa Catarina {{has been}} {{recognized}} as the National Right Whale Capital and holds annual Right Whale Week celebrations in September when mothers and calves are more often seen.

5|$|Scientists {{are unsure}} {{of the purpose of}} whale songs. Only males sing, {{suggesting}} one purpose is to attract females. However, many of <b>the</b> <b>whales</b> observed to approach a singer are other males, often resulting in conflict. Singing may, therefore, be a challenge to other males. Some scientists have hypothesized the song may serve an echolocative function. During the feeding season, humpbacks make unrelated vocalizations for herding fish into their bubble nets.|$|E

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> shark Rhiniodon typus Smith {{is considered a}} rarity and hence, most of the publications on <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> shark are restricted to its stranding, incidental catch and length measurements. Compagno (1984) reported that commercial harvesting of <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> shark is practically non-existent. However, Rao (1986) observed existence of a small harpoon fishery for <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> shark in Veraval (Saurashtra coast). Recently, {{there has been a}} remarkable increase in effort as well as catch. There are no records to indicate a directed fishery for <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> shark elsewhere in the world.

5|$|The filmmakers {{knew from}} the {{beginning}} of production that <b>the</b> <b>whales</b> were their biggest effects concern; Dow recalled that they were prepared to change to another animal in case creating <b>the</b> <b>whales</b> proved too difficult. When Humphrey the Whale wandered into the San Francisco Bay, Dow and his camera crew attempted to gather usable footage of the humpback but failed to do so. Other footage of real humpbacks either did not exist on 35mm film or would have been difficult to match to specific actions required by the script. Compositing miniatures shot against bluescreen on top of water backgrounds would not have provided realistic play of light. Creating full-size mechanical whales on tracks would severely limit the types of angles and shots. To solve the whale problem, Rodis hired robotics expert Walt Conti. While Conti was not experienced in film, Rodis believed his background in engineering and design made him well-equipped for Rodis' planned solution: the creation of independent and self-contained miniature whale models.|$|E

50|$|Whale Caller and Sharisha: As {{the protagonists}} of <b>the</b> novel, <b>the</b> <b>Whale</b> Caller is {{characterized}} as {{somewhat of a}} loner who awaits the return of <b>the</b> <b>whale,</b> Sharisha. For a few years now, <b>the</b> <b>Whale</b> Caller has developed an unexpected relationship with Sharisha, as he {{is in love with}} a <b>whale.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Whale</b> Caller is able to express his love for Sharisha by playing his kelp horn, which causes Sharisha to swim around the shoreline, making <b>the</b> <b>Whale</b> Caller content. <b>The</b> <b>Whale</b> Caller is aroused by Sharisha’s reaction to the kelp horn, and considers Sharisha to be an intimate partner. This strains his relationship with Saluni who struggles to create intimacy with <b>the</b> <b>Whale</b> Caller since he is preoccupied with Sharisha. Ultimately though, <b>the</b> <b>Whale</b> Caller remains faithful to Sharisha and appeasing Saluni, until their deaths {{at the end of the}} novel. Saluni: Classified as the ‘village drunk,’ Saluni always seems to lurk around town seeking <b>the</b> <b>Whale</b> Caller’s attention. She constantly references the fact that she is a ‘love child’ and therefore deserves the affection and admiration she was denied of as a child. Saluni however is forced to compete for <b>the</b> <b>Whale</b> Caller’s love with <b>the</b> <b>whale,</b> Sharisha. Saluni is able to create intimate moments with <b>the</b> <b>Whale</b> Caller, and in an attempt to fully capture <b>the</b> <b>Whale</b> Caller’s heart, she constantly confronts Sharisha, asking <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> to die or leave <b>the</b> <b>Whale</b> Caller. While never successful, she seeks affection from the Bored Twins on her semi-regular visits to their home. At the end of the novel though, Saluni is tragically murdered by the Bored Twins, whom she had tended to throughout the novel. Bored Twins: Feral twins who are the daughters of two farm laborers’. Given their mental state, Saluni visits them during the day while their parents are in the fields. The Bored Twins have beautiful singing voices, which comfort Saluni during her times of depression. Saluni tries to record the twins’ voices for a recording company, but their mother is afraid that their voices will be stolen, forcing the twins to distance themselves from Saluni. At the end of the novel, as Saluni is leaving the twins’ house, they try to stop her by throwing rocks at her head, but they take it too far and accidentally kill her. Mda foreshadows Saluni’s death earlier in the novel when the twins would torture frogs and snakes, preparing the reader for the psychopathology of the murder. Mr. Yodd: Dwells in a grotto with rock rabbits. Throughout <b>the</b> novel, <b>the</b> <b>Whale</b> Caller and Saluni turn to Mr. Yodd for confession. <b>The</b> <b>Whale</b> Caller confesses his love for Sharisha, and his concern that she might not return from her migration, while Saluni expresses her want to dispose of Sharisha in order to capture <b>the</b> <b>Whale</b> Caller’s love. During confessions, Mr. Yodd taunts <b>the</b> <b>Whale</b> Caller and Saluni by occasionally laughing, causing discomfort and self-mortification for both <b>the</b> <b>Whale</b> Caller and Saluni.|$|R
5|$|Both species eat {{primarily}} squid. <b>The</b> <b>whales</b> make seasonal inshore {{and offshore}} movements {{in response to}} the dispersal of their prey. Fish that are consumed include Atlantic cod, Greenland turbot, Atlantic mackerel, Atlantic herring, hake, and spiny dogfish in the northwest Atlantic. In the Faroe Islands, whales mostly eat squid, but will also eat fish species such as greater argentine and blue whiting. However, Faroe whales do not seem to feed on cod, herring, or mackerel even when they are abundant.|$|E
5|$|Evolution of Tappanaga, the endemic, larger form of short-finned pilots {{found in}} {{northern}} Japan, with similar characteristics to <b>the</b> <b>whales</b> found along Vancouver Island and northern USA coasts, have been {{indicated that the}} geniture of this form could be caused by the extinction of long-finned pilots in north Pacific in the 12th century where Magondou, the smaller, southern type possibly filled the former niches of long-finned pilots, adapting and colonizing into colder waters. Some claims that the Tappanaga, alternatively called Shiogondou, are not adapted form of short-finned pilots but a distinctive species of their own. Today, Tappanaga and Magondou differentiate their respective distributions by the border at around the oceanic front off Chōshi, Chiba.|$|E

50|$|Foyn was {{the first}} to hit <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> with grenade harpoon. Svend Foyn {{patented}} his grenade harpoon gun in 1870. He modified existing designs and utilized ideas developed by Erik Eriksen. It consisted of a cannon that fired a barbed explosive head harpoon. Aimed and fired, the harpoon barb would hook into <b>the</b> <b>whale.</b> A moment later an explosive charge in the head of the harpoon would inflict a mortal wound. Then <b>the</b> <b>whale</b> was retrieved by a winch.

Additional polar bear hunting was filmed in March 1933 off Cape Lisburne. The bowhead whale hunt was filmed from late April to July 1933 in two locations: Off Point Hope, Alaska, and off Cape Serdtse-Kamen on the Chukchi Peninsula. The whale hunting shoot took nearly three months because <b>the</b> <b>whales</b> kept fleeing every time they spotted boats.

5|$|Underwater {{noise from}} shipping, drilling, {{and other human}} {{activities}} is a significant concern in some key killer whale habitats, including Johnstone Strait and Haro Strait. In the mid-1990s, loud underwater noises from salmon farms were used to deter seals. Killer whales also avoided the surrounding waters. High-intensity sonar used by the Navy disturbs killer whales along with other marine mammals. Killer whales are popular with whale watchers, which may stress <b>the</b> <b>whales</b> and alter their behavior, particularly if boats approach too closely or block their lines of travel.|$|E
