40|$|International audienceBackground: The {{comparative}} {{efficacy of}} adalimumab (ADA) and infliximab (IFX) in Crohn's disease, and {{the benefit of}} initial combotherapy with an immunomodulator, are debated. Aim: To assess the best anti-TNF treatment regimens in Crohn's disease. Methods: We included 906 biologic-naïve Crohn's disease patients [median age, 31 years (24 – 41) ] and performed a retrospective analysis of 1284 <b>therapeutic</b> <b>exposures</b> to ADA (n = 521) or IFX (n = 763) between 2006 and 2015. An immunomodulator was associated during the first 4 – 6 months (initial combotherapy) during 706 <b>therapeutic</b> <b>exposures</b> (55 %). Median duration of anti-TNF therapy was 39 months (IQR 17 – 67). Primary outcomes were 6 -month and 2 -year response rates and drug survival. Logistic regression with propensity scoring and Cox proportional hazard analysis determined variables associated with outcomes. Results: The response rates at 6 months and 2 years were 64 % and 44 % on ADA mono, 86 % and 70 % on ADA combo, 72 % and 45 % on IFX mono, and 84 % and 68 % on IFX combotherapy, respectively. Differences between ADA and IFX were not significant, whereas combotherapy was superior to monotherapy (P < 0. 001). Drug survival was longer with combotherapy vs. monotherapy [adjusted hazard ratio 2. 17 (1. 72 – 2. 70) ] and not significantly different between ADA and IFX. During subsequent anti-TNF exposures, IFX combotherapy fared better than other groups regarding response rates, drug survival, disease activity, hospitalisations and abdominal surgery. Conclusion: In this retrospective analysis of a large tertiary centre cohort of Crohn's disease patients, ADA and IFX had similar efficacy as first line treatment, while initial combotherapy with an immunomodulator improved all outcome measures...|$|R
40|$|Ovarian damage {{following}} cancer {{therapy is}} dependent on age at treatment {{as well as the}} type of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>exposures.</b> Older age and exposure to higher doses of alkylating agents and higher doses of radiation to the ovary are associated with a greater like-lihood of ovarian failure. Acute loss of ovarian function during or shortly following treatment is relatively uncommon in females treated during childhood and adolescence but can be seen following myeloablative, alkylator-based cytoreduction (e. g., busulfan and cyclophosphamide) for stem cell transplant and following direct ovarian radiation with doses> 10 Gy.

This study examines the proportion of Australian midwives and related hospital nursing staff who recommend <b>therapeutic</b> sun <b>exposure</b> during this period. Methods: Questionnaires were completed by 363 Australian nurses (57. 2 % response) responsible for nursing post-partum women in 11 maternity hospitals in Queensland (QLD) and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). Results: Many nurses believed sun exposure was beneficial in treating: cracked nipples (QLD 41. 3 %, ACT 65. 8 %; p specified exposure time limits. Nursing staff from public hospitals in QLD, but not the ACT, {{were more likely than}} nurses from private hospitals to hold one or more such beliefs (p = 0. 008). Approximately 40 % of respondents thought people generally looked healthier with a suntan; 79 % of this group also held one or more risky beliefs about <b>therapeutic</b> sun <b>exposure</b> (p = 0. 043). Conclusion: A high proportion of these nurses held risky beliefs about the beneficial uses of sunlight for post-partum women and their infants and made recommendations consistent with their beliefs.

Furthermore, clear associations exist between specific <b>therapeutic</b> <b>exposures</b> and the risk for a variety of long-term complications. The entire landscape of health issues encountered for decades after successful completion of treatment is currently being explored in various collaborative research settings. These settings include large population-based or multi-institutional cohorts and single-institution studies. The ascertainment of outcomes has depended on self-reporting, linkage to registries, or clinical assessments.

Childhood cancer survivors are {{at increased risk}} for subsequent neoplasms (SNs), but the incidence beyond age 40 and associations with <b>therapeutic</b> <b>exposures</b> have not been well- described. Among 14, 364 childhood cancer survivors diagnosed between 1970 and 1986, 3, 171 had an attained age ≥ 40 years at the time of last contact. Cumulative incidence of SNs, standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and excess absolute risk of subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs), and relative risks (RR) for SMNs and non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs), were calculated. In total, 679 SNs were diagnosed ≥ 40 years of age, including 196 SMNs, 419 NMSCs, 21 non-malignant meningiomas, and 43 other benign neoplasms. At age 55, the cumulative incidence of new SNs and SMNs occurring beyond age 40 was 34. 6 % (95 % CI 28. 7 - 40. 6) and 16. 3 % (95 % CI 11. 7 - 20. 9), respectively. Survivors were twice as likely as the general population to be diagnosed with a SMN after age 40 (SIR= 2. 2, 95 % CI 1. 9 - 2. 5). Among SMNs, risk was increased for breast cancer (SIR= 5. 5, 95 % CI 4. 5 - 6. 7), renal cancer (SIR= 3. 9, 95 % CI 2. 0 - 7. 5), soft tissue sarcoma (SIR= 2. 6, 95 % CI 1. 5 - 4. 4), and thyroid cancer (SIR= 1. 9, 95 % CI 1. 0 - 3. 5).

40|$|Background. The {{advantage}} of our proposed therapy technique is to transit from the photodynamic diagnosis stage to effective <b>therapeutic</b> <b>exposure</b> (photodynamic therapy (PDT)) during one intervention. Objective: {{to evaluate the}} efficiency and safety of the novel treatment option for superficial bladder carcinoma (BC). Subjects and methods. The study enrolled 18 patients aged 66 ± 5 years (range 60 − 75 years) with superficial BC. A photosensitizer (photoditazine, Veta-Grand, Russia) was intravesically injected in a dose of 10 mg in 20 ml of saline solution 2 hours before intervention. Endoscopy was carried out on Storz PDT equipment with a monochrome light source at a wavelength of 402 nm, which corresponded to the maximum absorption spectrum for the molecule of photoditazine. The procedure was started with the PDT stage during which damaged bladder mucosal areas were found. Then there was transurethral resection of detected papillary masses and fluorescent areas with well-defined outlines. The fluorescent areas with ill-defined outlines underwent targeted light exposure at a wavelength of 402 nm for 5 – 10 min. The total light exposure of the bladder mucosa during the entire procedure was at least 30 min. The above procedure was performed in the patients at their inclusion into the study, then 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13 months later. The rates of complete tumor regression and adverse events were estimated during the study. Results. Multifocal bladder mucosa lesion with invasion grades Ta, T 1, Tis was detectable in all the patients at their inclusion into the study. Complete tumor regression was noted in 13 (72 %), 15 (83 %), and 17 (94 %) patients 1, 4, and 7 months after initiation of treatment, respectively. Following 10 and 13 months, no tumor tissue {{was found in the}} biopsy specimens from any patients. There were no evident local and systemic toxic reactions, including skin photosensitization. Conclusions. The proposed technique versus the traditional treatments for superficial BC is advantageous in its high antitumor selectivity and the absence of obvious local and systemic toxic reactions (so in the possibility of multiple repetitions of a treatment procedure), and a complementary combination of photodynamic diagnosis and <b>therapeutic</b> <b>exposure</b> (PDT) during one procedure. Our proposed technique is a promising treatment for superficial BC, including carcinoma in situ. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{elucidate}} whether an enhanced skin radiation reaction correlated with an enhanced chromosome radiation response. Twelve patients with late radiation skin ulcers formed after courses of radiation therapy were chosen as a group of individuals with elevated skin radiosensitivity. Half of the venous blood samples from each donor were irradiated with 2 Gy gamma-rays; the other half remained unexposed. Using standard cytogenetic technique, lymphocyte cultures were prepared with all samples. On the metaphase preparations, all chromosome aberrations detectable without karyotype identification were scored. The frequency of various aberrations in each patient were compared with relevant mean values in healthy unexposed donors. In several patients, the frequency of one aberration type or another exceeded the control value significantly. Comparison of aberration patterns in irradiated and nonirradiated cultures and consideration of elapsed time after <b>therapeutic</b> <b>exposures</b> suggested that the observed increased aberration levels reflected individual features of the patients' radiosensitivity, rather than lesions induced by previous in vivo exposures. Therefore, the question of a correlation between skin and chromosome radiosensitivity can be answered positively. Analysis of the peculiarities of cellular distribution of aberrations and of the relative contribution of different aberration types in patients and healthy donors indicates that the investigation of in vitro-induced aberrations is more suitable for the assessment of individual radiosensitivity than the study of aberrations observed in unexposed cultures...|$|R
40|$|Purpose To {{describe}} the development, implementation {{and evaluation of}} an educational intervention that addresses risky beliefs held by midwives and nurses working in maternity areas and new mothers about <b>therapeutic</b> sun <b>exposure.</b> Procedure In 2002 – 2003, 59 midwives and nurses from a hospital in northern Queensland participated in an educational intervention to discourage mothers from exposing themselves and their infants to sunlight for therapeutic reasons. Intervention staff attended an educational workshop and/or received educational resources. Resources (posters, pamphlets and bookmarks) were developed for the staff to use for educating mothers. Process evaluation of the quality and usefulness of the workshop and resources was conducted immediately after the workshop and 12 months later. Findings Intervention staff indicated that the workshop was relevant to their work, and increased their knowledge and confidence in talking to mothers about sunlight exposure. Ninety percent of the 59 participants indicated they had used the workshop information in their interactions with post-partum mothers. Of the resources, pamphlets and bookmarks were used most often. Conclusions and implications for practice The educational intervention was successful in developing the knowledge of midwives and nurses to provide sound advice to new mothers about <b>therapeutic</b> sun <b>exposure</b> and in developing resources to support them in their education. Although workshops and resources are useful in the short term, they are impractical to sustain.

The daptomycin MICs against these enterococci ranged from 0. 5 to 50 g/ml. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the relationship between the MICs of drugs against E. faecalis and E. faecium and the level of daptomycin exposure needed to evaluate the drug’s efficacy. Correlating the required <b>therapeutic</b> <b>exposures</b> of mice with the exposures achieved clinically allowed us to project enterococcal breakpoint values. Mice pretreated with carrageenan were infected intravenously with 3 108 to 4 108 CFU of E. faecalis or E. faecium. Daptomycin (5 to 50 mg of drug/kg of body weight) or saline control was administered 4 h postinfection and continued once daily for 2 days (three total doses). On day 4, infected kidneys were harvested, homogenized, and dilution plated. Efficacy was defined as a> 2 -log 10 (99 %) reduction in bacterial burden in infected kidneys. At clinically relevant dosages and exposures (area under the curve, 400 to 600 g hr/ml), daptomycin demonstrated similar and marked efficacy against all clinical enterococcal isolates tested. Daptomycin achieved efficacy with comparable doses against both vancomycin-sensitive (MIC, < 4 g/ml) and-resistant enterococcal strains tested. Efficacy was also established against the lab-derived daptomycin-resistant E. faecalis isolate. In this murine renal infection model, clinically relevant exposures of daptomycin were effective against E. faecalis an...|$|R
