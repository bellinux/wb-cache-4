You have a right to elect whom you please; vote for the man you think best, and I think, when that is done, that you and I are freemen. Do as you consider right and honest in electing men for office. I did not come here to make you a long speech, although invited to do so by you. I am not much of a speaker, and my business prevented me from preparing myself. I came to meet you as friends, and welcome you to the white people. I want you to come nearer to us. When I can serve you I will do so. We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment. Use your best judgment in selecting men for office and vote as you <b>think</b> <b>right.</b>|$|E
500|$|Actor Joshua Jackson {{believed}} the episode was important developmentally for the series, explaining it was [...] "creatively {{when the show}} really hit its stride in the first season." [...] Jackson continued, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>right</b> around the midway point of [...] season the show decided what it wanted to be. From about the midway, point it got on a pretty good streak of episodes. I can’t remember the exact number, but the two-part episode where Dunham gets kidnapped. After that, it was pretty clear; we introduced the bad guys for the season {{and there was a}} much clearer narrative drive {{through the rest of the}} season." ...|$|E
500|$|TV Guide {{referred}} to Todd as a breakout character. At {{the height of}} his popularity, which was called [...] "Todd-mania" [...] and [...] "the Todd Manning phenomenon", Howarth was disturbed that so many women were attracted to Todd and that the show's writers had begun to redeem the character. [...] In a September 1995 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, the publication stated that Howarth was troubled that [...] "his villainous character became such a fan favorite". In October 1995, Howarth told SOD, [...] "People have {{come up to me and}} said, 'My 7-year-old loves you.' What do I say to that? I'm not going to tell them, 'Don't let your 7-year-old watch TV.' But I have to say, it's disturbing." [...] He gave credit to the show's writers for Todd's popularity, saying that the rapists' trial was well constructed and added, [...] "I <b>think,</b> <b>right</b> now, we're just riding the wave of something that started last summer. Beyond that, I don't really know why people like Todd".|$|E

2500|$|In an April 2006 {{newsletter}} the Center {{defended the}} individual mandate in Romneycare, describing [...] "ndividuals {{who can afford}} to purchase health insurance and simply choose not to" [...] as [...] "free-riders." [...] In a May 15, 2011, interview with David Gregory on Meet the Press, Gingrich repeated his long-held belief that [...] "all of us have a responsibility to pay – help pay for health care", and suggested this could be implemented by either a mandate to obtain health insurance or a requirement to post a bond ensuring coverage. [...] In the same interview he said: [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>right</b> wing social engineering is any more desirable than left wing social engineering. I don't think imposing radical change from the right or the left is a very good way for a free society to operate." [...] This comment caused a great deal of back-lash within the Republican Party and from conservative pundits. [...] Later, on his web site, he expanded on his comments by saying he believes the federal mandate contained in the PPACA is unconstitutional and that he believes individual states should be able to decide the best way to implement healthcare programs for their citizens.|$|E
