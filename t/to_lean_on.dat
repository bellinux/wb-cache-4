25|$|On 23 September 1936 four naval {{personnel}} from {{the crew of}} cruiser Izumo went ashore and were taking a walk on Haining Road in the Shanghai International Settlement. At 8:20 PM when they approached the vicinity of its intersection with Wusong Road they were fired on from behind by four or five Chinese wielding pistols who were hiding in a stationary bus. The First-Class Seamen Tomomitsu Taminato and Yoshitane Yawata, as well as Second-Class Seaman Yoshimi Ideriha, sustained serious injuries.

500|$|Soon Sanders was {{attending}} all of MalcolmX's lectures at Temple Number Seven in Harlem. He always sought her out afterwards, {{and he would}} ask her a lot of questions.

500|$|Lotus {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 56, based on 12 reviews. Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe called it [...] "a good {{start in the}} effort to refocus attention on Aguilera's skills", but observed [...] "several tracks that sound mindlessly repetitive as sedentary listening experiences". Q called it [...] "generic" [...] and felt that [...] "nothing really stands out". Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club felt that the album [...] "often plays it safe" [...] and accused Aguilera of [...] "dumbing down her voice or lyrics for the sake of lightweight tunes or prevailing trends." [...] Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly found the album's [...] "self-empowerment anthems ... as contradictory as they are unoriginal" [...] and criticized its production for [...] "digitally smother" [...] Aguilera's vocals and [...] "draining all the emotion". Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani asserted that because it is [...] "Aguilera's shortest album since her debut, it boasts less filler, but also fewer obvious standouts." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times felt that the album's conventional direction is [...] "its biggest crime, more than its musical unadventurousness or its emphasis on bland self-help lyrics or its reluctance <b>to</b> <b>lean</b> <b>on</b> [...] Aguilera's voice, the thing that makes her special". Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone dismissed it as a [...] "vitriol-tsunami of a record".|$|E

2500|$|The {{story of}} Mrs. Smith is strikingly {{similar to that}} of Helene's, as if she, herself, were {{speaking}} through Mrs. Smith. Through the story of Mrs. Smith, Helene argues that a successful pregnancy is possible when there is a loving relationship between mother and daughter, which 'smoothly socializes daughters into becoming mothers themselves.' Mirroring the life of Helene, Mrs. Smith's problem is resolved during the next pregnancy when Mrs. Smith identifies with a pregnant friend, and particularly with the friend's mother. Helene wrote that the friend's mother was the opposite of Mrs. Smith's mother. [...] She was filled with maternal warmth for both Mrs. Smith and her own daughter. This maternal love, shared with her friend, allowed Mrs. Smith to become a mother. According to Helene, although a healthy relationship between mother and daughter was important for a healthy pregnancy, equally important was the ability <b>to</b> <b>lean</b> <b>on</b> a female friend who could act as a surrogate sister for the pregnant woman. This idea is furthered when Mrs. Smith and her friend became pregnant again around the same time. This time, there was no anxiety or fear surrounding pregnancy, but when Mrs. Smith's friend moved away, she miscarried. The diagnosis, according to Helene, was that Mrs. Smith suffered from 'over-excitability of the uterus.' A successful pregnancy, therefore, could only be brought about by leaning on another woman.|$|E

2500|$|Indeed, a visibly shaken Ceaușescu gave a halting 5-hour (other {{sources say}} 7-hour) speech that was soon {{interrupted}} by boos. Beginning in a trembling voice, {{he made an}} initial, hopeless attempt to send the miners back to work: “Comrades, {{this is not the}} war… this is a disgrace for the entire nation… a disgrace! I have taken note of your grievances.” He tried to explain the party's policy and appeal to the miners through demagogy, claiming that the party leadership had wanted to reduce working hours but that the miners had resisted, which insult to their intelligence was met by cries of “It is not us! Bandits, thieves!” A general murmur of the crowd ran through the speech, along with protests and outbursts of anger; whenever Ceaușescu began to stumble over his words, some of the men booed and whistled. Proposing that the six-hour day be introduced gradually at Lupeni and then at the other mines, the men replied, “A six-hour day from tomorrow.” Toward the end, when, angered by their audacity, he still refused to grant an immediate six-hour workday, phrases loudly heckled included [...] "He has no idea what the people's interests are" [...] and [...] "He is not concerned with the workers' fundamental interests". Starting to threaten them, Ceaușescu warned that “If you do not go back to work we'll have to stop pussyfooting around!” According to observers, [...] "Down with Ceaușescu!" [...] was then heard after prolonged booing, an account confirmed by Verdeț. Refusing to grasp what was taking place [...] a break between Party and workers on a scale unprecedented in Communist Romania , he was both shocked by his inability to connect with the workers and frightened for his physical safety (once in the workers' midst, there was little chance for law enforcement to protect him). Only when Dobre seized the microphone and urged the miners to let Ceaușescu finish did the atmosphere become less charged. At that point he saw that his only exit lay in making conciliatory promises {{he had no intention of}} honouring; using the wooden language that miners trust, he promised to resolve their grievances (agreeing to a six-hour workday for everyone, with Saturdays and Sundays off, and to build factories that would provide jobs for miners' wives and daughters), vowed those responsible for the miners' discontent would be brought to account and that there would be no retribution, and was applauded. [...] "Calm down and go back to work", he said, after which, exhausted by the speech and the tension which made him feel insecure, he felt physically weak when leaving the platform, having <b>to</b> <b>lean</b> <b>on</b> one of his men. Verdeț and Pană were released and the strike came to an end immediately after Ceaușescu's departure, the men dispersing and some going into the mines for the August 3 evening shift. They even offered to make up the time lost during the strike.|$|E
