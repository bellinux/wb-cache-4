5000|$|Bellick and Geary {{are absent}} {{for the next}} three episodes. They {{eventually}} re-appear in [...] "Dead Fall", where they are able to surmise that T-Bag is in possession of Westmoreland's money. As T-Bag’s subplot separates from the main plotline (which includes the protagonists fighting against the conspiracy) he begins to share scenes with Bellick and Geary in the next three episodes. After capturing T-bag in ”Rendezvous”, Bellick and Geary proceed to torture him to make him reveal the location of the money. In Bolshoi Booze, they discover a key hidden in his sock. The key leads them to a locker containing the five million dollars, but in one of the episode’s twist endings Geary betrays Bellick, hitting him {{in the head with a}} meat <b>tenderiser</b> and steals the money. As Bellick recovers in the hospital in the next episode, he learns that T-Bag has killed Geary and taken back the money. Furthermore, Bellick himself becomes a suspect to Geary’s murder, as T-bag manages to frame him. In the episode [...] "Disconnect", Bellick appears in scenes with a female Kansas detective. After unsuccessfully trying to prove his innocence, Bellick is arrested for Geary’s murder at the end of the episode. At the end of the fall finale, Bellick reluctantly accepts a deal of 25 years to avoid the death penalty and is sent to Fox River to begin serving his sentence. His last scene of the episode shows him in his cell in Gen Pop.|$|E

40|$|Theme 1 In Lombardy public {{subsidies}} to bus companies {{have increased in}} the last ten years, while market share and quality of public transport have declined. In 1996, the Lombardy Region began a reform of public local transport. In line with EU regulations, the regional transport acts 13 / 1995 and 22 / 1998 aim to improve the effectiveness of the public transport through competition and economic incentives. This paper describes the scheme developed for the tenders. In the present concession system, the routes and the schedules for each service are decided by the Region. The reform calls for tenders for a network divided into areas. The areas must be homogeneous in terms of transport demand and attractive for the <b>tenderisers.</b> Their size is chosen to make the management of the services affordable for sufficient competitors. A methodology has been developed to support the grantor in setting the following service requirements for each area: the links {{to be included in the}} network and the minimum number of seats to be assured by each route. Further requirements concerning fares, environmental and quality standards, and the information provided to users and to the transport authority are also set. The effectiveness of the planned services is encouraged by economic incentives: part of the subsidy is paid only if specific objectives set by the public authorities are met. The criteria to compare the offers are complex, because of the need to evaluate not only the tendered price, but also the effectiveness of the network and schedule proposals, as well as the usefulness of the additional routes and seats served or the improved quality. A Decision Support System (DSS) software application based on multi-criteria analysis automatically chooses the best project, ensuring a transparent procedure. The reliability of this evaluation system has been tested in simulated tender involving representatives of Lombardy bus companies. Institute of Transport and Logistics Studies.

In experiment 1, 18 Longissimus dorsi (LD, from the 9 th to the 12 th vertebrate) and 18 Biceps femoris (BF) muscles of 18 mature male camels were obtained from a local meat market to determine the effect of BT. Twenty-four hours after slaughter, each muscle was divided into 3 steaks, which were passed: 0 (control), 1 pass and 2 passes through a blade <b>tenderiser.</b> After treatment, steaks were cooked and slice shear force (SSF) was determined. The SSF values of LD and BF were significantly reduced by 3. 2 kg or 22. 4 % and 6. 3 kg or 21. 6 %, respectively, when muscles were passed through the blade <b>tenderiser</b> twice compared to control muscles. Experiment 2 was conducted to determine the effect of PM on LD tenderness. Nine LD muscles of mature male camels were purchased from a local meat market and stored at 2 º C. Each LD muscle was divided into 3 steaks and stored for 2, 7 or 14 days PM at 2 º C. Postmortem storage significantly decreased SSF, increased myofibril fragmentation index and did not affect cooking loss, cooking time and sarcomere length. Postmortem storage for 14 days was more effective in reducing SSF (reduction of 7. 9 kg or 56. 5 %) than BT. Our results indicated that both BT and PM are effective methods to improve the tenderness of mature camel meat...|$|E
40|$|Pineapple crowns are an {{agricultural}} waste available in large quantity particularly from canned pineapple industry. Alternatives to its efficient utilisation are necessary as the crowns contain high enzyme activity {{which can be}} potentially used as a meat <b>tenderiser.</b> Thus, the aims {{of this study are}} to extract and purify bromelain from the pineapple crowns. The purified bromelain was freeze dried to produce bromelain powder which was later applied to tenderise the toughest Brahman part, round. The action of bromelain in tenderising beef was affected by different pHs of beef, immersion temperatures and times, and bromelain solution concentrations. Thus, response surface methodology (RSM) was used to determine the feasible optimum condition for the beef tenderisation by bromelain. The effect of bromelain treatment on the physico-chemical properties of beef and its nutritional quality was determined. The nutritional quality of beef was determined from the proximate extent between the bromelain-treated beef and the reference pattern protein and compared with the untreated beef. SDS-PAGE revealed that bromelain from pineapple crowns is a monomelic with a molecular weight of 30 kDa. The bromelain powder was less pure compared to that of standard bromelain powder. The bromelain powder stored in the frozen temperature was the most stable since it showed very little loss in bromelain activity and the lowest value in water activity compared to bromelain powder stored in the chilled and room temperatures after four weeks of storage. The beef tenderization treated with bromelain could be optimised by 89. 91 % at the feasible optimum condition whereby the pH of beef was 5. 6, the immersion temperature was 60 °C, the concentration of bromelain solution was 0. 17 % and the immersion time was 10 minutes. Bromelain decreased the hardness, water holding capacity (WHC), moisture content and a* value of beef. On the other hand, bromelain increased the pH, cooking loss, and L* and b* values of beef. Bromelain also fragmented and denatured the proteins in beef. The proximate extent of the bromelain-treated beef (0. 57) was inclined towards the reference pattern protein (1. 00) compared to the untreated beef (0. 51). This indicated that beef treated with bromelain had a desirable effect on the nutritional quality of beef. This study can contribute in promoting and increasing the economic value of beef. At the same time, the extraction of bromelain from pineapple crowns can solve the waste disposal problem generated by the canned pineapple industry...|$|E
40|$|Squids are {{cephalopods}} {{widely used}} as food in many cultures, {{where they are}} customarily cooked {{as a means of}} enhancing nutritional value, and as a way of temporarily preserving squid from spoilage. Modelled on a cooked, comminuted and fermented mussel product developed at AUT, this project primarily aimed to develop a tenderized fermented squid product in the form of spread or pieces. Squid mantle is chewy by virtue of its high collagen content. While this may appeal to some consumers, the New Zealand culinary tradition uses kiwifruit proteases to minimise this chewiness. Zyactinase, a standardized kiwifruit protease was used in this study as well as freshly prepared kiwifruit extract. Various product forms such as minced, bowl chopped and chopstick-suitable pieces were compared. Irrespective of the use of enzyme, during the preparation of fermented product, minced and bowl chopped squid mantles expanded when the required evacuation was applied. This was undesirable. It was laborious to expel all the gas from the system necessary for the subsequent anaerobic fermentation. It was also noticed that the finer the cut the harder it was to achieve the required vacuum. Light and electron microscopy revealed the fine structure of squid mantle, which led to this packaging problem. Therefore the preparation of finely comminuted squid spread was discontinued. Chopstick-suitable fermented pieces were more promising because they could be easily vacuum packed. The cooking step prior to evacuation and fermentation was thought to be a useful way of limiting the protease activity through enzyme denaturation. Over tenderized squid develops a mushy texture, and exposure to protease also led to a yellowing of squid mantle, possibly linked to the Maillard reaction. Thus the tenderizing effects of the kiwifruit protease preparations were examined under varying conditions of concentration, pH and incubation period. Based on the earlier experiments with comminuted squid, 1 % Zyactinase to the weight of the squid tissue was chosen as the starting point for tenderising the chopstick-suitable fermented product. However, it took overnight incubation to tenderise the mantle pieces. In contrast, freshly prepared kiwifruit was highly effective in tendering squid pieces when marinated for only five hours. Thus, the tendering ability of Zyactinase was questionable. The pH of the incubation medium can influence the texture of squid mantle, and it was found that acidic conditions toughened the mantle pieces irrespective of the presence of protease. This could be linked to the denaturation effect of food acids {{in the same way that}} the raw fish becomes sushi on the addition of lemon juice or vinegar. Fermentation was successful throughout the studies, with or without enzymes. The lactic acid produced might be anticipated to affect texture, but there were no significant difference in the textural values of squid pieces between after enzyme incubation and after fermentation, when enzyme incubations were conducted at ambient pH. In respect of tenderising, the springiness of the squid pieces was close to unity in most of the preparations with or without enzyme under varying pH and incubation times. However, a slight but significant drop in toughness was found for pieces after fermentation In conclusion, cooked fermented squid pieces could be commercially produced in a commercial environment, but Zyactinase is not effective as a <b>tenderiser...</b>|$|E
40|$|Actinidin from kiwifruit can tenderise {{meat and}} help to add value to low-value meat cuts. Compared with other {{traditional}} <b>tenderisers</b> (e. g. papain and bromelain) it is a promising way, due to its less intensive tenderisation effects on meat. But, as with other plant proteases, over-tenderisation of meat may occur if the reaction is not controlled. Therefore, the objectives {{of this study were}} (1) finding a suitable process to control the enzyme activity after desired meat tenderisation has been achieved; (2) optimising the dual processing conditions- actinidin pre-treatment followed by sous vide cooking to achieve the desired tenderisation in shorter processing times. The first part of the study focused on the thermal inactivation of actinidin in freshly-prepared kiwifruit extract (KE) or a commercially available green kiwifruit enzyme extract (CEE). The second part evaluated the effects of actinidin pre-treatment on texture and in vitro protein digestibility of sous vide cooked beef brisket steaks. The results showed that actinidin in KE and CEE was inactivated at moderate temperatures (60 and 65 °C) in less than 5 min. However, the enzyme inactivation times increased considerably (up to 24 h at these temperatures) for KE/CEE-meat mixtures, compared with KE/CEE alone. The thermal inactivation kinetics were used as a guide for optimising actinidin application parameters during {{the second phase of the}} study. For the final experiments, beef steaks were injected with 5 % (w/w, extract/meat) of CEE solution (3 mg/mL) followed by vacuum tumbling (at 4 °C for 15 min) and cooking (at 70 °C for 30 min) under sous vide conditions. This cooking time was considerably less than usual sous vide cooking times used in the meat industry. The actinidin-treated meat had no change in pH and colour, but showed a lower instrumental shear force; and improved sensory scores for tenderness, juiciness and flavour than the untreated meat steaks when tested by a sensory panel. Improved tenderness agreed well with the Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) results that showed considerable breakdown of the myofibrillar structure, particularly around the Z line. The addition of actinidin enhanced the rate of breakdown of muscle proteins, as shown by Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and led to an increase in both protein solubility and ninhydrin-reactive free amino N release, during simulated gastric digestion. These results demonstrate the positive effects of actinidin on meat tenderness and meat protein digestibility during gastric digestion in vitro...|$|R
