5|$|Henry {{married his}} last wife, the wealthy widow Catherine Parr, in July 1543. A {{reformer}} at heart, she argued with Henry over religion. Ultimately, Henry remained committed to an idiosyncratic mixture of Catholicism and Protestantism; the reactionary mood which had gained ground following {{the fall of}} Cromwell had neither eliminated his Protestant streak nor been overcome by it. Parr helped reconcile Henry with his daughters, Mary and Elizabeth. In 1543, an Act of Parliament put <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> line of succession after Edward. The same act allowed Henry to determine further succession to the throne in his will.|$|E
5|$|Later in the evening, 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry counterattacked the {{positions}} {{but was unable}} to take <b>them</b> <b>back,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face of machine gun and small arms fire, and was forced to withdraw by nightfall. After this failed attempt to retake the equipment, Dean ordered {{the positions}} where the captured equipment was located to be destroyed by an airstrike. With the 1st Battalion having taken heavy casualties and the 3rd Battalion forced to move to counter North Korean attacks, the northwest flank of the American line had been beaten back. The North Korean 4th Division began crossing the river, only slightly impeded by US aircraft attacking its boats.|$|E

25|$|Back in {{the third}} tier of English football, in the 1985–86 season, Blackpool {{finished}} twelfth.

25|$|Redclift (2003) {{concluded}} {{that many of}} the one million migrants, mainly of British and Irish origin, who arrived in Canada in the mid-19th century benefited from the availability of land and absence of social barriers to mobility.

25|$|In {{the first}} week of the 2008 Tour de France, the stages were mostly flat. As {{traditionally}} in the Tour de France, this resulted in small breakaways of cyclists, and the sprinters' teams trying to get <b>them</b> <b>back.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first stage, the sprinters won, with Thor Hushovd winning the stage, but in the second stage, four cyclists managed to stay away. The fourth stage was a time trial, won by Stefan Schumacher, who took over the lead. In the fifth stage, the sprinters won the battle and Mark Cavendish won the stage.|$|E

25|$|Led by Selmon, Linebackers Dewey Selmon, Richard Wood, Dave Lewis, and Mike Washington, Mark Cotney, and Cedric Brown in the secondary, {{the early}} years Buccaneers quickly earned an {{identity}} as a defensive team. Their 3–4 defense peaked in 1979 when they {{led the league in}} total defense, points allowed, and first downs allowed. Lee Roy Selmon was voted NFL Defensive Player of the Year, but they eventually fell 10 points short of the Super Bowl as the offense held <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> NFC Championship game in a 9–0 loss to the Los Angeles Rams.|$|E
25|$|The phonautograph, {{patented}} by Léon Scott in 1857, used a vibrating diaphragm and stylus to graphically record sound waves as tracings on sheets of paper, purely for visual analysis {{and without any}} intent of playing <b>them</b> <b>back.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 2000s, these tracings were first scanned by audio engineers and digitally converted into audible sound. Phonautograms of singing and speech made by Scott in 1860 were played back as sound {{for the first time}} in 2008. Along with a tuning fork tone and unintelligible snippets recorded as early as 1857, these are the earliest known recordings of sound.|$|E
25|$|Pixies {{like to play}} tricks like {{stealing}} horses {{at night}} and bringing <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning with their manes tangled. Pixies appear more childlike and grow the same height as a young child, with their giant heads being largely disproportionate to their bodies. These fairies are regarded as 'walking therapy' by other fairies, due to their innocent faces and usually sunny exuberance. Pixies have the gift mesmer and the gift of tongues. They have large brains, fragile skulls, small lungs, and short legs. Many pixies are extremely cheeky; However,their large skulls and brain makes them susceptible to carry diseases. Doodah Day, Opal Koboi, Unix, and the Brill Brothers are members of this family.|$|E
50|$|Muren was an {{institute}} instructor for the LDS Church. He first {{taught at}} the institute adjacent to El Camino College. After teaching at several institutes, Muren {{served as president of}} the Costa Rica San José Mission of the church from 1977 to 1980. This mission covered Nicaragua and Muren was involved in both pulling out missionaries and sending <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst of war <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fall of 1978.

25|$|In March 1995, Coast Air started {{flights from}} Sørstokken to Stavanger using a Twin Otter {{four times a}} week. However, the route did not have {{sufficient}} patronage and was terminated in June. In November 1995, Widerøe stated that {{they were willing to}} fly from Sørstokken to Oslo, in cooperation with Air Stord, using de Havilland Canada Dash 8 aircraft, with 37 or 50 seats. This would allow increased capacity without extending the runway. During March and April 1996, Sørstokken had its first regular helicopter flights, operated by Norsk Helikopter, as Aker had been contracted to dismount the oil platform at Odin. The company had to fly out personnel in the morning and take <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evening. On 20 May, Air Stord started using the 32-seat Dornier Do 328 aircraft on the route to Oslo.|$|E
25|$|Before {{the event}} went live on pay-per-view, Raw's Ric Flair and Carlito faced SmackDown!'s Gregory Helms and Chavo Guerrero in a tag team {{lumberjack}} match. Flair and Carlito controlled {{the early part}} of the match until Helms threw Flair over the top rope. SmackDown! lumberjacks attacked Flair before throwing him back into the ring. Helms and Guerrero continued to beat on Flair, but couldn't pin Flair. Chavo tried to end it with his frog splash, but Flair moved. Chavo tagged in Helms, but Flair tagged in Carlito. Carlito dominated Helms, leading to Guerrero coming in to help Helms, but Flair came in and fought Guerrero. Flair and Guerrero took each other out of the ring, and before the lumberjacks could throw <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ring, Carlito hit the Backstabber on Guerrero to pick up the win for himself and Flair.|$|E
25|$|Australian opener Jimmy Maher {{recorded}} his second successive single-figure score {{in his first}} match for Durham, as the hosts made it 59 for 3, but centuries from Paul Collingwood and Dale Benkenstein sent <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> lead. The pair added 206 runs together before Collingwood was out for 112 - his sixth first-class century in twelve matches - while Benkenstein continued to 162 not out, adding 80 runs with Gareth Breese and 21 for the ninth wicket with Brad Williams before declaring. The declaration set Derbyshire 280 to win in 66 overs, and Michael di Venuto and Steve Stubbings put on 91 for the first wicket to cut that down to 189. They had used two hours to hit those 91, though, leaving two hours for the remaining 189 - and though Stubbings completed his century, {{the rest of the}} batting order could not quite hit quite quickly enough, and they finished on 277 for 6 - three runs short of victory.|$|E

500|$|During the Landing at Anzac Cove on 25 April 1915, the 2nd Battalion, under Braund's command, came ashore in {{the second}} and third waves, landing a total of 31 {{officers}} and 937 other ranks. Upon landing, the 2nd Battalion dispatched two companies, 'A' and 'D' to assist the 3rd Brigade who were [...] pushing inland towards a high feature known as [...] "Baby 700", which overlooked the beachhead. One of the 2nd Battalion's platoons, under Lieutenant Leslie Morshead, advanced further than any other Australian unit, making it to the slopes of Baby 700, before a determined counter-attack by Ottoman forces drove <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon.|$|E
500|$|The Cat {{brings in}} a big red box from outside, from which he {{releases}} two identical creatures with blue hair and red suits called Thing One and Thing Two. The Things cause more trouble, such as flying kites in the house, knocking pictures {{off the wall and}} picking up the children's mother's new polka-dotted gown. All this comes to an end when the fish spots the children's mother out the window. In response, Sally's brother catches the Things in a net, and the Cat, apparently ashamed, stores <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> big red box. He takes it out the front door as the fish and the children survey the mess he has made. But the Cat soon returns, riding a machine that picks everything up and cleans the house, delighting the fish and the children. The Cat then leaves just before their mother arrives, and the fish and the children are back where they started {{at the beginning of the}} story. As she steps in, the mother asks the children what they did while she was out, but the children are hesitant and do not answer. The story ends with the question, [...] "What would you do if your mother asked you?" ...|$|E
500|$|Also {{returning}} to the series are Neve McIntosh as Madame Vastra, Dan Starkey as Strax and Catrin Stewart as Jenny. All three previously appeared in [...] "A Good Man Goes to War" [...] and reprised their roles both in this episode and in the prequels. They returned due to the popularity of Vastra and Jenny; Moffat considered a spin-off featuring them, {{though he did not}} have the time to do it. Instead, he decided to bring <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> main series. Richard E. Grant had previously played the Doctor on two occasions, as an alternative Tenth Doctor in the spoof charity special Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death, which was written by Moffat and as an alternative Ninth Doctor in the animated story Scream of the Shalka which had been intended to be a continuation of the series before it was revived in 2005. Smith commented that Grant was [...] "born to be a Who villain. He pitches it on that perfect level and tone". Grant's appearance in Doctor Who was teased by the BBC via Twitter, announcing his appearance at midnight 5 August 2012. Tom Ward was drawn to his role because of the quality of the script, and also stated his young children were pleased that he appeared in the programme. The Great Intelligence was voiced by Sir Ian McKellen. The two children Clara is governess to, Digby and Francesca, were played by real-life brother and sister Joseph and Ellie Darcey-Alden.|$|E
50|$|For a brief period, the Third Army dug <b>in</b> near <b>the</b> Chir river, but Soviet troops pushed <b>them</b> <b>back.</b> <b>In</b> December 1942, <b>the</b> {{decision}} was made to strategically retreat westwards.|$|R

25|$|The Mamluks {{defeated}} the Ilkhanates {{a second time}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> First Battle of Homs and began to drive <b>them</b> <b>back</b> east. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> process they consolidated their power over Syria, fortified the area, and formed mail routes and diplomatic connections among the local princes. Baibars' troops attacked Acre in 1263, captured Caesarea in 1265, and took Antioch in 1268.|$|R
500|$|The Ideas {{from the}} Deep team, who {{referred}} {{to themselves as}} the [...] "IFD guys", {{could not afford to}} leave their jobs to work on the game full-time, so they continued to work at Softdisk making Gamer's Edge games during the day while working on Commander Keen at night. They also continued to take home their work computers to Carmack's house on the weekends, putting them in their cars at night and bringing <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning before anyone else arrived; they even began to request upgrades to the computers from Softdisk, nominally for their work. The group split into different roles: Hall became the game designer and creative director, John Carmack and Romero were the programmers, and Wilbur the manager. They invited artist Adrian Carmack from Softdisk to join them late in development, while Roathe was soon kicked out of the group; Romero, the self-appointed leader of the team, liked him but felt that his work ethic did not match well {{with the rest of the}} team and pushed for his removal. Ideas from the Deep spent nearly every waking moment when they were not working at Softdisk from October through December 1990 working on Commander Keen, with Wilbur forcing them to eat and take breaks. Several members of the team have mentioned in interviews as an example of the team's commitment a night during development when a heavy storm flooded the path to get to the house, preventing them from working, and John Romero waded through a flooding river to make it to the house anyway.|$|E
500|$|Moore {{began writing}} the series very early on, hoping to avoid {{publication}} delays {{such as those}} faced by the DC limited series Camelot 3000. When writing the script for the first issue, Moore said he realized, [...] "I only had enough plot for six issues. We were contracted for 12!" [...] His solution was to alternate issues that dealt with the overall plot of the series with origin issues for the characters. Moore wrote very detailed scripts for Gibbons to work from. Gibbons recalled that [...] "he script for {{the first issue of}} Watchmen was, I think, 101 pages of typescript—single-spaced—with no gaps between the individual panel descriptions or, indeed, even between the pages." [...] Upon receiving the scripts, the artist had to number each page [...] "in case I drop them on the floor, because it would take me two days to put <b>them</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right order", and used a highlighter pen to single out lettering and shot descriptions; he remarked, [...] "It takes quite a bit of organizing before you can actually put pen to paper." [...] Despite Moore's detailed scripts, his panel descriptions would often end with the note [...] "If that doesn't work for you, do what works best"; Gibbons nevertheless worked to Moore's instructions. In fact, Gibbons only suggested a single change to the script: a compression of Ozymandias' narration while he was preventing a sneak attack by Rorschach, as he felt that the dialog was too long to fit with the amount of action expressed; Moore agreed and re-wrote the scene. Gibbons {{had a great deal of}} autonomy in developing the visual look of Watchmen, and frequently inserted background details that Moore admitted he did not notice until later. Moore occasionally contacted fellow comics writer Neil Gaiman for answers to research questions and for quotes to include in issues.|$|E
2500|$|The world's first-recorded chemist is {{considered}} a woman named Tapputi, a perfume maker mentioned in a cuneiform tablet from the 2nd millennium BC in Mesopotamia.

5000|$|... "Continuity {{pictures}} {{became so}} important," [...] explained make-up artist Maggie Thomas. [...] "For instance, we would always see the vets leaving and arriving at House, although we never ever went inside the real house on location and the costume and make-up had {{to match up}} exactly several weeks later when we saw <b>them</b> arrive <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> studio set of House hall." ...|$|R
60|$|His spirits rose again. Grant couldn't {{stand out}} when he brought to him a deed of the farm. Surely his debt would be {{canceled}} when he had seen <b>them</b> all <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wide old kitchen. He began to plan and to dream. He went to the windows and {{looked out on the}} yard to see how much it had changed.|$|R
