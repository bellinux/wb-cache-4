25|$|Whilst {{noting the}} obvious {{relevance}} {{of this to}} their own proposed scenario Marlovians do not seek multiple parallels between Marlowe's known or predicted life and these stories, believing that the plays are so rich in plot devices that such parallels can be found with numerous individuals. On the other hand, there are some places where they point out {{how difficult it is}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>just</b> why something was included if it were not some sort of in-joke for those who were privy to something unknown to most of us.|$|E
500|$|The epistolary Satirical Letter of Papyrus Anastasi I written {{during the}} Nineteenth dynasty was a {{pedagogical}} and didactic text copied on numerous ostraca by schoolboys. Wente describes the versatility of this epistle, which contained [...] "...proper greetings with wishes for this {{life and the}} next, the rhetoric composition, interpretation of aphorisms in wisdom literature, application of mathematics to engineering problems and the calculation of supplies for an army, and the geography of western Asia". Moreover, Wente calls this a [...] "...polemical tractate" [...] that counsels against the rote, mechanical learning of terms for places, professions, and things; for example, it is not acceptable <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>just</b> the place names of western Asia, but also important details about its topography and routes. To enhance the teaching, the text employs sarcasm and irony.|$|E
500|$|As {{the battles}} over the Channel {{continued}}, Galland shot down Spitfires on 25 and 28 July. [...] On 1 August 1940, Galland {{was awarded the}} Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (...) for his 17 victories. Galland continued to make fighter sweeps over southern England before the main assault opened. On 11 August, Galland's unit engaged 74 Squadron. In a brief dogfight, one Spitfire was shot down. During these battles the RAF seemed <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>just</b> where and when to send their aircraft. This made Galland suspect {{a high level of}} organisation was at work controlling RAF fighters. The cloudy skies of Britain were a dangerous environment to confront an enemy that had an effective ground control system. Galland resolved to fly higher, where he could see most things and where the Bf 109 performed at its best.|$|E

500|$|Donning a {{disguise}} modeled after a raccoon, Cartman becomes a vigilante dubbed [...] "The Coon", who attempts {{to wipe out}} crime in South Park. Though Cartman tries to raise awareness about The Coon through word of mouth, nobody pays {{much attention to the}} Coon's efforts. When he reports [...] "crimes" [...] (such as mistaking a man innocently trying to kiss his date for a rapist) to the police department, he is threatened with jail time and snubbed off. During class, Cartman tries to hype up an appearance from the Coon, saying he will be on roof of a Walgreens later that evening. Cartman (as the Coon) shows up to the spot to find another child superhero named [...] "Mysterion", who is far more successful in garnering appreciation as a crime stopping icon from the police and South Park citizens who want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>just</b> [...] "Who is Mysterion?" [...] Cartman is angered by his lack of popularity and the attention Mysterion is receiving.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{think that}} a lot of fans would be {{surprised}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>just</b> how much of a free hand we have been given in the making of this movie. I know how easy it is to see every decision to cut a scene as 'studio' pressure but it was always much more to do with pacing and rhythm in the film itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alpha {{particles}} are tiny, positively charged particles that are spontaneously emitted by certain substances such as uranium and radium. [...] Rutherford himself had discovered them in 1899. In 1908 {{he was trying}} to precisely measure their charge-to-mass ratio. To do this, he first needed <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>just</b> how many alpha particles his sample of radium was giving off (after which he would measure their total charge and divide one by the other). [...] Alpha {{particles are}} too tiny to be seen even with a microscope, but Rutherford knew that alpha particles ionize air molecules, and if the air is within an electric field, the ions will produce an electric current. On this principle, Rutherford and Geiger designed a simple counting device which consisted of two electrodes in a glass tube. [...] Every alpha particle that passed through the tube would create a pulse of electricity that could be counted. [...] It was an early version of the Geiger counter.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't ask her {{anything}} about having me; and if you'll let me speak, I'll tell 'ee what I want <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> I <b>just</b> said, Did she care about me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why?" [...] queried Davy, {{settling}} comfortably {{down and}} looking up with a tearstained, investigating face. [...] "Why ain't whopper as good as falsehood? I want <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> It's <b>just</b> as big a word." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I know,” says I, “but {{it happens}} I was {{addressing}} myself to you, Mr. Black Jack. And all I want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> is <b>just</b> this: {{did you see}} Case’s figurehead about a week ago?” ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No jokes, no lies doin' there! I opened {{right up}} to her. I told her I'd done well, but that I didn't want father <b>to</b> <b>know</b> it <b>just</b> yet, and we sit there holdin' hands when the old man hove round the corner.|$|R

6000|$|... "Right!" [...] I exclaimed. [...] "Most assuredly you did. Nothing {{could be}} more helpful, and in fact more necessary, than <b>to</b> let me <b>know</b> <b>just</b> where I left off. What did the sisters say?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will remain}} in the back row where I can see well enough," [...] said Bladud. [...] "Keep a {{look-out}} for me when you feel lost. I don't mean <b>to</b> make myself <b>known</b> <b>just</b> yet." ...|$|R
60|$|I nodded. He {{stared at}} me for a moment with an astonishment to which I was wholly indifferent. He did not seem <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>just</b> how to act.|$|E

2500|$|It {{is quite}} common {{for a person to}} go by one of the {{surnames}} that is not the last one in order, especially if the latter is very common. For example, Aníbal Cavaco Silva is commonly called [...] "Cavaco" [...] and Ayrton Senna da Silva chose <b>to</b> be <b>known</b> <b>just</b> as Ayrton Senna because Silva is a very common surname.|$|R

6000|$|... 'I'm very sorry,' he said, 'I hadn't {{the least}} idea you wanted the thing kept dark. How was I <b>to</b> <b>know?</b> I've <b>just</b> been telling {{it to some}} of the chaps in there.

50|$|In most {{versions}} of the mythos, Gordon is ignorant of Batman's identity. There is usually the implication Gordon is smart enough to solve the mystery, but chooses not {{to in order to}} preserve Batman's effectiveness and maintain his own plausible deniability. In the 1966 Batman film, Gordon explicitly states his desire not <b>to</b> <b>know</b> for <b>just</b> such a reason.|$|R
