25|$|The public {{transportation}} system began to expand beyond the trolley lines pioneered by predecessors of the Scranton Railways system. The Lackawanna and Wyoming Valley Railroad, {{commonly referred to}} as the Laurel Line, was built as an interurban passenger and freight carrier to Wilkes-Barre. Its Scranton station, offices, powerhouse and maintenance facility were built on the former grounds of the Lackawanna Steel Company, and operations started in 1903. Beginning in 1907, Scrantonians could also ride trolley cars to the northern suburbs of Clarks Summit and Dalton. They could travel to Lake Winola and Montrose using the Northern Electric Railroad. After the 1920s, no new trolley lines were built, but bus operations were started and expanded to meet service needs. In 1934, Scranton Railways was re-incorporated as the Scranton Transit Company, reflecting that shift in <b>transportation</b> <b>modes.</b>|$|E

40|$|Executive summary Before {{the opening}} of West Rail, bus is a leading <b>transportation</b> <b>mode</b> to go to urban area in West New Territories. But after {{the opening of}} West Rail in 2003, the {{situation}} is changed. West Rail and bus become an important <b>transportation</b> <b>mode</b> of residents. But the market share of West Rail is not high enough to reach the target of KCRC. Then what is the main problem of West Rail behind? The purpose of this report is to investigate on how people choose their <b>transportation</b> <b>mode</b> and use the data of the survey to help KCRC to boost up the passenger amount of West Rail. The research examines how residents in West New Territories choose their <b>transportation</b> <b>mode</b> between West Rail and bus. It is found that the inconvenient stations and the need of interchanging with other means of transport {{are the most important}} reasons of passengers of not travel by West Rail. Low income people are the more prefer to travel by West Rail than high income people. Also Tin Shui Wai and Yuen Long District residents are more willing to travel by West Rail than Tuen Mun District residents. Based on the findings of the research, KCRC is suggested to issue West Rail one month pass and festival pass continuously and enhance the feeder service. Residents in different district are also suggested to choose different <b>transportation</b> <b>mode</b> so that they can save both time and money in their journey...|$|R
40|$|Rooted in the {{philosophy}} of point- and segment-based approaches for <b>transportation</b> <b>mode</b> segmentation of trajectories, the measures that researchers have adopted to evaluate the quality of the results (1) are incomparable across approaches, hence slowing the progress in the field and (2) do not provide insight about the quality of the continuous <b>transportation</b> <b>mode</b> segmentation. To address these problems, this paper proposes new error measures that can be applied to measure how well a continuous <b>transportation</b> <b>mode</b> segmentation model performs. The error measures introduced are based on aligning multiple inferred continuous intervals to ground truth intervals, and measure the cardinality of the alignment and the spatial and temporal discrepancy between the corresponding aligned segments. The utility of this new way of computing errors is shown by evaluating the segmentation of three generic <b>transportation</b> <b>mode</b> segmentation approaches (implicit, explicit–holistic, and explicit–consensus-based transport mode segmentation), which can be implemented in a thick client architecture. Empirical evaluations on a large real-word data set reveal the superiority of explicit–consensus-based transport mode segmentation, which {{can be attributed to the}} explicit modeling of segments and transitions, which allows for a meaningful decomposition of the complex learning task.

40|$|AbstractGPS {{technology}} {{was used in}} person trip (PT) survey since mid- 1990, and this technology achieved its popularity because of the improvement of accuracy and portability of GPS device. Although GPS data could provide precise spatiotemporal information of vehicular or personal movements, the <b>transportation</b> <b>mode</b> (in the case of personal movements with wearable GPS devices) and trip purpose are unable to {{be obtained from the}} GPS directly. In addition, the GPS data error identification and the trip segment from the continuous GPS data are quite fundamental to <b>transportation</b> <b>mode</b> identification and trip purpose inference. In this paper, we summarized the methodologies and input variables utilized to segment trip, infer trip purpose as well as identify <b>transportation</b> <b>mode</b> in the existing researches. Compared to probability method and criteria-based method, Machine Learning are often applied in detecting <b>transportation</b> <b>mode.</b> On the other hand, rules-based methods are more popular than probabilistic method and machine learning as the tool for inferring the trip purpose. Finally, researches attempting to utilize the data from accelerometer which are popularly integrated in smartphones demonstrates the potential of more accurate personal trip data derivation from smartphones can be achieved with much less burden on the respondents in the future...|$|R

40|$|The wide {{adoption}} of location-enabled devices, {{together with the}} acceptance of services that leverage (personal) data as payment, allows scientists to push {{through some of the}} previous barriers imposed by data insufficiency, ethics and privacy skepticism. The research problems whose study require hard-to-obtain data (e. g. <b>transportation</b> <b>mode</b> detection, service contextualisation, etc.) have now become more accessible to scientists because of the availability of data collecting outlets. One such problem is the detection of a user's <b>transportation</b> <b>mode.</b> Different fields have approached the problem of <b>transportation</b> <b>mode</b> detection with different aims: Location-Based Services (LBS) is a field that focuses on understanding the <b>transportation</b> <b>mode</b> in real-time, <b>Transportation</b> Science is a field that focuses on measuring the daily travel patterns of individuals or groups of individuals, and Human Geography is a field that focuses on enriching a trajectory by adding domain-specific semantics. While different fields providing solutions to the same problem could be viewed as a positive outcome, it is difficult to compare these solutions because the reported performance indicators depend on the type of approach and its aim (e. g. the real-time availability of LBS requires the performance to be computed on each classified location). The contributions of this paper are three fold. First, the paper reviews the critical aspects desired by each research field when providing solutions to the <b>transportation</b> <b>mode</b> detection problem. Second, it proposes three dimensions that separate three branches of science based on their main interest. Finally, it identifies important gaps in research and future directions, that is, proposing: widely accepted error measures meaningful for all disciplines, methods robust to new data sets and a benchmark data set for performance validation.
