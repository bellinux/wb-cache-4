50|$|Entomologist Julian R. Yates III of the University of Hawaii at Manoa {{describes}} {{the life cycle}} of X. sonorina in Hawaii:Having located a suitable piece of wood, the female bee begins to excavate a single tunnel in preparation for egg laying. Because of our tropical climate, egg laying by female carpenter bees occurs year-round although it may decline during the winter months, when the weather is worse. Before laying eggs, the female collects pollen and deposits it, {{in the form of a}} ball, in the tunnel at a point furthest from the entrance. She lays a single egg on the pollen ball and seals both in a chamber with wood shavings. She may lay several eggs, each on its own pollen ball and inside its own sealed chamber, in a series within the tunnel. The eggs hatch in two to three days. The larvae develop in approximately two weeks. The prepupal (nonfeeding larvae) and pupal stages take about three to four weeks to reach adulthood. <b>Teneral</b> (<b>adult</b> shortly after emergence, when it is not entirely hardened or not of the mature color) females are fed by the mother. They are capable of buzzing in about a week, and of flight in approximately two to three weeks. A single female in a tunnel may be joined later by her offspring or other bees. Only one female will collect pollen, prepare cells, and lay eggs, however. Other females perform guard and nest-cleaning duties.|$|E

50|$|Pollen slants {{are created}} when X. pubescens young are {{beginning}} to emerge. Upon arrival from a foraging trip, the female, carrying nectar and/or pollen, proceeds {{to the end of}} the tunnel. She then releases the pollen from her hind tibiae by repeated vigorous movements, creating or adding to an existing pollen slant. Nectar is used to wet the pollen slant either by licking the surface after returning from a foraging trip, or by mixing. Unlike their close relative X. sulcatipes, who gather pollen first by many trips and then add nectar later, X. pubescens adds nectar to the pollen slant as it is being formed. These pollen slants are quickly consumed by emerging young and <b>teneral</b> <b>adults,</b> who then must rely on pollen collection by the mother from foraging trips. Competition between the young for food ensues, leading to guarding behavior. About 10 pollen trips by the mother are required per brood cell, in addition to the pollen required by <b>teneral</b> <b>adults</b> and guards in the nest. Developed bees consume about the same amount of food as larvae.|$|R

The larval stage comprised 80 % of the generation time (egg to <b>teneral</b> <b>adult)</b> and analysis of head-capsule widths disclosed 3 larval instars. The mean survivorship within broods was 56. 0 % after 70 days; the reproductive success of monogamous pairs of beetles was 36. 1 teneral adults. Single females constructed 34 egg tunnels/gallery system; hence, harem size cannot always be inferred from the number of egg tunnels in each gallery.

The study was conducted from February to November 2003 {{on the campus of}} the Universidade Estadual de Campinas, state of Sao Paulo, southeastern Brazil. There was a strong positive correlation between the relative abundance of host tree species and their respective frequency of occupation by C. sivorii, suggesting that trees were used according to their availability in the study site. The phenology of C. sivorii is seasonal, with nymphs peaking in May and October, and <b>teneral</b> <b>adults</b> peaking in February, June, and October. The factors determining the variation in population density in psocopterans are poorly understood, but our data show that climatic variables, such as rainfall and temperature do not influence the phenology of C. sivorii. The individuals of C sivorii remain together through the entire nymphal phase, resting, moving on the tree surface (mainly on bark, but occasionally on leaf petioles) and grazing in groups. <b>Teneral</b> <b>adults</b> within an aggregation usually dispersed a few days after molting. Nearly 50 % of the aggregations had up to 90 individuals, but large groups presenting 240 individuals or more were also frequent, comprising 10 % of all aggregations found in the field.

Our studies demonstrate the regular association of RPPB and yeasts with the plant - on egg chamber and pupal case walls - and the insect cuticle during oviposition, larval and pupal steps. By dissecting we also demonstrated the occurrence of microorganisms either in larval or adult RPW gut or into the female reproductive apparatus lumina. Dissecting the reproductive apparatus of ready-to-ecdysis female pupae revealed them to be devoid of microorganisms. The latter are re-acquired while <b>teneral</b> <b>adult</b> females rest 3 - 5 days in their pupal cases. A first metabolomics study by GC HFTOF MS to the compounds resulting from anaerobic one-larva breeding revealed high EtOH levels, and several other classes of compounds probably resulting from microorganism’s metabolism.

40|$|The {{population}} {{dynamics of the}} rubber plantation litter beetle, Luprops tristis Fabricius 1801 (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) was assessed {{in relation to the}} phenology of leaf shedding and defoliation pattern of para rubber trees, Hevea brasiliensis Müll. Arg (Malpighiales: Euphorbiaceae), during a two year study period. The abundance of adults, larvae and pupae per 1 m 2 of litter sample was recorded. Post dormancy beetles appeared in leaf litter following annual leaf shedding, whereas larvae, pupae and teneral adults were present after leaf flush. No stages were recorded from plantations following the summer rains until the annual litter fall in the next season. Parental adults peaked at the time of leaf sprouting and tender leaf fall. Larvae and teneral adults peaked at the time of premature fall of green leaves and flowers. Teneral adults of six age classes were recorded and all entered dormancy irrespective of the feeding time available to each age class. Females outnumbered males in the parent generation, while the sex ratio of new generation adults was not biased towards either sex. The phenological stages of rubber trees included leaf fall in late December and early January, leaf sprouting and new leaf production in January and flowering in February. All feeding stages of L. tristis peaked in abundance when premature leaves are most abundant in the leaf litter. Prediction of the timing of appearance of various developmental stages of L. tristis in plantations, invasion into buildings and intensity of population build up in rubber belts is possible by tracking the phenology of leaf fall in rubber plantations, time of return of post dormancy adults and the onset of summer rainfall. Perfect synchrony was recorded between the field return of parental adults with annual leaf shedding, the oviposition phase of parental adults with tender leaf fall at the time of leaf sprouting, and larval and <b>teneral</b> <b>adult</b> stages with premature fall of leaves. Premature leaf availability is suggested as contributing to the reproductive efficiency of parental adults, the survival of early developmental stages and of new generation adults during dormancy...|$|E

40|$|Paropsis charybdis Stål (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), misidentified as P. dilatata Er. before 1963, seriously defoliates some Eucalyptus {{species in}} New Zealand. This study {{investigated}} the life history and phenology, behaviour, growth and development, population dynamics and host-plant interactions of P. charybdis, emphasising those aspects likely to affect biological control programmes. P. charybdis in the central North Island had a bivoltine life history. Adults diapaused during winter. Low temperatures and probably changes in foliage characteristics were sufficient for induction of diapause but no single factor was necessary. Adults emerged in spring to lay eggs. Young Eucalyptus foliage was necessary for oviposition. Activity of adults was increased {{in the presence of}} volatiles from E. viminalis leaves but did not differ significantly between mature and young leaf treatments. Egg-laying ceased in midsummer but this was not caused by lack of new growth, nor by high defoliation. The pattern of abundance in summer was driven by oviposition and temperature and enhanced by intra-specific competition among early instars. Density-dependent mortality occurred between eggs and 4 th instars during the second generation and appeared to result from intra-specific competition for new growth. This was also the key stage that caused variation in summer morality. Egg survival rates were 93 - 99 %. Survival between eclosion and establishment of 1 st instars on new foliage averaged 45 % and was independent of density in an experiment where food was in excess. Mortality of the pre-pupal to <b>teneral</b> <b>adult</b> stages in die soil was 90 %, but was independent of density in both generations. Development rate-temperature relationships were described for larvae fed E. viminalis young adult foliage, and for eggs and pupae. A method was developed for minimising differences in duration among larvae grown at different temperatures, so that the effects of changes in food quality were obviated. The method appears widely applicable for development-rate studies. Defoliation in a five-year old plantation of Eucalyptus nitens was almost twice as severe in the second P. charybdis generation as in the first. Shoot growth was significantly correlated with rainfall and defoliation intensity. There was a strong inverse relationship between defoliation intensity and deviations from the seasonal trend in rainfall...|$|E

During the study period, 1985 - 1988, soil samples of 350 cm³ were effective for collecting immature MFB. Sifting soil samples through screens was effective for estimating post-feeding third instar, prepupae, pupae, and <b>teneral</b> <b>adult</b> MFB in the soil. Berlese funnel extraction {{was the most}} effective method for estimating MFB larvae from peppermint rhizomes. Results of Iwao's (1968) patchiness regression indicated that MFB have an aggregated spatial distribution in the field. Aggregation could {{be influenced by the}} original deposition of MFB eggs and by agronomic practices on peppermint in central Oregon. Yearly accumulation of degree-days was more effective to predict immature MFB development than either calendar dates or twenty-year degree-day averages. Degree-days were calculated using the Baskerville Emin single sine method and a lower development threshold of 5 °C. In the _ rhizomes initial detection of first instar MFB were observed at 226 degreedays, initial detection of second instar MFB were observed at 319 degree-days and initial detection of third instar MFB were observed at 433 degree-days. In the soil initial detection of prepupae MFB were observed at 582 degree-days, initial detection of pupae were observed at 757 degree-days and initial detection of teneral adults were observed at 864 degree-days. Initial detection of first instar MFB was considered to be an approximation of egg hatch. Results also suggested that the climatic station closest to where developmental predictions are to be made should be used. Of the registered insecticides tested, oxamyl, fonofos and chlorpyrifos provided significant control of immature MFB. Degree-days provided a more reliable method for timing insecticide applications than calendar dates and allowed early treatment in the spring prior to significant damage to the peppermint rhizomes. Two species of entomogenous nematodes, Heterorhabditis heliothidis and Neoaplectana carpocapsae effectively controlled third instar, prepupae and pupae MFB in the soil during early June. However, early spring applications may not be effective because of the cold temperatures, small size of the larvae, and their concealment in the rhizomes...|$|E

Standard metabolic rate (144 - 635 μW) was generally within 22 % of previous estimates, though lower than the values found using closed system respirometry. There {{was no significant difference between}} the genders, but metabolic rate increased consistently with age, probably owing to flight muscle development. Repeatability of metabolic rate was generally high (r= 0. 6 - 0. 9), but not in younger <b>teneral</b> <b>adults</b> and pregnant females (r≈ 0. 05 - 0. 4). In these individuals, low repeatability values are a consequence of muscle or in utero larval development. Tsetse and other flies generally have a much higher metabolic rate, for a given size, than do other insect species investigated to date. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Articl...|$|R
40|$|In West Africa, M and S {{molecular}} {{forms of}} Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (Diptera: Culicidae) Giles, frequently occur together, although with different population bionomics. The S form typically breeds in rain-dependant water collections and is present {{during the rainy}} season only whereas the M form can thrive all year long in areas with permanent breeding opportunities. In the present study, we explored physiological and developmental trade-offs at play in laboratory colonies and field populations of the M and S forms that originated from an area of sympatry in Burkina Faso, where M and S larvae exhibit such habitat segregation. In the laboratory, larvae of the M form developed slower than the S form (mean values 9. 51 and 8. 85 days, respectively, Wilcoxon's test, P < 0. 001). Although wing length and dry weight at emergence showed large variations, M females were on average 8 % heavier than S females of similar wing length. Higher nutritional reserves (proteins and lipids) in <b>teneral</b> <b>adults</b> explained part of this weight difference, reflecting a better ability of the M form to garner resources at the larval stage. Furthermore, a higher rate of ovarian maturation was observed in the M form after a single bloodmeal. The relevance of these findings for parasite transmission is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{life history}} and host {{range of the}} lantana beetle, Alagoasa extrema, a {{potential}} biocontrol agent for Lantana spp. were investigated in a quarantine unit at the Alan Fletcher Research Station, Brisbane, Australia. Adults feed on leaves and females lay batches of about 17 eggs on the soil surface around the stems of plants. The eggs take 16 days to hatch and newly emerged larvae move up the stem to feed on young leaves. Larvae feed for about 23 days and there are three instars. There is a prepupal non-feeding stage that lasts about 12 days and the pupal stage, which occurs in a cocoon in the soil, lasts 16 days. <b>Teneral</b> <b>adults</b> remain in the cocoon for 3 days to harden prior to emergence. Males live for about 151 days while females live for about 127 days. The pre-oviposition period is 19 days. In no-choice larval feeding trials, nine plant species, representing three families, supported development to adult. Three species, Aloysia triphylla, Citharexylum spinosum and Pandorea pandorana were able to support at least two successive generations. These results confirm those reported in South Africa and suggest that A. extrema is not sufficiently specific for release in Australia. Furthermore, it is not recommended for release in any other country which is considering biological control of lantana...|$|R
40|$|Nine genera and 30 {{species of}} Hydrobiini and 3 genera and 12 species of Hydrophilini {{were found in}} Wisconsin, {{including}} a new species of Laccobius. Life cycles of all species of lentic Hydrobiini were similar; adults overwinter in terrestrial habitats, return to aquatic sites in spring to mate, oviposit adjacent to these sites, and eventually die. The riparian larvae complete development, pupate, and emerge sometime during the summer depending on the species and habitat, and <b>teneral</b> <b>adults</b> disperse to suitable aquatic habitats. Adults enter overwintering sites in late summer or early autumn. Lotic species of Cymbiodyta have a similar life cycle, with larvae probably developing along stream banks. Other lotic species, Crenitis digesta, Hydrobius melaenus, and Sperchopsis tessellata, apparently are semivoltine with both larvae and adults overwintering along margins of streams. In Hydrophilini, life cycles of Hydrochara and Hydrophilus {{are the same as}} described above for lentic Hydrobiini, except larvae are aquatic, developing in lentic habitats. Life cycles of Tropisternus also differ in having aquatic larvae; they differ further in having adults that overwinter in aquatic habitats, especially streams, deep ponds, and lakes, which they enter in late summer and autumn. Tropisternus ellipticus is lotic, with larvae and adults inhabiting streams, and larvae completing development in mid-summer. Keys to species of adults are included along with information about each species, which includes distribution and abundance in Wisconsin, range in North America, habitat, life cycle, and notes on identification...|$|R
40|$|Background: A life-shortening {{strain of}} the obligate {{intracellular}} bacteria Wolbachia, called wMelPop, {{is seen as a}} promising new tool for the control of Aedes aegypti. However, developing a vector control strategy based on the release of mosquitoes transinfected with wMelPop requires detailed knowledge of the demographics of the target population. Methodology/Principal Findings: In Tri Nguyen village (611 households) on Hon Mieu Island in central Vietnam, we conducted nine quantitative entomologic surveys over 14 months to determine if Ae. aegypti populations were spatially and temporally homogenous, and to estimate population size. There was no obvious relationship between mosquito (larval, pupal or adult) abundance and temperature and rainfall, and no area of the village supported consistently high numbers of mosquitoes. In almost all surveys, key premises produced high numbers of Ae. aegypti. However, these premises were not consistent between surveys. For an intervention based on a single release of wMelPop-infected Ae. aegypti, release ratios of infected to uninfected adult mosquitoes of all age classes are estimated to be 1. 8 – 6. 7 : 1 for gravid females (and similarly aged males) or <b>teneral</b> <b>adults,</b> respectively. We calculated that adult female mosquito abundance in Tri Nguyen village could range from 1. 1 to 43. 3 individuals of all age classes per house. Thus, an intervention could require the release of 2 – 78 wMelPop-infected gravid females and similarly aged males per house, or 7 – 290 infected teneral female and male mosquitoes per house...|$|R
40|$|In deep cave {{areas with}} loose {{substrate}} and sufficient moisture, the life history of Neaphaenops tellkampfii (Coleoptera: Carabidae, Trechinae) is synchronized with the seasonal pattern of its primary food sources, {{the eggs and}} first instar nymphs of the cave cricket Hadenoecus subterraneus (Orthoptera Gryllacridoidea, Rhaphidophoridae). Neaphaenops reproduction coincides with {{an order of magnitude}} increase in Hadenoecus egg input in the spring. Our 46 observations of predation by Neaphaenops suggest some switching to other cave animals as cricket egg and first instar nymph densities decrease during the summer. Neaphaenops life history in areas of Hadenoecus egg input is as follows: (1) female Neaphaenops reach maximum fecundity {{at the time of the}} maximum density of fìrst instar Hadenoecus nymphs; (2) early instar Neaphaenops larvae appear in late summer and fall; (3) last instar Neaphaenops larvae appear in early spring and pupation occurs shortly thereafter; (4) lightly coloured <b>teneral</b> <b>adults</b> emerge two to three months later, a time consistent with laboratory estimates of the length of the pupal stage. Seasonal changes in sex ratio due to differential mortality appear to be consistent with this seasonal pattern. A comparison of Neaphaenops with two other species of carabid cricket egg predators suggests the importance of seasonal food abundance in determining life history seasonality. Darlingtonea kentuckensis has a food resource pattern which appears identical to that of Neaphaenops, and the life history seasonality is also parallel. Rhadine subterranea, however, seems to have a much more equitable food input throughout the year, and appears to have an aseasonal life history...|$|R
