The area of each glacier has been mapped for decades by the National Park Service and the U.S. Geological Survey. Comparing photographs from the mid-19th century with contemporary images provides ample evidence that they have retreated notably since 1850. Repeat photography since clearly show that glaciers such as Grinnell Glacier are all retreating. The larger glaciers are now approximately {{a third of their}} former size when first studied in 1850, and numerous smaller glaciers have disappeared completely. Only 27% of the [...] area of Glacier National Park covered by glaciers in 1850 remained covered by 1993.

500|$|Arthur R. Marshall led {{the efforts}} to undo the damage. According to Douglas, Marshall was {{successful}} in portraying the Everglades from the Kissimmee Chain of Lakes to Florida Bayincluding the atmosphere, climate, and limestoneas a single organism. Rather than remaining the preserve of conservation organizations, the cause of restoring the Everglades became a priority for politicians. Douglas observed, [...] "Marshall accomplished the extraordinary magic of taking the Everglades out of the bleeding-hearts category forever". At the insistent urging of Marshall, newly elected Governor Bob Graham announced {{the formation of the}} [...] "Save Our Everglades" [...] campaign in 1983, and in 1985 Graham lifted the first shovel of backfill for a portion of the C-38 canal. Within a year the area was covered with water returning to its original state. Graham declared <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> 2000, the Everglades would resemble its predrainage state as much as possible. The Kissimmee River Restoration Project was approved by Congress in the Water Resources Development Act of 1992.

A project manager for the Army Corps of Engineers explained in 2002, [...] "What we're doing on this scale is going to be taken to a larger scale when we do the restoration of the Everglades".
