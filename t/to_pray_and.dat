5|$|According to a survivor, Nada Požega from Slavonia, the {{children}} were forced {{to go to church}} <b>to</b> <b>pray,</b> <b>and</b> were required to greet others with the Ustaše greeting Spremni (Ready) or the Nazi salute Heil Hitler. Those children that failed to do so were punished by the Ustaše guards with either a beating or solitary confinement. Požega further stated the nuns did not treat {{the children}} with sympathy or care. Another survivor, Mihajlo Veljić, recalled that the barracks were fenced with barbed wire, and that they slept on the floor covered with straw. He stated that the Ustaše tried to convert the children to Catholicism. He personally feared a nun, Sister Mercedes, but all the children feared Pulherija.|$|E
5|$|Baron Yamaki (Sessue Hayakawa) is a {{fisherman}} who lives {{along with his}} daughter Toya San (Tsuru Aoki) on an island. The island is inhabited by Buddhists and Yamaki had been cursed by Buddha for an affront {{by one of his}} ancestors who in a murderous rage, defiled an altar of Buddha in the nearby temple. The curse was that if his daughter married anyone, then the nearby volcano would erupt. Toya finds it difficult to form relationships with boys because the village prophet Takeo (Thomas Kurihara) has spread the rumour that she is cursed. She is therefore unwilling to continue her father's acceptance of the curse. When Yamaki takes Toya-san to the Buddha shrine in the garden of his house <b>to</b> <b>pray</b> <b>and</b> try to get the curse removed, she vents her feelings about the god's unfairness.|$|E

5|$|One day, {{following}} {{a flash of}} light, the stone {{at the base of}} the Mana Tree cracks, distorting time and space. The hero recalls that their friend Tess, who is a priestess, went to the Mana Tower <b>to</b> <b>pray,</b> <b>and</b> goes to find her. After reaching the tower with an Elemental in tow, the hero finds the tower is infested with monsters. Upon fighting their way to the top of the tower, the hero finds Tess, frightened but unharmed. Suddenly, a giant flaming bird descends upon the two. The hero attempts to fight it, but finds that the bird is protected by a barrier. A sword then falls from the sky, causing the bird's shield to fade away and allowing the hero to slay the beast. When the bird is defeated, a mysterious man garbed in black appears and attempts to take the Holy Sword, which is still stuck in the ground, but is prevented by the appearance of a barrier when he tries. The man disappears, and the hero attempts to grab the sword. No barrier appears to prevent them, and they take what turns out to be the fabled Sword of Mana.|$|E

25|$|The crypt {{is located}} {{just under the}} Church of Santa Maria della Concezione in Rome, a church {{commissioned}} by Pope Urban VIII in 1626. The pope's brother, Cardinal Antonio Barberini, who was of the Capuchin Order, in 1631 ordered the remains of thousands of Capuchin friars exhumed and transferred from the friary on the Via dei Lucchesi to the crypt. The bones were arranged along the walls in varied designs, and the friars began to bury their own dead here, {{as well as the}} bodies of poor Romans, whose tomb was under the floor of the present Mass chapel. Here the Capuchins would come <b>to</b> <b>pray</b> <b>and</b> reflect each evening before retiring for the night.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to prior governments, which emphasised divisions of caste and religion, Nitish Kumar's manifesto {{was based on}} economic development, curbs on crime and corruption and greater social equality for all sections of society. Since 2010, the government has confiscated the properties of corrupt officials and redeployed them as schools buildings. Simultaneously they introduced Bihar Special Court Act to curb crime. It has also legislated for a two-hour break on Fridays, including lunch, to enable Muslim employees <b>to</b> <b>pray</b> <b>and</b> thus cut down on post-lunch absenteeism by them. The government has prohibited the sale and consumption of alcohol in the state since March 2016; this ban {{has been linked to}} a drop in tourism to Bihar.|$|E
25|$|The shared {{beliefs of}} Orthodoxy, and its theology, exist within the Holy Tradition and cannot be {{separated}} from it, for their meaning is not expressed in mere words alone. Doctrine cannot be understood unless it is prayed. To be a theologian, one must know how <b>to</b> <b>pray,</b> <b>and</b> one who prays in spirit and in truth becomes a theologian by doing so. Doctrine must also be lived {{in order to be}} prayed, for without action, the prayer is idle and empty, a mere vanity, and therefore the theology of demons. According to these teachings of the ancient church, no superficial belief can ever be orthodox. Similarly, reconciliation and unity are not superficial, but are prayed and lived out.|$|E

In the following 30 years a few hundreds came to Palestine. Most of them were animated by religious motives; they came <b>to</b> <b>pray</b> <b>and</b> to die in the Holy Land, and to be buried in its soil. After the persecutions in Russia forty years ago, the movement of the Jews to Palestine assumed larger proportions. Jewish agricultural colonies were founded. They developed the culture of oranges and gave importance to the Jaffa orange trade. They cultivated the vine, and manufactured and exported wine. They drained swamps. They planted eucalyptus trees. They practised, with modern methods, all the processes of agriculture. There are at the present time 64 of these settlements, large and small, with a population of some 15,000.|$|E

In 1931, he established the Haifa branch of the Arab Bank.
