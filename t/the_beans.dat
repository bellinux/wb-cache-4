5|$|Maraba's coffee {{plants are}} the Bourbon {{variety of the}} Coffea arabica species and are grown on fertile {{volcanic}} soils on high-altitude hills. The fruit is handpicked, mostly {{during the rainy season}} between March and May, and brought to a washing station in Maraba, where the coffee beans are extracted and dried. At several stages, <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> are sorted according to quality. The farmers receive credits based on the amount and quality of <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> they provide.|$|E

5|$|The {{technicians}} {{start the}} washing process immediately, since delay can cause fermentation of the sugary coating surrounding the bean and ruination {{of the coffee}} flavour. <b>The</b> <b>beans</b> are first thrown into a deep tank. The best cherries sink {{to the bottom and}} pass through a machine that removes their skin. The technicians remove any floating cherries and process them {{in the same way as}} the others for the cooperative to sell on the domestic market for less than specialty-coffee price. <b>The</b> <b>beans</b> are fed through one of the cooperative's three de-skinning and selection machines to remove their skins and most of the sugary coating before running the individual beans through a vibrating colander. The colander separates the very highest quality Grade A beans from those labeled Grade B; the two grades are sent separately down the hill in a water chute with a 1 percent gradient. This process allows for further separation of beans based on quality, with around 15 tanks available at the bottom for capture of the different types. <b>The</b> <b>beans</b> are kept submerged, two days for the best and 15–20 hours for the lesser beans, which causes a small amount of fermentation to convert the remainder of the sugar without significantly impairing the flavour.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess the current status of cross-border bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) marketing patterns in the border districts of Kenya and Uganda, with a view to improving the marketing system in <b>the</b> region. Common <b>bean</b> is <b>the</b> most important pulse in Kenya and Uganda. It is a major source of food and income. Smallholder farmers in both countries have adopted improved bean varieties. However, there is inadequate empirical evidence on <b>the</b> <b>bean</b> grain characteristics preferred by consumers, the geographical distribution of <b>the</b> <b>bean</b> cultivars and <b>the</b> marketing patterns. The objectives of this study were to identify and assess <b>the</b> <b>bean</b> marketing channels and structure in the study area. It was hypothesised that there are no barriers to entry in <b>the</b> <b>bean</b> business in <b>the</b> study area. Purposive, multistage and systematic random sampling methods were used to select <b>the</b> study districts, <b>bean</b> farmers and traders, respectively. Two hundred and ten respondents were interviewed using structured questionnaires. Structure–conduct–performance (S-C-P) model was used to describe <b>the</b> <b>bean</b> marketing system. <b>The</b> study revealed four marketing channels in both Kenya and Uganda. The degree of concentration at the retail and wholesale levels show that the markets are competitive. There are barriers to entry into <b>the</b> <b>bean</b> business in <b>the</b> study area. No collusive or predatory tactics were observed in <b>the</b> <b>bean</b> marketing system. However, the study revealed that there is poor market information flow in the marketing system...|$|R
5|$|Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine is the Westernized {{release of}} the puzzle game Puyo Puyo and replaces all of its {{characters}} with those from the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. The entirety of gameplay takes place across two grid-based boards: the left board {{is used by the}} player, while the right board is controlled by either artificial intelligence or a second player, depending on the game mode. The main objective of the game is to earn as many points as possible by grouping the same coloured beans together as they fall down on the board. The player must arrange beans into groups of at least four of the same colour; should they do this, <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> in the group will disappear and points will be accumulated. If the player drops a group of beans on an uneven surface, any bean left hanging will separate from the original group and will drop to the lowest point on the board. The player may also flip a group of falling beans horizontally or vertically.|$|E

25|$|The {{degree of}} roast {{has an effect}} upon coffee flavor and body. Darker roasts are {{generally}} bolder because they have less fiber content and a more sugary flavor. Lighter roasts have a more complex and therefore perceived stronger flavor from aromatic oils and acids otherwise destroyed by longer roasting times.

25|$|Processing {{of coffee}} in India is {{accomplished}} using two methods, dry processing and wet processing. Dry processing is the traditional method of drying in the sun which is favoured for its flavour producing characteristics. In the wet processing method, coffee beans are fermented and washed, which is the preferred method for improved yields. As to the wet processing, <b>the</b> <b>beans</b> are subject to cleaning to segregate defective seeds. <b>The</b> <b>beans</b> of different varieties and sizes are then blended to derive the best flavour. The next procedure is to roast either through roasters or individual roasters. Then the roasted coffee is ground to appropriate sizes.|$|E
