5|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{of popular}} and {{government}} interest {{at the time}} in quantum mechanics – the American government was financing research at SRI into telepathy – and physicists able to understand it found themselves in demand. The Fundamental Fysiks Group used ideas from quantum physics, particularly Bell's theorem and quantum entanglement, to explore issues such as action at a distance, clairvoyance, precognition, remote viewing and psychokinesis.|$|E
5|$|Fincher {{realized}} that {{his job was to}} dispel the mythic stature the case had taken on over the years by clearly defining what was fact and what was fiction. He told Vanderbilt that he wanted the screenplay re-written but with additional research done from the original police reports. Fincher found that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of speculation and hearsay and wanted to interview people directly involved in the case in person to see if he believed what they were telling him. Fincher did this because he felt a burden of responsibility in making a film that convicted someone posthumously.|$|E

Sheeley {{comments in}} his conclusion: [...] "GURPS Illuminati {{is one of}} this season's bestsellers for Steve Jackson Games, outselling even their masterpiece, Hacker. This {{is not to say}} that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people out there who buy the conspiracy theory, or that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of gamers wanting to actually play the game of paranoia ... More likely, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of people who appreciate a good product and a funny read." ...|$|R
5000|$|McCracken {{also said}} about the music: [...] "There’s <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of hip-hop influence, beats and drum and bass kind of stuff, but it’s also still a The Used record, by all means. Just like any other Used record, it’s a horse of many colors: <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of soft and heavy sounds, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of brutal, sharp, bright sounds, and the tempos are {{anywhere}} from ultra-slow to super fast and heavy. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of different conceptual feelings on the record." ...|$|R

5|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{of tension}} between Duyet and Minh Mạng. Although Gia Long had enlisted European support {{to claim the}} throne and allowed missionaries to {{function}} in Vietnam in gratitude to Pigneau, he ran a classical Confucian administration. He also expressed dismay at the Catholic condemnation of the traditional ancestral worship, a basic tenet of Vietnamese culture; Crown Prince Cảnh had been converted by Pigneau and subsequently refused to bow down to his ancestors, instead desecrating a shrine with feces.|$|E
5|$|I {{realized}} {{that for a}} long time I had been holding onto this whole dogma of nonracism almost like a religion... But in the course of that debate I began to feel <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> lacking in the proponents of the nonracist idea... they had this problem, you know, of superiority, and they tended to take us for granted and wanted us to accept things that were second-class. They could not see why we could not consider staying in that church, and I began to feel that our understanding of our own situation in this country was not coincidental with that of these liberal whites.|$|E
5|$|In Grenland, the {{metropolitan}} area surrounding Skien, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of opposition to the airline, and several local businesspeople claimed {{that it would be}} better if Norsk Air was awarded the contract, or Skien Airport was closed and locals instead used the nearby Sandefjord Airport, Torp. Norsk Air stated that it would not be possible for them to make money on the Skien–Oslo route; despite that, it operated from Skien to Bergen Airport, Flesland and Stavanger Airport, Sola. In 1993, Norsk Air announced that it would no longer fly from Skien, and would focus all their operations at Sandefjord. Teddy Air subsequently took over the Stavanger route, while the Bergen route was granted to Air Stord, despite Teddy Air having applied for the concession. In 1994, the company had a revenue of NOK7.5 million, and a NOK1 million profit.|$|E

5|$|Macrae, Ismay and Churchill all saw fit {{to record}} these {{arguments}} over the technical issue of stickiness. As Eden had pointed out, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> at stake. The British infantry and Home Guard had little {{with which to}} put up a fight against tanks and to any who had witnessed trials of Molotov Cocktails and SIP grenades it was evident that they could do little to a modern tank other than to provide a blinding pall of smoke. What was needed was a hand weapon to deliver a coup de grâce by punching through the armoured plate. The sticky bomb could do the job and little else was available.|$|E
5|$|Also in 2003, {{courts in}} the Netherlands {{prevented}} the distribution of a Dutch translation of Tanya Grotter and the Magical Double Bass, the first of Dmitri Yemets' popular Russian series about a female apprentice wizard. Rowling and her publishers sued, arguing that the Grotter books violate copyright law. Yemets and his original Moscow-based publishers, Eksmo, argued that the books constitute a parody, permitted under copyright. The Dutch courts ruled that the books did not constitute parody and thus {{were not allowed to}} be sold in the Netherlands. Later that year, as the Dutch translation Tanja Grotter en de magische contrabas was still legal in Belgium, the Flemish publishers Roularta Books decided to print 1,000 copies (and no more) in order to let people decide whether it was plagiarism, hoping that under those circumstances Rowling and her publishers would not sue. Rowling did not sue, but as <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of interest in the book (Dutch people could buy the book by postal order from another Flemish publisher, Boekhandel VanIn) it was soon sold out. The books continue to be published in Russia and have spawned several sequels.|$|E
5|$|On 14 November 2007, it was {{announced}} that former EastEnders scriptwriter Tony Jordan had been contacted by Controller of BBC Drama Production John Yorke with an idea for an episode and that Jordan had returned to EastEnders having written the script for the episode. The single-hander episode {{was announced}} the next day, the first episode of any soap opera to feature just one character. Jordan had wanted to write a solo episode for EastEnders – well known for its two-hander episodes – for some time, but the opportunity had never arisen until Bardon had a stroke in real life, which was reflected in storyines when Jim was said to have suffered a stroke when visiting relatives off screen. Cast and crew were grateful for the opportunity to make the episode but were aware it had come about due to the suffering of somebody they loved. Brown was initially sceptical that her character could carry an entire episode by herself, but stated that Dot has a lot of history so <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> to call upon.|$|E

5|$|They started {{recording}} Astraea in June at James Spence's {{house in}} Nottingham. They {{were forced into}} this situation as Sanderson's recording studio was taken from him through a contractual issue on the building with the landlord. The recording process was different from previous albums as <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of production and pre-production involved. Sanderson {{would come to the}} practice sessions of the bands and make suggestions to the songs and then they would go to record it. The album took three months to record because of band member's personal commitments, this to James Spence had a positive effect as the members took their time with the music, believing the album was more “produced” than previous efforts. James believed Rolo Tomassi had much more of an opportunity to experiment in the studio and try things they had never tried before. However, James had commented that the recording of the album in his house revealed to be a stressful decision. An example of this was were his basement- where all the recording equipment was- flooded due to heavy rainfall. Although nothing got damaged, stagnant water remained and they had to move the guitar cab to his bedroom. They recorded the drums upstairs at The Bodega in Nottingham then Rolo Tomassi then went to James and Eva Spence's parents house record the vocals, keyboard and pianos.|$|E

25|$|Kemah, Texas, about 35 miles (56km) {{south of}} Houston, was without power and water, and still had 5feet of {{flooding}} on Saturday, September 13, 2008.

25|$|The {{light crude}} oil spilled in the Mega Borg {{incident}} was brown and evaporated much quicker than the {{heavy crude oil}} in spills such as the Exxon Valdez. This means that the oil {{is less likely to}} heavily coat nearby beaches, flora and fauna, however the tanker was carrying more oil than the Exxon Valdez incident spilled in total, so <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of concern about the oil not being able to evaporate if the slick became too thick.|$|E

Apart from a half-century in the first Test at Lord's, Raina managed just 27runs from seven innings.
