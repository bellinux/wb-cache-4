40|$|Bound Infinities : Scheherazade's Moral Matrix of The 1001 Nights" is {{the first}} study that {{positions}} the multiple variants of <b>the</b> <b>Nights</b> as separate texts, and ones that should be treated in literary studies as such. This is an important notion because <b>the</b> <b>Nights</b> has long been seen as one insufficiently defined work of literature. By researching each variant on its own merits much more literary and cultural history is revealed, and new, richer understandings of postcolonial, translation and semiotic studies are highlighted. This dissertation looks {{through the lens of}} <b>the</b> <b>Nights</b> via an examination of the oldest "G-manuscript" of <b>the</b> <b>Nights</b> and its sexualized contents, paratextual amendments of <b>the</b> European <b>Nights</b> of <b>the</b> 19 th century by Edward Lane and Richard Burton, fantastical elements of <b>the</b> <b>Nights</b> of <b>the</b> 18 th century Galland version and its English translation known as "Grub Street", film versions of <b>the</b> <b>Nights</b> of <b>the</b> 20 th century, and orientalist and postcolonial theory. I argue, in part, that orientalism has been so often misapplied to <b>the</b> <b>Nights</b> that it has wrongly embedded it into a discourse that obscures its identity. I end with an examination of a modernist "version" of <b>the</b> <b>Nights</b> : James Joyce's Ulysses. My overall intent is to clarify what <b>the</b> <b>Nights</b> is, detach it from misapplied orientalist discourse, and to demand an elucidation in future Nights studies that specific versions and their idiosyncratic identities are addressed as a primary focus of any study involving <b>the</b> <b>Nights.</b> <b>The</b> study intersects with semiotics, cognitive linguistics, film studies, translation studies, psychoanalysis and postcolonial theory but its main goal is to resituate <b>the</b> <b>Nights</b> into a truly transnational context unfettered by a culturally embedded identit...|$|R

5|$|A folk {{story is}} told of Ramprasad's death. Ramprasad was very fond of taking part in Kali puja on <b>the</b> <b>night</b> of Diwali, the festival of lights.

In Kalila wa Dimna the sage Bidpai and his fables pacify King Dabshalim. In their Arabic form both books originate in the early Abbasid period, combine seriousness with mirth, cater for the 'elite' reader and have another more 'common' side, combine Arab with Persian culture and originate from Middle Persian. <b>The</b> <b>Nights</b> begins with <b>The</b> Tale of the Ox and the Ass, {{and the opening of}} Kalila wa Dimna is with The Tale of the Lion and the Ox.
