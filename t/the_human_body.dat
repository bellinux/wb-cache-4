5|$|Between 2 and 4 {{grams of}} zinc are {{distributed}} throughout <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body.</b> Most zinc {{is in the}} brain, muscle, bones, kidney, and liver, with the highest concentrations in the prostate {{and parts of the}} eye. Semen is particularly rich in zinc, a key factor in prostate gland function and reproductive organ growth.|$|E

5|$|Coenzymes {{are usually}} {{continuously}} regenerated and their concentrations maintained {{at a steady}} level inside the cell. For example, NADPH is regenerated through the pentose phosphate pathway and S-adenosylmethionine by methionine adenosyltransferase. This continuous regeneration means that small amounts of coenzymes can be used very intensively. For example, <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body</b> turns over its own weight in ATP each day.|$|E
5|$|Gargi {{inquires}} {{in chapter}} 4 {{about the nature}} of Nadis, <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body</b> and how vital airs function in it. Yajnavalkya begins his reply by asserting that the height of every adult human being is about 96 times the width of his or her Angula (thumb).|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} doubted that fast fighter {{aircraft}} could engage in dogfights. The g-force effect on <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body</b> {{also seemed to}} suggest the prospect of air-to-air combat between fighters was impractical anyway. The threat they saw related only to the return-fire of the bomber's gunners. Before the war the effectiveness of return, or cross-fire, from bombers had been exaggerated by the Air Staff and Air Ministry.|$|E
50|$|Discretionary {{food is a}} {{term for}} foods and drinks not {{necessary}} to provide <b>the</b> nutrients <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body's</b> needs, but that may add variety to a person's diet.|$|R
50|$|Challenges include {{effectively}} modeling <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body’s</b> complex {{motions and}} ensuring accurate positioning, {{given that the}} tendons are prone to stretch, which costs them strength and smooth operation.|$|R
5000|$|Major {{histocompatibility}} complex class II proteins {{are important because}} under normal function they have important responsibility in <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body's</b> immune system response, CD4+(CD8+) T-lymphocytes, receive peptide antigens from them ...|$|R
5|$|Leonardo {{started his}} {{study in the}} anatomy of <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body</b> under the {{apprenticeship}} of Andrea del Verrocchio, who demanded that his students develop a deep knowledge of the subject. As an artist, he quickly became master of topographic anatomy, drawing many studies of muscles, tendons and other visible anatomical features.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium in {{the body}} tends to {{accumulate}} in the kidneys and bones. The maximum safe dose of protactinium in <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body</b> is 0.03 µCi that corresponds to 0.5 micrograms of 231Pa. This isotope, which might {{be present in the}} air as aerosol, is 2.5 times more toxic than hydrocyanic acid.|$|E
5|$|The book {{is divided}} into five volumes. Dioscorides {{organized}} the substances by certain similarities, such as their being aromatic, or vines; these divisions do not correspond to any modern classification. In David Sutton's view the grouping is {{by the type of}} effect on <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} anatomy is {{characterized}} by a progressive understanding of the functions of the organs and structures of <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body.</b> Methods have also improved dramatically, advancing from the examination of animals by dissection of carcasses and cadavers (corpses) to 20th century medical imaging techniques including X-ray, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>human</b> <b>body</b> {{contains}} about 12mg of manganese, {{mostly in the}} bones. The soft tissue remainder is concentrated in the liver and kidneys. In the human brain, the manganese is bound to manganese metalloproteins, most notably glutamine synthetase in astrocytes.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>human</b> <b>body</b> louse Pediculus humanus humanus has (2010) the {{smallest}} insect genome known. This louse can transmit certain diseases while the human head louse (P. h. capitis), {{to which it}} is closely related, cannot. With their simple life history and small genomes, the pair make ideal model organisms to study the molecular mechanisms behind the transmission of pathogens and vector competence.|$|E

5|$|The total {{quantity}} of ATP in <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body</b> is about 0.2moles. The majority of ATP is recycled from ADP by the aforementioned processes. Thus, {{at any given}} time, {{the total amount of}} ATP + ADP remains fairly constant.|$|E
5|$|There are {{significant}} differences in airway anatomy and respiratory physiology between children and adults, and these are taken into careful consideration before performing tracheal intubation of any pediatric patient.

5|$|Titanium is {{non-toxic}} even {{in large}} doses {{and does not}} play any natural role inside <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body.</b> Zirconium powder can cause irritation, but only contact with the eyes requires medical attention. OSHA recommendations for zirconium are 5mg/m3 time weighted average limit and a 10mg/m3 short-term exposure limit. Only limited data exists on the toxicology of hafnium.|$|E
50|$|Greek Art {{emphasized}} humanism {{along with}} <b>the</b> <b>human</b> mind and <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>body’s</b> beauty.
