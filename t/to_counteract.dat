5|$|Certain {{small areas}} were left unrestored, {{in order to}} {{maintain}} a physical record of the previous restorations that had taken place, for example, an area left with overpainting and candle wax, and another area demonstrating the attempt <b>to</b> <b>counteract</b> salination with oil.|$|E
50|$|Psychological {{research}} {{in these areas}} has always been important <b>to</b> <b>counteracting</b> prejudicial attitudes and actions, and to {{the gay and lesbian}} rights movement generally.|$|R
50|$|Anti-gravity is a {{hypothetical}} force that eliminates {{the effects of}} gravity on an object (as opposed <b>to</b> <b>counteracting</b> it). The MythBusters tested various devices that claimed to produce anti-gravity.|$|R
50|$|Chlorous acid is a {{powerful}} oxidizing agent, although its tendency <b>to</b> disproportionation <b>counteracts</b> its oxidizing potential.|$|R
5|$|Holes {{and windows}} require special {{consideration}} when die casting because the perimeters {{of these features}} will grip to the die steel during solidification. <b>To</b> <b>counteract</b> this affect, generous draft should be added to hole and window features.|$|E
5|$|Metformin SR (slow release) or XR (extended release) was {{introduced}} in 2004. It is available in 500, 750, and 1000-mg strengths, mainly <b>to</b> <b>counteract</b> common gastrointestinal side effects, {{as well as to}} increase compliance by reducing pill burden. No difference in effectiveness exists between the two preparations.|$|E
5|$|Metformin {{appears to}} be safe and {{effective}} <b>to</b> <b>counteract</b> the weight gain caused by antipsychotic drugs olanzapine and clozapine. Although modest reversal of clozapine-associated weight gain is found with metformin, primary prevention of weight gain is more valuable.|$|E
40|$|Security in {{libraries}} {{is a major}} issue. The need {{to permit}} public access {{and at the same}} time protect what are often valuable resources can sometimes conflict. In this paper it is argued that it is vital to develop a holistic strategy, and one of the best ways of developing effective responses is to understand how offenders behave and target security resources <b>to</b> <b>counteracting</b> specific threats...|$|R

5000|$|Counter-sabotage, {{defined by}} Webster's Dictionary, is [...] "counterintelligence {{designed}} <b>to</b> detect and <b>counteract</b> sabotage." [...] The United States Department of Defense definition, {{found in the}} Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, is [...] "action designed <b>to</b> detect and <b>counteract</b> sabotage. See also counterintelligence".|$|R
5|$|Reactors {{that use}} lithium-7 heat water under high {{pressure}} and transfer heat through heat exchangers that {{are prone to}} corrosion. The reactors use lithium <b>to</b> <b>counteract</b> the corrosive effects of boric acid, which {{is added to the}} water to absorb excess neutrons.|$|E
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>counteract</b> these {{reactive}} oxygen species, cells contain numerous antioxidant systems, including antioxidant vitamins such as vitamin C {{and vitamin}} E, and antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidases, which detoxify the reactive species, limiting {{damage to the}} cell.|$|E
5|$|American kestrels {{are often}} useful in {{scientific}} studies on animal physiology, and are typically captured using the bal-chatri method or raised in nest boxes for experiments. Kestrel metabolic rate {{has been found}} to increase in response to rainfall, and at ambient temperatures below about 25⁰ C. Kestrel metabolic responses to weather and temperature do not vary, however, with sex. Kestrels will increase their oxygen consumption, and therefore their metabolic rate in cold and wet conditions <b>to</b> <b>counteract</b> heat loss.|$|E
25|$|Most lesbian, gay, and {{bisexual}} people who seek psychotherapy {{do so for}} the same reasons as heterosexual people (stress, relationship difficulties, difficulty adjusting to social or work situations, etc.); their sexual orientation may be of primary, incidental, or no importance to their issues and treatment. Whatever the issue, there is a high risk for anti-gay bias in psychotherapy with lesbian, gay, {{and bisexual}} clients. Psychological research in this area has been relevant <b>to</b> <b>counteracting</b> prejudicial ("homophobic") attitudes and actions, and to the LGBT rights movement generally.|$|R
40|$|Lapse rates, moist {{adiabatic}} lapse {{rates and}} the critical lapse rate for baroclinic adjustment are calculated and compared for the mean annual, January and July states in the Northern Hemisphere. The small seasonal changes in hemispheric mean lapse rates can be attributed <b>to</b> <b>counteracting</b> seasonal changes in the strength of moist convection and baroclinic eddies. A major conclusion is that the vertical temperature structure may be well approximated by a radiative-convective equilibrium model with two critical lapse rates, viz. the moist adiabatic lapse rate and the critical lapse rate for baroclinic adjustment...|$|R

5|$|As of late 2013, Wizards of the Coast has {{expressed}} {{concern over the}} increasing number of counterfeit cards in the secondary market. Wizards of the Coast has since made an effort <b>to</b> <b>counteract</b> the rise of counterfeits by introducing a new holofoil stamp on all rare and mythic rare cards as of Magic 2015.|$|E
5|$|Heat {{levels on}} the speeder must be monitored, as {{although}} there are no set top speeds for the vehicles, they can explode if allowed to overheat. Heat builds up from acceleration and from collisions. <b>To</b> <b>counteract</b> this, the player may activate the onboard cooler, however, this will slow the vehicle down. Designated cooling strips along the track and the Ice power-up can cool the vehicle without a speed penalty, allowing the player to continue accelerating.|$|E
5|$|Jōjirō is {{a first-year}} student at Hoshinoumi Academy {{and is a}} member of its student council. His ability enables him to move at very fast speeds, but he is not able to control where he stops, {{resulting}} in frequent injuries. <b>To</b> <b>counteract</b> this, he wears protective gear under his clothes. He is a huge fan of Yusa Nishimori and is extremely obsessed with her.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{compares the}} {{performance}} of anti-noise methods, particularly probabilistic and re-sampling methods, using NSGA 2. It then proposes a computationally less expensive approach <b>to</b> <b>counteracting</b> noise using re-sampling and fitness inheritance. Six problems with different difficulties are {{used to test the}} methods. The results indicate that the probabilistic approach has better convergence to the Pareto optimal front, but it looses diversity quickly. However, methods based on re-sampling are more robust against noise but they are computationally very expensive to use. The proposed fitness inheritance approach is very competitive to re-sampling methods with much lower computational cost...|$|R
5|$|Many {{species of}} poison dart frogs have {{recently}} experienced habitat loss, chytrid diseases, and collection for the pet trade. Some {{are listed as}} threatened or endangered as a result. Zoos have tried <b>to</b> <b>counteract</b> this disease by treating captive frogs with an antifungal agent {{that is used to}} cure athlete's foot in humans.|$|E
5|$|Midge Hadley is {{a fictional}} doll {{character}} in the Barbie line of toys by Mattel that was first released in 1963. Midge was created, along with Skipper, <b>to</b> <b>counteract</b> criticism that claimed Barbie was a sex symbol. She was marketed as Barbie's best friend. No Midge dolls were sold {{for the rest of}} the vintage years after the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Razor Ramon faced Jeff Jarrett at WrestleMania XI in {{a rematch}} for the WWF Intercontinental Championship. <b>To</b> <b>counteract</b> The Roadie's interference, Ramon was {{accompanied}} by his friend the 1–2–3 Kid. Ramon won the match by disqualification but did not win the title. On May 19, 1995, Ramon defeated Jarrett in a ladder match to regain the championship, but Jarrett won the belt back three days later.|$|E

50|$|Athletic {{incontinence}} (athletic leakage, athletic leaks, exercise-induced urinary incontinence) is {{the specific}} form of urinary incontinence {{that results from}} engaging in high-impact or strenuous activities. Unlike stress incontinence, which {{is defined as the}} loss of small amounts of urine associated with sneezing, laughing or exercising, athletic incontinence occurs exclusively during exercise. Athletic incontinence is generally thought {{to be the result of}} decreased structural support of the pelvic floor due to increased abdominal pressure during high-impact exercise. As such exercises that build and develop the pelvic floor may be an important step <b>to</b> <b>counteracting</b> athletic incontinence. In addition to high-impact exercise, this weakening can also stem from childbirth and age.|$|R
5|$|Regarded {{as one of}} the series' strongest Pokémon, {{it changed}} the way players {{approached}} the games by forcing them to find ways <b>to</b> <b>counteract</b> those using Mewtwo. Studies found the character popular with older male children, which contrasted with its counterpart and genetic source material, Mew. Reactions to Mewtwo's first anime portrayal have been divided; reviewers such as Daily Record cited it as a cliché villain, while others such as Animerica and Sight & Sound praised the character's depth.|$|E

5|$|Such a shell {{would have}} no net {{gravitational}} interaction with its englobed star (see shell theorem), and could drift {{in relation to the}} central star. If such movements went uncorrected, they could eventually result in a collision between the sphere and the star—most likely with disastrous results. Such structures would need either some form of propulsion <b>to</b> <b>counteract</b> any drift, or some way to repel the surface of the sphere away from the star.|$|E
50|$|The third son of Isaac Morier, {{consul-general}} to the Turkey Company at Constantinople, he {{was born}} in Smyrna on 8 January 1784, was educated at Harrow School, and entered the diplomatic service. In January 1804, at age 20, he was appointed secretary to the political mission sent by the British government to Ali Pasha and the Turkish governors of the Morea and other provinces, with a view <b>to</b> <b>counteracting</b> the influence of France in south-east Europe. In May 1807 he was ordered to take entire charge of the mission, but the continuing rupture of diplomatic relations between England and the Ottoman Empire defeated his negotiations.|$|R
60|$|A {{few minutes}} of almost desperate {{exertion}} succeeded. No men work like sailors, when the last are in a hurry, their efforts being directed <b>to</b> <b>counteracting</b> squalls, and avoiding emergencies of the most pressing character. Thus was it now with {{the crew of the}} Swash. The clanking of chains lasted but a minute, when the parts attached to the anchors were thrust through the hawse-holes, or were dropped into the water {{from other parts of the}} brig. This at once released the vessel, though a great deal remained to be done to clear her for working, and to put her in the best trim.|$|R
60|$|There is a {{strength}} of self-possession {{which is the}} sign that the last hope has departed. Despair no more leans on others than perfect contentment, and in despair pride ceases <b>to</b> be <b>counteracted</b> by the sense of dependence.|$|R
