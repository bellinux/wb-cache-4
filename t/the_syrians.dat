5|$|The Israelis {{called the}} {{reinforcements}} assuming {{this was the}} main Syrian thrust. <b>The</b> <b>Syrians</b> were not intending to carry out any further operation south of the Sea of Galilee and planned to make their main effort further north, near the Bnot Ya'akov bridge. On May 19, the Iraqis were about to drive west through Nablus toward Tulkarm, and asked <b>the</b> <b>Syrians</b> to make a diversion in the Degania area to protect their right flank. <b>The</b> <b>Syrians</b> complied, their main objective being to seize the bridge across the river north of Degania Alef, thus blocking any Israeli attack from Tiberias against the Iraqi line of communications.|$|E
5|$|Tzipori {{later wrote}} in his book that Sharon tricked the Cabinet into believing that the {{confrontation}} with <b>the</b> <b>Syrians</b> was unexpected, and that Sharon had in fact been planning the attack since {{the eve of the}} war. Sharon maintained that on June 6 he had ordered the IDF not to cross the Awali River and to avoid a confrontation with <b>the</b> <b>Syrians.</b> Sharon said he did order the army to prepare for a contingency plan, however, to drive on the Beirut-Damascus highway in case <b>the</b> <b>Syrians</b> attacked first. Eitan claimed that on the night before the operation, he had agreed with Sharon to prepare the IAF for the attack, in case the Cabinet approved it. Senior Israeli commanders said after the operation that Operation Peace for Galilee could have been achieved without confronting <b>the</b> <b>Syrians.</b>|$|E
5|$|At night, a Syrian {{expeditionary force}} {{attempted}} to infiltrate Degania Bet, but was caught and warded off, which caused the main Syrian force to attack Degania Alef first. At 06:00, <b>the</b> <b>Syrians</b> started a frontal armored attack, consisting of 5 tanks, {{a number of}} armored vehicles and an infantry company. <b>The</b> <b>Syrians</b> pierced the Israeli defense, but their infantry was at some distance behind the tanks. The Israelis knocked out four Syrian tanks and four armored cars with 20mm cannons, PIATs and Molotov cocktails. Meanwhile, other defenders kept small arms fire on the Syrian infantry, who stopped in citrus groves a few hundred meters from the settlements. The surviving Syrian tanks withdrew back to the Golan. At 07:45, <b>the</b> <b>Syrians</b> halted their assault and dug in, still holding most of the territory between Degania Alef's fence and Samakh's police fort. They left behind a number of lightly damaged or otherwise inoperable tanks that the Israelis managed to repair.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. did not request {{permission}} from <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> government, {{nor did it}} coordinate its actions with <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> government, provide direct notification to <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> military or give indication of timing on specific targets, but it did notify <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> U.N. representative, which <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> government confirmed.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Syrian</b> Navy, officially <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> Arab Navy (البحرية العربية السورية), is {{the navy}} of <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> Armed Forces.

5|$|On September 13, 1973, an air battle {{took place}} between Syrian and Israeli fighters. It was an {{alarming}} skirmish in which twelve Syrian aircraft were shot down while the Israelis lost only one fighter. Tension ran high between both countries. The Egyptians in particular were very concerned; on April 7, 1967, an air battle between Syria and Israel had escalated the military situation {{and was one of}} the causes of the Six Day War. Aware that war was to be launched only days later, <b>the</b> <b>Syrians</b> chose not to retaliate. The air battle aided <b>the</b> <b>Syrians</b> in concentrating their forces for the war, as the Israelis interpreted it to be a defensive reaction on the part of <b>the</b> <b>Syrians.</b> The Israelis closely monitored this buildup near the front, but their intelligence remained adamant that Syria would not go to war without Egypt, which the Israelis believed was currently occupied with internal issues.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Syrians</b> were {{equipped}} with rifles discarded by retreating Ottoman soldiers during World War I and {{those used by}} the Sharifian Army's Bedouin cavalry during the 1916 Arab Revolt. <b>The</b> <b>Syrians</b> also possessed a number of machine guns and about 15 artillery batteries. According to various versions, ammunition was low, with 120–250 bullets per rifle, 45 bullets per machine gun, and 50–80 shells per cannon. Part of this ammunition was also unusable because many bullet and rifle types did not correspond to each other.|$|E
5|$|The Mastiff RPVs went {{in first}} {{to cause the}} Syrian SAMs to turn on their radars by convincing <b>the</b> <b>Syrians</b> that many attack {{aircraft}} were overhead. Once the Mastiffs were tracked by Syrian radar, the tracking signals were relayed to another Scout outside of the missiles' range. The Scout then relayed the signal to E2C Hawkeye aircraft orbiting off the coast. The data gathered was analyzed by the E2Cs and Boeing 707 ECM aircraft. Once the SAM crews fired missiles at the drones, the F-15s and F-16s provided air cover while F-4 Phantoms attacked the SAM batteries, destroying them with AGM-78 and AGM-45 anti-radiation missiles. The rapid flight time of the missiles minimized the F-4s' exposure to the SAMs. <b>The</b> <b>Syrians</b> reportedly fired 57 SA-6s, to no effect.|$|E
5000|$|On 1 December 2016, Benkirane criticized <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> {{government}} of Bashar al-Assad for its actions during <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> Civil War: [...] "What <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> regime backed by Russia {{is doing to}} <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> people surpasses all humanitarian limits".|$|R

5|$|According to plan, <b>the</b> <b>Syrians</b> {{attacked}} {{from the}} southern Golan Heights, {{just south of the}} Sea of Galilee through al-Hama and the Yarmouk River, hitting a densely populated Jewish area of settlement. This came as a surprise to the Haganah, which expected an attack from south Lebanon and Mishmar HaYarden. The Jewish villages on the original confrontation line were Ein Gev, Masada, Sha'ar HaGolan and both Deganias.|$|E
5|$|Ironically, some pure-blooded desert-bred Arabians in Syria had {{enormous}} difficulties being accepted as registrable purebred Arabians {{because many of}} the Bedouin who owned them saw no need to obtain a piece of paper to verify the purity of their horses. However, eventually <b>the</b> <b>Syrians</b> developed a stud book for their animals that was accepted by the World Arabian Horse Association (WAHO) in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Ivry {{received}} {{the green light}} at 10:00 AM to execute the operation, but by then he had postponed the attack until 2:00 PM. At 1:30 PM, Eitan ordered Ivry to strike, and the Israeli aircraft took off in pairs. The first wave {{was made up of}} 96 F-15s and F-16s. The second wave which attacked the SAM batteries at 3:50 PM was made up of 92 aircraft. When the attack was launched, <b>the</b> <b>Syrians</b> ordered their combat air patrols to return to base and land.|$|E

50|$|On 14 May 2011, during <b>the</b> 2011-2012 <b>Syrian</b> uprising, <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> {{military}} {{began an}} operation in <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> town of Talkalakh.

50|$|Hamadani {{also served}} in Syria as both an advisor to <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> army during <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> Civil War and as {{overseer}} for Quds Force operations {{in support of}} <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> government.|$|R
5|$|Near 4:00 PM, with {{fourteen}} batteries {{destroyed and}} an hour left until dark, Ivry decided to call off the operation, assuming the optimal result had been achieved and that <b>the</b> <b>Syrians</b> would move more SAMs into place the next day. The operation was stopped shortly after 4:00 PM. Colonel Aviem Sella, {{a member of the}} operation staff, later said that Sharon severely criticized that decision.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Syrians</b> {{responded by}} {{launching}} about 100 fighter aircraft {{to stop the}} attacks. Intercepting IAF pilots relied frequently on VHF radio, in hopes of preserving their tactical communications and links to the command post. Selective airborne communications jamming disrupted the airwaves for the MiG-21s and MiG-23s and cut them off from ground control, making them vulnerable to AWACS-directed attacks from the Israeli F-15s and F-16s.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} {{changed when}} Sadat, {{in the face}} of protests from his senior commanders, ordered an offensive to seize the strategic Sinai mountain passes, hoping to relieve Israeli pressure on <b>the</b> <b>Syrians.</b> The resulting offensive was ill-planned and ill-executed, culminating in heavy Egyptian losses without achieving any of its objectives.

50|$|The Movement is {{a member}} of <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> National Council and is {{represented}} in <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> National Coalition. Militarily, it is allied with Ali Basher's Aleppo branch of <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> Turkmen Brigades.|$|R
5|$|An Israeli {{reserve unit}} {{was called in}} from Tiberias. It arrived after twenty minutes and took {{positions}} around the town. At that point, Samakh (Tzemah) was defended by three platoons from the Barak battalion and reinforcements from neighboring villages. They entrenched in the actual village, which had been abandoned by the residents in April 1948, with British escort. Positions in the village included the police station in the west, the cemetery in the north, the Manshiya neighborhood in the south, and the railway station. <b>The</b> <b>Syrians</b> set up their positions in an abandoned British military base {{just east of the}} village and in an animal quarantine station to the southeast.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{estimates}} of the casualties which claimed 2,000 Syrian dead and 800 French casualties {{turned out to be}} exaggerated. The French Army claimed 42 of its soldiers were killed, 152 wounded and 14 missing in action, while around 150 Syrian fighters were killed and 1,500 wounded. King Faisal observed the battle unfold from the village of al-Hamah, and as it became apparent that <b>the</b> <b>Syrians</b> had been routed, he and his cabinet, with the exception of Interior Minister 'Ala al-Din al-Durubi, who had quietly secured a deal with the French, departed for al-Kiswah, a town located at the southern approaches of Damascus.|$|E
5|$|On October 6, 1973, Egypt {{launched}} Operation Badr, {{which started}} the Yom-Kippur War. It succeeded in crossing the Suez Canal and establishing bridgeheads {{on the east}} bank in Israeli-occupied Sinai, and counter-attacks by launched by Israeli reserves were unsuccessful. By October 10, fighting along the front {{had come to a}} lull. Egyptian President Anwar Sadat soon ordered an offensive to seize the strategic Sinai mountain passes, despite protests and objections by his senior commanders against such an offensive. Sadat hoped to divert Israeli pressure from <b>the</b> <b>Syrians.</b> The October 14 offensive was ill-planned and ill-executed, and culminated in heavy Egyptian losses without achieving any objectives.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{the start}} of <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> civil war, human rights groups say that the {{majority}} of abuses have been committed by <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> government's forces, and UN investigations have concluded that the government's abuses are the greatest in both gravity and scale. The branches of <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> Armed Forces that have committed war crimes include at least <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> Arab Army, Syrian Arab Air Force and <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> Military Intelligence. However <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> authorities deny these accusations [...] and claim that irregular armed groups with foreign support are behind the atrocities, including Al Qaeda linked Insurgents.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Syrian</b> Support Group (SSG) was a Washington, D.C.-based {{non-governmental}} organization that {{was founded in}} December 2011 {{in response to the}} actions of <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> government in <b>the</b> <b>Syrian</b> civil war. <b>The</b> group shut down its operations in August, 2014. <b>The</b> <b>Syrian</b> Support Group was the only organization legally permitted by the U.S. government to provide support directly to <b>the</b> Free <b>Syrian</b> Army (FSA). <b>The</b> <b>Syrian</b> Support Group provided non-lethal aid to units of the FSA which it determined had no affiliation with extremist groups such as the Al-Nusra Front.|$|R
5|$|The success {{achieved}} by Operation Badr surprised Egyptian commanders, whose confidence soared. Sadat came {{under pressure to}} press the offensive towards the Sinai Passes, but remained unyielding, holding to the original goal of waging a limited war. Ahmed Ismail and Shazly were also on par with Sadat's opinion. However, appeals from <b>the</b> <b>Syrians,</b> whose situation was desperate by October 9, ultimately forced Sadat {{to change his mind}} for political reasons, against the protests of his commanders. Consequently, Egypt would lose the initiative to Israel when it launched its unsuccessful attack eastwards on October 14.|$|E
5|$|A {{soldier who}} participated in the battle {{reported}} that only 20 uninjured troops were left to defend the police station as the second Syrian column reached Samakh (Tzemah). The only heavy weapon the defenders possessed was ineffective against Syrian armor. Fearing their forces would be completely cut off, an order was given by the Haganah to retreat and leave the wounded, Tzvika Levkov among them. The retreat was disorganized and heavy Israeli casualties were recorded as Samakh's police station fell. Reinforcements from the Deganias, commanded by Moshe Cohen, arrived but were immediately hit by <b>the</b> <b>Syrians</b> and did not significantly affect the battle. Aharon Israeli, a platoon commander in these reinforcements, wrote that it was clear as soon as they arrived that the battle was over. Cohen would not hear of a retreat initially, but when the force saw Levkov fall into a trench, they hastily withdrew.|$|E
5|$|At 10:30, French forces reached al-'Azma's headquarters, {{unhindered}} by {{the mines}} laid en route by <b>the</b> <b>Syrians.</b> Little information {{is known about}} the battle from the Syrian side. According to one version, when French forces were about 100 meters in the distance, al-'Azma rushed to a Syrian artilleryman stationed near him and demanded him to open fire. However, before any shells could be fired, a French tank unit spotted al-'Azma and gunned him down by machine gun. In another account, al-'Azma had attempted to mine the trenches as the French forces approached his position, but was shot down by the French before he could set off the charges. Al-'Azma's death marked the end of the battle, although intermittent clashes continued until 13:30. Surviving Syrian fighters were bombed from the air and harried by the French as they retreated toward Damascus.|$|E
