25|$|Kautz's men did {{not arrive}} until noon, however, having been delayed en route by {{numerous}} enemy pickets. They assaulted the Dimmock Line where it crossed the Jerusalem Plank Road (present-day U.S. Route 301, Crater Road). The Confederates' Battery 27, also known as Rives's Salient, was manned by 150 militiamen commanded by Maj. Fletcher H. Archer. Kautz first launched a probing attack, <b>then</b> <b>paused.</b> His main attack was by the 11th Pennsylvania Cavalry against the Home Guard, a group consisting primarily of teenagers, elderly men, and some wounded soldiers from city hospitals. The Home Guards retreated to the city with heavy losses, but by this time Beauregard {{had been able to}} bring reinforcements from Richmond to bear, which were able to repulse the Union assault. Kautz, hearing no activity on Gillmore's front, presumed that he was left on his own and withdrew. Confederate casualties were about 80, Union 40. Butler was furious with Gillmore's timidity and incompetence and arrested him. Gillmore requested a court of inquiry, which was never convened, but Grant later reassigned him and the incident was dropped.|$|E
25|$|Also in 2011, Jawbone {{announced}} (and <b>then</b> <b>paused</b> production) of its lifestyle tracking system, UP by Jawbone. The UP wristband {{and accompanying}} app was first {{announced at the}} TED conference in Scotland in July 2011. Describing the company’s foray into health, Rahman told TechCrunch, “It seems like a big departure, but once we start talking about the things {{it takes to make}} this whole category work, we get into things like making it tiny, having a long battery life, making it fashionable, making it waterproof, working with smartphones, having a rich, visual experience on your smartphone and making it social. This is all stuff we do anyway. It comes back around to the mission of your mobile lifestyle.” Highly anticipated by Jawbone fans and the media, the UP lifestyle tracker and app system launched in November 2011. FastCompany Design reported, “If UP works, it could augur a huge shift in the way we approach weight loss and staying healthy.” Jawbone halted production of the product a month later in response to widespread customer claims of issues with charging, syncing, and in some cases, product failure. The guarantee, offered purchasers of UP full refunds for any reason, even if they wanted to keep their wristbands.|$|E

25|$|However, {{they do not}} {{strictly}} follow history. The first six books quickly move through twelve years of the Napoleonic Wars, as established by frequent reference to historical events, with The Fortune of War ending on 1 June 1813 with the battle between HMS Shannon and USS Chesapeake. Yet the series then enters a kind of fantasy-time in which it takes another dozen novels to progress to November 1813. Much of this period is spent at sea, {{with little or no}} connection to real-world years, and the events of the novels take up substantially more time than the few months 'available'. External historical reference returns with The Yellow Admiral, the 18th book in the series. Towards the beginning of this novel, it is stated that the British army under the Duke of Wellington has entered France from Spain, which occurred in November 1813. Time is <b>then</b> <b>paused</b> again for a few chapters, as a narrative apparently lasting several months ensues before a specific arrival at Christmas 1813. Thereafter, the book and the next in the series (The Hundred Days) move swiftly through the historical events of Napoleon's disastrous invasion of Russia and his defeat in the War of the Sixth Coalition, his exile and escape from Elba, and his final campaign and defeat in June 1815. The last completed book in the series, Blue at the Mizzen, is the only volume which is set entirely after the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E

500|$|The Howe {{brothers}} <b>then</b> <b>paused</b> {{to consolidate}} their position, and the admiral {{engaged in a}} fruitless peace conference with Congressional representatives on September 11. [...] Four days later the British landed on Manhattan, a bombardment from the river scattering inexperienced militia into a panicked retreat, and forcing Washington to retreat further. [...] After Washington stopped the British advance up Manhattan at Harlem Heights on September 16, Howe again made a flanking maneuver, landing troops at Pell's Point {{in a bid to}} cut off Washington's avenue of retreat. [...] To defend against this move, Washington withdrew most of his army to White Plains, where after a short battle on October 28 he retreated further north. [...] This isolated the remaining Continental Army troops in upper Manhattan, so Howe returned to Manhattan and captured Fort Washington in mid November, taking almost 3,000 prisoners. Four days later, Fort Lee, across the Hudson River from Fort Washington, was also taken. [...] Washington brought much of his army across the Hudson into New Jersey, but was immediately forced to retreat by the aggressive British advance.|$|E
500|$|Moore {{published}} {{two books}} of prose fiction set in Ireland around this time; a second book of short stories, The Untilled Field (1903) and a novel, The Lake (1905). The Untilled Field deal with themes of clerical {{interference in the}} daily lives of the Irish peasantry, and of the issue of emigration. The stories were originally written for translation into Irish, to serve as models for other writers working in the language. Three of the translations were published in the New Ireland Review, but publication was <b>then</b> <b>paused</b> due to a perceived anti-clerical sentiment. In 1902 the entire collection was translated by Tadhg Ó Donnchadha and Pádraig Ó Súilleabháin, and published in a parallel-text edition by the Gaelic League as An-tÚr-Ghort. Moore later revised the texts for the English edition. These stories were influenced by Turgenev's A Sportsman's Sketches, a book recommended to Moore by W. K. Magee, a sub-librarian of the National Library of Ireland, and had earlier suggested that Moore [...] "was best suited to become Ireland's Turgenev". The tales are recognised by some as representing the birth of the Irish short story as a literary genre.|$|E

500|$|In the Battle of Long Island on August 27, 1776, British forces {{successfully}} occupied western Long Island (modern Brooklyn), compelling Washington {{to withdraw}} his army to Manhattan. [...] General Howe <b>then</b> <b>paused</b> to consolidate his gains, and the brothers {{decided to make}} a diplomatic overture. [...] During the battle they had captured several high-ranking Continental Army officers, including Major General John Sullivan. [...] The Howes managed to convince Sullivan that a conference with members of the Continental Congress might yield fruit, and released him on parole to deliver a message to the Congress in Philadelphia, proposing an informal meeting to discuss ending the armed conflict between Britain and its rebellious colonies. [...] After Sullivan's speech to Congress, John Adams cynically commented on this diplomatic attempt, calling Sullivan a [...] "decoy-duck" [...] and accusing the British of sending Sullivan [...] "to seduce us into a renunciation of our independence"; others noted that it appeared to be an attempt to blame Congress for prolonging the war. [...] The Congress did however agree to send three of its members – Adams, Benjamin Franklin and Edward Rutledge – to a conference with Lord Howe. [...] They were instructed [...] "to ask a few Questions and take [...] Answers", but had no further authority. [...] When Howe learned of the committee's limited authority, he briefly considered calling the meeting off, but decided to proceed after discussion with his brother. [...] None of the commissioners believed the conference would amount to anything.|$|E
500|$|Howe and {{his brother}} Richard had, {{as part of their}} instructions, been {{assigned}} roles as peace commissioners, with limited authority to treat with the rebels. [...] After Long Island, they pursued an attempt at reconciliation, sending the captured General John Sullivan to Philadelphia with a proposal for a peace conference. [...] The meeting that resulted, conducted by Admiral Howe, was unsuccessful. [...] The Howes had been given limited powers, as had the Congressional representatives, and the latter were insistent that the British recognise the recently declared colonial independence. [...] This was not within the Howes' powers, so the conference failed, and Howe then continued the campaign. He first landed troops on Manhattan on 15 September, and occupied New York City (which then occupied only Lower Manhattan), although his advance northward on Manhattan was checked the next day at Harlem Heights. He <b>then</b> <b>paused,</b> spending nearly one month consolidating control of New York City and awaiting reinforcements. During this time he ordered the execution of Nathan Hale for espionage, and {{had to deal with the}} effects of a major fire in the city. He then attempted a landing on the mainland at Throgs Neck, intending to flank Washington's position at Harlem Heights. [...] However, the narrow causeway between the beach and the mainland was well-defended, and he ended up withdrawing the troops. He then made a successful landing of troops at Pell's Point in Westchester County; Washington managed to avoid being flanked, retreating to White Plains. Howe successfully forced Washington out of the New York area in the 28 October Battle of White Plains, and then turned his attention to consolidate British hold on Manhattan. In November he attacked the remaining Continental Army stronghold in the Battle of Fort Washington, taking several thousand prisoners.|$|E

2500|$|The British {{advance in}} the Fourth Army area reached the Somme rapidly from 17 to 20 March, with a {{continuous}} pursuit by vanguards and the main body moving forward by bounds between lines of resistance up to the Somme river and Canal du Nord, which ran north-to-south from Offoy to Péronne, <b>then</b> <b>paused</b> while the river was bridged, with a priority of light bridges for infantry first, pontoon or trestle bridges for wagons and field artillery and then heavy bridges for mechanical transport and heavy artillery.
