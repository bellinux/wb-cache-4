5|$|Fuller, however, was {{confident}} {{in his work}} {{and the idea that}} the film would be strongly anti-racist, particularly with the changes he had made to the original work. The original novel's hate-filled Muslim black trainer, who had deliberately retrained the dog to attack white people, was converted into the character of Keys, who genuinely wished <b>to</b> <b>cure</b> <b>the</b> animal. Fuller also changed the novel's original ending into a more pessimistic film ending. The film was shot in only forty-five days at a cost of $7 million. Five white German Shepherd Dogs played the unnamed central character.|$|E

5|$|Seeking {{to double}} his $7,000 salary from the {{previous}} season, Henderson became embroiled in a contract dispute with the Red Wings prior to the 1966–67 NHL season, before the team acceded to his demands. He then spent the year attempting to overcome injuries; a case of tracheitis forced him to miss several early season games and led the team to consider having him play wearing a surgical mask {{to protect against the}} cold air of the arena. Henderson eventually spent time in the dry air of Arizona <b>to</b> <b>cure</b> <b>the</b> ailment, but he also suffered from torn chest muscles and ultimately missed a third of the season. On the ice, Henderson scored 21 goals and 40 points in 49 games.|$|E
5|$|By the Late Middle Ages, {{the royal}} touch {{had become an}} {{integral}} part of the coronation of the French monarch at Reims Cathedral. The rite included the anointing of the king's hands, which was believed to confer on him the ability <b>to</b> <b>cure.</b> <b>The</b> coronation and anointing were immediately followed by a journey to Corbeny, the site of the shrine of Saint Marcouf (d. 558), patron saint of scrofulous people. After the pilgrimage was completed, the newly crowned king was deemed to possess the sacred power of touch. On his deathbed, Philip IV (r. 1285–1314) reportedly instructed his son and heir, Louis X (r. 1314–1316), about healing scrofula by touch. Philip VI (r. 1328–1350), the first Valois king, sought to demonstrate that he shared the thaumaturgic powers of his sovereign cousins and ancestors, thus proving himself as their rightful heir. He touched 35 people between 1 January and 30 June 1337; some of them had come from Brittany, Brabant and Vivarais.|$|E
5|$|In March 1701, James II {{suffered}} a stroke while hearing mass at the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, leaving him partially paralysed.

The waters, however, had little effect, and James II died of a seizure on 16 September 1701. Louis XIV, in contravention of the Peace of Ryswick, declared James Francis Edward King of England, Ireland and Scotland as James III and VIII. This act irritated King William III and II, who had ruled alone {{since the death of}} his wife, Mary II. Because James Francis Edward was a minor, Queen Mary acted as nominal regent for her son. Mary presided over his regency council, too, although she was uninterested in politics. Before his death, James II expressed his wish that Mary's regency would last no longer than their son's 18th birthday.|$|E

5|$|Paramount Pictures {{purchased}} the film rights for White Dog in 1975, though the film itself was not produced until 1981, after Gary's suicide. Various {{changes were made}} from the original novel's story, including the removal of Gary himself and a tighter focus on the dog. Gary's wife was replaced in the script with a young, unmarried actress as Paramount wanted the film to show a strong contrast between the loving relationship between the protagonist and the dog's random attacks. The novel's hate-filled Muslim black trainer was converted into the character named Keys, who genuinely wished <b>to</b> <b>cure</b> <b>the</b> animal. The novel's original ending was also changed {{to make it more}} pessimistic. Directed by Samuel Fuller and starring Paul Winfield and Kristy McNichol, the film's theatrical release was suppressed in the United States out of concern of negative press after rumors began circulating from the NAACP that the film was racist. It was released internationally in France and the United Kingdom in 1982, and broadcast on various American cable television channels. Its first official American release came in December 2008 when The Criterion Collection released the original uncut film to DVD.|$|E
5|$|She was {{commissioned}} into the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet on 20 March 1909 {{and participated in}} fleet manoeuvres in April and June 1909, the Spithead Review on 12 June 1909, and the Fleet Review off Southend on 2 July. She was refitted between 17 August and 17 January 1910 in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>cure</b> <b>the</b> electrical problems with her turrets, {{but they were still}} unsatisfactory. Another attempt was made to bring her turrets to working order during a refit in the spring of 1911, but this too was unsuccessful and the decision was made the following year to convert her turrets to hydraulic power. This was delayed until after her deployment to join the Mediterranean Fleet at the end of 1912. On 17 March 1913, she collided with the submarine , but the collision was ruled the fault of the submarine. She returned to the UK in December 1913 in preparation for a major refit that would finally give her turrets hydraulic power and make her battle-worthy.|$|E
5|$|When Me and Juliet began tryout {{performances}} in Cleveland, the duo {{realized that the}} show had problems with the plot and staging. Extensive revisions during the remaining Cleveland and Boston tryouts failed <b>to</b> <b>cure</b> <b>the</b> difficulties with the plot, which the critics considered weak and uninteresting. The show was met with less than favorable reviews, though Mielziner's staging won praise from audience and critics. The show closed once it had exhausted its advance sales. According to Bill Hayes the show's star in his autobiography Like Sands Through the Hourglass published in 2005 he says' We played nearly five hundred performances, all to full houses. Production costs were paid off and substantial profits went into the R till. So, though {{not in the same}} category as the storied five that were made into films - Oklahoma!, Carousel, South Pacific, The King and I and The Sound of Music - our show must be considered a success. With the exception of a short run in Chicago, there was no national tour, and the show has seldom been seen. A small-scale production was presented by London's Finborough Theatre in 2010.|$|E

5|$|In her research, Fraser worked {{predominantly}} in infectious disease, studying general infection, puerperal fever, {{scarlet fever}} and septic sore throat among other bacterial infections. She began studies on scarlet fever {{in the early}} 1930s, and along with Dr. Helen Plummer isolated the precipitin present in the strains of streptococci {{likely to lead to}} disease. These findings were important in determining the types of antitoxins which might be employed for immunization to neutralize the disease. The type of research Fraser was engaged in required that the bacteria of the disease which created a toxin be isolated, so that it could be injected into a horse. Repeated injections of small doses of toxin allowed the horse to become immune to the disease. The serum created from the blood of animals which had been immunized, contained an antibody (known at the time as an antitoxin), which could then be injected into humans <b>to</b> <b>cure</b> <b>the</b> disease. Development of the sulfonamides rendered immunization against scarlet fever unnecessary, but she continued to study other aspects of the disease. In 1941, she typed the streptococci of scarlet fever which was an important breakthrough for tracking the epidemiology of the disease. Fraser also conducted research in an attempt to develop an antigen for tuberculosis. With the development of penicillin, her research after 1947, shifted focus to the study of antibiotics including bacitracin, penicillin, polymixin, and subtilin. Fraser studied various preparations of penicillin against the tubercular bacillus and as a treatment for gonorrhoea. Rising through the ranks of assistant professor and associate professor, Fraser became a full professor in 1949 teaching preventative medicine for the Bachelor of Science or nursing degree for the remainder of her career. In 1955 Fraser was appointed as a professor of microbiology and held that post until her retirement a decade later.|$|E
