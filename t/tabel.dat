Lett. 79, 4162 (1997) ] we consider {{in detail the}} dispersion of particle pairs by a two-dimensional turbulent flow {{and its relation to}} the kinematic properties of the velocity field. We show that the mean square separation of a pair of particles is governed by rather rare, extreme events and that the majority of initially close pairs are not dispersed by the flow. Another manifestation of the same effect {{is the fact that the}} dispersion of an initially dense cluster is not the result of homogeneously spreading the particles within the whole system. Instead it proceeds through a splitting into smaller but also dense clusters. The statistical nature of this effect is discussed...|$|R
