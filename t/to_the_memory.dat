40|$|What {{does it mean}} to {{bear witness}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> of {{previous}} generations’ trauma victims? What lessons should we learn from those who came before us to ensure a happier future? This thesis explores <b>the</b> trauma and <b>memories</b> of <b>the</b> deceased or older generation found in J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter series. I intend <b>to</b> analyze <b>the</b> character of Harry Potter as he interacts with <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> of <b>the</b> previous generation, which he is able to resurrect in embodied forms through the use of magic. By testifying <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> of <b>the</b> previous generations’ trauma, Harry is able <b>to</b> break <b>the</b> cycle of violence and create a seemingly happy ending to his life’s story. Through critically studying Harry Potter as a transgenerational narrative, readers are able to learn how to bear witness <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>memories</b> of those with whom they associate in their own live and create a more empathetically inclined world...|$|R

5|$|Much {{like its}} predecessor, the game {{received}} generally positive reviews for its gameplay, sprite animations, and character roster. The Sega Saturn version, utilizing the 4MB RAM expansion cartridge, was praised {{for being an}} arcade-perfect conversion.

5|$|Despite the {{violence}} of the suppression, the government and local lords were relatively circumspect in restoring order after the revolt, and continued to be worried about fresh revolts for several decades. Few lords took revenge on their peasants except through the legal processes of the courts. Low-level unrest continued for several more years. In September 1382 there was trouble in Norfolk, involving an apparent plot against the Bishop of Norwich, and in March the following year there was an investigation into a plot to kill the sheriff of Devon. When negotiating rents with their landlords, peasants alluded <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> of the revolt and the threat of violence.|$|E

5|$|Main {{memory in}} a {{parallel}} computer is either shared memory (shared between all processing elements in a single address space), or distributed memory (in which each processing element has its own local address space). Distributed memory refers {{to the fact that}} the memory is logically distributed, but often implies that it is physically distributed as well. Distributed shared memory and memory virtualization combine the two approaches, where the processing element has its own local memory and access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>memory</b> on non-local processors. Accesses to local memory are typically faster than accesses to non-local memory.|$|E
