The hotel {{confrontation}} between Moss and Chigurh plays out very {{differently in the}} film from the novel; rather than punching out the lock and wounding Moss, in the novel Chigurh apparently steals a key from a murdered clerk and quietly enters Moss's room, and Moss ambushes him and takes him captive at gunpoint, so <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to see and know each other. Then Moss runs and the chase/shootout begins. As Chigurh and Moss face off in the hotel and the streets, they are interrupted {{by a group of}} Mexicans, all of whom Chigurh kills. In the film, this scene was cut to the point that only Moss and Chigurh fight.|$|E
25|$|Nearly all {{of almost}} 500 cases of sodomy between persons {{concerned}} {{the relationship between}} an older man and an adolescent, often by coercion, {{with only a few}} cases where the couple were consenting homosexual adults. About 100 of the total involved allegations of child abuse. Adolescents were generally punished more leniently than adults, but only when they were very young (under ca. 12 years) or when the case clearly concerned rape did <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to avoid punishment altogether. As a rule, the Inquisition condemned to death only those sodomites over the age of 25 years. As about half of those tried were under this age, it explains the relatively small percentage of death sentences.|$|E
25|$|When it {{was first}} {{observed}} in July 1966, {{there was still a}} large enemy force operating at the base and {{in the shadow of the}} Rockpile. The fight for the mountain occurred during Operation Hastings and involved 8,000 Marines and 3,000 South Vietnamese soldiers. The base at Dong Ha was used as a staging area to mount an attack on the DMZ and the area around the Rockpile. Brigadier General Lowell English, a commander in charge of Operation Hastings, stated that the Marines sought to take the North Vietnamese by surprise on their crucial infiltration routes and to smash and destroy their force in the DMZ region before <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to regain balance or momentum. The actions started with bombing and napalm strikes on potential future landing zone sites in mid-July 1966. The initial helicopter assault of Operation Hastings was disastrous as two transport helicopters collided and crashed. By the end of the day 15 Marines were dead with a further 10 soldiers injured, however overall Operation Hastings was a success. By the operation's end on 3 August 1966 the United States had accounted for at least 824 confirmed NVA soldiers killed and 214 captured weapons compared to the 126 Marines killed and 448 wounded. The Rockpile officially came under the control of American troops by the end of July 1966 when a small observation team landed on top of the summit. The NVA immediately attempted to remove the Marines from their defensive position, but several attempts at scaling the Rockpile and striking the top and sides with mortar rounds proved ineffective. Operation Prairie swung the momentum for the mountain's fight after waves of Marines stormed into the area to reinforce the troops around the Rockpile and fortify its defenses. From then on the Rockpile was often manned by at least a squad of United States Marines, who received supply drops by helicopters and would go on to launch numerous operations from the base of the mountain.|$|E

500|$|Spielberg {{said that}} the arrest of criminals before <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to commit their crimes in the movie had some {{real-world}} background in post-9/11 America, saying that [...] "e’re giving up some of our freedom so {{that the government can}} protect us." [...] The future world in Minority Report of retinal scans, robotic human inspectors, and intrusive, individualized, public advertising arrived in American theaters as the country was debating how much governmental intrusion into personal matters was necessary to ensure safety of its citizens. Spielberg said he would be against a PreCrime system if it were ever possible, as he believes that if it did exist, those in control of it would undoubtedly abuse its powers. Kowalski questions what the benevolent precogs in the film could become in the hands of those who trained their skills for political intrigue. Science fiction scholar Gary Westfahl asserts that in a political context, PreCrime may be seen [...] "a metaphor for racial profiling, and one could view the liberation of the precogs as the end of a form of slavery." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{life cycle}} of this fungus allows for both an {{imperfect}} (making asexual spores, or conidia [...] ) or perfect (making sexual spores) form; as has often happened in fungal taxonomy, the imperfect form was given a different name, because {{the relationship between the}} perfect and imperfect forms of the same species was not then known. The imperfect, or conidial stage of this fungus is the plant pathogen Geniculodendron pyrofirme, first reported in 1964, and known to infect dormant seeds of the Sitka spruce, Picea sitchensis. A 1978 study showed that about a third of Sitka spruce seed lots stored by the British Columbia Forest Service (Canada) contained diseased seeds, and these diseased seeds failed to germinate when sown in local nurseries. The fungus can grow at low temperatures, contributing to its ability to kill seeds before <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> to germinate. Infected seeds tend to shrivel and dry up rather than rot. It was also demonstrated that seed lots from squirrel seed caches have increased incidence of C.fulgens infection. Squirrels tend to cache pinecones repeatedly in the same location, and in cool, moist conditions favorable for fungus growth. In 2002, G.pyriforme was found on imported conifer seeds in Germany, the first such report in continental Europe.|$|E

Qazi Muhammad did not deny that his republic was funded and supplied by the Soviets, but did deny that the Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) was a communist party. He claimed that this was a lie fabricated by the Iranian military authorities, and added that his ideals were very different from the Soviets'. Following the fall of Mahabad, the Soviets allowed for the safe passage of Mustafa Barzani and his followers into the Soviet Union.|$|E
