5|$|Wynnea {{americana}} has {{no discernible}} odor, and its <b>taste</b> <b>is</b> unknown. It {{has been described}} as inedible due to its toughness.|$|E
5|$|Bombay Sapphire gin is {{flavored with}} {{botanicals}} including cubeb and grains of paradise. The brand {{was launched in}} 1987, but its maker claims that {{it is based on}} a secret recipe dating to 1761. Pertsovka, a dark brown Russian pepper vodka with a burning <b>taste,</b> <b>is</b> prepared from infusion of cubeb and capsicum peppers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Taste</b> <b>is</b> {{generated}} from receptors {{on the tongue}} and passed along the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves into the solitary tract in the brainstem. Some taste information is also passed from the pharynx into this area via the vagus nerve. Information is then passed from here through the thalamus into the gustatory cortex.|$|E
50|$|Taste {{helps to}} {{identify}} toxins and maintain nutrition. Five basic <b>tastes</b> <b>are</b> recognized today: salty, sweet, bitter, sour, and umami. Salty and sour <b>taste</b> sensations <b>are</b> both detected through ion channels. Sweet, bitter, and umami <b>tastes,</b> however, <b>are</b> detected {{by way of}} G protein-coupled taste receptors.|$|R
50|$|This {{variability}} of PTC tasting {{came to the}} attention of Albert Blakeslee at the Carnegie Institute of Genetics on Long Island, New York. Blakeslee believed that PTC <b>tasting</b> <b>was</b> genetically determined. In 1932 he published a population study that showed that PTC <b>tasting</b> <b>is</b> inherited as a dominant Mendelian trait.|$|R

5|$|<b>Taste</b> <b>is</b> {{the most}} {{important}} sense in sheep, establishing forage preferences, with sweet and sour plants being preferred and bitter plants being more commonly rejected. Touch and sight are also important in relation to specific plant characteristics, such as succulence and growth form.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it is an}} attractive-looking bolete, Caloboletus calopus is not {{considered}} edible on account of its very bitter taste, which does not disappear upon cooking. There are reports of it being eaten in far eastern Russia and Ukraine. The bitter <b>taste</b> <b>is</b> {{largely due to the}} compounds calopin and a δ-lactone derivative, O-acetylcyclocalopinA. These compounds contains a structural motif known as a 3-methylcatechol unit, which is rare in natural products. A total synthesis of calopin was reported in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius vietus milk has a {{very hot}} taste, and the {{mushroom}} lacks a distinctive smell. Although described by many mycologists as inedible, David Pegler claims that its acrid taste can be removed after boiling, allowing it to be consumed. Though the strong, acrid <b>taste</b> <b>is</b> {{a defining feature of}} the species, it is weaker or even absent in some older mushrooms, which is not unusual for Lactarius species. Occasionally, however, mushrooms of the species have been collected which have a mild taste; this has also been observed in other species with typically acrid tastes.|$|E

5|$|Leccinum manzanitae is edible, and its <b>taste</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} rated highly, although {{others have}} described the flavor as bland. Drying the mushroom may improve the flavor. One field guide advises caution when selecting this species for the table, as there have been poisonings reported with similar-looking mushrooms found in the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest region of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Polyozellus {{multiplex}} is edible, and {{is collected}} {{for sale in}} Asian countries such as Korea, Japan, and China. In North America, it is sometimes collected recreationally, and commercially. The <b>taste</b> <b>is</b> described as mild, and the odor as mild or aromatic. Mycologist David Arora claims the flavor to be inferior to Craterellus. Fruit bodies may be preserved by drying.|$|E
5|$|This {{mushroom}} is edible {{but very}} peppery. The Italian chef Antonio Carluccio recommends only {{using it to}} add flavour to other mushrooms. It {{has been used as}} a condiment in many countries. The mushroom should be well-cooked before consumption to minimize the risk of gastric symptoms; the peppery <b>taste</b> <b>is</b> lost with cooking. In powdered form, it loses its peppery taste quickly. Some guidebooks classify C.piperatus as inedible. Fruit bodies can be used for mushroom dyeing; depending on the mordant used, yellow, orange, or greenish-brown dyes can be made.|$|E

40|$|Two {{types of}} agents want to pair. They meet randomly, and if each is {{acceptable}} to each other pairing takes place. One type's <b>tastes</b> <b>are</b> uniform over the other type while the other type's <b>tastes</b> <b>are</b> not. We assume nontransferable utility and study whether the outcome is more efficient when the type heterogeneous in tastes searches or vice versa. ...|$|R

5|$|As the {{traditional}} method of making borscht with beet sour often requires planning {{at least several}} days ahead, many recipes for quicker borscht replace the beet sour with fresh beetroot juice, while the sour <b>taste</b> <b>is</b> imparted by other ingredients, such as vinegar, lemon juice or citric acid, tomatoes, tart apples, dry red wine, dill pickle juice, sauerkraut juice, or a fermented rye flour and water mixture. The soup is typically flavored with {{a wide selection of}} herbs, spices and condiments. Salt, black pepper, garlic, bay leaves and dill are among the most commonly used. Other aromatics often added to borscht include allspice, celery stalks, parsley, marjoram, hot peppers, saffron, horseradish, ginger and prunes. Some recipes require flour or roux to further thicken the borscht. A common opinion is that a good borscht should be thick enough for a spoon to stand upright in it.|$|E

25|$|The bitter <b>taste</b> <b>is</b> {{almost universally}} {{unpleasant}} to humans. This is because many nitrogenous organic molecules {{which have a}} pharmacological effect on humans taste bitter. These include caffeine, nicotine, and strychnine, which respectively compose the stimulant in coffee, addictive agent in cigarettes, and active compound in many pesticides. It appears that some psychological process allows humans to overcome their innate aversion to bitter taste, as caffeinated drinks are widely consumed and enjoyed around the world. It is also {{interesting to note that}} many common medicines have a bitter taste if chewed; the gustatory system apparently interprets these compounds as poisons. In this manner, the unpleasant reaction to the bitter <b>taste</b> <b>is</b> a last-line warning system before the compound is ingested and can do damage.|$|E
25|$|Liquorice flavour {{is found}} {{in a wide variety}} of candies or sweets. In most of these candies, the <b>taste</b> <b>is</b> {{reinforced}} by aniseed oil so the actual content of liquorice is very low. Liquorice confections are primarily purchased by consumers in the European Union.|$|E
25|$|Dysgeusia, {{also known}} as parageusia, is a {{distortion}} {{of the sense of}} taste. Dysgeusia is also often associated with ageusia, which is the complete lack of taste, and hypogeusia, which is a decrease in taste sensitivity. An alteration in taste or smell may be a secondary process in various disease states, or it may be the primary symptom. The distortion in the sense of <b>taste</b> <b>is</b> the only symptom, and diagnosis is usually complicated since the sense of <b>taste</b> <b>is</b> tied together with other sensory systems. Common causes of dysgeusia include chemotherapy, asthma treatment with albuterol, and zinc deficiency. Different drugs could also be responsible for altering taste and resulting in dysgeusia. Due to the variety of causes of dysgeusia, there are many possible treatments that are effective in alleviating or terminating the symptoms of dysgeusia. These include artificial saliva, pilocarpine, zinc supplementation, alterations in drug therapy, and alpha lipoic acid.|$|E

50|$|Historically it {{was thought}} that the sour <b>taste</b> <b>was</b> {{produced}} solely when free hydrogen ions (H+) directly depolarised taste receptors. However, specific receptors for sour taste with other methods of action are now being proposed. HCN1 and HCN4 (HCN channels) were two such proposals; both of these receptors are cyclic nucleotide-gated channels. The two ion channels suggested to contribute to sour <b>taste</b> <b>are</b> ACCN1 and TASK-1.|$|R
50|$|The <b>tasting</b> <b>is</b> {{carried out}} by an expert jury, of {{independent}} beer experts from across the world. The yardstick is not the technical laboratory analysis, but a rating from the consumer's viewpoint of sense and taste. The aim of the blind <b>tasting</b> <b>is</b> to find the beers which best fulfill the type criteria of each category and whose taste as well as quality are the most convincing.|$|R
25|$|Odense Pilsner is a pilsener. The <b>taste</b> <b>is</b> {{balanced}} between malt and fruit. Two different varieties of hops are used, both come from Hallertau in Germany.

25|$|Thomas Henry, an apothecary from Manchester, was {{the first}} to sell {{artificial}} mineral water to the general public for medicinal purposes, beginning in the 1770s. His recipe for 'Bewley's Mephitic Julep' consisted of 3 drachms of fossil alkali to a quart of water, and the manufacture had to 'throw in streams of fixed air until all the alkaline <b>taste</b> <b>is</b> destroyed'.|$|E
25|$|Distilled gin is {{produced}} exclusively by redistilling ethanol of agricultural origin {{with an initial}} strength of 96% ABV (the azeotrope of water and ethanol) in stills traditionally used for gin, {{in the presence of}} juniper berries and of other natural botanicals, provided that the juniper <b>taste</b> <b>is</b> predominant. Gin obtained simply by adding essences or flavourings to ethanol of agricultural origin is not distilled gin.|$|E
