5|$|Elite Force was one {{of several}} Star Trek games {{announced}} after Activision secured the license to Star Trek video games from Viacom in 1998. The game {{was one of}} the first to license id Tech 3, a game engine by id Software used by a number of video games during the early 2000s. Elite Force was a critical success, and is often praised as the first truly successful Star Trek video game, able to appeal <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not Star Trek fans. Raven Software released an expansion pack to the game in May 2001, while Wildstorm adapted the story for a short graphic novel in July 2000. A sequel developed by Ritual Entertainment, , was published in 2003.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 17th and 18th Centuries, {{equation}} clocks were made, which allowed {{the user to}} see or calculate apparent solar time, as would be shown by a sundial. Before {{the invention of the}} pendulum clock, sundials were the only accurate timepieces. When good clocks became available, they appeared inaccurate <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> used to trusting sundials. The annual variation of the equation of time made a clock up to about 15 minutes fast or slow, relative to a sundial, depending on the time of year. Equation clocks satisfied the demand for clocks that always agreed with sundials. Several types of equation clock mechanism were devised. which can be seen in surviving examples, mostly in museums.|$|E

The privilege of being a member meant that books could be borrowed for free. Franklin also mentioned that the library was only open on Saturdays, for four hours in the afternoon.|$|E

Pentecostal churches readily adopted {{and contributed to the}} gospel music publications of the early 20th century. Late 20th-century musicians such as Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Mahalia Jackson, Andrae Crouch, and the Blackwood Brothers either were raised in a Pentecostal environment, or have acknowledged the influence of that tradition.|$|E

In 1983, the unemployment compensation programme was expanded to include workers who had resigned from their jobs. A law of July 1984 introduced a new benefit called the Insertion Allowance, providing short-term support for those in periods of transition into the labour market. Another law passed that same month introduced a Special Solidarity Allowance for long-term unemployed persons with no insurance entitlements remaining. In addition, an Act of October 1982 fully extended the right to join a union <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> retired, and a law of February 1984 increased state support for the development and training activities of companies.|$|E

25|$|On 27 April 1840, Spark married Frances Maria, née Biddulph. It seems that, {{after this}} marriage, Spark {{began to lose}} {{a great deal of}} money very quickly, for a number of reasons. Spark had {{guaranteed}} loans <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> now bankrupt or otherwise out of finances, and, by September, a wave of drought, among other things, had caused unrest and nervousness in the money market. To keep himself from facing bankruptcy or becoming broke, and also to help pay for large bills (£21,000 worth) he acquired in March 1841, he sold off much of his land, his shares and his ships. He also mortgaged a town house for £6,000. To make matters worse (financially), Spark's baby was born in April 1841, which meant that he had to support two other people as well as himself. Finally, having had to sell all of his assets to pay for his many debts, Alexander Spark became officially insolvent in 1844.|$|E

500|$|Sarah Graham {{agrees with}} Hillman and Holmes, writing that Cal is paralleled with the tragic Greek mythological {{characters}} Hermaphroditus, Tiresias, and the Minotaur. She opined that other [...] "deviant" [...] {{characters in the}} novel such as Lefty and Desdemona are spared the [...] "tragic or monstrous" [...] allusions {{even though there are}} numerous examples of incest in Greek mythology. She listed the marriage of Oedipus and his mother Jocasta, as well as the son Adonis produced by the incest between Theias and his daughter Smyrna as examples. Therefore, Graham stated that comparing Cal, a hermaphrodite, <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> [...] "mythological monsters" [...] is [...] "complicit with [...] exploitation" [...] of intersex people.|$|E

[...] Hoffecker stated in letters that other coin dealers had offered to buy the entire issue, but he had declined. [...] At this time, there was a boom in commemorative coins, and dealers were trying to get all the special issues they could.|$|E
