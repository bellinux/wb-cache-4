500|$|Not all reviewers were enthusiastic. Some {{lamented the}} use of poor white Southerners, and {{one-dimensional}} black victims, and Granville Hicks labeled the book [...] "melodramatic and contrived". When the book was first released, Southern writer Flannery O'Connor commented, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> child's book it does all right. It's interesting that all the folks that are buying it don't know they're reading a child's book. Somebody ought to say what it is." [...] Carson McCullers apparently agreed with the Time magazine review, writing to a cousin: [...] "Well, honey, one thing {{we know is that}} she's been poaching on my literary preserves." ...|$|E
500|$|A new storyline {{began in}} August 2016 when Babe became {{the victim of}} a revenge attack, having {{accumulated}} several enemies over {{the months leading up to}} the attack. Several media outlets suggested a range of suspects, with the most prominent suspects being Claudette, Les and Pam, Abi and Sylvie. Other suspects included: Linda, Lee, Whitney, Ben Mitchell (Harry Reid), Steven Beale (Aaron Sidwell) and Lauren Branning (Jacqueline Jossa). The episode that aired in the United Kingdom on 15 August 2016 saw Babe argue with Claudette, Les, Abi and Sylvie with each suspect later seen going out, before someone confronts Babe in the Vic, locking her in the freezer. The scene where Babe is locked in the freezer received the episode's [...] "duff-duff". Episodes following the attack showed Babe tell her family that Sylvie was responsible for the attack, but have a conversation with Abi revealing her as the true culprit. Badland said that the attack [...] "takes Babe by surprise" [...] as [...] "she clearly didn't know there was somebody out there capable of doing this to her or else she'd have seen it coming." [...] She opined that [...] "Babe doesn't <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> minute that Abi could ever get the better of her." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{he worked}} on the mural, Picasso said: [...] "The Spanish {{struggle}} is the fight of reaction against the people, against freedom. My whole life as an artist has been nothing more than a continuous struggle against reaction and the death of art. How could anybody <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment that I could be in agreement with reaction and death? ... In the panel on which I am working, which I shall call Guernica, and in all my recent works of art, I clearly express my abhorrence of the military caste which has sunk Spain in an ocean of pain and death." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Hall of African Mammals {{was first}} {{proposed}} {{to the museum}} by Carl Akeley around 1909. His original concept contained forty dioramas which would present the rapidly vanishing landscapes and animals of Africa. The intent was that a visitor of the hall, “may have the illusion, at worst, of passing a series of pictures of primeval Africa, and at best, may <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment that he has stepped [...] across the sea into Africa itself.” Akeley’s proposal was a hit with both {{the board of trustees}} and then museum president, Henry Fairfield Osborne. To fund its creation, Daniel Pomeroy, a trustee of the museum and partner at J.P. Morgan, offered interested investors the opportunity to accompany the museum’s expeditions in Africa in exchange for funding.|$|E

2500|$|Jordan kept a diary {{during his}} service in France.

[...] No, not at all, but my {{attitude}} is this: Do {{the best you can}} and know how and then keep on smiling." [...] On March 2, 1918, he made his last entry: [...] "This fighting [...] we are doing now is the real thing. [...] A man gets to be quite a fatalist in this game.

Ricketts received her Bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago in 1994, and her Juris Doctor from the University of Michigan Law School in 1998. Laura talks of her own struggle to come out; [...] "I came out to my family I would say early to mid 90s. I <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time I wasn't really out to myself, growing up in Omaha, Neb., to a Catholic conservative family. It {{took me a while}} to come out to myself and not long after that I came out to them. I think that it really couldn't have been a better experience. They were all immediately supportive. ... I have been really really fortunate in that regard." ...|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson is unsympathetic to {{the green}} {{movement}} and has little respect for groups such as Greenpeace—he believes that the [...] "eco-mentalists" [...] are a by-product of the [...] "old trade unionists and CND lesbians" [...] who had found a more relevant cause—but [...] "loves the destination" [...] of environmentalism and believes that people should quietly strive to be more eco-friendly. Regarding windfarms, he {{says that in the}} future, they will be described as [...] "a reminder of the time when mankind temporarily took leave of its senses and decided wind, waves and lashings of tofu could somehow generate enough electricity for the whole planet". Clarkson has voiced some views regarding global warming: he believes that higher temperatures are not necessarily negative and that anthropogenic carbon dioxide production has a negligible effect on the global climate, but is aware of the negative potential consequences of global warming, saying [...] "let's just stop and <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment what the consequences might be.

2500|$|Melinda Newman of Hitfix was {{positive}} in her review, {{saying that the}} song [...] "It {{lives up to its}} title: You'll want to put on your dancing shoes and dance again. The song isn’t as interesting musically as the pair’s previous hit collaboration, “On the Floor” but it is more consistent in its commitment to being a full-on dance twirler [...] It’s totally charming, especially the [...] "woo..ooh" [...] background singing." [...] Newman compared the chorus of the song to Rihanna's [...] "Only Girl (In the World)" [...] (2010). Gina Serpe of E! News said [...] "don't <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> minute that the meaning behind the song was lost on Lopez, who's been through some personal travails of her own this past year," [...] and briefly commented that the song was [...] "Likely already destined to hit the top of the charts." [...] Similarly, Jessica Sinclair of Long Island Press commented that the song was a [...] "sure-to-be-hit song." [...] Amy Sciarretto of Pop Crush labelled [...] "Dance Again" [...] {{as one of the best}} dance songs of 2012.

Meltzer described that though the crowd was tired at the finish of the main event, WWE [...] "did clearly turn down the sound" [...] and [...] "then they hit the pyro". For the Universal title match, Meltzer wrote that it [...] "was what was expected" [...] and the [...] "match was pretty much perfect considering how late it was", with the live audience [...] "going nuts through all of this". For McMahon–Styles, Meltzer commented that the [...] "match had its moments that were spectacular", and that the [...] "story was that Shane was the real striker and {{got the better of}} that". For Ambrose–Corbin, Meltzer felt it was [...] "certainly a lot less than you'd <b>think</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> WrestleMania match", while the Raw women's match was [...] "too short for an elimination match", and the Raw tag team title match [...] "wasn't as good as what [...] most WrestleMania ladder matches but the crowd went completely nuts for the Hardys". Although WWE [...] "may have turned down the crowd noise" [...] for Cena's proposal, Meltzer felt the proposal was [...] "really great". Lastly, Meltzer said that Rawley winning the battle royal was [...] "largely for the mainstream coverage of Rob Gronkowski".|$|E
