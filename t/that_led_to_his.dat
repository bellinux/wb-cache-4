5|$|Charles Boycott and {{the events}} <b>that</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> name {{entering}} the English language {{have been the subject}} of several works of fiction. The first was Captain Boycott, a 1946 romantic novel by Phillip Rooney. This was the basis for the 1947 film Captain Boycott—directed by Frank Lauder and starred Stewart Granger, Kathleen Ryan, Alastair Sim, and Cecil Parker as Charles Boycott. More recently the story was the subject of the 2012 novel Boycott, by Colin C. Murphy.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with Alma Books, Whitehead states {{that the concept of}} the book originated from an article about the naming process for new pharmaceuticals such as Prozac. The article made Whitehead question how a similar process is used to assert a certain control over one's environment (his example is a boulevard named after a particular person), and yoking the two concepts {{was the beginning of the}} ideas <b>that</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> composition of the novel.|$|E

Natalia Naryshkina {{is said to have}} consumed a large quantity of pickled mushrooms prior to her death. It is unclear whether the mushrooms themselves were poisonous or if she succumbed to food poisoning.|$|E

5|$|The Rage Against God (subtitle in US editions: How Atheism Led Me to Faith) is {{the fifth}} book by Peter Hitchens, first {{published}} in 2010.

The book is partly intended {{as a response to}} God Is Not Great, a book written by his brother Christopher Hitchens in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Andrée ignored many {{early signs}} of the dangers {{associated}} with his balloon plan. Being able to steer the balloon to some extent was essential for a safe journey, and {{there was plenty of}} evidence that the drag-rope steering technique he had invented was ineffective; yet he staked the fate of the expedition on drag ropes. Worse, the polar balloon Örnen (The Eagle) was delivered directly to Svalbard from its manufacturer in Paris without being tested; when measurements showed it to be leaking more than expected, Andrée refused to acknowledge the alarming implications. Most modern students of the expedition see Andrée's optimism, faith in the power of technology, and disregard for the forces of nature as the main factors in the series of events <b>that</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> death and those of his two companions Nils Strindberg (1872–97) and Knut Frænkel (1870–97).|$|E
5|$|Phan {{was never}} {{known for his}} {{scholarly}} abilities; it was his reputation for principled integrity <b>that</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> quick rise through the ranks under the reign of Emperor Tự Đức. He was first appointed as a district mandarin in Ninh Bình Province, where he punished a Vietnamese Roman Catholic priest, who, with the tacit support of French missionaries, had harassed local non-Catholics. Amid the diplomatic controversy that followed, he avoided blaming the unpopular alliance between Vietnamese Catholics and the French on Catholicism itself, stating that the partnership had arisen {{out of the military}} and political vulnerabilities of Vietnam's imperial government. Despite this, the Huế court eventually removed Phan from this post.|$|E

5|$|Soegijapranata {{left for}} Semarang on 30September 1940 and was consecrated by Willekens on 6October at the Holy Rosary Church in Randusari, which later became his seat; this consecration made Soegijapranata the first native Indonesian bishop. The {{ceremony}} {{was attended by}} numerous political figures and sultans from Batavia, Semarang, Yogyakarta, and Surakarta, as well as clergy from Malang and Lampung; Soegijapranata's first act as vicar was to issue a pastoral letter with Willekens that outlined the historical background <b>that</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> appointment, including Pope BenedictXV's apolistic letter Maximum Illud, which called for more local clergy, and Pope PiusXI and Pope PiusXII's efforts to appoint more pastors and bishops from native ethnic groups worldwide. Soegijapranata began working on the Church hierarchy in the region, establishing new parishes.|$|E
5|$|According to the indictment, {{the crime}} {{organization}} headed by Itzhak and Meir Abergil ran a flourishing money-laundering {{business in the}} US from 2002 to 2006, processing {{tens of millions of}} dollars of funds embezzled from the Israel Trade Bank, through the “Jerusalem Gang′s” extortion of Ofer Maximov, <b>that</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> sister Etti Alon′s embezzling 250 million shekel. The money was given out as loans to Israeli businesspeople in the United States, who were later extorted to give up their businesses if they did not pay up. Meir Abergil, described as the person in charge of finances, collected the money that was exacted and later laundered and invested it. Gabi Ben Harosh of the “Jerusalem Gang” who was arrested in Los Angeles in 2004, ran the lending bank in the United States and updated Meir and Itzhak Abergil on its balance. Sasson Barashi of Jerusalem and Hai Vaknin of Los Angeles identified borrowers and businesses and also saw to the collection of the money. Yoram Elal, who has fled to Brazil, was responsible for special-operations. The activities have been documented in hundreds of surveillance reports, photographs and phone calls, which were recorded by police departments all over the world and are detailed in the indictment.|$|E

Medically evacuated due to sickness shortly after the battle, he later served on the Western Front and finished the war as a second lieutenant. He returned to the banking profession but was recalled to active duty during the Second World War. He served on the Home Front {{and by the time he}} was taken off active duty in December 1943, he had been promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and was commander of signals in the Northern Military District. When he retired from his banking career he became a justice of the peace in Devonport. He died in 1983 at the age of 91.|$|E

5|$|Despite the setbacks, Kasztner, Hansi Brand and {{the rest}} of the {{committee}} secured the release of around 1,684 Jews, including 273 children, who were allowed to leave Budapest for Switzerland by train on 30 June 1944. The committee paid SS officer Kurt Becher $1000 per person in foreign currency, shares, jewellery and gold, raised from the wealthier passengers to cover the cost of the rest. After an unexplained detour to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, the passengers arrived in Switzerland in two batches in August and December that year. Joel Brand's mother, sister and niece were on the train, as were 10 members of Kasztner's family and 388 people from the Kolozsvár ghetto in his home town. Kastner's relationship with these passengers led to the criticism that his negotiations with Becher had focused on saving people he knew, an allegation <b>that</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> assassination in 1957.|$|E
5|$|During the conflict, it is {{revealed}} that Tobi is Obito Uchiha, a former teammate of Kakashi's who {{was thought to}} be dead. The real Madara saved Tobi's life, and they have since collaborated. As Sasuke learns the history of Konoha, including the circumstances <b>that</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> clan's downfall, he decides to protect the village and rejoins Naruto and Sakura to thwart Madara and Obito's plans. However, Madara's body ends up possessed by Kaguya Ōtsutsuki, an ancient princess who intends to subdue all humanity. A reformed Obito sacrifices himself to help Team 7 stop her. Once Kaguya is sealed, Madara dies as well. Sasuke takes advantage of the situation and takes control of all the Tailed Beasts, as he reveals his goal of ending the current village system. Naruto confronts Sasuke to dissuade him from his plan, and after they almost kill each other in a final battle, Sasuke admits defeat and reforms. After the war, Kakashi becomes the Sixth Hokage and pardons Sasuke for his crimes. Years later, Kakashi steps down while Naruto marries Hinata Hyuga and becomes the Seventh Hokage, raising the next generation.|$|E
5|$|Sheila {{continued}} with her secretarial course, then {{trained as a}} hairdresser, and briefly found work as a model with the Lucie Clayton agency, which included two months' work in Tokyo. She got pregnant again, and she and Colin married at Chelmsford Registry Office in May 1977 when Sheila was 20, but she lost the baby at six months. The Bambers bought the couple a garden flat in Carlingford Road, Hampstead, to help Sheila recuperate. She suffered another miscarriage, then on 22 June 1979, after four months of bed rest in hospital, {{she gave birth to}} the twins. At around this time, Colin began an affair, one <b>that</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> leaving Sheila five months after the birth. Sheila became increasingly upset; on one occasion, when Colin left a party with another woman, she required hospital treatment after breaking a window with her fist.

5|$|On December 2, 2000, he was {{scheduled}} to fight in a unification card against Fernando Vargas, the International Boxing Federation's junior middleweight champion. The fight began in a fast pace with Trinidad connecting a solid combination <b>that</b> <b>led</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> opponent being knocked down. Vargas was able to stand up, but another combination injured him a second time and led to another knockdown. Early in the second round Trinidad was in the offensive but Vargas connected a solid combination at the round's closing moments which opened a cut over Trinidad's right eye. In the fourth round's opening seconds one of Vargas' punches connected on Trinidad's jaw and he fell, marking the eighth knockdown in his career. In the fifth round Vargas was in control of the fight's offensive, connecting combinations to Trinidads' body. In the sixth round Trinidad regained control of the fight's tempo that lasted throughout the contest, connecting punches on Vargas' head and left jabs to the ribs. In the eighth, Vargas displayed signs of exhaustion which slowed his offensive while Trinidad then pursued the offense with combinations to the body. This pattern continued throughout the ninth, tenth and eleventh rounds. Opening the final round Vargas was on the offensive, connecting a solid left hook. Trinidad countered the attack with a left hook that made Vargas collapse; Vargas was able to stand up, but was subsequently knocked down for a second time. With Vargas injured, Trinidad continued connecting combinations, until the referee stopped the fight by technical knockout.|$|E
