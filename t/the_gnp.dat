The cytotoxicity of <b>the</b> <b>GNPs</b> was evaluated using the 3 -(4, 5 -Dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) method against gastric mucous cell line GES- 1 and gastric cancer cell line MGC- 803. Rhodamine 6 G as a Raman probe was used for investigating surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) enhancement of <b>GNPs.</b> <b>The</b> transmission electron microscopy results indicated that <b>the</b> <b>GNPs</b> were spherical in structure and almost 20 nm in diameter.

In addition, a potential mechanism was proposed to interpret the formation process of GNPs, mainly based on the analysis of FTIR results. The FTIR spectrum confirmed that <b>the</b> <b>GNPs</b> were carried with N&ndash;H groups. Toxicological assays of as-prepared <b>GNPs</b> revealed that <b>the</b> green <b>GNPs</b> were nontoxic.

40|$|AbstractThe {{increasing}} demand for multifunctional polymer nanocomposites calls for {{new technologies to}} simultaneously enhance mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. This paper presents {{the use of an}} alternating-current electric field to align graphene nanoplatelets (GnPs) in an epoxy polymer. Theoretical modeling of the alignment process has identified the key parameters that control the rotation and chain-formation of <b>the</b> <b>GnPs.</b> Experimental results reveal that the resulting nanocomposites exhibit anisotropic properties with significantly improved electrical and thermal conductivities in the alignment direction, and dramatically increased fracture toughness when <b>the</b> <b>GnPs</b> are aligned transverse to the crack growth direction.

The dramatic improvement in the fracture toughness is attributed to multiple intrinsic and extrinsic toughening mechanisms including microcracking, pinning, deflection and branching of the crack, and rupture and pull-out of <b>the</b> <b>GnPs.</b> Such major improvement in the toughness arises from GnPs being transversely aligned to the crack growth direction exhibiting increased interactions with the advancing crack tip...|$|R
