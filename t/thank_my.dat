500|$|In a divisional {{playoff game}} against the Vikings on January 16, 2005, Mitchell caught a two-yard {{touchdown}} pass {{in the first quarter}} and celebrated by feigning to pull his pants up, a reference to the touchdown celebration by Vikings' wide receiver Randy Moss, who pretended to pull his pants down to moon Green Bay fans the week before and was heavily criticized for doing so.

500|$|Jackson had to {{deal with}} Presley's absence from rehearsals at Graceland and concert soundchecks. The singer would usually show up at the concert venue at the last minute, walk out on stage and start to sing, having never heard the sound system. Presley {{sometimes}} turned {{to the side of the}} stage to ask Jackson to make changes, and a few times he stopped the show to have Jackson come out and stand center stage and listen carefully to the monitors while Presley sang to 20,000 people. One night in Fort Worth, Texas, Presley led the audience in singing [...] "Happy Birthday to You" [...] in honour of the engineer's birthday—an [...] "amazing, and very embarrassing" [...] occasion for Jackson.

500|$|The {{presence}} of Terrell Owens in 2004 led to limited opportunities for Mitchell to catch passes {{and he showed}} his frustration {{on and off the}} field.

After the game, Mitchell said, [...] "I just want to <b>thank</b> <b>my</b> hands for being so great." [...] In the week prior to Super Bowl XXXIX against the New England Patriots, he created controversy by offending members of the Patriots' secondary, including Rodney Harrison. He caught one pass for 11yards in the Super Bowl and was released by the Eagles on May 6, 2005. The Kansas City Chiefs signed him shortly after, but he declined to have arthroscopic surgery on his injured knee and he was released before the start of the season. After his NFL career ended, Mitchell bought a barbecue restaurant in Lakeland in 2008, but the venue was closed in September 2009. Mitchell served time in prison for tax fraud from 2013 to 2016.|$|E
