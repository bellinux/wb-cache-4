Antiprotons are made by shooting a high-intensity proton beam at a conversion target, which needs to be made from a very high density material. Although tungsten may be used instead, iridium has the advantage of better stability under the shock waves induced by <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> due to the incident beam.|$|E
5|$|Thermotropic phases {{are those}} that occur in a certain {{temperature}} range. If <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> is too high, thermal motion will destroy the delicate cooperative ordering of the LC phase, pushing the material into a conventional isotropic liquid phase. At too low temperature, most LC materials will form a conventional crystal. Many thermotropic LCs exhibit a variety of phases as temperature is changed. For instance, on heating {{a particular type of}} LC molecule (called mesogen) may exhibit various smectic phases followed by the nematic phase and finally the isotropic phase as temperature is increased. An example of a compound displaying thermotropic LC behavior is para-azoxyanisole.|$|E

Aiming at <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>rising</b> fault, a method based on infrared image for {{power transmission line}} detection and fault diagnosis is proposed. First, we convert infrared image into gray image, enhance the contrast, and eliminate the interference and noise. Next, cellular automaton method is used to segment the target and background in preprocessed image. Then, power transmission line is recognized and detected by using Hessian matrix. Finally, the fault is diagnosed based on temperature, and fault location is also determined.

25|$|For {{semiconductor}} devices {{used in a}} variety of consumer and industrial electronics, the idea of thermal resistance simplifies the selection of heat sinks. The heat flow between the semiconductor die and ambient air is modeled as a series of resistances to heat flow; there is a resistance from the die to the device case, from the case to the heat sink, and from the heat sink to the ambient air. The sum of these resistances is the total thermal resistance from the die to the ambient air. Thermal resistance is defined as temperature rise per unit of power, analogous to electrical resistance, and is expressed in units of degrees Celsius per watt (°C/W). If the device dissipation in watts is known, and the total thermal resistance is calculated, <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> of the die over the ambient air can be calculated.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with the}} main {{combustor}} in a gas turbine, the afterburner has both a case and a liner, serving the same purpose as their main combustor counterparts. One major difference between a main combustor and an afterburner is that <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>rise</b> is not constrained by a turbine section, therefore afterburners {{tend to have a}} much higher temperature rise than main combustors. Another difference is that afterburners are not designed to mix fuel as well as primary combustors, so not all the fuel is burned within the afterburner section. Afterburners also often require the use of flameholders to keep the velocity of the air in the afterburner from blowing the flame out. These are often bluff bodies or [...] "vee-gutters" [...] directly behind the fuel injectors that create localized low speed flow in the same manner the dome does in the main combustor.|$|E

This level is considered a tipping point. [...] "The amount of greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is already above the threshold that can potentially cause dangerous climate change. We are already at risk of many areas of pollution...It's not next year or next decade, it's now." [...] The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has stated [...] "Climate change {{is not just a}} distant future threat. It is the main driver behind rising humanitarian needs and we are seeing its impact. The number of people affected and the damages inflicted by extreme weather has been unprecedented." [...] Further, OCHA has stated:Climate disasters are on the rise. Around 70 percent of disasters are now climate related – up from around 50 percent from two decades ago. These disasters take a heavier human toll and come with a higher price tag. In the last decade, 2.4 billion people were affected by climate related disasters, compared to 1.7 billion in the previous decade. The cost of responding to disasters has risen tenfold between 1992 and 2008.Destructive sudden heavy rains, intense tropical storms, repeated flooding and droughts are likely to increase, as will the vulnerability of local communities in the absence of strong concerted action.Environment destruction caused by humans is a global problem, and this is a problem that is on going every day. By year 2050, the global human population is expected to grow by 2 billion people, thereby reaching a level of 9.6 billion people (Living Blue Planet 24). The human effects on Earth can be seen in many different ways. A main one is <b>the</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>rise,</b> and according to the report ”Our Changing Climate”, the global warming that {{has been going on for}} the past 50 years is primarily due to human activities (Walsh, et al. 20). Since 1895, the U.S. average temperature has increased from 1.3°F to 1.9°F, with most of the increase taken place since around year 1970 (Walsh, et al. 20).|$|E
