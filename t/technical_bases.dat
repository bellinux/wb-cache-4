The technical branch was a certified EASA Part-145 maintenance organization with approximately 1200 employees providing services to both Air Berlin group aircraft and customers throughout Europe. airberlin technik was recognized and approved by various National Airworthiness Authorities such as USA FAA-145, Canadian CAA-145, Aruba EASA-145, Federal Aviation Authority of Russia, GCAA, United Arab Emirates.

25|$|Twenty {{years were}} allowed to {{construct}} the material and <b>technical</b> <b>bases</b> of communism. In the South, material construction and systemic transformation were to be combined in order to hasten economic integration with the North. It was considered critical for the VCP to improve and extend its involvement in economic affairs {{so that it could}} guide this process. Development plans were to focus equally on agriculture and industry, while initial investment was to favor projects that developed both sectors of the economy. Thus, for example, heavy industry was intended to serve agriculture on the premise that a rapid increase in agricultural production would in turn fund further industrial growth. With this strategy, Vietnamese leaders claimed that the country could bypass the capitalist industrialization stage necessary to prepare for communism.|$|E
2500|$|The Army Air Forces <b>Technical</b> <b>Base</b> (Air Force <b>Technical</b> <b>Base</b> {{before being}} {{designated}} a USAF base) was formed on 15 December 1945, under Brig Gen Joseph T. Morris, during the World War II drawdown by merging Wright Field, Patterson Field, Dayton Army Air Field, and—acquired by Wright Field for 1942 glider testing--Clinton Army Air Field. The Jamestown Radar Annex became a leased {{installation of the}} <b>Technical</b> <b>Base</b> in 1946, and the [...] "custodial units at Dayton and Clinton County AAFlds were discontinued in 1946". An 8000-foot concrete runway with 1000-foot runoffs at each end was built 1946–1947 in Area C to accommodate very heavy bombers, initially referred to locally as the [...] "B-36 runway". The 1947 All-Altitude Speed Course at Vandalia became a detached installation of the <b>Technical</b> <b>Base</b> and after the USAF was created in September 1947, Morris' base headquarters was redesignated Headquarters, Air Force <b>Technical</b> <b>Base,</b> on 15 December 1947.|$|R

25|$|With the 1950s came {{increasing}} {{awareness of}} the potential of automatic devices for literature searching and information storage and retrieval. As these concepts grew in magnitude and potential, so did the variety of information science interests. By the 1960s and 70s, there was a move from batch processing to online modes, from mainframe to mini and microcomputers. Additionally, traditional boundaries among disciplines began to fade and many information science scholars joined with library programs. They further made themselves multidisciplinary by incorporating disciplines in the sciences, humanities and social sciences, {{as well as other}} professional programs, such as law and medicine in their curriculum. By the 1980s, large databases, such as Grateful Med at the National Library of Medicine, and user-oriented services such as Dialog and Compuserve, were for the first time accessible by individuals from their personal computers. The 1980s also saw the emergence of numerous special interest groups to respond to the changes. By the end of the decade, special interest groups were available involving non-print media, social sciences, energy and the environment, and community information systems. Today, information science largely examines <b>technical</b> <b>bases,</b> social consequences, and theoretical understanding of online databases, widespread use of databases in government, industry, and education, and the development of the Internet and World Wide Web.|$|E
500|$|On 8 June 1946, the Study Commission for Nuclear Energy ( [...] – SKA) {{was created}} by the Swiss {{government}} under the leadership of Dr. Paul Scherrer, a physicist and professor at ETH Zurich. The commission had the objective of studying the civil use of atomic energy and the secret objective of studying the scientific and <b>technical</b> <b>bases</b> for building nuclear weapons. The activity of this group was low and only slow progress was made; however the events of the Cold War, especially the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956 and the nuclear arms race of the mid-1950s, provided new impetus. While his specific role is questioned, Scherrer {{played an important role in}} the Swiss nuclear program.|$|E

50|$|In spring 1941, {{continuing}} to refuse defeat, he secretly {{took part in}} the establishment of a plan of allied intervention in North Africa, with some comrades from the circles of General Maxime Weygand and Marshal Philippe Pétain. Others like him such as Captain Beaufre and the commanders Dartois and Loustanau-Lacau were denounced, arrested and executed. He himself only just escaped from the same fate. Promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel in September 1941, he did not discontinue to work for the resistance in secret, by drawing up notes evaluating the <b>technical</b> <b>bases</b> for a future allied invasion of North Africa. In January 1942, he became military adviser to the Algiers resistant group directed by Henri d'Astier de la Vigerie and José Aboulker. In disgrace, under Vichy orders he was put in control of regulating supply transport bound for the Rommel army, in accordance with the agreements passed through the general delegation of Weygand and Germany (Dankworth Contract). He benefitted from it as he was able to provide information for the allied secret services, all the while endeavouring to slow down and block the transports bound for Afrika Korps.|$|E
