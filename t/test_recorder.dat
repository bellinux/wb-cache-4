40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} with third-grade children in a university laboratory school to determine the relative effectiveness of a method for teaching recorder in which the sequential objectives are logically ordered by Edwin Gordon's empirical model of learning sequence and a traditional method which stresses note reading. The criteria used for comparison were change in the level of developmental music aptitude and performance achievement on the recorder. A review of the literature supported Edwin Gordon's theory of developmental music aptitude which proposes that until about age nine, environmental factors can affect the level of music aptitude, and, at about age nine, music aptitude stabilizes. The review of the literature also supported the use of singing activities with instrumental instruction, and the application of verbal association systems to tonal and rhythmic patterns as pedagogical techniques. Treatment for the control group involved a teaching-learning procedure in which individual fingerings, pitches, and rhythm symbols were presented in isolation and assembled in playing songs from notation. The method used with the experimental group involved a teaching-learning sequence in which children first learned to sing the song by rote. In learning to play the song on the recorder, each melodic and rhythmic pattern was isolated and initially sung or chanted. A verbal association system was then associated with the tonal and rhythmic pattern. The notation representing the pattern was introduced after extensive aural and verbal association experience, and after learning several songs. Primary sources of data included: pretest/posttest using Gordon's PMMA to measure developmental music aptitude change, and a rating scale <b>test</b> to measure <b>recorder</b> performance achievement.

40|$|The {{electroencephalography}} (EEG) is {{a technique}} commonly used for detecting symptoms of neurological diseases such as epilepsy, sleep disorders, anxiety and learning disabilities that are quite diffused and with {{a great impact on}} people common life. Most of the mentioned mental disorders require long term EEG monitoring, possibly during daily life activities, to follow the course of the disease and sometimes to prevent further degradations of the patient condition. Generally, the longer the EEG measurement period isthe higher is the probability of a successful event detection. Allowing only few hours of observation time with high costs and resource overheads, traditional inpatient ambulatory EEG systems don’t satisfy these requirements. It is only recently that technology innovations have led to new outpatient EEG systems. They are mobile solutions that overcome some of these limitations reducing the overall patient monitoring costs and increasing the effectiveness of the measurements [1]. Despite their benefits, such systems are still cumbersome with some problems related to the electrode-skin adherence, to the data storage capability and to the battery life time. Wearable EEG such as those presented in [2] and [3], are aimed to overcome these issues, allowing the recording of a longer temporal window that includes all stages of sleep and wakefulness and increasing the likelihood of recording typical symptoms. The wearable EEG system proposed in this paper is based on a custom PCB with off-the-shelf components. Being a wearable device, special efforts were made in reducing its power consumption and in device miniaturization. As a result, only the essential components were included in the project: an amplyfing/filtering block, an analog todigital converter, a micro-controller, a bluetooth transceiver and a power management module. The designed system, depicted in Fig. 1, contains a differential 8 channel recording unit. The EEG signals detected with a standard EEG cap are first amplified and then converted into a 24 -bit digital signals by an ADS 1299 from Texas Instrument. Once acquired, digital signals are transmitted to a remote backend by means of a Microchip Bluetooth RN- 42 module. Moreover, a USB connection was introduced to charge the EEG recorder battery and as additional channel for data transfer. A custom firmware was written for a Microchip PIC 18 F 46 J 50 to coordinate data exchange between ADCand Bluetooth or USB external controller. The main constraint was the real time data exchange at sampling frequency up to 2000 SPS. In addition a power management unit generates all digital and analog voltage supplies from a 3. 7 V- 950 mAh LiPo battery. Even the battery charging circuit was implemented on the board. The EEG recorder was realized on the 5. 5 cm X 3. 5 cm double face board depicted in Fig. 2. Possible remote controllers for wearable EEG recording applicationsare the nowadays widely diffused smartphone or tablet. So that an open source and user-friendly software application based, for example, on Android operative system, can be a target solution to interface our EEG recorder. At this first stage of the system development a Visual C++ application was written for the EEG <b>recorder</b> <b>testing</b> purpose. The small dimensions of the realized system and its maximum 270 mW of power consumption make it suitable for up to 13 hours of continuous EEG recording without encumbering any daily life activity.

However, because of certain hardware related inconsistencies, its performance declines, particularly, when acquiring non-repetitive, fast-rising, high frequency signals. The error and distortion contributed due to its declining performance, for the entire range of signals, can be comprehensively characterized by the static and dynamic nonlinearities. Actual testing of ADCs is the only way of estimating these indices. These characteristics reveal information at the microscopic level, such as bit-level aberrations, code transitions, response and settling trends, etc. These tests attain greater significance, when the digitizer is part of a reference measuring or a calibration system, because, the levels of accuracies to be achieved in such a setup may become comparable to the error introduced by the ADC. Hence, testing ADCs is a priority. International and national standards exist for <b>testing</b> digital waveform <b>recorders</b> and ADCs. For several years, the matter related to reducing static test time of high-resolution ADCs was highlighted through many publications. A critical examination of the literature indicates the major schools-of-thought pursued so far, are, (i) refinements to ramp/triangular signal based static testing, (ii) proposals for use of alternative methods and/or test signals for static test, (iii) innovative ways of achieving a relaxation in signal source requirements and, (iv) efforts to combine static and dynamic test into a single test with an appropriate test signal. As a consequence of the literature review, objectives of the thesis were formulated. They attempt to resolve- (i) Conceive a suitable test signal for simultaneous estimation of static and dynamic nonlinearity through a single test (ii) Explore possibility of employing a low-linearity ramp signal to estimate static nonlinearity (iii) Estimating static nonlinearity by exploiting linearity property of a sine signal • In {{the first part of the}} thesis, a method is proposed for the concurrent estimation of static and dynamic nonlinearity characteristics of an ADC, with the application of a single test signal. The novelty arises from the fact that the test signal proposed is new, and so is the concept of extracting the static and dynamic nonlinearity from the ADC output. This was achieved by conceiving a test signal, comprising of a high frequency sinusoid (which addresses the dynamic requirement), modulated by a low frequency ramp (which addresses the static requirement). • Static characteristics of an ADC can be determined directly from the histogram-based quasi-static approach by measuring the ADC output, when excited by an ideal ramp/triangular signal of sufficiently low frequency. This approach requires only a fraction of time compared to the conventional DC test, is straightforward, easy to implement, and, in principle is an accepted method as per the revised IEEE- 1057. However, the only drawback is that ramp signal sources are not ideal. Thus, nonlinearity present in the ramp signal gets superimposed on the measured ADC characteristics, which renders them, as such, unusable. The second part of the work describes a proposal to get rid of the ramp signal nonlinearity, before it is applied to the ADC. A simple method is presented which employs a low-linearity ramp signal, but yet causes only a fraction of influence on the measured ADC static characteristics. • The third part of the thesis describes a novel method to estimate the actual static characteristics of an ADC using a low frequency sine signal, say, less than 10 Hz, by employing the histogram-based approach. It is based on the well known fact that variation of sine signal is ‘reasonably linear,’ when the angle is small. In the proposed method, the ADC under test has to be ‘fed’ with this ‘linear’ portion of the sine wave. Due to harmonics and offset in input excitation, this ‘linear’ part of the sine signal is marginally different, compared to an ideal ramp signal of equal amplitude. However, since it is a sinusoid, this difference can be accurately determined and later compensated from the measured ADC output. Thus, the corrected ADC output will correspond to the true ADC static nonlinearity. The proposed approach successfully addresses all the three concerns while estimating static linearity, i. e. it is time-efficient, excites all the ADC code-bins reasonably uniformly and tackles the source linearity issue quite nicely. These proposals are novel, simple, easy to implement, time-efficient and importantly static nonlinearity characteristics determined from them are in good agreement with that estimated by the original DC-based technique. Implementation of each method is discussed along with experimental results, for two 8 -bit digital oscilloscopes and a 10 -bit real time digitizer.
