5|$|In 1998 the {{discovery}} of a possible dust disk around 55 Cancri A was announced.

5|$|In 2001, {{preliminary}} astrometric measurements {{made by the}} Hipparcos probe {{suggested the}} orbit of 47 UMa b is inclined at an angle of 63.1° to <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky, implying the planet's true mass is around 2.9 times that of Jupiter. However, subsequent analysis suggested the Hipparcos measurements were not precise enough to accurately determine the orbits of substellar companions, and the inclination and true mass remain unknown.|$|E

Surface features of various moons were seen for the first time. Voyager 1 performed a close flyby of Titan, increasing knowledge of {{the atmosphere of the}} moon. It proved that Titan's atmosphere is impenetrable in visible wavelengths; therefore no surface details were seen.

5|$|Most {{asteroid}}s {{within the}} asteroid belt have orbital eccentricities of less than 0.4, and an inclination of less than 30°.

5|$|Pallas's {{surface is}} most likely {{composed}} of a silicate material; its spectrum and estimated density resemble carbonaceous chondrite meteorites.

5|$|The {{dynamical}} {{effects of}} Planet Nine would explain five {{aspects of the}} Solar System: the clustering of the orbits of extreme trans-Neptunian objects (eTNOs); the high perihelia of objects like Sedna that are detached from Neptune's influence; the high inclinations of eTNOs with orbits roughly perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Solar System, high inclination Kuiper belt objects with semi-major axis less than 100 AU, and the obliquity, or tilt, of the Sun's axis relative to <b>the</b> <b>plane</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Solar System. While other mechanisms have been offered {{for many of these}} peculiarities the gravitational influence of Planet Nine {{is the only one that}} explains all five. The dynamical effects of Planet Nine also excite the inclinations of scattering objects, which in numerical simulations leaves the inclination distribution of short-period comets with a broader distribution than is observed.|$|E
