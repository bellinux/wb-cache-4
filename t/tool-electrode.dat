50|$|The {{presence}} of these small craters on the tool results in the gradual erosion of the electrode. This erosion of the <b>tool-electrode</b> is {{also referred to as}} wear. Strategies are needed to counteract the detrimental effect of the wear on the geometry of the workpiece. One possibility is that of continuously replacing the <b>tool-electrode</b> during a machining operation. This is what happens if a continuously replaced wire is used as electrode. In this case, the correspondent EDM process is also called wire EDM. The <b>tool-electrode</b> can also be used {{in such a way that}} only a small portion of it is actually engaged in the machining process and this portion is changed on a regular basis. This is, for instance, the case when using a rotating disk as a <b>tool-electrode.</b> The corresponding process is often also referred to as EDM grinding.|$|E
5000|$|Electrical {{discharge}} machining (EDM), {{also known as}} spark machining, spark eroding, burning, die sinking, wire burning or wire erosion, is a manufacturing process whereby a desired shape is obtained by using electrical discharges (sparks). Material {{is removed from the}} workpiece by a series of rapidly recurring current discharges between two electrodes, separated by a dielectric liquid and subject to an electric voltage. One of the electrodes is called the <b>tool-electrode,</b> or simply the [...] "tool" [...] or [...] "electrode," [...] while the other is called the workpiece-electrode, or [...] "workpiece." [...] The process depends upon the tool and workpiece not making actual contact.|$|E
50|$|Ideally, EDM {{can be seen}} as {{a series}} of {{breakdown}} and restoration of the liquid dielectric in-between the electrodes. However, caution should be exerted in considering such a statement because it is an idealized model of the process, introduced to describe the fundamental ideas underlying the process. Yet, any practical application involves many aspects that may also need to be considered. For instance, the removal of the debris from the inter-electrode volume is likely to be always partial. Thus the electrical properties of the dielectric in the inter-electrodes volume can be different from their nominal values and can even vary with time. The inter-electrode distance, often also referred to as spark-gap, is the end result of the control algorithms of the specific machine used. The control of such a distance appears logically to be central to this process. Also, not all of the current between the dielectric is of the ideal type described above: the spark-gap can be short-circuited by the debris. The control system of the electrode may fail to react quickly enough to prevent the two electrodes (tool and workpiece) from coming into contact, with a consequent short circuit. This is unwanted because a short circuit contributes to material removal differently from the ideal case. The flushing action can be inadequate to restore the insulating properties of the dielectric so that the current always happens in the point of the inter-electrode volume (this is referred to as arcing), with a consequent unwanted change of shape (damage) of the <b>tool-electrode</b> and workpiece. Ultimately, a description of this process in a suitable way for the specific purpose at hand is what makes the EDM area such a rich field for further investigation and research.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effect of the tool wear on the {{accuracy}} of the micro EDM machined surfaces where simple shaped cylindrical rotating tool-electrodes are used. The tool electrode wear affects the precision of machined micro features and causes distortion of the original <b>tool-electrode</b> shape and dimensions. Tool shape deformation and especially its random variations in the volumetric wear are the two main factors affecting the applicability of wear compensation methods as well as indicating the precision achievable with the micro EDM process.

40|$|AbstractWire {{electrochemical}} micromachining (WECMM) is {{a promising}} method for the fabrication of various metal parts. In recent years, WECMM has attracted increasing interest, especially {{for treatment of}} complex-shaped microworkpieces. By now, the regularities of electrochemical shaping for the complex-shaped workpieces have not been adequately investigated, {{because the majority of}} the works, which are devoted to WECMM, are experimental. In this work WECMM is studied theoretically. The Laplace equation for the electric potential and the equation of workpiece surface evolution are used as the mathematical model of the process. A scheme of computer simulation involves the numerical solution of the Laplace equation by the boundary element method; the determination of a new position of workpiece surface with regard for possible topological changes; and the motion of wire <b>tool-electrode</b> along a prescribed trajectory. Various schemes of shaping for the tool-electrodes with various cross-section shapes and various types of motions are analyzed. As a result of simulation, the dependences of the front and side interelectrode gaps on the machining parameters are obtained. They can be used for determining the path of wire <b>tool-electrode</b> in order to obtain the prescribed shape and sizes of workpiece surface...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The present {{experimental}} {{study has been}} focused to evaluate surface characteristics of cryogenically- treated (shallow/deep) tool-electrodes using powder mixed electric discharge machining. Due to the continuously growing demand of complex and precise parts, tool-electrodes have its own importance, because quality of the machined parts depends upon the surface quality of electrode. On the analogy, eighteen experiments were performed based on L 18 orthogonal array of Taguchi’s methodology, which consist eight input parameters. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to designate the level of significance of input parameters. Electrode material has maximum influence followed by the current and pulse on-time on electrode finish. The combination of optimum factor’s level of identified parameters was determined using Taguchi’s technique for single response. Confirmation experiments were conducted using suggested optimal parameters with its respective level to minimize the <b>tool-electrode</b> surface roughness.

40|$|We are {{surrounded}} by glass! This material has been greatly used for thousand years. More than 2000 years ago in ancient Egypt glass was used to manufacture bottles of perfume. So its first uses were primarily related to decoration and jewellery. The researchers left its decorative use to introduce it to new technologies. Today miniaturisation is a major technological challenge. Material machining to micrometric or submicrometric scale becomes {{one of the key}} techniques for the future. Glass is often involved in these miniaturized devices. This interest can be explained by its properties: glass is transparent and has a good chemical durability. Many techniques of glass micromachining exist from laser to HF etching and sand powder blasting. In this work, we introduce a glass microstructuring technique, that we called Spark Assisted Chemical Engraving (SACE). It was presented {{for the first time in}} the Sixties to drill microholes in glass (diameter = 6  μ). Since the first use of SACE as machining technology in 1968, theoretical approaches were proposed in literature to understand the process. They are based on thermal models by finite elements method or on electrical characterization, with ohmic resistances calculations. They give a good quantitative approximation of the material removal rate. The goals of the thesis are to achieve a local understanding of the process and to highlight electrochemical and thermal phenomena involved around <b>tool-electrode</b> tip before and during SACE process. This thesis will try to answer two questions: How does SACE work? and how to apply it to microstructure glass? A new approach based on potential sweep is proposed to study the process. The originality consists in matching electrochemical measurements with high resolution photographs from the <b>tool-electrode.</b> This report is structured in three parts. A bibliographical part, which introduces not only glass as a material but also presents technologies for glass microstructuration (including SACE). A theoretical part, which focuses on describing current behaviour before spark formation, which allows material removal. It starts by a theoretical recall of variations of electric parameters (conductivity, resistance) as a function of gas hold-up. This theory is then applied to build a model, based on resistance calculations in the system. The goal of this model is to explain electrochemical measurements. An experimental part, which validates the theory developed to explain what happens before spark formation. Characteristics of sparks are then studied by a technique based on voltage pulses and used in a finite elements model. Finally, we will present concrete results, illustrating SACE possibilities to drill microholes. A mechanical prototype for SACE was developed during this thesis and is presented for microreactors fabrication and other glass microstructurations...|$|E
