She called the objection her [...] "opening shot {{to be able to}} focus the light of truth on <b>these</b> <b>terrible</b> problems in the electoral system". The Senate voted the objection down 74–1; the House voted the objection down 267–31.

2500|$|Richards and Jagger {{began their}} songwriting {{partnership}} in 1963 at {{the insistence of}} manager Andrew Loog Oldham who saw no long career in playing covers. The earliest Jagger/Richards collaborations were recorded by other artists, including Gene Pitney, whose rendition of [...] "That Girl Belongs to Yesterday" [...] was their first top-ten single in the UK. They scored another top-ten hit in 1964 with the debut single written for Marianne Faithfull, [...] "As Tears Go By". Richards recalls: [...] "We were writing <b>these</b> <b>terrible</b> pop songs that were becoming top ten hits... They {{had nothing to do with}} us, except we wrote 'em." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Boston Globes Wesley Morris {{raved about}} the leading actress: [...] "Julianne Moore {{is a star}} for <b>these</b> <b>terrible</b> times. She tends to be at her best when the world is at its worst. And things are pretty bad in [...] "Blindness," [...] a perversely enjoyable, {{occasionally}} harrowing adaptation of José Saramago's 1995 disaster allegory. [...] "Blindness" [...] is a movie whose sense of crisis feels right on time, even if the happy ending feels like a gratuitous emotional bailout. Meirelles ensures that the obviousness of the symbolism (in the global village the blind need guidance!) doesn't negate the story's power, nor the power of Moore's performance. The more dehumanizing things get, the fiercer she becomes." ...|$|E
2500|$|The next day, 7 May, U-333 was hunted by {{a convoy}} escort ship, and badly damaged by depth charges, forcing the U-boat {{to return to}} France.

The ship, carrying 2,006 tons of chrome ore from Beira in Portuguese East Africa to New York, was hit by two torpedoes and sank. Nine crewmen were killed, while 73 survivors were later {{picked up by the}} destroyer [...] Cremer noted in his Kriegstagebücher ("War diary") that the sinking of this ship was like [...]. a balm after <b>these</b> <b>terrible</b> depth charges.

2500|$|The film's director, Oliver Hirschbiegel, spoke {{positively}} {{about these}} parodies in a 2010 interview with New York magazine, saying {{that many of}} them were funny and they were a fitting extension of the film's purpose: [...] "The point of the film was to kick <b>these</b> <b>terrible</b> people off the throne that made them demons, making them real and their actions into reality. I think it's only fair if now it's taken as part of our history, and used for whatever purposes people like." [...] Nevertheless, Constantin Film has taken an [...] "ambivalent" [...] view of the parodies and has asked video sites to remove many of them. On 21 April 2010, the producers initiated a removal of parody videos from YouTube. This prompted posting of videos of Hitler complaining {{about the fact that the}} parodies were being taken down, and a resurgence of the videos on the site.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 September 1939, German forces invaded Poland; Britain and France {{joined the}} war against Germany. Following the German {{invasion}} of Norway, opinion turned against Chamberlain's conduct of the war; he resigned, and on 10 May 1940 Winston Churchill became Prime Minister. In July, following the Fall of France, when Britain stood almost alone against Germany, Hitler offered peace. Some politicians {{inside and outside the}} government were willing to consider the offer but Churchill would not. Chamberlain died on 9 November the same year. Churchill delivered a tribute to him in which he said, [...] "Whatever else history may or may not say about <b>these</b> <b>terrible,</b> tremendous years, we can be sure that Neville Chamberlain acted with perfect sincerity according to his lights and strove to the utmost of his capacity and authority, which were powerful, to save the world from the awful, devastating struggle in which we are now engaged." ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael Tigar, her attorney, {{stated that}} [...] "this case {{really is a}} threat to all the lawyers who are out there {{attempting}} to represent people that face <b>these</b> <b>terrible</b> consequences." [...] Supporters of Stewart alleged that the government charged her for her speech in defending the rights of her client. They believed that Stewart's efforts to release communications from her client were part of an appropriate defense method to gain public awareness and support. They also expressed alarm that wiretaps and hidden cameras authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act were used by the government to gather evidence against her, which they called a violation of attorney–client privilege. George Soros' Open Society Institute also donated $20,000 to Stewart's legal defense fund in 2002. Commenting on her case, human rights organization Front Line states that it [...] "has had a chilling effect on human rights defenders who stand between government agencies and potential victims of abuses." ...|$|E

2500|$|Asked {{to explain}} {{the success of his}} films, Almodóvar says that they are very entertaining: [...] "It's {{important}} not to forget that films are made to entertain. That's the key". He has also been noted for his tendency to shock audiences in his films by featuring outrageous situations or characters, which have served a political or commercial purpose to [...] "tell viewers that if the people on the screen could endure <b>these</b> <b>terrible</b> travails and still communicate, so could they". Almodóvar believes all his films to be political, [...] "even the most frivolous movie", but claimed that he had never attempted to pursue outright political causes or fight social injustice in his films; merely wanting to entertain and generate emotion. [...] "I'm not a political director. As a filmmaker, my commitment was to want to create free people, completely autonomous from a moral point of view. They are free regardless of their social class or their profession", remarked Almodóvar. However, he admitted that in his earlier films, which were released just after Franco's death, he wanted to create a world on film in which Franco and his repression did not exist, thereby [...] "providing a voice for Spain's marginalized groups".|$|E
2500|$|However, {{his start}} of {{secondary}} studies {{coincided with the}} beginning of World War I in September 1914 shortly followed with the school's financial problems, managed by a severe headmaster. Bourguiba stated that back in that time, food was terrible: They served them a stew with squash and a macaroni at lunch while giving them a donut wrapped in newspaper and smelling oil, at breakfast. <b>These</b> <b>terrible</b> conditions led the students to protest, despite the headmaster's efforts to end the revolt. When he questioned Bourguiba, the young Habib denounced these horrible conditions, declaring that he did not deserve to be treated in this manner. Thinking {{that he was about to}} be punished, nothing happened and the young boy learned to dare, speak and denounce. He was also marked by the education he had and which started in him the germs of revolt. In his before final year, Bourguiba admired a talented student named Habib Jaouahdou. Jaouahdo explained to the pupils what was happening outside the walls of Sadiki and telling them all about the nationalist movement. His Arabic skills are reinforced by a marking professor: Mohamed Lasrem, who was as old as Bach Hamba and that Bourguiba remembered by saying: [...] "I have to recognize that it is thanks to him that we have learned, since then, to express ourselves and write in classical arabic. This language was, at first, taught, mainly in the form of various versions. We had to translate administrative letters".|$|E

60|$|After {{traversing}} this plateau {{for some}} distance, they came upon another range of hills, far loftier than those {{they had before}} crossed, and vastly higher than anything Roger had ever before beheld in his travels.
