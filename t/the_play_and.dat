5|$|Note: The {{short story}} {{takes place at}} an inn on the road from London to Norwich, but the play calls for Alsatian costumery. Otherwise, the plots {{of the short story}} and play are nearly identical. The summary below uses the names from <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>and</b> notes {{significant}} changes in plot between <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>and</b> short story. There are also various small changes to the order of events, not described.|$|E
5|$|Booth had {{free access}} to {{all parts of the}} theater as a famous and popular actor who had {{frequently}} performed at Ford's Theatre and who was well known to its owner John T. Ford, even having his mail sent there. He bored a spyhole into the door of the presidential box earlier that day so that he could check that his intended victim had made it to <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>and</b> observe the box's occupants.|$|E
5|$|Creatures of Impulse is a stage {{play by the}} English dramatist W. S. Gilbert, {{with music}} by the composer-conductor Alberto Randegger, which Gilbert adapted from his own short story. Both <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>and</b> the short story concern an {{unwanted}} and ill-tempered old fairy who enchants people to behave in a manner opposite to their natures, with farcical results.|$|E

5|$|Laurence Olivier's 1948 moody {{black-and-white}} Hamlet won Best Picture and Best Actor Oscars, and is still, , {{the only}} Shakespeare film {{to have done}} so.

5|$|At least 27 operas {{have been}} based on Romeo and Juliet. The earliest, Romeo und Julie in 1776, a Singspiel by Georg Benda, omits much of the action of <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>and</b> most of its {{characters}} and has a happy ending. It is occasionally revived. The best-known is Gounod's 1867 Roméo et Juliette (libretto by Jules Barbier and Michel Carré), a critical triumph when first performed and frequently revived today. Bellini's I Capuleti e i Montecchi is also revived from time to time, but has sometimes been judged unfavourably because of its perceived liberties with Shakespeare; however, Bellini and his librettist, Felice Romani, worked from Italian sources—principally Romani's libretto for Giulietta e Romeo by Nicola Vaccai—rather than directly adapting Shakespeare's play. Among later operas, there is Heinrich Sutermeister's 1940 work Romeo und Julia.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the fights}} between Troilus and Diomedes from the {{traditional}} narrative of Benoît and Guido take place {{the next day in}} Shakespeare's retelling. Diomedes captures Troilus' horse in the first fight and sends it to Cressida. Then the Trojan triumphs in the second, though Diomedes escapes. But in a deviation from this narrative it is Hector, not Troilus, whom the Myrmidons surround in the climatic battle of <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>and</b> whose body is dragged behind Achilles' horse. Troilus himself is left alive vowing revenge for Hector's death and rejecting Pandarus. Troilus' story ends, as it began, in medias res with him and the remaining characters in his love-triangle remaining alive.|$|E
5|$|City won {{immediate}} promotion as Second Division champions in 1902–03, with Meredith scoring 22 {{goals in}} 37 appearances and claiming a hat-trick against Chesterfield Town. Maley {{managed to find}} him a suitable inside-right partner in Jimmy Bannister, who was unselfish in his play and willing to feed the ball through to Meredith. He also played Sammy Frost at half-back, {{who was able to}} win the ball and bring Meredith into <b>the</b> <b>play,</b> <b>and</b> signed outside-left Frank Booth to balance the attack. Maley encouraged teamwork, meaning there was less pressure on Meredith from opposition defenders.|$|E

5|$|Fielding's ninth play, the {{unsuccessful}} The Letter Writers Or, a New Way to Keep a Wife at Home, ran {{for four}} nights as a companion piece to The Tragedy of Tragedies but was soon after replaced by The Welsh Opera on 22 April 1731. The play followed two characters whose wives are busy having affairs {{and how they}} attempt to keep their wives faithful. The immoral characters are forgiven within <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>and</b> {{there is a lack}} of moral commentary within the plot.|$|E
5|$|Following Virginia Tech's post-touchown kickoff, NC State {{began its}} second {{possession}} of the game at its 24-yard line after a short kick return. The NC State's second drive of the game was more successful than its first, but as before, the Wolfpack offense {{ground to a halt}} before penetrating too deeply into Tech territory, and State was forced to punt the ball back to Virginia Tech. The Hokie offense began work at its eight-yard line but went three and out and prepared to punt the ball back to NC State. Tech punter Tony Romero, kicking from the Tech goal line, had his kick blocked by State defender Derrick Taylor. The ball rolled into the Virginia Tech end zone and was recovered by an NC State's Brian Bulluck for a touchdown. <b>The</b> <b>play</b> <b>and</b> extra point tied the game at 77.|$|E

She {{appeared}} in the 1950 musical comedy Dance Me a Song, {{which turned out to}} be a flop, though it was choreographed by Agnes de Mille, who had won acclaim for Oklahoma! a few years earlier. As one of the play's principal stars, she appeared in several scenes, but the choreography was ravaged by critics, as was <b>the</b> <b>play,</b> <b>and</b> reviews of her performance were mixed.|$|E

5|$|Hoffman's second role of {{the year}} came {{opposite}} Meryl Streep and Amy Adams in John Patrick Shanley's Doubt, where he played Father Brendan Flynn– a priest accused of sexually abusing a 12-year-old African American student in the 1960s. Hoffman was already familiar with <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>and</b> appreciated the opportunity {{to bring it to}} the screen; in preparing for the role, he talked extensively to a priest who lived through the era. The film had a mixed reception, with some critics such as Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian suspicious of it as Oscar bait, but Hoffman gained second consecutive Best Supporting Actor nominations at the Oscars, BAFTAs, and Golden Globes, and was also nominated by the Screen Actors Guild.|$|E
5|$|In 1994 the Sydney Theatre Company {{commissioned}} Enright {{to develop}} the original 45-minute play into a full-length production. Blackrock retained the original four characters but also added nine others. It also extended the length of <b>the</b> <b>play,</b> <b>and</b> {{was considered to be}} a more fictionalised version of Leigh's murder, though many viewers still considered it to be a factual account of the crime. The narrative and emphasis were reshaped for an adult audience outside of a specifically educational environment, also shifting the plays focus. While A Property of the Clan focused on the possible motives for rape, Blackrock was said to focus on the boys involved in the crime, portraying them as victims of the society they live in.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous season the Giants headed into the 1985 season {{with a sense of}} optimism after their successful 1984 campaign and a 5–0 pre-season record. The Giants went 10–6, and Taylor spearheaded a defense that led the NFL in sacks with 68. Taylor had 13. One of the more memorable plays of his career occurred during this season. On a Monday Night Football game against the Redskins, Taylor's sack of Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann inadvertently resulted in a compound fracture of Theismann's right leg. After the sack, a distraught Taylor screamed for paramedics to attend to Theismann. Although this sack ended Theismann's career, Theismann has never blamed Taylor for the injury. Taylor says he has never seen video of <b>the</b> <b>play</b> <b>and</b> never wants to. During {{the first round of the}} playoffs, the Giants defeated the defending champion 49ers 17–3, but lost to the eventual champion Chicago Bears in the second round 21–0.|$|E

5|$|Tennessee's post-touchdown kickoff was {{returned}} to the Tech 33-yard line, but Virginia Tech decided to not run an inconsequential play to drain the final seconds from the clock and enter halftime. On the first play after the kickoff, Taylor threw a surprise pass downfield to Boykin, who was tackled at the Tennessee four-yard line. Instant replay revealed there were two seconds remaining on the game clock after <b>the</b> <b>play,</b> <b>and</b> Virginia Tech placekicker Matt Waldron came onto the field to complete a 21-yard field goal as time expired. The Hokies thus regained a 17-14 lead at halftime.|$|E
5|$|The {{crowd is}} {{notoriously}} loud during Seahawks games. It has twice held the Guinness World Record for loudest crowd roar {{at an outdoor}} stadium, first at 136.6 decibels in 2013, followed by a measurement of 137.6 decibels in 2014. Both records were eventually broken by crowds at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. The current record was set by fans at Arrowhead on September 29, 2014, in a Monday Night Football game against the New England Patriots, hitting 142.2 decibels. The noise {{has contributed to the}} team's home field advantage with an increase in false start (movement by an offensive player prior to <b>the</b> <b>play)</b> <b>and</b> delay of game (failure of the offense to snap the ball prior to the play clock expiring) penalties against visiting teams. The stadium was the first in the NFL to implement a FieldTurf artificial field. Numerous college and high school American football games have also been played at the stadium.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two main}} ways that the offense can advance the ball: running and passing. In a typical play, the quarterback calls <b>the</b> <b>play,</b> <b>and</b> the center passes the ball {{backwards}} and under his legs to the quarterback in {{a process known as}} the snap. The quarterback then either hands the ball off to a back, throws the ball or runs with it himself. The play ends when the player with the ball is tackled or goes out of bounds, or a pass hits the ground without a player having caught it. A forward pass can only be legally attempted if the passer is behind the line of scrimmage. In the NFL, a down also ends if the runner's helmet comes off.|$|E
5000|$|Hugh Trevor-Roper (1914-2003), historian: [...] "The {{available}} evidence that <b>the</b> <b>plays</b> <b>and</b> poems were <b>the</b> work of William Shakespeare of Stratford is weak and unconvincing".|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>plays</b> <b>and</b> autobiographies of Sean O'Casey are {{generally}} considered {{in isolation from}} each other as being two not only distinct, but also largely independent areas within his work. This thesis, however, embodies an approach to O'Casey's creative work as an organic whole, of which both <b>the</b> autobiographies <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>plays</b> are essential <b>and</b> interrelated parts. The writing of the autobiographies {{did not take place}} in isolation from <b>the</b> <b>plays,</b> but evolved {{over a period of time}} which was also central, and crucial, to the development of the author's work as a playwright; and each of the autobiographical volumes was written, in part or whole, while he was working too upon a play, or even <b>plays.</b> Since both <b>the</b> <b>plays</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> autobiographies are the product of the same creative imagination, <b>the</b> writing of <b>plays</b> <b>and</b> autobiographies contemporaneously must have, inevitably, presented countless opportunities for mutual influence between the natures of <b>the</b> <b>plays</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> autobiographies. And by re-integrating the autobiographical volumes into the main-stream of O'Casey's work in the order and position (with regard to <b>the</b> <b>plays)</b> in which they were written, it can be seen that such opportunities for mutual influence not only arose, but were very often utilised by the author to very great artistic effect. But <b>the</b> <b>plays</b> <b>and</b> autobiographies seem to have influenced each other in manifold ways and upon different levels, and the relationshipbetween them is not confined to that central period of the author'swork during which the autobiographical volumes were written, but involves also all <b>the</b> extant <b>plays</b> which were completed before the first autobiographical volume was begun, as well as all <b>the</b> <b>plays</b> which were only begun after the last autobiographical volume was completed. Indeed,as viewed through the changing perspective of the relationships of the autobiographies to successive individual plays,'the overall relationship and' interaction between <b>the</b> <b>plays</b> <b>and</b> autobiographies of Sean O'Casey can be seen not only to evolve in a definite and coherent, if complex, pattern, but also to assume gradually the power of being a prime force in directing the course of his dramatic work, and of being a chief source of inspiration in his creative life as a whole. <p...|$|R
