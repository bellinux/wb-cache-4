Arafat originally attempted to obtain a visa to Canada and later Saudi Arabia, but was unsuccessful in both attempts. In 1957, he applied for a visa to Kuwait (at the time a British protectorate) and was approved, based on his work in civil engineering. There he encountered two Palestinian friends: Salah Khalaf ("Abu Iyad") and Khalil al-Wazir ("Abu Jihad"), both official members of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. Arafat had met Abu Iyad while attending Cairo University and Abu Jihad in Gaza. Both would later become Arafat's top aides.

This study provides new insights on the role of ¯xed-term contracts by supporting the idea that worker turnover results from the allocation of unemployed workers with the right jobs. In such an economy, temporary contracts facilitate the screening process of match quality and increase worker turnover by inducing ¯rms to be less selective in whom they hire. As the fundamental quality of a match is persistent, ¯rms and workers could be induced to continue producing on a regular contract even with high termination costs. Finally, I propose to investigate how <b>temporary</b> <b>jobs</b> would a®ect the US economy where experience rating is an original feature of the unemployment bene¯t system.

He was {{influenced}} by the Marxist playwright Bertolt Brecht and was invited by Brecht to be his assistant at the East Berlin State Opera but turned down the offer. Feyerabend took various classes at the Weimar Academy, and returned to Vienna to study history and sociology. He became dissatisfied, however, and soon transferred to physics, where he met Felix Ehrenhaft, a physicist whose experiments would influence his later views on the nature of science. Feyerabend changed his course of studies to philosophy and submitted his final thesis on observation sentences. In his autobiography, he described his philosophical views during this time as [...] "staunchly empiricist". In 1948 he visited the first Alpbach Forum in Alpbach. There Feyerabend first met Karl Popper, who had a [...] "positive" [...] (early Popper), as well as [...] "negative" [...] (later Popper) effect on him. In 1949 he was {{a founding member of the}} Kraft Circle. In 1951, Feyerabend was granted a British Council scholarship to study under Wittgenstein. However, Wittgenstein died before Feyerabend moved to England. Feyerabend then chose Popper as his supervisor instead, and went to study at the London School of Economics in 1952. In his autobiography, Feyerabend explains that during this time, he was influenced by Popper: [...] "I had fallen for [...] ". After that, Feyerabend returned to Vienna and was involved in various projects; a translation of Karl Popper's Open Society and its Enemies, hunting down manuscripts Popper had left in Vienna, a report on the development of the humanities in Austria, and several articles for an encyclopedia.|$|E
