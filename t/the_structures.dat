5|$|Controversy {{regarding}} {{the identity of}} the filaments preserved in the first Sinosauropteryx specimen began almost immediately, as the team of scientists spent three days in Beijing examining the specimen under a microscope. The results of their studies (reported during a press conference at the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences on Thursday, April 24, 1997) were inconclusive; the team agreed that <b>the</b> <b>structures</b> preserved on Sinosauropteryx were not modern feathers, but suggested further research was required to discover their exact nature. Palaeontologist Alan Feduccia, who had not yet examined the specimen, wrote in Audubon Magazine that <b>the</b> <b>structures</b> of Sinosauropteryx (which he considered at the time to be a synonym of Compsognathus, as Compsognathus prima) were stiffening structures from a frill running along the back, and that dinosaur palaeontologists were engaging in wishful thinking when equating <b>the</b> <b>structures</b> with feathers. Subsequent publications saw some of the team members disagreeing over the identity of <b>the</b> <b>structures.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most {{researchers}} have {{disagreed with the}} identification of <b>the</b> <b>structures</b> as collagen or other structural fibres.

Gregory S. Paul reidentified what the collagen hypothesis's proponents consider a body outline outside of the fibres as an artefact of preparation: breakage and brushed-on sealant have been misidentified as {{the outline of the}} body.|$|E

5|$|A {{diffraction}} grating constructed of layers of chitin and air {{gives rise to}} the iridescent colours of various butterfly wing scales {{as well as to the}} tail feathers of birds such as the peacock. Hooke and Newton were correct in their claim that the peacock's colours are created by interference, but <b>the</b> <b>structures</b> responsible, being close to the wavelength of light in scale (see micrographs), were smaller than the striated structures they could see with their light microscopes. Another way to produce a {{diffraction grating}} is with tree-shaped arrays of chitin, as in the wing scales of some of the brilliantly coloured tropical Morpho butterflies (see drawing). Yet another variant exists in Parotia lawesii, Lawes's parotia, a bird of paradise. The barbules of the feathers of its brightly coloured breast patch are V-shaped, creating thin-film microstructures that strongly reflect two different colours, bright blue-green and orange-yellow. When the bird moves the colour switches sharply between these two colours, rather than drifting iridescently. During courtship, the male bird systematically makes small movements to attract females, so <b>the</b> <b>structures</b> must have evolved through sexual selection.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTwo {{iteration}} {{methods are}} proposed to solve real nonsymmetric positive definite Toeplitz systems of linear equations. These methods {{are based on}} Hermitian and skew-Hermitian splitting (HSS) and accelerated Hermitian and skew-Hermitian splitting (AHSS). By constructing an orthogonal matrix and using a similarity transformation, the real Toeplitz linear system {{is transformed into a}} generalized saddle point problem. Then <b>the</b> <b>structured</b> HSS and <b>the</b> <b>structured</b> AHSS iteration methods are established by applying the HSS and the AHSS iteration methods to the generalized saddle point problem. We discuss efficient implementations and demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>structured</b> HSS and <b>the</b> <b>structured</b> AHSS iteration methods have better behavior than the HSS iteration method in terms of both computational complexity and convergence speed. Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>structured</b> AHSS iteration method outperforms the HSS and <b>the</b> <b>structured</b> HSS iteration methods. <b>The</b> <b>structured</b> AHSS iteration method also converges unconditionally to the unique solution of the Toeplitz linear system. In addition, an upper bound for the contraction factor of <b>the</b> <b>structured</b> AHSS iteration method is derived.
