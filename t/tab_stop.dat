25|$|Navigation keys or cursor keys {{include a}} variety of keys which move the cursor to {{different}} positions on the screen. Arrow keys are programmed to move the cursor in a specified direction; page scroll keys, such as the Page Up and Page Down keys, scroll the page up and down. The Home key is used to return the cursor {{to the beginning of}} the line where the cursor is located; the End key puts the cursor at the end of the line. The Tab key advances the cursor to the next <b>tab</b> <b>stop.</b>|$|E
2500|$|To {{facilitate}} typewriter use {{in business}} settings, a tab (tabulator) key was {{added in the}} late nineteenth century. Before using the key, the operator had to set mechanical [...] "tab stops", pre-designated locations to which the carriage would advance when the tab key was pressed. This facilitated the typing of columns of numbers, freeing the operator from the need to manually position the carriage. The first models had one <b>tab</b> <b>stop</b> and one tab key; later ones allowed as many stops as desired, and sometimes had multiple tab keys, each of which moved the carriage a different number of spaces ahead of the decimal point (the <b>tab</b> <b>stop),</b> to facilitate the typing of columns with numbers of different length ($1.00, $10.00, $100.00, etc.) ...|$|E
50|$|Center: text is {{centered}} at the <b>tab</b> <b>stop.</b>|$|E
50|$|Originally, printer {{mechanisms}} used mechanical <b>tab</b> <b>stops</b> {{to indicate}} where the tabs went. This was done horizontally with movable metal prongs in a row, and vertically with a loop of mylar or other tape {{the length of}} a page with holes punched in it to indicate the <b>tab</b> <b>stops.</b> These were manually set to match the pre-printed forms that were loaded into the printer.|$|R
5000|$|Rich-text Editing features, such as space wrap, <b>tab</b> <b>stops,</b> {{and dynamic}} {{property}} changes for inter-character space, line indents, and line gaps.|$|R
50|$|As an example, one {{programmer}} prefers <b>tab</b> <b>stops</b> of {{four and}} has his toolset configured this way, and uses these to format his code.|$|R
50|$|Left: text {{extends to}} the right from the <b>tab</b> <b>stop.</b>|$|E

50|$|A <b>tab</b> <b>stop</b> on a {{typewriter}} is a location where the carriage movement is halted by mechanical gears. Tab stops are set manually, and pressing the tab key causes the carriage {{to go to}} the next <b>tab</b> <b>stop.</b> In text editors on a computer, the same concept is implemented simplistically with automatic, fixed tab stops.|$|E
50|$|Another {{programmer}} prefers <b>tab</b> <b>stops</b> of eight, and his toolset is configured this way. When {{he examines}} his code, {{he may well}} {{find it difficult to}} read.|$|R
5000|$|One {{widely used}} {{solution}} to this issue may involve forbidding the use of tabs for alignment or rules on how <b>tab</b> <b>stops</b> must be set. Note that tabs work fine provided they are used consistently, restricted to logical indentation, and not used for alignment: ...|$|R
5000|$|At their simplest, TextMate “snippets” are {{pieces of}} text {{which can be}} {{inserted}} into the document at the current location via a context-sensitive key stroke or tab completion. Snippets are [...] "intelligent", supporting [...] "tab stops" [...] dynamic updating, access to environment variables, {{and the ability to}} run inline scripts. This allows complicated behaviors. <b>Tab</b> <b>stops</b> can be cycled through using the “tab” key and support default text, drop-downs, to complete elements of the snippet. The results of these <b>tab</b> <b>stops</b> can be dynamically changed in another portion of the snippet, as the user fills in a stop. TextMate environment variables can be used, supporting information about the current scope, line number, or author name, etc. Snippets also have the ability to run inline shell scripts.|$|R

50|$|The present organ {{was built}} by Father Henry Willis and {{installed}} in 1888. Slight modifications were made to this instrument in 1936; it was electrified and enlarged in 1960 when a new console with <b>tab</b> <b>stops</b> was provided. Further tonal modifications and additions were made in 1968.|$|R
50|$|TSV is an {{alternative}} to the common comma-separated values (CSV) format, which often causes difficulties because of the need to escape commas - literal commas are very common in text data, but literal <b>tab</b> <b>stops</b> are infrequent in running text. The IANA standard for TSV achieves simplicity by simply disallowing tabs within fields.|$|R
50|$|Commands are {{composed}} of sequences of spaces, <b>tab</b> <b>stops</b> and linefeeds. For example, tab-space-space-space performs arithmetic addition of the top two elements on the stack.Data is represented in binary using spaces (0) and tabs (1), followed by a linefeed; thus, space-space-space-tab-space-tab-tab-linefeed is the binary number 0001011, which is 11 in decimal. All other characters are ignored and thus {{can be used for}} comments.|$|R
50|$|In word {{processing}} and text editing the Tab key will often move the insertion {{point to the}} next <b>tab</b> <b>stop</b> in a table, or may insert the ASCII tab character or many space characters.|$|E
50|$|A <b>tab</b> <b>stop</b> is a {{horizontal}} position {{which is set}} for placing and aligning text on a page. There are at least five kinds of tab stops in general usage in word processing or in MS Word.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike later {{electronic}} organs with conventional <b>tab</b> <b>stops,</b> early Thomas {{electronic organs}} utilized a dial control for their stops, presumably {{to add a}} certain familiarity to its users since the dials worked much like those on a radio or television. This may be evidenced {{by the introduction of}} the Talking Organ with its [...] "Built-In Teacher," [...] a phonograph intended for use with instructional recordings.|$|R
50|$|Layout {{facilities}} included {{setting and}} using <b>tab</b> <b>stops,</b> production of page headers and footers, with automated page numbering; typographical effects including proportional spacing, {{a range of}} font sizes, and bold, italic and underline effects. The cut, copy and paste facility provided 10 paste buffers, each designated by a number, and these could be saved to a disk. The menu system had two layouts, one for beginners {{and the other for}} experienced users.|$|R
50|$|Ruled paper (or lined paper) {{is writing}} paper printed with lines {{as a guide}} for handwriting. The lines often are printed with fine width and in light colour and such paper is {{sometimes}} called feint-ruled paper. Additional vertical lines may provide margins or act as <b>tab</b> <b>stops</b> or create a grid for plotting data, for example graph paper (squared paper or grid paper) where horizontal and vertical lines divide the page into squares.|$|R
5000|$|The term {{can also}} {{refer to the}} control that {{operates}} this mechanism, commonly called a stop <b>tab,</b> <b>stop</b> knob, or drawknob. On electric or electronic organs that imitate a pipe organ, the same terms are often used, {{with the exception of}} the Hammond organ and clonewheel organs, which use the term [...] "drawbar".|$|E
50|$|Modern word {{processors}} generalize this concept by offering tab stops {{that have an}} alignment attribute and cause the text to be automatically aligned at left, at right or center of the <b>tab</b> <b>stop</b> itself. Such tab stops are paragraph-specific properties and can be moved to a different location in any moment, or even removed.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that when}} Whitespace source code is {{displayed}} in some browsers, the horizontal spacing {{produced by a}} Tab character is not fixed, but depends on its location in the text relative to the next horizontal <b>tab</b> <b>stop.</b> Depending on the software, Tab characters may also get replaced by the corresponding variable number of Space characters.|$|E
5000|$|Users {{could control}} {{placement}} of text by means of: margins; indentation; normal tab stops; decimal <b>tab</b> <b>stops,</b> which set {{the position of}} the decimal point rather than the start of a number; and left, right or full justification. Different combinations of these settings, called [...] "layouts", were automatically numbered, which made it possible to re-use layouts and to make changes that applied to all parts of a document where a specified layout was used. These facilities could be used for presenting tables.|$|R
25|$|Characters were {{proportionally}} spaced, {{being from}} 3 to 9 units wide, {{with the size}} of a unit being selectable as either 1/72", 1/84", or 1/96", to allow for different sizes of type (10, 12, or 15 characters per inch). <b>Tab</b> <b>stops</b> could only be positioned at intervals of one-sixth of an inch, or one pica. To support backspacing over previously typed characters, the spacing code for the last 40 or so characters typed was mechanically stored by small sliding plates in a carrier wheel.|$|R
50|$|The {{addition}} of styles and style libraries in WP 5.0 provided greatly increased power and flexibility in formatting documents, {{while maintaining the}} streaming-code architecture of earlier versions. Styles are a preset arrangement of settings {{having to do with}} things like fonts, spacings, <b>tab</b> <b>stops,</b> margins and other items having to do with text layout. Styles can be created by the user to shortcut the setup time when starting a new document, and they can be saved in the program's style library. Prior to that, WordPerfect's only use of styles was the Opening Style, which contained the default settings for a document.|$|R
50|$|The tab {{mechanism}} {{came into}} its own as a rapid and consistent way of uniformly indenting {{the first line of}} each paragraph, often a first <b>tab</b> <b>stop</b> at 5 or 6 characters was used for this, far larger than the indentation used when typesetting. For numeric data, however, the logical place for the <b>tab</b> <b>stop</b> is the location of the least significant digit. Tabbing to this location and then pressing the backspace key to back up to the position of the first digit is practical but slow. Various schemes for numeric tabs were proposed. For example, in 1903, Harry Dukes and William Clayton filed for a patent on a tab mechanism with multiple tab keys numbered 1, 10, 100, etc. Pressing 1 was a simple tab. Pressing 10 advanced to the space before the tab, pressing 100 advanced to the position 2 spaces before the tab.|$|E
50|$|The Blickensderfer 8 {{introduced}} in 1908 {{was the first}} Blick to boast a tabulator system (see <b>Tab</b> <b>stop),</b> even though tabulators had been around for some time. This model was a considerable success and more were sold in 1908 than any other model. This machine was more massive and sturdier looking than the 7 with a two-piece typehead casting and a popular backspace mechanism. The tabulator used large nickel-plated levers placed {{on top of the}} machine, making it easy to operate. Production peaked in 1910 and declined until production ended in 1917. About 20,000 Blick 8's were produced, accounting for about 10% of all Blick models sold.|$|E
50|$|The {{intention}} {{was to have the}} printers be programmed with control characters to set and clear the stops: ISO 6429 includes the codes 136 (Horizontal Tabulation Set), 137 (Horizontal Tabulation with Justification) and 138 (Vertical Tabulation Set). In practice, settable tab stops were rather quickly replaced with fixed tab stops, de facto standardized at every multiple of 8 characters horizontally, and every 6 lines vertically. A printing program could send zero or more tabs to get to the closest <b>tab</b> <b>stop</b> above and left of where it wanted to print, then send line feeds and spaces to get to the final location. Tab characters simply became a form of data compression.|$|E
5000|$|WPS-8 {{supports}} {{a variety of}} 24 row by 80 or 132 column terminals including the VT52 family {{as well as the}} VT100 family and all subsequent ANSI-compatible terminals. A series of hierarchical menus allow the user to command the system; the particular style of these menus became very-widely used by Digital, particularly within their [...] "ALL-IN-1" [...] office system. Once a document is opened for editing, near WYSIWYG editing is provided using a ruler to indicate the text alignment and <b>tab</b> <b>stops</b> for any given portion of the text.
