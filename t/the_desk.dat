50|$|Small or home {{offices are}} the usual habitat of <b>the</b> modern armoire <b>desk.</b> Corporations and {{government}} bureaucracies typically shun <b>the</b> armoire <b>desk,</b> preferring pedestal desks and cubicles in most instances.

50|$|By this {{capacity}} of hiding or revealing the main working area <b>the</b> spinet <b>desk</b> {{could be said}} to be a smaller, less obtrusive cousin of <b>the</b> rolltop <b>desk</b> and <b>the</b> cylinder <b>desk.</b> Like them, and unlike <b>the</b> secretary <b>desk</b> or <b>the</b> fall front <b>desk,</b> it can be closed up without disturbing too much the paperwork and various documents and implements left on the main desktop surface.|$|R
5|$|According to an unquoted {{source in}} The Outlaw Bible of American Literature, on June 3, 1968, at 9:00am, Solanas {{arrived at the}} Chelsea Hotel, where Girodias lived.

5|$|In {{addition}} {{to changes in}} the tone of the show, Noah has also implemented stylistic changes to the show, with an updated set, new graphics and his monologue sometimes taking place while {{standing in front of a}} screen as opposed to sitting at <b>the</b> <b>desk.</b> Trevor also increased the usage of more millennial based references, impersonations & characterisations for his comedy on the show, due to his younger demographic and his ability to speak in multiple accents and eight languages.|$|E
5|$|McNamara's {{popularity}} {{continues to}} this date, as he can currently be seen in local television advertisements in Syracuse, New York, including the ad for Fernandez Automall. On August 16, 2006, The Scranton Red Barons, Triple-A affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies, gave the first 6,000 fans through the gates at PNC Field a Gerry McNamara bobblehead doll. The doll was featured on the Scranton-set television show The Office, placed on <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> {{of the character of}} Dwight Schrute.|$|E
50|$|Like <b>the</b> slant top <b>desk,</b> <b>the</b> main {{work surface}} is a hinged {{piece of wood}} which is flat when open and oblique when raised to enclose {{secondary}} work surfaces such as small shelves, small drawers and nooks stacked {{in front of the}} user. Thus, like <b>the</b> Wooton <b>desk,</b> <b>the</b> fall front <b>desk</b> and others with a hinged desktop, and unlike closable desks with an unmovable desktop like <b>the</b> rolltop <b>desk</b> or <b>the</b> cylinder <b>desk</b> all documents and various items must be removed from the work surface before closing up.|$|R

5|$|Before I {{had become}} {{familiar}} with my surroundings the President sent for me. In the interview that followed he told me what he wanted, and what the failures and his disappointments had been, and proceeded to advise me as to what I should do to accomplish the purpose determined upon {{in the way of}} the new coinage. In this talk he suggested some details of action of a drastic character for my guidance, which he was positive were necessary to be adopted before success could be had. All this was delivered in his usual vigorous way, emphasizing many points by hammering on <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> with his fist.|$|E
5|$|Grin {{announced}} in May 2001 {{that it was}} working on an arcade version of Ballistics for distribution by Triotech. The game's gameplay had to be reworked to suit an arcade environment, and support was added for multiplayer games with up to eight linked cabinets. Triotech designed a unique reclined seating cabinet for the game, {{the aim of the}} design was to offer the player a more comfortable and immersive experience. The inspiration for the design came to Triotech co-founder, Ernest Yale; who whilst putting his feet up on <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> realised how comfortable the playing position was. Ballistics was released for arcades in January 2002.|$|E

Feeling betrayed by Fowley, Mulder leaves, but not before stealthily taking the folder with him.|$|E
5|$|It {{was written}} in the {{afternoon}} in the intervals of some other writing. <b>The</b> <b>desk</b> was in an upstairs room, by a window looking down a wooded hill. It {{was written in}} a little notebook in which his father and mother wrote out copies of several of their poems and, in most cases, added the date of composition. On one page the first two lines of 'Trees' appear, with the date, February 2, 1913, and on another page, further on in the book, is the full text of the poem. It was dedicated to his wife's mother, Mrs. Henry Mills Alden, who was endeared to all her family.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile in Scranton, {{the office}} is left without a {{receptionist}}.

With {{the rest of the}} staff similarly declining to answer the phone, Andy is left with no choice but to take on the receptionist's role himself, and performs the job with unexpected gusto. He orders new magazines for the waiting area, cooks mini-pizzas as reception snacks, color-coordinates <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> and brings in a mail cart to deliver mail. Pam and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) attempt {{to talk him out of}} his newfound enjoyment, believing it to be linked to his lingering feelings for Erin, to no success.|$|E
50|$|Radiating off <b>the</b> dais are <b>desks</b> {{and chairs}} for 64 Senators, {{which was the}} number of Senators at the time the Senate moved to its current quarters. <b>The</b> <b>desks</b> and chairs are located on four semicircular {{graduated}} platforms.

5|$|The {{music video}} starts with multi colored, digital waves which then merge into {{a scene where}} Aguilera is sat in an editing suite {{overlooking}} a sound and edit board. Pressing flashing buttons, multiple large screens {{stand in front of}} <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> and correspond to her choice of button selected. The first images shown on the screens feature Aguilera as Catwoman, a futuristic blue haired character, and a 1960s influenced hippie before focusing on the 60's inspired character. The blond character is shown to be holding an old fashioned handheld video camera filming scenes of high rise buildings, all the while showing shots of Aguilera editing the on screen projection. The blond hippie inspired character is then seen in a second setting, riding a bicycle through a grassy field at times performing dance movements to the song and lip-synching.|$|E
5|$|Aguilera {{then takes}} a touch screen Nokia 5800 XpressMusic phone {{from her pocket}} with {{an image of a}} futuristic blue haired character, after {{producing}} a scene of a convertible car, she inputs the character from the phone onto the screen and into the car and the blue haired character is then shown driving. Aguilera then produces silhouettes of a catwoman style figure, until Aguilera as the catwoman character is shown, wearing a leather catsuit with cat ears, lighting bolts shoot from her hands until another scene featuring the same character shows her alongside a black motorbike holding a gun. Shots of both the blue haired character and catwoman lead to a scene featuring a blond Aguilera moving inside of the screens accompanied by multi-colored digital waves, before shots of the catwoman style character on a motorbike, shooting the gun are presented. Shots of the different scenes including one of Aguilera at <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> accompanied by a toy robot are shown finishing as Aguilera turns the screens off.|$|E
5|$|Oregon's House {{chamber floor}} {{is covered with}} a custom carpet; the carpet's pattern {{incorporates}} a depiction of the state tree, Douglas-fir, representative of forestry. The furniture and paneling of the chamber is made of golden oak. A large mural painted by Faulkner, depicting the 1843 Champoeg Meetings at which the provisional government was formed, is behind <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> of the Speaker of the House. The Senate chambers use black walnut for the paneling and furniture. Another custom carpet lines the floor, featuring Chinook salmon and wheat, representative of fishing and agriculture. The Senate's large mural was painted by Schwarz and depicts a street scene showing news of statehood reaching Salem. Lining the walls of both chambers are 158 names, inscribed in friezes, of prominent people in Oregon's history. On {{the second floor of the}} capitol is the Governor's suite, consisting of a ceremonial office and private offices for the state's chief executive. As in the Senate chamber, the paneling is of black walnut. The ceremonial office includes a fireplace with a painting by Faulkner. In the suite's reception area is a table made of 40 tree species. This table is inlaid with a replica of Oregon's second capitol building, the state flower (Oregon-grape), and the state bird (western meadowlark).|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{credenza}} <b>desk</b> {{is comparable}} in form to but differs from <b>the</b> armoire <b>desk</b> {{in that it}} is seen for the most part in large office buildings (instead of home offices, like <b>the</b> armoire <b>desk)</b> and most of its storage spaces are wide open.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the design}} of a classroom, desk {{arrangements}} are essential to the decor and design of the classroom followed by seating arrangements for the students. Usually classroom desks are arranged in rows or columns, but there are many more ways to arrange <b>the</b> <b>desks,</b> for example making a circle with <b>the</b> <b>desks</b> so that it's more of a group discussion or having <b>the</b> <b>desks</b> in a [...] "U" [...] shape for group discussions and easy access for the teacher. Color is also a big asset to the classroom by realating the colors to the subjects learned in the classroom to help the students learn. Also color helps the atmosphere be fun and exciting and help visual stimulation for the students.|$|R
5|$|Pei {{finally saw}} his {{architecture}} {{come to life}} in 1949, when he designed a two-story corporate building for Gulf Oil in Atlanta, Georgia. The building was demolished in February 2013 although the front facade will be retained {{as part of an}} apartment development. His use of marble for the exterior curtain wall brought praise from the journal Architectural Forum. Pei's designs echoed the work of Mies van der Rohe in the beginning of his career as also shown in his own weekend-house in Katonah in 1952. Soon Pei was so inundated with projects that he asked Zeckendorf for assistants, which he chose from his associates at the GSD, including Henry N. Cobb and Ulrich Franzen. They set to work on a variety of proposals, including the Roosevelt Field Shopping Mall. The team also redesigned the Webb and Knapp office building, transforming Zeckendorf's office into a circular space with teak walls and a glass clerestory. They also installed a control panel into <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> that allowed their boss to control the lighting in his office. The project took one year and exceeded its budget, but Zeckendorf was delighted with the results.|$|E
5|$|Rudy's {{attraction}} to the veterinarian's wife leads to them having consensual sex {{in front of her}} husband. Humiliated, the vet hangs himself in a motel bathroom. Rudy and Fran move on, barely acknowledging the suicide. They check into an El Paso hotel used by criminals as a safe house because Rudy knows that the McCoys will be heading to the same place. When Doc and Carol check in at the hotel, they ask for food to be delivered, but the manager, Laughlin, says he is working alone and cannot leave <b>the</b> <b>desk.</b> Doc soon realizes that Laughlin sent his family away because something is about to happen. He urges Carol to dress quickly so they can escape. An armed Rudy comes to their door while Fran poses as a delivery girl who needs to be paid for the food. Peering from an adjacent doorway, Doc is surprised to see Rudy alive. He sneaks up behind Rudy, knocks him out, and does the same to Fran.|$|E
5|$|The 1891 census {{records the}} Wildes' {{residence}} at 16 Tite Street, {{where he lived}} with his wife Constance and two sons. Wilde though, not content with being better known than ever in London, returned to Paris in October 1891, this time as a respected writer. He was received at the salons littéraires, including the famous mardis of Stéphane Mallarmé, a renowned symbolist poet of the time. Wilde's two plays during the 1880s, Vera; or, The Nihilists and The Duchess of Padua, had not met with much success. He had continued his interest in the theatre and now, after finding his voice in prose, his thoughts turned again to the dramatic form as the biblical iconography of Salome filled his mind. One evening, after discussing depictions of Salome throughout history, he returned to his hotel and noticed a blank copybook lying on <b>the</b> <b>desk,</b> and it occurred to him to write in it what he had been saying. The result was a new play, Salomé, written rapidly and in French.|$|E
