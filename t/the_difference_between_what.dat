5|$|After Urilla's death, Wyatt {{went through}} a {{downward}} spiral and {{had a series of}} legal problems. On March 14, 1871, Barton County filed a lawsuit against Earp and his sureties. Earp was in charge of collecting license fees for Lamar, which funded local schools, and he was accused of failing to turn in the fees. On March 31, James Cromwell filed a lawsuit against Earp, alleging that Earp had falsified court documents about the amount of money collected from Cromwell to satisfy a judgment. To make up <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>what</b> Earp turned in and Cromwell owed (which he claimed to have paid), the court seized Cromwell's mowing machine and sold it for $38. Cromwell's suit claimed that Earp owed him $75, the estimated value of the machine.|$|E

25|$|One economist's {{analysis}} calculates that, despite increased overall spending, Christmas is a {{deadweight loss}} under orthodox microeconomic theory, {{because of the}} effect of gift-giving. This loss is calculated as <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>what</b> the gift giver spent on the item and what the gift receiver would have paid for the item. It is estimated that in 2001, Christmas resulted in a $4 billion deadweight loss in the U.S. alone. Because of complicating factors, this analysis is sometimes used to discuss possible flaws in current microeconomic theory. Other deadweight losses include the effects of Christmas on the environment and the fact that material gifts are often perceived as white elephants, imposing cost for upkeep and storage and contributing to clutter.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have tested}} <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>what</b> {{men and women}} can recall after a presentation. Three {{speakers}} were involved, one being female and two being male. Men and women were put into the same lecture hall and had the same speaker talk to them. The results suggested that information presented by the women speaker was more easily recalled by {{all the members of}} the study. Researchers believe this to be a significant difference between genders because women's voices have better acoustics, ranging from low tones to high tones. Since their voices have this range, semantic encoding is increased for the pitches that stimulate the auditory component of the brain; this resonates better in the ear function. Since pitch ranges from low tones to high tones, it draws people's attention to the words attributed with the tone. As the tone changes, words stand out and from these differences memories can be stored. Recall is made easier since the association the brain can make is between words and sounds spoken.|$|E

500|$|According to Marx, capitalists take {{advantage}} of the difference between the labour market and the market for whatever commodity the capitalist can produce. Marx observed that in practically every successful industry, input unit-costs are lower than output unit-prices. Marx called the difference [...] "surplus value" [...] and argued that this surplus value had its source in surplus labour, <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>what</b> it costs to keep workers alive and what they can produce. Marx's dual view of capitalism can be seen in his description of the capitalists: he refers to them as vampires sucking worker's blood, {{but at the same time}} he notes that drawing profit is [...] "by no means an injustice" [...] and that capitalists simply cannot go against the system. The true problem lies with the [...] "cancerous cell" [...] of capital, understood not as property or equipment, but the relations between workers and owners—the economic system in general.|$|E

Dawkins instead takes issue with the theism present in religions like Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism.

He maintains that the existence or non-existence of God is a scientific fact about the universe, which is discoverable in principle if not in practice.|$|E
2500|$|Most notable in this respect, however, is the American George Antheil.

The score calls for a percussion ensemble consisting of three xylophones, four bass drums, a tam-tam, three airplane propellers, seven electric bells, a siren, two [...] "live pianists", and sixteen synchronized player pianos.

2500|$|Like The Office, Parks and Recreation is filmed with a single-camera setup in a cinéma vérité style {{simulating}} {{the look}} of an actual documentary, with no studio audience or laugh track.

The actors occasionally look at and directly address the cameras, and in some scenes directly engage the cameras in one-on-one interviews with the documentary crew members. The episodes are scripted, but the production encourages the cast to improvise, and dialogue or performances the actors make up during filming often make the final cut of the episodes.
