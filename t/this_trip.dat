The replica was then operated in 1940 at the New York World's Fair, while the original locomotive and rebuilt tender returned to the Smithsonian.|$|E

5|$|After the fight, the Fitzgeralds kept up {{appearances}} {{with their}} friends, seeming happy. In September, Zelda overdosed on sleeping pills. The couple never {{spoke of the}} incident, and refused to discuss {{whether or not it}} was a suicide attempt. Scott returned to writing, finishing The Great Gatsby in October. They attempted to celebrate with travel to Rome and Capri, but both were unhappy and unhealthy. When he received the proofs from his novel he fretted over the title: Trimalchio in West Egg, just Trimalchio or Gatsby, Gold-hatted Gatsby, or The High-bouncing Lover. It was Zelda who preferred The Great Gatsby. It was also on <b>this</b> <b>trip,</b> while ill with colitis, that Zelda began painting.|$|E

5|$|In 1924, Beebe went {{on another}} {{expedition}} to his Guiana research station of Kartabo, {{with the goal}} of continuing the detailed documentation of the tropical ecosystem that he had begun at Kalacoon. The paper which finally resulted from this study was published in Zoologica in 1925, and was the first study {{of its kind in the}} developing field of tropical ecology. Beebe continued to battle depression during <b>this</b> <b>trip</b> to Kartabo, both over his earlier loss of Blair, and over the death of his mother Nettie, who had died shortly before the beginning of the expedition.|$|E
5|$|In December 2001, {{a single}} morning rush-hour round trip branded SLExpress was {{extended}} to Stamford, with a stop at Bridgeport plus eastbound-only stops at Stratford and Milford. An evening eastbound trip was also extended to Stamford with only the Bridgeport intermediate stop. <b>This</b> <b>trip</b> was intended to allow commuters to reach employment centers in Bridgeport and Stamford without having to make a transfer at New Haven. On June 24, 2002, additional Stamford trains were added, {{for a total of}} two westbound and three eastbound trains. When West Haven opened in August 2013, it was added to these trips as well.|$|E

While he was exploring the archipelago, he refined his thoughts about evolution and had his famous insight on natural selection.
