5|$|As the 2000s progressed, the Yankees' {{rivalry with}} the Boston Red Sox {{increased}} in intensity as the sides met multiple {{times in the}} American League Championship Series (ALCS), trading victories in 2003 and 2004. New York regularly reached the postseason, but were often defeated {{in the first two}} rounds. In 2009, the Yankees opened a new Yankee Stadium and won the World Series for the 27th time in team history, an MLB record. The furthest the Yankees have gone in the postseason since <b>then</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> ALCS, in 2010, 2012, and 2017.|$|E
5|$|Frame Analysis: An Essay on the Organization of Experience (1974) is Goffman's {{attempt to}} explain how {{conceptual}} frames – ways to organize experience – structure an individual's perception of society. This book is thus about the organization of experience rather than the organization of society. A frame {{is a set of}} concepts and theoretical perspectives that organize experiences and guide the actions of individuals, groups and societies. Frame analysis, <b>then,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> study of the organization of social experience. To illustrate the concept of the frame, Goffman gives the example of a picture frame: a person uses the frame (which represents structure) to hold together his picture (which represents the content) of what he is experiencing in his life.|$|E
5|$|What <b>then</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{spirit of}} liberty? I cannot define it; I {{can only tell}} you my own faith. The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too sure that it is right; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to {{understand}} the minds of other men and women; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias; the spirit of liberty remembers that not even a sparrow falls to earth unheeded; the spirit of liberty is the spirit of Him who, near two thousand years ago, taught mankind that lesson it has never learned, but has never quite forgotten; {{that there may be a}} kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered side by side with the greatest.|$|E

500|$|According to Ohlin (op. cit., p.222), one cannot say [...] "that {{the rate}} of {{interest}} equalises planned savings and planned investment, for it obviously does not do that. How, <b>then,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> height of the interest rate determined. The answer is that {{the rate of}} interest is simply the price of credit, and that it is therefore governed by the supply of and demand for credit. The banking system – through its ability to give credit – can influence, and to some extent does affect, the interest level." ...|$|E
500|$|Eureka {{presents}} {{themes and}} sentiments similar {{to some of}} those in Poe's fiction work, including attempts at breaking beyond the obstacle of death and specifically characters who return from death in stories like [...] "The Fall of the House of Usher" [...] and [...] "Ligeia". Similar to his theories on a good short story, Poe believes the universe is a self-contained, closed system. In coming to his conclusions, Poe uses ratiocination as a literary device, through his character C. Auguste Dupin, as if Poe himself were a detective solving the mystery of the universe. Eureka, <b>then,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> culmination of Poe's interest in capturing truth through language, an extension of his interest in cryptography.|$|E

500|$|Arriving in Sant'Agata in March 1859 Verdi and Strepponi {{found the}} nearby city of Piacenza {{occupied}} by about 6,000 Austrian troops {{who had made}} it their base, to combat the rise of Italian interest in unification in the Piedmont region. In the ensuing Second Italian War of Independence the Austrians abandoned the region and began to leave Lombardy, although they remained {{in control of the}} Venice region {{under the terms of the}} armistice signed at Villafranca. Verdi was disgusted at this outcome: [...] "here <b>then</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> independence of Italy, so long hoped for and promised?...Venice is not Italian? After so many victories, what an outcome... It is enough to drive one mad" [...] he wrote to Clara Maffei.|$|E
500|$|It {{has also}} been argued that the {{methodology}} used by modern Egyptologists to translate ancient records is unreliable and unstable, and therefore produces flawed and nonsensical translations. Thus, the modern translations of the Joseph Smith Papyri as produced by Egyptologists {{are not to be}} trusted. This line of thinking was used by Nibley in his 1975 book, The Message of the Joseph Smith Papyri. He wrote: [...] "To the often asked question, 'Have the Joseph Smith Papyri been translated?' The answer is an emphatic no! What, <b>then,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> foregoing? A mechanical transcription, no more [...] What we have is a transmission rather than a translation of the text [...] Though as correct and literal as we can make it, the translation in the preceding chapter is not a translation. It is nonsense." ...|$|E
500|$|Potential {{evapotranspiration}} supplements {{the measurement}} of precipitation in providing a scientific measurement-based definition of a desert. The water budget of an area can be calculated using the formula P − PE ± S, wherein P is precipitation, PE is potential evapotranspiration rates and S is amount of surface storage of water. Evapotranspiration is the combination of water loss through atmospheric evaporation and through the life processes of plants. Potential evapotranspiration, <b>then,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> amount of water that could evaporate in any given region. As an example, Tucson, Arizona receives about [...] of rain per year, however about [...] of water could evaporate {{over the course of}} a year. In other words, about eight times more water could evaporate from the region than actually falls as rain. Rates of evapotranspiration in cold regions such as Alaska are much lower because of the lack of heat to aid in the evaporation process.|$|E
