5|$|A {{fusible plug}} is a {{threaded}} metal cylinder usually of bronze, brass or gunmetal, with a <b>tapered</b> <b>hole</b> drilled completely through its length. This hole is sealed {{with a metal}} {{of low melting point}} that flows away if a pre-determined, high temperature is reached. The initial use of the fusible plug was as a safety precaution against low water levels in steam engine boilers, but later applications extended its use to other closed vessels, such as air conditioning systems and tanks for transporting corrosive or liquefied petroleum gasses.|$|E
25|$|The {{tailpiece}} anchors {{the strings}} {{to the lower}} bout of the violin {{by means of the}} tailgut, which loops around an ebony button called the tailpin (sometimes confusingly called the endpin, like the cello's spike), which fits into a <b>tapered</b> <b>hole</b> in the bottom block. Very often the E string will have a fine tuning lever worked by a small screw turned by the fingers. Fine tuners may also be applied to the other strings, especially on a student instrument, and are sometimes built into the tailpiece. The fine tuners enable the performer to make small changes in the pitch of a string. At the scroll end, the strings wind around the wooden tuning pegs in the pegbox. The tuning pegs are tapered and fit into holes in the peg box. The tuning pegs are held in place by the friction of wood on wood. Strings may be made of metal or less commonly gut or gut wrapped in metal. Strings usually have a colored silk wrapping at both ends, for identification of the string (e.g., G string, D string, A string or E string) and to provide friction against the pegs. The tapered pegs allow friction to be increased or decreased by the player applying appropriate pressure along the axis of the peg while turning it.|$|E
2500|$|... "Through-holed and wedged" [...] {{is one of}} {{the primary}} means of joining Windsor chair parts. A {{cylindrical}} or slightly <b>tapered</b> <b>hole</b> is bored in the first piece, the matching cylindrical or tapered end of the second piece is inserted in the hole as a round tenon, and a wedge is driven into the end of this tenon, flaring it tight in the hole. The excess portion of the wedge is then cut flush with the surface. This supplies a mechanical hold that will prevail when the glue fails. In general, early Windsor chair joints are held together mechanically, making glue a redundant detail in their assembly.|$|E

The bearing stud is tapered and threaded, and fits into a <b>tapered</b> <b>hole</b> in the steering knuckle. A protective encasing prevents dirt from getting into the joint assembly. Usually, this is a rubber-like boot that allows movement and expansion of lubricant. Motion-control ball joints tend to be retained with an internal spring, which helps to prevent vibration problems in the linkage.|$|E

The effectiveness of EDM process with Mild Steel is evaluated in terms of the material removal rate, electrode wear rate and angle taper of the workpiece produced.

50|$|There are {{two types}} of cup centers. The {{woodworking}} variety is a variation of the traditional live center. This type of cup center has a central point like a normal live center and also has a ring surrounding it. The ring supports the softer material around the center point and prevents the wood from splitting under pressure from the central point. A different variety of cup center is used for metalworking. The metalworking variety of cup center has a <b>tapered</b> <b>hole</b> rather than a conical point. It supports the part by making contact with the outside diameter {{of the end of the}} part, rather than using a center hole.|$|E

40|$|For the {{dismantling}} of austenitic components of nuclear facilities fastening techniques, usable remote controlled under water, are investigated. The components are only one-sided accessable. The fastening techniques are based on Drawn Arc Stud Welding, Mechanical Drilling followed by mechanical clamping of the fastening elements and thermal drilling with Contact Arc Metal Cutting (CAMC) followed by mechanical clamping of the fastening elements. In thermal drilling process with CAMC hollow electrodes of different materials with internal water scavenging are investigated with regard to wear behaviour and removal rate. The graphite type EG 88 shows the longest electrode life, tested in plates of thickness from 20 mm up to 65 mm and using dielectric fluid both drinking water and deionized water. 14 holes were drilled in a plate of a thickness of 30 mm (adequate to 420 mm) without electrode-changing, in this time the wear on the length 16, 9 mm. Minor <b>tapered</b> <b>holes</b> and rough interior surfaces of the pearcing holes are the results. Fastening elements plug and blind rivet, which are customary in trade, have been investigated. The latter guarantees the necessary mould clamp. The selected blind rivet is usable for plate-thicknesses from 6 mm up to 42 mm. In tensile test the rivet pin breaks from 78 kN upwards. The rivet case is formed in minor <b>tapered</b> <b>holes</b> {{in the same way}} as in rough interior surfaces of holes. Drill bur does not influence the results.

50|$|The {{main spindle}} is {{generally}} hollow to allow long bars to extend {{through to the}} work area. This reduces preparation and waste of material. The spindle runs in precision bearings and is fitted with some means of attaching workholding devices such as chucks or faceplates. This end of the spindle usually also has an included taper, frequently a Morse taper, to allow the insertion of hollow tubular (Morse standard) tapers {{to reduce the size}} of the <b>tapered</b> <b>hole,</b> and permit use of centers. On older machines ('50s) the spindle was directly driven by a flat belt pulley with lower speeds available by manipulating the bull gear.

50|$|Friction {{stud welding}} {{has been used}} to {{retrofit}} sacrificial anodes to subsea pipelines while the pipeline is “live” (that is, it continues to transport hydrocarbons at pressure). In some cases the anodes are placed on the sea bed next to the pipeline and a lug on a cable from the anode is connected to the stud welded on the pipeline. Another option is a tripartite weld where the lug on the anode cable is made of steel with a <b>tapered</b> <b>hole</b> in it. The tapered end of the stud welds through the hole onto the pipeline, welding to both the lug and the pipe and providing a fully welded connection between the anode cable and pipeline. The advantage of this method {{is that there is no}} significant increase in the electrical resistance of the connection due to corrosion during the lifetime of the pipeline. Many subsea pipelines have concrete weight coating on them and a small area of this can be removed with a water jet to permit welding.|$|E
40|$|Thermoacoustic {{engines are}} an {{interesting}} alternative to conventional heat engines (such as Stirling engines) due {{to the absence of}} moving parts in the hot region and the small temperature difference required to operate. These engines can provide a durable solution in, for example, waste heat recovery applications. Using a traveling wave based configuration, consisting of a toroidal geometry, thermal-to-acoustic efficiencies of up to 30 % have been obtained. However, the traveling wave configuration has a major disadvantage: due to the closed looped geometry a time-averaged mass flow, known as "Gedeon streaming", can occur. This type of acoustic streaming can lead to a drastic reduction in efficiency or even prevent the engine from running. Therefore, control of Gedeon streaming is essential in the development of traveling wave thermoacoustic engines. A solution to avoid Gedeon streaming is the application of a jet pump, which is a component with one or more <b>tapered</b> <b>holes.</b> The oscillatory flow through such an asymmetric geometry results in a time-averaged pressure drop across the jet pump. By balancing this time-averaged pressure drop with the pressure drop that exists across the regenerator of the thermoacoustic device, Gedeon streaming can be suppressed. In this thesis, the oscillatory flow in jet pumps is analyzed. The relation between oscillatory flow features and the performance of jet pumps is investigated. Based on this, jet pump design guidelines have been formulated for laminar oscillatory flows. Flow separation is identified as a main source of performance loss in jet pumps and can be avoided by introducing a smooth transition to the tapered inner surface. Compact jet pump designs can be realized by using multiple smaller <b>tapered</b> <b>holes,</b> but this is accompanied by a slight reduction in performance due to the smaller diameter of the individual holes. Identifying and understanding the flow phenomena in jet pumps is shown to be the key to more reliable design calculations for jet pumps in thermoacoustic applications...|$|R

Also, cutting force and the required energy were calculated and compared. To verify the results of analysis, a cutting dynamometer was used to analyze 3 -axis cutting force. Results of analysis showed that the specimen maintained a temperature of approximately 650 °, with rapid cooling after chips were formed from the specimen.

50|$|In {{the last}} few years of wooden boat construction, glue and screws took over, but until the 1950s, the keel, hog, stem, apron, deadwoods, sternpost, and perhaps transom would be {{fastened}} together by bolts set in white lead and grease. There are three kinds of bolt, of which, nowadays, the screw bolt, with its nut and washer, {{is by far the most}} common. The second type of bolt is the pin bolt or cotter bolt, which, instead of a thread, has a <b>tapered</b> <b>hole</b> forged through the end away from the head, into which a tapered pin or cotter is knocked. The taper is in effect a straight thread. In conjunction with a washer, this draws the bolt tight, as a nut does on a screw bolt. The third type of bolt is the clench bolt. It has some of the features of a rivet but was usually much longer than the normal rivet; in a wooden ship, perhaps a metre or more. For a shipwright's use, it is of copper. A head is formed by upsetting one end using a swage. It is then knocked through a hole bored through the work to be fastened, and through a washer. The head is held up with a dolly and the other end is upset over the washer in the same way as the head. Until well into the nineteenth century, this is what held the great ships of the world together, though some may have used iron. Until the late 1950s, the centre-line assembly of British Admiralty twenty-five foot motor cutters were fastened this way.|$|E
