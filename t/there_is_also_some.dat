5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>some</b> major piracy in Nigeria, with attacks {{directed}} at {{all types of}} vessels. Consistent {{with the rise of}} Nigeria as an increasingly dangerous hot spot, 28 of the 30 seafarers kidnapped as of January–June 2013 were in Nigeria. Additionally, the single death to date in 2013 occurred in Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{development}} within the main canyon, although the El Toro Creek area is primarily residential. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>some</b> {{residential and commercial}} development downstream of State Route 73. The concrete channel {{in this area is}} small and undersized for major floods, which caused it to overflow in the late 1990s and again in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Biblical Hebrew is best-attested in the Hebrew Bible, the {{collection}} of Judaic religious and historical texts which reflect various stages of the Hebrew language in its consonantal skeleton, {{as well as a}} vocalic system which was added in the Middle Ages by the Masoretes. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>some</b> evidence of regional dialectal variation, including differences between Biblical Hebrew as spoken in the northern Kingdom of Israel and in the southern Kingdom of Judah.|$|E

5|$|Outer {{space is}} sparsely filled with several dozen types of organic {{molecules}} discovered to date by microwave spectroscopy, blackbody radiation {{left over from}} the big bang and the origin of the universe, and cosmic rays, which include ionized atomic nuclei and various subatomic particles. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>some</b> gas, plasma and dust, and small meteors. Additionally, there are signs of human life in outer space today, such as material left over from previous manned and unmanned launches which are a potential hazard to spacecraft. Some of this debris re-enters the atmosphere periodically.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} predators of greater noctule bat are barn owl (Tyto alba) and Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo). The greater noctule bat {{generally}} leaves its roost to forage {{after it is}} already completely dark outside, this coincides with the general time that the two mentioned owl species hunt. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>some</b> risk to the greater noctule from parasitism between bats.|$|E
5|$|The {{topography}} of the watershed of Spring Brook is mainly mountainous, with swampy land in its upper reaches. Some bogs are {{also present in}} this area. Wetlands near the stream's headwaters include the Yostville marshes. In the stream's middle and lower reaches, its valley is flanked by steep, high mountains. Its channel is sinuous and flows through rock formations consisting of sandstone and shale. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>some</b> coal in the lower reaches of the watershed. There are some culm dumps along the stream between Pennsylvania Route 502 and US Route 11.|$|E

5|$|Besides {{being criticized}} for its limited powers, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>some</b> {{concern that the}} Council's {{responsibilities}} may go too far. By taking up the function of scrutinizing existing and prospective legislation for differentiating measures and inconsistencies with fundamental liberties, the Council may be encroaching on the functions of constitutional interpretation, which is traditionally the function of courts. Even though the Council has the additional advantage of identifying potentially unconstitutional legislation at an early stage, thereby preventing unnecessary litigation in the future, there is doubt as {{to the ability of}} the Council to take on such a task. Given that constitutional interpretation is traditionally the function of lawyers and the courts, the task may be best carried out by the legally trained members of the PCMR.|$|E
5|$|In September 1917, Allingham, by then an Air Mechanic First Class, {{was posted}} to the Western Front to join No. 12 Squadron RNAS. This unit {{acted as a}} {{training}} squadron for other RNAS squadrons based on the Western Front. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>some</b> evidence that the squadron was involved in combat operations. When Allingham arrived at Petite-Synthe, both the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and the RNAS {{were involved in the}} Ypres offensive. Allingham also instrumented the very first reconnaissance aircraft camera during the First World War. On 3 November 1917, he was posted to the aircraft depot at Dunkirk, France where he remained {{for the rest of the}} war, on aircraft repair and recovery duties. He recalls being bombed from the air and shelled from both the land and the sea.|$|E
5|$|In the Neolithic period, {{from around}} 6,000 years ago, there is {{evidence}} of permanent settlements and farming. This includes the well-preserved stone house at Knap of Howar on Papa Westray, dating from around 3500 BCE and the village of similar houses at Skara Brae on West Mainland, Orkney from about 500 years later. Evidence of prehistoric farming includes small plots of improved land, with simple stone boundaries. On Shetland these have been found under peat and on the mainland they are associated with cairnfields (piles of rocks that have been cleared from fields). Archaeological evidence of pollen, pottery, settlements and human remains indicates that the two main sources of food were grain and cow milk, in a pattern that probably remained constant until the High Middle Ages. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>some</b> limited evidence of the cultivation of flax from this period.|$|E

25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>some</b> {{evidence}} for competition between EcM fungi and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. This is mostly noted in species, such as certain eucalypts, that {{are capable of}} hosting both EcM and AM fungi on their roots. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>some</b> evidence in larger scale systems, such as pinyon woodlands, although it is hard to extricate effects of mycorrhizal interactions (if there are any) from those of simple resource competition.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>some</b> {{evidence}} that Sam Zemurray {{put pressure on}} several banana republics to change their votes.|$|E

25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>some</b> dune habitat near West Sandwick, {{something}} pretty {{rare in the}} Shetland Islands; controversially, {{there has}} been some commercial extraction of the sand from this area, which may have had a significant environmental impact.|$|E
