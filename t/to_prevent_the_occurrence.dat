A good example is the plural -s, which is always preceded by a vowel <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> <b>occurrence</b> of a hard-to-pronounce consonant cluster at the end.

500|$|With {{the money}} he made from the sales of the Walkers and a loan from his cousin, banker Elisha Colt, Colt bought the {{machinery}} and tooling from Blake to build his own factory: Colt's Patent Fire-Arms Manufacturing Company factory at Hartford. The first revolving-breech pistols made at the factory were called [...] "Whitneyville-Hartford-Dragoons" [...] and became so popular that the word [...] "Colt" [...] was often used as a generic term for the revolver. The Whitneyville-Hartford Dragoon, largely built from leftover Walker parts, {{is known as the}} first model in the transition from the Walker to the Dragoon series. Beginning in 1848, more contracts followed for what is today known as the Colt Dragoon Revolvers. These models were based on the Walker Colt, and in three generations slight changes to each model showed the rapid evolution of the design. The improvements were [...] barrels for accuracy, shorter chambers and an improved loading lever. The shorter chambers were loaded to 50 grains of powder, instead of 60 grains in the earlier Walkers, <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> <b>occurrence</b> of ruptured cylinders.

40|$|Type {{theory is}} {{fundamental}} both in logic and computer science. In computer science, type theory {{refers to the}} design, analysis and study of type systems. Generally, a type system is used <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> <b>occurrences</b> of errors during {{the evolution of a}} system. A type inference procedure determines the minimal requirements to accept a system or a component as well-typed. Membrane systems consider cells as mechanisms working in a maximal par-allel and non-deterministic manner. However, the living cells do not work in such a way: a chemical reaction takes place only if certain quantitative con-straints are fulfilled. In order to cope with such constraints, membrane systems should be enriched by adding a quantitative type discipline, and making use of type inference and principal typing [2]. We associate to each reduction rule a minimal set of constraints that must be satisfied in order to assure that by the application of this rule to a well-formed membrane system, we get a well-formed membrane system as well. A first step in this direction was done in [1] where a type system for membrane system with symport/antiport rules is given...|$|R
40|$|Observer based {{approaches}} are commonly embedded in sensorless {{variable speed drives}} {{for the purpose of}} speed control. It estimates system variables to produce errors or residual signals in conjunction with corresponding measurements. The residual signals then are relied to tune control parameters to maintain operational performance even if there are considerable disturbances such as noises and component faults. Obviously, this control strategy outcomes robust control performances. However, it may produce adverse consequences to the system when faults progress to high severity. <b>To</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> <b>occurrences</b> of such consequences, this research proposes the utilisation of residual signals as detection features to raise alerts for incipient faults. Based on a gear transmission system with a sensorless variable speed drive (VSD), observers for speed, flux and torque are developed for examining their residuals under two mechanical faults: tooth breakage with different degrees of severities and shortage of lubricant at different levels are investigated. It shows that power residual signals can be based on to indicate different faults, showing that the observer based {{approaches are}} effective for monitoring VSD based mechanical systems. Moreover, it also shows that these two types fault can be separated based on the dynamic components in the voltage signals...|$|R
60|$|In {{the year}} 1702 fencing {{was far from}} having {{attained}} that perfection which it reached later. Masks {{had not yet been}} invented, and in consequence play was necessarily stiff and slow, as the danger of the loss of sight, or even of death, from a chance thrust was very great. When Rupert first began his lessons, he was so rash and hasty that his grandfather greatly feared an accident, and it struck him that by having visors affixed to a couple of light steel caps, not only would all possibility of an accident be obviated upon the part of either himself or his pupil, but the latter would attain a freedom and confidence of style which could otherwise be only gained from a long practice in actual war. The result had more than equalled his expectations; and Monsieur Dessin had, when he assumed the post of instructor, been delighted with the invention, and astonished at the freedom and boldness of the lad's play. It was, then, thanks to these masks, as well as to his teachers' skill and his own aptitude, that Rupert had obtained a certainty, a rapidity, and a freedom of style absolutely impossible {{in the case of a}} person, whatever his age, who had been accustomed to fence with the face unguarded, and with the caution and stiffness necessary <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> <b>occurrence</b> of terrible accident.|$|E
60|$|If we admit, however reluctantly, that a {{criminal}} law {{is necessary and}} that {{the force of the}} community must be brought to bear to prevent certain kinds of actions, a further question arises: How is crime to be treated? What is the greatest measure of humanity and respect for freedom that is compatible with the recognition of such a thing as crime? The first thing to recognize is that the whole conception of guilt or sin should be utterly swept away. At present, the criminal is visited with the displeasure of the community: the sole method applied <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> <b>occurrence</b> of crime is the infliction of pain upon the criminal. Everything possible is done to break his spirit and destroy his self-respect. Even those pleasures which would be most likely to have a civilizing effect are forbidden to him, merely on the ground that they are pleasures, while much of the suffering inflicted is of a kind which can only brutalize and degrade still further. I am not speaking, of course, of those few penal institutions which have made a serious study of reforming the criminal. Such institutions, especially in America, have been proved capable of achieving the most remarkable results, but they remain everywhere exceptional. The broad rule is still that the criminal is made to feel the displeasure of society. He must emerge from such a treatment either defiant and hostile, or submissive and cringing, with a broken spirit and a loss of self-respect. Neither of these results is anything but evil. Nor can any good result be achieved by a method of treatment which embodies reprobation.|$|E
60|$|But {{it was the}} {{introduction}} and general employment of lightning-rods that dealt a final deathblow to the thunderbolt theory. A lightning-conductor consists essentially of a long piece of metal, pointed at the end whose business it is, not so much (as most people imagine) to carry off the flash of lightning harmlessly, should it happen to strike the house to which the conductor is attached, but rather <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> <b>the</b> <b>occurrence</b> of a flash at all, by gradually and gently drawing off the electricity {{as fast as it}} gathers before it has had time to collect in sufficient force for a destructive discharge. It resembles in effect an overflow pipe which drains off the surplus water of a pond as soon as it runs in, in such a manner as to prevent the possibility of an inundation, which might occur if the water were allowed to collect in force behind a dam or embankment. It is a flood-gate, not a moat: it carries away the electricity of the air quietly to the ground, without allowing it to gather in sufficient amount to produce a flash of lightning. It might thus be better called a lightning-preventer than a lightning-conductor: it conducts electricity, but it prevents lightning. At first, all lightning-rods used to be made with knobs on the top, and then the electricity used to collect at the surface until the electric force was sufficient to cause a spark. In those happy days, you had the pleasure of seeing that the lightning was actually being drawn off from your neighbourhood piecemeal. Knobs, it was held, must be the best things, because you could incontestably see the sparks striking them with your own eyes. But as time went on, electricians discovered that if you fixed a fine metal point to the conductor of an electric machine it was impossible to get up any appreciable charge because the electricity kept always leaking out by means of the point. Then it was seen that if you made your lightning-rods pointed at the end, you would be able in the same way to dissipate your electricity before it ever had time to come to a head in the shape of lightning. From that moment the thunderbolt was safely dead and buried. It was urged, indeed, that the attempt thus to rob Heaven of its thunders was wicked and impious; but the common-sense of mankind refused to believe that absolute omnipotence could be sensibly defied by twenty yards of cylindrical iron tubing. Thenceforth the thunderbolt ceased to exist, save in poetry, country houses, and the most rural circles; even the electric fluid was generally relegated to the provincial press, where it still keeps company harmoniously with caloric, the devouring element, nature's abhorrence of a vacuum, and many other like philosophical fossils: while lightning itself, shorn of its former glories, could no longer wage impious war against cathedral towers, but was compelled to restrict itself to blasting a solitary rider now and again in the open fields, or drilling more holes in the already crumbling summit of Mount Ararat. Yet it will be a thousand years more, in all probability, before the last thunderbolt ceases to be shown as a curiosity here and there to marvelling visitors, and takes its proper place in some village museum as a belemnite, a meteoric stone, or a polished axe-head of our neolithic ancestors. Even then, no doubt, the original bolt will still survive as a recognised property in the stock-in-trade of every well-equipped poet.|$|E
