5|$|Adomnán in his Life of Saint Columba {{offers a}} longer account, which Abbot Ségéne {{had heard from}} Oswald himself.

This coming night go out from your camp into battle, for the Lord has granted me that at this time your foes shall be put <b>to</b> <b>flight</b> and Cadwallon your enemy shall be {{delivered}} into your hands and you shall return victorious after battle and reign happily. Oswald described his vision to his council and all agreed that they would be baptised and accept Christianity after the battle. In the battle that followed, the British were routed despite their superior numbers; Cadwallon himself was killed.|$|E

The school's commander, Frederick Scherger, advised Cresswell to grow a moustache to overcome his youthful appearance. He was promoted <b>to</b> <b>flight</b> lieutenant in January 1941. Following the bombing of Darwin by Japanese forces on 19February 1942, Cresswell was posted to Williamtown as a liaison officer with the 9th Squadron of the US 49th Pursuit Group (later the 49th Fighter Group), which operated P-40 Kittyhawks and would shortly transfer to Darwin to provide air defence for the North-Western Area.|$|E

5|$|After {{leaving the}} military, Phillipps became a grazier in New South Wales.

No.2 EFTS was one of twelve basic flying schools established by the RAAF as part of Australia's contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme.

5|$|Although Æthelred {{had been}} Eardwulf's enemy, Æthelred's killers {{proved to be}} equally hostile to Eardwulf.

Wada was put <b>to</b> <b>flight</b> and may have gone into exile in Mercia. He may have hoped to restore Osbald to the throne. The {{evidence}} for Osbald's continued ambition is a letter that Alcuin wrote to him, probably in 798, in which Alcuin attempted to dissuade Osbald from further interventions in Northumbrian affairs. Alcuin's arguments appear to have succeeded, since Osbald is known to have become an abbot by 799 (when his death is recorded), implying that he had given up his ambitions.|$|E
