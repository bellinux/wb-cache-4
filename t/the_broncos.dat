5|$|After Round 18 of the competition, {{during a}} {{training}} session on 20 July 2007, Hunt injured his hamstring and was originally scheduled to miss six weeks. However, his recovery took longer than expected, {{and he was}} eventually ruled out {{for the rest of}} the season. Despite playing only thirteen games for <b>the</b> <b>Broncos</b> in 2007, he received <b>the</b> <b>Broncos</b> award for Best Back.|$|E
5|$|After much speculation, Manning {{announced}} in the offseason that he would return for his 18th season in the NFL. In the season opener against the Baltimore Ravens, Manning's play seemed to have deteriorated, going 24–40 for 175 yards and one interception, but a pick-6 by cornerback Aqib Talib allowed <b>the</b> <b>Broncos</b> to win 19–13. <b>The</b> <b>Broncos</b> {{got off to a}} dominant 7–0 start to the season; however, the streak ended in a loss at Indianapolis, losing 24–27. During that winning streak, and the loss in Indianapolis, Manning played better, putting up over 250 yards in six of the seven games, and he scored nine touchdowns. However, he never had a game without an interception, bringing his 8-game TD–INT ratio to 9–13, and <b>the</b> <b>Broncos</b> needed a hardworking defense to contribute for victories.|$|E
5|$|Handley was {{replaced}} by former Denver Broncos head coach Dan Reeves, who led <b>the</b> <b>Broncos</b> to three Super Bowls in four years, one against the Giants. After his dismissal from <b>the</b> <b>Broncos,</b> Reeves took {{the unusual step of}} lobbying for the job. After being rebuffed by a number of candidates, George Young was pleased that someone with Reeves's credentials wanted the job.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> Ford <b>Bronco</b> II is a two-door compact-sized {{sport utility}} vehicle (SUV) that was {{manufactured}} by Ford from 1983 to 1990. <b>The</b> original <b>Bronco</b> was based on its own chassis, <b>the</b> <b>Bronco</b> II used a shortened Ford Ranger platform, allowing for mechanical and structural commonality. Following the shift of <b>the</b> <b>Bronco</b> to <b>the</b> full-sized F-Series truck platform in 1978, <b>the</b> <b>Bronco</b> II was marketed as a compact SUV.|$|R
50|$|In 1983, <b>the</b> Ford <b>Bronco</b> II {{made its}} debut; {{unrelated}} to <b>the</b> full-size <b>Bronco,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bronco</b> II was a compact SUV {{based on a}} shortened Ranger pickup truck and sized similarly to <b>the</b> 1966-1977 <b>Bronco.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bronco</b> {{was usually}} {{produced}} with a rosewood fingerboard and standard fiesta Red finish,but {{later in the}} series fender introduced black finish. <b>The</b> <b>Bronco,</b> like <b>the</b> Musicmaster and the Mustang, was discontinued in 1981 and replaced by the Fender Lead Series. The last colours available were Dakota Red, Black, Olympic White and Midnight Wine. Unlike its older and more popular cousin, the Mustang, [...] it has not seen a re-issue, {{with the result that}} <b>the</b> <b>Bronco</b> trem is <b>the</b> only one of Fender's four tremolo arm designs not in current production. <b>The</b> <b>Bronco</b> name is continued only in <b>the</b> Squier-branded <b>Bronco</b> Bass.|$|R
5|$|Hunt's skill on {{the field}} and {{positive}} influence on other team members led to his emergence, early in 2007, as a future candidate for <b>the</b> <b>Broncos</b> captaincy. Broncos chief executive Bruno Cullen stated that such a move would have his and <b>the</b> <b>Broncos</b> management's full support. Current captain Lockyer also gave his support to Hunt being the next captain, saying that he has the respect of fellow players and the necessary leadership qualities.|$|E
5|$|In Round 11, <b>the</b> <b>Broncos</b> {{had their}} biggest victory yet, winning 71–6 over Newcastle. In that game Hunt set up three tries and scored one himself. The Brisbane {{newspaper}} The Sunday Mail described Hunt as not performing consistently throughout the 2007 season for <b>the</b> <b>Broncos.</b> However, Hunt played an exceptionally good game in Round 15 against the Wests Tigers, scoring three tries, assisting in a try and gaining 281 metres in the Broncos' win.|$|E
5|$|Nash {{was awarded}} a {{scholarship}} by Santa Clara for the 1992–93 season. At that time, it had been five years since <b>the</b> <b>Broncos</b> appeared in the NCAA tournament. That changed when Nash led <b>the</b> <b>Broncos</b> to a WCC Tournament title and an upset win over the No. 2 seeded Arizona {{in the first round}} of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. In that game, Nash scored six straight free throws in the last 30 seconds of the contest. Although Santa Clara was defeated by Temple in the next round, the 1992–93 campaign was considered a successful one. However, <b>the</b> <b>Broncos</b> failed to sustain the momentum the following season, and only managed a 5–7 record in the conference. The team rebounded in the 1994–95 season, with Nash being named Conference Player of the Year and <b>the</b> <b>Broncos</b> topping the WCC. Featuring the league leader for scoring and assists in Nash, <b>the</b> <b>Broncos</b> returned to the NCAA tournament, but they were defeated by Mississippi State. After the season, Nash contemplated turning professional, and decided against it when he learned that he would probably not be considered as a first-round pick in the 1995 NBA draft.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bronco</b> II was {{assembled}} in the Louisville Assembly Plant in Louisville, Kentucky, alongside the Ford Ranger. In 1990, <b>the</b> <b>Bronco</b> II {{was replaced by the}} Ford Explorer; while still based on the Ranger, the Explorer was enlarged into the mid-size SUV segment. Following the discontinuation of <b>the</b> <b>Bronco</b> II, <b>the</b> next compact SUV produced by Ford in North America was the 2001 Ford Escape.|$|R
50|$|The {{idea behind}} <b>the</b> <b>Bronco</b> began with Ford product manager Donald N. Frey, who also {{conceived}} the Ford Mustang; Lee Iacocca pushed the idea through to production. In many ways, <b>the</b> <b>Bronco</b> {{was a more}} original concept than the Mustang; whereas the Mustang was based upon the Ford Falcon, <b>the</b> <b>Bronco</b> had a frame, suspension, and body that were not shared with any other vehicle.|$|R
5|$|On March 11, 2016, Sanchez {{was traded}} to the Denver Broncos for a 2017 {{conditional}} draft pick. Prior to his arrival to <b>the</b> <b>Broncos,</b> Peyton Manning had retired and Brock Osweiler had signed with the Houston Texans. This opened up a competition for <b>the</b> <b>Broncos</b> starting quarterback job between Sanchez, second-year player Trevor Siemian and rookie Paxton Lynch. On August 29, Broncos head coach Gary Kubiak named Siemian the starting quarterback for the 2016 season. On September 3, 2016, Sanchez was released by the team.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Broncos</b> {{made the}} playoffs, but lost 38–35 in double {{overtime}} to Baltimore, {{who went on}} to win Super Bowl XLVII that season.|$|E
5|$|The Denver Broncos signed Quinn as an {{unrestricted}} free agent in March 2004. At {{the end of}} training camp, Quinn was released by <b>the</b> <b>Broncos.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{original}} <b>Bronco</b> was an {{off-road vehicle}} (ORV) intended to compete primarily with Jeep CJ models and the International Harvester Scout. <b>The</b> <b>Bronco's</b> small size, riding on a 92 in wheelbase, made it maneuverable for some uses, but impractical as a tow vehicle. <b>The</b> <b>Bronco</b> was Ford's first compact SUV.|$|R
5000|$|In 1983, <b>the</b> <b>Bronco</b> saw {{a slight}} {{facelift}} as it adopted Ford's blue oval emblem, taking {{the place of}} [...] "F-O-R-D" [...] lettering on the hood, and <b>the</b> <b>bronco</b> horse {{was removed from the}} fender emblems.|$|R

5|$|Denver {{is home to}} {{a variety}} of sports teams {{and is one of the}} U.S. cities with teams from four major sports (the Denver metro area is the {{smallest}} metropolitan area to have a team in all four major sports). The Denver Broncos of the National Football League have drawn crowds of over 70,000 since their origins in the early 1960s, and continue to draw fans today to their current home Sports Authority Field at Mile High. <b>The</b> <b>Broncos</b> have sold out every home game (except for strike-replacement games) since 1970. <b>The</b> <b>Broncos</b> have advanced to eight Super Bowls and won back-to-back titles in 1997 and 1998, and won again in 2015.|$|E

5000|$|Following the {{introduction}} of the ninth-generation Ford F-150, <b>the</b> <b>Bronco</b> saw a major design update for the 1992 model year. Again based on the same basic F-Series chassis introduced in 1980, <b>the</b> <b>Bronco</b> again saw updates to the exterior and interior.|$|R

Especially after being publicly rebuffed by a number of candidates, George Young was pleased that someone with Reeves's credentials wanted the job, and Reeves was hired as Giants head coach. He had been a finalist along with Perkins for the team's head coaching position in 1979, but Young went with Perkins at the time because he felt he knew him better from their days together with the Baltimore Colts.|$|E
5|$|Hunt {{sustained}} a foot injury in <b>the</b> <b>Broncos</b> Round 15 match and was sidelined for eight weeks. While out injured, {{early in the}} morning on 30 July 2006, Hunt was at the scene of a fight outside a Brisbane night club in Brisbane's CBD. The media, notably Channel 7 and Channel 10, alleged Hunt was the instigator of the incident, claiming he squirted water on a woman. <b>The</b> <b>Broncos</b> denied he had any involvement in the incident although a woman gave his name to police. Hunt also denied involvement, insisting he was merely a bystander.|$|E
5|$|On January 7, 2013, the Denver Broncos signed Boren to a futures contract. On August 7, 2013, Boren was waived/injured by <b>the</b> <b>Broncos.</b> On August 8, 2013, {{he cleared}} waivers and {{was placed on}} the Broncos' injured reserve list.|$|E

50|$|Following the {{transformation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Bronco</b> into a full-size SUV for the 1978 model year, Ford product planners sought to create a replacement for the popular 1966 to 1977 generation. Using a shortened Ranger four-wheel drive chassis, <b>the</b> 1983 <b>Bronco</b> II was only slightly longer and wider than the 1966 generation. In sharp contrast to its spartan predecessor, <b>the</b> <b>Bronco</b> II offered all of the convenience features available on any Ranger. Unlike its larger namesake, <b>the</b> <b>Bronco</b> II was not designed with a removable top; it was distinguished with large side windows which extended into the rear roofline.|$|R

5|$|Since Oklahoma won the Big12 Championship game, they {{represented}} the Big12 Conference in the Fiesta Bowl in Glendale, Arizona. Contractually, the Fiesta Bowl hosts the Big12 Champion and then picks, {{from among the}} BCS eligible teams, the opponent. For 2007, the Fiesta Bowl picked Boise State as Oklahoma's opponent. The game took place on New Year's Day in the then-new University of Phoenix Stadium, home of the Arizona Cardinals. <b>The</b> <b>Broncos</b> led the Sooners {{the majority of the}} game, but the Sooners made up an 18point deficit late in the game and led by a touchdown with a minute left in regulation. With 18seconds left, the Sooners had <b>the</b> <b>Broncos</b> in a fourth-and-18 situation from midfield, but were stunned when <b>the</b> <b>Broncos</b> executed a hook and lateral for the tying score. This would be only the first of three Boise State trick plays that helped elevate this game to epic status.|$|E
5|$|The Falcons lost Super Bowl XXXIII by a {{score of}} 34–19, which earned <b>the</b> <b>Broncos</b> their second {{consecutive}} Super Bowl victory. The game was anticipated as a match up between the Vikings and <b>the</b> <b>Broncos,</b> and the Falcons' presence in the game was noted as an anticlimax. The night before the game, safety Eugene Robinson was arrested for soliciting a prostitute. Although Robinson played in the game, the distraction contributed to a poor performance by the Falcons team, who managed only six points in six drives deep into Denver territory and surrendered a season-high point total.|$|E
5|$|The Sooners had {{the ball}} first in overtime, with Adrian Peterson scoring on their first play. Boise State then drove the ball toward the goal line, but faced fourth-and-two from the five yard line. They then sent quarterback Jared Zabransky into motion and snapped to backup wide {{receiver}} Vinny Peretta, who ran an option pass and found Derek Schouman in the end zone. <b>The</b> <b>Broncos</b> chose {{to go for the}} two-point conversion and the win instead of kicking for the tie. They then ran a Statue of Liberty play, with Zabransky faking a pass to the right side and handing the ball behind his back to Ian Johnson, who ran left and entered the end zone untouched, giving <b>the</b> <b>Broncos</b> a stunning 4342 win.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> 1978-1979 <b>Bronco</b> {{is based}} on the Ford F-100 pickup truck (1973-1979 sixth generation). Alongside the {{shortened}} wheelbase (104 in), the major difference between <b>the</b> <b>Bronco</b> and F-100 is the standard four-wheel-drive powertrain. This generation of <b>the</b> <b>Bronco</b> is fitted with part-time four-wheel drive and a New Process 205 gear-driven transfer case with the option of permanent four-wheel drive and a New Process 203 chain-driven transfer case.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Fender <b>Bronco</b> was {{a guitar}} {{amplifier}} made by Fender. It {{was the first}} silverfaced amplifier introduced in 1967 to sport the modern-looking [...] "tailless" [...] Fender amp decal, which became a standard feature on other Fender amplifiers in the early 1970s. <b>The</b> <b>Bronco</b> was a student amp to go with <b>the</b> matching <b>Bronco</b> guitar. Bronco amplifiers were shipped {{as a part of}} <b>the</b> <b>Bronco</b> [...] "student" [...] package offered during that time, which also included <b>the</b> matching <b>Bronco</b> guitar, introduced that same year. Some early <b>Broncos</b> used <b>the</b> early-mid 1960s [...] "tailed" [...] amp logo. The schematics and manuals listed <b>the</b> <b>Bronco</b> and <b>the</b> Vibro Champ as the same amp, except for the red letters and labels stamped on the control faceplate (Vibro Champs have blue labels and lettering {{like the rest of the}} silverface amplification). The controls were also the same. It was discontinued in 1975.|$|R
