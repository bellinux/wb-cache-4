5|$|Cole faced a {{challenging}} {{time in the}} lead-up to Rio Paralympics. She reflects “I was still questioning if I was worthy to be there heading in – and I knew that I was, but it’s amazing <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>after</b> the amount of psychological sports training that I’ve had, those thoughts still {{come in and take}} you down… Usually the athletes who win are the ones who can put those thoughts aside, and tell themselves that they’ve got a good crack at winning.” Meanwhile, Cole put those thoughts aside and went on to win 6 medals at Rio.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with Fortune magazine, Activision's CEO of Publishing Eric Hirshberg found <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>after</b> five years without a game, the Guitar Hero brand still enjoyed high social media attention, with over 10 million followers on the Guitar Heros Facebook page. However, Hirshberg stated that Activision realized they needed to reinvent the series so that consumers would not consider it {{much the same as}} previous games and to help sway those that were turned off by the earlier saturation of music games.|$|E
5|$|The {{changeover}} {{period during}} which the former currencies' notes and coins were exchanged for those of the euro lasted about two months, from 1 January 2002 until 28 February 2002. The official date on which the national currencies ceased to be legal tender varied from member state to member state. The earliest date was in Germany, where the mark officially ceased to be legal tender on 31 December 2001, though the exchange period lasted for two months after <b>that.</b> <b>Even</b> <b>after</b> the old currencies ceased to be legal tender, they continued {{to be accepted by}} national central banks for ten years or more.|$|E

5|$|In 1274 Pope Gregory X convened the Second Council of Lyon. Abaqa sent a {{delegation}} of 13 to 16 Mongols to the Council, which created a great stir, particularly when three of their members underwent a public baptism. Abaqa's Latin secretary Rychaldus delivered {{a report to the}} Council which outlined previous European-Ilkhanid relations under Abaqa's father, Hulagu, affirming that after Hulagu had welcomed Christian ambassadors to his court, he had agreed to exempt Latin Christians from taxes and charges, in exchange for their prayers for the Khan. According to Rychaldus, Hulagu had also prohibited the molestation of Frank establishments, and had committed to return Jerusalem to the Franks. Rychaldus assured the assembly <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>after</b> Hulagu's death, his son Abaqa was still determined to drive the Mamluks from Syria.|$|E
5|$|Both of {{the latest}} bailout {{programme}} audit reports, released independently by the European Commission and IMF in June 2014, revealed <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>after</b> transfer of the scheduled bailout funds and full implementation of the agreed adjustment package in 2012, {{there was a new}} forecast financing gap of: €5.6bn in 2014, €12.3bn in 2015, and €0bn in 2016. The new forecast financing gaps will need either to be covered by the government's additional lending from private capital markets, or to be countered by additional fiscal improvements through expenditure reductions, revenue hikes or increased amount of privatizations. Due to an improved outlook for the Greek economy, with return of a government structural surplus in 2012, return of real GDP growth in 2014, and a decline of the unemployment rate in 2015, it was possible for the Greek government to return to the bond market during the course of 2014, for the purpose of fully funding its new extra financing gaps with additional private capital. A total of €6.1bn was received from the sale of three-year and five-year bonds in 2014, and the Greek government now plans to cover its forecast financing gap for 2015 with additional sales of seven-year and ten-year bonds in 2015.|$|E

25|$|The tomb of Sir Francis Shirley was {{repaired}} after 60 {{years by}} his great-grandson, Thomas Shirley.

25|$|This {{demonstrates}} <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>after</b> 1896 {{the career}} figures were sufficiently uncertain that he revised {{the list of}} first-class matches.

25|$|Most natural {{satellites}} of {{the planets}} undergo tidal acceleration to some degree (usually small), except for the two classes of tidally decelerated bodies. In most cases, however, the effect is small enough <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>after</b> billions of years most satellites will not actually be lost. The effect is probably most pronounced for Mars's second moon Deimos, which may become an Earth-crossing asteroid after it leaks out of Mars's grip.|$|E

25|$|By contrast, Catholicism, {{while also}} {{maintaining}} that humanity's original nature is good (CCC 374), teaches <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>after</b> this gift was lost after the Fall, human nature still cannot be called evil, because {{it remains a}} natural creation of God. Despite the fact that humans sin, Catholic theology teaches that human nature itself is {{not the cause of}} sin, although once it comes into contact with sin it may produce more sin.|$|E
25|$|Also in the {{expedition}} was microbiologist Dr Lori Johnston, who placed samples on Britannic {{to look at}} the colonies of iron-eating bacteria on the wreck, which are responsible for the rusticles growing on Titanic. The results showed <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>after</b> 87 years {{on the bottom of the}} Kea Channel, Britannic is in much better condition than Titanic because the bacteria on her hull have too much competition and are actually helping protect the wreck by turning it into a man-made reef.|$|E
25|$|Ossining High School, 29 South Highland Avenue. James Gamble Rogers contributed the {{original}} Collegiate Gothic building in 1930.

Alvarado also noted <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>after</b> a 10% reduction, the Mayor's office spent $1.8 million more than Hahn {{in the last year}} of his administration and $1.4 million more than Riordan.

25|$|Baldus, a law {{professor}} at the University of Iowa College of Law, studied 2500 murder cases in Georgia. Baldus' study concluded that all individuals convicted of murdering whites were far more likely to receive the death penalty, thus establishing that the application of the death penalty in Georgia was linked with the race of the victim. One of his models concluded <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>after</b> taking account of 39 nonracial variables, defendants charged with killing white victims were 4.3 times as likely to receive a death sentence than defendants charged with killing blacks.|$|E
25|$|Above Newhalem, Washington, the Skagit {{flows through}} a deep gorge, {{contrasting}} strongly with the glacial valley below Newhalem. One {{of the several}} theories about this anomaly is that the upper Skagit once drained northward into Canada and the growth and retreat of successive Cordilleran ice flows brought about the reversal. Each advance blocked the river, forcing it to find new routes to the south, in the process carving deep gorges. Eventually, the Skagit gorge was so deep <b>that</b> <b>even</b> <b>after</b> the Cordilleran ice retreated for good, the river continued flowing south instead of north into Canada.|$|E
