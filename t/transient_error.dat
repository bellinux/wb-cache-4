As embedded processors are widely used in reliability-critical or noisy environments, {{it is necessary to}} develop cost-effective fault-tolerant techniques to protect processors against <b>transient</b> <b>errors.</b> The register file is one of the critical components that can significantly affect microproces-sor system reliability, since registers are typically accessed very frequently, and <b>transient</b> <b>errors</b> in registers can be easily propagated to functional units or the memory system, leading to silent data error (SDC) or system crash.

40|$|Electrosurgery is used {{in modern}} {{surgical}} practice to cause various desirable clinical effects by invoking I 2 R heating in tissue. The ability to achieve a consistent clinical result is predicated {{on the ability of}} the electrosurgical instrument to deliver a well-regulated constant output power, capable of quickly responding to changes in tissue impedance. Yet, electrosurgical devices available today suffer from very poor transient output power regulation, with potential for improvement limited by inherent restrictions in the chosen system architectures. This thesis presents a revolutionary new approach to the design of electrosurgical power supplies by employing current-programmed mode (“CPM”) control strategies to inherently achieve the desired output characteristic: a constant power AC source with maximum voltage and current limits and with near-deadbeat regulation. CPM control of a full-bridge boost inverter and nonlinear carrier-control of a buck converter are presented as new methods of producing constant power source AC outputs. Analysis and small-signal models contained herein demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed constant power control schemes, showing that major sources of non-idealities include peak-to-average error, artificial ramp-induced error, and <b>transient</b> <b>error.</b> The nonlinear carrier controlled buck power source exhibits a <b>transient</b> <b>error</b> dependent {{on the size of the}} inductor, while the CPM controlled boost power source <b>transient</b> <b>error</b> is independent of the inductor size. A prototype ESG employing CPM control generates the ideal output characteristic and achieves near-deadbeat regulation of output power. Maximum voltage- and current-limits are invoked equally quickly. The standard deviation in per-cycle output power during arc cutting is less than 2 %, compared to greater than 25 % in the prior art. Histological analysis of ex vivo tissue samples shows a marked decrease in collateral tissue damage, proving a previously unknown correlation between high-speed output power regulation and thermally-induced tissue necrosis. Simultaneous control of multiple converter stages in the prototype demonstrates the ability to achieve high peak output voltages with low average power using a continuous output carrier: a significant simplification over the prior art...|$|E
