500|$|When Roebling {{was called}} to the Niagara Suspension Bridge project in 1851, he had six {{suspension}} structures to his name. [...] He found Ellet's final plan to be impractical; the bridge {{would have been too}} heavy and expensive. [...] Roebling had another design in mind: the double-deck bridge he had proposed earlier during the bidding. [...] The lower deck, level with the edge of the chasm, would convey passengers and carriages, and the upper deck, [...] above, would allow fully laden trains to continue their journeys non-stop, albeit at a speed of [...] [...] Roebling reasoned that the decks and sufficient trusses would form a rigid tube, making the bridge stiffer than a normal suspension bridge. [...] The theory was {{similar to that of the}} <b>tubular</b> <b>bridge</b> but implemented at a lower cost. [...] The engineering community was critical of Roebling's project. [...] Robert Stephenson, builder of the tubular Britannia Bridge, was among those short-listed to complete the Niagara Suspension Bridge before Roebling's selection. [...] Stephenson had submitted a design for a <b>tubular</b> <b>bridge,</b> and in 1859 he built a large and expensive <b>tubular</b> <b>bridge</b> for the Grand Trunk Railway at Montreal, Quebec. [...] The bridge builder then said in derision of Roebling's suspension railway, [...] "If your bridge succeeds, mine is a magnificent blunder." ...|$|E
500|$|American {{engineers}} {{regard the}} Suspension Bridge {{as a major}} achievement of efficiency. [...] In a fledgling country where resources—material and financial—were limited, {{they had to make}} do with whatever was available. [...] This goal was espoused by the American Society of Civil Engineers, which opined, [...] "That is the best engineering, not which makes the most splendid, or even the most perfect work, but that which makes a work that answers the purpose well, at the least cost." [...] Roebling had built a bridge that rivaled grander bridges of leading European nations at a much lower cost. [...] His Suspension Bridge used only one-sixth the material of Stephenson's Brittania Bridge, but was twice as long and had a capacity that exceeded the <b>tubular</b> <b>bridge.</b> [...] Moreover, the expenditure on Roebling's Suspension Bridge was $400,000, whereas a <b>tubular</b> <b>bridge</b> of equivalent length and load-bearing capability would have cost $4million. [...] Roebling's success established him as the master of suspension bridges. [...] The inclined guy-wires that stretched from the top of towers to the roadway of the Suspension Bridge became the signature of his future works.|$|E
500|$|In 1852 Brassey {{took out}} the largest {{contract}} of his career, which was to build the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada. This line passed from Quebec, along {{the valley of the}} Saint Lawrence River, and then to the north of Lake Ontario to Toronto. The line totalled [...] in length. The consulting engineer for the project was Robert Stephenson and the company's engineer for the whole undertaking was Alexander Ross. Brassey worked in partnership with Peto, Betts and Sir William Jackson. The line crossed the river at Montreal by the Victoria Bridge. This was a <b>tubular</b> <b>bridge</b> designed by Robert Stephenson and was the longest bridge in the world at the time, measuring some [...] The bridge opened in 1859 and the formal opening ceremony was carried out the following year by the Prince of Wales. The construction of the line caused considerable problems. [...] The main problem was the raising of the necessary finance and at one stage Brassey travelled to Canada to appeal personally for assistance. [...] Other difficulties arose from the severity of the Canadian winter, the waterways being frozen for around six months each year, and resistance from Canadian businessmen. [...] The line was an engineering success but a financial failure, with the contractors losing £1 million.|$|E
50|$|In total 85 {{miles of}} double track railway were under {{construction}} during a four-year period including two large and most impressive bridges at technically very demanding locations. The pioneering {{design of the}} Conwy railway <b>bridge</b> and Britannia <b>Tubular</b> <b>Bridges</b> occupied much of Stephenson's personal attention and his work with William Fairbairn pushed forward the boundaries of railway engineering.

Fawcett says, [...] "The reasons for not using wrought iron was due to some engineers' {{distrust}} of rivetting, the relatively small size of wrought iron plates then available, and the higher cost… On 1st October 1845 when the Newcastle and Berwick Board instructed T E Harrison for their bridges, none of the uses of wrought iron had been developed far enough to be considered {{as an alternative to}} cast iron for the High Level Bridge. A <b>tubular</b> <b>bridge</b> might have been considered by Robert Stephenson but the distance between solid and reasonably shallow foundations would have given a span much larger than the Britannia Bridge." ...|$|E

40|$|With the advancements {{in quiet}} engine technology, {{reduction}} of the fan noise sources, and use of higher mean flow speeds, the aerodynamic noise generation due to unsteady and turbulent mean flow in the ducts of automotive exhaust muffler may become {{a significant source of}} exhaust noise, thereby limiting the net insertion loss of the muffler. Three-pass double-reversal muffler is often used in automotive exhaust systems. This muffler is characterized by a fairly wide-band transmission loss (TL) curve as well as relatively low back pressure. However in the flow-reversal end chambers, it produces a lot of aerodynamic noise due to impingement of jets on the end plates, generation of free shear layer and vortex shedding. This paper deals with the design and analysis of the muffler with a novel feature (<b>tubular</b> <b>bridges</b> in the end-chambers) specially configured to minimize the free shear layer in the end chambers of the three-pass double-reversal muffler as well as to provide adequate acoustic transmission loss and to further reduce the back pressure of the muffler. The TL curve predicted by means of the 1 -D integrated transfer matrix (ITM) approach is validated against the 3 -D FEM and compared with that of the base muffler (without <b>tubular</b> <b>bridges).</b> Back pressure of the configuration with <b>tubular</b> <b>bridges,</b> estimated by means of the lumped flow-resistance network, is shown to be considerably less than that of the base muffler.

2500|$|For the {{detailed}} {{design of the}} girders Stephenson secured {{the assistance of the}} distinguished engineer William Fairbairn,an old friend of his father and described by Stephenson as [...] "well known for his thorough practical knowledge in such matters". Fairbairn began a series of practical experiments on various tube shapes and enlisted the help of Eaton Hodgkinson [...] "distinguished as the first scientific authority on the strength of iron beams" [...] It became apparent from Fairbairn's experiments that- without special precautions - the failure mode for the tube under load would be buckling of the top plate in compression, the theoretical analysis of which gave Hodgkinson some difficulty. When Stephenson reported to the directors of the railway in February 1846, he attached reports by both Hodgkinson and Fairbairn. From his analysis of the resistance to buckling of tubes with single top plates, Hodgkinson believed that it would require an impracticably thick (and therefore heavy) top plate to make the tubes stiff enough to support their own weight, and advised auxiliary suspension from link chains. However, Fairbairn's experiments had moved on from those covered by Hodgkinson's theory to include designs in which the top plate was stiffened by 'corrugation' (the incorporation of cylindrical tubes). The results of these later experiments he found very encouraging; whilst it was still to be determined what the optimum form of the tubular girder should be [...] "I would venture to state that a <b>Tubular</b> <b>Bridge</b> can be constructed of such powers and dimensions as will meet, with perfect security, the requirements of railway traffic across the Straits" [...] although it might require more materials than originally envisaged and the utmost care would be needed in its construction. [...] He believed it would be 'highly improper' to rely upon chains as the principal support of the bridge. Under every circumstance, I am of opinion that the tubes should be made sufficiently strong to sustain not only their own weight, but in addition to that load 2000 tons equally distributed over the surface of the platform, a load ten times greater than they will ever be called upon to support.|$|E
60|$|Over {{and beyond}} Sir William Logan, {{there is at}} Montreal for strangers the drive round the mountain, not very exciting, {{and there is the}} <b>tubular</b> <b>bridge</b> over the St. Lawrence. This, it must be understood, is not made in one tube, as is that over the Menai Straits, but is divided into, I think, {{thirteen}} tubes. To the eye there appear to be twenty-five tubes; but each of the six side tubes is supported by a pier in the middle. A great part of the expense of the bridge was incurred in sinking the shafts for these piers.|$|E
60|$|Let it not {{be thought}} that I would {{depreciate}} (were it possible to depreciate) the mechanical ingenuity which has been displayed in the erection of the Crystal Palace, or that I underrate the effect which its vastness may continue to produce on the popular imagination. But mechanical ingenuity is not the essence either of painting or architecture, and largeness of dimension does not necessarily involve nobleness of design. There is assuredly as much ingenuity required to build a screw frigate, or a <b>tubular</b> <b>bridge,</b> as a hall of glass;--all these are works characteristic of the age; and all, in their several ways, deserve our highest admiration, but not admiration {{of the kind that}} is rendered to poetry or to art.

40|$|A {{critical}} aspect in {{the design}} of <b>tubular</b> <b>bridges</b> is the fatigue performance of the structural joints. The estimation of a fatigue crack life using the Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics (LEFM) theory involves the calculation of stress intensity factors (SIF) at a number of discrete crack depths. The most direct way is to carry out modeling by either the finite element method (FEM) or the boundary element method (BEM). For tubular joints commonly found in <b>tubular</b> <b>bridges</b> and off-shore structures, due to the complicated geometry resulted from the tubes intersection and welding, the construction of the numerical model often becomes a complex process. This paper presents two different model construction techniques that have been developed independently at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) and the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore that are based in the BEM and the FEM, respectively. The SIF values obtained by these two methods are compared. It is Accepted Manuscript found that so long as consistent geometrical models are employed, compatible SIF values Not Copyedite...|$|R

Probably it might be easy now to show that the road might have been made with sufficient accommodation for ordinary purposes without some of the more costly details. The great <b>tubular</b> <b>bridge,</b> on which was expended 1,300,000 pounds, might, I should think, have been dispensed with. The Detroit end of the line might have been left for later time. As it stands now, however, it is a wonderful operation carried to a successful issue as far as the public are concerned; and one can only grieve that it should be so absolute a failure to those who have placed their money in it. There are schemes which seem to be too big for men to work out with any ordinary regard to profit and loss. The Great Eastern is one, and this is another. The national advantage arising from such enterprises is immense; but the wonder is that men should be found willing to embark their money where the risk is so great and the return even hoped for is so small.|$|E

At breakfast next morning they could hardly tell on what country they had fallen. The waiters had but a thin varnish of English speech upon their native French, and they spoke their own tongue with each other; but most of the meats were cooked to the English taste, and the whole was a poor imitation of an American hotel. During their stay the same commingling of usages and races bewildered them; the shops were English and the clerks were commonly French; the carriage-drivers were often Irish, and up and down the streets with their pious old-fashioned names, tinkled American horse-cars. Everywhere were churches and convents that recalled the ecclesiastical and feudal origin of the city; the great <b>tubular</b> <b>bridge,</b> the superb water-front with its long array of docks only surpassed by those of Liverpool, the solid blocks of business houses, and the substantial mansions on the quieter streets, proclaimed the succession of Protestant thrift and energy.|$|E
60|$|The {{deck of the}} Great Eastern is double, or cellular, {{after the}} plan of the Britannia <b>Tubular</b> <b>Bridge.</b> The upper deck runs flush and clear from stem to stern, and he who takes four turns up and down it from stem to stern walks upwards of a mile. The {{strength}} of this deck is so enormous that if the ship were taken up by its two extremities, with all its cargo, passengers, coals, and provisions on board, it would sustain the whole. The deck has been covered with teak planking, and has been planed and scrubbed to man-of-war whiteness. Not even a stray rope's end breaks the wonderful effect produced by its immense expanse. Her fleet of small boats, which are {{about the size of}} sailing cutters, hang at the davits, ten on each side. There are six masts and five funnels. The three centre square-rigged masts are of iron. They were made by Mr Finch of Chepstow, and are the finest specimens of masts of the kind that were ever manufactured. Each is made of hollow wrought iron in eight-feet lengths, strengthened inside by diaphragms of the same material. Between the joints, as they were bolted together, was placed a pad of vulcanised india-rubber, which gives a spring and buoyancy to the whole spar greater than wood, {{while at the same time}} it retains all the strength of the iron. The other masts are made of wood, and the canvas that can be spread is no less than 6500 square yards. On deck are four small steam winches or engines, each of which works a pair of cranes on both sides of the vessel; and with these five thousand tons of coals can be hoisted into the vessel in twenty-four hours.|$|E

Right at the foot of it an old woman has her stand for the sale of lithographic views of Conway and other places; but these views are ridiculously inadequate, so that we did not buy any of them. The admittance into the castle is by a wooden door of modern construction, and the present seneschal is, I believe, the sexton of a church. He remembered me as having been there a month or two ago; and probably, considering that I was already initiated, or else because he had many other visitors, he left us to wander about the castle at will. It is altogether impossible to describe Conway Castle. Nothing ever can have been so perfect in its own style, and for its own purposes, when it was first built; and now nothing else can be so perfect as a picture of ivy-grown, peaceful ruin. The banqueting-hall, all open to the sky and with thick curtains of ivy tapestrying the walls, and grass and weeds growing on the arches that overpass it, is indescribably beautiful. The hearthstones of the great old fireplaces, all about the castle, seem to be favorite spots for weeds to grow. There are eight large round towers, and out of four of them, I think, rise smaller towers, ascending to a much greater height, and once containing winding staircases, all of which are now broken, and inaccessible from below, though, in {{at least one of the}} towers, the stairs seemed perfect, high aloft. It must have been the rudest violence that broke down these stairs; for each step was a thick and heavy slab of stone, built into the wall of the tower. There is no such thing as a roof in any part; towers, hall, kitchen, all are open to the sky. One round tower, directly overhanging the railway, is so shattered by the falling away of the lower part, that you can look quite up into it and through it, while sitting in the cars; and yet it has stood thus, without falling into complete ruin, for more than two hundred years. I think that it was in this tower that we found the castle oven, an immense cavern, big enough to bake bread for an army. The railway passes exactly at the base of the high rock, on which this part of the castle is situated, and goes into the town through a great arch that has been opened in the castle wall. The <b>tubular</b> <b>bridge</b> across the Conway has been built in a style that accords with the old architecture, and I observed that one little sprig of ivy had rooted itself in the new structure.|$|E
