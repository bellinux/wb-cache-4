5|$|A {{specialist}} {{was hired}} to enhance the game's artificial intelligence and give enemies more lifelike behaviour. In previous Tomb Raider games, enemies would simply run at Lara and attack immediately, whereas in Tomb Raider III, enemies can pop {{out of the dark}} and attack the player, or retreat back into the level and regroup to attack later. A stealth element partially inspired by Rare's 1997 hit GoldenEye 007 was also introduced, giving players the option of sneaking around and avoid detection. New vehicles that are critical to complete certain levels were added; the team also experimented with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> Lara on horseback, but they ultimately discarded it. The development of the game took eleven months to complete, and incorporating all the new ideas into the engine was considered the most difficult task of the project.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the sudden}} {{popularity}} of the Terrible Towel, Pittsburgh-area department stores sold out all gold and black hand towels. Because the hand towels were often sold as a set, with matching bath towels, stores were left with un-even sets. In the fall of 1978, Bernard Pollock, divisional marketing manager of Gimbel's Department Store came up with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> a Terrible Towel logo on hand towels and sold the idea to Cope. The first Terrible Towels hit the marketplace on December 20, 1978 at $6 apiece. Gimbel's could not stock them fast enough. Gimbel's has since gone out of business. The original version of The Terrible Towel was manufactured by Fieldcrest and distributed by St. Mary's Inc. of New York and was available in two colors: Gold and Black. The current manufacturer of the Towel is Little Earth Productions, Inc. of Pittsburgh, who took over from McArthur Towel & Sports Co. of Baraboo, Wisconsin in 2013. The current cost of a towel is approximately $12 (in May, 2017, at Steelers' online store).|$|E

500|$|The writers {{say that}} {{they did not want to}} force modernity onto the story. There were some {{creative}} challenges, such as the decision to include the sign [...] "221B" [...] on Holmes' front door. Gatiss and Moffat reflect that in the modern world the door would only display the number of the house, and there would be doorbells for each flat. The full house number is so iconic that they felt unable to change it. The writers also decided that the lead characters would address each other by their first names, rather than the traditional Holmes and Watson. This was also reflected in the title of the series. Director Paul McGuigan came up with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> text messages on the screen instead of having cut-away shots of a hand holding the phone.|$|E

McLaren thought he was working with a tabula rasa, but he soon found out that Rotten has ideas of his own". On the other hand, there is little disagreement about McLaren's marketing talent and his crucial role in making the band a subcultural phenomenon soon after its debut.

[...] The dark tone of the series was influenced by the 1970s ABC soap opera Dark Shadows, which Murphy's grandmother forced him to watch when he was younger to toughen him up. In addition, the series draws inspiration from classic horror films such as Roman Polanski's Rosemary's Baby and Stanley Kubrick's The Shining.|$|E

[...] State Department officials stressed that Kerry's statement and its one-week deadline were rhetorical in light of the unlikelihood of Syria turning over its chemical weapons. Hours after Kerry's statement, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov announced that Russia had suggested to Syria that it relinquish its chemical weapons, and Syrian foreign minister Walid al-Moallem immediately welcomed the proposal, and U.S.–Russian negotiations led to the 14 September 2013 [...] "Framework for Elimination of Syrian Chemical Weapons," [...] which called for the elimination of Syria's chemical weapon stockpiles by mid-2014. Following the agreement, Syria acceded to the Chemical Weapons Convention and agreed to apply that convention provisionally until its formal entry into force on 14 October 2013. On 21 September, Syria ostensibly provided a list of its chemical weapons to the OPCW, before the deadline set by the framework.|$|E

They start as messages on Wednesday night, things we're teaching our teenagers and their families"; Until the Whole World Hears retains that same formula. Hall also stated that the musical sound of their songs is written {{so as not to}} conflict or detract from the lyrics, comparing the musical elements of his songs to a plate that the 'meat', the lyrics, are served on. A philosophy that [...] "fuels" [...] the album is <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> [...] "faith in action"; Hall stated that he wanted believers to become more active in their faith, and to [...] "get out of their pews and get involved in what God is doing". [...] "Always Enough" [...] was written when a member of Hall's church was killed in Afghanistan; the band was unable to attend his funeral, as they were {{on the other side of}} the United States and couldn't cancel their tour dates. Another song on the album, the title track, was inspired by the Biblical character of John the Baptist. Several songs on the album are reinventions of hymns, which Hall enjoyed experimenting with; Hall retained the lyrics of the songs while reworking their melodies.|$|E

500|$|In May 1969, the Treasury sought {{authorization}} {{to eliminate the}} half dollar's silver content, changing it to the same copper-nickel clad composition as the dime and quarter. [...] The Treasury also sought approval to strike base-metal dollar coins, which would fill a need for gaming tokens in Western casinos. [...] Former president Dwight Eisenhower had died recently, and there was discussion of placing Eisenhower's portrait on the dollar. [...] The Treasury hoped that with {{the removal of the}} silver content, the coin would cease to be hoarded and again circulate. [...] Despite the support of President Richard Nixon, some Republicans in the House of Representatives initially scuttled the legislation, disliking <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> Eisenhower on a base metal coin. [...] The dispute dragged on for over a year before Nixon signed a bill on December 31, 1970 which authorized the Eisenhower dollar and eliminated silver from the half dollar. [...] As a result of the delay, in 1970 non-proof half dollars were only made in Denver and released solely in mint sets.

500|$|In {{his final}} University Match, Oxford batted first and Jardine's innings began after {{his team had}} lost two wickets without scoring any runs. He batted for 285 minutes, scoring 140. Before lunch, he played very {{carefully}} but increased his scoring rate afterwards. In total, he hit 21 fours and The Times described his innings as faultless. Wisden noted his strong defence and his powerful leg glance. Critics noted that he frequently hit Stanley Jackson to the leg side, a method of play which was unusual at the time. Players educated at Public School generally considered hitting to leg highly unorthodox and almost unfair. K. S. Ranjitsinhji, {{who was in the}} crowd at Lord's, would develop the leg glance and make it respectable within a few years, but he had not yet made his first-class debut in 1892. It is likely that Jardine {{was one of the first}} players to use this shot. Jackson refused to depart from the orthodox methods of the time, continuing to bowl with seven fielders on the off side and only two on the leg side, making it easier for Jardine to score runs.The Times commented that Cambridge [...] "appeared a little slow to grasp <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> a man on the leg side for [...] ". Jardine also hit 39 in the second innings as Oxford chased down a target to win for the only time in his University career. Jardine's first innings remained his only first-class century.|$|E
500|$|Leslie {{indicates}} {{she had a}} dream involving American actress Gina Gershon. For her mural, Donna {{proposes a}} recreation of Leonardo da Vinci's painting The Last Supper with Indiana natives {{in place of the}} apostles. Actor Greg Kinnear was chosen to replace Jesus, with the Apostles replaced by John Mellencamp, Larry Bird, Michael Jackson, David Letterman and a NASCAR race car, among others. Jerry presents for his mural a work of pointillism, a style of painting in which small distinct dots of color create the impression of a wider image. When proposing her somber mural, Leslie claims tragedy often succeeds in awards, and specifically cites the Academy Awards which honor the film industry. As an example, Leslie uses The English Patient, the 1996 Best Picture winner during the 69th Academy Awards. Upon first receiving his painting, Tom says, [...] "It looks like a lizard puking up Skittles", a reference to the multi-colored candies. Leslie, upon <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>putting</b> the best parts of each design into a new mural, says it is like having Michelangelo, Andy Warhol, Jackson Pollock and Jim Davis do one painting. When Mark tries to get out of helping with the mural, he uses the excuse, [...] "I was gonna go to Arby's and watch Frontline", a reference to a fast food restaurant chain and a Public Broadcasting Service public affairs program.

[...] A review for The Beaver County Times considered it a [...] "stunt episode" [...] and its humor [...] "uncharacteristically forced", saying it [...] "really doesn't do justice to the show's considerable charms." [...] Steve Johnson of Chicago Tribune affirmed that while the premise is funny, [...] "the writers {{go out of their way}} to play the city against his condition." [...] He continued by saying it [...] "wouldn't be so bad" [...] if he went to solve crimes [...] "but Friday's first case is a real stretch." [...] Although excited for the episode's premise prior its broadcast, Austin Smith of the New York Post was very critical of it. Smith said in this episode [...] "the producers have him [...] crossing that fine line between genius and insanity, transforming our hero into a full-blown mental patient." [...] He also criticized the [...] "Mr. Monk vs. the City of New York" [...] scenes as they do not further the episode's plot. Smith co-worker, Linda Stasi also panned the episode, considering Monk's reactions [...] "caricature". Stasi wrote, [...] "It's one thing to be an obsessive/compulsive ex-detective who lines up the pins on the murder map and it's another to act like you've got a pin in your brain." [...] As Smith, Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times called the jokes [...] "predictable" [...] and said [...] "If you aren't a Monk fan, these devices may strike you as altogether shopworn." ...|$|E
