5|$|Prior to {{signing the}} accords, Arafat—as Chairman of <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> and its {{official}} representative—signed two letters renouncing violence and officially recognizing Israel. In return, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, {{on behalf of}} Israel, officially recognized <b>the</b> <b>PLO.</b> The following year, Arafat and Rabin were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, along with Shimon Peres. The Palestinian reaction was mixed. The Rejectionist Front of <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> allied itself with Islamists in a common opposition against the agreements. It was rejected also by Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan {{as well as by}} many Palestinian intellectuals and the local leadership of the Palestinian territories. However, the inhabitants of the territories generally accepted the agreements and Arafat's promise for peace and economic well-being.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with {{the terms of the}} Oslo agreement, Arafat was required to implement PLO authority in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He insisted that financial support was imperative to establishing this authority and needed it to secure the acceptance of the agreements by the Palestinians living in those areas. However, Arab states of the Persian Gulf—Arafat's usual source for financial backing—still refused to provide him and <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> with any major donations for siding with Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War. Ahmed Qurei—a key Fatah negotiator during the negotiations in Oslo—publicly announced that <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> was bankrupt.|$|E
5|$|Because of Lebanon's weak central government, <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> {{was able}} to operate {{virtually}} as an independent state. During {{this time in the}} 1970s, numerous leftist PLO groups took up arms against Israel, carrying out attacks against civilians as well as military targets within Israel and outside of it.|$|E
50|$|The EC {{represents}} the organization internationally. It {{represents the}} Palestinian people, supervises <b>the</b> various <b>PLO</b> bodies, executes <b>the</b> policies and decisions set {{out by the}} PNC, and handles <b>the</b> <b>PLO’s</b> financial issues. It meets abroad and in the Palestinian territories.|$|R
50|$|In a {{press conference}} on 14 December, Arafat {{emphasized}} <b>the</b> <b>PLO's</b> endorsement of Resolution 181 {{as the basis for}} Palestinian independence and Resolutions 242 and 338 as the basis for negotiations with Israel within the framework of an international conference. Arafat also affirmed <b>the</b> <b>PLO's</b> position, that Israel has the right to exist in peace and security and the absolute renouncement of all forms of terrorism.|$|R
50|$|The {{founding}} {{platform of}} APF {{was based on}} <b>the</b> 1968 <b>PLO</b> Covenant and <b>the</b> 1974 <b>PLO</b> Program of Stages.|$|R
5|$|When the Palestinian National Council (PNC) {{convened in}} Cairo on 3 February 1969, Yahya Hammuda {{stepped down from}} his {{chairmanship}} of <b>the</b> <b>PLO.</b> Arafat was elected chairman on 4 February. He became Commander-in-Chief of the Palestinian Revolutionary Forces two years later, and in 1973, became {{the head of the}} PLO's political department.|$|E
5|$|After the Six-Day War in 1967, <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> {{moved their}} bases to Jordan and stepped up their guerrilla attacks against Israel, taking the border town of Karameh as their headquarters. The IDF {{claimed that the}} purpose was to destroy <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> militant camps at Karameh and capture Yasser Arafat as reprisal, however, it is also {{believed}} that it wanted to punish Jordan for its perceived support to Palestinian fighters (fedayeen, meaning self-sacrificers). Israel assumed the Jordanian Army would choose to not get involved in the battle, but the latter deployed heavy artillery fire. The Israelis withdrew, or were repulsed, after a day-long battle, having destroyed most of the Karameh camp and taken around 140 PLO members prisoner. The battle resulted in the issuance of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 248, which unanimously condemned Israel for violating the cease-fire line and its disproportionate use of force.|$|E
5|$|Al-Wazir {{married his}} cousin Intissar al-Wazir in 1962 and had five {{children}} with her. They had three sons, named Jihad, Bassem and Nidal, and two daughters, named Iman and Hanan al-Wazir. Intissar {{and her children}} returned to Gaza following the Oslo Accords between Israel and <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> and in 1996 {{she became the first}} female minister in the Palestinian National Authority. His son Jihad al-Wazir is currently the Governor of the Palestinian Monetary Authority.|$|E

50|$|The Ghaben {{brothers}} {{were born in}} Kuwait and fled to Egypt after the Gulf War, because of <b>the</b> <b>PLO's</b> support of Saddam Hussein.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, Yasser Arafat {{appointed}} Nusseibeh as <b>the</b> <b>PLO's</b> {{representative in}} East Jerusalem, {{a position he}} assumed after {{the sudden death of}} Faisal Husseini.|$|R
5|$|Although {{hesitant}} {{at first}} to take sides in the conflict, Arafat and Fatah {{played an important role}} in the Lebanese Civil War. Succumbing to pressure from PLO sub-groups such as the PFLP, DFLP and the Palestine Liberation Front (PLF), Arafat aligned <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> with the Communist and Nasserist Lebanese National Movement (LNM). The LNM was led by Kamal Jumblatt, who had a friendly relationship with Arafat and other PLO leaders. Although originally aligned with Fatah, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad feared a loss of influence in Lebanon and switched sides. He sent his army, along with the Syrian-backed Palestinian factions of as-Sa'iqa and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command (PFLP-GC) led by Ahmad Jibril to fight alongside right-wing Christian forces against <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> and the LNM. The primary components of the Christian front were the Phalangists loyal to Bachir Gemayel and the Tigers Militia led by Dany Chamoun, a son of former President Camille Chamoun.|$|E
5|$|On 3 June 1982, ANO {{operative}} Hussein Ghassan Said shot Shlomo Argov, the Israeli {{ambassador to}} Britain, {{once in the}} head {{as he left the}} Dorchester Hotel in London. Said was accompanied by Nawaf al-Rosan, an Iraqi intelligence officer, and Marwan al-Banna, Abu Nidal's cousin. Argov survived, but spent three months in a coma {{and the rest of his}} life disabled, until his death in February 2003. <b>The</b> <b>PLO</b> quickly denied responsibility for the attack.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the Gulf War in 1990–91, {{when the}} Intifada's {{intensity}} began to wear down, Arafat supported Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and opposed the US-led coalition attack on Iraq. He made this decision {{without the consent}} of other leading members of Fatah and <b>the</b> <b>PLO.</b> Arafat's top aide Abu Iyad vowed to stay neutral and opposed an alliance with Saddam; On 17 January 1991, Abu Iyad was assassinated by the Abu Nidal Organization. Arafat's decision also severed relations with Egypt and many of the oil-producing Arab states that supported the US-led coalition. Many in the US also used Arafat's position as a reason to disregard his claims to being a partner for peace. After the end of hostilities, many Arab states that backed the coalition cut off funds to <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> and began providing financial support for the organization's rival Hamas and other Islamist groups. Arafat narrowly escaped death again on 7 April 1992, when an Air Bissau aircraft he was a passenger on crash-landed in the Libyan Desert during a sandstorm. Two pilots and an engineer were killed; Arafat was bruised and shaken.|$|E
50|$|The {{predecessor}} of the NSF was <b>the</b> <b>PLO's</b> Palestine Liberation Army. When the NSF were formed, most personnel {{was recruited}} from the PLA. Gradually, local recruits were added.|$|R
50|$|The Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs has {{regarded}} {{that the}} Palestinian leadership {{asserted that the}} Oslo Accord is part of <b>the</b> <b>PLO's</b> 1974 phased plan for Israel's destruction.|$|R
50|$|The Palestine Liberation Organization {{also had}} its {{headquarters}} in Tunis, from 1982 to 2003.In 1985, <b>the</b> <b>PLO's</b> headquarters was bombed by the Israeli Air Force (F-15), killing approximately 60 people.|$|R
5|$|Shortly after Black September, Abu Nidal began accusing <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> of cowardice {{over his}} Voice of Palestine {{radio station in}} Iraq for having agreed to a ceasefire with Hussein. During Fatah's Third Congress in Damascus in 1971, Abu Nidal joined Palestinian activist and writer Naji Allush and Abu Daoud (leader of the Black September Organization {{responsible}} for the 1972 Munich Massacre), calling for greater democracy within Fatah and revenge against King Hussein.|$|E
5|$|The Intifada {{began as}} an {{uprising}} of Palestinian youth against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. On June 7, 1986, about {{a year before the}} Intifada started, al-Wazir was deported from Amman to Baghdad, eventually moving to Tunisia days after King Hussein declared that efforts in establishing a joint strategy for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict between Jordan and <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> were over.|$|E
5|$|When Israel besieged Beirut in 1982, al-Wazir, {{disagreed}} with the PLO's leftist members and Salah Khalaf; he proposed that <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> pull out of Beirut. Nevertheless, al-Wazir and his aide Abu al-Walid planned Beirut's defense and helped direct PLO forces against the IDF. PLO forces were eventually defeated and then expelled from Lebanon, {{with most of the}} leadership relocating to Tunis, although al-Wazir and 264 other PLO members were received by King Hussein of Jordan.|$|E
50|$|In 2001 {{the first}} draft of a {{constitution}} authorized by <b>the</b> <b>PLO's</b> Central Committee, calling for a respect for borders, human and civil rights as defined under international law appeared.|$|R

50|$|After the Palestinian Declaration of Independence <b>the</b> <b>PLO's</b> {{representation}} {{was renamed}} Palestine. On 7 July 1998, this status {{was extended to}} allow participation in General Assembly debates, though not in voting.|$|R
5|$|Aflaq {{moved to}} Baghdad {{following}} his reelection to the Secretary Generalship in February 1968. He stayed there until 1970, when Black September happened, he criticised the Ba'ath leadership of doing {{too little to}} help the Palestine Liberation Organisation during the conflict. During the conflict, Aflaq lobbied extensively for Yasser Arafat and <b>the</b> <b>PLO.</b> Aflaq wanted Iraqi intervention; al-Bakr, however, refused to get Iraq involved in such a conflict. Because of this, Aflaq returned to Lebanon in self-imposed exile. The government of Hafez al-Assad, the President of Syria, condemned Aflaq to death in absentia in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Al-Wazir {{became a}} refugee when {{his family was}} {{expelled}} from Ramla during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, and began leading a minor fedayeen force in the Gaza Strip. In the early 1960s he established connections for Fatah with Communist regimes and prominent third-world leaders. He opened Fatah's first bureau in Algeria. He {{played an important role}} in the 1970–71 Black September clashes in Jordan, by supplying besieged Palestinian fighters with weapons and aid. Following the PLO's defeat by the Jordanian Army, al-Wazir joined <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> in Lebanon.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, the Israeli Army {{attempted}} to disperse the {{high concentration of}} Palestinian refugees in al-Shati camp and developed new housing schemes {{that resulted in the}} establishment of the northern Sheikh Radwan district. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) and <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> were vociferous in their opposition to the move, claiming it was forced resettlement. In 1972, Gaza's military governor dismissed the city's mayor, Rashad al-Shawa, for refusing to annex al-Shati camp to the municipality of Gaza. Since the 1970s, frequent conflicts erupted between Palestinians and the Israeli authorities in the city, leading to the First Intifada in 1987. Gaza became a center of confrontation during this uprising, and consequently, economic conditions in the city worsened.|$|E
5000|$|Al Fatah, <b>the</b> <b>PLO′s</b> largest faction {{headed by}} Mahmoud Abbas, {{reportedly}} {{issued a statement}} calling the Levy committee’s conclusions a [...] "farce" [...] that [...] "mocked and defied the international community".|$|R
50|$|After the 1988 Palestinian Declaration of Independence, <b>the</b> <b>PLO's</b> {{representation}} {{was renamed}} Palestine. On 7 July 1998, this status {{was extended to}} allow participation in General Assembly debates, though not in voting.|$|R
50|$|The Venice Declaration (also {{known as}} the Declaration of the Venice Summit) was an {{agreement}} issued by the nine-member economic committee of the EEC, which met in June 1980 in conjunction with Palestinian Liberation Organization (<b>PLO).</b> <b>The</b> declaration called for the acknowledgment of Palestinians’ right to self-government and <b>the</b> <b>PLO’s</b> right {{to be connected to}} peace initiatives.|$|R
5|$|In June 1970, Nasser {{accepted}} the US-sponsored Rogers Plan, {{which called for}} an end to hostilities and an Israeli withdrawal from Egyptian territory, but it was rejected by Israel, <b>the</b> <b>PLO,</b> and most Arab states except Jordan. Nasser had initially rejected the plan, but conceded under pressure from the Soviet Union, which feared that escalating regional conflict could drag it into a war with the US. He also determined that a ceasefire could serve as a tactical step toward the strategic goal of recapturing the Suez Canal. Nasser forestalled any movement toward direct negotiations with Israel. In dozens of speeches and statements, Nasser posited the equation that any direct peace talks with Israel were tantamount to surrender.|$|E
5|$|In September 1993, {{leaders of}} Israel and <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> signed the Oslo Accords calling for Palestinian {{administration}} of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, which was implemented in May 1994. Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza, leaving a new Palestinian National Authority (PNA) to administer and police the city. Led by Yasser Arafat, the PNA chose Gaza as its first provincial headquarters. The newly established Palestinian National Council held its inaugural session in Gaza in March 1996.|$|E
5|$|Israel retaliated against Egyptian {{shelling}} with commando raids, artillery shelling and air strikes. This {{resulted in}} an exodus of civilians from Egyptian cities along the Suez Canal's western bank. Nasser ceased all military activities and began a program to build a network of internal defenses, while receiving the financial backing of various Arab states. The war resumed in March 1969. In November, Nasser brokered an agreement between <b>the</b> <b>PLO</b> and the Lebanese military that granted Palestinian guerrillas {{the right to use}} Lebanese territory to attack Israel.|$|E
500|$|During the Black September clashes in Jordan, al-Wazir {{supplied}} the encircled Palestinian forces in Jerash and Ajlun with arms and aid, [...] but the conflict was decided in Jordan's favor. After Arafat {{and thousands of}} Fatah fighters retreated to Lebanon, al-Wazir negotiated an agreement between King Hussein and <b>the</b> <b>PLO's</b> leading organizer, calling for better Palestinian conduct in Jordan. Then, along with <b>the</b> other <b>PLO</b> leaders, he relocated to Beirut.|$|R
50|$|An early {{task of the}} UAC was the {{auditing}} of the Arab armies, {{in respect}} of strength and organisation, and, {{at the request of}} Hussein, King of Jordan, the command of <b>the</b> <b>PLO's</b> military operations.|$|R
5000|$|These people {{rejected}} the Soviet Union and Arab states {{close to it}} (The pro-Syrian Ba'ath, Algeria, Libya and South Yemen). They resented Yasser Arafat’s rapprochement with Moscow and <b>the</b> <b>PLO’s</b> progressive drift towards “third-worldist” leftwing rhetoric.|$|R
