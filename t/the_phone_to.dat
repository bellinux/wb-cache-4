5|$|With iOS 10.2.1, Apple made {{improvements}} to reduce occurrences of unexpected shutdowns {{that a small}} number of users were experiencing with their iPhone. iOS 10.2.1 already has over 50% of active iOS devices upgraded and the diagnostic data we've received from upgraders shows that for this small percentage of users experiencing the issue, we're seeing a more than 80% reduction in iPhone 6s and over 70% reduction on iPhone 6 of devices unexpectedly shutting down. We also added the ability for <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>to</b> restart without needing to connect to power, if a user still encounters an unexpected shutdown. It {{is important to note that}} these unexpected shutdowns are not a safety issue, but we understand it can be an inconvenience and wanted to fix the issue as quickly as possible.

When Susan arrives, Andy {{compliantly}} tells her that they have no openings, but Robert insists that they have a look around before coming to any conclusions. Susan looks at the different departments, and decides on accounting. Andy again claims the office is already fully staffed, but Robert insists that he give her a job, even pressuring Andy by reminding him of his power as CEO. Confused by Robert's mixed messages, Andy relents and gives her a job, but Robert later calls Andy on <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>to</b> berate him for hiring Susan.

In the parking lot, Andy apologizes to Susan and after brief small talk, Susan asks Andy out on a date, leaving him surprised.|$|E

Later versions expanded the rights management language to similar expressiveness as Fairplay, but did not become widely used.|$|E
25|$|An 18-hour {{standoff}} ensued {{during which}} time the police talked over <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>to</b> Bryant, still calling himself Jamie. He requested a helicopter, saying {{that he wanted to}} be flown to a plane and then on to Adelaide, South Australia. He said that if the helicopter arrived, he would release Pears and only keep Noelene Martin. Bryant could see the movements of SOG officers, and continually demanded their retreat each time they began to approach the house. As he appeared to have excellent awareness of the events unfurling around him, despite the pitch black of night, the police believed he had some kind of visual aid device; none was ever found, however. A man was spotted on the roof of an adjacent building at one point, believed to be Bryant. Later in the night, the cordless phone Bryant was using began to run low on batteries. Police tried unsuccessfully to get him to return <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>to</b> the charger, but it went dead and there were no further communications.|$|E

25|$|Using an {{emergency}} number recognized by a GSM phone like 112 instead of another emergency number may be advantageous, since GSM phones and networks give special priority to emergency calls. A phone dialing {{an emergency}} service number not recognized by it may refuse to roam onto another network, leading to trouble {{if there is}} no access to the home network. Dialing a known emergency number like 112 forces <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>to</b> try the call with any available network.|$|E

25|$|A key {{innovation}} {{required for}} the popularization of the BBS was the Hayes Smartmodem. Internal modems like the ones used by CBBS and similar early systems were usable, but generally expensive due to the manufacturer having to make a different modem for every computer platform they wanted to target. They were also limited to those computers with internal expansion, {{and could not be}} used with other useful platforms like video terminals. External modems were available for these platforms but required <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> <b>to</b> be dialed using a conventional handset, making them unable to accept incoming calls without manual intervention. Internal modems could be software controlled to perform both outbound and inbound calls, but external modems had only the data pins to communicate with the host system.|$|E

25|$|At the time, modems {{generally}} came in two versions, {{one for the}} end-user {{that required}} the user to dial the phone manually and use an acoustic coupler for connection, and another dedicated to answering incoming calls that was intended for use on the minicomputer or mainframe the user was calling into. The connection and disconnection was entirely manual, with the user picking up the phone's handset, dialing manually, and then pressing the handset into the coupler if a carrier frequency was heard.
