Here we seek to formulate a model combining microbiological and physicochemical variables to predict the H 2 oxidation rate (u) in soil. Soil sample replicates collected from a grassland and three forests exhibited different H 2 oxidation potentials. We examined the microbial community structure based on ribotyping analysis, the relative abundance of high affinity H 2 -oxidizing bacteria (HOB) estimated by qPCR and soil physicochemical characteristics as predictors for u. A single linear regression parameterized by <b>total</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>content</b> and a multiple linear regression using <b>total</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>content</b> and HOB relative abundance in soil explained 66 and 92 % of the variance in u, respectively. Microbial community composition based on 16 S rRNA gene pyrosequencing profiles was not a reliable predictor for u.

We confirmed this relationship of u with <b>total</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>content</b> and HOB by an independent soil survey of 14 samples collected from maize monocultures, grasslands, deciduous forests and larch plantations.

40|$|Graduation date: 1980 Sedimentation rate {{could become}} a new {{exploration}} tool for evaluating the source rock potential of sedimentary basins in frontier regions. Petroleum source rocks are defined {{on the basis of}} <b>total</b> organic <b>carbon</b> by weight percent. An analysis of Deep Sea Drilling Project (DSDP) cores indicates that there exists quantitative relationships between sedimentation rate and <b>total</b> organic <b>carbon</b> <b>content</b> in fine grained ancient marine sediments of Jurassic, Cretaceous and Cenezoic age. These relationships are independent of geographic setting, geologic age, and differential compaction, but are highly dependent upon lithology. For any given sedimentation rate, the <b>total</b> organic <b>carbon</b> <b>content</b> increases from calcareous to siliceous to black shale sediments. For each of these lithologies, the <b>total</b> organic <b>carbon</b> <b>content</b> increases with sedimentation rate due to reduced aerobic microbial degradation at higher burial rates. Above a critical sedimentation rate, the <b>total</b> organic <b>carbon</b> <b>content</b> may decrease with increasing sedimentation rate due to a clastic dilution effect. Aerobic microbial degradation, however, continues to be less efficient at higher burial rates. Therefore, even though the <b>total</b> organic <b>carbon</b> <b>content</b> may decrease, the quality of the organic matter preserved and the oil generation and oil migration potential of the sediment may continue to increase with increasing sedimentation rate. Similar relationships have also been established between <b>total</b> organic <b>carbon</b> and grain accumulation rate, and <b>total</b> organic <b>carbon</b> accumulation rate and grain accumulation rate. These relationships support both reduced aerobic microbial degradation and the clastic dilution effect. In the latter case, the lithologic control is less pronounced, and the relationship can be used to determine <b>total</b> organic <b>carbon</b> <b>content</b> even when the lithology is not known. The results of this study have important implications for petroleum exploration in frontier regions. Sedimentation rate and grain accumulation rate could be determined from seismic isopach and velocity data. When the lithology is not known, such as prior to exploration drilling, grain accumulation rates could be used to estimate the <b>total</b> organic <b>carbon</b> <b>content,</b> and the oil generation and oil migration potential of a sedimentary basin.

40|$|Soil carbon {{stocks are}} highly {{vulnerable}} to human activities (such as tillage), which can decrease carbon stocks significantly. These activities break down soil’s organic matter and some carbon {{is converted to}} carbon dioxide (CO 2). A part of CO 2 (a greenhouse gas {{that is one of}} the main contributor to global warming) is lost from the soil by soil respiration (soil CO 2 efflux). The aim of our study is to determine the soil carbon loss by soil CO 2 efflux under different tillage treatments. The experimental site is characterized by continental climate. Field experiment with six different tillage treatments usually used in this area was set up on Stagnic Luvisols in Daruvar, central lowland Croatia in 1994 with investigation aim on determination of soil degradation by water erosion and later, in 2011, expanded to the research on soil CO 2 efflux. Tillage treatments differed in tools that were used, depth and direction of tillage. Tillage treatments were: black fallow (BF), ploughing up/down the slope to 30 cm (PUDS), no-tillage (NT), ploughing across the slope to 30 cm (PAS), very deep ploughing across the slope to 50 cm (VDPAS) and subsoiling (50 cm) plus ploughing (30 cm) across the slope (SSPAS). Field measurements of soil CO 2 concentrations were conducted during one year (n = 14) from November 2011 till November 2012, when cover crop was corn (Zea mays L.). Preliminary soil sampling for determination of soil <b>total</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>content</b> was conducted in April 2011. This paper presents results of soil <b>total</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>content</b> in the soil surface layer (0 - 30 cm), the variations of CO 2 -C efflux during the year, soil carbon loss by CO 2 -C efflux and correlation between soil <b>total</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>content</b> and CO 2 -C efflux. The range of soil surface <b>total</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>content</b> varied from 19083. 7 kg/ha at BF treatment up to 31073. 6 kg/ha at SSPAS treatment. The treatment with the lowest average measured CO 2 -C efflux was BF. The average CO 2 -C efflux at BF treatment was 7. 9 kg CO 2 -C/ha/day where CO 2 -C efflux varied from 2. 3 kg CO 2 -C/ha/day up to 22. 6 kg CO 2 -C/ha/day. The treatment with the highest average measured CO 2 -C efflux was NT. Range of CO 2 -C efflux at NT treatment varied from 7. 8 kg CO 2 -C/ha/day up to 65. 8 kg CO 2 -C/ha/day and the average CO 2 -C efflux was 24. 4 kg CO 2 -C/ha/day.
