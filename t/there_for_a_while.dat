25|$|After {{the first}} ascent of Mt Kenya {{there were fewer}} expeditions <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> The {{majority}} of the exploration until after the First World War was by settlers in Kenya, who were not on scientific expeditions. A Church of Scotland mission {{was set up in}} Chogoria, and several Scottish missionaries ascended to the peaks, including Rev Dr. J. W. Arthur, G. Dennis and A. R. Barlow. There were other ascents, but none succeeded in summitting Batian or Nelion.|$|E
25|$|The last {{objective}} was the castle {{just above the}} harbour where fire was concentrated with Vickers machine guns and mortars opening up on the battlements. While crossing a bridge SBS men became pinned down and had to stay <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> Fighting was bitter {{and the majority of}} the casualties were taken in this area, but mortar fire was concentrated on the castle. A captured German officer and a Royal naval Lieutenant seconded to the SBS called out for the castle to surrender and after three hours of further fighting an Italian Carabinieri unit walked out and surrendered.|$|E
25|$|As {{suddenly}} as they appeared, the tourists vanish. The fugitive {{returns to the}} museum to investigate and finds no evidence of people being there during his absence. He attributes the experience to a hallucination caused by food poisoning, but the tourists reappear that night. They {{have come out of}} nowhere and yet they talk as if they have been <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> He watches them closely while still avoiding direct contact and notices more strange things. In the aquarium he encounters identical copies of the dead fish he found on his day of arrival. During a day at the pool, he sees the tourists jump to shake off the cold when the heat is unbearable. The strangest thing he notices is the presence of two suns and two moons in the sky.|$|E

25|$|In 1495, the Alcaidaria-mor (similar to the Spanish alcalde) of {{the castle}} {{was given to the}} Captain-major of Angra, who lived <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> Later, it would become the {{residence}} of his trusted lieutenant, who was paid a stipend and obliged to take-up residence. Eventually the castle's Alcaidaria-mor was integrated into Captaincy of Angra, when it began {{to be known as the}} Castle of São Cristóvão (1582). It was during the reigns of King John III (1521–1557) and King Sebastian (1568–1578) that the first defensive plans were drawn-up by military engineer Tommaso Benedetto (in 1567). The Italian architect engineer concentrated on a global defense plan for the main islands of the Azores, concentrating the defenses at the ports and anchorages. Consequently, the old castle/fort served little use, and his successor, Ciprião de Figueiredo e Vasconcelos, doubled his efforts with fifty defensive works along the coast of the island. Its strategic role further degenerated, with many of its dependencies used to store gunpowder for Angra, transferred from the Praça Velha for security reasons. Father António Cordeiro (1641-1722), wrote {{of the castle}}'s ruins in his História Insulana, identifying that only the walls remained of the structure, which was also identified by Father Maldonando. The small medieval fort, therefore, was slowly substituted by the coastal defenses of the Fort of São Sebastião and Fort of Santo António, with the latter strategically located at the edge of Monte Brasil (and which created a crossfire zone with the first, to secure the bay).|$|E
500|$|While the Mets had {{appeared}} uncertain whether Davis {{could handle the}} pressure of the major leagues as spring training ended, by mid-May—just a month after calling him up to the majors—they moved him to the cleanup spot in the batting order.

500|$|After a Week 8 bye, Hester caught four {{passes for}} 42 yards {{and had an}} 11-yard run against the Detroit Lions. He {{eventually}} lost his kick return duties to Danieal Manning, but began receiving more playing time as a wide receiver. Between Week 12 and 15, Hester caught 17 passes for 250 yards and one touchdown. David Haugh of the Chicago Tribune regarded Hester as the team's [...] "biggest threat in the passing game." [...] He concluded the season by catching 51 passes for a team high 665 yards. Unlike his previous two seasons in the NFL, Hester did not record a single touchdown return and only averaged 6.2 yards per punt return. Lovie Smith commented on Hester {{at the end of}} the season by saying, [...] "I know his returns dropped off a little bit this year, but his plate was full <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> We think we have a happy medium now for him as a punt returner and continuing to develop as a receiver." [...] Hester was also selected to play in the 2009 Pro Bowl as a third alternate.|$|E

2500|$|Nicopolis {{was a city}} in the Roman {{province}} of Epirus Vetus, today a ruin on {{the northern part of}} the western Greek coast.

2500|$|About {{adjusting}} to the NFL, Ringer said [...] "It's definitely {{a lot more complicated}} than in college, definitely. But mainly it's just the play calling, it's a lot longer than what it was in college, but all-in-all it's just learning a whole new terminology, some things are similar, but it's the words that they use are different. So it's all about adjustment. A lot of intelligence out there, they don't make mistakes. They are pretty mature on what they are doing. I am trying to build up to that, because {{a lot of them are}} veterans and have been <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> They understand what is going on, and I am just trying to keep up and not make them look bad." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1945, {{shortly after}} {{completing}} his first three-year retreat, {{he went to}} see Dzongsar Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö.

By 1946 he entered his second three-year retreat, this time {{under the guidance of}} the Tromge Trungpa Rinpoche. Near the conclusion of this retreat, the death of Tromge Trungpa forced him to leave before its completion. He then returned to Chagdud Gompa in Nyagrong, and after staying <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> proceeded on a pilgrimage to Lhasa with an entourage of monks. He then did an extended retreat at Samye, the monastery built by Padmasambhava, and afterwards attended empowerments given by Dudjom Jigdral Yeshe Dorje, who would become a main teacher as well as a source of spiritual inspiration for him.|$|E
2500|$|The first part, [...] "The Thieving Magpie", {{begins with}} Toru Okada, a low-key {{unemployed}} man, who is tasked by his wife, Kumiko, {{to find their}} missing cat. Kumiko suggests starting by looking in the alley, a closed-off strip of land existing behind their house. After Toru has hung out <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> with no luck, May Kasahara, who had been watching him camping out the alley for some time, questions him. She then invites him over to her house in order {{to sit on the}} patio and look over an abandoned house that she says is a popular hangout for stray cats. The abandoned house is revealed to possibly contain some strange omen, as it had brought bad luck to all of its prior tenants. It also contains an empty well, which Toru uses later on to crawl into and think.|$|E
2500|$|And I {{passed a}} house, {{and there was}} a woman, and I {{remember}} that she was a little tongue-tied, sitting on a step. And she saw what was happening, and she called me in. And she spent about 20 minutes treating me like an adult, teaching me how - of course the ends were gone off the shoestrings - to twist the end and put it through the hole. Then we laced and unlaced my shoes three or four times until I knew how to do it, and then she taught me how to tie a knot. And we sat <b>there</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> and then I went along. And, as little as I was, I thought, [...] "I'd like to be like that kind of person. I'd like to be like her."
