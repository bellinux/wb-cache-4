40|$|In {{this study}} the {{relationship}} between the distribution of income, fertility and mortality is examined in order to evaluate the role that income inequality plays in the demographic transition. It is argued that in developing nations at low levels of income there is a negative association between income inequality and fertility. In these nations, equalising <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> will support higher levels of fertility. In higher income developing nations, the opposite will hold and the association between income inequality and fertility is positive. In these nations, equalising <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> will support lower levels of fertility. With respect to mortality it is argued that {{the relationship between}} income inequality and mortality is positive. Therefore, equalising <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>income</b> will support lower levels of mortality.

40|$|Abstract. Gary Becker’s classic 1968 paper {{demonstrates}} that fines dominate expenditures on detection {{as a means}} of controlling illegal activities, because fines represent socially-costless <b>transfers</b> <b>of</b> <b>income.</b> As a result, fines should be set at their maximal levels. Subsequent research has produced several exceptions to this rule, but they involve significant departures from Becker’s framework. We use a model that is consistent with this framework (risk-neutral agents and only one type and level of “crime”) to demonstrate that it may be optimal to set fines below their maximal levels. The novel feature of our model is that sufficiently high fines interfere with prior commitments made by offenders to compensate other private agents (e. g., debt). In some cases, fines should be low enough to leave offenders with positive assets after honoring all such commitments...|$|E
