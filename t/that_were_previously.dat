5|$|All {{specimens}} discovered until 1967 were in coarse-grained sandstone {{that prevented}} preservation of fine details, making interpretation difficult. S.B.

5|$|As {{described}} above, John Scannella {{had argued}} in 2010 that Nedoceratops {{should be considered}} a synonym of Triceratops. Andrew Farke (2011) maintained that it represents a valid distinct genus. Nick Longrich agreed with Scannella about Nedoceratops and made a further suggestion: that the recently described Ojoceratops was likewise a synonym. The fossils, he argued, are indistinguishable from the T. horridus specimens <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>previously</b> attributed to the defunct species T. serratus.|$|E
5|$|Carex binervis has an oceanic distribution, {{occurring}} only {{in areas}} of high rainfall, from Finland and Norway, through the British Isles, Germany, Belgium and France, to Spain and Portugal.

Plants from Morocco <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>previously</b> referred to C.binervis are now treated as a separate species, C.paulo-vargasii.|$|E

5|$|There are {{a number}} of sites <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>previously</b> listed as being in danger, but they were later removed from the list after {{improvements}} in management and conservation.

5|$|Although many Lilium {{species such}} as Lilium martagon and Lilium candidum can be {{obtained}} commercially, the majority of commercially available lilies represent the products of a very diverse hybridisation program, which {{has resulted in a}} separate horticultural classification, including such groupings as Asian, Oriental and Orienpet. In addition to a very wide variety of heights, lilies can be obtained in many colours and combinations of colours, and if properly selected can produce an extensive blooming season from early summer to autumn. Because of the history of Liliaceae, many {{species such as}} Watsonia (bugle lily) <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>previously</b> classified in this family bear the name 'lily' but are neither part of the genus Lilium, or the Liliaceae family.|$|E
5|$|Banjo and Kazooie are {{occasionally}} {{aided by}} their friend Mumbo Jumbo, a shaman who can use magical powers to transform them into several creatures like a termite, a pumpkin, a bee, a walrus, and a crocodile. These transformations {{have their own}} special features and allow the player to access areas <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>previously</b> inaccessible. For instance, the walrus can resist the effects of icy-cold water. Mumbo Tokens that are scattered throughout the game allow the transformation process. The game also includes cheats that the player can unlock by finding Gruntilda's spellbook, Cheato.|$|E

The participating nations all had ageing fleets that required replacing; but, as the requirements were so diverse, {{it was decided to}} develop a single aircraft that could perform a variety of missions <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>previously</b> undertaken by a fleet of different aircraft. Britain joined the MRCA group in 1968, represented by Air Vice-Marshal Michael Giddings, and a memorandum of agreement was drafted between Britain, West Germany, and Italy in May 1969.|$|E
5|$|Not all {{software}} {{states are}} vulnerable to rowhammer attacks. An attacker thus needs to find right target states in order to utilize rowhammer errors. In practice, {{one of the main}} challenges is in identifying target states. Such typically have been done by domain experts. The mainstream fault tolerance community responded to rowhammer attacks with a systematic methodology which can be used to identify, validate, and evaluate rowhammer attack target states and their exploitability. That work is based on the well-established fault injection-based experimental methodology, and generalized attack target states and found a few practical target states <b>that</b> <b>were</b> <b>previously</b> unknown.|$|E

From 1942 to 1967, the Cup was competed for by the league's six teams, {{also known as the}} Original Six. After the 1967 NHL Expansion, the Stanley Cup was competed for by the winners of each conference. Since 1982, the Finals have been played between the league's conference playoff champions.|$|E
