5|$|In this stage, it is {{necessary}} to inquire into, firstly, <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> the statute, and secondly, whether the basis of differentiation against or for a particular class is a reasonable means of achieving such an object. The essence of the test is whether it is reasonable, taking into consideration <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> the statute, to distinguish between persons on the selected basis of differentiation. As such, it {{is necessary}} to ask how the differentiation against or for one particular class furthers <b>the</b> <b>object</b> <b>of</b> the statute. The law is not arbitrary if the basis for discrimination has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved, and the statute will be declared valid and constitutional.|$|E

40|$|When a {{data set}} {{contains}} <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> multiple types, to cluster <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> one type, {{it is often}} necessary to consider the cluster structure on <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other types. Co-clustering <b>the</b> related <b>objects</b> often generates better clusters. One basic connection {{here is that the}} similarity among <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> one type is often affected by the cluster structures on <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other types. Although many co-clustering schemes have been proposed, none has explicitly explored such a connection. We propose a framework that utilizes this connection directly. In this framework, employing a spectral-embeddingbased approach, we first obtain certain approximate cluster information about <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> individual types. Such information is then used to refine the similarity measures for <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> related types. The final clustering is performed with the refined similarity. We tested our framework on both bipartite-graph and document clustering. Our experiments showed that the refined similarity leads to much better clustering, indicating that our refinement makes the similarity measures closer to their true values. ...|$|R
40|$|The paper proposes an {{analysis}} of the Bretanian conception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> sensations and a review of the neo-Brentanian literature on this theme. Starting from the Brentanian thesis that all mental phenomena are intentional, it intends to analyze if <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> sensations would have the same intentional property. This is also an issue on the meaning and <b>the</b> home <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> sensations. From <b>the</b> analysis of the Brentanian thesis, in parallel, the paper seeks to identify the extent and the limit of a representationalist perspective in Philosophy of Mind. Finally, it indicates a form of adverbialism as a possible alternative to a representationalist view on <b>the</b> <b>objects</b> <b>of</b> sensations...|$|R
