50|$|As well {{as being}} a key muscle and tendon for stabilization, <b>the</b> tibialis <b>posterior</b> also {{contracts}} to produce inversion and assists in the plantar flexion of the foot at the ankle. <b>The</b> tibialis <b>posterior</b> has {{a major role in}} supporting the medial arch of the foot. Dysfunction of <b>the</b> tibialis <b>posterior,</b> including rupture of <b>the</b> tibialis <b>posterior</b> tendon, can lead to flat feet in adults, as well as a valgus deformity due to unopposed eversion when inversion is lost.|$|R

5|$|The {{pituitary}} gland {{is located at}} the base of the brain, and intimately connected with the hypothalamus.

5|$|The third {{axillary}} sclerite (3Ax) lies in <b>the</b> <b>posterior</b> {{part of the}} articular {{region of}} the wing. Its form is highly variable and often irregular, but the third axillary is the sclerite on which is inserted the flexor muscle of the wing (D). Mesally it articulates anteriorly (f) with <b>the</b> <b>posterior</b> {{end of the second}} axillary, and posteriorly (b) with <b>the</b> <b>posterior</b> wing process of the tergum (PNP), or with a small fourth axillary when the latter is present. Distally the third axillary is prolonged in a process which is always associated with the bases of the group of veins in the anal region of the wing here termed the vannal veins (V). The third axillary, therefore, is usually <b>the</b> <b>posterior</b> hinge plate of the wing base and is the active sclerite of the flexor mechanism, which directly manipulates the vannal veins. The contraction of the flexor muscle (D) revolves the third axillary on its mesal articulations (b, f) and thereby lifts its distal arm; this movement produces the flexion of the wing. The Fourth Axillary sclerite is not a constant element of the wing base. When present it is usually a small plate intervening between the third axillary and <b>the</b> <b>posterior</b> notal wing process and is probably a detached piece of the latter.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>posterior</b> {{angle of}} the wing base in some Diptera there {{is a pair of}} {{membranous}} lobes (squamae, or calypteres) known as the alula. The alula is well developed in the house fly. The outer squama (c) arises from the wing base behind the third axillary sclerite (3Ax) and evidently represents the jugal lobe of other insects (A, D); the larger inner squama (d) arises from <b>the</b> <b>posterior</b> scutellar margin of the tergum of the wing-bearing segment and forms a protective, hoodlike canopy over the halter. In the flexed wing the outer squama of the alula is turned upside down above the inner squama, the latter not being affected by the movement of the wing. In many Diptera a deep incision of the anal area of the wing membrane behind the single vannal vein sets off a proximal alar lobe distal to the outer squama of the alula.|$|E

5|$|Such a {{cascading}} regulatory {{network has}} been studied in detail {{in the development of}} the fruit fly embryo. The young embryo is oval in shape, like a rugby ball. A small number of genes produce messenger RNAs that set up concentration gradients along the long axis of the embryo. In the early embryo, the bicoid and hunchback genes are at high concentration near the anterior end, and give pattern to the future head and thorax; the caudal and nanos genes are at high concentration near <b>the</b> <b>posterior</b> end, and give pattern to the hindmost abdominal segments. The effects of these genes interact; for instance, the Bicoid protein blocks the translation of caudals messenger RNA, so the Caudal protein concentration becomes low at the anterior end. Caudal later switches on genes which create the fly's hindmost segments, but only at <b>the</b> <b>posterior</b> end where it is most concentrated.|$|E

40|$|Introduction <b>The</b> Polya <b>posterior</b> is a noninformative Bayesian {{procedure}} {{which can}} be used when little or no prior information is available. <b>The</b> Polya <b>posterior</b> is related to the Bayesian bootstrap of Rubin (1981). See also Lo (1988). One advantage of <b>the</b> Polya <b>posterior</b> is that it has a stepwise Bayes justification and leads to admissible procedures. For further discussion of <b>the</b> Polya <b>posterior</b> see Ghosh and Meeden (1997). In this note we will show how <b>the</b> Polya <b>posterior</b> can be adapted to two-stage cluster sampling. We will consider the simple case where there are N clusters or primary sampling units. Each cluster consists of M subunits or second stage sampling units. We assume that first a random sample without replacement of n clusters are selected from the N clusters. Then within each selected cluster a random sample without replacement of m subunits is chosen.

50|$|Another {{study using}} fMRI {{showed that the}} parts of the brain {{responding}} to puns and semantic-based jokes which participants found amusing were different. In response to puns, <b>the</b> left <b>posterior</b> middle temporal gyrus and the left inferior frontal gyrus were activated. When listening to semantic jokes, <b>the</b> left <b>posterior</b> middle temporal gyrus was again activated, and so were <b>the</b> left <b>posterior</b> inferior temporal gyrus, <b>the</b> right <b>posterior</b> middle temporal gyrus, and the cerebellum. Interestingly, brain activity in the medial ventral prefrontal cortex was associated with ratings of funniness which the participants gave after the brain scan and initial humor response. This response may be stemming from the mood or emotional change which occurs after hearing humor.|$|R
5|$|The main {{muscular system}} in {{bivalves}} is <b>the</b> <b>posterior</b> and anterior adductor muscles, although the anterior muscles {{may be reduced}} or even lost in some species. These strong muscles connect the two valves and contract to close the shell. They work {{in opposition to the}} ligament which tends to pull the valves apart. In sedentary or recumbent bivalves that lie on one valve, such as the oysters and scallops, the anterior adductor muscle has been lost and <b>the</b> <b>posterior</b> muscle is positioned centrally. In file shells that can swim by flapping their valves, a single, central adductor muscle occurs. These muscles are composed of two types of muscle fibres, striated muscle bundles for fast actions and smooth muscle bundles for maintaining a steady pull.|$|E

50|$|The left bundle {{branch is}} short, {{splitting}} {{into the left}} anterior fascicle and <b>the</b> left <b>posterior</b> fascicle. <b>The</b> left <b>posterior</b> fascicle is relatively short and broad, with dual blood supply, making it particularly resistant to ischemic damage. <b>The</b> left <b>posterior</b> fascicle transmits impulses to the papillary muscles, leading to mitral valve closure. As <b>the</b> left <b>posterior</b> fascicle is shorter and broader than the right, impulses reach the papillary muscles just prior to depolarization, and therefore contraction, of the left ventricle myocardium. This allows pre-tensioning of the chordae tendinae, increasing the resistance to flow through the mitral valve during left ventricular contraction. This mechanism works {{in the same manner}} as pre-tensioning of car seatbelts.|$|R
