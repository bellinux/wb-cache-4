5000|$|The now-defunct refinery, {{the second}} owned by Shell in Canada, opened on 24 March 1933. It began with three units; the {{distillation}} unit, a <b>topping</b> <b>unit,</b> and cracking catalytic unit. In 1947 it was expanded {{with the building}} of the alkylation and catalytic cracking refining units, and the refining capacity of was increased. From 1947 to 1960, the isomerisation, catalytic reforming, chemicals plants were built and the refining capacity was further increased. During 2002 to 2008, desulphuration units were built and the refining capacity was upgraded to its highest level [...]|$|E
40|$|Abstract Flame and {{effective}} gas temperatures are key variables {{that need to}} be accurately determined before analysis of heat transfer in the radiant section of fired heaters can be meaningfully undertaken. To facilitate the calculation of these temperatures, appropriate equations were derived using two Computer Matlab programmes specially written for the purpose. A third programme was also written for the solution of the derived equations using the Newton-Raphson method. The whole calculation procedure was illustrated by an example worked out for an actual process heater used in a crude oil <b>topping</b> <b>unit...</b>|$|E
30|$|The Prudhoe Bay Crude Oil <b>Topping</b> <b>Unit</b> (COTU), {{owned and}} {{operated}} by ConocoPhillips Alaska Inc., maintained 16, 000 bpsd (15, 000 bpd) distillation capacity in 2014 to provide arctic heating fuel (AHF) for the Endicott/Badami field operations in the North Slope of Alaska. The COTU consists entirely of two parallel atmospheric distillation towers. Each plant heats the crude to approximately 550  °F and distills off the AHF fraction. The AHF is sent to storage tanks for use, and the remaining fluids are recombined and re-injected back into the oil transfer line. Each plant is capable of processing approximately 7000 – 8000 bpd of crude with production of 1200 – 1400 bpd of AHF. Production of Jet A is done on a periodic batch basis. AHF and Jet A are the only products of the unit and all production is consumed on site.|$|E

The Zawia refinery is supplied with associated units for utility needs like power, steam production via boilers, desalination units, air compressors and a tankfarm for storing crude oil, intermediate and finished products. Two atmospheric distillation plants can process almost all Libyan crude oil and produce naphtha, kerosene light and heavy gas oil and fuel oil. The Crude Distillation unit has a desalter, which removes/decrease salt content to acceptable levels both <b>topping</b> <b>units</b> have stabilizers to remove lighter gases which is diverted to the fuel gas system.|$|R

40|$|Energy retrofit. Heat {{exchanger}} networks. Crude fractionation units This paper {{presents the}} results obtained in the energy retrofit of a Crude <b>Topping</b> <b>Unit.</b> An optimization procedure to explore energy retrofit alternatives that combines changes in operating conditions and pinch analysis is used. Five savings horizons are obtained for {{the different types of}} crude studied. In the first stage of the method, a potential savings horizon (maximum possible savings) of approximately $ 1. 5 million dollars per year is identified. A subsequent economic analysis identifies a retrofit opportunity with a payout of 1. 2 years. The savings are around $ 0. 7 million dollars (47 % of its savings horizon) for this case. Finally, additional savings are identified when the reallocation of the returns of the pump-around circuits is considered. These savings bring down the payout period to 1. 1 years. Over a five years horizon, the net revenue (total savings over 5 years- capital expenditure) is in the order of $ 3. 2 millions of dollar...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{research}} {{problem of the}} paper concerned verification whether applicable or known methods of post-harvesting evaluation of the roots of sugar beet may {{be applied to the}} assessment of the quality of work of technically varied new machinery for sugar beet har-vesting. Tests of machines of varied solutions of working units, in particular a <b>topping</b> <b>unit,</b> were carried out in order to accomplish the objective of the paper. Two self-propelled combine harvesters of Ropa euro-Tiger V 8 - 3 type and Kleine Beetliner Large and two sets for 2 -stage harvesting by M. A. C. E (Spain) and Amity (USA) companies were used in the study. Ropa euro-Tiger and Kleine Beetliner Large combine harvesters and M. A. C. E. set were equipped with a beet topper but of a varied topping system, whereas, only a defoliator was used in the set by Amity company. Field research of machines included assessment of the topping quality, losses caused by the broken tip of roots and damages of the lateral surface of roots. Research assumptions were assumed according to the method of the International In-stitute for Beet Research (I. I. R. B.). Moreover, assessment of the topping quality with the method of the Netherlands Institute of Sugar Beet Research (IRS) and the Institute of Agri-cultural Engineering of the Bonn University was carried out. Assessment of roots after defo-liation was carried out based on the Roller's classification (2010). Based on the research re-sults and analyses which were carried out, it was proved that the methods of measurement of the quality of beet harvesting machines operation are not fully useful for assessment of the introduced technical and technological changes. It mainly concerns the assessment of the roots topping. Thus, two modified methods of assessment of the quality of roots topping were suggested. They may be used both for machines equipped with a topping device and a defo-liator. Key words: harvesting sugar beet, topping, defoliation, quality of root...|$|E

Fortunes reversed in 1996 and with millions of dollars tied up in development of the game, Tender Loving Care, Trilobyte found itself running very low on finances by mid-1996. In light of this, the decision was made that a third member of the 7th Guest series should be released to generate much-needed funds.|$|R
