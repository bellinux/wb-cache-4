5|$|<b>The</b> <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> {{permitted}} by the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway Act, 1906 on 4 August 1906, but the south-east alignment {{did not represent}} a suitable direction to continue the railway and no {{effort was made to}} construct the extension.|$|E
5|$|Analysis {{of the two}} {{combat system}} {{proposals}} saw Signaal fall out of favour with the tender reviewers. This was primarily attributed to a cost-reducing re-design late in the process: <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> not fully documented because of time constraints. Supporting documentation was further criticised by the reviewers for being vaguely worded and not using milspec terminology and standards. In addition, the system proposed by Rockwell appeared to have greater performance capabilities, and would be cheaper to implement.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, an Australian Division of the East Indies Station was {{established}}, and in 1859 the British Admiralty {{established an}} independent command, the Australia Station, {{under the command}} of a Commodore who was assigned as Commander-in-Chief, Australia Station. The Australian Squadron was created to which British naval ships serving on the Australia Station were assigned. <b>The</b> <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> partially in recognition of the fact that {{a large part of the}} East Indies Station had been detached to Australian waters, and also reflecting growing concern for the strategic situation in the western Pacific in general, and in Tahiti and New Zealand in particular. In 1884, the commander of the Australia Station was upgraded to the rank of Rear Admiral.|$|E

5|$|In 1999, then-President Hugo Sonnenschein {{announced}} plans to relax the university's famed core curriculum, {{reducing the number of}} required courses from 21 to 15. When The New York Times, The Economist, and other major news outlets picked up this story, the university became the focal point of a national debate on education. <b>The</b> <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> ultimately implemented, but the controversy played a role in Sonnenschein's decision to resign in 2000.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) {{officials}} announced their long-term plan {{to prevent further}} traffic jams. They will create a series of loops and overpasses allowing traffic to go directly from southbound Route32 to the Thruway and remove some traffic lights {{in front of the}} mall. <b>The</b> <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> expected to be complete by 2011, as part of improvements to convert the Route17 expressway into I-86. However, in 2009 they were postponed due to funding constraints. Work was slated to begin in 2013, but just before it could start Governor Andrew Cuomo redirected the money to repair projects elsewhere in the state. The project was put on indefinite hold in 2014 until it could be funded.|$|E
5|$|In May 2000 the Whitbread Beer Company was {{acquired}} by the Belgian brewer Interbrew, which owned Stella Artois. At that time one in eight barrels of Boddingtons was exported to some 40 countries worldwide, including China, the United States, Taiwan and the West Indies. The Strangeways Brewery kegging facility closed in February 2003 {{with the loss of}} 50 jobs. In August 2003, amidst falling sales, Interbrew relaunched the cask product in the North West of England, with an increased strength. The relaunch was unsuccessful and <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> reversed.|$|E

5|$|In November 1982, Bahrain {{became the}} first customer. South Korea also {{explored}} local production of the F-20, and in support improvements were implemented. These included avionics upgrades, an expanded fuel tank, {{and the use of}} fibreglass composites. <b>The</b> <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> so extensive that a fourth prototype was built to test them. By 1983, Northrop was involved in a number of simultaneous negotiations for the F-20, and its prospects appeared positive.|$|E
5|$|Modi also relaxed or {{abolished}} {{a number}} of other environmental regulations, particularly those related to industrial activity. A government committee stated that the existing system only served to create corruption, and that the government should instead rely on the owners of industries to voluntarily inform the government about the pollution they were creating. Other changes included reducing ministry oversight on small mining projects, and no longer requiring approval from tribal councils for projects inside forested areas. In addition, Modi lifted a moratorium on new industrial activity in the most polluted areas in the countries. <b>The</b> <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> welcomed by businesspeople, but criticised by environmentalists.|$|E
5|$|On March 9, 2006, a {{revision}} of the USA PATRIOT Act was signed into law. It amended the process for interim appointments of U.S. Attorneys, a clause Specter wrote during his chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The change allowed the Bush Administration to appoint interim U.S. attorneys without term limits, and without confirmation by the Senate. The Bush administration used the law to place at least eight interim attorneys into office in 2006. Specter claimed that <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> added by staff member Brett Tolman.

5|$|Response to {{the reforms}} was mixed. The {{religious}} houses {{had been the}} only support of the impoverished, and the reforms alienated much of the population outside London, helping to provoke the great northern rising of 1536–1537, known as the Pilgrimage of Grace. Elsewhere <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> accepted and welcomed, and those who clung to Catholic rites kept quiet or moved in secrecy. They would re-emerge during the reign of Henry's daughter Mary (1553–1558).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> {{met with}} {{critical}} reception in the province. Many students are now {{required to pay}} higher sports fees to cover higher transportation costs. Some schools {{do not have access}} to approved vehicles because the Education Act prohibits schools and school districts from owning vehicles. To get around this they use corporate entities to operate vehicles for extracurricular activities. These require money to buy new vehicles and the required insurance, which often requires schools to conduct extra fundraising.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} to generally positive reviews, with critics praising its gameplay and sprite animation quality. While the Sega Saturn port received praise {{for maintaining the}} experience of the original arcade version, the PlayStation port was met with mixed to negative critical reception for removing several features, such as tag team battles. <b>The</b> <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> done in response to the technical limitations of the PlayStation.

5|$|The {{government}} {{believed that}} <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> needed {{because of the}} collapse in unskilled jobs in the economy, which means that young school leavers at 16 years of age are finding it increasingly more difficult to find employment, consequentially in many cases making them unemployable. Within the last 40 years, the number of unskilled jobs available have more than halved, from 8 million in the 1960s to 3.5 by 2007, with predictions of further drops to just 600,000 by 2020 due to the increasing demand for skilled labour. This, together with fewer students continuing their further education, increase the difficulty for young school leavers to find work if they were either not able, or chose not to, stay on at school and complete further education.|$|E

5|$|The touch was {{originally}} meant to cure tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis (commonly {{referred to as}} scrofula or the King's Evil), rheumatism, convulsions, fevers, blindness, goitre and other ailments. Since the reign of Elizabeth I (r. 1558–1603), however, the touch was applied only to people suffering from scrofula. The Henrician practice was rarely modified, and <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> minor; Elizabeth I {{made the sign of}} the cross above the infected person's head, while her squeamish successor, James I (r. 1603–1625), made stroking motions above the abscesses instead of actually touching them.|$|E

5|$|Though the {{original}} release of God of War III {{was met with}} critical acclaim, God of War III Remastered only garnered generally favorable reviews, receiving aggregate scores of 80.37% and 81 out of 100 from GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively. Reviewers found it odd that Sony decided to remaster God of War III for PlayStation 4, as its story picks up immediately from the ending of God of War II, which may confuse newcomers who have never played the previous games. Praise {{was given to the}} smoother textures and improved frame rate, though because {{the original}} already had impressive graphics, <b>the</b> <b>changes</b> <b>were</b> not major, and reviewers said these changes were not a strong enough argument to rebuy the game for $40 USD.|$|E
