40|$|Abstract. Polycrystalline diamond, (PCD) is {{currently}} {{used in the}} industry for cutting tools of difficult-to-machine materials because of its superior characteristics such as hardness, toughness and wear resistance. But the PCD material is difficult to machine due to its above properties. Before making the PCD blank in varies tools, <b>the</b> <b>lapping</b> process is essential and necessary. <b>The</b> <b>lapping</b> quality depends heavily on the parameters. Therefore it is of great significance to study the path and velocity of lapping process for ensuring <b>the</b> <b>lapping</b> quality and uniform wear of abrasive disk. In this paper, {{on the basis of}} kinematics and geometry principle, the path equation was established. <b>The</b> complicated <b>lapping</b> process can be converted into two rotation movements, i. e. the movement of part against <b>the</b> center of <b>lapping</b> disk and rotation of fixture around its center. The relative path and relative velocity of random point of the part against abrasive disk were also analyzed and calculated. The computer simulation software was developed for figuring the path curves and instantaneous velocity of <b>the</b> <b>lapping</b> process. <b>The</b> results show that the abrasive disk can wear uniformly and <b>the</b> <b>lapping</b> quality can be raised. The application of computer simulation software provides the possibility to analyze <b>the</b> <b>lapping</b> principles, which is a simple, convenient and effective method...|$|R
40|$|HIPed (Hot Isostatically Pressed) {{silicon nitride}} ball blanks were lapped from {{diameter}} 13. 255 mm to diameter 12. 7 mm by a novel eccentric lapping machine. A maximum {{material removal rate}} of 68 μm/hour has been achieved under a nominal lapping load of 43 N/ball. It {{was found that the}} material removal rate was increasing almost linearly with <b>the</b> <b>lapping</b> load within this load range. When <b>the</b> <b>lapping</b> load was higher than 43 N/ball, the material removal rate started to drop and <b>the</b> <b>lapped</b> ball roundness error started to increase. At <b>the</b> highest nominal <b>lapping</b> load of 107 N/ball, surface and subsurface damages were found on <b>the</b> <b>lapped</b> balls. Because of eccentric loading effect, the actual load on individual ball could be 25 ~ 28 % higher than <b>the</b> nominal <b>lapping</b> load. <b>The</b> surface residual stresses of lapped balls under different lapping loads were measured, and it was found that <b>the</b> <b>lapping</b> load had less effect than previous HIP process. Rolling contact fatigue tests were conducted on balls lapped at nominal loads of 43 N/ball and 107 N/ball. No failure occurred on <b>the</b> ball <b>lapped</b> at 43 N/ball after 138 million stress cycles. Ball lapped at 107 N/ball was failed after 13. 3 million stress cycles with a shallow spall with flat bottom inside. This research suggests that <b>the</b> <b>lapping</b> load for advanced ceramic balls in conventional concentric lapping could be doubled from 20 N/ball to 40 N/ball without degrading the surface quality of lapped balls...|$|R
