5|$|It is {{very common}} {{practice}} for power companies or their customers to impose harmonic distortion limits based on IEC or IEEE standards. For example, IEEE Standard 519 limits at the customer's connection point call for the maximum individual frequency voltage harmonic <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> more than 3% of the fundamental and call for the voltage total harmonic distortion (THD) <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> more than 5% for a general AC power supply system.|$|E

5|$|A {{researcher}} {{examining the}} skeleton identifies {{it as the}} missing victim from 1933. However, there seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> substantial evidence proving that Tooms was the murderer. Scully relieves Mulder, who is watching Tooms' new residence; they are unaware that Tooms is hiding {{in the trunk of}} Mulder's car. He manages to break into Mulder's apartment, where he injures himself and imprints Mulder's shoe print on his face. Tooms' frameup leads the police to question Mulder. Skinner then forbids Mulder from contacting Tooms.|$|E

5|$|As {{it became}} clear that there was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> {{reversal}} of Spanish American independence, several of the new states began to receive international recognition. Early, in 1822, the United States recognized Chile, the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, Peru, Gran Colombia, and Mexico. Britain waited until 1825, after the Battle of Ayacucho, to recognize Mexico, Gran Colombia, and Río de la Plata. Both nations recognized more Spanish American states in the next few years.|$|E
5|$|In 1148, Pope Eugene III {{granted the}} abbey an {{exemption}} on paying tithe for their newly acquired land and livestock.

5|$|The {{origins of}} the dish are unclear. The name most likely derives from the French anges à cheval, and there appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> {{significance}} in the oyster/angel and bacon/horse links. Its first occurrence, according to the Oxford English Dictionary and other sources, is in 1888, in Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management. However, there is a reference in an Australian newspaper to the dish, which includes a brief recipe, from 1882.|$|E
5|$|A map of Kintzheim in Alsace from 1348 {{contains}} the text zu dem Russelinge, {{but it is}} not certain that this reference is to the grape variety. However, in 1477, Riesling was documented in Alsace under the spelling Rissling. In Wachau in Austria, there is a small stream and a small vineyard both called Ritzling, which are claimed locally to have given Riesling its name. However, there seems <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> documentary evidence to back this up, so this claim is not widely believed to be correct.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{features}} of the cervical vertebrae which distinguish Dinocephalosaurus from other protorosaurs include the low and keel-like neural spines, and the anterior and posterior (rear) articular surfaces of the vertebrae both being concave (amphicoelous). In the first ten vertebrae, the bottom margin is also concave. The long, slender cervical ribs bear frontal projections free of the vertebral bodies, which are also unique to Dinocephalosaurus. These ribs are aligned along the neck and bridge multiple consecutive vertebral joints, from two or three consecutive joints in the anterior the neck to five or six in the posterior neck. There appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> distinct processes on the vertebrae for articulation with the ribs.|$|E

5|$|After the drawn Second Test, Simpson {{contracted}} chickenpox, so Booth {{was again}} captain for the Third Test {{in front of}} his home crowd at the SCG. It was an extra burden, as Booth had made only 49 runs in the first two Tests; his teammates felt that their captain had been too anxious following his struggles against Griffith in the Caribbean. However, there was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> fairytale for Booth, who later admitted to being in psychological disarray; he was unaware if the rolling done on the pitch after the toss was legal, and Philpott arrived late and ran onto the field just as play was starting.|$|E
5|$|After touring Who's Next, and needing time {{to write}} a follow-up, Townshend insisted that the Who take a lengthy break, as they had not stopped touring since the band started. There was no group {{activity}} until May 1972, when they started working on a proposed new album, Rock Is Dead—Long Live Rock!, but, unhappy with the recordings, abandoned the sessions. Tensions began to emerge as Townshend believed Daltrey just wanted a money-making band and Daltrey thought Townshend's projects were getting pretentious. Moon's behaviour was becoming increasingly destructive and problematic through excessive drinking and drugs use, {{and a desire to}} party and tour. Daltrey performed an audit of the group's finances and discovered that Lambert and Stamp had not kept sufficient records. He believed them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> longer effective managers, which Townshend and Moon disputed. The painful dissolution of the managerial and personal relationships are recounted in James D. Cooper's 2014 retrospective documentary, Lambert & Stamp. Following a short European tour, the remainder of 1972 was spent working on an orchestral version of Tommy with Lou Reizner.|$|E
5|$|American {{intelligence}} analysts were quite baffled by {{this series of}} enemy actions. For them there appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> logic behind the sustained NVA/NLF offensives, other than to inflict casualties on the allied forces. This they accomplished, but the casualties absorbed by the North Vietnamese seemed to negate any direct gains they might have obtained. The border battles did, however, have two significant consequences that were unappreciated at the time—they fixed {{the attention of the}} American command on the border regions and they drew American and ARVN forces away from the coastal lowlands and cities, in preparation for the Tet Offensive.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal {{were the}} reigning champions of England having won the Football League First Division title in 1990–91. The team had only lost one match in their {{successful}} league campaign, to Chelsea in February 1991.

5|$|Davidson struck 46runs in {{the first}} innings of the Fourth Test in Adelaide, then tore his {{hamstring}} muscle after bowling only 3.4 overs. Australia, with a bowler short, was unable to force a win without him. The Fifth Test was on his home ground at Sydney with the series locked 1–1. He captured 3/43 and 3/80, taking a wicket with his final ball in Test cricket when Alan Smith was caught at slip by Bob Simpson. This left Australia with a target of 241 in 60 overs, but there was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> fairytale finish as the match ended in a draw.|$|E
5|$|Du Bois {{opposed the}} U.S. {{intervention}} in World War II, {{particularly in the}} Pacific, because he believed that China and Japan were emerging from the clutches of white imperialists. He felt that the European Allies waging war against Japan was an opportunity for whites to reestablish their influence in Asia. He was deeply disappointed by the US government's plan for African Americans in the armed forces: Blacks were limited to 5.8% of the force, and there were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> African-American combat units– virtually the same restrictions as in World War I.The military later changed its policy, and units such as the Tuskegee Airmen saw combat. With blacks threatening to shift their support to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Republican opponent in the 1940 election, Roosevelt appointed a few blacks to leadership posts in the military.|$|E
