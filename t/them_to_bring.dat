5|$|On {{the morning}} of 19July 1941, Stojanović and Bašić arrived at the camp of the communists and their sympathisers who escaped from Prijedor, {{situated}} at Rajlića Kosa above the village of Malo Palančište. The news of Stojanović's escape soon spread throughout the Prijedor district. The group, mostly in the early twenties, enjoyed an increase in their credibility and esteem since a well-known and respected doctor had joined their camp. People from surrounding Serb villages brought food and other supplies to Stojanović and his young comrades. Stojanović gave speeches to the villagers, telling them {{to be prepared for}} an impending uprising and urging <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> him rifles they were hiding in their homes. The camp at Rajlića Kosa was the first Partisan camp in the Kozara area.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Odessa, {{he got a}} job distributing newspapers. This respectable work {{required}} {{getting up}} at 6 a.m., not good for a carouser. Still, newspaper connection meant that he soon heard of one of the war's other effects: the many Jewish merchants and middlemen war brought to Bucharest were a boon to Abraham Goldfaden's nascent Yiddish theater there. Two of his Odessa acquaintances—Israel Rosenberg, a personable con-man, and Jacob Spivakofsky, scion of a wealthy Jewish family—had become actors there, then had left Goldfaden to found their own company, touring in Moldavia. Adler wrote them to urge <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> their troupe to Odessa.|$|E
5|$|The {{approaching}} Turkish forces convinced Chetwode to {{call off}} the attack. But at 16:30, as the other brigades were retiring, the New Zealanders charged and captured their objective. This allowed <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> enfilade fire onto {{the rest of the}} position. The rest of the division then resumed the attack and captured the village. By now the Turkish relief force was about two miles away to the north-east. By 17:15 all the wounded had been evacuated and the covering patrols recalled. As there were no water supplies at Rafa, at 18:30 the brigade was ordered to withdraw back to Sheikh Zowaiid. Although not as heavily involved in the battle as other units, the regiment still had twelve men dead and eighteen wounded.|$|E

5|$|The {{company had}} not {{revealed}} anything about upcoming projects for a year, until 2008, when Sega {{announced that it}} would be publishing four PlatinumGames' titles. According to Minami, the titles were unique and creative, and it was courageous of Sega to publish these risky titles. Minami added further that the partnership with Sega allowed <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> these titles to Western markets. The three games included: MadWorld, Infinite Space, and Bayonetta. Each was released in 2009. All the intellectual properties created by PlatinumGames as part of the partnership are owned by Sega.|$|E
5|$|Fruits are {{released}} in the summer, containing about 16 seeds on average. These seeds are most typically dispersed by ants, which is called myrmecochory, but yellow jackets (Vespula vulgaris) and harvestmen (order Opiliones) have both been observed dispersing the seeds at lower frequencies. Insect dispersal is aided {{by the presence of}} a conspicuous elaiosome, an oil-rich body attached to the seed, which is high in both lipids and oleic acid. The oleic acid induces corpse-carrying behavior in ants, causing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the seeds to their nesting sites as if they were food. As ants visit several colonies of the plant, they bring genetically variable seeds back to a single location, which after germination results in a new population with relatively high genetic diversity. This has the ultimate effect of increasing biological fitness.|$|E
5|$|Peaceful times {{ended in}} 1296, with the {{outbreak}} of the Wars of Scottish Independence. Dirleton, which guarded the route between Edinburgh and the English border, changed hands several times through the invasions of the English under King Edward I. During the campaign of summer 1298, the castle was besieged by English forces under Antony Bek, the Bishop of Durham. Dirleton withstood the assault for several months, until the English victory at Falkirk allowed <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> up large siege engines, after which the castle was soon reduced. Dirleton was garrisoned by the English, but must have been retaken by the Scots before 1306, when the English commander Aymer de Valence, 2nd Earl of Pembroke recaptured Dirleton once more. It was finally retaken by the Scots some time before 1314, and was slighted, or deliberately damaged, to prevent its reuse by the English.|$|E

5|$|When the loyalist {{reinforcements}} {{rolled into}} the capital aboard tanks and armored vehicles and began to wrest the initiative, the rebels began to break. After a brief, violent battle that killed around 400 people, the coup attempt was crushed. The casualties included {{a large number of}} anti-Diệm civilians; Thi exhorted <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> down the Ngô family by charging the palace; 13 were gunned down by the loyalist soldiers as they invaded the grounds. After the failed coup, Đông, Thi and other prominent officers fled to Tan Son Nhut and climbed aboard a C-47. They fled to Cambodia, where they were given asylum by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, a long-time Diệm opponent. Diệm promptly reneged on his promises, and intensified his authoritarian rule and crackdowns on dissidents. Almost three years after the incident, Diệm opened the trial for those involved in the coup on 8 July 1963. Thi and his fellow exiled officers were found guilty and sentenced to death in absentia. In the meantime, Thi lived self-sufficiently in Cambodia for three years.|$|E

25|$|The {{arrival of}} the Huns in 372–375 ended the history of these kingdoms. The Huns, a {{confederation}} of central Asian tribes, founded an empire. They had mastered the difficult art of shooting composite recurve bows from horseback. The Goths sought refuge in Roman territory (376), agreeing to enter the Empire as unarmed settlers. However many bribed the Danube border-guards into allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> their weapons.|$|E

The court heard much the same testimony as in the committal hearings. However, it appeared that Terence had initially been somewhat confused about the sequence of events. The prosecution claimed that Dennis was tied to a bench and beaten with a stick for eating a swede the day before he died.|$|E

25|$|Self-verification theory {{predicts that}} when people {{interact}} with others, {{there is a general}} tendency for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> others to see them as they see themselves. This tendency is especially pronounced when they start out believing that the other person has misconstrued them, apparently because people compensate by working especially hard to bring others to confirm their self-views. People will even stop working on tasks to which they have been assigned if they sense that their performance is eliciting non-verifying feedback.|$|E
25|$|The in-game astronauts, {{known as}} Kerbals, are {{physically}} simulated while performing extra vehicular activities (EVA). For example, hitting an object {{with only the}} Kerbal's feet will cause them to tumble. While on EVA, Kerbals may use their EVA suit propellant system to maneuver in space and around crafts and space stations, similar {{to the use of}} NASA's Manned Maneuvering Unit. Actions that can be performed while on EVA include repairing landing legs, wheels, and solar panels. Kerbals can also collect material from science experiments, allowing <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> back data without carrying unwieldy parts or risking destruction of the product during atmospheric entry.|$|E
25|$|Schachter-Shalomi {{encouraged}} {{diversity among}} his students and urged <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> their own talents, vision, views {{and social justice}} values to the study and practice of Judaism. Based on the Hasidic writings of Rabbi Mordechai Yosef Leiner of Izbitz, he taught that anything, even what others consider sin and heresy could be God's will. His detractors argued that his views were too unconventional and that the theology he promulgated borders on pantheism. His supporters argued that his empowering approach was legitimate, and praised the range of Jewish ritual art, music and liturgical innovation that his work seeded.|$|E

She is worshiped by Hindus {{who believe that}} bathing in the river causes the remission of sins and facilitates Moksha (liberation from the cycle of life and death), and that {{the water of the}} Ganges is considered very pure. Pilgrims immerse the ashes of their kin in the Ganges, which is considered by <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> the spirits closer to moksha. In Hinduism, moksha is the liberation from the cycle of life and death.|$|E

At a nearby synagogue, they reveal their intentions: they believe the 216-digit number was meant for <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> about the messianic age, as the number represents the unspeakable name of God. Max refuses, insisting that whatever the source of the number is, it has been revealed to him alone.|$|E
25|$|In the {{following}} years Wang realised a far-reaching development plan. He tried to bring more workers into the booming Manchurian economy. Most had come on a temporary basis, returning to their homes in north China in winter. The Manchurian government now encouraged <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> women and children, and settle permanently. As an incentive, they were made eligible for reduced fares on all Chinese-owned railways in Manchuria, received funds to build a dwelling and were promised total ownership {{after five years of}} continuous occupation. Rent for the land was canceled for the first years. Most were sent to the interior of Manchuria, where they reclaimed land for agriculture, or worked in forestry or mines. Between 1924-29 the amount of land under tillage increased from 20 to 35 million acres (80,000 to 140,000km²).|$|E
