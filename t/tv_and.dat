40|$|In this territory-wide {{molecular}} epidemiology study of picornaviruses, involving 6765 dead wild birds from 201 species in 50 families over a 12 month period, three novel picornaviruses, turdiviruses 1, 2 <b>and</b> 3 (<b>TV</b> 1, <b>TV</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>TV</b> 3), were identified from birds of different genera {{in the family}} Turdidae. In contrast to many other viruses in birds of the family Turdidae or viruses of the family Picornaviridae, TV 1, <b>TV</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>TV</b> 3 were found exclusively in the autumn and winter months. Two genomes each of TV 1, <b>TV</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>TV</b> 3 were sequenced. Regions P 1, P 2 and P 3 of the three turdiviruses possessed, respectively, < 40, < 40 and < 50 % amino acid identities {{with those of other}} picornaviruses. Moreover, P 1, P 2 and P 3 of TV 1 also possessed, respectively, < 40, < 40 and < 50 % amino acid identities with those of <b>TV</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>TV</b> 3. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that TV 1, <b>TV</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>TV</b> 3 were distantly related to members of the genus Kobuvirus. Among the three turdiviruses, <b>TV</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>TV</b> 3 were always clustered together, with high bootstrap supports of 1000. The genomic features of <b>TV</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>TV</b> 3 were also distinct from TV 1, including lower G+C contents, shorter leader protein and a preference for codon sequence NNT rather than NNC for amino acids that can use either NNT or NNC as codons (P< 0. 001 by χ 2 -test). Based on our results we propose two novel genera, Orthoturdivirus for <b>TV</b> 1, <b>and</b> Paraturdivirus for <b>TV</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>TV</b> 3, in the family Picornaviridae. The type of internal ribosomal entry site for TV 1, <b>TV</b> 2 <b>and</b> <b>TV</b> 3 remains to be determined. © 2010 SGM. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|R
