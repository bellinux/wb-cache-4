5|$|A {{major change}} in the <b>training</b> {{programme}} occurred in 1943. From that point on <b>training</b> concentrated more on the assault infantry role and less on raiding operations. <b>Training</b> now included how to call for fire support from artillery and naval gunfire, and how to obtain tactical air support from the Allied air forces. More emphasis was put on joint <b>training,</b> with two or more Commando units working together in brigades.|$|E
5|$|According to BAE Systems, the Nimrod MRA4 systems was {{to enable}} the crews to gather, process and display up to 20 times more {{technical}} and strategic data than the MR2. The Searchwater 2000 radar was stated to have been capable over land as well as water; {{with the ability to}} have swept {{an area the size of}} the UK every 10 seconds. The Aircraft Synthetic <b>Training</b> Aids (ASTA) provided by Thales <b>Training</b> & Simulation was an electronic <b>training</b> suite to allow the <b>training</b> of crew members to transfer from active MRA4 aircraft to ground-based <b>training</b> systems; this change was made to increase the availability of the aircraft for operational missions and allow for more intensive <b>training</b> exercises.|$|E

5|$|After {{her return}} to Japan, Hōshō was {{transferred}} to the Third Fleet, unofficially assigned to the <b>training</b> fleet (later called the Mobile Force <b>Training</b> Force), and officially assigned in October. She conducted flight <b>training</b> in the Inland Sea for aircraft that flew in from shore bases, since no aircraft were based on board Hōshō. On 15 January 1943, the 50th Air Flotilla was created for carrier aircrew <b>training</b> and both Hōshō and Ryūhō were assigned to the new unit. The two ships provided carrier landing <b>training</b> and served as target ships for torpedo <b>training.</b> In January 1944, Hōshō was reassigned to the 12th Air Fleet, then to the Combined Fleet, but continued to perform the same mission of <b>training</b> fleet carrier pilots in the Inland Sea. In this role, Hōshō shuttled back and forth between Kure and the Western Inland Sea, spending equal amounts of time at each location.|$|E

5|$|Flying {{instruction}} in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) underwent major changes following the outbreak of World WarII, {{in response to a}} vast {{increase in the number of}} aircrew volunteers and the commencement of Australia's participation in the Empire Air <b>Training</b> Scheme (EATS). The Air Force's pre-war pilot <b>training</b> facility, No.1 Flying <b>Training</b> School at RAAF Station Point Cook, Victoria, was supplanted in 1940–41 by twelve elementary flying <b>training</b> schools (EFTS) and eight service flying <b>training</b> schools (SFTS). The EFTS provided a twelve-week introductory flying course to personnel who had graduated from one of the RAAF's initial <b>training</b> schools. Flying <b>training</b> was undertaken in two stages: the first involved four weeks of instruction (including ten hours of flying) to determine trainees' suitability to become pilots. Those that passed this grading process then received a further eight weeks of <b>training</b> (including sixty-five hours of flying) at the EFTS. Pilots who successfully completed this course were posted to an SFTS in either Australia or Canada for the next stage of their instruction as military aviators.|$|E
