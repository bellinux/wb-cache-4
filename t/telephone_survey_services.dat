40|$|This article {{explores the}} {{potential}} use of <b>telephone</b> <b>surveys</b> for {{the conduct of}} human service needs assessments. After reviewing relevant literature bearing on the subject of <b>telephone</b> <b>surveys,</b> a theoretical <b>telephone</b> <b>survey</b> human <b>service</b> needs assessment of Maricopa County, Arizona is compared with an actual human service needs assessment using the traditional personal survey approach. The results suggest that the two approaches produce similar findings at the aggregate data, or community, level but that the underrepresentation of certain target groups of interest to human service administrators (e. g. low-income and ethnic minorities) may cause disaggregation problems. Methodological techniques to deal with the underrepresentation of these target groups in <b>telephone</b> <b>survey</b> human <b>service</b> needs assessments are discussed. The article concludes by suggesting that the successful utilization of a <b>telephone</b> <b>survey</b> approach to human service needs assessment may ultimately turn more on political rather than methodological concerns...|$|R
40|$|Background: Large-scale {{mental health}} surveys have {{provided}} invaluable {{information regarding the}} prevalence of specific mental disorders and service use for mental health reasons. Unfortunately, because vast surveys conducted face to face are very costly, many countries and provinces do not embark upon this path of research, thus depriving themselves of {{a rich source of}} data useful for service planning. Method: As an alternative, the authors undertook a <b>telephone</b> <b>survey</b> with a sample of 893 residents from a Montreal catchment area. Mental disorders were assessed by the Composite International Diagnostic Interview Simplified (CIDIS), an instrument especially designed to be used in mail or <b>telephone</b> <b>surveys.</b> <b>Service</b> utilization was measured by an instrument similar to those used in recent large Canadian or American surveys. Results: The prevalence rate for any mental disorder was lower in this study than in some large-scale epidemiological surveys reviewed. This could be explained by methodological differences, such as number of disorders covered and period of reference. With regard to specific mental disorders, results appeared very similar to those of other studies. Concerning service utilization, rates tended to be higher than in other studies, and this finding could reflect real differences between Quebec and other Canadian provinces or the United States. Conclusions: Aside from being lower in cost, <b>telephone</b> <b>surveys</b> can yield results comparable to those obtained in large-scale epidemiological surveys conducted by means of face-to-face interviews...|$|R
40|$|This degree {{project was}} made in {{collaboration}} with Nordicstation. The project task {{was to develop a}} testing application for a self-developed <b>telephone</b> <b>survey</b> <b>service,</b> which uses third party software. This third party software showed to be unreliable at higher loads. The purpose of the application is to analyse the speech quality of clients connected to the service. This report gives an introduction to the speech quality algorithms Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) and Single Sided Speech Quality Measure (3 SQM). It also gives descriptions of the methods used to develop the application. The final chapters in this report are about the testing of the telephone service. The primary result of the testing was that the telephone service is unable to acceptably handle 80 + clients and recommendations to Nordicstation is to set a maximum of parallel connected clients to 80 or find an alternative to the third party software currently in use. Detta examensarbete har gjorts i samarbete med Nordicstation. Projektets uppgift var att utveckla ett test program för at testa en egenutvecklad telefonundersökning-tjänst, baserad på tredjeparts mjukvara. Denna tredjeparts mjukvara visade sig vara opålitlig vid högre belastning. Syftet med programmet är att analysera samtals kvalitéten på de klienter som är anslutna till tjänsten. Denna rapport ger en introduktion till ljudkvalitetsalgoritmer så som Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality (PESQ) och Single Sided Speech Quality Measure (3 SQM). Rapporten går även igenom de metoder som använts för att utvecklat programmet. De sista kapitlen i denna rapport är om själva testningen av telefonitjänsten. Det primära resultatet av testningen var att telefontjänsten inte kan hantera 80 + klienter acceptabelt och rekommendationer till Nordicstation är att sätta ett tak på maximalt parallellt anslutna klienter till 80 eller hitta ett alternativ till den tredjeparts mjukvara som nu används...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the physical activity-related policies and practices of childcare services; and to determine if service size, socioeconomic or remoteness characteristics predict such policies and practices. Methods: Authorized supervisors of 216 licensed pre-schools and long day care centres participated in a brief <b>telephone</b> <b>survey.</b> Results: Few <b>services</b> had a written physical activity policy, programmed time each day for fundamental movement skill development, or had staff trained in physical activity. Twenty-eight percent of pre-schools and 30 % of long day care centres provided daily opportunities for children 3 – 5 years to participate in sedentary screen activities. Rural pre-schools and long day care centres were more likely to program time for fundamental movement skills development, as were pre-schools from higher socioeconomic areas. Conclusions: There is substantial scope for childcare services to modify their policies and practices to be more supportive of child physical activity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Understanding client {{perspectives}} on treatment is increasingly recognized as key to improving care. Yet {{information on the}} perceptions and experiences of workers with private insurance coverage who receive help for substance use conditions is relatively sparse, particularly in managed behavioral health care organization (MBHO) populations. Furthermore, the role of several factors including prior service use has not been fully explored. Methods Employees covered by a large MBHO who had received substance abuse services {{in the past year}} were surveyed (146 respondents completed the <b>telephone</b> <b>survey</b> and self-reported <b>service</b> use). Results The most common reasons for entering treatment were problems with health; home, family or friends; or work. Prior treatment users reported more reasons for entering treatment and more substance use-related work impairment. The majority of all respondents felt treatment helped a lot or some. One quarter reported getting less treatment than they felt they needed. Discussion and conclusions Study findings point to the need to tailor treatment for prior service users and to recognize the role of work in treatment entry and outcomes. Perceived access issues may be present even among insured clients already in treatment. </p...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{efforts have}} been made for {{automatically}} identifying opinions, emotions and sentiments in text. The problem considered in this paper is the analysis of messages uttered by the users of a telephone service {{in response to a}} recorded message that asks if a problem they had was satisfactorily solved. Very often in these cases, subjective information is combined with factual information. The purpose of this type of opinion analysis is the detection of time variations of user satisfaction indices. Even if precision or recall is not very high because messages are ambiguous or ASR systems have made many word recognition errors, system strategies are acceptable if they detect the same trend in user satisfaction as it is indicated by human interpreters of the messages. In this paper a system for this type of opinion analysis is proposed for a <b>telephone</b> <b>service</b> <b>survey</b> task.

40|$|During 2012, the {{employer}} {{of this essay}} carried out a <b>telephone</b> <b>survey</b> with 18000 participants and a web panel survey with 708 participants. Those who partook in the <b>telephone</b> <b>survey</b> were given a choice to join the web panel. The purpose of this work is to study the participants of the <b>telephone</b> <b>survey</b> {{and see if they}} reflect the Swedish population with regards to several socio-demographic factors. Also, we intend to investigate if the propensity to join the web panel differs for participants of the <b>telephone</b> <b>survey</b> with regards to various socio-demographic affiliations. It is also of interest to study if the response pattern is different for participants of the <b>telephone</b> <b>survey</b> that would like to join the web panel and those who reject. A comparison of response pattern between the <b>telephone</b> <b>survey</b> and web panel survey has also been done, to see if there exist any differences for these two groups of surveys.

40|$|Purpose To {{reflect on}} reasons for refusal in {{cross-cultural}} <b>telephone</b> <b>surveys</b> and address ways of reducing non-response from Chinese managers. Approach We first propose a conceptual model for <b>telephone</b> <b>survey</b> cooperation, drawing on existing research regarding survey non-response. This is evaluated through reflections on non-response to a <b>telephone</b> <b>survey</b> of 1, 900 Chinese senior and middle managers working in privately owned high-technology firms. Findings We {{conclude with a}} framework for cooperation in cross-cultural <b>telephone</b> <b>surveys,</b> enhancing the leverage-saliency theory. Among many factors, home country interviewers are crucial in gaining access and generating survey interview responses. However, they require careful recruitment, rigorous training and monitoring to help ensure the quality of research data. Research implications Our framework provides practical advice in minimising non-response in cross-cultural <b>telephone</b> <b>surveys.</b> This includes sample selection, {{the development of the}} survey instrument (and translation), reasons for refusal, research incentives and the role of interviewers. Originality/value Our contribution in this chapter is twofold: an enhanced understanding of leverage-saliency theory in cross-cultural <b>telephone</b> <b>surveys,</b> and an articulation of the role of interviewers in changing the dynamics of positive and negative leverage through telephone interaction with managers. </p...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To compare {{rates of}} {{emergency}} readmission following discharge for common paediatric conditions {{from a range}} of hospital services. Design: Retrospective analysis of hospital episode statistics (HES) and <b>telephone</b> <b>survey</b> of <b>service</b> provision. Setting: Twelve hospitals serving a metropolitan area in the North West of England. Outcome measures: Emergency admissions to hospital within 7 days of discharge for breathing difficulty, feverish illness and/or diarrhoea. Results: HES were obtained for all children under 15 years of age discharged following emergency admission for breathing difficulty, feverish illness and/or diarrhoea during 2005 / 2006 (n= 20 354) or 2006 / 2007 (n= 23 018). The readmission rate for all hospitals in 2006 / 2007 was 5. 5 %. The percentage of same day discharges was associated with readmission (Kendall’s taub correlation= 0. 61, p= 0. 007). Readmissions were also associated with the proportion of same day discharges for breathing difficulty (Kendall’s taub= 0. 83, p < 0. 001) and feverish illness (Kendall’s taub= 0. 50, p= 0. 023) but not significantly so with diarrhoea (Kendall’s taub= 0. 37, p= 0. 098). The total number of admissions at a hospital in the year was associated with its readmission rate (Kendall’s taub= 0. 71, p= 0. 002). Most of the sample lived in the 40 % most deprived areas in England, but there was no significant association between readmission and living in the 10 % most deprived areas. Conclusions: Readmission rates are associated with higher numbers of annual admissions and higher proportions of children discharged on the day of admission. Variations between hospitals suggest that other factors can also affect readmission rates. Readmission rates calculated from HES can contribute to assessments of the outcome of emergency services...|$|R

40|$|Recently, {{the leading}} {{position}} of <b>telephone</b> <b>surveys</b> {{as the major}} mode of data collection has been challenged. <b>Telephone</b> <b>surveys</b> suffer from a growing nonresponse, {{partly due to the}} general nonresponse trend for all surveys and partly due to changes in society and technology influencing contactability and willingness to answer. One way to counteract the increasing nonresponse is the use of an advance letter. In mail and face-to-face surveys, advance letters have been proven effective. Based on the proven effectiveness in face-to-face and mail surveys, survey handbooks advise the use of advance letters in <b>telephone</b> <b>surveys.</b> This study reviews the evidence for this advice and presents a quantitative summary of empirical studies on the effectiveness of advance letters in raising the response rate for <b>telephone</b> <b>surveys.</b> The major conclusion is that advance letters are also an effective tool in <b>telephone</b> <b>surveys,</b> with an average increase in response rate (RR 1) from 58 percent (no letter) to 66 percent (advance letter), and an average increase in cooperation rate (COOP 1) from 64 percent (no letter) to 75 percent (advance letter) ...|$|R

At any given time ten thousand or more people work as forced laborers in scores of cities and towns across the country.

40|$|Until quite recently, <b>telephone</b> <b>surveys</b> have {{typically}} relied on landline telephone numbers. However, {{with the increasing}} popularity and affordability of mobile phones, {{there has been a}} surge in households that do not have landline connections. Additionally, there has been a decline in the response rates and population coverage of landline <b>telephone</b> <b>surveys,</b> creating a challenge to collecting representative social data.

40|$|Technological {{changes and}} the rapid {{adoption}} by the population of emergent technologies, such as mobile phone, have strongly impacted communicative behavior and uses. In almost one on five Spanish households (one on four following EU e-Communications Households Survey, 2008), cell phones have replaced land lines as the principal long distance communication device. These households present a specific profile differentiating them from those that have both technologies at their disposal, and in greater measure from those that only have a land line. The most important impact of this process for research based on <b>telephone</b> <b>surveys</b> is that, {{despite the fact that}} telephone coverage has not ceased to increase until practically becoming universal, more and more homes every day are excluded from the sampling frame of traditional <b>telephone</b> <b>surveys.</b> In the last years we have witnessed a growing concern on this issue and more and more scholars are contributing to this area of research (Kuusela and Simpanen, Callegaro, Vehovar, Fuchs, Buskirk, Steeh, Brick, Keeter, ZuWallack, Fleeman, Lavrakas, etc.). The Institute for Advanced Social Studies (IESA) began to carry out phone interviews in 2003. We started to analyze the impact of this problem in Spain in 2004 as a response to our growing problems locating young respondents (Pasadas del Amo et al. 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008). In 2007, we conducted our first <b>telephone</b> <b>survey</b> using a dual frame sample of Cell and Landline phones at a national level. In 2008 we also applied this methodology to <b>telephone</b> <b>surveys</b> carried out at a regional level.
