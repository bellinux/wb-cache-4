5|$|The combat was {{generally}} well-received, with some reviewers noting {{that it is}} mostly unchanged from the original Knights of the Old Republic. GameSpot compared the combat from the first Knights of the Old Republic to the second, {{saying that it is}}n't well-balanced in both; however, the reviewer wrote that it helps the combat remain spontaneous. GameZone said that the combat is not changed from the first Knights of the Old Republic to the second, but that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> since the combat in the original was enjoyable. IGN praised the game's AI, saying that it is easy to control the main character alone without controlling the party members. GameSpy's reviewer, on the other hand, said that he encountered problems with the combat AI that were not present in the original Knights of the Old Republic.|$|E

2500|$|McFarlane {{described}} the album as [...] "a more adventurous progressive rock album. It had {{less of a}} commercial feel, and Leslie layered the songs with snaking guitar solos." [...] Daniel Gioffre of AllMusic felt that [...] "For the most part, the songwriting here is topnotch, {{with most of the}} songs showcasing fairly sophisticated harmonic and rhythmic ideas. Despite the proggy nature of some of the compositions, the mix is total pop, with DeMarchi way up front. However, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> as she has a very strong, if sometimes overemotive, singing voice." [...] The album peaked at No.2 in Australia.

2500|$|Laura's cake is {{complete}} {{but she is}} not happy. It is less than she had hoped it would be. She had invested great and desperate hopes in the cake, like an artist working on a great piece of art, and in her mind, she failed. Laura catalogues what she will do to keep busy {{for the rest of the}} day: prepare for Dan's party. She knows Dan will be happy with whatever she prepares. This slightly annoys her. She realises her husband's happiness [...] "depends only on the fact of her, here in the house, living her life, thinking of him". She tries to tell herself <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> and that she is being difficult but is suddenly hit by the image of Virginia Woolf putting a stone into the pocket of her coat and walking into a river. This psychic connection to another ‘desperate housewife’ is interrupted by a tap on the back door.|$|E

60|$|It {{may seem}} mere {{praise of the}} novel {{to say it is}} the art of sympathy and the study of human variations. But indeed, though <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing,</b> it is not universally good. We have gained in sympathy; but we have lost in brotherhood. Old quarrels had more {{equality}} than modern exonerations. Two peasants in the Middle Ages quarrelled about their two fields. But they went to the same church, served in the same semi-feudal militia, and had the same morality, which ever might happen to be breaking it at the moment. The very cause of their quarrel was the cause of their fraternity; they both liked land. But suppose one of them a teetotaler who desired the abolition of hops on both farms; suppose the other a vegetarian who desired the abolition of chickens on both farms: and it is at once apparent that a quarrel of quite a different kind would begin; and that in that quarrel {{it would not be a}} question of farmer against farmer, but of individual against individual. This fundamental sense of human fraternity can only exist in the presence of positive religion. Man is merely man only when he is seen against the sky. If he is seen against any landscape, he is only a man of that land. If he is seen against any house, he is only a householder. Only where death and eternity are intensely present can human beings fully feel their fellowship. Once the divine darkness against which we stand is really dismissed from the mind (as it was very nearly dismissed in the Victorian time) the differences between human beings become overpoweringly plain; whether they are expressed in the high caricatures of Dickens or the low lunacies of Zola.|$|E
