Job performance is about behaviors that are within the control of the employee and not about results (effectiveness), the costs involved in achieving results (productivity), the results <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> in a period of time (efficiency), or the value an organization places on a given level of performance, effectiveness, productivity or efficiency (utility).|$|E

40|$|In online {{learning}} environments communities are desirable, or {{as is the}} case for a learning network, even essential. This raises {{the question of how to}} attain and sustain these communities. In this article we argue <b>that</b> this <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> by fostering the social capital of the learning network. It <b>is</b> argued <b>that</b> this <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> by (1) improving the relationship characteristics, (2) increasing the sense of belonging to the community, and (3) heightening the mutual support.

These groups are a means through which learners are brought together for a specific, learning-related goal (‘ad-hoc’) and for only a limited amount of time (‘transience’).

Robbins said that it is important that such a place exists for us. Isaac M. Morehouse suggests that the film provides a great illustration of how characters can be free, even in prison, or unfree, even in freedom, based on their outlooks on life. Philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre described freedom as an ongoing project that requires attention and resilience, without which a person begins to be defined by others or institutions, mirroring Red's belief that inmates become dependent on the prison to define their lives. Andy displays resilience through rebellion, by playing music over the prison loudspeaker, and refusing to continue with the money laundering scam.|$|E
500|$|Each route {{the game}} takes {{invariably}} concludes with an ending {{specific to the}} choices made up to that point. Depending on these choices, {{the outcome of the}} story will either be good or bad. School Days became popularly known for its bad endings, which depict the deaths of characters. In one ending titled [...] "The Bloody Conclusion", a character's neck is slit open with a dōzuki, causing her to collapse and die in a fountain of blood to the manic laughter of her assailant. In another called [...] "Eternally", a character commits suicide leaning over and falling off the roof of a school, landing headfirst on a sidewalk to the horror of other characters. The game's good endings, by contrast, depict the well-being of characters and their relationships. In the ending [...] "Christmas Eve", a couple share an embrace in a hotel room as snow falls around a surrounding cityscape. In another titled [...] "Two Lovers", a pair of characters agree to have a polyamorous relationship with the male lead instead of rivaling with each other.

500|$|One of Blow's {{goals for}} The Witness {{was to explore}} the types of non-verbal {{communication}} <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> by the medium of video games, an exploration he felt to be important to understanding them as an art form. The name The Witness is derived from core gameplay aspect of making the player perceptive of the surroundings to discover meaning and solutions to the puzzles without verbal communication, a similar approach taken by Myst (1993). Blow attributes much of The Witnesss design to Myst, a game that got him into video game development. One aspect of Myst that Blow desired to correct {{was the nature of}} [...] "pixel hunting" [...] in some of its puzzles; the player would have to click on various parts of the virtual machinery without knowing what the end result was until sometime later in the puzzle. Within The Witness, Blow created a unifying mechanic for all the puzzles to avoid this confusion, using the maze panels as this mechanic. While the interaction mechanics are the same for all these mazes, the rules and behavior described by the game's symbolic language that limit or result from the interactions form the core of the puzzles in the game.
