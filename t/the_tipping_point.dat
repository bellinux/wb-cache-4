5|$|O'Neill's tenure lasted {{just six}} months; he {{resigned}} after {{a dispute with}} chairman Robert Chase over Chase's refusal to permit O'Neill to spend significant sums on strengthening the squad. According to O'Neill, <b>the</b> <b>tipping</b> <b>point</b> was the refusal of Chase to permit the purchase of Dean Windass. Soon after O'Neill's resignation, Chase stepped down after protests from supporters, who complained that he kept selling the club's best players, refused to reinvest in new players and consequently was to blame for relegation.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} the {{resistance}} was to topple Somerset as Lord Protector, so that in 1549 it was feared by some that the Reformation would cease. The prayer book was <b>the</b> <b>tipping</b> <b>point.</b> But Lisle, now made Earl of Warwick, was made Lord President of the Privy Council and, ever the opportunist (he died a public Roman Catholic), he saw the further implementation of the reforming policy {{as a means of}} defeating his rivals.|$|E
5|$|One colonist at Wessagusset, {{seeing these}} signs and other {{indications}} of hostility, fled to Plymouth to bring word of an imminent attack. Adding to his desperation {{and the perception}} of imminent hostility, he was pursued by natives during his flight. Arriving at Plymouth on March 24, he met with the Governor and town council. It is unclear whether this colonist's report was <b>the</b> <b>tipping</b> <b>point,</b> or whether Plymouth had already decided to mount a preemptive attack. Plymouth's Edward Winslow had recently been warned by Massasoit, a sachem whose life he saved using English medicine, of a conspiracy of several tribes against Wessagusset and Plymouth. The threatening tribes, he was told, were led by the Massachusett but also included the Nauset, Paomet, Succonet, Mattachiest, Agowaywam, and Capawack tribes {{from as far away as}} Martha's Vineyard. In either case, Plymouth colony sent a small force under Miles Standish to Wessagusset. They arrived there on March 26.|$|E

40|$|Many {{ecological}} systems exhibit <b>tipping</b> <b>points</b> {{such that they}} suddenly shift from one state to another. These shifts can be devastating from an ecological point of view, and additionally have {{severe implications for the}} socio-economic system. They can be caused by overcritical perturbations of the state variables such as external shocks, disease emergence, or species removal. It is therefore important to be able to quantify <b>the</b> <b>tipping</b> <b>points.</b> Here we present a study of <b>the</b> <b>tipping</b> <b>points</b> by considering <b>the</b> basins of attraction of the stable equilibrium points. We address the question of finding <b>the</b> <b>tipping</b> <b>points</b> that lie on the separatrix surface, which partitions the space of system trajectories. We present an algorithm that reconstructs the separatrix by using a Moving Least Squares approximant based on radial basis functions. The algorithm is applied to an eco-epidemiological model of pack hunting predators that suffer disease infection. Our analysis reveals that strong hunting cooperation considerably promotes the survival of predators and renders the predators resilient to perturbations...|$|R
5|$|The Ojo de Agua Raid was {{the last}} {{important}} military engagement between Mexican Seditionistas and the United States Army. It took place at Ojo de Agua, Texas. As part of the Plan of San Diego, the rebels launched a raid across the Rio Grande into Texas on October 21, 1915 aimed at harassing the American outposts along the Mexican border and disrupting the local economy. After moving across the border, the Seditionistas began an assault against the United States Army Signal Corps station at Ojo de Agua. The small group of American defenders was cornered into a single building and suffered heavy casualties before reinforcements arrived driving the Seditionist force back into Mexico. The raid proved to be <b>the</b> <b>tipping</b> <b>point</b> in the American conflict with the Seditionistas, as its severity convinced American officials to send large numbers of American troops to the area in order to deter any further serious border raids by the Mexican force.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Pseudo-rigid-body model (PRBM) method, which {{simplifies}} the geometrical nonlinear analysis, {{has become an}} important tool for the analysis and synthesis of compliant mechanisms. In this paper, a simplified 2 R PRBM with two rigid links and two torsion springs is proposed. The characteristic radius factor and stiffness coefficients are selected as the design variables; {{in order to be}} better to simulate <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>point</b> and <b>tip</b> slope, a three-dimensional objective function is formulated to optimize the new pseudo-rigid-body model. It is revealed in this paper that the precision of <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> <b>point</b> simulation can be improved when the coefficient of <b>the</b> <b>tip</b> slope error in the objective function is reduced. 1...|$|R

25|$|A study {{published}} in Science in 2012 found that modest rainfall reductions, amounting to only 25 to 40 percent of annual rainfall, may have been <b>the</b> <b>tipping</b> <b>point</b> to the Maya collapse.

50|$|The {{state flag}} of South Carolina {{features}} a crescent {{in the upper}} left quadrant which now resembles a crescent moon, but which some historians have suggested may have once represented a gorget. The state flag derives from a flag designed by Colonel William Moultrie in 1775 with a blue ground and crescent based on the uniforms of the Second South Carolina Regiment, who wore a crescent with <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>pointing</b> up on their hats. Through the 19th century, the crescent on the state flag also appeared with <b>the</b> <b>tips</b> <b>pointing</b> up, {{and it was not}} until the 20th century that it was turned on its side to resemble a crescent moon. The mystery of its original meaning is still unresolved, and the crescent as it appears on the modern state flag is normally interpreted as a moon.|$|R
25|$|In 1905, it was {{reported}} that Jean Lanfray, a Swiss farmer, murdered his family and attempted to take his own life after drinking absinthe. The fact that Lanfray was an alcoholic who had consumed considerable quantities of wine and brandy prior to drinking two glasses of absinthe was overlooked or ignored, therefore placing the blame for the murders solely on absinthe. The Lanfray murders were <b>the</b> <b>tipping</b> <b>point</b> in this hotly debated topic, and a subsequent petition to ban absinthe in Switzerland collected more than 82,000 signatures. A referendum was subsequently held on banning the drink on 5 July 1908. After it was approved by voters, the prohibition of absinthe was then written into the Swiss constitution.|$|E

The notion that {{a small group of people}} can influence others and cause them to adopt products, services or behaviors was the subject of another book, The Influentials by Edward Keller and Jonathan Berry. This minority comprises a wide range of people who act as experts in their field and their opinions are highly regarded by their peers.|$|E
