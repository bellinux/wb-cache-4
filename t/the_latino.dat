5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Latino</b> {{community}} was deeply {{affected by the}} news of Selena's death; some people traveled thousands of miles to visit her home, boutiques, and the crime scene, while churches with large congregations of Latinos held prayers in her name. All major television networks in the United States interrupted their regular programming to break the news. The public's reaction to Selena's death was compared to those that followed the deaths of John Lennon, Elvis Presley, and John F. Kennedy. Some Americans who were unaware of the singer and her popularity criticized the attention she and her murder received from both the media and <b>the</b> <b>Latino</b> community. Radio personality Howard Stern mocked Selena's murder, burial, and her mourners and criticized her music, playing her songs with gunshots in the background, causing an uproar among <b>the</b> <b>Latino</b> population. On April 12, 1995—two weeks after her death—then-Texas governor George W. Bush declared her birthday Selena Day in Texas. Some Americans were offended because Selena Day that year coincided with Easter.|$|E

Although Latino Review was later asked to remove their review, numerous other websites and blogs published their own critiques of the script.|$|E

5|$|The city's {{population}} {{became more}} diverse {{after the end}} of World War II, when a seemingly robust steel industry attracted thousands of workers.
