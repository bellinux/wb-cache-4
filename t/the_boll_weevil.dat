5|$|Beetles are {{prominent}} in human culture, from the sacred scarabs of ancient Egypt to beetlewing art and use as pets or fighting insects for entertainment and gambling. Many beetle groups are brightly and attractively coloured making them objects of collection and decorative displays. Over 300 species {{are used as}} food, mostly as larvae; species widely consumed include mealworms and rhinoceros beetle larvae. However, the major impact of beetles on human life is as agricultural, forestry, and horticultural pests. Serious pests include <b>the</b> <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> of cotton, the Colorado potato beetle, the coconut hispine beetle, and the mountain pine beetle. Most beetles, however, do not cause economic damage and many, such as the lady beetles and dung beetles are beneficial by helping to control insect pests.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> (Anthonomus grandis) is a beetle which {{feeds on}} cotton buds and flowers. Thought to be native to Central Mexico, it {{migrated}} into the United States from Mexico {{in the late}} 19th century and had infested all U.S. cotton-growing areas by the 1920s, devastating the industry and the people working in the American South. During the late 20th century, it became a serious pest in South America as well. Since 1978, <b>the</b> <b>Boll</b> <b>Weevil</b> Eradication Program in the U.S. allowed full-scale cultivation to resume in many regions.|$|E
25|$|Other {{avenues of}} control {{that have been}} {{explored}} include weevil-resistant strains of cotton, the parasitic wasp Catolaccus grandis, the fungus Beauveria bassiana, and the Chilo iridescent virus.

25|$|Until the mid-20th century, Florida was {{the least}} populous Southern state. In 1900, its {{population}} was only 528,542, of whom nearly 44% were African American, the same proportion as before the Civil War. <b>The</b> <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> devastated cotton crops.|$|E
25|$|The Alabama Extension Service {{initially}} {{focused on}} improving the bleak economic prospects of Alabama farmers, {{most of whom}} raised cotton under the persistent threat of <b>the</b> <b>boll</b> <b>weevil.</b> As funds permitted, home demonstration agents were employed to provide farm wives with practical assistance with food preservation and other home-related improvements.|$|E

25|$|Musicians of the state's Delta {{region were}} {{historically}} significant {{to the development}} of the blues. Although by the end of the 19th century, two-thirds of the farm owners were black, continued low prices for cotton and national financial pressures resulted in most of them losing their land. More problems built up with <b>the</b> <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> infestation, when thousands of agricultural jobs were lost.|$|E
25|$|After the Civil War, {{the state}} refused {{for years to}} build human capital by fully educating all its citizens. In addition, the {{reliance}} on agriculture grew increasingly costly as the state suffered loss of cotton crops due to the devastation of <b>the</b> <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> in the early 20th century, devastating floods in 1912–1913 and 1927, collapse of cotton prices after 1920, and drought in 1930.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} decades of the 20th century, {{thousands}} of African Americans left Louisiana in the Great Migration north to industrial cities for jobs and education, and to escape Jim Crow society and lynchings. <b>The</b> <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> infestation and agricultural problems cost many sharecroppers and farmers their jobs. The mechanization of agriculture also reduced the need for laborers. Beginning in the 1940s, blacks went West to California for jobs in its expanding defense industries.|$|E
40|$|Studies were {{conducted}} in Phoenix AZ, to determine <b>the</b> development of <b>boll</b> <b>weevil,</b> Anthonomus grandis Boheman, infestations in late - season cotton <b>bolls,</b> <b>the</b> pattern of <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> emergence, and survival /mortality in <b>the</b> <b>bolls.</b> <b>Boll</b> <b>weevils</b> emerged from <b>bolls</b> buried in moist vermiculite {{over a period of}} 232 to 239 days, from 29 January to 2 August.

25|$|Although {{the rhetoric}} {{surrounding}} lynchings frequently suggested {{they were to}} protect the virtue and safety of white women, the actions basically arose out of white attempts to maintain domination in a rapidly changing society and their fears of social change. Victims were the scapegoats for peoples' attempts to control agriculture, labor and education, {{as well as a}} reaction to economic stresses during downturns when cotton prices dropped, and larger disasters such as <b>the</b> <b>boll</b> <b>weevil.</b>|$|E
25|$|The insect {{crossed the}} Rio Grande near Brownsville, Texas, {{to enter the}} United States from Mexico in 1892 and reached southeastern Alabama in 1909. By the mid-1920s, it had entered all cotton-growing regions in the U.S., {{travelling}} 40 to 160 miles per year. It remains the most destructive cotton pest in North America. Since <b>the</b> <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> entered the United States, it has cost U.S. cotton producers about $13 billion, and in recent times about $300 million per year.|$|E

50|$|The team {{finished}} {{with a record of}} 71-59 in its debut season in 1905, behind the Fort Worth Panthers by just a half game for second place in the league. After Temple got {{off to a slow start}} in the following season and Temple manager Con Lucid resigned, owner J.E. Edens sold the team to the Temple Baseball Association, a local stock company headed by Temple mayor Fred P. Hamill, who replaced Lucid with manager Fred Moore. With the Texas League struggling financially, it decided in mid-season to drop <b>the</b> <b>Boll</b> <b>Weevils.</b> <b>The</b> Temple Baseball Association, having only recently spent $3,000 to buy the team, filed an unsuccessful lawsuit against the league. In 1907 the Texas League took on several teams from the South Texas League and resurrected another incarnation of <b>the</b> <b>Boll</b> <b>Weevils</b> with players being contributed by the other teams. Due in part to poor performance and lacking fan support, 1907 would be their final season.|$|R
25|$|Boll weevils {{begin to}} die at {{temperatures}} {{at or below}} −5°C (23°F). Research at the University of Missouri indicates they cannot survive {{more than an hour}} at −15°C (5°F). The insulation offered by leaf litter, crop residues, and snow may enable the beetle to survive when air temperatures drop to these levels. <b>The</b> <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> lays its eggs inside buds and ripening bolls (fruits) of the cotton plants. The adult insect has a long snout, is grayish color, and is usually less than 6mm long.|$|E
25|$|In 1893, Dothan {{secured a}} stop on the first {{railroad}} to be built in the region. This development brought new prosperity and growth, as local farmers had a means to market and transport their produce. The pine forests were harvested for turpentine and wood, which was transformed into ship masts, lumber and other wood products. As the pines were cut and land subsequently cleared, cotton was cultivated as a staple of the local economy. The crops were devastated by <b>the</b> <b>boll</b> <b>weevil</b> in the early 1900s.|$|E
25|$|Historically, in North America, one of {{the most}} {{economically}} destructive pests in cotton production has been <b>the</b> <b>boll</b> <b>weevil.</b> Due to the US Department of Agriculture's highly successful Boll Weevil Eradication Program (BWEP), this pest has been eliminated from cotton in most of the United States. This program, along with the introduction of genetically engineered Bt cotton (which contains a bacterial gene that codes for a plant-produced protein that is toxic to a number of pests such as cotton bollworm and pink bollworm), has allowed a reduction in the use of synthetic insecticides.|$|E
