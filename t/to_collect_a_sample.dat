5|$|The person’s throat {{is first}} swabbed <b>to</b> <b>collect</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> of mucus. In most RSTs, this mucus sample is then {{exposed to a}} reagent {{containing}} antibodies that will bind specifically to a GAS antigen. A positive result is signified by a certain visible reaction. There are three major types of RST: First, a latex fixation test, which {{was developed in the}} 1980s and is largely obsolete. It employs latex beads covered with antigens that will visibly agglutinate around GAS antibodies if these are present. Second, a lateral flow test, which is currently the most widely used RST. The sample is applied to a strip of nitrocellulose film and, if GAS antigens are present, these will migrate along the film to form a visible line of antigen bound to labeled antibodies. Third, optical immunoassay is the newest and more expensive test. It involves mixing the sample with labeled antibodies and then with a special substrate on a film which changes colour to signal {{the presence or absence of}} GAS antigen.|$|E

25|$|Genetic {{tests are}} {{performed}} on {{a sample of}} blood, hair, skin, amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds a fetus during pregnancy), or other tissue. For example, a medical procedure called a buccal smear uses a small brush or cotton swab <b>to</b> <b>collect</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> of cells from the inside surface of the cheek. Alternatively, {{a small amount of}} saline mouthwash may be swished in the mouth to collect the cells. The sample is sent to a laboratory where technicians look for specific changes in chromosomes, DNA, or proteins, depending on the suspected disorders, often using DNA sequencing. The laboratory reports the test results in writing to a person's doctor or genetic counselor.|$|E

2500|$|Developed by Professor of Genetics Sir Alec Jeffreys, {{the process}} {{begins with a}} sample of an individual's DNA (typically called a [...] "reference sample"). A common method of {{collecting}} a reference sample is the use of a buccal swab, which is easy, non-invasive and cheap. When this is not available (e.g. because a court order is needed but not obtainable) other methods may need to be used <b>to</b> <b>collect</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> of blood, saliva, semen, vaginal lubrication, or other appropriate fluid or tissue from personal items (e.g. a toothbrush, razor) or from stored samples (e.g. banked sperm or biopsy tissue). Samples obtained from blood relatives (related by birth, not marriage) can provide an indication of an individual's profile, as could human remains that had been previously profiled.|$|E
50|$|DFS {{may also}} be used <b>to</b> <b>collect</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> of graph nodes. However, {{incomplete}} DFS, similarly to incomplete BFS, is biased towards nodes of high degree.|$|E

They are large, and prey on the larvae of other mosquitoes. <b>To</b> <b>collect</b> <b>a</b> field <b>sample,</b> <b>a</b> long-handled dipper causes a minimum of disturbance to the larvae. An area sampler is used after the dipper which catches more.|$|R
25|$|Pollen {{analysis}} has allowed archaeologists to analyze vegetation selectively cultivated by area residents, the “native vegetation” {{of a particular}} area, and allow archaeologists to map out land use over time (which can be ascertained from weeds). But <b>collecting</b> <b>a</b> suitable <b>sample</b> {{is not all that}} easy. Failure <b>to</b> <b>collect</b> <b>a</b> suitable <b>sample</b> can be due in part to not sampling from areas where suitable pollen samples can be gathered (e.g. lakes and bogs, sites that were sufficiently exposed to air-borne pollen, sites that had both a long exposure to air and are deeply buried into the ground), or because pollen is vulnerable to destruction by the oxidation process or soil microbes such as bacteria and fungi, it negatively impacts <b>an</b> archaeologist’s ability <b>to</b> <b>collect</b> <b>a</b> suitable pollen <b>sample.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{inflammation}} may {{be caused}} by infection with viruses, bacteria, or other microorganisms, and less commonly by certain drugs. Meningitis can be life-threatening because of the inflammation's proximity to the brain and spinal cord; therefore, the condition is classified as a medical emergency. A lumbar puncture can diagnose or exclude meningitis. A needle is inserted into the spinal canal <b>to</b> <b>collect</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample</b> of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), that envelops the brain and spinal cord.

It is done by inserting a needle through the skin below the external occipital protuberance into the cisterna magna and is an alternative to lumbar puncture. Indications for its use are limited. Subarachnoid hemorrhage and direct puncture of brain tissue {{are the most common}} major complications. Fluoroscopic guidance decreases the risk for complications.

50|$|Koenig pauses <b>to</b> <b>collect</b> <b>a</b> <b>sample.</b> Chipping at the wall, {{he feels}} an {{unexpected}} {{hand on his}} shoulder, turns—and beholds the doppelgänger.

Before leaving, it removes its mirror-image jacket and dons Koenig's. As it boards the Eagle, Carter notes the mysterious malfunction has resolved itself. Maya calls, requesting they postpone lift-off for her to get further readings from their sensors. The replica brusquely refuses and they depart.|$|E
