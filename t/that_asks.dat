25|$|Odd cycle {{transversal}} is an NP-complete algorithmic problem <b>that</b> <b>asks,</b> given a graphG=(V,E) and a numberk, {{whether there}} exists a set ofk vertices whose removal fromG would cause the resulting graph to be bipartite. The problem is fixed-parameter tractable, meaning {{that there is an}} algorithm whose running time can be bounded by a polynomial function {{of the size of the}} graph multiplied by a larger function of k. More specifically, the time for this algorithm is O(3k'mn), although this was not stated in that paper.|$|E
25|$|The {{assembly}} of Fukushima Prefecture {{has adopted a}} motion <b>that</b> <b>asks</b> for the scrapping of all 10 nuclear reactors in the prefecture. The majority vote was on Thursday 20 October 2011, after the petition was submitted by a civic group in June. The petition urged the decommissioning of all reactors run by TEPCO in the prefecture—six at the Daiichi plant and four at the Daini plant. This {{was the first time}} in Japan that a prefecture hosting nuclear plants has voted to adopt such a petition. Although TEPCO was planning to decommission four reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi plant, TEPCO still had detailed plans to exploit the remaining six reactors.|$|E
25|$|Cultural {{resources}} management has, however, been criticized. CRM {{is conducted}} by private companies that bid for projects by submitting proposals outlining {{the work to}} be done and an expected budget. It is not unheard-of for the agency responsible for the construction to simply choose the proposal <b>that</b> <b>asks</b> for the least funding. CRM archaeologists face considerable time pressure, often being forced to complete their work in a fraction of the time that might be allotted for a purely scholarly endeavour. Compounding the time pressure is the vetting process of site reports that are required (in the US) to be submitted by CRM firms to the appropriate State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO). From the SHPO's perspective there is to be no difference between a report submitted by a CRM firm operating under a deadline, and a multi-year academic project. The end result is that for a Cultural Resource Management archaeologist to be successful, they must be able to produce academic quality documents at a corporate world pace.|$|E

25|$|A {{prayer of}} {{petition}} is {{a request to}} God <b>that</b> <b>asks</b> him to fulfill a need. By prayer of petition, Catholics acknowledge their dependence on God. This expression {{is not intended to}} instruct or direct God what to do, but to appeal to his goodness for the things we need; and the appeal is necessary, not because He is ignorant of our needs or sentiments, but to give definite form to our desires, to concentrate our whole attention on what we have to recommend to him, to help us appreciate our close personal relation with him. The expression need not be external or vocal; internal or mental is sufficient. The prayer of petition is at its heart an Act of Faith in that the one praying must believe first, in the existence of God; and second, that God is both willing and able to grant the petition. The Catechism states that asking forgiveness, coupled with trusting humility, should be the first movement of a prayer of petition. Jesus said to bring our every need to God in his name and assures that “whatever you ask the Father in my name he will give you.” (John 16:23) Through petition one can ask for God's help with every need no matter how great or small. According to the Catechism, Christ is glorified by what we ask the Father in his name.|$|E

[...] Julian Sancton of Vanity Fair wrote, [...] "There are two movies in Up in the Air: one about a guy who's flying around the country firing people, and one about a commitment-phobe who's flying away from responsibility and a shot at true love, as embodied by Farmiga. There is no attempt to braid these two threads together, and that's where the movie feels unsatisfying." [...] J. Hoberman of The Village Voice wrote, [...] "Like Juno, Up in the Air conjures a troubling reality and then wishes it away. The filmmakers have peeked into the abyss and averted their eyes... warns that you can't go home again – and then, full of false cheer and false consciousness, pretends you can." ...|$|E

40|$|Contact {{hypersensitivity}} (CHS) {{is a form}} of delayed-type hypersensitivity {{triggered by}} the response to reactive haptens (sensitization) and subsequent challenge (elicitation). Here, we show <b>that</b> <b>ASK</b> 1 promotes CHS and <b>that</b> suppression of <b>ASK</b> 1 during the elicitation phase is sufficient to attenuate CHS. ASK 1 knockout (KO) mice exhibited impaired 2, 4 -dinitrofluorobenzene (DNFB) -induced CHS. The suppression of ASK 1 activity during the elicitation phase through a chemical genetic approach or a specific inhibitory compound significantly reduced the CHS response to a level similar to <b>that</b> observed in <b>ASK</b> 1 KO mice. The reduced response was concomitant with the strong inhibition of production of IL- 17, a cytokine that {{plays an important role in}} CHS and other inflammatory diseases, from sensitized lymph node cells. These results suggest <b>that</b> <b>ASK</b> 1 is relevant to the overall CHS response during the elicitation phase and <b>that</b> <b>ASK</b> 1 may be a promising therapeutic target for allergic contact dermatitis and other IL- 17 -related inflammatory diseases...|$|R
