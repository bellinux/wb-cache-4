25|$|For {{traditional}} art, {{there is}} little difference between the way night and day are illustrated and the colors that are used. For instance in early Rajput (also called Rajasthani) paintings, the only way <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>that</b> the painting is a night scene is through the presence of torches or candles. Later in the Rajput period, both somewhat influenced by Western art, night scenes were painted dramatically with shadows and Mughal paintings used chiaroscuro for shading.|$|E

The proposed amendment to the motion (Supplementary Order Paper 182) was defeated 83 votes opposed to 33 votes in favour.|$|E
500|$|Reiner and Kovacs have {{suggested}} that the common interpretation of the poem, that the Pleiades have set, is incorrect: they argue that the poem should be emended <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>that</b> the Pleiades are [...] "in mid-heaven".

Eliot said: [...] "It is difficult for us <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>that</b> essay without reflecting that if Poe plotted out his poem with such calculation, he might have taken a little more pains over it: the result hardly does credit to the method." [...] Biographer Joseph Wood Krutch described the essay as [...] "a rather highly ingenious exercise in the art of rationalization".|$|E

500|$|Bunker {{arrived in}} Riyadh on March 6. Faisal refused Bunker's offer, {{which was also}} hitched to pledges of reform. The {{original}} instructions for Operation Hard-surface were that American planes would [...] "attack and destroy" [...] any intruders over Saudi air space, but were later changed <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>that</b> the Saudis could defend themselves if attacked. Bunker evidently stuck to the original formula and stressed that if only Faisal would halt his aid to the royalists, the US would be able pressure Nasser to withdraw. Faisal eventually accepted the offer, and Bunker went on to meet with Nasser in Beirut, where the Egyptian President repeated the assurance he had given Bunche.|$|E
500|$|Miles Morales {{was created}} by writer Brian Michael Bendis and artist Sara Pichelli. Bendis' {{thoughts}} about the character, {{and the way he}} looked in his first appearance, were heavily influenced by African American actor Donald Glover's appearance in Spider-Man pajamas in [...] "Anthropology 101", the second season premiere of the television comedy series Community. This was a reference to an unsuccessful online campaign that attempted to secure Glover an audition for the lead role in the 2012 film The Amazing Spider-Man. Bendis said of Glover, [...] "He looked fantastic! I saw him in the costume and thought, 'I would like <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>that</b> book.' So I was glad I was writing that book." ...|$|E
500|$|During Perón's time, {{children}} born to unmarried parents {{did not have the}} same legal rights as those born to married parents. Biographer Julie M. Taylor, professor of anthropology at Rice University, has said that Evita was well aware of the pain of being born [...] "illegitimate." [...] Taylor speculates that Evita's awareness of this may have influenced her decision to have the law changed so that [...] "illegitimate" [...] children would henceforth be referred to as [...] "natural" [...] children. Upon her death, the Argentine public was told that Evita was only 30. The discrepancy was meant to dovetail with Evita's earlier tampering with her birth certificate. After becoming the first lady in 1946, Evita had her birth records altered <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>that</b> she had been born to married parents, and placed her birth date three years later, making herself younger.|$|E

500|$|Yard {{believed}} that eligible national parks {{had to be}} scenically stunning. [...] He noted in his 1919 volume The Book of the National Parks that the major characteristic of almost all national parks was that their scenery had been forged by geological or biological processes. [...] He wrote, [...] "e shall not really enjoy our possession of the grandest scenery in the world until we realize that scenery is the written page of the History of Creation, and until we learn <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>that</b> page." [...] Yard's standards also insisted upon [...] "complete conservation", meaning avoidance of commercialism and industrialization. [...] Often referring to parks as [...] "American masterpieces", he sought {{to protect them from}} economic activities such as timber cutting and mineral extracting. [...] In such, Yard often advocated the preservation of [...] "wilderness" [...] conditions in America's national parks.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to {{his role in the}} television series, Dale's comic book counterpart is among the longest surviving characters in the series, and he enters into a sexual relationship with Andrea. Kirkman asserted that it was necessary for writers to distance the development of Dale's television character from that in the comic: [...] "I have talked many times how much I like the difference between the comics and the show. There are going to be big plot lines that we may not necessarily get to, like the romance between Dale and Andrea. If you think you really want <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>that</b> story line, that's available in the comics, and I highly recommend you pick those up. The show {{is always going to be}} a different animal and the decision to kill Dale off was a big one and it wasn't one that was made lightly." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{crew of the}} USS Bainbridge, the Arleigh Burke-class {{guided missile}} {{destroyer}} which participated in the rescue of Richard Phillips from the hijacked MV Maersk Alabama, contacted the creators of South Park to commend them on the episode. Ensign Jonathan Sieg, the Bainbridge public relations officer, wrote: [...] "Pretty much everyone onboard our ship — from Captain to seaman — is {{a huge fan of}} South Park, and when we heard about the episode Fatbeard, as you can imagine, we were thrilled and very interested to watch." [...] Sieg requested copies of the episode because the streaming online video was difficult to watch on the ship, and the South Park staff in return sent them a care package including several copies of the episode. On the official South Park Studios FAQ, they wrote back, [...] "No, sir, thank you.

500|$|Assessments of Earl Cardigan {{have varied}} from era to era. The 9th {{edition of the}} Encyclopædia Britannica noted that his actions at Balaclava had become [...] "the subject of much controversy, some critics having an eye only to the splendid daring and unquestioning {{obedience}} to orders, and others seeing only a foolhardy and unjustifiable throwing away of valuable lives" [...] where the 11th edition published just before World War I rephrased the passage <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>that</b> [...] "Cardigan and his men alike have been credited by the bitterest critics of the charge with splendid daring and unquestioning obedience to orders". Following the world wars, the historian Cecil Woodham-Smith's 1953 The Reason Why seriously impugned the earl; Saul David's hostile assessment is entitled simply The Homicidal Earl. Colonel Calthorpe's Letters from a Staff Officer in the Crimea has a modern reprint as Cadogan's Crimea. Donald Thomas's 1975 biography Cardigan: The Hero of Balaclava provides a more sympathetic portrayal. Terry Brighton's Hell Riders: The Truth about the Charge of the Light Brigade gives a critical account of Cardigan as a brigade commander but finds him in no way {{to blame for the}} charge.|$|E
500|$|Though {{a modern}} {{synopsis}} {{has not been}} published, the original synopsis was published in The Moving Picture World on December 3, 1910. It states: [...] "Captain Smith sails away on his vessel for a trip around South America, through the Pacific, leaving behind him his wife and little girl, whom he dearly loves. The ship is reported lost with all on board, {{with the exception of}} a cabin boy who is picked up in mid ocean. The captain's wife struggles to support her child, but owing to a rapidly failing health she fights a losing battle with poverty. One by one her valued possessions find their way to the pawnshop, where the kind-hearted old pawnbroker, Levy, becomes interested in the sad-faced woman and pretty child, who never seem able to redeem any of their possessions. The last article of value left in Mrs. Smith's possession is her wedding ring, and Levy refuses to take this. Instead he offers her help, which the widow proudly refuses. She insists that she can go out and get work. Levy, seeing that he can help in no other way, offers to care for little Marie, and to this the mother finally gives her consent. Half in jest, Levy gives the mother a pawn ticket for the little girl, which he fills out <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>that</b> 'a precious jewel, a value beyond price,' has been left with him and can be redeemed 'at any time.' The mother leaves the little one in Levy's care and upon reaching home and finding herself mortally stricken, she puts the pawn ticket he has given her in an envelope which she entrusts to a friendly janitoress, to be given into no other hands than those of her husband should it be that he is not dead.|$|E
500|$|Variety {{reported}} in May 2005 that Grace was in negotiations to play X-Men character Kitty Pryde in the 2006 film , but in July, auditions were reportedly being held for her replacement. The role ultimately went to Ellen Page, and Grace later revealed {{that she had}} never been contacted about the role and was surprised <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>that</b> she was up for the part in question. Grace's next role was in the 2007 independent film Suburban Girl, alongside Sarah Michelle Gellar and Alec Baldwin. In 2007, she starred in The Jane Austen Book Club, based on Karen Joy Fowler's novel of the same name. She is a fan of Jane Austen and had read Fowler's novel when it was released in 2004. When she was given the film's script, she met with the director Robin Swicord, with whom she says she [...] "geeked out", and was given the role of Allegra, an openly lesbian 20-year-old. After the filming of The Jane Austen Book Club was completed, Grace briefly returned to Hawaii to shoot a guest spot on the Lost season 3 episode [...] "Exposé". She starred in the 2008 thriller film Taken with Liam Neeson, who {{was at the top of}} a list of male actors Grace wished to work with that she had written just two months before she was cast. She played the lead in Simon Fellows' 2009 Malice in Wonderland, a modern adaptation of Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. In 2010, Grace starred in the drama Flying Lessons, and appeared opposite Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz in James Mangold's film Knight and Day, as well as in Faster, with Dwayne Johnson. Grace's busy schedule prevented her from returning as Shannon in [...] "LA X", the season premiere for Losts sixth and final season, but she eventually returned for the series finale [...] "The End".

2500|$|At Yellowstone National Park in 1903, the Northern Pacific Railroad {{constructed}} the Old Faithful Inn. This six-story resort {{was in the}} Swiss Chalet-Norway Villa tradition, but executed in a very western frontier manner. The exterior of the log frame structure was sheathed with shingles, and the building was heavily articulated with logwork piers and corners. Two stories of projecting dormers protruded from the enormous main gable, which was the dominant architectural feature. The combination of the logwork, shingles, and form resulted in a masterful structure. The Inn was designed by Robert Reamer, {{who is said to}} have [...] "sketched the plans while coming shakily out of a monumental submersion in malt, and some authorities claim to be able <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>that</b> fact in its unique contours." ...|$|E
