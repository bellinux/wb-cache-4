5|$|Much {{uncertainty}} remains, especially {{regarding the}} size of limitanei regiments, {{as can be seen}} by the wide ranges of the size estimates. It is also possible, if not likely, that unit strengths changed {{over the course of the}} 4th century. For example, it appears that Valentinian I split about 150 comitatus units with his brother and co-emperor Valens. The resulting units may have been just half the strength of the parent units (unless a major recruitment drive was held to bring <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>up</b> to original strength).|$|E

Carlos sacrifices himself by plowing his truck into the zombie mob and blowing <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>up,</b> giving Alice and Claire time to load survivors into the helicopter. Alice decides to stay behind. Ordered by Wesker to terminate Isaacs, Slater arrives {{with a group of}} commandos and finds the scientist locked in his lab, injecting himself with massive doses of anti-virus in an attempt to counteract the infection. Slater reveals that his employment is terminated and shoots him, triggering his mutation into a monstrous Tyrant. Despite retaining his intelligence and thought, Isaacs kills Slater and all the facility employees, but is confined to the lab's lower levels.|$|E
25|$|An easy {{to program}} {{approximate}} approach, {{that relies on}} the central limit theorem, is as follows: generate 12 uniform U(0,1) deviates, add <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>up,</b> and subtract 6 – the resulting random variable will have approximately standard normal distribution. In truth, the distribution will be Irwin–Hall, which is a 12-section eleventh-order polynomial approximation to the normal distribution. This random deviate will have a limited range of (−6,6).|$|E

500|$|Henry Jackman {{returned}} from Winter Soldier to score the sequel. He found {{the movie to}} be tonally different from the previous one, which necessitated a much more symphonic and orchestral score. This culminates in the final fight between Captain America, Winter Soldier, and Iron Man, the music for which Jackman described as [...] "somewhat operatic and ... almost classical in its style". Though Jackman reprised and developed his themes for Captain America and the Winter Soldier from the previous film, and introduced motifs for the new characters Spider-Man, Black Panther, and Zemo, he was wary of pushing the audience {{to one side of}} the central conflict or the other by using character-specific music; Jackman composed a new main theme for the film to represent the Civil War, [...] "a generic theme to balance everything out", [...] "toward which all the characters can gravitate. It wrapped <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>up</b> and it helped to bind the movie together rather than do endless disparate themes." [...] Jackman also wrote a thriller theme that appears whenever the mystery surrounding Zemo's plan is explored. This was inspired by the works of Jerry Goldsmith. The score was released on a soundtrack album by Hollywood Records on May 6, 2016.|$|E
500|$|Lennon {{later said}} he [...] "couldn't {{remember}} any of the words but it didn't matter—I just made <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>up</b> and we made a great wonderful noise." [...] Carl Perkins said to Lennon after the {{show that he was}} [...] "so beautiful you made me cry." [...] A bootleg album of the concert appeared, under the title JL-YO-EC, thanks to an audience recording, which was released {{a few months after the}} official album. After Lennon's death, the album, along with seven other Lennon albums, was reissued by EMI as part of a box set, which was released in the UK on 15 June 1981. The album was reissued in the US in 1982, on Capitol, and again in the same country on the same label, in 1986. The album was originally scheduled to appear on CD for the first time in June 1989, but the plan was scrapped. Ono, with the help of Rob Stevens from Quad Recording, supervised a remixing of Live Peace in Toronto 1969 for its compact disc issue, released on 1 May 1995. Two of the remixed tracks feature a variation in Ono's vocals: while [...] "Dizzy Miss Lizzy" [...] has additional backing vocals from Ono, [...] "Money" [...] has fewer backing vocals from Ono. The CD booklet included a 1995 calendar, mimicking the original release. The album is also available from the audiophile label Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab., utilizing the same remix. The booklet for the 2006 Mobile Fidelity release also included a current calendar.|$|E

"Why, jest to show 'em we HAVE got money, {{and could}} buy <b>'em</b> <b>all</b> <b>up</b> {{if we wanted}} to," [...] {{returned}} Maggie, sticking boldly to her guns, albeit with a vague conviction that her fire was weakened through elevation, and somewhat alarmed at the deliberation of the enemy.|$|R

[...] "I thought the whole Revolution and {{subsequent}} history revolved round it, and that it gave us all liberty, equality, and fraternity at a clip. But the Lord always finds some odd jobs to look after next day, and I guess He didn't clear <b>'em</b> <b>all</b> <b>up</b> at Bunker's Hill." ...|$|R
2500|$|Stilwell {{was born}} on March 19, 1883, in Palatka, Florida. His parents were Doctor Benjamin Stilwell and Mary A. Peene. Stilwell was an eighth {{generation}} descendant of an English colonist who arrived in America in 1638, whose descendants remained in New York up through the birth of Stilwell's father. Named for a family friend, {{as well as the}} doctor who delivered him, Joseph Stilwell, known as Warren by his family, grew up in Yonkers, New York, under a strict regimen from his father that included an emphasis on religion. Stilwell later admitted to his daughter that he picked up criminal instincts due to [...] "...being forced to go to Church and Sunday School, and seeing how little real good religion does anybody, I advise passing <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>up</b> and using common sense instead." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Such was the {{experience}} of Bouzes. As for Belisarius, though {{he was convicted of}} none of the charges, the Emperor, at the insistence of the Empress, relieved him of the command which he held and appointed Martinus to be General of the East in his stead, and instructed him to distribute the spearmen and guards of Belisarius and all his servants who were notable men in war to certain of the officers and Palace eunuchs. So these cast lots for them and divided <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>up</b> among themselves, arms and all, as each happened to win them. And many of those who had been his friends or had previously served him in some way he forbade to visit Belisarius any longer. And he went about, a sorry and incredible sight, Belisarius a private citizen in Byzantium, practically alone, always pensive and gloomy, and dreading a death by violence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Concerning {{the central}} {{conflict}} of the film, Jackman {{found that he}} was in [...] "constant danger of tipping it too much" [...] and pushing the audience to one side or the other, so he composed a new main theme for the film to represent that Civil War, which he called [...] "a generic theme to balance everything out", and [...] "a narrative theme toward which all the characters can gravitate. It wrapped <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>up</b> and it helped to bind the movie together rather than do endless disparate themes." [...] The second major theme in the film is a thriller theme, that appears whenever the central mystery surrounding several character's pasts and Zemo's plan is teased or explored. It consists of a flute motif tied to the Winter Soldier's Russian handlers and a rising adagio that represents Zemo's twisted determination, and was inspired by the works of Jerry Goldsmith. Of the character themes from previous films that Jackman did use, [...] "where appropriate", he evolved them to fit the tone and style of the new score. Captain America's theme could not be too prominent or heroic, as that would suggest that he was the hero of the film when the Russos were trying to create an ambiguity surrounding the main conflict—this does change throughout the film though, becoming more heroic when Captain America [...] "turns out to be right all along". For the Winter Soldier, Jackman took a [...] "rising string rhyme" [...] that was buried underneath [...] "the chaos and the industrial stuff" [...] in the end of the character's suite from The Winter Soldier, and developed that into a much more symphonic theme for the character, in keeping with his much more human portrayal in this film.|$|E

6000|$|... "Before going further," [...] {{continued}} the captain, pushing in his cup, [...] "let's {{have some more}} o' that brew to wet my whistle.
