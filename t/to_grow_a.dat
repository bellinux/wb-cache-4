5|$|As a prisoner, he battled starvation, {{receiving}} {{only a small}} meal of mush {{served in}} a tin cup—a utensil he kept {{for the rest of}} his life. With a weight below , Buckles developed beriberi, and led fellow captives in calisthenics to counter the effects of imprisonment. Their captors showed little mercy, but Buckles was allowed <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>a</b> small garden, which he often used to help feed children who were imprisoned there.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage {{was most}} likely domesticated somewhere in Europe before 1000 BC, {{although}} savoys were not developed until the 16th century. By the Middle Ages, cabbage had become a prominent part of European cuisine. Cabbage heads are generally picked {{during the first year}} of the plant's life cycle, but plants intended for seed are allowed <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>a</b> second year, and must be kept separated from other cole crops to prevent cross-pollination. Cabbage is prone to several nutrient deficiencies, as well as to multiple pests, and bacterial and fungal diseases.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Overton {{was known}} to sit in his bases' chapel in silence for {{extended}} periods of time, not praying, to calm his nerves. He also began <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>a</b> mustache, though he professes not to be superstitious. Overton would continue to grow this mustache until immediately before his final flight, when he shaved it off. He also believed any number with a three in it, including the number 13, was lucky.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, {{since then}} the tulip has become indelibly {{associated}} with the Netherlands and all things Dutch. {{it was during this}} period that the tulipiere, a ceramic vase for growing tulips indoors was devised, and the Golden Age of Dutch Painting was replete with images of tulips. Although tulip festivals are held around the world in the spring, the most famous of these is the display at Keukenhof. One of the better-known novels on tulips is The Black Tulip by Alexandre Dumas, père in 1850, dealing with a contest <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>a</b> black tulip in late seventeenth-century Haarlem.|$|E
5|$|Robin (Cobie Smulders) {{suggests}} Ted {{give up on}} Stella {{and instead}} focus on Abby. Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) agrees, as he made an appointment with Stella to check what she was like, and discovered she had a condition where she is only attracted to men with mustaches. Although Ted does not believe him, he still tries <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>a</b> mustache, which Stella laughs at (a year earlier, Barney had made a ten-dollar bet with Ted {{that he could get}} him <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>a</b> mustache). Upset, Ted says he gives up, but Lily (Alyson Hannigan) tells him to try again, as Stella is interested in him, though she says she has not been to see her. It is then revealed that Marshall (Jason Segel) had gone to see Stella to talk up Ted, and found out Stella had a crush on him. The book ended up belonging to Marshall. Happy that Stella is interested in him, Ted asks her out after his last session, but she says she does not have time for dating because she has a daughter.|$|E
5|$|After a brief posting to Point Cook {{in early}} 1940, Cresswell {{undertook}} the instructors' course at Central Flying School in Camden, New South Wales. He then became {{an instructor at}} No.2 Service Flying Training School, which was formed at Wagga Wagga in July and operated Avro Ansons and CAC Wirraways. The school's commander, Frederick Scherger, advised Cresswell <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>a</b> moustache to overcome his youthful appearance. He was promoted to flight lieutenant in January 1941. Following the bombing of Darwin by Japanese forces on 19February 1942, Cresswell was posted to Williamtown as a liaison officer with the 9th Squadron of the US 49th Pursuit Group (later the 49th Fighter Group), which operated P-40 Kittyhawks and would shortly transfer to Darwin to provide air defence for the North-Western Area.|$|E

5|$|Eastern South Dakota {{is home to}} most of the state's population, and the area's {{fertile soil}} is used <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>a</b> variety of crops. West of the Missouri, {{ranching}} is the predominant agricultural activity, and the economy is more dependent on tourism and defense spending. Most of the Native American reservations are in West River. The Black Hills, a group of low pine-covered mountains sacred to the Sioux, are in the southwest part of the state. Mount Rushmore, a major tourist destination, is there. South Dakota has a temperate continental climate, with four distinct seasons and precipitation ranging from moderate in the east to semi-arid in the west. The state's ecology features species typical of a North American grassland biome.|$|E
5|$|The {{nestling}} period also {{varies by}} species size, with larger species having longer nestling periods. It is also affected by season {{and environmental factors}} and by competition with siblings in species with clutch sizes greater than one. Much {{of what is known}} about the nestling period of some species is dependent on aviary studies– aviary cockatiels can fledge after 5weeks and the large palm cockatoos after 11weeks. During this period, the young become covered in juvenile plumage while remaining in the hollow. Wings and tail feathers are slow to grow initially but more rapid as the primary feathers appear. Nestlings quickly reach about 80–90% of adult weight about two thirds of the time through this period, plateauing before they leave the hollow; they fledge at this weight with wing and tail feathers still <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>a</b> little before reaching adult dimensions. Growth rate of the young, as well as numbers fledged, are adversely impacted by reduced food supply and poor weather conditions.|$|E
5|$|The {{objective}} of Agar.io is <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>a</b> cell on {{a petri dish}} by swallowing both randomly generated pellets (agar), which slightly increases a cell's mass, and smaller cells, without being swallowed by larger cells. The browser version currently holds four game modes: FFA (Free-For-All), Teams, Experimental, and Party. The mobile version of the game includes FFA (Free-For-All) and Rush Mode. The goal {{of the game is}} to obtain the largest cell; players must restart when all their cells are eaten. Players can change their cell's appearance with predefined words, phrases, symbols or skins. The more mass a cell has, the slower it will move. Cells gradually lose a small amount of mass over time.|$|E

5|$|The {{period between}} c. 500 and 1300 saw {{a major change}} in diet that {{affected}} most of Europe. More intense agriculture on an ever-increasing acreage resulted in a shift from animal products, like meat and dairy, to various grains and vegetables as the staple of the majority population. Before the 14th century bread was not as common among the lower classes, especially in the north where wheat was more difficult <b>to</b> <b>grow.</b> <b>A</b> bread-based diet became gradually more common during the 15th century and replaced warm intermediate meals that were porridge- or gruel-based. Leavened bread was more common in wheat-growing regions in the south, while unleavened flatbread of barley, rye or oats remained more common in northern and highland regions, and unleavened flatbread was also common as provisions for troops.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{its initial}} release in Japanese arcades, {{reception}} was mixed. Treasure staff explained {{this was due}} to players expecting a more standard shooter offering but instead being greeted with a different game system that featured more puzzle-like elements rather than the twitch gameplay of bullet-dodging. In 2002, Ikaruga was ported to the Dreamcast in Japan and began <b>to</b> <b>grow</b> <b>a</b> cult following from import gamers worldwide. It was later released in the West in 2003 on the GameCube, receiving positive reviews. Critics praised the graphics as well as the art and sound design. Some criticism was directed towards its difficulty. Most critics felt the unique game design choices were innovative, while some believed they stifled many of the classic shooter elements. Ikaruga was later ported to the Xbox 360 as well as Microsoft Windows. In retrospect, Ikaruga is often {{regarded as one of the}} best shoot 'em ups of all time and one of Treasure's greatest works.|$|E
5|$|When {{facilities}} {{reached their}} maximum capacity, {{the need for}} upgrades became necessary for the airport to continue <b>to</b> <b>grow.</b> <b>A</b> proposal for runway expansion as well as facilities upgrades was developed in 1975, but was subsequently put on hold while a new regional airport was being studied to serve both Roanoke and all of Southwest Virginia. During this time airline deregulation was put in place, and combined with the airport's aging facilities and the phasing out of turbo prop aircraft in favor of jet aircraft by the airlines, the airport's outdated infrastructure and deteriorating condition resulted in a decline {{of service to the}} airport. In order to allow for larger, jet aircraft to land, a runway expansion began in the early 1980s. With the runway extension underway, the airport officially changed its name from Roanoke Municipal Airport to Roanoke Regional Airport in 1983. The runway expansion project was completed in 1985.|$|E
