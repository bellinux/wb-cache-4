500|$|Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune {{gave the}} film <b>two</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>stars</b> out of four, saying [...] "Steve Carell's Slavic inflections as Gru do the trick, as before.

[...] Stephen Whitty of The Star-Ledger gave the film three out four stars, saying [...] "Not only a fun cartoon but– that rare thing– a sequel which actually improves on the original." [...] Elizabeth Weitzman of the New York Daily News gave the film {{two out of}} five stars, saying [...] "Armed with masses of minions and an excess of adorability, Despicable Me 2 is guaranteed to charm anyone who's {{out of school and}} already bored." [...] Soren Anderson of The Seattle Times gave the film <b>two</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>stars</b> out of four, saying [...] "It's fun. It's cheerful. It's lollipop colorful. Best of all, it features lots of minion mischief, which guarantees plenty of laughs. But what it doesn't have is an edge." [...] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film <b>two</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>stars</b> out of four, saying [...] "It feels at times as if Despicable Me 2 actually is The Minions Movie. Coffin and Renaud and returning screenwriters Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio haven't managed {{to come up with a}} dastardly plot to rival the shrinking and stealing of the moon from the previous film." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{critical}} {{response to}} Insurrection was mixed.

[...] The Los Angeles Daily News said that the film had the [...] "bare bones {{of one of those}} pseudo-philosophical political allegories Trek has always done so entertainingly. But the movie blows it." [...] It praised the directing of Jonathan Frakes and the computer generated special effects and gave the film <b>two</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>stars</b> overall. The Daily Herald also gave the film <b>two</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>stars,</b> describing it as a [...] "slickly made" [...] movie with a plot [...] "scaled down to its TV roots", and criticized the [...] "frivolous" [...] romance between Riker and Troi. The Washington Times gave the film one and a half stars, saying that it was [...] "consistently flat-footed and slow on the uptake", and that there was [...] "ramshackle confusion during the climactic scenes".|$|E

[...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday gave the film <b>two</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>stars</b> out of four, saying [...] "Better, or at least sweeter, than the first, with Wiig adding some much-needed romantic charm to the toddler-level humor." [...] Tirdad Derakhshani of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film <b>two</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>stars</b> out of five, saying [...] "If you're looking for quality prepackaged, predigested Hollywood family fun this summer, you {{could do a lot}} worse than Despicable Me 2." [...] Keith Uhlich of Time Out gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "A fleeter film than its predecessor, Despicable Me 2 delights more often than it disappoints." [...] Alonso Duralde of The Wrap gave the film a negative review, saying [...] "The minions are still wacky scene-stealers– and once again, we don't get nearly enough of them– but Gru and his daughters have been blanded down to bad-sitcom level." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today gave the film two out of four stars, saying [...] "With its predecessor having made a whopping $540 million globally, it's no wonder that Universal saw fit to order a sequel. But it's not enough just to trot out legions of minions and cobble together a plot. Audiences deserve more imagination and inventiveness than this wan recycling." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a 'C' grade, saying [...] "By the end, every child in the audience will want his or her own monster-minion toy. Adults will just regret the way that Despicable Me 2 betrays the original film's devotion to bad-guy gaiety." ...|$|E

Keefe felt that the album {{featured}} the sort of [...] "heavy balladry and slick adult-pop" [...] that made Williams' earlier records unappealing to American audiences and suggested that by [...] "downplaying [...] formerly irrepressible charm", Reality Killed the Video Star doesn't do enough to reintroduce the singer to the US pop market.|$|E

[...] Bruce Westbrook of the Houston Chronicle also gave the film <b>two</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> <b>stars,</b> and although he praised its [...] "snappy dialogue and fresh characterizations", he considered the film's plot underdeveloped and characters lacking in motivation. Peter Rainer writing for The Christian Science Monitor gave the film a C+ and called it [...] "a moderately enjoyable escapade that isn't quite clever enough for adults and not quite imaginative enough for children." [...] He was not overly critical of the film, but felt that it was a disappointment in comparison to the high standards for computer-animated films set by Pixar. Jami Bernard of the New York Daily News suggested that timelessness is a necessary component of an animated classic, and faulted the film for its attempt to be hip and current. While Ty Burr of The Boston Globe praised the film's vocal performances, he wrote, [...] "Hoodwinked never builds to a level of sustained comic mania... One aches to think what the great Looney Tunes directors could have done with this material." ...|$|E

500|$|In a {{separate}} publishing from The New York Times, David Browne criticized the song's overuse of processed vocals, writing that: [...] "As heard on her current single 'We R Who We R' {{from her new}} mini-album, 'Cannibal,' Kesha has a thin, often computer-manipulated voice that recalls ’80s new-wave pop acts. It’s often hard to tell when her singing voice ends and the Vocoder processing kicks in."
