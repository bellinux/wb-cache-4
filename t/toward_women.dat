5|$|In the 1960s, Feynman began {{thinking}} of writing an autobiography, {{and he began}} granting interviews to historians. In the 1980s, working with Ralph Leighton (Robert Leighton's son), he recorded chapters on audio tape that Robert transcribed. The book was published in 1985 as Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and became a best-seller. The publication of the book brought {{a new wave of}} protest about Feynman's attitude <b>toward</b> <b>women.</b> There had been protests over his alleged sexism in 1968, and again in 1972. It did not help that Jenijoy La Belle, who had been hired as Caltech's first female professor in 1969, was refused tenure in 1974. She filed suit with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which ruled against Caltech in 1977, adding that she had been paid less than male colleagues. La Belle finally received tenure in 1979. Many of Feynman's colleagues were surprised that he took her side. He had gotten to know her, and both liked and admired her.|$|E

Yet, other research demonstrates that social norm violations create negative attitudes <b>toward</b> pregnant <b>women</b> even when reproduction is not threatened. Therefore, {{the goal of the}} current research was to examine whether social norms influence attitudes <b>toward</b> pregnant <b>women</b> from an evolutionary psychology account by presenting participants with one of four vignettes describing a target woman with optimal reproductive fitness using a 2 (Participant Gender: Women, Men) x 2 (Pregnancy Status of the Target: Pregnant, Not- Pregnant), x 2 (Target Injunctive Norm Adherence: Adheres, Violates) fully between subjects design. Results demonstrated that norm adherence influences attitudes <b>toward</b> pregnant <b>women</b> and that participant gender (all heterosexual) moderates the norm adherence influence. These results show that social information necessarily interacts with the affordance management system to generate varied attitudes <b>toward</b> pregnant <b>women</b> not threatening optimal reproduction...|$|R

25|$|The hip hop music genre and its {{subculture}} {{has been}} criticized for its gender bias and its negative impacts on women in African-American culture. Gangsta rap artists such as Eazy-E, Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg have song lyrics that portray women as sex toys, and as people who are inferior to and dependent on men. Between 1987 and 1993, over 400 hip hop songs had lyrics that described violence <b>toward</b> <b>women</b> including rape, assault, and murder. These anti-women hip hop lyrics have led some male listeners to make physical threats <b>toward</b> <b>women</b> and they have created negative stereotypes of young urban African-American women. Hip hop music promotes masculine hegemony and it depicts women as individuals who must rely on men. The portrayal of women in hip hop lyrics and videos tends to be violent, degrading, and highly sexualized. There is a high frequency of songs with lyrics that are demeaning, or depict sexual violence or sexual assault towards women. Videos often portray idealized female bodies and depict women as being the object of male pleasure.|$|E

Thus the bra emerged from something that was once discreetly tucked into the back pages of women's magazines in the 1890s, to prominent display in department stores such as Sears, Roebuck, and Montgomery Ward by 1918.

25|$|In India, {{domestic}} violence <b>toward</b> <b>women</b> is considered as {{any type of}} abuse that {{can be considered a}} threat; it can also be physical, psychological, or sexual abuse to any current or former partner. Domestic violence is not handled as a crime or complaint, it is seen more as a private or family matter. In determining the category of a complaint, it is based on caste, class, religious bias and race which also determines whether action is to be taken or not. Many studies have reported about the prevalence of the violence and have taken a criminal-justice approach, but most woman refuse to report it. These women are guaranteed constitutional justice, dignity and equality but continue to refuse based on their sociocultural contexts. As the women refuse to speak of the violence and find help, they are also not receiving the proper treatment.|$|E
