5|$|In 1907, Einstein {{was still}} eight {{years away from}} {{completing}} {{the general theory of}} relativity. Nonetheless, he was able to make a number of novel, <b>testable</b> predictions that were based on his starting point for developing his new theory: the equivalence principle.|$|E
5|$|Peter Kreeft and Ronald Tacelli cited 20 {{arguments}} for God's existence, asserting that any demand for evidence <b>testable</b> {{in a laboratory}} is in effect asking God, the supreme being, to become man's servant.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of the scientific method from about the mid-19th century on demanded <b>testable</b> hypotheses and verifiable phenomena for causation and transmission. Anecdotal reports, and the discovery in 1881 that mosquitos were the vector of yellow fever, {{eventually led to the}} investigation of mosquitoes in connection with malaria.|$|E
5|$|Instead, he practised a {{different}} style of science: systematically gathering data, discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals, and inferring possible causal explanations from these. This style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field, such as genomics. It does not result in the same certainty as experimental science, but it sets out <b>testable</b> hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed. In this sense, Aristotle's biology is scientific.|$|E
5|$|Being a scientist, {{above all}} else, Huxley {{presented}} agnosticism {{as a form}} of demarcation. A hypothesis with no supporting objective, <b>testable</b> evidence is not an objective, scientific claim. As such, there would be no way to test said hypotheses, leaving the results inconclusive. His agnosticism was not compatible with forming a belief as to the truth, or falsehood, of the claim at hand. Karl Popper would also describe himself as an agnostic. According to philosopher William L. Rowe, in this strict sense, agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{measures}} {{appear in}} the Radstock district, and surrounding Somerset Coalfield (largely concealed by Triassic and newer rocks). There are two series of coal-bearing sandstones and shales separated by Pennant Sandstone. Locally the beds are folded and faulted. There were mines in the Radstock and Nailsea areas but these have closed. This {{was one of the}} first areas in the world to undergo systematic geological study and mapping by John Strachey and William Smith in the 18th century. They observed the rock layers, or strata, which led Smith to the creation of a <b>testable</b> hypothesis, which he termed the Principle of Faunal Succession.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's aims were twofold: to {{show that}} species had not been {{separately}} created, and {{to show that}} natural selection had been the chief agent of change. He knew that his readers were already familiar {{with the concept of}} transmutation of species from Vestiges, and his introduction ridicules that work as failing to provide a viable mechanism. Therefore, the first four chapters lay out his case that selection in nature, caused by the struggle for existence, is analogous to the selection of variations under domestication, and that the accumulation of adaptive variations provides a scientifically <b>testable</b> mechanism for evolutionary speciation.|$|E
5|$|Enquiries about insect {{pollination}} led in 1861 to novel studies of wild orchids, showing adaptation of their flowers to attract specific moths to each species and ensure cross fertilisation. In 1862 Fertilisation of Orchids gave his first detailed {{demonstration of the}} power of natural selection to explain complex ecological relationships, making <b>testable</b> predictions. As his health declined, he lay on his sickbed in a room filled with inventive experiments to trace the movements of climbing plants. Admiring visitors included Ernst Haeckel, a zealous proponent of Darwinismus incorporating Lamarckism and Goethe's idealism. Wallace remained supportive, though he increasingly turned to Spiritualism.|$|E
5|$|Instrumentalism {{became popular}} among {{physicists}} {{around the turn}} of the 20th century, after which logical positivism defined the field for several decades. Logical positivism accepts only <b>testable</b> statements as meaningful, rejects metaphysical interpretations, and embraces verificationism (a set of theories of knowledge that combines logicism, empiricism, and linguistics to ground philosophy on a basis consistent with examples from the empirical sciences). Seeking to overhaul all of philosophy and convert it to a new scientific philosophy, the Berlin Circle and the Vienna Circle propounded logical positivism in the late 1920s.|$|E
5|$|The book {{describes}} how the relationship between insects and plants resulted in the beautiful and complex forms which natural theology attributed to a grand designer. By showing how practical adaptations develop from cumulative minor variations of parts of the flowers to suit new purposes, Darwin countered the prevailing view that beautiful organisms were the handiwork of a Creator. Darwin's painstaking observations, experiments, and detailed dissection of the flowers explained previously unknown features such as the puzzle of Catasetum, which had been thought to have three completely different species of flowers on the same plant. In addition, they produced <b>testable</b> predictions including his then-controversial proposal that the long nectary of Angraecum sesquipedale meant {{that there must be}} a moth with an equally long proboscis. This was confirmed in 1903 when Xanthopan morganii praedicta was found in Madagascar.|$|E
25|$|Some {{of these}} speculations {{have yet to}} be {{developed}} into fully <b>testable</b> hypotheses, {{and a great deal of}} research is required to confirm their validity.|$|E
25|$|If {{multiple}} {{models of}} natural law make exactly the same <b>testable</b> predictions, they are equivalent {{and there is no}} need for parsimony to choose a preferred one. For example, Newtonian, Hamiltonian and Lagrangian classical mechanics are equivalent. Physicists have no interest in using Occam's razor to say the other two are wrong. Likewise, there is no demand for simplicity principles to arbitrate between wave and matrix formulations of quantum mechanics. Science often does not demand arbitration or selection criteria between models that make the same <b>testable</b> predictions.|$|E
25|$|Abraham Maslow {{proposed}} many of {{his theories}} of human growth {{in the form of}} <b>testable</b> hypotheses, and he encouraged human scientists to put them to the test.|$|E
25|$|Several test {{theories}} {{have been developed}} to assess a possible positive outcome in Lorentz violation experiments by adding certain parameters to the standard equations. These include the Robertson-Mansouri-Sexl framework (RMS) and the Standard-Model Extension (SME). RMS has three <b>testable</b> parameters with respect to length contraction and time dilation. From that, any anisotropy of the speed of light can be assessed. On the other hand, SME includes many Lorentz violation parameters, not only for special relativity, but for the Standard model and General relativity as well; thus it has a much larger number of <b>testable</b> parameters.|$|E
25|$|The (real) {{exchange}} rate is pegged (by {{the law of}} one price) so that tradable goods follow PPP (purchasing power parity). The assumption that PPP holds only for tradable goods is <b>testable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Exports of a capital-abundant country {{come from}} {{capital-intensive}} industries, and labour-abundant countries import such goods, exporting labour-intensive goods in return. Competitive pressures within the Hâ€“O model produce this prediction fairly straightforwardly. Conveniently, {{this is an}} easily <b>testable</b> hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|Behat is {{intended}} to aid communication between developers, clients and other stakeholders during a software development process. It allows the clear documentation of <b>testable</b> examples of the software's intended behaviour. Behat test scenarios are written with Gherkin, a business-readable domain-specific language following defined patterns.|$|E
25|$|MWI is {{considered}} {{by some to be}} unfalsifiable and hence unscientific because the multiple parallel universes are non-communicating, in the sense that no information can be passed between them. Others claim MWI is directly <b>testable.</b> Everett regarded MWI as falsifiable since any test that falsifies conventional quantum theory would also falsify MWI.|$|E
25|$|Science is {{a system}} of {{knowledge}} based on observation, empirical evidence, {{and the development of}} theories that yield <b>testable</b> explanations and predictions of natural phenomena. By contrast, creationism is often based on literal interpretations of the narratives of particular religious texts. Some creationist beliefs involve purported forces that lie outside of nature, such as supernatural intervention, and often do not allow predictions at all. Therefore, these can neither be confirmed nor disproved by scientists. However, many creationist beliefs can be framed as <b>testable</b> predictions about phenomena such as the age of the Earth, its geological history and the origins, distributions and relationships of living organisms found on it. Early science incorporated elements of these beliefs, but as science developed these beliefs were gradually falsified and were replaced with understandings based on accumulated and reproducible evidence that often allows the accurate prediction of future results.|$|E
25|$|In addition, cranky {{scientific}} theories do {{not in fact}} {{qualify as}} theories as this term is commonly understood within science. For example, crank theories in physics typically fail to result in <b>testable</b> predictions, which makes them unfalsifiable and hence unscientific. Or the crank may present their ideas in such a confused, not even wrong manner {{that it is impossible}} to determine what they are actually claiming.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{theories}} of carcinogenesis and cancer treatment that fall outside the mainstream of scientific opinion, due to lack of scientific rationale, logic, or evidence base. These theories may be used to justify various alternative cancer treatments. They should be distinguished from those theories of carcinogenesis that have a logical basis within mainstream cancer biology, and from which conventionally <b>testable</b> hypotheses can be made.|$|E
25|$|Fields such {{as social}} psychiatry, {{clinical}} psychology, and sociology may offer non-biomedical accounts of mental distress and disorder for certain ailments and are sometimes critical of biopsychiatry. Social critics believe biopsychiatry fails to satisfy the scientific method because they believe there is no <b>testable</b> biological evidence of mental disorders. Thus, these critics view biological psychiatry as a pseudoscience attempting to portray psychiatry as a biological science.|$|E
25|$|Proponents of orthomolecular {{medicine}} contend that, {{unlike some}} {{other forms of}} alternative medicine such as homeopathy, their ideas are at least biologically based, do not involve magical thinking, and are capable of generating <b>testable</b> hypotheses. Orthomolecular is not a standard medical term, and clinical use of specific nutrients is considered a form of chemoprevention (to prevent or delay development of disease) or chemotherapy (to treat an existing condition).|$|E
25|$|In 1974, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions {{was ranked}} {{as the second}} most {{frequently}} used book in political science courses focused on scope and methods. In particular, Kuhnâ€™s theory {{has been used by}} political scientists to critique behavioralism, which claims that accurate political statements must be both <b>testable</b> and falsifiable. The book also proved popular with political scientists embroiled in debates about whether a set of formulations put forth by a political scientists constituted a theory, or something else.|$|E
25|$|Its {{supporters}} {{claim that}} FCC {{is the only}} Darwinian theory to explain why {{there is so much}} red ochre in the early archaeological record of modern humans and why modern humans are then associated with red ochre wherever they went as they emerged from Africa. It is claimed that, more than any other theoretical model of modern human origins, FCC offers detailed and specific predictions <b>testable</b> in the light of data {{from a wide variety of}} disciplines.|$|E
25|$|Any {{principle}} of relativity prescribes a symmetry in natural law: that is, the laws must {{look the same}} to one observer as they do to another. According to a theoretical result called Noether's theorem, any such symmetry will also imply a conservation law alongside. For example, if two observers at different times see the same laws, then a quantity called energy will be conserved. In this light, relativity principles make <b>testable</b> predictions about how nature behaves, and are not just statements about how scientists should write laws.|$|E
25|$|During the 1920s, {{a series}} of papers by J. B. S. Haldane applied {{mathematical}} analysis to real-world examples of natural selection, such as the evolution of industrial melanism in peppered moths. Haldane established that natural selection could work even faster than Fisher had assumed. Both workers, and others such as Dobzhansky and Wright, explicitly intended to bring biology up to the philosophical standard of the physical sciences, making it firmly based in mathematical modelling, its predictions confirmed by experiment. Natural selection, once considered hopelessly unverifiable speculation about history, was becoming predictable, measurable, and <b>testable.</b>|$|E
25|$|Critics of the Barrow and Tipler SAP {{claim that}} it is neither <b>testable</b> nor falsifiable, and thus is not a {{scientific}} statement but rather a philosophical one. The same criticism has been leveled against the hypothesis of a multiverse, although some argue that it does make falsifiable predictions. A modified version of this criticism is that we understand so little about the emergence of life, especially intelligent life, that it is effectively impossible to calculate the number of observers in each universe. Also, the prior distribution of universes {{as a function of}} the fundamental constants is easily modified to get any desired result.|$|E
25|$|The {{power of}} twin designs {{arises from the}} fact that twins may be either {{monozygotic}} (identical (MZ): developing from a single fertilized egg and therefore sharing all of their alleles) â€“ or dizygotic (DZ: developing from two fertilized eggs and therefore sharing on average 50% of their polymorphic alleles, the same level of genetic similarity as found in non-twin siblings). These known differences in genetic similarity, together with a <b>testable</b> assumption of equal environments for identical and fraternal twins creates the basis for the twin design for exploring the effects of genetic and environmental variance on a phenotype.|$|E
25|$|Theorems in {{mathematics}} and theories in science are fundamentally different in their epistemology. A scientific theory cannot be proved; its key attribute {{is that it is}} falsifiable, that is, it makes predictions about the natural world that are <b>testable</b> by experiments. Any disagreement between prediction and experiment demonstrates the incorrectness of the scientific theory, or at least limits its accuracy or domain of validity. Mathematical theorems, on the other hand, are purely abstract formal statements: the proof of a theorem cannot involve experiments or other empirical evidence in the same way such evidence is used to support scientific theories.|$|E
25|$|However, many {{important}} neo-classical economists employed more sophisticated psychological explanations, including Francis Edgeworth, Vilfredo Pareto, and Irving Fisher. Economic psychology {{emerged in the}} 20th century {{in the works of}} Gabriel Tarde, George Katona, and Laszlo Garai. Expected utility and discounted utility models began to gain acceptance, generating <b>testable</b> hypotheses about decision-making given uncertainty and intertemporal consumption, respectively. Observed and repeatable anomalies eventually challenged those hypotheses, and further steps were taken by the Nobel Prize-winner Maurice Allais, for example, in setting out the Allais paradox, a decision problem he first presented in 1953 that contradicts the expected utility hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|Creation {{science is}} not falsifiable: An idea or {{hypothesis}} {{is generally not}} considered to be in the realm of science unless it can be potentially disproved with certain experiments, this is the concept of falsifiability in science. The act of creation as defined in creation science is not falsifiable because no <b>testable</b> bounds can be imposed on the creator. In creation science, the creator is defined as limitless, with the capacity to create (or not), through fiat alone, infinite universes, not just one, and endow each one with its own unique, unimaginable and incomparable character. It is impossible to disprove a claim when that claim as defined encompasses every conceivable contingency.|$|E
25|$|The {{scientific}} community has overwhelmingly rejected the ideas put forth in creation science as lying outside {{the boundaries of}} a legitimate science. The foundational premises underlying scientific creationism disqualify it as a science because the answers to all inquiry therein are preordained to conform to Bible doctrine, and because that inquiry is constructed upon theories which are not empirically <b>testable</b> in nature. Scientists also deem creation science's attacks against biological evolution to be without scientific merit. Those views of the {{scientific community}} were accepted in two significant court decisions in the 1980s which found the field of creation science to be a religious mode of inquiry, not a scientific one.|$|E
25|$|Karl Popper, {{who argued}} that all proper {{scientific}} theories must be potentially falsifiable, claimed that Freud's psychoanalytic theories were presented in unfalsifiable form, meaning that no experiment could ever disprove them. Adolf GrÃ¼nbaum argues in The Foundations of Psychoanalysis (1984) that Popper was mistaken and that many of Freud's theories are empirically <b>testable,</b> a position with which others such as Eysenck agree. The philosopher Donald Levy agrees with GrÃ¼nbaum that Freud's theories are falsifiable but disputes GrÃ¼nbaum's contention that therapeutic success is only the empirical basis on which they stand or fall, arguing that a much wider range of empirical evidence can be adduced if clinical case material is taken into consideration.|$|E
25|$|The {{relative}} lack of linguistic information on Genie from the previous six months left some ambiguities about the rate and timeline of Genie's early vocabulary and grammar acquisition. Curtiss and Fromkin quickly decided that Genie's linguistic abilities were not yet at a usefully <b>testable</b> level, so {{for the rest of}} Genie's stay at Children's Hospital Curtiss met with her almost every day for observations. They soon realized existing linguistic tests would not yield meaningful results, so although they also incorporated a few existing tests, including the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, into their exams, they designed a set of 26 new tests from which they extrapolated most of their data. Curtiss also wrote down every spontaneous utterance she heard from Genie, ultimately recording approximately a few thousand.|$|E
25|$|All {{processes}} in organisms obey physical laws, the difference from inanimate processes lying in their organisation and their being subject to control by coded information. This {{has led some}} biologists and philosophers (for example, Ernst Mayr and David Hull) {{to return to the}} strictly philosophical reflections of Charles Darwin to resolve some of the problems which confronted them when they tried to employ a philosophy of science derived from classical physics. This latter, positivist approach emphasised a strict determinism (as opposed to high probability) and to the discovery of universally applicable laws, <b>testable</b> in the course of experiment. It was difficult for biology, beyond a basic microbiological level, to live up to these structures. Standard philosophy of science seemed to leave out a lot of what characterised living organisms - namely, a historical component {{in the form of an}} inherited genotype.|$|E
