5|$|Scotland {{were the}} first <b>team</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> the world champions, as goals from Denis Law, Bobby Lennox and Jim McCalliog secured a 3–2 victory at Wembley on 15 April 1967. Despite this set-back, England {{qualified}} for UEFA Euro 1968, which consisted of just four teams: England, Italy (hosts), the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia. England played just two games at the tournament, losing 1–0 to Yugoslavia, and then beating the Soviets 2–0 in the third-place play-off.|$|E
5|$|Leicester {{started their}} first {{season in the}} Premier League since 2004 with a good run of results in their first five league matches, {{starting}} with a 2–2 draw on the opening day against Everton. The Foxes then claimed their first Premier League win since May 2004, with a 0–1 win at Stoke City. On 21 September 2014, Leicester went on to produce {{one of the greatest}} comebacks in Premier League history to beat Manchester United 5–3 at the King Power Stadium after coming back from 3–1 down with 30 minutes left to score four goals. They also made Premier League history by becoming the first <b>team</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> United from a two-goal deficit since the league's launch in 1992.|$|E
5|$|Maryland {{entered the}} game having been {{knocked out of}} the running for the Atlantic Division title the {{previous}} week, but able to play spoiler for Boston College. The Eagles were playing to earn a berth to the ACC Championship Game for the second consecutive year. Additionally, competing within a closely contested ACC, Maryland could have greatly improved its standing for bowl selection with an eighth win. The Eagles were the fifth ranked team to face Maryland. The Terrapins were, to that point, 4–0 against top-25 opposition and the only <b>team</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> four ranked opponents in 2008. Boston College was fielding second-string quarterback Dominique Davis in his first career appearance. He replaced starter Chris Crane, who had suffered a broken collarbone the previous week.|$|E
50|$|On November 20, the touring Soviet National <b>team</b> came <b>to</b> Hulman Center to play Indiana State. ISU {{defeated}} the Soviets, 83-79, {{to become one}} of only four college <b>teams</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> them that season.|$|R
5000|$|In 2012, Manawatu scored {{its first}} victory away to North Harbour. The win {{at home against}} Hawke's Bay made Manawatu {{one of the few}} Championship <b>teams</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> a Premiership <b>team.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2009, Edwards {{entered the}} season {{as one of the}} <b>teams</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat.</b> In a disappointment, Edwards and Osborne did not win a race {{for the second time in}} a season {{together}} making the chase but finishing 11th in points.|$|R
5|$|Relegation {{meant that}} 2009–10 saw Luton {{playing in the}} Conference Premier, a {{competition}} which the club had never before participated in. The club unsuccessfully contested the promotion play-offs three times in four seasons during their time as a non-League club, employing five different managers. In the 2012–13 FA Cup fourth round, Luton won their away tie against Premier League club Norwich City 1–0 and, in doing so, became the first non-League <b>team</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> a side from England's top division since 1989. In the 2013–14 season, under the management of John Still, Luton won the Conference Premier title with three games to spare, and thereby secured {{a return to the}} Football League from 2014–15.|$|E
5|$|The 2007–08 season saw Bolton survive with a 16th-place finish, {{their safety}} being {{confirmed}} {{on the final}} day of the season, as they went on an unbeaten run for their final five games, as well as getting to the last sixteen of the UEFA Cup. Former assistant manager Sammy Lee replaced Allardyce as manager, but a poor start to the season saw him replaced by Gary Megson. During the European run, Bolton gained an unexpected draw at former European champions Bayern Munich as well as becoming the first British <b>team</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> Red Star Belgrade in Belgrade. They also defeated Atlético Madrid on aggregate before being knocked out by Sporting Lisbon.|$|E
5|$|Between 1961 and 1989, when Real {{dominated}} La Liga, only Atlético {{offered it}} any serious challenge, winning Liga titles in 1966, 1970, 1973 and 1977. In 1965, Atlético {{became the first}} <b>team</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> Real at the Bernabéu in eight years. Real Madrid's record against Atlético in more recent times is very favorable. A high point coming in the 2002–03 season, when Real clinched the La Liga title after a 0–4 victory at Atlético at the Vicente Calderón Stadium. Atlético's first win over its city rivals since 1999 came with the Copa del Rey win in May 2013. In 2013–14, Real and Atlético were finalists of UEFA Champions League, the first final which hosted two clubs from same city. Real Madrid triumphed with 4–1 in extra time. On 7 February 2015, Real suffered their first defeat in 14 years at the Vicente Calderón, a 4–0 loss. On 28 May 2016, Real and Atlético met again for the Champions League title in Milan {{which resulted in a}} win for Real Madrid via Penalty Shootout.|$|E
50|$|The Open Cup tournament was {{highlighted}} by A-League side Charleston Battery reaching the semifinals, {{one of four}} USL <b>teams</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> Major League Soccer teams. The 2004 tournament was also the final edition contested using golden goal as opposed to more conventional soccer extra time.|$|R
50|$|United {{were indeed}} {{one of the}} hardest <b>teams</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> in the First Division this season, losing just nine out of 42 games, but they were also held to a draw on 18 occasions. This {{restricted}} them to eighth-place finish - not even enough for a UEFA Cup place.|$|R

5|$|His season's best {{came under}} unusual {{circumstances}} at the British Grand Prix – {{due to a}} system malfunction he was initially timed by hand at dead on ten seconds, which was amended to 9.96s after video evidence was consulted. He could not match that form at the World 100m final: Kim Collins, Darrel Brown, Darren Campbell, and Chambers all finished within a split second {{of each other and}} Chambers was adjudged to have finished fourth. Chambers squandered his anchoring lead in the 4×100m relay, allowing Joshua J. Johnson of the United States <b>team</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> him to the finish line. In spite of his close fourth and a relay silver medal, {{there was a sense of}} disappointment in the press that Chambers' record breaking claims and gold medals had not materialised.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} round City faced four-time European trophy winners A.C. Milan. The first leg, held at the San Siro, was {{initially}} postponed due to fog, and was instead played the following day. City took a 2–0 lead and came close to becoming the first English <b>team</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> Milan at the San Siro, but conceded twice; the equaliser scored eight minutes from time. City won the home leg 3–0, with goals from Booth, Hartford and Kidd. City's first European quarter-final since 1971 was against Borussia Mönchengladbach. The club received advice from Bob Paisley, whose Liverpool had met Mönchengladbach several times. City opened the scoring in the first leg, but while attempting to extend their lead were caught on the counter-attack and conceded an equaliser. After failing to win the home leg, having conceded an away goal in the process, City travelled to Germany with few expecting them to progress. So it proved, as City lost 3–1 at the Bökelbergstadion.|$|E
5|$|Texas' win, by a {{score of}} 25–22, was the lowest scoring game Texas would {{experience}} all season, {{both in terms of}} points scored by Texas and total points. Fourth-ranked OSU became the highest-ranked non-conference opponent the Longhorns had ever beaten at an opponent's home stadium. The previous high came in 1983 when third-ranked Texas pulled off a 20–7 upset versus fifth-ranked Auburn. Texas became the first non-conference opponent to beat the Buckeyes in Ohio Stadium since 1990, putting an end to a 36-game home victory string over non-conference opponents. The Longhorns also were the first <b>team</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> the Buckeyes in a night game at The Horseshoe and it was UT's 10thstraight victory in a night-game road contest. ESPN and College Football Rivals each named the game one of the best football games of the season.|$|E
5000|$|... 2015 had {{yet another}} league re-shuffle, moving Oxford and Shropshire {{out of the}} new third tiered BAFANL NFC II South division, and adding Leeds Bobcats and Humber Warhawks, in their inaugural seasons. The Saxons had a great season and surpassed plenty of people expectations. The only <b>teams</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> the Saxons were the Leicester Falcons and the Sandwell Steelers, who went on <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> the Saxons in the Daffodil Bowl.|$|R
50|$|In December 1951, she {{was part}} of efforts to form an Australian <b>team</b> <b>to</b> compete against a visiting English {{wheelchair}} archery <b>team.</b> Prior <b>to</b> her departure from Stoke Mandeville, Ludwig Guttmann had promised her that he would send an English <b>team</b> <b>to</b> Australia <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> the Australians in archery.|$|R
5000|$|In 1909, The Buxton Wonders won {{one game}} and lost one game in Buxton, Iowa against the Chicago Union Giants, facing pitchers, [...] "the Lyons brothers" [...] Jimmie Lyons and Bennie Lyons. The Wonders {{were one of}} few <b>teams</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> the Chicago Union Giants that year, where the team won 46 out of 56 games played. The Union Giants appear to be regular {{visitors}} <b>to</b> Buxton's <b>team.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Trojans next {{faced the}} Stanford Cardinal. Though the Cardinal {{were the last}} <b>team</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> the Trojans at home back in 2001, they were {{slightly}} struggling under first–year head coach Walt Harris and quarterback Trent Edwards with a 4–3 record. The Trojans jumped to an early lead with a LenDale White rushing touchdown, a Reggie Bush rushing touchdown, a Leinart touchdown pass to White, and a Mario Danelo field goal. With a 24-point lead, Leinart threw two more touchdown passes before Edwards passed for the first Cardinal touchdown of the game. Leinart's fourth touchdown pass came with threeminutes left in the half to give the Trojans a 44–7 half-time lead. The Cardinal scored on a rush in the third quarter, and with many starters out the Trojans answered {{in the fourth quarter}} with their own rushing touchdown. The Cardinal ended the scoring with 23seconds remaining with their second rushing touchdown of the game to bring the score to 51–21. With the win, the Trojans extended their winning streak to 31games.|$|E
5|$|The {{provisional}} favourite for the women's {{race was}} Kenyan runner Florence Kiplagat, {{who was the}} fastest entrant in the field through her win at the Lille Half Marathon in September (also her debut for the distance). Her compatriots Peninah Arusei and Sarah Chepchirchir – second and third in Lille – completed the strongest three of the Kenyan women's team, which was considered the <b>team</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> for the title. The Ethiopians, led by Boston Marathon winner Dire Tune, were their main opposition for the team race, although the nation had sent relatively inexperienced runners to the championships on this occasion. China's leading athlete was Zhu Xiaolin, who despite being an established marathon runner had less experience over the half distance. Although Japan lacked a leading figure individually, their overall consistency (which had brought them team medals {{in the last five}} editions) demonstrated their team pedigree. Kenya entered the tournament as the reigning team champions.|$|E

50|$|In the league's early days, Auckland, Wellington and Canterbury {{dominated}} the competition. By the mid-1990s, Auckland and Nelson were the <b>teams</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat,</b> with New Zealand basketball legends Pero Cameron and Phill Jones dominating during this era for Auckland and Nelson, respectively. Auckland and Waikato dominated during the 2000s, but with Auckland's departure following the 2012 season, {{the door was}} left open for Wellington and Southland {{to fill the void}} of the league's premier teams.|$|R
50|$|In 1995-96 Veria {{returned}} to Alpha Ethniki after finishing second in Beta Ethniki. The club finished in 10th position {{to retain their}} league status in the following season, when the most notable win was the 1-0 home result against Olympiacos, who won the championship that season. Veria & AEK were the only <b>teams</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> Olympiacos that season. The 1997-98 season saw an improved squad, with players such as Oleg Protasov, Panagiotis Tsalouchidis, finish ninth in the league.|$|R

50|$|Purefoods, whom {{many people}} dubbed {{as one of}} the <b>teams</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat</b> for the said tournament, finally scored {{back-to-back}} wins on December 2 against Coca-Cola. During the same gameday, Purefoods-Hormel celebrated 10 years of partnership. The event saw the unveiling of TJ, the new team mascot, a halftime show for the kids, and the Giants wearing commemorative jerseys. Purefoods strung up two more wins against Brgy. Ginebra and Barako Bull to extend its winning streak to four.|$|R
50|$|He {{remained}} at Carrow Road until 14 October 1994, when a £900,000 fee {{took him to}} Wimbledon to replace long-serving John Fashanu as strike partner to Dean Holdsworth. He was the club's top scorer in the league that season with nine goals as they finished ninth {{in the league and}} maintained their {{reputation as one of the}} hardest Premier League <b>teams</b> <b>to</b> <b>beat,</b> although they struggled to score many goals and rarely hit more than two in a match that campaign.|$|R
