25|$|<b>A</b> <b>totally</b> <b>one-sided</b> trans-Tasman clash saw New Zealand {{collapse}} to {{a feeble}} 58 all out after being sent in, with only captain Fleming reaching 20. Australian slow left-armer Brad Young took a hat-trick to finish with an exceptional analysis of 4–2–4–4. In reply, the Australians rattled along at nearly six an over, losing only Mark Waugh as they raced to 62/1 in 10.5 overs with Gilchrist smashing three sixes as he hit 42 from 36 balls.|$|R
5000|$|Republican {{candidate}} Donald Trump — who hosted SNL {{the previous}} season and eventually secured {{the presidency in}} November — was unhappy with his portrayal on the show by recurring guest Alec Baldwin. On multiple occasions, {{both before and after}} winning the election, Trump used Twitter to publicize his thoughts on the impersonation, as well as the show: [...] "Watched Saturday Night Live hit job on me. Time to retire the boring and unfunny show. Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks," [...] he tweeted the morning after the Emily Blunt/Bruno Mars episode on October 16, 2016. [...] "It is <b>a</b> <b>totally</b> <b>one-sided,</b> biased show —nothing funny at all. Equal time for us?", he posted on November 20 after the Kristen Wiig/The xx episode, suggesting the show follow the equal-time rule, despite the presidential race being over. His criticism continued preceding his inauguration: he dubbed it [...] "unwatchable" [...] on December 4, and tweeted [...] "Saturday Night Live is the worst of NBC. Not funny, cast is terrible, always a complete hit job. Really bad television!" [...] after the Felicity Jones/Sturgill Simpson episode on January 15, 2017.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{demonstrate}} {{that for all}} linear devices and/or sensors, signal requisition and reconstruction is naturally a mathematical frame expansion and reconstruction issue, whereas the measurement is carried out via a sequence generated by the exact physical response function (PRF) h of the device, termed sensory frame {hn}. The signal re-construction, on the other hand, {{will be carried out}} using the dual frame {h̃an} of the estimated sensory frame {han}. This consequently results in <b>an</b> <b>one-sided</b> perturbation to <b>a</b> frame expansion. We show that the stability of such <b>a</b> <b>one-sided</b> frame perturbation ex-ists. Such <b>an</b> <b>one-sided</b> perturbation to <b>a</b> frame expansion exists in each and every signal and image reconstruction problem. Examples of image reconstructions in de-blurring are demonstrated...|$|R
