5|$|Finally, in {{practice}} {{one wants to}} approximate the function with {{a finite number of}} terms, say with a Taylor polynomial or a partial sum of the trigonometric series, respectively.

5|$|A {{paternity}} {{analysis of}} yellow-faced honeyeater nestlings found that 10 of 18 nestlings were fathered by the male of the nesting pair, with clear evidence for extra-pair paternity in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> remaining 44%.

5|$|A snail {{does not}} have a dart to fire the very first time it mates, because the first mating is {{necessary}} to trigger the process of dart formation. Once a snail has mated, it fires a dart before some, but not all, subsequent matings. A snail often mates without having a dart to use, because it takes time to create a replacement dart. In <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> garden snail Cornu aspersum, it takes a week for a new dart to form.|$|E
5|$|A third protein can {{sometimes}} be involved in type II toxin-antitoxin systems. In <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aforementioned MazEF addiction module, {{in addition to the}} toxin and antitoxin there is a regulatory protein involved called MazG. MazG protein interacts with E. colis Era GTPase and is described as a 'nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase,' which hydrolyses nucleoside triphosphates to monophosphates. Later research showed that MazG is transcribed in the same polycistronic mRNA as MazE and MazF, and that MazG bound the MazF toxin to further inhibit its activity.|$|E

5|$|Crop {{diversity}} loss threatens global food security, as the world's {{human population}} {{depends on a}} diminishing number of varieties of a diminishing number of crop species. Crops are increasingly grown in monoculture, meaning that if, as in the historic Irish Potato Famine, a single disease overcomes a variety's resistance, it may destroy an entire harvest, or as in <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 'Gros Michel' banana, may cause the commercial extinction of an entire variety.
