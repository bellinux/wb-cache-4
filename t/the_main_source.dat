5|$|Abrahams Creek is <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>source</b> of {{flooding}} in West Wyoming, Forty Fort, and Swoyersville. Sheet flooding can {{occur when the}} creek floods over Eighth Street.

The Slocum Dam, which is upstream of West Wyoming, also helps to reduce flooding on the creek. However, localized flooding and ponding frequently affect its lower reaches. The creek has been experienced extensive modifications, such as narrowing and riprap installation, in The Hollow to accommodate West Eighth Street.|$|E

These developments contributed to the 1980s oil glut, which affected the Soviet Union, as oil was <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>source</b> of Soviet export revenues. Issues with command economics, oil price decreases and large military expenditures gradually brought the Soviet economy to stagnation.|$|E
