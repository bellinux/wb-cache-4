40|$|A cDNA {{library was}} <b>prepared</b> from the <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> genome of the {{infectious}} bursal disease virus (IBDV) strain ST-C. The cDNA molecules were annealed into the plasmid pUC 9 and used to transform Escherichia coli strain JM 107. A cDNA clone that contained IBDV-specific nucleotide sequences was selected and designated STC- 1. Radiolabeled probes were prepared from STC- 1 and hybridized to genome segment A of ST-C in a northern blot hybridization assay. The STC- 1 cDNA was 448 base pairs in length, and its nucleotide sequence indicated that it is located near the VP- 2 /VP- 4 junction in IBDV genome segment A. Biotin-labeled probes were prepared from STC- 1 and used in a dot-blot hybridization assay to detect IBDV. Under relatively low stringency conditions of hybridization, the biotinylated probes detected four subtypes of IBDV serotype 1 and a serotype 2 IBDV isolate...|$|R

Clone pOH 632, which is located in the highly conserved C-terminal part of VP 2, is 230 base pairs long, has nucleotide sequence homology of 87 to 88 %, and amino acid sequence homology of 100 % with IBDV serotype 1. The lower detection limit of 32 P-labeled probes prepared from both clones was 10 ng of OH-IBDV <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA,</b> using high-stringency conditions of hybridization (54 C, 50 % formamide) and washing (55 C, 0. 015 M NaCl, 0. 0015 M trisodium citrate, pH 7. 0, with 0. 1 % sodium dodecyl sulfate), and autoradiography for 24 hours. Under these conditions, the dot-blot hybridization assay for detection of serotype 2 IBDV <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA,</b> was 1, 000 times more sensitive, using probe pOH 632, but only 10 times more sensitive, using probe pOH 405, compared with the assay for IBDV serotype 1, using the same probes.

40|$|<b>Double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> induces a post-transcriptional gene {{silencing}} process, termed RNAi, in diverse organisms. It is shown here that transcriptional {{gene silencing}} accompanied by de novo methylation of a target promoter in plants can be triggered by a <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> containing promoter sequences. Similar to the <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> involved in RNAi, this promoter <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA,</b> which is synthesized in the nucleus, is partially cleaved into small RNAs ∼ 23 nucleotides in length. Both transcriptional and {{post-transcriptional gene silencing}} can thus be initiated by <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNAs</b> that enter the same degradation pathway.

40|$|Inhibition {{of protein}} {{synthesis}} in rabbit reticulocyte lysates by <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> {{is caused by}} the inactivation of IF- 3, an initiation factor required for the recycling of ribosomes and for their binding to messenger RNA. The evidence for this is that (i) the inhibition can be overcome by addition of exogenous If- 3; (ii) <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> inactivates stoichiometric amounts of IF- 3; (iii) <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> forms a complex with IF- 3; and (iv) double-stranded DNA, which lacks inhibitory activity, also binds to IF- 3, but with a much lower affinity than <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA.</b> It is concluded that <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> inhibits cellular protein synthesis by tightly complexing with IF- 3.

One feature that has been lacking in this model system is the ability to disable specifically targeted genes. Recently, <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> has been used to silence gene expression in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We have found that expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) from a microinjected plasmid vector can be suppressed in zebrafish embryos by the coinjection of a <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> that is specifically targeted to GFP. To determine that <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> can attenuate endogenous gene expression, single-cell zebrafish embryos were injected with <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> specifically targeted to Zf-T and Pax 6. 1.

40|$|Interferon is a {{principal}} component of the host antiviral defense system. In this study, abortive focus formation by Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in primate cells was accompanied by early interferon induction, while productive focus formation in porcine cells {{was associated with a}} late interferon response. Neutralization antibodies against interferon relieved the restricted infection in primate cells, and increasingly larger foci were generated as treatment with exogenous interferon was delayed, thereby establishing a solid correlation between interferon response and viral dissemination. However, delayed interferon induction in JEV-infected porcine cells occurred in the absence of active inhibition by the virus. We further demonstrated that JEV mediates interferon activation through <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> and cytosolic pattern recognition receptors. Immunofluorescence and subcellular fractionation studies revealed that <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> is concealed in intracellular membranes at an early phase of infection but eventually appears in the cytosol at later periods, which could then allow detection by cytosolic pattern recognition receptors. Interestingly, cytosolic exposure of <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> was delayed in porcine cells compared to primate cells, independent of total <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> levels and in correlation with the timing of the interferon response. Furthermore, when <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> was artificially introduced into the cytosol of porcine cells, more rapid and robust interferon activation was triggered than in viral infection. Thus, cytosolic exposure of JEV <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA</b> is imperative for interferon induction, but in cell lines (e. g., porcine cells) with delayed emergence of cytosolic <b>double-stranded</b> <b>RNA,</b> the interferon response is late and viral dissemination is consequently enhanced...|$|R
