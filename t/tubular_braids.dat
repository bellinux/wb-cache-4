The thermoplastic pultrusion molding is a manufacturing process in which generated by the resin fiber and reinforcement fibers are pulled through the heat die. The pressure was generated, also the resin fiber start melt and impregnate into the reinforcement fiber. In this investigation study the mechanical properties of jute spun yarn/PLA <b>tubular</b> <b>braided</b> composite by pultrusion molding. The systems for jute spun yarn/PLA braided composite were described in the term of materials design, structure design and processing design. The intermediate materials were prepared by comingle technique. The braiding technique manufactured preform which had jute fiber diagonally oriented at certain angles with the glass fiber inserted into the braiding yarns along the longitudinal direction of braiding structure. The braided preforms were pulled through the heated die where consolidation flow took place due to reduced matrix viscosity. The pultrusion experiments were fabricated the <b>tubular</b> <b>braided</b> composite with varying the structure of braided preform and pultrusion molding condition. The configuration of intermediate material and the molding temperature are influenced to the mechanical properties of jute spun yarn/PLA <b>tubular</b> <b>braided</b> composite.

In this study Abaqus Finite Element (FE) software is used, incorporating an isotropic material law for approximating the elastic modulus of the braided fabric while comparing the results with test data for selected levels of the modulus when the structure is under uniaxial compression.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} assess the {{viability}} of a space qualified shape memory polymer (SMP) mechanical counter pressure (MCP) suit. A key development objective identified by the International Space Exploration Coordination Group, {{the development of a}} superior space suit with greater mobility and environmental robustness is necessary to support long-range human space exploration, specifically a mission to Mars. Conceptualized in 1971, a spacesuit utilizing MCP would fulfill these goals but its development was halted due to inadequate mechanical analysis and material limitations at the time. Since then, new active materials have been assessed to potentially further the development of a space qualified MCP space suit, which include quantitative thresholds for minimum pressure production, durability, pressure distribution, mobility range, and ease of garment donning and doffing. Guided by these criteria, a SMP biaxial <b>tubular</b> <b>braid</b> applying MCP through active compression was designed and the prototype manufacturing processes were outlined. To predict the pressure production of this garment, the thermo-mechanics of a SMP was combined with the textile mechanics of a biaxial <b>tubular</b> <b>braid</b> and simulated within design parameter ranges consistent with the design criteria and practical considerations. The pressure production was controllable with the design parameters SMP elastic modulus, garment radial deformation, textile fiber spacing, and operational temperature. Assuming reasonable model accuracy, a SMP garment could achieve the necessary pressure production for a space qualified MCP suit, however, the durability of such a garment would be questionable considering the creep sustained from consecutive spacewalks of four to eight hours. Recommendations are made for methods to increase model accuracy, suggested SMP actuation mechanisms, and alternative textile architectures. by Brian Wee. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|Braided fabrics {{are often}} used to {{reinforce}} composite mate-rials. An advantage of braided fabrics is that the braiding angle can be changed. As the braiding angle affects the fab-ric’s mechanical properties, such as the bending elastic modulus and the maximum bending stress, the mechanical properties can be variously designed by controlling the braiding angle change. In a previous stationary simple model, a braiding angle was predicted by three parameters: the longitudinal veloc-ity of the mandrel, the angular rate of the spindle, and the radius of the cylindrical mandrel as shown in Figure 1. 1 However, when using this approach, a temporal change in braiding angle caused by the mandrel velocity change on a cylindrical <b>tubular</b> <b>braided</b> fabric cannot be predicted.

40|$|Abstract: Predictive {{calculations}} {{of the physical}} properties of fibrous preforms and composite parts require an appropriate description of the preform geometry. Most internal dimensions of a preform are set during its manufacturing through mechanical interactions occurring between the tows and threads. However, the global shape and the interlacing patterns of the constituent textiles are determined independently. In this paper, a formal procedure for {{the description of the}} interlacing patterns is proposed. This procedure, which is based on the individual textile manufacturing processes, is general in the textiles considered and in the possible applications. The interlacing patterns are expressed by a series of vectors that follow a universal set of criteria and are generated from the values taken by the processing parameters. Defining examples are given for three-dimen-sional woven textiles and three-dimensional <b>tubular</b> <b>braided</b> textiles, and geometrical applications are also presented. Further examples for warp-knitted textiles and multiple-layer stacks will be given in a subsequent paper, together with examples of physical applications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A <b>tubular</b> <b>braided</b> {{composite}} bone {{cast for}} improving the efficiency and quality of bone fracture treatment is investigated. Finite element {{analysis was used to}} evaluate stress concentrations in fracture sites supported with plate and tubular casts. The stress in a plated bone is 768 % of that in a whole bone at the same location, while it is only 47 % in a bone with a tubular cast. Three unbroken synthetic humeri were mechanically tested using an in-vitro long bone testing procedure developed in-house to find their stiffness at 20 ° and 60 ° abduction; these were found to be 116. 8 ± 1. 5 N/mm and 20. 63 ± 0. 02 N/mm, respectively. A 2 cm gap osteotomy was cut through the diaphysis in each bone. The bones were casted with a Kevlar/Cold cure composite, with calculated braid angles and thicknesses that Closely matched bone propoerties. The stiffness tests were repeated, and the results were within 10 % of the unbroken bone. This novel method of bone casting is promising if other clinical challenges can be minimized...|$|R

40|$|The micro-geometry of {{three-dimensional}} (3 D) <b>braided</b> <b>tubular</b> preform is {{more complex}} than that of rectangular one, especially for the interfaces between yarns. The yarn interfaces are difficult to analyze theoretically, and if two sides of the interfaces do not fit perfectly in the model, the final result will contain overlapped yarns, which is bad for finite element calculation. This paper focuses on the microstructure of 3 D four-directional <b>braided</b> <b>tubular</b> composites and presents a modelling approach based on Free Form Deformation (FFD) theory. First, the planar and spatial yarn paths are analyzed and three geometrical mapping equations from rectangular unit-cell to tubular sub unit-cell are derived. The modelling approach was then developed to establish the sub unit-cell model. Finally, the established models are compared with micro computed tomography (μ-CT) scans of a dry specimen of the circular braided preform.

Some forms of braided rope with untwisted cores have a particular advantage; they do not impart an additional twisting force when they are stressed. The lack of added twisting forces is an advantage when a load is freely suspended, as when a rope is used for rappelling or to suspend an arborist.

40|$|The pipelineTM {{embolization}} device (PED) is a <b>braided,</b> <b>tubular,</b> bimetallic endoluminal implant {{used for}} occlusion of intracranial aneurysms through flow disruption along the aneurysm neck. The authors report on two cas-es of giant {{internal carotid artery}} aneurysm treated with the PED. In the first case, an aneurysm measuring 26. 4 mm was observed at the C 3 -C 4 portion of the left internal carotid artery in a 64 -year-old woman who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for dizziness and diplopia. In the second case, MRI showed an aneurysm measuring 25 mm at the C 4 -C 5 portion of the right internal carotid artery in a 39 -year-old woman with right ptosis and diplopia. Each giant aneurysm was treated with de-ployment of a PED (3. 75 mm diameter/ 20 mm length and 4. 5 mm diam-eter/ 25 mm length, respectively). Nine months later, both cases showed complete radiological occlusion of the giant intracranial aneurysm and sac shrinkage.

40|$|A {{new class}} of {{composite}} <b>tubular</b> membranes, steel <b>braided</b> membranes, has been tested in high flow velocity membrane systems for the extraction of organic pollutants from dilute aqueous solution. These membranes consist of a tubular membrane made of rubber material (e. polydimethylsiloxane or ethylene propylene diene monomer) contained in a netlike shell (braid), made of stainless steel threads, which supports the rubber tube. Overall mass transfer coefficients have been measured through steel braided and bare PDMS membrane tubes, using air, distilled water and polypropylene glycol (PPG) as extractive phases under a range of hydrodynamic conditions. The transport mechanism {{has been described by}} a resistance-in-series model approach. This has allowed the contributions of the braided side of the membrane tubes to the overall mass transfer resistance to be elucidated, and has shown that in aqueous-aqueous extraction operations the braid is the main resistance to mass transport across the membrane. Mass transfer coefficients measured through bare membrane tubes (1. 4 x 10 (- 5) to 2. 5 x 10 (- 5) m s(- 1)) were 40 % higher than those measured through braided membrane tubes (1. 0 x 10 (- 5) to 1. 5 x 10 (- 5) m s(- 1)) under similar hydrodynamic conditions. This limitation has been overcome by using an extractive phase with high affinity for toluene (PPG). This enables high mass transport rates (overall mass transfer coefficients ranging from 4. 3 x 10 (- 5) to 5. 2 x 10 (- 5) m s(- 1)) and allows an efficient use of braided membranes for extraction in modules with high fluid velocity.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, silk fibroin (SF) has been emergently used in {{peripheral}} nerve tissue engineering. Current approaches aiming at producing SF-based nerve guidance conduits (SF-NGCs) used dissolved silk based on either aqueous solutions or organic solvents. In this study, we describe a novel procedure to produce SF-NGCs: A <b>braided</b> <b>tubular</b> structure of raw Bombyx mori silk is subsequently processed with the ternary solvent CaCl 2 /H 2 O/ethanol, formic acid, and methanol {{to improve its}} mechanical and topographical characteristics. Topographically, {{the combination of the}} treatments results in a fusion of the outer single silk fibers to a closed layer with a thickness ranging from about 40 to 75 mum. In contrast to the outer wall, the inner lumen (not treated with processing solvents) still represents the braided structure of single fibers. Mechanical stability, elasticity, and kink characteristics were evaluated with a custom-made test system. The modification procedure described here drastically improved the elastic properties of our tubular raw scaffold, favoring its use as a NGC. A cell migration assay with NIH/ 3 T 3 -fibroblasts revealed the impermeability of the SF-NGC wall for possible invading and scar-forming cells. Moreover, the potential of the SF-NGC to serve as a substratum for Schwann cells has been demonstrated by cytotoxicity tests and live-dead stainings of Schwann cells grown on the inner surface of the SF-NGC. In vivo, the SF-NGC was tested in a rat sciatic nerve injury model. In short-term in vivo studies, it was proved that SF-NGCs are not triggering host inflammatory reactions. After 12 weeks, we could demonstrate morphological and functional reinnervation of the distal targets. Filled with collagen, a higher number of axons could be found in the distal to the graft (1678 +/- 303), compared with the empty SF-NGC (1274 +/- 146). The novel SF-NGC presented here shows promising results for the treatment of peripheral nerve injuries. The modification of braided structures to adapt their mechanical and topographical characteristics may support the translation of SF-based scaffolds into the clinical setting. However, further improvements and the use of extracellular matrix molecules and Schwann cells are suggested to enable silk tube based conduits to bridge long-distance nerve gaps...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{pre-existing}} {{damage on the}} mode of failure and energy absorption characteristics of Non-Crimp Fabric (NCF) and biaxially <b>braided</b> <b>tubular</b> sections under axial loading were considered. Loading rate effects were incorporated by testing at quasi-static rates and impact rates up to 7 ms- 1 and the pre-existing damage was simulated through stress concentrations and out-of-plane impact damage. Circular and square geometries were tested, {{and a range of}} NCF and braided fibre architectures were investigated. A number of failure modes were exhibited. NCF tubes were seen to splay at static and impact rates; at impact rates a reduction in Specific Energy Absorption (SEA) was recorded. Braided tubes failed in a combination of buckling and splaying at static rates. Under dynamic conditions all braided samples splayed and where a change in failure mode was seen, SEA was increased. Both NCF and biaxially braided tubes have been shown to offer a much lower SEA than Continuous Filament Random Mat (CoFRM) samples. A threshold size of damage was observed, where, typically, below that threshold the SEA was unaffected by the damage, and above that size the tube would fail globally. The NCF tubes exhibited an improved damage tolerance over CoFRM and braided samples. The braided tubes showed a poor damage tolerance at quasi-static rates although results suggest that the architectures with high axial fibre content will have a higher damage tolerance. It has been shown that modelling damaged areas of tubes as a cut-out is a conservative approach to finding failure levels. Peak stress was seen to be the dominant factor in determining loading at global failure as samples could fail even though the crushing stress is less than the failure stress. Previous work upon Interlaminar Shear Strength (ILSS) and SEA has been investigated and shown to overestimate energy absorption for tubular specimens and found to apply only to samples that fail by progressive crush or fragmentation; for those that do fail in this mode a link between ILSS and SEA has been stated. A technique for determining SEA and for predicting the effect of a SCF on failure mode of composite tubes has been proposed using UCS (Ultimate Compressive Strength) data and SCF (Stress Concentration Factor) data.
