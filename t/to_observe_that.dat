5|$|The first {{mathematician}} {{to discover}} the existence of curves of constant width, and <b>to</b> <b>observe</b> <b>that</b> the Reuleaux triangle has constant width, may have been Leonhard Euler. In a paper that he presented in 1771 and published in 1781 entitled De curvis triangularibus, Euler studied curvilinear triangles {{as well as the}} curves of constant width, which he called orbiforms.|$|E
5|$|Šišić {{pursued the}} helicopters, firing {{aircraft}} gun {{in front of}} the helicopters, but his aircraft was not armed with tracer ammunition and the helicopter pilots were not able <b>to</b> <b>observe</b> <b>that</b> they were fired upon. Flying at a speed of , he switched to missiles and registered that the missile seekers had acquired the targets. Šišić fired two infrared homing R-60 missiles. One of the missiles flew between the two helicopters, while the other struck the engine of the lead helicopter. The helicopter was shot down near the village of Podrute, located in an area administered by the city of Novi Marof, north of Zagreb. The second helicopter had to crash-land to evade the attack.|$|E
5|$|Arfwedson later {{showed that}} this same element {{was present in}} the {{minerals}} spodumene and lepidolite. In 1818, Christian Gmelin was the first <b>to</b> <b>observe</b> <b>that</b> lithium salts give a bright red color to flame. However, both Arfwedson and Gmelin {{tried and failed to}} isolate the pure element from its salts. It was not isolated until 1821, when William Thomas Brande obtained it by electrolysis of lithium oxide, a process that had previously been employed by the chemist Sir Humphry Davy to isolate the alkali metals potassium and sodium. Brande also described some pure salts of lithium, such as the chloride, and, estimating that lithia (lithium oxide) contained about 55% metal, estimated the atomic weight of lithium to be around 9.8 g/mol (modern value ~6.94 g/mol). In 1855, larger quantities of lithium were produced through the electrolysis of lithium chloride by Robert Bunsen and Augustus Matthiessen. The discovery of this procedure led to commercial production of lithium in 1923 by the German company Metallgesellschaft AG, which performed an electrolysis of a liquid mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.|$|E

5|$|The Court neither {{expressly}} rejected nor {{affirmed the}} abolition of the distinction in Anisminic and its effect on the effectiveness of ouster clauses. Instead, the Court cited UK authorities holding that ouster clauses are ineffective when there has been an absence of jurisdiction or an excess of jurisdiction {{on the part of the}} decision-maker, a position which characterized the law prior to Anisminic. The Court did refer to Anisminic but only <b>to</b> <b>observe</b> <b>that</b> the House of Lords had held the ouster clause involved in that case to be irrelevant because a purported determination by the Foreign Compensation Commission which was legally incorrect could not be considered a real determination and had no effect at all. Ultimately, the Court quashed the order made by the Industrial Arbitration Court because it contained an error of law which had caused that court to exceed its jurisdiction.|$|E

During an audition tape, he is shown gutting a fish to prove he could perform on Deal or No Deal, even though the action is far more appropriate for Survivor. During one scene, to Leslie's shock and confusion, Tammy said she would rather be Cleopatra, the last pharaoh of Egypt's Ptolemaic dynasty, than Eleanor Roosevelt, the former First Lady and wife of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt.|$|E

25|$|The Grothendieck group. In K-theory, {{the point}} of {{departure}} is <b>to</b> <b>observe</b> <b>that</b> the category of vector bundles on a topological space has a commutative monoid structure under direct sum. One may make an abelian group out of this monoid, the Grothendieck group, by formally adding an additive inverse for each bundle (or equivalence class). Alternatively one can observe that the functor that for each group takes the underlying monoid (ignoring inverses) has a left adjoint. This is a once-for-all construction, {{in line with the}} third section discussion above. That is, one can imitate the construction of negative numbers; but there is the other option of an existence theorem. For the case of finitary algebraic structures, the existence by itself can be referred to universal algebra, or model theory; naturally there is also a proof adapted to category theory, too.|$|E
25|$|In 1954, Herb Wagner, {{who did not}} {{yet have}} access to live material, noted that the size of the guard cells in A.×kentuckiense {{suggested}} that it was triploid, consistent with its proposed parentage. He also noted that, in theory, the crossing of mountain spleenwort (A.montanum) with Tutwiler's spleenwort (A.tutwilerae) or of A.bradleyi with walking fern (A.rhizophyllum) could also produce A.×kentuckiense. Smith, Bryant, and Tate obtained live material in 1961, which allowed them <b>to</b> <b>observe</b> <b>that</b> the species is indeed triploid, and that no pairing of homologous chromosomes occurred during meiosis. This strongly supported the hypothesis that A.×kentuckiense developed from the crossing of A.pinnatifidum and A.platyneuron, as the former species is not descended from A.platyneuron. Chromatographic experiments reported in 1963 showed that, like A.×gravesii, chromatograms made from A.×kentuckiense contained all the compounds from the chromatograms of all three of its diploid ancestors: A.montanum, A.platyneuron, and A.rhizophyllum.|$|E
25|$|On the Union left, Burnside's IX Corps {{approached}} on the Fredericksburg Road from Alrich, led by Brig. Gen. Orlando B.

At this same time, Hancock was reporting from the right flank that Early's men had pulled back from his front. Grant absorbed these two observations and concluded that the Confederates were shifting their men from west to east, opening an opportunity for an attack. He ordered Hancock to cross the Po and attack the Confederates' left flank, driving them back toward Burnside's position near the Ni River, while the rest of his command, in the center, watched for an opening to attack there as well.|$|E
