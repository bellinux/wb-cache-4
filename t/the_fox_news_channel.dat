40|$|This thesis argues that, in key {{nineteenth century}} texts, humor {{is a means}} of {{fostering}} group identity and a mode of social critique. The chapter ???Boundary Maintenance in Early American Humor??? looks at humor as a form of boundary maintenance in both Augustus Baldwin Longstreet???s ???Character of a Native Georgian??? (1835) and Mark Twain???s The Tragedy of Pudd???nhead Wilson (1894). In ???The Character of a Native Georgian,??? humor is primarily an inclusive force, as it is used to promote solidarity within the group and promote assimilation without, while in Pudd???nhead Wilson humor is an exclusive force used to strengthen divides among groups by lending itself to the maintenance of the rigid structures in place that limit social mobility. ???Missing the Mark??? explores the consequences of humor that fails in some way by looking at two recent, comedic television shows: <b>the</b> <b>Fox</b> News <b>Channel???s</b> <b>news</b> program parody The Half Hour News Hour (2007) and Comedy Central???s sketch comedy program Chappelle???s Show (2003 - 2006). Both shows had difficulties controlling their audiences??? reaction to their attempts at humor. ??????Inappropriate??? Humor??? considers the potential benefits of ???inappropriate??? humor by looking at an episode of Matt Stone and Trey Parker???s South Park entitled ???Death??? (1997). There appears to be value in offending audiences, as it invites discussion. The chapter also considers the role satirists play in disrupting the status quo and giving voice to marginalized viewpoints. CSU, Chic...|$|R
40|$|I {{hypothesize that}} the crimes {{committed}} by male African American criminals on Fox News will be described using the reporting verb say by victims and witnesses more frequently than the {{crimes committed by}} male Caucasian criminals. In contrast, I hypothesize that the crimes committed by male Caucasian criminals on Fox News will be described using the negative reporting verb claim by victims and witnesses more frequently than the crimes committed by male African American criminals. It is also hypothesized that the active voice will be used more frequently to describe the actions of male African American criminals than {{it will be for}} male Caucasian criminals, while the passive voice will be used more frequently to describe the actions of male Caucasian criminals than it will be for male African American criminals. Although racism is not as apparent as it was before, it is argued by Entman (1992, 1990) that a more subtle form of racism still exists. The news is an example of this subtle type of racism; even though it is prohibited to broadcast a report with racially offensive language, the choice of specific words and grammar suggests a racial bias. This study examines the frequency of the reporting verbs say/said and claim/claimed among Caucasian and African American criminals on <b>the</b> local <b>Fox</b> <b>news</b> <b>channel</b> (<b>Fox</b> 59 News). <b>The</b> reporting verbs were chosen {{as a result of an}} hour pre-viewing of Fox 59 News. Because the words were used in the pre-viewing, they were selected for the study. The reporting verb claim is described as ‘negative’ while the reporting verb say is described as neutral on the basis of former literature on these two verbs. Additionally, the frequency of active and passive voice will be examined among both races. The active voice is used to indicate that the subject is performing the action (e. g. ‘he killed the man’). The passive voice is used to indicate that the subject is being the recipient of the action (e. g. ‘the man was killed’). The active and passive voice were chosen for the study because it is argued that crimes are less accepted when using the active voice while crimes that use the passive voice are viewed as more acceptable (Henley and Miller, 1995). The two reporting verbs and the active and passive voice will be collected by watching ‘Fox 59 News at 10 on <b>the</b> <b>Fox</b> channel each night for a period of ten weeks. Each newscast will be recorded, and the two reporting verbs, as well as the instances of active and passive voice will be counted to determine 1) the frequency of the reporting verbs and active/passive voice overall (of both racial groups in ten weeks) 2) the frequency of the reporting verbs and active/passive voice about each racial group in the ten week period and 3) the frequency of the reporting verbs used by victims/witnesses and the criminals themselves and the frequency of the active/passive voice used by police/detectives/investigators, victims/witnesses and reporters. The results of this study will portray the harmful depictions of minority groups on <b>the</b> local <b>Fox</b> <b>news</b> (<b>Fox</b> 59). <b>The</b> depictions of African American criminals on Fox are harmful because the audience is likely to apply exaggerated descriptions of the race to the real world. It is especially harmful since the local area (Indianapolis) is predominantly White. Because of this fact, it is more difficult for the local community to construct their own perspectives on African Americans based on personal observations and experiences. The issue of African American stereotypes will continue unless people are aware of this issue. It is hoped that by portraying the unfair treatment of African Americans on Fox News, viewers will not assume that African Americans are more likely to commit crimes. Moreover, the results will help to develop awareness to those who believe that racism is no longer an issue in our society. This paper begins with the introduction. The introduction includes the general and specific objectives and goals of the study, the hypotheses and the significance of the study. Chapter two contains the literature review, which provides information on previous literature that is relevant to my topic. The third chapter provides, in detail, the method used for the study. The method used is justified by demonstrating how it will prove or disprove my hypotheses. The paper concludes with the results and the discussion of the study. Department of EnglishThesis (M.

40|$|Too often critics treat <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> populist {{brand and}} voice, {{its claim to}} stick up for the little guy as a gimmicky type of charlatanism {{that is used to}} convey simple and {{misleading}} news stories. However, in this dissertation, I demonstrate how <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> populist journalistic style is in fact a sophisticated and complex form of political communication, one that requires great performative skill to embody, a deep knowledge of traditional political discourses, and an astute awareness of the key social and cultural cleavages active in a given historical moment. To capture <b>the</b> complexity of <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> populist mode of address, in this study, I conduct a critical-textual analysis of <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> top three programs during the late- 2000 s Recession : Glenn Beck, Hannity, and The O'Reilly Factor. This involves a close reading of <b>the</b> "imagined community" <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> style is designed to address and how its style is crafted to create a political identity for viewers. While partisan identification with the Republican Party and political conservatism defines the broadest parameters of <b>Fox's</b> imagined community, <b>the</b> real power and ideological utility of <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> mode of address, I argue, derive from its cultural referents, particularly, how it aligns deep moral values and social archetypes from the American populist rhetorical tradition with the political right, marking populism as conservative. In {{the first half of this}} dissertation, I develop a theoretical model for interpreting <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> unique populist address, which includes an analysis of how <b>Fox</b> <b>News's</b> top programs attempt to draw symbolic linkages between political conservatism and the white working- class.
