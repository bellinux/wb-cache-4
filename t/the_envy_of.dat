5|$|Dunstan {{soon became}} a {{favourite}} of the king and was <b>the</b> <b>envy</b> <b>of</b> {{other members of the}} court. A plot was hatched to disgrace him and Dunstan was accused of being involved with witchcraft and black magic. The king ordered him to leave the court and as Dunstan was leaving the palace his enemies physically attacked him, beat him severely, bound him, and threw him into a cesspool. He managed to crawl out and make his way to the house of a friend. From there, he journeyed to Winchester and entered the service of his uncle, Ælfheah, Bishop of Winchester.|$|E
5|$|To silence Luna, Aguinaldo {{appointed}} him as Chief of War Operations on 26 September 1898, and assigned {{the rank of}} brigadier general. In quick succession, he was made the Director or Assistant Secretary of War and Supreme Chief of the Republican Army on 28 September, arousing <b>the</b> <b>envy</b> <b>of</b> the other generals who were fighting since {{the first phase of}} the Revolution. Meanwhile, Luna felt that bureaucratic placebos were being thrown his way, when all he wanted was to organize and discipline the enthusiastic but ill-fed and ill-trained troops into a real army.|$|E
5|$|Ancient lore {{states that}} Vana'diel was {{created as a}} {{playground}} for the Gods and their children, who themselves were spawned from an enormous and sentient Crystal. Eventually wishing to be one with the Gods, the children constructed a pathway to paradise. They were smote down for their insolence, however, and their cities cast {{to the bottom of}} the sea. After seeing the destruction of her children and filled with sadness, the Goddess Altana wept five tears that gave life to the five Enlightened Races of Vana'diel. The God of Twilight, Promathia, condemned her weakness, however, and the life that arose from it. Promathia cursed the five races with eternal conflict amongst themselves by bringing forth their darkest attributes: the apathy of the Humes, the arrogance of the Elvaan, the rage of the Galka, the cowardice of the Tarutaru, and <b>the</b> <b>envy</b> <b>of</b> the Mithra. He created the Beastmen, commanding them to forever fight the people of Vana'diel and occupy their minds, so these children would never have time to group together and construct a pathway like the ones before them. The creation lore's sentient Crystal, Gods, Children, and the truths behind them feature as major plot points in several Final Fantasy XI expansion packs, while the Beastmen are some of the game's main antagonists.|$|E

5|$|The {{unitary state}} {{was not an}} end in itself, but a means to higher ends. The {{republic}} had been in dire financial straits even before the revolution of 1795. The system of public finance that had been <b>the</b> <b>envy</b> <b>of</b> the world in its Golden Age, enabling it to throw far beyond its weight in world politics up to the Peace of Utrecht in 1713, had become a millstone around its neck. By 1713 the public debt of the province of Holland had reached 310 million guilders; the debt of the Generality was 68 million; and the debts of the smaller provinces, and of the cities came on top of this. The debt service of Holland alone in that year required 14 million guilders, which exceeded its regular tax revenue. Most of this humongous public debt was held by Dutch private citizens, {{so in a sense}} it merely engendered an internal money circuit in the Dutch economy. However, it was mostly concentrated {{in the hands of the}} rentier class, while the debt was serviced by mainly regressive taxes that weighed on the working population. Most importantly, these were taxes levied by the individual provinces, who serviced their own debt, and paid into the Generality coffers according to a repartition schedule last changed in 1616. Attempts to reform this structure during the 18th century were mainly fruitless.|$|E

25|$|The Harold R Henderson Pavilion is {{the latest}} stand to be built. It was {{constructed}} in the late '60s following the club's disastrous move to the Coburg City Oval.

40|$|We {{examined}} whether counterfactual thinking influences <b>the</b> experience <b>of</b> <b>envy.</b> Counterfactual thinking {{refers to}} comparing {{the situation as}} it is to what it could have been, and these thought processes have been shown to lead to a variety of emotions. We predicted that for <b>envy</b> <b>the</b> counterfactual thought “it could have been me” would be important. In four studies we found a clear link between such counterfactual thoughts and <b>the</b> intensity <b>of</b> <b>envy.</b> Furthermore, Studies 3 and 4 revealed that a manipulation known to affect the extent of counterfactual thinking (the perception of being close to obtaining the desired outcome oneself), had an effect on <b>the</b> intensity <b>of</b> <b>envy</b> via counterfactual thoughts. This relationship between counterfactual thinking and <b>the</b> experience <b>of</b> <b>envy</b> allows for new predictions concerning situations under which envy is likely be more intense.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s the Bulldogs under coach Ted Glossop who came to the club in 1978 played an exciting and skilful brand of football that got them named The Entertainers. With brilliant halfback Steve Mortimer the linchpin, the Bulldogs as they were to be named in 1978 played a brand of football that was <b>the</b> <b>envy</b> <b>of</b> the Sydney Premiership.|$|E

5000|$|Contemporaneously, Sigmund Freud's {{psychosexual}} development {{theory is}} criticized as sexist, {{because it was}} informed with his introspection (self-analysis). To integrate the female libido (sexual desire) to psychosexual development, he proposed that girls develop [...] "penis envy". In response, the German Neo-Freudian psychoanalyst Karen Horney, counter-proposed that girls instead develop [...] "Power envy", rather than penis envy. She further proposed the concept of [...] "womb and vagina envy", <b>the</b> male's <b>envy</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> female ability to bear children; yet, contemporary formulations further develop said <b>envy</b> from <b>the</b> biologic (child-bearing) to <b>the</b> psychologic (nurturance), <b>envy</b> <b>of</b> women's perceived right {{to be the kind}} parent.|$|R

25|$|King Charles III, {{feeling that}} the {{national}} pride of Spain had been offended by the Algerines, resolved to punish them by bombarding their town. Rear admiral Antonio Barceló was appointed {{to carry out the}} attack. Though he was by far the most capable naval officer of Spain {{and one of the few}} who had risen through the ranks by merit, Barceló's designation was coldly received both by the Spanish court and military. The Rear admiral was old and illiterate and of humble extraction, which, together with his naval victories, earned him <b>the</b> <b>envy</b> <b>of</b> most the senior Spanish officers.|$|E

It is said that Dole loved {{to go up in}} his tower (currently closed off) and watch his horses run. When tired of the fad of his stable, he disposed of his beautiful and valuable horses by holding an elaborate sale. The Doles lived in the mansion until the late 1890s when the property was sold to his son in law for $1.00.|$|E
25|$|In 1864 this {{pavilion}} {{was erected}} {{on the first}} Canterbury Cricket Club's grounds, called Dilloway's, {{in order to be}} ready in time for the visit of an English eleven, captained by George Parr. In the match against Canterbury the English team won convincingly but were impressed by the facilities provided at the grounds at the north-western corner of South Hagley Park (by the junction of Deans and Riccarton Avenues). The well prepared field was neatly fenced and the handsome pavilion, <b>the</b> <b>envy</b> <b>of</b> other local clubs still using tents on match days, provided fine accommodation. Of timber construction the pavilion was built to a traditional English design and provided changing facilities, a communal area for meetings and teas, an open verandah and a viewing balcony.|$|E

40|$|Envy {{functions}} in resource competition {{situations in which}} a competitor out-competes oneself in a fitness relevant domain (Hill & Buss, 2006, 2008). Research {{suggests that there are}} two types <b>of</b> <b>envy,</b> a hostile version, aimed at depriving <b>the</b> <b>envied</b> person <b>of</b> his or her advantage, and a benign version, aimed at gaining an advantage for oneself (Parrott, 1991; van de Ven, Zeelenberg, & Pieters, 2009). Three predictions were derived from the hypothesis that <b>the</b> selection <b>of</b> <b>envy</b> type is functional, taking into account {{the costs and benefits of}} a benign versus a hostile response: 1) Hostile envy was expected to be more likely when the advantage can’t be acquired without taking it from <b>the</b> <b>envied.</b> 2) Benign envy was expected to be more likely when the relationship with <b>the</b> <b>envied</b> person is highly valuable to <b>the</b> <b>envier.</b> 3) Benign envy was expected to be more likely when the social environment favors <b>the</b> <b>envied</b> person. Additionally, <b>the</b> emotions experienced as part <b>of</b> <b>envy</b> were proposed to mediate the relationships between elements of the situation and responses to envy. Using a daily diary method, participants described their everyday experiences <b>of</b> <b>envy,</b> which were categorized as benign or hostile based on taxometric and latent class analyses. Prediction 1 was fully supported and prediction 2 was largely supported. Prediction 3 was not supported; instead participants’ beliefs about <b>the</b> <b>envied</b> person’s deservingness directly affected envy type. Mediation analyses supported the proposal that emotions mediate the relationships between situations and responses. The degree to which <b>the</b> <b>envied</b> person’s possession <b>of</b> <b>the</b> advantage makes it harder for <b>the</b> <b>envier</b> to get emerged as an important factor in how one responds to hostile <b>envy.</b> PsychologyDoctoralUniversity <b>of</b> New Mexico.
