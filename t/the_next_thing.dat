5|$|Vulović {{was in a}} coma for {{ten days}} after the crash. She {{sustained}} severe brain damage, having fractured her skull and then hemorrhaged. In addition, she suffered two broken legs and three broken vertebrae, one of which was crushed completely. Her pelvis was fractured and several ribs broken. Her injuries resulted in her being temporarily paralyzed below the waist. She had total amnesia from the hour preceding her fall until one month afterwards. Vulović's parents told her that she first learned of the crash about two weeks after it occurred. She fainted upon being shown a newspaper headline by her doctor and had to be tranquilized. The last thing that Vulović could remember from before the crash was greeting passengers as they boarded. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> she remembered was seeing her parents in her hospital room about one month later.|$|E

25|$|Dreams do {{not involve}} {{actually}} sensing a stimulus because, as discussed, the senses do not work as they normally do during sleep. In dreams, sensation is still involved, but in an altered manner than when awake. Aristotle explains the phenomenon that occurs when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water. When they look away from that stimulus, <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> they look at appears to be moving in a wave like motion. When a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus {{is no longer the}} focus of their attention, it leaves an impression. When the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly, a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions left from previously perceived stimuli become irrelevant. However, during sleep the impressions stimuli made throughout the day become noticed because there are not new sensory experiences to distract from these impressions that were made. So, dreams result from these lasting impressions. Since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli, dreams will not resemble the actual experience that occurred when awake.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the first}} season {{primarily}} deals {{with the murder of}} Veronica's best friend, Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried), and the murder is resolved in [...] "Leave It to Beaver", another arc running throughout the season is the story of Veronica's mysterious rape a year earlier. At that time, Veronica went to a party at a wealthy student, Shelly's, house. There, she was slipped a mysterious drink, and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> she knew, she woke up in an unidentified bed missing her underwear", indicating that she had been raped. The next day, she walked into the sheriff's department and reported the crime, where Sheriff Don Lamb (Michael Muhney) mocked her predicament and refused to conduct an investigation, leaving Veronica in tears.|$|E
500|$|In October 2011, Kevin Feige, {{president}} of Marvel Studios said the studio {{was beginning to}} look at their Phase Two films, which would start with Iron Man 3 and would culminate in a second Avengers film. In March 2012, Joss Whedon, director of the first film, stated that he would want a sequel to be [...] "smaller. More personal. More painful. By being <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> that should happen to these characters, and not just a rehash of what seemed to work the first time. By having a theme that is completely fresh and organic to itself." [...] Despite the production of the film becoming increasingly wider in scope, Feige maintained that this was not their intention, always looking to see where the team wanted to take the characters, over how to make it bigger than The Avengers.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 2000s, the tour {{began to be}} re-examined by critics, and {{the tone of the}} {{coverage}} began to change. In 2009, an article in the BBC News singled out the Glass Spider Tour's innovative set and marriage of music and theatre as an inspiration to later acts, including Britney Spears, Madonna, U2 and others. Stage designer Willie Williams said the Glass Spider Tour was a template for those acts: [...] "There will be one set of costumes and they will do a few songs, then there will be another big scene change and move on to <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing.</b> Bowie crossing rock 'n' roll with Broadway [...] was where that began." [...] In 2010, the Glass Spider Tour won an award for being one of the best concert designs of all time (alongside other such notable tours as U2's 360° Tour [...] and Pink Floyd's Division Bell Tour [...] ).|$|E
500|$|Signs {{of missing}} footage from the Sellers {{segments}} are evident at various points. Evelyn Tremble is not captured on camera; an outtake of Sellers entering a racing car was substituted. In this outtake, {{he calls for}} the car, à la Pink Panther, to chase down Vesper and her kidnappers; <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> that is shown is Tremble being tortured. Out-takes of Sellers were also used for Tremble's dream sequence (pretending {{to play the piano}} on Ursula Andress' torso), in the finale - blowing out the candles whilst in highland dress - {{and at the end of}} the film when all the various [...] "James Bond doubles" [...] are together. In the kidnap sequence, Tremble's death is also very abruptly inserted; it consists of pre-existing footage of Tremble being rescued by Vesper, followed by a later-filmed shot of her abruptly deciding to shoot him, followed by a freeze-frame over some of the previous footage of her surrounded by bodies (noticeably a zoom-in on the previous shot).|$|E
500|$|The Skelton family {{received}} {{support from}} CBS management {{and from the}} public following the announcement of Richard's illness. Skelton himself was beset by a serious illness and by a household accident which kept him off the air. He suffered a life-threatening asthma attack on December 30, 1957, and was taken to St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, where his doctors said that [...] "if there were ten steps to death, Red Skelton had taken nine of them {{by the time he}} had arrived". Initially hospitalized for an indeterminate length of time, Skelton later said he was working on some notes for television and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> he remembered, he was in a hospital bed; he did not know how serious his illness was until he read about it himself in the newspapers. His illness and recovery kept him off the air for a full month; Skelton returned to his television show on January 28, 1958.|$|E

500|$|On July 26, 2002, {{only a week}} or {{two before}} signing a record {{contract}} with Universal South Records, West had an injury to his left arm which threatened his musical career and guitar playing. He says, [...] "I locked myself out of my house. But I'd done that before, and I had a way of breaking in through a window. But this time, I had a really hard time getting the window open. I started pushing up on the window really hard and my hand broke through the glass. Blood starting spewing out of my left arm everywhere and I ran down my street screaming for help. After seeing so much blood, I went into shock and just blacked {{out in the middle of}} the street. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> I can remember is some construction workers praying over me in Spanish and then being taken to the hospital." [...] West was told that the chances were low of regaining the full use of his left arm, having come very close to severing a major artery. He recovered after the accident, however, and was able to continue playing guitar and record for his first studio album.|$|E
500|$|Before the trial, Martin made a {{statement}} explaining that he killed Lowe in self-defence. He said he had fallen asleep after checking in, but woke up after someone touched his buttocks; it was Lowe, who was clad only in his underwear and smiling at him. To him, this behaviour made Lowe {{appear to be a}} homosexual, so he kicked Lowe away. This angered Lowe, who threw Martin's hammer at his stomach. Martin then grabbed the hammer and [...] "hit [...] several times on the head until he collapsed onto the carpeted floor." [...] A friend later helped him to dispose of Lowe's body by throwing it into the Singapore River. Martin continued, [...] "I am not sure what was <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> I did... everything was such a blur to me after this incident that I was walking around in a dream world for the next few days." [...] He refused to identify his friend, saying, [...] "I cannot tell you his identity because if he knew he would harm my family back in Britain." [...] On 15 March, he flew to Phuket, where he met his friend again. His friend gave him the passports and other items belonging to the Damudes, whom he never met.|$|E
500|$|Considering Kiedis had resumed heavy {{drug use}} and Frusciante was no longer present for collaboration, songs were written at a far slower rate. Working with Frusciante had been {{something}} Kiedis took for granted: [...] "John Frusciante had been a true anomaly {{when it came to}} song writing. He made it even easier than Hillel Slovak to create music, even though I'd known Hillel for years. I just figured that was how all guitar players were, that you showed them your lyrics and sang a little bit and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> you knew you had a song. That didn't happen right off the bat with Dave." [...] Drummer Chad Smith suggested it was writer's block that was holding Kiedis back from coming up with lyrics, however Kiedis strongly denied this. With the writing process taking too much time and Kiedis returning to his drug habit, Flea {{for the first time on}} any of the band's albums, besides contributing music as usual, took over and wrote some of the song's lyrics, including [...] "Transcending", his tribute to River Phoenix along with the intro and outro to [...] "Deep Kick", a song that told the story of his and Kiedis's youth. [...] Also for the first time on any album, Flea contributed lead vocals which he performed on his solo track titled [...] "Pea".|$|E

Mercedes realised {{that she will}} be blamed for stalking Mitzeee so she stabbed herself to convince people Mitzeee was mad. Metcalfe said the situation was born through [...] "pure desperation". She said that [...] "the thought of Mitzeee, Riley and Bobby as a family together was too much for her to take, and she just saw red. I don't think it's something that Mercedes thought about or planned - she wouldn't have even dreamed of doing it to herself. But at the time, she saw it as the only way out of the situation". Shenton explained that Mitzeee was worried due to the stalker so she decided to take some antidepressants and drink wine, which as she states [...] "isn't a great combination." [...] Shenton revealed that Mercedes arrived to see Mitzee who [...] "still has no idea who the stalker really is, but as they're talking, Mercedes says something that makes Mitzeee discover the truth - and she's totally shocked. Mitzeee is petrified and picks up a knife in the kitchen. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> you know, Mitzeee wakes up after being unconscious [...] The first thing she sees is Mercedes with a stab wound and there is blood everywhere.

He woke up soon after, he said, and loaded his uncle's shotgun, intending to kill himself. [...] "Next thing I knew," [...] he continued, [...] "I was on the street." [...] He told Dolan {{that he had seen}} people [...] "as if they were on television". He heard the sound of a gun being fired as if it were coming from far away, and remembered a voice that was not his own saying [...] "Put up your hands". He then remembered hearing the dim, far-off gun again, a vision of a terrified man standing before him, then yet another shot. He told Dolan he remembered crossing the street, seeing a girl's outline in a doorway and [...] "somehow" [...] shooting at her. Lamb then said he had fired at a passing car, and that [...] "everything seemed unreal." [...] He said that <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>thing</b> he had memory of was confronting an elderly lady at a house nearby, suddenly thinking [...] "what the hell am I in here for" [...] and leaving. He concluded his account by saying that he had hailed a cab from the corner of Pillette and Tecumseh Road and gone back to his uncle's house.|$|E
