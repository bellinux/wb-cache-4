Sea bottom measurements reveal channellized flows at velocities of hundreds of metres per year and <b>total</b> <b>outflows</b> from the toes of a few hundreds of square metres per year. Thermal arguments show in the Nankai area that all of this large surface flow cannot come from as deep as the decollement and that consequently a significant dilution by shallow sea water convection must be present. We propose that this convection is driven by the reduced density of less saline fluid of deep origin. Thus the outflow of water of deep origin may be only a few tens of square metres per year. We note, however, that there are indications in the Barbados area of massive flow of low salinity water at depth along the decollement. These flows imply the existence of large scale non-steady-state lateral transport and require the existence of sources of low salinity water. These might include the smectite-illite trans-formation and the fluid contained in the oceanic crust. However, these sources are limited and the possibility exist that other more important sources may be required such as long distance transport of fresh water from adjacent sedimentary basins and (or) recharge mechanisms such as the seismic pumping one. 1...|$|R

The source velocities, beam powers, ambient gas densities, total lifetimes, and <b>total</b> <b>outflow</b> energies are presented and discussed. The {{rate of growth of}} each side of each source were obtained using a spectral aging analysis. The beam power and ambient gas density were obtained by applying the strong shock jump conditions to the ends of each side of the source. The <b>total</b> <b>outflow</b> lifetime was obtained by applying the power-law relationship between the beam power and the total source lifetime derived elsewhere for sources of this type, and the <b>total</b> <b>outflow</b> energy was obtained by combining the beam power and the total source lifetime. Composite profiles were constructed by combining results obtained from each side of each source. The composite profiles indicate that the ambient gas density falls with distance from the central engine. The source velocities, beam powers, total lifetimes, and total energies seem to be independent of radio source size. This is consistent with the standard model in which each source grows at a roughly constant rate during which time the central engine puts out a roughly constant beam power. The fact that the total source lifetimes and energies are independent of radio source size indicates that the sources are being sampled at random times during their lifetimes. 1...|$|E

40|$|A {{numerical}} circulation {{model of}} Tampa Bay, Florida {{is used to}} simulate the flow field and tidal residual circulation for 2001 - 2004. This model is used to investigate the effects of extreme events on the residual circulation of the bay. The three extreme events {{that are used in}} this study are: Hurricane Frances, Hurricane Jeanne, and an extreme winter frontal passage that occurred on December 26, 2004. Each extreme event was divided into phases that were chosen by wind peaks and times of velocity inflow and outflow. There were three phases to the hydrodynamics effect of Frances on Tampa Bay. Hurricane Jeanne and the winter frontal passage each had two phases. An important difference between the three extreme events is the duration of each; Hurricane Frances lasted approximately two and a half days, Hurricane Jeanne affected the bay area for about twenty-four hours, and the extratropical storm passed within 16 hours. Winds were six standard deviations higher than the 2004 mean (4. 06 m s- 1) during Hurricane Frances, and seven standard deviations higher during both Hurricane Jeanne and the extratropical storm. Water levels reached four standard deviations during Hurricane Frances and the extratropical storm, and two standard deviations during Hurricane Jeanne. The difference between these results is due to the timing of each event with the tides, whether it was in or out of phase with the tides. During phase 2 of Hurricane Frances there was a total volume inflow of m 3, for an increase of 60 % in bay volume. There was a <b>total</b> volume <b>outflow</b> during phase 3 of m 3, a 28 % decrease.
