500|$|In June 2012 the Dumas was {{conveyed}} to new owners, locals Michael Piche and Travis Eskelson. By this time however, {{the building was}} in great disrepair; among other things, there was water damage, a collapsed wall and no structurally sound roof. The new owners planned to have summer tours for $8 in the following year, but their ultimate goal was turning the Dumas into a bed and breakfast. [...] "It needs to be around. It needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> {{the rest of the}} community and {{the people who want to}} visit it," [...] said Piche. In late 2013 the duo sought a loan from the local urban revitalization body in Butte. The requested amount was $92,000 with an additional $8,750 grant. As of December 2013, tours were still being offered at the Dumas on a limited basis.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2010–11 season, Aulie was {{assigned}} to the Marlies after training camp with the Maple Leafs. [...] He was later called up to the NHL on November 12, 2010, when Dion Phaneuf was injured. Aulie played his first career NHL game the next day against the Vancouver Canucks, playing 12 games total with the Maple Leafs in his call-up before ultimately being returned to the Marlies. Despite the time he spent away from the AHL, Aulie was selected to the Western Conference team for the AHL All-Star Game. During the Skills Competition, Aulie competed in the hardest shot event, finishing third, with a top speed of 95.5mph. After the Maple Leafs traded defenceman François Beauchemin to the Anaheim Ducks, Aulie was called up to rejoin the team. Maple Leafs General Manager Brian Burke said {{one of the reasons for}} the trade was to open up a spot at the NHL level for Aulie: [...] "...as soon as we get a roster spot, we're calling up Keith Aulie. We expect him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> a while." [...] Aulie engaged in his first career NHL fight against Scott Hartnell of the Philadelphia Flyers, earning him the nickname [...] "Muhammad Aulie." [...] He scored his first career NHL goal against the New York Islanders on March 9, 2011.|$|E
2500|$|On July 19, 2013, in Riverside Superior Court, Miller {{was sentenced}} to death. On August 16, 2013 Cox and John were sentenced. Cox {{was sentenced to}} two life terms without parole. Cox showed no remorse stating, [...] "I {{apologize}} {{for what happened to}} the victims' family. I didn't say I'm sorry I did anything because I still don't feel that I did anything <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> it." [...] He also said he would appeal. John, the gunman, was given the death penalty. Judge Christian Theirbach called the murders savage, and the most inhuman he had seen in his 27 years on the bench.|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{appeared}} <b>to</b> me <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a quixotic action," [...] the Marquis assented. [...] "However, indirectly it {{has been}} conducive of good--it has brought me a great pleasure. I have missed you very much, Marcia.

6000|$|... "Stop!" [...] {{cried the}} lawyer, obliged to speak very loudly, for Bob was some {{distance}} away before he had ceased speaking. [...] "That man has a perfect right <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>here,</b> <b>for</b> he represents the court {{in the matter of}} holding certain movable property until the suit can be decided. What you are to do is simply to prevent unauthorized persons from gaining admittance." ...|$|E
60|$|EVE. You say we {{must not}} cease to exist. But you used to {{complain}} of having to exist always and for ever. You sometimes sit for hours brooding and silent, hating me in your heart. When I ask you what I have done to you, {{you say you are}} not thinking of me, but of the horror of having <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> ever. But I know very well that what you mean is the horror of having to be here with me for ever.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, Mr. Mayor," [...] he said, [...] "I {{hope you}} have a good list of {{recruits}} for me. I don't want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> waiting <b>here,</b> <b>for</b> I have to go on a similar errand to other towns. It is not a job I like, I can tell you, but it is not for me to question orders." ...|$|R

I did not happen <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> some unexplained purpose. I was lying awake and {{something}} attracted my attention. As Mrs. Pett knows, I was suspicious of this worthy and expected him to make an attempt on the explosive at any moment: so I took my pistol and crept downstairs. When I got here, the safe was open and this man making for the window." ...|$|E
6000|$|At this direct appeal, and to no one's wonder {{more than}} that of his aunt, Mr. Harry Warrington blushed, and hemmed and ha'd and at length said, [...] "I have promised my cousin Castlewood {{to go over to}} Hexton Petty Sessions with him to-morrow. He thinks I should see how the Courts here are conducted--and--and--the partridge-shooting will soon begin, and I have promised <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> that, ma'am." [...] Saying which words, Harry Warrington looked as red as a poppy, whilst Lady Maria held her meek face downwards, and nimbly plied her needle.|$|E

Do you know, I get so immoderately sick of Bath; your brother and I were agreeing this morning that, though it is vastly well <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> a few weeks, we would not live here for millions. We soon found out that our tastes were exactly alike in preferring the country to every other place; really, our {{opinions}} were so exactly the same, it was quite ridiculous! There was not a single point in which we differed; I would not have had you by for the world; you are such a sly thing, I am sure you would have made some droll remark or other about it." ...|$|E

"Well, {{there is}} nothing to do but to wait until we get a {{definite}} answer from him; and my instructions are that, if I find that he is not a desirable man to have to deal with, I am to enter into negotiations with other rajahs, and to endeavor to do something to open the trade of the river and to render it safe for merchants who come up to trade. If Hassan's account of this man's doings is correct, he is the main cause of the falling off in the trade, and, moreover, the author of the piracies of which we have had so many complaints; indeed, it is possible that when the Governor learns the true state of things, I may get an order to present an ultimatum to this fellow and to sink his piratical craft. At any rate, we may make up our minds <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> some time." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{have gone}} on and on most abominably and inexorably owing you a letter since a date so distant that I {{associate}} the time intimately with the admirable summer, here, that we so long ago left behind and of which Harry will--at a period by this time quite prehistoric--have given you something of the pleasant little story. But the sense always abides with me that when I am for weeks and months together dumb--as I know I more than once have been--you and William are quite de force to read into it all the kindly extenuations I require. I have in fact, for many weeks, down here, been taking the general line of saving up all the cerebration not imperatively drained off {{from day to day}} for a long job that I have had to carry through under the nightmare of belatedness--a belatedness so great (produced by time lost originally in arranging this place, moving down, taking possession, etc.) as to leave me no margin whatever for accident, indisposition or languor. My capacity for the distillation of prose of decent quality remains, alas, with all the amendments time has brought it, still, each day, so limited that I get awfully nervous under a very continuous task unless I by certain flagrant sacrifices keep up to myself the fiction of freshness--of not getting simply sick, in other words, by adding any writing that I haven't absolutely to do to the quantity that is each morning imposed. So the sacrifices, for a long time past, have been, as usual, my correspondence, and as the most tender morsels for the Moloch you and William naturally en première ligne. The Moloch at last, however--since these four or five days, has been temporarily appeased; and I have instantly begun to transfer my attention from one form of belatement to another. I am working off arrears of letters, and if I take you, dearest Alice, in the heap, I at least pay you the sweet tribute of taking you first. You have been without sign or sound of me so long that I daresay you may have even wild imaginings about my [...] "location" [...] and other conditions. I am located only just where Harry left me and where I have stuck fast since July last without the excision of twenty-four hours. The autumn and the early winter have followed the ardent summer here only to multiply my points of contact with my environment and to saturate me more deeply with the grateful sense of it. This contentment has defied all winds and weathers--in plenty of which we have for the last two months rejoiced. I like to send all our little news of such matters in the form of news to Harry in particular, whose mind is furnished with the proper little hooks for it to hold on by. Tell him then, since I won't attempt to burden him individually with acknowledgements that will overload him, that everything he fancied and fondled here only kept growing, all the autumn long, more adapted to such a relation, and that in short both the little brown city and the so amiable countryside were not in July and August a [...] "patch," [...] for charm, colour, [...] "subtlety" [...] and every kind of daily grace, to what they became, in an uninterrupted crescendo, all through October and November. All the good that I hoped of the place has, in fine, profusely bloomed and flourished here. It was really at about the end of September, when the various summer supernumeraries had quite faded away, that the special note of Rye, the feeling of the little hilltop community, bound together like a very modest, obscure and impecunious, but virtuous and amiable family, began most unmistakably to come out. This is the present note of life here, and it has floated me (excuse mixture of metaphor) very placidly along. Nothing would induce me now not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> Christmas and nothing will induce me not to do my best at least <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>for</b> the protrusion of the bulbs--the hyacinths and tulips and crocuses--that, in return for expended shillings, George Gammon promises me for the earliest peep of spring. As he has broken no word with me yet, I trust him implicitly for this. Meantime too I have trusted him, all the autumn, for all sorts of other things as well: we have committed to the earth together innumerable unsightly roots and sprigs that I am instructed to depend upon as the fixed foundation of a future herbaceous and perennial paradise. Little by little, even with other cares, the slowly but surely working poison of the garden-mania begins to stir in my long-sluggish veins. Tell Harry, as an intimate instance, that by a masterly inspiration I have at one bold stroke swept away all the complications in the quarter on which the studio looks down, uprooting the wilderness of shrubs, relaying paths, extending borders, etc., and made arrangements to throw the lawn, in one lordly sweep, straight up into that angle--a proceeding that greatly increases our apparent extent and dignity: an improvement, in short, quite unspeakable. But the great charm is the simply being here, and in particular the beginning of the day no longer with the London blackness and foulness, the curtain of fog and smoke that one has each morning muscularly to lift and fasten back; but with the pleasant, sunny garden outlook, the grass all haunted with starlings and chaffinches, and the in-and-out relation with it that in a manner gilds and refreshes the day. This indeed--with work and a few, a very few, people--is the all. But that is just the beauty. I've missed nothing that I haven't been more than resigned to. There have been a few individuals from Saturday to Monday, and one--Jonathan Sturges, whose identity, if it is too dim for you, it would take me too long to explain--ever since mid-October. He remains till over Christmas; but save as making against pure intensity of concentration, he is altogether a boon. I go to town the last of the month, but only for two or three weeks and in a pure picnicking way. I have a plan and a desire really to achieve this winter after an intermission of five years, ten or twelve weeks in Italy; and it now seems probable I shall do so. I shall not know with absolute definiteness till I go to London; but the omens and portents are favourable. On my return I shall come straight down here, and I already foresee how the thought of the spring here will draw me from almost wherever I may at that time be. I shall write you again, however, about this; so that you shall definitely know what becomes of me. You see this is a pure outpouring of the ego. I am after all without fresh news of yourselves to rebound from. The latest and best is William's kind dispatch to me of his [...] "Immortality" [...] lecture, for which I heartily thank him, and which I have read with great appreciation of the art and interest of it. I am afraid I don't very consciously come in to either of the classes it is designed to pacify--either that of the yearners, I mean, or that of the objectors. It isn't the difficulties that keep me from the yearning--it is somehow the lack of the principle of the same. However, I go not now into this. I only acknowledge, till {{after the turn of the}} year I write to him, William's communication of the book. Every illustration of his magnificent activity--at the spectacle of which I am condemned to such a woefully back seat--gives me more joy than I will now pretend to express. For the rest, dearest Alice, take from me all my [...] "hopes"; the inevitable vain ones about your household health and happiness and the complexion and outlook of the season for all of you. I try to see you all as cheerfully and gregariously--yet not, for the dignity of each, too much of the latter--fire-lighted and eke furnace-heated. Strange things contend with this image--wild newspaper blizzards and other public bewilderments. Are you individually expanding?--I mean even to the islands of the sea. I myself have no policy. I have no judgment. I am too far and too unadvised and too out of it and too [...] "subtle," [...] also, to see gospel truth in all the so genial encouragement that our swelling state finds, naturally and very logically, in this country. That the two countries should swell together offers material convenience--and that is for much. But I only meant to ask if William and you and the children are definitely in or out of the swell. I will be myself wherever you are.... Yours dearest Alice, always constantly, ...|$|E
