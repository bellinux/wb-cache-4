500|$|Three {{days before}} the day the bomb was to be test detonated in the New Mexico desert, Bacher {{was part of the}} pit {{assembly}} team, which assembled the nuclear capsule (a cylindrical section of the uranium tamper, containing the plutonium core and initiator) in an old farmhouse near the Alamogordo testing site. When the capsule was driven to the shot tower and inserted into the spherical tamper, inside the explosive assembly, it stuck. [...] Bacher recognized that expansion of the capsule due to the heat given off by the plutonium core was causing the jam, and that leaving the two parts in contact would equalize temperatures and allow the capsule <b>to</b> be <b>inserted</b> <b>fully.</b> After watching the test, his reaction was merely [...] "Well, it works." ...|$|R

40|$|The TileCal Demonstrator is a {{prototype}} {{for a future}} upgrade to the ATLAS hadron calorimeter when the Large Hadron Collider increases luminosity in year 2023 (HL-LHC). It {{will be used for}} functionality and performance tests. The Demonstrator has 48 channels of upgraded readout and digitizing electronics and a new digital trigger capability, but is backwards-compatible with the present detector system insofar as it also provides analog trigger signals. The Demonstrator is comprised of 4 identical mechanical mini-drawers, each equipped with up to 12 photomultipliers (PMTs). The on-detector electronics includes 45 Front-End Boards, each serving an individual PMT; 4 Main Boards, each to control and digitize up to 12 PMT signals, and 4 corresponding high-speed Daughter Boards serving as data hubs between on-detector and off-detector electronics. The Demonstrator is fully compatible with the present system, accepting ATLAS triggers, timing and slow control commands for the data acquisition, detector control, and detector operation monitoring. We plan <b>to</b> <b>insert</b> one <b>fully</b> functional Demonstrator module into the present ATLAS TileCal detector for the LHC RUN 2 in August 2014. This paper will only cover the design of the Main Board...|$|R

The reason why the EPS-5 button was pressed is not known, whether it was done as an emergency measure in response to rising temperatures, or simply as a routine method of shutting down the reactor {{upon completion of the}} experiment.|$|R

The slight indentations left on the wood by the checkered face are considered unimportant in rough carpentry. Framing hammers also have a much straighter claw than regular claw hammers, as the claw is designed more for prying nailed boards apart, rather than removing nails (though its claw {{can also be used}} in that capacity).|$|R
40|$|This review {{looks at}} the {{implementation}} of magnetic-based approaches in surgical instruments for abdominal surgeries. As abdominal surgical techniques advance toward minimizing surgical trauma, surgical instruments are enhanced to support such an objective through the exploration of magnetic-based systems. With this design approach, surgical devices are given the capabilities <b>to</b> be <b>fully</b> <b>inserted</b> intraabdominally <b>to</b> achieve access to all abdominal quadrants, without the conventional rigid link connection with the external unit. The variety of intraabdominal surgical devices are anchored, guided, and actuated by external units, with power and torque transmitted across the abdominal wall through magnetic linkage. This addresses many constraints encountered by conventional laparoscopic tools, such as loss of triangulation, fulcrum effect, and loss/lack of dexterity for surgical tasks. Design requirements of clinical considerations to aid the successful development of magnetic surgical instruments, are also discussed...|$|R
5000|$|The early [...] "screw" [...] {{mechanisms}} for sealing the breech consisted of threaded blocks which were screwed tightly into the breech after loading, but the threads themselves were insufficient {{to provide a}} gas-tight seal. This was further complicated {{by the need to}} screw and unscrew the breech as quickly as possible; this was met by the [...] "interrupted thread" [...] breech block, where the block circumference was alternately threaded and left unthreaded at a slightly smaller diameter to allow the whole block <b>to</b> be <b>fully</b> <b>inserted</b> and rotated a fraction to lock it. Hence if the block circumference was divided into two sets of threads and gaps, the block only needed to be rotated ¼ turn to lock it instead of several turns. The tradeoff was that only ½ the block's circumference was threaded, reducing the security accordingly.|$|R
5000|$|All {{these actions}} {{led to an}} {{extremely}} unstable reactor configuration. Nearly all of the control rods were removed manually, including all but 18 of the [...] "fail-safe" [...] manually operated rods of the minimal 28 which were intended <b>to</b> remain <b>fully</b> <b>inserted</b> <b>to</b> control the reactor even {{in the event of}} a loss of coolant, out of a total 211 control rods. While the emergency SCRAM system that would insert all control rods to shut down the reactor could still be activated manually (through the [...] "AZ-5" [...] button), the automated system that could do the same had been disabled to maintain the power level, and many other automated and even passive safety features of the reactor had been bypassed. Further, the reactor coolant pumping had been reduced, which had limited margin so any power excursion would produce boiling, thereby reducing neutron absorption by the water. The reactor was in an unstable configuration that was outside the safe operating envelope established by the designers. If anything pushed it into supercriticality, it was unable to recover automatically.|$|R
40|$|Pressure-drop {{measurements}} were made across a mockup of a Hallam prototype fuel element {{in a test}} section installed in the Hallam Hydraulic Loop. The flow channel was identical to an SRE fuel channel and included simulated upper and lower plenums. The fuel element mockup was equipped with a Hallam-type variable orifice at the channel exit and a fixed orifice in the strainer basket {{at the bottom of}} the element. Tests were performed to determine the optimum size for the fixed orifice and the temperature adjustment capability of the variable orifice using this optimum fixed orifice. To obtain the predicted 4. 1 lb/sec sodium coolant requirement at a core pressure drop of 1. 85 psi, a 3 / 4 in. fixed orifice was determined to be the optimum. With this fixed orifice size the variable orifice will be approximately 1 in. withdrawn during full-power operation. Adjusting the orifice over its entire range of 3 in. from <b>fully</b> <b>inserted</b> <b>to</b> <b>fully</b> withdrawn covers a temperature range from 875 to 1040 deg F which is approximately plus or minus 80 'F about the normal outlet temperature of 960 deg F. Curves are presented for use in determination of operating characteristics of the element with other fixed orifice sizes should the core pressure drop or required flow rate of coolant be changed.

40|$|The CaBPs {{represent}} a subfamily of small EF-hand containing calcium (Ca 2 +) -sensing proteins related to calmodulin that regulate key ion channels in the mammalian nervous system. In a recent bioinformatic analyses we determined that CaBP 7 and CaBP 8 form an evolutionarily distinct branch within the CaBPs (also {{known as the}} calneurons) a finding {{that is consistent with}} earlier observations characterising a putative C-terminal transmembrane (TM) spanning helix in each of these proteins which is essential for their sub-cellular targeting to the Golgi apparatus and constitutive secretory vesicles. The C-terminal position of the predicted TM-helix suggests that CaBP 7 and CaBP 8 could be processed in a manner analogous to tail-anchored integral membrane proteins which exhibit the ability <b>to</b> <b>insert</b> across membranes posttranslationally. In this study we have investigated the topology of CaBP 7 and CaBP 8 within cellular membranes through a combination of trypsin protection and epitope accessibility analyses.

The observed type-II membrane topology is consistent with processing of CaBP 7 and CaBP 8 as true tail-anchored proteins.
