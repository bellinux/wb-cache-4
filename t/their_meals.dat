5|$|Carbohydrates are {{classified}} {{according to their}} glycemic index, a system for measuring how quickly a food that is eaten raises blood sugar levels, and glycemic load, which takes into account both the glycemic index {{and the amount of}} carbohydrate in the food. This has led to carbohydrate counting, a method used by diabetics for planning <b>their</b> <b>meals.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alcatraz cellhouse had a {{corridor}} naming system named after major American streets and landmarks. Michigan Avenue was {{the corridor to}} the side of A-Block, and Broadway was the central corridor in which the inmates would assemble as they massed through Times Square (an area with a clock on the wall), before entering the dining hall for <b>their</b> <b>meals.</b> Broadway separated Block-B and Block-C and prisoners kept along it had the least privacy in the prison. The corridor between Block-C and the library was called Park Avenue. The corridor in D-Block was named Sunset Strip. Gun galleries lay {{at the end of each}} block, including the West and East Gun Galleries.|$|E
5|$|Designed both to {{accelerate}} future elections and reduce outside interference, {{the rules of}} Ubi periculum provide for the cardinal electors to be secluded for {{the entirety of the}} conclave, including having <b>their</b> <b>meals</b> passed through a small opening, and for their rations to be reduced to a single meal at the end of three days, or bread and water (with a little wine) after eight days. Cardinals also do not collect from the Apostolic Camera any payments they might otherwise receive during the conclave.|$|E

5|$|There {{are some}} {{variations}} in the foods that are eaten around the different areas of Wales. These variations trace their roots back to medieval cooking. Ingredients were historically limited by what could be grown; the wetter climate in highland areas meant that crops were restricted to oats, whilst the more fertile lowland areas allowed the growth of barley or wheat. Coastal inhabitants {{were more likely to}} include seafood or seaweed in <b>their</b> <b>meals,</b> whilst those living inland would supplement their farmed cereals with the seeds of land weeds to ensure there was enough to eat.|$|E
5|$|Troop kitchens, rolling galleys, {{also joined}} the trains to provide meal service en route (the troops took <b>their</b> <b>meals</b> {{in their seats}} or bunks). As the cooking was {{performed}} by regular U.S. Army cooks, the cars were outfitted with two Army-standard coal ranges. The cars were also equipped {{with a pair of}} 200-gallon cold water tanks and a 40-gallon hot water tank; supplies were stocked on open shelves with marine-type railings, a bread locker, a large refrigerator, and a series of built-in cabinets and drawers. The cars served approximately 250 men each, and were typically placed {{in the middle of the}} train so that food could be served from both ends.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{few months}} of the {{founding}} of the Swan River Colony in June 1829 by free-settlers, there was a need for a prison to incarcerate criminals. There was little infrastructure for the settlers, let alone criminals, so the shipwrecked Marquis of Angelsea, just off the coast from South Beach, was used as a makeshift prison. This arrangement was quite arduous for the sheriff, who spent much of his time rowing a small boat, either to transfer prisoners or bring over <b>their</b> <b>meals.</b> It was not until September 1830 that work started on a new prison at the west end of High Street: the twelve-sided Round House on Arthur Head.|$|E

5|$|Living {{quarters}} for the senior officers consisted of eight separate well-furnished cabins, each {{provided with a}} small oak table and chair, an oil lamp, shelves and drawers and a canvas floor covering covered with a rug. The entire crew were given goat-skin mats to sleep on. Lighting for each living area was provided by small skylights in the deck above, which were covered by an iron hatch during battle. The officer's wardroom was located forward of the berth deck where officers would eat <b>their</b> <b>meals,</b> hold meetings or socialize during what little spare time they had. It was well furnished with an oriental rug, a large oak table and other such items. Ericsson had personally paid for the costs of all the officer's furnishings.|$|E
5|$|On {{the south}} {{eastern side of}} the house is an orangery, which was built as a {{greenhouse}} in 1701 and has a glazed roof which was added around 1800 by Humphrey Repton. The orangery hides the view of the servants' quarters from the main house. The servants' quarters was revised and modernised in the 1840s. It contains the kitchen, dairy, bakehouse and several larders for raw and cooked meat. There is also a servants' hall where the staff would take <b>their</b> <b>meals</b> and a tenants' hall which was used by the tenant farmers to eat on the days when they came to pay their rent. In addition to the designs for the house, William Talman created the large 15-bay stable block. It is now used as a tea-room for visitors.|$|E
5|$|When {{the ship}} became trapped in pack ice his duties {{expanded}} to constructing makeshift housing, and, once {{it became clear}} that the ship was doomed, to altering the sledges for the journey over the ice to open water. He built the quarters where the crew took <b>their</b> <b>meals</b> (nicknamed The Ritz) and cubicles where the men could sleep. These were all christened as well; McNish shared The Sailors' Rest with Alfred Cheetham, the Third Officer. Assisted by the crew, he constructed kennels for the dogs on the upper deck. Once Endurance became trapped, and the crew were spending the days on the ice, McNish erected goalposts and football became a daily fixture for the men. To pass the time in the evening, McNish joined Frank Wild, Tom Crean, James McIlroy, Worsley and Shackleton playing poker in the wardroom.|$|E
5000|$|Description — For this {{challenge}} teams prepared and cooked in-flight meals for Jetstar flight passengers. Each team prepared 40 portions of <b>their</b> <b>meal</b> {{to be served}} to on-board passengers for scoring out of 10. The team who receives the highest score, wins the Passenger's choice and will have <b>their</b> <b>meal</b> served on select Jetstar flights for three months. The judges once again sent the two weakest teams to Sudden Death.|$|R

5|$|Among {{the men of}} Ifaluk atoll, costly {{signalling}} {{theory can}} also explain why men torch fish. Torch fishing is a ritualized method of fishing on Ifaluk whereby men use torches made from dried coconut fronds to catch large dog-toothed tuna. Preparation for torch fishing requires significant time investments and involves {{a great deal of}} organization. Due to the time and energetic costs of preparation, torch fishing results in net caloric losses for fishers. Therefore, torch fishing is a handicap that serves to signal men’s productivity. Torch fishing is the most advertised fishing occupation on Ifaluk. Women and others usually spend time observing the canoes as they sail beyond the reef. Also, local rituals help to broadcast information about which fishers are successful and enhance fishers’ reputations during the torch fishing season. Several ritual behavioural and dietary constraints clearly distinguish torch fishers from other men. First, males are only permitted to torch fish if they participated {{on the first day of}} the fishing season. The community is well informed as to who participates on this day, and can easily identify the torch fishers. Second, torch fishers receive all of <b>their</b> <b>meals</b> at the canoe house and are prohibited from eating certain foods. People frequently discuss the qualities of torch fishermen. On Ifaluk, women claim that they are looking for hard-working mates. With the distinct sexual division of labor on Ifaluk, industriousness is a highly valued characteristic in males. Torch fishing thus provides women with reliable information on the work ethic of prospective mates, which makes it an honest costly signal.|$|E
25|$|The eating clubs, {{located on}} Prospect Avenue, are co-ed {{organizations}} for upperclassmen. Most upperclassmen eat <b>their</b> <b>meals</b> {{at one of}} the eleven eating clubs. Additionally, the clubs serve as evening and weekend social venues for members and guests.|$|E
25|$|BC Penitentiary {{contained}} the standard {{features of a}} maximum security prison of its era. These included, among other things, cell blocks, offices, a hospital, a kitchen, work and school facilities, and two chapels (one Catholic, one Protestant). One peculiarity {{was that there was}} no dining hall; the inmates thus had to eat <b>their</b> <b>meals</b> in their cells.|$|E
60|$|After having {{finished}} <b>their</b> <b>meal,</b> Mr. George and Rollo {{set out to}} take a ramble {{about the}} town by themselves.|$|R

25|$|In supermax, {{prisoners are}} {{generally}} allowed {{out of their}} cells for only one hour a day (one-and-a-half hours in California state prisons); often they are kept in solitary confinement. They receive <b>their</b> <b>meals</b> through ports in the doors of their cells. When supermax inmates are allowed to exercise, this may {{take place in a}} small, enclosed area where the prisoner will exercise alone.|$|E
25|$|Smashers {{possess a}} much more {{developed}} club and a more rudimentary spear (which is nevertheless quite sharp and still used in fights between their own kind); the club is used to bludgeon and smash <b>their</b> <b>meals</b> apart. The inner aspect of the terminal portion of the appendage can also possess a sharp edge, used to cut prey while the mantis shrimp swims.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} a decline of hunting {{partially}} {{due to the fact}} that young people lack the skills to survive off the land. They are no longer skilled in hunting like their ancestors and are growing more accustomed to the Qallunaat ("white people") food that they receive from the south. The high costs of hunting equipment—snowmobiles, rifles, sleds, camping gear, gasoline, and oil—is also causing a decline in families who hunt for <b>their</b> <b>meals.</b>|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} 1846 the {{settlement}} had grown to 180 residents — 56 men, 37 women, and 87 children and youth under age 21. Of these, there were 36 families and 30 single adults. This would mark the peak membership for the Ceresco association. Ominously for {{the fate of the}} collective enterprise, only a minority of Ceresco associationists were eating together at the general table by this date, with 100 people part of the 21 families which prepared <b>their</b> <b>meals</b> and ate as traditional nuclear units.|$|E
25|$|The {{refectory}} was {{the room}} in which the monks had <b>their</b> <b>meals</b> everyday. While they ate, one of the monks read aloud passages of the Bible from a pulpit, which in Alcobaça is embedded {{on one of the}} walls. The access to the pulpit is done through an arched gallery with a staircase. The pulpit {{is one of the most}} harmonious architectural structures of the monastery. Like the dormitory, the refectory has many pillars separating aisles and is covered by early gothic rib vaulting.|$|E
25|$|A {{distinct}} {{feature of}} Bangkok is {{the ubiquity of}} street vendors selling goods ranging from food items to clothing and accessories. It {{has been estimated that}} the city may have over 100,000 hawkers. While the BMA has authorised the practice in 287 sites, the majority of activity in another 407 sites takes place illegally. Although they take up pavement space and block pedestrian traffic, many of the city's residents depend on these vendors for <b>their</b> <b>meals,</b> and the BMA's efforts to curb their numbers have largely been unsuccessful.|$|E
60|$|When {{they had}} {{finished}} <b>their</b> <b>meal,</b> {{which was about}} as sad an entertainment as can well be conceived, they began to talk.|$|R
