5|$|Kansas Turnpike mileposts are {{continuous}} {{along the}} entire length of the turnpike. Mile markers begin at the point where I-35 enters Kansas at the southern border. <b>These</b> <b>numbers</b> are continued along the other three Interstates that make up the turnpike, rather than numbering each Interstate individually, leading to discontinuous numbering on I-70—the exit numbers on tolled I-70 are much lower than those on free I-70.|$|E
5|$|Some modern {{scholars}} have accepted <b>these</b> <b>numbers,</b> {{especially since the}} ancient sources are unusually consistent on this point.

5|$|The allies had no 'standing army', nor {{was there}} any {{requirement}} to form one; since they were fighting on home territory, they could muster armies as and when required.

5|$|The {{number of}} {{personnel}} aboard {{is in some}} doubt, but an estimate of 638 was published in The Times. It is generally thought that the survivors comprised 113 soldiers (all ranks), 6 Royal Marines, 54seamen (all ranks), 7women, 13children {{and at least one}} male civilian, but <b>these</b> <b>numbers</b> cannot be substantiated, as muster rolls and books were lost with the ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{result that}} 0.999... = 1 generalizes readily in two ways.

5|$|According to an IAU draft resolution, the {{roundness}} condition generally {{results in}} {{the need for a}} mass of at least 5 kg, or diameter of at least 800km. However, Mike Brown claims that <b>these</b> <b>numbers</b> are only right for rocky bodies like asteroids, and that icy bodies like Kuiper Belt objects reach hydrostatic equilibrium at much smaller sizes, probably somewhere between 200 and 400km in diameter. It all depends on the rigidity of the material that makes up the body, which is in turn strongly influenced by its internal temperature. Assuming that Methone's shape reflects the balance between the tidal force exerted by Saturn and the moon's gravity, its tiny 3km diameter suggests Methone is composed of icy fluff.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{reliable}} documentation of the demographic impact of the Black Death in Scotland, there are some indications of the immediate effects of the plague. Walter Bower recorded that 24, about a third, of the canons of St. Andrews died during the outbreak. There are also anecdotal references to abandoned land in the following decades. If the pattern followed that in England, then the population may have fallen to as low as half a million {{by the end of}} the fifteenth century. Compared with the distribution of population after the later Clearances and the Industrial Revolution, <b>these</b> <b>numbers</b> would have been relatively evenly spread over the kingdom, with roughly half living north of the River Tay.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Imperial Census of 1897, the {{population}} of the approximate area of modern Odessa Oblast was 1,115,949. According to that census, 33.9% of the population was ethnic Ukrainian, 26.7% was ethnic Russian, 16.1% was ethnic Jewish, 9.2% was ethnic Moldavian, 8.6% was ethnic German, 2% was ethnic Polish, and 1.6% was ethnic Bulgarian. <b>These</b> <b>numbers</b> show that there was a high level of ethnic diversity in the region, and that no group had an outright majority.|$|E
25|$|Under Napoléon, {{the numbers}} and {{responsibilities}} of the gendarmerie, renamed gendarmerie impériale, were significantly expanded.

The telescope's measurements were to be used in conjunction with other, currently available, data to provide astronomers with the first total mass measurements of individual galaxies. <b>These</b> <b>numbers</b> would enable scientists to estimate the spatial distribution of dark matter in the local group of galaxies, and by extension, throughout the universe.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) listed P.parienti, P.electromontis, and P.pallescens as endangered, and P.furcifer as vulnerable. Before this assessment, it {{was assumed}} that their {{population}} was in decline due to habitat destruction for the creation of pasture and agriculture. Measures of their population density vary widely, from 50 to 550 individuals per square kilometer (250acres), but <b>these</b> <b>numbers</b> are thought to reflect only small, gum-rich areas, and therefore only small, clustered populations with an overall low population density.|$|E
