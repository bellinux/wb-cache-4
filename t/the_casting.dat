5|$|The dies are {{designed}} so that the finished casting will slide off the cover half of the die {{and stay in the}} ejector half as the dies are opened. This assures that <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> will be ejected every cycle because the ejector half contains the ejector pins to push <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> out of that die half. The ejector pins are driven by an ejector pin plate, which accurately drives all of the pins {{at the same time and}} with the same force, so that <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> is not damaged. The ejector pin plate also retracts the pins after ejecting <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> to prepare for the next shot. There must be enough ejector pins to keep the overall force on each pin low, because <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> is still hot and can be damaged by excessive force. The pins still leave a mark, so they must be located in places where these marks will not hamper the casting's purpose.|$|E
5|$|After {{allowing}} {{himself to}} be used by <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> director, Harry gets a small role as a cop in the film for which he had previously been rejected. On-set he impresses the producers and they offer him a part in a TV series.|$|E

5|$|After the {{shakeout}} of <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> it is inspected for defects. The {{most common}} defects are misruns and cold shuts. These defects {{can be caused}} by cold dies, low metal temperature, dirty metal, lack of venting, or too much lubricant. Other possible defects are gas porosity, shrinkage porosity, hot tears, and flow marks. Flow marks are marks left on the surface of <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> due to poor gating, sharp corners, or excessive lubricant.|$|E
5|$|Draft is {{the amount}} of slope or taper given to cores or other parts of the die cavity to allow for easy {{ejection}} of <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> from the die. All die cast surfaces that are parallel to the opening direction of the die require draft for the proper ejection of <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> from the die. Die castings that feature proper draft are easier to remove from the die and result in high-quality surfaces and more precise finished product.|$|E

5|$|The {{high-pressure}} injection {{leads to}} a quick fill of the die, which is required so the entire cavity fills before any part of <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> solidifies. In this way, discontinuities are avoided, even if the shape requires difficult-to-fill thin sections. This creates the problem of air entrapment, because when the mold is filled quickly there is little time for the air to escape. This problem is minimized by including vents along the parting lines, however, even in a highly refined process {{there will still be}} some porosity in the center of <b>the</b> <b>casting.</b>|$|E
5|$|A teleporting mutant. This was will.i.am's major live-action film debut. Although he {{initially}} {{did not get}} on with <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> director, he got the role {{because he wanted to}} play a mutant with the same power as Nightcrawler.

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates {{microstructure}} and creep behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>cast</b> alloy Ti- 46 A 1 - 2 W- 0. 5 Si (at-%) at temperatures 700, 750 and 800 °C and applied stresses between 250 - 420 MPa. Solidification of the alloy during precision casting {{is associated with}} two processes: (i) {{the growth of the}} [0001]. alpha. oriented columnar grains from the mould wall into <b>the</b> <b>cast</b> interior and (ii) the enrichment of the central part of <b>the</b> <b>cast</b> with aluminium. <b>The</b> first process results in a fully lamellar microstructure where lamellae are preferentially oriented parallel to <b>the</b> <b>cast</b> surface. <b>The</b> second process contributes {{to the development of the}} duplex microstructure in the central part of <b>the</b> <b>cast.</b> It is shown that distinct microstructural types in different regions of <b>the</b> <b>cast</b> result in different creep strengths. Specimens taken from inside of <b>the</b> <b>cast</b> and oriented parallel to <b>the</b> <b>cast</b> bar axis exhibited the lowest creep strength while similarly oriented specimens cut from the fully lamellar region near <b>the</b> <b>cast</b> surface were <b>the</b> strongest. The third type of the creep specimens cut out of the central region of <b>the</b> <b>cast</b> and oriented perpendicular to <b>the</b> <b>cast</b> bar axis showed the intermediate creep strength. The observed variations of the creep strength are associated with the preferential orientation of the lamellas and with the fraction of equiaxed. gamma. -grains in the duplex regions of <b>the</b> <b>cast...</b>|$|R

5|$|According to <b>the</b> <b>casting</b> director, Newt was {{the most}} {{difficult}} role to cast: Schoolchildren were auditioned, but many of them had acted in commercials and were accustomed to smiling after saying their lines.
