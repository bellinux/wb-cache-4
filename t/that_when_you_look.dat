500|$|Arsenal only {{managed a}} draw against West Bromwich Albion on 20 November 2004; Robert Earnshaw's goal with 11 minutes {{remaining}} of normal time cancelled out Pirès’s opener. Arsenal lost their final match of November, away to Liverpool at Anfield. Vieira finished off a one-touch move to equalise for Arsenal – who were {{behind in the}} first half – but Neil Mellor scored the winning goal of the game, shooting from long range. Football pundit Alan Hansen in his analysis on Match of the Day criticised the temperament of Arsenal’s players and questioned their desire: [...] "When you have success, sometimes it isn't there and you have to dig in with great determination and hard work, and at the moment they are not doing <b>that.</b> <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at their two big players, Henry and Vieira, [...] must do better in future." [...] Arsenal ended the month in second, five points behind leaders Chelsea.|$|E
500|$|Saw 3D {{was shot}} entirely in RealD 3D using the SI-3D digital camera system; rather than filming on set {{traditionally}} and later transferring the footage to 3D. Before choosing 3D, Burg and others viewed {{a minute of}} the original Saw film rendered in 3D and were pleased, which led to them choosing 3D for the seventh film. [...] The sets and traps were designed {{to take advantage of}} 3D. To continue the fast pace of the previous films, the SI-3D cameras' light weight allowed three-quarters of film to be shot handheld. Saw 3D was Greutert's first time directing a 3D film. He {{said in an interview with}} Popular Mechanics that composing a shot in 3D was tricky compared to 2D; he explained, [...] "If you've got both cameras looking at a subject and there's a very bright sheen on the side of the person's arm that only one camera can see, there's a good chance <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at a composite of the two images that sheen will not register in 3D space. It looks like a mistake. These things aren't an issue at all in 2D but in 3D are obsessively problematic". Given the cost of filming in 3D, Greutert said the budget was $17 million, the most expensive of the series. Principal photography began on February 8, 2010, in Toronto, Ontario, and wrapped on April 12, 2010. Filming took place mostly at Toronto's Cinespace Film Studios.|$|E
2500|$|Research in 2011 by Ropars et al., {{confirms}} {{that one can}} identify {{the direction of the}} sun to within a few degrees in both cloudy and twilight conditions using the sunstone and the naked eye. [...] The process involves moving the stone across the visual field to reveal a yellow entoptic pattern on the fovea of the eye. Alternatively a dot can be placed on top of crystal so <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at it from below, two dots appear, because the light is “depolarised” and fractured along different axes. The crystal can then be rotated until the two points have the same luminosity. The angle of the top face now gives the direction of the sun. Attempts to replicate this work in both Scotland and off the coast of Turkey by science journalist Matt Kaplan and mineralogists at The British Geological Survey in 2014 failed. Kaplan communicated extensively with Ropars and neither could understand why the samples of Iceland spar that were being used during the trials did not reveal the sun's direction.|$|E

6000|$|So {{naturally}} Central Square {{with its}} trees and its fountains and its statues {{is one of}} the places of chief interest in the City. But especially because there stands along one side of it the vast pile of the Grand Palaver Hotel. It rises fifteen stories high and fills all one side of the square. It has, overlooking the trees in the square, twelve hundred rooms with three thousand windows, and it would have held all George Washington's army. Even people in other cities who have never seen it know it well from its advertising; [...] "the most homelike hotel in America," [...] so it is labelled in all the magazines, the expensive ones, on the continent. In fact, the aim of the company that owns the Grand Palaver--and they do not attempt to conceal it--is to make the place as much a home as possible. Therein lies its charm. It is a home. You realize <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> up at the Grand Palaver from the square at night when the twelve hundred guests have turned on the lights of the three thousand windows. You realize it at theatre time when the great string of motors come sweeping to the doors of the Palaver, to carry the twelve hundred guests to twelve hundred seats in the theatres at four dollars a seat. But most of all do you appreciate the character of the Grand Palaver when you step into its rotunda. Aladdin's enchanted palace was nothing to it. It has a vast ceiling with a hundred glittering lights, and within it night and day is a surging crowd that is never still and a babel of voices that is never hushed, and over all there hangs an enchanted cloud of thin blue tobacco smoke such as might enshroud the conjured vision of a magician of Baghdad or Damascus.|$|E

60|$|This {{small lake}} was of most {{value as a}} {{neighbor}} in the intervals of a gentle rain-storm in August, when, both air and water being perfectly still, but the sky overcast, mid-afternoon had all the serenity of evening, and the wood thrush sang around, and was heard from shore to shore. A lake like this is never smoother than at such a time; and the clear portion of the air above it being, shallow and darkened by clouds, the water, full of light and reflections, becomes a lower heaven itself so much the more important. From a hill-top near by, where the wood had been recently cut off, there was a pleasing vista southward across the pond, through a wide indentation in the hills which form the shore there, where their opposite sides sloping toward each other suggested a stream flowing out in that direction through a wooded valley, but stream there was none. That way I looked between and over the near green hills to some distant and higher ones in the horizon, tinged with blue. Indeed, by standing on tiptoe I could {{catch a glimpse of}} some of the peaks of the still bluer and more distant mountain ranges in the northwest, those true-blue coins from heaven's own mint, and also of some portion of the village. But in other directions, even from this point, I could not see over or beyond the woods which surrounded me. It is well to have some water in your neighborhood, to give buoyancy to and float the earth. One value even of the smallest well is, <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> into it you see that earth is not continent but insular. This is as important as that it keeps butter cool. When I looked across the pond from this peak toward the Sudbury meadows, which in time of flood I distinguished elevated perhaps by a mirage in their seething valley, like a coin in a basin, all the earth beyond the pond appeared like a thin crust insulated and floated even by this small sheet of interverting water, and I was reminded that this on which I dwelt was but dry land.|$|E

[...] Then you like nothing in Nature (for you will find she always carries her detail too far to be traced). This point, however, we shall examine hereafter; {{it is not the}} question now whether we like finish or not; our only inquiry here is, what finish means; and I trust the reader is beginning to be satisfied that it does indeed mean nothing but consummate and accumulated truth, and that our old monotonous test must still serve us here as elsewhere. And it will become us to consider seriously why (if indeed it be so) we dislike this kind of finish--dislike an accumulation of truth. For assuredly all authority is against us, and no truly great man can be named in the arts--but it is that of one who finished to his utmost. Take Leonardo, Michael Angelo, and Raphael for a triad, to begin with. They all completed their detail with such subtlety of touch and gradation, that, in a careful drawing by any of the three, you cannot see where the pencil ceased to touch the paper; the stroke of it is so tender, <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> close to the drawing you can see nothing; you only see the effect of it a little way back! Thus tender in execution,--and so complete in detail, that Leonardo must needs draw every several vein in the little agates and pebbles of the gravel under the feet of the St. Anne in the Louvre. Take a quartett after the triad--Titian, Tintoret, Bellini, and Veronese. Examine the vine-leaves of the Bacchus and Ariadne, (Titian's) in the National Gallery; examine the borage blossoms, painted petal by petal, though lying loose on the table, in Titian's Supper at Emmaus, in the Louvre, or the snail-shells on the ground in his Entombment;[44] examine the separately designed patterns on every drapery of Veronese, in his Marriage in Cana; go to Venice and see how Tintoret paints the strips of black bark on the birch trunk that sustains the platform in his Adoration of the Magi: how Bellini fills the rents of his ruined walls with the most exquisite clusters of the erba della Madonna.[45] You will find them all in a tale. Take a quintett after the quartett--Francia, Angelico, Durer, Hemling, Perugino,--and still the witness is one, still the same striving in all to such utmost perfection as their knowledge and hand could reach.|$|E

40|$|Politicians {{as well as}} {{entrepreneurs}} are surrounded by random preconceived notions, some <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> closely {{turn out to be}} incorrect and others that turn out to be rather close to the real picture. In the rather widely debated issue of contempt towards politicians the traditional politician {{has been described as a}} person who says one thing but does another. The entrepreneur on the other hand is described by many as curious, creative, independent, devoted, optimistic and visionary. This paper will put the entrepreneurial politician in focus and study if and how the political evolution is affected when the politicians act more according to the stereotype of an entrepreneur than that of a politician. It will put the entrepreneurial political into context. The empirical material will be constituted by the study of a number of municipal politicians active in two municipalities in Norway (Lierne and Røyrvik) and parts of two municipalities in Sweden (Frostviken and Hotagen). These study objects were chosen due to the fact that there is an ongoing project in the region in question where the four entities together are involved in a cross-national attempt to solve rather traditional peripherality issues. What separates these politicians from other politicians in demographically and economically challenged municipalities is how they have made an attempt to think “outside of the box”. They have used a different rhetoric and an unconventional way of thinking about problem solving. These politicians are visionaries, dreamers and acteurs who have decided to take the measures necessary to stop the downward spiral of development in their home regions. In the cases that will be examined it has also been possible to find actors that directly or indirectly have opposed the work in progress or have regarded it with scepticism and/or indifference. But who will have the last laugh? Will it be the entrepreneurial politician who sees his home district rise above its difficulties or will it be the sceptical spectator? This paper is just a draft paper aiming to present upcoming research. </p...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} about how a system can help or improve the {{possibilities}} for a distributed group to achieve consensus. Prior research shows that: ”Computermediated discussion groups take more time to make decisions, are more prone toward conflict, and, most importantly, have more difficulty achieving consensus” The main thought behind this thesis {{is that if a}} computer system can help and guide the group through a better and more effective decisionmaking process, which can help the group to reach consensus, there is much to win. Therefore an embedded structure have been designed and implemented in a collaboration system to see if and how the embedded structure can improve the groups possibilities to achieve consensus. An experiment have been set up, where six groups have tried to solve “The Foundation Task”, a “multiattribute decision problem” with the goal to achieve consensus. Three groups have used the system with the embedded structure and three groups without. In that way it is possible to analyse how the embedded structure influence the possibilities for consensus. There are three main results from the experiment. The first is that the embedded structure have a huge impact on the groups decisionmaking process. The groups with the embedded structure work more organised and more seldom loose focus on the task, and they work more thoroughly with the task. The groups without the embedded structure use a more “laissez faire” approach which means that they for example more often becomes victims to group thinking, and in the work process the discussion more often ends in an tangent and the group losses focus. The conclusion is that the embedded structure have an heavy and apparently positive impact on the process. The second result from the experiment is that even though {{there is a big difference}} between the processes there is no difference between how the group members feel about the level of consensus. All the participant feel content and happy with the groups result, and they all feel that the group reached a satisfying consensus. The third result is <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> at the “real” level of consensus, there is a difference. When the participants from the groups with the embedded structure solve the task individually after the experiment, their solution is much more like the solution the group made, compared with the groups without the embedded structure. That means there is a gap between what the participant experience and feel, and how it really is. All in all this thesis shows that there is several things to gain with a embedded structure, but to put this knowledge into practice it is necessary with more research about for example how a embedded structure affects other types of tasks and why and how the difference between the experienced and the “real” level of consensus is handled...|$|E
