5|$|As {{an obsessive}} new mother {{who has spent}} many an hour {{hovering}} over my son with a thermometer and a pre-emptive bottle of Calpol, Rachel's contention that she didn't want <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> dinner with Adam because she couldn't bear to leave three-month-old Matthew {{in the care of}} their best friend's children's nanny was just one niggling implausibility too far. After three months of being on baby duty 24 hours a day, every woman I've ever come across has, ordinary guilt aside, all but wept with joy at the prospect of a bowl of pasta and a glass of wine consumed somewhere other than Babyville. None of which would matter a jot, of course, had Cold Feet not been feted for reflecting the lives of its target audience.|$|E
5|$|Prompt Payment and Stealing a Ride are two 1911 American silent short comedy films {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. Prompt Payment focuses on a lawyer who evades his creditors, dons a disguise and plays against them {{in a game of}} poker. After winning a large sum of money from them, he excuses himself and returns to pay them with their own money. Stealing a Ride is listed as a comedy, but has a clear dramatic element. Susie and Johnnie are out sledding when Susie's parents are about <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> a sleigh drive. The children ask to come along, but are refused. The children hitch their sleds {{to the back of the}} sleigh and follow along, only to fall off and get lost in the woods. The parents later track them down and bring them home. Both films were released together on a single reel on January 27, 1911 and were met with praise by critics. Both films are presumed lost.|$|E

Levene walks, defeated, into Williamson's office. Roma then leaves the office <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> lunch, while Aaronow returns back to his desk to make his sales calls as usual.|$|E

They run afoul of a con artist instead; Henry, correctly suspecting this man is up to no good, proclaims his own intention {{to break into the}} music business. When the con man repeats the same words to Henry that he said to the music teacher, he is exposed as a fraud; the teacher thanks Henry by giving Punky several free lessons.|$|E

In an interview with the Daily Record, she explained, [...] "I'm not a big fan of [...] but I got the line about things getting strange for Mulder and Scully from watching the odd episode". After questioning, she later said that she would [...] "prefer <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> {{a night on the town}} with Gazza and Chris Evans than meet [...] stars Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny". Matthews also related that [...] "I'm sure loads of people bought the record by mistake, but who cares? They should be flattered we wrote a song about [...] anyway".|$|E

500|$|In August 2014, it was {{confirmed}} that producers had planned a romance storyline for Mark and his housemate Paige Smith (Olympia Valance). After growing closer, they realised {{that they had}} a deeper connection than friendship. They later agreed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> dinner, but neither of them called it a date. Mark struggled with the idea of moving on from Kate, and even though he knew it was a date, he had not admitted it out loud. Mark ignored Paige afterwards, causing her to confront him as a storm hit Erinsborough. Brennan and Paige then consummated their relationship. Their first official date ended abruptly when Paige turned up wearing an old dress of Kate's she found in a charity shop. Brennan reacted angrily and shouted at Paige to leave the bar. He later realised that he had been too harsh, but just as he decided to give their relationship another go, he saw her kissing another man. McGregor commented [...] "He thinks he's blown his chances with her – but he's also wondering if this is what he really wants." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} island, Kate is famous {{as one of}} the Oceanic Six. [...] She is tried for her {{numerous}} crimes committed before the crash and pleads not guilty. [...] Because Kate is opposed to bringing her son into the trial, Jack is called in as a character witness. [...] He lies in his testimony, saying that Flight 815 crashed in the water, eight survived the crash, but two have since died and Kate was primarily responsible for the Oceanic Six's survival. [...] Kate speaks with her mother Diane Janssen (Beth Broderick) {{for the first time in}} four years. [...] Diane is no longer angry at Kate because her perspective changed when she thought that Kate had died in the plane crash. [...] When Diane, the prosecution's star witness, no longer wants to testify against her daughter, the District Attorney makes a plea deal: Kate gets ten years probation, but must stay in the state of California. [...] Jack meets Kate in the parking garage. He admits that he still loves her (in contrast to his false testimony under oath on her behalf) and asks <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> coffee with her. [...] Kate responds that they cannot go out until he is willing to visit her baby. [...] It is then revealed that Kate is raising Claire Littleton's (Emilie de Ravin) son Aaron (William Blanchette) as her own.|$|E

The roommate went too but pressed a doorbell by accident while looking for the light switch {{at the bottom of}} the stairs; this appeared to make Duggan panic and he ran off. The roommate said he ran after him briefly before going back to the apartment.|$|E

The death-toll would rise to 28 by the end of their incarceration, and the dead were buried in the nearby churchyard of St John sub Castro.|$|E
2500|$|Former numerary María del Carmen Tapia (born 1925), {{who worked}} with Escrivá for 18 years inside the organization, seven as his {{secretary}}, wrote in her book, Beyond the Threshold: A Life in Opus Dei, that Escrivá often became angry, and that as secretary in charge of recording his words and actions, she {{was not allowed to}} record anything negative that she witnessed. She claims she was subjected to abusive words from Escrivá, who called her filthy names, and then screamed during this meeting with both men and women present, upbraiding a member who helped Tapia send letters. She was kept prisoner in the headquarters of Opus Dei in Rome from November 1965 until March 1966. [...] "I was held completely deprived of any outside contact with the absolute prohibition <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> any reason or receive or make telephone calls or to write or receive letters. Nor could I go out for the so-called weekly walk or the monthly excursion. I was a prisoner." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{agitation}} {{against the}} goldfields licences (which were 30 shillings each) began at Bendigo in 1853, and was quickly taken up at Ballarat, and a Reform League was formed amongst the diggers {{on the various}} goldfields for the redress of grievances. In October 1854, the Government ordered the police <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> hunting <b>for</b> unlicensed diggers two times a week.|$|R

[...] On August 21, 2012, PortMiami and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers signed the Partnership Agreement (PPA) construction agreement that will allow the Deep Dredge project <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> <b>for</b> bid. [...] The Deep Dredge will deepen the Port's existing channels to minus 50/52 feet to prepare for the Panama Canal expansion, now scheduled for completion in early 2015. [...] PortMiami's deeper channel will provide ships with an economically efficient, reliable and safe navigational route into the Port. PortMiami will be the only U.S. Port south of Norfolk, Virginia to be at the minus 50 foot depth in sync {{with the opening of the}} expanded Canal. Deep Dredge is expected to create more than 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs in Florida and allow the Port to meet its goal to double its cargo traffic over the next decade.|$|E

When he came back to the dressing room at the end of day two, we could see the spots and bruises on his body [...] I remember when I walked in [...] he didn't say anything to me, but then he didn't need to.
