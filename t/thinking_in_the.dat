5|$|Advances in {{microscopy}} {{also had}} a profound impact on biological <b>thinking.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> early 19th century, a number of biologists pointed to the central importance of the cell. In 1838 and 1839, Schleiden and Schwann began promoting the ideas that (1) the basic unit of organisms is the cell and (2) that individual cells have all the characteristics of life, though they opposed the idea that (3) all cells come from the division of other cells. Thanks to the work of Robert Remak and Rudolf Virchow, however, by the 1860s most biologists accepted all three tenets of what came to be known as cell theory.|$|E

5|$|Fort Glanville Conservation Park {{is one of}} South Australia's most {{important}} heritage sites. It is the premier site in the state, and possibly Australia, for showcasing colonial era defences and fortifications. The fort is listed on both the South Australian Heritage Register and the National Trust's classified list. It is considered significant, in national historical military terms, for its association with Jervois and Scratchley; both leading British defence experts who influenced Australian defence <b>thinking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 19th century. The fort was very well constructed with high quality materials; facts that have been noted as contributing to its preservation. The fort is largely intact and in original condition and is, along with Bluff Battery in Hobart, the best preserved Jervois-Scratchley designed fort in Australia. It is the only Australian colonial fort to still have all of its original armament, and the only to have a regular living history program. Its companion Fort Largs does survive but in greatly modified condition, converted for use as the South Australia Police academy. The fort retains its original armament; armament that is both rare in Australia and worldwide.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} a phenomenographic {{theoretical}} perspective {{is taken as}} departure for research on manifested critical <b>thinking</b> <b>in</b> civics among Swedish ninth-grade compulsory school students. According to the phenomenographic perspective students’ manifestations of critical thinking {{are linked to the}} way of experiencing the phenomena inducing a manifestation of critical thinking. Thus differences between students’ manifestations of critical thinking are linked to differences in the way of experiencing the phenomena inducing a manifestation of critical <b>thinking.</b> <b>The</b> empirical investigation <b>in</b> this study revolves around how 19 ninth-grade students experience four different tasks designed to induce manifestations of critical <b>thinking.</b> <b>In</b> broad terms <b>the</b> main aim of the study is to describe the students’ different ways of experiencing each specific task and furthermore, to link each specific way of experiencing a specific task to a specific type of manifested critical <b>thinking</b> <b>in</b> relation to that task. A more overarching aim is to offer and test the phenomenographic theoretical perspective as a way of conducting research on manifested critical thinking. The empirical results show how the way of experiencing a specific task plays a decisive roll for the type of manifested critical <b>thinking,</b> made possible <b>in</b> relation to <b>the</b> specific task. A more complex way of experiencing the task can be linked to a more complex manifestation of critical <b>thinking</b> <b>in</b> relation to <b>the</b> task.

25|$|The {{discipline}} of ecology typically traces its origin to {{the synthesis of}} Darwinian evolution and Humboldtian biogeography, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Equally important {{in the rise of}} ecology, however, were microbiology and soil science—particularly the cycle of life concept, prominent in the work Louis Pasteur and Ferdinand Cohn. The word ecology was coined by Ernst Haeckel, whose particularly holistic view of nature in general (and Darwin's theory in particular) was important in the spread of ecological <b>thinking.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1930s, Arthur Tansley and others began developing the field of ecosystem ecology, which combined experimental soil science with physiological concepts of energy and the techniques of field biology. The history of ecology in the 20th century is closely tied to that of environmentalism; the Gaia hypothesis, first formulated in the 1960s, and spreading in the 1970s, and more recently the scientific-religious movement of Deep Ecology have brought the two closer together.|$|E
25|$|However, Joule's {{interest}} {{diverted from}} the narrow financial question {{to that of}} how much work could be extracted from a given source, leading him to speculate about the convertibility of energy. In 1843 he published results of experiments showing that the heating effect he had quantified in 1841 was due to generation of heat in the conductor and not its transfer from {{another part of the}} equipment. This was a direct challenge to the caloric theory which held that heat could neither be created or destroyed. Caloric theory had dominated <b>thinking</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> science of heat since introduced by Antoine Lavoisier in 1783. Lavoisier's prestige and the practical success of Sadi Carnot's caloric theory of the heat engine since 1824 ensured that the young Joule, working outside either academia or the engineering profession, had a difficult road ahead. Supporters of the caloric theory readily pointed to the symmetry of the Peltier–Seebeck effect to claim that heat and current were convertible in an, at least approximately, reversible process.|$|E
25|$|The Manstein Plan {{is often}} seen as either the result of or {{the cause of a}} mid-20th century Revolution in {{military}} affairs.

If true, an explicit Blitzkrieg doctrine would have been established by 1939 and been the basis of the plan for the Invasion of Poland; the Manstein Plan would have been its most spectacular implementation. The doctrine would have been reflected in the organisation and equipment of the army and the Luftwaffe and would have been radically different from those of France, Britain and the Soviet Union, except for the contributions of individuals like Mikhail Tukhachevsky, Charles de Gaulle, Fuller and Liddell Hart. That the earliest plans by Halder or Manstein and the final plan by Halder did not conform to this doctrine is an anomaly, to be explained by circumstances.|$|E
