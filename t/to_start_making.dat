25|$|Fogerty {{traveled}} to Mississippi in 1990 for inspiration and visited the gravesite of blues legend Robert Johnson. According to him, while there {{he had the}} realization that Robert Johnson was the true spiritual owner of his own songs, no matter what businessman owned the rights to them, and thus Fogerty decided <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>making</b> a new album and to perform his old Creedence material regularly in concert. It was at this time visiting the Mt. Zion Missionary Baptist Church cemetery that Fogerty met Skip Henderson, a New Jersey vintage guitar dealer who had formed a nonprofit corporation The Mt. Zion Memorial Fund to honor Johnson with a memorial marker. Fogerty subsequently funded headstones for Charlie Patton, James Son Thomas, Mississippi Joe Callicott, Eugene Powell, Lonnie Pitchford and helped with financial arrangements for numerous others.|$|E
25|$|Heraclitus {{was born}} to an aristocratic family in Ephesus, in the Persian Empire, {{in what is now}} called present-day Efes, Turkey. His father was named either Blosôn or Herakôn. Diogenes says that he abdicated the kingship (basileia) in favor of his brother and Strabo {{confirms}} that there was a ruling family in Ephesus descended from the Ionian founder, Androclus, which still kept the title and could sit in the chief seat at the games, as well as a few other privileges. How much power the king had is another question. Ephesus {{had been part of the}} Persian Empire since 547 and was ruled by a satrap, a more distant figure, as the Great King allowed the Ionians considerable autonomy. Diogenes says that Heraclitus used to play knucklebones with the youths in the temple of Artemis and when asked <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>making</b> laws he refused saying that the constitution (politeia) was ponêra, which can mean either that it was fundamentally wrong or that he considered it toilsome. Two extant letters between Heraclitus and Darius I, quoted by Diogenes, are undoubtedly later forgeries.|$|E

25|$|Countries where {{fixed rate}} loans are the {{common form of}} loan for a house {{purchase}} usually {{need to have a}} specific legal framework in place to make this possible. For example, in Germany and Austria the popular Bausparkassen, a type of mutual building societies, offer long-term fixed rate loans. They are legally separate from banks and require borrowers to save up a considerable amount, at a rather low fixed interest rate, before they get their loan; this is done by requiring the future borrower to begin paying in his fixed monthly payments well before actually getting the loan. It is generally not possible to pay this in as a lump sum and get the loan right away; {{it has to be done}} in monthly installments of the same size as what will be paid during the payback phase of the mortgage. Depending on whether there are enough savers in the system at any given time, payout of a loan may be delayed for some time even when the savings quota has already been met by the would-be borrower. The advantage for the borrower is that the monthly payment is guaranteed never to be increased, and the lifetime of the loan is also fixed in advance. The disadvantage is that this model, in which you have <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>making</b> payments several years before actually getting the loan, is mostly aimed at once-in-a-lifetime home buyers who are able to plan ahead for a long time. That has become a problem with the generally higher mobility that is demanded of workers nowadays.|$|E

500|$|When {{he started}} classes with this [...] "homemade" [...] knife, his {{instructors}} and fellow students {{were impressed with}} his handiwork {{and asked him to}} make knives for them. Emerson did so and sold these early butterfly knives for just the cost of materials, but he soon raised the price to $50 each, as demand for his knives increased. Emerson went on to make fixed-blade knives on a part-time basis, but upon seeing a Michael Walker handmade folding knife at a gun show, he was so impressed by the quality and design that he decided {{he was going to make}} folding pocketknives from that point on. Emerson contacted Walker and obtained his permission to use the Walker Linerlock mechanism on his own knives. [...] According to a 1990 article by Paul Basch, Emerson said of Walker, [...] "Here was a guy who put everything I was looking for into a knife. It was then I decided <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>making</b> knives seriously and locking liners in particular".|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} two months of 1986, Megadeth {{commenced}} a brief tour of the East Coast of the United States. At the shows, which were practically a continuation of the Killing for a Living tour, the band performed a number of songs from its upcoming album. Following the conclusion of the tour, the band intended <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>making</b> the record at the Music Grinder studio on Melrose Avenue in Hollywood. Mustaine lifted the title from an article in Reader's Digest, which was titled [...] "Peace Would Sell But No One Would Buy It". Their label at the time, Combat Records, provided a recording budget of $25,000, which allowed the band to hire a freelance producer, Randy Burns. The recording of the album was very difficult for the band, because Mustaine and Ellefson were homeless at the time. Furthermore, guitarist Chris Poland and drummer Gar Samuelson would not show up for hours because of their heroin addiction. Shortly after the band finished the final recordings of the album for Combat, they were approached by Tim Carr, an A representative of Capitol Records. After securing a contract with the group, Capitol hired producer Paul Lani to remix the original mixes done by Randy Burns, the previous producer.|$|E
500|$|Some reviews {{were more}} positive. Welch D. Everman, author of Cult Science Fiction Films, {{compared}} {{the relationship between}} West and Nelson to that of Victor Frankenstein and his monster in Mary Shelly's novel Frankenstein (1818). Everman wrote, [...] "This {{is the kind of}} movie we've come to expect from AIP — cheaply made, nasty, and lots of fun". John W. Bowen of the Belleville Intelligencer said he enjoyed the [...] "camp" [...] style of the film, adding, [...] "It's both inexplicable and sad this brain-damaged yet fiercely determined little drive-in bottom feeder never garnered more than a tiny cult following over the years". A 1978 critique in The Review of the News said, [...] "Films like The Incredible Melting Man are not made to be good; they are made to be scary. For anyone looking to raise goosebumps on their flesh, this one is sufficient to give you your money's worth". Matt Maiellaro, co-creator of the Cartoon Network series Aqua Teen Hunger Force, said the film inspired him <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>making</b> films himself, adding, [...] "When I was eight, I watched The Incredible Melting Man and knew that horror movies were going to be big religion in my life". Z movie director Tim Ritter said he was partially inspired to enter show business by watching a trailer for The Incredible Melting Man at age 9. Ritter said, [...] "I was too young to see the movie, but the trailer really got into my imagination".|$|E

Roach later helped Moonves make peace with Pacquiao promoter Bob Arum. Moonves then brought the warring elements from both boxers' camps together and, with Salvador's help, even arranged meetings at his home. After difficult negotiations, {{it was not long}} after that both camps agreed to fight on the night of May 2, 2015.

2500|$|Prior {{to recent}} history most {{postgraduate}} {{education in the}} United States was accomplished using the mentor system. A physician would finish a rotating internship and move to some town and be taught by the local physicians the skills needed for that particular town. This allowed each community's needs to be met by {{the teaching of the}} new general practitioner the skills needed in that community. This also allowed the new physician <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>making</b> a living and raising a family, etc. General practitioners would be the surgeons, the obstetricians, and the internists for their given communities. Changes in demographics and the growing complexities of the developing bodies of knowledge made it necessary to produce more highly trained surgeons and other specialists. For many physicians it was a natural desire to want to be considered [...] "specialists". What was not anticipated by many physicians is that an option to be a generalist would be abolished.|$|E
