Medea's recent plotting with rebels against the King of Avalon will probably end this deal. [...] Though she and Charon {{do not seem to}} always get along, they care about each great deal; Charon comforted her when she failed an exam miserably, partly from the pressure of having a brilliant faerie like Charon as a brother and the Prime Minister as her father, while Medea becomes visibly upset when Charon mysteriously disappears and agrees to help Pain find her brother and investigate the King of Avalon.|$|E
