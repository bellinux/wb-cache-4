5|$|As a {{response}} to the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, Venizelos's power base was further strengthened, and on 8 October 1908 the Cretan Assembly passed a resolution in favor of union despite both the reservations of <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> government under Georgios Theotokis and the objections of the Great Powers. The muted reaction of <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> Government to the news from Crete led to an unsettled state of affairs on the mainland.|$|E
5|$|Local music {{institutions}} include <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> Symphony Orchestra, Athens Choral Society (founded in 1971), Athens Youth Symphony and <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> Folk Music and Dance Society. <b>The</b> <b>Athens</b> Symphony Orchestra {{was founded}} in 1978 as a firmly non-profit, strictly volunteer organization, conducted by Albert Ligotti of the University of Georgia. The first performance came in 1979; the Orchestra now has two regular performances, one {{in the summer and}} one in the winter, and has also done shows for young people, pops concerts and Christmas concerts. In 1996, <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> Symphony moved into its modern home, the Classic Center Theatre in downtown Athens.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> Olympics, four athletes (three {{men and one}} woman) participated {{across three}} sports in four {{distinct}} events. Swimmer Roshendra Vrolijk was Aruba's flag bearer at the ceremonies.|$|E

5|$|There {{had been}} a single {{medalist}} from the Netherlands AntillesJan Boersma, a sailor, won the silver medal in his event at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Up to and including <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> games, {{there have been no}} other medalists from the Dutch colonies. Three male athletes comprised the Dutch Antillean delegation at <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> OlympicsGeronimo Goeloe and Churandy Martina in track events, and Eddy Stibbe in equestrianism. Martina carried the flag of the Netherlands Antilles at the ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} two athletes, the Vanuatu Olympic team {{consisted}} of Chef De Mission Michel Mainguy, VASANOC President Joe Bomal Carlo, and VASANOC Secretary General, Seru Korikalo. Ancel Nalau, who represented Vanuatu at the 1992 Summer Olympics in the Men's 1500 meters, coached Kamut and Marae for <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> Games. Kamut was selected as flag bearer for the opening ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Community Trolls, who {{may have}} at times {{included}} additional band members, performed in public at least twice. By sometime in 1984, however, Sweet began distancing himself from <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> music scene, and in 1985 he got a record deal and moved to New York. While some people accused him of using his Athens music connections to get ahead and then desert the scene, R.E.M. did not hold any hard feelings towards him.|$|E
5|$|Folk {{artists and}} singer-songwriters have always flourished in <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> atmosphere, albeit, as mentioned, not as {{significantly}} as Pop and Rock. Some of Athens' most notable solo singer-songwriter performers are Vic Chesnutt, Nathan Sheppard, Corey Smith, John Berry, Patterson Hood, Ricky Fitzpatrick, along with younger, emerging musicians like Thayer Sarrano and T. Hardy Morris.|$|E
5|$|On 23 May 2006, two Greek F-16s intercepted a Turkish RF-4 {{reconnaissance}} aircraft and two F-16 escorts {{off the coast}} of the Greek island of Karpathos, within <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> FIR. A mock dogfight ensued between the two sides, resulting in a midair collision between a Turkish F-16 and a Greek F-16. The Turkish pilot ejected safely, but the Greek pilot died due to damage caused by the collision.|$|E
5|$|Ort's Oldies, a used {{record store}} on Jackson Street, and its proprietor, William Orten Carlton, {{commonly}} known as Ort, were among the institutional figures that made <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> music scene possible. Ort has an excellent memory for rock trivia, which served him well in running the store. Perhaps more importantly, his off-the-wall {{sense of humor and}} warmly iconoclastic personality (and his thrift-sale wardrobe) were regularly on display at parties, gigs and musical venues around town.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford was an {{accomplished}} public speakershe ofttimes {{dressed as a}} southern belle when oratingwho addressed {{a great number of}} local organizations, including the YMCA, the Ladies Memorial Association (for which she served as president), and <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC), and in November 1912 addressed the national assembly of the UDC as their historian general.|$|E
5|$|After the {{completion}} of his doctorate, Tsakalotos entered into an academic career. His first role was as a {{research associate at the}} University of Kent, from 1989 to 1990. From October 1990 to June 1993, he taught at the university as a lecturer. In 1993, Tsakalotos and his wife moved to Greece, and in October 1994 he began teaching at <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> University of Economics and Business. In September 2010, he became a full professor of economics at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, more commonly referred to simply as the University of Athens.|$|E
5|$|Aruba sent a {{delegation}} {{to compete at}} the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece from 13 to 29 August 2004. The delegation's participation in <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> Olympics marked Aruba's fifth appearance at the Summer Olympics since the Dutch colony's debut at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Four athletes (three men and one woman) competed across three sports (Pierre de Windt in track and field, Davy Bisslik and Roshendra Vrolijk in swimming, and Isnardo Faro weightlifting). None of the track or swimming athletes advanced past the first round in their events, and as of Athens, no Arubans had medaled in any events. Roshendra Vrolijk bore Aruba's flag at the ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Athens {{is home to}} {{the summer}} music festival Athfest, , <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> Popfest and the late spring Athens Human Rights Festival and North Georgia Folk Festival. The college radio station WUOG (90.5 FM), the {{low-power}} (100.7) FM WPPP-LP and the free weekly Flagpole are the city's most prominent modern music media. Athens has never produced a major local label like many similar indie rock towns; the most important label of the 1970s and 1980s was DB Records, based out of Atlanta, though jangle pop pioneers Kindercore Records and Wuxtry Records were also Athens-based.|$|E
5|$|Bradley Ally also {{returned}} {{to compete in}} the men's 400meters individual medley, an event in which he had participated while at <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> Olympics in 2004. He competed in the preliminary round on August 9, when he was placed in the second heat against seven other athletes. Ally finished the event in 4:14.01, placing third; Italy's Allesio Boggiatto placed ahead (4:10.68), while Israel's Gal Nevo placed behind (4:14.03). László Cseh of Hungary led the heat (4:09.26). 29 competitors participated in this round of the event. Ally placed tenth, and did not advance to the final round, which occurred later that day.|$|E
5|$|Danny McFarlane {{also participated}} in the men's 400meters hurdles race. At 36 years of age, McFarlane was born in Saint Mary Parish in Jamaica's {{northern}} regions. He previously participated in two other Olympic games and three events (The men's 400meters and men's 4 x 400meters relay in Sydney, and the men's 400meters hurdles in Athens), winning silver medals in the Sydney relay and <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> hurdles race. During the August 15 qualifications, McFarlane participated in the second heat against five other athletes. He placed second {{with a time of}} 48.86seconds, defeating South Africa's Alwyn Myburgh (48.92seconds) but placing behind the United States' Angelo Taylor (48.67seconds). Overall, McFarlane tied South Africa's van Zyl for third place out of the 25 finishing athletes. He advanced to the semifinals.|$|E
5|$|Mardrea Hyman also {{competed in}} the women's 3,000meters steeplechase on Jamaica's behalf. Born in Manchester Parish, Hyman was 27 {{at the time she}} {{participate}}d in the women's 1,500meters race at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. She did not participate at <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> games in 2004, but returned to the Olympics in Beijing at age 35, this time participating in the steeplechase event. She was placed in the second heat of the August 15 qualification round, which included 17 athletes. However, Hyman was the only athlete in her heat who did not finish the race.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey-born Dudley Dorival was {{the only}} male track athlete to {{participate}} on Haiti's behalf at the Beijing Olympics, where he participated in the men's 110meters hurdles. His appearance at Beijing marked his third appearance; he previously participated in the Sydney Olympics in 2000 and <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> Olympics in 2004, reaching the finals round and ranking seventh in the 110meters hurdles in Sydney. Dorival participated in the third heat of the August 17 qualification round, completing his event in 13.78seconds ahead of Pakistan's Abdul Rashid (14.52seconds) and behind Puerto Rico's Héctor Cotto (13.72seconds). The leaders of Dorival's heat were Colombia's Paulo Villar (13.37seconds) and Barbados' Ryan Brathwaite (13.38seconds). Overall, Dorival ranked 30th out of the 43 athletes {{who participated in the}} qualification round. Dorival advanced to quarterfinals.|$|E
5|$|On 3 September 1843, the {{infantry}} led by Colonel Dimitris Kallergis and the respected Revolutionary captain and former President of <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> City Council General Yiannis Makriyiannis assembled in Palace Square {{in front of}} the Palace in Athens. Eventually joined by much {{of the population of the}} small capital, the rebellion refused to disperse until the King agreed to grant a Constitution, which would require that there be Greeks in the Council, that he convene a permanent National Assembly and that Otto personally thank the leaders of the uprising.|$|E
5|$|Other notable {{examples}} include Kenyan runner Bernard Lagat, {{who became a}} United States citizen in May 2004. The Kenyan constitution requires that one renounce their Kenyan citizenship when they become a citizen of another nation. Lagat competed for Kenya in the 2004 Athens Olympics {{even though he had}} already become a United States citizen. According to Kenya, he was no longer a Kenyan citizen, jeopardising his silver medal. Lagat said he started the citizenship process in late 2003 and did not expect to become an American citizen until after <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> games.|$|E
5|$|Roshendra Vrolijk {{represented}} Aruba at <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> Olympics as {{a swimmer}} {{participating in the}} women's 50meters freestyle. Born in Aruba, Vrolijk was 15 {{years old when she}} participated in the 50meters freestyle at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, where she ranked 62nd in the qualification round. She returned to the Olympics as a 19-year-old. During the qualification round of the event, which took place on August 20, Vrolijk participated in the fourth heat against seven other athletes. She completed the event in 28.43seconds, placing third in the event between Moldova's Maria Tregubova (28.40seconds) and Zambia's Jakie Wellman (28.56seconds). Of the 73 finishing athletes, Vrolijk ranked 49th. She did not advance to later rounds.|$|E
5|$|The Black Cat {{opened in}} 1906, {{shortly after the}} 1906 San Francisco earthquake. In the early years, the bar was located in the {{basement}} of <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> Hotel at 56 Mason Street in San Francisco's Tenderloin neighborhood. This building still stands today and is now the Bristol Hotel. When entrepreneur Charles Ridley acquired the bar in 1911, he turned it into a showplace for vaudeville-style acts. Over the next several years, Ridley and the Black Cat came under increased police scrutiny as a possible center of prostitution. In 1921, the bar lost its dance permit and closed down.|$|E
5|$|The Netherlands Antilles competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004, sending track athletes Churandy Martina and Geronimo Goeloe and equestrian athlete Eddy Stibbe. The 2004 Games {{were the}} Netherlands Antilles' twelfth {{appearance}} in the Summer Olympics; they first competed at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland. Before the 2004 games, the Netherlands Antilles had won one medal, a silver in sailing at the 1988 Summer Olympics, by Jan Boersma. There were no Dutch Antillean medalists at <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> Olympics, although Martina advanced to the quarterfinal round in his event. The Dutch Antillean flagbearer at the ceremonies was Churandy Martina.|$|E
5|$|The {{band members}} {{eventually}} {{dropped out of}} school to focus on their developing group. They found a manager in Jefferson Holt, a record store clerk who was so impressed by an R.E.M. performance in his hometown of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, that he moved to Athens. R.E.M.'s success was almost immediate in Athens and surrounding areas; the band drew progressively larger crowds for shows, which caused some resentment in <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> music scene. Over the next year and a half, R.E.M. toured throughout the Southern United States. Touring was arduous because a touring circuit for alternative rock bands did not then exist. The group toured in an old blue van driven by Holt, and lived on a food allowance of $2 each per day.|$|E
5|$|The {{music of}} Athens, Georgia, {{includes}} {{a wide variety}} of popular music and was {{an important part of the}} early evolution of alternative rock and new wave. The city is well known as the home of chart-topping bands like R.E.M. and The B-52s, and several long-time indie /rock hip-hop groups. Athens hosts <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> Symphony Orchestra and other music institutions, as well as prominent local music media, such as the college radio station WUOG. Much of the modern Athens music scene relies on students from the large University of Georgia campus in the city. The University sponsors Western classical performances and groups specializing in other styles.|$|E
5|$|The participants' songs {{had to be}} {{submitted}} to ERT by January 25, 2008 {{in order to be}} accepted. On February 3, 2008, Kalomoira and Kostas Martakis' songs for the national final were leaked via the internet, three days before ERT set release date before a press conference on February 6, 2008. At the February 6 press conference at <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> Hilton Hotel, ERT officially revealed the songs to the media and public as well as more details about the national final. The national final would take place on February 27, 2008 at the Athinon Arena with the winner being chosen via 60% Televoting/SMS Messaging and 40% internal jury.|$|E
5|$|Two days later, Alexander's {{body was}} {{conveyed}} to Athens Cathedral, where it lay in state until his funeral on 29 October. Once again, {{the royal family}} were refused permission to return to Greece, and Queen Olga was the only member who attended. Foreign powers were represented by the Prince Regent of Serbia with his sister Princess Helen wife of John Constantinovich of Russia, the Crown Prince of Sweden with his uncle Prince Eugene, Duke of Nericia, and Rear-Admirals Sir George Hope of Britain and Dumesnil of France, as well as members of <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> diplomatic corps.|$|E
5|$|A {{final element}} in {{creating}} and sustaining <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> musical culture was the University of Georgia Lamar Dodd School of Art. The {{great majority of}} Athens' musicians and their fan base {{were associated with the}} University's liberal arts curriculum, and the School of Art, rather than the music department, was the area where the creative and musical alliances that later defined the scene began forming in the 1970s. Michael Stipe of R.E.M. was an art major (although he did not graduate), and the Art School incubated other major figures such as Curtis Crowe, founding member and drummer for Pylon. The cinematographer for the documentary film Athens GA: Inside/Out was Jim Herbert, an art school professor. Herbert went on to direct music videos for a number of Athens bands, including 14 for R.E.M.|$|E
5|$|After Zappas's death, and wholly {{due to the}} Greek {{government}} ignoring Zappas's {{instructions to}} refurbish the stadium in marble, {{it was necessary to}} refurbish the Panathenian stadium a second time, replacing wood for marble, in readiness for <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> 1896 Olympic Games. After a period of litigation over Zappas's bequests, his cousin Konstantinos Zappas continued and expanded his endowment of the Games and maintained efforts for the continuation of the Olympic concept. In 1870, the new stadium, with a spectator capacity of 30,000, was ready to host the second Olympiad. The Olympic Games of 1870, apart from being the first modern international Olympic Games to be hosted in a stadium, were better attended and hosted more events and athletes, and were much better organized in general. Additionally, the first modern Olympic building was built to support the contests (and hosted the fencing events of 1896), as well as an industrial exhibition that anti-athletic members of the Greek government had forced upon the concept of the Games. This building, located near the city's National Garden, was entirely funded by Zappas's legacy and was named Zappeion after him. The Zappeion officially opened on 20 October 1888.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> Olympics, Thorpe took a {{year away}} from swimming, {{scheduling}} a return for the 2006 Commonwealth Games. However, {{he was forced to}} withdraw due to illness. Subsequent training camps were interrupted, and he announced his retirement in November 2006, citing waning motivation. From early 2011, there was speculation about Thorpe's return to swimming, fuelled by people claiming to have seen him training. The speculations were substantiated when Thorpe spoke at a February 2011 press conference of his return to swimming after four years away, with the aim of competing in the 2012 London Olympic Games. Thorpe competed at Australia's Olympic Trials in 2012, but failed to make the team. It was subsequently announced that he was targeting qualification for the 2013 World Championships in Barcelona and later the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow but was forced to abandon his plans due to a shoulder injury. In 2014, he was presented with a Doctor of Letters from Macquarie University in recognition of his contribution for the sport, philanthropy and Indigenous rights.|$|E
5|$|After their marriage, Prince Andrew {{continued}} {{his career in}} the military and Princess Andrew became involved in charity work. In 1908, she visited Russia for the wedding of Grand Duchess Marie of Russia and Prince William of Sweden. While there, she talked with her aunt, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna, who was formulating plans for the foundation of a religious order of nurses. Princess Andrew attended the laying of the foundation stone for her aunt's new church. Later in the year, the Grand Duchess began giving away all her possessions in preparation for a more spiritual life. On their return to Greece, Prince and Princess Andrew found the political situation worsening, as <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> government had refused to support the Cretan parliament, which had called for the union of Crete (still nominally part of the Ottoman Empire) with the Greek mainland. A group of dissatisfied officers formed a Greek nationalist Military League that eventually led to Prince Andrew's resignation from the army and the rise to power of Eleftherios Venizelos.|$|E
5|$|Aruba is a {{small island}} colony of 100,000 people {{that is part of}} the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and has been under Dutch control since the 1630s. The island lies in the {{southern}} Caribbean Sea just to north of Venezuela, and is near to the Dutch colonies of Curaçao and Bonaire. The colony originally was part of an autonomous union with those two islands in what was known as the Netherlands Antilles, but Aruba seceded from that union in 1986. The Netherlands continues to regulate all its foreign affairs. While the first Dutch Antilean delegation to the Olympics was sent during the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, Finland, the first uniquely Aruban delegation participated two years after the island's secession from the Netherlands Antilles at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. Between then and the 2004 Athens Olympics, Aruba had sent a delegation to all five Summer Olympic games. The most substantial Aruban delegation was in 1988, when it included eight athletes. This delegation included more women and encompassed more sports than any Aruban delegation since then (including <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> Olympics).|$|E
5|$|Athens {{was chosen}} as the Greek capital for {{historical}} and sentimental reasons, not because it was a large city. At the time, it was a town consisting of only 400 houses {{at the foot of the}} Acropolis. A modern city plan was laid out, and public buildings erected. The finest legacy of this period are the buildings of the University of Athens (1837, under the name Othonian University), <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> Polytechnic University (1837, under the name Royal School of Arts), the National Gardens of Athens (1840), the National Library of Greece (1842), the Old Royal Palace (now the Greek Parliament Building, 1843), and the Old Parliament Building (1858). Schools and hospitals were established all over the (still small) Greek dominion, Due to the negative feelings of the Greek people toward non-Greek rule, historical attention to this aspect of his reign has been neglected.|$|E
5|$|Churandy Martina {{represented}} the Netherlands Antilles at <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> Olympics in the men's 100meters race. Born in Willemstad, {{the capital city}} of the island Curaçao, Martina was 20 years old upon his entrance to the 2004 Summer Olympics. He had not previously competed at any Olympic games. On August 21, Martina competed in the eighth heat, which included nine athletes. He finished the race in 10.23seconds, placing in third ahead of Germany's Alexander Kosenkow (10.28seconds) and behind Jamaica's Dwight Thomas (10.21seconds). The heat itself was led by Maurice Greene of the United States. The Dutch Antillean progressed to the next round. During the course of the quarterfinals, which took place on the same day, Martina competed in the first heat against seven other athletes. This time, he finished in seventh place with a time of 10.24seconds. Martina placed ahead of Brazil's André da Silva (10.34seconds) and behind Canada's Pierre Browne in a heat led by national-record-setting Portuguese runner Francis Obikwelu (9.93seconds) and season-best-setting British runner Mark Lewis-Francis (10.12seconds). Churandy Martina did not advance to the semifinal rounds which took place the next day.|$|E
5|$|Competing at {{her first}} Summer Olympics, Katura Marae was the {{youngest}} athlete in the 2004 Athens Games athletics and the youngest ever athlete to represent the nation aged 14 years and 261 days, the latter a record that still stands today. She qualified for <b>the</b> <b>Athens</b> Games after being granted a wildcard place, without competing in any notable sporting event. She competed on 20 August in the Women's 100 meters in Heat 1. She posted a time of 13.49 seconds, achieving a seasonal best time, but still finishing last of the 8 athletes that competed in the heat. Cambodia's Tit Linda Sou placed ahead of her (13.47 seconds) in a heat led by Jamaica's Aleen Bailey (11.20 seconds). Overall, Marae was 2.06 seconds behind the slowest athlete that progressed, therefore not advancing to the quarter-finals.|$|E
