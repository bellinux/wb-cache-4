5|$|Ruiz {{notes that}} writing {{also has the}} power to {{transform}} reality. It brings <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> back to the past, allowing <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> to comprehend myths or distorted stories told by historians. Ruiz contends that knowing the past is crucial to one's understanding of the present that takes us to postmodernism, and argues that The Feast of the Goat can thus be seen as a postmodern discourse that gives power to history recreation.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} {{to bring in}} and then kill a Shade {{at the end of}} the book was made when Paolini realized he needed a new ending for the book after it was split up. He was in need of plot points that were strong enough to keep <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> interested through the ending of the book. The point of view of Glaedr and Oromis' confrontation with Thorn and Murtagh was combined with the Shade battle to further keep <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> interested.|$|E

5000|$|The textual {{structure}} {{refers to}} <b>the</b> <b>reader’s</b> point-of-view as {{found within the}} text. This standpoint is multifaceted, because the narrator, the characters, the plot, and <b>the</b> fictitious <b>reader</b> all offer sides of it. [...] Further, <b>the</b> <b>reader’s</b> role as a textual structure {{is defined by the}} “vantage point by which he joins perspectives, and the meeting place they converge.” [...] All, as component parts, operate together to shape <b>the</b> <b>reader’s</b> role as found within the text.|$|R

5|$|Gilbert White's Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne (1789) holds {{a unique}} {{position}} in English literature as the solitary classic of natural history. It {{is not easy to}} give, in a few words, a reason for its remarkable success. It is, in fact, not so much a logically arranged and systematic book as an invaluable record of the life work of a simple and refined man who succeeded in picturing himself as well as what he saw. <b>The</b> <b>reader</b> is carried along by his interest in the results of far-sighted observation; but, more than this, <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> imbibes the spirit of the writer which pervades the whole book and endears it to like-minded naturalists as a valued companion.|$|E

5|$|Sex, Sin, and Blasphemy {{provides}} <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> with {{a history}} of censorship of artworks. The book argues that artists have been scapegoated by those advocating censorship, as a method of diverting debate away from the suppression of human rights. The author asserts that censorship of works deemed obscene {{has been used as a}} tactic throughout history to suppress women's rights. Heins describes for <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> the history of the 1873 Comstock laws. It's stated that,"such laws were put forth by United States Postal Inspection Service inspector Anthony Comstock, and after he helped influence passage of the legislation, they enabled the government to criminalize sending perceived immoral writings through the mail".|$|E

30|$|The {{provoked}} values {{establish the}} grounds for the writers to affiliate <b>the</b> putative <b>readers</b> with these implicit positions. The use of lexical metaphor in the unfolding text indicates that the writers intend to covertly convey some values to <b>the</b> <b>readers</b> by referring to some knowledge common to <b>the</b> <b>readers.</b> <b>The</b> presentation of lexical metaphor is an important signal of the affiliation process between the writers and <b>the</b> <b>readers.</b> Lexical metaphor is used for rhetorical effects and therefore serves as a bond of affiliation. Lexical metaphors {{play a significant role}} in constructing and maintaining the affiliative relationship between writers and <b>readers.</b> <b>The</b> expressions of lexical metaphors in this editorial are predominantly used to emphasize the negative features of the Labor Party and its members. Their function to provoke negative values of them is a powerful device to disaffiliate <b>the</b> <b>readers</b> from this party. They invite <b>the</b> putative <b>readers</b> to either confirm their negative opinions or change their positive opinions of the Labor Party.|$|R
