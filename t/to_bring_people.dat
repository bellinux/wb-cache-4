5|$|Most of Acapulco {{remained}} {{closed for}} at least a week after the hurricane. Initially, authorities around Acapulco gave preference to clean up tourist areas, which resulted in the scenic highway from the hotels to the airport being quickly fixed. Tourism greatly decreased following the hurricane, causing some hotels to charge 40percent less than normal in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>people</b> back. One airline offered two plane tickets for the price of one from Mexico City to Acapulco. Most hotels were almost completely back to normal around a month after the hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Significant {{logistical}} operations {{take place}} <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>people</b> into the festival by public transport each year. Additional festival trains are provided to Castle Cary railway station, mostly from London Paddington. The station {{operates as a}} mini hub with waiting shuttle buses transferring passengers from Castle Cary to the festival site as required. This is an intensive operation on the Wednesday and Thursday each year with local bus and coach operators providing these buses over the two days. Additional extra buses normally provided by Go South Coast run from Bristol to the festival. On the Monday, passengers are transferred back in just one day with additional buses provided to meet the increased requirement. National Express provide extra coaches direct to the festival site from major UK towns and much of this work is subcontracted to smaller coach operators to provide the capacity required.|$|E
5|$|Early in January 2003, Benfica {{announced}} {{the signing of}} Brazilian midfielder Geovanni, on a loan deal from Barcelona {{until the end of}} the season. On 11 January, the team played Vitória Guimarães away. The 1–1 draw after 90 minutes was a consequence of the constant interruptions for a large number of fouls signalled by the referee. In the stands, the problematic behaviour of the Benfica supporters group No Name Boys caused the governing body of the Portuguese league to punish both clubs by closing their stadiums for one game each. On the following Sunday, Benfica visited the Estádio dos Barreiros for a game against Marítimo, which Benfica won 2–1 after an individual effort from Nuno Gomes in the 74th minute. It was the first win there since 1994–95. After selecting the Estádio Municipal Dr. Alves Vieira in Torres Novas to replace Estádio da Luz, Benfica hosted Beira-Mar on 26 January, winning 1–0 with a goal from Geovanni. Three days later, the team played the second friendly of the month after a 1–1 draw against Ajax a week before. During the game, intended <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>people</b> to Da Luz, Benfica lost 0–1 to Barcelona.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary writers {{observed}} that the Greeks {{were among the most}} temperate of ancient peoples. This appears to result from their rules stressing moderate drinking, their praise of temperance, and their avoidance of excess in general. An exception to this ideal of moderation was the cult of Dionysus, in which intoxication was believed <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>people</b> closer to their deity.|$|E

25|$|Traditional French culture {{places a}} high {{priority}} on the enjoyment of food. French cuisine was codified in the 20th century by Georges Auguste Escoffier to become the modern version of haute cuisine. Escoffier's major work, however, left out much of the regional character {{to be found in}} the provinces of France. Gastro-tourism and the Guide Michelin helped <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>people</b> to the countryside during the 20th century and beyond, to sample this rich bourgeois and peasant cuisine of France. Basque cuisine has also been a great influence over the cuisine in the southwest of France.|$|E

This kind of treaty had been used {{elsewhere}} <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>people</b> into the Roman Empire to move along the roads or rivers and work alongside the army. Gildas called them Saxons, which was probably the common British term for the settlers. Interestingly Gildas' use of the word Patria, when used in relation to the Saxons and Picts, gave the impression that some Saxons could by then be regarded as native to Britannia.|$|E

Occupy the Hood seeks to represent the interests of oppressed people and <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>people</b> of color into the Occupy Movement. The movement has been especially active in its attempts to decolonize the Occupy Movement. Occupy the Hood was created by Malik Rhasaan, from Jamaica, Queens.

25|$|Requiring {{belief in}} any of these aspects of Christ's person and work for eternal life is {{regarded}} as theological legalism by the more recent Free Grace view of the Grace Evangelical Society. The more recent view seeks support mainly from passages in the Gospel of John (3:16; 5:24; 6:47; 11:25-27), which is considered to be the only evangelistic book of the Bible, explicitly stating that it was written <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>people</b> to belief in Jesus Christ for eternal life (20:30-31). The traditional view also seeks support from passages in the Gospel of John (1:29; 3:14-16; 6:51-54; 8:24; 19:30, 35) and other New Testament references to believing in Christ's work or the gospel (Acts 13:41; Rom. 1:16-17; 1 Cor. 1:17-21; 4:15; 15:1-11; Eph. 1:13; 2 Thess. 1:8-10).|$|E

In time, they would grow too emotional to perform their abilities, {{and they would be}} sacrificed as an Eternal Flower to keep a malevolent power called Yomi at bay. The story follows three different protagonists; Yuuri Kozukata, who has the ability <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>people</b> back from the shadow world into the real world: Ren Hojo, an author and friend of Yuuri who goes to the mountain to research his new book: and Miu Hinasaki, the daughter of recurring Fatal Frame protagonist Miku Hinasaki.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} {{negative}} capability {{can be seen}} at work in industrial innovation. In order to create an innovator's advantage and develop new forms of economic enterprise, the modern industrialist could not just become more efficient with surplus extraction based on pre-existing work roles, but rather needed to invent new styles of flexible labor, expertise, and capital management. The industrialist needed <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>people</b> together in new and innovative ways and redefine work roles and workplace organization. The modern factory had to at once stabilize its productive environment by inventing new restraints upon labor, such as length of the work day and division of tasks, {{but at the same time}} could not be too severe or risk being at a disadvantage to competitors, e.g. not being able to shift production tasks or capacity. Those industrialists and managers who were able to break old forms of organizational arrangements exercised negative capability.|$|E
