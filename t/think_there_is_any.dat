It is something very important, it is done very carefully and she has said we do not authorise, condone torture in any way, shape or form.|$|E
25|$|If {{you wish}} you may tell the police {{to be careful not}} to rile me. Of course, I am a {{reasonable}} spirit. I take no offense at the way they have conducted their investigations in the past. In fact, they have been so utterly stupid as to not only amuse me, but His Satanic Majesty, Francis Josef, etc. But tell them to beware. Let them not try to discover what I am, for it were better that they were never born than to incur the wrath of the Axeman. I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>any</b> need of such a warning, for I feel sure the police will always dodge me, as they have in the past. They are wise and know how to keep away from all harm.|$|E
500|$|Speaking in the House of Representatives in February 2010, Turnbull {{attacked}} Abbott's {{climate change}} policy and praised the government's ETS legislation. He argued that Abbott's subsidy-based policy {{would be a}} [...] "recipe for fiscal recklessness". Turnbull later announced he would leave Parliament {{at the end of}} his term, before changing his mind within weeks. He claimed that his change of mind was the result of his anger at the government's decision to delay its ETS legislation until 2013. He denied being interested in regaining the leadership of the Liberal Party, saying [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>any</b> likelihood of that I assure you". Turnbull subsequently gave qualified support to Abbott's climate change policy, arguing that while it was inferior to an ETS in principle, it was preferable to the government's approach of delaying action until 2013. While it was the third leadership spill motion in three years, the Liberal Party did not attempt another spill motion for six years after, until the February 2015 leadership spill motion which was defeated 61 votes to 39. In September 2015, Malcolm Turnbull called for another spill, directly challenging Tony Abbott in a rematch between the two, and winning the vote 54-44 to return to the position of leader of the Liberal Party, and as a result, displaced Abbott as Prime Minister of Australia.|$|E

500|$|Soon after, in May 1924, {{the club}} {{embarked}} {{on its first}} ever European tour, beginning with an ill-tempered match against Czechoslovakian side Sparta Prague. The match was an intensely physical encounter with Cardiff accusing their opposition of dirty tactics. As the teams left the pitch {{at the end of}} the first-half, a furious Keenor, upset at the nature of some tackles he had received, yelled at the Prague players [...] "If I get anymore kicks on the shin I shall be chopping someone off at the knee". In the second-half, Cardiff players found themselves being physically assaulted by members of the crowd, who aimed kicks and punches at the players, when they approached the sidelines to take throw-ins and corner-kicks, going on to lose the match 3–2. They later played matches against First Vienna in Austria and Borussia Dortmund and Hamburger SV in Germany. The following season, the side reached the final of the 1924–25 FA Cup where they suffered a 1–0 defeat to Sheffield United, who claimed their fifth FA Cup win, following a goal from Fred Tunstall. After the Final, Keenor stated: [...] "Just because we lost in our very first Cup Final, I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>any</b> cause to get down in the mouth. I can say here and now that one day soon our followers can be sure that Cardiff City will bring that cup to Wales." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{under new}} head coach Mike Sullivan the 28-year old turned his season around, outscoring all NHL players from December 12 {{through the end}} of the season. On February 2, Crosby scored three {{straight}} goals for his first natural hat trick in more than five years. Four days later, Crosby scored his 900th, 901st and 902nd career NHL points to fuel a 3-2 overtime comeback victory over the Florida Panthers. He tallied at least one point in 15 of Pittsburgh's 16 games in March, including six multi-point efforts, and was subsequently named the NHL's First Star of the Month. On April 2, Crosby recorded his 600th NHL assist as the Penguins clinched their playoff berth. Six days later he scored in overtime against Washington Capitals to secure home-ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs. Crosby finished the season with 36 goals and 85 points in 80 games, including a career high nine game-winning goals, and was voted team MVP for the sixth time in his career. His two-way game also received league-wide praise, with Scotty Bowman stating that Crosby would be a good candidate for the Frank J. Selke Trophy as the league's best defensive forward. Crosby's comeback also impressed Wayne Gretzky: [...] "He had a tough start, but the sign of an elite athlete is a guy that battles through it. He didn't point any fingers, he just battled through it, and I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>any</b> question the last 40 or so games, he made a case for the MVP. He was that good. He went to another level." [...] On May 7, Crosby was named a finalist for the Hart Memorial Trophy. He finished as the first runner-up with 800 points and 11 first-place votes.|$|E

CIA Director, former Congressman and White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta, a 1960 Santa Clara classmate of Locatelli's, stated after Father Locatelli's death that, [...] "What Paul told you was always the truth. He didn't play games. You knew that {{what he said was}} what he believed. I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>any</b> {{question}} that he (Father Locatelli) will go down {{as one of the greatest}} presidents in Santa Clara history." ...|$|E

2500|$|As {{an airline}} manager, he gained a {{reputation}} of union busting, stemming from his leadership during the 1983 bankruptcy of Continental that enabled the company to void its union contracts, and during the strike and bankruptcy of Eastern that eventually led to its permanent shutdown in 1991. Lorenzo’s history is contentious, both “despised by unions and admired by airline strategists.” In 1990, after Lorenzo liquidated his holdings after 18 years in the airline industry, Alfred E. Kahn, the “main architect of airline deregulation,” offered this perspective on Lorenzo’s leadership: “I don’t <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>any</b> question that he saved Continental, but his tactics obviously didn’t work {{when he took over}} Eastern.” ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1960s Schaeffer {{read the}} works of Reconstructionist theologian Rousas John Rushdoony with appreciation, and {{according}} to Barry Hankins, [...] "it is quite likely that Schaeffer's belief that the United States was founded on a Christian base came in part from Rushdoony." [...] Schaeffer later lost this fervor because Rushdoony was a postmillennialist (holding the doctrine that the kingdom of God will be built on earth before {{the second coming of}} Jesus) while Schaeffer was a premillennialist (holding that the kingdom of God will only be ushered in with the second coming). Further Schaeffer thought that Rushdoony's system would require a merger of church and state, which he opposed. He held that the principles, not the actual details, of Old Testament civil law were applicable under the New Covenant of Jesus. He wrote [...] "The moral law , of course, is constant, but the civil law only was operative for the Old Testament theocracy. I do not <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>any</b> indication of a theocracy in the New Testament until Christ returns as king." ...|$|E
