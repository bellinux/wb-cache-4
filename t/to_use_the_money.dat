His tenacity was well-paid {{with the news that}} López had died in battle on 1 March 1870, bringing the war to a close.

5|$|At the plantation, Northup meets Patsey, {{a favored}} slave who can pick over 500 pounds of cotton a day, twice the usual quota, whom Epps {{regularly}} rapes and abuses. Some time later, cotton worms destroy Epps's cotton. Unable {{to work his}} fields, Epps leases his slaves to a neighboring plantation for the season. While there, Northup gains the favor of the plantation's owner, Judge Turner, who allows him to play the fiddle at a neighbor's wedding anniversary celebration, and to keep his earnings. When Northup returns to Epps, he attempts <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to pay a white field hand and former overseer, Armsby, to mail {{a letter to his}} friends in New York State. Armsby agrees, and accepts Northup's saved money, but immediately betrays him to Epps. In {{the middle of the night}} Epps wakes Solomon and questions him menacingly about the letter. Northup is narrowly able to convince Epps that Armsby is lying and Epps relents.|$|E
5|$|In October 1899, Rhodes, aged 22, married Sarah Elizabeth Stancliffe, {{who lived}} in Kirkheaton and was two years his senior. They lived in a farmhouse, shared with other people, at Bog Hall near Kirkheaton. On 25 August 1902 his wife {{gave birth to a}} daughter, their only child. Rhodes found Yorkshire's {{dealings}} with money to be ungenerous; following his benefit in 1911 Yorkshire, as was their custom, paid only one-third of the money to Rhodes and kept back the rest to invest on his behalf, only paying out the interest. Rhodes considered this to be unfair; however, he was able <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to build a stone house at Marsh, Huddersfield, which his family moved into in the autumn of 1912.

[...] He gave no indication of how <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> which was being held in trust by several banks, would be used.

5|$|Novelist {{and social}} {{commentator}} Walter Besant proposed a 'Palace of Delight' with concert halls, reading rooms, picture galleries, an art school and various classes, social rooms and frequent fêtes and dances. This {{coincided with a}} project by the philanthropist businessman, Edmund Hay Currie <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> from the winding up of the 'Beaumont Trust', together with subscriptions to build a 'People's Palace' in the East End. Five acres of land were secured on the Mile End Road, and the Queen's Hall was opened by Queen Victoria on 14 May 1887. The complex was completed with a library, swimming pool, gymnasium and winter garden, by 1892, providing {{an eclectic mix of}} populist entertainment and education. A peak of 8000 'tickets' were sold for classes in 1892, and by 1900, a Bachelor of Science degree awarded by the University of London was introduced. In 1931, the building was destroyed by fire, but the Draper's Company, major donors to the original scheme, invested more to rebuild the technical college and create Queen Mary's College in December 1934. A new 'People's Palace' was constructed, in 1937, by the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney, in St Helen's Terrace. This finally closed in 1954.|$|E

On April 26, 1990, the United States Department of Transportation approved the sale of Eastern Airlines' Latin American routes to American Airlines for 349 million USD. Eastern had recently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and planned <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> from the route sale to repay creditors and regain its financial footing.

25|$|On April 14, 1949, {{the state}} {{announced}} that Dewey had authorized {{the purchase of}} the structure, the last remaining privately owned toll bridge in New York State.As part of the deal, the state had {{through the end of the}} fiscal year (April 1, 1950) <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to acquire the bridge, at a cost of $30,000 or less. On June 14, 1949, two months after the appropriation, the state extended the charter through January 1, 1950 to work with negotiation of the transactions. In the time span of more than a year after the appropriation, negotiations were made for a fair purchase price to acquire the structure, which came to an amount of $26,000 by September1950. As part of the purchase, the bridge would be made toll-free. However, the state was not able to acquire the structure until August 6, 1952, when the state officially took over, abandoning the toll. Albro, who was at a ceremony removing the sign denoting the toll, noted that there was multiple issues in the three-year span involving transfer of the bridge, such as titles of the approaches and miscellaneous technicalities.|$|E
25|$|On August 31, 1991, {{the beach}} was closed again due to the {{presence}} of medical waste, with over 500 items found including needles and medicine vials of the painkiller Nubain. The beach was closed for a single day. Due in part to the reoccurrence of waste on the beach, the park saw declining patronage that year. During that year, a $20 million rehabilitation of the bathhouse began, which included the removal of asbestos. The project, however, was not completed, and the bathhouse remained closed and decaying. In 1999, $450,000 from the federal government was earmarked for the rehabilitation of Riis Park, projected to be complete by 2004. By 2001, $4.1 million in additional funds were secured by then-Senators Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer and then Congressman Anthony Weiner, particularly targeted at the bathhouse. One of the early plans for the project was to construct a pool with the $4 million, as hinted in a press release from Senator Schumer, possibly located in the bathhouse. The National Park Service planned <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> for general renovations. After a preliminary study, the pool plan was cancelled as the pool would lead to a financial deficit. Through 2005, numerous improvements were performed on the bathhouse, with plans to repave the central courtyard. By July 2006, however, the repairs had not been finished.|$|E
25|$|On 7 February 1825, {{a second}} loan to Greece was {{floated in the}} City of London. Despite {{the fact that the}} Greek {{government}} had squandered the money from the first loan, the second loan was oversubscribed and raised some £1.1 million. Unlike the first loan, the second loan from the City was to be managed by a Board of Control in London, consisting of the banker Samson Ricardo, two MPs, Edward Ellice and Sir Francis Burdett and John Cam Hobhouse of the London Greek Committee, who were <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to buy warships and other supplies, which would then be handed over to the Greeks. After the Greek government had wasted most of the money from the first loan, the City did not trust them to spend the money from the second loan wisely. The Board of Control used the money to hire the naval hero, Lord Cochrane, to command the Greek Navy and to buy steamships. One of the British philhellenes, Frank Abney Hastings believed that the use of mechanised warships powered by steam and using red-hot shot would allow the Greeks to destroy the Ottoman navy, powered as it was by sail. Hastings persuaded the Board of Control to invest in the revolutionary technology of the steamship, making the first use of a mechanised warship in a war. The two loans from the City imposed a crippling burden on a poor nation like Greece, and only in 1878 was a deal struck between the British creditors and the Greek government to reduce the loans, now worth £10 million, with unpaid interest down to one and a half million pounds sterling, and even then it took the Greeks decades to pay off the loans.|$|E
