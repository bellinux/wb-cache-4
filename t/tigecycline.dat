25|$|<b>Tigecycline</b> is a {{tetracycline}} antibiotic, but is {{also more}} specifically classified as a glycylcycline antibiotic.|$|E
25|$|Other {{drugs for}} the {{treatment}} of CDI are under development and include rifalazil, <b>tigecycline,</b> ramoplanin, ridinilazole, and SQ641.|$|E
25|$|Moxifloxacin, cefepime, <b>tigecycline,</b> and {{ertapenem}} do {{not appear}} to be effective in vitro. Piperacillin-sulbactam, doripenem and biapenem appear to be effective in vitro, but no clinical experience exists on which to recommend their use.|$|E
25|$|The first {{member of}} the group to be {{discovered}} is chlortetracycline (Aureomycin) in the late 1940s by Benjamin Minge Duggar, a scientist employed by American Cyanamid - Lederle Laboratories, under the leadership of Yellapragada Subbarow, who derived the substance from a golden-colored, fungus-like, soil-dwelling bacterium named Streptomyces aureofaciens. Oxytetracycline (Terramycin) was discovered shortly afterwards by AC Finlay et al.; it came from a similar soil bacterium named Streptomyces rimosus. Robert Burns Woodward determined the structure of oxytetracycline, enabling Lloyd H. Conover to successfully produce tetracycline itself as a synthetic product. The development of many chemically altered antibiotics formed this group. In June 2005, <b>tigecycline,</b> the first member of a new subgroup of tetracyclines named glycylcyclines, was introduced to treat infections that are resistant to other antimicrobics including conventional tetracyclines. While <b>tigecycline</b> is the first tetracycline approved in over 20 years, other, newer versions of tetracyclines are currently in human clinical trials.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{widespread}} resistance to many common first-line antibiotics, carbapenems, polymyxins, {{and more recently}} <b>tigecycline</b> {{were considered to be}} the drugs of choice; however, resistance to these drugs has also been reported. Despite this, they are still being used in areas where resistance has not yet been reported. Use of β-lactamase inhibitors such as sulbactam has been advised in combination with antibiotics to enhance antimicrobial action even {{in the presence of a}} certain level of resistance. Combination therapy after rigorous antimicrobial susceptibility testing has been found to be the best course of action in the treatment of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa. Some next-generation antibiotics that are reported as being active against P. aeruginosa include doripenem, ceftobiprole, and ceftaroline. However, these require more clinical trials for standardization. Therefore, research for the discovery of new antibiotics and drugs against P. aeruginosa is very much needed.|$|E
50|$|Although <b>tigecycline</b> {{is the one}} of {{the first}} lines of defense against carbapenemase-producing isolates, {{negative}} clinical outcomes with <b>tigecycline</b> have occurred. Both urinary tract and primary blood infections can make <b>tigecycline</b> ineffective, because it has limited penetration and rapid tissue diffusion after being intravenously infused, respectively.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tigecycline</b> {{can also}} be used in {{vulnerable}} populations such as immunocompromised patients or patients with cancer. <b>Tigecycline</b> may also have potential for use in acute myeloid leukemia.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tigecycline,</b> {{a member}} of the glycylcyclines antibiotics, has proven to be an {{effective}} therapy against Enterobacteriaceae that typically display tetracycline resistance, because <b>tigecycline</b> has a higher binding affinity with ribosomal sites than tetracycline has. <b>Tigecycline</b> is capable of killing almost all of the ESBLs and multidrug-resistant (MDR) E. coli isolates and the large majority of ESBL and MDR isolates of Klebsiella species.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tigecycline</b> is used {{to treat}} {{different}} kinds of bacterial infections, including complicated skin and structure infections, complicated intra-abdominal infections and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. The spectrum of activity of <b>tigecycline</b> is discussed below.|$|E

50|$|FDA {{issued a}} black box warning in September 2010 for <b>tigecycline</b> {{regarding}} {{an increased risk}} of death compared to other appropriate treatment. As a result of increase in total death rate (cause is unknown) in individuals taking this drug, <b>tigecycline</b> is reserved for situations in which alternative treatment is not suitable.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tigecycline</b> {{generally}} has poor activity against most strains of Pseudomonas.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tigecycline</b> {{has been}} found to {{interact}} with medications, such as: ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Tigecycline</b> is broad-spectrum {{antibiotic}} {{that acts}} as a protein synthesis inhibitor. It exhibits bacteriostatic activity by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacteria and thereby blocking the interaction of aminoacyl-tRNA with the A site of the ribosome. In addition, <b>tigecycline</b> has demonstrated bactericidal activity against isolates of S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tigecycline</b> {{does not}} require dose changes in people with poor kidney {{function}} or having hemodialysis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tigecycline</b> is a {{tetracycline}} antibiotic, but is {{also more}} specifically classified as a glycylcycline antibiotic.|$|E
5000|$|Other {{drugs for}} the {{treatment}} of CDI are under development and include rifalazil, <b>tigecycline,</b> ramoplanin, ridinilazole, and SQ641.|$|E
5000|$|Tetracyclines and <b>Tigecycline</b> (a glycylcycline {{related to}} tetracyclines) block the A {{site on the}} ribosome, {{preventing}} the binding of aminoacyl tRNAs.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tigecycline</b> {{is given}} {{intravenously}} and has activity against {{a variety of}} Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial pathogens, {{many of which are}} resistant to existing antibiotics. <b>Tigecycline</b> successfully completed phase III trials in which it was at least equal to intravenous vancomycin and aztreonam to treat complicated skin and skin structure infections, and to intravenous imipenem and cilastatian to treat complicated intra-abdominal infections. <b>Tigecycline</b> is active against many Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes - including activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (with MIC values reported at 2 µg/mL) and multi-drug resistant strains of Acinetobacter baumannii. It has no activity against Pseudomonas spp. or Proteus spp. The drug is licensed for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections as well as intra-abdominal infections.|$|E

50|$|A 2008 {{review of}} 42 studies of in vitro {{susceptibility}} of bacteria to <b>tigecycline</b> showed that MDR K. pneumoniae and E. coli, {{including those that}} were carbapenem resistant, were susceptible more than 90% of the time. A limited number of patients have been treated with <b>tigecycline,</b> but the FDA has approved it in certain cases with synergies of other drugs. The limited number of patients indicates that more trials are needed to determine the overall clinical effectiveness.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tigecycline</b> {{showed an}} {{increased}} mortality in patients treated for hospital-acquired pneumonia, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia (a non-approved use), {{but also in}} patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections, complicated intra-abdominal infections and diabetic foot infection. Increased mortality was in comparison to other treatment of {{the same types of}} infections. The difference was not statistically significant for any type, but mortality was numerically greater for every infection type with <b>Tigecycline</b> treatment, and prompted a black box warning by the FDA.|$|E
50|$|As a {{tetracycline}} derivative, <b>tigecycline</b> exhibits similar {{side effects}} {{to the class}} of antibiotics. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms {{are the most common}} reported side effect.|$|E
50|$|The European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection {{recommends}} <b>tigecycline</b> as {{a potential}} salvage therapy for severe and/or complicated or refractory Clostridium difficile infection.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tigecycline</b> may be {{used for}} {{treatment}} of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia caused by; penicillin susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae that does not produce Beta-lactamase and Legionella pneumophila.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tigecycline</b> targets both Gram-positive and Gram-negative {{bacteria}} {{including a}} few key multi-drug resistant pathogens. The following represents MIC susceptibility data for a few medically significant bacterial pathogens.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tigecycline</b> {{does not}} require dose {{adjustment}} for people with mild to moderate liver problems. However, in people with severe liver problems dosing should be decreased and closely monitored.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tigecycline</b> is marketed by Pfizer {{under the}} brand name Tygacil. It was given a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{fast-track}} approval and was approved on June 17, 2005.|$|E
50|$|Common {{side effects}} of <b>tigecycline</b> include nausea and {{vomiting}}. Nausea (26%) and vomiting (18%) tend to be mild or moderate and usually occur {{during the first two}} days of therapy.|$|E
50|$|Precaution {{is needed}} when taken in {{individuals}} with tetracycline hypersensitivity, pregnant women, and children. It {{has been found}} to cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy and therefore is classified as pregnancy category D. In rats or rabbits, <b>tigecycline</b> crossed the placenta and was found in the fetal tissues, and is associated with slightly lower birth weights as well as slower bone ossification. Even though it was not considered teratogenic, <b>tigecycline</b> should be avoided unless benefits outweigh the risks. In addition, its use during childhood can cause yellow-grey-brown discoloration of the teeth and should not be used unless necessary.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tigecycline</b> {{can treat}} {{complicated}} skin and structure infections caused by; Escherichia coli, vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus anginosus grp., Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis.|$|E
50|$|Moxifloxacin, cefepime, <b>tigecycline,</b> and {{ertapenem}} do {{not appear}} to be effective in vitro. Piperacillin-sulbactam, doripenem and biapenem appear to be effective in vitro, but no clinical experience exists on which to recommend their use.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tigecycline</b> is metabolized through glucuronidation into glucuronid conjugates and N-acetyl-9-aminominocycline metabolite. Therefore, dose {{adjustments}} {{are needed}} for patients with severe hepatic impairment. More so, it is primarily eliminated unchanged in the feces and secondarily eliminated by the kidneys. No renal adjustments are necessary.|$|E
50|$|Glycylcyclines are a {{new class}} of {{antibiotics}} derived from tetracycline. These tetracycline analogues are specifically designed to overcome two common mechanisms of tetracycline resistance, namely resistance mediated by acquired efflux pumps and/or ribosomal protection. Presently, <b>tigecycline</b> is the only glycylcycline approved for antibiotic use.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tigecycline</b> is {{indicated}} {{for treatment of}} complicated intra-abdominal infections caused by; Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus anginosus grp., Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides vulgatus, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptostreptococcus micros.|$|E
5000|$|Warfarin: Since both <b>tigecycline</b> and {{warfarin}} bind to serum or plasma proteins, {{there is}} potential for protein-binding interactions, such that one drug {{will have more}} effect than the other. Although dose adjustment is not necessary, INR and prothrombin time should be monitored if given concurrently.|$|E
