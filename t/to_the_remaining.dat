5|$|After World War II and {{up until}} the late 1990s, the New York City Subway did not expand much. Only 28 {{stations}} opened in that time, compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> 393 stations, which opened from the 1880s to before World War II. As such, {{there have been many}} plans to expand the system during this time period.|$|E
5|$|Galeon {{continued}} {{after the}} fork, but lost its momentum due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> developers' failure {{to keep up}} with the new features and changes Mozilla introduced.

5|$|In about 65 billion years, it {{estimated}} that the Moon may end up colliding with the Earth, assuming they are not destroyed by the red giant Sun, due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> energy of the Earth–Moon system being sapped by the remnant Sun, causing the Moon to slowly move inwards toward the Earth.|$|E

In recognition of this, the order comprising the frigatebirds and Suloidea was renamed Suliformes in 2010.|$|E
5|$|A {{breakthrough}} came in 1948 when {{a research}} group headed by John Enders at the Children's Hospital Boston successfully cultivated the poliovirus in human {{tissue in the}} laboratory. This group had recently successfully grown mumps in cell culture. In March 1948 Thomas H. Weller was attempting to grow varicella virus in embryonic lung tissue. He had inoculated the planned number of tubes when he noticed {{that there were a}} few unused tubes. He retrieved a sample of mouse brain infected with polio virus and added it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> test tubes, on the off chance that the virus might grow. The varicella cultures failed to grow but the polio cultures were successful.|$|E
5|$|Archidermaptera is {{believed}} to be sister <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> earwig groups, the extinct Eodermaptera and the living suborder Neodermaptera (= former suborders Forficulina, Hemimerina, and Arixeniina). The extinct suborders have tarsi with five segments (unlike the three found in Neodermaptera) as well as unsegmented cerci. No fossil Hemimeridae and Arixeniidae are known. Species in Hemimeridae were at one time in their own order, Diploglassata, Dermodermaptera, or Hemimerina. Like most other epizoic species, there is no fossil record, but they are probably no older than late Tertiary.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{their losses}} the French {{survivors}} returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> guns, {{although most of}} their first broadside scattered into the sea, and {{at least some of}} their shot was misdirected towards the merchant ships. The French gunners aimed too high however, most of their shot tearing through the rigging of Sybille while the British broadsides slammed into the hull of Forte. This problem was partly attributed to the French gun quoins which had been replaned three days earlier, exacerbated by the lack of suitable gun crews which meant that many of the upperdeck guns were unmanned. The French gunners were also more used to firing warning shots at distant merchant ships and may not have realised that their guns needed to be depressed for combat at point blank range.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2011 general election, a Cabinet {{reshuffle}} {{took place}} effective 21 May 2011. Lim Hng Kiang and Lim Swee Say respectively retained their Trade and Industry and Prime Minister's Office portfolios, while other ministers were given new appointments <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> 11 ministries.

5|$|In 1963, the Washington State Legislature {{commissioned}} {{a new state}} highway numbering system to ease confusion over similarly-numbered routes. The new system debuted in 1964, assigning State Route522 (SR522) to the Seattle–Bothell–North Bend highway, and State Route202 (SR202) to a proposed branch of the Stevens Pass Highway between Monroe and Bothell. By 1970, SR522 {{was moved to the}} completed Bothell–Monroe highway, retaining the Seattle–Bothell portion, while SR202 was designated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> highway from Woodinville (east of Bothell) to North Bend.|$|E

5|$|In June 1966, the now-purged {{parliament}} passed 24 resolutions {{including the}} banning of Marxism-Leninism, ratifying the Supersemar, and stripping Sukarno of his title of President for Life. Against the wishes of Sukarno, the government ended Konfrontasi with Malaysia and rejoined the United Nations (Sukarno had removed Indonesia from the UN in the previous year). Suharto did not seek Sukarno's outright removal at this MPRS session due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> {{support for the president}} amongst elements of the armed forces.|$|E
5|$|In early November 2008, Summit {{announced}} that they had obtained the rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> books in Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series: New Moon, Eclipse, and Breaking Dawn.

Melissa Rosenberg had been working on adapting the novel prior to Twilights release and handed in the draft for New Moon during Twilights opening weekend in November 2008.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in 1999, Sharon Jansa {{and colleagues}} {{published}} a molecular phylogenetic {{study of the}} Nesomyinae, the native Malagasy rodents, using the mitochondrial gene cytochrome b. Their results suggested that the current definitions of Eliurus and Voalavo may not be correct, because they found that northern voalavo and Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat are {{more closely related to}} each other than <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> species of Eliurus. However, the DNA of Petter's tufted-tailed rat, a possible close relative of northern voalavo, could not be sampled, so Jansa and colleagues recommended further evaluation of the problem. According to a 2003 report, data from nuclear genes also support the relationship between northern voalavo and Grandidier's tufted-tailed rat, but Petter's tufted-tailed rat remains genetically unstudied and the taxonomic issue has not been resolved.|$|E

5|$|Molecular phylogenetic data helped clarify {{relationships}} within the genus Triturus. A 2011 phylogeny based on complete mitochondrial DNA resolved all divergences with high statistical support. The crested and the marbled newts are sister groups, {{and within the}} crested newts, the Balkan–Asian group with T. anatolicus, T. karelinii and T. ivanbureschi is sister <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> species, results consistent with other studies. The mitochondrial analysis also supports the northern (T. cristatus) and the Danube crested newt (T. dobrogicus), {{as well as the}} Italian (T. carnifex) and the Macedonian crested newt (T. macedonicus), respectively, as sister species, but analysis of nuclear DNA gave some conflicting results regarding those divergences.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{attack on}} Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and the {{subsequent}} United States declaration of war upon Italy rendered Segrè an enemy alien and cut him off from communication with his parents. Physicists began leaving the Radiation Laboratory to do war work, and Raymond T. Birge asked him to teach classes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> students. This provided a useful supplement to Segrè's income, and he established important friendships and professional associations {{with some of these}} students, who included Owen Chamberlain and Clyde Wiegand.|$|E
5|$|The Norman {{expansion}} into Wales slowed in the 12th century but remained an ongoing threat <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> native rulers. In response, the Welsh princes and lords {{began to build}} their own castles, frequently motte-and-bailey designs, usually in wood. There are indications that this may have begun from 1111 onwards under Prince Cadwgan ap Bleddyn, with the first documentary evidence of a native Welsh castle being at Cymmer in 1116. These timber castles, including Tomen y Rhodywdd, Tomen y Faerdre, Gaer Penrhôs, were of equivalent quality to the equivalent Norman fortifications in the area, and it can prove difficult to distinguish the builders of some sites from the archaeological evidence alone.|$|E

5|$|The {{base of the}} Conn Smythe Trophy {{has been}} {{expanded}} twice {{over the years to}} accommodate more winners. Although the 16 nameplates on the original base tier were filled up after , a new tier was not added until the 1983-84 season.

5|$|The cavalry {{continued}} with {{its plan to}} attack. Paxton sent the regiment's advance guard, led by Major Powell, down the mountain to scout the rebel camps in Sinking Creek Valley. Each man in the 2nd Loyal Virginia Cavalry's 22-man advance guard was armed with two six-shot revolvers and a saber. The advance guard discovered that the rebels in the first camp were focused on staying warm, and many did not have their one-shot muskets loaded. Powell and his advance guard {{decided to try to}} capture the camp by themselves, and were successful in persuading a 500-man rebel camp to surrender. Rebel weapons were destroyed, and over 100 prisoners on horses were brought up the mountain <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>remaining</b> portion of the regiment.
