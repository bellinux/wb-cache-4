5|$|At times Shelley {{had trouble}} finding {{sufficient}} research materials {{and had to}} make do with fewer resources <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have liked, particularly for the Spanish and Portuguese Lives. She wrote in a style that combined secondary sources, memoir, anecdote, and her own opinions. Her political views are most obvious in the Italian Lives, where she supports the Italian independence movement and promotes republicanism; in the French Lives she portrays women sympathetically, explaining their political and social restrictions and arguing that women can be productive members of society if given the proper educational and social opportunities.|$|E
25|$|Psychologists Jack Block and Jeanne Block {{evaluated}} Genie in February 1971 and put {{her language}} below the two-year-old level on the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale. During the next month her vocabulary acquisition began to accelerate at a progressively more rapid pace, with observers putting her active vocabulary at over 100 words. Doctors noted that she seemed to know far more words <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> spontaneously say, but {{could not be sure}} about the extent of either her receptive or expressive vocabulary because she was so responsive to nonverbal stimuli. After another month, Genie began spontaneously producing one-word utterances and began to understand increasingly complex sentences. Soon after she appeared to understand some basic elements of the give-and-take nature of conversation, and without prompting could provide non-imitative one-word responses to statements or questions.|$|E
25|$|After she {{remarried}} in America, Suyuan {{has high}} hopes for her new daughter June, but June constantly fails to meet her expectations out {{of a lack of}} interest. She performs badly during a piano recital at age nine (Melanie Chang), and when Suyuan pushes her to continue training to be a concert pianist, June refuses, saying that she wishes herself dead like Suyuan's other daughters, an action that offends Suyuan. When June grows into adulthood, at a dinner party a year before Suyuan's passing, Waverly, June's long-time rival whom she is freelancing for, turns down her business ideas, and Suyuan remarks that Waverly and June are not alike and that style is something one's born with and cannot be taught implying Waverly has style. June feels humiliated, believing her mother had betrayed her for being a failure in her eyes, and Lindo shows sympathy for June. The following day, June berates Suyuan for her remarks and admits she could never live up to her high expectations. June laments that Suyuan has always been disappointed with June because June dropped out of college, is not married, and has an unsuccessful career. However, Suyuan gives her a jade necklace and assures June that she is the one who has the unteachable style and that while Waverly was the best in competitions, June always had the best heart which made her mother prouder <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have been otherwise.|$|E

25|$|The Committee seeds the {{top players}} and pairs {{on the basis of}} their rankings, but it can change the {{seedings}} based on a player's previous grass court performance. Since 2002 a seeding committee has not been required for the Gentlemen's Singles following an agreement with the ATP. While the seeds are still the top 32 players according to rankings, the seeding order is determined using the formula: ATP Entry System Position points + 100% points earned for all grass court tournaments in the past 12 months + 75% points earned for the best grass court tournament in the 12 months before that. A majority of the entrants are unseeded. Only two unseeded players have won the Gentlemen's Singles: Boris Becker in 1985 and Goran Ivanišević in 2001. In 1985 there were only 16 seeds and Becker was ranked 20th; Ivanišević was ranked 125th when he won as a Wild Card entrant, although he had previously been a finalist three times, and been ranked no. 2 in the world; his low ranking was due to having been hampered by a persistent shoulder injury for three years, which had only just cleared up. In 1996, the title was won by Richard Krajicek, who was originally unseeded (ranked 17th, and only 16 players were seeded) but was promoted to a seeded position (still with the number 17) when Thomas Muster withdrew before the tournament. No unseeded player has captured the Ladies' Singles title; the lowest seeded female champion was Venus Williams, who won in 2007 as the 23rd seed; Williams was returning from an injury that had prevented her playing in previous tournaments, giving her a lower ranking <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> normally have had. Unseeded pairs have won the doubles titles on numerous occasions; the 2005 Gentlemen's Doubles champions were not only unseeded, but also (for the first time ever) qualifiers.|$|E
500|$|Byron had {{arranged}} for Allegra to be educated in the convent precisely because he, unlike his former lover Clairmont, thought favourably of the manners and attitudes of Italian women who had received convent educations. [...] He disapproved {{of what he called}} Clairmont's [...] "loose morals" [...] and [...] "Bedlam behavior" [...] and didn't want her to influence Allegra. He also believed that his daughter, given her illegitimacy, would have a far better chance of marrying well in Italy <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> in England. A Roman Catholic girl with a suitable dowry, raised in a convent, would have a decent chance of marrying into high Italian society. He wanted the child to become a Roman Catholic, which he viewed as the [...] "best religion." [...] "If Claire thinks that she shall ever interfere with the child's morals or education, she mistakes; she never shall," [...] wrote Byron in a letter to Richard Belgrave Hoppner in September 1820. [...] "The girl shall be a Christian and a married woman, if possible." [...] Her mother could see Allegra, he added, only with the [...] "proper restrictions." [...] Byron wrote to Hoppner in March 1821 that Allegra would receive better care in the convent <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> with him. His mistress, Teresa, Countess Guiccioli, had had a happy experience at the convent boarding school where she had lived from the age of five, and had persuaded Byron that a convent school would be the best place for Allegra. He also viewed the convent as the safest place for her with revolution brewing in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies.|$|E
500|$|When Theresa [...] "had {{her eye on}} Ste" [...] for a {{potential}} boyfriend, Jaci Stephen writing for the Daily Mail quipped [...] "Given his history of violence towards women, that might be realised more literally <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> like." [...] When he kissed Brendan, Stephen said Ste had {{joined the ranks of}} [...] "very confused young men" [...] that have featured in Hollyoaks. She added he had [...] "banged about wanting to be a good boyfriend and dad for aeons" [...] and being the victim of domestic violence was ironic for him. She later said the serial was brave for tackling gay domestic violence. She opined that Richardson gave an [...] "incredible performance" [...] and felt she was not alone in perceiving the storyline to be [...] "deeply disturbing" [...] and [...] "deeply moving". She later expressed her view that [...] "Ste hasn’t experienced much normality in his young life". She concluded that Ste never seemed to have a trouble free day. The Liverpool Daily Post said [...] "You know you're not flavour of the month when even Ste Hay looks down his nose at you." ...|$|E

500|$|Besides his bronchitis, Rutherford {{developed}} {{diabetes in}} later years. His wife monitored his sugar intake, though {{when they were}} apart Rutherford sometimes took less care <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have liked him to. In 1938, possibly {{as a result of}} diabetes, he suffered a stroke that left him paralyzed and mute. He learned to walk again {{and with the help of}} a grade one reader got his speech back. September 13, 1940, Mattie Rutherford died of cancer. Less than a year later, June 11, 1941, Rutherford suffered a fatal heart attack while in hospital for insulin treatment. He was 84 years old. Alexander Rutherford was buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Edmonton, alongside his family. [...] His name was attached to many institutions both during his life and after: Rutherford Elementary School in Edmonton was established in 1911 and the University of Alberta's Rutherford Library in 1951. In 1954, a mountain in Jasper National Park was named Mount Rutherford. [...] In 1980, the government of Alberta created the Alexander Rutherford Scholarship, which awards more than $20 million annually to high school students selected on the basis of a minimum of a 75% average. The top ten students receiving Alexander Rutherford scholarships are recognized as 'Rutherford Scholars', and are presented with an additional scholarship and plaque.|$|E
2500|$|Baret and Commerson {{joined the}} Bougainville {{expedition}} {{at the port}} of Rochefort in late December 1766. They were assigned to sail on the storeship, the Étoile. Because of the vast quantity of equipment Commerson was bringing on the voyage, the ship's captain, François Chesnard de la Giraudais, gave up his own large cabin on the ship to Commerson and his [...] "assistant". This gave Baret significantly more privacy <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have had otherwise on board the crowded ship. In particular, the captain's cabin gave Baret access to private toilet facilities so that she did not have to use the shared head like other members of the crew.|$|E
2500|$|The {{presumption}} {{does not}} create a Sixth Amendment violation {{because it does not}} require the sentencing judge to impose a sentence within the Guidelines range, even if it will ultimately have the [...] of encouraging judges to impose within-Guidelines sentences more frequently. [...] Somewhat counterintuively, because the Sixth Amendment violation occurs when a judge imposes a sentence higher <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> otherwise be able to based on [...] "jury-determined facts standing alone," [...] there is no Sixth Amendmdent violation because a presumption of reasonableness does not require a judge to impose a sentence above whatever would be the Guidelines range based solely on the jury's findings.|$|E

She said that {{although}} she quit high school after fourth year (eleventh grade), she graduated from the Academy [...] "Street" [...] with a Bachelor of Life and honors.

2500|$|In 1975, Harris {{appeared}} {{in one of}} her signature film roles in Robert Altman's masterpiece Nashville, playing [...] "Albuquerque", a ditzy, scantily clad country singing hopeful who may be far more opportunistic and calculating <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> first appear. [...] Accounts of the film's chaotic and inspired production, particularly in Jan Stuart's book The Nashville Chronicles: The Making of Robert Altman's Masterpiece, indicate a clash between actress and director. Harris earned a Golden Globe nomination (one of 11 for the film); as Oscar-nominated co-star Lily Tomlin put it, [...] "I was the hugest of Barbara Harris fan; I thought she was so stunning and original." [...] Although the two were set to reunite with Altman in a sequel, that film was never made.|$|E
2500|$|While {{horses in}} the wild mate and foal in mid to late spring, {{in the case of}} horses {{domestically}} bred for competitive purposes, especially horse racing, it is desirable that they be born as close to January 1 in the northern hemisphere or August 1 in the southern hemisphere as possible, so as to be at an advantage in size and maturity when competing against other {{horses in the}} same age group. When an early foal is desired, barn managers will put the mare [...] "under lights" [...] by keeping the barn lights on in the winter to simulate a longer day, thus bringing the mare into estrus sooner <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> in nature. [...] Mares signal estrus and ovulation by urination {{in the presence of a}} stallion, raising the tail and revealing the vulva. A stallion, approaching with a high head, will usually nicker, nip and nudge the mare, as well as sniff her urine to determine her readiness for mating.|$|E
2500|$|Defection by {{the first}} player is the unique subgame perfect {{equilibrium}} and required by any Nash equilibrium, it can be established by backward induction. [...] Suppose two players reach {{the final round of}} the game; the second player will do better by defecting and taking a slightly larger share of the pot. [...] Since we suppose the second player will defect, the first player does better by defecting in the second to last round, taking a slightly higher payoff <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have received by allowing the second player to defect in the last round. [...] But knowing this, the second player ought to defect in the third to last round, taking a slightly higher payoff than he would have received by allowing the first player to defect in the second to last round. [...] This reasoning proceeds backwards through the game tree until one concludes that the best action is for the first player to defect in the first round. [...] The same reasoning can apply to any node in the game tree.|$|E
60|$|Christie {{laughed at}} the adviser, but wisely took the advice, and, though she fretted in private, was cheerful and alert in public.

2500|$|As the Doctor accidentally did {{not return}} for her until twelve years later, Amy grew up a {{different}} person <b>than</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have. She had become [...] "cynical" [...] and [...] "distrustful" [...] as the Doctor {{did not return}} as he had promised and {{she was forced to}} believe he was just an imaginary friend, and had resorted to being [...] "tough". Moffat theorised that Amy would have taken her anger out on Rory and would have been [...] "mean" [...] about things such as Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy. The second episode, [...] "The Beast Below", was to introduce Amy into the role of the Doctor's companion and how much he needed one. Though Amy soon tries to seduce the Doctor, Moffat believed that it was consistent with the cynical character he had built up. It was also a reflection of how the two had just escaped from death and shared a hard time together, and Amy's tendency to do things [...] "in the heat of the moment". In [...] "Amy's Choice", meant to challenge the Doctor and Amy's relationship, Rory dies in an alternate universe that was a result of psychic pollen that had entered the TARDIS. This is when Amy truly realises her feelings for Rory. As a primary part of the series' story arc, Rory officially dies and is erased from history and Amy's memory. Though Rory later returns, he is an Auton duplicate who kills her, which reflected Moffat's belief that all good love stories end in tragedy. The end of [...] "The Big Bang", in which Amy stands up at her wedding and declares the Doctor is real, was the Doctor's success at restoring Amy to the spirit of the girl he first met.|$|E
