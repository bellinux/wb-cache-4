40|$|Advanced {{combustion}} {{techniques in}} aero engines require highly effective cooling schemes of combustor liners. One Parameter affecting <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> performance is <b>the</b> geometry of <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> holes themselves. So far, the freedom in <b>the</b> design of <b>cooling</b> holes was limited {{due to the}} manufacturing techniques. With emerging additive manufacturing methods, e. g. Direct Metal Laser Sintering, however, the geometry of <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> holes is virtually unlimited. Especially the entrance and the curvature of <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> holes determines <b>the</b> through-flow of the hole and consequently <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> performance of <b>the</b> ejected <b>cooling</b> film. In this study a set of combustor liner tiles with two innovative and four traditional cooling hole geometries will be analyzed and compared {{to each other in}} terms of <b>cooling</b> performance. <b>The</b> innovative geometries have bent cooling holes with a nearly horizontal outlet. All specimens have <b>the</b> same <b>cooling</b> hole pattern. <b>The</b> <b>cooling</b> performance is determined by comparing <b>the</b> total <b>cooling</b> effectiveness for a given pressure difference across the combustor liner tiles.

The first set of measurements is conducted in an atmospheric open-loop test rig at reduced temperatures but realistic density ratios between hot gas and coolant. The specimen with <b>the</b> best <b>cooling</b> performance has been selected for an investigation in a high pressure test rig at realistic combustor conditions (pressure, temperature) including fluctuations of <b>the</b> <b>cooling</b> air to simulate combustion instabilities. <b>The</b> <b>cooling</b> performance again is determined by <b>the</b> total <b>cooling</b> effectiveness for a given pressure difference across the combustor liner tiles...|$|R

It thus spans a wide range of climates, occurring in all but the semi-arid areas well inland.

5|$|Due to {{the warm}} waters of the Great Salt Lake, lake effect snowfalls are {{frequent}} phenomena of the surrounding area.

It is typically heaviest from eastern Tooele County east and north into central Davis County. It can deposit excessive snowfall amounts, generally with a narrow band of snow highly dependent on the direction the wind is blowing.|$|E

5|$|Ranging {{behavior}} can also exhibit seasonal variability. During the hot, wet season, females range widely, either {{alone or in}} groups of up to six individuals. In <b>the</b> <b>cool,</b> dry season, smaller core groups stabilize in order to occupy concentrated areas. Therefore, during seasons when fruit is abundant, subgroups are larger while scarcity is met with more solitary behavior. This suggests that although their feeding ecology is inflexible, being tied to widely distributed, patchy, and sometimes scarce fruit, ruffed lemurs instead adapt the social system in order to survive.|$|E

This behavior is not seen during the end of <b>the</b> <b>cool,</b> dry season or around gestation. The frequency of other affiliative behaviors can be affected by age.
