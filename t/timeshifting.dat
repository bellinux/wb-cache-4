25|$|CTV {{affiliate}} CHFD in Thunder Bay, Ontario {{left the}} network on February 12, 2010 after {{being unable to}} reach an agreement on new affiliation terms; CHFD instead became a full-time Global affiliate. CFTO was offered as part of the basic package to Thunder Bay cable subscribers {{for the duration of the}} 2010 Winter Olympics; the station had otherwise been available only on the digital cable <b>timeshifting</b> package, leaving CTV without a presence on basic cable in the market.|$|E
25|$|For <b>timeshifting</b> {{trade with}} Norway, Denmark exports at DKK 157/MWh and imports at DKK 212/MWh. The {{correlation}} is low between wind power in Norway and Denmark. Market price sometimes falls to near or below zero, particularly in high winds and low consumption. In 2014, there were 46 hours with negative prices, costing DKK 37.7 million. In 2015, negative prices occurred in 65 hours in West Denmark and 36 hours in East Denmark - less than 1% of the time. Danish prices are mainly negative when German prices {{are even more}} negative. The whole date of September 2 (2015) {{was the first time}} that no central power plants were running in West Denmark, and grid stability was maintained by compensators.|$|E
25|$|Annual {{wind power}} {{production}} is currently (2014) equal to about 39% of electricity consumed in Denmark. The proportion {{of this that}} is actually consumed in Denmark has been disputed, as the considerable hydropower resources of Norway (and to some extent, Sweden) is used as grid storage with low loss. Hydropower can rapidly reduce generation whenever wind farms are generating power, saving water for later, and can export electricity to Denmark when wind power output drops. Short term, Denmark imports electricity from Norway during daytime and exports in nighttime. Long term, Denmark imports electricity in summer and exports in winter. Wind is higher in autumn and winter, when consumption is also high. This service of <b>timeshifting</b> production and consumption is also found {{around the world in}} pumped-storage hydroelectricity balancing coal and nuclear plants.|$|E
50|$|In Australia, <b>timeshifted</b> Foxtel pay TV {{channels}} typically carry a {{time delay}} of two hours, making the <b>timeshift</b> channels run on local time in Western Australia when {{daylight saving time}} is not in effect.

50|$|In the United Kingdom, most <b>timeshift</b> {{channels}} have a {{time delay}} of one hour, {{and are thus}} described as a +1 channel - for instance, ITV2 has a <b>timeshift</b> channel known as ITV2 +1. More recently, some channels have launched <b>timeshift</b> channels with a delay of two hours - +2 channels. The most notable of these was FX, though the <b>timeshifted</b> channel was presented as simply FX +, rather than FX +2. The channel later changed to a one-hour <b>timeshift</b> and was later renamed FX +, but was renamed to Fox + on 11 January 2013.

5000|$|Designed by Bill Rose (lead designer), Matt Place, Mark Rosewater and Paul Sottosanti, and {{developed}} by Devin Low (lead developer), Zvi Mowshowitz, Brian Schneider, Henry Stern and Mike Turian, Planar Chaos was tasked with representing the {{present in a}} set focused on the cycle of time. [...] The design team considered {{a number of ways}} to represent an alternate present, including the introduction of purple as a new color. [...] Eventually, the team chose to represent alternate realities where elements of the color pie were shifted, placing spell types and abilities into unusual colors. These alternate realities were epitomized by the set's 45 [...] "color shifted" [...] cards. Unlike their predecessors in Time Spiral, these cards were direct reprints of previous cards, save for shifts in color, land or color references in card text, card name and creature type. <b>Timeshifted</b> cards in Planar Chaos appear in an altered version of the modern card frame with standard set symbols. (An example of this is the card , a black reprint of the white card [...] ). <b>Timeshifted</b> cards in Planar Chaos are also distributed differently. In each pack, three common cards are of the <b>Timeshifted</b> variety and an uncommon is replaced with either a <b>timeshifted</b> rare or uncommon. Foil cards, instead of replacing a card of the same rarity, replace a common card. As such, it is possible to receive a booster with up to three rare cards: one normal, one foil and one <b>timeshifted.</b> The uncommon <b>timeshifted</b> cards show up in a 3:1 ratio to the rare <b>timeshifted</b> cards, so the average out of 4 boosters is 3 uncommon and 1 rare <b>timeshifted</b> card.|$|R
