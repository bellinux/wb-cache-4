As a result, certain blades may experience forced response amplitudes and stresses that are substantially larger than those predicted by an analysis of the nominal (tuned) design.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{explores the}} {{properties}} of a precessing rotor or a coupled system of precessing <b>rotors</b> (<b>gyroscopes),</b> where a special chaotic behavior in the precession angle can be found if the change of rotor angular velocity is linearly coupled by (an) holonomy to the precession angular velocity and angle. The linear coupling provides for rolling cone paths and allows spinning up and controlling the rotor simply by forcing precession at special quantum magic precession angles. The geometric phase induced by the curved path of the rotor or external curvature {{and part of the}} coupling increases with precession angle. This leads to bifurcations in coupling strength resulting in chaotic precession. As an alternative to the SO(3) matrix or quaternion representation the treatment of the three coupled rotations is here based on Euler’s dynamical equations. First, the classical Magic Angle Precession (MAP) dynamics is realized by a geometric or mechanical condition (type I, transcendental solutions), where it can be experimentally demonstrated how MAP can “slave” angular degrees of freedom allowing the external control of high-frequent spin by slow oscillations. MAP is found in a commercial fitness device and is conceptually approached via Chua’s electric circuit. Second, the quantum-gravitational MAP (type II, rational solutions) with discrete precession angles is analyzed on a deeper level requiring intrinsic curvature/relativistic effects adjusting holonomy to quantum numbers. Third, a macroscopic network of MAP elements is presented as a discretetime recurrent neural network synchronizing to one common MAP I/II dynamics under special pairing and symmetry conditions (type III). In all three cases MAP can be treated as a time-discrete chaotic system with singularities given by the cosine map with several possible links to interesting applications on all scales...|$|R

40|$|A {{mathematical}} model is developed and utilized {{to demonstrate the}} enhanced aeroelastic stability and forced response behavior associated with aerodynamic detuning of a rotor operating in an incompressible flow field. The unsteady aerodynamic gust response and oscillating cascade aerodynamics are determined by developing a complete first order unsteady aerodynamic analysis. A locally analytical solution is developed in which the discrete algebraic equations which represent the flow field equations are obtained from analytical solutions in individual grid elements of a body fitted computational grid. Aerodynamic detuning is accomplished by means of alternate circumferential spacing, and also {{by the introduction of}} variable spacing splitters between each pair of full chord airfoils. An unsteady aerodynamic influence coefficient technique is then utilized, thereby enabling the torsion mode stability and forced response behavior of both conventional <b>tuned</b> <b>rotors</b> and aerodynamically detuned rotors to be determined. ^ The validity of the tuned cascade model and solution technique are demonstrated by considering the steady and unsteady aerodynamics of both theoretical and experimental cascade configurations. To verify the detuned cascade model and influence coefficient technique, predictions from this model are compared to the steady theoretical results and also the tuned cascade unsteady aerodynamic model predictions. The capabilities of this detuned cascade model are then demonstrated by predicting the flutter stability and forced response behavior of detuned rotor configurations. ^ Nonuniform circumferential airfoil spacing and alternate blade structural detuning are both shown to enhance stability. The greatest stability enhancement resulted from a combination of aerodynamic and structural detuning. Also, the unstable baseline configuration can be stabilized by the introduction of splitter blades. For the forced response behavior, both the alternate circumferential spaced detuning and the alternate blade structural detuning can be beneficial on the response amplitude of the airfoils. By including aspect ratio effects, the alternate splitter blade detuning results in significantly reduced amplitudes of response for most cases considered. In conclusion, this detuning analysis has demonstrated that both the aeroelastic stability and forced responsive behavior can be greatly enhanced by aerodynamic detuning. Therefore, aerodynamic detuning appears to be a viable passive control mechanism for aeroelastic problems of an incompressible cascade. ...|$|R
40|$|Two {{different}} approaches based on sequential experimental design concepts {{have been studied}} for helicopter <b>rotor</b> <b>tuning,</b> which {{is the process of}} adjusting the rotor blades so as to reduce the aircraft vibration and the spread of rotors. One uses an interval model adapted sequentially to improve the search for the blade adjustments. The other uses a probability model to search for the blade adjustments with the maximal probability of success. ^ In the first approach, an interval model is used to represent the range of effect of blade adjustments on helicopter vibration, so as to cope with the nonlinear and stochastic nature of aircraft vibration. The coefficients of the model are initially defined according to sensitivity coefficients between the blade adjustments and helicopter vibration, to include the expert knowledge of the process. The model coefficients are subsequently transformed into intervals and updated after each tuning iteration to improve the model 2 ̆ 7 s estimation accuracy. The search for the blade adjustments is performed according to this model by considering the vibration estimates of all of the flight regimes so as to provide a comprehensive solution for <b>rotor</b> <b>tuning.</b> ^ The second approach studied uses a probability model to maximize the likelihood of success of the selected blade adjustments. The underlying model in this approach consists of two segments: a deterministic segment to include a linear regression model representing the relationships between the blade adjustments and helicopter vibration, and a stochastic segment to comprise probability densities of the vibration components. The blade adjustments with the maximal probability of generating acceptable vibration are selected as recommended adjustments. ^ The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is evaluated in simulation based on a series of neural networks trained with actual vibration data. To incorporate the stochastic behavior of the helicopter vibration and better simulate the tuning process, the probability density function of the prediction error is used to simulate noise. Due to the stochastics of the helicopter vibration, the proposed approaches cannot be evaluated by deterministic measures. Therefore, several performance measures have been devised to represent the various aspects of helicopter <b>rotor</b> <b>tuning</b> as the evaluation criteria. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{investigates the}} forced response of mistuned rotor blades {{that can lead}} to excessive vibration, noise, and high cycle fatigue failure in a turbomachine. In particular, an embedded rotor in the Purdue Three-Stage Axial Compressor Research Facility is considered. The prediction of the rotor forced response contains three key elements: the prediction of forcing function, damping, and the effect of frequency mistuning. These computational results are compared with experimental aerodynamic and vibratory response measurements to understand the accuracy of each prediction. A state-of-the-art time-marching computational fluid dynamic (CFD) code is used to predict the rotor forcing function. A highly-efficient nonlinear frequency-domain Harmonic Balance CFD code is employed for the prediction of aerodynamic damping. These allow the compressor aerodynamics to be depicted and the <b>tuned</b> <b>rotor</b> response amplitude to be predicted. Frequency mistuning is considered by using two reduced-order models of different levels of fidelity, namely the Fundamental Mistuning Model (FMM) and the Component Mode Mistuning (CMM) methods. This allows a cost-effective method to be identified for mistuning analysis, especially for probabilistic mistuning analysis. The first topic of this work concerns the prediction of the forcing function of the embedded rotor due to the periodic passing of the neighboring stators that have the same vane counts. Superposition and decomposition methods are introduced under a linearity assumption, which states that the rotor forcing function comprises of two components that are induced by each neighboring stator, and that these components stay unchanged with only a phase shift with respect to a change in the stator-stator clocking position. It is found that this assumption captures the first-order linear relation, but neglects the secondary nonlinear effect which alters each stator-induced forcing functions with respect to a change in the clocking position. The second part of this work presents a comprehensive mistuned forced response prediction of the embedded rotor at a high-frequency (higher-order) mode. Three steady loading conditions are considered. The predicted aerodynamics are in good agreement with experimental measurements in terms of the compressor performance, rotor tip leakage flow, and circumferential distributions of the stator wake and potential fields. Mistuning analyses using FMM and CMM models show that the extremely low-cost FMM model produces very similar predictions to those of CMM. The predicted response is in good agreement with the measured response, especially after taking the uncertainty in the experimentally-determined frequency mistuning into consideration. Experimentally, the characteristics of the mistuned response change considerably with respect to loading. This is not very well predicted, and is attributed to un-identified and un-modeled effects. A significant amplification factor over 1. 5 is observed both experimentally and computationally for this higher-order mode. Dissertatio...|$|R

The authors suggest the method for estimation of rotor angle from the data of exciting currents in statorwindings using a feedforward neural network, with the regulator type on-line tuning method for half-step typedamping sequence. In this method, direct detection of the rotor angle can be omitted, and the advantage ofnon-sensor drive of a stepping motor is maintained. It is demonstrated experimentally that the exciting periodis <b>tuned</b> appropriately and <b>rotor</b> oscillation is suppressed by this method under the driving conditions withdifferent inertial loads which causes the variation of oscillatory characteristic...|$|R
