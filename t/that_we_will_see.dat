2500|$|The Dardenne {{brothers}} have a regular stable of collaborators (for {{all of their}} films the brothers share writing and directing credits), including cinematographer Alain Marcoen and editor Marie-Hélène Dozo. Jérémie Renier played Igor in La Promesse, Bruno in L’Enfant, Claudy in Le Silence de Lorna (Lorna's Silence) and Guy in Le gamin au vélo (The Kid with a Bike), while Olivier Gourmet, the main character of Le fils, has a brief cameo as a detective in L’Enfant. Like Rosettas Emilie Dequenne, Déborah François, the seventeen-year-old lead in L’Enfant, was appearing in her first film. Luc Dardenne has described their process of working with actors as follows: [...] "What {{we do with the}} actors is also very physical. The day filming begins we do not feel obliged to do things exactly the way they were rehearsed; we pretend that we are starting over from zero so that we can rediscover things that we did before. The instructions we give the actors are above all physical. We start working without the cameraman—just the actors and my brother and me. We walk them through the blocking, first one then the other, trying several different versions. They say but do not act their lines. We do not tell them what the tone of their lines should be; we just say <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> <b>see</b> once the camera is rolling. At this point there is no cameraman, no sound engineer, no lighting. Then we set up all the camera movements exactly and the rhythm of the shot, which is usually a long take. Doing it this way allows us the ability to modify the actors’ movements or any small details." ...|$|E

40|$|A {{primary goal}} of {{quantitative}} structure-activity relationships (QSARs) and quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPRs) is to predict chemical activities from chemical structure. Chemical structure can be quantified in many ways resulting in hundreds, if not thousands, of measurements for every chemical. Chemical activities measures how the chemical interacts with other chemicals, e. g. toxicity, biodegradability, boiling point, and vapor pressure. Typically there are more chemical structure measurements than chemicals being measured, the so-called large-p, small-n problem. Here we review some of the statistical procedures that have been commonly used to explore these problems {{in the past and}} provide several examples of their use.

30|$|Conclusions—for the GLOBAL scenario—are <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>will</b> {{certainly}} <b>see</b> {{a spatial}} redistribution of production platforms, however {{they will not}} necessarily be located near final markets. In fact, the key variables—in {{a context in which}} transport costs will have a relative impact—will be production and logistics specialization and efficiency. The prevailing model will be a more spatially distributed/diffused one, but it will be based on a rationale of specialization and efficiency. In a word: “one will produce in the more specialized and efficient areas and will (potentially) distribute to major global markets”. Manufacturing and logistics activities will be spatially concentrated in the most efficient and specialized regions and long-haul transport flows will be potentially fostered. Potential global leaders could then emerge in certain areas, thus implying a spatial concentration of innovation processes and of volumes (economies of scale).|$|R
