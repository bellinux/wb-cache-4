25|$|Having {{come to her}} {{literary}} maturity at a {{time when}} the ubiquitous and unvarying stated defence of the novel was its educative power, Maria Edgeworth was among the few authors who truly espoused the educator's role. Her novels are morally and socially didactic in the extreme. A close analysis of the alterations which Edgeworth's style underwent when it was pressed into the service of overt didacticism should serve to illuminate the relationship between prose technique and didactic purpose in her work. The convention which Maria Edgeworth has adopted and worked to death is basic to the eighteenth-century novel, but its roots lie in the drama, tracing at least to the Renaissance separation of high and low characters by their forms of speech. Throughout the eighteenth-century drama, and most noticeably in the sentimental comedy, the separation becomes more and more a means of moral judgment as well as social identification. The only coherent reason for Edgeworth's acceptance is the appeal of didactic moralism. In the first place, she is willing to suspend judgment wherever the service of the moral is the result. Everything else may go, so long as <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>is</b> enforced. the lesson might be a warning against moral impropriety, as in Miss Milner's story, or against social injustice, as in The Absentee. Furthermore, the whole reliance on positive exemplars had been justified long before by Steele, who argued that the stage must supply perfect heroes since its examples are imitated and since simple natures are incapable of making the necessary deductions from the negative exemplars of satire.|$|E

The lessons are in the form of three minigames which serve to increase or decrease an idol's statistics in either vocal, dance or visual image. For example, if the vocal lesson is chosen, it will not only increase an idol's vocal statistics, but also decrease an idol's dance and visual statistics. Each lesson is divided into six parts, and the player is given ranked with either a letter grade from A to E or simply a [...] "bad" [...] rank for each part depending on how well <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>is</b> performed.

The first song describes the double murder of the unfaithful woman and her lover by the Stranger, who states [...] "And they died {{with a smile on}} their faces." [...] This leads to the second song of the medley, which describes the grief of the Stranger. This section is followed by Nelson's cover of the 1947 Fred Rose, song [...] "Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain", where the fugitive laments the loss of his wife. In [...] "Red Headed Stranger," [...] the protagonist commits a subsequent murder—he kills a woman who merely reaches out to touch one of his horses.

With the Soviet Union gone, there was no longer any reason to support Mobutu as a bulwark against communism. Accordingly, the US and other Western powers began pressuring Mobutu to democratize the regime. Regarding the change in US attitude to his regime, Mobutu bitterly remarked: [...] "I am the latest victim of the cold war, no longer needed by the US. <b>The</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>is</b> that my support for American policy counts for nothing."

2500|$|The boat models {{discovered}} at Meketre′s tomb feature several {{different kinds of}} boats, including traveling boats, sporting boats, and several papyriform crafts. [...] Two of the papyriform skiffs have a trawling net slung between them. It is uncertain {{whether or not the}} net is meant to be depicted as being under the water or being pulled out of the water by the fishermen. In the event that the artist meant for the net to be in the water, {{it is interesting to note}} that the net is upside down. Needless to say, the upside down net would not work for catching fish. [...] This ambiguity points up the question of artistic veracity of the craftsmen who make ship models. As is attested by the ambiguity of the holes in the sides of the Phoenician model, and the skiff from Meketre, archaeologists need to be aware of the possibility of artistic error while interpreting ancient ship models. While a mistake involving an inverted trawling net may seem trivial, <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>is</b> important. It is important for archaeologists to be aware of the possibility that ancient artists may not have been familiar with the finer details of ships and boats.|$|E

40|$|This report {{discusses}} <b>the</b> {{development of}} <b>lessons</b> based on laborations for {{middle and high}} school. The purpose {{of the project was}} to research the possibility to affect students' attitude towards physics through well-planned stimulating <b>lessons.</b> <b>The</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>were</b> based on <b>the</b> Light and Lasers Outreach Kit, a teaching package made by the organisation Laser Classroom, and have been adapted for physics in middle and high school. <b>The</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>were</b> developed on a pedagogical and didactical ground and were improved with surveys and peer and self assessment. <b>The</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>were</b> based on laser light and its properties. One <b>lesson</b> covered <b>the</b> topic of single-slit diffraction, while the other treated geometrical optics. <b>The</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>were</b> held for 12 different classes in the local area of Gothenburg, and at all of the occasions the students were asked to participate in a survey. In this way, their general interest in physics could be measured, and it also helped to improve <b>the</b> <b>lessons.</b> When a total of 169 surveys were collected, a couple of pre-decided hyphotheses were tried with t- and chi-squared-test. After a comparison with the control group a statistically significant positive difference in the general physics interest could be measured within pupils that participated in <b>the</b> <b>lessons.</b> However, it <b>was</b> not possible to establish if this was an effect of the content of <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> or other circumstances. In general, the pupils found <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> interesting. Finally it could be established by interviewing the teachers that <b>the</b> <b>lesson</b> structures <b>were</b> useful. However the contents of <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> didn't have a perfectly clear place in the swedish high school curriculum, depending on how each teacher individually interprets it.

40|$|Approximately 250 {{remedial}} {{lessons in}} auditory {{training for the}} elementary school child are presented for six major areas: auditory reception, auditory discrimination, auditory memory, auditory sequential memory, grammatic closure, and auditory association. <b>The</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>are</b> designed for <b>the</b> child who has adequate auditory sensitivity, but who does not respond to auditory stimuli as others do. Within each major area the activities are divided into readiness, academic, and advanced levels. The levels are intended only to provide a means of dividing the activities into sections which become progressively more difficult. <b>The</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>are</b> said to assume an average class length of 50 minutes. <b>The</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>are</b> generally arranged into sections denoting instructional objective, materials to be used, activities to achieve objective, and occasional comments.
