40|$|The anemia which {{develops}} after splenectomy is most {{marked in}} animals on a mixed <b>table</b> <b>scrap</b> diet of meat, bread, cereals, and vegetables, {{which is essentially}} a cooked diet. Control studies in which a unilateral nephrectomy precedes splenectomy demonstrate that the anemia is not due to operation, hemorrhage, or accidents of convalescence but develops only {{in the absence of}} the spleen. The results of studies of the influence of food containing a large amount of iron in presumably easily utilizable form, as in raw beef spleen, do not support the view that the anemia is due to lack of iron in the food. Observation on the influence of a diet of raw meat as contrasted with cooked meat shows a more severe anemia in animals on the cooked diet and suggests the possibility that heat alters some substance which, {{in the absence of the}} spleen, the body cannot utilize. A final conclusion in regard to this point must, however, await the results of more detailed studies now in progress...|$|R

25|$|There {{are also}} names for mixed-breeds based on geography, behavior, or food. In Hawaii, mixes are {{referred}} to as poi dogs, although they are not related to the extinct Hawaiian poi dog. In The Bahamas and Turks and Caicos Islands, the common term is potcake dogs (referring to the <b>table</b> <b>scraps</b> they are fed). In South Africa the tongue-in-cheek expression pavement special is sometimes used as a description for a mixed-breed dog. In Serbia similar expression is prekoplotski avlijaner (over-the-fence yard-dweller). In the Philippines, mixed-breed street dogs are often called askal, a Tagalog-derived contraction of asong kalye (‚Äùstreet dog"). In Puerto Rico they are known as satos; in Venezuela they are called cacris, a contraction of the words callejero criollo (literally, street creole, as street dogs are usually mongrels); and in Chile and Bolivia, they are called quiltros. In Costa Rica it is common to hear the word zaguate, a term originating from a Nahuatl term, zahuatl, that refers to the scabies disease. In the rural southern United States, a small hunting dog is known as a feist.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the workday}} was ending on the {{afternoon}} of Saturday, March 25, 1911, a fire flared up at approximately 4:40 PM in a scrap bin under one of the cutter's tables at the northeast corner of the eighth floor. The first fire alarm was sent at 4:45 PM by a passerby on Washington Place who saw smoke coming from the eighth floor. Both owners of the factory were in attendance and had invited their children to the factory on that afternoon. The Fire Marshal concluded that the likely cause of the fire was the disposal of an unextinguished match or cigarette butt in the scrap bin, which held two months' worth of accumulated cuttings {{by the time of the}} fire. Beneath the table in the wooden bin were hundreds of pounds of scraps which were left over from the several thousand shirtwaists that had been cut at that <b>table.</b> The <b>scraps</b> piled up from the last time the bin was emptied, coupled with the hanging fabrics that surrounded it; the steel trim was the only thing that was not highly flammable. Although smoking was banned in the factory, cutters were known to sneak cigarettes, exhaling the smoke through their lapels to avoid detection. A New York Times article suggested that the fire may have been started by the engines running the sewing machines. A series of articles in Collier's noted a pattern of arson among certain sectors of the garment industry whenever their particular product fell out of fashion or had excess inventory in order to collect insurance. The Insurance Monitor, a leading industry journal, observed that shirtwaists had recently fallen out of fashion, and that insurance for manufacturers of them was [...] "fairly saturated with moral hazard." [...] Although Blanck and Harris were known for having had four previous suspicious fires at their companies, arson was not suspected in this case.|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this life}} cycle {{assessment}} is to investigate refining methods which {{makes it possible to}} utilise post-consumer aluminium scrap in production of aluminium products that have strict requirements to chemical purity. A further goal is to establish whether applying these methods are environmentally preferable compared to using primary aluminium to produce the same products. The investigation is based on a given scrap composition and given purity limits that must be achieved for the refined aluminium, related to six alloying elements. Based on the given requirements, a selection of refining processes which are able to refine the given scrap to meet the given limits are identified. Table A below gives the scrap composition and the desired range of removal to fit seven different alloy requirements. The scrap composition is given in weight%. <b>Table</b> A: <b>Scrap</b> composition and desired level of removal. 	Si	Mg	Fe	Cu	Mn	ZnScrap composition	 6. 11 	 0. 53 	 0. 53 	 1. 66 	 0. 23 	 0. 86 Desired removal	 10 ? 83 %	-	 6 - 57 %	 45 - 100 %	-	 77 - 100 %Different types of electrolysis and fractional crystallisation are identified as possible refining processes. Electrolysis can in theory be used to eliminate any tramp element in the scrap, as it extracts the pure aluminium from the melt using an electric current. Unfortunately this is an expensive, energy consuming process which requires use of chemicals. Fractional crystallisation does not require any chemicals and generally has low energy use, but this is a slow method which currently is not continuous. The ability of fractional crystallisation to remove the various elements depends on their solubility in aluminium in solid and liquid state. Various studies show that this method is promising for removal of Si, Fe and Cu, mediocre for Mg and Zn and poor for Mn. Based on this, six different production scenarios for secondary scrap, to meet the set of alloy requirements, were developed. The life cycle impact assessment conducted for the different refining scenarios shows that energy use is very closely linked to the environmental burden associated with each of the production scenarios. From an environmental perspective low temperature, electrolysis and fractional crystallisation seem to be the best alternatives. Since the assessment is based on specific requirements set by the scrap composition and the given purity limits, an overall impression is that other possibilities to handle excess scrap should be investigated further. For example better sorting processes to separate tramp elements earlier in the production or development of alloys which are made with a motive for recycling. Such methods {{are likely to be more}} relevant when the use of aluminium has increased even further and more stable sources of scrap can be established. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{document}} is to present conceptual design phase thermal process calculations that support the process design and process safety basis for the cold vacuum drying of K Basin KOP material. This document is intended {{to demonstrate that the}} conceptual approach: (1) Represents a workable process design that is suitable for development in preliminary design; and (2) Will support formal safety documentation to be prepared during the definitive design phase to establish an acceptable safety basis. The Sludge Treatment Project (STP) is responsible for the disposition of Knock Out Pot (KOP) sludge within the 105 -K West (KW) Basin. KOP sludge consists of size segregated material (primarily canister particulate) from the fuel and scrap cleaning process used in the Spent Nuclear Fuel process at K Basin. The KOP sludge will be pre-treated to remove fines and some of the constituents containing chemically bound water, after which it is referred to as KOP material. The KOP material will then be loaded into a Multi-Canister Overpack (MCO), dried at the Cold Vacuum Drying Facility (CVDF) and stored in the Canister Storage Building (CSB). This process is patterned after the successful drying of 2100 metric tons of spent fuel, and uses the same facilities and much of the same equipment that was used for drying fuel and <b>scrap.</b> <b>Table</b> ES-l present similarities and differences between KOP material and fuel and between MCOs loaded with these materials. The potential content of bound water bearing constituents limits the mass ofKOP material in an MCO load to a fraction of that in an MCO containing fuel and scrap; however, the small particle size of the KOP material causes the surface area to be significantly higher. This relatively large reactive surface area represents an input to the KOP thermal calculations that is significantly different from the calculations for fuel MCOs. The conceptual design provides for a copper insert block that limits the volume available to receive KOP material, enhances heat conduction, and functions as a heat source and sink during drying operations. This use of the copper insert represents a significant change to the thermal model compared to that used for the fuel calculations. A number of cases were run representing a spectrum of normal and upset conditions for the drying process. Dozens of cases have been run on cold vacuum drying of fuel MCOs. Analysis of these previous calculations identified four cases that provide a solid basis for judgments on the behavior of MCO in drying operations. These four cases are: (1) Normal Process; (2) Degraded vacuum pumping; (3) Open MCO with loss of annulus water; and (4) Cool down after vacuum drying. The four cases were run for two sets of input parameters for KOP MCOs: (1) a set of parameters drawn from safety basis values from the technical data book and (2) a sensitivity set using parameters selected to evaluate the impact of lower void volume and smaller particle size on MCO behavior. Results of the calculations for the drying phase cases are shown in Table ES- 2. Cases using data book safety basis values showed dry out in 9. 7 hours and heat rejection sufficient to hold temperature rise to less than 25 C. Sensitivity cases which included unrealistically small particle sizes and corresponding high reactive surface area showed higher temperature increases that were limited by water consumption. In this document and in the attachment (Apthorpe, R. and M. G. Plys, 2010) cases using Technical Databook safety basis values are referred to as nominal cases. In future calculations such cases will be called safety basis cases. Also in these documents cases using parameters that are less favorable to acceptable performance than databook safety values are referred to as safety cases. In future calculations such cases will be called sensitivity cases or sensitivity evaluations Calculations to be performed in support of the detailed design and formal safety basis documentation will expand the calculations presented in this document to include: additional features of the drying cycle, more realistic treatment of uranium metal consumption during oxidation, larger water inventory, longer time scales, and graphing of results of hydrogen gas concentration...|$|R
