Michael's son Falkos (1255) held properties at Szécsény and Nógrád, {{and was the}} founder of genus Libercsei, from which emerged powerful Szécsényi, Geréb of Vingárta, and Farkas of Szeszárme. To the Szécsényi belonged Kónya, Ban of Croatia (1366–67), while to the Geréb belonged Matthias, also Ban of Croatia (1483–92).|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} bats, the little brown bat is mostly active {{at night and}} leaves its roost at dusk and <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> hours are peak {{activity}} periods. They are also active before dawn. Since little brown bats live in a temperate zone, they must find some {{way of dealing with}} winter. Most temperate bats either migrate or hibernate, but little brown bats do both. In summer, the males and females live apart, the females raise the young. When fall comes, both sexes fly south to a hibernaculum, where they mate and then hibernate. Little brown bats undergo a prolonged period of hibernation during the winter {{due to the lack of}} food. They hibernate in caves as a community.|$|E

25|$|In {{the days}} before the British debate, the Dutch had offered to {{negotiate}} between Russia and the Triple Alliance, and Auckland reported that he saw documents in which Frederick Wilhelm questioned the need for the war and expressed concerns over the militant Austrian attitude (according to Polish historian Jerzy Łojek, that was either Auckland's own or Russian misinformation, or a combination of both). The debate begun on March 29. Despite criticism from the minority opponents, like Charles Fox, the House of Commons expressed its approval for the war with Russia thrice on that day. However, over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> days, debates within Pitt's own government resulted in a drastic change of plans. The specific reasons for this sudden conflict within Pitt's government are not fully understood; Łojek suggests it was through the influence of Fox, Auckland and the Russian diplomacy on several of its members. Pitt could have forced the issue by creating a new government, but he decided that was not a viable solution, as a crisis in the government could result in an unpredictable shift of power. By mid- and late April, with William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville replacing Francis Osborne, 5th Duke of Leeds as the Foreign Secretary, the British policy was now set as pro-Russian, and anti-French.|$|E
25|$|The early Manchukuo Imperial Army {{inherited}} {{a hodgepodge of}} weapons from the former Kuomintang arsenals of the Young Marshal, which created tremendous problems with maintenance and supply. For example, there were 26 kinds of rifles and over 20 kinds of pistols in use in 1932. A priority was made to unify weaponry around the Arisaka Type 38 Rifle as a standard, along with the Type 3 Heavy Machine Gun and Type 11 Light Machine Gun. Artillery units were to be equipped with the Type 38 Field Gun and Type 41 75 mm Mountain Gun. By 1935, 50,000 Type 38 cavalry rifles had been imported from Japan and the machine guns were replaced over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> years. By {{the start of the}} Pacific War, the weaponry of the Manchukuo Imperial Army was the almost same as the Japanese Army. Mauser pistols were used by soldiers and Browning and Colt pistols were used by the officers. The rear-line defense units and militias were given captured Chinese and out-dated Japanese rifles. Some ZB-30 machine guns, popular among the Nationalists, found their way into Manchukuoan service, along with Japanese copies of German and French models. IN 1936 some of the ZBs were replaced by Type 11 light machine guns. By 1933, the number of guns in service was 77,268 rifles, 441 light machine guns and 329 heavy machine guns.|$|E

In the northern and central regions, precipitation is predicted to increase while in most of central–western Argentina and Patagonia, precipitation is predicted to decrease. Because Argentina is potentially vulnerable to climate change, such projected changes based on the models could exacerbate current problems or create new problems associated with climate change in Argentina.|$|E

I think his future will be in domestic cricket and that may even help him with this particular form of illness.

[...] Michael Vaughan, who had by then retired from cricket, praised Trescothick's [...] "courageous" [...] decision, as did Vikram Solanki, then PCA chairman. Journalist Andrew Miller called for an end to the rising criticism of Trescothick's decision from the public, while Paul Hayward of the Guardian also derided those critical of the Somerset player's actions. Despite returning home, Trescothick continued to affirm his commitment to the club by signing a new three-year contract with optional fourth year, in December. He was named captain for the 2010 season.|$|E
2500|$|The IPCC {{reported}} that the effectiveness of mitigation efforts over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> decades would have a large impact {{on the ability to}} stabilize atmospheric greenhouse gases at lower levels, and that the lower the ultimate stabilization levels, the more quickly emissions would need to peak and decline. For example, to stabilize at between 445 and 490ppm (resulting in an estimate global [...] temperature 2 to 2.4oC above the pre-industrial average) emissions would need to peak before 2015, with 50 to 85% reductions on 2000 levels by 2050.|$|E

2500|$|Oysters are {{broadcast}} spawners, that is, {{eggs and}} sperm are released into open water where fertilisation occurs. They are protandric; {{during their first}} year they spawn as males by releasing sperm into the water. As they grow over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> years and develop greater energy reserves, they spawn as females by releasing eggs. Bay oysters usually spawn {{by the end of}} June. An increase in water temperature prompts a few oysters to spawn. This triggers spawning in the rest, clouding the water with millions of eggs and sperm. A single female oyster can produce up to 100 million eggs annually. The eggs become fertilized in the water and develop rapidly into planktonic larvae. which eventually find suitable sites, such as another oyster's shell, on which to settle. Attached oyster larvae are called spat. Spat are oysters less than [...] long.|$|E

[...] added that earlier estimates and statements by Mr. Wolfowitz and others 'oozed with uncertainty.'" [...] Di Rita's comments came as a much less optimistic secret Pentagon study—which had been complete at the time of Wolfowitz's testimony—was coming to public light, and when actual production results in Iraq were coinciding with those projected in the less optimistic Pentagon study.|$|E
2500|$|James Burbage's {{wife and}} her son Richard Burbage, then only about nineteen, came into the yard and beat Robert Miles with a broomstaff. Richard Burbage, after [...] "scornfully and disdainfully playing with Nicholas Bishop's nose", {{threatened}} to beat him also. At that point Cuthbert Burbage arrived, and threatened the intruders with [...] "great and horrible oaths". They were then violently thrust out of the yard. Some of the actors were attracted by the tumult, among them John Alleyn, brother of Edward Alleyn, who also put in a word for the widow Brayne, to no avail. The Admiral's Men, of which the Alleyn brothers were members, subsequently withdrew from the Theatre and went across the river to play at Henslowe's theatre. On 28 November Margaret Brayne had James Burbage arrested for being in contempt of the court order, and for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> years there was a lengthy investigation into the contempt issue which was still ongoing when Margaret Brayne died of plague in late April 1593. In her will dated 8 April she made Robert Miles her sole executor and left him the care of her daughter Katherine (insisting, however, that Katherine was John Brayne's daughter), and all her property, including her half interest in the Theatre, and Miles thereby inherited the litigation {{in which he had}} already been active as her financial backer.
