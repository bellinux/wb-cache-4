25|$|Despite her {{reputation}} as a liberal, Moseley Braun possessed something of a centrist record on economic issues. She voted for the 1993 budget package and against <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>reform</b> laws passed in 1996, but on many other matters she was more conservative. Moseley Braun {{voted in favor of}} the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and lawsuit reform measures like the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act (she was also among the minority of Democrats to support the even more controversial Common Sense Product Liability and Legal Reform Act of 1995). She also voted contrary to the interests of the more populist wing of the party by voting for the Freedom to Farm Act and the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Like her Illinois colleague, fellow Democrat Paul Simon, she voted in favor of a Balanced Budget Amendment to the United States Constitution and also to place a nuclear spent fuel storage facility in Nevada, a move strongly opposed by many Democrats, especially former Majority Leader Harry Reid.|$|E
500|$|Enactment {{of welfare}} reform was a major goal of Bill Clinton's presidency, but when the first two bills on the issue came from a Republican-controlled Congress that lacked protections for people coming off welfare, Hillary urged him to veto the bills, which he did. A third version came up during his 1996 general {{election}} campaign that restored some of the protections but cut the scope of benefits in other areas; critics, including her past mentor Edelman, urged her to get the president to veto it again. But she decided to support the bill, which became <b>the</b> <b>Welfare</b> <b>Reform</b> Act of 1996, as the best political compromise available. This caused a rift with Edelman that Hillary later called [...] "sad and painful".|$|E

[...] Rangel was bitterly opposed to the Republican Contract With America, considering it an assault on America's poor, and strongly criticized Democrats such as President Bill Clinton and religious leaders such as John Cardinal O'Connor for perpetuating [...] "the silence of good people" [...] that he likened to what happened in Nazi Germany. [...] When Rangel made a similar allusion directed at new Ways and Means chair Bill Archer in 1995, Archer refused to speak to him for several years except at public meetings. [...] Rangel also strongly opposed <b>the</b> <b>Welfare</b> <b>Reform</b> Act of 1996, accusing Clinton of supporting it for political reasons and predicting its consequences would cast a million children into poverty.|$|E

40|$|The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) of 1996 {{dramatically}} {{transformed the}} structure and goals of <b>the</b> public <b>welfare</b> system in <b>the</b> United States.
