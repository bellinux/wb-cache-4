25|$|Clement Greenberg {{included}} {{the work of}} both Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland in a show that he did at the Kootz Gallery in the early 1950s. Clem {{was the first to}} see their potential. He invited them up to New York in 1953, I think it was, to Helen's studio to see a painting that she had just done called Mountains and Sea, a very, very beautiful painting, which was in a sense, out of Pollock and out of Gorky. It also {{was one of the first}} stain pictures, one of the first large field pictures in which the stain technique was used, perhaps the first one. Louis and Noland saw the picture unrolled on the floor of her studio and went back to Washington, DC., and worked together for a while, working at <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> kind of painting.|$|E
25|$|While in Chicago, Rosenberg wrote {{politically}} charged plays {{to be performed}} in the several working-class theatres of the city. One of these dramas, Die Nihilisten (The Nihilists), was performed {{in honor of the}} Paris Commune in 1882 and featured three future defendants in the 1886 Haymarket affair — Michael Schwab, August Spies, and Oscar Neebe — playing leading roles. The play dealt with legal proceedings against a group of Nihilists in Tsarist Russia, who were sentenced to exile in Siberia, and finally freed by their comrades following the overthrow of the Tsar. In the May 18, 1882 performance in North Side Turner Hall, the role of the liberators was played by members of the local Lehr-und-Wehr Verein (Education and Defense Society), an armed workers' militia movement sweeping the German-American radical community in the Chicago area at the time. <b>The</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> casting could not be missed.|$|E

25|$|In Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World (1978), Girard {{develops}} <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> discovery. The victimary {{process is}} the missing link between the animal world and the human world, the principle that explains the humanization of primates. It allows us to understand the need for sacrificial victims, which in turn explains the hunt which is primitively ritual, and the domestication of animals as a fortuitous result of the acclimatization of a reserve of victims, or agriculture. It shows that {{at the beginning of}} all culture is archaic religion, which Durkheim had sensed. The elaboration of the rites and taboos by proto-human or human groups would take infinitely varied forms while obeying a rigorous practical sense that we can detect: the prevention of the return of the mimetic crisis. So we can find in archaic religion the origin of all political or cultural institutions.|$|E
25|$|This was the two teams' 85th Big Game, and {{was played}} on Cal's home field, California Memorial Stadium. Although Cal was {{guaranteed}} {{a winning record}} (with bowl eligibility) for the season, no bowl game was looking to invite them. <b>The</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> game were far more important to Stanford, led by quarterback John Elway, playing in his last regular season game before heading off to become a future National Football League star enshrined in both the Pro Football Hall of Fame and College Football Hall of Fame. The Cardinal football squad {{was in the midst}} of an exciting season—they were 5–5 but had victories over highly ranked Ohio State and Washington—and needed a win to be eligible to play in a bowl game. Representatives of the Hall of Fame Classic committee were in attendance, apparently to extend an invitation to Stanford, if the Cardinal won.|$|E
25|$|In {{organisms that}} use {{this method of}} dosage compensation, the {{presence}} {{of one or more}} X chromosomes must be detected early on in development, as failure to initiate the appropriate dosage compensation mechanisms is lethal. Male specific lethal proteins (MSLs) are a family of four proteins that bind to the X chromosome exclusively in males. The name “MSL” is used because mutations in these genes cause inability to effectively upregulate X-linked genes appropriately, and are thus lethal to males only and not their female counterparts. SXL regulates pre-messenger RNA in males to differentially splice MSLs and result in the appropriate increase in X chromosome transcription observed in male Drosophila. The immediate target of SXL is male specific lethal-2 (MSL-2). Current dogma suggests that the binding of MSL-2 at multiple sites along the SXL gene in females prevents proper MSL-2 translation, and thus, as previously stated, represses the possibility for X-linked genetic upregulation in females. However, all other transcription factors in the MSL family—maleless, MSL-1, and MSL-3—are able to act when SXL is not expressed, as in the case in males. These factors act to increase male X chromosome transcriptional activity. Histone acetylation and the consequent upregulation of X-linked genes in males is dictated by the MSL complex. Specifically, special roX non-coding RNAs on the MSL complexes facilitate binding to the single male X chromosome, and dictate acetylation of specific loci along the X chromosome as well as the formation of euchromatin. Though these RNAs bind at specific sites along the male X chromosome, their effects spread {{along the length of the}} chromosome and have the ability to influence large-scale chromatin modifications. <b>The</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> spreading epigenetic regulation along the male X chromosome is thought to have implications for understanding the transfer of epigenetic activity along long genomic stretches.|$|E

500|$|That {{spreading}} ridges {{could be}} subducted was recognized {{early in the}} development of plate tectonic theory, but there was little consideration of the ensuing effects.

500|$|The Bible also {{speaks of}} wine in general terms as a bringer and {{concomitant}} of joy, particularly {{in the context of}} nourishment and feasting. Wine was commonly drunk at meals, and the Old Testament prescribed it for use in sacrificial rituals and festal celebrations. The Gospel of John recorded the first miracle of Jesus: making copious amounts of wine at the wedding feast at Cana. Jesus instituted the ritual of the Eucharist at the Last Supper during a Passover celebration, he says that the [...] "fruit of the vine" [...] is a [...] "New Covenant in [...] blood," [...] though Christians have differed on <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> statement (see Eucharistic theologies contrasted).

500|$|Conceiving {{the initial}} script for Carnivàle between 1990 and 1992, Daniel Knauff set its plot in a {{carnival}} {{environment in the}} 1930s Dust Bowl, which he felt had not been dramatized as a series yet. He {{had grown up with}} a disabled father who was not commonly accepted as a normal human being. Freaks of the 1930s, however, who might not have found another place offering a future than a carnival, tended to be celebrities in the period. Daniel Knauf expanded the plot with a complex fictional universe based on a good versus evil theme, led by carnival healer Ben Hawkins and Brother Justin Crowe, a California preacher. In his story pitch to HBO, Knauf presented Carnivàle as a collection of media samples {{from the perspective of a}} fictional author trying to uncover Ben's mysterious story. These fictional samples consisted of interviews, diary entries, and various newspaper clippings, photos and book references forming the character biographies of all major Carnivàle characters. The character backgrounds were further developed before the filming of Carnivàle began, but were not made part of the show's visible structure. The audience would therefore only get to know the characters as a natural aspect in the story. The characters themselves are confronted with [...] "self-realization and becoming aware of these [...] powers and learning to harness them, and <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> battle between good and evil." [...] Seventeen actors received star billing in the first season; fifteen of whom were part of the carnival storyline. The second season amounted to thirteen main cast members, supplemented by several actors in recurring roles. Although such large casts make shows more expensive to produce, the writers have more flexibility in story decisions.|$|E
500|$|Testing {{before the}} onset of {{symptoms}} is a life-changing event and a very personal decision. The main reason given for choosing testing for HD is to aid in career and family decisions. Before 1993 there was not an available test for individuals to learn if they carried the Huntington's gene. At that time surveys indicated that 50–70% of at-risk individuals would have been interested in receiving testing, but since predictive testing has been offered far fewer choose to be tested. Over 95% of individuals at risk of inheriting HD do not proceed with testing, mostly because there is no treatment. A key issue is the anxiety an individual experiences about not knowing whether they will eventually develop HD, compared to the impact of a positive result. Irrespective of the result, stress levels {{have been found to be}} lower two years after being tested, but the risk of suicide is increased after a positive test result. Individuals found to have not inherited the disorder may experience survivor guilt with regard to family members who are affected. Other factors taken into account when considering testing include the possibility of discrimination and the implications of a positive result, which usually means a parent has an affected gene and that the individual's siblings will be at risk of inheriting it. In one study genetic discrimination was found in 46% of individuals at risk for Huntington's disease. It occurred at higher rates within personal relationships than health insurance or employment relations. [...] Genetic counseling in HD can provide information, advice and support for initial decision-making, and then, if chosen, throughout all stages of the testing process. Because of <b>the</b> <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> test, patients who wish to undergo testing must complete three counseling sessions which provide information about Huntington's.|$|E
