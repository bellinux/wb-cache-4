5|$|At birth, Victoria was {{fifth in}} the line of {{succession}} after the four eldest sons of GeorgeIII: George, the Prince Regent (later GeorgeIV); Frederick, <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> of York; William, <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> of Clarence (later WilliamIV); and Victoria's father, Edward, <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> of Kent. The Prince Regent had no surviving children, and <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> of York had no children; further, both were estranged from their wives, who were both past child-bearing age, so the two eldest brothers were unlikely to have any further children. <b>The</b> <b>Duke</b> of Clarence and <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> of Kent married on the same day in 1818, but both of Clarence's daughters (born in 1819 and 1820) died as infants. Victoria's father died in January 1820, when Victoria was less than a year old. A week later her grandfather died and was succeeded by his eldest son, GeorgeIV. <b>The</b> <b>Duke</b> of York died in 1827. When GeorgeIV died in 1830, he was succeeded by his next surviving brother, WilliamIV, and Victoria became heir presumptive. The Regency Act 1830 made special provision for the Duchess of Kent (Victoria's mother) to act as regent in case William died while Victoria was still a minor. King William distrusted the Duchess's capacity to be regent, and in 1836 he declared in her presence that he wanted to live until Victoria's 18th birthday, so that a regency could be avoided.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the war, {{the couple}} {{returned}} to France and spent the remainder of their lives essentially in retirement as <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> never occupied another official role after his wartime governorship of the Bahamas. Correspondence between <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> and Kenneth de Courcy, dated between 1946 and 1949, emerged in a US library in 2009. The letters suggest a plot where <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> would return to England and place himself in a position for a possible regency. The health of George VI was failing and de Courcy was concerned about the influence of the Mountbatten family over the young Princess Elizabeth. De Courcy suggested that <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> buy a working agricultural estate within an easy drive of London in order to gain favour with the British public and make himself available should the King become incapacitated. <b>The</b> <b>Duke</b> however hesitated and the King recovered from his surgery.|$|E
5|$|Before, during, {{and after}} the Second World War, <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> and Duchess of Windsor were {{suspected}} by many in government and society of being Nazi sympathisers.

In 1940, <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> was appointed governor of the Bahamas, and the couple moved to the islands until he relinquished the office in 1945.|$|E

He quickly gained <b>the</b> <b>Duke's</b> trust, not only by {{promising}} to make copious amounts of gold to erase <b>the</b> <b>Duke's</b> debts, but also by offering to cure <b>the</b> <b>Duke's</b> severe headache. Moreover, he tried to receive a dispensation of his priestly consecration from the Pope, using <b>the</b> <b>Duke's</b> envoys, but in vain.|$|R

5|$|In 1826, Parliament finally {{voted to}} {{increase}} Ernest's allowance. The Liverpool Government argued that <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> needed an increased allowance {{to pay for}} Prince George's education; even so, it was opposed by many Whigs.

5|$|In 1946, {{when the}} Duchess {{was staying at}} Ednam Lodge, {{the home of the}} Earl of Dudley, some of her jewels were stolen. There were rumours that the theft had been masterminded by the royal family as an attempt to regain jewels taken from the Royal Collection by <b>the</b> <b>Duke,</b> or by the Windsors {{themselves}} as part of an insurance fraud—they made a large deposit of loose stones at Cartier the following year. However, in 1960, career criminal Richard Dunphie confessed to the crime. The stolen pieces were {{only a small portion of}} the Windsor jewels, which were either bought privately, inherited by <b>the</b> <b>Duke,</b> or given to <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> when he was Prince of Wales.|$|E

5|$|In the 1960s, the Duke's health deteriorated. In December 1964, he was {{operated}} on by Michael E.

In late 1971, <b>the</b> <b>Duke,</b> who was a smoker from an early age, was diagnosed with throat cancer and underwent cobalt therapy. On 18 May 1972, Queen Elizabeth II visited the Windsors while on a state visit to France; she spoke with <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> for fifteen minutes but only the Duchess appeared with the royal party for a photocall as <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> was too ill.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the public}} blamed Ernest for Sellis's death. The more extreme Whig papers, anti-royal pamphleteers, and caricaturists all offered nefarious {{explanations}} for Sellis's death, in which <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> was to blame. Some stories had <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> cuckolding Sellis, with the attack as retaliation, or Sellis killed for finding Ernest and Mrs. Sellis in bed together. Others suggested that <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> was the lover of either Sellis or Neale, and that blackmail had {{played a part in}} the death. Both Roger Fulford and John Van der Kiste, who wrote books about George III's children, ascribe part of the animus and fear towards <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> {{to the fact that he}} did not conduct love affairs in public, as did his older brothers. According to them, the public feared what vices might be going on behind the locked doors of the Duke's house, and assumed the worst.|$|E
5|$|Robert Curthose, <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> of Normandy, invaded England in 1101 {{with the}} backing of many of the barons, but was persuaded to halt his {{campaign}} and return to Normandy after King Henry I bought him off with a substantial annuity.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Duke</b> of Wellington was {{becoming}} unpopular as Prime Minister, {{particularly in the}} industrial north west of England, for continually blocking proposed reforms. Huskisson saw himself as well placed to unite the two wings of the Tory party should <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> retire, or to lead the reforming faction of the party into a split from the Tories and a progressive alliance with the Whigs. He also saw himself as a natural ally for <b>the</b> <b>Duke,</b> despite their political differences, as a Tory popular in Liverpool and Manchester, {{both of which were}} traditionally hostile to the party. Newspapers were already beginning to report rumours that Huskisson and his supporters were to be invited back into the government.|$|E

When the Church of England refused to sanction the union, a County Durham clergyman, the Reverend Robert Anderson Jardine (Vicar of St Paul's, Darlington), offered to perform the ceremony, and <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> accepted. The new king, George VI, forbade {{members of the royal}} family to attend, to the lasting resentment of <b>the</b> <b>Duke</b> and Duchess of Windsor.
