5|$|When the Manhattan Project assumed {{responsibility}} {{for the development of}} nuclear weapons in September 1942, it also assumed {{responsibility for}} the development of suitable countermeasures. At the time, the threat posed by the German nuclear energy project was <b>taken</b> <b>very</b> <b>seriously.</b> Consideration was given to issuing a public warning of the danger of a German nuclear attack on the United States, but the director of the Manhattan Project, Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., considered the likelihood of this to be sufficiently remote that he rejected the notion of taking so drastic a step.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, oaths were <b>taken</b> <b>very</b> <b>seriously.</b> As King, James was Head of the Church of Scotland or Kirk, sworn by his Coronation Oath to {{preserve}} its position and privileges. The Test Act required government officials and MPs to swear an Oath of Allegiance to the Protestant religion and the monarch, regardless of personal religion. James thus received their support despite his own Catholicism but promised not to diminish {{the primacy of the}} Church of Scotland. Removing these restrictions was seen as contrary to that commitment. Many MPs were also members of the Episcopalian minority imposed on the Kirk in 1661; Argyll's defeat showed the weakening of Presbyterian influence but voting for these measures would undo that. James' credibility was seriously damaged, since he appeared willing to ignore his previous commitments, his Coronation Oath and his most loyal supporters.|$|E

5|$|The Manhattan Project {{intelligence}} staff {{believed that}} the Japanese atomic program was not far advanced because Japan had little access to uranium ore, the industrial effort required exceeded Japan's capacity, and, according to American physicists at the University of California, Berkeley, who knew the leading Japanese physicists personally, there were too few Japanese qualified {{to work in the}} area. Conversely, German scientists had reputations as leaders in the field, and the fear of Germany developing nuclear weapons first {{was one of the reasons}} for the establishment of the Manhattan Project. The Chancellor of Germany, Adolf Hitler, frequently claimed that Germany was developing secret weapons, and it was feared that these might include nuclear weapons. Reports of German nuclear activity were <b>taken</b> <b>very</b> <b>seriously.</b> At the instigation of the Manhattan Project, Norwegian saboteurs and Allied bombers attacked heavy-water infrastructure in German-occupied Norway in late 1942 and early 1943.|$|E
5|$|The forest cobra {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{frequent}} causes of snake bite among the African cobras, largely due its forest-dwelling habits but a bite by this species should be <b>taken</b> <b>very</b> <b>seriously</b> because it ranks as the 4th most venomous Naja (True Cobra) species. The symptomology is thought to be very {{similar to that of the}} Egyptian cobra (Naja haje). Clinical experience with this species has been very sparse, and few recorded bites have been documented. Deaths from respiratory failure due to severe neurotoxicity have been reported, but most victims will survive if prompt administration of antivenom is undertaken as soon as clinical signs of envenomation have been noted. Rare cases of spontaneous recoveries without the use of specific antivenom have also been seen; however, neglecting the use of antivenom places the patient at increased risk for major morbidity and mortality. If the snake becomes cornered or is agitated, it can quickly attack the aggressor, and because a large amount of venom is injected, a rapidly fatal outcome is possible. The mortality rate of an untreated bite is not exactly known but it is thought to be quite high. The forest cobra does not spit or spray its venom. This species is considered to be among the most intelligent of the African elapids by herpetologists.|$|E
25|$|Bite {{symptoms}} include extreme pain, tingling, throbbing, swelling, and severe nausea. Damage can occur to muscle and bone tissue, {{especially when the}} bite occurs in the outer extremities such as the hands and feet, areas {{in which there is}} not a large muscle mass to absorb the venom. A bite from any venomous snake should be <b>taken</b> <b>very</b> <b>seriously</b> and immediate medical attention sought, as allergic reaction and secondary infection are always possible.|$|E

One such influential figure was Shaykh bin Baz, then rector of the AlMedina college of theology. King Faisal would not tolerate his criticism and had him removed from his position. But his teachings had already radicalized some of his students. One of them was Juhayman al-Otaybi.|$|E
25|$|Likewise Isenkrahe's {{violation}} of the energy conservation law is unacceptable, and Kelvin's application of Clausius' theorem leads (as noted by Kelvin himself) {{to some sort of}} perpetual motion mechanism.

The accusation was printed in the Athenaeum, but because Page was an embittered former employee of the Chambers's firm, his testimony was not <b>taken</b> <b>very</b> <b>seriously.</b> Vyvyan finally denied that he was the author outright and the British Museum listed the book under George Combe's name as late as 1877.|$|E

25|$|Preferential voting has {{gradually}} extended to both {{upper and lower}} houses, in the federal, state and territory legislatures, and is also used in municipal elections, and most other kinds of elections as well, such as internal political party elections, trade union elections, church elections, elections to company boards and elections in voluntary bodies such as football clubs. Negotiations for disposition of preference recommendations to voters are <b>taken</b> <b>very</b> <b>seriously</b> by candidates because transferred preferences carry the same weight as primary votes.

25|$|After lengthy preparations, {{the fleet}} {{was ready to}} sail. The night before they were to leave, someone {{destroyed}} many of the hermai—the stone markers representing Hermes, placed around the city for good luck. This event was <b>taken</b> <b>very</b> <b>seriously</b> by the Athenian people as it was considered a bad omen for the expedition, as well as evidence of a revolutionary conspiracy to overthrow the government. According to Plutarch, Androcles, a political enemy of Alcibiades, used false witness to claim that Alcibiades {{and his friends were}} responsible. Alcibiades volunteered to be put on trial under penalty of death in order to prove his innocence (wanting to avoid his enemies charging him, in his absence, with more false information), but this request was denied.|$|E
25|$|The Secessionists {{were those}} who had split in the 18th century from the {{established}} Presbyterian church. David Smyton or Smeaton had been 'called' to Kilmaurs, however he developed the belief that in the dispensation of the Sacrament, it was essential that the bread must be first lifted before being blessed. Such a small point was <b>taken</b> <b>very</b> <b>seriously</b> by Smeaton and he fought hard for in his view Divine Authority would accept no latitude in this matter. The Weston Tavern was formerly Smyton's manse, built in 1740, however it was disposed of in 1789 upon his death. The 'Non-lifter' congregation built a meeting house and manse at Holland Green on the Fenwick Road. Tradition has it that Smyton forgot to 'lift the bread' at his first service following his victory in maintaining the possession of the Secession church in Kilmaurs.|$|E

25|$|Rev. Duncan Magee (Derek McGrath)– The {{priest of}} the Anglican Church which also houses the mosque, he {{is a good}} friend to Amaar and the two clerics often turn to each other for advice.

25|$|Art {{has long}} been controversial, {{that is to say}} disliked by some viewers, {{for a wide variety of}} reasons, though most pre-modern controversies are dimly recorded, or {{completely}} lost to a modern view. Iconoclasm is the destruction of art that is disliked for a variety of reasons, including religious ones. Aniconism is a general dislike of either all figurative images, or often just religious ones, and has been a thread in many major religions. It has been a crucial factor in the history of Islamic art, where depictions of Muhammad remain especially controversial. Much art has been disliked purely because it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers, parties or other groups. Artistic conventions have often been conservative and <b>taken</b> <b>very</b> <b>seriously</b> by art critics, though often much less so by a wider public. The iconographic content of art could cause controversy, as with late medieval depictions of the new motif of the Swoon of the Virgin in scenes of the Crucifixion of Jesus. The Last Judgment by Michelangelo was controversial for various reasons, including breaches of decorum through nudity and the Apollo-like pose of Christ.|$|E
25|$|Hildegard {{was born}} in 1098 and {{at the age of}} {{fourteen}} she entered the double monastery of Dissibodenberg. She wrote the medical text Causae et curae, in which many medical practices of the time were demonstrated. This book contained diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of many different diseases and illnesses. This text sheds light on medieval medical practices of the time. It also demonstrates the vast amount of knowledge and influences that she built upon. In this time period medicine was <b>taken</b> <b>very</b> <b>seriously,</b> as is shown with Hildegard's detailed descriptions on how to perform medical tasks. The descriptions are nothing without their practical counterpart, and Hildegard was thought to have been an infirmarian in the monastery where she lived. An infirmarian treated not only other monks but pilgrims, workers, and the poor men, women, and children in the monastery's hospice. Because monasteries were located in rural areas the infirmarian was also responsible for the care of lacerations, fractures, dislocations, and burns. Along with typical medical practice the text also hints that the youth (such as Hildegard) would have received hands-on training from the previous infirmarian. Beyond routine nursing this also shows that medical remedies from plants, either grown or gathered, had a significant impact of the future of medicine. This was the beginnings of the domestic pharmacy.|$|E

Other objects like Ba gua mirrors are still regularly used to deflect evil spirits, and buildings often lack any floor number that has a 4 in it, due to its similarity to the word for [...] "die" [...] in Cantonese. The fusion of east and west also characterises Hong Kong's cuisine, where dim sum, hot pot, and fast food restaurants coexist with haute cuisine.|$|E
500|$|The {{first and}} second of these issues are related. Erskine's brother had already been exiled for his support of the Jacobites. Simon Fraser, Lord Lovat, {{a key figure in}} Lady Grange's {{abduction}} was himself executed for his part in the Jacobite Rising of 1745. No concrete evidence of Erskine's plotting against the crown or government has ever emerged, but any threat of such exposure, whether based in fact or fantasy would certainly have been <b>taken</b> <b>very</b> <b>seriously</b> by all concerned. It was thus relatively easy for Erskine to find accomplices amongst the Highland gentry.
