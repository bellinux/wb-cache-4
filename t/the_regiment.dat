5|$|Activated in 1949, <b>the</b> <b>regiment</b> {{trained for}} more than a year before the {{outbreak}} of the war on June 25, 1950. On that day, half of <b>the</b> <b>regiment</b> led North Korean forces against South Korean troops by land and sea, pushing them back after several days of fighting. Over the next six weeks <b>the</b> <b>regiment</b> advanced slowly down the Korean Peninsula, acting as a forward unit of the North Korean army. Suffering from a lack of supplies and mounting casualties, <b>the</b> <b>regiment</b> was committed to the Battle of Pusan Perimeter as part of a push to force United Nations (UN) troops out of Korea.|$|E
5|$|After halting overnight, <b>the</b> <b>regiment</b> led the NZMRB at 04:30 {{to attack}} the Turkish position. By 05:15 <b>the</b> <b>regiment</b> made contact with the Turkish {{outposts}} and advanced on foot towards the main Turkish defences, under covering fire from the Royal Horse Artillery (RHA). <b>The</b> <b>regiment</b> had the 3rd Squadron on the left, and two troops of the 11th Squadron and a machine-gun section on the right. Their right flank {{was supposed to be}} covered by the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, but it had failed to arrive. In consequence <b>the</b> <b>regiment</b> had to extend its lines to cover the open flank, so two troops from the 4th Squadron were sent there. Things were also not going well on the other flank. At 11:20 the Canterbury Mounted Rifles were forced to retire. Then, just before midday, two Turkish battalions of about 1,100 men attacked <b>the</b> <b>regiment.</b> Still supported by the RHA, the brigade held its positions. For the next three and a half hours, the brigade was subjected to a heavy artillery bombardment. This was followed by another attack by three Turkish battalions. Holding out until 16:15 <b>the</b> <b>regiment</b> was then ordered to pull back. The day's fighting cost <b>the</b> <b>regiment</b> twelve dead and twenty-one wounded.|$|E
50|$|On March 15, 1920, the 95th Saskatchewan Rifles amalgamated {{with the}} 60th Rifles of Canada and was renamed <b>the</b> South Saskatchewan <b>Regiment.</b> In 1924, <b>the</b> South Saskatchewan <b>Regiment</b> was reorganized into: <b>the</b> Regina Rifles <b>Regiment,</b> <b>the</b> Assiniboia <b>Regiment,</b> <b>the</b> Weyburn <b>Regiment,</b> <b>the</b> Saskatchewan Border <b>Regiment,</b> and <b>the</b> South Saskatchewan <b>Regiment.</b>|$|R

5|$|Against {{the advice}} of Captain Dove, Paxton {{continued}} to advance <b>the</b> <b>regiment.</b> The element of surprise was gone, and it was dark. Dove knew the probability of being attacked was high, and he took steps to minimize the danger to the main column. The advance guard was ambushed around 1:00 am on May 2. Dove received a severe wound on his foot, {{and two of his}} men were killed. The regiment's total losses were four killed, eight wounded, and four missing—plus 28 horses killed.

Their first engagement was in the Gallipoli Campaign between May and December 1915, during which they participated in the largest battle of that theatre at Chunuk Bair and the fighting for Hill 60. Evacuated to Egypt, <b>the</b> <b>regiment</b> took part in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign from 1916 to 1918. Their early battles included Romani, Gaza and Beersheba.

5|$|At 02:30 on 26 March, <b>the</b> <b>regiment</b> set {{out from}} Dier El Belah towards Gaza. The {{division}} was to circle the town, cutting off any escape route east and provide a blocking force to stop Turkish reinforcements, while the 53rd (Welsh) Division and a brigade of the 54th (East Anglian) Division carried out a frontal assault. Positioned at the Humra mound in the east with the 4th and 11th Squadrons, <b>the</b> <b>regiment</b> was assigned to watch for Turkish reinforcement coming from Huj. The main attack was not progressing well, so the brigade, {{along with the rest}} of the division, was ordered to attack Gaza. Still watching out for Turkish reinforcements, <b>the</b> <b>regiment</b> was held in reserve. The brigade had made good progress and was inside the town when it was ordered to withdraw.

5|$|By January 1919, <b>the</b> <b>regiment</b> {{were still}} waiting to return home, and had begun {{education}} courses, continuation training and playing sports. This occupied them until March when a revolt broke out in Egypt, and <b>the</b> <b>regiment</b> drew its equipment back out of storage {{and headed for the}} Nile Delta. Posted to Quesna, all of the regiment's squadrons, except the 9th which went to Cairo, began policing the riots and trying to stop looting. Once the rioting had been quelled, <b>the</b> <b>regiment</b> once again waited to return home. Their return finally began on 30 June 1919, when the majority of the brigade left the Suez Canal for New Zealand and the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment ceased to be a unit.|$|E
