5|$|By 390 BC, several Gallic tribes were invading Italy {{from the}} north as their culture {{expanded}} throughout Europe. The Romans were alerted to this when a particularly warlike tribe, the Senones, invaded two Etruscan towns close to Rome's sphere of influence. These towns, overwhelmed by the enemy's numbers and ferocity, called on Rome for help. The Romans met the Gauls in pitched battle at the Battle of Allia River around 390–387 BC. The Gauls, led by the chieftain Brennus, defeated the Roman army of approximately 15,000 troops, pursued the fleeing Romans back to Rome, and sacked the city before being either driven off or bought off. The Romans and Gauls continued to war intermittently in Italy for more <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>centuries.</b>|$|E

On December 23, 2012, on the 40th anniversary of the Immaculate Reception, the Steelers unveiled a monument at the exact spot where Franco Harris made the reception in the parking lot.

5|$|The clock tower has not survived, and its exact {{location}} is undetermined, {{although it is}} believed to have been located at or near the Spasskaya Tower (formerly known as Frolovskaya).

5|$|Following more <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>centuries</b> of Arab rule, Armenia gained {{independence}} {{under the}} leadership of the Bagratid (Bagratuni) dynasty around 885. King Ashot III made Ani capital in 961, after which the city emerged as a prosperous urban center with 100,000 residents at its height. The construction of the cathedral began in 989. The architect Trdat was commissioned by Bagratid King Smbat II to build a cathedral in the new capital of the Armenian kingdom. The construction was halted when Smbat died in 989, according to an inscription on the south wall. Meanwhile, Trdat was hired to direct the repairs of the dome of the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, which had collapsed in an earthquake. Trdat returned from Constantinople in 993. The construction was continued and completed by Queen Katranide (Katramide), the wife of King Gagik I, Smbat's brother and successor. It was completed either in 1001 or 1010. According to Christina Maranci the generally accepted date of completion is 1001, but it may have extended until 1010. The contradiction is based on the reading of the inscription of the cathedral's northern wall. The cathedral served as the seat of the catholicos, the head of the Armenian Apostolic Church from its foundation in 1001 until the mid-11th century (1046 or 1051). Thus, for around half a century Ani was both the religious and secular center of Armenia.|$|E

Today, as {{the majority of the}} University Botanic Garden in Italy, the Modena Botanic Garden is endorsed in several projects of plants conservation and ecosystem managements that are compliant with the Global Strategy for Plants Conservation. Even if its original location in the centre of the town does not permit enlargement of the area or structural modifications, however, greatly helps the education activities carried out in the Garden, while the conservation activities are developed outside the Garden by means of numerous cooperation with Parks, natural reserves and other administrative bodies or institutions. The Botanic Garden of Modena recently started different in situ/ex situ integrated conservation projects together Parks and other land-managing institutions. Even if such projects involves {{only a limited number of}} endangered and/or vulnerable species/populations, however some interesting and noticeable results had been achieved. Plantlets are often obtained by the way of non-conventional techniques, such as in vitro cultures (for example indigenous Orchidaceae). Cooperation with local Museums gave interesting sources for future actions: the collections that they preserve are mostly related to circumscribed local areas or well defined periods, so they are the source of fundamental information about past situations. Investigation on flora and vegetation and the monitoring of plants and plants communities, carried out in protected areas, cooperating with the National Forestry Service, is a very important source of knowledge to improve conservation and verify the effectiveness of conservation actions...|$|R
40|$|Background: During {{the last}} decade or so the century old bespoke tailors on Savile Row have become the epitome of luxury brands as far as {{menswear}} is concerned. At the same time, the different establishments on Savile Row have started to modernise themselves through various means to better fit into today’s fast paced retail-market. Aims of the research: The purpose of this research is to discover what factors have played part in keeping the founders of Savile Row, Henry Poole & Co., modern and relevant throughout the years. Methods: This research was conducted as a qualitative single case, case study. The data was gathered through semi-structured interviews with upper management and other available published sources and then analysed with the help of former research in relevant areas. Results: It was found that the brand of Henry Poole & Co. stayed true to their origins as a bespoke tailor and that modernising is something that has not been forced upon the company and brand but should more be seen as a continuous process where each new generation bring something new to the company. The company had adapted modern ways of communication such as social media and a responsive website and also incorporated step down line extensions, where they sell ready-to-wear and made-to-measure garments in China and Japan. This is a way to develop their brand into other segments but they still kept their original brand vision intact as being a pure bespoke tailor located on Savile Row and kept their different business operations on a distance. Contributions: This thesis has opened up doors to an area that has not had much interest from the academic world. It hopefully gives way for new research ideas, but it has also highlighted management tools and best practices that has contributed to the success of a more <b>than</b> <b>two</b> <b>century</b> old company...|$|R

Additionally, because the Louisiana waterthrush is dependent on large areas of continuous forest, this species {{is likely to be}} threatened by increasing forest fragmentation. Timber harvesting, agriculture, urban development and gas drilling may further reduce the available habitat for this species. The population seems be quite extremely sensitive to changes in habitat quality and quantity. Threats to the Canadian population of this species include reduced insect prey and reductions in water supply due to agricultural drainage, excessive irrigation and climate change, as well as logging and habitat fragmentation.|$|R
40|$|Themes {{covered in}} the {{different}} chapters of the thesis include <b>two</b> <b>centuries</b> of amorous song collections in youth groups. From the French song collections and gallant imagination in alba amicorum of young ladies circa 1600 to the mix of amorous lyricism and revolutionary discours in youth repertoires of the late 18 th century. But there are also repertoires for young nightlife, songs to dance to and sing at the ball, and local song repertoires for young people and students in Louvain. Adult song writers use their collection as a didactic tool to help young maidens choose a path for their adult lives, or distance their work from any kind of didactic purpose by proclaiming it the repertoire of the Calis gang, an imaginary fraternity of drunkards, bums and worse. At {{the end of the}} 18 th century a new type of manuscript song collection appears, the organized work of large-scale collectors of the popular song culture as it exists at the time.
