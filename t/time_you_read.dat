2500|$|After {{both men}} have {{fallen to the}} ground from their {{separate}} shootings, another man, Eric (Shia LaBeouf), enters looking for them (saying he's [...] "just thought of the funniest thing"). Dave comes back to life to shoot Eric in the stomach, who collapses, once again to the same music. The sister herself (Kristen Wiig) enters the scene, and begins to read the letter (Dear Sister, By the <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> this..) until she too is shot in the gut several times by {{each of the three}} men on the ground, with the music cue restarting with every shot, until she collapses too.|$|E
2500|$|One notable {{unfavorable}} opinion {{appeared in}} the Daily Mail. In the piece, the plot of The Fault in Our Stars was described as [...] "mawkish at best, exploitative at worst" [...] and the book was characterized as belonging to the [...] "sick-lit" [...] young adult genre, together with other young-adult novels such as Never Eighteen and Before I Die. This entire genre, {{as well as the}} genre of young-adult novels dealing with suicide and self-harm (the piece mentions Thirteen Reasons Why, By the <b>Time</b> <b>You</b> <b>Read</b> This, I'll Be Dead, [...] The Lovely Bones, and Red Tears) was criticized as being [...] "distasteful" [...] and inappropriate for their target audience of teens. The Guardian criticized the piece, pointing out in particular that The Fault in Our Stars was chosen by The Guardian as that month's [...] "teen book club choice" [...] because [...] "it's a gripping read, featuring two compelling characters, that deals sensitively and even humorously with a difficult situation without descending into mawkishness." [...] In general, The Guardian faulted the Daily Mail for suggesting that the issues of illness, depression, and sexuality are inappropriate precisely [...] "in the one place where difficult subjects have traditionally been most sensitively explored for teens: fiction written specifically for them." [...] For his part, in an interview for The Guardian, John Green said: [...] "The thing that bothered me about The Daily Mail piece was that it was a bit condescending to teenagers. I'm tired of adults telling teenagers that they aren't smart, that they can't read critically, that they aren't thoughtful, and I feel like that article made those arguments." ...|$|E

6000|$|For {{you must}} {{recollect}} {{that it is}} not a book to be read with as much ease as its pleasant style may lead you to imagine. You spin through it as if it were a novel the first <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> it, and think you know all about it; the second <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> it you think you know rather less about it; and the third time, you are amazed to find how little you have really apprehended its vast scope and objects. I can positively say that I never take it up without finding in it some new view, or light, or suggestion that I have not noticed before. That is the best characteristic of a thorough and profound book; and I believe this feature of the [...] "Origin of Species" [...] explains why so many persons have ventured to pass judgment and criticisms upon it which are by no means worth the paper they are written on.|$|E
5000|$|In a 1996 Lecture in Sydney, {{referring}} to the work Zhuan Falun, Li stated: [...] "Although Qigong has been spread {{for quite a long}} period of time, several decades already, no one knows its real implications. Therefore, I have written in the book, Zhuan Falun, everything about certain phenomena in the Qigong community, why Qigong is spread in ordinary human society, and what the ultimate goal of Qigong is. Therefore, this book is a systematic work that enables one to practice cultivation. Through reading it repeatedly, many people feel that there is something unique about the book: no matter how many <b>times</b> <b>you</b> have <b>read</b> this book, <b>you</b> always seem to feel a sense of freshness, and no matter how many <b>times</b> <b>you</b> have <b>read</b> it, <b>you</b> always attain a different understanding from the same sentence, and no matter how many <b>times</b> <b>you</b> have <b>read</b> it, <b>you</b> always feel that there is still a great deal of content in it that is yet to be found. Why is it this way, then? It is because that I have systematically compiled many things that are considered heavenly secrets within this book, such as that people are able to practice cultivation, how cultivation should be practiced, and the characteristics of this universe, etc. For a practitioner, it can enable him to complete his cultivation practice successfully. Because no one has ever done such a thing in the past, when reading this book, many people find {{that a lot of the}} contents are heavenly secrets." ...|$|R

I know I despair of Reviewers many times. Yet often the Reviewer has misunderstood you because you have allowed him/her to misunderstand. Work with Reviewers to eliminate such misunderstandings. Clarify your pronouns, especially ‘this’. One should not aim at being possible to understand, but at being impossible to misunderstand. (Quintillion...|$|R

And if, at the <b>time</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> this, {{you can run}} out {{and gather}} a true violet, and its leaf, {{you will find that}} the flower grows from the very ground, out of a cluster of {{heart-shaped}} leaves, becoming here a little rounder, there a little sharper, but on the whole heart-shaped, and that is the proper and essential form of the violet leaf. You will find also that the flower has five petals; and being held down by the bent stalk, two of them bend back and up, as if resisting it; two expand at the sides; and one, the principal, grows downwards, with its attached spur behind. So that the front view of the flower must be some modification of this typical arrangement, Fig. M, (for middle form). Now the statement above quoted from Figuier, § 16, means, if {{he had been able to}} express himself, that the two lateral petals in the violet are directed downwards, Fig. II. A, and in the pansy upwards, Fig. II. C. And that, in the main, is true, and to be fixed well and clearly in your mind. But in the real orders, one flower passes into the other through all kinds of intermediate positions of petal, and the plurality of species are of the middle type. Fig. II. B.[3] ...|$|E

50|$|I {{thought the}} best {{newspaper}} comic strips were long gone, and Ive never been happier to be wrong. Richard Thompsons Cul de Sac {{has it all}} - intelligence, gentle humor, a delightful way with words, and, most surprising of all, wonderful, wonderful drawings. Cul de Sacs whimsical take on the world and playful sense of language somehow gets funnier the more <b>times</b> <b>you</b> <b>read</b> it. Four-year-old Alice and her Blisshaven Preschool classmates will ring true to any parent. Doing projects {{in a cloud of}} glue and glitter, the little kids manage to reinterpret an otherwise incomprehensible world via their meandering, nonstop chatter. But I think my favorite character is Alices older brother, Petey. A haunted, controlling milquetoast, hes surely one of the most neurotic kids to appear in comics. These children and their struggles are presented affectionately, {{and one of the things}} I like best about Cul de Sac is its natural warmth. Cul de Sac avoids both mawkishness and cynicism and instead finds genuine charm in its loopy appreciation of small events. Very few strips can hit this subtle note.|$|R
