[...] Electrical synapses make direct {{electrical connections}} between neurons, but chemical synapses {{are much more}} common, and much more diverse in function. [...] At a chemical synapse, the cell that sends signals is called presynaptic, and the cell that receives signals is called postsynaptic. [...] Both the presynaptic and postsynaptic areas are full of molecular machinery that carries out the signalling process. [...] The presynaptic area contains large numbers of tiny spherical vessels called synaptic vesicles, packed with neurotransmitter chemicals. [...] When the presynaptic terminal is electrically stimulated, an array of molecules embedded in the membrane are activated, and cause {{the contents of the}} vesicles to be released into the narrow space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes, called the synaptic cleft. [...] The neurotransmitter then binds to receptors embedded in the postsynaptic membrane, causing them to enter an activated state. [...] Depending on the type of receptor, the resulting effect on the postsynaptic cell may be excitatory, inhibitory, or modulatory in more complex ways. For example, release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at a synaptic contact between a motor neuron and a muscle cell induces rapid contraction of the muscle cell. [...] The entire synaptic <b>transmission</b> <b>process</b> takes only a fraction of a millisecond, although the effects on the postsynaptic cell may last much longer (even indefinitely, in cases where the synaptic signal leads to the formation of a memory trace).|$|E

In the present study, the authors examine how intergenerational <b>transmission</b> <b>processes</b> on relationship satisfaction differ between individ-uals with different gender and cultural identities. A multigroup structural equation modeling analysis compares the influence of family-of-origin factors on relationship satisfaction between Asian-born Asian, North American– born Asian, and Caucasian American heterosexual couples. Results suggest that Asian-born Asians experience greater influence from their family-of-origin than North American–born Asians and Caucasians. Males experience greater influence from their family-of-origin than females in Asian couples whereas females experience greater influence in Caucasian couples.

40|$|Cape Breton step {{dancing is}} the {{regional}} label, {{given to the}} vernacular form of percussive step dance found in Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada. Whether improvised or choreographed into a routine, this dance genre has, alongside the local fiddle tradition become emblematic for the Cape Breton community identity. Exploring the Percussive Routes and Shared Commonalities in Cape Breton Step Dancing is the first academic study where the investigation is focused on visual, aural and kinaesthetic <b>transmission</b> <b>processes</b> {{at work in the}} Cape Breton dance community. Observing, participating and sensing by utilizing phenomenological hermeneutics as a research method are the three <b>transmission</b> <b>processes</b> which are analysed individually and symbiotically. The study observes how Cape Breton step dance movements are embodied and also how they migrate from body to body by means of the three sensoria. Observations on visual transmission, for example, draw on recent research in the cognitive sciences, and what aspects of the dance tradition that are acquired by direct observation in different community contexts are explored. Aural, or ear, learning probes the interconnected transmission environment of the home as one example, and furthermore looks at the particular local soundscape that informs dancers of sound and rhythm preferences in the Cape Breton music and song tradition and its relationship to dance movement. As a means of transmitting cultural knowledge, kinaesthetic transfer, alongside visual and aural processes, could be seen as a key component for shaping the aesthetic, stylistic and movement preferences of step dancing in Cape Breton. Kinaesthetic transfer is the bringing out of somatic, or felt, dimensions of movement; in other words, the proprioceptive or kinaesthetic awareness of movement’s kinetic vitality. The combination of these three <b>transmission</b> <b>processes</b> at work in different dance contexts enables and informs the individual dancer of the Cape Breton community’s preferred style and aesthetic criteria for step dancing. Equally, these processes enable the same individual to improvise their dancing round a commonly shared repertoire of motifs, or ‘steps’ that form part of the flexible boundaries surrounding the shared commonalities of this dance genre. This study aims to illustrate the aforementioned <b>transmission</b> <b>processes</b> at work in the contexts of the home, the dance class, the concert, and at the local square dances. The analysis of these processes aims to elicit what common movement material and aesthetic and stylistic criteria the local community considers to be essential components of Cape Breton step dance. A concluding picture which emerges, based on the particular sources of this study, is one of a holistic transmission environment, where the processes of sights, sounds, and kinaesthetic awareness, all often subconsciously, work harmoniously together to inform each actor in this cultural context. Transmission occurs {{over long periods of time}} and develops into an on-going process that forms an integral part of daily life for those involved. Even though the home context is no longer the primary environment for transmission of dance, the informality of transmission at concerts and at square dances deepens the understanding, provided in the class teaching context. The dance genre is changing, with a growing motif repertoire being one result. This study, however, shows that most of the essential elements with regard to movement repertoire, aesthetic and stylistic criteria are maintained. These essential elements make up the shared commonalities that define Cape Breton step dance and which are passed on through the <b>transmission</b> <b>processes</b> described...|$|R
