40|$|Formerly, {{concerning}} {{the relation between}} hormone and heterotransplantation, the author reported that, while teststerone inhibited heterotransplantation, estrogen and <b>testectomy</b> acceralate it. In this experiment, mice of R(3) strain were used. All mice were transplanted of mammary carcinoma from the R(3) strain of female mouse. The conclusions of this experiment are as follows; 1) Testaterone inhibited the homotransplantation and growth of tumor. 2) Estrogen and <b>testectomy</b> acceraiate the homotransplantation and growth of tumor...|$|E
40|$|Seven {{cases of}} {{congenital}} {{absence of the}} vas deferens which was observed {{during the period of}} 4 years and 3 months since 1960 were reported. These cases included 3 bilateral, 2 righ-side and 7 left-side involvements and were detected in connection with sterility in 6 cases and at the operation of <b>testectomy</b> in one case. In Japan, a total of 35 cases, including our patients, of congenital absence of the vas deferens have been reported so far. Discussions are made on literatures...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of the adrenal gland is connected with the {{activity of}} other endocrine glands, such as the gonads. The experiments were conducted on testectomized adult, male rats, Wistar strain, acclimated on two ambient temperatures: room and moderately high temperature. Bilateral <b>testectomy</b> {{was performed on the}} rats of both temperatures and analyses were made 15 - 20 days after surgery. It was shown that the adrenal weight of testectomized heat acclimated rats was significantly increased. The widening of zona reticularis, shortening of zona fasciculata, as well as presence of supracortical nodules in the adrenal cortex of testectomized rats, regardless of the ambient temperature, was evidenced. Lipid content in the adrenocortical cells was lowered in both groups, but that was more prominent in testectomized rats from room temperature. The morphometric measurements of the nuclear area and volume were significantly elevated only in zona reticularis cells of testectomised animals from room temperature. Those parameters were significantly decreased in testectomized heat acclimated rats in comparison with the same values in the testectomized animals from room temperature. These results suggest that <b>testectomy</b> provokes changes towards increased {{activity of the}} adrenal cortex in both ambient temperatures, but those changes are less intense in heat acclimated animals...|$|E
40|$|The {{incidence}} of bilateral testicular cancer is 5 % {{in the total}} cohort of patients. Synchronous and metachronous testicular cancers are detected in 1 - 2 and 3 % of cases, respectively. The standard treatment for testicular cancer is orchifuniculectomy and that for synchronous or metachronous cancer is organ-saving treatment, <b>testectomy.</b> The paper describes a clinical case of multiple primary metachronous testicular cancer. A 24 -year-old patient underwent surgery (orchifuniculectomy) and received 4 courses of BEP polychemotherapy for embryonal carcinoma of the left testicle at the P. A. Herzen Moscow Oncology Research Institute. After 55 months, a dynamic control examination diagnosed a 9 -mm tumor in his single right testis that was thereafter resected. Its histological examination revealed embryonal carcinoma with solitary structures in the immature teratoma. Following 22 months, a control examination showed a recurrence of the disease, for which orchifuniculectomy of the single right testis, followed by hormone replacement therapy, was performed. The follow-up period was 80 months; no recurrence is now observed. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{castration}} and sex hormones on alcohol preference in animal were investigated. Male and female C 57 BL/ 6 j mice {{were used for}} this experiments. At 3 weeks after birth <b>testectomy</b> or overiectomy was performed and then alcohol preference was observed for a prolonged time. Moreover, alcohol preference before administration of sex hormones was compared with that after administration in castrated mice. In addition, effects of castration on liver ADH activity and body weight were studied. The results were as follows. 1. Both castrated males and females showed a tendency of decrease in alcohol preference throughout the experimental period, especially from 5 th to 9 th months after birth. 2. Following sex hormones administration, a tendency of increase was seen in alcohol preference which had been decreased by castration {{in a part of}} animals. 3. Testectomied-mice showed a tendency of slight increase of liver ADH activity (both mU/g and mU/mouse). Ovariectomied-mice showed no changes of liver ADH activity (both mU/g and mU/mousse). In both castrated males and females increase in body weight was observed...|$|E
