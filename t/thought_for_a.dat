25|$|Boyd {{received}} substantial {{media attention}} during his deep {{run on the}} 2003 World Series of Poker Main Event, where he finished in 12th place. He {{was involved in a}} key hand late in the tournament with Chris Moneymaker. Boyd held KQ and Moneymaker had pocket 3s. After the 9 2 5 flop had missed Boyd, Moneymaker bet $100,000, and Dutch forced him all-in on a bluff. Moneymaker <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while about calling, but eventually did put his tournament life on the line. Boyd did not improve on his over cards and was left with a very small stack. Boyd would go down in 12th place not long after the hand, and Moneymaker would go on to win the tournament. Shortly after this, he founded a group of young poker players called The Crew that achieved notable success. In addition to playing poker professionally, Boyd attempted to establish another online poker room which charged players a monthly membership fee rather than rake in order to play. Boyd's new endeavor would not materialize.|$|E
25|$|Later that summer, a {{well known}} gambler from the Skeena River was aboard, {{and he spoke}} to Captain Bucey about the {{possibility}} of having a poker game on one of the lower decks. The gambler promised it would not only occupy the players, but some spectators as well. Bucey was agreeable to the idea and gave his consent. Although gambling on sternwheelers that held liquor licenses was illegal, it was also a long and much-loved tradition. The game started off modestly enough, but soon huge sums were being wagered, and some large jackpots were being won. Present {{since the start of the}} game was a stranger, who was a provincial policeman who was being transferred to a new post by the constable at Fort George. Several hours into play, and when the table was covered with a drift of bills, this man abruptly announced his identity, declared the game illegal and confiscated all the money. The players and other spectators were outraged and immediately turned into an angry mob. The Skeena River gambler jumped to the policeman's defense and let the man return to his stateroom while he tried to mollify the angry men. After promising to refund any losses, the gambler went to speak to Captain Bucey to see what could be done about the matter. Bucey <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment and then suggested to the gambler that he go talk to the policeman and suggest that if he let the game continue, he can keep half the money he took. The gambler did so, and was surprised when the policeman accepted the bribe. Upon hearing of the policeman's decision, Bucey had his first mate take over at the wheel, and accompanied by two deckhands, he went to the policeman's stateroom and took him down to the lower deck where the game had started again. Once there he told everyone how the policeman had tried to steal their money, but he assured everyone that he had complete control of his own ship, and that this incident would be reported to the magistrate at Fort George, and that the crooked policeman would be on the next steamer south. The bribe was surrendered, and the game continued unhampered. Captain Bucey had won the respect of his passengers, and their friendship.|$|E

500|$|The Democratic Left Movement (DLM, [...] Harakat Al-Yassar Al-Dimuqratiy, Arabic acronym HYD) is a nonsectarian and a {{democratic}} leftist political party with seats in the Lebanese Parliament.

500|$|Despite {{these recent}} developments, Larkin and his circle are {{nonetheless}} still firmly rejected by modernist critics and poets. For example, the poet Andrew Duncan, writing of The Movement on his pinko.org website, notes that [...] "there {{now seems to}} be a very wide consensus that it was a bad thing, and that Movement poems are tedious, shallow, smug, sententious, emotionally dead, etc. Their successors in the mainstream retain most of these characteristics. Wolfgang Gortschacher's book on Little Magazine Profiles ... shows ... that there was a terrific dearth of magazines during the 50s—an impoverishment of openings which correlates with rigid and conservative poetry, and with the hegemony of a few people determined to exclude dissidents." [...] Peter Riley, a key player in the British Poetry Revival, which was a reaction against The Movement's poets, has also criticised Larkin for his uncritical and ideologically narrow position: [...] "What after all were Larkin and The Movement but a denial of the effusive ethics of poetry from 1795 onwards, in favour of 'This is what life is really like' as if anyone <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> second of representing observable 'life'. W.S. Graham and Dylan Thomas knew perfectly well that 'life' was like that, if you nominated it thus, which is why they went elsewhere." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to a {{misunderstanding}} by Sir Edward Coke in his Institutes of the Lawes of England, academics <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{long time that}} the King's Bench was primarily a criminal court. This was factually incorrect; no indictment was tried by the King's Bench until January 1323, and no record of the court ordering {{the death penalty is}} found until halfway through Edward II's reign. The court did have some criminal jurisdiction, with a royal ordinance in 1293 directing conspiracy cases to be brought to the King's Bench and the court's judges acting in trailbaston commissions around the country. A.T. Carter, in his History of English Legal Institutions, defines the early King's Bench jurisdiction as [...] "to correct all crimes and misdemeanours that amounted to a breach of the peace, the King being then plaintiff, for such were in derogation of the Jura regalia; and to take cognizance of everything not parcelled out to the other courts". By the end of the 14th century much of the criminal jurisdiction had declined, although the court maintained a criminal jurisdiction over all cases in Middlesex, the county where Westminster Hall stood. The King's Bench's main jurisdiction was over [...] "pleas of the crown"; cases which involved the King in some way. With the exception of revenue matters, which were handled by the Exchequer of Pleas, the King's Bench held exclusive jurisdiction over these cases.|$|E
500|$|With {{no party}} {{organisation}} and only his own financial resources, Davies's campaign was initially very low-key. His election literature {{was a single}} sheet with the message [...] "You Know Me, I've Never Let You Down". As polling day approached, however, {{it was clear that}} he was gathering support, particularly among the young—a great irony, Alun Morgan observes, for a man sacked on the grounds of his age. In the final week before polling day on 18 June Davies's youthful supporters toured the constituency with songs, slogans and cheerleaders in what Griffiths describes as [...] "the most colourful election bandwaggon seen in Merthyr for 40 years". The official Labour campaign stalled, as Lloyd became embroiled in a row over his role in the failure of the AEU to support an unofficial strike at the local Hoover factory. On polling day, amid scenes of jubilation. Davies was returned with a majority of 7,467 over Lloyd. Davies responded to his victory by thanking the voters whom, he said, he had never <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> moment would let him down.

500|$|The {{day after}} the battle, Harold's body was identified, either by his armour or marks on his body. [...] His {{personal}} standard was presented to William, and later sent to the papacy. The bodies of the English dead, including some of Harold's brothers and housecarls, were left on the battlefield, although some were removed by relatives later. The Norman dead were buried in a large communal grave, {{which has not been}} found. Exact casualty figures are unknown. Of the Englishmen known to be at the battle, the number of dead implies that the death rate was about 50 per cent of those engaged, although this may be too high. Of the named Normans who fought at Hastings, one in seven is stated to have died, but these were all noblemen, and it is probable that the death rate among the common soldiers was higher. Although Orderic Vitalis's figures are highly exaggerated, his ratio of one in four casualties may be accurate. Marren speculates that perhaps 2,000 Normans and 4,000 Englishmen were killed at Hastings. Reports stated that some of the English dead were still being found on the hillside years later. Although scholars <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long time that remains would not be recoverable, due to the acidic soil, recent finds have changed this view. One skeleton that was found in a medieval cemetery, and originally was thought {{to be associated with the}} 13th century Battle of Lewes now is thought to be associated with Hastings instead.|$|E
500|$|The {{backstage}} drama {{portrayed in}} the musical was matched by actual difficulties among the cast. McCracken, who played Betty, was the wife of choreographer Bob Fosse and became pregnant during the run. Bill Hayes later wrote that she lost her baby through miscarriage {{about the same time}} she lost her husband to Gwen Verdon. The baby was in fact aborted, because the pregnancy would have endangered McCracken's health {{as a result of her}} diabetes. Hayes noted that in the fifteen months he played Larry, he did not recall ever having a conversation with Isabel Bigley, who was supposedly his love interest and wife: [...] "I doubt that the audience ever believed we were deeply in love." [...] The show received no Tony Award nominations. During the run, Hammerstein followed his usual practice of visiting the theatre now and again to ensure that the performers were not taking liberties with his book. Upon his return, Hammerstein's secretary asked him how the show was going. The lyricist <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> second, then said [...] "I hate that show." [...] According to Bill Hayes in his autobiography Like Sands Through the Hourglass published in 2005 he states We played nearly five hundred performances, however, all to full houses. Production costs were paid off and substantial profits went into the R till. So, though not in the same category as the storied five that were made into films - Oklahoma!, Carousel, South Pacific, The King and I and The Sound of Music - our show must be considered a success.|$|E

Driscoll exercised {{the need for the}} statewide expressway, citing that [...] "it is unwise to expect city streets to bear the brunt of through, truck and passenger traffic."

2500|$|Due to the sculpture's {{potential}} for controversy, {{the point that}} each country's piece was designed by an artist from that country was strongly stressed by the Czech government. According to Lidové noviny, Czech Prime Minister Alexandr Vondra remarked: [...] "The fact remains that we have provided a platform for free artistic expression {{and that is how}} Entropa must be viewed. But, had I known the circumstances were different than we had <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> year and a half, I would not have authorized it." [...] Vondra attempted to distance the Czech government from Černý's work early on, saying,It is a piece of artnothing else... If Europe is not strong enough to look at this, it would be a tragedy. It is Europe through the eyes of 27 artists. It is not Europe {{through the eyes of the}} Czech presidency.|$|E
2500|$|Fatio <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{long time}} that, since corpuscles {{approach}} material bodies {{at a higher}} speed than they recede from them (after reflection), {{there would be a}} progressive accumulation of corpuscles near material bodies (an effect which he called [...] "condensation"). However, he later realized that although the incoming corpuscles are quicker, they are spaced further apart than are the reflected corpuscles, so the inward and outward flow rates are the same. Hence there is no secular accumulation of corpuscles, i.e., the density of the reflected corpuscles remains constant (assuming that they are small enough that no noticeably greater rate of self-collision occurs near the massive body). More importantly, Fatio noted that, by increasing both the velocity and the elasticity of the corpuscles, the difference between the speeds of the incoming and reflected corpuscles (and hence the difference in densities) can be made arbitrarily small while still maintaining the same effective gravitational force.|$|E
2500|$|The third {{book was}} the one Melville {{reviewed}} for the Literary World in 1847, J.

The fourth book, Reverend Henry T. Cheever's The Whale and His Captors (1850), was used for two episodes in Moby-Dick but probably appeared too late in the writing of the novel to be of much more use. Melville did plunder a fifth book, William Scoresby, Jr., An Account of the Arctic Regions with a History and Description of the Northern Whale Fishery (1820), although the book became the standard whaling reference soon after publication, Melville satirized and parodied it on several occasions—for instance in the description of narwhales in the chapter [...] "Cetology", where he called Scoresby [...] "Charley Coffin" [...] and gave his account [...] "a humorous twist of fact": [...] "Scoresby will help out Melville several times, and on each occasion Melville will satirize him under a pseudonym." ...|$|E
