50|$|Sunscreen (also {{commonly}} known as sun screen, sunblock, suntan lotion, sunburn cream, sun cream or block out) is a lotion, spray, gel or other <b>topical</b> <b>product</b> that absorbs or reflects some of the sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation on the skin exposed to sunlight and thus helps protect against sunburn. Depending on the mode of action, sunscreens can be classified into physical sunscreens (i.e., those that reflect the sunlight) or chemical sunscreens (i.e., those that absorb the UV light).|$|E
50|$|Microdermabrasion {{has evolved}} from rocks, stones and shells to crystals, {{particle-free}} diamond tips and particle-free bristle tips. Once the desired amount of exfoliation has been reached, some microdermabrasion units will then spray or infuse a skin enhancing solution into the skin. Since microderm essentially manually removes limited layers of the stratum corneum (dead layers of the outer layer of the skin), any serum or <b>topical</b> <b>product</b> applied in any fashion to the skin following microdermabrasion will potentially have a greater opportunity for penetration into the skin.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBioequivalence (BE) {{assessment}} of <b>topical</b> dermatological <b>products</b> {{is a long}} standing challenge. The development of generic <b>topical</b> dermatological <b>products</b> has often been hampered due to {{the limited number of}} acceptable approaches, which are capable of determining the BE between generic products and reference list products. The aim of this manuscript is to review different BE assessment approaches of <b>topical</b> dermatological <b>products.</b> Besides, the advances in BE evaluation and biowaivers are also provided. Currently, except in the case of dermatological corticosteroids, the golden rule to establish the BE of most <b>topical</b> dermatological <b>products</b> still heavily relied on clinical endpoint trials, which are often unreliable, time-consuming and expensive. The regulatory agencies and pharmaceutical industries are forging ahead to the development of new surrogate BE assessment approaches for other <b>topical</b> dermatological <b>products.</b> These promising approaches include dermatopharmacokinetic study (DPK), dermal microdialysis (DMD), in vitro studies, pharmacokinetic study (PK), near-infrared spectrometry (NIR), and confocal Raman spectroscopy (CRS). In addition, the expansion of biowaivers for <b>topical</b> dermatological <b>products</b> has been explored by pharmaceutical scientists. In conclusion, to accelerate the development and approval of <b>topical</b> dermatological <b>products,</b> emphasis should be put on the following areas, i. e., optimizing and standardizing the existing BE assessment methods, exploring novel alternatives of BE assessment approaches, and expanding biowaivers for <b>topical</b> dermatological <b>products...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{manufacturer}} of each <b>topical</b> <b>product</b> has total {{control over the}} content of the base of a medication. Although containing the same active ingredients, one manufacturer's cream might be more acidic than the next, which could cause skin irritation or change its absorption rate. For example, a vaginal formulation of miconazole antifungal cream might irritate the skin less than an athlete foot formulation of miconazole cream. These variations can, on occasion, result in different clinical outcomes, even though the active ingredient is the same. No comparative potency labeling exists to ensure equal efficacy between brands of topical steroids (percentage of oil vs water dramatically affect the potency of topical steroid). Studies have confirmed that the potency of some topical steroid products may differ according to manufacturer or brand. An example of this is the case of brand name Valisone cream and Kenalog cream in clinical studies have demonstrated significantly better vasoconstrictions than some forms of this drug produced by generic drug manufacturers. However, in a simple base like an ointment, much less variation between manufacturers is common.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Many {{patients}} undergoing {{radiation treatment}} experience moist desquamation, a severe acute skin reaction. The pain, discomfort and dressing applications subsequent to moist desquamation exacerbate the distress {{associated with the}} patients' cancer diagnosis and treatment. Background: Radiation oncology nurses in a tropical area of Australia believe that moist desquamation occurs more often in patients undergoing radiation treatment in the summer months. It is surmised that this increase {{is due to a}} combination of high humidity and the consistency of the preventative cream currently recommended by the clinical staff. Method: A narrative literature review was undertaken to identify a potential alternative non-prescription <b>topical</b> <b>product,</b> readily available in Australia, to prevent moist desquamation in a tropical environment. Research literature published in a 10 -year time frame ending December 2010 was retrieved and reviewed. Main findings: Seven individual trials met our inclusion criteria. No non-prescription moisturising cream, lotion or gel that was trialled was significantly better than any other at preventing moist desquamation, and none were trialled in a tropical climate. The literature did indicate possible alternatives to the currently recommended preventative cream. Conclusion: There is no evidence to support recommending the use of any specific non-prescription <b>topical</b> <b>product</b> to prevent radiation-induced acute skin reactions. This literature review has informed a randomised controlled trial of two non-prescription creams in a tropical setting. It is anticipated that the trial will provide evidence-based preventative skin care recommendations for patients receiving radiation treatment in a tropical climate...|$|E

40|$|Background: N-palmitoylethanolamine (PEA) {{and organic}} osmolytes are {{endogenous}} {{components of the}} human epidermis and are generated from phospholipids in the stratum granulosum. PEA {{has been shown to}} exert potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The endogenous organic osmolytes such as betaine and sarcosine control skin humidity, but have also been shown to inhibit ultraviolet (UV) light-induced oxidative stress in keratinocytes. Objectives: To investigate the effect of a PEA-and organic osmolyte-containing <b>topical</b> <b>product</b> (Physiogel AI (R)) on the development of UV light-induced erythema, thymine dimer formation and p 53 tumor suppressor gene activation, as well as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM- 1) and Ki 67 expression in normal human skin. Methods: The UV-induced erythema was measured by a spectrofluorometric method. Thymine dimers, p 53, ICAM- 1 and Ki 67 were detected in skin biopsies using immunohistochemistry. Results: Physiogel AI cream significantly inhibited the development of UV light-induced erythema and thymine dimer formation in normal human skin, but did not alter the number of Ki 67 + proliferating keratinocytes and the expression of p 53 and ICAM- 1. Conclusions: Our results suggest that PEA and organic osmolytes might represent a new generation of compounds which suppress UV-induced photodamage. Copyright (c) 2007 S. Karger AG, Base...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionTaking care of {{a patient}} with an {{infected}} pressure sore necessitates a diagnosis allowing for a suitable treatment strategy. AimsTo choose the dressings and topical antimicrobial agents {{that can be used}} as of 2012 in treatment of an infected pressure sore. MethodsA systematic review of the literature with queries to the databases Pascal Biomed, PubMed and Cochrane Library from 2000 through 2010. ResultsDiagnosis of local infection is essentially clinical. It is subsequently difficult to destroy and/or permeabilize biofilm by means of mechanical wound debridement. Application of an antimicrobial product and a disinfectant solution are of utmost importance in this respect. DiscussionThe studies do not demonstrate that one <b>topical</b> <b>product</b> is better than another in wound cleaning. The papers recommending antimicrobial topics lead to the conclusion that they may be interesting, but show little clinical evidence of their beneficial effects. Dressings including silver, iodine, polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB) and negative pressure wound therapy could likewise be of interest, but once again, existing studies present only a low level of evidence (Grade C). ConclusionLocal antimicrobial treatment can be used when there are signs of local infection (Grade C). Systemic antibiotic treatment is to be used when there are general medical signs of infection (Grade B) ...|$|E
40|$|Background Skin {{hydration}} {{is defined}} as the water content of the epidermis and the dermis. In vivo reflectance confocal microscopy offers the opportunity to determine in vivo the kinetics of the skin after the application of <b>topical</b> <b>products.</b> Objective To define confocal features associated with dry skin and assess the microscopic effects of different moisturizers. Methods Ten healthy volunteers were enrolled for the study. Two different formulations were tested: petrolatum and a commercially available emulsion. Measurements were performed from baseline to 3 h after removal of the occlusion at regular time points. Nine confocal features were assessed: furrows' size, overall interkeratinocyte reflectance, furrows' morphology, scales, skin surface irregularity, non-rimmed dermal papillae, exocytosis, dermal inflammation and collagen type. Furrows' size and interkeratinocyte reflectance were also quantitated using a digital analysis. Stratum corneum capacitance was recorded. Results At baseline, RCM showed the presence of micro-scales and high skin surface irregularity score. After the application of <b>topical</b> <b>products,</b> the scale score decreased significantly; Furrow's size and Digital Furrow's Size had a marked and directly correlated decrement. Furrow's morphology and Epidermal Irregularity scores decreased from baseline to 30 min, the latter reaching a plateau in product application areas. Interestingly, interkeratinocyte reflectance progressively increased with the application of the <b>topical</b> <b>products,</b> while remained stable in the control area, confirmed by Digital Interkeratinocytes reflectance quantitation. Conclusion RCM revealed that the changes involve the skin surface by reducing the micro-scales and epidermal irregularity. Even more interestingly, RCM showed that higher interkeratinocytes' brightness is seen for moisturizer, but not for the control area. This RCM finding could be linked to keratinocyte membrane protein exposure and/or substance release in the interkeratinocytic space...|$|R
