50|$|The Nonhuman Turn {{describes}} a late 20th and 21st Century movement within the arts, humanities and social sciences, as practitioners of these disciplines {{turn away from}} the Social Constructivism of the earlier 20th Century, in favour of emergent philosophies which seek <b>to</b> <b>decenter</b> <b>the</b> human, and <b>to</b> emphasize instead the agency of the nonhuman world.

Second, they contend that a trinity of thought is discernable in Schmitt’s writings.

In particular, through academic writing (and to a lesser extent, teaching), religion in Singapore is constructed as a particular mosaic of social, cultural, and political life, socially relevant, culturally rich, spatially manifested, transnationally linked, politically delicate, and historically steeped.

40|$|The {{extensive}} and enduring commitments to nationhood within Native American Studies have unsurprisingly engendered {{in the field}} {{extensive and}} enduring resistance to transnational theoretical and methodological frameworks. This is largely because scholarly transnationalism fundamentally seeks to unmoor intellectual work from national(ist) affiliations. This, of course, directly contradicts the commitments to nationhood within Native Studies. Yet even while conventional transnational modes of critical inquiry present trajectories and objectives that threaten to undermine the core commitments of Native American Studies, the judicious use of particular aspects of conventional transnationalism {{and the development of}} innovative conceptions of transnationalism can serve the field. While conventional transnationalism seeks <b>to</b> <b>decenter</b> <b>the</b> nation in any form—and therein maintains a strict opposition between nationalism and transnationalism—the mode of indigenous transnationalism that Bauerkemper and Stark propose <b>decenters</b> <b>the</b> settler-state while recentering Native nationhood.

40|$|My {{conclusion}} {{in what follows}} is that, notwithstanding much rhetoric in the opinion, states have some room to rethink marriage in light of marriage equality. And with some intellectual jujitsu, this opening to rethink the state’s place in relational ordering gives marriage-skeptics another bite at the apple to get something they wanted all along: <b>to</b> <b>decenter</b> <b>the</b> largely religious, gendered, and bourgeois institution of marriage. Justice Kennedy’s opinion has the unfortunate result of reaffirming marriage {{at the top of}} a relational hierarchy, yet there are surely other ways we can have civil rights and equality for gay people without marriage at all. A little bit of resistance by several states might allow for movement toward an even more progressive vision of a life in love. That vision either proliferates the menu of options available to people—gay or straight—or makes a meaningful effort to secularize the primary modality of recognizing and legitimating the private choices people make about ordering their romantic and sexual lives. Ultimately, this kind of disestablishment is not some newfangled idea: the state actually was quite a latecomer into the marriage business and it is only contingently in its current role...|$|R

40|$|My {{dissertation}} examines Korean {{women who}} came to the United States for higher education before Korean independence in 1945. These Korean women became an important and influential minority {{in the construction of the}} Korean nation, the overseas independence movement, and the Korean diasporic community. In Korean historiography, which has tends to dichotomize Koreans who lived during the Japanese colonial period into patriotic nationalists and pro-Japanese collaborators, voices representing other positions have been largely silenced, including those of Korean women students in the United States. There are few previous studies on this subject. Most of the research focuses on a handful of famous figures who were independence activists or who entered the cabinet of the Republic of Korea after independence. These character-driven studies confirm established scholarship and fail to understand who these women really were and what true contributions they made. ^ This project explores what roles the existence of these women students and their American education played in connection between Korea and Korean communities in the United States, and between Korea and the United States. Although the number of Korean female students in the United States was small, analysis of their experiences has <b>the</b> potential <b>to</b> <b>decenter</b> <b>the</b> conventional meta-narratives about colonial Korea, colonialism, and nationalism, which tend to simplify religious influence, neglect class difference, dissolve gender difference, and overgeneralize the victimization of Koreans.

40|$|Influenced by a {{drive to}} seek out {{interdisciplinary}} connections within Rhetoric and Composition and to put these intersections into practice, this dissertation seeks out the ways indigenous ways of knowing, such as storytelling, can provide a heuristic to understand the ways our dappled discipline works to create community-based knowledges, and how these knowledges sustained through storytelling can recover the histories in our discipline by opening up our boundaries framed by dominant origin stories. Building {{on the work of}} decolonial and indigenous scholars, this dissertation asserts that indigenous storytelling encourages researchers to re-tool dominant methods in existing colonial structures in order to do the work of knowledge-making that more easily includes posthuman practices alongside distinctively human ones. Using the Cherokee Female Seminary during the nineteenth century as a case for this kind of methodology, storytelling uncovers and builds relationships through participatory means, contextualizing both the human and non-human agents in archival work that can work <b>to</b> <b>decenter</b> <b>the</b> discipline by using knowledge-making through storytelling as an active, balancing force. The result is revisionist history, but it’s also a returning present reality [...] the reality that these archives have always already been indigenous even in a colonized state, the reality that our research methodology need to navigate colonial structures still present, and the reality we, as scholars, must seek reflective practices that are vigilant against our own cultural ecologies. While enriching historiographic work in Rhetoric and Composition, the storytelling in this dissertation develops interdisciplinary themes in knowledge-making practices that are indigenous, rhetorical, posthuman, and ecological, and can be applied to research methodologies in professional writing, digital rhetorics, and historiography. ...|$|R

Design The study employed a small N single case-series design with an “A-B” phase methodology. Method Six individuals diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder but in a euthymic state were recruited through the MRC-CBSU in Cambridge. The {{participants were asked to}} fill out daily mood measures of symptomatology for two weeks. Following this, the SD-PB training commenced, which comprised two face-to-face sessions and one week of daily homework, during this time participants were asked to continue to fill out daily mood measures of symptomatology. Several self-report measures of affective lability, anxiety, <b>the</b> ability <b>to</b> <b>decenter</b> and <b>the</b> ability <b>to</b> perspective-take were administered at four time points during the study and at an online two-week follow-up. Results Two participants were categorised as responders in terms of their reductions in mood symptomatology. The self-report measures showed that five out of six participants showed reductions in anxiety and improvements in <b>the</b> ability <b>to</b> <b>decenter.</b> Four participants showed reductions in affective lability and three participants showed improvements in the ability to perspective-take. Pre- and post-training measures showed all participants experienced some improvements in positive thinking and reductions in negative thinking. Conclusions The results indicate the SD-PB package has potential for reducing a range of symptomatology in BD and is able to bring about more helpful thinking styles. However, due to the limitations of the study these results should be interpreted with caution and more studies are needed in the future to build confidence in the package.

40|$|In his {{discussion}} on the emergence of modern capitalism in Egypt, Timothy Mitchell (2002) highlights the roles played by non-human entities such as mosquitos and fertilizers. Thus, Mitchell argues that capitalism has no singular logic, but rather ”survives parasitically… drawing its energies from the chemistry of others” (2002 : 303). Therefore, social scientists need to take such non-human agents and materials into account when discussing the economy. Indeed, the 20 th century growth in populations and economies cannot be dissociated from the advent of anthropogenic fixation of nitrogen. (Smil, 2001) This man-made accelleration of the nitrogen cycle is sometimes used {{as an indicator of}} the rise of the Anthropocene. (Steffen et. al., 2011) This paper will explore the connection between the concept of capitalism, on the one hand, and the intensification of this ”nitrogen cascade” (Galloway & Cowling, 2002 : 67), on the other. In this endeavour, it draws upon Deleuze and Guattari's (1988) reading of Marx' Capital, which emphasises the contingent origins of capitalism, construed as that cycle of accummulation that starts at the point where free reservoirs of labor and capital start to react with each other. The text will thus relate the dramatic accummulation of reactive nitrogen (Nr) to Marx' ideas about capital accummulation. Along with ”capitalism”, the paper suggests, the economy and society is also to be understood as a ”Nr-ism”. This -ism is construed as a cycle of accummulation set off {{during the first half of}} the 20 th century, as airborne N 2 was turned into a reservoir for reactive nitrogen. This somewhat speculative analogy, it will be argued, serves <b>to</b> <b>decenter</b> <b>the</b> notion of capital in our ways of construing the economy, thus helping us orient ourselves in relation to the anthropocene...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 This {{dissertation}} {{surveys the}} status of the juvenile delinquent in U. S. cultural production through a cross disciplinary investigation of sociology, psychology, literature and film. The cultural archive of this dissertation is organized around two important legal watersheds in juvenile justice. In 1899, the first juvenile court was established in Cook County, Illinois, and ushered a wave of juvenile justice reform in courts across the nation. The culmination of early Progressive era child savers' efforts, the installation of juvenile courts marked a significant shift in the court's formal role from neutral adjudicator to a paternal administrator. The Supreme Court decision, In re Gault (1967) marks the second watershed. Within normative legal accounts, this decision is seen as "restoring" the court's impartial treatment of the juvenile based on the determination that juvenile court procedure failed to protect the juvenile's right to due process. Across these legal watersheds, this dissertation offers a genealogy of juvenile delinquency discourse that interrogates the complex network of disciplinary knowledge (including law, psychology and sociology), which simultaneously clarified and obfuscated the causal features of youth's supposed predisposition towards criminal behavior. I use a genealogical method, as theorized by Michel Foucault, to expose the limits, obfuscations, and contradictions of dominant narratives of juvenile delinquency in order to denaturalize the authority of disciplinary knowledge by examining juvenile delinquency discourse as an assembly of historical entanglements and political contestations that were critically imagined in aesthetic representations of juvenile delinquency. To this end, the chapters offer sustained readings of literary and cinematic representations of <b>the</b> juvenile delinquent <b>to</b> <b>decenter</b> <b>the</b> pathological determinacies of delinquent behavior deployed by the state and social sciences and to animate the juvenile delinquent as a constitutively porous figure that has reinforced a state technology of selective incorporation...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} that American individualism is a failed, alienating institution {{that continues to}} produce harmful effects upon {{the people of this}} country. Current rhetoric on identity and the myth of the American dream relies explicitly on Emersonian Transcendentalism which utilizes an "Other" to show who is not a representative, American man. Ralph Ellison responds to Emerson's precepts in his novel Invisible Man by showing an African-American man Unraveling his identity. In so doing, the narrator explodes American individualism by revealing the fractured selves that its inherent racism produces and the blindness of most Americans to this contradiction. Toni Morrison's novel Song of Solomon extends Ellison's work by showing that one lone individual cannot sufficiently remove the layers of identity and oppression, but that individuals must deconstruct the influences of power with the help of others. Specifically, Morrison argues that only through immersion in one's community, including language, history, and ancestry, can one find a true identity. Morrison also reclaims Emerson's philosophy by utilizing his concept of a "necessary actor" to show that this process is an active one. It is the responsibility of each member of the community to rigorously work <b>to</b> <b>decenter</b> <b>the</b> effects of power so as to rebuild their identity with the values of their community and thereby create a healthy community of whole individuals. Song of Solomon demonstrates the very nature of Morrison's argument by demanding audience participation through extensive use of the oral tradition. Written discourse is de-privileged as the author is shifted from the sole position of authority, while a new community is formed between the text and the reader. Working especially with W. E. B. DuBois' double consciousness and Homi Bhabha's subsequent extension of this concept to all neo-colonized individuals, I argue that Morrison's novel demonstrates th 3. t because we are born into systems of power, specifically American capitalistic patriarchy, our very survival demands actively re-inventing ourselves through privileging our community...|$|R
40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{offers a}} new framework through which to theorize contemporary democratic practices by attending to the political agency of unauthorized immigrants. I argue that unauthorized immigrants themselves, by claiming their own ambiguous legal condition as a legitimate basis for public speech, are able {{to open up the}} boundaries of political membership and to render the foundations of democracy contingent, that is to say, they are able to reopen the question about who counts {{as a member of the}} demos. I develop this argument by way of a close reading of Sophocles’ tragedy Antigone[1], which allows me to dramatize democracy’s vexed relation to the question of foreignness and to challenge traditional concepts of democracy, political membership and agency. My turn to the classical Greek tragedy of Antigone is doubly motivated. First, it allows me to translate the political agon (conflict) staged by unauthorized immigrants today in order to read its rival narratives of membership. It provides me with a frame by which to link the politics of burial at the borders with the public protests performed by unauthorized immigrants in the streets of Tucson and Paris. Secondly, it allows me <b>to</b> <b>decenter</b> <b>the</b> frame, <b>to</b> facilitate a new trajectory for this classical tradition against the dominant reception of Antigone as civically circumscribed to one polis. Exploring Antigone’s alternative subtext of metoikia helps me to contest the idealized construction of Athenian culture that has influenced Western European ideals. Filling the gaps in our accounts of democratic theory, this research will contribute to our understanding of the phenomenon of alienage and provide a deliberative platform through which to articulate questions surfacing from this other form of political membership. My research also provides future scholarship with a theoretical basis for a broader interrogation of political agency and opens up a different trajectory for the reception of the classical tradition and for different inter-disciplinary ways of doing political theory.

40|$|Since {{her work}} as a {{professional}} playwright in the 1670 s and 1680 s, critics have sought to equate Aphra Behn and her plays, to fix and stabilize the body of the writer and of her work. She has been marked as a prostitute, a feminist, and a masculinist hack, in each case her gender determining the value of and audience for her writing. This dissertation argues that Behn's plays [...] and Behn [...] should be read in terms of her controlling tropes and forms of performance and intrigue. Her plays and her presence use these tropes and forms <b>to</b> <b>decenter</b> <b>the</b> idea of identity and manipulate conventions of gender roles in the patriarchal Restoration theater. In doing so, she recasts and reconstitutes the structure of the patriarchal theater and economy. Chapter 1 introduces my argument and presents an overview of critical and feminist responses to Behn. I use this overview to present my own view of identity as performance, opposing such essentialist theorists as Helene Cixous. Chapter 2 develops the historical and metaphorical associations of intrigue and performance, beginning with her Preface to The Dutch Lover; in reading two of her lesser-known intrigue-comedies, The Dutch Lover and The Feign'd Curtezans, or a Night's Intrigue, I then argue that performance and intrigue challenge the conventional engendering of roles such as the rake and the courtesan. Chapter 3 expands these associations and reads her economic metaphors, as I look at Behn's most famous intrigue-comedy, The Rover, and its sequel; as well as challenging conventional roles and economic valuations, however, The Rover, Part II emphasizes the ultimate inescapability of these roles and valuations in the patriarchal theater. Chapter 4 moves to her town-comedies; I argue that Behn adapts the intrigue-form to her comedies of manners, working out the characters' struggle between convention and nature to define public and private selves. Sir Patient Fancy sets up the power that the manipulation of convention offers; The City Heiress emphasizes the limits of such manipulation; The Lucky Chance offers magic and ambiguity as new theatrical possibility to subvert convention and recast role...|$|R

Feffer applied Piaget’s concept of <b>decentering</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> cognitive maturity of social content. This study used Feffer’s Interpersonal Decentering scoring system for stories told about TAT pictures to investigate the developmental hierarchy of decentering for children and adolescents. The participants originated from the Berkeley Guidance Study, a longitudinal sample of more than 200 individuals followed for more than 60 years by the Institute of Human Development at the University of California, Berkeley. The hypotheses tested were: (1) chronological age will be positively related <b>to</b> <b>Decentering</b> as reflected in Feffer’s Interpersonal Decentering scores obtained annually between ages 10 and 13 and at 18; (2) children born into higher class homes would have higher Age 12 Decentering scores; (3) children born later in birth order will have higher Age 12 Decentering scores; (4) children whose parents were observed to have closer bonds with their children at age 21 months will have higher Age 12 Decentering scores; (5) adolescents with higher scores from <b>the</b> <b>Decentering</b> Q-sort Scale (derived from adolescent Q-sorts) will have higher Age 12 Decentering scores; and (6) participants who have higher Age 12 Decentering scores will self-report higher CPI Empathy scale scores at Age 30. A repeated measures ANOVA tested Hypothesis 1. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients tested Hypotheses 2 - 6. Age and Decentering scores were unrelated, as was birth order; social class findings were mixed. Parents’ bonds with child and Age 12 Decentering were negatively correlated (closer bonds predicted higher Decentering), as were Age 12 Decentering and Age 30 Empathy (higher early Decentering predicted lower adulthood Empathy). Girls (age 12) tended <b>to</b> <b>decenter</b> more consistently and had higher Decentering scores than boys...|$|R

The adiabatic potential surfaces emerging from {{the interaction of the}} ground state atom with the giant dipole electron posses a rich topology depending on the degree of electronic excitation. Binding energies and the vibrational motion in the energetically lowest surfaces are analyzed by means of perturbation theory and exact diagonalization techniques. The resulting molecules are truly giant with internuclear distances up to several μ m.

40|$|This {{symposium}} {{brings together}} perspectives from geography, philosophy, alternative education and {{sport and exercise}} science to consider {{a sense of place}} and agency in education beyond the classroom. Drawing on embodied perspectives <b>to</b> <b>decenter</b> <b>the</b> assumptions of the classroom as enclosure which frame much educational research (Lundie 2015). In place of the enclosure as locus of methodology, the challenges of non-formal and expansive educational settings refocus educational enquiry on the intrinsic, ipsative and intersubjective dimensions of the learner in their interactions with place, peers and nature. Introducing the research programme for Space, Place and Agency in Childhood and Education at the University of St Mark and St John, Plymouth, an interdisciplinary collaboration between the Faculty of Education and Social Science and the Faculty of Sport and Health Science, the symposium will feature speakers who cross boundaries and challenge traditional dichotomies between formal, informal and non-formal education. The symposium will focus on methodological innovations which support educational research in contexts beyond the classroom, drawing upon current research projects in European youth work, disability sport education and alternative early years provision. Paper 1 – Mark Leather: More than 'activities': using a sense of place in outdoor education Paper 2 – David Lundie: More than 'methods': ipsative and interpersonal perspectives on <b>decentering</b> <b>the</b> classroom Paper 3 – Kass Gibson: More than 'murder': ethics and hunting in New Zealand reconsidered Paper 4 – Julie Evans: More than 'play': space, agency and the classroom in early years Dr Leather’s paper presents empirical evidence from an action research project to demonstrate how a combination of formal and informal pedagogy can lead to a sociocultural and historical understanding of place and enrich the learning experience when teaching sailing. Adopting a Deweyan pedagogy of place that holistically integrated research, theory and practice (Ord & Leather 2011), students completed focus group interviews, photo elicitation and written reflections, evidencing a meaningful relationship between sociocultural history of place and the activity itself. Drawing on the sport for development movement, which engages health and civic education, informal recreation and environmental education, Kass Gibson’s paper draws on mixed method qualitative research into sport (Gibson 2012) to explore students’ relationships to the culture of hunting (Gibson 2014). Bringing together indigenous ontologies with the methodological personalism refined by colleagues in this research group (Beacom & Golder 2015), this paper explores the normative, pedagogical and sustainability implications of hunting and its place in outdoor education. Exploring the relation between the ‘offered’ curriculum and the ‘received’ curriculum in early years (Rogers & Evans 2007), Dr Evans’ paper reintroduces the concept of space and enclosure as ethnographic actor in context (Lundie 2015). Drawing on myriad autoethnographic representational strategies of the young people in the setting (Pahl 1999), Evans’ ethnography seeks to enable children’s voices to represent the physical limitations they experience. This paper reframes the Reception classroom as a ‘poverty of space’, acting upon the development and socialisation of young children...|$|R

Urban {{education}} {{is in need}} of practices that break down the hierarchical and hegemonic relations that often characterize parental involvement in U. S. schools, particularly in minoritized communities. Within the framework of communities of practice, the concept of Boundary practices (Wegner, 1998) addresses the connection or disconnection, inclusion or exclusion, between members of two or more communities. In this case, our analysis describes how some practices afford the inclusion of family members and their funds of knowledge, while others exclude them from legitimate peripheral participation (Lave & Wegner, 1991). Embedded in this analysis are the historical inequities of opportunity and unequal power relations. We underscore the key role that legitimate and peripheral access in a community plays for students’ mathematical learning and the inclusion of their families. This research uses case studies to bridge local particulars to the abstract social phenomenon of learning practices. We use ethnographic tools to collect the data and an analysis based on grounded theory to explore the emergent themes. The research takes place in a fifth-grade classroom in an urban elementary school in the southwest United States, in which ninety percent of the students are of Latino background and almost seventy percent receive free or reduced lunch. In this paper we present the boundary practices using one of the case studies developed, Yessenia and her mother, Lorena. Yessenia is a ten year old Mexican immigrant who arrived to the United States as an infant with her mother and her older sister. Our data suggest that the nature of the community of practice plays a critical role in the engagement of parents in their children’s mathematics education. In this particular case, the inclusion of Spanish, a collaborative community, and the negotiation of mathematical meanings to read the world facilitate the inclusion of parents. This case study aids us <b>to</b> <b>decenter</b> <b>the</b> notion of parental engagement and focuses on the nature and history of the community, as well as the identities of the participants. The view of learning of mathematics as participation in particular communities brings to the forefront issues of power. There is an imminent need of mathematical practices that include learning as active participation and a view of mathematics as a cultural activity that draws on the resources of members of different communities. The transformation of current oppressing structures of power within the school system requires the inclusion of those who care most for students...|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{considers the}} so-called crisis in language experienced by Germanspeaking intellectuals {{at the turn}} of the century. In particular, the dissertation thesis concentrates on Jewish writers and their attempt to understand the role translation plays in generating cultural meaning and racial identity. Authors such as Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Fritz Mauthner, Franz Kafka, and Walter Benjamin, all grappled with what they perceived as language's inability to express anything but contingent representations of empirical and social reality. This failure of language meant that one's native language was always already a translation of an unknown text from an inscrutable foreign language. Seizing upon the problematic, powerful role language plays in culturally, hegemonic formations, these authors challenged German anti-Semitism from within the material-linguistic basis of German anti-Semitism itself. At the same time, they constructed various conceptions of Jewish translations based on the impossibility of translations - a counter-hegemonic movement meant <b>to</b> <b>decenter</b> German as <b>the</b> lingua franca of culture. Concentrating on and complicating notions of the translatability of Yiddish into German and vice versa, German-speaking Jewish artists and intellectuals were able to put into question German's status as a [...] ...|$|R
