25|$|An extinct ridge {{exists in}} western Iceland, {{leading to the}} theory that the plume has shifted east with time. The oldest crust of Iceland is more than 20 million years old and was formed at an old oceanic {{spreading}} center in the western fjord (Vestfirðir) region. The westward movement of the plates and the ridge above the plume and the strong <b>thermal</b> <b>anomaly</b> of the latter caused this old spreading center to cease 15 million years ago and lead to the formation of a new one in the area of today's peninsulas Skagi and Snæfellsnes; in the latter there is still some activity {{in the form of the}} Snæfellsjökull volcano. The spreading center, and hence the main activity, have shifted eastward again 7–9 million years ago and formed the current volcanic zones in the southwest (Reykjanes, Hofsjökull) and northeast (Tjörnes). Presently, a slow decrease of the activity in the northeast takes place, while the volcanic zone in the southeast (Katla, Vatnajökull), which was initiated 3 million years ago, develops. The reorganisation of the plate boundaries in Iceland has also been attributed to microplate tectonics.|$|E

The thermal gradient of the area averages 29. 9 °C/km (32. 5 °C/km in all France), but some places show gradients reaching 36 °C/km or 22 °C/km. To characterize <b>thermal</b> <b>anomalies,</b> a three-dimensional model of the temperatures was built between the surface and 5 km depth, allowing us to elaborate sets of thermal maps and cross-sections. The newly identified temperature anomalies may reach temperature difference up to 40 °C at 3 km depth through the basin. After attempting to find correlations between <b>thermal</b> <b>anomalies</b> and large scale features (Moho depths, sediment cover thickness), it appears that fluid circulation may better explain locations, amplitudes and wavelengths of <b>thermal</b> <b>anomalies</b> along faulted zones. In fact, spatial evolution of anomalous cold/warm zones follow directions of main faulted zones. In addition, it is shown that the account of a depth-dependent permeability allows the superimposition {{of positive and negative}} <b>thermal</b> <b>anomalies.</b> Away from permeable zones, <b>thermal</b> <b>anomalies</b> should be explained by conductive processes, among which heat refraction due to thermal conductivity contrasts may be significant. In particular, anisotropy of thermal conductivity of clayey formation is shown to enable the development of <b>thermal</b> <b>anomalies</b> similar to those observed between permeable zones.

Ascending warmer fluid {{in the area of}} the positive <b>thermal</b> <b>anomalies</b> and descending colder fluid {{in the area of the}} negative <b>thermal</b> <b>anomalies</b> driven by density gradients within the faults caused insignificant (1 – 5  K) local cooling which did not lead to changes in the general temperature trend.

However, an implementation of permeable fault zones into reservoir-scale models might still be of high importance for the local temperature. Such a local significance of permeable faults was implied by the slightly decreased temperature misfit between predicted temperatures and measured values in the area of the Landshut-Neuöttinger High after the implementation of permeable faults into model 3.|$|R

Optimization strategies are presented to mitigate <b>thermal</b> <b>anomalies</b> in the BHEs field. This study shows that groundwater flow greatly improves the heat transfer but causes <b>thermal</b> <b>anomalies</b> downstream. To overcome this problem, a heat transfer model is established for multi-boreholes based on temperature field superposition and moving finite line source model (MFLS). The MFLS multi-boreholes model considers the axial effect and groundwater flow and produces results {{in agreement with the}} field tested data of a 4 × 4 boreholes field. Using a dynamic annual load pattern, the long-term performance of the 4 × 4 boreholes field is analyzed. Three dynamic diurnal cooling load models are proposed to evaluate the temperature changes in the underground. The intermittent load model could reduce the local temperature anomalies in downstream tubes. The optimization model for cooling cases for multi-BHEs is elaborated to keep the outlet temperature as low as possible and minimize the extreme temperature anomalies, and by this, ultimately improve the system performance. Furthermore, the temperature variations and <b>thermal</b> <b>anomalies</b> downstream of multi-BHEs are investigated by evaluating the arrangement optimization and load optimization.

40|$|In {{continental}} rift zones, <b>thermal</b> <b>anomalies</b> {{and enhanced}} occurence of mantle-derived fluids in groundwaters often coincide on a continental but rarely {{on the local}} scale. For areas of recent intraplate volcanism this suggests a time shift between the transport of mantle-derived volatiles and heat to the Earth’s surface. As a particularly illustrative example, we studied the central European Rhine graben, which is distinguished by extensional tectonics, high seismicity, young, Upper Tertiary volcanism, abundant mineral water springs, and a heat flow anomaly. A combination of thermal, helium isotope, and major element data of mineral waters with numerical simulations of flow and heat transport leads to a profound understanding of crustal-scale transport processes and allows {{a clear distinction between}} diffusion and flow dominated regimes. The simulations show that for a crustal-scale system the transition between these two regimes occurs within one decade of permeability (10 - 16 - 10 - 17 m 2). Flow is likely to be strongly controlled by fault systems both in the lower and upper crust. While <b>thermal</b> <b>anomalies</b> highlight fluid circulation within the upper brittle crust, mantle-derived volatiles provide information on transport phenomena from lower crustal sections. The <b>thermal</b> and hydro-chemical <b>anomalies</b> in the Upper Rhine graben are directly related to mass flow rates. Therefore lack of <b>thermal</b> <b>anomalies</b> around the Kaiserstuhl volcano suggests that mass flow rates must be very small, while positive <b>thermal</b> <b>anomalies</b> in {{the central part of the}} graben can directly be related to advection of fluids into basin sediments and to redistribution of heat within these sediments. ...|$|R
