The photographs, however, were not on the bureau and Lawrence searched the room before he found them on the bed. Then he <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> and went into the passage, which was rather dark. The lamp at the shaft was not burning, but he could see Walters beckoning at the gate.|$|E
6000|$|Not {{the first}} time she had used that curious expression! Yet her life was far from dull, so far as he could see; with the new {{interests}} created by the war, and the constant calls on her time made by the perfection of their home life, she had a useful and busy existence. Again the random thought passed through him: 'But she never tells me anything!' And suddenly that lugubrious khaki-clad figure started up among the rose bushes. [...] "We've got a lot to be thankful for!" [...] he said abruptly. [...] "I must go to work!" [...] His wife, raising one eyebrow, smiled. [...] "And I to weep!" [...] Mr. Bosengate laughed--she had a pretty wit! And stroking his comely moustache where it had been kissed, he moved out into the sunshine. All the evening, throughout his labours, not inconsiderable, for this jury business had put him behind time, he was afflicted by that restless pleasure in his surroundings; would break off in mowing the lower lawn to look at the house through the trees; would leave his study and committee papers, to cross into the drawing-room and sniff its dainty fragrance; paid a special good-night visit to the children having supper in the schoolroom; pottered in and out from his dressing room to admire his wife while she was changing for dinner; dined with his mind perpetually on the next course; talked volubly of the war; and in the billiard room afterwards, smoking the pipe which had taken the place of his cigar, could not keep still, but roamed about, now in conservatory, now in the drawing-room, where his wife and the governess were still making swabs. It seemed to him that he could not have enough of anything. About eleven o'clock he strolled out beautiful night, only just dark enough--under the new arrangement with Time--and went down to the little round fountain below the terrace. His wife was playing the piano. Mr. Bosengate looked at the water and the flat dark water lily leaves which floated there; looked up at the house, where only narrow chinks of light showed, because of the Lighting Order. The dreamy music drifted out; there was a scent of heliotrope. He moved a few steps back, and sat in the children's swing under an old lime tree. Jolly--blissful--in the warm, bloomy dark! Of all hours of the day, this before going to bed was perhaps the pleasantest. He saw the light go up in his wife's bed room, unscreened for a full minute, and thought: 'Aha! If I did my duty as a special, I should [...] "strafe" [...] her for that.' She came to the window, her figure lighted, hands up to the back of her head, so that her bare arms gleamed. Mr. Bosengate wafted her a kiss, knowing he could not be seen. 'Lucky chap!' he mused; 'she's a great joy!' Up went her arm, down came the blind the house was dark again. He drew a long breath. 'Another ten minutes,' he thought, 'then I'll go in and shut up. By Jove! The limes are beginning to smell already!' And, the better to take in that acme of his well-being, he tilted the swing, lifted his feet from the ground, and swung himself toward the scented blossoms. He wanted to whelm his senses in their perfume, and closed his eyes. But instead of the domestic vision he expected, the face of the little Welsh soldier, hare-eyed, shadowy, pinched and dark and pitiful, started up with such disturbing vividness that he opened his eyes again at once. Curse! The fellow almost haunted one! Where would he be now poor little devil!--lying in his cell, thinking--thinking of his wife! Feeling suddenly morbid, Mr. Bosengate arrested the swing and stood up. Absurd!--all his well-being and mood of warm anticipation had deserted him! 'A d---d world!' he thought. 'Such a lot of misery! Why should I have to sit in judgment on that poor beggar, and condemn him?' He moved up on to the terrace and walked briskly, to rid himself of this disturbance before going in. 'That commercial traveller chap,' he thought, 'the rest of those fellows--they see nothing!' And, abruptly turning up the three stone steps, he entered the conservatory, locked it, passed into the billiard room, and drank his barley water. One of the pictures was hanging crooked; he went up to put it straight. Still life. Grapes and apples, and--lobsters! They struck him as odd for {{the first time}}. Why lobsters? The whole picture seemed dead and oily. He <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>light,</b> and went upstairs, passed his wife's door, into his own room, and undressed. Clothed in his pyjamas he opened the door between the rooms. By the light coming from his own he could see her dark head on the pillow. Was she asleep? No--not asleep, certainly. The moment of fruition had come; the crowning of his pride and pleasure in his home. But he continued to stand there. He had suddenly no pride, no pleasure, no desire; nothing but a sort of dull resentment against everything. He turned back; shut the door, and slipping between the heavy curtains and his open window, stood looking out at the night. 'Full of misery!' he thought. 'Full of d---d misery!' ...|$|E

50|$|The patron {{could control}} the {{presentation}} speed {{only to a}} limited degree. The crank could be turned in both directions, but this did not reverse the playing of the reel. Nor could the patron extend viewing time by stopping the crank because the flexible images were bent into the proper viewing position by tension applied from forward cranking. Stopping the crank reduced the forward tension on the reels causing the reel to go backwards and the picture {{to move from the}} viewing position; a spring in the mechanism <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> and in some models brought down a shutter which completely blocked out the picture.|$|E

According to Twins public relations director Tom Mee, LaRoche [...] "complained about everything. In fact, they filed a grievance about the choice of ice cream we had in the clubhouse. He loved to agitate, and it was not right." [...] According to Rod Carew, [...] "He was always negative about everything in the locker room. I finally got tired of it one night...we were having a team meeting and he was constantly interrupting people. I said to him, 'Just shut up and listen to what the guys have to say.' He asked what I was going to do about it, so I challenged him to a fight. There was a broom closet {{in the back of the}} clubhouse. I opened its door, turned on the light and said, 'Come on, let's go in.' As soon as he walked in, I <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>light,</b> closed the door and whaled away at him." [...] According to Twins teammate Bert Blyleven, [...] "A reporter asked him why he wanted to be player rep and Dave said, 'Because all the player reps under Calvin Griffith get traded.'" ...|$|E
40|$|Performance of a {{secondary}} task, {{such as a}} cell phone conversation, may change attention to an automobile driving task. In this study, MEG imaging was applied to an automobile driving simulation paradigm to identify the cortical regions engaged in the primary driving task. Subjects viewed a driving video and responded (foot pedal) to red light stimuli (events) presented either centrally or peripherally in the driving scene. Cortical activation was imaged from MEG data averaged on the foot pedal response. MEG temporal resolution enabled the determination of sequential cortical activations. Orbital frontal gyrus activation was observed throughout the interval. Red light onset evoked occipital cortex activity {{that was followed by}} activation in the superior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate gyrus. Peaks of motor and pre-motor cortex activation were detected during eye fixation movements (light on), and motor activity in the precentral gyrus preceding foot and leg activation of the pedal response pad. This action <b>turned</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> and produced a visual evoked response in the occipital cortex. Occipital activation occurred when the light was turned off with the pedal response. These were brief intervals and correlated with known locations for visual and specific motor cortex locations. Frontal activation was dominant throughout this driving task with prominent peaks associated with the red light onset and the pedal push. Our findings suggest driving tasks recruit neural systems known to be involved in visual-motor multimodal processing and integration. The use of eventrelated MEG in investigating neural processing during simulated driving tasks is quite promising...|$|E

40|$|This work is {{porcelain}} tableware {{and architectural}} ornament. I choose {{the context of}} function because the things we use contain purpose both actual and metaphorical. They are concrete, connected to our lives by necessity, regardless of meaning or aesthetics. Form and surface are more than the residue of concept, they must be specifically engineered for right application. This work, be it shelter, ligbt, containment, etc. is {{the foundation for the}} intimacy we feel toward our belongings. That said, utility is only one facet of the objects I make. A Styrofoam cup works well enough, but its expressive potential is limited. The living environment is comprised of a million details taken for granted, and more often than not objects of use fall into this category. I made this work because I believe that the everyday does have the power to move us. The starting point of my visual content is materiality. Clay is completely malleable; it records the most delicate touch with minute precision. This kind of sensitivity allows me to work physically, recording kinetic energy to be frozen in tbe firing. If my mark can properly express the vulnerability of wet clay that memory of softness will remain in the vitreous product. This transfonnation sets up a series of interesting dichotomies: Direct, aggressive touch thinly cast contrasts frailty with vigor. The finished piece is hard but tbere is evidence of softness, once in motion, now stillness. Another material attribute specific to porcelain is translucency; thin porcelain transmits light like alabaster. When <b>turned</b> <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> fixtures appear to be heavy and massive. They become weightless when lit. These contradictions make the work seem awkward, just enough to make the viewer curious. I have always been drawn toward abstract pattern. To generate original sets I stripped away everything but process and materials and considered them conceptually. Fingerprints are the result of organic growth, a universal symbol of individuality; fingers also happen to be my tools. The shape and number of the chandelier scales {{is the result of a}} desire to achieve delicacy in a single mass. Casting is dependent on inversion and this gave me the opportunity to eliminate visual thickness thereby achieving the illusion of transparency in a solid field. I 2 ̆ 7 ve tried to fashion my process around patterns of change in the natural world where form and surface are the consequence of process and purpose. By deconstructing nature 2 ̆ 7 s algorithms of growth and decay I was able to access the key to repetition without sterility. Evolution is simply subtle variance in series. Order underlies all things, tension results in the breakdown; the anomaly is the heart of the pattern. My work is based on facilitating the natural beauty of the materials and the expressive potential of my process within the context of function. I believe this strategy brings my work nearer to the moment when the machinations of my mind disappear and all that 2 ̆ 7 s left is the thing itself; elegant, visceral, enough. Confronted with the futility of perfect understanding I focus on the details: a sensitive mark, a fortuitous drip, or simply a beautiful cup...|$|E
