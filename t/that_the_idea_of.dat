5|$|Smyers (1999) notes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the fox as seductress and the {{connection}} of the fox myths to Buddhism were introduced into Japanese folklore through similar Chinese stories, but she maintains that some fox stories contain elements unique to Japan.|$|E
5|$|Consequences of this {{include the}} time–space frame of a moving body {{appearing}} {{to slow down}} and contract (in the direction of motion) when measured in the frame of the observer. This paper also argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a luminiferous aether—one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time—was superfluous.|$|E
5|$|Hergé's {{depiction}} {{of the country was}} also influenced by American cinema, and many of his illustrations were based on cinematic imagery. Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier thought that Tintin's arrest of Smiles had been influenced by the Buffalo Bill stories, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the gangsters taking Tintin away in their car came from Little Caesar.|$|E

50|$|In these formulations, it {{is common}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> {{behaviors}} and events are combined into signals that always have a current value, but change discretely.|$|R
5|$|Several {{branches}} of creationism, including creation science, neo-creationism, and intelligent design, argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> life being directly {{designed by a}} god or intelligence {{is at least as}} scientific as evolutionary theory, and should therefore be taught in public education. Such arguments against evolution have become widespread and include objections to evolution's evidence, methodology, plausibility, morality, and scientific acceptance. The scientific community does not recognize such objections as valid, pointing to detractors' misinterpretations of such things as the scientific method, evidence, and basic physical laws.|$|E
5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) has {{everyone}} stay late {{to cover}} for their co-workers in Florida, which turns into an awkward situation when Val's (Ameenah Kaplan) boyfriend, Brandon (Jerry Minor), arrives and accuses Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) of {{having an affair with}} her, after having read Darryl's text messages to her. Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) demands that Darryl read them aloud out of voyeuristic interest. Upon hearing them, most of the staff agree that his text messages, particularly an extended ellipsis at the end of one, are suggestive of Darryl wanting to be with Val. Val protests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> her being romantically involved with Darryl is ridiculous. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) suggests that he try a bold step, saying that if Jim had not made romantic advances while she was still engaged to Roy, she never would have ended up marrying him. Darryl follows her advice and tells Val that a potential relationship is not ridiculous.|$|E
5|$|Another {{idea was}} the use of split screens, which was born out of the number of phone calls there were, and because of the element of real time, was used to trace {{parallel}} adventures of different characters, and aid in the connecting of characters. It was used by producers to point the audience to where to pay attention, as secondary stories often take place outside of the main plot. The idea of using boxes came later, which made shooting more flexible, as the shot could be cropped and reshaped inside the box. It was from here <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> using split screens as an artistic element came into the series.|$|E

25|$|Isaeva states <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> Ajivika {{influenced}} Buddhism {{and various}} schools of Hinduism. Riepe states {{an example of}} an influential Ajivika theory was its theory on atomism. Basham suggests Ajivikas may have possibly influenced the medieval era doctrines of Dvaita Vedanta sub-school of Hinduism.|$|R
50|$|The role call of old {{students}} who have passed through the school attests <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> founding fathers have not been in vain.

5|$|Hilda Ellis Davidson counts Þorgerðr and Irpa as {{examples}} of guardian goddesses in Germanic paganism, and compares their roles {{to that of the}} dísir and valkyries. Davidson says that if Helgi is the mythical founder of Hålogaland, it would explain Þorgerðr's last name ("bride of Helgi") and that, subsequently, she would be the wife of each ruler of the kingdom in turn. Substantially the same argument has been advanced by McKinnell. Davidson compares this role to accounts of kings or leaders being granted entry into Valhalla in the Viking Age, <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a guardian goddess welcoming kings was essentially an aristocratic concept, and that a tradition such as this could explain noble valkyries welcoming dead kings into the after life, using the poem Hákonarmál as an example.|$|E
5|$|Hume also {{suggested}} that, {{as we have}} no abstract idea of existence (apart from {{as part of our}} ideas of other objects), we cannot claim <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> God implies his existence. He suggested that any conception of God we may have, we can conceive either of existing or of not existing. He believed that existence is not a quality (or perfection), so a completely perfect being need not exist. Thus, he claimed {{that it is not a}} contradiction to deny God's existence. Although this criticism is directed against a cosmological argument, similar to that of Samuel Clarke in his first Boyle Lecture, it has been applied to ontological arguments as well.|$|E
5|$|I Am... World Tour is a live DVD/CD concert {{film and}} live album by American R {{recording}} artist Beyoncé. Beyoncé produced, directed, and edited the concert film {{for her own}} production company Parkwood Pictures. The DVD was filmed {{in the presence of}} more than a million fans during her worldwide I Am... World Tour, running from March 2009 through February 2010, in support of her third studio album, I Am... Sasha Fierce (2008). The DVD release is a combination of performances from the tour, including guest appearances from Jay-Z and Kanye West, as well as backstage moments. Beyoncé explained <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> filming her worldwide performances came when she realized that she was feeling lonely. She edited the DVD for nine months and it serves as her directorial debut.|$|E
50|$|In {{his book}} Biblical <b>Ideas</b> <b>of</b> Nationality: Ancient and Modern, Grosby argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> modern {{nationhood}} were already {{present in the}} Ancient Near East in places like Armenia, Edom, Egypt, and especially Biblical Israel, which later became the major model for European nation formation.|$|R
50|$|Unusually for a {{landscape}} {{garden in the}} English style, {{there is a lack}} of temples, ruins or chinoiserie. Perhaps this difference can be explained by <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> landscape garden designer Humphry Repton were followed, and he refrained from including such follies.|$|R
50|$|The {{last chapter}} reviews the {{argument}} and concludes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Council of Nicea could have ended very differently and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>ideas</b> <b>of</b> consubstantiality and <b>the</b> equality of Jesus with God {{did not occur}} before then. It hopes that a new reformation will re-establish the charismatic message of Jesus.|$|R
5|$|In late 1971, John Dean, the White House Counsel, {{pushed to}} expand the {{existing}} intelligence program ahead of the 1972 re-election campaign. Dean delegated the task to Jack Caulfield, {{a member of his}} staff who was a former New York police officer. According to Dean, Caulfield himself was interested in work outside of politics; he intended to create a private security company, and felt that if the Nixon cabinet were an early client, it would lead to lucrative future clients within the private sector. Fred Emery, a journalist for The Times and BBC, refutes this, claiming in his book Watergate: The Corruption & Fall of Richard Nixon <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> a private sector security firm was simply a front for a committed campaign of surveillance working Nixon and the Republican Party, with political donations to the re-election campaign able to be diverted through the company as though they were unrelated transactions.|$|E
5|$|It is {{probable}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> annulment (not divorce as commonly assumed) had suggested itself to Henry {{much earlier than}} this and was motivated by his desire for an heir to secure the Tudor claim to the crown. Before Henry's father Henry VII ascended the throne, England was beset by civil warfare over rival claims to the crown and Henry wanted to avoid a similar uncertainty over the succession. He and Catherine had no living sons: all Catherine's children except Mary died in infancy. Catherine of Aragon had first come to England to be bride to Henry's brother Arthur who died soon after their marriage. Since Spain and England still wanted an alliance, a dispensation was granted by Pope Julius II {{on the grounds that}} Catherine was still a virgin.|$|E
5|$|The {{designers}} {{thought that}} Link's appearance should change when Link entered {{a wall and}} the perspective switched from a top-down view to side view. They chose to make Link a mural {{while he was on}} a wall; this {{led to the creation of}} Yuga, the game's antagonist, a sorcerer that can transform himself and others into paintings. Aonuma mentioned <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Link turning into a mural was inspired by Phantom Ganon jumping into paintings during his encounter in Ocarina of Time. As the game's story takes place long after the events of a A Link to the Past and the player travels between the two worlds of Hyrule and Lorule, the development team chose A Link Between Worlds instead of A Link to the Past 2 for the game's English-language title.|$|E

5|$|Final Destination 3 was {{originally}} {{the last part}} of a trilogy and had been in development since the release of Final Destination 2. Jeffrey Reddick, creator of the franchise and one of the co-writers of the first two films, did not return for the third installment. According to director James Wong, unlike the second film, which was closely tied to the first, Final Destination 3 was envisioned as a stand-alone sequel featuring new characters from the beginning, stating:e really felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> Final Destination, or the fact that Death can visit you and you can cheat death, that that could happen to anyone. And so we wanted to divorce from the first film character wise. We didn't want to follow that same thread. Part of the difficulty in that is when a character understands what happened to them before; it's a whole different way in which they react to what's happening now. We felt the franchise could exist with a new group of people, instead of following those older characters all the way through. We wanted to see if this could work.|$|E
5|$|Other, {{more recent}} studies suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> object {{permanence}} {{may not be}} an innate function of young children. While, in reference to Piaget's theory, it has been established that young children develop object permanence as they age, the question arises: does this occur because of a particular perception that already existed within the minds of these young children? Is object permanence really an inbred response to the neural pathways developing in young minds? Studies suggest that a multitude of variables may be responsible for the development of object permanence rather than a natural talent of infants. Evidence suggests that infants use a variety of cues while studying an object and their perception of the object's permanence can be tested without physically hiding the object. Rather, the object is occluded, slightly obstructed, from the infants view and they are left only other visual cues, such as examining the object from different trajectories. It was also found that the longer an infant focuses on an object may be due to detected discontinuities in their visual field, or the flow of events, with which the infant has become familiar.|$|E
5|$|Realizing {{the need}} for new leadership, in {{what became known as the}} Polish October, the Politburo chose Gomułka, who had been {{released}} from prison and reinstated in the party, and the Central Committee's 8th Plenum elected him without a Soviet approval the new first secretary of the PZPR. Subsequently, Gomułka convinced the Soviet leaders that he would preserve the Soviet influence in Poland. Gomułka's elevation was preceded by ominous Soviet military moves and an arrival of Soviet high-level delegation led by Khrushchev, which flew into Warsaw to witness and influence the upheaval in the Polish party. After the sometimes confrontational encounters and negotiations, they soon returned to Moscow, where the Soviet leader announced on 21 October <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> an armed intervention in Poland should be abandoned. This position was soon reinforced by the pressure from communist China, which expressed its great power aspirations and demanded that the Soviets leave the new Polish leadership alone. On 21 October in Warsaw Gomułka's return to power was accomplished, giving rise to the era of national communism in Poland. Gomułka pledged to dismantle Stalinism and in his acceptance speech raised numerous social democratic-sounding reformist ideas, giving hope to the left-wing revisionists and others in Polish society that the communist state was, after all, reformable. The revisionists replaced and claimed to represent the worker movement, recently defeated in Poznań. The main goals in pursuit of which they engaged were political freedom and self-management in state enterprises. However, the end of Soviet influence in Eastern Europe was nowhere in sight. On 14 May 1955, the Warsaw Pact was signed in the Polish capital, to counteract the earlier establishment of NATO.|$|E
5000|$|Francisco Pi y Margall was {{claimed by}} the Spanish anarchists of his time.
