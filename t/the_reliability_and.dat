5|$|By 1976, a twinjet layout, {{similar to}} the one which had debuted on the Airbus A300, became the {{baseline}} configuration. The decision to use two engines reflected increased industry confidence in <b>the</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>and</b> economics of new-generation jet powerplants. While airline requirements for new wide-body aircraft remained ambiguous, the 7X7 was generally focused on mid-size, high-density markets. As such, it was intended to transport large numbers of passengers between major cities. Advancements in civil aerospace technology, including high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines, new flight deck systems, aerodynamic improvements, and lighter construction materials were to be applied to the 7X7. Many of these features were also included in a parallel development effort for a new mid-size narrow-body airliner, code-named 7N7, which would become the 757. Work on both proposals proceeded through the airline industry upturn in the late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{struggles in}} the Test arena, Brown had {{success in the}} tour matches as an opener. He scored 1,448 runs at 57.92 in all {{first-class}} matches, ranking fourth in both the aggregates and averages. He scored eight centuries, second only to Bradman, including 200 against Cambridge University. However, Brown gained criticism for his slow batting. Following his omission from the Test team, Brown batted in a highly circumspect manner to increase <b>the</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>and</b> volume of his scoring. A very occasional off spin bowler, Brown took his career first-class best of 4/16 in his only stint with the ball, against the South of England.|$|E
5|$|The mid- to late 1970s saw the {{introduction}} of what are usually referred to as red dot sights, a type that gives the user a simple bright red dot as an aiming point. The typical configuration for this sight is a compact curved mirror reflector design with a red light-emitting diode (LED) at its focus. Using an LED as a reticle is an innovation that greatly improves <b>the</b> <b>reliability</b> <b>and</b> general usefulness of the sight: {{there is no need}} for other optical elements to focus light behind a reticle; the mirror can use a dichroic coating to reflect just the red spectrum, passing through most other light; and the LED itself is solid state and consumes very little power, allowing battery-powered sights to run for hundreds and even tens of thousands of hours.|$|E

A repeated-measures analysis of variance tested for significant differences between the six tes-ters for all equipment, and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated to deter-mine <b>the</b> inter-rater <b>reliabilities</b> <b>and</b> intra-rater <b>reliabilities.</b> <b>The</b> ICCs for <b>the</b> <b>reliability</b> between <b>the</b> six testers ranged between 0. 77 and 0. 87 for the Clegg hammer, ranged between 0. 55 and 0. 73 for the penetrometer, and equalled 0. 51 for the studded-boot apparatus. <b>The</b> inter-rater <b>reliabilities</b> <b>and</b> intra-rater <b>reliabilities</b> were greater for the experienced testers than for the novice testers for the Clegg hammer and penetrometer but the novice testers produced greater inter-rater <b>reliabilities</b> for <b>the</b> studded-boot apparatus.
