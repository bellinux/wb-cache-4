50|$|The Aller Leine Valley has {{numerous}} {{trails and}} is popular with walkers and cyclists. Some of its waterways are navigable by canoes and rowing boats or the so-called Shuttle-Bike-Kit. There are also facilities for hot-air ballooning and <b>tandem</b> <b>parachuting.</b> Places of interest include mills, castles, old churches, abbeys and timber-framed houses. Several villages offer horse-and-carriage rides through the local heathland, moors and woods.|$|R
50|$|This element {{consists}} of six {{soldiers who were}} selected {{from the ranks of}} the demonstration teams and all are specially trained in <b>tandem</b> <b>parachuting</b> and accelerated freefall parachuting techniques, as well as freefall photography. The Golden Knights have had the honor of jumping with numerous celebrities and heads of state, most notably President George H.W. Bush, in 2007, 2012, and 2014.|$|R

25|$|The {{spectacular}} scenery of Central Otago {{makes the}} upper Clutha a popular holiday destination, especially for adventure tourism. Jetboating, kayaking, rafting, riverboarding, and guided fishing occurs on the river, and waterskiing, <b>tandem</b> <b>parachuting</b> and parapenting operators are {{all to be}} found in the area. The upper Clutha is also used for multi-sports events, and Lake Dunstan is an important rowing venue. Several major ski courses are found close to the river. Curling is also played close to the Clutha in the harsh Central Otago winters.|$|R
5000|$|Costs in {{the sport}} are not trivial. As new {{technological}} advances or performance enhancements are introduced, equipment tends to increase in price. Similarly, the average skydiver carries more equipment than in earlier years, with safety devices (such as an AAD) contributing to {{a significant portion of}} the cost. A full set of brand-new equipment can easily cost as much as a new motorcycle or half a small car. The market is not large enough to permit the steady lowering of prices that is seen with some other equipment like computers.A new main canopy for the experienced parachutist can cost between $2,000 and $3,000 US [...] Higher performance and <b>Tandem</b> <b>Parachutes</b> cost significantly more, whilst large docile student parachutes often cost less.|$|R
50|$|Tandem skydiving or <b>tandem</b> <b>parachuting</b> {{refers to}} a type of skydiving where a student skydiver is {{connected}} to a harness attached to a tandem instructor. The instructor guides the student through the whole jump from exit through freefall, piloting the canopy, and landing. The student needs only minimal instruction before making a tandem jump with the instructor. In the United States most skydiving centers and clubs require that you be 18 years or older to skydive whereas in other countries the minimum age can be lower or higher. As part of the Tandem Accelerated Freefall program, {{this is one of}} three commonly used training methods for beginning skydivers; the others being static line and Accelerated Freefall (known as Progressive Freefall in Canada).|$|R

40|$|Research was {{undertaken}} {{to examine the}} implementation requirements of a proposed rule, NZCAR Part 115,which has been developed with the intention to regulate “adventure aviation” activities in New Zealand. The regulation applies {{to a wide range}} of tourism focused airborne operations including the use of ex-military and aerobatic aircraft for joyriding, passenger flights in balloons, gliders, <b>tandem</b> <b>parachuting</b> and hang-gliding operations. The rule was considered necessary as there has been a lack of any recognized safety standards applicable to these activities when they are conducted beyond a purely recreational purpose. An increasing number of operators commercialise their activities by focusing on taking passengers for rides as opposed to conducting training or “trial flights” (which are assumed to be for the purpose of introducing people to the sport). Many of these operations use non-certified aircraft which have not been intended for the carriage passengers on a commercial scale. Where paying passengers are carried, safety is assumed to require a greater level of management. The regulator – the New Zealand Civil Aviation Authority - considers that a formal system that applies standards similar to those of small airline would be more appropriate. A new rule was required due to the novel and diverse nature of activities, and the various types of aircraft used. Specialist legislation for adventure aviation would also open up the sector for further commercial opportunities and would provide the ability to regulate such activities within the civil aviation system. The thesis includes a review of literature which examines the basis of the legislatory requirements and defines the rationale for the rule-making standard, as well as introducing notions for defining and assessing risk within aviation. The review also looks at published industry reaction to the development of the Rule. A part of the research, the survey of operators, elicits their opinion as to the workability of the new legislation. The survey also tests the current level of each operator’s compliance according to a 72 point checklist of operational items and ascertains what modifications to the systems and practices are required in order to comply. The research outcomes identified two groups of operators - one of which has standards and systems that are close to compliance with the new legislation and the other for which compliance would be difficult due to deficient systems and practices. Analysis of the differences highlighted a cultural separation of the groups in terms of their connection with mainstream general aviation and their understanding of the risk management concepts and practices required for commercial operations. The discussion of the results of the research highlights problems with the application of the proposed regulation, particularly to the non-compliant group. Issues include the recreational origins of the sector, a lack of acceptance of the Rule by operators, and on-going problems with the consultation and collaboration in the rule-development process. Workable compliance strategies and processes are discussed, including developing an ecological approach to managing safety as part of best practice. Recommendations look at possible strategies for implementation including the requirement for more pro-active education and enculturation processes, and the formation of a national representative bod...|$|R
5000|$|The 24 {{demonstrator}} {{positions on}} the team are typically held {{for at least three}} consecutive years. At the end of their tenure, soldiers then either rotate back to Army line units or they may request to stay with the team for an additional period in one of several specialty positions. These positions are usually reserved for <b>tandem</b> <b>parachute</b> instructors, videographers, team leaders, and competition parachutists.|$|E

50|$|Parachute Jumping: After {{meeting for}} the first time at Melbournes Essendon Airport and {{learning}} that one among them was the Mole, the players were presented with the challenge of flying to Tasmania and landing before the plane did - by <b>tandem</b> <b>parachute</b> jumping. If all ten of them jumped, the group would win $10,000. Several of them were nervous, particularly Josephine and James, but all ten jumped and the money was won.|$|E
50|$|On March 24, 2013 an Open Day {{was held}} at the new Henri Alwies Airfield with {{multiple}} planes from Zorg en Hoop Airport together with a demonstration from Skydive Free 2 Fly Suriname jumping parachutes from a privately owned Britten-Norman BN-2 Islander (N26NB). Surinamese Minister Of Sport & Youth, Ismanto Adna, also participated with a <b>tandem</b> <b>parachute</b> jump. A nice crop dusting demonstration was performed by pilot Martin Veldkamp with a Grumman G-164B Ag-Cat B (PZ-USB) from ERK Farms.|$|E

5000|$|The caves {{were first}} reached by Charles Brewer-Carías and David Nott in 1970 when they {{landed on the}} summit by {{helicopter}} and descended using ropes and a caving ladder. It was first climbed by Stephen Platt, David Nott, Wilmur Perez and Carlos Reyes in 1974 via the 2000 ft North Ridge. The ascent took three days and the party spent four days mapping the caves before descending by abseil. A team of skydivers and film-makers made <b>tandem</b> <b>parachute</b> jumps onto the summit in 1985, producing a documentary called [...] "Skydive to Autana".|$|E
50|$|Relative Parachute: At dinner {{after the}} dam assignment, the host played a {{recording}} of various {{friends and family members}} of the players in an airplane, and asked them to predict whether theyd <b>tandem</b> <b>parachute</b> jump (just as all of them but Shaun had earlier in the season) or not. Each correct prediction won $10,000 for the group kitty, while each incorrect prediction took $10,000 away. The men all got their predictions right, but the women were both wrong, putting the group $10,000 ahead for the assignment. After the assignment, the players were reunited with their friends and family through breakfast the next day.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{countries}} have varying laws or regulations regarding who may skydive with a passenger or student. In the United States, the FAA requires every potential instructor {{to have at}} least 3 years of experience skydiving, 500 skydives, and a master parachute license issued by an FAA-recognized organization (for the United States Parachute Association, this is equivalent to a D license). Instructors are also required to pass a certification course given by the manufacturer of the <b>tandem</b> <b>parachute</b> system to be jumped. [...] The USPA also requires potential instructors to possess a current FAA Class III Medical Certificate, and complete a USPA Tandem Instructor Rating Course.|$|E
50|$|Extreme Challenges: One by one, {{the players}} each {{received}} a harrowing or physically difficult challenge, chosen at random: Liz {{had to do}} a <b>tandem</b> <b>parachute</b> jump from a height of 5 kilometers, Craig had to bungee jump from a height of 134 meters (three times the height of the bungee jump that took place earlier in the season), and John had to spend half an hour as a passenger in a stunt plane doing aerial acrobatics without vomiting. As each prepared for their task, the twist was revealed - $25,000 would only be won if exactly two of them, no more and no less, went through with their challenges. All three ended up speculating that someone else would back out and went through with their challenges themselves, so no money was won.|$|E
50|$|Tandem skydiving {{requires}} equipment {{with several}} differences from normal sport skydiving rigs. All modern tandem skydiving systems use a drogue parachute, which is deployed shortly {{after leaving the}} plane in order to decrease the skydivers' terminal velocity. This is necessary for proper parachute deployment, lengthening {{the duration of the}} skydive, and allowing the skydivers to fall at the same speed as videographers. Tandem skydiving systems also use larger main parachutes (360 square feet and larger) to support the additional weight of two passengers. The FAA requires <b>tandem</b> <b>parachute</b> rigs to be equipped with a main and reserve parachute, as well as an automatic activation device (AAD), a safety device that automatically deploys the reserve parachute if it detects that the skydivers are still at freefall speed below a certain altitude.|$|E
