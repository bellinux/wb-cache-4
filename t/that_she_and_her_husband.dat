She created innovative designs to make her manikins lifelike, promoting her work by publishing books and teaching puppetry theory and design. She {{and her husband are}} known as the first couple of Russian puppetry, though she was the one determined to elevate the craft.

They would also travel to the Swiss village of Neuchâtel, to visit the family of her daughter's governess. Contradicting her vow of eternal anonymity, she suggested a meeting. Balzac agreed immediately, and began to make preparations for the journey. Also, sometime in 1833, Balzac wrote his first confession of love to her, despite being {{at that time in}} another relationship.|$|E

25|$|Sometime in the 1560s, her {{relationship}} with her former guardian may have cooled when Giulia insisted that she be treated as an equal to Cosimo I's mistress, who was regarded with general disdain at court.

In 1999 Geva released a film containing testimonies of 13 survivors <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> Dan had managed to track down from the list in Sefer Hebron ("The Book of Hebron"). Originally intended to document the story of the Arab who had saved Geva's mother from other Arabs, it became also an account of the atrocities of the massacre itself. These survivors, most of whom no longer live in Israel, are mixed as to whether they can forgive.|$|E
25|$|Mrs Patmore's {{decision}} to invest her inheritance {{in real estate}} inspires Carson, Downton's butler, to do likewise. He suggests that head housekeeper Mrs Hughes invest with him; she confesses she has no money due to supporting a mentally incapacitated sister. The Crawleys' cousin, Lady Rose, daughter of Lord and Lady Flintshire, becomes engaged to Atticus Aldridge, son of Lord and Lady Sinderby. Lord Sinderby strongly objects to Atticus' marrying outside the Jewish faith. Lord Merton proposes to Isobel Crawley (Matthew's mother). She accepts, but later ends the engagement due to Lord Merton's sons' disparaging comments over her commoner background. Lady Flintshire employs underhanded schemes to derail Rose and Atticus's engagement, including announcing to everyone at the wedding <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> are divorcing, intending to cause a scandal to stop Rose's marriage to Atticus; they are married anyway.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} his {{convalescence}} Childers {{returned to}} Molly at the Chelsea flat, but a month later he received an invitation to meet the Sinn Féin leadership in Dublin. Anticipating an offer of a major rôle, Childers hurried to Dublin but, apart from Collins, he found the Irish leadership wary, or even hostile. Arthur Griffith, in particular, looked on him as at best a renegade and traitor to Britain, or at worst as a British spy. He was appointed to join the Irish delegation from the as-yet-unrecognised Irish State to the Paris Peace Conference. This unpromising undertaking, as Childers saw it, was intended to advance the cause of Irish self-rule by reminding official representatives at the conference of the ideals of freedom over which Britain had gone to war. In this they were unsuccessful, and Childers returned once again to London. He rented a house in Dublin, but Molly was reluctant to join him: mindful of her sons' education, and believing <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> could best serve the cause by influencing opinion in London. She gave up their London home of fifteen years to settle in Dublin, at the end of 1919.|$|E
25|$|Blanchett {{is married}} to playwright and screenwriter Andrew Upton. They met in 1996 {{on the set of}} a TV show and were married on 29 December 1997. Blanchett and Upton have four children: {{biological}} sons Dashiell John (b. December 2001), Roman Robert (b. April 2004), and Ignatius Martin (b. April 2008), and adopted daughter Edith Vivian Patricia, whose adoption was confirmed in March 2015. Blanchett said <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> had been wanting to adopt ever since the birth of their first child. After making Brighton, England their main family home for nearly 10 years, she and her husband returned to their native Australia in 2006. In November 2006, Blanchett attributed this move to desires to select a permanent home for her children, to be closer to her family, and {{to have a sense of}} belonging to the Australian theatrical community. She and her family lived in the Sydney suburb of Hunters Hill. Their Hunters Hill residence underwent extensive renovations in 2007 to be made more eco-friendly. Following the sale of their property there in late 2015, Blanchett and Upton purchased a house in East Sussex, England in early 2016.|$|E
25|$|Home, however, was {{not easily}} reached. Louis and Eleanor, on {{separate}} ships {{due to their}} disagreements, were first attacked in May 1149 by Byzantine ships attempting to capture both on the orders of the Byzantine Emperor. Although they escaped this attempt unharmed, stormy weather drove Eleanor's ship far to the south to the Barbary Coast and caused her to lose track of her husband. Neither was heard of for over two months. In mid-July, Eleanor's ship finally reached Palermo in Sicily, where she discovered <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>husband</b> had both been given up for dead. She was given shelter and food by servants of King Roger II of Sicily, until the king eventually reached Calabria, and she set out to meet him there. Later, at King Roger's court in Potenza, she learned {{of the death of}} her uncle Raymond, who had been beheaded by Muslim forces in the Holy Land. This news appears to have forced a change of plans, for instead of returning to France from Marseilles, they went to see Pope Eugene III in Tusculum, where he had been driven five months before by a revolt of the Commune of Rome.|$|E
