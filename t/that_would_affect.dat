5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} decade of the century, the {{political}} climate in Europe was feverish: the War of the League of Cambrai had begun. The French, under Gaston of Foix, Duke of Nemours, had sacked Brescia in 1512, the town now in ruins and the myth of Brixia magnipotens shattered. A lively era of humanism and trade was ended, a phenomenon <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>affect</b> the rest of the peninsula in the following decades.|$|E
5|$|Armada of the Damned was {{conceived}} as an action-adventure role-playing video game played from a third-person perspective {{and set in}} an open world environment based on the Pirates of the Caribbean universe. The player {{was to take the}} role of James Sterling, a pirate captain whose main mission was to travel across the Caribbean Sea and make a reputation for himself. Some of Sterling's features could be directly customized by the player, although Armada of the Damned was centered on a choice system <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>affect</b> the character's appearance, personality, weapons, attacks, quests, and story developments.|$|E
5|$|The 1950s and 1960s saw two {{developments}} <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>affect</b> stellar convection {{theory in}} red supergiants: the Stratoscope projects and the 1958 publication of Structure and Evolution of the Stars, principally {{the work of}} Martin Schwarzschild and his colleague at Princeton University, Richard Härm. This book disseminated {{ideas on how to}} apply computer technologies to create stellar models, while the Stratoscope projects, by taking balloon-borne telescopes above the Earth's turbulence, produced some of the finest images of solar granules and sunspots ever seen, thus confirming the existence of convection in the solar atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|All but 4 of the {{scheduled}} 120 games were played. The four games {{that were not}} played were the series scheduled between the Brisbane Bandits and the Canberra Cavalry at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground for the ninth round. Flooding in Brisbane had resulted in the Exhibition Ground being used as an evacuation centre for affected residents. Initially the ABL postponed the series, leaving a {{decision as to whether}} the games would be rescheduled to a later time. Just prior to the final round of scheduled games, it was announced that the games would go ahead in the form of two doubleheaders, but that only games <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>affect</b> the playoffs would be played. When Brisbane lost the final game of their series against the Adelaide Bite, both they and Canberra were eliminated from contention for the playoffs; hence, the makeup games were not played.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} 2013 budget the Dunderdale {{government}} announced that the province's four English school boards would be consolidated into one, while the one French school board would remain as is. The number of school boards in the province had been reduced in 2004, from 10 boards to five. Since that time student enrolment in Newfoundland and Labrador had declined by 14,000, or 17 per cent. The government faced criticism for the amalgamation from people in the education system but despite this Minister Clyde Jackman announced {{the appointment of a}} transition team for the amalgamation on April 24, 2013, with a plan to have the new school board in place for September of that year. The budget also saw reductions in the Department of Education <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>affect</b> areas such as administration, learning resources support and district-based numeracy supports. However, the minister said there would be no reduction in the allocation of regular classroom teachers, and Jackman stated that Newfoundland and Labrador had the best student-teacher ratio in the country.|$|E
5|$|Like other volcanoes in the Anahim Volcanic Belt, the Itcha Range is not {{monitored}} closely {{enough by}} the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active its magma system is. The Canadian National Seismograph Network {{has been established}} to monitor earthquakes throughout Canada, {{but it is too}} far away to provide an accurate indication of activity under the range. It may sense an increase in seismic activity if the Itcha Range becomes highly restless, but this may only provide a warning for a large eruption; the system might detect activity only once the volcano has started erupting. If the Itcha Range were to erupt, mechanisms exist to orchestrate relief efforts. The Interagency Volcanic Event Notification Plan (IVENP) was created to outline the notification procedure of some of the main agencies that would respond to an erupting volcano in Canada, an eruption close to the Canada–United States border or any eruption <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>affect</b> Canada.|$|E

5|$|Over time, Jackson's facial {{structure}} {{changed as}} well. Surgeons speculated {{he also had}} a rhinoplasty, a forehead lift, cheekbone surgery, altered his lips, and had a cleft put in his chin. Those close to the singer estimated that, by 1990, he had undergone around ten procedures. According to Taraborrelli, Jackson had his first rhinoplasty after breaking his nose during a complex dance routine in 1979. However, the surgery was not a complete success, and he complained of breathing difficulties <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>affect</b> his career. He was referred to Steven Hoefflin, who performed his second rhinoplasty in 1981. Katherine Jackson, though, has {{said in a recent interview}} that Michael intentionally got his first nosejob from Steven Hoefflin. Taraborrelli stated Jackson had a third rhinoplasty three years later and a fourth in 1986. Jackson wrote in his 1988 autobiography Moonwalk that, in addition to the two rhinoplasties, {{he also had a}} dimple created in his chin. From 1986 onward he was a regular client of Arnold Klein, a dermatologist who specializes in dermal filler injection, a non-surgical cosmetic procedure.|$|E

25|$|Rabbis {{have always}} {{pointed out that}} the {{dispensation}} from vows in Kol Nidrei refers only to those an individual voluntarily assumes for himself alone and in which no other persons or their interests are involved. The first verse ends with a qualifier for all the forms of pledges and vows being annulled—עַל נַפְשָׁתָֽנָא—"regarding ourselves"—by which this formula is limited to annulling only those vows <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>affect</b> only ourselves but not vows <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>affect</b> any other person. The formula is restricted to those vows between man and God alone; they have no effect on vows made between one man and another. No vow, promise, or oath that concerns another person, a court of justice, or a community is implied in Kol Nidrei. It does not matter if a vow was made to one or more non-Jews, such a vow cannot be annulled. According to Jewish doctrine, the sole purpose of this prayer is to give protection from divine punishment in case of violation of the vow.|$|E

In 2016, Amazon.com for example, had some 3,500 employees in Costa Rica and planned to increase that by 1,500 in 2017, making it an important employer.|$|E
25|$|Other {{features}} of the proposed constitutional amendment were the requirement for the acquisition of all future territories {{to be approved by}} a majority of both the slave states and the free states, a prohibition on Congress passing any legislation <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>affect</b> the status of slavery where it currently existed, a prohibition on state legislatures from passing laws that would restrict the ability of officials to apprehend and return fugitive slaves, a permanent prohibition on the foreign slave trade, and 100% compensation to any master whose fugitive slave was freed by illegal mob action or intimidation of officials required to administer the Fugitive Slave Act. Key sections of this amendment could be further amended only with the concurrence of all of the states.|$|E
25|$|A further {{contributory}} {{factor was}} {{the introduction of}} a new Establishment of Guns in 1716. Previously, gun establishments had catered for each ship, as there were often differences between ships of the same nominal size <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>affect</b> the armament they could carry. The 1716 gun establishment was intended to overturn that situation, so that all ships of a particular type (for example, 70 gun ships) would carry the same armament. The Navy Board highlighted {{the fact that there were}} still several ships in service that were physically incapable of carrying the prescribed armament, either due to the number and disposition of gunports, or to sturdiness of build. Essentially, however, the Navy Board resolved to undertake the task of having all ships rebuilt to common designs to facilitate the new gun establishment.|$|E
