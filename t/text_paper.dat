50|$|The {{printing}} {{of both the}} text and the image pages used stochastic lithography {{in order to create}} outstanding quality prints from the original watercolours. Stochastic lithography is an advancement in printing technology that can give a better print quality, cleaner more dynamic and accurate colour images, and reduce running waste. Whereas conventional lithography uses half-tone dots of various sizes and spaces these dots at the same distance from each other, stochastic lithography uses microdots of a common size of various spacing according to tonal value. Stochastic screening uses smaller printing dots to create a higher image detail. Tonal ranges and colour contrasts are also improved because the variation in dot distribution increases ink densities. The images were printed on 245 gsm American Cotton paper for the colour plates and on 175 gsm Somerset Bookwove <b>text</b> <b>paper.</b> The text is set in Fairbank and Bembo book types.|$|E
5000|$|Working in a {{range of}} print media from relief printing, intaglio, {{lithography}} to hybrid techniques, Poskovic's graphic works typically juxtapose a strong central image with seemingly unrelated text in a foreign or imaginary language evoking a multileveled meaning. Writing for the Omaha Reader, artist Mary Day states that [...] "Gazing at one of these prints becomes an apprehension of the unseen and unknown. The unknown being what came before, and after, this particular moment captured in an amalgam of image, <b>text,</b> <b>paper,</b> and ink." [...] In recent years, Poskovic has worked extensively in lithography printmaking in collaboration with Tamarind Institute master printer Jill Graham [...] at Open Studio Toronto, as well as NSCAD University in Halifax, Nova Scotia producing a series of stone lithographic prints and animation Crossing Series. Poskovic's Crossing Series assimilates memory and reality as a way to underscore a personal tale of discovery. Working through additive and subtractive stone lithography printing and short animations to depict topography specific to Southeastern Herzegovina and Dalmatia region, Poskovic indirectly examines the recent political and demographic shifts in the country of his birth. The achromatic lithographs, based on small aluminum models Poskovic makes, are filmed and drawn directly on lime stone from the film stills. The classical drawing’s translation through lithography’s dense method pays homage to the history of the process invented in 1796 by German author and playwright Alois Senefelder. In these works, Poskovic invokes the works of Frederic Edwin Church, Caspar David Friedrich, Edvard Munch, and Winslow Homer. In the animations, simple, eloquent transitions from image to image, such as an iceberg gradually morphing into a cloud, or a stormy, rain-filled cloud evaporating into nothing, create a familiar, yet unsettling experience. This hybrid blend of drawing, print, and animation creates an amalgam of possibilities, in which the unfamiliar becomes almost tactile, while the familiar (rocks, clouds, water) provides a handhold on reality. Poskovic's works are in the permanent public collections of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Aberystwyth University Museum of Art, the University of Iowa Museum of Art, [...] Harvard University Fogg Museum, Detroit Institute of Arts , U.S. State Department Art in Embassies Program, Grand Valley State University, Indianapolis Museum of Art, Burchfield Penney Art Center, Art Museum of Estonia, and many others.|$|E
