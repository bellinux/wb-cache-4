40|$|Abstract — Whole-body {{control in}} unknown environments is challenging: Unforeseen {{contacts}} with obstacles {{can lead to}} poor tracking performance and potential physical damages of the robot. Hence, a whole-body control approach for future humanoid robots in (partially) unknown environments needs <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>contact</b> sensing into account, e. g., by means of artificial skin. However, translating contacts from skin measurements into physically well-understood quantities can be problematic as the exact position and strength of the contact needs to be converted into torques. In this paper, we suggest an alternative approach that directly learns the mapping from both skin and the joint state to torques. We propose to learn such an inverse dynamics models with contacts using a mixture-of-contacts approach that exploits the linear superimposition of contact forces. The learned model can, making use of uncalibrated tactile sensors, accurately predict the torques needed {{to compensate for the}} contact. As a result, tracking of trajectories with obstacles and tactile contact can be executed more accurately. We demonstrate on the humanoid robot iCub that our approach improve the tracking error in presence of dynamic contacts. I...|$|E

It describes the evolution of acculturation theory, models and research. Next, the paper briefly reviews the developments in the application of social psychological theory to the study of immigration and intergroup relations and illustrates the convergence of these approaches across ten studies. Finally, it makes recommendations for the course of future research. Specifically it recommends to clearly distinguish between cultural heritage and cultural identity, <b>to</b> <b>take</b> transnational <b>contacts</b> into account in models of acculturation, and to examine the concepts of pluralism and creolization as outcomes of culturally heterogeneous host societies.

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} {{an application}} of a technique for predicting the thermal characteristics of a bidirectional thermocycling device for polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The micromilling chamber is oscillated by a servo motor and contacted with different isothermal heating blocks to successfully amplify the DNA templates. Because a comprehensive database of contact resistance factors does not exist, it causes researchers <b>to</b> not <b>take</b> thermal <b>contact</b> resistance into consideration at all. We are motivated to accurately determine the thermal characteristics of the reaction chamber with thermal contact effects existing between the heater surface and the chamber surface. Numerical {{results show that the}} thermal contact effects between the heating blocks and the reaction chamber dominate the temperature variations and the ramping rates inside the PCR chamber. However, the influences of various temperatures of the ambient conditions on the sample temperature during three PCR steps can be negligible. The experimental temperature profiles are compared well with the numerical simulations by considering the thermal contact conductance coefficient which is empirical by the experimental fitting. <b>To</b> <b>take</b> thermal <b>contact</b> conductance coefficients into consideration in the thermal simulation is recommended to predict a reasonable temperature profile of the reaction chamber during various thermal cycling processes. Finally, the PCR experiments present that Hygromycin B DNA templates are amplified successfully. Furthermore, our group is the first group to introduce the thermal contact effect into theoretical study that has been applied to the design of a PCR device, and to perform the PCR process in a bidirectional thermocycler...|$|R

40|$|Language contact {{has become}} a major focus of inquiry in {{historical}} and typological linguistics in the last twenty years, spurred in a large part by the publication of Thomason & Kaufman (1988), which tried to make sense of a large amount of language contact data.

Essentially, the greater the degree of bilingualism, the greater the degree of contact influence (see also Thomason 2001); if the contact and bilingualism was minimal, then there might just be a few loanwords adapted to the borrowing language's phonology and grammatical system, but if the contact and bilingualism was of a greater degree there would be influence in the grammar and phonology of the affected language.

40|$|Routine {{public health}} {{surveillance}} of notifiable infectious diseases {{gives rise to}} weekly counts of reported cases - possibly stratified by region and/or age group. A well-established approach to the statistical analysis of such surveillance data are endemic-epidemic time-series models. The temporal dependence inherent to communicable diseases is thereby taken into account by an observation-driven formulation conditioning on past counts. Additional spatial dynamics in areal-level counts are largely driven by human travel and can be captured by power-law weights based {{on the order of}} adjacency. However, social contacts are highly assortative also with respect to age. For example, characteristic pathways of directly transmitted pathogens are linked to childcare facilities, schools and nursing homes. We therefore investigate how a spatio-temporal endemic-epidemic model can be extended <b>to</b> <b>take</b> social <b>contact</b> data into account.
