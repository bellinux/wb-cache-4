500|$|The Queen's {{appearance}} {{was inspired by}} the [...] "ageless ice goddess" [...] character of Queen Ayesha ("She who must be obeyed") from the 1935 film She, played by Helen Gahagan. The Queen, who was originally to be named Grimhilde (but who is never actually named in the film), was also modeled in part on Princess Kriemhild in the 1924 film Die Nibelungen. It is also possible that the Queen's looks may have been inspired by the faces of Joan Crawford and Gale Sondergaard; her costume and figure may have been inspired by a column statue at the Naumburg Cathedral depicting Uta von Ballenstedt, the wife of Eckard II, Margrave of Meissen who was widely regarded as the most beautiful woman of Medieval Germany. Also noted was her resemblance to two 1930s American movie stars from Europe, Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich. The Queen and Snow White were refined by Grim Natwick and Norm Ferguson, who would often override Walt Disney's instructions. As in the case of other characters for the film, the Queen's appearance had to be approved by Albert Hurter before being finalised. One pre-final version of the queen had her wear a looser hood and a different crown and <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cape was fur trimmed, as it can be seen in Gustaf Tenggren's pictures.|$|E

60|$|The girl's lips quivered, and {{her small}} brown hands twisted <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> blue checked apron. Although this new picture of Jim's peacefulness was as astounding and {{unsatisfactory}} {{as his own}} disappearance, {{there was no doubt}} of the sincerity of poor Phoebe's impression.|$|R

2500|$|Characters may be {{frequently}} {{presented with}} challenges that normal human beings, {{even within the}} context of the game, would find difficult, deadly, or simply impossible. [...] However, as the chosen champions of greater powers, each Exalt possesses Charms, which may either enhance their natural capabilities or manifest as shows of great power. [...] An Exalt with low-level archery charms might find her arrows hitting with preternatural accuracy, while greater faculty might allow her to shoot without difficulty to <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> vision, or turn a single arrow into a deadly rain of ammunition.|$|E
2500|$|... "Then the Maid , surpassing {{the nature}} of a woman, took on a great force, and took much pain to save her company from defeat, {{remaining}} behind as the leader and as the bravest of the troop. [...] But there fortune permitted for the end of her glory and for the last time that she would ever carry arms. [...] An archer, a rough and very sour man, full of much spite because a woman, who so much had been spoken about, should have defeated so many brave men, as she had done, grabbed <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cloth-of-gold doublet, and threw her from her horse flat to the ground." ...|$|E
50|$|Cownose rays breed from June through October. A large {{school of}} cownose rays gather of varying ages and sexes in shallow waters.

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Colville; [...] "you can't be {{logical and}} {{complimentary}} {{at the same}} time. It's too much to ask. How delicious your flowers are!"

2500|$|The {{courtship}} {{starts with}} the male grasping the female's pedipalps with his own; the pair then perform a [...] "dance" [...] called the [...] "promenade à deux". In this [...] "dance", the male leads the female around searching for a suitable place to deposit his spermatophore. The courtship ritual can involve several other behaviours, such as juddering and a cheliceral kiss, in which the male's chelicerae – pincers – grasp the female's in a smaller more intimate version of the male's grasping the female's pedipalps {{and in some cases}} injecting a small amount of his venom into her pedipalp or on <b>the</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> cephalothorax, probably as a means of pacifying the female.|$|E

6000|$|It was {{a fierce}} scud of hail, hitting rather than wetting, but Dolores had the {{satisfaction}} <b>of</b> declaring <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dress to be damp and {{going off to}} change it, though Aunt Jane pinched the kilting and said the damp was imperceptible, and Wilfred muttered, 'Made of sugar, only not so sweet.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Clara let {{her eyes}} fall, and fingered <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> fan. There was reason in this, {{and she did}} not care that the {{opportunity}} of usefulness was personally unflattering, since he thought <b>her</b> capable <b>of</b> rising above the fact.

50|$|Coming to {{understand}} what they mean to her, Sayward finds several young trees on <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> former land.

60|$|Dryfoos sat {{at breakfast}} that morning with Mrs. Mandel as usual to pour out his coffee. Conrad had gone down-town; {{the two girls}} lay abed much later than their father breakfasted, and their mother had {{gradually}} grown too feeble to come down till lunch. Suddenly Christine appeared at the door. Her face was white to <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> lips, {{and her eyes were}} blazing.|$|R
60|$|Helen {{dismissed}} {{the subject as}} abruptly {{as she always did}} when the conversation touched too nearly on <b>the</b> sensitive <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> soul dreams.|$|R
5000|$|One {{practice}} {{peculiar to}} the atelier was the adding of so-called [...] "anges de douceur" [...] to their pietàs and crucifixs. These angels would either {{try to make}} Mary more comfortable by lifting <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> veil away from her forehead, touch or arrange a lock of Jesus' hair, or make some other comforting tactile gesture.

5000|$|Harwood’s early {{paintings}} {{consisted of}} rigid, flat planes {{of color and}} interlocking forms - pure abstraction with no representational content. She often painted with acrylics, which was uncommon for painters <b>of</b> <b>her</b> time, and used tape to define <b>the</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> shapes. “My paint application was uniform, {{that is to say}} that no brush strokes were evident, creating impeccable, flat surfaces. Thus there would be no distraction from the intent, which was to create an interplay of ‘colorforms.’ Jules (Langsner) used this term to mean that color and form are one.” ...|$|R
