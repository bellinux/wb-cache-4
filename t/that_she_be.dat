5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} four novels, Fleming {{came up with}} the concept of the front cover design; he considered Honeychile Rider to have a Venus-like quality when introduced in the book and wanted this echoed on the cover. When Fleming commissioned Pat Marriott to illustrate the cover, he instructed <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> shown on a Venus elegans shell.|$|E
5|$|Clairmont accused Byron {{of murdering}} Allegra {{and demanded that}} Byron send her a {{portrait}} of Allegra, a lock of the child's hair, and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> placed {{in charge of the}} funeral arrangements. In the end, though, Clairmont could not bear to see Allegra's coffin or to hold a funeral service for her daughter. She blamed Byron {{for the rest of her}} life for Allegra's death.|$|E
5|$|Hollywood was in {{the midst}} of a widely publicized search to find an actress to portray Scarlett O'Hara in David O. Selznick's {{production}} of Gone with the Wind (1939). At the time, Myron Selznick—David's brother and Leigh's American theatrical agent—was the London representative of the Myron Selznick Agency. In February 1938, Leigh made a request to Myron Selznick <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> considered to play the part of Scarlett O'Hara.|$|E

What I then knew of her <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a follower of Buddhism, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> followed a mode of vegetarianism, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> amicable, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> never annoyed, and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> smiling all the time." ...|$|R

5|$|As {{her health}} went downhill, Emmeline Pankhurst {{moved into a}} nursing home in Hampstead. She {{requested}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> treated by the doctor who attended to her during her hunger strikes. His use of the stomach pump had helped her feel better while in prison; her nurses were sure that the shock of such treatment would severely wound her, but Christabel felt obligated to carry out her mother's request. Before the procedure could be carried out, however, she fell into a critical condition from which none expected her to recover. On Thursday 14 June 1928 Pankhurst died, {{at the age of}} 69. She was interred in Brompton Cemetery in London.|$|E
5|$|During the war, {{plans were}} drawn up to quell Welsh {{nationalism}} by affiliating Elizabeth {{more closely with}} Wales. Proposals, such as appointing her Constable of Caernarfon Castle or a patron of Urdd Gobaith Cymru (the Welsh League of Youth), were abandoned for various reasons, which included a fear of associating Elizabeth with conscientious objectors in the Urdd, {{at a time when}} Britain was at war. Welsh politicians suggested <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> made Princess of Wales on her 18th birthday. Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison supported the idea, but the King rejected it because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a Prince of Wales and the Prince of Wales had always been the heir apparent. In 1946, she was inducted into the Welsh Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod of Wales.|$|E
50|$|John contended <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{authorized}} to use Citigroup internal computer system and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> permitted to view and print information regarding Citibank customers’ accounts in {{course of her}} official duties. <b>She</b> argued <b>that</b> CFAA prohibits only using authorized access to obtain the information <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not entitled to obtain, but does not impose liability for the unlawful use of the information <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{authorized to}} access.|$|R

5|$|Following World War II, Sava {{was raised}} once again, and was {{refurbished}} {{to serve in}} the Yugoslav Navy from 1952 to 1962. She was then transferred to a state-owned company that was eventually privatised. In 2005, the government of Serbia granted her limited heritage protection after citizens demanded <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> preserved as a floating museum, but little else has been done to restore her at the time. In 2015, the Serbian Ministry of Defence and Belgrade's Military Museum acquired the ship with the intent of restoring her.|$|E
5|$|HMS Zealous {{was laid}} down on 26 October 1859 as a wooden two-deck, 90-gun ship {{of the line}} by Pembroke Royal Dockyard, but her {{construction}} was suspended pending experience with the conversion of her half-sisters of the Prince Consort class to broadside ironclads. The Admiralty ordered on 2 July 1862 <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> cut down one deck and converted to an armoured frigate {{for the price of}} £239,258. The ship was launched on 7 March 1864 and commissioned in September 1866, but was not completed until 4 October 1866.|$|E
5|$|Henry VIII died in 1547 and Edward succeeded him. Mary {{inherited}} estates in Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex, and {{was granted}} Hunsdon and Beaulieu as her own. Since Edward {{was still a}} child, rule passed to a regency council dominated by Protestants, who attempted to establish their faith throughout the country. For example, the Act of Uniformity 1549 prescribed Protestant rites for church services, {{such as the use}} of Thomas Cranmer's new Book of Common Prayer. Mary remained faithful to Roman Catholicism and defiantly celebrated the traditional Mass in her own chapel. She appealed to her cousin Emperor Charles V to apply diplomatic pressure demanding <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> allowed to practice her religion.|$|E
5000|$|Note: When being implied <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> 47, Edith says <b>she</b> <b>is</b> 36, despite {{saying in}} a {{previous}} episode <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> nearly 27.|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} {{recognized}} by many historians <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> {{the daughter of the}} Anatolian Turkish Bey, Ömer Bey, although there had <b>been</b> some speculations <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> the daughter of Sheikh Edebali. Other sources say <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> the daughter of Ömer Abdülaziz Bey, Seljuk vizier of Anatolia.|$|R

5|$|Immediately after Christina's departure, Mary {{fell ill}} and {{requested}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> allowed to resign as governor, but Charles {{did not allow}} it. A year later, Dorothea too was married. A few months after Dorothea's departure, the now widowed Christina returned to her aunt's court. King Henry VIII of England immediately proposed marriage to Christina, and Charles urged Mary to negotiate the marriage. She was not in favour of the union, and delayed. Henry was excommunicated in 1539, at which point Charles had to end the negotiations.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, FLDS leader Rulon Jeffs {{arranged}} for a then 14-year-old Wall to marry her 19-year-old cousin, Allen Steed. Wall stated that she despised her cousin and asked <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> given more time or another possible husband. Her stepfather, mother, and older sister, Rebecca Musser, were supportive of the marriage and encouraged her {{to go through with}} it, with the latter two sewing her wedding dress and organizing her honeymoon. She and Steed were married at the Hotsprings Motel in Caliente, Nevada. Warren Jeffs, who had previously insisted that the wedding move forward, performed the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|Isabeau's uncle, Duke Frederick of Bavaria-Landshut, {{suggested}} in 1383 <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> {{considered as a}} bride to King Charles VI of France. The match was proposed again at the lavish Burgundian double wedding in Cambrai in April 1385—John the Fearless and his sister Margaret of Burgundy married Margaret and William of Bavaria-Straubing respectively. Charles, then 17, rode in the tourneys at the wedding. He was an attractive, physically fit young man, who enjoyed jousting and hunting and was excited to be married.|$|E
5000|$|In 1976, Krantz's husband {{decided to}} take flying lessons. Krantz chose to join him, despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> afraid of flying. Having conquered <b>that</b> fear, <b>she</b> {{determined}} to face her other fears. For {{the first time since}} college, she attempted to write fiction. [...] Although her husband had been insisting for years <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> a natural storyteller, Krantz believed <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> writing the book simply to prove to him <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not able to write good fiction.|$|R

5|$|Other {{problems}} also emerged. In 1689, Anne's supporters (including the Marlboroughs and the Duke of Somerset) demanded <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> {{granted a}} parliamentary annuity of £50,000, a sum {{that would end}} her dependence on William and Mary. Sarah {{was seen as the}} driving force behind this bill, creating further ill-feeling towards her at court. William responded to the demand by offering the same sum from the Privy Purse, to keep Anne dependent on his generosity. However, Anne, through Sarah, refused, pointing out that a parliamentary grant would be more secure than charity from the Privy Purse. Eventually Anne received the grant from Parliament, and felt she owed this to Sarah's efforts.|$|E
5|$|The {{announcement}} of her resignation {{was met with}} speculation that San Miguel had been forced by Binibining Pilipinas pageant organizers to relinquish her title {{due to a lack}} of professionalism during preparatory training sessions, which strained the patience of her mentors and superiors. In a later interview, she admitted that due to multiple conflicts in schedule she was unable to attend all the training sessions arranged for her by pageant organizers, which included sessions to improve her speaking ability. She also admitted to throwing a fit in the middle of a rehearsal when she received news that her grandfather was dying, and demanded <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> allowed to leave.|$|E
5|$|The {{night before}} the final battle, the player meets Morrigan, who proposes a way to slay the Archdemon without sacrificing anyone: the two conceiving a child. The child, also {{carrying}} the Taint, would merge with the Archdemon once it dies, creating a demonic essence which will spare any Grey Warden. Morrigan agrees to conceive the child, which would resultantly be born a demigod, on the condition <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> allowed to raise it alone. The player can accept Morrigan's offer (if male), convince Alistair/Loghain to take part instead, or refuse the witch's proposal, which will cause her to leave the party.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the terms}} of DrSteevens' will were that work on the {{hospital}} would not begin until after Griselda Steevens' death, she decided to begin work on the hospital in 1720. Reserving only £120 per year for her own use, she used the remaining funds to buy a plot of land near Kilmainham and to build the new hospital, with the sole condition being <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> granted a suite of apartments in the building. As a youth Griselda had suffered a disorder of the eyes, and since then had worn a veil while in sunlight. Shy and reclusive, while conducting her charitable works in the Dublin slums she would remain in her carriage while servants gave out alms to the poor. By 1723 a sufficient portion of the new Dr Steevens' Hospital was completed to accommodate 40 patients, in addition to Griselda's apartments. The remainder of the hospital, with space for 200 patients, opened in 1733. Griselda lived in the hospital from 1723 until her death.|$|E
5|$|Bryant Haliday {{was cast}} in the lead role as Professor Steiner. He was chosen for the role as Gordon was opposed to a British actor playing the title role, and the budget would not allow a Hollywood star to be used. The fact that Gordon was already {{familiar}} with him, as he had cast him in Curse of Simba and Devil Doll, was also a factor. Haliday, a fan of horror movies, enjoyed doing The Projected Man. British stage actress Mary Peach {{was cast in}} the lead role as Dr. Patricia Hill. It was insisted <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> given top billing for her role. Norman Wooland, a German-born British character actor, was cast as Dr. Blanchard, the film's villain. Derek Farr portrays Inspector Davis, and Ronald Allen {{plays the role of}} Dr. Christopher Mitchell. A scene in the film features actress Norma West lying topless on a morgue table; this scene was added to aid sales overseas.|$|E
5|$|In December 2001, aged 101, she {{fractured}} her pelvis in a fall. Even so, {{she insisted}} on standing for the National Anthem during the memorial service for her husband on 6 February the following year. Just three days later, her second daughter Princess Margaret died. On 13 February 2002, the Queen Mother fell and cut her arm in her sitting room at Sandringham House; an ambulance and doctor were called, and the wound was dressed. She was still determined to attend Margaret's funeral at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, two days later on the Friday of that week, even though the Queen {{and the rest of}} the royal family were concerned about the journey the Queen Mother would face to get from Norfolk to Windsor; she was also rumoured to be hardly eating. Nevertheless, she flew to Windsor by helicopter, and so that no photographs of her in a wheelchair could be taken—she insisted <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> shielded from the press—she travelled to the service in a people carrier with blacked–out windows, which had been previously used by Margaret.|$|E
