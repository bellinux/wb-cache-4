500|$|Lecrae {{attended}} a conference after being invited by a friend, though Lecrae admits that his interest {{was to meet}} girls and experience the big city. When {{he arrived at the}} conference, Lecrae was awed by the performance of the Christian hip-hop group The Cross Movement. Lecrae says that he saw [...] "guys who had been shot from being in gangs, girls who were extremely promiscuous in the past, I see rappers, dancers and singers; I see people who came from the same background I came from, and they still embodied who they were culturally, but they were all in love with Jesus and I had never seen that before." [...] After hearing Pastor James White of Christ Our King Community Church speak on how Christians are bought with a price and the suffering that Jesus underwent in the Crucifixion, Lecrae says that he remembers articulating [...] "God get me out of this, don't kill me; do whatever you have to do <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this, just don't kill me." [...] Later, Lecrae was driving on a highway when he turned too quickly and his car went into a roll. He had no seatbelt and the roof and windshield of the car caved in, his glasses were molded into the frame of the car, but he survived completely uninjured. Lecrae cites this incident as the one which convinced him to commit his life to Christ. Lecrae went back to his college, the University of North Texas, with a printed version of his testimony to pass out on campus. He started volunteering and performing at a juvenile detention center, and the reception he received convinced him that offering [...] "hope and encouragement" [...] through music was what he wanted to do. However, Lecrae still struggled in his faith âˆ’ as revealed in [...] "Good, Bad, Ugly", in 2002 he impregnated a then-girlfriend. Rather than risk scandal, he and his girlfriend had the baby aborted, a decision he says he now deeply regrets. In the same song, he revealed that he had been sexually abused by a babysitter as a child.|$|E
2500|$|Kurkjian's caller said Donati visited Ferrara at {{the federal}} lockup in Hartford, Connecticut, where he was being held, after his January 1990 arrest on {{racketeering}} charges. The two spoke quietly, using short and vague language, aware their conversations were likely being monitored. Donati told Ferrara he would get him out; Ferrara pleaded with him not to try anything. [...] "No matter what you do, it's not going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> here", he said. [...] "They will for these; you'll see", Donati responded.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} we {{returned}} down Broadway, {{it seemed to me}} that the city was flying before some awful calamity. [...] "Why," [...] said I, [...] "Colonel, what under heaven is the matter? Everyone appears to be pitching out their furniture, and packing it off." [...] He laughed, and said this was the general [...] "moving day." [...] Such a sight nobody ever saw unless it was in this same city. It seemed a kind of frolic, as if they were changing houses just for fun. Every street was crowded with carts, drays, and people. So the world goes. It would take a good deal <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my log-house; but here, I understand, many persons [...] "move" [...] every year.|$|E
6000|$|O'FLAHERTY. Why wouldn't I say it? She's {{thinking}} {{of nothing but}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> there again <b>to</b> be wounded so that she may spend my pension, bad scran to her! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I had to kick him, of course,' the Knight said, very seriously. 'And then he {{took the}} helmet off again--but it took hours and hours <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>out.</b> I was as fast as--as lightning, you know.' ...|$|R
60|$|So it {{was decided}} that Lawson and Frank would try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> by way of the canyon; Wallace {{intended}} to go by the Utah route, and Jones was to return at once to his range and his buffalo.|$|R
6000|$|... "Because Mr. Stillwell was {{not acting}} rightly about my late father's estate, and as I was {{beginning}} to suspect him he wished <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way." ...|$|E
60|$|Harry (Watching her). Directly. But women {{always had}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my scrapes. I am a beggar now, {{and you must}} help {{me out of my}} scrape.|$|E
60|$|MINNIE. No, don't try--forgiveness doesn't {{come that}} way, Mrs. Pindar. (With sudden acuteness.) It was {{on account of}} George, not Dr. Jonathan, that you wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Foxon Falls.|$|E
6000|$|... "I went {{only to the}} post-office," [...] said she, [...] "and reached {{home before}} the rain was much. It is my daily errand. I always fetch the letters when I am here. It saves trouble, and is a {{something}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>out.</b> A walk before breakfast does me good." ...|$|R
60|$|When at last I reached our lodgings I {{was tired}} and sleepy, and glad enough to settle down again into the easy-chair, while Arthur hospitably went to his cupboard, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> some cake and wine, without which, he declared, he could not, as a doctor, permit my going to bed.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is, indeed," [...] {{replied the}} Tin Woodman, {{speaking}} in muffled tones {{because so much}} water covered him. [...] "I cannot drown, of course, but I must lie here until you find a way <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>out.</b> Meantime, the water is soaking into all my joints and I shall become badly rusted before I am rescued." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] Grahame returned, smiling, [...] "I suppose my {{intentions}} were good, but I didn't accomplish much, and my partner {{had to run}} a serious risk <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was worth}} trying the bluff, I guess, but it won't work. I know you'd be glad <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this house, but you've {{got to make}} a better play than that to do it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{the short}} fellow who {{got me to}} carry the valise!" [...] he said to himself. [...] "They know about my goin' to see the inspector, and are bound <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] he replied, with indifference. [...] "But, do you know, I do {{not mind}} about being taken. They will {{send me to}} the comandancia, I suppose, {{and after a few}} days {{liberate}} me. I am a good workman on horseback, and there will not be wanting some estanciero in need of hands <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>out.</b> Will you do me one small service, friend, before you go to your bed?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly. You tried {{your best}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the way," [...] went on Ralph, in rather a loud voice. [...] "And {{now you have}} failed, I {{want to know what}} your next move is going to be." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{extended}} his hand. [...] "No fear! I haven't forgotten {{a single one}} of you in the world. Some gave me more than money--but I am a beggar now--and you women always had <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> my scrapes." ...|$|E
6000|$|Sherikov's {{features}} darkened. [...] "You'll {{have to take}} a chance, Commissioner. I don't {{trust you}} any more than you trust me. I know how much you'd like an excuse <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> here and one of your puppets in." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I cannot tell you, senor, {{how much}} I am indebted to Don Leon for the splendid {{way in which}} he managed my rescue. Nothing could have been more admirably contrived, or better carried out. It {{certainly}} seemed to me, after I had been there a day or two, that a rescue was simply impossible; though I knew that Colonel O'Connor would do his best <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>out,</b> as soon as he learned that I was captured." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now don't get mad, Hilary. I guess, and you know, that Flint hasn't treated you decently {{this summer}} after all you've done for him, and I admire the way you're {{standing}} by him. I wouldn't do it. I {{just wanted to}} say," [...] Mr. Hunt added slowly, [...] "that I respect you {{all the more for}} trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>out.</b> If--always according <b>to</b> your notion of the convention--if I don't get out, and haven't any chance, they tell me on pretty good authority Austen Vane will get the nomination." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; {{you know}} your business,' said he, 'but birds' nests are no use to me. I am too old for them. Now if you were only able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this wood, you would indeed be good for something.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All that is {{done and}} ended," [...] said Arnold shaking him by the shoulder. [...] "It rests with you now <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the {{difficulty}} I'm placed in with Blanche. Things must be settled with Miss Silvester to-day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fathom or not fathom," [...] rejoined my friend, {{looking at}} his watch again, [...] "you got me into this scrape, so I request you <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it. We have exactly twenty-five minutes and a half before us now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{what are}} you going to do? I will not be as foolish as I was when you tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> safe <b>out</b> of Rollo's tower. But I should like to wish Carloman farewell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, he is. He tries <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go <b>out</b> every voyage, and I wish I could. Come quickly; I want to {{say good-bye}} to him before he starts." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{believe that}} one reason why Squire Paget wished <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>me</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the {{situation}} on the bridge was because he hoped thereby to force me to leave Westville altogether," [...] remarked Ralph, as the train sped on its way.|$|E
