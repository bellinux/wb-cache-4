25|$|Raymond of Tripoli {{allied with}} Saladin against Guy and allowed a Muslim {{garrison}} to occupy his fief in Tiberias, probably hoping that Saladin {{would help him}} overthrow Guy. Saladin, meanwhile, had pacified his Mesopotamian territories, and was now eager to attack the crusader kingdom; he {{did not intend to}} renew the truce when it expired in 1187. Before the truce expired, Raynald of Chatillon, the lord of Oultrejourdain and of Kerak and one of Guy's chief supporters, recognized that Saladin was massing his troops, and attacked Muslim caravans in an attempt to disrupt <b>this.</b> <b>Guy</b> <b>was</b> on the verge of attacking Raymond, but realized that the kingdom would need to be united {{in the face of the}} threat from Saladin, and Balian of Ibelin effected a reconciliation between the two during Easter in 1187. Saladin attacked Kerak again in April, and in May, a Muslim raiding party ran into the much smaller embassy on its way to negotiate with Raymond, and defeated it at the Battle of Cresson near Nazareth. Raymond and Guy finally agreed to attack Saladin at Tiberias, but could not agree on a plan; Raymond thought a pitched battle should be avoided, but Guy probably remembered the criticism he faced for avoiding battle in 1183, and it was decided to march out against Saladin directly. On July 4, 1187, the army of the kingdom was utterly destroyed at the Battle of Hattin. Raymond of Tripoli, Balian of Ibelin, and Reginald of Sidon escaped, but Raynald was executed by Saladin and Guy was imprisoned in Damascus.|$|E
500|$|The {{team leader}} and spotter of SEAL Team 10. Lone Survivor is Kitsch's second feature film {{collaboration}} with Berg after Battleship (2012). [...] Kitsch said, [...] "Murph's actions speak louder than anything he's ever said, and they should.

500|$|Tom Noonan, {{who played}} killer Francis Dollarhyde, {{initially}} researched other serial killers {{to study for}} the role, but was repulsed by it. He then decided to play the character with {{the sense that he}} felt he was doing right by his victims, not harming them. [...] "I wanted to feel <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> <b>was</b> doing the best he could", Noonan explained, [...] "that he was doing this out of love". Noonan credits his casting to improvisation during his audition, recalling that he was reading lines alongside a young woman.

500|$|While both Duchovny and Carter {{had wanted}} to write an episode about {{baseball}} for several years, Duchovny first conceived the basic premise for [...] "The Unnatural" [...] during the home run race in 1998 between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa when he read a newspaper report about Joe Bauman. Bauman was a baseball player who, despite hitting 72 home runs during the 1954 season—at the time, a record for a professional player—never {{made it to the}} Major Leagues. Duchovny immediately connected the story of Bauman, who played for the Roswell Rockets, with the 1947 Roswell Incident, saying [...] "I just made the association...What if <b>this</b> <b>guy</b> <b>was</b> an alien? and I just started working on that idea."
