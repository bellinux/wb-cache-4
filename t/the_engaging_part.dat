The stakeholder (the term "stakeholder" is used in Czech as well) is a subject, i. e. an individual or a corporate body, that {{is concerned about the}} result of the project and has the possibility to influence the project. The main goal of the thesis is to map the contemporary approaches toward the stakeholders analysis and management in the ICT projects, to analyze the problems of the influence of individual parts from both technocracy and human (psychological) point of view and to subsequently suggest the methodology for an effective analysis and management of <b>the</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>parts,</b> which could be used at the management of the projects in the ICT field. It is convenient to introduce the used terms and notions, their history and the way of use in the first part. There are dissect the known methodologies and tools used for the analysis and the management of <b>the</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>parts.</b> Subsequently, <b>the</b> stakeholders are systematically divide, it is accomplished their analysis from different perspectives and discussed mainly the aspects which can be crucial in the project management. The most common interests and motivations of <b>the</b> particular <b>engaged</b> <b>parts</b> are presented, including the influence and interest groups and the ways how to procure these parts for the aims of the projects. In the second part a research is described, which is carried out among managers of ICT companies and participants of ICT projects. There are elaborated some hypotheses on grounds of practical experiences from ICT projects and these are verified by this examination. The third part is focused on the presentation of the methodology for the analysis and the management of stakeholders in the ICT projects, which should serve the project managers for the stakeholders analysis and management in the ICT projects. Practical use of this methodology in the project of the SAP system implementation is described in the last, fourth part. This thesis completes relevant sources with the practical experiences at work on the projects in the ICT field. The effected research attested the original notion that this issue is relatively little known in the Czech Republic. The outcomes of this work could be of use for the project management in the ICT field...|$|R
50|$|A {{constant-mesh}} transmission {{offers several}} advantages over a sliding-mesh design. First, the dog clutch {{is designed for}} the task, rather than asking the gear to do dual duty of power transmission and sliding engagement. Second, the dog clutch is typically smaller in diameter than the gear it controls, so absolute speeds of <b>the</b> <b>engaging</b> <b>parts</b> are lower, aiding engagement. Thus, while a non-synchromesh transmission still relies on the operator to match speeds, gears are easier to engage. Third, a constant-mesh transmission can easily use helical gears which are smoother, quieter, and can carry more torque for a given size of gear. Fourth, a constant-mesh transmission can use synchromesh for easier shifting; while many heavy vehicle transmissions do not use it, most medium- and light-duty automotive transmissions do.|$|R

A model has been developed to predict the tool wear as observed on images. The major finding of the paper concerns the prediction of contact discontinuities at the microscopic scale on the tool rake face and where the wear process is highly localized. These discontinuities are attributed to the complex geometry of the rake face of the grooved cutting insert, designed especially to reduce the tool–chip contact area and to promote the chip breakage. The cutting force, specific cutting force and chip morphology parameters are also predicted and compared to experimental trends. This research work is a contribution for the tool wear prediction in rough turning to improve the tool life of complex cutting inserts at high material removal rate...|$|R

Metamorphic Testing (MT) first appeared twenty years ago in an effort to help testers facing the oracle problem (not having a mechanism to determine correct software behavior). Although MT is simple in concept, it has demonstrated very impressive fault-finding ability, and has recently been attracting a great deal of interest. Training students and practitioners to effectively apply MT has become an important goal, but to date, no textbook or guidelines have been made readily available. This paper, written by some of the leading voices in the MT community, is a sharing of some of the experiences, reflections and insights gained through teaching MT (and other related subjects). These experiences indicate that not only is MT effective in industry and at fault-finding, it has the potential to really engage students in creative SE classroom activities...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{a case of}} presenting information modelled in CERIF through an application-specific programming interface which does not require CERIF expertise by the developers. The CERIF data model is semantically rich {{and can be used}} for detailed description of entities of scientific / research activity. A sophisticated application interface is required to exploit the full range of CERIF capabilities. On the other hand, it is obvious that data about scientific-research entities are utilised by users and software developers with various level of familiarity with the CERIF model. Because of the diversity of CRIS systems’ users’ knowledge of CERIF, in certain cases it is useful to create an additional application interface with elements of some simple model which can be easily understood and used by users with low level or without any knowledge of CERIF. The article presents the design and implementation of a wrapper that enables bidirectional conversion of entered data using a simple model application interface to a CERIF back-end {{and the use of the}} wrapper in <b>the</b> <b>ENGAGE</b> project as <b>part</b> of an open infrastructure for Public Sector Information...|$|R

In one study, conducted by myself and my associates then at Stanford University, functional Mag-netic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans were taken of Ocean’s brain as he sketched drawings of faces; in another study, con-ducted by Miall of the University of Oxford and Tchalenko of Camberwell College of Arts, the same artist’s eye and hand movements were monitored as he drew a sketch of a model. In both instances, Ocean’s brain and eye/hand movements were contrasted with those of novice artists. In the brain scan procedure, the artist showed activation of {{an area of the}} brain that is implicated in facial processing; somewhat surprisingly, however, his activity level appeared to be less than that of the novice. Also, it appeared that <b>the</b> artist <b>engaged</b> <b>parts</b> of <b>the</b> brain that dealt with “higher order cogni-tion. ” In the eye movement proce-dure, Miall and Tchalenko found that the fixations of the artist while drawing were twice the du-ration of those when he was not, and that his patterns of cerebral activity (and other patterns) dif-fered from those of novice paint-ers. Other differences were noted between Ocean’s hand move-ments and those of novice artists. Taken together, these results shed important insights into the cerebral, visual and motor performance of a professional artist.
