5|$|Lysacek {{ended his}} season {{by winning the}} bronze medal at the 2006 World Championships in Calgary, Alberta. He was once again troubled by illness, having been {{administered}} three different antibiotics to fight a bacterial infection, which at one point, caused him to cough up blood. He rose from seventh place in the short to finish third on <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> free-skating program. After the World Championships, Lysacek toured with Champions on Ice as a full member of the cast.|$|E
5|$|On November 6, 1860, Lincoln {{was elected}} the 16th {{president}} of the United States, beating Douglas, Breckinridge, and Bell. He was the first president from the Republican Party. His victory was entirely due to <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> support in the North and West; no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states, and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states.|$|E
5|$|Through <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> reputation, Hitchcock cast Leigh for {{a quarter}} of her usual fee, paying only $25,000 (in the 1967 book Hitchcock/Truffaut, Hitchcock said that Leigh owed Paramount one final film on her seven-year {{contract}} which she had signed in 1953). His first choice, Leigh agreed after having only read the novel and making no inquiry into her salary. Her co-star, Anthony Perkins, agreed to $40,000. Both stars were experienced and proven box-office draws.|$|E
50|$|James Harris (born 18 August 1933) is an English former {{professional}} footballer who played as a forward for Everton and Birmingham City in the First Division. <b>The</b> <b>strengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> game were his pace {{and a clear}} eye for goal.|$|R

50|$|His {{published}} work on insects reflects <b>the</b> <b>strengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> collection but not its extent. In 1938, for instance, he presented more than 2,500 specimens to the Natural History Museum, London. These {{are described in}} the catalogue of acquisitions Rhopalocera (Levant and Balkans). There are a few specimens, including an excellent series of Archon apollinus in the Ulster Museum, Belfast.|$|R
5|$|Work on The Simpsons {{involved}} an irregular schedule. The producers laid off the animation staff for two-to-three-month periods, and rehired the staff {{later in the}} production cycle. During one of these layoffs, Povenmire found a temporary job on the series Rocko's Modern Life, Nickelodeon's first in-house cartoon production. The show's creator, television newcomer Joe Murray, hired Povenmire solely on <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Life is a Fish comic strips, which proved he could both write and draw.|$|E
5|$|Deacon {{grew up in}} Oadby, Leicestershire, playing bass in a local band, The Opposition, {{before moving}} to study {{electronics}} in Chelsea College, London. He joined Queen in 1971 on <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> musical and electronic skills, particularly the home-made Deacy Amp which guitarist Brian May used to create guitar orchestras throughout Queen's career. From the third album, Sheer Heart Attack, onwards, he wrote at least one song per album, several of which became hits. As well as bass, Deacon played some guitar and keyboards on Queen's studio work, but was the only member never to sing on their records.|$|E
5|$|Following a brief {{interlude}} by Croatian writer Darko Macan, {{the series}} was then taken over by Brian Azzarello, once again hired on <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own series for Vertigo, 100 Bullets. Azzarello's run is one large meta-story, that follows John Constantine on a trip across America, starting with his incarceration in prison, then variously uncovering a pornography ring, catching a serial killer, taking on a Neo Nazi group before finally dealing with the architect of his incarceration, Stanley W. Manor, a thinly-veiled pastiche of Batman. Brian Azzarello did return {{for one of the}} five stories in issue #250.|$|E
50|$|F. R. Leavis, in The Great Tradition, {{described}} {{the book as}} essentially a moral fable, and that 'of all Dickens' works (it is) {{the one that has}} all <b>the</b> <b>strengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> genius - that of a completely serious work of art'. This, however, was a view which he later revised in Dickens the Novelist, which recognised that Dickens's strengths and artistry appeared fully in other works.|$|R

5|$|In Italy, German Generalfeldmarschall Albert Kesselring, {{unaware of}} what was {{happening}} in Germany, had been building up <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> forces. He was aided in this by the escape from Sicily of three divisions, which managed to cross the Straits of Messina without serious loss of men or equipment. In August, five infantry and two panzer divisions moved into northern Italy. After the loss of Sicily, Hitler amended the German plans, deciding to hold the Salerno-Naples area with five infantry divisions, while the 1st Parachute Division was ordered to the Apulia region.|$|E
5|$|On <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{performance}} for the Bees, Umbricht was promoted to the Pirates roster {{near the end of}} the 1959 season. He appeared in only one game, a 7–6 loss to the Cincinnati Reds. He pitched seven innings, giving up five earned runs while striking out three. Umbricht left the game in position for the win, as the Pirates were leading 6–5, but reliever Don Gross gave up two earned runs in the ninth inning for the blown save and the loss.|$|E
5|$|Perry was {{inspired}} to write the episode due to his interest in conspiracy theory literature, which he finds interesting but does not believe in. The Coast to Coast AM radio show featured in the episode also served as an inspiration, and its host Art Bell agreed to appear as himself. Guest star James Marsters was cast immediately after his audition {{for the role of}} Eric Swan, and although several of Millennium crew were fans of the series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, in which Marsters had a recurring role, Perry recalled none of them recognizing the actor during his audition due to <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> performance.|$|E

5|$|The next {{race was}} the Monaco Grand Prix, where Caracciola was again entered as a semi-independent. He ran fourth {{early in the}} race, but moved to second as Alfa Romeo driver Baconin Borzacchini pitted for a wheel change and the axle on Achille Varzi's Bugatti broke. Tazio Nuvolari, in the other Alfa Romeo, found his lead reduced rapidly as Caracciola closed in; with ten laps {{remaining}} in the race Caracciola was so close he could see Nuvolari changing gears. He finished the race just behind Nuvolari. The crowd jeered Caracciola: they believed he had deliberately lost for the team, denying them a fight for the win. However, on <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> performance, Caracciola was offered a full spot on the Alfa Romeo team, which he accepted.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the tutelage}} of John Toshack, Alonso's {{captaincy}} marked a resurgence of form for Real Sociedad. Toshack recognised Alonso's potential and invested much time in his young captain, creating a training method designed to improve his touch and control specifically for him. The team cemented its mid-table position in the 2001–02, finishing in 13th place. Alonso appeared consistently in La Liga with 30 appearances {{over the course of}} the season and also scored his first league goal, finishing with a season total of three. Real Sociedad's management changed again in the summer of 2002 with the arrival of Raynald Denoueix, but Alonso kept his place in the first team on <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> past performances.|$|E
5|$|While {{producers}} Broccoli and Saltzman originally sought Cary Grant for the role, they discarded {{the idea}} as Grant would {{be committed to}} only one feature film, and the producers decided to go after someone who {{could be part of}} a series. Richard Johnson has claimed to have been the first choice of the director, but he turned it down because he already had a contract with MGM and was intending to leave. Another actor purported to have been considered for the role was Patrick McGoohan on <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> portrayal of spy John Drake in the television series Danger Man: McGoohan turned down the role. Another potential Bond included David Niven, who would later play the character in the 1967 parody Casino Royale.|$|E
2500|$|Schapiro's {{entry into}} serious {{competitive}} bridge in Britain was delayed {{until the end}} <b>of</b> the war. <b>His</b> partnership with Terence Reese, which started in about 1944, was the basis <b>of</b> <b>his</b> most outstanding period as a player. He was also successful with other partners, the last of which was Irving [...] "Haggis" [...] Gordon. Schapiro's bidding in competitive situations was quite outstanding, and his commentary was featured in bridge magazine bidding competitions round the world. Bidding judgement and card-play in defence were <b>the</b> <b>strengths</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> game, relative to other experts.|$|R

5|$|As {{the reigning}} 200 m {{champion}} {{at both the}} World Youth and World Junior championships, Bolt hoped to take a clean sweep of the world 200 m championships in the Senior World Championships in Paris. He beat all comers at the 200 m in the World Championship trials. Bolt was pragmatic about his chances and noted that, {{even if he did}} not make the final, he would consider setting a personal best a success. However, he suffered a bout of conjunctivitis before the event, and it ruined his training schedule. Realising {{that he would not be}} in peak condition, the JAAA refused to let him participate in the finals, on the grounds that he was too young and inexperienced. Bolt was dismayed at missing out on the opportunity, but focused on getting himself in shape to gain a place on the Jamaican Olympic team instead. Even though he missed the World Championships, Bolt was awarded the IAAF Rising Star Award for the 2003 season on <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> junior record-equalling run.|$|E
5|$|Beshear's initial rise to {{political}} prominence was interrupted in 1987 {{when he finished}} third in a five-candidate Democratic gubernatorial primary election. The Beshear campaign's sparring with that of former Governor Brown, the second-place finisher in the primary, {{opened the door for}} political novice Wallace Wilkinson's well-financed campaign to achieve a come-from-behind upset in the race. For the next 20 years, Beshear practiced law at a Lexington law firm. His only foray into politics during this period was an unsuccessful challenge to Senator Mitch McConnell in 1996. In 2007, however, Beshear was drawn back into politics by the vulnerability of incumbent Republican Governor Ernie Fletcher, whose administration was under extended investigation by then-Attorney General Greg Stumbo, over violations of the state's merit system. In the 2007 gubernatorial election, Beshear emerged from a six-candidate Democratic primary – largely on <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> pledge to expand casino gambling as a means of further funding social programs like education – and defeated Fletcher in the general election. Beshear won re-election in 2011, defeating Republican David L. Williams and Independent Gatewood Galbraith. He was ineligible for re-election in 2015 due to term limits imposed by the Kentucky Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Born in Toronto {{with the}} surname Nudelman, Newman {{was the son}} of a Russian-Jewish {{immigrant}} father who ran a shoe shop. After studying at Ogden Public School, which he left at the age of thirteen, he later enrolled in the Central Technical School, studying art and design subjects. He initially attempted to follow a career as a stills photographer and an artist, specialising in drawing film posters. However, he found it so difficult to earn enough money to make a living from this profession that instead, he switched to working in the film industry itself. In 1938, he travelled to Hollywood, where he was offered a role with the Walt Disney Company on <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> graphic design work. However, he was unable to take the job due to a failure to secure a work permit. Returning to his native country, in 1941, he gained a job as a film editor at the National Film Board of Canada. He was eventually to work on over 350 films while an editor for the NFB.|$|E

5|$|Cleomenes, {{who was now}} {{confident}} of <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> position, began plotting against the ephors. He first recruited his stepfather, persuading him {{of the need to}} do away with the ephors. Cleomenes contended they could then make the ephors' property common to all citizens and work toward the achievement of Spartan supremacy in Greece. Having won over his stepfather, Cleomenes started preparing his revolution. Employing the men he considered most likely to oppose him (probably in an attempt to get them killed), he captured Heraea and Asea. He also brought in food for the citizens of Orchomenus—which the Achaeans were besieging—before camping outside Mantinea. This campaign exhausted his opponents, who asked to remain in Arcadia so they could rest. Cleomenes then advanced upon Sparta with his mercenaries and sent some loyal followers to slay the ephors. Four of the five ephors were killed; the sole survivor was Agylaeus, who managed to escape and sought sanctuary in a temple.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{played for}} Trinidad {{in the next}} Inter-Colonial Tournament, in British Guiana in 1922. Although in two games he scored only 45 runs and took four wickets, {{commentators}} considered his fielding in the covers to be exceptional, and he retained {{his place in the}} team largely as a fielder. Although Trinidad lost to Barbados in the final, the Barbados captain Harold Austin, who was also captain of the West Indies team, was impressed by Constantine. Mainly on <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fielding, Austin secured Constantine's selection for the 1923 West Indian tour of England; it was a surprising choice, as there were other candidates who appeared to have stronger claims. By this time Constantine was working for Llewellyn Roberts, a larger solicitors' practice which paid better. As his new employer's longer working hours restricted Constantine's cricket practice, when he was selected for the West Indies tour he resigned his position.|$|E
5|$|In Bloemfontein Spruyt {{worked as}} clerk of the Landdrost (1854–1855), {{and in that}} {{capacity}} he acted {{as secretary of the}} Volksraad on two occasions (September 1854 and February 1855), also filling in as Government Secretary. On <b>the</b> <b>strength</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> capacities Spruyt was appointed clerk to the State President in September 1855. Soon after, during the illness of Government Secretary Groenendaal, Spruyt again took up that position. In October 1856 he was appointed to the vacancy and succeeded J. Groenendaal as Government Secretary of the Orange Free State. Spruyt was regarded by his colleagues as an accurate civil servant, but as a lesser politician and statesman, reason that he was not appointed Acting State President when State President Boshoff went on leave in 1858. However, Boshoff trusted Spruyt fully, and he allowed him to represent the presidency in meetings of the Volksraad on several occasions in 1861 and 1862.|$|E
