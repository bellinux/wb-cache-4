25|$|At 10:00pm on Saturday, the King and Queen Sirikit, {{with the}} help of a {{hydraulic}} <b>tappet,</b> set light to a 40m (130ft) high funeral pyre. The $5.7m (£3.8m) temporary royal crematorium, a complex of pavilions constructed on the Sanam Luang parade ground over seven months, had been lavishly decorated with flowers, garlands and carved banana stalks. After the cremation, the funeral buildings will be torn down, as they are sombre reminders of a royal death. According to Hindu belief, it is said that the spirit of the princess will then return home to Mount Meru, where all deities eternally live.|$|E
2500|$|The signal boxes use to {{two types}} of frame, both {{manufactured}} at the GWR signal works in [...] The older frames are the 1892 developed Stud frame, which replaced the original twist frames. It operates {{in a similar manner}} to <b>tappet</b> locking except that the blades are curved. The remained signal boxes use 5-bar <b>tappet</b> locking frames dating from the 1930s. Power supply within the boxes is standard 110-volt AC, 50Hz, derived via transformer from the standard UK/EU 230-volts AC individual supplies. Inside the box, most voltages are DC, with standras derived from those in operations during British Railways ownership of the line.|$|E
2500|$|Car Talk is a Peabody Award-winning {{radio talk}} show {{broadcast}} weekly on NPR stations and elsewhere. Its subjects were automobiles and automotive repair, discussed often in a humorous way. It was hosted by brothers Tom and Ray Magliozzi, known also as [...] "Click and Clack, the <b>Tappet</b> Brothers". [...] The show was produced from 1977 to October 2012, when the Magliozzi brothers retired. [...] Edited reruns (which are introduced as The Best of Car Talk) continued to be available for weekly airing on NPR's national schedule up through September 30, 2017, though some NPR affiliates have continued to broadcast reruns. Past episodes are otherwise available in a podcast format.|$|E
50|$|They have a DOHC {{valvetrain}} configuration with hydraulic <b>tappets,</b> driving four valves per cylinder. Exceptions are the 1.4 12V unit, {{also with}} hydraulic <b>tappets</b> but a SOHC valvetrain, driving three valves per cylinder, and the 1.9 8V and 2.4 10V turbodiesels, with a SOHC valvetrain with mechanical <b>tappets,</b> driving two valves per cylinder. Some versions have {{variable valve timing}} (VVT). The camshafts are toothed belt-driven. The 1750 TBi gasoline and 16V Multijet diesel engines feature hydraulic <b>tappets</b> with roller rocker arms.|$|R
50|$|The top end also {{featured}} adjustable <b>tappets</b> using the bucket and shim arrangement, and required checking every 25000 mi, although later (1990-) models had self-adjusting hydraulic <b>tappets.</b>|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic <b>tappets</b> {{require more}} complex and more {{expensive}} cylinder head design. A number of subcompact car manufacturers prefer solid valve lifters due to lower design and production cost rather than hydraulic <b>tappets.</b>|$|R
2500|$|After the RAF investigative board {{completed}} its {{report on the}} Halifax crash on 1 July 1942, it was distributed to a restricted list of approved recipients, but not publicly divulged. In the interests of wartime secrecy, the announcement of Blumlein's death was not made for another three years. The investigative board, headed by AIB Chief Inspector Vernon Brown – who later also investigated the post-war Star Tiger and Star Ariel disappearances – and assisted by Rolls-Royce, {{who had made the}} Halifax's Merlin engines, found that the crash was caused by engine fire, attributed to the unscrewing of a <b>tappet</b> nut on the starboard outer engine, which had been improperly tightened by an RAF engine fitter while inspecting the engine some three hours prior to the crash.|$|E
2500|$|The Magliozzis {{operated}} a do-it-yourself garage {{together in the}} 1970s which became more of a conventional repair shop in the 1980s. Ray continued to have {{a hand in the}} day-to-day operations of the shop for years, while his brother Tom semi-retired, often joking on Car Talk about his distaste for doing [...] "actual work". The show's offices were located near their shop at the corner of JFK Street and Brattle Street in Harvard Square, marked as [...] "Dewey, Cheetham & Howe", the imaginary law firm to which they referred on-air. DC doubled as the business name of <b>Tappet</b> Brothers Associates, the corporation established to manage the business end of Car Talk. Initially a joke, the company was incorporated after the show expanded from a single station to national syndication.|$|E
2500|$|A {{recurring}} feature was [...] "Stump the Chumps," [...] {{in which}} the hosts revisited a caller from a previous show to determine the accuracy and the effect, if any, of their advice. A similar feature began in May 2001, [...] "Where Are They Now, Tommy?" [...] It began with a comical musical theme with a sputtering, backfiring car engine and a horn as a backdrop. [...] Tom then announced who the previous caller was, followed by a short replay of {{the essence of the}} previous call, preceded and followed by harp music often used in other audiovisual media to indicate recalling and returning from a dream. [...] The hosts then greeted the previous caller, confirmed that they had not spoken since their previous appearance and asked them if there had been any influences on the answer they were about to relate, such as arcane bribes by the NPR staff. [...] The repair story was then discussed, followed by a fanfare and applause if the <b>Tappet</b> Brothers' diagnosis was correct, or a wah-wah-wah music piece mixed with a car starter operated by a weak battery (an engine which wouldn't start) if the diagnosis was wrong. [...] The hosts then thanked the caller for their return appearance.|$|E
50|$|Early <b>tappets</b> had rollers {{to reduce}} wear from the {{rotating}} camshaft, {{but it was}} found that the roller pivots wore even faster and also that the small radius of the rollers also tended to accelerate wear on the expensive camshaft. <b>Tappets</b> then developed plain flat ends, although these were slightly radiused as 'mushroom' <b>tappets</b> as a perfectly flat end led to 'slamming' against a steep camshaft face.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, Toyota and Volkswagen Group also used a {{directly}} actuated, SOHC parallel valve configuration with two valves for each cylinder. The Toyota system used hydraulic <b>tappets.</b> The Volkswagen system used bucket <b>tappets</b> with shims for valve clearance adjustment.|$|R
50|$|In contrast, {{desmodromic}} drive uses two cams per valve, {{each with}} separate rocker arm (lever <b>tappets).</b> Maximum valve acceleration being limited by cam-to-tappet galling stress, {{is governed by}} moving mass and cam contact area. Rigidity and contact stress are best achieved with conventional flat <b>tappets</b> and springs whose lift and closure stress is unaffected by spring force, both occurring at the base circlewhere spring load is minimum and contact radius is largest.Curved (lever) tappetsof desmodromic cams cause higher contact stress than flat <b>tappets</b> for the same lift profile, thereby limiting rate of lift and closure.|$|R

50|$|A much-improved system {{placed the}} shims above the <b>tappet.</b> This allowed each shim {{to be changed}} without {{removing}} either the <b>tappet</b> or camshaft, usually by pressing the <b>tappet</b> and valve down against the valve spring with a lever tool and removing the shim with tweezers. A difficulty with this system is that the rubbing surface of the <b>tappet</b> becomes {{the surface of the}} shim, which is a difficult problem of mass-production metallurgy. The first mass production engine to use this system was the Fiat twin-cam engine of the early 1960s, followed by engines from Volvo and the water-cooled Volkswagens.|$|E

50|$|To provide long opening times, the bash valve {{normally}} incorporates {{some form}} of <b>tappet</b> mechanism. Rather than a valve that is held open by the piston directly, the valve becomes double-acting and is opened by the piston's impact {{at one end of}} the stroke and closed by a further impact at the other end of the stroke. The <b>tappet</b> and valve are commonly separate, allowing the valve to remain in a well-defined fully open position throughout the stroke, however the <b>tappet</b> is bounced around by the piston.|$|E

50|$|To reduce wear {{from the}} {{rotating}} camshaft, the <b>tappets</b> were usually circular and allowed, or even encouraged, to rotate. This avoided grooves developing {{from the same}} point always running on the same point of the camshaft. In a few engines, particularly small V8 engines with little space, the <b>tappets</b> were small and non-rotating.|$|R
