2500|$|Despot {{died after}} 9 p.m. on February 14, 1991, of {{a blood clot}} in his lung. He had {{appeared}} to have been in good health despite recent minor surgery. [...] "He was fine at five minutes after nine, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> by 9:25," [...] said Mrs. Despot, the former Pearla Tinsley (born 1928). [...] "He was feeling great and was looking forward to going back to the golf course," [...] she added.|$|E
60|$|While {{she drank}} Blinky moved {{backwards}} to the door, eyes glinting brightly into Pan's and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b>|$|E
60|$|And <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> {{again into}} the swaying trees, {{following}} the high-flung spoor which no other human eye could have detected, much less translated.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Is not he come home?' said Alfred. 'Oh, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>is!</b> <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>gone</b> to {{the merry}} orchard, {{breaking}} Sunday with Dick Royston! And by-and-by he'll be ill, and die, and be as miserable as I am!' And Alfred cried as Ellen {{had never seen}} him cry.|$|R
60|$|Wise. There is no Judgment {{to be made}} by a quiet death, of the Eternal {{state of}} him that so dieth. Suppose one man should die quietly, another should die suddenly, and a third should die under great consternation of spirit; no man can Judge of their eternall {{condition}} by the manner of any of these kinds of deaths. He that dies quietly, suddenly, or under consternation of spirit, may goe to Heaven, or may goe to Hell; no man can tell whether a man goes, by any such manner of death. The {167a} Judgment therefore that we make of the eternall condition of a man must be gathered from another consideration: To wit, Did the man die in his sins? did he die in unbelief? did he die before <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born again? <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>gone</b> to the Devil and hell, though he died never so quietly. Again, Was the man a good man? had he faith and holiness? <b>was</b> <b>he</b> a lover and a Worshipper of God by Christ, according to his Word? <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>gone</b> to God and Heaven, how suddenly, or in what consternation of mind soever he died: But Mr. Badman was naught, his life was evil, his wayes were evil; evil to his end: he therefore went to Hell and to the Devil, how quietly soever he died.|$|R
60|$|And <b>then,</b> when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone,</b> she leaped {{upon the}} letter. Her mind was still obscured; like the moon upon {{a night of}} clouds and wind, her reason shone and was darkened, and she read the words by flashes.|$|R
6000|$|The {{operation}} was deftly though breathlessly performed, {{and all it}} brought from Raymond was a sleepy: [...] "Aw--lemme sleep," [...] and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> again.|$|E
6000|$|Ralph {{stood beside}} {{him for an}} instant. [...] "Captain," [...] he cried, [...] "I am {{going to get a}} pail, and take some to Edna and Mrs. Cliff." [...] And <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b>|$|E
6000|$|His {{smile was}} a caress. Her breath caught, she {{smiled back at}} him fearfully. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b> In the {{editorial}} office was heard the banging of his heavy old typewriter--it was an office joke, Walter's hammering of the [...] "threshing-machine." ...|$|E
5000|$|Wealthy {{housewife}} and children's author Cathryn (Susannah York) {{receives a}} series of disturbing and eerie phone calls in her home in London one dreary night. The female {{voice on the other}} end, sometimes cutting in on other phone conversations, suggests mockingly to her that her husband Hugh (Ren√© Auberjonois) is having an affair. Cathryn's husband comes home, finding her in complete disarray. Hugh attempts to comfort her, but <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>gone,</b> and she sees a different man who is behaving as if <b>he</b> <b>were</b> her husband. She screams in horror and backs away, only to see her vision of the figure revert to her husband.|$|R
5000|$|United States {{airlines}} {{had been}} chosen instead of Asian airlines so as to maximize the shock toward Americans. The flights targeted were listed under operatives with codenames: [...] "Zyed", [...] "Majbos", [...] "Markoa", [...] "Mirqas" [...] and [...] "Obaid". Obaid, who was really Abdul Hakim Murad, was to hit United Flight 80, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> to <b>go</b> back to Singapore on another United flight which he would bomb.|$|R
60|$|This he {{consented to}} do, and the oath was taken with great {{ceremony}} in St. Paul's Cathedral, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> dismissed. <b>He</b> <b>went</b> {{off to one}} of his castles in the country, muttering deep and earnest threats of vengeance.|$|R
60|$|He {{held out}} his hand. As she, with {{manifest}} hesitation, not to say reluctance, touched it, a strange tremble passed over him, and his face, so deadly white, was moved as by a stroke of pain. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b>|$|E
6000|$|So he lay {{for a few}} moments. They {{saw that}} the mighty hand was on him. Just before the spirit parted, he opened his eyes, with a sudden light, as of joy and recognition, and said [...] "Mother!" [...] and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone!</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay," [...] said I, rising. I {{held out}} my hand from the shadow. I was startled myself by the white sympathy it seemed to express, {{extended}} towards him in the moonlight. He gripped it, and cleaved {{to me for a}} moment, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b>|$|E
60|$|They {{came back}} with shrill cries over the jutting {{shoulder}} of the house, flying darkly against the fading air. What birds <b>were</b> they? <b>He</b> thought {{that they must be}} swallows who had come back from the south. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> to <b>go</b> away for they were birds ever going and coming, building ever an unlasting home under the eaves of men's houses and ever leaving the homes they had built to wander.|$|R
60|$|It did {{not take}} Nappy Martell long to reach the cornfield; and from a {{distance}} the Rovers saw him rush around, first to one stack of cornstalks and <b>then</b> to another. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> fully {{a quarter of an}} hour, and came back looking decidedly worried.|$|R
5000|$|... "Music In The Morning" [...] was {{hosted by}} Oz Medina, who {{previously}} worked as 91X's Music Director and Afternoon Host from 1987-1993. <b>Then</b> one day <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone,</b> replaced by Matt Stone, no explanation given. Robin [...] "What's Up?" [...] Roth says she isn't privy {{to what happened}} to him.|$|R
6000|$|Spurring his mustang, {{the cowboy}} rode away. At {{the edge of}} the slope he turned in the saddle. [...] "I've got to drive in this bunch of cattle. It's late. You hurry home." [...] <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b> The stones cracked and rolled down under the side of the bluff.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b> Myles stood staring {{after his}} {{retreating}} figure with {{eyes open and}} mouth agape, still holding the ball of sheepskin balanced in his hand. Gascoyne burst into a helpless laugh at his blank, stupefied face, but the next moment he laid {{his hand on his}} friend's shoulder.|$|E
6000|$|... 'With that {{he strode}} {{down the hill}} to the corner of the Great Woods--Woods Corner, you call it now--to the very place where he had first landed--and I heard him moving through the {{thickets}} towards Horsebridge for a little, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b> That was how it happened. I saw it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{things did}} not go exactly as she expected. On the very morning after the {{departure}} of the engaged couple, there came a letter from Aaron, saying that <b>he</b> would <b>be</b> at Saratoga that very evening. The railway people had ordered him down again for some days' special work; <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> to <b>go</b> elsewhere, and not to return to Saratoga till June. [...] "But he hoped," [...] so said the letter, [...] "that Mrs. Bell would not turn him into the street even then, though the summer might have come, and her regular lodgers might be expected." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Leave {{things just}} as they are," [...] {{he said to the}} men in a tone of unnatural calmness, [...] "and fasten the door up again, and turn a table or {{something}} of that sort against it on the outside so that no one can come in. John, do you tell one of the grooms to saddle a horse and ride down into the town. Let him tell the head constable to come up at once, and also Dr. Holloway. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> to <b>go</b> on to Sir Charles Harris, tell him what has happened, and beg him to ride over at once.|$|R
60|$|WISE. There is no {{judgment}} {{to be made}} by a quiet death, of the eternal state of him that so dieth.

6000|$|Gyp nodded. She {{knew she}} was flushing, and, at that moment, with the warmth in her cheeks and the smile in her eyes, she had the sensation, so rare and pleasant, of feeling beautiful. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone!</b> Her father was {{slipping}} back into his stall; and, afraid of her own face, she touched his arm, and murmured: ...|$|E
60|$|There was a tense {{moment in}} which she found him, looking her in the eyes, strangely less ugly than she had supposed, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone,</b> rolling along on his beat with that air which all policemen must achieve, of having no {{feelings}} at all, and--as long as it behaves itself--no interest in the human race.|$|E
60|$|From that height {{they watched}} him {{ride through the}} mesquites, up over the river bank to enter the cactus. His mount showed dark against the green and white, {{and for a long}} time he was plainly in sight. The sun hung red in a golden sky. The last the watchers saw of Yaqui was when he rode across a ridge and stood silhouetted against the gold of desert sky--a wild, lonely, {{beautiful}} picture. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b>|$|E
60|$|There is a {{multiplicity}} of reasons. My reasons range from the exceedingly graceful beauty of a bonefish {{to the fact that}} <b>he</b> <b>is</b> the best food fish I ever ate. That is a wide range. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> the wisest, shyest, wariest, strangest fish I ever studied; and I am not excepting the great Xiphias gladius--the broadbill swordfish. As for the speed of a bonefish, I claim no salmon, no barracuda, no other fish celebrated for swiftness of motion, is in his class. A bonefish is so incredibly fast that {{it was a long time}} before I could believe the evidence of my own eyes. You see him; <b>he</b> <b>is</b> there perfectly still in the clear, shallow water, a creature of fish shape, pale green and silver, but crystal-like, a phantom shape, staring at you with strange black eyes; <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>gone.</b> Vanished! Absolutely without your seeing a movement, even a faint streak! By peering keenly you may discern a little swirl in the water. As for the strength of a bonefish, I actually hesitate to give my impressions. No one will ever believe how powerful a bonefish <b>is</b> until <b>he</b> has tried to stop the rush and heard the line snap. As for his cunning, it is utterly baffling. As for his biting, it is almost imperceptible. As for his tactics, they are beyond conjecture.|$|R
5000|$|Currently Adrian is {{preparing}} {{for the start of}} a new season of [...] "The Dispensable Bliss" [...] and preparing to shoot two pilots in which <b>he</b> will <b>be</b> the host of. to be the best actor and once he feels himself more stable in his acting career <b>then</b> might <b>be</b> <b>he</b> will <b>go</b> for either production or direction.|$|R
60|$|The {{burden of}} so many lives {{depending}} on him wore the youth down. He had {{his work in the}} office, which was done purely by effort of will: he had his barren passion for the church; he had three young children. Also at this time his health was not good. So <b>he</b> <b>was</b> haggard and irritable, often a pest in the house. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> told to <b>go</b> to his woodwork, or to the church.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And I {{have never}} {{forgotten}} the old days. I will not promise {{to come to}} your marriage, because it would not make either of us happy, but I shall wish you well. God bless you, Marie.' Then {{he put his arm}} round her and kissed her, as he might have done to a sister,--as it was natural that he should do to Marie Bromar, regarding her as a cousin. She did not speak a word more, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone!</b> ...|$|E
60|$|At {{last from}} {{the height of}} slope Wildfire appeared, looking back and down. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b> Slone plodded upward. Long before he reached that summit be heard the dull rumble of the river. It grew to be a roar, yet it seemed distant. Would the great desert river stop Wildfire in his flight? Slone doubted it. He surmounted the ridge, to find the canyon opening in a {{tremendous}} gap, and to see down, far down, a glittering, sun-blasted slope merging into a deep, black gulch where a red river swept and chafed and roared.|$|E
6000|$|She {{thanked him}} for this by a motion {{of her head and}} hand, not by words;--and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone.</b> How he managed to bid adieu to Mrs. Stanbury and her sister, or whether he saw them as he left the house, she never knew. In her corner of the sofa, weeping in the dark, partly proud and partly repentant, she {{remained}} till her sister came to her. [...] "Emily," [...] she said, jumping up, [...] "say nothing about it; not a word. It is of no use. The thing is done and over, and let it altogether be forgotten." ...|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, {{the rest}} of the family becomes obsessed with playing a game of Simon. Unable to move, even to eat or relieve themselves, Klaus rescues them by setting off a smoke bomb, causing both the Simon game and Klaus himself to disappear. Seconds later Klaus re-appears, {{fighting}} and killing a monster from another dimension. Klaus <b>then</b> says that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> for sixty years to him and asks how long it had been back at home.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Then,</b> when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>gone</b> from sight; {{when the}} solemn {{sound of the}} voices began to grow fainter in the {{distance}} {{like the sound of}} a storm when it passes away, his heaviness of heart and sorrow left him, and he began to listen to the shouts and cries and clanging of noisy instruments of music swiftly coming nearer and nearer; and then all round and past him came a vast company of youths and maidens singing and playing and shouting and dancing as they moved onwards. They were the most beautiful beings he had ever seen in their shining dresses, some all in white, others in amber-colour, others in sky-blue, and some in still other lovely colours. [...] "The Queen! the Queen!" [...] they were shouting. [...] "Stand up, little boy, and bow to the Queen." ...|$|R
