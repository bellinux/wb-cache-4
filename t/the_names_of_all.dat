The team is honored with a plaque listing <b>the</b> <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> players selected at the left end of the Wall of Fame. 11 members of the Centennial Team also have their own individual plaques on the Wall; those not otherwise included on the Wall are Manny Trillo, Jim Konstanty, and Pete Rose.|$|E

5|$|The design—effectively a {{frame for}} two scenes {{depicted}} through Rayner Hoff's marble reliefs and bronze statues—shows the prelude and the epilogue to war, depicting both {{the willingness of}} youth to answer {{the call of duty}} and the extent of the sacrifices which they made. In this, the work is not displaying a material victory, but instead a victory of the spirit. At the insistence of W. F. J. McCann, president of the Returned Soldiers' League, bronze tablets were cast to line the walls of an inner shrine, on which are listed <b>the</b> <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> South Australians who died during the Great War.|$|E

5|$|Both of the World Wars had a {{major impact}} on Stroma, which was only a dozen miles from the Royal Navy's chief base at Scapa Flow in Orkney. Six islanders died in each of the World Wars; <b>the</b> <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> twelve are inscribed on the island's war memorial, and during the Second World War as much as a quarter of the {{population}} was on war service. Adding to the island's economic problems, the introduction of the 11-plus exam in 1944 meant that all children over the age of 12 had to leave Stroma to complete their education at the secondary school in Wick. Because they could not commute between the island and Wick, they had to attend school as boarders, which incurred additional expenses for their parents.|$|E
5|$|During the 1980s, {{multiple}} tropical cyclones {{affected the}} state, of which six made landfall as hurricanes; three made landfall as major hurricanes. Hurricane Alicia {{is the most}} destructive hurricane of the decade, severely impacting the Greater Houston area. <b>The</b> <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> three major hurricanes that impacted Texas during the 1980s were later retired by the World Meteorological Organization. In contrast to the 1980s, during the 1990s only one tropical cyclone, Hurricane Bret, made landfall on the Texas coast. In the next decade five hurricanes would make landfall on Texas. Hurricane Ike, the second costliest hurricane to impact Texas, made landfall during the decade. Other notable systems include Tropical Storm Allison and Hurricane Rita.|$|E
5|$|In September 1937 the German {{government}} again {{requested that}} Lody's body be exhumed {{and moved to}} a separate grave. This proved impractical for several reasons; he had been buried with seven other men, each coffin had been cemented down and the lapse of time would make identification very difficult. Instead, the British Imperial War Graves Commission suggested that a memorial should be constructed {{in another part of the}} cemetery to bear <b>the</b> <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the German civilians who were buried there. The proposal met with German agreement and the memorial was duly installed. During the Second World War, Lody's original headstone was destroyed by misaimed Luftwaffe bombs. It was replaced in 1974.|$|E

5|$|Keith {{questions}} Veronica {{about whether}} or not she broke into the house, despite knowing her guilt. Jake and a county prosecutor tell Keith that they will get a judge's order and will return to prosecute Veronica. The supercomputer processes <b>the</b> <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the Castle members just as Keith hands over the surveillance tape to the county prosecutor. Logan tries to apologize to Veronica. One of the Castle members comes up and tells her that the organization videotaped her, and Logan assaults him. Veronica returns the tape to Jake Kane on the condition that he does not tell Keith about it. She sees in the newspaper that charges have been filed against Keith for tampering with evidence relating to Veronica's break-in, likely meaning that he will lose the votes needed to win the sheriff's election. She goes into a voting booth and votes for Keith as sheriff, walking away in pouring rain.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool were {{appearing}} in their third UEFA Cup final, both their previous {{appearances in the}} final in 1973 and 1976 had resulted in victory.

Remarkably, the club had been in the Fourth Division of the Spanish league system 11 years ago. As it was their first season in Europe, Alavés had commissioned a special shirt that was pink and bore <b>the</b> <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> their 'socios' (members) as a memento of their qualification for Europe.|$|E
5|$|The bulk of Eusebius's account {{deals with}} Maximinus. Maximinus {{took up the}} office of emperor in Nicomedia on May 1, 305, and {{immediately}} thereafter left the city for Caesarea, hurrying, Lactantius alleges, so as to oppress and trample the diocese of Oriens. Initially, Maximinus governed only Egypt and the Levant. He issued his own persecutory edict {{in the spring of}} 306, ordering general sacrifice. The edict of 304 had been difficult to enforce, since the Imperial government had no record of city-dwelling subjects who held no agricultural land. Galerius solved this problem in 306 by running another census. This contained <b>the</b> <b>names</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> urban heads of household and the number of their dependents (past censuses had only listed persons paying tax on land, such as landowners and tenants). Using lists drawn up by the civil service, Maximinus ordered his heralds to call all men, women, and children down to the temples. There, after tribunes called everyone by name, everyone sacrificed.|$|E
