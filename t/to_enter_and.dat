5|$|Although {{the rebels}} were {{defeated}} in Surabaya, rebel forces campaigning {{in the interior}} of Central and East Java had more success. The rebel campaign culminated in the fall of the capital Plered in June 1677. The king was ill, and distrust among the royal princes prevented organized resistance. The king fled west with the crown prince and his retinue, allowing the rebels <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>and</b> plunder the capital with little fighting. The rebels then withdrew to Kediri, taking the royal treasury with them.|$|E
5|$|Butterfly {{eggs are}} {{protected}} by a hard-ridged outer layer of shell, called the chorion. This is lined with a thin coating of wax which prevents the egg from drying out before the larva has had time to fully develop. Each egg contains a number of tiny funnel-shaped openings at one end, called micropyles; {{the purpose of these}} holes is to allow sperm <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>and</b> fertilize the egg. Butterfly eggs vary greatly in size and shape between species, but are usually upright and finely sculptured. Some species lay eggs singly, others in batches. Many females produce between one hundred and two hundred eggs.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the 20th century, the {{intersection}} was handling 30,000 drivers a day, from increasingly developed Cornwall, Newburgh and New Windsor. NYSDOT expanded {{the intersection}} with middle-turn lanes and overhead signs on all approaches. Many drivers still felt it was a confusing intersection and that the confusion slowed traffic down as much as the many cars' stopping <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>and</b> exit nearby businesses. In 2001 state officials said they had done everything possible to improve traffic flows through the Five Corners. Continuing congestion was attributable to insufficient or nonexistent planning.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began on}} Oryol (Eagle) on 7 November 1899 at the Baltic Works in Saint Petersburg. The ship was laid down on 1 June 1900 and {{launched}} on 19 July 1902, {{in the presence}} of the Emperor. While fitting out in Kronstadt in May 1904 in preparation for the installation of her armor, some temporary sheathing was removed that allowed water <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>and</b> sank the ship five days later. The water was pumped out and the ship refloated without incident. She was completed in October 1904 at the cost of 13,404,000 rubles.|$|E

5|$|Shaizar {{was seen}} as a {{strategically}} important site and the gateway <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>and</b> control inner Syria. The Arabs initially conquered Shaizar during the Muslim conquest of the Levant in 637. Due to its importance it exchanged hands numerous times between the Arabs and Byzantines, who regained it in 999. In 1025 the Banu Munqid tribe were given an allocation of land beside Shaizar by the ruler of Hama, Saleh al-Murdase. Over time they expanded their lands building fortifications and castles until Usamas grandfather Iz Al-Dawlah Al-Murhif Nasr retook it in 1180.|$|E
5|$|Some {{intraspecific}} brood parasitism occurs, and {{instances of}} unusually {{large numbers of}} eggs in a nest {{may be the result}} of females laying eggs in the nests of their neighbours. Such foreign eggs are sometimes recognised and ejected by females. The house sparrow is a victim of interspecific brood parasites, but only rarely, since it usually uses nests in holes too small for parasites <b>to</b> <b>enter,</b> <b>and</b> it feeds its young foods unsuitable for young parasites. In turn, the house sparrow has once been recorded as a brood parasite of the American cliff swallow.|$|E

He was allowed <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>and</b> leave the ghetto at any time, and his daughter was not required to live in the ghetto, even though other half-Jews were confined within the ghetto.

5|$|The river otter, {{a member}} of the {{subfamily}} Lutrinae in the weasel family (Mustelidae), is equally versatile in the water and on land. It establishes a burrow close to the water's edge in river, lake, swamp, coastal shoreline, tidal flat, or estuary ecosystems. The den typically has many tunnel openings, one of which generally allows the otter <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>and</b> exit the body of water. Female otters give birth in these underground burrows, producing litters of one to six young.|$|E

5|$|Transmembrane {{proteins}} {{can also}} serve as ligand transport proteins that alter the permeability of the cell membrane to small molecules and ions. The membrane alone has a hydrophobic core through which polar or charged molecules cannot diffuse. Membrane proteins contain internal channels that allow such molecules <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>and</b> exit the cell. Many ion channel proteins are specialized to select for only a particular ion; for example, potassium and sodium channels often discriminate for {{only one of the}} two ions.|$|E

During this, the Doctor learns that River is Octavian's prisoner, promised a full pardon if she helped capture the Angel. Octavian is killed by an Angel but this allows the Doctor and River <b>to</b> <b>enter</b> <b>and</b> secure the control room.
