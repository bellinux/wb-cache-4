5|$|The S-50 Project was the Manhattan Project's {{effort to}} produce enriched uranium by liquid <b>thermal</b> <b>diffusion</b> during World War II. It {{was one of}} three {{technologies}} for uranium enrichment pursued by the Manhattan Project.|$|E
5|$|The {{most obvious}} technology, the centrifuge, failed, but {{electromagnetic}} separation, gaseous diffusion, and <b>thermal</b> <b>diffusion</b> technologies were all successful {{and contributed to}} the project. In February 1943, Groves {{came up with the idea}} of using the output of some plants as the input for others.|$|E
40|$|The Martian valley {{networks}} and outflow channels provide persuasive evidence that large bodies of groundwater were present on Mars {{throughout much of}} its early geologic history. However, little attention was focused on how these volatile reservoirs may {{have responded to the}} thermal evolution of the early Martian crust. In this regard, one process that has likely been of critical importance to the subsurface hydrologic evolution of Mars is <b>thermal</b> vapor <b>diffusion.</b> Various aspects of the <b>thermal</b> vapor <b>diffusion</b> process on Mars are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{diffusion}} process on Si (0 0 1) {{in the presence}} of a 5 keV Ar+ ion beam has been investigated by monitoring initiation of ripple-pattern formation. The morphology of the surface obtained by scanning tunnelling microscopy measurements in ultrahigh vacuum were characterized using the height-difference correlation function. These measurements clearly show formation of nanostructured ripple patterns having wavelength ∼ 60 nm and height ∼ 0. 32 nm at 200 ◦C. The results demonstrate that ion beam induced and <b>thermal</b> <b>diffusions</b> cannot be treated as additive processes and the observed enhancement of surface diffusion requires lowering of activation energy that arises due to creation of ion-beam induced vacant regions. (Some figures in this article are in colour only in the electronic version) 1...|$|R
5|$|The liquid <b>thermal</b> <b>diffusion</b> {{process was}} not one of the {{enrichment}} technologies initially selected for use in the Manhattan Project, and was developed independently by Philip H. Abelson and other scientists at the United States Naval Research Laboratory. This was primarily due to doubts about the process's technical feasibility, but inter-service rivalry between the United States Army and United States Navy also played a part.|$|E
5|$|Pilot {{plants were}} {{built at the}} Anacostia Naval Air Station and the Philadelphia Navy Yard, and a {{production}} facility at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. This was the only production-scale liquid <b>thermal</b> <b>diffusion</b> plant ever built. It could not enrich uranium sufficiently for use in an atomic bomb, but it could provide slightly enriched feed for the Y-12 calutrons and the K-25 gaseous diffusion plants. It was estimated that the S-50 plant had sped up production of enriched uranium used in the Little Boy bomb employed in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima by a week.|$|E
5|$|Purnell became Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Materiel. He {{was also}} the Navy {{representative}} on the Joint Committee on New Weapons and Equipment, and, from September 1942, the Navy representative on the Military Policy Committee, the three-man committee that oversaw the Manhattan Project. Purnell helped coordinate {{the activities of the}} Manhattan Project with those of the Navy, particularly the navy's <b>thermal</b> <b>diffusion</b> research, and he helped provide scientists and technicians from the Navy for the project.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} new method for {{simulating}} crystal growth by energetic beam deposition. The method combines a Kinetic Monte-Carlo simulation for the <b>thermal</b> surface <b>diffusion</b> {{with a small}} scale molecular dynamics simulation of every single deposition event. We have implemented the method using the effective medium theory as a model potential for the atomic interactions, and present simulations for Ag/Ag(111) and Pt/Pt(111) for incoming energies up to 35 eV. The method is capable of following the growth of several monolayers at realistic growth rates of 1 monolayer per second, correctly accounting for both energy-induced atomic mobility and <b>thermal</b> surface <b>diffusion.</b> We find that the energy influences island and step densities and can induce layer-by-layer growth. We find an optimal energy for layer-by-layer growth (25 eV for Ag), which correlates with where the net impact-induced downward interlayer transport is at a maximum. A high step density is needed for energy induced layer-by-layer growth, hence the effect dies away at increased temperatures, where <b>thermal</b> surface <b>diffusion</b> reduces the step density. As part {{of the development of}} the method, we present molecular dynamics simulations of single atom-surface collisions on flat parts of the surface and near straight steps, we identify microscopic mechanisms by which the energy influences the growth, and we discuss the nature of the energy-induced atomic mobility...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{works on}} {{electromigration}} in microelectronics devices have been reviewed, and a multi-physics EM simulation method that combines electric, <b>thermal,</b> atomic <b>diffusion,</b> and stress analysis has been described. The proposed method {{can be used}} to predict the atomic vacancy concentration distribution and void formation in metals or alloys that are subject to current loading...|$|R
40|$|The group's CCN counter is described. It is a static, horizontal, {{parallel}} plate <b>thermal</b> gradient <b>diffusion</b> chamber. Examples {{of the application}} of the CCN are presented and include the CCN spectra measured during the winter of 1978 - 79 near Elk Mountain, Wyoming. Comparisons of droplet concentrations derived from upwind CCN spectra are covered...|$|R
5|$|The {{production}} plant commenced operation in February 1945, and as cascade after cascade came online, {{the quality of}} the product increased. By April 1945, K-25 had attained a 1.1% enrichment and the output of the S-50 <b>thermal</b> <b>diffusion</b> plant began being used as feed. Some product produced the next month reached nearly 7% enrichment. In August, the last of the 2,892 stages commenced operation. K-25 and K-27 achieved their full potential in the early postwar period, when they eclipsed the other {{production plant}}s and became the prototypes {{for a new generation of}} plants.|$|E
5|$|At the University of Birmingham in Britain, the Australian {{physicist}} Mark Oliphant assigned two refugee physicists— Frisch and Rudolf Peierls—the task {{of investigating}} {{the feasibility of}} an atomic bomb, ironically because their status as enemy aliens precluded their working on secret projects like radar. Their March 1940 Frisch–Peierls memorandum indicated that the critical mass of uranium-235 was within {{an order of magnitude}} of 10kg, which was small enough to be carried by a bomber of the day. Research into how uranium isotope separation (uranium enrichment) could be achieved assumed enormous importance. Frisch's first thought about how this could be achieved was with liquid <b>thermal</b> <b>diffusion.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tennessee Eastman {{was hired}} to manage Y-12. Y-12 {{initially}} enriched the uranium-235 content to between 13% and 15%, and shipped the first few hundred grams of this to Los Alamos laboratory in March 1944. Only 1 part in 5,825 of the uranium feed emerged as final product. The rest was splattered over equipment in the process. Strenuous recovery efforts helped raise production to 10% of the uranium-235 feed by January 1945. In February the Alpha racetracks began receiving slightly enriched (1.4%) feed from the new S-50 <b>thermal</b> <b>diffusion</b> plant. The next month it received enhanced (5%) feed from the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant. By April 1945 K-25 was producing uranium sufficiently enriched to feed directly into the Beta tracks.|$|E
40|$|Classical {{molecular}} dynamics (MD) simulations employing Brenner potential for intra-nanotube interactions and van der Waals forces for polymer-nanotube interface {{have been used}} to investigate <b>thermal</b> expansion and <b>diffusion</b> characteristics of carbon nanotube-polyethylene composites. Addition of carbon nanotubes to polymer matrix is found to significantly increase the glass transition temperature Tg, and <b>thermal</b> expansion and <b>diffusion</b> coefficients in the composite above Tg. The increase has been attributed to the temperature dependent increase of the excluded volume for the polymer chains, and the findings could have implications in the composite processing, coating and painting applications...|$|R
40|$|A {{resistive}} sensor array is presented for two dimensional temperature distribution measurements in a micromachined flow channel. This allows simultaneous measurement of flow velocity and fluid parameters, like <b>thermal</b> conductivity, <b>diffusion</b> coefficient and viscosity. More general advantages of measuring temperature distributions are the inherent compensation of heat losses {{to the support}} and the insensitivity to variations in the temperature coefficient of resistance. I...|$|R
40|$|Neutron {{diffusion}} length in reactor grade graphite is measured both experimentally and theoretically. The experimental work includes Monte Carlo (MC) coding using 'MCNP' and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) coding suing 'COMSOL Multiphysics' and Matlab. The MCNP code is adopted {{to simulate the}} <b>thermal</b> neutron <b>diffusion</b> length in a reactor moderator of 2 m x 2 m with slightly enriched uranium (^ 235 U), accompanied with a model designed for thermal hydraulic analysis using point kinetic equations, based on partial and ordinary differential equation. The theoretical work includes numerical approximation methods including transcendental technique to illustrate the iteration process with the FEA method. Finally collision density of thermal neutron in graphite is measured, also specific heat relation dependability of collision density is also calculated theoretically, the <b>thermal</b> neutron <b>diffusion</b> length in graphite is evaluated at 50. 85 ± 0. 3 cm using COMSOL Multiphysics and 50. 95 ± 0. 5 cm using MCNP. Finally the total neutron cross-section is derived using FEA in an inverse iteration form...|$|R
5|$|The {{biggest problem}} {{faced by the}} MAUD Committee {{was to find a}} way to {{separate}} the 0.7% of uranium-235 from the 99.3% of uranium-238. This is difficult because the two types of uranium are chemically identical. Separation (uranium enrichment) would have to be achieved at a large scale. At Cambridge, Eric Rideal and his team investigated using a gas centrifuge. Frisch chose to perform gaseous <b>thermal</b> <b>diffusion</b> using Clusius tubes because it seemed the simplest method. Frisch's calculations showed there would need to be 100,000 Clusius tubes to extract the desired separation amount. Peierls turned to Franz Simon, who preferred to find a method more suitable for mass production.|$|E
5|$|The gaseous {{diffusion}} process remained more encouraging, although it too had technical obstacles to overcome. By the end of 1943, Urey had over 700 people working for him on {{gaseous diffusion}}. The process involved hundreds of cascades, in which corrosive uranium hexafluoride diffused through gaseous barriers, becoming progressively more enriched at every stage. A major problem was finding proper seals for the pumps, but by far the greatest difficulty lay in constructing an appropriate diffusion barrier. Construction of the huge K-25 gaseous diffusion plant was well under way before a suitable barrier became available in quantity in 1944. As a backup, Urey championed <b>thermal</b> <b>diffusion.</b>|$|E
5|$|The liquid <b>thermal</b> <b>diffusion</b> {{process was}} based on the {{discovery}} by Carl Ludwig in 1856 and later Charles Soret in 1879, that when a temperature gradient is maintained in an originally homogeneous salt solution, after a time, a concentration gradient will also exist in the solution. This is generally known today as the Soret effect. David Enskog in 1911 and Sydney Chapman in 1916 independently developed the Chapman–Enskog theory, which explained that when a mixture of two gases passes through a temperature gradient, the heavier gas tends to concentrate at the cold end and the lighter gas at the warm end. This was experimentally confirmed by Chapman and F.W. Dootson in 1916.|$|E
40|$|The etching of SiO, in aqueous {{buffered}} HF solutions can be impeded or stopped {{through the}} application of an electric field. In CMOS fabrication, very low levels of light can cause the eff ct.

Based on the knowledge be-hind these techniques, etching the structure shown in Fig. 1 should occur isotropically, with only a modes...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{problem of}} {{diffusion}} and mass transfer in dual porous media is considered in a threephase framework. The solid phase {{is assumed to}} contain two distinct cavities filled with fluid. The porous mixture is composed of two overlapping media: the porous blocks and the fissure network. The fluid can transfer between the cavities due to fluid pressure difference. In addition, hydraulic and <b>thermal</b> <b>diffusions</b> take place through the mixture. A global understanding of mass transfer, diffusion and deformation is provided. The governing equations associated with these phenomena are presented for a mixture in thermal equilibrium. The finite element approximation of the governing equations is formulated and applied to the stability analysis of a vertical borehole. A parametric analysis is carried out to evaluate the influence of mass transfer on the pressure profiles of the fluids around the borehole. Permeable and a semipermeable boundary conditions are compared to predict the potential for failure of the wellbore under drained and partially undrained conditions...|$|R
50|$|Modeling radiant piping (also tube or loop) {{patterns}} with {{finite element analysis}} (FEA) predicts the <b>thermal</b> <b>diffusions</b> and surface temperature quality or efficacy of various loop layouts. The performance of the model (left image above) and image to the right are useful to gain an understanding in relationships between flooring resistances, conductivities of surrounding mass, tube spacings, depths and fluid temperatures. As with all FEA simulations, they depict a snap shot {{in time for a}} specific assembly and may not be representative of all floor assemblies nor for system that have been operative for considerable time in a steady state condition. The practical application of FEA for the engineer is being able to assess each design for fluid temperature, back losses and surface temperature quality. Through several iterations it is possible to optimize the design for the lowest fluid temperature in heating and the highest fluid temperature in cooling which enables combustion and compression equipment to achieve its maximum rated efficiency performance.|$|R

Uranium was enriched by the K-25 gaseous diffusion process until 1985; the plants were then decommissioned and decontaminated. A 235 MW coal-fired power station was included for reliability and to provide variable frequency, although most electric power came from the TVA.|$|E
5|$|The <b>thermal</b> <b>diffusion</b> {{process was}} based on Sydney Chapman and David Enskog's theory, which {{explained}} that when a mixed gas passes through a temperature gradient, the heavier one tends to concentrate at the cold end and the lighter one at the warm end. Since hot gases tend to rise and cool ones tend to fall, this {{can be used as}} a means of isotope separation. This process was first demonstrated by H. Clusius and G. Dickel in Germany in 1938. It was developed by US Navy scientists, but was not one of the enrichment technologies initially selected for use in the Manhattan Project. This was primarily due to doubts about its technical feasibility, but the inter-service rivalry between the Army and Navy also played a part.|$|E
5|$|Worn {{out by the}} effort, Urey {{left the}} project in February 1945, handing over his {{responsibilities}} to R. H. Crist. The K-25 plant commenced operation in March 1945, and as the bugs were worked out, the plant operated with remarkable efficiency and economy. For a time, uranium was fed into the S50 liquid <b>thermal</b> <b>diffusion</b> plant, then the K-25 gaseous, and finally the Y-12 electromagnetic separation plant; but soon {{after the war ended}} the thermal and electromagnetic separation plants were closed down, and separation was performed by K-25 alone. Along with its twin, K-27, constructed in 1946, it became the principal isotope separation plant in the early post-war period. For his work on the Manhattan Project, Urey was awarded the Medal for Merit by the Project director, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr.|$|E

5|$|Groves {{obtained}} {{permission from}} the Military Policy Committee to renew contact with the navy, and on 31 May 1944 he appointed a review committee consisting of Murphee, Lewis, and his scientific advisor, Richard Tolman, to investigate. The review committee visited the Philadelphia pilot plant the following day. They reported that while Oppenheimer was fundamentally correct, his estimates were optimistic. Adding an additional two racks to the pilot plant would take two months, but would not produce enough feed {{to meet the requirements}} of the Y-12 electromagnetic plant at the Clinton Engineer Works. They therefore recommended that a full-scale liquid <b>thermal</b> <b>diffusion</b> plant be built. Groves therefore asked Murphree on 12 June for a costing of a production plant capable of producing 50kg of uranium enriched to between 0.9 and 3.0 percent uranium-235 per day. Murphee, Tolman, Cohen and Tolman estimated that a plant with 1,600 columns would cost $3.5 million. Groves approved its construction on 24 June 1944, and informed the Military Policy Committee that it would be operational by 1 January 1945.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Thermal barrier coating (TBC) on {{the element}} for high {{temperature}} service, {{such as a}} gas turbine blade, has become an indispensable technology. In this study, adhesive strengths of plasma-sprayed CoNiCrAlY coatings were examined using an indentation method. In order {{to examine the effects}} of the spraying process on the adhesive strength of a sprayed coating, coatings were deposited by both atmospheric plasma spraying (APS) and low pressure plasma spraying (LPPS). The half number of CoNiCrAlY(LPPS) specimens were thermally aged for diffusion treatment. The load-displacement curves during the indentation were measured, and the delamination energy per unit area of delamination was estimated. The delamination load was high when the distance from an edge of a specimen was long, however the energy per unit delamination area was almost independent of the distance from the edge and was uniquely determined. The delamination energy of CoNiCrAlY(APS) and CoNiCrAlY(LPPS) coatings were found to be approximately the same. The delamination energy of CoNiCrAlY(LPPS) with <b>diffusion</b> <b>thermal</b> treatment was widely scattered as compared with foregoing two coatings, however the energy of the CoNiCrAlY(LPPS) coating with <b>diffusion</b> <b>thermal</b> treatment was found to be about three times higher than those of both CoNiCrAlY(APS) and CoNiCrAlY(LPPS) coatings. It was concluded that <b>diffusion</b> <b>thermal</b> treatment was effective in improving the delamination strength. The CoNiCrAlY(LPPS) coating with <b>diffusion</b> <b>thermal</b> treatment was also found to be effective in improving the fatigue fracture life of a thermal-barrier-coated material...|$|R
