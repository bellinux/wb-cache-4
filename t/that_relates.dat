40|$|Abstract This paper {{develops}} {{a framework for}} generating testing preorders <b>that</b> <b>relate</b> processes {{on the basis of}} their timing behavior as well as their degree of relative nondeterminism. The framework is then applied to two different scenarios. In the first, relations are constructed <b>that</b> <b>relate</b> processes on the basis of all timing considerations. In the second, relations are constructed <b>that</b> <b>relate</b> processes {{on the basis of their}} relative speeds. In both cases, alternative denotational characterizations of the resulting preorders are presented, and examples are given to illustrate the utility of the approach...|$|R
