40|$|Background. Text-based {{passwords}} {{continue to}} be the primary form of authentication to computer systems. To-day, they are increasingly created and used with mo-bile <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> <b>methods,</b> such as touchscreen qwerty key-boards, in addition to traditional physical keyboards. Aim. This paper aims to answer a foundational ques-tion for usable security: whether <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> <b>methods</b> af-fect password generation and password security. Method. This paper presents results from a between-group study with 63 participants, in which each group generated passwords for multiple virtual accounts using different <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> <b>methods.</b> Participants were also asked to recall their passwords afterwards. Results. One-way ANOVA across groups was per-formed on metrics including password length, amount of different characters, and estimated password secu-rity. The results showed significant effect of <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> <b>methods</b> on the amount of lowercase letters per pass-word across groups (F(2, 60) = 3. 186, p =. 048, η 2 p =. 066), and non-significant effect on the password length, amount of uppercase letters, digits or symbols. No sig-nificant result was found for the estimated password se-curity. The result of practical cracking attacks was also similar across groups. Conclusions. <b>Text</b> <b>entry</b> <b>methods</b> have effect on pass-word security. However, the effect is subtler than ex-pected. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{evaluation}} of <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> <b>methods</b> for tabletop displays given small display space allocations, an increasingly important design constraint as tabletops become collaborative platforms. Small space is already a requirement of mobile <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> <b>methods,</b> and these can often be easily ported to tabletop settings. The purpose of this work is to determine whether these mobile <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> <b>methods</b> are equally useful for tabletop displays, or whether there are unique aspects of <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> on large, horizontal surfaces that influence design. Our evaluation consists of two studies designed to elicit differences between the mobile and tabletop domains. Results show that standard soft keyboards perform best, even at small space allocations. Furthermore, occlusion-reduction methods like Shift do not yield significant improvements to text entry; we speculate that {{this is due to}} the low ratio of resolution per surface units (i. e., DPI) for current tabletops...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Text {{entry is}} {{special kind of}} human-computer {{interaction}} in one respect: it is a highly learned activity, and unlike some others {{it needs to be}} so. Writing is not an inborn or trivially acquired skill like pointing and reacting to simple stimuli. Because learning a writing method is expensive, users benefit from using the same method in different situations. We describe an architecture that supports text entry methods that follow the user from device to device. The architecture consists of a server and <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> <b>method</b> implementations that the server downloads from the Internet. <b>Text</b> <b>entry</b> <b>method</b> selection is based on user preference and input device compatibility. We use Java for implementing the text entry methods so that the same code can be run on different platforms. The server is not similarly platform independent.

40|$|Due to the {{emergence}} of SMS messages, the significance of effective text entry on limited-size keyboards has increased. In this paper, we describe and discuss a new method to enter text more efficiently using a mobile telephone keyboard. This method, which we called HMS, predicts words from a sequence of keystrokes using a dictionary and a function combining bigram frequencies and word length. We implemented the HMS <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> <b>method</b> on a software-simulated mobile telephone keyboard and we compared it to a widely available commercial system. We trained the language model on a corpus of Swedish news and we evaluated the method. Although the training corpus does not reflect the language used in SMS messages, the results show a decrease by 7 to 13 percent in the number of keystrokes needed to enter a text. These figures are very encouraging even though the implementation can be optimized in several ways. The HMS <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> <b>method</b> can easily be transferred to other languages...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} a {{substantial}} growth in interest in mobile text entry over recent years, among both researchers and users. Increasingly mobile devices {{are being used to}} perform text-intensive applications, such as text messaging, creating a demand for more efficient and easier to use text entry methods. Unlike for desktop computing, no single, standard mobile <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> <b>method</b> has emerged. The diversity of mobile devices makes it unlikely that this will ever occur. Thus, mobile text entry remains a very open area of research, providing a favourable environment for the development of innovative text entry methods. A necessary part of {{the development of a new}} mobile <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> <b>method</b> is a comparison of its performance with existing methods. Despite being complex and time consuming, empirical evaluations remain the best way to make these comparisons. A review of current best practice for the empirical evaluation of mobile text entry methods is presented, alongside a classification of existing mobile text entry methods. The results of an empirical evaluation of a new mobile phone <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> <b>method</b> called Fastap are reported. The performance of the new method, along with that of the T 9 and multi-press with timeout mobile text entry methods, was measured for the entry of four different types of text and with three different levels of user experience. The Fastap method was found to provide the best immediate usability among the three methods and its performance continued to improve as users gained more experience with it. Fastap also performed strongly in the subjective ratings. The results of the evaluation are very positive for the ongoing development of the Fastap interface.

Today, they are increasingly created and used with mobile text entry methods, such as touchscreens and mobile keyboards, in addition to tra-ditional physical keyboards. This raises a foundational question for usable security: whether text entry methods affect password generation and password security. This paper presents results from a between-group study with 63 participants, in which each group generated passwords for multiple virtual accounts using a different <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> <b>method.</b> Participants were also asked to recall their passwords afterwards. We applied analysis of structures and probabilities, with standard and recent security metrics and also performed cracking attacks on the collected data. The results show a significant effect of text entry methods on passwords. In particular, one of the experimental groups created passwords with significantly more lowercase letters per password than the control group (t(60) = 2. 99, p = 0. 004). The choices for character types in each group were also significantly different (p = 0. 048, FET). Our cracking attacks consequently expose significantly different resistance across groups (p = 0. 031, FET) and <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> <b>method</b> vulnerabilities.
