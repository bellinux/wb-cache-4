5|$|Frame Analysis: An Essay on <b>the</b> <b>Organization</b> <b>of</b> Experience (1974) is Goffman's {{attempt to}} explain how {{conceptual}} frames – ways to organize experience – structure an individual's perception of society. This book is thus about <b>the</b> <b>organization</b> <b>of</b> experience rather than <b>the</b> <b>organization</b> <b>of</b> society. A frame {{is a set of}} concepts and theoretical perspectives that organize experiences and guide the actions of individuals, groups and societies. Frame analysis, then, is the study of <b>the</b> <b>organization</b> <b>of</b> social experience. To illustrate the concept of the frame, Goffman gives the example of a picture frame: a person uses the frame (which represents structure) to hold together his picture (which represents the content) of what he is experiencing in his life.|$|E
