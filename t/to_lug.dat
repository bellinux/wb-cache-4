25|$|DJs {{have changed}} their {{equipment}} as new technologies are introduced. The earliest DJs in pop music, in 1970s discos, used record turntables, vinyl records and audio consoles. In the 1970s, DJs would have <b>to</b> <b>lug</b> heavy direct drive turntables and crates of records to clubs and shows. In the 1980s, many DJs transitioned to compact cassettes. In the 1990s and 2000s, many DJs switched to using digital audio such as CDs and MP3 files. As technological advances made it practical to store large collections of digital music files on a laptop computer, DJ software was developed so DJs could use a laptop {{as a source of}} music instead of transporting CDs or vinyl records to gigs. Unlike most music player software designed for regular consumers, DJ software can play at least two audio files simultaneously, display the waveforms of the files on screen and enable the DJ to listen to either source.|$|E
500|$|Lytle {{also stated}} that he was [...] "burnt out on touring" [...] and cited his fears over his drug and alcohol {{problems}} {{as a factor in}} the band's split, and in 2009 he expressed his preference for being solo, saying that he was [...] "a bit of a loner", and, referring to his former bandmates, stated: [...] "The main thing is not having four girlfriends <b>to</b> <b>lug</b> around with me all the time." ...|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers praised Ready at Dawn's {{solution}} for the controls and gameplay. Because the PlayStation 2 (PS2) controller has two analog sticks and the PSP only has one, GamePro stated [...] "the lack of a second analog stick could have been problematic but it's not." [...] Modojo.com similarly stated that {{despite the lack of}} a second analog stick, [...] "Kratos handles superbly on the PSP" [...] and that the weapon and magic attacks are [...] "mapped out perfectly around the PSP's control set-up." [...] IGN's Chris Roper even claimed the control scheme [...] "works better than on the PS2." [...] Roper further claimed that Ready at Dawn [...] "has done a stellar job of keeping Kratos' move set intact," [...] stating that [...] "combat is extremely responsive." [...] Matt Leone of 1UP similarly praised developers {{solution for}} the control scheme as well as the game's [...] "fantastic" [...] pacing. However, GamePro criticized the relative lack of variety in enemies. The puzzles were criticized, and G4 claimed that some [...] "are so maddeningly difficult to solve", while GameSpot's Aaron Thomas noted the lack of puzzles, claiming that it [...] "could have used more". GamePro also criticized the fact that [...] "You still have <b>to</b> <b>lug</b> boxes around to solve environmental puzzles". Kristan Reed of Eurogamer also criticized Ready at Dawn for cutting some puzzles, as well as cutting co-op play, multiplayer, dialogue, and characters.|$|E

500|$|Within ten years, over 200 {{bald eagles}} were visiting during winter and early spring each day, {{and the job}} of feeding them became more involved. To have enough fish to last through the winter, she would begin in August to {{stockpile}} fish scraps and freezer burned fish donated by her employer and by other local companies. The fish was sometimes supplemented by moose meat that Keene salvaged when she heard of a road-killed moose on the highway. She began feeding the eagles at about December 1 of each year, a job that took up to three hours' work each morning. Keene obtained permission from her employer to use a company forklift to move the large containers of stockpiled fish scraps and freezer-burned salmon, halibut, rockfish, cod, and herring out of the company's large freezers. She then transferred the fish by hand into barrels or garbage cans, which she loaded up in her pickup truck. Then she would drive the load to her motorhome, [...] about [...] from the Seward Fisheries plant, and cut the fish into fist-sized pieces to be thrown out to the eagles. If the fish was fully frozen, she would use an axe, chainsaw, or blowtorch to break the fish down into smaller chunks, or might even have <b>to</b> <b>lug</b> the large garbage cans into her motorhome to thaw. [...] "I don't know if anyone else would do this," [...] she told a reporter in 1986. [...] "My motorhome smells like fish. My yard is fish. My truck is fish. I am fish. It gets kind of gross sometimes, especially when you're handling a lot of slimy carcasses." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alternatively, the Ogam Tract credits Ogma mac Elathan (Ogmios) {{with the}} script's invention. Ogma was skilled in speech and poetry, {{and created the}} system for the learned, to the {{exclusion}} of rustics and fools. The first message written in ogam were seven bs on a birch, sent as a warning <b>to</b> <b>Lug</b> mac Elathan, meaning: [...] "your wife will be carried away seven times to the otherworld unless the birch protects her". For this reason, the letter b is said to be named after the birch, and In Lebor Ogaim goes on to tell the tradition that all letters were named after trees, a claim also referred to by the Auraicept {{as an alternative to the}} naming after Fenius' disciples.|$|E
2500|$|Link's {{images were}} always meticulously {{set up and}} posed, and he chose to take most of his {{railroad}} photographs at night. He said [...] "I can't move the sun [...] and it's always {{in the wrong place}} [...] and I can't even move the tracks, so I had to create my own environment through lighting." [...] Although others, including Philip Hastings and Jim Shaughnessy, had photographed locomotives at night before, Link's vision required him to develop new techniques for flash photography of such large subjects. For instance, the movie theater image Hotshot Eastbound (Iaeger, West Virginia), photographed on August 2, 1956 , used 42 #2 flashbulbs and one #0 fired simultaneously. Link, with an assistant such as George Thom, had <b>to</b> <b>lug</b> all his equipment into position and wire it up: this was done in series so any failure would prevent a picture being taken at all; and in taking night shots of moving trains the right position for the subject could only be guessed at. Link used a 4 x 5 Graphic View view camera with black and white film, from which he produced silver gelatin prints.|$|E

5000|$|Petersen {{is widely}} {{known in the}} cycling {{community}} for opposing complicated design and slavish prioritization of speed, light weight and racing-led fashion [...] - [...] over tradition, comfort and durability. The company specializes in bicycles intended {{for all sorts of}} riding outside of competition. In addition <b>to</b> <b>lugged</b> steel frames, signatures of this trend have included leather saddles, downtube or bar-end shifters in place of brifters, and the use of [...] "moustache" [...] and [...] "cruiser" [...] type handlebars.|$|R
2500|$|McLean {{was born}} in Sydney, Australia, the son of John Donald McLean, colonial {{treasurer}} of Queensland, Australia. He went to England where was educated at Eton College and made his first appearance at Henley in the Eton eight winning the Ladies' Challenge Plate in 1882. He went on to New College, Oxford where he rowed in the Oxford crew in the Boat Race five times between 1883 and 1887, winning the 1883 and 1885 races. He won the University Pairs for New College in 1885 and also Silver Goblets at Henley with his brother, Hector McLean. In 1886 the McLean brothers were beaten in {{the final of the}} Silver Goblets by Stanley Muttlebury and Fraser Churchill. McLean was Australia in December 1886 when he played a match for Geelong Cricket Club and then in India at the start of 1887, but returned in time to take part in his fifth boat race. During the race McLean's oar broke. Oxford were behind at Barnes Railway Bridge, but Cambridge moved into rougher water too far over to the Surrey bank and Oxford were expecting to push through when the disaster struck. Guy Nickalls, then in his first Boat Race, recorded [...] "Then, 'Ducker' McLean broke his oar off short at the button. With the station in our favour and him out of the boat we could have won even then, but 'Ducker' funked the oncoming penny steamers and, instead of jumping overboard as he should have done, we had <b>to</b> <b>lug</b> his now useless body along, to lose the finish." [...] At Henley the McLeans were again runners up in Silver Goblets to Muttlebury and Charles Theodore Barclay.|$|E

2500|$|Lugs {{used today}} on higher {{performance}} bicycles are investment cast (aka lost wax process).

[...] The tree is surrounded by ceramic and fired in a kiln, thereby melting the wax and setting the ceramic.

50|$|Tube sockets were {{typically}} mounted in holes {{on a sheet}} metal chassis and wires or other components were hand soldered <b>to</b> <b>lugs</b> {{on the underside of}} the socket. In the 1950s, printed circuit boards were introduced and tube sockets were developed whose contacts could be soldered directly to the printed wiring tracks. Looking at the bottom of a socket, or, equivalently, a tube from its bottom, the pins were numbered clockwise, starting at an index notch or gap, a convention that has persisted into the integrated circuit era.|$|R

50|$|The HB used a {{completely}} different suspension design from the HA, having double-wishbone and coil springs with integrated telescopic dampers at the front, and trailing arms and coil springs at the rear. Lateral location and anti-squat of the rear axle was achieved using upper trailing arms mounted at approximately 45° fixed <b>to</b> <b>lugs</b> {{at the top of}} the differential. Both front and rear could also be fitted with optional anti-roll bars. The HB set new standards for handling in its class as a result of the adoption of this suspension design, where many of its contemporaries stuck with leaf springs and MacPherson struts.|$|R
