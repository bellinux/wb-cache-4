5|$|Many of the tornadoes {{embedded}} in this initial squall line were weak, though several were strong and caused considerable damage. An EF3 caused major damage to homes in Coaling, Alabama, an EF2 and an EF3 caused major damage and a fatality near Eupora, Mississippi, and an EF3 caused heavy damage in downtown Cordova, Alabama, which {{was struck by}} a deadly EF4 tornado later that afternoon. One embedded cell that began in Cullman County, Alabama produced a long-tracked EF2 that struck the town of Hanceville, killing one person. <b>That</b> <b>cell</b> would go on to produce over ten tornadoes (mostly EF1s) to the northeast in Marshall County and another EF1 in Dade County, Georgia. The initial storms caused widespread power and telephone line outages across Alabama and Tennessee. This line of storms also caused some NOAA weather radio transmitter sites to stop functioning {{for the remainder of the}} outbreak. As a result, many people had no warning of approaching tornadoes later in the day.|$|E

40|$|Having {{the ability}} to control cell {{behaviour}} would be of great advantage in tissue engineering. One method of gaining control over cell adhesion, proliferation, guidance and differentiation is use of topography. Whilst it has be known for some time <b>that</b> <b>cells</b> can be guided by micro-topography, it is only recently becoming clear <b>that</b> <b>cells</b> will respond strongly to nano-scale topography. The fact <b>that</b> <b>cells</b> will take cues from their micro- and nano-environment suggests <b>that</b> the <b>cells</b> are in some way 'spatially aware'. It is likely <b>that</b> <b>cells</b> probe the shape of their surroundings using filopodia, and that this initial filopodia/topography interaction may be critical to down-stream cell reactions to biomaterials, or indeed, the extracellular matrix. One intriguing question is how small a feature can cells sense? In order to investigate the limits of cell sensing, high-resolution scanning electron microscopy has been used to simultaneously view cell filopodia and 10 nm high nano-islands. Fluorescence microscopy has also been used to look at adhesion formation. The results showed distinct filopodial/nano-island interaction and changes in adhesion morphology...|$|R

5|$|From 1870 to 1880 {{it became}} clear <b>that</b> <b>cell</b> nuclei are never formed anew but always derived from the {{substance}} of another nucleus. In 1882 Flemming observed the longitudinal splitting of chromosomes in the dividing nucleus and concluded that each daughter nucleus received half {{of each of the}} chromosomes of the mother nucleus: then by the early 20th century {{it was found that the}} number of chromosomes in a given species is constant. With genetic continuity confirmed and the finding by Eduard Strasburger that the nuclei of reproductive cells (in pollen and embryo) have a reducing division (halving of chromosomes, now known as meiosis) the field of heredity was opened up. By 1926 Thomas Morgan was able to outline a theory of the gene and its structure and function. The form and function of plastids received similar attention, the association with starch being noted at an early date. With observation of the cellular structure of all organisms and the process of cell division and continuity of genetic material, the analysis of the structure of protoplasm and the cell wall as well as that of plastids and vacuoles – what is now known as cytology, or cell theory became firmly established.|$|E

25|$|Although {{there was}} initial {{evidence}} of mesencephalic dopamine-producing cell transplants being beneficial, the best constructed studies {{up to date}} indicate <b>that</b> <b>cell</b> transplants have no effect. An additional significant problem was the excess release of dopamine by the transplanted tissue, leading to dystonias. Stem cell transplants are a main research recent target: {{they are easy to}} manipulate and when transplanted into the brains of rodents and monkeys, cells survive and improve behavioral abnormalities of the animals. Nevertheless, use of fetal stem cells is controversial. Some have proposed that such controversy may be overcome with the use of induced pluripotent stem cells from adults.|$|E
25|$|Tyrosine kinases play a {{particularly}} {{important role in}} cancer, and several agents that block their activity are now used as anti-cancer drugs, such as Imatinib or Gleevec. Among his contributions are the findings <b>that</b> <b>cell</b> surface receptors with tyrosine kinase activity signal across membrane by forming dimers when they bind to their growth factor activators. He discovered this in studies of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). He was also instrumental in understanding how the SH2 domain controls tyrosine kinase signaling by binding to phosphorylated tyrosines in activated receptors. One of the seminal findings in this work was his laboratory's cloning of Grb2 and other Adaptor proteins.|$|E

Before the continents formed, the only dry land on Earth would be volcanic islands, where rainwater would form ponds where lipids could form the first stages towards cell membranes. These predecessors of true cells are assumed to have behaved more like a superorganism rather than individual structures, where the porous membranes would house molecules which would leak out and enter other protocells. Only when true cells had evolved would they gradually adapt to saltier environments and enter the ocean.|$|E

40|$|<b>Cells</b> {{carrying}} mutations <b>that</b> {{activate the}} Ras/cyclic AMP (Ras/cAMP) pathway fail to accumulate in G 1 as unbudded cells and lose viability {{in response to}} nitrogen starvation.

In this study, we tested predictions made by this model. We found <b>that</b> <b>cells</b> with activating Ras/cAMP pathway mutations do not continue to divide after nitrogen starvation, show a normal decrease in steady state levels of START-specific transcripts, and are not rescued by removal of cAMP during nitrogen starvation. These findings are inconsistent with the idea that activation of the Ras/cAMP pathway prevents growth arrest in cells starved for nitrogen. Our finding <b>that</b> <b>cells</b> with an active Ras/cAMP pathway have dramatically reduced amino acid stores suggests an alternative model. We propose <b>that</b> <b>cells</b> at high cAMP levels are unable to store sufficient nutrients to allow return to the G 1 phase of the cell cycle when they are suddenly deprived of nitrogen. It is this inability to return to G 1, rather than a failure to arrest, which leaves cells at different points in the cell cycle following nitrogen starvation...|$|R
