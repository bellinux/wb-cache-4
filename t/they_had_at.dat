5|$|Nikephoros Melissenos was {{probably}} born circa 1045 at Dorylaeum, where {{his family had}} extensive estates. Through both {{his father and his}} mother, he was of aristocratic descent: his father belonged to the Bourtzes line, while his mother to the illustrious Melissenos family, which dated back to the 8th century and had produced several distinguished generals. Sometime before 1067, Nikephoros married Eudokia Komnene, the second daughter of the Domestic of the Schools John Komnenos and Anna Dalassene and sister of the future Byzantine emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118). <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>at</b> least one known son, who was named John Komnenos.|$|E

At this time he was criticised in Federal Parliament by Arthur Calwell for allegedly issuing a verbal order whilst commander of the 6th Division that no officer was to be commissioned unless <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>at</b> least attained an Intermediate Certificate. There was no evidence that such an order was ever issued, but the allegation reflected a suspicion that Herring was an elitist.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{intended}} to {{only be a}} one-year project, Cirque du Soleil was scheduled to perform in 11 towns in Quebec {{over the course of}} 13 weeks running concurrent with the third La Fête Foraine. The first shows were riddled with difficulty, starting {{with the collapse of the}} big top after the increased weight of rainwater caused the central mast to snap. Working with a borrowed tent, Laliberté then had to contend with difficulties with the European performers. They were so unhappy with the Quebec circus's inexperience that <b>they</b> <b>had,</b> <b>at</b> one point, sent a letter to the media complaining about how they were being treated.|$|E
5|$|Phase 2: Knowing {{that the}} Byzantine army was {{focusing}} on the Muslim right, Khalid ibn al-Walid launched an attack with his mobile guard, along with the Muslim right flank cavalry. Khalid ibn al-Walid struck at the right flank of the Byzantines left center, and the cavalry reserve of the Muslims right center struck at the Byzantines left center at its left flank. Meanwhile, he ordered the Muslims' right wing cavalry to strike at the left flank of the Byzantines left wing. The combat soon developed into a bloodbath. Many fell on both sides. Khalid's timely flanking attacks again saved the day for Muslims and by dusk the Byzantines had been pushed back to the positions <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>at</b> {{the start of the}} battle.|$|E

5|$|The Theatre outpaced 362 other Pepsi Refresh entrants, and was {{in first}} place {{by the middle of}} April. The RTC {{attributed}} its success in the contest to its use of social networking services, notably Facebook. The group considered moving to a digital projector with the forthcoming grant to replace the existing projector, an expected cost of $100,000. By late May, the group had won the April competition and was waiting for the Pepsi funds, before tendering a down payment on the Theatre, initially planned for June10. The closing date of the sale was pushed back to allow time to finalize the deal. In mid-June, the Playback Theatre planned a benefit for the RTC in which improv actors would perform skits based on audience members' stories of experiences <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>at</b> the Theatre.|$|E
5|$|The rank of {{each person}} was {{determined}} by how many divine generals <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>at</b> their disposal, and {{by the number of}} divine scriptures they had obtained. These divine generals were used to fight wandering demons that could bring misfortune or illness on someone. A person received their first general at the age of six years, and in subsequent ceremonies would be given more and generals and achieve a higher ranking until a full complement was achieved at the age of nineteen. Marriage would unite two sets of generals, thus giving a couple use of 150 divine generals. After marriage, further increases in ranking could only be achieved by religious achievement.|$|E
5|$|Ba {{asserted}} {{that he would}} not take orders from Americans. He also argued that sending the 13 M113 armored personnel carriers through the Cong Ba Ky Canal would enable the Viet Cong to retreat because it might take too much time. An argument broke out between Vann and Ba. Finally, Vann radioed Ziegler at the command post at Tan Hiep and told him to ask the commander of the ARVN 7th Infantry Division to order Ba to move toward Ap Bac immediately. Shortly afterwards, Ziegler returned with Dam's permission, and Ba was ordered to move his M113 carriers {{in the direction of the}} white smoke that was rising from the burning hamlet. The American advisers were quietly confident that Ba's M113s could turn the tide of battle; on previous occasions, Viet Cong fighters often fled from the battlefield as soon as M113 armored personnel carriers turned up. However, in contrast to previous engagements, Viet Cong commander Hoang had ordered the soldiers of the 261st and 514th Battalions to throw everything <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>at</b> the South Vietnamese, as retreat through the muddy rice fields would result in certain death.|$|E

5|$|Crusaders' {{arrival at}} Jerusalem {{revealed}} an arid countryside, lacking in water or food supplies. Here {{there was no}} prospect of relief, even as they feared an imminent attack by the local Fatimid rulers. There was no hope of trying to blockade the city as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>at</b> Antioch; the crusaders had insufficient troops, supplies, and time. Rather, they resolved to take the city by assault. They might have been left with little choice, as {{by the time the}} Crusader army reached Jerusalem, {{it has been estimated that}} only about 12,000 men including 1,500 cavalry remained. These contingents, composed of men with differing origins and varying allegiances, were also approaching another low ebb in their camaraderie; e.g., while Godfrey and Tancred made camp to the north of the city, Raymond made his to the south. In addition, the Provençal contingent did not take part in the initial assault on 13 June. This first assault was perhaps more speculative than determined, and after scaling the outer wall the Crusaders were repulsed from the inner one.|$|E
5|$|The initial Australian dispositions around Isurava saw the {{depleted}} 39th {{spread out}} in five entrenched company areas astride the track in between {{the northern and southern}} creeks that flowed into Eora Creek. Having left most of their entrenching equipment behind during the withdrawal from Deniki, the troops from the 39th had to dig-in with whatever <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>at</b> hand including steel helmets and bayonets. Their positions were constructed amidst an area of long grass, behind an abandoned garden, which offered good observation of the track heading towards Deniki. The 53rd Infantry Battalion was positioned further back at Alola, co-located with Potts' headquarters. A forward observation post had also been established on the Isurava ridgeline. The Australians maintained a patrol presence forward of their occupied areas. Throughout 24 and 25 August, as the Japanese force began pressing forward, patrols from the 53rd Infantry Battalion clashed with groups of Japanese in front of Isurava, {{and on the other side}} of Eora Creek around Missima. Potts, realising that Horii had launched a major attack, decided to deploy the 2/14th under Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Key to Isurava, using the 39th to screen their movement. The 2/16th, under Lieutenant Colonel Albert Caro, was bought forward to Alola, where it would be held in reserve. By the time the 2/14th Battalion had deployed, the Japanese were able to field a force of between 3,000 and 5,000.|$|E
