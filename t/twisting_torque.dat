50|$|Camber thrust is {{approximately}} linearly proportional to camber angle for small angles, reaches its steady-state value nearly instantaneously after {{a change in}} camber angle, and so {{does not have an}} associated relaxation length. Bias-ply tires have been found to generate more camber thrust than radial tires. Camber stiffness is a parameter used to describe the camber thrust generated by a tire and it is influenced by inflation pressure and normal load. The net camber thrust is usually in front of the center of the wheel and so generates a camber torque, <b>twisting</b> <b>torque,</b> or twisting moment. The orientation of this torque is such that it tends to steer a tire towards the direction that it is leaned. An alternate explanation for this torque is that {{the two sides of the}} contact patch are at different radii from the axle and so would travel forward at different rates unless constrained by friction with the pavement.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the possible time history profiles of the <b>twisting</b> <b>torque</b> between the supporting leg and the remainder of the body that will allow continued performances of the Fouetté turn. Simulations were performed using a model which comprised the supporting leg and the remainder of the body to find torque profiles that maintain the initial angular velocity so that the state after one revolution is the same as the initial state. The solution space of torque profiles was determined for various rotation times and coefficients of friction between foot and floor. As the time for one revolution became shorter the solution space became smaller and for a given turn time there was a lower limit on the coefficient of friction. As the frictional coefficient became smaller the solution space became smaller and for a given coefficient there was a lower limit on the turn time.

We show that the <b>twist</b> <b>torque</b> moment and the spiralization together give rise to a Berry phase governing the response of the SOT to thermal gradients, in analogy to the intrinsic anomalous Nernst effect. The Berry phase theory of DMI is computationally very efficient because it only needs the electronic structure of the collinear magnetic system as input.

40|$|In {{this paper}} two {{different}} approaches to design of strain actuated lifting surfaces are compared {{with each other and}} with a classical aeroelastic tailoring method. Piezoelectric actuation is accomplished by piezo-patches embedded in the wing's composite lay-up and piezoelectric ribs (piezo-ribs) placed spanwise. If the piezoelectric patches are isotropic in their plane they can not directly induce any twist effect in the wing. Thus, in this case, the wing can undergo twisting only as an effect of the coupling (due to tailoring and wing sweep angle) between bending and <b>twisting</b> <b>torques.</b> When piezoelectric patches are used, this configuration is not yet the most effective one. In fact, the largest electromechanical coupling coefficient, which is the one in the direction of the applied electric field, is not thoroughly exploited. On the other hand, piezo-ribs are able to induce not only bending but also pure twisting deformation and exploit the largest electromechanic coupling effect so they may provide the designer with a higher control authority. However, this kind of control involves larger weight. In this paper, aeroelastic wing performance for these different configurations is analyzed.

The instantaneous rate of descent varies based on parachute fly-out angles and geometric inlet area. Parachutes in a cluster oscillate between significant fly-out angles and colliding into each other. The former presents a sub-optimal inlet area and the latter lowers the effective drag area as the parachutes interfere with each other. The fly-out angles are also important in meeting a <b>twist</b> <b>torque</b> requirement. Understanding cluster behavior necessitates measuring the Mains with photogrammetric analysis.

The effect of tyre properties is studied using the tyre’s forces and torques that have been measured in several operating conditions. The main result is that extending simplified models with a realistic tyre model leads to a notable decrease in the weave stability and a stabilization of the capsize mode. This effect is mainly caused by the <b>twisting</b> <b>torque.</b> Different tyres and tyre inflation pressures have little effect on the bicycle’s stability, in the case of riding straight at a constant forward speed.

40|$|Axial {{twisting}} of {{the torso}} {{has been identified}} via epidemiologic studies as a significant risk factor for occupationally-related low back disorders. However, only recently have biomechanical studies been able to describe how twisting is accomplished {{through the use of}} the trunk musculature. These studies have been performed on subjects whose torso twists were performed in an upright posture. In this study, the electromyographic activity of ten trunk muscles was observed while 12 subjects performed twisting exertions in three different trunk postures. These postures included upright twisting, twisting while the trunk was flexed in the sagittal plane, and twisting while the trunk was flexed and rotated asymmetrically. In addition, twisting velocity and direction of motion were changed under the experimental conditions. Under upright twisting conditions, the <b>twisting</b> <b>torque</b> was generated easily and relatively efficiently through the employment of the oblique (internal and external) and latissimus dorsi muscles. When the trunk was flexed the activity of erector spinae muscles increased (about 10 – 15 %) while the external oblique activity decreased (about 3 – 5 %). Twisting while in asymmetric bent postures was accomplished with a reduction in oblique and latissimus dorsi muscle activities (approximately 5 %) while the erector spinae muscle activity remained elevated. The change in muscle activity needed to balance the torso during twisting while bending also increased the amount of lateral torque that was produced by the trunk. These findings suggest that studies observing trunk muscle activities and trunk loading while subjects were in upright postures should be interpreted with caution when evaluating the activity of the trunk during occupational activities. Since many occupational twisting tasks are performed in awkward, asymmetric postures, application of results from upright twisting studies might underesti...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This letter {{deals with}} the {{observed}} development of (false) twist in fibres subjected to a biaxial rotation-fatigue test. A simple theory in terms of forces and moments is presented from which both the torque and the rate (amount) of twist can be correlated with the viscoelastic properties of the fibre. In a recent paper of Calil et a 1 (1980) a theory was presented {{to account for the}} experi-mentally observed development of (false) twist in fibres subjected to a biaxial rotation-fatigue test. This theory is based upon an energy consideration, because, as the authors state: ‘the torque is easily explained by an energy argument, but more difficult in terms of forces and moments’. The theory neither permits the calculation of the angular dependence of the <b>twisting</b> <b>torque</b> nor the rate (amount) of twist. In figure l(a) a simpie method for fatigue testing by rotation of a bent fibre is shown. According to Calil et a 1 (1980) the deformation of the fibre is considered in a frame rotating with the same speed as the fibre; see figure l (b). In this frame the cross-section A remains stationary, but the end B is moved around a circle (without rotation of the cross-section itself) in a direction opposite to the original direction of rotation. There-fore: in this frame the deformation of the fibre can be considered as due to the super-position of two identical periodic pure bending deformations showing a phase difference of;r/ 2 rad. (FrGm these considerations it is dear that the amount of dissipated energy as mentioned by Calil eta 1 (1980) is too small by a factor two.) Alternatively the deformation j bi Figure 9.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of semi-flexible fibres in shear flow {{and the effect}} of flexibility on the swimming speed of helical flagella are investigated. High aspect ratio particles such as carbon and glass fibres are often added as fillers to processed polymers. Although these materials have high rigidity, the large aspect ratiomakes the fibres liable to bending during flow. Other high aspect ratio fibres that behave as semi-flexible fibres include carbon nano-tubes, paper fibres and semi-flexible polymers such as the muscle protein f-actin. Most theoretical studies assume that fibres are either rigid or completely flexible, but in this thesis fibres with a finite bending modulus are considered. A semi-flexible fibre is modelled as a chain of shorter rods linked together. A bending torque is included at the joints between the rods to account for the rigidity. In shear flow the simulation reproduces the C and S turns observed in experiments on semi-flexible fibres. The results for finite aspect ratio fibres predict changes to the period of rotation and drift between Jeffery orbits. The direction of drift for a flexible fibre depends on both the intial orientation and the fibre’s flexiblity. We also present a linear analysis of how small distortions to a straight semi-flexible fibre grow when the flow places the fibre under compression. These results are in agreement with our full simulations and the growth rates of the distortions to a straight fibre allow us to predict the most unstable mode at a particular flow rate. To allow for intrinsically bent or helical equilibrium shapes a second simulation method is developed that includes a <b>twisting</b> <b>torque</b> at the joints between the rods as well as a bending torque. Using this simulation we measure the period of rotation and orbit drift of permanently deformed fibres in shear flow and show that due to the asymmetry of a helix, shear induced rotation results in translation and orbit drift for both rigid and semi-flexible fibres. Bacteria such as Vibrio alginolyticus and Escherichia coli swim by rotating one or more helical flagella. Vibrio alginolyticus has only one flagella and changes direction by altering its sense of rotation. Experimental observations of Vibrio alginolyticus have found that backwards swimming is 50 % faster than forwards swimming speed however, previous numerical simulation results have shown only a 4 % difference for flagella of the same dimensions. We use our simulation to consider how flexiblity affects the swimming speed of helical flagella and show that for a constant angular velocity, difference between forwards and backwards swimming speed ranges between 0 - 23 %depending on the exact stiffness chosen. We explain the differences in swimming speeds of semi-flexible fibres by investigating the shape changes which occur and comparing them to the results for swimming speeds of rigid flagella of varying dimensions.

40|$|A hybrid nematic {{liquid crystal}} cell is a {{sensitive}} twisting power measuring device, since the homeotropic anchoring can be <b>twisted</b> without any <b>torque.</b> We observe {{the rotation of}} polarization for a light wave which propagates across such a hybrid nematic cell, doped with chiral ions. A DC electric field drags the ions inside or outside the optical twisting region of the hybrid cell. This results in a linear electrochiral effect. At large field, the quadratic effect from texture change and electrochemical effects are clearly separated. The diffusion constant, surface anchoring energy and flexoelectric constant are also measured...|$|R
5000|$|... "Wrinklewall" [...] slicks are now {{specifically}} designed for the special requirements of drag racing, being constructed {{in such a way}} as to allow the sidewall to be <b>twisted</b> by the <b>torque</b> applied at launch, softening the initial start and thus reducing the chances of breaking traction. As speed builds, the centrifugal force generated by the tyre's rotation [...] "unwraps" [...] the sidewall, returning the energy to the car's acceleration. Additionally, it causes the tyres to expand radially, increasing their diameter and effectively creating a taller gear ratio, allowing a higher top speed with the same transmission gearing.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to present {{investigation}} of the torque generated during drilling process. The torque acting on drill {{is the sum of}} three components: the cutting component, the torque attributed to ploughing at the chisel edge and the torque resulting from friction at the margin. A new model for calculating main cutting force is developed. The model is based on torque structure and applicable to <b>twist</b> drill. The <b>torque</b> structure is determined by experimental decomposition of the drilling process. The result of the simulation study has shown a very good agreement between the theoretical predictions and experimental evidence...|$|R
