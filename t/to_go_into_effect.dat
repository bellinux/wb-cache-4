5|$|An {{electronic}} {{toll collection}} system was proposed in 1990 where a motorist would create an account and use an electronic device which would be read from an electronic tollbooth; the motorist would be billed later. The multi-state electronic tolling system, E-ZPass, was planned <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> by 1998; however, implementation of the system was postponed until 2000.|$|E
5|$|The Stamp Act was {{scheduled}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> on November 1, 1765, {{but it was}} not enforced because protestors throughout the colonies had compelled stamp distributors to resign. Eventually, British merchants were able to convince Parliament to repeal the tax. By May 16, 1766, news of the repeal had reached Boston. There was celebration throughout the city, and Adams made a public statement of thanks to British merchants for helping their cause.|$|E
5|$|On December 21, 1928 President Coolidge {{signed the}} bill authorizing the dam. The Boulder Canyon Project Act {{appropriated}} $165million for the Hoover Dam {{along with the}} downstream Imperial Dam and All-American Canal, a replacement for Beatty's canal entirely on the U.S. side of the border. It also permitted the compact <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> when at least six of the seven states approved it. This occurred on March 6, 1929 with Utah's ratification; Arizona did not approve it until 1944.|$|E

50|$|On June 26, the Supreme Court {{partially}} stayed certain injunctions {{that were}} put on the order by two federal appeals courts earlier, allowing the executive order <b>to</b> mostly <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect.</b> Oral argument concerning {{the legality of the}} order will be held in October 2017.|$|R
50|$|Without new legislation, these {{provisions}} were <b>to</b> automatically <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> on January 1, 2013.

5|$|City {{officials}} announced on August 6 that Mayor de Blasio would {{push for a}} tax on wealthy New York City residents {{to help pay for}} necessary improvements in the subway. The proposal would tax New York City residents that make more than $500,000 and for married couples with incomes above $1 million. The proposal would raise between $700 million to $800 million, with $250 of it going for half-priced MetroCards for 800,000 riders at or below the poverty line, a shift from de Blasio's previous stance. <b>To</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect,</b> {{it would have to be}} approved by the New York State Legislature. This proposal was criticized by Governor Cuomo and MTA Chairman Joe Lhota for not providing money soon enough, the State Legislature does not go back into session until January 2018.|$|E
5|$|In 1966, Whitney and Thayer {{attempted}} to organize {{what would have}} been New York's first joint operating agreement (JOA) with the Hearst-owned New York Journal American and the Scripps-owned New York World-Telegram and Sun. Under the proposed agreement, the Herald Tribune would have continued publication as the morning partner and the Journal-American and World-Telegram would merge as the World Journal, an afternoon paper. All three would publish a Sunday edition called the World Journal Tribune. The newspapers would have maintained their own editorial voices (all three of which tended to be conservative). On paper, the JOA, which would have taken effect April 25, 1966, would have led to profits of $4 million to $5 million annually, but would have also led to the loss of 1,764 out of 4,598 employees at the papers. The Newspaper Guild, concerned about the possible job losses, said the new newspaper would have to negotiate a new contract with the union; the publishers refused. The day the JOA was supposed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect,</b> the Guild struck the newly merged newspaper (the Times continued to publish).|$|E

50|$|With the I-66 Inside the Beltway program, in {{exchange}} for paying a toll, solo drivers {{will be able to}} use the interstate during peak hours. Carpools and vanpools (with 2 or more people, until a regional change <b>to</b> HOV-3+ <b>goes</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> in 2020), transit, on-duty law enforcement and first responders will not pay a toll.|$|R
50|$|Chin filed {{a motion}} asking for {{clarification}} on what a bona fide relationship with someone in the United States means. This was in leading {{the fight against the}} travel ban imposed by president Donald Trump, after the Supreme Court allowed it <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> partial <b>effect</b> in late June of 2017. An expedited process was requested for the clarification.|$|R
25|$|Further {{enhancements}} <b>to</b> HSAs <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> in 2007. The {{combination of}} {{tax breaks for}} premiums and the health savings account {{as well as a}} tax subsidy to pay for the catastrophic insurance premium of lower income individuals has boosted the popularity of these plans. By April 2007, some 4.5 million Americans were enrolled in HSAs; more than a fourth of those were previously uninsured.|$|R
25|$|The ceasefire was <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> at 1200 hours 22 February 1973. At 1145 hours, the Communists {{opened a}} terrific {{bombardment}} on Paksong. By 1205 hours, the Thai troops were fleeing. By nightfall, PAVN troops {{had settled into}} the blasted village.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese {{mediated}} the conflict, and {{a general}} armistice was arranged <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> on January 28.

25|$|Although {{fighting}} stopped {{after the}} preliminary peace in 1735, the final peace settlement {{had to wait}} until the death of the last Medici Grand Duke of Tuscany, Gian Gastone in 1737, to allow the territorial exchanges provided for by the peace settlement <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E
25|$|As of 2016, the US is {{the only}} {{signatory}} that has not ratified the Protocol. The US accounted for 36% of emissions in 1990. As such, for the treaty <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> legal <b>effect</b> without US ratification, it would require a coalition including the EU, Russia, Japan, and small parties. A deal, without the US Administration, was reached in the Bonn climate talks (COP-6.5), held in 2001.|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} {{certified}} facilities operating on December 31, 1997, was about 4 {{percent less than}} prior <b>to</b> when MQSA <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> on October 1, 1994. Of the 369 closures just prior to October 1, 113 could be directly attributed to MQSA.|$|R
5000|$|The {{deal was}} {{announced}} Monday, {{the same day}} the government dropped its appeal of an injunction the union won against legislation that would have imposed an austere contract similar <b>to</b> ones that <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> last year for Alberta physicians and teachers.|$|R
25|$|Article VII of the {{proposed}} constitution stipulated that only nine of the thirteen states would have to ratify for the new government <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> for the participating states. By the end of July 1788, eleven states had ratified the Constitution, and soon thereafter, the process of organizing the new government began. On September 13, 1788, the Articles Congress certified that the new Constitution had been ratified by more than enough states for it <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect.</b> Congress fixed the city of New York as the temporary seat {{of the new government}} and set the dates for the election of representatives and presidential electors. It also set the date for operations to begin under the new government. This occurred on March 4, 1789, when the First Congress convened.|$|E

[...] The use of PDF417 symbols on container labels was introduced in Change Notice 4 to facilitate the demands of Unique Identification (UID) markings, which at up to fifty characters in length are too long to be represented with traditional Code39 linear bar codes.|$|R

25|$|In 1888, the Commission {{recommended}} electrocution using Southwick's {{electric chair}} idea with metal conductors {{attached to the}} condemned person's head and feet. They further recommended that executions be handled by the state instead of the individual counties with three electric chairs set up at Auburn, Clinton, and Sing Sing prisons. A bill following these recommendations passed the legislature and was signed by Governor Hill on June 4, 1888, set <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> on January 1, 1889.|$|E
25|$|In {{a period}} before 1979 {{the age of}} consent was raised to 16.

25|$|On 22 November 2012, {{incumbent}} President Felipe Calderón {{sent to the}} Mexican Congress a {{piece of}} legislation to change the country's name officially to simply Mexico. <b>To</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect,</b> the bill would have to be passed by both houses of Congress, as well as a majority of Mexico's 31 state legislatures. Coming within just a week before Calderón turned power over to then president elect Enrique Peña Nieto, many of the president's critics saw the proposal as nothing more than a symbolic gesture.|$|E
25|$|In late November 2016, the State of Texas, at Abbott's request, {{approved}} {{new rules}} that require facilities that perform abortions either to bury or cremate the aborted, rather than {{dispose of the}} remains in a sanitary landfill. The rules were intended <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect</b> on December 19, but on December 15 a federal judge blocked the rules from going into effect {{for at least one}} month after the Center for Reproductive Rights and other advocacy groups filed a lawsuit. On January 27, 2017, a federal judge ruled against the law, but the State of Texas vowed to appeal the ruling.|$|E
25|$|Although {{advice from}} the Prime Minister to the Queen is binding, she does have to officially accept or assent in order for it <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>into</b> <b>effect.</b> The Governor-General's office source said that no {{decision}} from Elizabeth II had been made yet as to whether Itelali's removal by Telavi would be accepted, and thus, {{at the time of}} dismissing Telavi, Itelali remained the incumbent Governor-General of Tuvalu. It is suspected the Queen deliberately chose to take time before officially accepting the advice in order to allow Itelali to remove Telavi. Once Telavi was removed his pending advice to the Queen becomes moot, and Itelali remained Governor-General.|$|E
