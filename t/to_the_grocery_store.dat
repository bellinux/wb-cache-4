5|$|Eladio escapes as he {{is being}} deported, killing a truck driver in the process. A {{clinical}} exam on the driver shows his death {{was caused by a}} rapid growth of Trichophyton — the Athlete's foot fungus. Scully brings samples of the fatal fungi to a mycologist who discovers that their abnormally rapid growth was caused by an unidentifiable enzyme. This revelation leads Scully to suspect Eladio of being an unwitting carrier of the enzyme, necessitating his immediate capture. Eladio, seeking to return to Mexico, meets with his cousin Gabrielle to ask for money. He works with a construction foreman for the day to make the money. Soledad comes after him, seeking to kill him, but finds the foreman dead. Eladio escapes in the foreman's truck and heads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>store</b> where Gabrielle works, spreading the fungal growth. The agents later confront Soledad at the supermarket, discovering another dead victim of the fungus.|$|E

500|$|Bans called Waller {{getting a}} new penis the most {{emotional}} scene she had to write, adding: [...] "I loved this story because I hate the idea that once you're old, your life is over. I hate when people treat their aging parents like old furniture {{they want to get}} rid of but have to find a place for so they stick 'em in the corner and forget about them." [...] Bans also commented on Heigl's character's storyline, writing: [...] "Poor Izzie. The girl's living with cancer, lost her best friend, impulsively got married and dragged her husband away to live in the woods. That takes a lot out of a person. I need to seriously recover on the couch for an hour after I go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>store</b> – I can't imagine the emotional and physical fatigue Izzie must be feeling right now. I think by the end of this episode, after Owen tells her that channeling her experience as a patient at Seattle Grace is undermining her strength as a doctor at Seattle Grace – she's wondering if she made a mistake. She's wondering if Alex and Derek and now Owen might be right – that she came back to work too soon. That she's not emotionally ready to be cutting into people yet. Because I think every doctor wants to believe all their terminal patients can be Izzie – but the odds tell another story." ...|$|E

30|$|Finally, <b>to</b> examine <b>the</b> {{effect of}} <b>grocery</b> <b>store</b> {{location}} on preferences, <b>the</b> two <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> situated in <b>the</b> suburban neighborhoods were {{considered as one}} and assigned as the reference category. Relative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>grocery</b> <b>stores</b> in <b>the</b> suburban neighborhoods, shoppers in the natural foods store were 7.86 {{times more likely to}} choose neither of the ground beef options, relative to option A. Even though this is not an entirely surprising finding, it also suggests that these consumers would be more difficult to convince concerning food safety technologies. In a similar result, shoppers in the store located in the urban center {{were also more likely to}} opt for neither of the two ground beef options, compared <b>to</b> shoppers in <b>the</b> suburban communities.|$|R
