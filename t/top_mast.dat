25|$|The barge Lady of the Lea {{was built}} of wood in Rotherhithe in 1931 by boat-builders Hyam & Oliver (who {{operated}} {{well into the}} 1960s) for the War Department, following the original plans of canal barges from a century earlier. She was built small enough to pass under the low bridges of the River Lea and Bow Creek in London and was originally tiller steered and stumpy rigged, without <b>top</b> <b>mast</b> or topsail. The bottom was built of pine (doubled up) and the sides of oak and elm with copper fastenings and brass knees. Unusually, the sails were white and not the normal russet colour (of other Thames barges). Her original tonnage and dimensions are not known.|$|E
25|$|Whereas 20th-Century square-rigged vessels were {{constructed}} of steel with steel standing rigging, prior vessels used wood masts with hemp-fiber standing rigging. As rigs became taller {{by the end}} of the 19th Century, masts relied more heavily on successive spars, stepped one atop the other to form the whole, from bottom to top: the lower mast, <b>top</b> <b>mast,</b> and topgallant mast. This construction relied heavily on support by a complex array of stays and shrouds. Each stay in either the fore-and-aft or athwartships direction had a corresponding one in the opposite direction providing counter-tension. Fore-and-aft the system of tensioning started with the stays that were anchored at in front each mast. Shrouds were tensioned by pairs deadeyes, circular blocks that had the large-diameter line run around them, whilst multiple holes allowed smaller line—lanyard—to pass multiple times between the two and thereby allow tensioning of the shroud.|$|E

25|$|The {{subsequent}} engagement lasted seven hours, with Bonne Citoyenne at {{a disadvantage}} early on, when three of her guns were dismounted.

He was made a Colonel of Marines on 28 April 1805, and was assigned to the fleet under Sir Robert Calder and took part in the Battle of Cape Finisterre on 22 July 1805. During the battle Buller found himself isolated {{from the rest of the}} fleet due to the patchy fog and failing light, and was surrounded by five enemy ships. He fought them off, forcing the Spanish 84-gun San Rafael to strike, and afterwards sending the Maltas boats to take possession of the Spanish 74-gun Firme. Malta had suffered considerably during the battle, having her mizzen <b>top</b> <b>mast</b> and mizzen sail yard shot away, and her mizzen and main masts damaged. Her rigging and sails were cut up, with her casualties amounting to five dead and forty wounded.|$|E

By good luck, we had towed the dinghy and the steamer held up Deva until we got on board. Then as we cut the painter the old boat broke away, and the steamer went on, over the top of her. I imagine she stopped, because we heard her whistle in the fog, but we'd had enough of her and pulled for the beach. We landed at Kingstown, and I think that's all." ...|$|E

[...] Away went Davy, and was soon halfway up the shrouds; but he went too fast, and had to stop for breath. Then he came to the mass of {{woodwork}} and ropes {{at the head of the}} lower mast.

40|$|On marine vessels, {{delicate}} instruments such as navigation radars {{are normally}} mounted on ship masts. However the vibrations at the <b>top</b> of <b>mast</b> where the radar is mounted often cause serious deterioration in radar-tracking resolution. The most serious problem {{is caused by}} the rotational vibrations at the <b>top</b> of <b>mast</b> that may be due to wind loading, inertial loading from ship rolling and base excitations induced by the running propeller. This paper presents a method of semi-active vibration control using magneto-rheological (MR) dampers to reduce the rotational vibration of the mast. In the study, the classical optimal control algorithm, the independent modal space control algorithm and the double input - single output fuzzy control algorithm are employed for the vibration control. As the phenomenological model of an MR damper is highly nonlinear, which is difficult to analyse, a back-propagation neural network is trained to emulate the inverse dynamic characteristics of the MR damper in the analysis. The trained neural network gives the required voltage for each MR damper based on the displacement, velocity and control force of the MR damper quickly. Numerical simulations show that the proposed control methods can effectively suppress the rotational vibrations at the <b>top</b> of <b>mast.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
