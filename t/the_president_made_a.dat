6000|$|On October 5, 1918, the German Government {{addressed}} a brief Note to the President accepting the Fourteen Points {{and asking for}} Peace negotiations. The President's reply of October 8 {{asked if he was}} to understand definitely that the German Government accepted [...] "the terms laid down" [...] in Fourteen Points and in his subsequent Addresses and [...] "that its object in entering into discussion would be only to agree upon the practical details of their application." [...] He added that the evacuation of invaded territory must be a prior condition of an Armistice. On October 12 the German Government returned an unconditional affirmative to these questions;-"its object in entering into discussions would be only to agree upon practical details of the application of these terms." [...] On October 14, having received this affirmative answer, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> further communication to make clear the points: (1) that the details of the Armistice would have to be left to the military advisers of the United States and the Allies, and must provide absolutely against the possibility of Germany's resuming hostilities; (2) that submarine warfare must cease if these conversations were to continue; and (3) that he required further guarantees of the representative character of the Government with which he was dealing. On October 20 Germany accepted points (1) and (2), and pointed out, as regards (3), that she now had a Constitution and a Government dependent for its authority on the Reichstag. On October 23 the President announced that, [...] "having received the solemn and explicit assurance of the German Government that it unreservedly accepts the terms of peace laid down in his Address to the Congress of the United States on January 8, 1918 (the Fourteen Points), and the principles of settlement enunciated in his subsequent Addresses, particularly the Address of September 27, and that it is ready to discuss the details of their application," [...] he has communicated the above correspondence to the Governments of the Allied Powers [...] "with the suggestion that, if these Governments are disposed to effect peace upon the terms and principles indicated," [...] they will ask their military advisers to draw up Armistice Terms of such a character as to [...] "ensure to the Associated Governments the unrestricted power to safeguard and enforce the details of the peace to which the German Government has agreed." [...] At the end of this Note the President hinted more openly than in that of October 14 at the abdication of the Kaiser. This completes the preliminary negotiations to which the President alone was a party, adding without the Governments of the Allied Powers.|$|E

Justice Bolt, the trial judge, observed that these inconsistent statements affected the main witness's credibility, and that other witnesses had also given inconsistent evidence. One of the charges against the defendants was dismissed because, although there was some evidence, it was clearly unreliable. <b>The</b> <b>President</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> statement saying that, if the judge had any conscience, he should resign. There were no further proceedings on the other charges, but the defendants remained in detention, because Banda said that lack of evidence was not proof of innocence.|$|E
