40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{evolution}} of norms regulating civil matters on <b>the</b> <b>found</b> property. According to the current law, the problem of storing <b>the</b> <b>found</b> property described in the article is {{in the fact that}} a person who <b>found</b> <b>the</b> property must choose himself whom to hand over the property for storage. The purpose of the study is to examine the evolution of legal norms regulating the obligation {{to ensure the safety of}} <b>the</b> <b>found</b> property and to suggest amendments to the current legislation. The analysis of the legal norms regulating the obligation to ensure the safety of <b>the</b> <b>found</b> property shows that in the civil law the first regulations of findings were reflected in the Roman law, but in the Russian legislation they were reflected in detail from the middle of the XVIII century, when the findings were regulated by orders of deputies given to them from the nobility of several provinces; from that time the finders face the choice as to whom to hand over <b>the</b> <b>found</b> property. Special actors involved in the search of the owner of the property are the policemen, but at the same time they are charged with the function not related to their main duties keeping <b>the</b> <b>found</b> things. <b>The</b> analysis proposes to make amendments to the legal norms related to findings in the legislation of the Russian Federation.   </p...|$|R
