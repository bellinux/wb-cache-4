Having divorced James Newman II in 1973, Knight married Barry Hankerson (uncle of future hip/hop, R&B singer Aaliyah), then Detroit mayor Coleman Young's executive aide. Knight and Hankerson remained married for four years, during which time they had a son, Shanga Ali. Upon their divorce, Hankerson and Knight were embroiled in a heated custody battle over Shanga Ali.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} 1042 reports of necropsies on {{children}} dying at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh was reviewed. In each case, note was {{taken of the}} status of the spleen, the lobation of the lungs, the arrangement of the bronchi, the morphology of the atrial appendages, and the presence of any congenital malformations of the heart and great vessels and of any malformations of the abdominal organs. There was isomerism of the left atrial appendages in eight (0. 77 %), 13 (1. 25 %) showed isomerism of the right appendages, and seven (0. 67 %) had multiple spleens without having isomerism of the atrial appendages. Unexpectedly, a normal spleen was found in one patient with isomerism of the right appendages and also in a patient with isomerism of the left appendages. In one patient with isomeric left atrial appendages there was no spleen. The review showed that the morphology of the atrial appendages, and hence the arrangement of the atria, is not accurately predicted by the type of spleen. The arrangement of the atrial appendages is the most reliable guide to the recognised combinations of congenital cardiac malformations previously described as "splenic syndromes". Because there is no certain way of predicting all the malformations in patients with complex congenital heart disease, it is advisable <b>to</b> <b>record</b> <b>separately</b> for each patient the details of lobation of the lungs, the bronchial and atrial arrangement, anomalies of the heart and great vessels, the type of spleen, and any abnormal arrangement of the abdominal organs...|$|E
40|$|Context. Betelgeuse is one {{the largest}} {{stars in the}} sky in terms of angular diameter. Structures on the stellar {{photosphere}} have been detected in the visible and near-infrared as well as a compact molecular environment called the MOLsphere. Mid-infrared observations have revealed the nature of some of the molecules in the MOLsphere, some being the precursor of dust. Aims. Betelgeuse is an excellent candidate to understand the process of mass loss in red supergiants. Using diffraction-limited adaptive optics (AO) in the near-infrared, we probe the photosphere and close environment of Betelgeuse to study the wavelength dependence of its extension, and to search for asymmetries. Methods. We obtained AO images with the VLT/NACO instrument, taking advantage of the “cube” mode of the CONICA camera <b>to</b> <b>record</b> <b>separately</b> a large number of short-exposure frames. This allowed us to adopt a “lucky imaging” approach for the data reduction, and obtain diffraction-limited images over the spectral range 1. 04 - 2. 17 μm in 10 narrow-band filters. Results. In all filters, the photosphere of Betelgeuse appears partly resolved. We identify an asymmetric envelope around the star, with in particular a relatively bright “plume” extending in the southwestern quadrant up to a radius of approximately six times the photosphere. The CN molecule provides an excellent match to the 1. 09 μm bandhead in absorption in front of the stellar photosphere, but the emission spectrum of the plume is more difficult to interpret. Conclusions. Our AO images show that the envelope surrounding Betelgeuse has a complex and irregular structure. We propose that the southwestern plume is linked either to the presence of a convective hot spot on the photosphere, or to the rotation of the star...|$|E

40|$|An {{optical system}} has been {{investigated}} to measure mass flux distributions in the inlet of a high speed air-breathing propulsion system.

A novel anamorphic optical collection system is used which allows optical rays from different scattering angles, that have different Doppler shifts, <b>to</b> be <b>recorded</b> <b>separately.</b> This is shown to obviate the need to tune the laser through the absorption to determine velocities, while retaining the ability to make spatially-resolved measurements along a line. By properly selecting the laser tuning and filter parameters, simultaneous density measurements can be made.

Korn recorded most of the album with all members playing simultaneously, as opposed <b>to</b> <b>recording</b> instruments <b>separately.</b> The [...] "distinctive" [...] sound and quality of music was given off by their instruments, rather than the production.

50|$|In {{the period}} from 1950 to the mid-1960s, studio musicians and composers were also heavily {{dependent}} on magnetic tape to realize their works. The limitations of existing electronic music components meant {{that in many cases}} each note or tone had <b>to</b> be <b>recorded</b> <b>separately,</b> with changes in pitch often achieved by speeding up or slowing down the tape, and then splicing or overdubbing the result into the master tape. These tape-recorded electronic works could be extremely laborious and time-consuming to create—according to the 1967 Moog 900 Series demonstration record, such recordings could have as many as eight edits per inch of tape. The key technological development that {{led to the creation of}} the Moog synthesizer was the invention of the transistor, which enabled researchers like Moog to build electronic music systems that were considerably smaller, cheaper, consumed far less power, and were far more reliable than earlier systems, which depended on the older vacuum tube technology.|$|R

50|$|The St. Louis Cardinals 1981 {{season was}} the team's 100th season in St. Louis, Missouri and the 90th {{season in the}} National League. 1981 was a season of two {{significant}} anomalies: A change in the playoff format, which created the first-ever Divisional Series with a qualification variant that existed only for that season, and the players' strike, which truncated the regular season. Despite finishing 59-43, good for the best overall record in the National League East, the strike set up the scenario where the Cardinals actually missed the playoffs. The regular season was split into halves <b>to</b> tally teams' <b>records</b> <b>separately</b> in each half of the season, and because the Cardinals finished in second place in each half, they did not qualify for the 1981 playoffs.

40|$|Computational ghost imaging is {{a robust}} and compact {{system that has}} drawn wide attentions {{over the last two}} decades. Multispectral imaging {{possesses}} spatial and spectral resolving abilities, is very useful for surveying scenes and extracting detailed information. Existing multispectral imagers mostly utilize narrow band filters or dispersive optical devices to separate lights of different wavelengths, and then use multiple bucket detectors or an array detector <b>to</b> <b>record</b> them <b>separately.</b> Here, we propose a novel multispectral ghost imaging method that uses one single bucket detector with multiplexed illumination to produce colored image. The multiplexed illumination patterns are produced by three binary encoded matrices (corresponding to red, green, blue colored information, respectively) and random patterns. The results of simulation and experiment have verified that our method can be effective to recover the colored object. Our method has two major advantages: one is that the binary encoded matrices as cipher keys can protect the security of private contents; the other is that multispectral images are produced simultaneously by one single-pixel detector, which significantly reduces the amount of the data acquisition...|$|R
