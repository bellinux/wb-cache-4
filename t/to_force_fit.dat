40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{managers}} have placed increasing {{emphasis on the}} creation of tangible measures of intangible organizational properties. Many major corporations now include measures for intellectual capital, knowledge capital, reputational capital, and other such intangible assets on their financial ledgers. Counter to the rubric that "If it doesn't get measured, it doesn't get done", we argue that some intangibles are truly intangible, and attempts <b>to</b> <b>force</b> <b>fit</b> such measures on them creates undue organizational stress and harms the underlying asset. Instead, managers may better foster the growth of intangible assets by placing less emphasis on outcome measurement and more emphasis on the process. Using New York University's Office of Community Service as a case study, we illustrate how a Zen approach can augment tangible measures to create a truly "balanced" organizational strategy. American firms have widely adopted the strict measurement practices of Japanese firms, but have largely not adopted the Eastern practice of Zen. A Zen approach fosters trust and provides flexibility that allows organizations to better achieve success in the long run...|$|E

The author’s primary object of study is the theoretical and methodological conceptualization of the aspect under study, providing an insight into the specificity of the organization of internal mechanisms in the civilization of Eurasian steppe nomads, and trying to expound various phenomena in its development.

Experiments utilized an insulated 1. 1 meter diameter absorber which contained four 4. 25 meter beds of IMTP- 50 packing. In addition to a multitude of other measurements, gas phase temperature and CO 2 concentrations were obtained at the five locations around the four beds of packing. An Aspen Plus® RateSep™ absorber model was created to simulate the 12 runs. Although the predicted gas phase temperature profiles were slightly higher in the simulations, the model successfully represented both gas phase temperature and CO 2 profiles in the absorber.

40|$|A key {{task in the}} {{elicitation}} {{of expert}} knowledge is to construct a distribution from the finite, and usually small, number of statements that have been elicited from the expert. These statements typically specify some quantiles or moments of the distribution. Such statements are not enough to identify the expert's probability distribution uniquely, and the usual approach is to fit some member of a convenient parametric family. There are two clear deficiencies in this solution. First, the expert's beliefs are <b>forced</b> <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> the parametric family. Secondly, no account is then taken of the many other possible distributions that might have fitted the elicited statements equally well. We present a nonparametric approach which tackles both of these deficiencies. We also consider {{the issue of the}} imprecision in the elicited probability judgements.

In principle, the former allow improved accuracy and transferability over {{a wider range of}} molecular compositions, interactions, and environmental conditions unexplored by experiments. That is, assuming they have been optimally prepared from a diverse training set. The trade-off has been force field engines that are functionally complex, with a large number of nonbonded and bonded analytical forms that give rise to rather large parameter search spaces. To address this problem, we have developed GARFfield (genetic algorithm-based reactive force field optimizer method), a hybrid multiobjective Pareto-optimal parameter development scheme based on genetic algorithms, hill-climbing routines and conjugate-gradient minimization. To demonstrate the capabilities of GARFfield we use it to develop two very different force fields: (1) the ReaxFF reactive force field for modeling the adiabatic reactive dynamics of silicon carbide growth from an methyltrichlorosilane precursor and (2) the SiC electron force field with effective core pseudopotentials for modeling nonadiabatic dynamic phenomena with highly excited electronic states. The flexible and open architecture of GARFfield enables efficient and fast parallel optimization of parameters from quantum mechanical data sets for demanding applications like ReaxFF, electronic fast forward (or electron force field), and others including atomistic reactive charge-optimized many-body interatomic potentials, Morse, and coarse-grain force fields...|$|R
