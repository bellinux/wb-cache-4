40|$|As soon as {{the first}} English texts began <b>to</b> appear, <b>Arabian</b> <b>Nights</b> 2 ̆ 7 Entertainments, as {{translated}} by Antoine Galland, captivated the imaginations of most of eighteenth century England, bringing the work instantly into demand. Although the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Nights</b> 2 ̆ 7 Entertainments is generally recognized among scholars for its influence on other fictional tales and travel narratives and its shaping of the West 2 ̆ 7 s perception of the East, further study is needed in ascertaining {{the effect of the}} rhetorical device of repetition, which is so prevalent within the tales and which gives the collection both its unique character and its ability to engage readers from the time of its original publication onward. Bearing in mind that translation practices of the eighteenth century allowed creative additions by the translator, this study hopes <b>to</b> approach the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Nights</b> 2 ̆ 7 Entertainments as a collection of fables. Within this framework, I will begin with a close reading of 2 ̆ 2 The Story of the Two Sisters who envied their Younger Sister, 2 ̆ 2 which Galland acquired from the storyteller Hanna Diab, to demonstrate that repetition is the defining feature of the tales. Pulling on Judith Butler 2 ̆ 7 s concept of performativity, I will then explore what skill Khosrouschah, like Schahriar and the eighteenth century audience, is supposed to be learning through the fables. Examining the purpose of repetition and its effect on both the characters and the audience, I will argue that the repetition within the tales provides the best strategy for unlocking the fables...|$|R

50|$|Beschi’s Guru Simpleton (which {{occupies}} a status similar <b>to</b> The <b>Arabian</b> <b>Nights</b> or The Panchatantra in Tamil culture) is {{a blend of}} the oral tradition of Tamil folklore and the European story form, wrapped in the author’s imaginative faculty. Although Beschi had completed its composition (along with a preface) by 1776, the book was not published singularly until 1822 in London. Records show that Beschi wrote the Tamil version first and later translated it into Latin. Although Beschi claimed that the sole purpose of the book was to disseminate amusement and humour among both locals and missionaries, Blackburn mentions that the author was most probably yearning for something more than that - “this was a plea for a Jesuit patron, somewhere outside India, to underwrite the publication of his dictionary and folktale”, as print was a more reliable medium to “demonstrate correct spelling” than local scribes and copyists.|$|R
50|$|In 1811 Scott {{published}} the work {{by which he}} is known, his edition of the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Nights</b> Entertainments, in 6 vols. Edward Wortley Montagu had brought back from Turkey a nearly complete manuscript of the work (now in the Bodleian Library) written in 1764. Scott proposed to make a fresh translation from this manuscript, and printed a description of it, together with a table of contents, in William Ouseley's Oriental Collection. He abandoned the idea later on, and contented himself with revising Antoine Galland's French version (1704-1717), saying that he found it so correct {{that it would be}} pointless to go over the original again. He prefixed a copious introduction, and added some additional tales from other sources. The work was the earliest effort <b>to</b> render the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Nights</b> into literary English.

60|$|Whether or no it {{was better}} inside {{it was at least}} a surprise. The moment the two duellists had pushed open the door of that inoffensive, {{whitewashed}} cottage they found that its interior was lined with fiery gold. It was like stepping into a chamber in the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Nights.</b> The door that closed behind them shut out England and all the energies of the West. The ornaments that shone and shimmered on every side of them were subtly mixed from many periods and lands, but were all oriental. Cruel Assyrian bas-reliefs ran along the sides of the passage; cruel Turkish swords and daggers glinted above and below them; the two were separated by ages and fallen civilizations. Yet they seemed to sympathize since they were both harmonious and both merciless. The house seemed to consist of chamber within chamber and created that impression as of a dream which belongs also <b>to</b> the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Nights</b> themselves. The innermost room of all was like the inside of a jewel. The little man who owned it all threw himself on a heap of scarlet and golden cushions and struck his hands together. A negro in a white robe and turban appeared suddenly and silently behind them.|$|R
40|$|The {{article focuses}} on how merchants and their world are {{represented}} in three tales from Mahdi’s edition of the Kitab Alf layla wa-layla (nights 1 - 8, and 63 - 66). Contrarily to what might be expected from a fable text, the stories featuring merchants (both men and women) show a realistic treatment of characters, places, activities and objects related to trading. Also the moral evaluation of merchants is usually very positive, even when the story deals {{with the issue of}} a non-married woman earning a living as a merchant trade. The analysis raises the question of the extent <b>to</b> which the <b>Arabian</b> <b>Nights</b> may be viewed (also) as a mirror of the socio-economic reality of Mamluk urban society...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Arabian</b> <b>Nights</b> {{has been}} {{present in the}} {{literature}} of the West {{since the beginning of the}} eighteenth century and the translation of Antoine Galland in 1704. Critics have identified its stories in the work of a wide variety of Western writers, most notably, William Beckford, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth, Alfred Tennyson, W. M. Thackeray, Charles Dickens, Elizabeth Gaskell, Edgar Allan Poe, Gustave Flaubert, Stendhal, Goethe, Alexandre Dumas, Marcel Proust, Leo Tolstoy, Jorge Luis Borges, A. S. Byatt, and Marina Warner. However, relatively little has been said about the implications of The <b>Arabian</b> <b>Nights</b> for modern and modernist writers from James Joyce to Jean Rhys. Even less has been written on the relationship between the ancient epic and the emergence of the modern short story form. Focusing on the work of three short fiction writers who published on the cusp of modernism: Robert Louis Stevenson, Oscar Wilde, and Joseph Conrad, this thesis explores the place of The <b>Arabian</b> <b>Nights</b> in the emergence of modern short fiction in Britain. My study is not an attempt to trace the origins of The <b>Arabian</b> <b>Nights</b> as it features in modern short fiction. The project is more centrally concerned with how The <b>Arabian</b> <b>Nights</b> allows us <b>to</b> re-read the modern short story rather than the other way round. This thesis is less concerned with The <b>Arabian</b> <b>Nights</b> per se, than it is with how The <b>Arabian</b> <b>Nights</b> has been borrowed, taken up, appropriated, translated, adopted and adapted within a specific strand of modern short fiction published between 1877 and 1899. The borrowings I consider are both conscious and unconscious, casual and sustained, and it is not the aim of the thesis to trace back ‘Arabian Nights’ allusions to a precise origin, assuming such a thing were possible. Rather this thesis is more interested in The <b>Arabian</b> <b>Nights</b> as a recurring intertext of the short story. If, as I will argue, both The <b>Arabian</b> <b>Nights</b> and the modern short story have their origins in the oral tale, their intimacy also needs to be explained within the context of modern print culture. The turn of the century periodical incorporated and propagated tastes for exotic tales of the East for metropolitan audiences, a fact which undoubtedly informed the short fiction of Stevenson, Wilde and Conrad. Those same periodicals were looking to the past as much as the present, outwards as much as inwards. This is perhaps also true of the modern short story itself, which does not merely embrace the modern and embody it in short print forms, but also looks to the elongated oral tales associated with the likes of The <b>Arabian</b> <b>Nights.</b> Stevenson, Wilde, and Conrad represent a particularly concentrated response <b>to</b> The <b>Arabian</b> <b>Nights</b> at the turn of the century, when the modern short story in Britain was in its infancy. Through these writers, my study works to relocate the modern British short story (which I argue has been too readily restricted to the confines of England and Europe), within a broader transnational frame.
