40|$|Within {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a {{significant}} amount of interest in applying the new and developing photonics technology for telecommunications switching. As the transmission plant has converted its facilities to fibre there is an economic interest in completing the optical path through the switching system to the terminal facilities without requiring optical-to-electrical conversions. This paper reviews some of the proposed switching systems that use <b>time-multiplexed</b> <b>switching</b> and discusses how, and if, they could fit into current telecommunications networks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A {{hysteresis}} binary McCulloch-Pitts neuron {{model is}} proposed {{in order to}} suppress the complicated oscillatory behaviors of neural dynamics. The artificial hysteresis binary neural network is used for scheduling <b>time-multiplex</b> crossbar <b>switches</b> in order to demon-strate the effects of hysteresis. <b>Time-multiplex</b> crossbar <b>switching</b> systems must control traffic on demand such that packet blocking probability and packet waiting time are minimized. The system using n x n processing elements solves an n x n crossbar-control problem with O(1) time, while the best existing parallel algorithm requires O(n) time. The hysteresis binary neural net-work maximizes the throughput of packets through a crossbar switch. The solution quality of our system does not degrade with the problem size...|$|R

Example architectures, which only require low speed electronics, are outlined. Experimental results from an associated time-slot interchange architecture demonstrate error-free performance at 40 Gbit/s.

40|$|Ground {{moving target}} {{indication}} (GMTI) by a space-based radar {{system can be}} obtained by a multi-subaperture / multichannel radar system or a satellite cluster. The simplest approach with the receiving antenna split into two halves - and most popular in the SAR community - is to use the technique of along-track interferometry (ATI) to recognize moving objects. Caused by the ambiguity between radial velocity and azimuth position, the SAR processor images the moving object at a wrong position. Re-positioning can be performed by the exploitation of the interferometric phase; but, if the clutter contribution from the affected resolution cell is not negligible compared to the signal power, a severe estimation error will result. A larger number of subapertures permits a better performance using space-time adaptive processing (STAP), but a larger number of receive channels is not attractive for space-based systems because of weight, power consumption and data rate. Nevertheless, since phased array antennas offer the possibility to switch the phases and amplitudes of the T/R modules from pulse to pulse within each subaperture, additional degrees of freedom can be introduced increasing the performance considerably. In this paper, space-based multi-aperture radar systems will be analysed with respect to the relocation error, including <b>time-multiplexed</b> aperture <b>switching</b> techniques. Moreover, an azimuth estimation algorithm for this mode is investigated...|$|R
40|$|A <b>time-multiplexed,</b> optically-addressed, {{crossbar}} <b>switch</b> (38) {{is provided}} using a two-dimensional, optically-addressed, reflective {{spatial light modulator}} (O-SLM) (20). Since the optical addressing is time-multiplexed, only N addressing lines are required for an N. times. N crossbar, rather than the N. sup. 2 lines needed in the prior art. This reduction in addressing lines makes possible the development of enormous crossbar switches, such as 100. times. 100, for the first time. In addition, since data paths remain entirely in the optics domain, data speeds can reach the multi-gigabit level. In the switch, a row (40) of N inputs (42) at the read wavelength is spread over one axis of the O-SLM. The light is refocused along the other axis to an output array (48) of detectors (50), so that each input {{has the potential to}} talk to any one output. The O-SLM is normally off, i. e., non-reflective, so that the output is, {{in the absence of an}} input signal, zero. A one-dimensional array (52) of lasers (54) at the write wavelength is imaged onto the O-SLM. Each laser scans across an entire row of the O-SLM; where the laser is on, it turns on a portion of the O-SLM and establishes a connection between a particular input and a particular output. A full row is scanned in a time much shorter than the response time of the O-SLM, so that state of the O-SLM is capacitively stored and dynamically refreshed. The scanning is accomplished by tuning the wavelength of the laser and passing it through a grating, which sweeps the beam in space...|$|R
