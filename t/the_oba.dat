5|$|In West Africa, {{the sons}} and daughters of Yoruba kings were {{traditionally}} given in marriage to their fellow royals as a matter of dynastic policy. Sometimes these marriages would involve members of other tribes. Erinwinde of Benin, for example, was taken as a wife by <b>the</b> <b>Oba</b> Oranyan of Oyo during his time as governor of Benin. Their son Eweka went on to give birth to the dynasty that rules the Kingdom of Benin today.|$|E
25|$|In the 16th century, Lagos {{island was}} reputedly sacked by troops of <b>the</b> <b>Oba</b> of Benin during that kingdom's expansionary phase. It {{became known as}} Eko. The monarchs of Lagos since then have claimed descent from the warrior Ashipa who is {{sometimes}} {{said to have been}} a prince of Benin or, sometimes, an Awori freebooter loyal to the Benin throne. The Idejo aristocracy remained Yoruba. Ashipa's son built his palace on Lagos Island, and his grandson moved the seat of government to the palace from the Iddo peninsula. In 1730 <b>the</b> <b>Oba</b> of Lagos invited Portuguese slave traders to the island, where soon a flourishing trade developed.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>oba</b> ruled {{with the}} advice of the uzama, a council {{consisting}} of chiefs of powerful families and town chiefs of different guilds. Later its authority was diminished by the establishment of administrative dignitaries. Women wielded power. The queen mother who produced the future oba wielded immense influence.|$|E
50|$|Benin’s other {{important}} ritual festivals include Ague, {{where the first}} budded yams are blessed in hopes of a successful harvest; Ugie Ivie, the Festival of Beads, in which <b>the</b> <b>oba’s</b> coral and red stone regalia is bathed in cow’s blood to reinvest it with spiritual force; Ugie Erha <b>Oba,</b> which honors <b>the</b> <b>oba’s</b> father and all paternal ancestors; Oduduwa, a masquerade that likewise honors <b>the</b> <b>oba’s</b> paternal ancestors; and Ugie Oro, celebrating Oba Esigie’s victory over the Idah Kingdom in the 16th century.|$|R
50|$|In Benin today, ritual specialists {{known as}} Emuru, who serve the Ebo n-Edo shrine, carry brass vessels with {{protective}} substances. The Ebo n'Edo shrine, its spirits, the priests who serve them, and the objects {{used in their}} rituals are seen as references to {{the origin of the}} dynasty and the authority inherited by <b>the</b> <b>Obas.</b> Benin vessels have a greater significance than their utilitarian function; they refer to <b>the</b> <b>Oba's</b> ancestral authority, to Ewuare, and to the power that stems from <b>the</b> <b>Oba's</b> relationship to Olokun.|$|R
50|$|The Emotan Statue is {{a life-size}} statue {{designed}} {{in honour of}} Emotan, a petty trader who used to trade at <b>the</b> <b>Oba's</b> market in <b>the</b> Ancient Benin Kingdom during <b>the</b> reigns of <b>Oba</b> Uwaifiokun and <b>Oba</b> Ewuare <b>the</b> Great. The statue was unveiled on 20 March 1954 by Oba Akenzua II and is placed opposite <b>the</b> <b>Oba's</b> market in Benin City.|$|R
25|$|Ivory, both {{then and}} now, connotes royal wealth, power, and purity. Ivory, already a luxury {{commodity}} in Africa, became increasingly coveted {{with the growth}} of the European ivory trade. When an elephant was killed in Benin, <b>the</b> <b>Oba</b> received one tusk as a gift and was offered the other in sale. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>Oba</b> had many tusks and controlled the ivory trade. Ivory is associated with the Edo orisha of the sea, Olokun. As this orisha gives wealth and fertility, it the spirit world's equivalent of the Benin Oba. Ivory gave wealth similar to Olokun, as it enticed the Portuguese merchants who, in turn, returned wealth to Benin. The Portuguese belonged to Olokun, having arrived from the sea. The whiteness of ivory also reflects the symbolism of white chalk, whose ritual purity is associated with Olokun.|$|E
25|$|The poorer {{eastern side}} of the island {{contains}} the main markets and the poorer housing. The island is extremely crowded and congested and {{attempts have been made to}} build new roads out over the lagoon in order to improve traffic flows. It is also the part of Lagos which <b>the</b> <b>Oba</b> (King) of Lagos resides. It is also believed that the Eyo festival can only be held in this part of Lagos.|$|E
25|$|When Osinlokun died in 1829, Kosoko's brother, Idewu Ojulari, became Oba and reigned from 1829 {{to around}} 1834/5. However, Idewu Ojulari's reign was unpopular {{and at the}} behest of <b>the</b> <b>Oba</b> of Benin, to whom the people of Lagos had petitioned, Idewu Ojulari {{committed}} suicide. Notably, Lagos had hitherto been under Benin suzerainty up until the reign of Oba Kosoko who was dethroned by British forces in 1851. Thereafter, Oba Akitoye and his successor, Oba Dosunmu, rebuffed payment of annual tributes to Benin.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Obas</b> of Remo {{have been}} in {{existence}} since {{the founding of the}} Ijebu Kingdom by a prince of Oyo named Obanta and the arrival of the Prince Akarigbo to the western area of the kingdom roughly around the early 16th century. The title given to <b>the</b> <b>Obas</b> of Sagamu, Akarigbo, is in honor of this first prince of their line.|$|R

25|$|The Oyo Empire {{developed}} a highly sophisticated political structure to govern its territorial domains. Scholars have not determined {{how much of}} this structure existed prior to the Nupe invasion. Some of Oyo's institutions are clearly derivative of early accomplishments in Ife. After reemerging from exile in the early 17th century, Oyo took on a noticeably more militant character. The influence of an aggressive Yoruba culture is exemplified in the standards placed on <b>the</b> <b>oba</b> (king) and the roles of his council.|$|E
25|$|Benin's tactics {{were well}} organized, with {{preliminary}} plans weighed by <b>the</b> <b>Oba</b> and his sub-commanders. Logistics were organized to support missions {{from the usual}} porter forces, water transport via canoe, and requisitioning from localities the army passed through. Movement of troops via canoes was critically important in the lagoons, creeks and rivers of the Niger Delta, a key area of Benin's domination. Tactics in the field seem to have evolved over time. While the head on clash was well known, documentation from the 18th century shows greater emphasis on avoiding continuous battle lines, and more effort to encircle an enemy (ifianyako).|$|E
25|$|Lagos was annexed by <b>the</b> <b>Oba</b> of Benin in {{the sixteenth}} century on the site of an earlier Yoruba settlement, and was known as Eko. The rulers of Lagos since then have all descended from the Benin warrior Ashipa who was the first Governor of the town, while the land owning {{aristocracy}} (Idejo) are Yoruba who trace their lineage to Chief Olofin. Ashipa's son, Ado, built his palace on Lagos Island, and his grandson moved the seat of government to the palace from Iddo island. The current ruler of Iddo, Oba Oyekan, is the biracial son of the late Oba Adeyinka Oyekan of Lagos.|$|E

25|$|Five to six masks of {{this type}} were found in a large chest in 1897 in the bedchamber of the then-reigning Oba Ovonramwen, the ruler at the Benin court. They were taken {{at a time of}} great civil unrest during the British punitive Benin Expedition of 1897, the British burned the royal palaces of <b>the</b> <b>Oba</b> and the Queen Mother and looted {{thousands}} of ivory, brass and wood from the ancestral altars, private quarters and storerooms and many were sold in England to western museums and collectors to offset the cost of the expedition. The British Museum's pendant was purchased in 1910 from the British anthropologist Prof Charles Gabriel Seligman.|$|E
25|$|In 1942, {{he created}} the Ideal Photo Studio in Benin City, where he quickly {{developed}} {{a reputation as a}} young, hard-working professional and an honest businessman. The studio soon became a popular location to have portraits taken. He experimented with a variety of techniques, and he began creating product advertisements, documenting construction projects, photographing parties, and covering business conferences for local companies like Guinness Brewery. He also photographed official ceremonies and historical events for the Nigerian government. In 1956, Alonge photographed Queen Elizabeth's visit to meet Oba Akenzua II at the Benin airport. He also recorded <b>the</b> <b>oba</b> shaking hands with Princess Alexandra, who declared Nigeria independent in 1960, on a visit to Benin in 1963.|$|E
25|$|Alonge's {{photography}} preserves {{an important}} historical record of Benin {{arts and culture}} during the periods of British colonial rule and the transition to Nigerian independence during the 1950s and 1960s. The National Museum of African Art exhibited Alonge's work beginning in September 2014, displaying some of his rarely seen photographs. The exhibition, which coincided with the Nigerian celebration of 100 years as a united country, was curated by professor and photographer Flora S. Kaplan, who corresponded with Alonge and visited Benin in 1982. Among the first visitors to the exhibit were members of Benin's royal court and Alonge's family. Attendees included his colleagues and friends, his children, and Prince Ademola Iyi-Eweka, grandson of <b>the</b> <b>oba</b> who served from 1914 to 1933. Also present were many subjects of Alonge's photographs, now in their late 70s and 80s. The exhibition is scheduled to continue until January 2016. Once finished, {{it is hoped that}} the exhibition will return to Benin, where it will continue to be displayed.|$|E

25|$|Jadesola Babatola (2008) {{noted that}} the {{large part of the}} 13th century, legend had it that many princes left Ile Ife to what later became several Yoruba kingdoms along the west coast of Nigeria. Among the princes were two born to Oduduwa by the same mother, <b>the</b> <b>Oba</b> of Benin and the Ewi of Ado-Ekiti. Both first settled in Benin forests before {{disputes}} among their people led them to separate and the Ewi sought a new home westward at Utamodi (Oke Papa). Ewi Biritiokun and his son reigned there. It was Ewi Awamaro who migrated to Ilesun (Present day Ado-Ekiti) after staying briefly at Udoani (Ido Ani) and Agbado during the long trek. When Ewi Awamaro left Agbado, the elders remained behind to rest and gave the settlement the name Agba Ado (Elders’ Camp) – Agbado-Ekiti as the town is known today. Awamaro’s spies encouraged him to attack Elesun with the support of Odolofin after he had settled down at Oke Ibon (now Odo Ijigbo) and with the conquest of Ulesun by Awamaro, the town of Ulesun changed its name to Ado or Ado-Ewi.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of Awole there was a {{scramble}} for the throne by numerous contenders; some {{were reported to have}} spent less than six months on the throne; there was also a period of interregnum of almost twenty years where the various factions could not agree on a candidate for the throne. This period of vacuum led to the rise of powerful military and regional commanders like Adegun, the Onikoyi and others like the Otun to the Are-Ona Kakanfo, called Solagberu, and also Shehu Alimi, who was the leader of a growing Muslim population in Oyo. These new powers had lost regard for the office of the Alaafin due to the various political wranglings and the lack of a central authority at the time; this situation eventually led up to Afonja seceding Ilorin from Oyo in 1817 with the help of Oyo Muslims. In 1823, after Afonja had been killed by his allies, Shehu Alimi and Solagberu (Solagberu was also later killed by Alimi's son), Ilorin became part of the Sokoto Caliphate. By the time Captain Hugh Clapperton visited Oyo-Ile in 1825 during the reign of Alaafin Majotu, the empire was already in a state of decline. Clapperton's party recorded passing numerous Oyo villages burned by the Fulani (Ilorin) while Majotu had also sought the help of the English king and <b>the</b> <b>Oba</b> of Benin in putting down the Ilorin rebellion. Clapperton also noticed a shortage of horses, even though the Oyo were renowned as a great cavalry force; this might {{have something to do with}} the fact that most of the empire's soldiers and hence cavalry were stationed at Ilorin under the command of Afonja and later on Alimi's successors.|$|E
25|$|After being cautioned by <b>the</b> <b>Oba</b> {{about his}} late night movements, Prince Aderopo visits the village bar, where he meets his {{childhood}} friends, Banji (Femi Adebayo) and Tawa (Kehinde Bankole); the trio discuss the coming independence and their pasts. One {{of the guards}} assigned to protect the prince deserts his post {{to spend some time}} with his lover, close to a stream. Afonja and Danladi question the traditional priest, Baba Ifa (Ifayemi Elebuibon) on their way out of the bar; he responds to their questions proverbially and says that the killer will continue to kill until he is satisfied. The next day, the dead body of the lover of the guard who fled his post is discovered. Danladi orders the arrest of Baba Ifa, which Afonja outrightly refuses to carry out; he is thus suspended from his job and replaced by his deputy, Corporal Omolodun (Fabian Adeoye Lojede). Corporal Omolodun, however, is eventually killed by the serial killer after trailing him along the bush-path, following the discovery of another body, this time of an Igbo girl. The girl's father, a farmer Okafor (Kanayo O. Kanayo), along with his tribesmen, capture a travelling Northerner, claiming that he is responsible for the death of his daughter. The accused man is taken into custody by the police, but still maintains his innocence. Danladi informs his superiors that he will be closing the case, since he has found the killer. As he is about to transfer the Northerner away from Akote, Okafor throws a machete at him, piercing his heart. Even with his dying breath, the man insists he didn't kill the girl. Okafor, who repeatedly affirms his actions as doing what a real man would do, is taken into custody. At night, the officers gather to celebrate the Inspector's impending departure following the presumed victory over the killer. Dandali is persuaded into drinking against his will. On his way out he hears someone whistle a tune he was earlier told by the Northerner to be from the killer. The killer approaches him but he is too drunk to identify the face, and is assaulted by the killer.|$|E

50|$|During the 13th century, the {{indigenous}} Edo {{people of the}} west Niger area were run {{by a group of}} local chieftains, but by the 15th century a single ruler known as the 'oba' had asserted control, creating the Kingdom of Dahomey. Under the dynasty established by Ewuare the Great, the most famous of <b>the</b> <b>obas,</b> Dahoney's territory expanded to cover a region between the Niger River delta and what is now the Nigerian city of Lagos. <b>The</b> <b>obas</b> brought great prosperity and a highly organized state to Benin.
