500|$|Elizabeth's senior adviser, William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, died on 4 August 1598. His {{political}} mantle {{passed to}} his son, Robert Cecil, who soon became {{the leader of}} the government. One task he addressed was to prepare the way for a smooth succession. Since Elizabeth would never name her successor, Cecil was obliged to proceed in secret. He therefore entered into a coded negotiation with James VI of Scotland, who had a strong but unrecognised claim. Cecil coached the impatient James to humour Elizabeth and [...] "secure the heart of the highest, to whose sex and quality nothing is so improper as either needless expostulations or over much curiosity in her own actions". The advice worked. James's tone delighted Elizabeth, who responded: [...] "So trust I that you will not doubt but that your last letters are so acceptably taken as my thanks cannot be lacking for the same, but yield <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> in grateful sort". In historian J. E. Neale's view, Elizabeth may not have declared her wishes openly to James, but she made them known with [...] "unmistakable if veiled phrases".|$|E
500|$|When Stephen King {{created the}} {{character}} of Flagg, he based him around what he believed evil represented. To King, Flagg is [...] "somebody who’s very charismatic, laughs a lot, [...] tremendously attractive {{to men and women}} both, and [...] somebody who just appeals to the worst in all of us". This idea carries over into The Stand, in which Flagg first appears as the personification of evil opposing Mother Abagail, the personification of good. Character Tom Cullen ascribes to Flagg the ability to kill animals and inflict cancer at will, referring to him as the demon Legion, while character Glen Bateman refers to him as the Lovecraftian entity Nyarlathotep, among other ancient names. King wanted Flagg to embody a [...] "gigantic evil", although he intended the character to weaken by the end of The Stand. He said, [...] "I think the Devil is probably a pretty funny guy. Flagg is like the archetype of everything that I know about real evil, going back all the way to Charles Starkweather in the '50s—he is somebody who is empty and who has to be filled with other people's hates, fears, resentments, laughs. Flagg, Koresh, Jim Jones, Hitler—they're all basically the same guy". Although Flagg was not intended to represent Satan, this did not detract from what King sees as his ultimate goal. He notes that no matter who sees him or how he is seen as Flagg appears differently to different individuals, his message is the same: [...] "I know all the things that you want and I can give <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> and {{all you have to do}} is give me your soul".|$|E
500|$|Frank was not {{originally}} envisioned with a beard, however at {{the time}} of his casting, Fahey himself had one. Lindelof and Cuse felt that the beard worked with Lapidus' character, and allowed Fahey to keep it for the role, with the requirement he shave it back to a more manageable length. The character remained bearded until his return in fifth season episode [...] "316", set three years on from his original introduction. Fahey praised the way the character was developed to suit him, explaining that upon meeting with Lindelof and Cuse, rather than discussing the show with him, they were more interested in him personally and his experiences, going on to incorporate elements of himself into Lapidus. He expanded: [...] "The beauty of this is they'll feed you a concept based on an idea of who you are. The actor and the characters are not suits off the rack, they tailor-make <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> What's very exciting is it is a very positive give and take. It's a nice dance, as it were." [...] Fahey was not given an overarching overview of his character, nor were any of the other new freighter folk, which he found exciting, creating a level of intrigue amongst the cast and crew as well as fans. [...] Prior to arrival on the island, Lapidus was described by Naomi as a drunk. Entertainment Weeklys Kristin Dos Santos deemed Lapidus the most laid back of the four new characters, though Fahey commented that [...] "It might be because he's just rolled around a few more places a little longer than the others", agreeing with Dos Santos' assessment that Lapidus was [...] "a little nomadic". Lindelof and Cuse have said that Frank [...] "never takes anything at face value [...] a true conspiracy nut [...] has probably seen every episode of The X-Files, [...] pay off for him".|$|E
