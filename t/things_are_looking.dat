25|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, Lawson had {{established}} {{herself on the}} stage as a musical comedy star, able to earn fifty to sixty British pounds a week, and in 1933 she entered into the British film industry. Though she eventually acted {{in more than a}} dozen films, her screen career never matched her stage success. Her first major role was as Susie in Colonel Blood, which starred Frank Cellier. The most successful film that Lawson had a role in was the 1935 production of Scrooge, which starred Seymour Hicks and Donald Calthrop. She also appeared in films that included in their cast such notable actors as Stanley Holloway in D'Ye Ken John Peel? and Cotton Queen, Will Fyffe in Cotton Queen, and Vivien Leigh in <b>Things</b> <b>Are</b> <b>Looking</b> Up, and Bud Flanagan in A Fire Has Been Arranged. Lawson's last film was Oh Boy! in 1938.|$|E
500|$|Leigh's friends {{suggested}} she {{take a small}} role as a schoolgirl in the film <b>Things</b> <b>Are</b> <b>Looking</b> Up, which was her film debut, albeit uncredited as an extra. She engaged an agent, John Gliddon, who believed that [...] "Vivian Holman" [...] was not a suitable name for an actress. After rejecting his many suggestions, she took [...] "Vivian Leigh" [...] as her professional name. Gliddon recommended her to Alexander Korda as a possible film actress, but Korda rejected her as lacking potential. She was cast in the play The Mask of Virtue, directed by Sidney Carroll in 1935, and received excellent reviews, followed by interviews and newspaper articles. One such article was from the Daily Express, in which the interviewer noted [...] "a lightning change came over her face", {{which was the first}} public mention of the rapid changes in mood which had become characteristic of her. John Betjeman, the future poet laureate, described her as [...] "the essence of English girlhood". Korda attended her opening night performance, admitted his error, and signed her to a film contract. She continued with the play but, when Korda moved it to a larger theatre, Leigh was found to be unable to project her voice adequately or to hold the attention of so large an audience, and the play closed soon after. In the playbill, Carroll had revised the spelling of her first name to [...] "Vivien".|$|E

6000|$|... "Pretty well, Tom, but she's {{troublesome}} to manage.

"Well," [...] he said, [...] "among other things, {{the new man}} {{is opening}} his big fruit ranch, and we've just heard that there's a {{steamboat}} wharf to be built and a new wagon trail made. <b>Things</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> up, and the boys feel {{that they ought to}} have a celebration." ...|$|E

"Attorney Finney {{has been}} there this morning," [...] {{continued}} Bunce, [...] "and by his looks I guess he is not so well pleased as he once was, and it has got abroad somehow that the archdeacon has had down great news from London, and Handy and Moody are both as black as devils.

6000|$|Apart {{from this}} absurd {{outbreak}} of superstition, <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> rather more cheerful. The pack which was forming {{to the south}} of us has partly cleared away, and the water is so warm as to lead me to believe that we are lying in one of those branches of the gulf-stream which run up between Greenland and Spitzbergen. There are numerous small Medusæ and sealemons about the ship, with abundance of shrimps, so that there is every possibility of [...] "fish" [...] being sighted. Indeed one was seen blowing about dinner-time, but in such a position that it was impossible for the boats to follow it.|$|E
60|$|For {{things are}} rather {{different}} {{when the man}} in the bed next looks at the bedroom. Not only is the rose-bush still very obvious; but the other <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> very odd. The perspective seems to have gone crooked; the walls seem to vary in measurement till the man thinks he is going mad. The wall-paper has a new pattern, of strange spirals instead of round dots. The table seems to have moved by itself across the room and thrown the medicine bottles out of the window. The telephone has vanished from the wall; the mirror does not reflect what is in front of it. The portrait of himself over the mantelpiece has a face that is not his own.|$|E
6000|$|One morning, {{about seven}} o'clock, George and James, the two fair-haired sons of poor John Batten of Botallack, started {{for their work}} as usual.

50|$|On the {{financial}} front <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>looking</b> {{up for the}} club. A £368 profit was made, with most of this figure coming from the club's annual Easter bazaar at Burslem Town Hall. This upturn in finances caused the directors to loosen their unwritten rule on only recruiting local players.|$|R
6000|$|Near {{a century}} and a half has elapsed since these brave words were shaped by David Hume's pen; and the {{business}} of carrying the war into the enemy's camp has gone on but slowly. Like other campaigns, it long languished for want of a good base of operations. But since physical science, in the course of the last fifty years, has brought to the front an inexhaustible supply of heavy artillery of a new pattern, warranted to drive solid bolts of fact through the thickest skulls, <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> better; though hardly more than the first faint flutterings of the dawn of the happy day, when superstition and false metaphysics shall be no more and reasonable folks may [...] "live at ease," [...] are as yet discernible by the enfants perdus of the outposts.|$|E
6000|$|The phrase was Susan's. Its full {{significance}} wasn't at {{that time}} very clear to Lady Harman {{and it was only}} when she had uttered it that she realized from Horatio Blenker's convulsive start just what a blow she had delivered at that table. His glasses came off again. He caught them and thrust them back, he seemed to be holding his nose on, holding his face on, preserving those carefully arranged features of himself from hideous revelations; his free hand made weak movements with his dinner napkin. He seemed to be holding it in reserve against the ultimate failure of his face. Charterson surveyed her through an immense pause open-mouthed; then he turned his large now frozen amiability upon his host. [...] "These are Awful questions," [...] he gasped, [...] "rather beyond Us don't you think?"

At Erlangen there loiters now, recruiting, a certain Rittmeister von Katte, cousin to our Potsdam Lieutenant and confidant; to him this transit of the Majesty and Crown-Prince {{must be an}} event like few, in that {{stagnant}} place. French Refugees are in Erlangen, busy building new straight streets; no University as yet;--nay a high Dowager of Baireuth is in it, somewhat exuberant Lady (friend Weissenfels's Sister) on whom Friedrich Wilhelm must call in passing. This high Widow of Baireuth is not Mother of the present Heir-Apparent there, who will wed our Wilhelmina one day;--ah no, his Mother was [...] "DIVORCED for weighty reasons;"[Hubner, t. 181.] and his Father yet lives, in the single state; a comparatively prosperous gentleman these four years last past; Successor, since four years past, of this Lady's Husband, who was his Cousin-german. Dreadfully poor before that, the present Margraf of Baireuth, as we once explained; but now <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> up with him again, some jingle of money heard in the coffers of the man; and his eldest Prince, a fine young fellow, only apt to stammer a little when agitated, is at present doing the return part of the Grand Tour,--coming home by Geneva they say.|$|E

60|$|Washington, Oct. 6, 1863. DEAREST MOTHER--Your {{letter and}} George's came safe--dear brother George, one don't more than {{get a letter}} from him before {{you want to hear}} again, {{especially}} as <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> pretty stormy that way--but mother, I rather lean to the opinion that the 51st is still in Kentucky, at or near where George last wrote; but of course that is only my guess. I send George papers and occasionally letters. Mother, I sent him enclosed your letter before the last, though you said in it not to tell him how much money he had home, as you wanted to surprise him; but I sent it. Mother, I think Rosecrans and Burnside will be too much for the Rebels down there yet. I myself make a great acc't of Burnside being in the midst of friends, and such friends too--they will fight and fight up to the handle, and kill somebody (it seems as if it was coming to that pass where we will either have to destroy or be destroyed). Mother, I wish you would write soon after you get this, or Jeff or Mat must, and tell me about Andrew, if there is anything different with him--I think about him every day and night. I believe I must come home, even if it is only for a week--I want to see you all very much. Mother, I know you must have a great deal to harass and trouble you; I don't mean about Andrew personally, for I know you would feel to give your life to save his, and do anything to nourish him, but about the children and Nancy--but, mother, you must not let anything chafe you, and you must not be squeamish about saying firmly at times not to have little Georgy too much to trouble you (poor little fellow, I have no doubt he will be a pleasanter child when he grows older); and while you are pleasant with Nancy you must be sufficiently plain with her--only, mother, I know you will, and Jeff and Mat will too, be invariably good to Andrew, and not mind his being irritable at times; it is his disease, and then his temper is naturally fretful, but it is such a misfortune to have such sickness--and always do anything for him that you can in reason. Mat, my dear sister, I know you will, for I know your nature is to come out a first-class girl in times of trouble and sickness, and do anything. Mother, you don't know how pleased I was to read what you wrote about little Sis. I want to see her so bad I don't know what to do; I know she must be just the best young one on Long Island--but I hope it will not be understood as meaning any slight or disrespect to Miss Hat, nor to put her nose out of joint, because Uncle Walt, I hope, has heart and gizzard big enough for both his little nieces and as many more as the Lord may send.|$|E
