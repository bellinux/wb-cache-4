5|$|Antiemetic {{medications}} may {{be helpful}} for treating vomiting in children. Ondansetron has some utility, with a single dose being associated with less need for intravenous fluids, fewer hospitalizations, and decreased vomiting. Metoclopramide might also be helpful. However, the use of ondansetron might possibly be linked to an increased rate of return to hospital in children. The intravenous preparation of ondansetron may be given orally if clinical judgment warrants. Dimenhydrinate, while reducing vomiting, does not appear <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> clinical benefit.|$|E
5|$|During {{symptomatic}} attacks, {{administration of}} {{high doses of}} intravenous corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, is the usual therapy, with oral corticosteroids seeming to have a similar efficacy and safety profile. Although, in general, effective {{in the short term}} for relieving symptoms, corticosteroid treatments do not appear <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> impact on long-term recovery. The consequences of severe attacks that do not respond to corticosteroids might be treatable by plasmapheresis.|$|E

5|$|Following its {{significantly}} increased {{popularity in the}} early 21st century, reality television began <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> impact on the British music industry. Of the 274 albums that reached {{number one in the}} UK charts, 15 were by artists that had found fame through a reality TV programme. The first such act was Hear'Say, a British pop group formed by the television show Popstars. In March 2001, their debut album Popstars topped the chart and became the fastest-selling debut in UK chart history to that date. The only reality television stars to top the album chart with two different releases were Will Young, the 2002 winner of Pop Idol, Girls Aloud, the girl group formed by the TV series , and Leona Lewis, the 2006 winner of The X Factor. Like Hear'Say, Lewis's first album Spirit broke the record for the fastest-selling debut in UK chart history.|$|E

5|$|Throughout its range, the short-tail {{stingray}} {{is caught}} incidentally by various commercial fisheries using trawls, Danish and purse seines, longlines and set lines, and drag and set nets. It is also caught by recreational fishers using hook-and-line (from boats or the shore), spears, and harpoons. Most individuals caught are released alive; often fishers cut off their tails beforehand for safety, though this practice {{does not seem}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> impact on the rays' long-term survival. Sport fishers occasionally keep captured rays for meat or angling competitions; a small number are also kept for display in public aquariums, and it has reproduced in captivity. As it survives fishing activities well and remains common throughout its range, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the short-tail stingray as Least Concern. Within most of this species' range off New Zealand, targeting it commercially is prohibited.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Aliya Rama Raya in the Battle of Talikota, Tirumala Deva Raya started the Aravidu dynasty, moved and founded a new capital of Penukonda to replace the {{destroyed}} Hampi, and attempted to reconstitute the remains of Vijayanagara Empire. Tirumala abdicated in 1572, dividing the remains of his kingdom to his three sons, and pursued a religious life {{until his death in}} 1578. The Aravidu dynasty successors ruled the region but the empire collapsed in 1614, and the final remains ended in 1646, from continued wars with the Bijapur sultanate and others. During this period, more kingdoms in South India became independent and separate from Vijayanagara. These include the Mysore Kingdom, Keladi Nayaka, Nayaks of Madurai, Nayaks of Tanjore, Nayakas of Chitradurga and Nayak Kingdom of Gingee– all of which declared independence and went on <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> impact on the history of South India in the coming centuries.|$|E
5|$|Dunster Beach, which {{includes}} {{the mouth of the}} River Avill, is located half a mile from the village, and used <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> harbour, known as Dunster Haven, which was used for the export of wool from Saxon times; however, it was last used in the 17th century and has now disappeared, as new land was laid down among the dykes, meadows and marshes near the shore. During the Second World War, considerable defences were built along the coast as a part of British anti-invasion preparations, though the north coast of Somerset was an unlikely invasion site. Some of the structures remain to this day. Most notable are the pillboxes on the foreshore of Dunster Beach. These are strong buildings made from pebbles taken from the beach and bonded together with concrete. From these, soldiers could have held their ground if the Germans had ever invaded. The beach site has a number of privately owned beach huts (or chalets as some owners call them) along with a small shop, a tennis court and a putting green. The chalets, measuring , can be let out for holidays; some owners live in them all the year round.|$|E

5|$|Hoping to {{capitalise}} on the spontaneous uprising that spread across Ireland in May 1798, Commodore Daniel Savary led a third, and more successful, effort. He {{took a small}} frigate squadron flying false British colours to Killala, and in August landed 1,150 French troops under General Humbert. A larger force would have been despatched, but the French had been caught unprepared—the Irish rebellion had originally been planned to coincide with a later French landing, but British intelligence operations had infiltrated the United Irishmen and arrested much of its leadership, prompting a precipitate revolt. Although the uprising achieved some early successes, by the time Humbert arrived its outcome had already been decided with the defeat of successive rebel armies by British troops. Humbert's force was joined by many United Irishmen and had some initial success, {{but was unable to}} face superior British numbers at the Battle of Ballinamuck, and surrendered on 8 September. Although its small size allowed it to reach Ireland unobserved, neither Savary's frigate squadron nor the army it carried were large enough <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> impact on the campaign.|$|E
5|$|Parents {{are assumed}} to have the child's best {{interests}} in mind. Ethically, {{it is imperative that}} the medical practitioner informs the parents about the benefits and risks of the procedure and obtain informed consent before performing it. Practically, however, many parents come to a decision about circumcising the child before he is born, and a discussion of the benefits and risks of the procedure with a physician has not been shown <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> effect on the decision. Some parents request to have their newborn or older child circumcised for non-therapeutic reasons, such as the parents' desires to adhere to family tradition, cultural norms or religious beliefs. In considering such a request, the physician may consider (in addition to any potential medical benefits and harms) such non-medical factors in determining the child's best interests and may ethically perform the procedure. Equally, without a clear medical benefit relative to the potential harms, a physician may take the ethical position that non-medical factors do not contribute enough as benefits to outweigh the potential harms and refuse to perform the procedure. Medical organization such as the British Medical Association state that their member physicians are not obliged to perform the procedure in such situations.|$|E
5|$|The horses, {{especially}} young foals and juveniles, provide a major food {{source in the}} southern Namib Desert for the spotted hyena, along with gemsbok and springbok. However, the availability of other food appears <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> influence on predation rates among the horses. Leopards and black-backed jackals also predate young horses, although this is more rare. The harsh environmental conditions {{in which they live}} are the main driver of mortality among the Namib Desert Horse, as they cause dehydration, malnutrition, exhaustion and lameness. Other large plains animals, including the mountain zebra, may have once sporadically utilized the area for grazing during periods of excess rainfall, but human interference (including fencing off portions of land and hunting) have eliminated or significantly reduced the movement of these animals in the area. The endangered Hartmann's mountain zebra does exist in the Naukluft Mountain Zebra Park portion of the Namib-Naukluft Park, but their range does not intersect with that of the Namib Desert Horse.|$|E

5|$|The {{mechanism}} that is thought <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> influence on delayed effects involves formed blood cells and chemical mediators, which cause brain lipid peroxidation (degradation of unsaturated fatty acids). Carbon monoxide causes endothelial cell and platelet release of nitric oxide, {{and the formation}} of oxygen free radicals including peroxynitrite. In the brain this causes further mitochondrial dysfunction, capillary leakage, leukocyte sequestration, and apoptosis. The result of these effects is lipid peroxidation, which causes delayed reversible demyelinization of white matter in the central nervous system known as Grinker myelinopathy, which can lead to edema and necrosis within the brain. This brain damage occurs mainly during the recovery period. This may result in cognitive defects, especially affecting memory and learning, and movement disorders. These disorders are typically related to damage to the cerebral white matter and basal ganglia. Hallmark pathological changes following poisoning are bilateral necrosis of the white matter, globus pallidus, cerebellum, hippocampus and the cerebral cortex.|$|E
