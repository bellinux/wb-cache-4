5|$|Many Smilodon {{specimens}} {{have been}} excavated from asphalt seeps that acted as natural carnivore traps. Animals were accidentally <b>trapped</b> in the seeps and became bait for predators {{that came to}} scavenge, but these were then <b>trapped</b> themselves. The best-known of such traps are at La Brea in Los Angeles, which have produced over 166,000 Smilodon fatalis specimens that form the largest collection in the world. The sediments of the pits there were accumulated 40,000 to 10,000 years ago, in the Late Pleistocene. Though the <b>trapped</b> animals were buried quickly, predators often managed to remove limb bones from them, but they were themselves often <b>trapped</b> and then scavenged by other predators; 90% of the excavated bones belonged to predators.|$|E
5|$|After a lahar {{demolished}} her home, Sánchez became pinned {{beneath the}} debris of her house, where she remained <b>trapped</b> in water for three days. Her plight was documented as she descended from calmness into agony. Her courage and dignity touched journalists and relief workers, who put great efforts into comforting her. After 60 hours of struggling, she died, likely {{as a result of}} either gangrene or hypothermia. Her death highlighted the failure of officials to respond correctly to the threat of the volcano, contrasted with the efforts of volunteer rescue workers to reach and treat <b>trapped</b> victims, despite inadequate supplies and equipment.|$|E

5|$|By mid-July, the German {{forces had}} {{advanced}} {{within a few}} kilometers of Kiev below the Pripyat Marshes. The 1st Panzer Group then went south while the 17th Army struck east and <b>trapped</b> three Soviet armies near Uman. As the Germans eliminated the pocket, the tanks turned north and crossed the Dnieper. Meanwhile, the 2nd Panzer Group, diverted from Army Group Center, had crossed the Desna River with 2nd Army on its right flank.

5|$|Damage to the airways {{can cause}} {{subcutaneous}} emphysema (air <b>trapped</b> in the subcutaneous tissue of the skin) in the abdomen, chest, neck, and head. Subcutaneous emphysema, present {{in up to}} 85% of people with TBI, is particularly indicative of the injury when {{it is only in}} the neck. Air is <b>trapped</b> in the chest cavity outside the lungs (pneumothorax) in about 70% of TBI. Especially strong evidence that TBI has occurred is failure of a pneumothorax to resolve even when a chest tube is placed to rid the chest cavity of the air; it shows that air is continually leaking into the chest cavity from the site of the tear. Air can also be <b>trapped</b> in the mediastinum, the center of the chest cavity (pneumomediastinum). If air escapes from a penetrating injury to the neck, a definite diagnosis of TBI can be made. Hamman's sign, a sound of crackling that occurs in time with the heartbeat, may also accompany TBI.|$|E

5|$|Fishers {{have been}} <b>trapped</b> since the 18th century. They have been popular with trappers {{due to the}} value of their fur, which has been used for scarves and neck pieces.

They are easily <b>trapped,</b> and the value of their fur was a particular incentive for catching this species.|$|E

40|$|Objective—To {{determine}} {{the time and}} financial costs of programs for live <b>trapping</b> feral cats and determine whether allowing cats to become acclimated to the <b>traps</b> improved <b>trapping</b> effectiveness.

In 4 colonies, <b>traps</b> were immediately baited and set; in the remaining 5 colonies, <b>traps</b> were left open and cats were fed in the <b>traps</b> for 3 days prior to the initiation of <b>trapping.</b> Costs for bait and labor were calculated, and <b>trapping</b> effort and efficiency were assessed.

40|$|We {{conducted}} {{trials in}} Cairns, Australia, to examine if novel updraft light <b>traps</b> collected significantly more mosquitoes than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) model 512 miniature light <b>trap.</b> Two new updraft <b>traps,</b> the Northern Australia Quarantine Strategy (NAQS) Mozzie <b>Trap</b> and a CDC updraft <b>trap,</b> both collected significantly more mosquitoes {{than the standard}} CDC light <b>trap,</b> with a mean CDC <b>Trap</b> Index (<b>trap</b> collections relative to paired standard CDC light <b>trap</b> collections) of 3. 3 and 2. 3, respectively. These <b>traps</b> both had large horizontal suction areas that increased the probability that attracted mosquitoes entered the <b>trap</b> updraft. However, if the CO 2 source was located within the updraft of the CDC updraft <b>trap,</b> mosquito collections decreased considerably, indicating that placement of the bait is critical to <b>trap</b> performance. Creating an updraft by simply inverting the CDC <b>trap</b> body did not increase collections. The Mosquito Magnet X <b>trap</b> also did not collect significantly more mosquitoes than the CDC <b>trap.</b> Two CDC light <b>traps</b> sharing a 600 ml CO 2 /min gas line collected ca. 50 % more mosquitoes than a single CDC <b>trap</b> baited with 600 ml CO 2 /min, suggesting that a single gas source could be used on a <b>trap</b> line consisting of multiple <b>trap</b> units. These {{studies suggest that the}} optimal <b>trap</b> design should incorporate a CO 2 release system that lures mosquitoes to a large updraft within a bowl-shaped <b>trap</b> intake...|$|R

5|$|The Talara Tar Seeps in Peru {{represent}} a similar scenario, and have also produced fossils of Smilodon. Unlike in La Brea, {{many of the}} bones were broken or show signs of weathering. This may have been because the layers were shallower, so the thrashing of <b>trapped</b> animals damaged the bones of previously <b>trapped</b> animals. Many of the carnivores at Talara were juveniles, possibly indicating that inexperienced and less fit animals had a greater chance of being <b>trapped.</b> Though Lund thought accumulations of Smilodon and herbivore fossils in the Lagoa Santa Caves were due to the cats using the caves as dens, these {{are probably the result}} of animals dying on the surface, and water currents subsequently dragging their bones {{to the floor of the}} cave, but some individuals may also have died after becoming lost in the caves.|$|E

2500|$|For {{commercial}} harvesting, collectors {{use either}} basking <b>traps</b> or hoop <b>traps.</b> The basking <b>trap</b> is a floating enclosures with sloping sides and a basking surface. Turtles {{are able to}} climb up the sloping sides onto the basking surface, but then when they jump off into the center, they can't get back out. Hoop <b>traps</b> are cylindrical mesh <b>traps</b> with a funnel opening. Hoop <b>traps</b> are submerged and turtles are attracted by bait. In Minnesota, trappers say that they prefer basking <b>traps</b> to target painted turtles and hoop <b>traps</b> for [...] "meat" [...] turtles (snapping turtles and softshell turtles). Minnesota harvest records also show a clear pattern of most painted turtles coming from basking <b>traps</b> and most softshell and snapping turtles from hoop <b>traps.</b> Three quantitative studies of basking <b>traps</b> also show they are more efficient than baited hoop <b>traps</b> for <b>trapping</b> painted turtles. Despite the many hours of night and cloudiness when the basking <b>traps</b> do not lure turtles, the painted turtle's drive to bask is so powerful, that on a per-day basis, these <b>traps</b> are twice as effective. Or, possibly, the basking <b>traps</b> are more effective since painted turtles frequently escape back out the funnel of hoop <b>traps.</b>|$|R
