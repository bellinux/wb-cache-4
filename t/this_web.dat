The time of proto-globalization was one filled with “mutual influence, hybridization, and cross-cultural entanglement”. Many historians blame <b>this</b> <b>web</b> of national entanglements and agreements as the cause for the intensity and vast involvement during World War I.

5|$|The Boeotian {{school of}} epic poetry was chiefly {{concerned}} with the genealogies of the gods and heroes; later writers elaborated <b>this</b> <b>web.</b> Several other myths are attached to Orion in this way: A papyrus fragment of the Boeotian poet Corinna gives Orion fifty sons (a traditional number). This included the oracular hero Acraephen, who, she sings, gave a response to Asopus regarding Asopus' daughters who were abducted by the gods. Corinna sang of Orion conquering and naming all {{the land of the}} dawn. Bowra argues that Orion was believed to have delivered oracles as well, probably at a different shrine. Hyginus says that Hylas's mother was Menodice, daughter of Orion. Another mythographer, Liberalis, tells of Menippe and Metioche, daughters of Orion, who sacrificed themselves for their country's good and were transformed into comets.|$|E

50|$|This {{modification}} of melody is modest {{when compared to}} the transformation of texture in the first section of the Scherzo burlesque. In the First Suite was a functional bass line, explicit harmonic support and solid, if stodgy, counterpoint. This was all replaced with a mercurial polyphony from which a large variety of textures could be imagined, from a single line and two-part counterpoint to tutti chords. Sometimes the harmony would barely be sketched in <b>this</b> textural <b>web,</b> but <b>this</b> <b>web's</b> flexibility, along with different combinations of instruments, guaranteed an endless variety of sounds.

25|$|The {{southern}} house spider mating {{ritual is}} a lengthy (over an hour) and elaborate process with long periods during which neither the male nor the female moves considerably. When the wandering male encounters a female's web, {{there may be an}} initial confrontation where each scares the other. Upon recovering, the male then constructs a large web around the female's crevice. When <b>this</b> <b>web</b> is complete, the male pulls on its strands continuously to draw the female out of her hole, which may take several minutes. Following her emergence, each spider will tap at the other in an effort to grasp the other by the forelegs, with the male remaining suspended in his web.|$|E

2500|$|By far {{the most}} criticized have been episodes four and five for their shift away from the {{realistic}} style of Rebirth and the first few episodes, to the [...] "traditional mythology well known to longtime Kombat fans".

[...] "wanted to make sure <b>this</b> <b>web</b> series tied into some of the story lines of the Mortal Kombat canon." [...] Unlike episode four, IGN criticized the use of animation this time, stating it cost the episode its energy and created a glut of continuity errors. Cheaper make-up, costume effects, and set design due to budgetary constraints, and a short running time were among the other criticisms. Upon the release of the Raiden-themed episode six, Houston Press suggested that Tancharoen was forced to steer episodes four and five into the traditional Mortal Kombat mystique by Warner Bros. to test how fans would react. Episode six, according to the reviewer, was the studio allowing Tancharoen to return to his own style, finally delivering [...] "cinematic greatness" [...] and [...] "the best [...] he's done so far.
