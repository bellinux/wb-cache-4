5000|$|I {{think the}} notion of {{traditional}} anchor is fading away, the all-knowing, all-seeing person who speaks from on high. I don't think the audience really buys that anymore.

I tend to relate more to people on television who are just themselves, for good or for bad, than I do to someone who I believe is putting on some sort of persona. The anchorman on The Simpsons is a reasonable facsimile of some anchors who have that problem.|$|E

I wouldn’t have written if not for him and he might not have written books either, as he was a ladies’ man, always chasing girls, but now his home life is stable and sorted. We write in the same house, in separate offices and he helps me with plots. I <b>think</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a team. Laughter is everything.

5000|$|Kilcullen {{has argued}} {{in most of}} his works for a deeper {{cultural}} understanding of the conflict environment, an approach he has called conflict ethnography: [...] "a deep, situation-specific understanding of the human, social and cultural dimensions of a conflict, understood not by analogy with some other conflict, but in its own terms." [...] In the same essay, [...] "Religion and Insurgency", published in May 2007 on the Small Wars Journal, he expanded this view: The {{bottom line is that}} no handbook relieves a professional counterinsurgent from the personal obligation to study, internalize and interpret the physical, human, informational and ideological setting in which the conflict takes place. Conflict ethnography is key; to borrow a literary term, {{there is no substitute for}} a [...] "close reading" [...] of the environment. But it is a reading that resides in no book, but around you; in the terrain, the people, their social and cultural institutions, the way they act and <b>think.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a participant observer. And the key is to see beyond the surface differences between our societies and these environments (of which religious orientation is one key element) to the deeper social and cultural drivers of conflict, drivers that locals would understand on their own terms.|$|E
