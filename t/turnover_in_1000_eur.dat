40|$|Drawing on {{a unique}} farm level panel data set with 37, 409 {{observations}} and employing a matching estimator, this paper analyses how farm {{access to credit}} affects farm input allocation and farm efficiency in the CEE transition countries. We find that farms are asymmetrically credit constrained with respect to inputs. Farm use of variable inputs and capital investment increases up to 2. 3 % and 29 %, respectively, per <b>1000</b> <b>EUR</b> of additional credit. Our estimates suggest also that farm access to credit increases the total factor productivity up to 1. 9 % per <b>1000</b> <b>EUR</b> of additional credit, indicating that an improved access to credit results in adjusting the relative input intensities on farms. This finding is further supported by a negative effect of better access to credit on labour, suggesting that these two are substitutes.

40|$|Leprosy is {{a chronic}} {{infectious}} disease {{that depends on}} the interplay of several factors. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in host immune related genes have been consistently suggested as participants in susceptibility towards disease. Interleukin- 10 (IL- 10) is a crucial immunomodulatory cytokine in mycobacterial pathogenesis and especially the - 819 C>T SNP (rs 1800871) has been tested in several case-control studies indicating association with leprosy risk, although a recent consensus estimate is still missing. In this study, we evaluated the association of the - 819 C>T SNP and leprosy in two new Brazilian family-based populations. Then, we performed meta-analysis for this polymorphism summarizing published studies including these Brazilian family-based groups. Finally, we also retrieved published studies for other distal and proximal IL 10 polymorphisms: - 3575 T>A (rs 1800890), - 2849 G>A (rs 6703630), - 2763 C>A (rs 6693899), - 1082 G>A (rs 1800896) and - 592 C>A (rs 1800872). Results from meta-analysis supported a significant susceptibility association for the - 819 T allele, with pooled Odds Ratio of 1. 22 (CI = 1. 11 - 1. 34) and P-value = 3 x 10 (- 5) confirming previous data. This result remained unaltered after inclusion of the Brazilian family-based groups (OR = 1. 2, CI = 1. 10 - 1. 31, P-value = 2 x 10 (- 5)). Also, meta-analysis confirmed association of - 592 A allele and leprosy outcome (OR = 1. 24, CI = 1. 03 - 1. 50, P-value = 0. 02). In support of this, linkage disequilibrium analysis <b>in</b> <b>1000</b> genomes AFR, <b>EUR,</b> ASN and AMR populations pointed to r(2) = 1. 0 between the - 592 C>A and - 819 C>T SNPs.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explored the}} job embeddedness model of <b>turnover</b> <b>in</b> a collectivistic country (India). The job embeddedness model (JE) by Mitchell and Lee (2001) has 6 original dimensions - organization links and community links (individual connections {{with people in}} the organization and community), organization fit and community fit (individual perception of fit within an organization and community), and organization sacrifice and community sacrifice (what the individual gives up when leaving the organization or community). JE has been found to explain variance <b>in</b> <b>turnover</b> above the most significant predictors, such as job satisfaction and job alternatives in the US, but has not been explored in collectivistic cultures. This dissertation took a two-step approach to testing and extending the JE model to India. First, I explored the generalizability of the JE model in India and applied the individualism-collectivism framework to posit differences in how strongly each dimensions of JE relates to <b>turnover</b> <b>in</b> the US and in India. I suggested that organization links, community links, and organization fit are more important predictors of <b>turnover</b> <b>in</b> India than in the US, while community fit is a more important predictor of <b>turnover</b> <b>in</b> the US. In addition, I examined fit with job and suggested that perception of job fit is a more important predictor of <b>turnover</b> <b>in</b> the US than in India. Second, I expanded the job embeddedness model to include a family factor by creating three new dimensions, family links, family fit, and family sacrifice, and suggested that this factor would predict <b>turnover</b> <b>in</b> both countries. Data were collected from call center employees in the US (n = 323) and in India (n = 474). Multi-group confirmatory factor analysis supported the three-factor structure of job embeddedness (organization, community, and family factors) in both cultures. As hypothesized, organization embeddedness and family embeddedness predicted <b>turnover</b> <b>in</b> both countries. Community embeddedness did not predict <b>turnover</b> <b>in</b> either country. In addition, organization fit, organization links, and community links interacted with country in the hypothesized direction such that they were more important <b>in</b> predicting <b>turnover</b> <b>in</b> India, while job fit was more important <b>in</b> predicting <b>turnover</b> <b>in</b> the US...|$|R

40|$|Brown {{adipose tissue}} (BAT) is an {{important}} site of adaptive changes in thermogenesis in the rat. The sympathetic nervous system, which richly supplies BAT, is thought {{to play an important}} role in the regulation of BAT thermogenesis because catecholamines stimulate and beta adrenergic blocking agents inhibit oxygen consumption in this tissue. The present studies were carried out to assess directly sympathetic activity in BAT in response to cold exposure and to changes in dietary intake, both of which alter heat production in the rat. Sympathetic activity was determined from the rate of norepinephrine (NE) <b>turnover</b> <b>in</b> interscapular brown adipose tissue (IBAT) after preliminary experiments validated the use of NE <b>turnover</b> techniques <b>in</b> IBAT. Acute exposure to 4 °C increased NE <b>turnover</b> <b>in</b> IBAT 4 - to 12 -fold compared with ambient temperature controls, depending upon the interval over which the turnover measurement was made, while in the heart NE <b>turnover</b> doubled <b>in</b> response to the same cold stimulus. In animals exposed to cold continuously for 10 d before study, NE <b>turnover</b> measurements <b>in</b> IBAT and in the heart were elevated comparably to those obtained during acute exposure. Alterations in feeding were also associated with changes <b>in</b> NE <b>turnover</b> <b>in</b> IBAT. Fasting for 2 d decreased NE <b>turnover</b> <b>in</b> IBAT (- 35 % from 29. 2 ± 4. 2 ng NE/h to 18. 9 ± 5. 9) and in heart (- 52 %). In animals fed a “cafeteria” diet, a model of voluntary overfeeding in the rat, NE <b>turnover</b> was increased <b>in</b> both IBAT (+ 108 % from 24. 8 ± 4. 5 ng NE/h to 51. 7 ± 6. 8) and heart (+ 66 %). Because ganglionic blockade exerted a greater effect on NE <b>turnover</b> <b>in</b> IBAT in cafeteria-fed rats than in controls, the increase <b>in</b> NE <b>turnover</b> <b>in</b> IBAT with this overfeeding regimen reflects enhanced central sympathetic outflow. Thus NE turnover techniques can be satisfactorily applied to the assessment of sympathetic nervous system activity in IBAT...|$|R
