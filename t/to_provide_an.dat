5|$|A {{disastrous}} {{fire started}} {{on the seventh floor}} on the night of 16 March 1954 and spread downwards. The keepers had no time to raise the alarm and were driven out of the lighthouse onto the rocks but rescued the next day when the relief vessel arrived as part of its regular schedule. The heat of the fire caused damage to both the interior and the structure and a lightship and series of temporary lights were installed during reconstruction.

5|$|Because the minelayers were {{operating}} {{within range of}} German surface raiders, the American battleships were detailed <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>an</b> escort for them, along with other units of the Grand Fleet. For the most part, these expeditions proved uneventful, but on two occasions, on 30 June and again on 8 August, lookouts on the battleships reported seeing U-boats or torpedoes in the water, forcing the Division to maneuver accordingly. Like the previous sightings made while escorting the Scandinavian Convoy, subsequent review of German war records revealed that both cases were false alarms.|$|E

5|$|Divers {{may carry}} one {{cylinder}} or multiples, {{depending on the}} requirements of the dive. Where diving takes place in low risk areas, where the diver may safely make a free ascent, or where a buddy is available <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>an</b> alternative air supply in an emergency, recreational divers usually carry only one cylinder. Where diving risks are higher, for example where the visibility is low or when recreational divers do deeper or decompression diving, and particularly when diving under an overhead, divers routinely carry more than one gas source.|$|E
