Continuous {{exploitation}} of trees which {{is done to}} get a wood with good quality can effect in the lack of the wood availability. One of the effort {{that can be done}} to overcome these problems by using the Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL) sengon wood because this wood is one of the fast growing wood so its availability can be guaranteed. Excessive load that occurs in a column structure can effect a column failure in resisting the load called buckling. This buckling can cause an imbalance in a structure system so the structure will fail to withstand the load. The method that is used in this research is laboratory experimental and analysis method. This research is conducted with compress test the specimen of sengon Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL) built up column. The number of specimens which is used are nine pieces consist of three variations and each variation there are three specimens. From the test results of sengon Laminated Veneer Lumber (LVL) built up column are obtained compressive capacity for variation LVL A LVL B, and LVL C is 68733. 3 N, 74100 N and 16800 N in a row.

40|$|The {{results of}} {{measuring}} maximum loads on different slopes when skidding uphill with WOO DY 110 cable skidder and adapted 4 WD agricultural tractor AGT 835 {{are described in}} the article. Both tractors are very different and were chosen {{for the purpose of}} finding the limits of uphill skidding. Besides the slope, the pre-designated loads of different sizes and log orientation (butt-end or top-end forward) have been main variables. The trial was conducted on two concave shaped test skid trails in the forest. On the lower altitudes, the skid trails had small inclination, which slowly increased to 42 % on the track where WOODY 110 was tested, and 27 % where AGT 835 was measured. First the loads were skidded uphill with butt-end and then with top-end forward. The purpose was to choose too heavy loads, as we wished to stop tractors due to overload, but on different slopes. The proper load formation (butt-end forward if possible) in uphill skidding is most important on steeper skid trails. The dependency between maximum load and slope is linear. The calculated <b>theoretical</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>load</b> on horizontal surface enables us to make similar assessment for any other tractor weighing between 2 and 7 tons. For this purpose, John Deere 6220 and LIMB 80 LUXS adapted agricultural tractors for forest use were chosen and compared. The ratio between the tractor load on different slopes and tractor weight was calculated for all four tractors included in our comparison. Apart from the weight, tractor's engine torque (power) has the decisive influence on the load size. Maximum loads on different slope categories were calculated according to different engine powers...|$|E

Au(0)BEA nanoclusters were produced from gold ion reduction at 50  °C in sodium borohydride (3.4  mM) suspension and called as BEA-Gold. The reduction step was terminated when the hydrogen gas formation was finished. BEA-Gold samples were washed and centrifuged for four times at 7500  rpm and dried at 50  °C.

Tillage tool attachment systems must be designed to determine a tool's maximum depth into the soil and withstand the resulting forces from the soil. The following paper presents a design for an attachment system that incorporates a self-locking rack and pinion jack, load-bearing sliding surfaces, and rack clamp that is used to secure the cultivator sweep. The design is evaluated for deformation and deflection at the <b>maximum</b> <b>theoretical</b> <b>loads</b> using Finite Element Analysis. The design successfully minimizes deflection, but exhibits stresses higher than the material yield stress in a small area. After slight modifications to the bar attachment structure in a future design iteration, the tillage tool design will be ready to test in the field. by Elizabeth Porter. Thesis: S.

Method: Twelve male Wistar rats were used. They were subjected to placement of a modified Kessler suture stitch in the calcaneus tendon.

The mechanical properties studied were <b>maximum</b> <b>load,</b> tension in the <b>maximum</b> <b>load</b> and module of elasticity. The contralateral tendon was used as a control. Results: The statistical analysis showed that for the times studied, the values for mechanical properties did not present any significant differences.

40|$|The {{study of}} balls-into-bins games or {{occupancy}} problems {{has a long}} history since these processes can be used to translate realistic problems into mathematical ones in a natural way. In general, the goal of a balls-into-bins game is to allocate a set of independent objects (tasks, jobs, balls) to a set of resources (servers, bins, urns) and, thereby, to minimize the <b>maximum</b> <b>load.</b> In this paper we show two results. First, we analyse the <b>maximum</b> <b>load</b> for the chains-into-bins problem where we have n bins and the balls are connected in n/l chains of length l. In this process, the balls of one chain have to be allocated to l consecutive bins. We allow each chain d i. u. r. bin choices. The chain is allocated using the rule that the <b>maximum</b> <b>load</b> of any bin receiving a ball of that chain is minimized. We show that, for d ≥ 2, the <b>maximum</b> <b>load</b> is (ln ln (n/l)) /ln d +O(1) with probability 1 -O(1 /lnln(n/l)). This shows that the <b>maximum</b> <b>load</b> is decreasing with increasing chain length.

40|$|Biomechanical {{tests are}} widely used in animal studies on {{osteoporotic}} fracture healing. However, the biomechanical recovery process is still unknown, leading to difficulty in choosing time points for biomechanical tests and in correctly assessing osteoporotic fracture healing. To determine the biomechanical recovery process during osteoporotic fracture healing, studies on osteoporotic femur fracture healing with biomechanical tests in ovariectomized rat (OVX) models were collected from PUBMED, EMBASE, and Chinese databases. Quadratic curves of fracture healing time and <b>maximum</b> <b>load</b> were fitted with data from the analyzed studies. In the fitted curve for normal fractures, the predicted <b>maximum</b> <b>load</b> was 145. 56 N, and the fracture healing time was 88. 0 d. In the fitted curve for osteoporotic fractures, the predicted <b>maximum</b> <b>load</b> was 122. 30 N, and the fracture healing time was 95. 2 d. The <b>maximum</b> <b>load</b> of fractured femurs in OVX rats was also lower than that in sham rats at day 84 post-fracture (D 84 PF). The fracture healing time was prolonged and <b>maximum</b> <b>load</b> at D 84 PF decreased in OVX rats with closed fractures. The <b>maximum</b> <b>load</b> of Wister rats was {{higher than that of}} Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, but the fracture healing time of SD and Wister rats was similar.
