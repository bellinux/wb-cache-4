5|$|According to {{personal}} {{accounts of the}} battle, after dismounting Dodge offered his men a chance {{to back out of}} the operation. No one opted out, and 21 men advanced with Dodge in an extended firing line, unsure of the enemy's location. The remaining eight soldiers were posted as guards on high grounds and near the horses. Unlike the disorganized and undisciplined troops at Stillman's Run, the volunteers at Horseshoe Bend adhered to military discipline; they waited for Dodge to give the order before they entered <b>the</b> <b>thicket</b> and swampland in search of their enemy, and once searching they awaited their commander's order to attack.|$|E
5|$|Shots {{rang out}} from Stephenson's men but the Sauk did not {{immediately}} return fire and the fight eventually descended into a bayonet and knife battle. The militia charged into <b>the</b> <b>thicket</b> and the Sauk returned fire, killing Stephen P. Howard. The militia force made two more charges into the woods. During one of these, Thomas Sublette stabbed a Sauk in the neck and George Eames was killed in action. The third charge resulted in severe wounds for Stephenson, who {{was shot in the}} chest with a musketball, and the death of militia man Michael Lovell. According to Stephenson's account of the battle, five or six Native American warriors were killed and the militia lost three men.|$|E

The Frenchmen soon observed him, and one of their number swam over to where he was standing. Throwing himself at his feet the Frenchman explained who they were and begged the Admiral to grant him and his comrades a safe conduct to Fort Caroline, as they were not at war with Spaniards.|$|E
25|$|Unable to {{duplicate}} the surprise that was achieved by Ewell on the Turnpike, A.P. Hill's approach was detected by Brig. Gen. Samuel W. Crawford's men from their position at the Chewning farm, and Meade ordered the VI Corps division of Brig. Gen. George W. Getty to defend the important intersection of the Orange Plank Road and the Brock Road. Union cavalry under Brig. Gen. James H. Wilson, employing repeating carbines, succeeded in briefly delaying Hill's approach. Getty's men arrived just before Hill's and the two forces skirmished briefly, ending with Hill's men withdrawing {{a few hundred yards}} west of the intersection. Much of the fighting near Orange Plank Road was in close quarters and <b>the</b> <b>thicket</b> along the road, accompanied with the smoke from rifles, caused much confusion amongst officers of both sides. A mile to the rear, Lee established his headquarters at the Widow Tapp's farm. Lee, Jeb Stuart, and Hill were meeting there when they were surprised by a party of Union soldiers entering the clearing. The three generals ran for safety and the Union men, who were equally surprised by the encounter, returned to the woods, unaware of how close they had come to changing the course of history. Meade sent orders to Hancock directing him to move his II Corps north to come to Getty's assistance.|$|E
500|$|When it came {{to other}} sound patterns, Keats relied on double or triple caesuras in {{approximately}} 6% of lines throughout the 1819 odes. An example from [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] can be found within line 45 ("The grass, <b>the</b> <b>thicket,</b> and the fruit-tree wild") as the pauses after the commas are a [...] "masculine" [...] pause. Furthermore, Keats began {{to reduce the amount}} of Latin-based words and syntax that he relied on in his poetry, which in turn shortened the length of the words that dominate the poem. There is also an emphasis on words beginning with consonants, especially those that begin with [...] "b", [...] "p" [...] or [...] "v". These three consonants are relied on heavily in the first stanza, and they are used syzygically to add a musical tone within the poem.|$|E

They weigh [...] at birth and are almost helpless, beginning to crawl a day or two after birth and walking around three weeks of age. The lioness moves her cubs to a new den site several times a month, carrying them one by one by the nape of the neck, to prevent scent from building up at a single den site and thus avoiding the attention of predators that may harm the cubs.|$|E

This updated edition explores the plant biology, ecology, geology, and environmental regions of <b>the</b> Big <b>Thicket</b> National Preserve. After decades of research on <b>the</b> Big <b>Thicket,</b> Watson concluded that <b>the</b> Big <b>Thicket</b> was unique for its biological diversity, due mainly to interactions of geology and climate. A visitor in <b>the</b> Big <b>Thicket</b> could look in four different directions from one spot and view scenes typical of the Appalachians, the Florida Everglades, a southwestern desert, or the pine barrens of the Carolinas. Watson covers the ecological and geological history of <b>the</b> Big <b>Thicket</b> and introduces its plant life, from longleaf pines and tupelo swamps to savannah wetlands and hardwood flats. “This is {{the work on the}} plant biology of <b>the</b> Big <b>Thicket.</b> ”—Pete A.

So for a whole summer he stayed hidden in the woods, discovered by none, forgetful of himself and of his own, lurking like a wild thing.|$|E
2500|$|On April 6, 1865, the 19th halted its {{march on}} a hill {{overlooking}} what William Wood would later assume to be Sayler's Creek (or [...] "Tayler's" [...] Creek, {{as he calls it}} in the original manuscript). The men took this opportunity to cook some of their corn, but a fire had hardly been lit when Wood received orders to take his company and deploy them as skirmishers and drive a small body of Federals from some pines {{at the base of the}} hill. For the final time, the 19th Virginia formed a line of battle and, following Wood's Company A, marched down the hill into <b>the</b> <b>thicket.</b> After recapturing several pieces of artillery, the 19th continued on until they reached a road in a clearing. In front of them, thousands of Federal cavalrymen, probably from George A. Custer's Division, were forming for an attack. Rapidly preparing for the onslaught, the men of the 19th threw up a breastwork of fence rails in their front and prepared for the assault.

2500|$|Taxus brevifolia var. reptaneta. Although T. brevifolia is {{typically}} a tree as described above, T. brevifolia var. reptaneta is a shrub variety that generally {{occurs in the}} mid to upper elevation range of the typical variety, 3,500 to 4,000ft (1000–1219 m) at its southernmost occurrence in the Klamath Mountains region, and at lower elevations further north. [...] It is distinguished from young trees of the typical variety (var. brevifolia) by its stems initially creeping along the ground for a short distance before ascending (curving) upwards and by the branches growing off {{to one side of the}} stem, usually the upper side. The epithet reptaneta is from the Latin reptans which means “creeping, prostrate, and rooting,” which is exactly what this variety does; in rooting it forms yew thickets; hence, the epithet reptaneta (etum means collective place of growth) and hence the common name, thicket yew. Unlike the typical variety, thicket yew grows in abundance on open sunny avalanche shoots or ravines as well as in the forest understory. [...] It also occurs along forest margins. In northwestern Montana, a variant of <b>the</b> <b>thicket</b> yew does not ascend upwards; rather, it remains along the ground. [...] This is probably the ancestral form; the upright form with branches along the upper side would be the expected growth pattern that might evolve from one with stems that strictly creep along the ground since branches can only arise from the upper surface.|$|E
2500|$|Lt. Col.

[...] With the sea at their backs, a lack of mutual support between outposts, and the thorny scrub and cacti of the arid hills stretching in a dense tangle before them, the Marines had a less-than-ideal tactical position. [...] Commander McCalla pointed out to Lt. Col. Huntington that his outposts were too far forward and could not be seen or supported in the dense undergrowth between the outposts and the main camp. [...] Three of the companies stacked arms and returned to the ship to help with unloading operations. Shortly after sundown, the Marines had their first meal of coffee and hardtack. Soon afterwards the first alarm came. Voices were heard and lights seen in <b>the</b> <b>thicket,</b> but no attack came that night.
