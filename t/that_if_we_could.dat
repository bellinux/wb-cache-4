Lennertz attempted to remain [...] "authentic" [...] to the characters' progression from average worker to calculated killer. To achieve this aim, he decided against recording digitally, instead recording the tracks on two-inch analog tape, intending each musical cue to {{sound as if}} it was emanating from a vinyl record. He explained, [...] "The idea was to put together a band that would record the score together the same way that they would make an album. It isn't over-produced or shiny and digital in any way. It's brash, noisy, and full of bravado and swagger. I knew <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> harness some of this sonic magic in the score, then the toughness and confidence of the music would play against Bateman, Sudeikis, and Charlie Day to really emphasize and elevate the humor in the situations that transpire." [...] Lennertz continued, [...] "We tracked through tape before Pro Tools to get that fat sound, and made every choice based on feel rather than perfection. We even used the same Wurlitzer that Money Mark played on Beck's classic ‘Where It's At’. At the end of the day, Seth [...] and I wanted to produce a score that is as irreverent and full of attitude as the movie itself. I think we did it...and most of all, everyone had a blast in the process." ...|$|E

500|$|Leaving Levene in {{the late}} 1980s to become a {{freelance}} stylist in television advertising, MTV and film, Everest began styling bands and pop stars such as George Michael. He recognised a shift in perception of the male fashion industry; men had become more label conscious. This had coincided with the increased awareness of top-end fashion designers, like Hugo Boss and Armani, highlighted by men's lifestyle magazines; such as Arena and The Face. He said, [...] "I thought <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> demystify bespoke tailoring {{and make it more}} accessible, as well as really understanding {{what was going on in}} ready-to-wear fashion and being directional with it, there was possibly a market there." [...] Having decided to create the Timothy Everest brand as an alternative to 'designer' ready-to-wear, he searched for a suitable location away from [...] "the stuffiness of Savile Row". Everest opened his first premises in 1989; in Princelet Street, Spitalfields, just outside the City of London, in the East End. He said, [...] "We started in one room of a house. We had one rail with four garments on and a telephone, no chairs, no furniture." [...] To begin with, business was slow. Moving premises in 1993, he chose a three-storey, early Georgian townhouse (built in 1724), just north of Old Spitalfields Market in nearby Elder Street – the former home of artist Mark Gertler (1891–1939) – converting it to an atelier over seven weeks. He dressed Tom Cruise for the 1996 film [...] Cruise liked the suits so much that he kept them, and commissioned Everest to make him some more.|$|E

2500|$|Scorpion {{appeared}} in the first MK game as one of two palette-swapped ninjas along with Sub-Zero. His early origins were revealed by original series character designer John Tobias in September 2011 when he posted several pages of old preproduction character sketches and notes on Twitter. Scorpion and Sub-Zero were simply described as [...] " [...] palette swap for 2 ninjas—a hunter and the hunted," [...] while Tobias also considered the concepts of {{either one of them}} fleeing their clan, or a [...] "revenge story" [...] involving the then-unnamed characters being part of rival clans. In regards to the game's strict memory limitations, co-creator and programmer Ed Boon explained in 2012: [...] "A lot of attention went into the economics of it, and so we knew <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>could</b> take a character and change their color and use basically the same memory to create two characters, we'd save {{a lot of money and}} we'd have two characters." [...] Scorpion was given a yellow palette with the developers deciding that it would symbolize fire as the exact opposite to Sub-Zero's ice blue, which [...] "prompted the story behind them being these opposing ninja-clan-type characters." [...] A third ninja swap, Reptile, was added in the third revision as a hidden character who was outfitted in green and used Scorpion's spear (along with Sub-Zero's freeze) as part of his offensive arsenal; he was devised by Boon as [...] "a cooler version of Scorpion." [...] The original costume was created from a modified ninja-like outfit bought at a Chicago costume shop and was red for filming in the first game, but a different yellow one with a quilted vest and knee-high shin guards was utilized for MKII. This in turn made the other male ninjas therein—Sub-Zero, Reptile, and hidden characters Smoke and Noob Saibot—palette swaps of Scorpion, with the latter two also using Scorpion's spear when players fought them separately in secret battles. Scorpion and the ninja characters were played by Daniel Pesina, who was replaced by John Turk for Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 and the 1996 compilation Mortal Kombat Trilogy, while Sal Divita played the character in MK: Mythologies.|$|E
