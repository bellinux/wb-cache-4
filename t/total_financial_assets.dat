50|$|Because these NBFIs operate {{without a}} banking license, in some {{countries}} their activities are largely unsupervised, both by government regulators and credit reporting agencies. Thus, a large NBFI market share of <b>total</b> <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> can easily destabilize the entire financial system. A prime example would be the 1997 Asian financial crisis, where a lack of NBFI regulation fueled a credit bubble and asset overheating. When the asset prices collapsed and loan defaults skyrocketed, the resulting credit crunch led to the 1997 Asian financial crisis that left most of Southeast Asia and Japan with devalued currencies and a rise in private debt.|$|E
30|$|Lastly, Fig.  9 {{provides}} us with a comprehensive picture of the existing financial exposures among the different institutional sectors operating in the euro area {{and the rest of}} the world across the considered financial instruments. The comprehensive analysis of the euro area financial system as a multilayer macro-network allows us to obtain further insights on the challenging problem of estimating the financial interdependencies existing between the banking sector and both the real and the financial sector, enabling the consideration of the relevant indirect exposures via the different financial instruments considered together. Further, this analysis {{provides us}} also with a map of the potential channels through which distress may propagate as a consequence of shocks of different nature. Both the insights on the estimate of financial interdependencies and the map of the potential distress propagation channels could not be obtained with a single layer analysis. In order to make more homogeneous the different layers of the multilayer macro-network of financial exposures, we compute weights as percentages of the total assets of the source institutional sectors. Moreover, for the sake of clarity, we remove links with a weight below 1 %. By focusing on the most relevant links (with a weight above 10 %) connecting the different institutional sectors of the euro area via loans and deposits, debt securities, and equity, we can identify the existence of relevant indirect exposures of the banking system to the financial sector. In particular, as shown in Fig.  9, Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem exhibit a direct exposure amounting to about 16 % of their <b>total</b> <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> to Non-Financial Corporations, via loans and deposits. In turn, Non-Financial Corporations are exposed for about 10 % of their <b>total</b> <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> to Non-MMF Investment Fund equity. The chain continues both via equity and debt securities to the Rest of the World arriving i) to Other Financial Institutions via loans and to Non-Financial Corporations via equity, or ii) coming back to Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem via loans and equity, or iii) to Non-Financial Corporations via equity, making restart the chain from the beginning in all three cases. Further, Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem also exhibit a direct exposure amounting to about the 20 % of their <b>total</b> <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> to Households, via loans and deposits. In turn, Households, other than being exposed to Monetary Financial Institutions excluding the Eurosystem for about 30 % of their <b>total</b> <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> via loans and deposits, are exposed for about 19 % of their <b>total</b> <b>financial</b> <b>assets</b> to Non-MMF Investment Fund equity. From this point the chain starts to coincide with the previous one. These findings shed light on the existence of indirect exposures of the banking system to the financial sector, and in particular, to Non-MMF Investment Funds, and Other Financial Institutions, that could not be identified if the financial system was not regarded as a multilayer financial network, leading to an underestimation of the exposures of the banking sector to the financial sector and the potential associated risks.|$|E

Although the amount of retirement assets is the primary focus of the report, other measures of wealth (such as the amount of <b>total</b> <b>assets,</b> <b>financial</b> <b>assets,</b> <b>total</b> debt, net worth, and housing equity) are also included. The report classifies the amount of assets and debt by the age of the head of the household for both single and married households. In general, the amount of household wealth is higher for married households than for single households. Household wealth generally increases as the age of the head of the household increases, although some measures decrease for those households in which the head of the household is aged 75 or older. In general, the median values are less than the average values, which is an indication that some households hold relatively large amounts of wealth compared with most households...|$|R

Pension funds also participate by about 1. 5 % of the <b>total</b> <b>financial</b> sector <b>assets.</b> In the long history of global financial crisis, and such have been over 120, the current crisis is regarded as among the most profound (similar to that of year 1929) and comprehensive on the speed and breadth of development. The sources of the crisis lie in the three pillars of the functioning of banking institutions: inadequate management of credit risk and liberalization of excessive lending policies; inadequate capitalization of the banking institutions; and inadequate management of their liquidity. Kosovo is part of Europe and cannot act as a closed oasis. The concept of a new model of financial sector in Kosovo is thought to create additional mechanisms that will enable advancements in the development of Kosovo’s financial sector with special focus in the field of investment and that mean financial market development namely the securities market. Legal infrastructure on debt market in Kosovo will create a legal possibility that the central and municipal government have the opportunity to borrow in order to implement their development policies.

This variable has particularly strong power to forecast energy returns, both in sample and out of sample: It forecasts approximately 30 percent {{of the variation in}} quarterly crude oil returns. These findings are rationalized in a simple asset-pricing model where the economic role of broker-dealers is to provide insurance against commodity price fluctuations.

30|$|In this section, {{we discuss}} {{measures}} of market power and bank size, and indicators of efficiency and economies of scale. In the banking literature, market power is measured primarily with the Lerner index (Ariss 2010; Asongu et al. 2018 b). This indicator measures {{the extent to}} which a bank can set prices above its marginal costs. An increase in the Lerner index is associated with greater market power. Two measures of bank size have been used predominantly in the literature: systemic and absolute bank size. Systemic bank size is measured either as the ratio of gross income to GDP (Demirgüç-Kunt and Harry 2011) or bank assets as a percentage of GDP. A bank’s absolute size may be defined as the log of total assets (Demirgüç-Kunt and Harry 2011) or the ratio of bank <b>total</b> <b>assets</b> to <b>total</b> <b>financial</b> system <b>assets</b> (Beck et al. 1999).|$|R
