25|$|The much-anticipated {{second season}} of Serial was {{released}} in December 2015. The subject of Season 2 was met with widespread skepticism.

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, if the {{partitioned}} data {{is to be}} preferred a priori, what prevents one from partitioning the data into arbitrary sub-categories (say based on eye color or post-treatment pain) artificially constructed to yield wrong choices of treatments? Pearl shows that, indeed, in many cases it is the aggregated, not the partitioned data that gives the correct choice of action. Worse yet, given the same table, one should sometimes follow the partitioned and sometimes the aggregated data, depending on <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> data, with each story dictating its own choice. Pearl considers {{this to be the}} real paradox behind Simpson's reversal.|$|E
25|$|In 1910, {{the ballet}} Sheherazade, choreographed by Michael Fokine, premiered in Russia. <b>The</b> <b>story</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> ballet was {{inspired}} by a tone poem written by Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakov. In the ballet the leading female character, Zobeide, is seduced by a Golden Slave. The dancer who portrayed the Golden Slave, the first being Vaslav Nijinsky, would have his face and body painted brown for the performance. This was done to show the audience the slave was of a darker complexion. Later in 1912, Fokine choreographed the ballet Petrushka, which was performed on stage. The ballet centers around three puppets that come to life, Petrushka, the Ballerina, and the Moor. When the ballet premiered, the part of the Moor, first danced by Alexander Orlov, was performed in full blackface. The Moor puppet is first seen onstage playing with a coconut, which he attempts to open with his scimitar. His movements are apelike. The Moor seduces the Ballerina and later savagely cuts off the head of the puppet Petrushka. When Petrushka is performed today, the part of the Moor is still done in full blackface, or occasionally blueface. The blackface has not been publicly criticized in the ballet community. Black and brownface appear in other ballets today, such as La Bayadère and Othello, in the United States and in Europe presently.|$|E

25|$|Similar confusions arose over Darras's keepership of Morfe and Shirlet. Soon after Darras's {{death the}} king conferred {{the office on}} Sir John Cornwall, {{removing}} it from Nicholas Gerard, {{on the grounds that}} the office had not been vacant when Gerard acquired it, although <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> recital of facts is mysterious. There were several Shrewsbury business men named Nicholas Gerard in the 14th century and this seems to be the one served as MP in 1399 and bailiff in 1412. Cornwall soon proved himself tyrannical in office. By March 1410 the king was ordering Arundel and his legal team, John Burley, David Holbache and Thomas Young, together with Lord Furnival, to investigate breaches of customary manorial and grazing rights at Worfield in Morff Forest, made by Arundel's brother-in-law, William de Beauchamp, 1st Baron Bergavenny. Cornwall was clearly quite reckless in his depredations, as there had been similar complaints from William Ferrers, 5th Baron Ferrers of Groby. Joan Beauchamp, Arundel's sister continued to complain about Cornwall into 1412, after she was widowed, prompting a further commission of inquiry by the same team. The following year the king received similar complaints from John Marshall, Dean of the royal free chapel at Bridgnorth It seems that, before sending in Arundel's lawyers to investigate, the king secured Cornwall's resignation and on 13 February 1413 installed Roger Willey, Darras's old business partner, as keeper in his place.|$|E
