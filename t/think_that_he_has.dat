On August 7, 2010, Castro gave his first speech to the National Assembly in four years, urging the U.S. not to take military actions against those nations and warning of a nuclear holocaust. When asked whether Castro may be re-entering government, culture minister Abel Prieto told the BBC, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> always been in Cuba's political life but he is not in the government... He has been very careful about that. His big battle is international affairs." ...|$|E
2500|$|He had {{developed}} a friendship with Keith Kirk, a working-class teenage friend of Francis Skinner, the mathematics undergraduate {{he had had a}} relationship with until Skinner's death in 1941 from polio. Skinner had given up academia, thanks at least in part to Wittgenstein's influence, and had been working as a mechanic in 1939, with Kirk as his apprentice. Kirk and Wittgenstein struck up a friendship, with Wittgenstein giving him lessons in physics to help him pass a City and Guilds exam. During his period of loneliness at Guy's he wrote in his diary: [...] "For ten days I've heard nothing more from K, even though I pressed him a week ago for news. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> perhaps broken with me. A tragic thought!" [...] Kirk had in fact got married, and they never saw one another again.|$|E
2500|$|Despite his celebrated flaws, history records Fox as {{an amiable}} figure. The Tory wit George Selwyn wrote that, [...] "I have passed two evenings with him, and never was anybody so agreeable, {{and the more}} so from his having no pretensions to it". Selwyn also said that [...] "Charles, I am persuaded, would have no {{consideration}} on earth but for what was useful to his own ends. You have heard me say, that I thought he had no malice or rancour; I think so still and am sure of it. But I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> no feeling neither, for anyone but himself; and if I could trace in any one action of his life anything that had not for its object his own gratification, I should with pleasure receive the intelligence because then I had much rather (if it were possible) think well of him than not". Sir Philip Francis said of Fox: [...] "The essential defect in his character {{and the cause of}} all his failures, strange as it may seem, was that he had no heart". Edward Gibbon remarked that [...] "Perhaps no human being was ever more perfectly exempt from the taint of malevolence, vanity, or falsehood." [...] Central to understanding Fox's life was his view that [...] "friendship was the only real happiness in the world." [...] For Fox, politics was the extension of his activities at Newmarket and Brooks's to Westminster. [...] "Fox had little or no interest in the exercise of power." [...] The details of policy – particularly of economics – bored him, in contrast with the intensity of Burke’s legal pursuit of Warren Hastings, and of Pitt’s prosecution of the war against France. Moreover, the Foxites were [...] "the witty and wicked" [...] satellites of their leader, as much friends as political allies.|$|E

2500|$|Kierkegaard {{addressed}} {{this idea of}} proving God in this discourse. He says, [...] "When one grows older, everything becomes so miserable. God in heaven has to sit {{and wait for the}} decision on his fate, whether he exists, and finally he comes into existence {{with the help of a}} few demonstrations; human beings have to put up with waiting for the matter to be decided. Suppose that a person died before that time; suppose that when the matter was finally decided he was not in the practice of thinking about God as a Creator and the joy over that was all gone!" [...] He also said, [...] "Even though the Preacher ordinarily speaks rigorously to people, he nevertheless is so courteous as to assume that you understand that there is a God is not so vain as to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> invented the existence of God. He had already made his decision about Christianity as early as 1835 when he wrote:it is not possible to harvest immediately what one has sown. I will remember that philosopher's method of having his disciples keep silent for three years; then I dare say it will come. Just as one does not begin a feast at sunrise but at sundown, just so in the spiritual world one must work forward for some time before the sun really shines for us and rises in all its glory; for although it is true as it says that God lets his sun shine upon the good and the evil and lets the rain fall on the just and the unjust, it is not so in the spiritual world. So let the die be cast — I am crossing the Rubicon! No doubt this road takes me into battle, but I will not renounce it. I will not lament the past — why lament? I will work energetically and not waste time in regrets, like the person stuck in a bog and first calculating how far he has sunk without recognizing that during the time he spends on that he is sinking still deeper. I will hurry along the path I have found and shout to everyone I meet: Do not look back as Lot's wife did, but remember that we are struggling up a hill.|$|E

60|$|Dave {{was both}} chagrined and angry--chagrined to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> {{been taken in}} so easily, and angry to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was a {{prisoner}} and at his captors' mercy.|$|R

[...] "He {{is certainly}} an altogether exceptionally well-spoken young fellow, for his condition of life; but I can't quite make him out. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> worked as a mill wright. He spoke openly and without hesitation as to his work. But how it is he has thrown it up and emigrated, so young, I can't make out. Of course he cannot have served his time and yet, somehow, I don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> run away, from the manner in which he spoke of his employer.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{told you}} {{we could do}} it," [...] said Tommy Flanders. He was glad of the run, yet tremendously chagrined to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not been {{permitted}} to score.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{should not}} like Comrade Brady," [...] he said, reseating himself, [...] "to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> no friend but his poor old mother, as, you will recollect, {{occurred}} {{on a previous}} occasion." ...|$|E

60|$|Presently he {{returned}} to his seat, and I saw <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was looking at me intently. There was that about his demeanour that led me to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> something to communicate.|$|R
6000|$|... "Which is a proof <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wasn't as poor as they've {{sometimes}} said. I {{should like}} to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> enough, though I don't in the least {{want him to be}} rich." ...|$|R
60|$|Even so good a son {{and brother}} as this, {{when it came to}} his love affair, {{appeared}} to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> yielded much in considering the feelings of his family at all.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, you Kid!" [...] he {{observed}} encouragingly. [...] "I should not like Comrade Brady," [...] he said, reseating himself, [...] "to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> no friend but his poor old mother, as occurred {{on a previous}} occasion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, he's gone, pore chap," [...] {{said his}} friend. [...] "What a blessing it must ha' been {{to him in}} his last moments to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> made {{provision}} for his wife." ...|$|R
