5|$|On 6 July 2005 Trafalgar Square {{hosted the}} {{announcement}} of London's bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics. A countdown clock was erected in March 2011, although engineering and weather-related faults caused it to stop a day later. In 2007, it hosted the opening ceremonies of the Tour de France and was part of <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>for</b> subsequent races.|$|E
5|$|The stadium {{became a}} yearly site for Supercross races in 2005. Seattle {{had been left}} out of the circuit since the Kingdome hosted the race in 1999. It takes more than 650 truckloads of dirt to build <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>for</b> the event that around 50,000 spectators attend.|$|E
5|$|I-70 {{exits the}} valley through De Beque Canyon, a path carved by the Colorado River that {{separates}} the Book Cliffs from Battlement Mesa. The river and its tributaries provide <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>for</b> the ascent up the Rocky Mountains. In the canyon, I-70 enters the Beavertail Mountain Tunnel, {{the first of several}} tunnels built to route the freeway across the Rockies. This tunnel design features a curved sidewall, unusual for tunnels in the United States, where most tunnels feature a curved roof and flat side-walls. Engineers borrowed a European design to give the tunnel added strength. After the canyon winds past the Book Cliffs, the highway follows the Colorado River through a valley containing the communities of Parachute and Rifle.|$|E

5|$|Nonetheless, {{some social}} scientists, such as Zbigniew Brzezinski and Frank Gibney, refer to these changes as a revolution, one less {{dramatic}} than its Hungarian counterpart but one {{which may have}} had an even more profound impact on the Eastern Bloc. Timothy Garton Ash calls the Polish October the most significant event in the post-war history of Poland until the rise of Solidarity. History professor Iván T. Berend claims that while {{the effects of the}} Polish October on the Eastern Bloc may be disputed, it set <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>for</b> the eventual fall of communism in the People's Republic of Poland.|$|E
5|$|Angus College, {{a further}} {{education}} college, has around 8,500 students, with 80% passing <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>for</b> which they enrol. There are around 1,700 full-time students with part-time students {{making up the}} majority of the student population. Arbroath is not a student town and there are no student residences in the town. The student population is made up solely of local students living within commuting distance of the college. Angus College offers courses up to Higher National Diploma (HND) level in a variety of trade related and academic disciplines from construction to Social Sciences, as well as a sizeable number of programs relating to computing, information technology and office administration. A large number of the student body are mature students taking evening classes related to computing, digital photography and various software packages.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels {{was first}} offered the {{position}} of party Gauleiter for the Berlin section in August 1926. He travelled to Berlin in mid-September and {{by the middle of}} October accepted the position. Thus Hitler's plan to divide and dissolve the northwestern Gauleiters group that Goebbels had served in under Strasser was successful. Hitler gave Goebbels great authority over the area, allowing him to determine <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>for</b> organisation and leadership for the Gau. Goebbels was given control over the local Sturmabteilung (SA) and Schutzstaffel (SS) and answered only to Hitler. The party membership numbered about 1,000 when Goebbels arrived, and he reduced it to a core of 600 of the most active and promising members. To raise money, he instituted membership fees and began charging admission to party meetings. Aware of the value of publicity (both positive and negative), he deliberately provoked beer-hall battles and street brawls, including violent attacks on the Communist Party of Germany. Goebbels adapted recent developments in commercial advertising to the political sphere, including the use of catchy slogans and subliminal cues. His new ideas for poster design included using large type, red ink, and cryptic headers that encouraged the reader to examine the fine print to determine the meaning.|$|E

5|$|In February 1931, de Hauteclocque {{went back}} to Saint-Cyr as an instructor, but wanted to return to active service. During the summer break in 1933, he flew south to Africa, where he {{reported}} to Général de brigade Henri Giraud on 11 July. Giraud sent him into the field as a liaison officer with a goum. He was awarded the croix de guerre des théâtres d'opérations extérieures for leading goumiers in an attack on caves and ravines on Bou Amdoun on 11 August. The Commander in Chief in Morocco, Général de division Antoine Huré, felt that de Hauteclocque {{should not have been}} there, and held the award up for three years. Others felt differently, and de Hauteclocque was given early admission to <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>for</b> promotion to capitaine. He placed fourth in the class, and was promoted on 25 December 1934. Promotion was slow in the inter-war French Army, especially in the cavalry, and he was only the second in his Saint-Cyr class to reach that rank. Most had to wait until 1936. He was also made a Chevalier de la Légion d'Honneur.|$|E
5|$|Wilbur {{started the}} fourth and last flight at just about 12 o'clock. The first few hundred feet were up and down, as before, {{but by the time}} three hundred ft had been covered, the machine was under much better control. <b>The</b> <b>course</b> <b>for</b> the next four or five hundred feet had but little undulation. However, when out about eight hundred feet the machine began {{pitching}} again, and, in one of its darts downward, struck the ground. The distance over the ground was measured to be 852 feet; the time of the flight was 59 seconds. The frame supporting the front rudder was badly broken, but {{the main part of the}} machine was not injured at all. We estimated that the machine could be put in condition for flight again in about a day or two.|$|E
25|$|A {{substantial}} sand dune, {{which was}} formed over 1000 years ago, once ran {{parallel to the}} majority of the Frankston coastline and provided <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>for</b> the Frankston railway line (between Mordialloc and Seaford) and for the Nepean Highway (to Olivers Hill).|$|E
30|$|Training: The Task Force {{started a}} more {{concerted effort to}} develop {{professional}} pathways for teachers — resulting {{in the establishment of}} a 3 -tiered training, <b>the</b> Fundamental <b>Course</b> <b>for</b> childcare assistants, <b>the</b> Intermediate <b>Course</b> <b>for</b> childcare teachers and <b>the</b> Advanced <b>Course</b> <b>for</b> centre supervisors. Years later, the required training was raised to the current Diploma in Early Childhood Care and Education (Teaching) for teachers and another Diploma in leadership for centre supervisors.|$|R

25|$|This set {{would have}} been {{considered}} abstract at the time when Cantor devised it.

25|$|While Collins' {{first few}} albums {{consisted}} of straightforward guitar-based folk songs, with 1966's In My Life, she began branching out and including work from such diverse sources as the Beatles, Leonard Cohen, Jacques Brel, and Kurt Weill. Mark Abramson produced and Joshua Rifkin arranged the album, adding lush orchestration {{to many of}} the numbers. The album was a major departure for a folk artist and set <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>for</b> Collins' subsequent work over the next decade.|$|E
25|$|The {{course was}} judged as non-permissible for records until 2008, in which year the organisers changed the elite course to allow for records. The new course begins at sea level {{on the north side}} of the river Tagus, a change which made the course entirely flat. <b>The</b> <b>course</b> <b>for</b> the mass {{participation}} race, which has attracted almost 30,000 runners in previous years, remained unchanged and begins by crossing the Ponte 25 de Abril suspension bridge before linking up with the new elite course.|$|E
25|$|In {{his first}} five starts as a four-year-old, Heart's Cry ran well without winning. In Spring he {{finished}} second in the Group Two Osaka Hai and then ran fifth of the eighteen runners behind Suzuka Mambo in the two mile Tenno Sho. In June he finished strongly to take second place, a neck behind Sweep Tosho in the Takarazuka Kinen, beating major winners such as Zenno Rob Roy and Tap Dance City. He was then off <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>for</b> more than four months.|$|E
40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} organized extracurricular activities for preschool children. The {{aim is to}} find out the contribution of <b>the</b> <b>courses</b> <b>for</b> this age group. Another aim is to chart which extracurricular courses are offered to children by means of nursery schools and which courses are sought by parents and what they expect from them. The thesis is divided into a theoretical and practical part. The theoretical part is devoted to preschool child's development, its leisure time, it also defines organized extracurricular activities, their benefit and risk. The practical part deals with quantitative research. For its realization two types of questionnaires were compiled, one for preschool children's parents and the second one for nursery school teachers. The responses show teachers' and parents' view of <b>the</b> <b>courses</b> organized <b>for</b> preschool children, their expectations and experiences. Finally, there is a comparison of teachers' and parents' view of <b>the</b> <b>courses</b> <b>for</b> preschool children...|$|R

In his attempt to win a third Irish St Leger, he was opposed by five runners including the English St Leger winner Bollin Eric and the improving Aidan O'Brien-trained three-year-old Powerscourt. Vinnie Roe was sent into the lead a furlong {{and a half from}} the finish and stayed on to win by a length from the English four-year-old Gamut.|$|E
25|$|Balakirev became {{important}} {{in the history of}} Russian music through both his works and his leadership. More so than Glinka, he helped set <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>for</b> Russian orchestral music and Russian lyrical song {{during the second half of}} the 19th century. While he learned from Glinka certain methods of treating Russian folk song instrumentally, a bright, transparent orchestral technique (something he also learned from the works of Hector Berlioz) and many elements of his basic style, he developed and expanded upon what he had learned, fusing it satisfactorily with then-advanced Romantic compositional techniques.|$|E
25|$|In 1908, he {{organized}} {{a group of}} 70 founders to contribute $1,000 each, and the National Golf Links of America opened for play in 1909. Many of the holes were his versions of famous holes from British courses, a pattern he would repeat on later courses. Macdonald would tweak <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>for</b> {{the rest of his}} life, altering every hole somewhat over the next 30 years. The course hosted the inaugural Walker Cup in 1922, and is considered a landmark of golf architecture even today. In 2005, Golf Digest ranked it the #9 course in the United States.|$|E
