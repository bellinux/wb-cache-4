500|$|Bart's ballet {{teacher was}} voiced by Susan Sarandon, and was {{designed}} <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit like her. Sarandon {{had wanted to}} guest star on the show because her children were big fans; she brought them {{with her to the}} recording session. Due to a traffic jam, she was late for the recording session, but once she arrived, she fell into character and worked very hard on getting her accent accurate. Sarandon would later have a cameo appearance as the voice of a computer in the season 17 episode [...] "Bart Has Two Mommies". Mel Brooks has a cameo appearance as himself. His wife Anne Bancroft had {{played a role in the}} episode [...] "Fear of Flying" [...] and Brooks had accompanied her to the recording session. David Mirkin realized that Brooks was [...] "dying to do the show" [...] and asked him if he would be willing to do a guest part, and he agreed. Many of the writers were fans of Brooks, and Matt Groening described the chance to have him guest star as [...] "an incredible honor".|$|E
500|$|Writing for The Washington Post, Jerry Doolittle {{thought that}} Bond is [...] "still irresistible to women, still {{handsome}} in a menacing way, still charming. He has nerves {{of steel and}} thews of whipcord", even if [...] "he's starting <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> older." [...] Doolittle was fulsome in his praise for the novel, saying [...] "Fleming's new book will not disappoint his millions of fans". Writing in The New York Times, Anthony Boucher—described by a Fleming biographer, John Pearson as [...] "throughout an avid anti-Bond and an anti-Fleming man"—was again damning, although even he admitted that [...] "you can't argue with success". However, {{he went on to}} say that [...] "simply pro forma, I must set down my opinion that this is a silly and tedious novel." [...] Boucher went on to bemoan that although On Her Majesty's Secret Service was better than The Spy Who Loved Me, [...] "it is still a lazy and inadequate story", going on to say that [...] "my complaint is not that the adventures of James Bond are bad literature... but that they aren't good bad literature". Boucher finished his review lamenting that [...] "they just aren't writing bad books like they used to." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{recognition}} of Torquay’s impressive {{start to the}} season, Paul Buckle was named League Two Manager of the Month for August. [...] However, after a near perfect August, September was to prove something of a reality check for the Gulls. [...] With Torquay’s clean sheet record ending against Port Vale in their previous match, a 2-1 defeat away to Southend in their {{first game of the}} month put to an end a twelve match unbeaten run in the League which had stretched back to March. [...] This was then followed up by two successive 0-0 draws at home to Accrington Stanley and away to Stevenage. [...] Although these results seemed to suggest the Gulls had got their defensive house back in the order, they were now struggling to find the back of the net. [...] With summer signings Billy Kee and Martin Gritton yet to register on the goalscorer charts, and Elliot Benyon out injured for the Accrington game and on the bench for most of the Stevenage match, the Gulls were starting <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> light up front, despite the best efforts of the versatile Chris Zebroski who was being employed as both winger and striker.|$|E

2500|$|After {{establishing}} {{herself as}} a [...] "discovery" [...] of Hal Wallis, Miller soon found herself left behind. In an interview with Mike Fitzgerald, she was quoted as saying, [...] "Hal called me the 'Viking Girl.' He didn't {{know what to do}} with me." [...] The situation was aggravated by the return of veteran actors from overseas, either in uniform or the USO. Compounded by the economic slump after the war, rise of television and the breakup of the studio system, Miller's initial difficulties during the war years would be multiplied many fold. Miller's prospects began <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> better when she met journalist and film producer Mark Hellinger, who felt sure that she could become a star. But Hellinger died suddenly in 1947, and Miller soon found herself making a living with the usual small roles that she had always been given. Of the nine films she would make under contract to Paramount, three were loan-outs to other studios, two of which were more significant than her Paramount films, with the exception of I Walk Alone. Typical of the Paramount years, in Sorry, Wrong Number (1948), she was cast as the wife of the investigating detective but was recast as the mistress of the physician, dropping from 3rd to 13th place in billing.|$|E
