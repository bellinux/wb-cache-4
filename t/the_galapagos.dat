5|$|A week out of Lima, the Beagle reached <b>the</b> <b>Galápagos</b> Islands on 15 September 1835. The {{next day}} Captain FitzRoy dropped anchor {{near the site}} of the modern town of Puerto Baquerizo Moreno on Chatham Island.

5|$|Traditionally, <b>the</b> <b>Galapagos</b> {{sea lion}} and Japanese sea lion were {{classified}} as subspecies of the California sea lion. However, a genetic study in 2007 found that all three are in fact separate species. The lineages of the California and Japanese sea lion appear to have split off 2.2 million years ago during the Pliocene. The California sea lion differs from <b>the</b> <b>Galapagos</b> sea lion in its greater sexual dimorphism. The Steller sea lion is the closest extant relative of the Zalophus sea lions, being a sister taxon.|$|E
5|$|During {{the return}} from <b>the</b> <b>Galápagos</b> through the Sargasso Sea, Beebe once again {{failed to find}} the thick mats of Sargassum whose study {{had been one of}} the primary goals of the expedition. Searching for a way to satisfy his expedition's donors, Beebe hit upon the idea of documenting the marine life of the Hudson Gorge just beyond the shore of New York City. Applying the same {{techniques}} to studying the Hudson Gorge that he had used in <b>the</b> <b>Galápagos,</b> Beebe encountered a surprising variety of sea animals, many of which had previously been thought to be exclusive to the tropics.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there are many}} mammal species, mostly sea mammals such as whales, {{dolphins}} and sea lions.

5|$|Most {{albatrosses}} {{range in}} the Southern Hemisphere from Antarctica to Australia, South Africa and South America. The exceptions to this are the four North Pacific albatrosses, of which three occur exclusively in the North Pacific, from Hawaii to Japan, California and Alaska; and one, the waved albatross, breeds in <b>the</b> <b>Galápagos</b> Islands and feeds {{off the coast of}} South America. The need for wind to enable gliding is the reason albatrosses are for the most part confined to higher latitudes: being unsuited to sustained flapping flight makes crossing the doldrums extremely difficult. The exception, the waved albatross, is able to live in the equatorial waters around <b>the</b> <b>Galápagos</b> Islands because of the cool waters of the Humboldt Current and the resulting winds.|$|E
5|$|Such sulfur flows {{are rare}} on Earth; {{they may be}} more common on the Jupiter moon Io. On Earth, they have been found at Kawah Ijen in Indonesia, Mount Iō (Shiretoko) in Japan, Mauna Loa on Hawaii, Momotombo in Nicaragua, and Sierra Negra on <b>the</b> <b>Galapagos</b> Islands.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Galapagos</b> shark {{is found}} mainly off {{tropical}} oceanic islands. In the Atlantic Ocean, it occurs around Bermuda, the Virgin Islands, Madeira, Cape Verde, Ascension Island, Saint Helena and São Tomé Island. In the Indian Ocean, {{it is known}} from Walter's Shoal off southern Madagascar. In the Pacific Ocean, it occurs around Lord Howe Island, the Marianas Islands, the Marshall Islands, the Kermadec Islands, Tupai, the Tuamotu Archipelago, the Hawaiian Islands, <b>the</b> <b>Galapagos</b> Islands, Cocos Island, the Revillagigedo Islands, Clipperton Island, and Malpelo. There are a few reports of this species in continental waters off the Iberian Peninsula, Baja California, Guatemala, Colombia, and eastern Australia.|$|E

5|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} <b>the</b> <b>Galapagos</b> shark as near threatened, as its low reproductive rate limits {{its capacity to}} withstand population depletion. There is no specific utilization data available, though this species is certainly caught by commercial fisheries operating across many parts of its range. The meat {{is said to be}} of excellent quality. While still common at areas such as Hawaii, <b>the</b> <b>Galapagos</b> shark may have been extirpated from sites around Central America and its fragmented distribution means other regional populations may also be at risk. The populations at the Kermadec and Galapagos Islands are protected within marine reserves.|$|E
5|$|During group interactions, Galapagos {{sharks are}} {{dominant}} to blacktip sharks (C. limbatus) but deferent to silvertip sharks (C. albimarginatus) of equal size. When confronted or cornered, <b>the</b> <b>Galapagos</b> shark may perform a threat display {{similar to that}} of the grey reef shark, in which the shark performs an exaggerated, rolling swimming motion while arching its back, lowering its pectoral fins, puffing out its gills, and gaping its jaw. The shark may also swing its head from side to side, so as to keep the perceived threat within its field of vision. A known parasite of <b>the</b> <b>Galapagos</b> shark is the flatworm Dermophthirius carcharhini, which attaches to the shark's skin. In one account, a bluefin trevally (Caranax melampygus) was seen rubbing against the rough skin of a Galapagos shark to rid itself of parasites.|$|E
5|$|Frigatebirds are unusual among seabirds in {{that they}} often carry blood parasites. Blood-borne {{protozoa}} of the genus Haemoproteus have been recovered from {{four of the five}} species. Bird lice of the ischnoceran genus Pectinopygus and amblyceran genus Colpocephalum and species Fregatiella aurifasciata have been recovered from magnificent and great frigatebirds of <b>the</b> <b>Galapagos</b> Islands. Frigatebirds tended to have more parasitic lice than did boobies analysed in the same study.|$|E

50|$|On <b>the</b> larger <b>Galápagos</b> Islands, four {{ecological}} zones have been defined: coastal, low or dry, transitional and humid. In the first, {{species such as}} myrtle, mangrove and saltbush can be found. In the second grow cactus, the incensé tree, carob tree, poison apple tree, chala and yellow cordia, among others. In the transitional zone taller trees, epiphytes and perennial herbs can be seen. The best known varieties are the cat's claw, espuela de gallo. In the humid sector are <b>the</b> cogojo, <b>Galapagos</b> guava, cat's claw, Galapagos coffee, passionflower and some types of moss, ferns and fungus.|$|R

5|$|From {{specimens}} {{collected in}} 1888, Ridgway {{was the first}} to describe hood mockingbird, large cactus finch, and medium tree finch, all endemic to <b>the</b> <b>Galápagos.</b> The latter two are members of the so-called Darwin's finch group of tanagers, significant for their impact on Charles Darwin's reasoning about evolution and the emergence of new species.|$|E
5|$|Storm petrels nest colonially, for {{the most}} part on islands, {{although}} a few species breed on the mainland, particularly Antarctica. Nesting sites are attended nocturnally in order to avoid predators; the wedge-rumped storm petrels nesting in <b>the</b> <b>Galapagos</b> Islands are the exception to this rule and attend their nesting sites during the day. Storm petrels display high levels of philopatry, returning to their natal colonies to breed. In one instance a band-rumped storm petrel was caught as an adult 2m from its natal burrow. Storm petrels nest either in burrows dug into soil or sand, or in small crevices in rocks and scree. Competition for nesting sites is intense in colonies where storm petrels compete with other burrowing petrels, with shearwaters having been recorded killing storm petrels in order to occupy their burrows. Colonies can be extremely large and dense densities as high as 8 pairs/m2 for band-rumped storm petrels in <b>the</b> <b>Galapagos</b> and colonies 3.6 million strong for Leach's storm petrel have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} {{is tall and}} {{moderately}} falcate (sickle-shaped), with the origin over the pectoral fin rear tips. It {{is followed by a}} low midline ridge running to the second dorsal fin. The second dorsal fin originates over the anal fin. The pectoral fins are large with pointed tips. The coloration is brownish gray above and white below, with a faint white stripe on the sides. The edges of the fins are darker but not prominently marked. <b>The</b> <b>Galapagos</b> shark can be distinguished from the dusky shark in having taller first and second dorsal fins and larger teeth, and it can be distinguished from the grey reef shark in having a less robust body and less pointed first dorsal fin tip. However, these characters can be difficult to discern in the field. These similar species also have different numbers of precaudal (before the tail) vertebrae: 58 in <b>the</b> <b>Galapagos</b> shark, 8697 in the dusky shark, 110119 in the grey reef shark.|$|E

40|$|Oceanic island volcanoes such {{as those}} in the Hawaiian, Canary and Galapagos Islands are known to become unstable, causing {{failures}} of the subaerial and submarine slopes of the volcanic edifices. These mass wasting events appear to be the primary source of destruction and loss of volume of many oceanic islands, but our knowledge of mass wasting is still rudimentary in many seamount and island chains. To better understand mass wasting in <b>the</b> western <b>Galapagos</b> Islands, multi-beam bathymetry and backscatter sidescan sonar images were used to examine topography and acoustic backscatter signatures that are characteristic of mass wasting. Observations show that mass wasting {{plays an important role in}} <b>the</b> development of <b>Galapagos</b> volcanoes. While volcanic activity continues to conceal the submarine terrain, the data show that four forms of mass wasting are identified including debris flows, slumps sheets, chaotic slumps, and detached blocks. A total of 23 mass wasting features were found to exist in <b>the</b> western <b>Galapagos</b> Islands, including fourteen debris flows with one that incorporated a set of detached blocks, seven slump sheets, and one chaotic slump. Some of the indentified features have obvious origination zones while the sources of others are not clearly identifiable. Approximately 73 percent of the surveyed coastlines are affected by slumping on the steep upper slopes and ~ 64 percent are affected by debris flows on the lower slopes. Unlike the giant landslides documented by GLORIA imagery around the Hawaiian Islands, <b>the</b> western <b>Galapagos</b> Islands appear to be characterized by small slump sheets existing along the steep shallow submarine flanks of the island and by debris flows that are flanked by rift zones and extend off the platform. This study indicates that submarine mass wasting is widespread in <b>the</b> western <b>Galapagos,</b> suggesting that <b>the</b> production of small-scale downslope movement is part of the erosive nature of these oceanic volcanic islands...|$|R
5|$|Based on {{morphological}} similarities, Jack Garrick in 1982 grouped {{this species}} with the bignose shark (C. altimus) and the sandbar shark (C. plumbeus), while Leonard Compagno in 1988 placed {{it as the}} sister species of the grey reef shark (C. amblyrhynchos). A phylogenetic analysis based on allozyme data, published by Gavin Naylor in 1992, indicated that the Caribbean reef shark is the sister taxon to a clade formed by <b>the</b> <b>Galapagos</b> shark (C. galapagensis), dusky shark (C. obscurus), oceanic whitetip shark (C. longimanus), and the blue shark (Prionace glauca). However, more work is required to fully resolve the interrelationships within Carcharhinus.|$|E
