25|$|The {{bioavailability}} of <b>tianeptine</b> {{is approximately}} 99%. Its plasma protein binding is about 95%. The metabolism of <b>tianeptine</b> is hepatic. Its elimination half-life is 2.5 to 3hours. The elimination half-life {{has been found}} to be increased to 4 to 9hours in the elderly. The drug has an active metabolite, with a much longer elimination half-life. <b>Tianeptine</b> is excreted 65% in the urine and 15% in feces.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tianeptine</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} to be very effective for asthma. In August 1998, Dr. Fuad Lechin and colleagues at the Central University of Venezuela Institute of Experimental Medicine in Caracas published the results of a 52-week randomized controlled trial of asthmatic children; the children in the groups that received <b>tianeptine</b> had a sharp decrease in clinical rating and increased lung function. Two years earlier, they had found a close, positive association between free serotonin in plasma and severity of asthma in symptomatic persons. As <b>tianeptine</b> was the only agent known to both reduce free serotonin in plasma and enhance uptake in platelets, they decided to use it to see if reducing free serotonin levels in plasma would help. By November 2004, there had been two double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trials and a >25,000 person open-label study lasting over seven years, all showing effectiveness. A 2005 study in Egypt demonstrated <b>tianeptine</b> to be effective in men with depression and erectile dysfunction. <b>Tianeptine</b> also has anticonvulsant and analgesic effects, and a clinical trial in Spain that ended in January 2007 has shown that <b>tianeptine</b> is effective in treating pain due to fibromyalgia. <b>Tianeptine</b> has been shown to have efficacy with minimal side effects in the treatment of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, <b>tianeptine</b> {{was found}} to be a μ-opioid {{receptor}} (MOR) full agonist using human proteins. It was also found to act as a full agonist of the δ-opioid receptor (DOR), although with approximately 200-fold lower potency. The same researchers subsequently found that the MOR is required for the acute and chronic antidepressant-like behavioral effects of <b>tianeptine</b> in mice and that its primary metabolite had similar activity as a MOR agonist but with a much longer elimination half-life. Moreover, although <b>tianeptine</b> produced other opioid-like behavioral effects such as analgesia and reward, it did not result in tolerance or withdrawal. The authors suggested that <b>tianeptine</b> may be acting as a biased agonist of the MOR and that this may be responsible for its atypical profile as a MOR agonist. However anecdotal reports from recreational, non-medical <b>tianeptine</b> users suggest that significant withdrawal effects resembling those of other typical opioid drugs (including but not limited to depression, insomnia, cold/flu-like symptoms) do manifest following prolonged high dose usage. In addition to its therapeutic effects, activation of the MOR is likely to also be responsible for the abuse potential of <b>tianeptine</b> at high doses that are well above the normal therapeutic range.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, {{according}} to French Health Products Safety Agency, <b>tianeptine's</b> manufacturer Servier agreed {{to modify the}} drug's label, following problems with dependency.|$|R
25|$|Although several related {{compounds}} are disclosed {{in the original}} patent, {{it is unclear whether}} these share <b>tianeptine's</b> unique pharmacological effects. Amineptine, the most closely related drug to have been widely studied, is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor with no significant effect on serotonin levels.|$|R
25|$|In {{contrast}} to most SSRIs and tricyclic antidepressants, <b>tianeptine</b> modestly enhances the mesolimbic release of dopamine and potentiates CNS D2 and D3 receptors, {{but it is}} also unclear how this occurs because <b>tianeptine</b> has no affinity for the dopamine transporter or the dopamine receptors.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tianeptine</b> {{has been}} {{intravenously}} injected by drug users in Russia. This {{method of administration}} reportedly causes an opioid-like effect and is sometimes used {{in an attempt to}} lessen opioid withdrawal symptoms. <b>Tianeptine</b> tablets contain silica and do not dissolve completely. Often the solution is not filtered well thus particles in the injected fluid block capillaries, leading to thrombosis and then severe necrosis. Thus, in Russia <b>tianeptine</b> (sold under the brand name “Coaxil”) is a Schedule III controlled substance in the same list as the majority of benzodiazepines and barbiturates.|$|E

25|$|Under {{the code}} names JNJ-39823277 and TPI-1062, <b>tianeptine</b> was {{previously}} under {{development for the}} treatment of major depressive disorder in the United States and Belgium. Phase I clinical trials were completed in Belgium and the United States in May and June 2009, respectively. For reasons that are unclear, development of <b>tianeptine</b> was discontinued in both countries in January 2012.|$|E
25|$|When co-administered with morphine, <b>tianeptine</b> {{prevents}} morphine-induced {{respiratory depression}} without impairing analgesia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tianeptine</b> has {{antidepressant}} and anxiolytic effects with {{a relative}} lack of sedative, anticholinergic, and cardiovascular side effects. It {{has been found to}} act as an atypical agonist of the μ-opioid receptor with clinically negligible effects on the δ- and κ-opioid receptors. μ-Opioid receptor agonists typically induce euphoria, and in accordance, <b>tianeptine</b> does so at high doses well above the normal therapeutic range.|$|E
25|$|Recreational use of <b>tianeptine</b> is {{rare and}} {{thus far has}} only been seen in persons already using {{multiple}} substances for recreational purposes. 141 cases of recreational use were identified in France between 1989 and 2004, correlating to an incidence of 1 to 3 cases per 1000 persons treated with <b>tianeptine</b> and 45 between 2006 and 2011. The main reason for recreational use is to achieve an anxiolytic effect. According to Servier, cessation of treatment with <b>tianeptine</b> is difficult, due {{to the possibility of}} withdrawal symptoms in a person. The severity of the withdrawal is dependent on the daily dose, with high doses being extremely difficult to quit.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tianeptine</b> shows {{efficacy}} against serious depressive episodes (major depression), {{comparable to}} amitriptyline, imipramine and fluoxetine, but with significantly fewer side effects. It {{was shown to}} be more effective than maprotiline in a group of people with co-existing depression and anxiety. <b>Tianeptine</b> also displays significant anxiolytic properties and is useful in treating a spectrum of anxiety disorders including panic disorder, as evidenced by a study in which those administered 35% CO2 gas (carbogen) on paroxetine or <b>tianeptine</b> therapy showed equivalent panic-blocking effects. Like many antidepressants (including bupropion, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, moclobemide and numerous others) it may also have a beneficial effect on cognition in people with depression-induced cognitive dysfunction.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tianeptine</b> {{has been}} found to be {{effective}} in depression in Parkinson's disease and in post-traumatic stress disorder of which it was as safe and effective as fluoxetine and moclobemide. A clinical trial has been conducted to compare its efficacy and tolerability with amitriptyline in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. The results of this trial showed that <b>tianeptine</b> was at least as effective as amitriptyline and produced less prominent adverse effects such as dry mouth and constipation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tianeptine</b> was {{discovered}} and patented by the French Society of Medical Research in the 1960s. Currently, <b>tianeptine</b> is approved in France and manufactured and marketed by Laboratories Servier SA; {{it is also}} marketed {{in a number of}} other European countries under the trade name Coaxil as well as in Asia (including Singapore) and Latin America as Stablon and Tatinol but it is not available in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, or the United States.|$|E
25|$|Research {{suggests}} that <b>tianeptine</b> produces its antidepressant effects through indirect alteration of glutamate receptor activity (i.e., AMPA receptors and NMDA receptors) and release of , in turn affecting neural plasticity. Some researchers hypothesize that <b>tianeptine</b> has a protective effect against stress induced neuronal remodeling. There is also {{action on the}} NMDA and AMPA receptors. In animal models, <b>tianeptine</b> inhibits the pathological stress-induced changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission in the amygdala and hippocampus. It may also facilitate signal transduction at the CA3 commissural associational synapse by altering the phosphorylation state of glutamate receptors. With {{the discovery of the}} rapid and novel antidepressant effects of drugs such as ketamine, many believe the efficacy of antidepressants is related to promotion of synaptic plasticity. This may be achieved by regulating the excitatory amino acid systems that are responsible for changes in the strength of synaptic connections as well as enhancing BDNF expression, although these findings are based largely on preclinical studies.|$|E
25|$|Research {{indicates}} possible anticonvulsant (anti-seizure) and analgesic (painkilling) {{activity of}} <b>tianeptine</b> via downstream modulation of adenosine A1 receptors (as the effects could be experimentally blocked by antagonists of this receptor).|$|E
25|$|Treatment with {{monoamine oxidase}} inhibitors (MAOIs) 14 days or less prior to {{treatment}} with <b>tianeptine.</b> Due {{to the potential}} for cardiovascular effects (including hypertension and cardiovascular collapse), convulsions, hyperthermia (high body temperature) and death.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tianeptine,</b> {{sold under}} the brand names Stablon and Coaxil among others, is an {{atypical}} antidepressant {{which is used}} mainly {{in the treatment of}} major depressive disorder, although it may also be used to treat anxiety, asthma, and irritable bowel syndrome. In terms of chemical structure, it is technically a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), but it has a very different drug profile than other TCAs, and is not usually grouped with them.|$|E
2500|$|Initial {{studies found}} that upon acute and {{repeated}} administration, <b>tianeptine</b> decreased the extracellular levels of serotonin in rat brain without a decrease in serotonin release and it was hence called a [...] "(selective) serotonin reuptake enhancer". In vitro <b>tianeptine</b> and its two principal metabolites showed no effects on monoamine uptake, release or neurotransmitter receptor binding in rats. The (−) enantiomer is more active in this sense than the (+) enantiomer. However, more recent {{studies found that}} long-term administration of <b>tianeptine</b> does not elicit any marked alterations (neither increases nor decreases) in extracellular levels of serotonin in rats. However, coadministration of <b>tianeptine</b> and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor fluoxetine inhibited tianeptine's effect on long-term potentiation in hippocampal CA1 area. This is considered an argument for the opposite effects of <b>tianeptine</b> and fluoxetine on serotonin uptake, {{although it has been}} shown that fluoxetine can be partially substituted for <b>tianeptine</b> in animal studies.|$|E
2500|$|Compared {{to other}} [...] it {{produces}} significantly fewer cardiovascular, anticholinergic (like dry mouth or constipation), sedative and appetite-stimulating effects. A recent review {{found that it}} was amongst the antidepressants most prone to causing hepatotoxicity (liver damage), although the evidence to support this concern was of limited quality. Although not well studied with <b>tianeptine,</b> it has been shown for tricyclic antidepressants that they may cause cardiac arrhythmias.|$|E
2500|$|Singapore's Ministry of Health has {{restricted}} {{the use of}} <b>tianeptine</b> to psychiatrists due to its recreational potential, while Bahrain has classified it a controlled substance due to increasing reports of misuse and recreational use by persons. In September 2012, France began treating Stablon as a controlled substance. Its use now requires a [...] "secure prescription" [...] form in France, just as is required for narcotics.|$|E
2500|$|A {{very small}} number of cases {{involving}} non-medical use of antidepressants have been reported over the past 30 years. According to the US government classification of psychiatric medications, TCAs are [...] "non-abusable" [...] and generally have low abuse potential. Nonetheless due to their atypical MOA, amineptine and <b>tianeptine</b> (dopamine reuptake inhibition and μ-opioid receptor agonism, respectively) are the two TCAs with the highest addiction and abuse potential. Several cases of the misuse of amitriptyline alone or together with methadone or in other drug dependent patients and of dosulepin with alcohol or in methadone patients have been reported.|$|E
50|$|TNX-701 (<b>tianeptine</b> tablets), for PTSD is in {{preclinical}} development. TNX-601 {{is a novel}} oral {{formulation of}} <b>tianeptine.</b> Currently there is no tianeptine-containing product approved in the U.S., but <b>tianeptine</b> sodium (amorphous) has been marketed in Europe, Asia, and Latin America {{for the treatment of}} depression since 1987. Tonix has discovered a novel salt and polymorph which may provide improved stability, consistency, and manufacturability relative to the known forms of <b>tianeptine.</b> Like cyclobenzaprine, <b>tianeptine</b> shares structural similarities with classic tricyclic antidepressants, but it has unique pharmacological and neurochemical properties. <b>Tianeptine</b> modulates the glutamatergic system indirectly and reverses the inhibitory neuroplasticity observed during periods of stress and steroid use. It is a weak mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist, but does not have significant affinity for known neurotransmitter receptors. <b>Tianeptine</b> has an established safety profile based on its decades of use in many European, Asian, and Latin American countries. TNX-601 is being developed as a first line monotherapy for PTSD for daytime dosing.|$|E
