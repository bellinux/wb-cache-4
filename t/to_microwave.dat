In early 1976, the State Department made public {{the fact that the}} Soviet Union had been beaming microwaves at the Moscow Embassy from a nearby building for many years. This caused concern about possible health effects of the low-level microwave radiation.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Microwaves produce various {{detrimental}} changes {{based on}} actions of heat or non-specific stress, although {{the effects of}} microwaves on pregnant organisms has not been uniform. This {{study was designed to}} clarify the effect of exposure <b>to</b> <b>microwaves</b> during pregnancy on endocrine and immune functions. METHODS: Natural killer cell activity and natural killer cell subsets in the spleen were measured, as well as some endocrine indicators in blood [...] corticosterone and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) as indices of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis [...] beta-endorphin, oestradiol, and progesterone in six female virgin rats and six pregnant rats (nine to 11 days gestation) exposed <b>to</b> <b>microwaves</b> at 10 mW/cm 2 incident power density at 2450 MHz for 90 minutes. The same measurements were performed in control rats (six virgin and six pregnant rats). RESULTS: Skin temperature in virgin and pregnant rats increased immediately after exposure <b>to</b> <b>microwaves.</b> Although splenic activity of natural killer cells and any of the subset populations identified by the monoclonal antibodies CD 16 and CD 57 did not differ in virgin rats with or without exposure <b>to</b> <b>microwaves,</b> pregnant rats exposed <b>to</b> <b>microwaves</b> showed a significant reduction of splenic activity of natural killer cells and CD 16 +CD 57 -. Although corticosterone and ACTH increased, and oestradiol decreased in exposed virgin and pregnant rats, microwaves produced significant increases in beta-endorphin and progesterone only in pregnant rats. CONCLUSIONS: Microwaves at the power of 10 mW/cm 2 produced activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and increased oestradiol in both virgin and pregnant rats, suggesting that microwaves greatly stress pregnant organisms. These findings in pregnant rats suggest that [...] with exposure <b>to</b> <b>microwaves</b> [...] pregnancy induces immunosuppression, which could result in successful maintainance of pregnancy. This enhancement of adaptability to heat stress with pregnancy may be mediated by activation of placental progesterone and placental or pituitary beta-endorphin...|$|R

25|$|Most EPR {{machines}} are reflection spectrometers, {{meaning that the}} detector should only be exposed <b>to</b> <b>microwave</b> radiation {{coming back from the}} cavity. This is achieved by the use of a device known as the circulator which directs the microwave radiation (from the branch that is heading towards the cavity) into the cavity. Reflected microwave radiation (after absorption by the sample) is then passed through the circulator towards the detector, ensuring it does not go back to the microwave source. The reference signal and reflected signal are combined and passed to the detector diode which converts the microwave power into an electrical current.|$|E

40|$|One {{method of}} beaming to Earth energy {{captured}} by Space Solar Power (SSP) satellites is by using microwaves. Since microwaves are non-ioniz ing and of low energy they probably {{will have little}} or no direct eff ect (either long- or short-term) on terrestrial biota. This contentio n must to be proved however, before the public will accept a continuo us beam of <b>microwaves</b> being sent <b>to</b> the ground near populated areas or onto agricultural lands. To begin to address this question, an exper iment has been done that exposed an important agronomic plant speaes (alfalfa, Medicago sativa L.) <b>to</b> a continuous <b>microwave</b> beam at 2. 45 GHz and from between 0. 5 to 1. 2 milli-watts per square centimeter. Th e hypothesis was that plants exposed <b>to</b> <b>microwaves</b> will be no differe nt from those control plants that were not exposed <b>to</b> <b>microwaves.</b> The microwaves were broadcast over a tray of mature, growing plants in the laboratory. The control plants were subjected to the same environme ntal conditions (light, temperature, soil and nutrients) minus the mi crowave exposure. Both populations of plants were watered as needed. As may be seen, the experiment was designed so that the only variable to which the test plants were subjected was microwave exposure. Prec ise, non-destructive measurements were taken of leaf chlorophyll concentration over the period of the experiment. Also measured were gross plant variables such as stem length, internodal distance, and, {{at the end of the}} experiment, above-ground biomass, both fresh and dry weig hts.
