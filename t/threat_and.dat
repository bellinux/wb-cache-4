5|$|For Rhodes, throffers can {{not merely}} be {{biconditional}} proposals. If Q proposes that P pay $10,000 so that Q withholds {{information that would}} lead to Ps arrest, then {{despite the fact that the}} proposal is biconditional (that is, P may choose to pay or not pay, which would lead to different outcomes) it is not a throffer. This is because choosing to pay cannot be considered attractive for P independent of Qs proposal. Ps paying of Q does not lead to the satisfaction of an attainment-want, which is a necessary condition for a proposal's being an offer under Rhodes's account. The exception to this is when an agent offers to help another overcome a background threat (a threat that was not introduced by the proposal). Biconditionals, in addition to either threats or offers, may contain neutral proposals, and so not be throffers. The possibility of another agent's not acting is necessarily neutral. Throffers are those biconditional proposals that contain both a <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> an offer, as opposed to biconditional proposals containing a <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> neutral proposal, or an offer and a neutral proposal. In the case of throffers, it is always going to be difficult or even impossible to determine whether an agent acts on the threatening aspect of the proposal or the offer.|$|E

40|$|Every day {{media reports}} acts of {{violence}} in various kinds. Crime statistics shows that <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> violence are increasing in regard to both frequency and intensity within the nation. Nurses in the ambulance service are often the first {{to meet with a}} patient, therefore these nurses often find themselves in situations where violence <b>and</b> <b>threats</b> occur or have occurred. Drug addiction or some kind of illness are often reasons behind <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> violence. Earlier studies within this area of knowledge are mostly foreign and therefore little describes Swedish nurses` experiences of <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> violence within the ambulance service. The {{purpose of this study was}} to describe nurses experiences of <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> violence in the meeting with patients within the ambulance service. The study is a qualitative interview study performed within the School of Life Sciences at the University of Skövde. Six nurses were interviewed with the criterion that they should have experienced <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> violence within their occupation. The primary information was analyzed with a qualitative method. The result showed that <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> violence occur within the occupation and that the nurses feel exposed for the same. It indicated that the types of <b>threat</b> vary <b>and</b> that the education concerning how <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> violence should be handled is considered poor by the nurses themselves. The result also showed that the patient care is affected by the amount of <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> violence that the nurses are exposed to. There is a need for further research within this area of knowledge and within education in how to handle these situations for personnel in the ambulance service...|$|R

40|$|<b>Threats</b> <b>and</b> {{violence}} {{is a problem that}} has received increased attention in the Swedish pre-hospital care in recent years, however, there have been only a handful of scientific studies in this area. <b>Threats</b> <b>and</b> {{violence is}} a major health and safety problems in healthcare and it might mean a daily mental stress to worry about being subjected to intimidation or violence. This is a common problem but it is still missing a lot of knowledge on the subject. Aim {{of this study was to}} describe ambulance nurse's experiences of being subjected to <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> violence prehospital setting. In this interview study used a qualitative approach, to get a picture of the interviewee's experiences. Eight ambulance nurses were interviewed and the interviews were then analyzed by qualitative manifest content analysis. The results showed that ambulance nurses felt that patient care was deteriorating because of <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> violence and that those with their own treatment could avert violence. Ambulance nurses had shared experiences they had adequate training to deal with <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> violence or not, but they felt that clear guidelines were missing and they were hard to follow. In all the interviews revealed the importance of security and ambulance nurses felt that they used his own experience, his colleague, preparation and risk assessment in order to increase security and prevent intimidation and violence. By describing the ambulance nurse perceptions of <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> violence, the authors wanted to increase awareness <b>and</b> knowledge of <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> violence prehospital setting. The authors' hope is that this knowledge may be used to secure ambulance nurses must be able to deal with <b>threats</b> <b>and</b> violence, and that it leads to an improved quality of care.

5|$|After Trespass was recorded, {{ill health}} and {{developing}} stage fright caused Phillips to leave Genesis. His last show {{with the band}} took place in Haywards Heath on 18 July 1970.

He had contracted bronchial pneumonia and became isolated {{from the rest of}} the band, feeling that it had too many songwriters in it. Banks, Gabriel, and Rutherford saw Phillips as an important member, being the most instrumental in encouraging them to turn professional. They regarded his exit as the band's greatest <b>threat</b> <b>and</b> the most difficult to overcome. Gabriel and Rutherford decided they would continue; Banks agreed on the condition that they find a new drummer that was of equal stature to the rest of the group.
