25|$|The Chrism Mass, whose texts the Roman Missal now gives under Holy Thursday, {{but before}} the Paschal Triduum, which begins that evening, may be brought forward to one of <b>these</b> <b>days,</b> <b>to</b> {{facilitate}} participation {{by as many as}} possible of the clergy of the diocese together with the bishop. This Mass was not included in editions of the Roman Missal before the time of Pope Pius XII. In this Mass, the bishop blesses separate oils for the sick (used in Anointing of the Sick), for catechumens (used in Baptism) and chrism (used in Baptism, but especially in Confirmation and Holy Orders, as well as in rites such as the dedication of an altar and a church).|$|E

The slightly cynical, [...] "What a gratifying thing it is in <b>these</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> meet with a female devoted to family life" [...] was revised to read, [...] "What a funny sight it is to see a brood of ducklings with a hen." [...] The tale is complicated with irony (the feather-filled shed and the herbs for roasting a duck) and the co-existence of two time sequences or two different points of view: Kep's as he seeks {{the assistance of the}} fox-hounds in rescuing Jemima, and the sandy-whiskered gentleman's as he waits nervously for Jemima to return with the herbs.|$|E

In 1922, {{he became one}} of the charter members of the Adirondack Mountain Club (ADK), an organization devoted to the building and maintenance of trails and the teaching of hiking in the park. In 1922, he prepared a 38-page guidebook, entitled The High Peaks of the Adirondacks. Based on his pioneering experiences on the peaks, the guide recommends that [...] "it's a great thing <b>these</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> leave civilization for a while and return to nature." [...] Marshall provided a brief description of each peak and arranged them in order of [...] "niceness of view and all around pleasure in view and climb." ...|$|E

500|$|Almost {{ten years}} later, [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know" [...] was {{performed}} by Spears on 2011's Femme Fatale Tour. The performance consists of Spears sitting on a swing singing the song, whilst a male dancer dances beneath her, at one point attaching himself by his feet to the swing whilst midair. Shirley Halperin of The Hollywood Reporter named {{it one of the}} best performances of the show along with [...] "Piece of Me" [...] and [...] "3", stating that [...] "ironically enough, [...] were the ones with fewest frills." [...] In a review of the special broadcast by American premium television channel Epix of the tour, Jocelyn Vena of MTV summarized her thoughts about the performance saying, [...] "It's rare <b>these</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> see Britney Spears show her soft side, but she takes a break from the nonstop, fist-pumping music during the spectacle that is the Femme Fatale Tour and kicks it old-school, showing us she still has the heart and soul to bust out a power ballad." ...|$|E
500|$|Beckinsale rose to fame in 2001 with {{a leading}} role in the war film Pearl Harbor as a nurse torn between two pilots, played by Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett. She was drawn to the project by the script: [...] "It's so unusual <b>these</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> read a script that has those old-fashioned values to it. Not morals, but movie values. It's a big, {{sweeping}} epic....You just never get the chance to do that." [...] Director Michael Bay initially had doubts about casting the actress: [...] "I wasn't sure about her at first...she wore black leather trousers in her screen test and I thought she was a little nasty...it was easy to think of this woman as a slut." [...] He eventually decided to hire her because she wasn't [...] "too beautiful. Women feel disturbed when they see someone’s too pretty." [...] He asked her to lose weight during filming. In a 2004 interview, the actress noted that his comments were [...] "upsetting" [...] and said she wore leather trousers because [...] "it was snowing out. It wasn't exactly like I had my nipple rings in." [...] She felt grateful that she had not had to deal with such criticism at a younger age: [...] "If I had come on to a movie set at [...] age and someone had said, 'You're a bit funny-looking, can you go on a diet?'—I might have jumped off a building. I just didn't have the confidence to put that into perspective at the time." [...] However, speaking in 2011, she said she was [...] "very fond" [...] of Bay. Pearl Harbor received negative reviews. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly praised [...] "the avid eyed, ruby lipped Kate Beckinsale, the rare actress whose intelligence gives her a sensual bloom; she's like Parker Posey without irony." [...] A.O.Scott of The New York Times noted that [...] "Mr.Affleck and Ms.Beckinsale do what they can with their lines, and glow with the satiny shine of real movie stars." [...] However, Mike Clark of USA Today felt that the [...] "usually appealing Kate Beckinsale" [...] is [...] "inexplicably submerged—like her hospital colleagues—under heaps of tarty makeup that even actresses of the era didn't wear." [...] The film was a commercial success, grossing $449 million worldwide.|$|E

[...] He polled the team, and they chose, among others, [...] "South of the Border" [...] due to El Paso's proximity to Mexico, Silent Night, Jingle Bells, and [...] "Jumpin Jive." [...] Bergman [...] "moaned" [...] to the Washington Post that [...] "you have got be a combined diplomat, coach, Toscanini and Shirley Povich <b>these</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> run a football team." ...|$|E

It's hard, <b>these</b> <b>days,</b> <b>to</b> find such messages of good cheer." [...] Cockburn took an anti-assimilationist position on same-sex marriage asking [...] "Why would an institution which is basically taking church principles, you know, and applying them to a state license to get marriage be regarded as 'progressive'?" [...] He felt it was inconsistent with a radical position, which sees the state as [...] "intrusive on human freedoms", though he did support equality {{at the level of}} civil partnerships he didn't see why this should be limited to monogamous relationships.|$|E
