5|$|By extrapolating the now-eroded {{and tilted}} beds upward, geologists have {{determined}} that <b>these</b> <b>mountains</b> were several kilometers high. Similar projections of the tilted beds downward, coupled with geophysical measurements on the greenstone belts in Canada, suggest the metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks of the belts project downward {{at least a few}} kilometers.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} Victorville area the scenery changes, as {{suburban}} neighborhoods disappear and the highway traverses the Mojave Desert. While crossing the desert, the route clips the northeastern corner of Edwards Air Force Base. Just past the base the road intersects SR 58 at Kramer Junction. This is currently an at-grade intersection; however, SR58 is gradually being upgraded to a freeway. After leaving Kramer Junction 395 passes the Kramer Junction Solar Electric Generating Station. US395 crosses the Rand and El Paso Mountains, where the highway crosses into San Bernardino–Kern county line, near Johannesburg. While traversing <b>these</b> <b>mountains</b> the route crosses a former Southern Pacific rail line, {{now owned by}} the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) that loosely follows the route of State Route 14 through the Mojave. Though the railroad is abandoned north of Searles Station, US 395 parallels the old railroad grade from this point to Lone Pine.|$|E
5|$|Rocks {{and land}} {{at the foot of}} <b>these</b> <b>mountains</b> is calcarenite, a coral sand, blown inland during the Pleistocene between 130,000 and 20,000 years ago and {{cemented}} into stratified layers by water percolation. In this rock are fossils of bird bones and eggs, land and marine snails and the extinct endemic horned turtle (Meiolania platyceps) now thought to be an ancient relictual non-swimming tortoise with relatives in South America. The crescent of the island protects a coral reef and lagoon, the barrier reef, at 31° S, is the most southerly in the world. Beach sands, rather than consisting of quartz grains derived from granite, as on the mainland, are made of fragments of shell, coral and coralline algae, together with basalt grains, and basaltic minerals like black diopside, and green olivine. The lowland consists of alluvial soils.|$|E

5|$|<b>These</b> <b>mountains</b> {{and hills}} are traversed by an {{extensive}} network of river valleys {{and are in}} most cases covered with dense rainforest. There are lower ranges of hills extending towards the western coasts, southern plains, and the interior or central part of Sabah. The central and eastern portion of Sabah are generally lower mountain ranges and plains with occasional hills. In the east coast located the Kinabatangan River, which is the second longest river in Malaysia after Rajang River in Sarawak with a length of 560 kilometres. The river begins from the western ranges and snakes {{its way through the}} central region towards the east coast out into the Sulu Sea. Other major rivers including the Kalabakan River, Kolopis River, Liwagu River, Padas River, Paitan River, Segama River and Sugut River. In addition to Babagon River, Bengkoka River, Kadamaian River, Kalumpang River, Kiulu River, Mawao River, Membakut River, Mesapol River, Nabawan River, Papar River, Pensiangan River, Tamparuli River and Wario River.|$|E

25|$|A great arc of mountains, {{consisting}} of the Himalayas of Nepal, Hindu Kush, and Patkai ranges define the northern Indian subcontinent. These were formed by the ongoing tectonic plates collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates. The mountains in these ranges include some of the world's tallest mountains which act as a natural barrier to cold polar winds. They also facilitate the monsoon winds which in turn influence the climate in India. Rivers originating in <b>these</b> <b>mountains</b> flow through the fertile Indo–Gangetic plains. <b>These</b> <b>mountains</b> are recognised by biogeographers as the boundary {{between two of the}} Earth's great ecozones: the temperate Palearctic that covers most of Eurasia and the tropical and subtropical Indomalaya ecozone which includes the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Indonesia.|$|E
25|$|Many Irish {{mountains}} are also of geological distinction, {{most of them}} being formed in the Caledonian or Amorican era. <b>These</b> <b>mountains,</b> formed between 400 and 250 million years ago, {{would have been the}} same height as the Alps, but due to weathering, have become much smaller over time.|$|E

25|$|Developments in {{the region}} are {{dependent}} on the terrain and climate, as it is composed mostly of semi-arid plains that cannot support a dense population.

25|$|In {{addition}} to its rugged mountains, the area is known for severe winters with heavy snowfalls.

25|$|It {{was formed}} when {{islands in the}} Klamath {{microcontinent}} collided, uplifting primordial mountains composed of mostly sandstone. Ancient rivers eroded <b>these</b> <b>mountains,</b> and the sediment and sandstone was deposited on the seashore. Then, the microcontinent collided with the North American continent, uplifting Humbug Mountain in the process. Near the summit, rock outcrops of granite and sandstone can still be found.|$|E

Palermo is home to a natural port and offers excellent views to the sea, especially from Monte Pellegrino.|$|E
25|$|The Powder River basin {{is shaped}} like a large shallow bowl, with its westernmost rock {{formations}} lying against the Big Horn Mountains. As <b>these</b> <b>mountains</b> uplifted over eons of geologic time they lifted and tilted the sedimentary rocks from the Powder River basin, which were then eroded away, creating the plains that stretch eastward from the mountains into the basin. Generally there are older sedimentary layers closer to the mountains and younger layers farther away.|$|E
