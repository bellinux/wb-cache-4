50|$|Watt {{was born}} in Old Meldrum, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, the third son of John Watt. He was educated at Grammar School, King's College and Marischal College, Aberdeen, and later {{attended}} both the University of Aberdeen and the University of Glasgow. He received the degrees of M.B. and C.M. in 1873. He enjoyed teaching and joined the University of Glasgow as a prodissector to the Professor of Anatomy. Around 1864, there was a famine in Orissa and the then Lieutenant-Governor of Bengal, Sir George Campbell was firm that agricultural education was key to avoiding similar disasters and following the recommendations of Sir John Strachey's Famine Commission, a need to carry out scientific study to improve the food supply in India was noted. In order <b>to</b> <b>fulfil</b> <b>this</b> <b>requirement,</b> and {{on the recommendation of}} J.D. Hooker, he was selected for the post Professor of Botany, at Presidency College, Calcutta University and joined there in 1873-74. He taught for ten years at a college in Hoogly {{and at the same time}} began to study the local botany and began to form a private herbarium. He followed a system of numbering specimens in the field with numbered tag labels detached from similarly numbered sheets in the field to avoid mistakes in labelling. In 1879 he travelled around northwest Punjab and he described several new plant species from the Chamba region. In 1881 he was posted as surgeon to the Burma-Manipur Delimitation Commission with special permission to conduct botanical studies during the expedition. On his return he was made in charge of the Calcutta International Exhibition for 1883-84. Watt organized a 1700-page catalogue for the economic section of the exhibition that was in charge of. Towards the end of the exhibition, the government suggested that the catalogue should be expanded. The expanded version was ready for the Colonial and Indian Exhibition of London in 1886. This was later to become the first volume of his work and he was made a CIE for his work. On his return to India, he was put in charge of the Indian Museum and appointed Reporter on Economic Products under the Department of Revenue and Agriculture. Isaac Henry Burkill worked as an assistant reporter. He organized another exhibition for the Delhi Exhibition of Indian Art on 2 January 1902 and published Indian Art at Delhi. Watt edited the Agricultural Ledger, a government bulletin that collated notes on agricultural products and practices sent by officers posted across India. As an economic botanist, he also published books on cotton and cacao.During the course of his career in India the positions he was appointed to included special duty in connection with Burma-Manipur Boundary Commission as Medical Officer, 1882; Scientific Assistant Secretary, Government of India, 1881; in charge of the India Section of the Calcutta International Exhibition, 1884; Commissioner, Colonial and Indian Exhibition, London, 1885-86; Reporter to Government of India on Economic Products, 1887-1903; Governor of Imperial Institute, 1892; Editor, The Agricultural Ledger, 1892-1903; President, Pharmacological Section of the Indian Medical Congress, 1894; in charge of Calcutta Industrial Museum, 1894-03; Honorary Secretary, Indigenous Drug Committee of India, 1901; Director, Indian Art Exhibition, Delhi, 1903.|$|E

40|$|Background: Nowadays Human Resource Management {{issues are}} highly {{related to the}} {{strategic}} approach (Analoui, 2007; Daft, 2008; Becker, Huselid & Beatty, 2009; Jackson, Schuler & Werner, 2009). Workforce is considered as an asset and HRM is required to match human capital with organization strategic purposes. HRM practices have accordingly evolved <b>to</b> better <b>fulfil</b> <b>this</b> <b>requirement</b> through for instance Competency Modelling (CM) (Werbel & De Marie, 2005). Diagnosis: This communication illustrates a specific CM validation process in a wide Public Administration. Through a “one-size-fits-all” competency model approach (Mansfield, 1996), the HRM department of this Public Administration has developed a set of 29 transverse competencies broken down across 290 behavioural indicators. After several in-house pre-validation steps (workshops and test cases), Human Resources Development Unit of University of Liege was invited to collaborate to the final validation process. Solution: Based on Van Beirendonck (2006) CM validation criteria, a two steps validation method was jointly developed. Four main criteria were used, therefore each behavioural indicator ought to : (1) meet various organizational departments needs; (2) be clearly understood within the organization (Bowen & Ostroff, 2004); (3) have a straight link with its belonging competency and (4) be observable. A questionnaire survey (n= 252) was drawn up to appraise the first three criteria and quantitative analysis results provided the CM improvement framework. The concluding validation stage assessed the three last criteria by measuring Subject Matter Experts (HR managers responsible for staff evaluation) interrater agreement {{in order to improve}} CM content validity (Sanchez & Levine, 2009). Finding: Results comfortably confirm CM content validation under the four criteria. One of the project’s more relevant elements is developing a scientifically based method adapted to wide administration organizational features and constraints. In contrast, this CM validation project presents some limitations in relation to the CM theoretical concept (ambiguous concept in its validation perspective) and to organizational constraints (lack of strategic project concerning the use of the CM). Method and outcomes will be discussed in connection with the customer’s requirements and the constraints from the organizational context. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Metastable β titanium alloys appear <b>to</b> <b>fulfil</b> these <b>requirements.</b> <b>This</b> study investigated the correlation of phases precipitated in a Ti- 12 Mo- 13 Nb alloy with changes in hardness and the Young's modulus. The alloy was produced by arc melting under an argon atmosphere, after which, it was heat treated and cold forged. Two different routes of heat treatment were employed. Phase transformations were studied by employing X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Property characterisation was based on Vickers microhardness tests and Young's modulus measurements. The highest ratio of microhardness to the Young's modulus was obtained using thermomechanical treatment, which consists of heating at 1000 C for 24 h, water quenching, cold forging to reduce 80 % of the area, and ageing at 500 C for 24 h, where the final microstructure consisted of an α phase dispersed in a β matrix. The α phase appeared in two different forms: as fine lamellas (with 240 ± 100 nm length) and massive particles of 200 - 500 nm size. © 2013 Elsevier B. V.
