The findings suggest that interactive effects exist between air pollutants and equivalent temperature. Bivariate response surface models and generalised additive models (GAMs) including interaction terms showed an increased risk of mortality during periods of elevated equivalent temperatures and air pollution.

Design This study adopted a qualitative approach when exploring chartered physiotherapists' personal experiences in using psychological intervention methods in their work with injured athletes. Semi-structured interview schedule was devised and the data obtained was analyzed by using the Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA; Smith (1996)). Methods Seven (4 female, 3 male) physiotherapists working in sports medicine in the United Kingdom participated in the interviews. Results Following the IPA analysis, the physiotherapists in this study were very open about their lack of formal training in sport psychology, and appeared to be knowledgeable and comfortable in using goal setting and encouraging social support. Familiarity with, and experiences of using other techniques (i. e., imagery, relaxation, and self-talk) seemed to be less apparent. The physiotherapists also stressed the importance of ‘gut-feeling’ and experiential knowledge. Conclusions The study provides a valuable insight into physiotherapists' real-life experiences in using psychological interventions.

40|$|Abstract. Precipitated Calcium Carbonate (PCC) is {{obtained}} through three processes; that of calcination, hydration, and carbonation. Thus, changes in each process condition determine the particle size or morphology of the mediums (calcium oxide and calcium hydroxide) {{as well as}} the product (PCC). To date, studies concerning precipitated calcium carbonate have mainly focused on the carbonation process, aimed at the manufacturing of PCC. <b>Thus</b> <b>far,</b> <b>few</b> <b>studies</b> on calcination or hydration have been conducted. Calcium hydroxide is regarded as the most important factor during the carbonation process. It {{is obtained}} through a hydration process. Therefore, in order to create the valuable PCC studies that center on the hydration process should be carried out. The present study seeks to investigate the effect of the hydration condition, particularly the temperature, on the synthesis characteristics of calcium hydroxide and aragonite PCC. The results show that the particle size of calcium hydroxide changes with variations in the initial hydration temperature. In particular, a higher initial temperature resulted in a larger particle size of the calcium hydroxide used in the synthesis. The particle size and yield of aragonite also increased when calcium hydroxide created at high temperatures was used. However, the water/solid ratio or total amount at the hydration time had no effect on the manufacturing process of aragonite...|$|E

To the best of our knowledge, no implementation combines both CPU and extra accelerators, such as GPUs, to accelerate the Zuker algorithm applications. Results In this paper, a CPU-GPU hybrid computing system that accelerates Zuker algorithm applications for RNA secondary structure prediction is proposed. The computing tasks are allocated between CPU and GPU for parallel cooperate execution. Performance differences between the CPU and the GPU in the task-allocation scheme are considered to obtain workload balance. To improve the hybrid system performance, the Zuker algorithm is optimally implemented with special methods for CPU and GPU architecture. Conclusions Speedup of 15. 93 × over optimized multi-core SIMD CPU implementation and performance advantage of 16 % over optimized GPU implementation are shown in the experimental results. More than 14 % of the sequences are executed on CPU in the hybrid system.

Several studies have attempted to use biomarkers of biologically effective dose (BBED) such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon-DNA and alfatoxinalbumin adducts to assess possible GxE interactions. To truly determine whether BBED results from a GxE interaction that is causally implicated in disease development would require data on G, E, BBED, and D, and <b>thus</b> <b>far,</b> <b>few</b> <b>studies</b> have had data on each of these components.

We show that neither approach is valid. Analyses of interactions between G and BBED cannot be used to draw conclusions about {{the presence or absence of}} GxE interactions. Similarly, analyses of BBED and D, controlling for E, do not provide insight into the role of G. We discuss how differences in the risk estimate for BBED, with and without control for E may be interpreted...|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} and/or {{spread of}} exotic organisms into new habitats {{is considered a}} major threat to biodiversity. Invasive plants have been shown to negatively affect native communities, competing with and excluding other plants and disrupting a wide range of trophic interactions associated with them. In spite of this, <b>thus</b> <b>far,</b> <b>few</b> <b>studies</b> have explicitly studied the mechanisms underlying the displacement and potential local extinction of native herbivores and their natural enemies up to the third trophic level and even higher. Here, we formulate hypotheses on how structural and chemical characteristics of invasive plants may affect the plant-finding abilities of herbivores and the host- or prey-finding behavior of predators and parasitoids. The sudden incursion of an invasive plant into a native plant community may fragment native habitats and thus create structural barriers that impede dispersal and plant-finding ability for herbivores and prey- or host-finding ability for predators and parasitoids. At the same time, invasive plants may produce odors that are attractive to native insects and thus interfere with interactions on native plants. If invasive plants are both attractive and toxic to native insects, they may constitute ‘traps’ that are possibly beneficial against insect pests in agro-ecosystems, but have conservation implications for native herbivores and their natural enemies. However, we also suggest that some herbivores, and by association their parasitoids, may benefit from the establishment and spread of exotic plants because they increase the amount of available resources for them to exploit. ...|$|E

The pulmonary MoPn infection appeared to be disseminated systemically, because chlamydial antigens were readily detectable in multiple organs including the cardiovascular tissues. In addition, gamma interferon gene knockout mice with a C 57 BL/ 6 genetic background showed significant endocarditis and pancarditis characterized by vegetation in aortic valves, interstitial and pericardial inflammatory cellular infiltration, and growth of the organisms in the heart following respiratory tract MoPn infection.

These studies however, suffer from several disadvantages such as skin damage due to separation, and disruption of the complex multi-layered composition. In addition, most studies are limited to linear shear measurements, i. e. measurements with small linear deformations (also called small amplitude oscillatory shear experiments), whereas in daily life skin can experience high strains, due to for example shaving or walking. To get around these disadvantages and to measure the non-linear mechanical (shear) behavior, we used through-plane human skin to measure large amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) deformation up to a strain amplitude of 0. 1. LAOS deformation was combined with real-time image recording and subsequent digital image correlation and strain field analysis to determine skin layer deformations. Results demonstrated that deformation at large strains became highly non-linear by showing intra-cycle strain stiffening and inter-cycle shear thinning. Digital image correlation revealed that dynamic shear moduli gradually decreased from 8 kPa at the superficial epidermal layer down to a stiffness of 2 kPa in the dermis. From the results we can conclude that, from a mechanical point of view, skin {{should be considered as}} a complex composite with gradually varying shear properties rather than a three layered tissue...|$|R

A series of planned matings were performed, within which experimental females were mated sequentially to two different males under controlled conditions. Observations conducted during experimental matings revealed that courtship displays did not significantly differ between the first and second males to mate with a female. Interactions ending with a mount were characterized by a significantly higher intensity and occurrence of determinate courtship behaviours, for example biting and running after the female. Paternity analysis performed on hatchlings produced from experimental females revealed that 46 % of the clutches were multi-sired. A significant contribution of previous years' partners was still found, thus confirming the long-term sperm storage within the female oviduct in this species.

Khayelitsha is one of the sites with frequent protests in Cape Town and is inhabited by poor people, 70 percent of whom live in informal settlements. While the lack of municipal services is undoubtedly a major problem for many poor people in South Africa, <b>thus</b> <b>far,</b> <b>few</b> <b>studies</b> have been dedicated to investigate empirically this alleged link between service delivery and protest activity. The study utilizes mostly quantitative analysis techniques such as regression analysis and path analysis to discover the form and strength of linkages between the service delivery and participation forms. While residents of informal settlements and therefore poorer services were more prone to engage in protests and thus reinforcing the service delivery hypothesis, this relationship was relatively weak in regression analysis. What {{is more important than the}} service delivery variables such as water services was the level of cognitive awareness exemplified by the level of political engagement and awareness on the one hand and level of community engagement in terms of attendance of community meetings and membership of different organizations.

This study examines development and reproduction in Lysibia nana Gravenhorst and Acrolyta nens Hartig (both Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae), two related and morphologically similar secondary parasitoids that attack pupae of the gregarious endoparasitoid, Cotesia glomerata L. (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). On black mustard, Brassica nigra L. (Brassicaceae) plants {{in a field}} plot, adults of L. nana and A. nens frequently emerged from the same cocoon broods of C. glomerata. Based on similarities in their phylogeny and morphology, {{it was hypothesized that}} both species would exhibit considerable overlap in other life-history traits. In both L. nana and A. nens, adult wasp size increased with host cocoon mass at parasitism, although L. nana wasps were slightly larger than A. nens wasps, and completed their development earlier. Adult females of both species emerged with no eggs but matured eggs at similar rates over the following days. When provided with 20 host cocoons daily, fecundity in female L. nana was slightly more skewed towards early life than in A. nens, although lifetime fecundity did not differ between the two species. Longevity was significantly reduced in females of both species that were provided with hosts. Both parasitoids were found to exhibit strong similarities in life-history and development traits and in their ecological niche, thereby supporting our general hypothesis. Competition between L. nana and A. nens is presumably diffused because their preferred host (C. glomerata) is relatively abundant in open habitats. ...|$|E

Herbivore performance was differentially affected by the plant population on which they were reared. Plant population influenced only development time and pupal mass in P. rapae, whereas plant population also had a dramatic effect on survival of M. brassicae. Prolonged development time in P. rapae corresponded with high levels of the indole GS, neoglucobrassicin, whereas reduced survival in M. brassicae coincided with high levels of the aliphatic GS, gluconapin and sinigrin. The difference between the two species {{can be explained by the}} fact that the specialist P. rapae is adapted to feed on plants containing GS and has evolved an effective detoxification system against aliphatic GS. The different B. oleracea populations also affected development of the endoparasitoids.

Fifteen cases of AOT were studied considering their clinical, radiographic and histopathologic aspects. Twelve cases affected females and the mean age was 16. 2 years. The anterior maxilla was the most common site (66. 6 %) and radiographically most cases showed a unilocular radiolucency with well-defined borders (57. 1 %). Histologically, most cases exhibited predominantly a solid growth pattern (46. 7 %) or a similar proportion of solid and cribriform patterns (46. 7 %). Eosinophilic amorphous material ("tumor droplets") was found in all cases (100 %). Most tumors showed duct-like spaces (93. 3 %) and convoluted structures (60. 0 %) whereas a minor proportion of cases presented calcifying epithelial odontogenic tumor (CEOT) -like areas (26. 7 %).

In this paper we therefore look beyond economic explanations of access to health insurance to explore additional wider determinants of enrolment in the NHIS. In particular, we investigate whether social exclusion, as measured through a sociocultural, political and economic lens, can explain poor enrolment rates of children. Data were collected from a cross-sectional survey of 4050 representative households conducted in Ghana in 2012. Household indices were created to measure sociocultural, political and economic exclusion, and logistic regressions were conducted to study determinants of enrolment at the individual and household levels. Our results indicate that socioculturally, economically and politically excluded children are less likely to enrol in the NHIS. Furthermore, households excluded in all dimensions {{were more likely to be}} non-enrolled or partially-enrolled (i. e. not all children enrolled within the household) than fully-enrolled. These results suggest that equity in access for socially excluded children has not yet been achieved. Efforts should be taken to improve coverage by removing the remaining small, annually renewable registration fee, implementing and publicising the new clause that de-links premium waivers from parental membership, establishing additional scheme administrative offices in remote areas, holding regular registration sessions in schools and conducting outreach sessions and providing registration support to female guardians of children. Ensuring equitable access to NHIS will contribute substantially to improving child health and reducing child mortality in Ghana...|$|E
40|$|The {{relationship}} between {{population and the}} environment holds {{an important role in}} research on the linkages between human society and ecological systems. Recent studies on population and the environment have turned research focus toward the more dynamic factor of population processes ??? migration. The mediating factor approach to population and environment provides a basic theoretical model for understanding the complex {{relationship between}} migration and the environment. <b>Thus</b> <b>far,</b> <b>few</b> <b>studies</b> have been conducted on the environmental impacts of migration particularly circular labor migration in the rural communities from which migrants originate. The increasing rural-to-urban labor migration in China since the early 1980 ???s has formed the largest population flow in world history. The primary objective of this doctoral dissertation research project is to obtain {{a better understanding of how}} this large-scale circular labor migration movement impacts the rural environment through sociocultural and economic mediating factors. Major intervening variables identified in recent literature on environmental effects of migration revolve around rural livelihoods and community development. A comprehensive conceptual framework was developed in this study that incorporated the rural livelihoods approach and the interactional theory of community development into analyzing environmental consequences of rural migration. The core assumption was that household livelihoods and community interactional capacity were critical intervening variables between rural out-migration and its subsequent environmental outcomes in rural origin areas. The analysis drew on empirical data collected from four rural villages in Chongqing Municipality, where the rural-to-urban labor migration rate is currently the highest in China. This study used a mixed-methods approach in data collection and analysis. Secondary socioeconomic and biophysical data provided contextual information for the study area and guided the selection of study communities. In-depth key informant interviews gathered detailed information about rural livelihoods and community interaction experiences in study communities for the development of survey instrument, and provided a contextualized backdrop for the analysis of survey data. The household survey was conducted using a face-to-face questionnaire interview technique to collect data on household livelihood activities and community participation for statistical analysis. Results confirm the research hypothesis that labor-migrant and non-labor-migrant households are significantly different in livelihood activities including agricultural practices, income and consumption, and resource use and management. Labor-migrant households differed particularly from those non-labor-migrant households whose members were all mainly engaged in agricultural production, while sharing many similar livelihood characteristics with those which had member(s) holding regular local off-farm work. In addition, this research found that the relationship between rural labor out-migration and community interaction varied across study communities. Findings suggest rural migration presents both detrimental and beneficial potentialities for community development in rural origin areas. Labor migration constrains the participation level of migrants and migrant households for community activities, at the same time that it creates possibilities for constructing a rural community field extending beyond local boundaries. Altogether, these findings have implications for the subsequent environmental outcomes of rural labor out-migration and corresponding natural resource management and policy in rural origin areas...|$|E
40|$|Whilst the {{interest}} in open innovation is growing, <b>thus</b> <b>far</b> <b>few</b> <b>studies</b> have emphasised its importance beyond hi-tech industries and large multinationals. This research aims to generate an understanding of open innovation adoption within the UK Bio-pharmaceutical industry, which is chosen because of the significant growth it has experienced in recent times, and is heavy reliance on R&D. The findings of this multi-level study present a holistic view of the opportunities and barriers pertaining to open innovation in Biopharmaceutical SMEs and large firms, as well as indicating that open innovation strategies assist firms’ {{in terms of value}} creation and capture. The study also illustrates that strategies cannot necessarily be regarded as explicitly open or closed innovation, as there is a significant spectrum of approaches in the space between. The study’s theoretical contribution develops the use of critical realism, a scientific reality which is not only about constant combinations of observable events but is also about individuals, entities and structures that exist and generate the events we witness and observe. In doing so, the study utilises an alternative to inductive or deductive reasoning, the retroductive reasoning. Through retroduction, the study to explain these causal powers, mechanisms, as well as the contingent relations of individuals that are responsible {{for the creation of a}} firm’s strategic considerations based on a multi-layered approach (micro-with individuals/meso-with various organisations/macro-with various government bodies and organisations). The study comprises three sets of results, focusing on CEOs, knowledge brokers and senior executives respectively. The first set of results, based on 30 interviews of CEOs in Small-to-Medium sized Enterprises (SMEs), suggests that i open innovation practices are utilised in a multi-level, but that not all SMEs adopt the open concept. This shows the reluctance of CEOs in SMEs in sharing internal information and intellectual property. The second set, obtained from interviews with 8 Knowledge Brokers in the industry, emphasised the need for an agenda when open practices are utilised and there are personal preconceptions regarding business, which are in many cases difficult to change or adjust during open approaches. The third set, obtained from a survey questionnaire with 12 executives of 10 large biopharmaceutical firms, illustrates the importance their firms place on open innovation practices, particularly in collaborating with various firms and organisations. In spite of the industry’s recent efforts, the study identifies that benefits from the adoption of open innovation are yet to be seen, as the realisation of research and development outcomes within the Biopharmaceutical sector is a long process. Furthermore, the study clarifies that open innovation is not a monopoly of large firms in the high-tech sector, but can be adopted in various other firms in different industries. Additionally, this study contributes to the expansion of multi-layered approaches, as they give a thorough view of the processes that are involved during open innovation adoption. Finally, the research addresses the lack of empirical work in open innovation and suggests methods that identify how and why particular processes are utilised when open strategies are adopted, and elucidates the space between closed and open innovation...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{volatile}} anesthetics, a {{group of}} general anesthetics, is an exceedingly common practice. These anesthetics may have neuroprotective effects. Over the last decade, anesthetic induced neurotoxicity in pediatric populations has gained a certain notoriety based on pre-clinical cell and animal studies demonstrating that general anesthetics may induce neurotoxicity, including neuroapoptosis, neurodegeneration, and long-term neurocognitive and behavioral deficits. With {{hundreds of millions of}} people having surgery under general anesthesia worldwide, and roughly six million children annually in the U. S. alone, the importance of clearly defining toxic or protective effects of general anesthetics cannot be overstated. Yet, with our expanding body of knowledge, we have come to learn that perhaps not all volatile anesthetics have the same pharmacological profiles; certain ones may have a more favorable neurotoxic profile and may actually exhibit neuroprotection in specific populations and situations. <b>Thus</b> <b>far,</b> very <b>few</b> clinical <b>studies</b> exist, and have not yet been convincing enough to alter our practice. This review will provide an update on current data regarding volatile anesthetic induced neurotoxicity and neuroprotection in neonatal and infant populations. In addition, this paper will discuss ongoing studies and the trajectory of further research over the coming years...|$|R
40|$|Background: Resident macrophages in the CNS {{microglia}} become activated {{and produce}} proinflammatory molecules upon encountering bacteria or viruses. TLRs are a phylogenetically conserved diverse family of sensors that drive innate immune responses following interactions with PAMPs. TLR 3 and TLR 4 recognize viral dsRNA Poly (I:C) and bacterial endotoxin LPS, respectively. Importantly, these receptors {{differ in their}} downstream adaptor molecules. <b>Thus</b> <b>far,</b> only a <b>few</b> <b>studies</b> have investigated the effects of TLR 3 and TLR 4 in macrophages. However, a genome-wide search {{for the effects of}} these TLRs has not been performed in microglia using RNA-seq. Gene expression patterns were determined for the BV- 2 microglial cell line when stimulated with viral dsRNA Poly (I:C) or bacterial endotoxin LPS to identify novel transcribed genes, as well as investigate how differences in downstream signaling could influence gene expression in innate immunity. Results: Sequencing assessment and quality evaluation revealed that common and unique patterns of proinflammatory genes were significantly up-regulated in response to TLR 3 and TLR 4 stimulation. However, the IFN/viral response gene showed a stronger response to TLR 3 stimulation than to TLR 4 stimulation. Unexpectedly, TLR 3 and TLR 4 stimulation did not activate IFN-ß and IRF 3 in BV- 2 microglia. Most importantly, we observed that previously unidentified transcription factors (TFs) (i. e., IRF 1, IRF 7, and IRF 9) and the epigenetic regulators KDM 4 A and DNMT 3 L were significantly up-regulate...|$|R
40|$|In 2005, {{the state}} of Colorado {{mandated}} the creation of water roundtables in HB 05 - 1177. The purpose of the water roundtables {{was to provide a}} public forum for collaboration, discussion, and local decision-making in river basins. Understanding the practice of public deliberation that combines the external trappings of democracy with the substance of legal rule is a puzzle facing communication scholars. <b>Thus</b> <b>far,</b> there are <b>few</b> <b>studies</b> at the intersection of communication, environmental governance, and water. Past research has focused on the importance of public involvement and deliberation, while neglecting variations in the underlying practices of meetings. This dissertation moves beyond a focus on publics to explore processes of institutional change and renewal within a particular type of hybrid meeting: those with competing discourses of public good and private rights. The study inductively reconstructs the communicative practice of roundtables and provides analytical insights that inform communicative practices of deliberation about a critical, non-substitutable resource. First, it suggests that not all public meetings are created equal. Scholars wishing to understand the discourse of public deliberation must look beyond a public/private dichotomy to include distinctions in both the aim and criteria for deliberation. Secondly, the project offers a cautionary tale for policymakers and researchers who view public involvement as a source of democratic change. This case study develops our knowledge of the relationship between discourse and institutional forms of public deliberation and suggests that relational ways of decision-making offer strengths that have been previously overlooked...|$|R
