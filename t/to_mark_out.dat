5|$|The {{position}} of the flame robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine family tree is unclear; the Petroicidae are not closely related to either the European or American robins but {{appear to be an}} early offshoot of the Passerida group of songbirds. The flame robin is predominantly insectivorous, pouncing on prey from a perch in a tree, or foraging on the ground. A territorial bird, the flame robin employs song and plumage displays <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> <b>out</b> and defend its territory. Classified by BirdLife International as Near Threatened, the species has suffered a marked decline in the past 25 years.|$|E
5|$|Young female tigers {{establish}} their first territories {{close to their}} mother's. The overlap between the female and her mother's territory reduces with time. Males, however, migrate further than their female counterparts and set out {{at a younger age}} <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> <b>out</b> their own area. A young male acquires territory either by seeking out an area devoid of other male tigers, or by living as a transient in another male's territory until he is older and strong enough to challenge the resident male. Young males seeking to establish themselves thereby comprise the highest mortality rate (30–35% per year) amongst adult tigers.|$|E
5|$|Parliamentary {{enclosures}} {{accounted for}} about 4.5 million acres {{of what had been}} open fields, not counting the enclosure of common land and wild 'waste'. In 1700 roughly half England's arable land was already enclosed; {{by the end of the}} enclosure process, almost all of it was. The revolution in the landscape began in about 1750, affecting about 3,000 parishes, especially in the English midlands. Between 1760 and 1800 there were 1,479 enclosure acts, covering 2.5 million acres; another 1.5 million acres were enclosed by 1844, by more than a thousand further acts. Some counties such as Kent, Essex and Devon were little affected, having largely been enclosed much earlier, often directly from forest or moorland. Many miles of new straight hedgerows were laid <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> <b>out</b> the newly enclosed fields of the midlands; in some areas such as Derbyshire, straight limestone walls were used instead. Many straight new roads were created at the same time. Farmhouses remained in the old villages at first, but new red-brick Victorian ones were often built in the middle of their now enclosed land in due course.|$|E

5|$|The coup-de-main {{force had}} been {{followed}} closely by the pathfinders of the 22nd Independent Parachute Company, tasked with marking out the drop-zones and landing-zones {{to be used by}} the rest of the division. However, due to a combination of heavy cloud cover and poor navigation, only one pathfinder team was dropped correctly. The aircraft carrying the remainder had to make between two and three runs over their respective drop-zones before their teams jumped. Pathfinders assigned to DZ N were dropped wide, and did not manage to get to the drop-zone for thirty minutes. The team assigned to DZ K accidentally dropped onto DZ N without realising their error, and set up radio beacons and markers that caused a number of airborne troops to drop in the wrong area. A pathfinder team belonging to 9th Parachute Battalion, assigned <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> <b>out</b> the drop-zone area for the unit tasked with destroying the Merville artillery battery, was all but wiped out when an air-raid by RAF Avro Lancaster heavy bombers missed the artillery battery itself and bombed the area the team was in.|$|E

25|$|Pale yellow bricks {{have been}} made locally since about 1780, and are {{commonly}} encountered as a building material. Flint is the other predominant structural material: its local abundance has ensured its frequent use. The combination of flint and red brick is characteristic of Worthing.

But she wished that, instead of reproaches, however tender, he would give her help; he was certainly wise enough, and clever enough, to invent some issue from their troubles. She expressed this belief, and Morris received the assurance as if he thought it natural; but he interrogated, at first--as was natural too--rather than committed himself <b>to</b> <b>marking</b> <b>out</b> a course.|$|R
25|$|Marking out (also {{known as}} layout) {{is the process}} of {{transferring}} a design or pattern to a workpiece and {{is the first step in}} the handcraft of metalworking. It is performed in many industries or hobbies, although in industry, the repetition eliminates the need <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> <b>out</b> every individual piece. In the metal trades area, marking out consists of transferring the engineer's plan to the workpiece in preparation for the next step, machining or manufacture.|$|E
25|$|In August 1777, the British were {{planning}} to land an army {{at the head of}} the River Elk with the object of securing Philadelphia.

The first {{recorded}} match took place on September 30, 1882 against a local team named the Radicals, which Hotspur lost 2–0. The first Spurs game reported by the local press took place on Tottenham Marshes on 6 October 1883 against Brownlow Rovers, which Spurs won 9–0. It was at this ground that in 1887 Spurs first played the team that would later become their arch rivals Arsenal (then known as Royal Arsenal), leading 2–1 until the match got called off due to poor light after the away team arrived late.|$|E

25|$|Capitalism is decried in Petals of Blood, {{with the}} new Kenyan elite portrayed as {{controlled}} by the 'faceless system of capitalism'. The everyman loses out to capitalist endeavours, and is essentially exploited by the new Kenyan elite. Farmers are forced <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> <b>out</b> their lands and mortgage them with loans linked {{to the success of}} their harvest; as the quality of the harvests waver, many are forced to sell their land, unable to match their loan repayments. Thang'eta is another symbol of capitalism. Taken from a drink that Nyakinyua brews in a traditional ceremony, it is soon marketed, and becomes extremely popular. Wanja, who introduces the drink to Abdulla's bar, is then exploited by big business who forces her to stop her Thang'eta operation. Neither she nor Munira, who creates the slogan, receive the fruits of their labour. Originally a drink used to help people relax and escape their current problems, it becomes 'a drink of strife'.|$|E
500|$|Fortune {{was born}} Violet Mary Firth on 6 December 1890 at her family home on Bryn-y-Bia Road in Llandudno, North Wales. Her {{background}} was upper middle-class; the Firths were a wealthy English family who had gained their money through {{the steel industry}} in Sheffield, Yorkshire, where they had specialised {{in the production of}} guns. Fortune's paternal grandfather John Firth had devised a family motto, [...] "Deo, non Fortuna" [...] ("God, not Luck"), <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> <b>out</b> their nouveau riche status; she would later make use of it in creating her pseudonym.|$|E
500|$|Many {{classical}} {{themes were}} used in this way. Thiepval Memorial, for example uses the classical themes of a victory arch and an abstract pattern of diminishing arches to produce what historian Jay Winter has termed [...] "an embodiment of nothing". The various Cenotaphs adopt the principle of entasis — Greek method with apparently straight lines, that are in fact slightly curved. Many memorials and war cemeteries used precinct walls <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> <b>out</b> the memorial as special and sacred, originally a Roman feature made popular again in the 19th century. Some features were more literally interpreted: the Victoria State Memorial in Australia, for example, was closely based on a Persian step pyramid.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{friction}} between the Western Allies and Soviets was steadily rising. The Soviets even took <b>to</b> <b>marking</b> <b>out</b> their border by stationing armed soldiers along it at intervals of a few metres, day and night, in all weathers. Since there was not, as yet, a fixed marker, the borders were prone to abuse, which eventually resulted (in August 1948), in white lines in luminous paint appearing across roads and even through ruined buildings to try to deter the Soviets from making unauthorised incursions into the American and British zones. These measures were only partially successful: after further skirmishes in which shots were fired, barbed wire entanglements were stretched across some roads, a foretaste of things to come.|$|R

500|$|David Soslan's {{status of}} a king consort, {{as well as his}} {{presence}} in art, on charters, and on coins, was dictated by the necessity of male aspects of kingship, but he remained a subordinate ruler who shared the throne with and derived his power from Tamar. Tamar continued to be styled as mep’et’a mep’e– [...] "king of kings". In Georgian, a language with no grammatical genders, mep'e ("king") does not necessarily imply a masculine connotation and can be rendered as a [...] "sovereign". The female equivalent of mep'e is dedop'ali ("queen"), which was applied to queens consort or the king's closest, senior female relatives. Tamar is occasionally called dedop'ali in the Georgian chronicles and on some charters. Thus, the title of mep'e might have been applied to Tamar <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> <b>out</b> her unique position among women.|$|E
500|$|The Allied cavalry {{began to}} appear at about 08:00, [...] or [...] away on d'Arco's left front to the north-west, {{followed}} by the infantry. By 10:00 Marlborough's Quartermaster-General, William Cadogan, began <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> <b>out</b> land for an encampment {{within sight of the}} Schellenberg– short of the Wörnitz– to give the impression they were intending a leisurely siege. Count d'Arco watched Cadogan's preparations and, falling for the deception, left the supervision of the still incomplete defences to lunch with the French commander of Donauwörth, Colonel DuBordet, safe in the belief that he had {{the rest of the day}} and night to finish the defences. However, the columns marched purposefully onwards, and by mid-afternoon they had crossed the river Wörnitz at Ebermorgen, intent on launching an immediate assault. The Allies were spotted by the Bavarian outposts who, after setting fire to Berg and surrounding hamlets, rushed off to sound the alarm. General d'Arco, rudely interrupted from his lunch, rushed up the Schellenberg and called his men to arms.|$|E

He argues {{that there are}} infinitely many numbers, as you can always add one (or any other number) to whatever number {{you think is the}} limit. He attributes geometry to Ancient Egypt, arguing that because the River Nile flooded and covered the land with mud, geometry was needed <b>to</b> <b>mark</b> <b>out</b> people's land [...] "with lines and measures". Isidore distinguishes astronomy from astrology, and covers the world, the sky and the celestial sphere, the zodiac, the sun, moon, stars, Milky Way, planets and the names of the stars. He derives the curved (curvus) vault of the heavens from the Latin word for [...] "upside-down" [...] (conversus). He explains eclipses of the sun as the moon coming between the earth and the sun, and eclipses of the moon as happening when it runs into the shadow of the earth. He condemns the Roman naming of the planets after their gods: Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, Venus, and Mercury.|$|E
