40|$|During {{the recent}} years, the {{telecommunication}} infrastructure {{has been moving}} slowly from analog techniques towards IP (Internet Protocol) and other digital formats. Along with this change, a new concern, packet loss, has arisen among the earlier problems during <b>text</b> <b>telephone</b> communication. During voice transmission {{this is not a}} problem, but in text transmission it leads to bit errors and corrupted characters. One solution to this problem is to change the analog <b>text</b> <b>telephone</b> tones to text, and send it with VoIP (Voice over IP). The characters sent in this fashion can be changed back to the same <b>text</b> <b>telephone</b> tones as transmitted or into some other <b>text</b> <b>telephone</b> standard, if needed. This decoding/encoding of analog- to digital signals is done in a gateway. The purpose of this project is to investigate if it is possible to implement a V. 18 modem in Java. This project is divided in two parts: detection of the incoming <b>text</b> <b>telephone</b> signals standard, and decoding of the incoming signals. The part considered in this master thesis is the signal detection part. From the test results for the V. 18 modem, we make the conclusion {{that it is possible to}} implement a V. 18 modem in Java. The different V. 18 sub standards, implemented in the modem, can be detected, and the project has resulted in an implementation of a V. 18 modem in Java. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|<b>Text</b> <b>telephone</b> {{devices are}} text-based {{terminals}} {{that allow the}} users to communicate by text via fixed-line telephone networks. Since cellular phone systems are sometime subject to severe radio channel impairments and the modem signals of these text telephones are therefore not always transmitted reliably, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has required a solution to guarantee a reliable transmission of <b>text</b> <b>telephone</b> data for emergency calls via cellular phone systems. For the North American PCS- 1900 cellular phone systems recently the Standards Committee T 1 has standardized a solution for this requirement, {{which is based on}} a new modem protocol, the Cellular <b>Text</b> <b>Telephone</b> Modem (CTM), whose signals can be reliably transmitted via the speech channel of cellular phone systems. After a short introduction into text telephony, this contribution provides a description of this solution for PCS- 1900 systems using CTM signals.

40|$|In todays {{multimedia}} society {{more and}} more communication is becoming digitized. However under a temporary period, digital and analog techniques must coexist. So that every one can communicate with everyone else. For the deaf community, among other things, this means connecting analog text telephones to new internetbased technology. To enable this coexistance the Telecommunication Access Rehabilitation Engineering Research Center of the University of Wisconsin, Trace Center joint with Gallaudet University, and Omnitor AB have presented a idea of how this can be achieved. This report describes a project, which shows how a gateway can be designed and implemented. A gateway that has the features of enabling communication between analog text telephones and internet based clients. Enabling the users to communicate with both voice and text regardless if the users are using analog or digital media. The implementations in this project are done in Java. So the resulting gateway is as operating system independent as it can be. The result of this work was a gateway that can separate vice and analog <b>text</b> <b>telephone</b> signals in a in coming sound stream. The separation is good enough {{so as not to}} influence a conversation through the gateway. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the how {{the computer and}} information technology is used to help individuals with disabilities.

Assistive technology is technology used by individuals with disabilities in order to perform functions that might otherwise be difficult or impossible. Assistive technology can include mobility devices such as walkers and wheelchairs, as well as hardware, software, and peripherals that assist people with disabilities in accessing computers or other information technologies. For example, people with limited hand function may use a keyboard with large keys or a special mouse to operate a computer, people who are blind may use software that reads text on the screen in a computer-generated voice, people with low vision may use software that enlarges screen content, people who are deaf may use a TTY (<b>text</b> <b>telephone),</b> or people with speech impairments may use a device that speaks out loud as they enter text via a keyboard...|$|E
40|$|This thesis deals {{primarily}} {{with the production}} of written texts by adults with reading and writing difficulties. Their writing is analysed from three different aspects: error analysis, non-error-oriented text analysis {{and analysis of the}} production process. These studies are based on data from on-line recordings of writing. The main question is how the written language production of adults with reading and writing difficulties is influenced by their writing difficulties. A group of adults with reading and writing difficulties (R&W subjects) who have normal hearing is compared with a deaf group and a hearing control group. All subjects performed five different writing tasks on preset topics. The two hearing groups also performed three of these tasks in spoken language. The results show that not only do the texts of the R&W subjects include a large proportion of misspellings, these subjects appear to devote a lot of effort to spelling. Their pause frequency, and specifically their frequency of word-internal pauses, is higher than that of the other two groups. Furthermore, a great many of their editings are devoted to spelling. Clearly, their word level focus affects the production process as well as the final product. In addition to making many errors, these subjects' texts show no difference between speaking and writing as regards lexical density and diversity. They "write as they speak". The deaf subjects make fewer spelling errors than the R&W subjects, but more than the controls. They make many grammar errors, but {{do not appear to be}} very concerned about their errors; they are faster writers and make fewer pauses than R&W subjects. They appear to write as if they were under "on-line conditions", which could perhaps by explained by a frequent use of the <b>text</b> <b>telephone.</b> Another explanation could be that they are less normative concerning written Swedish than the subjects with reading and writing difficulties. The control subjects leave very few errors in their finally edited texts. They make a lot of "typos" while they are writing, but most of these are detected and corrected instantaneously. These subjects are quite fast and make fewer pauses than the group with reading and writing difficulties They differ from both the other groups in that they make long pauses in the initial phase of the writing session and edit more content. Moreover, they have higher lexical density and diversity in written language than in spoken language, i. e. they appear to be aware of the differences between the two modalities To conclude, it is suggested that the main difference between the controls and the two other groups is that the latter are not aware of the differences in production conditions between speaking, signing and <b>text</b> <b>telephone</b> usage under on-line conditions on the one hand and off-line writing on the other, i. e. they lack a "written language awareness" that appears to be an important prerequisite of writing. Another important finding is that being a poor speller, does not necessarily influence the production process, but "worries about being a poor speller" influence all aspects of the writing process...|$|E
50|$|Prostitutes are {{routinely}} victims of crime {{as a result}} of the social and legal status of their profession. More than 150 sex workers were murdered in Britain between 1990 and 2015, according to figures given by the National Police Chiefs' Council. Of the last 11 to die, nine were migrants. University of Leeds research in 2015 found that 47% of prostitutes had been victims of crime, including rape and robbery, while 36% had received threatening <b>texts,</b> <b>telephone</b> calls or emails. There have been a number of websites which have allowed prostitutes to publish warnings regarding potentially dangerous clients.

40|$|Background: Smoking {{is harmful}} to health. On average, lifelong smokers lose 10 years of life, {{and about half}} of all lifelong smokers have their lives {{shortened}} by smoking. Stopping smoking reverses or prevents many of these harms. However, cessation services in the NHS achieve variable success rates with smokers who want to quit. Approaches to behaviour change can be supplemented with electronic aids, and this may significantly increase quit rates and prevent a proportion of cases that relapse. Objective: The primary research question we sought to answer was: What is the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of internet, PC and other electronic aids to help people stop smoking? We addressed the following three questions: (1) What is the effectiveness of internet sites, computer programs, mobile <b>telephone</b> <b>text</b> messages and other electronic aids for smoking cessation and/or reducing relapse? (2) What is the costeffectiveness of incorporating internet sites, computer programs, mobile <b>telephone</b> <b>text</b> messages and other electronic aids into current NHS smoking cessation programmes? and (3) What are the current gaps in research into the effectiveness of internet sites, computer programs, mobile <b>telephone</b> <b>text</b> messages and other electronic aids to help people stop smoking...|$|R
