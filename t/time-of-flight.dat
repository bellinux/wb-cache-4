5|$|A more area-selective {{method is}} {{electron}} energy loss spectroscopy, which measures the energy loss of an electron beam within a {{transmission electron microscope}} when it interacts with {{a portion of a}} sample. The atom-probe tomograph has sub-nanometer resolution in 3-D and can chemically identify individual atoms using <b>time-of-flight</b> mass spectrometry.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, again {{using his}} {{knowledge}} of the cyclotron and inventing what are now known as <b>time-of-flight</b> techniques, Alvarez created a mono-energetic beam of thermal neutrons. With this he began a long series of experiments, collaborating with Felix Bloch, to measure the magnetic moment of the neutron. Their result of , published in 1940, was a major advance over earlier work.|$|E
5|$|After {{two years}} at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bradbury became an {{assistant}} professor of physics at Stanford University in 1935, rising to become an associate professor in 1938, and a full professor in 1943. He became an expert on the electrical conductivity of gases, the properties of ions, and the behavior of atmospheric electricity, publishing in journals including the Physical Review, Journal of Applied Physics, Journal of Chemical Physics, and the Journal of Atmospheric Electricity and Terrestrial Magnetism. He invented the Bradbury-Nielsen shutter, a type of electrical ion gate, widely used in mass spectrometry in both <b>time-of-flight</b> mass spectrometers and ion mobility spectrometers.|$|E
25|$|An atom probe is an {{instrument}} that combines <b>time-of-flight</b> mass spectrometry and field-evaporation microscopy to map the location of individual atoms.|$|E
25|$|Kinect 2.0 was {{released}} with Xbox One on November 22, 2013. The hardware included a <b>time-of-flight</b> sensor developed by Microsoft, replacing the older technology from PrimeSense.|$|E
25|$|For simple procedures, such as {{computing}} the delta-v for coplanar transfer ellipses, traditional {{approaches are}} fairly effective. Others, such as <b>time-of-flight</b> {{are far more}} complicated, especially for near-circular and hyperbolic orbits.|$|E
25|$|The {{intermediate}} region where a splitting {{of the high}} energetic ions from the less energetic species can be observed. The <b>time-of-flight</b> (TOF) data can be fitted to a shock wave model; however, other models could also be possible.|$|E
25|$|Depth-aware cameras. Using {{specialized}} cameras such as {{structured light}} or <b>time-of-flight</b> cameras, one can generate a depth map {{of what is}} being seen through the camera at a short range, and use this data to approximate a 3d representation {{of what is being}} seen. These can be effective for detection of hand gestures due to their short range capabilities.|$|E
25|$|The <b>time-of-flight</b> (TOF) {{analyzer}} uses {{an electric}} field {{to accelerate the}} ions through the same potential, and then measures the time they take to reach the detector. If the particles {{all have the same}} charge, the kinetic energies will be identical, and their velocities will depend only on their masses. Ions with a lower mass will reach the detector first.|$|E
25|$|Such {{experiments}} include that of Sadeh (1963) {{who used}} a <b>time-of-flight</b> technique to measure velocity differences of photons traveling in opposite direction, which were produced by positron annihilation. Another experiment was conducted by Alväger et al. (1963), who compared the time of flight of gamma rays from moving and resting sources. Both experiments found no difference, in accordance with relativity.|$|E
25|$|When a {{specific}} combination of source, analyzer, and detector becomes conventional in practice, a compound acronym may arise to designate it succinctly. One example is MALDI-TOF, {{which refers to}} a combination of a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization source with a <b>time-of-flight</b> mass analyzer. Other examples include inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), thermal ionization-mass spectrometry (TIMS) and spark source mass spectrometry (SSMS).|$|E
25|$|Whilst the {{uncertainty}} in the atomic mass computed by <b>time-of-flight</b> methods in atom probe is sufficiently small to allow for detection of individual isotopes within a material this uncertainty may still, in some cases, confound definitive identification of atomic species. Effects such as superposition of differing ions with multiple electrons removed, or through the presence of complex species formation during evaporation may cause two or more species to have sufficiently close time-of-flights to make definitive identification impossible.|$|E
25|$|Spectral skewing is {{the change}} in {{relative}} intensity of mass spectral peaks due to the changes in concentration of the analyte in the ion source as the mass spectrum is scanned. This situation occurs routinely as chromatographic components elute into a continuous ion source. Spectral skewing is not observed in ion trap (quadrupole (this has been seen also in QMS) or magnetic) or <b>time-of-flight</b> (TOF) mass analyzers because potentially all ions formed in operational cycle (a snapshot in time) of the instrument are available for detection.|$|E
25|$|Mass cytometry overcomes the {{fluorescent}} labeling limit by utilizing lanthanide isotopes attached to antibodies. This method could theoretically allow {{the use of}} 40 to 60 distinguishable labels and has been demonstrated for 30 labels. Mass cytometry is fundamentally different from flow cytometry: cells are introduced into a plasma, ionized, and associated isotopes are quantified via <b>time-of-flight</b> mass spectrometry. Although this method permits {{the use of a}} large number of labels, it currently has lower throughput capacity than flow cytometry. It also destroys the analysed cells, precluding their recovery by sorting.|$|E
25|$|Ion {{mobility}} spectrometry (IMS) is {{a technique}} of ion separation in gaseous phases based on their differences in ion mobility when an electric field is applied providing spatial separation prior to MS analysis. With the introduction of DESI as an ion source for ion mobility mass spectrometry, applications for IMS have expanded from only vapor-phase samples with volatile analyses to also in tact structures and aqueous samples. When coupled to a <b>time-of-flight</b> mass spectrometer, analysis of proteins is also possible. These techniques work in tandem to one another to investigate ion shapes and reactiveness after ionization. A key characteristic of this setup {{is its ability to}} separate the distribution of ions generated in DESI prior to mass spectrometry analysis.|$|E
25|$|FTICR-MS differs {{significantly}} from other mass spectrometry techniques {{in that the}} ions are not detected by hitting a detector such as an electron multiplier but only by passing near detection plates. Additionally the masses are not resolved in space or time as with other techniques but only by the ion cyclotron resonance (rotational) frequency that each ion produces as it rotates in a magnetic field. Thus, the different ions are not detected in different places as with sector instruments or at different times as with <b>time-of-flight</b> instruments, but all ions are detected simultaneously during the detection interval. This provides {{an increase in the}} observed signal-to-noise ratio owing to the principles of Fellgett's advantage. In FTICR-MS, resolution can be improved either by increasing the strength of the magnet (in teslas) or by increasing the detection duration.|$|E
25|$|The mass {{spectrum}} {{can be used}} to determine the mass of the analytes, their elemental and isotopic composition, or to elucidate the chemical structure of the sample. MS is an experiment that must take place in gas phase and under vacuum (1.33 * 10−2 to 1.33 * 10−6 pascal). Therefore, the development of devices facilitating the transition from samples at higher pressure and in condensed phase (solid or liquid) into a vacuum system has been essential to develop MS as a potent tool for identification and quantification of organic compounds and peptides. MS is now in very common use in analytical laboratories that study physical, chemical, or biological properties of a great variety of compounds. Among the many different kinds of mass analyzers, the ones that find application in LC-MS systems are the quadropole, <b>time-of-flight</b> (TOF), ion traps, and hybrid quadropole-TOF (QTOF) analyzers.|$|E
25|$|Xbox One {{consoles}} {{ship with}} {{an updated version}} of Kinect; the new Kinect uses a wide-angle <b>time-of-flight</b> camera, and processes 2 gigabits of data per second to read its environment. The new Kinect has greater accuracy with three times the fidelity over its predecessor and can track without visible light by using an active IR sensor. It has a 60% wider field of vision that can detect a user up to 3 feet from the sensor, compared to six feet for the original Kinect, and can track up to 6 skeletons at once. It can also detect a player's heart rate, facial expression, the position and orientation of 25 individual joints (including thumbs), the weight put on each limb, speed of player movements, and track gestures performed with a standard controller. The color camera captures 1080p video that can be displayed in the same resolution as the viewing screen, allowing for a broad range of scenarios. In addition to improving video communications and video analytics applications, this provides a stable input on which to build interactive applications. Kinect's microphone is used to provide voice commands for actions such as navigation, starting games, and waking the console from sleep mode.|$|E
500|$|Kinect 2.0 {{features}} a wide-angle <b>time-of-flight</b> {{camera and a}} 1080p camera, {{in comparison to the}} VGA resolution of the Xbox 360 version, and processes 2GB of data per second to map its environment. Kinect 2.0 has an improved accuracy over its predecessor; it can track up to 6 people simultaneously, referred to as [...] "skeletons", perform heart rate tracking, track controller gestures, and read QR codes to redeem Xbox Live gift cards. By default, voice recognition is active at all times, so the console can receive voice commands from the user, even when the console is in sleep mode. It is possible to wake the console with a command, although settings are available to change which individual Kinect functions are active.|$|E
500|$|As {{with any}} other organic compound, it is prudent to {{characterize}} synthetic oligonucleotides upon their preparation. In more complex cases (research and large scale syntheses) oligonucleotides are characterized after their deprotection and after purification. Although the ultimate approach to the characterization is sequencing, a relatively inexpensive and routine procedure, the considerations of the cost reduction preclude its use in routine manufacturing of oligonucleotides. In day-by-day practice, it is sufficient to obtain the molecular mass of an oligonucleotide by recording its mass spectrum. Two methods are currently widely used for characterization of oligonucleotides: electrospray mass spectrometry (ES MS) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization <b>time-of-flight</b> mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). To obtain informative spectra, {{it is very important}} to exchange all metal ions that might be present in the sample for ammonium or trialkylammonium [...] ions prior to submitting a sample to the analysis by either of the methods.|$|E
500|$|In the 19th century Hippolyte Fizeau {{developed}} {{a method to}} determine {{the speed of light}} based on <b>time-of-flight</b> measurements on Earth and reported a value of [...] His method was improved upon by Léon Foucault who obtained a value of [...] in 1862. In the year 1856, Wilhelm Eduard Weber and Rudolf Kohlrausch measured the ratio of the electromagnetic and electrostatic units of charge, 1/√ε0μ0, by discharging a Leyden jar, and found that its numerical value was very close to the speed of light as measured directly by Fizeau. The following year Gustav Kirchhoff calculated that an electric signal in a resistanceless wire travels along the wire at this speed. In the early 1860s, Maxwell showed that, according to the theory of electromagnetism he was working on, electromagnetic waves propagate in empty space at a speed equal to the above Weber/Kohrausch ratio, and drawing attention to the numerical proximity of this value to the speed of light as measured by Fizeau, he proposed that light is in fact an electromagnetic wave.|$|E
2500|$|With Kepler's formula, {{finding the}} <b>time-of-flight</b> {{to reach an}} angle (true anomaly) of [...] from {{periapsis}} is broken into two steps: ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Time-of-flight</b> (TOF) PET: For modern {{systems with}} a higher time {{resolution}} (roughly 3 nanoseconds) a technique called [...] "Time-of-flight" [...] is used to improve the overall performance. <b>Time-of-flight</b> PET makes use of very fast gamma-ray detectors and data processing system which can more precisely decide the difference in time between the detection of the two photons. Although it is technically impossible to localize the point of origin of the annihilation event exactly (currently within 10cm) thus image reconstruction is still needed, TOF technique gives a remarkable improvement in image quality, especially signal-to-noise ratio.|$|E
2500|$|This {{simplification}} {{is sufficient}} to compute rough estimates of fuel requirements, and rough <b>time-of-flight</b> estimates, {{but it is not}} generally accurate enough to guide a spacecraft to its destination. [...] For that, numerical methods are required.|$|E
2500|$|A sonomicrometer device {{measures}} distance {{by performing}} a timing {{measurement of the}} sound transmitted by one crystal and received by one (or more) adjacent crystals. [...] The ability to resolve small differences in this transit-time (or [...] "time-of-flight") directly correlates {{with the ability to}} resolve small changes in the distances between crystals. [...] The first generation of sonomicrometer devices were analog devices that integrated the <b>time-of-flight</b> as a voltage ramp function. [...] Their resolution was a function of the slope of the ramp and the electrical noise of system components. [...] Those systems output the length measurements as an analog voltage. [...] The second generation of sonomicrometer devices were digital—they measure <b>time-of-flight</b> by incrementing high-speed digital counters. [...] Typically these are 12 to 16-bit counters operating from 32 to 128MHz. [...] A digital system will output length measurements in form of a digital number (the <b>time-of-flight</b> count value). [...] Because of their digital nature, the resolution can be exactly specified as a function of counter clock frequency. [...] For example, when making measurements in biological tissue at body temperature (velocity = 1,590m/s), a digital sonomicrometer operating with a clock speed of 128MHz will have a spatial resolution of 12 micrometres.|$|E
2500|$|Alternatively, Kepler's Equation can {{be solved}} numerically. [...] First one must guess a value of [...] and solve for time-of-flight; then adjust [...] as {{necessary}} to bring the computed <b>time-of-flight</b> closer to the desired value until the required precision is achieved. [...] Usually, Newton's method is used to achieve relatively fast convergence.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the beam}} {{scatters}} off the crystal surface, {{it goes into}} the detector area D. [...] The most commonly used detector setup is an electron bombardment ion source followed by a mass filter and an electron multiplier. [...] The beam is directed {{through a series of}} differential pumping stages that reduce the noise-to-signal ratio before hitting the detector. [...] A <b>time-of-flight</b> analyzer can follow the detector to take energy loss measurements.|$|E
2500|$|... where [...] is the {{frequency}} of the signal and [...] is the wave length. The measurements using {{the frequency}} as measurand utilise the pheonomenon of acoustic resonance where [...] number of wave lengths match the length over which the signal resonate. Both these methods are dependent on the distance over which it measure, either directly as in the <b>Time-of-flight,</b> or indirectly through the matching number of wavelengths over the physical extent of the specimen which resonate.|$|E
2500|$|The {{qualitative}} sketch above {{shows what}} a <b>time-of-flight</b> plot {{might look like}} near a diffraction angle. [...] However, as the crystal rotates away from the diffraction angle, the elastic (main) peak drops in intensity. [...] The intensity never shrinks to zero even far from diffraction conditions, however, due to incoherent elastic scattering from surface defects. [...] The intensity of the incoherent elastic peak and its dependence on scattering angle can therefore provide useful information about surface imperfections present on the crystal.|$|E
2500|$|The {{type of a}} mass {{spectrometer}} most widely used with MALDI is the TOF (<b>time-of-flight</b> {{mass spectrometer}}), mainly due to its large mass range. The TOF measurement procedure is also ideally suited to the MALDI ionization process since the pulsed laser takes individual 'shots' rather than working in continuous operation. MALDI-TOF instrument or reflectron is equipped with an [...] "ion mirror" [...] that reflects ions using an electric field, thereby doubling the ion flight path and increasing the resolution. Today, commercial reflectron TOF instruments reach a resolving power m/Δm of well above 20,000 FWHM (full-width half-maximum, Δm defined as the peak width at 50% of peak height).|$|E
2500|$|The Energetic Particles Detector (EPD) was {{designed}} to measure the numbers and energies of ions and electrons whose energies exceeded about [...] The EPD could also measure the direction of travel of such particles and, {{in the case of}} ions, could determine their composition (whether the ion is oxygen or sulfur, for example). The EPD used silicon solid-state detectors and a <b>time-of-flight</b> detector system to measure changes in the energetic particle population at Jupiter as a function of position and time. These measurements helped determine how the particles got their energy and how they were transported through Jupiter's magnetosphere. The EPD weighed [...] and used 10.1 watts of power on average.|$|E
2500|$|Such as SmartLoader, SpeciMinder, ADAM, Tug Eskorta, and MT 400 with Motivity are {{designed}} for people-friendly workspaces. They navigate by recognizing natural features. 3D scanners or other means of sensing the environment {{in two or three}} dimensions help to eliminate cumulative errors in dead-reckoning calculations of the AGV's current position. [...] Some AGVs can create maps of their environment using scanning lasers with simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and use those maps to navigate in real time with other path planning and obstacle avoidance algorithms. They are able to operate in complex environments and perform non-repetitive and non-sequential tasks such as transporting photomasks in a semiconductor lab, specimens in hospitals and goods in warehouses. For dynamic areas, such as warehouses full of pallets, AGVs require additional strategies using three-dimensional sensors such as <b>time-of-flight</b> or stereovision cameras.|$|E
2500|$|In addition, {{to sharpen}} {{resolution}} {{from the standard}} GPS 100nanoseconds to the 1nanosecond range metrology labs achieve, OPERA researchers used [...] Septentrio’s precise PolaRx2eTR GPS timing receiver, along with consistency checks across clocks (time calibration procedures) which allowed for common-view time transfer. The PolaRx2eTR allowed measurement of the time offset between an atomic clock {{and each of the}} Global Navigation Satellite System satellite clocks. For calibration, the equipment was taken to the Swiss Metrology Institute (METAS). In addition, highly stable cesium clocks were installed both at LNGS and CERN to cross-check GPS timing and to increase its precision. After OPERA found the superluminal result, the time calibration was rechecked both by a CERN engineer and the German Institute of Metrology (PTB). <b>Time-of-flight</b> was eventually measured to an accuracy of 10nanoseconds. The final error bound was derived by combining the variance of the error for the individual parts.|$|E
2500|$|Ocean {{acoustic}} tomography {{is a technique}} used to measure temperatures and currents over large regions of the ocean. [...] On ocean basin scales, this technique {{is also known as}} acoustic thermometry. [...] The technique relies on precisely measuring the time it takes sound signals to travel between two instruments, one an acoustic source and one a receiver, separated by ranges of 100–5000km. [...] If the locations of the instruments are known precisely, the measurement of <b>time-of-flight</b> can be used to infer the speed of sound, averaged over the acoustic path. [...] Changes in the speed of sound are primarily caused by changes in the temperature of the ocean, hence the measurement of the travel times is equivalent to a measurement of temperature. [...] A 1°C change in temperature corresponds to about 4m/s change in sound speed. [...] An oceanographic experiment employing tomography typically uses several source-receiver pairs in a moored array that measures an area of ocean.|$|E
2500|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} angiography (MRA) generates {{pictures of}} the arteries to evaluate them for stenosis (abnormal narrowing) or aneurysms (vessel wall dilatations, at risk of rupture). MRA {{is often used to}} evaluate the arteries of the neck and brain, the thoracic and abdominal aorta, the renal arteries, and the legs (called a [...] "run-off"). A variety of techniques can be used to generate the pictures, such as administration of a paramagnetic contrast agent (gadolinium) or using a technique known as [...] "flow-related enhancement" [...] (e.g., 2D and 3D <b>time-of-flight</b> sequences), where most of the signal on an image is due to blood that recently moved into that plane (see also FLASH MRI). Techniques involving phase accumulation (known as phase contrast angiography) {{can also be used to}} generate flow velocity maps easily and accurately. Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) is a similar procedure that is used to image veins. In this method, the tissue is now excited inferiorly, while the signal is gathered in the plane immediately superior to the excitation plane—thus imaging the venous blood that recently moved from the excited plane.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} study the inelastic {{scattering}} of the helium atom beam due only to single-phonon contributions, an energy analysis {{needs to be made}} of the scattered atoms. [...] The most popular {{way to do this is}} through the use of <b>time-of-flight</b> (TOF) analysis. [...] The TOF analysis requires the beam to be pulsed through the mechanical chopper, producing collimated beam 'packets' that have a 'time-of-flight' (TOF) to travel from the chopper to the detector. [...] The beams that scatter inelastically will lose some energy in their encounter with the surface and therefore have a different velocity after scattering than they were incident with. [...] The creation or annihilation of surface phonons can be measured, therefore, by the shifts in the energy of the scattered beam. [...] By changing the scattering angles or incident beam energy, it is possible to sample inelastic scattering at different values of energy and momentum transfer, mapping out the dispersion relations for the surface modes. [...] Analyzing the dispersion curves reveals sought-after information about the surface structure and bonding. [...] A TOF analysis plot would show intensity peaks as a function of time. [...] The main peak (with the highest intensity) is that for the unscattered helium beam 'packet'. [...] A peak to the left is that for the annihilation of a phonon. [...] If a phonon creation process occurred, it would appear as a peak to the right: ...|$|E
