40|$|Abstract:The paper {{presents}} a failure analysis on a counterweight assembly installed on crank shaft {{which resulted in}} an in-flight shutdown of a piston aeroengine. The counterweight assembly failure includes counterweight block material loss and fractured washer {{which is the most}} crucial part for in-flight shutdown in this type of aeroengine. Macro observation, fractography analysis, metallograp-hy analysis and hardness test were conducted on the failed counterweight assembly. The result shows that failure mechanism of counterweight block and washer is fatigue. The washer failure is likely due to inappropriate heat treatment process and continuous impact in flight by slightly <b>tilted</b> <b>roller.</b> Count-erweight material loss is attributed to stress concentration, low structure strength and impact came from the <b>tilted</b> <b>roller.</b> Finally some safety suggestion on design and maintenance is given...|$|R

40|$|Our {{research}} goal is {{to realize}} a robust navigation in indoor and outdoor environment for autonomous vehicle. An omnidirectional vehicle driven by four Mecanum wheels was chosen for our research platform. Mecanum wheel has 16 <b>tilted</b> <b>rollers</b> (45 degrees against the direction of wheel rotation) around the wheel, so the vehicle moves omnidirectionally by controlling these wheels independently. However, it has a disadvantage in odometry because of wheel slippage. Particularly, when the robot moves laterally, same wheels' rotations generate different traveling distance depending on friction of ground surface. To cope with the problem, we estimate robot's position by detecting optical flow of ground image using vision sensor (visual dead-reckoning). The estimation method is inaccurate comparing with odometry, but it is independent from friction of ground surface. Therefore, the estimated vehicle position can be improved by fusing odometry and visual dead-reckoning based on maximum likelihood technique. This paper describes an odometry method and a visual dead-reckoning method for omnidirectional vehicle, and fusion technique to improve the estimated position of the vehicle. Finally, experimental results support above technique </p...|$|R
50|$|Trailer:The trailer {{offered as}} an option with the Astus 20.1 has a split beam and <b>tilting</b> <b>rollers</b> and is fitted with a winch to {{facilitate}} launching and recovering.Trailer Sailers are boats small and light enough to be towed by ordinary cars. Their width (beam) is constrained by road regulations. In Europe, to be towable on the road {{the width of the}} boat and trailer must not exceed 2.55m. The maximum weight is determined by the towing capacity of the towing vehicle and by the type of driving license.Folding trimarans are particularly well suited as trailer sailers because their narrow width with folded floats makes them towable on the road whilst their wide beam with floats extended makes them stable and safe on the water. Furthermore, the absence of ballast makes them considerably lighter than a keelboat of similar size (375 kg for the Astus 20.1 compared to 1000 kg for a 20 ft keelboat). Heavier boats require a stronger and heavier road trailer, making the towing weight even greater.|$|R

40|$|International audienceSalt rollers are low-amplitude {{deflections}} of {{the upper}} surface of a salt layer which occur below zones of normal faulting in the overlying sediments. They are widely recognised in association with tilted blocks or listric fault rollover systems. Laboratory experiments on brittle ductile models made of sand and silicone putty are used to study the modes of development, the external shape and the internal structures of these salt rollers. Firstly, flow and strain patterns within décollement zones are described. Finite strain combines layer-perpendicular shortening and layer-parallel shear. Additional flow cells within rollers perturb the laminar flow of the décollement, inducing a passive folding of planar markers. The same type of flow and strain patterns occur in all types of rollers, ranging from those occurring below tilted blocks to those associated with growth faults. Finally, an analysis of roller shapes through the measurement of aspect ratios and asymmetry ratios shows that the shapes of <b>tilted</b> blocks <b>rollers</b> and growth fault rollersƒwhich differ at initiation tend to converge with increasing deformation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this research is}} geometrical optimization of half toroidal Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) in order to achieve high power transmission efficiency. The dynamic analysis of CVT is implemented and contact between the disk and the roller is modeled viaelastohydrodynamic (EHL) lubrication principles. Computer model is created using geometrical, thermal and kinetic parameters to determine the efficiency of CVT. Results are compared by other models to confirm the model validity. Geometrical parameters are obtained by means of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, while the optimization objective is to maximize the power transmission efficiency. Optimization was conducted over a wide range of selected input parameters that are EHL oil temperature, <b>roller</b> <b>tilting</b> angle and rotational velocity of input disk. Optimization results show that the power transmission efficiency alters with changes of input parameters, while the optimized geometrical parameters are approximately the same. Variations of power transmission efficiency over a wide range of input parameters were calculated for optimized geometry, while the highest value of power transmission efficiency occurs in low value of EHL oil temperatures and input disk rotational velocities. The optimized structure shows average power transmission efficiency equal to 93. 4 % over a wide range of input parameters...|$|R
40|$|One {{challenge}} in designing web conveyance systems is controlling the displacement and vibration of the webs by guides without introducing instabilities or higher frequency disturbances from flange impacts. A {{solution to this}} problem is to use an actively or passively <b>tilted</b> guide or <b>roller</b> to steer the web. In this paper, a model of tilted guides with friction is developed, and it is shown that tilted guides produce a change in the web’s displacement, slope, bending moment, and shear force. When the web is conceptually unwrapped from its path, the normal force between the web and a tilted guide has a component that acts {{in the direction of the}} web’s lateral displacement, resulting in an equivalent force and bending moment acting on the web. The model is validated by measurements, and is compared to a previously existing model of guide tilt. In the configurations studied, the displacement of the web near the guide is linearly dependent on the tilt angle and tension and it increases exponentially with the web’s span length. When the guide’s tilt is oriented towards the center of the web’s wrap around the guide, the equivalent bending moment is zero in the absence of friction, and there is good agreement between the model developed in this paper and the previously existing model. However, when the center of the web’s wrap is oriented 90 ° away from the guide’s tilt orientation, the equivalent force is zero in the absence of friction, and measurements demonstrate the necessity of the equivalent bending moment...|$|R
40|$|Advanced façades {{include a}} {{combination}} of active and passive solar shading and daylight harvesting systems to reduce energy demand while maintaining occupant comfort. A comprehensive simulation study was carried out to evaluate the impact of an advanced dynamic shading configuration on the thermal and daylighting performance of building perimeter zones. The studied system consists of a fixed exterior reflective overhang and a movable internal light-shelf in the upper window section as well as controlled bottom-up roller shades in the view aperture. The overhang provides partial exterior shading, blocking solar gains in the summer, and reflects natural light into the room through the upper portion of the façade. The movable internal light-shelf not only blocks sunlight from entering the room through the top window, but also enhances daylight distribution in the room {{as a result of}} deeper natural light penetration. However, if no additional shading is provided for the view aperture, glare and overheating are bound to happen, offsetting the energy benefits, and resulting in occupant discomfort. Controlled bottomup roller shades were therefore employed in the view aperture so as to eliminate direct glare and allow partial view to the outside. The bottom-up controlled shades and the light-shelf are appropriately controlled so as to always block direct sunlight. The study was conducted for a classroom located in Chicago, IL, and the impact of the following parameters on energy demand was investigated: exterior overhang characteristics; interior light shelf position, size, surface reflectance and <b>tilt</b> angle control; <b>roller</b> shade control modes and fabric material properties. ^ In order to accurately model solar gains and exterior luminous sources for the entire year, the façade was split in three variable parts depending on the position of the shades and the relative position of the overhang. In this time-varying 9 -surface enclosure, dynamic view factors were calculated between all surfaces throughout the year. For the thermal analysis, a comprehensive thermal network (heat balance) model was developed, and solved explicitly using the finite difference method to quantify the impact of the above parameters on the building’s thermal loads. A parametric analysis of the studied variables allows for selection of overhang and light shelf characteristics and suitable shade fabric to reduce building energy demand. It was observed that the implementation of the system can result in up to 43 % and 16 % reduction in annual cooling and heating demand respectively. Moreover, peak heating and cooling demands were cut down by 50 % and 32 % in that order. In the daylighting analysis, a multiple bounce radiosity method was used to determine hourly horizontal work plane illuminance and daylight autonomy. Energy savings resulting from the implementation two lighting control strategies (on/off control and continuous dimming) were also evaluated. Compared with standard automated interior roller shades, the studied system provides better natural light distribution, lower contrast ratios and longer periods of view to the outside. Lighting energy savings reached 45 % with on/off electric lighting control, and up to 70 % with continuous dimming control. ...|$|R
