5|$|The {{adoption}} of steam power {{was only one}} of a number of <b>technological</b> <b>advances</b> which revolutionized warship design in the 19th century.

5|$|At Khe Sanh, the U.S. Marines {{held the}} high ground, and their {{artillery}} forced the North Vietnamese {{to use their}} own artillery from a much greater distance. By contrast, at Điện Biên Phủ, the French artillery (six 105mm batteries and one battery of four 155mm howitzers and mortars) was only sporadically effective;Furthermore, by 1968, the American military presence in Vietnam dwarfed that of the French, and included numerous <b>technological</b> <b>advances</b> such as effective helicopters.|$|E
5|$|Geothermal {{power is}} cost-effective, reliable, sustainable, and {{environmentally}} friendly, but {{has historically been}} limited to areas near tectonic plate boundaries. Recent <b>technological</b> <b>advances</b> have dramatically expanded the range and size of viable resources, especially for applications such as home heating, opening a potential for widespread exploitation. Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels.|$|E

5000|$|One major <b>technological</b> <b>advance</b> was the {{extended}} {{use of the}} holes after drilling. Geophysical and geochemical measurements were made during and after drilling, and occasionally long-term seismic monitoring devices were installed in the holes. This extended understanding of the dynamic processes involved in plate tectonics. Another <b>technological</b> <b>advance</b> involved {{the introduction of the}} hydraulic piston corer (HPC) in 1979, which permitted the recovery of virtually undisturbed cores of sediment.This greatly enhanced the ability of scientists to study ancient ocean environments.|$|R
5|$|In {{the short}} time frame of the Manhattan Project, Hanford {{engineers}} produced many significant <b>technological</b> <b>advances.</b> As {{no one had ever}} built an industrial-scale nuclear reactor before, scientists were unsure how much heat would be generated by fission during normal operations. Seeking the greatest possible production while maintaining an adequate safety margin, DuPont engineers installed ammonia-based refrigeration systems with the D and F reactors to further chill the river water before its use as reactor coolant.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} {{the last years of}} the 18th century that the area {{developed}} from a loose collection of hamlets into the town of Coatbridge. The town's development and growth have been intimately connected with the <b>technological</b> <b>advances</b> of the industrial revolution, and in particular with the hot blast process. Coatbridge was a major Scottish centre for iron works and coal mining during the 19th century and in this period was described as 'the industrial heartland of Scotland' and the 'Iron Burgh'.|$|E
5|$|Rossia was {{originally}} {{intended to be a}} repeat of the armored cruiser , but the Director of the Naval Ministry wanted the armor to cover more of the ship's side. However the design went through a number of changes during late 1892 and early 1893 and incorporated a number of <b>technological</b> <b>advances</b> that had recently become available. One notable change was the deletion of Ruriks sailing rig.|$|E
25|$|In 1975, Sebastian von Hoerner {{proposed}} {{a formula for}} population growth which represented hyperbolic growth with an infinite population in 2025. The hyperbolic growth of the world population observed until the 1970s was later correlated to a non-linear second order positive feedback between demographic growth and technological development. This feedback {{can be described as}} follows: <b>technological</b> <b>advance</b> → increase in the carrying capacity of land for people → demographic growth → more people → more potential inventors → acceleration of <b>technological</b> <b>advance</b> → accelerating growth of the carrying capacity → faster population growth → accelerating growth of the number of potential inventors → faster <b>technological</b> <b>advance</b> → hence, the faster growth of the Earth's carrying capacity for people, and so on. The transition from hyperbolic growth to slower rates of growth is related to the demographic transition.|$|R

5|$|The Joint Commission was tasked {{to report}} on the {{implementation}} of the Coinage Act of 1965, and make recommendations {{from time to time to}} the president, the Treasury Secretary, and Congress. The matters within its remit were to include <b>technological</b> <b>advances,</b> the need of the economy for coins, whether the U.S. should continue to maintain the price of silver, and whether the silver dollar should again be minted. Section 304 appropriated such money as may be needed to carry out the Coinage Act.|$|E
5|$|Although the Industrial Revolution did {{not much}} affect the rural parts of Clwyd, there was {{considerable}} industrial activity in the North Wales Coalfield in the north-east of the county, particularly around Wrexham. The Bersham Ironworks at Bersham, in the same area, was {{at the forefront of}} <b>technological</b> <b>advances</b> and was most famous for being the original working site of the industrialist John Wilkinson who invented new processes for boring cannons. The Williams-Wynn family of Wynnstay had become rich after the dissolution of the monasteries and owned vast estates in Clwyd with resources including lead, tin and copper as well as corn and timber.|$|E
5|$|China's power {{began to}} decline in the 16th century when the rulers of the {{subsequent}} Ming Dynastyneglected the importance of China's trade from sea power. The Ming rulers let China's naval dominance and its grip on the Spice trade slacken, and the European powers stepped in. Portugal, with its <b>technological</b> <b>advances</b> in naval architecture, weaponry, seamanship and navigation, took over the Spice Trade and subdued China's navy. With this, European Imperialism {{and the age of}} European Hegemony was beginning, although China still retained power of many of its areas of trade.|$|E

5|$|In {{recent years}} the Dutch brick {{industry}} has attracted unwelcome attention from the European Union (EU) competition authorities. In the early 1990s the industry had excess capacity due to <b>technological</b> <b>advances,</b> competition from other materials and an economic slowdown. Producers with combined market share of 90% agreed to reduce capacity, shutting down the older and inefficient plants. The producers compensated those who closed plants. However, the agreement also included fixing production quotas and fining members who produced more than their quota. The members of what was in effect a cartel were forced to drop the quota agreement by the EU.|$|E
5|$|Industrialists such as Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, Andrew W. Mellon, and Charles M. Schwab {{built their}} {{fortunes}} in Pittsburgh. Also based in Pittsburgh was George Westinghouse, credited with such advancements {{as the air}} brake and founder of over 60 companies, including Westinghouse Air and Brake Company (1869), Union Switch & Signal (1881), and Westinghouse Electric Company (1886). Banks {{played a key role}} in Pittsburgh's development as these industrialists sought massive loans to upgrade plants, integrate industries and fund <b>technological</b> <b>advances.</b> For example, T. Mellon & Sons Bank, founded in 1869, helped to finance an aluminum reduction company that became Alcoa.|$|E
5|$|Several {{important}} <b>technological</b> <b>advances</b> {{had become}} available by this time, however, which necessitated several {{changes to the}} design. The advent of smokeless powder permitted smaller guns with greater muzzle velocities; the Navy had accordingly designed a 12-inch (305mm) 40-caliber high-velocity gun. In addition, Krupp cemented armor had been developed in Germany; the steel was a significant improvement over the older Harvey process. Since the steel was stronger, thinner armor plating could achieve {{the same level of}} protection and more importantly, significant savings in weight. Water-tube boilers were also now sufficiently reliable for use in warships. These were lighter and substantially more efficient than older fire-tube boilers.|$|E
