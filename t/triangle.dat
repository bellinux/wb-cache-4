5|$|Relatives of the Reuleaux <b>triangle</b> {{arise in}} the problem of finding the minimum {{perimeter}} shape that encloses a fixed amount of area and includes three specified points in the plane.

Olav Akselsen at first proposed supporting the pontoon bridge, but after a trial vote he withdrew the proposal and also Stord supported the <b>Triangle</b> Link. The following week, Sveio Municipal Council voted in favor the <b>Triangle</b> Link, without either a debate or dissent in the council. Fitjar Municipal Council voted on 15 March to work with both proposals. Hordaland Public Roads Administration still supported a pontoon bridge, and stated that {{two and a half years}} of work on a master plan had been wasted. A new master plan for the <b>Triangle</b> Link was published in early 1989, estimating the costs at NOK890 million. It recommended that the Langevåg–Buavåg Ferry remain, but the other four ferry services be terminated. The report concluded that the maintenance costs of the fixed link would be lower than the subsidies of the ferry, that the project would be economical of society and would reduce emissions.|$|E
