However, those {{who knew how to}} bargain could obtain significant discounts. El Chacharitas states that the sale of antiques was a very good business in the past but less so now. Much of the reason is the degradation of the neighborhood, and the invasion of those selling mass-produced, unlicensed and counterfeit merchandise. The antiques market also has been hurt by Mexico City mayor Marcelos Ebrard’s decision to close roads in and around the historic center as well as Paseo de la Reforma to vehicular traffic on Sundays, the day this market operates. For some vendors, business is down by as much as sixty percent, as many upper class residents will not use public transportation <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> market.|$|E

Describing the filming process, Blair stated: [...] "Shooting the scenes for the bush fire and {{everything}} surrounding it - the wedding - the funeral - was so draining. It was full on." [...] Blair had to film scenes involving Carmella singing at Marco's funeral, which she deemed [...] "close to home" [...] because she had done it at her grandmother's funeral. She found it distressing, as they filmed in a real graveyard. She had previously been reluctant to sing on-screen but felt it was justified for Marco's funeral. Blair commented on Carmella's repetitive bad luck, stating: [...] "She's gone through so much already, just <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> point. This should really be a happy time for her, but it's not." [...] After all the hurdles she faced, Carmella became a stronger person.

On being drafted, Swanigan said: [...] "Being {{selected}} tonight in the NBA Draft is a dream come true. I have been thinking of this moment for a long time. I know this is only the first step in my professional career, but I am extremely excited for to begin this journey". Painter said, [...] "We are thrilled that Biggie has achieved his lifelong dream of being selected in the NBA Draft.

Swanigan was the first Purdue basketball player to be drafted at the sophomore level or lower. During the 2017 NBA Summer League, Swanigan recorded 16.1 points, 10.6 rebounds, 2.25 assists and 1.4 steals per game in all eight games the Trail Blazers played in during the event, including the Summer League Championship game, where they ultimately lost to the Los Angeles Lakers. Despite that, Swanigan would earn All-Summer League First Team honors for leading the Trail Blazers into the Summer League Finals.|$|E

[...] On the second verse, Eminem says that he has indeed made mistakes, commenting on his Relapse album: [...] "That last Relapse CD was ehh/ Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground/ Relax, I ain't going to do that now." [...] When he says [...] "All I'm trying to say is get back, click clack, pow", a gunshot is heard.

[...] After the chorus, Eminem sings a bridge and focuses on a positive change, as he says [...] "I just can't keep living this way, so starting today I'm breaking out of this cage."

500|$|On 16 August 2010, Iranian {{officials}} withdrew Mohammed Soleimani {{from the}} men's under-48-kilogram category taekwondo final against Israel's Gili Haimovitz, citing an ankle injury. According to the officials, Soleimani had first hurt his ankle at the World Junior Championships in Mexico {{earlier in the}} year, and the injury had flared up again during his semifinal contest against the US's Gregory English. Soleimani was sent to hospital for an X-ray, and his ankle was put into a cast. Haimovitz was awarded the gold medal by default at a victory ceremony at the Suntec International Convention Centre from which Soleimani, the silver medallist, was absent. Interviewed later on, Soleimani said he was [...] "very sad" [...] to have missed the bout as he was [...] "sure [...] {{was going to get}} the gold medal". Israel's chef-de-mission Daniel Oren claimed that the pullout had been politically motivated. He said: [...] "It's not the first time this has happened at the Olympics. But this is a first for a medal match. To be honest, once our boy got into the final, we knew {{that this is going to}} happen. I spoke to our boy after the final and he, of course, was disappointed that he did not have a chance to win his gold through an actual fight. I feel more sorry for the Iranian boy. He must have trained hard <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> stage and was not given a chance to fight. We are dealing with sports here, youth sports, in fact. It's a pity that politics got involved." [...] However, IOC spokesman Mark Adams said: [...] "As far as the IOC is concerned, there is no sinister intent here. What we know factually is that the athlete injured his ankle and was sent to the hospital for an X-ray. Tests revealed he did not suffer anything broken, and he is all right now. So unless more factual information is available, it [...] is mere speculation." [...] This was reiterated by IOC President Jacques Rogge on 17 August: [...] "He [...] was driven to the hospital, was examined by a Singaporean doctor, totally independent, not belonging to the organisation and he diagnosed an ankle sprain. For us, that's the end of the story." [...] Previously, Iran has stated that since its existing government does not recognize Israel as a state, its policy is to withdraw from competing against the country.|$|E

2500|$|<b>To</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> point, Sanger refined a {{partition}} chromatography method first developed by Richard Laurence Millington Synge and Archer John Porter Martin {{to determine the}} composition of amino acids in wool. Sanger used a chemical reagent 1-fluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (now, also known as Sanger's reagent, fluorodinitrobenzene, FDNB or DNFB), sourced from poisonous gas research by Bernhard Charles Saunders at the Chemistry Department at Cambridge University. Sanger's reagent proved effective at labelling the [...] N-terminal amino group {{at one end of}} the polypeptide chain. He then partially hydrolysed the insulin into short peptides, either with hydrochloric acid or using an enzyme such as trypsin. The mixture of peptides was fractionated in two dimensions on a sheet of filter paper, first by electrophoresis in one dimension and then, perpendicular to that, by chromatography in the other. The different peptide fragments of insulin, detected with ninhydrin, moved to different positions on the paper, creating a distinct pattern that Sanger called [...] "fingerprints". [...] The peptide from the N-terminus could be recognised by the yellow colour imparted by the FDNB label and the identity of the labelled amino acid at the end of the peptide determined by complete acid hydrolysis and discovering which dinitrophenyl-amino acid was there.|$|E

2500|$|Wilder's brigade was {{successful}} in racing toward Hoover's Gap and capturing it {{on the first day}} of battle, which led to his unit's subsequent nickname, the Lightning Brigade. Their opponents, the 1st Kentucky Cavalry, skirmished briefly and withdrew under pressure, but were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade, he determined to continue pushing through the Gap and hold it before the Confederate reinforcements could arrive. The Confederate brigade of Brig. Gen. William B. Bate, supported by Brig. Gen. Bushrod Johnson's brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Wilder's brigade held the Gap until the main infantry units of the XIV Corps arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, [...] "You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> gap for three days." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later, as {{it became}} clear that Peniston was leaping from the Overweight Pooch's album {{to the top of the}} charts, rumor had it the Pooch was stewing over Peniston's using Female Preacher as her springboard. Tonya Davis, {{pregnant}} at the time of recording her album, swore she harbored no jealousy towards Peniston. [...] "There's no jealousy, because she has a voice. I gave her the chance, but I didn't give her a voice," [...] the rapper insisted for Phoenix New Times in July 1992, and Peniston, interviewed by the same newspaper in the meantime, reacted by her own words. [...] "I feel like anything's possible and I know one thing. If I wasn't at this spot, I still would be achieving <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> spot." [...] Ironically enough, Sallard eventually threw in a few back-up vocals for Peniston on a song with a significant title, [...] "You Win, I Win, We Lose", while Peniston, who in return played an agent to get a record deal also for Malaika (whose album Sugar Time scored in 1993 two Top 5 hits on the US Dance chart, including the No. 1 single [...] "Gotta Know (Your Name)") mentioned the Pooch's name on her own debut album in addition, leaving Davis a note saying [...] "thanks for letting me be a part of Female Preacher".|$|E
2500|$|Winters sends a list {{of demands}} to the world governments and gives them thirty minutes to comply, and {{subsequently}} orders Kettlewell to connect to the launch computers and prepare to send the launch codes. Kettlewell, who never expected their plan <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> stage, hesitates, and in the ensuing discussion, Sarah Jane and Harry attempt to escape with Kettlewell's assistance. Winters orders K1 to stop the pair, but the robot, already conflicted to its programming, inadvertently fires the disintegrator gun at Kettlewell, killing him. The death of its creator puts K1 in a further confused state, falling {{to the ground and}} apparently shutting down. [...] Winters attempts to program the countdown, but the Doctor arrives and successfully counters it. As UNIT forces take Winters and Jellicoe away, K1 reactivates and begins to attack UNIT. K1 seeks out Sarah Jane to protect her, a result of an Oedipus complex it developed from Sarah Jane's previous compassion, according to the Doctor. UNIT fires the disintegrator gun at the robot but the blast is absorbed, causing the robot to grow to an enormous size. Realising the growth is due to the living metal that Kettlewell used in constructing K1, the Doctor races back to Kettlewell's lab to synthesize a batch of metal-biodegradable virus, a side discovery made by Kettlewell. The Doctor throws a bucket of solution containing the virus onto K1, and the robot slowly shrinks down in size before it vanishes.|$|E

I mean this thing -- both races here -- has been bad to the bone," [...] Harvick said after winning his fourth race at this 1-mile oval in the last five tries. Harvick would not have made the final four to race for the title without a win. I could tell that we were going to have to win because everybody was running in the front of the pack that we were racing against. I think this says a lot about our team. We had our backs against the wall. We're in victory lane and we get to go on." [...] In the final turn, Ryan Newman sent Kyle Larson into the wall to secure his place in the championship race. “I just gave it my all,” Newman said. “I wasn’t proud of it but did what I had <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> next round. That little boy has got a lot of things coming in this sport and he used me up like that in a truck at Eldora a couple years ago. From my standpoint, I call it even but I think if he was in my position, he’d have done the same thing.” [...] "Coming to the finish, there were a lot of cars racing really hard,” said Larson today. “I knew (Newman) was right around me and knew he needed to gain some spots to keep from getting eliminated from the Chase. It's a little upsetting he pushed me up to the wall, but I completely understand the situation he was in,” said Larson, “(I) can't fault him for being aggressive there. I think a lot of drivers out here would have done something similar if they were in that position." [...] Kevin Harvick (with the much-needed win), Joey Logano, Denny Hamlin, and Ryan Newman were the four drivers who will race for the championship, which also meant that NASCAR will be having a new Sprint Cup Series champion. Jeff Gordon, Carl Edwards, Brad Keselowski, and Matt Kenseth were the four drivers eliminated.|$|E
