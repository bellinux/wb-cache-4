25|$|Neoclassical {{economics}} {{studies the}} behaviour of individuals, households, and organizations (called economic actors, players, or agents), when they manage or use scarce resources, which have alternative uses, to achieve desired ends. Agents {{are assumed to}} act rationally, have multiple desirable ends in sight, limited resources to obtain these ends, a set of stable preferences, a definite overall guiding objective, and the capability of making a choice. There exists an economic problem, subject to study by economic science, when a decision (choice) is made {{by one or more}} resource-controlling players to attain the best possible outcome under bounded rational conditions. In other words, resource-controlling agents maximize value subject to the constraints imposed by the information the agents have, their cognitive limitations, and the finite amount of time <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> and execute a decision. Economic science centres on the activities of the economic agents that comprise society. They are the focus of economic analysis.|$|E

25|$|In series 10, {{the format}} to Bootcamp was changed: the judges find out their {{categories}} before Bootcamp starts, and each judge will {{make decisions on}} who is performing in the Six-Chair Challenge by eliminating the contestants, this is up to each individual judge. From Series 11 onwards, the judges do not know their categories before the Bootcamp, so <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the decisions together. After the Bootcamp round, the mentor challenges their contestants through the Six-Chair Challenge. Judges make decisions on who to put through to judges' houses straight after each act has performed, with those getting a yes taking {{a chair in the}} final six chairs on stage. It is up to the mentor to decide, which act they want to take to judges' houses, but once all six spots are full, if the mentor wants to send another act through to the next stage it means they have to replace one of those who were previously given a yes. This format was very poorly rated by many members of the British public. Bootcamp still took place, but only highlights were shown in the first episode of the Six-chair challenge. In series 12, all of Bootcamp aired on-screen. A more brutal twist to the Six-Chair Challenge was introduced in series 14, where the mentor is to sit at a smaller table {{at the side of the}} arena while making the decisions, while the other judges remain at a larger table on the other side.|$|E

500|$|One of the {{political}} pressures, it is suggested by Susan Himmelweit {{is the issue of}} whom to empower. When there are considerations of policies, politicians usually only consider work as paid labor, and do {{not take into account the}} interdependence between unpaid work and paid work. It is also often common to think that women make economic decisions similarly to men. This is typically not the case, because for men, payment is simply a compensation for lost leisure time. However, for women, when they are working in the paid sector, they are still losing money because <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> provisions for the domestic labor they are unable to do, such as caring for children or making dinner from scratch due to lack of resources such as child care. Her net financial gain is less than the financial gain of a man because she has to spend her earnings on providing for these provisions. In addition, increasing paid work hours in order to have more money may have negative effects on the woman due to the increased total work hours and decreased leisure time. [...] Therefore, policies that give greater power to people who do paid labor, such as cutting back on public expenditure in order to lessen income taxes have an adverse effect on female employment and the effect that the double burden has on females. Such policies give greater power and consideration towards people who work in the paid sector, and less towards people who work in the unpaid sector.|$|E

Hendrickson expressed her happiness in playing a [...] "manipulative" [...] character who takes advantage of people. She said, [...] "I get to play, not only this edgy, spicy kind of character, but she's actually pretty funny too, so it's nice to bring some humor into it as well." [...] Chloe is a [...] "bitchy" [...] stylist who is hired at Jabot Cosmetics as a fashion consultant. Explaining her initial portrayal of Chloe, Hendrickson stated, [...] "I {{was the one who}} wanted to make her edgy and funny. Most of the people I know who are in the fashion business are a little bitchy. I wanted to make Chloe interesting, instead of just playing her like some girl who was putting on fancy clothes. There was no conflict there. The writers definitely gave me that in the writing, and I tweaked it a little. They seemed to enjoy it. Each day, Chloe kept getting funnier and bitchier." [...] She first works with young model Lily Winters (Christel Khalil), the new face of Jabot whom she treats harshly. According to Hendrickson, Chloe [...] "takes her job very seriously. [...] is used to working with more professional models and is very hard on Lily regarding, you know, keeping up some sort of appearance if you will, regarding the fashion industry, which is weight. So [...] starts to give [...] a little weight complex because she is constantly throwing in her face that either she doesn't fit into things or <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> things larger for her, etc." ...|$|E

2500|$|While the Charter {{has enjoyed}} {{a great deal of}} popularity, with 82% of Canadians {{describing}} it as a good thing in opinion polls in 1987 and 1999, the document has also been subject to published criticisms {{from both sides of the}} political spectrum. One left-wing critic is Professor Michael Mandel, who wrote that in comparison to politicians, judges do not have to be as sensitive to the will of the electorate, nor do <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure their decisions are easily understandable to the average Canadian citizen. This, in Mandel's view, limits democracy. Mandel has also asserted that the Charter makes Canada more like the United States, especially by serving corporate rights and individual rights rather than group rights and social rights. He has argued that there are several things that should be included in the Charter, such as a right to health care and a basic right to free education. Hence, the perceived Americanization of Canadian politics is seen as coming at the expense of values more important for Canadians. The union movement has been disappointed in the reluctance of the courts to use the Charter to support various forms of union activity, such as the [...] "right to strike".|$|E

2500|$|Stiglitz bases his {{argument}} on {{the themes that}} his decades of theoretical work have emphasized: namely, what happens when people lack the key information that bears on the decisions <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make,</b> or when markets for important kinds of transactions are inadequate or don't exist, or when other institutions that standard economic thinking takes for granted are absent or flawed. Stiglitz stresses the point: [...] "Recent advances in economic theory" [...] (in part referring to his own work) [...] "have shown that whenever information is imperfect and markets incomplete, {{which is to say}} always, and especially in developing countries, then the invisible hand works most imperfectly." [...] As a result, Stiglitz continues, governments can improve the outcome by well-chosen interventions. Stiglitz argues that when families and firms seek to buy too little compared to what the economy can produce, governments can fight recessions and depressions by using expansionary monetary and fiscal policies to spur the demand for goods and services. At the microeconomic level, governments can regulate banks and other financial institutions to keep them sound. They can also use tax policy to steer investment into more productive industries and trade policies to allow new industries to mature to the point at which they can survive foreign competition. And governments can use a variety of devices, ranging from job creation to manpower training to welfare assistance, to put unemployed labor back to work and cushion human hardship.|$|E
