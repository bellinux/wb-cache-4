5|$|Although both {{shows are}} set in the same hospital, <b>the</b> <b>Casualty</b> set in Bristol was not large enough to {{encompass}} the surgical ward and operating theatre required for Holby City, so the series was produced at the BBC's Elstree Studios in north London. As a result, some crossover scenes had to be shot twice, first on <b>the</b> <b>Casualty</b> set and then again at Elstree, with cast members travelling between the two locations. McHale wrote the series' first episode, and served as the show's lead writer. Holby City premiered on 12 January 1999 on BBC One. Its first series ran for nine episodes of 50 minutes in length, which were broadcast first in the 8.10pm, then 8pm timeslot on Tuesdays.|$|E

5|$|Holby City and Casualty {{are both}} set in Holby City Hospital, in the fictional county of Wyvern, in the {{southwest}} of England close to the Welsh border. The city exterior is represented by Bristol, though Holby City is filmed at BBC Elstree Centre in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire. <b>The</b> <b>Casualty</b> set in Bristol was not large enough to encompass the surgical ward and operating theatre required for Holby City, and as a result, some crossover scenes in the first episode had to be shot twice, first on <b>the</b> <b>Casualty</b> set and then again at Elstree, with cast members travelling between the two locations. In October 2007, BBC cutbacks led The Daily Telegraph to report that the Elstree site would be sold, and Holby City relocated to share a set with Casualty, possibly in Cardiff. In March 2009, the BBC confirmed that Casualty would {{move to a new}} set in Cardiff, however in the following month, The Guardian announced that the BBC would retain Elstree Studios for at least another four years.|$|E

He was offered an honorary {{commission}} as a Second Lieutenant but refused, fearing it would prejudice his medical exemption from combat duties. A short visit over a long weekend to the Western Front was arranged but without a commission Nevinson had to be accompanied wherever he went and his movements were restricted. Nevinson quickly fell out with the Army minder assigned to him in France, and claimed he was refused permission to visit <b>the</b> <b>casualty</b> stations he wanted to sketch in.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately the Gallipoli {{campaign}} was a disastrous failure. It did not achieve {{any of the}} objectives that had been given as a justification for it, and due to the inexperience of high commanders and mismanagement there were an unacceptably high number of casualties amongst the participating troops, not only from {{as a result of}} combat, but also due to widespread disease that resulted from poor sanitation and hygiene in the front lines and a breakdown in <b>the</b> <b>casualty</b> clearance and resupply and logistics systems. It has been estimated that {{over the course of the}} campaign there were 26,111 Australian casualties with 8,141 killed. Other Allied casualties—killed and wounded—included: 7,571 New Zealanders, 120,000 British and 27,000 French.|$|E
5|$|Casualty Clearing Stations were {{deliberately}} sited {{as close}} to the front line as possible, since many injuries caused during battle required more urgent attention than the time to travel to a field hospital allowed. Often within seven miles of the front line, they were considered extremely dangerous, and the appropriateness of having nurses attend such stations was hotly debated within the military. As a result of its proximity to the front, the station would often come under enemy attack, as was the case of the 38th British Casualty Station on 23 August. <b>The</b> <b>Casualty</b> Station suffered a heavy air raid by German forces, with the sterilisation room being destroyed and the camp being hit by numerous bombs. Despite the heavy attack, Corkhill, who was attending to the wounded at the time, remained calm and continued to aid the patients. For her actions, she was recommended for and later awarded the Military Medal.|$|E
5|$|Corkhill {{went back}} to serve at the 1st Australian General Hospital in Rouen on 16 June 1916 for the {{remainder}} of the year. On 23 January 1917, she went to England on leave until 9 February. She then served at the Australian Hospital until July 1918, with the exception of her two leaves; to England in October 1917 and to Paris in February 1918. On 15 May 1918, Corkhill was sent to Abbeville to join the 3rd Australian General Hospital, and was briefly posted to the 38th British Casualty Clearing Station on 2 June. After serving in with the 3rd Australian General Hospital for a further two months, she was again posted to <b>the</b> <b>Casualty</b> Clearing Station on 21 August 1918.|$|E

5|$|However, landing paratroopers, and {{especially}} gliders, without {{the cover of}} darkness left them exceedingly vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire. The official history of the British Airborne Divisions highlights {{the cost of this}} trade-off, stating that of the 416 gliders that landed, only 88 remained undamaged by enemy fire, and that between 20–30percent of the glider pilots were casualties. Another historian argues that the gliders landing in daylight was a calamity, with the 194th Glider Infantry Regiment having two-thirds of their gliders hit by ground fire and suffering heavy casualties as they landed. <b>The</b> <b>casualty</b> rates were worsened by the slow rates of release and descent of the gliders themselves, and the fact that each aircraft towed two gliders, slowing them even further; as the time to release a glider unit was 3–4 times longer than a parachute unit, the gliders were vulnerable to flak.|$|E

Within a few years Hobbs became the commissioner of Oregon State Industrial Accident Commission, working on getting taxes due on the Oregon & California Lands. In 1917, with the United States entering World War I, she began a long association with the Red Cross. From 1917 to 1922 she worked in Europe, including time spent as the chief of <b>the</b> <b>casualty</b> division in Paris, France. In that position Hobbs was responsible for notifying dead soldiers' next of kin. She returned to Europe in the 1930s, working in the Rhine Valley when it was occupied by France.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. 21st Infantry Regiment {{suffered}} 228 killed, 61 wounded, 215 captured, and 27 {{missing in}} the battle; a total of 531 casualties. Of those, 130 of the captured and 20 of the missing died. Additionally, 23 other American units engaged in the region suffered 31 killed, 79 wounded, 15 captured and 9 missing; in total a further 134 casualties. This brought {{the total number of}} casualties for the three-day period to 665 and made Chochiwon the bloodiest battle for American forces yet in the conflict; greater than <b>the</b> <b>casualty</b> counts at Osan, Pyongtaek and Chonan combined. The loss of materiel was also great with the 21st Infantry Regiment losing enough equipment and materiel to outfit two rifle battalions, and enough clothing to equip 975 men.
