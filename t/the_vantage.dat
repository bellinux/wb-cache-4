5|$|A {{cyclorama}} {{painting by}} the French artist Paul Philippoteaux entitled The Battle of Gettysburg, {{also known as}} the Gettysburg Cyclorama, depicts Pickett's Charge from <b>the</b> <b>vantage</b> point of the Union defenders on Cemetery Ridge.

It was restored and relocated to the new National Park Service Visitor Center in September 2008.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the poor}} {{performance}} of the Aston Martin AMR-One prototype, Aston Martin Racing decided to switch to running <b>the</b> <b>Vantage</b> as a factory effort in 2012. The car was slightly upgraded into <b>the</b> <b>Vantage</b> GTE, which has improved bodywork and engine performance over the older GT2 model. One car is entered into the FIA World Endurance Championship, and a 2nd one will appear at the 24 Hours of Le Mans.|$|E
25|$|A major {{difference}} in <b>the</b> <b>Vantage</b> S is {{the inclusion of}} the Sportshift II transmission, a seven speed sequential manual gearbox, as standard.|$|E

25|$|In late 2008, Aston Martin debuted {{an updated}} version of the N24, known as <b>the</b> V8 <b>Vantage</b> GT4. Its primary {{alteration}} is the introduction of the new 4.7L V8 that also debuted in <b>the</b> production V8 <b>Vantage.</b> This replaces <b>the</b> 4.3L V8 in <b>the</b> V8 <b>Vantage</b> N24. <b>The</b> suspension and brakes have also been updated.|$|R
25|$|It {{was also}} called Kapae-poto, ("Short horizon"), because it rarely sets from <b>the</b> <b>vantage</b> point of New Zealand; and Kauanga ("Solitary"), {{when it was}} the last star visible before sunrise.|$|E
25|$|As {{seen from}} <b>the</b> <b>vantage</b> {{point of the}} air stream (e.g. by a balloonist), the wheels impede the vehicle—decelerating the earth imperceptibly—and drive the rotor (acting like a propellor), which accelerates the air and propels the vehicle.|$|E
25|$|Susperregui {{also pointed}} out more contradictions in the {{accepted}} account of the photograph, noting that Capa mentioned in interviews that the militiaman {{had been killed by}} a burst of machine-gun fire rather than a sniper's bullet. Capa also gave different accounts of <b>the</b> <b>vantage</b> point and technique he used to obtain the photograph.|$|E

25|$|In April 2016, <b>the</b> V12 <b>Vantage</b> S was {{announced}} {{to be produced}} with a 7 speed Dog-leg gearbox, unusual for its day and age. In the United States, <b>the</b> V12 <b>Vantage</b> GTS will feature the dog-leg gearbox, but only 100 were produced.|$|R
25|$|The 2004 artwork in {{the station}} house is called Passage by Tom Patti, and was {{designed}} in conjunction with FX+FOWLE Architects.

50|$|As of December 2014, Aston Martin had {{released}} few of {{the technical}} details of the car, but they have revealed that it will feature the company's 6-speed manual transmission unit that is used on their V8-engined cars. The car's chassis {{is based on a}} modified version of the VH Platform that underpins <b>the</b> V8 <b>Vantage.</b> However <b>the</b> DB10 has a longer wheelbase and is nearly as wide as the One-77. It is powered by <b>the</b> <b>Vantage's</b> 4.7 L V8 engine.|$|R

25|$|The visionary {{plan would}} not be {{realized}} until the mega-mergers of the 1990s with the BNSF Railway and Union Pacific remaining as the two surviving major rail carriers west of the Mississippi River. From <b>the</b> <b>vantage</b> point of the 1974 railroad industry, Klitenic's plan was viewed as an unmanageable and far too radical solution to both the granger railroad issue and the larger issue {{of the future of}} rail freight transportation in general.|$|E
25|$|Being {{powered by}} the default V12 engine with 510BHP the concept {{features}} a new handcrafted aluminium body with a front {{similar to the one}} of <b>the</b> <b>Vantage</b> and a heavily modified middle, roof and rear section uniting both of the companys design DNAs. Another extra is the endurance racing fuel tank carrying up to 120 litres of fuel. Though being a racing concept Aston Martin thinks about producing a small number of street-adapted versions.|$|E

25|$|Announced {{on the eve}} of the New York Auto Show in April 2014, the V8 Vantage GT is what is in effect, the US {{version of}} <b>the</b> <b>Vantage</b> N430.

25|$|Writers have {{described}} Mommsen's history as transformative of prior works on ancient Rome. He employed new sources, e.g., ancient inscriptions, {{in order to}} gain new insights. He also wrote in a new fashion. Yet his point of view itself was new, a product of his own life and times, a 19th-century outlook from middle Europe. From <b>the</b> <b>vantage</b> point of our latter era, the 19th-century view presents a result that appears now as somewhat of a distortion. On the other hand, each individual's outlook will necessarily encompass unique insights.|$|E
25|$|At the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan in 2003, Aston Martin {{introduced}} the AMV8 Vantage concept car.

25|$|During February 1999, the Pakistan Army {{began to}} re-occupy the posts it had {{abandoned}} {{on its side}} of the LOC in the Kargil region, but also sent forces to occupy some posts on the Indian side of the LOC.

25|$|The camera has a {{long and}} {{distinguished}} history {{as a means of}} recording scientific phenomena from the first use by Daguerre and Fox-Talbot, such as astronomical events (eclipses for example), small creatures and plants when the camera was attached to the eyepiece of microscopes (in photomicroscopy) and for macro photography of larger specimens. The camera also proved useful in recording crime scenes and the scenes of accidents, such as the Wootton bridge collapse in 1861. The methods used in analysing photographs for use in legal cases are collectively known as forensic photography. Crime scene photos are taken from three vantage point. <b>The</b> <b>vantage</b> points are overview, mid-range, and close-up.|$|E

The exhibit includes views of the plumbing from <b>the</b> <b>vantage</b> point of those residing or working at the prison, including that of the prisoners, prison guards, and the manufacturers of the plumbing. Additionally, the exhibit showcases the sculptures as having both opaque and translucent factors, in which the translucent parts will glow within the cells.|$|E
