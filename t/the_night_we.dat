A biographical film directed by Martin Scorsese {{has long been}} in production. A 1998 episode of the BBC documentary series Arena, The Voice of the Century, focused on Sinatra. Alex Gibney directed a four-part biographical series on Sinatra, All or Nothing At All, for HBO in 2015. A musical tribute was aired on CBS television in December 2015 to mark Sinatra's centenary.|$|E
500|$|We... between {{fear and}} despair and hope. And that formed itself {{into such a}} heap of stuff, that I can't really {{describe}} it – how it was and what it was. Every evening, we went to pieces and during <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> <b>we</b> tried to build ourselves up again, so we could go into the street... and look like human beings again... And [...] was {{like being in a}} windmill; it turned and moved.|$|E
500|$|... "The She", {{named after}} a nightclub that the Deals' brother used to visit, has been {{described}} as having a funky feel, with a start-and-stop rhythm of bass and drums. Bryant found the track's keyboard part reminiscent of Stereolab's music, while AllMusic's Heather Phares likened the entire song to Jefferson Airplane's [...] "White Rabbit". Cibula mentioned that the [...] "creepy/cool ... sound [...] the characteristic Kim Deal familiar/strange lyrics: 'Sorrow blowin' through the vents / I'm over Houston / You're over <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>we</b> met.'" [...] Kim Deal plays every instrument on [...] "Too Alive" [...] and both sisters sing. Moores noted the track's buoyant feel and the steady strumming style of Deal's guitar. To Phares, the song possesses an immediacy as though the listener were there watching the performance in person.|$|E

60|$|For {{the balance}} of the day and all <b>the</b> {{following}} <b>night</b> <b>we</b> raced across that ochre wilderness with the pursuers at our back ever gaining upon us. Slowly but surely they were lessening the distance between us. Just before dark they had been close enough for us to plainly distinguish that they were green Martians, and all during <b>the</b> long <b>night</b> <b>we</b> distinctly heard <b>the</b> clanking of their accoutrements behind us.|$|R
500|$|In October 1990, {{a decade}} after his divorce from Angie, Bowie and Somali-born supermodel Iman were {{introduced}} by a mutual friend. Bowie recalled, [...] "I was naming the children <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>we</b> met... it was absolutely immediate." [...] They married in 1992. Tin Machine resumed work the same month, but their audience and critics, ultimately left disappointed by the first album, showed little interest in a second. Tin Machine IIs arrival was marked by a widely publicised and ill-timed conflict over the cover art: after production had begun, the new record label, Victory, deemed the depiction of four ancient nude Kouroi statues, judged by Bowie to be [...] "in exquisite taste", [...] "a show of wrong, obscene images", requiring air-brushing and patching to render the figures sexless. Tin Machine toured again, but after the live album [...] failed commercially, the band drifted apart, and Bowie, though he continued to collaborate with Gabrels, resumed his solo career.|$|E
500|$|Tite and Cubitt's {{design was}} based around a three-storey main building, {{separated}} from the LSWR's main viaduct by a private access road beneath the LNC's twin rail lines. The private access road was intended to allow mourners to arrive and leave discreetly, and to avoid the need for hearses to stop in the public road. The ground floor contained a grand entrance hall and staircase for mourners attending first and second class funerals, a smaller entrance hall and staircase for those attending lower classes of funeral, and two mortuaries which occupied {{the majority of the}} floor. A large room adjacent to the mortuary held a reserve stock of around 300 coffins. [...] Most mourners would have commissioned their own coffins, or used coffins bought by the deceased during their lifetime but, explained an official of the LNC (in 1898) the reserve of coffins was kept so that [...] "should a guest die in a hotel, and the landlord wished to keep it quiet, we are notified, {{and in the middle of}} <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>we</b> come for the corpse, and take it away in one of our ready-made wooden overcoats". The first floor held the LNC's boardroom, the LNC's funerary workshops, a series of separate waiting rooms for those attending second and third class funerals, and the building's main toilets. The second floor, level with the LSWR railway line, held the train shed covering the two private rail lines and the single platform at which the trains stopped, eight or nine waiting rooms for first class mourners, and further toilets for their use. A steam-powered lift carried coffins from the lower floors to the platform level. A glass roof was positioned in order that no shadow be cast on the hearse carriage waiting at the platform at the time the trains were scheduled to depart, and the western wall was windowless to avoid passengers using the LSWR station being able to see into the Necropolis station. Glass panels inset between the two rail lines allowed sunlight through to the private access road below. Unlike most railway stations of the period, the designs of the first, second and third class waiting rooms were largely identical with only superficial differences.|$|E
2500|$|In Jack Kerouac's 1955 novel, On The Road, the book's narrator Sal Paradise {{and other}} {{prominent}} character Dean Moriarty (an alias of Kerouac's friend Neal Cassady) encounter the Sabine River. [...] It is recorded as an [...] "evil old river," [...] and [...] "the mansion of the snake...we {{could almost hear}} the slither of a million copperheads." [...] A novel in which the theme rests heavily on familiarity with the American continent, it is interesting that Kerouac labels the region as [...] "a manuscript of <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>we</b> couldn't read." ...|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "He Made a Terrible Mistake", after {{learning}} about Connor's role on <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>Wes</b> was murdered, Laurel {{goes on a}} rant against him saying he's lying, he's the reason Wes died, and that, he should take a gun and kill himself, unaware that Connor is already struggling with suicidal thoughts.|$|R

2500|$|George Martin {{claimed he}} first heard {{it at the}} [...] "Love Me Do" [...] re-make session on 11 September. Ringo Starr in Anthology stated: [...] "On my first visit in September we just ran through some tracks for George Martin. We even did 'Please Please Me'. I {{remember}} that, because while we were recording it I was playing the bass drum with a maraca {{in one hand and}} a tambourine in the other." [...] John Lennon in Anthology stated: [...] "We'd had a top 30 entry with 'Love Me Do' and we really thought we were on top of the world. Then came 'Please Please Me'—and wham! We tried to make it as simple as possible. Some of the stuff we've written in the past has been a bit way-out, but we aimed this one straight at the hit parade. … We almost abandoned it as the b-side of 'Love Me Do'. We changed our minds only because we were so tired <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>we</b> did Love Me Do. We'd been going over it a few times and when we came to the question of the flipside, we intended using 'Please Please Me'. Our recording manager, George Martin, thought our arrangement was fussy, so we tried to make it simpler. We were getting very tired, though, and we just couldn't seem to get it right. We are conscientious about our work and we don't like to rush things." ...|$|E
