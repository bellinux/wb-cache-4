5|$|Coinage {{began on}} the first United States silver dollar, known as <b>the</b> <b>Flowing</b> Hair dollar, in 1794 {{following}} the construction and staffing of the Philadelphia Mint. The Coinage Act of 1792 called for the silver coinage to be struck in an alloy consisting of 89.2% silver and 10.8% copper. However, Mint officials were reluctant to strike coins with the unusual fineness, so {{it was decided to}} strike them in an unauthorized alloy of 90% silver instead. This caused depositors of silver to lose money when their metal was coined. During the second year of production of <b>the</b> <b>Flowing</b> Hair dollar, it was decided that the denomination would be redesigned. It is unknown what prompted this change or who suggested it, though numismatic historian R.W. Julian speculates that Henry William de Saussure, who was named Director of the Mint on July 9, 1795, may have suggested it, as he had stated a redesign of the American coinage as one of his goals before taking office. It is also possible that <b>the</b> <b>Flowing</b> Hair design was discontinued owing to much public disapproval.|$|E

40|$|Radiatively driven {{transfer}} flow {{perpendicular to}} a luminous disk was examined under a fully special relativistic treatment, {{taking into account}} radiation transfer. <b>The</b> <b>flow</b> {{was assumed to be}} vertical, and the gravity, the gas pressure, and the viscous heating were ignored. In order to construct the boundary condition at <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> top, <b>the</b> magic speed above the flat source was re-examined, and {{it was found that the}} magic speed above a moving source can exceed that above a static source (~ 0. 45 _c). Then, <b>the</b> radiatively driven <b>flow</b> in a luminous disk was numerically solved, from <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> base (disk "inside"), where <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> speed is zero, to <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> top (disk "surface"), where the optical depth is zero. For a given optical depth and appropriate initial conditions at <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> base, where <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> starts, a loaded mass in <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> was obtained as an eigenvalue of the boundary condition at <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> top. Furthermore, a loaded mass and <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> final speed at <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> top were obtained as a function of the radiation pressure at <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> base; <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> final speed increases as the loaded mass decreases.

5|$|At {{a variety}} of elevations, meadows provide important, {{productive}} habitat for wildlife. Animals come to feed on the green grasses and use <b>the</b> <b>flowing</b> and standing water found in many meadows. Predators, in turn, are attracted to these areas. The interface between meadow and forest is also favored by many animal species because of the proximity of open areas for foraging and cover for protection. Species that are highly dependent upon meadow habitat include great grey owl, willow flycatcher, Yosemite toad, and mountain beaver.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 8th {{century as}} {{architectural}} styles evolved, new elements were added as is evident in kasuga-zukuri (Kasuga Shrine and Hakusandō/Kasugadō at Enjō-ji), <b>the</b> <b>flowing</b> roof or nagare-zukuri (Shimogamo Shrine), hachiman-zukuri (Usa Shrine) and hiyoshi-zukuri (Hiyoshi Taisha). The nagare-zukuri continues to be the more popular style, followed by the kasuga-zukuri. The honden of Ujigami Shrine dates to this period. At {{the end of the}} Heian period torii and fences were commonly replaced with two-storied gates and grand colonnades copied from temple architecture. The influence of the residential shinden-zukuri style of palaces and mansions is apparent in shrines such as Itsukushima Shrine.|$|E

When an airfoil produces lift, <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> ahead of <b>the</b> airfoil is deflected upward, <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> {{above and below the}} airfoil is deflected downward, and <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> behind <b>the</b> airfoil is deflected upward again, leaving the air far behind <b>the</b> airfoil <b>flowing</b> in <b>the</b> same direction as <b>the</b> oncoming <b>flow</b> far ahead. <b>The</b> <b>flow</b> above <b>the</b> upper surface is always sped up, and <b>the</b> <b>flow</b> below <b>the</b> airfoil is usually slowed down.

5|$|In the 1330s, {{when the}} architects of Europe were {{embracing}} the Flamboyant style, English architecture moved away from <b>the</b> <b>Flowing</b> Decorated {{in an entirely different}} and much more sober direction with the reconstruction, in highly modular form, of the choir of the Norman abbey, now cathedral, at Gloucester. The Perpendicular style, which relies on a network of intersecting mullions and transoms rather than on a diversity of richly carved forms for effect, gives an overall impression of great unity, in which the structure of the vast windows of both clerestory and east end are integrated with the arcades below and the vault above. The style proved very adaptable and continued with variations in the naves of Canterbury and Winchester, and in the choir of York.|$|E
5|$|Dating from 1074 to 1548, Lincoln Cathedral {{is one of}} {{the largest}} of England’s cathedrals and it has been claimed by John Ruskin that, architecturally, it is worth any two of the others put together.

The central tower is the tallest in England and is visible for many miles as it rises in spectacular fashion from a high hill. The decagonal Chapter House with its huge flying buttresses is the first polygonal chapter house in England. Of the interior, the finest part is considered to be the late-13th-century “Angel Choir” with “gorgeous layers of tracery” and enriched with carved angels.

5|$|The person {{chosen to}} fill the {{position}} was statesman and former congressman Elias Boudinot. Upon assuming his duties at the Mint on October 28, Boudinot was informed of the silver standard {{that had been used}} since the first official silver coins were struck. He immediately ordered that this practice be ceased and that coinage would begin in the 89.2% fineness approved by the Coinage Act of 1792. The total production of 1795 dollars (including both <b>the</b> <b>Flowing</b> Hair and Draped Bust types) totalled 203,033. It is estimated that approximately 42,000 dollars were struck bearing the Draped Bust design. Boudinot soon ordered that production of minor denominations be increased. Later, assayer Albian Cox died suddenly from a stroke in his home on November 27, 1795, leaving the vital post of assayer vacant. This, together with Boudinot's increased focus on smaller denominations, as well as a lull in private bullion deposits (the fledgling Mint's only source of bullion), caused a decrease in silver dollar production in 1796. The total mintage for 1796 was 79,920, which amounts to an approximate 62% reduction from the previous year's total.|$|E
5|$|When Ptolemy {{wrote his}} Geography around 150 AD, the Arun {{was called the}} Trisantonis, with later {{accounts}} using the same name. Trisantonis {{is thought to be}} a Brythonic word for 'the trespasser', indicating the river's tendency to flood land near to the river. Trisanto translates directly as 'one who goes across'. There is also a theory that the Arun may have been known as the Trisantonis in its lower reaches close to the sea, but known as the Arnus (from the Brythonic 'Arno' meaning run, go, or flow) in its upper reaches. It is possible that the town of Arundel may mean Arno-dell, or dell of <b>the</b> <b>flowing</b> river. By the Middle Ages the river was known as the river of Arundel, the Arundel river, or the high stream of Arundel. An alternative name, the Tarrant (derived from Trisantona), is, however, attested in 725 and 1270, and is reflected in the road name Tarrant Street, one of the main roads running through the town roughly parallel to the river. The first use of the modern name was recorded in 1577, but the alternative names of Arundel river or great river continued to be used for many years.|$|E
