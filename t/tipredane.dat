50|$|<b>Tipredane</b> (developmental {{code name}} SQ-27239) is a {{synthetic}} glucocorticoid corticosteroid which was never marketed.|$|E
50|$|Many {{years of}} {{successful}} growth were financed by sales of sodium cromoglycate {{in a variety}} of formulations used to treat asthma and allergies of the eye among several disease areas. However, the loss of lucrative product licences for Opticrom and Imferon in the USA in 1991 and the failure of clinical trials for <b>Tipredane,</b> an asthma drug, in 1993 revealed bleak prospects for the business.|$|E
40|$|Glucocorticoids {{are highly}} {{effective}} in controlling chronic inflammatory diseases, such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis, but the exact molecular mechanism of their anti-inflammatory action remains uncertain. They act by binding to a cytosolic receptor (GR) resulting in activation or repression of gene expression. This may occur via direct binding of the GR to DNA (transactivation) or by inhibition {{of the activity}} of transcription factors such as AP- 1 and NF-κB (transrepression). The topically active steroids fluticasone propionate (EC 50 = 1. 8 × 10 − 11 [*]M) and budesonide (EC 50 = 5. 0 × 10 − 11 [*]M) were more potent in inhibiting GM-CSF release from A 549 cells than <b>tipredane</b> (EC 50 = 8. 3 × 10 − 10 [*]M), butixicort (EC 50 = 3. 7 × 10 − 8 [*]M) and dexamethasone (EC 50 = 2. 2 × 10 − 9 [*]M). The anti-glucocorticoid RU 486 also inhibited GM-CSF release in these cells (IC 50 = 1. 8 × 10 − 10 [*]M). The concentration-dependent ability of fluticasone propionate (EC 50 = 9. 8 × 10 − 10 [*]M), budesonide (EC 50 = 1. 1 × 10 − 9 [*]M) and dexamethasone (EC 50 = 3. 6 × 10 − 8 [*]M) to induce transcription of the β 2 -receptor was found to correlate with GR DNA binding and occurred at 10 – 100 fold higher concentrations than the inhibition of GM-CSF release. No induction of the endogenous inhibitors of NF-κB, IκBα or I-κBβ, was seen at 24 [*]h {{and the ability of}} IL- 1 β to degrade and subsequently induce IκBα was not altered by glucocorticoids. The ability of fluticasone propionate (IC 50 = 0. 5 × 10 − 11 [*]M), budesonide (IC 50 = 2. 7 × 10 − 11 [*]M), dexamethasone (IC 50 = 0. 5 × 10 − 9 [*]M) and RU 486 (IC 50 = 2. 7 × 10 − 11 [*]M) to inhibit a 3 ×κB was associated with inhibition of GM-CSF release. These data suggest that the anti-inflammatory properties of a range of glucocorticoids relate to their ability to transrepress rather than transactivate genes...|$|E
