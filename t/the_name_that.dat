5|$|Rakoto's {{opportunity}} for national fame arrived with the 1958 visit of French President Charles de Gaulle to Madagascar. The visit was {{in conjunction with}} the dissolution of colonial status and naming of Philibert Tsiranana as Prime Minister, part of the island's transition to full independence in 1960. Tsiranana had previously seen the flutist perform and invited Rakoto and his group of 18musicians to accompany de Gaulle and perform traditional pieces during a portion of the French statesman's walking tour through the capital city of Antananarivo. Following this performance, Rakoto dedicated himself full-time to a career in music, performing regularly at traditional celebrations on the island. Tsiranana, who became president of Madagascar two years later, was the first to refer to the artist as Rakoto Frah, <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>that</b> the musician would use {{for the rest of his}} career.|$|E

25|$|The core of Taoist {{theology}} {{is the concept}} of Dào 道, which is both the order of nature and the source of it. Differently from the God of the common religion or even Confucianism, Taoism espouses a negative theology declaring the impossibility to define the Dao. The core text of Taoism, the Daodejing, opens with the verses: «The Dao that can be said is not the eternal Dao, <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>that</b> can be said is not the eternal name».|$|E
25|$|When {{those groups}} {{declined}} to involve themselves in something this controversial, the organizers approached the Communist Party. The Communist Party had, in fact, been making organizing efforts {{of its own}} among transit workers, beginning in 1933. John Santo and Austin Hogan, Trade Union Unity League organizers, met with the Clan na Gael's members in a cafeteria at Columbus Circle on April 12, 1934. <b>The</b> <b>name</b> <b>that</b> they chose for the new union was {{a tribute to the}} Irish Transport and General Workers Union led by Jim Larkin and Connolly twenty years earlier.|$|E

In addition, <b>the</b> <b>Name</b> <b>That</b> Tune Orchestra was supplemented by The Sound System, a rock music ensemble led by Dan Sawyer with Steve March as its featured vocalist.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>name</b> <b>that</b> {{appears in}} the {{machine-readable}} zone {{at the bottom of}} the visa represents the holder’s Cyrillic name mapped into the Roman alphabet. This allows Russian computer systems to read the Cyrillic name, despite the machine readers only being able to read Roman alphabet letters. As a result, the spelling of a name in the machine-readable zone does not necessarily reflect its spelling in the visa’s name field. For example, the name “Christoph” would appear in the field as “Kpиcтoф/Christoph”, but the MRZ would contain the name “Kristof”.|$|E
25|$|In 1941, {{after the}} death of K.S. Stanislavsky, the Stanislavsky Opera Theatre merged with the Nemirovich-Danchenko Music Theatre by {{initiative}} of Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko.

The Theatre was the only one to stay in Moscow throughout the war, it wasn’t evacuated. The company gave regular performances even in October and December 1941, when the Nazi troops approached the Russian capital and from 1942 to 1945 it presented two or three new productions each season.|$|E
