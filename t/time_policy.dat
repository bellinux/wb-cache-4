2500|$|On average, Communications service {{providers}} utilize {{an average of}} just 35 to 40 percent of available network capacity. Recently, telecommunications software vendors such as Telcordia and Ericsson have promoted yield management as a strategy for communications {{service providers}} to generate additional revenue and reduce capital expenditures by maximizing subscriber use of available network bandwidth. Approaches include basing a strategy on innovative services explicitly designed to use only spare capacity and borrowing proven methods from the airline industry. The approach can {{be more difficult to}} implement in the telecommunications industry than the airlines sector because of the difficulty to control and sometimes refuse network access to customers. Similarities that exist between the airline and telecom industries include a large sunk cost combined with low marginal cost, perishable inventory, reservations, pricing flexibility and the opportunity to upsell. Differences that present challenges for communications service providers include low-value transactions and overall network complexity. Suggested approaches to executing a successful yield management strategy include accurate network information collection, bandwidth capacity allocation that doesn’t impact service quality, the deployment of service management software such as real <b>time</b> <b>policy</b> and real-time charging, and using new marketing channels to target consumers [...] with innovative services.|$|E

Second, for the case of 2 and 3 levels (queues), we show that optimal quantum multi-level <b>time</b> sharing <b>policy</b> (MLOQTP) can result in significant performance improvements over other policies under certain traffic and workload conditions. Finally, we investigate the impact of number of levels on the overall performance and propose a simple statistical regression model that can accurately estimate overall performance of a multi-level time sharing system...|$|R

40|$|Evidence is {{mounting}} that providing workers with time off when they or {{their family members}} are ill reaps enormous benefits. Policymakers and businesses alike {{from across the country}} can see the advantages first-hand of paid sick time (also known as paid sick leave). Paid sick time may be a business-initiated workplace policy or an earned sick <b>time</b> public <b>policy,</b> which is a law that allows employees to earn paid time off at work. These policies enable workers to address health needs without putting their – or their families’ – economic security at risk. Employers that offer paid sick time know that these policies improve worker morale and productivity, attract talented employees, and reduce costly turnover. The benefits to public health and our larger economy also are clear: Paid sick <b>time</b> <b>policies</b> help prevent the spread of contagious illnesses to coworkers and customers, allow workers to get preventive care, and curb unnecessary and costly emergency room visits by allowing workers to seek medical attention during regular business hours. Sick workers can recover faster and get back on the job when they get the care and rest they need. Paid sick time is a basic building block of family economic security—and when families are strong, our entire economy benefits.

50|$|The world {{faces the}} {{challenge}} of a global transformation to sustainable energy systems. Substantial up-front investments are needed to improve energy efficiency and switch to renewable energies. At the same time, these investments offer great opportunities, because strategic innovations can be triggered and new markets can develop {{in the course of}} the transformation process. Savings on the cost of fossil fuels in conventional technologies could completely offset the investment in renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency by as early as 2040. The private capital needed for the transformation is available and can be mobilised if a suitable political framework is put into place. A corresponding regulatory policy should be introduced to make such investment more attractive for the private sector. The WBGU advocates a proactive state that integrates energy, environmental and climate policy; this could reduce existing investment risks by developing a stable, long-term transformative regulatory framework. At the same <b>time,</b> <b>policy</b> makers should expand the opportunities for participation. Germany is currently leading this transformation, both in terms of technological innovations and in the creation of a suitable policy framework. Our country is able to give the world an example of how the Energiewende (energy-system transformation) can generate more, not less prosperity.|$|E

50|$|A {{major theme}} of Orphanides’ {{research}} on monetary economics {{has been the}} evaluation and design of monetary policy in real time. He argued that since the data available to policy makers at the <b>time</b> <b>policy</b> decisions are made are imperfect and subject to substantial revisions, the historical analysis of monetary policy decisions {{as well as the}} evaluation of alternative policy strategies must be based on the information available in real time (Orphanides, 2001, Orphanides, 2003). His work has documented significant problems arising from policy decisions drawing on unobservable concepts such as the output gap. Orphanides has argued against output-gap-based policy rules, such as the Taylor rule, and in favour of non-activist policy rules drawing on Milton Friedman and Knut Wicksell. He has stressed that overemphasizing the output gap as reflected, for example, in the Taylor rule or optimal control policy, is counterproductive for stabilizing the macroeconomy. He has also provided an explanation of the high inflation experience in the United States during the late 1960s and 1970s as resulting from policy focused too closely at stabilizing the real economy, by aiming to close the perceived output and unemployment gaps. According to this analysis, the high inflation resulted from the fact these gaps were badly mismeasured due to overoptimistic real time estimates of potential output and the natural rate of unemployment (Orphanides, 2003).In related work, Orphanides and Simon van Norden, have explained that the unreliability of output gap measures in real time is of a more general nature than previously thought. They documented the unreliability of various statistical techniques for measuring the output gap in real-time and also the lack of predictive power of real-time output gap estimates for forecasting inflation, thus calling into question policy approaches that rely on the output for stabilization policy (Orphanides and Norden, 2002).|$|E
