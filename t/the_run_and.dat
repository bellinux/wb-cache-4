5|$|Once again, the Red Sox {{took the}} lead in the first inning when Ramírez hit a home run off former Red Sox pitcher Jeff Suppan. Martínez was the {{starting}} pitcher for the Red Sox, and {{in the bottom of the}} first inning, he allowed the Cardinals to load the bases with one out. Edmonds then hit a fly ball towards Ramírez in left field, who caught it on <b>the</b> <b>run</b> <b>and</b> threw to catcher Jason Varitek at home plate. Varitek tagged out Walker, who was attempting to score from third, ending the inning.|$|E

He led into the straight before being overtaken by Dylan Thomas, and although he had no chance with the winner he stayed on to take second ahead of notable winners such as Red Rocks (Breeders' Cup Turf), Maraahel (Hardwicke Stakes) and Finsceal Beo (1000 Guineas). O'Brien was pleased with <b>the</b> <b>run</b> <b>and</b> said that Duke of Marmalade was still improving.

5|$|Most of the highest-scoring games {{happened}} before the 1995–96 season, when the average scoring (points per game) per team {{was always in}} the 100s. Since that season, the average has dropped down to the 90s. Only two post-1995 games make the top-ten lists of both the regular season and playoffs: a May 10, 2003 game between the Dallas Mavericks and the Sacramento Kings and a December 7, 2006 game between the Phoenix Suns and New Jersey Nets. Both the Mavericks and the Suns were coached by Nelson and Mike D'Antoni respectively, both of whom also made use of <b>the</b> <b>run</b> <b>and</b> gun style.|$|E
5|$|The {{center field}} fence at Cleveland's Dunn Field was 460 feet from home plate {{until it was}} {{shortened}} to 420 feet in 1920. Even so, Speaker played so shallow in the outfield {{that he was able}} to execute six career unassisted double plays at second base, catching low line drives on <b>the</b> <b>run</b> <b>and</b> then beating baserunners to the bag. At least once he was credited as the pivot man in a routine double play. He was often shallow enough to catch pickoff throws at second base. At one point, Speaker's signature move was to come in behind second base on a bunt and make a tag play on a baserunner who had passed the bag.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} to examine the impact of foreign labour on Malaysian {{economic}} growth using panel data from three sectors: manufacturing, services, and construction for the period of 1990 ~ 2010. <b>The</b> short <b>run</b> <b>and</b> long <b>run</b> effects of foreign labour on output growth are analysed using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag approach. The study shows that the skilled and semi-skilled foreign labours have a positive and significant impact on the output growth in both <b>the</b> short <b>run</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> long <b>run.</b> However, <b>the</b> study finds that the unskilled foreign labour adversely affects output growth in both <b>the</b> short <b>run</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> long <b>run...</b>|$|R

5|$|Unlike his predecessors, {{who were}} notable for their inertia, Caxias {{went on the}} {{offensive}} from the start. In July 1843, Marques de Sousa attacked the rebel capital, Piratini, which had been all but abandoned by the Ragamuffins. He marched from there to Pelotas and recaptured the town he had lost in 1836. On 2 December, he fought and won a small skirmish with rebels near the imperial army's main encampment. He remained {{in the village of}} São Gabriel for most of 1844, guarding it undisturbed. The Ragamuffins were by this time on <b>the</b> <b>run,</b> <b>and</b> they sued for peace. Caxias chose Marques de Sousa to take a Ragamuffin representative to discuss a peace accord with the central government; they arrived in Rio de Janeiro on 12 December. The negotiations were successful, and the war came to an end on 1 March 1845.|$|E
5|$|The Cardinals {{came back}} {{to take the lead}} in the bottom of the seventh inning. Bell led the inning by hitting a double into left field. After a Hafey fly out, O'Farrell hit a single to Ruth in left field, and Bell ran from second base to home to score <b>the</b> <b>run</b> <b>and</b> give the Cardinals a 2–1 advantage. In the top of the ninth inning, the Yankees tied up the game. Gehrig lined a double to left field, and Lazzeri bunted a single, {{advancing}} Gehrig to third base. Ben Paschal went in as a pinch-hitter for Joe Dugan and singled into center field, scoring Gehrig and advancing Lazzeri to second base. Severeid laid down a weak bunt, and Cardinals catcher O'Farrell threw to third base to make the force out on Lazzeri. With runners at first and second base, Pennock hit a groundball to shortstop Thevenow, who tossed it to second base to get the force out on Severeid. With Pennock at first base and Paschal at third base, Combs grounded to second base, ending the Yankees' hope of taking the lead. The Cardinals could not break the 2–2 tie in the bottom of the ninth inning, so the game went into extra innings.|$|E
5|$|Amy {{discovers that}} Kyle's adoptive parents have died. She and Victoria attend the funeral {{to see if}} Kyle is there and see him at the wake with his adoptive grandmother, Joanie Wright (Denise Black). When Kyle drops his toy, Amy {{picks it up and}} tries to give it back but Joanie doesn't hear her so she keeps it. Amy returns the next day and a barmaid gives her Joanie's address. Amy plans to return the toy but changes her mind and leaves. Needing to see Kyle, she persuades Andy to let her take baby Jack to Kyle's playgroup and makes friends with Joanie, telling her that she is {{studying}} childcare and asking if she needs any help with Kyle. Joanie accepts and allows Amy to look after Kyle occasionally. Val is thrilled when she finds out but Victoria and Eric think it is a bad idea and Eric tells Joanie that Amy is Kyle's birth mother. Disgusted, Joanie refuses to let Amy see Kyle again but is eventually persuaded to change her mind. Sadly, while Amy and Kyle are on a picnic together, Kyle almost drowns and Joanie blames Amy. She promptly bans her from seeing Kyle and refuses to even consider changing her mind, even calling the police when Amy visits repeatedly, who warn her to stay away. Desperate to see her son, Amy and Andy (who she is now dating) call Social Services to see if she can get custody but the social worker tells her that being awarded custody is very unlikely. Feeling now that the adoption was a mistake, Amy decides to snatch Kyle and go on the run. Kerry, understanding how Amy feels, tries to talk her out of it but when she can't, decides to help her. They go to Kyle's playgroup and kidnap him and Kerry drives them to the docks. During the drive, Val phones repeatedly but they don't answer. Eventually Kerry answers and Amy tearfully reveals her plans before throwing the phone away. Eric checks the computer's internet history and finds out where Amy is going. Cain, Andy, Val, Eric and Joanie all rush to the docks. In the end, Cain persuades Amy to return Kyle, warning her of the complications of the life on <b>the</b> <b>run</b> <b>and</b> how Kyle might be affected. She says goodbye to Kyle and gives him to Cain but fearing she'll be sent to prison, Amy leaves, devastating Val. Val later gets a call from Amy and learns that she is living in Ireland with her aunt.|$|E

5|$|Wilson {{was part}} of the {{starting}} eleven in Stevenage's first ever League One fixture {{at the start of the}} 2011–12 season, playing the whole game as the club drew 0–0 at home to Exeter City. In Stevenage's next game, Wilson provided the assist for Stacy Long's goal in a 4–3 extra-time defeat to Peterborough United in the League Cup. He also assisted Craig Reid in the club's 3–1 away win at Bournemouth on 16 August 2011. Three days later, on 19 August, Wilson signed a contract extension at the club. He added to his two previous assists by assisting Craig Reid's first goal in the club's 4–2 home win against Rochdale on 3 September. Wilson scored his first goal of the 2011–12 season in a 5–1 home win over Sheffield Wednesday, scoring Stevenage's fourth goal of the match just before half-time. In the same game, Wilson provided <b>the</b> <b>run</b> <b>and</b> pass to assist Darius Charles' second-half goal, Stevenage's fifth of the game. He added a second goal to his goal tally in Stevenage's League Trophy penalty loss against League Two side AFC Wimbledon — opening the scoring after seven minutes when Brett Johnson's clearance cannoned off of Wilson's leg and beat the stranded Seb Brown in the AFC Wimbledon goal. His fine form for the season continued, and he was pivotal in Stevenage's 2–1 home win against Sheffield United, assisting Mark Roberts' goal, before winning a penalty late-on, which was duly converted by Scott Laird. He also set-up Chris Beardsley's 38th-minute strike, to open the scoring, in an eventual 2–1 win against Tranmere Rovers at Broadhall Way. In the club's last game of 2011, on 31 December, Wilson scored the only goal of the game as Stevenage defeated Wycombe Wanderers 1–0 at Adams Park. The goal came in the 82nd minute of the match, with Wilson powerfully beating Nikki Bull from close-range following Luke Freeman's precise cross. He was also on hand to score two of Stevenage's five goals in a 5–1 victory against Rochdale at Spotland on 14 January 2012. Both of Wilson's goals came in the second-half; the first came shortly after the interval, when he ran onto Chris Beardsley's rolled pass to fire the ball into the net, with his second coming after he ran onto Mark Roberts' clearance to calmly beat Péter Kurucz in the Rochdale goal. Wilson scored one further goal during the campaign, scoring a diving header in injury-time in a 1–0 win over Oldham Athletic at Broadhall Way. It took Wilson's goal tally to six for the season, with the player being ever-present during the campaign under both Westley and new manager Gary Smith, playing in all 56 of the club's games, as Stevenage narrowly lost in the play-off semi-finals.|$|E
