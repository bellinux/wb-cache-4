Manager Alex Inglethorpe {{described}} him by saying [...] "He's 24 {{years of age}} and he fits the bill of the type of player <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> next season. I liken him to Tim Cahill of Everton. He likes to get forward and score goals, and has a good grounding in both League and non-League football." [...] Challinor made his debut in a 2–0 win away to Gravesend & Northfleet on 13 August 2005, before scoring his first goal on 3 September in a 2–2 away to Dagenham & Redbridge. He scored in a 4–0 win over former club Aldershot on 26 December 2005, during which he was targeted by opposition fans, after his former manager Terry Brown claimed he left Aldershot for financial reasons. After the match, Challinor said [...] "I got one over on the manager and proved him wrong, he didn't think I was good enough. Their fans were at me throughout the game but it only made me focus more." [...] He finished 2005–06 with 13 goals in 48 appearances for Exeter.|$|E

[...] "The {{worst of it}} is, he has a private telephone wire in his house to London.

60|$|Truly, I {{think the}} man who goes about pothering and uproaring for his 'happiness,'--pothering, and were it ballot-boxing, poem-making, or in what way soever fussing and exerting himself,--he is not the man <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> to 'get our knaves and dastards arrested'! No; he rather {{is on the way}} to {{increase}} the number,--by at least one unit and his tail! Observe, too, that this is all a modern affair; belongs not to the old heroic times, but to these dastard new times.

Of course I am interested principally in finding Miss Prim--her father has engaged me for that purpose; but I think the arrest of the perpetrators of any of last night's crimes will put us well along on the trail of the missing young lady, as it is almost a foregone conclusion that there is a connection between her disappearance and some of the occurrences which have so excited Oakdale. I do not mean that she was a party to any criminal act; but it is more than possible that she was abducted by the same men who later committed the other crimes." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There {{are many}} factors, certainly, that are against us," [...] conceded the statesman, [...] "but {{you must also}} take into account those <b>that</b> <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>us.</b> In most cases in recent history where the conquered have stood out against all {{attempts}} at assimilation, {{there has been a}} religious difference to add to the racial one--take Poland, for instance, and the Catholic parts of Ireland. If the Bretons ever seriously begin to assert their nationality as against the French, it will be because they have remained more Catholic in practice and sentiment than their neighbours. Here there is no such complication; we are in the bulk a Protestant nation with a Catholic minority, and the same may be said of the British. Then in modern days there is the alchemy of Sport and the Drama to bring men of different races amicably together. One or two sportsmanlike Germans in a London football team will do more to break down racial antagonism than anything that Governments or Councils can effect. As for the Stage, it has long been international in its tendencies. You can see that every day." ...|$|E
6000|$|Gradually the guineas, the crowns, and the half-crowns grew to a heap, and Marner drew {{less and}} less for his own wants, {{trying to solve the}} problem of keeping himself strong enough to work sixteen hours a-day on as small an outlay as possible. Have not men, shut up in solitary imprisonment, found an {{interest}} in marking the moments by straight strokes of a certain length on the wall, until the growth of the sum of straight strokes, arranged in triangles, has become a mastering purpose? Do we not wile away moments of inanity or fatigued waiting by repeating some trivial movement or sound, until the repetition has bred a want, which is incipient habit? <b>That</b> <b>will</b> <b>help</b> <b>us</b> to understand how the love of accumulating money grows an absorbing passion in men whose imaginations, even in the very beginning of their hoard, showed them no purpose beyond it. Marner wanted the heaps of ten to grow into a square, and then into a larger square; and every added guinea, while it was itself a satisfaction, bred a new desire. In this strange world, made a hopeless riddle to him, he might, if he had had a less intense nature, have sat weaving, weaving--looking towards the end of his pattern, or towards the end of his web, till he forgot the riddle, and everything else but his immediate sensations; but the money had come to mark off his weaving into periods, and the money not only grew, but it remained with him. He began to think it was conscious of him, as his loom was, and he would on no account have exchanged those coins, which had become his familiars, for other coins with unknown faces. He handled them, he counted them, till their form and colour were like the satisfaction of a thirst to him; but it was only in the night, when his work was done, that he drew them out to enjoy their companionship. He had taken up some bricks in his floor underneath his loom, and here he had made a hole in which he set the iron pot that contained his guineas and silver coins, covering the bricks with sand whenever he replaced them. Not that the idea of being robbed presented itself often or strongly to his mind: hoarding was common in country districts in those days; there were old labourers in the parish of Raveloe who were known to have their savings by them, probably inside their flock-beds; but their rustic neighbours, though not all of them as honest as their ancestors in the days of King Alfred, had not imaginations bold enough to lay a plan of burglary. How could they have spent the money in their own village without betraying themselves? They would be obliged to [...] "run away"--a course as dark and dubious as a balloon journey.|$|E
