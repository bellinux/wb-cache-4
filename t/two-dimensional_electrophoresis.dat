The more established and widespread method uses high resolution, <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> to separate proteins from different samples in parallel, followed by selection and staining of differentially expressed proteins {{to be identified}} by mass spectrometry. Despite the advances in 2DE and its maturity, it has its limits as well.The central concern is the inability to resolve all the proteins within a sample, given their dramatic range in expression level and differing properties.|$|E
50|$|Difference gel {{electrophoresis}} (DIGE) {{is a form}} of {{gel electrophoresis}} where up to three different protein samples can be labeled with size-matched, charge-matched spectrally resolvable fluorescent dyes (for example Cy3, Cy5, Cy2) prior to <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>electrophoresis.</b> Then, the three samples are mixed and loaded onto IEF for first dimension and the strip is transferred to a SDS PAGE. After the gel electrophoresis, the gel is scanned with the excitation wavelength of each dye one after the other, so we are able to see each sample separately (if we scan the gel at the excitation wavelength of the Cy3 dye, we will see in the gel only the sample that was labeled with that dye). This technique is used to see changes in protein abundance (for example, between a sample of a healthy person and a sample of a person with disease), post-translational modifications, truncations and any modification that might change the size or isoelectric point of proteins. The binary shifts might be left to right (change in isoelectric point), vertical (change in size) or diagonal (change in both size and isoelectric point). Reciprocal Labeling is done to make sure the changes seen are not due to dye-dependent interactions.|$|E

50|$|Restriction {{landmark}} genomic scanning (RLGS) is a {{genome analysis}} method for rapid simultaneous visualization {{of thousands of}} landmarks, or restriction sites. Using a combination of restriction enzymes {{some of which are}} specific to DNA modifications, the technique can be used to visualize differences in methylation levels across the genome of a given organism. RLGS employs direct labeling of DNA, which is first cut by a specific series of restriction enzymes, and then labeled by a radioactive isotope (usually phosphorus-32). A <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> process is then employed, yielding high-resolution results. The radioactive second-dimension gel is then allowed to expose a large sheet of film. The radiation produced by the radioactive labeling will cause the film to be exposed wherever the restriction fragments have migrated during electrophoresis. The film is then developed, yielding a visual representation of the results {{in the form of an}} autoradiograph. The same combination of restriction enzymes will produce the same pattern of 'spots' from samples from the same organisms, but different patterns for different types of organism. For example, human and mouse DNA will produce distinctly different patterns when treated with the same combination of enzymes. These finished auto-rads can be examined against each other, revealing any changes in gene expression that lead to visual differences in the film. Each autoradiograph contains thousands of spots, each corresponding to a labeled DNA restriction landmark.|$|E

Fractions containing apolipoproteins A-I + A-II and only A-I as the major protein components have been isolated from plasma and from high density lipoproteins prepared by ultracentrifugation. Similarities between the profiles of the fractions, as indicated by <b>two-dimensional</b> gel <b>electrophoresis,</b> suggested that those derived from plasma were equivalent to those from high density lipoproteins (HDL), which are particulate in nature. The established apolipoproteins (A-I, A-II, A-IV, C, D, and E) were visible and enriched in fractions from both plasma and HDL. However, plasma-derived fractions showed a much greater degree of protein heterogeneity due largely to enrichment in bands corresponding to six additional proteins.

40|$|Two {{proteins}} {{with known}} characteristics on one-dimensional gels were studied by <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> {{to compare the}} sensitivities of the two methods in detecting genetic variation. <b>Two-dimensional</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> {{was found to be}} less sensitive than several types of one-dimensional gels in distinguishing variants of both proteins.

Many more types of variation in protein sequences can be distinguished on one-dimensional gels in the absence of denaturants. The estimates of heterozygosity based on two-dimensional gels are lower than those based on other methods, at least in part, because of the limited types of sequence differences that can be detected on two-dimensional gels.
