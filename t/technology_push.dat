EIAG believes the solution lies in Government taking action to mobilise the supply chain to deliver environmental innovations. And this means moving from a focus on R&D and <b>technology</b> <b>push</b> to a focus on intelligent supply chain management.|$|E

Henderson left Washington State University to grow NewEdge full-time. The company has since expanded to locations in Seattle, San Francisco, Pittsburgh, and Chicago, with its main headquarters in Richland, Washington, and London. Three years after founding NewEdge, Henderson began contributing to the Industrial Research Institute (IRI) as an innovation subject matter expert on combining <b>technology</b> <b>push</b> and market pull.|$|E
50|$|Outside law enforcement, {{critics argue}} that smart cities {{facilitate}} a shift to e-governance platforms, often {{at the expense of}} physical interactions with citizens. While e-governance can improve service delivery and expand the ability to collect data from a single platform, such processes may be at the expense of competitiveness and based merely on a <b>technology</b> <b>push</b> for more data sources and aggregation mechanisms. As a result, the desire for increased surveillance undermines a fundamental aim of most smart cities to improve efficiency and effectiveness, as the citizens’ desire for certain ICT applications is ignored at the expense of further data aggregation. An example of this controversy has arisen in the UK, where proposals for a Scottish identity card were met with public outcry, while similar cards have been implemented in Southampton with little trouble, as many city services are provided in exchange for data collection.|$|E

30|$|Despite {{the fact}} that SDN {{utilizes}} many of the active networking projects, SDN has become more popular than its predecessors due to the various <b>technology</b> <b>pushes</b> (e.g., advances in computing and networking technology) and application pulls (e.g., datacenter and cloud services, network virtualization, etc.) and greater industrial acceptance due to certain pragmatic design choices[18]. The long-term success of SDN would require innovations in new abstractions for the control and data plane balanced with a pragmatic strategy for its deployment.|$|R
40|$|Introducing a <b>technology</b> <b>push</b> {{to stimulate}} {{entrepreneurship}} {{in remote areas}} in developing countries can be examined {{in the context of}} a franchising model (social or commercial franchising). The results of this study (fieldwork in Kalimantan, Indonesia) point to a high feasibility of introducing a <b>technology</b> <b>push</b> by a franchising model. The results indicate that the smallholder rubber farmers (community level) and the head of villages, head of district and the government departments (low, middle and high institutional level) support a <b>technology</b> <b>push</b> and are willing to participate. Furthermore almost all stakeholders prefer a franchising model to introduce a <b>technology</b> <b>push</b> with social franchising elements. Additionally, empirical evidence confirmed the main theoretical argument of this research: a <b>technology</b> <b>push</b> carried out by a franchising model can stimulate (social) entrepreneurship in remote villages. This study thus concluded that in order to stimulate (social) entrepreneurship in local communities and with that local economic development, a hybrid franchising (a combination of both commercial and social franchising) model should be used to carry a <b>technology</b> <b>push...</b>|$|E

30|$|At the {{beginning}} of an emerging technology life cycle, there is a discovery or invention that shows promise in addressing a social need or delivering a new technological capability. Emergence and early growth accelerate from this outset to maximum growth at inflection, which is shaped by the interplay of two forces: <b>technology</b> <b>push</b> (also called supply push) and market pull (also called demand pull). With <b>technology</b> <b>push,</b> producers devise and introduce new technology to the market, showcasing their ‘better mousetrap’, making a new solution available before demand is created. With market pull, consumers express unfulfilled wants and needs, urging for a better way of doing things, creating economic incentive for suppliers to provide a new solution.|$|E

40|$|There {{are several}} {{tools in the}} {{literature}} that support innovation in organizations. Some of the most cited are the so-called technology roadmapping methods, also known as TRM. However, these methods are designed primarily for organizations that adopt the market pull strategy of technology-product integration. Organizations that adopt the <b>technology</b> <b>push</b> integration strategy are neglected in the literature. Furthermore, {{with the advent of}} open innovation, it is possible to note the need to consider the adoption of partnerships in the innovation process. Thus, this study proposes a method of technology roadmapping, identified as method for <b>technology</b> <b>push</b> (MTP), applicable to organizations that adopt the <b>technology</b> <b>push</b> integration strategy, such as SMEs and independent research centers in an open-innovation environment. The method was developed through action-research and was assessed from two analytical standpoints: externally, via a specific literature review on its theoretical contributions, and internally, through the analysis of potential users` perceptions on the feasibility of applying MTP. The results indicate both the unique character of the method and its perceived implementation feasibility. Future research is suggested in order to validate the method in different types of organizations (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

30|$|Nemet (2009) {{introduced}} {{two critical}} arguments toward such supply-side perspective as follows, with summarization {{on the history}} of theoretical debates between <b>technology</b> <b>push</b> model and demand pull model in innovation study. First, supply-side theories ignore change in economic conditions such as prices, etc. that may affect the rate of return. Secondly, supply-side theories describe innovation process as a unidirectional progression and not compatible with the later Innovation System theories emphasizing feedback, interaction and network. Kline and Rosenberg, Freeman (1994), Freeman and Louca (2001) are representative of that non-linear innovation study, which have developed to the innovation system theory today. However, the network between scientists with different academic backgrounds was also important for creativity as we verified in the distributed reasoning. Given the importance of such various backgrounds, the second criticism is doubtful that the <b>technology</b> <b>push</b> model is not compatible with innovation system theory.|$|E

John Dewey’s pragmatist {{aesthetics}} {{is used as}} {{a conceptual}} basis for designing new technologies that support staff-members ’ mundane social interactions in an academic department. From this perspective, aesthetics is seen as a broader phenomenon that encompasses experiential aspects of staffmembers’ everyday lives and not only a look-&-feel aspect. 1. Aesthetics of Mundane Interactions Our everyday activities and interactions in public and private settings often involve use of several heterogeneous media (physical and digital). We adapt, appropriate and even combine these different media to support our activities. The personal and ubiquitous <b>technology</b> <b>push</b> has made interactive products so ‘unremarkable ’ that these products are gradually becoming a part of our everyday mundane lives. In other words, it would not be an exaggeration to say that ubiquitous <b>technology</b> <b>push</b> intentionally makes interactive technology a part of our mundane lives.
