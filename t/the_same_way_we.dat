I was the fall guy, the player who carried the ACB flag all summer against all the odds. I had to cop it sweet then, and I had to cop my dismissal <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way...</b> <b>We</b> were lambs to the slaughter anyway. Besides or own cricketing shortcomings, we were forced o play on wickets that suited the Englishmen and were alien to us; we copped the bad end of umpiring decisions to a damning degree throughout the Ashes series and we were crucified by media in many quarters from beginning to end. All this, combined with the talented opposition which was expected to whitewash us anyway, was just too much. The hurt that remains is that I tried so hard, {{and so did the}} young, raw team that took on so much despite all the ods. My name is now eternally entrenched in the cords books as the man who led this country to that ignominious hiding against England.|$|E

The replacement of the expression [...] "cultivated plant" [...] with the word [...] "cultigen" [...] is not universally accepted.

Is it appropriate to call the highly modified transgenic products of human artificial selection [...] "taxa" [...] in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> do for the products of natural selection in the wild? To overcome this difficulty the term culton (pl. culta) has been suggested to replace the word taxon when speaking about cultigens.|$|E

Jockey and sports analyst Gary Stevens noted prior to the Belmont, [...] "I haven't heard Thoroughbred horse racing mentioned on CNN for a long time, and it was {{right at the top}} of the hour... He's brought us mainstream again for the first time in a lot of years." [...] Post-Belmont press analysis contended that California Chrome was the most popular Thoroughbred in America since Zenyatta. In December, when the horse was selected as the winner of the Secretariat Vox Populi Award, Coburn said, [...] "We have always said Chrome is the 'People's Horse' and we are thrilled that the public feels <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> do about him." [...] In announcing the Moment of the Year, Keith Chamblin of NTRA stated, [...] "the fans reminded us that nothing trumps an awesome performance by a legendary horse."

She seems to be a very strong personality, someone who really believes in herself and has worked very hard to get where she is. She's very competitive but does have a sense of self, so she doesn't need to win all the time." [...] At Torres' initial appearance on the show, she was disliked by fans, due to her {{getting in the way of}} O'Malley and Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo)'s relationship. When asked of this, Ramirez said: [...] "You do run across a lot of people who are extremely invested in that story line. Obviously, I've heard some negative stuff." [...] The end of the show's fourth season saw Torres grow closer to cardiothoracic surgeon Erica Hahn, in a relationship referred to by the portmanteau [...] "Eri-Cal" [...] and later [...] "Callica" [...] by Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly.

2500|$|Unlike the {{founding}} farther of criminology, Cesare Lombroso, {{who thought that}} crime was fundamentally biological in its origin and criminals lacked free will altogether, contemporary neurocriminologists seem to take the middle ground approach. They do not argue that biological factors alone cause behavioral problems, but recognize that behavior results from interaction between biology and environment. Some authors, however, are more determinist in their views. As one author writes: [...] "Free will may exist (it may simply be beyond our current science), but one thing seems clear: if free will does exist, it has little room in which to operate. It can at best be a small factor riding on top of vast neural networks shaped by genes and environment. In fact, free will may end up being so small that we eventually think about bad decision-making in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>we</b> think about any physical process, such as diabetes or lung disease." ...|$|E

At the time, statistical analyst Bill James projected career statistics of 480 homers and a [...]311 lifetime average. Then-manager Gene Lamont was laudatory of Thomas' skills: [...] "I've only seen him two years now, but I'm convinced that there isn't a pitch he can't hit."

2500|$|The {{answer is}} that {{nonlinearity}} enters because the Laplace-Beltrami operator depends upon the same function p which we used to define the metric. [...] But notice that the flat Euclidean plane is given by taking [...] [...] So if [...] is small in magnitude, we can consider it to define small deviations from the geometry of a flat plane, and if we retain only first order terms in computing the exponential, the Ricci flow on our two-dimensional almost flat Riemannian manifold becomes the usual two dimensional heat equation. [...] This computation suggests that, just as (according to the heat equation) an irregular temperature distribution in a hot plate tends to become more homogeneous over time, so too (according to the Ricci flow) an almost flat Riemannian manifold will tend to flatten out {{the same way that}} heat can be carried off [...] "to infinity" [...] in an infinite flat plate. [...] But if our hot plate is finite in size, and has no boundary where heat can be carried off, we can expect to homogenize the temperature, but clearly we cannot expect to reduce it to zero. [...] In <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way,</b> <b>we</b> expect that the Ricci flow, applied to a distorted round sphere, will tend to round out the geometry over time, but not {{to turn it into a}} flat Euclidean geometry.|$|E
