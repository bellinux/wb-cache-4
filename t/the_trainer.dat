5|$|A single {{prototype}} of the two-seat trainer was the first aircraft of the first production batch built by Factory No. 31 {{in the fall of}} 1946. The prototype did not begin manufacturer's flight testing until 5 April 1947, even though the primary differences from the single-seat version were limited to a redesigned forward fuselage that accommodated an additional cockpit for the trainee where the armament used to be and a sideways-opening, canopy. <b>The</b> <b>trainer</b> was initially designated as the Yak-Jumo vyvoznoy, but it was eventually designated as the Yak-21 although some documents refer to it as the Yak-15V, Yak-15UT or Yak-21V. Further work on <b>the</b> <b>trainer</b> was cancelled with the success of <b>the</b> <b>trainer</b> version of the Yak-17 with its tricycle undercarriage.|$|E

50|$|Week 13: Train <b>the</b> <b>Trainers</b> Challenge - For one hour, the {{remaining}} contestants got {{the opportunity to}} train <b>the</b> <b>trainers</b> (first for <b>the</b> Commando and Tiffiny). After their training session, the contestants made a challenge for <b>the</b> <b>trainers</b> to determine who <b>the</b> fittest <b>trainer.</b> In round 1, <b>the</b> <b>trainers</b> {{had to do a}} 100m sack race and Michelle was last and eliminated (due to the fact she had to do cross trainers and treadmills). In the second round, it was a 100m egg and spoon race. Shannan's hand was shaking before the race even began and it cost him a place in the final round. The Commando ate his egg (including the shell). In <b>the</b> final round, <b>trainers</b> had gone around the pole 25 times and run 100m.

Brawl, Charizard is playable, under the command of the Pokémon Trainer. <b>The</b> <b>Trainer</b> has a Squirtle and an Ivysaur, all three of which can be switched between; unlike the other fighters, these Pokémon become fatigued and consequently weaker, and must be switched out long enough to recover. Charizard's moves include Rock Smash, Flamethrower, and Fly. Charizard is playable as a stand-alone character in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U, where he gains the move Flare Blitz and his new Final Smash is transforming into Mega Charizard X. Charizard also appears as a playable fighter in Pokkén Tournament.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} State {{acceptance}} trials were completed, the Council of Ministers ordered the aircraft into production in December 1946. 50 aircraft {{were to be}} built between January and April 1947, equally split between single-seat aircraft and two-seat trainers, armed with only a single cannon. <b>The</b> <b>trainer</b> ran into serious development difficulties and all the aircraft of the first batch were single-seaters. Fifty of these participated in the May Day flypast in Moscow in 1947. A total of 280 Yak-15s were produced {{through the end of}} the year, exclusive of prototypes. The aircraft were distributed in small numbers to fighter aviation regiments based in the USSR, Poland, Romania, Hungary, and Manchuria for use as conversion trainers. The aircraft's manoeuvrability led it to be used by a number of informal acrobatic display teams throughout the late 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{pages were}} filmed per day, {{six days a}} week, with three shows {{completed}} per week. Shooting in order was not possible. Several barn segments might be filmed {{at a particular time}} with the crew then moving on to film an equal number of kitchen scenes. The shots may have then been used in four or five different episodes. Rettig was allowed to bond with the dog and often groomed the dog at the studio or spent weekends at Weatherwax's home playing with the animal. The bond translated to film, making the boy and dog scenes more believable, but, eventually the dog developed divided loyalties (looking to Rettig for direction rather than Weatherwax) and <b>the</b> <b>trainer</b> was forced to curtail the amount of time boy and dog spent together.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: From September 1996, all GP registrars {{completing}} {{vocational training}} in the United Kingdom must demonstrate competence {{by means of a}} four-part assessment procedure. AIM: To look at the accuracy of one of the components of vocational training: <b>the</b> <b>trainer's</b> report. METHOD: Seventy-five registrars completing their general practice training at the end of July 1997 were invited {{to take part in a}} practical skills workshop. Eight stations were designed to test practical skills and diagnostic interpretations that were included in <b>the</b> <b>trainer's</b> report, and a clinical vignette accompanied each task. The marking schedule used was developed from the minimum standards required in <b>the</b> <b>trainer's</b> report. Twenty-nine registrars (38 %) took part in the workshop. RESULTS: Only one registrar passed all eight stations. The maximum number of stations failed by any one individual was five and this doctor was the only one of the sample to ultimately fail summative assessment. The majority of registrars failed by being unable to interpret clinical findings. Twenty-five registrars (86 %) responded to the follow-up questionnaire. Of these, only six felt that the stations were unrealistic. All but two registrars had spent at least six months in their hospital training doing obstetrics and gynaecology but, in spite of this, only 31 % of registrars were above minimum competence for vaginal and speculum examination. CONCLUSION: With one exception, registrars passed all aspects of <b>the</b> <b>trainer's</b> report. Discrepancy was found between <b>the</b> <b>trainer's</b> report and <b>the</b> doctor's ability to carry out clinical procedures. There is an assumption that many of these clinical skills are being taught and assessed at undergraduate level and during the hospital component, but this cannot be taken for granted. Doubt must also be cast on whether <b>the</b> <b>trainers</b> are using <b>the</b> <b>trainer's</b> report appropriately, and whether this is a valid and reliable tool to identify skills deficient in registrars for summative assessment...|$|R
5|$|Knightly Dawn {{was entered}} into the race on June 6 and was thought to bring early speed to the race and alter the way it would be run. Before Knightly Dawn's entry, Secretariat was speculated to lead from the race's start. With the {{presence}} of Knightly Dawn, William Bonifice believed that Secretariat would have to run faster earlier on, thus making the final half-mile more unpredictable. Pancho Martin, <b>the</b> <b>trainer</b> of Knightly Dawn, said he would only run the horse if it rained as Knightly Dawn's only previous success {{had been in the}} Jersey Derby on a sloppy track. However, Knightly Dawn was scratched prior to race day. The horse's scratch also reduced the winner's share from $150,200 to $90,120.|$|E
5|$|Paradox was a strongly-built {{bay horse}} bred by the Graham {{brothers}} at the Yardley Stud near Birmingham. He was sired by the 2,000 Guineas runner-up Sterling out of Casuistry, an undistinguished racehorse {{who had been}} sold cheaply {{at the end of}} her racing career by Lord Rosebery. Casuistry became an important broodmare, being the direct female ancestor of notable thoroughbreds such as Humorist, Royal Palace and Spend a Buck. As a yearling Paradox was bought for 700 guineas by <b>the</b> <b>trainer</b> John Porter on behalf of his associate, Captain Bowling. Porter trained the colt at his stable at Kingsclere.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>trainer</b> {{version of}} the AV-8B is the TAV-8B, seating two pilots in tandem. Among other changes, the forward {{fuselage}} features a 3ft 11in (1.19m) extension to accommodate the second cockpit. To compensate for the slight loss of directional stability, the vertical stabilizer's area was enlarged through increases in chord (length of the stabilizer's root) and height. USMC TAV-8Bs feature the AV-8B's digital cockpit and new systems, but have only two hardpoints and are not combat capable. Initial TAV-8Bs were powered by a 21,450lbf (95.4kN) F402-RR-406A engine, while later examples were fitted with the 23,000lbf (105.8kN) F402-RR-408A. In the early 2000s, 17 TAV-8Bs were upgraded to include a night-attack capability, the F402-RR-408 engine, and software and structural changes.|$|E
