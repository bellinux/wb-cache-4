5|$|At the ten-minute mark, Sinden {{noticed that}} the Soviets had changed <b>their</b> <b>style,</b> playing defence to protect the lead, rather than pressing.

5|$|During this period, Roman {{soldiers}} seem to {{have been}} modelled after those of the Etruscans to the north, who themselves are believed to have copied <b>their</b> <b>style</b> of warfare from the Greeks. Traditionally, the introduction of the phalanx formation into the Roman army is ascribed to the city's penultimate king, Servius Tullius (ruled 578 to 534 BC). According to Livy and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, the front rank was composed of the wealthiest citizens, who were able to purchase the best equipment. Each subsequent rank consisted of those with less wealth and poorer equipment than the one before it.|$|E

5|$|In {{the band}}'s fourth album, 2011's The Here and Now, the band {{set out to}} mix their typical sounds with the music they were {{listening}} to at the time. The response was polarising. During the publicity for The Here and Now, the band praised it as a progression for them; {{they did not want}} to reject an album they had just released. But their own lack of belief in the record and their growing concern that they were irrelevant started to severely affect the band's confidence in themselves and <b>their</b> <b>style.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Barbadian calypso grew in {{popularity}} and stature, led by Viper, Mighty Gabby and The Merrymen. The first calypso competitions {{were held in}} 1960, and they quickly grew larger and more prominent. The Merrymen became the island's most prominent contribution to calypso by the 1970s and into the 80s. <b>Their</b> <b>style,</b> known as blue beat, incorporated Barbadian folk songs and ballads, as well as American blues, country music, and a distinctive sound created by harmonica, guitar and banjo.|$|E

The English dominated from the start but the French put up a good fight, as both the English and French press reported. The French forwards were compared in <b>their</b> <b>style</b> of play with those of Ireland, with good footballing skills. Although the English won a fourth successive victory, 22–0, it seemed as though the French game was beginning to develop.|$|E

5|$|Jay Farrar, Jeff Tweedy and Mike Heidorn {{began their}} musical {{careers in the}} 1980s playing in a garage band, The Plebes. After a few gigs, {{creative}} differences between the members {{led to the development}} of a punk rock sound for the band. As punk rock was unpopular in the St. Louis region, the band changed <b>their</b> <b>style</b> to blues-rock and renamed themselves Uncle Tupelo. At this point, they stopped performing covers and began to write their own songs.|$|E
5|$|Post-punk brought {{together}} a new fraternity of musicians, journalists, managers, and entrepreneurs; the latter, notably Geoff Travis of Rough Trade and Tony Wilson of Factory, helped {{to develop the}} production and distribution infrastructure of the indie music scene that blossomed in the mid-1980s. Smoothing the edges of <b>their</b> <b>style</b> {{in the direction of}} new wave, several post-punk bands such as New Order (descended from Joy Division) and the Cure. crossed over to a mainstream U.S. audience.

Others, like Gang of Four, the Raincoats and Throbbing Gristle, who had little more than cult followings at the time, are seen in retrospect as significant influences on modern popular culture.|$|E
5|$|Storylines often {{centred on}} new signings who {{were unable to}} settle easily in the Melchester team, either because they refused to change <b>their</b> <b>style</b> of play and {{expected}} the Rovers to play around them, such as the uncomprisingly tough defender Duncan McKay, or had personal characteristics that {{made it difficult for}} the other players to accept them, such as ex-circus ball juggler Sammy Spangler. As the average reader probably stayed with the comic for only three or four years, many storylines were recycled. For instance, during the first ten years of his playing career Roy was kidnapped at least five times.|$|E

5|$|The Antonine Wall and its {{associated}} forts left a direct sculptural legacy in Scotland. There are 19 distance slabs along the wall that depict graphically the victories and marches of the legions involved in its construction. There are also surviving sculptures, including an altar to Diana and Apollo. There is a fountainhead from a bath-house {{in the shape of}} a man's head with a gaping mouth, and the head from a bust or statue, perhaps the goddess Fortuna, both found at Bearsden Roman Fort, East Dunbartonshire, both showing a local Celtic influence in <b>their</b> <b>style.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Mongols {{attacked}} the Dalmatian cities {{for the next}} few years but eventually withdrew without major success, as the mountainous terrain and distance were not suitable for <b>their</b> <b>style</b> of warfare. They pursued Béla IV from town to town in Dalmatia. The Croatian nobility and Dalmatian towns such as Trogir and Rab helped Béla IV to escape. After this failure, the Mongols retreated and Béla IV rewarded the Croatian towns and nobility. Only the city of Split did not help Béla IV in his escape.|$|E

Above each set of doors was a single large window. In the 1973 renovation, two red brick wings {{were added to the}} east and west sides of the building to accommodate numerous dining rooms. Featuring large windows, the new wings were more modern in <b>their</b> <b>style</b> than the old central portion of the building.|$|E
