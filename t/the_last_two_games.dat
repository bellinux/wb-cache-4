5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} five games, the absence of Adrian Peterson did not keep the Sooners from running {{the ball on the}} ground. Allen Patrick returned from missing <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> with a sore ankle and put up 163yards on 23carries, including a 65-yard touchdown scamper to start the second half. Chris Brown had an additional 19carries for 74yards and two touchdowns as Patrick's backup. At the end of the day, Paul Thompson only threw 11passes, 7completions for 77yards with one touchdown and no interceptions, and Oklahoma had 238yards of rushing.|$|E
5|$|The team's strong stretch did not continue, however, as the Phillies {{entered the}} second period of interleague play with five {{consecutive}} series against the American League East. While they managed a single win against the Boston Red Sox, {{it was followed by}} a six-game losing streak wherein the Phillies were swept by the Toronto Blue Jays and the Baltimore Orioles; Philadelphia was outscored 38–19 over the two series. The team showed promise in the first game of their World Series rematch series with the Tampa Bay Rays, winning 10–1, but were defeated in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> of the series and lost a fourth straight game to Toronto on June 26. However, the Phillies were able to exact a modicum of revenge for both their 1993 World Series defeat and the first series sweep by the Jays by winning <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>games.</b> Happ played the role of stopper by pitching his first career complete game shutout, and Moyer followed by earning his 252nd victory in the following game. To close the month, the Phillies lost the opener of their next series with the Braves to finish the month with a 10–16 record.|$|E

5|$|These successes {{established}} Steinitz {{as one of}} the world's top players, and he {{was able}} to arrange a match in 1866 in London against Adolf Anderssen, who was regarded as the world's strongest active player because he had won the 1851 and 1862 London International Tournaments and his one superior, Paul Morphy, had retired from competitive chess. Steinitz won with eight wins and six losses (there were no draws), but it was a hard fight; after 12 games the scores were level at 6–6, then Steinitz won <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>games.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Serie A in the 2007–08 season, Juventus appointed Claudio Ranieri as manager. They finished {{in third place}} in their first season back in the top flight and qualified for the Champions League third qualifying round in the preliminary stages. Juventus reached the group stages, where they beat Real Madrid in both home and away legs, before losing in the knockout round to Chelsea. Ranieri was sacked following a string of unsuccessful results and Ciro Ferrara was appointed as manager on a temporary basis for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> of the 2008–09 season, before being subsequently appointed as the manager for the 2009–10 season.|$|E
5|$|Back in England for the 1929 season, Larwood {{made three}} Test {{appearances}} against the visiting South Africans, for modest returns: {{a total of}} eight wickets at 23.25, and with the bat 50 runs at 12.50. He was injured during the third Test, and thus missed <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> of the series and several county matches. His overall bowling figures for the 1929 season were less impressive than in the two previous years; with 117 wickets at 21.66 he fell to 25th place in the national averages. The 20-year-old Voce, whose fast-medium bowling style had now fully developed, was the county's most successful bowler. Together, Larwood and Voce helped Nottingham to secure the County Championship that had narrowly evaded them two years earlier.|$|E

5|$|Defensively, the Virginia Tech Hokies {{allowed an}} average of 308 yards per game and 18.4 points per game. During <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> of the regular season, however, the Hokies {{permitted}} 34 points and 42 points to Rutgers and Virginia, respectively. The Virginia Tech defense was led by two strong performers in the defensive secondary. Safety Torrian Gray intercepted four passes during the regular season, returning one of the catches for a touchdown. He tied with cornerback William Yarborough for the most interceptions on the team during the regular season. Neither player was the team's leading tackler, however. That honor went to linebacker George DelRicco, who had 130 tackles during the regular season.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> of {{the regular}} season, however, the Hokies managed two victories: a 14–3 win against last-place ACC team Duke, and a 17–14 triumph over {{traditional}} rival Virginia.

These losses dropped Miami to a 4–4 record in the ACC, one game behind the Hokies, who were tied with Georgia Tech at 5–3 following the end {{of the regular}} season. By virtue of the Hokies' head-to-head win against the Yellow Jackets, Virginia Tech won the Coastal Division and a spot in the ACC Championship Game. When Tech won the championship game against Atlantic Division champion Boston College, 30–12, it was awarded the ACC's automatic bid to the Orange Bowl.|$|E

Penicillin and sulphonamides were still experimental treatments at this time; peritonitis was usually a fatal condition. On 25 September, the hospital issued a statement that Bradman was struggling for his life and that blood donors were needed urgently.|$|E

5|$|The {{rivalry between}} the teams is deeply {{embedded}} in British football hooliganism lore and culture, and has been depicted in films that focused specifically on the animosity between the clubs' two hooligan firms, the Inter City Firm and the Millwall Bushwackers.

Most recently in the 2009 Upton Park riot, widespread disorder between supporters in and around West Ham's Upton Park ground led to numerous injuries and a Millwall fan being stabbed before the match began. In <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> between the sides in the 2011–12 season, the Metropolitan Police implemented London-wide operations to ensure the games were trouble-free.|$|E
5|$|As time passed, the {{releases}} of new CD-based consoles {{such as the}} 3DO Interactive Multiplayer rendered the Sega CD technically obsolete, reducing public interest in the add-on. In late 1993, {{less than a year}} after the system's launches in North America and Europe, the gaming media reported that Sega was no longer accepting in-house development proposals for the Mega-CD in Japan. In early 1995, Sega shifted its focus to the Sega Saturn and discontinued all advertising for Genesis hardware, including the Sega CD. Sega officially discontinued the add-on in the first quarter of 1996, saying that it needed to concentrate on fewer platforms and felt the Sega CD could not compete in the current marketplace due to its high price tag and outdated single-speed drive. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>two</b> <b>games</b> scheduled to be released for the Sega CD, Myst and Brain Dead 13, were subsequently cancelled. 2.24 million Sega CD units were sold worldwide, including 400,000 in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Barea {{continued}} {{playing in}} the backup position at the 2008 Centrobasket tournament. He entered the final round leading the event in points, after scoring 31 and 30 points against Panama and the Dominican Republic.

Following this game, Barea received the event's Most Valuable Player award. In 2009, the Mavericks didn't give Barea permission to play in the FIBA Americas Championship. This decision was {{based on the fact that}} the player had undergone surgery on his left shoulder during the post-season. Barea returned to international play at the 2010 Centrobasket, serving as the national team's starting point guard, Arroyo was in turn reassigned to the regular shooting guard position. Puerto Rico won its group, defeating Panama in semifinals and the Dominican Republic in the final to win the gold medal. Barea had averages of 13.8 points per game and led CentroBasket in assists per game with 7.0, earning him inclusion in the tournament's All-Star Team.|$|E

Trailing by a score of 5–2 with 10 minutes to play in the third period of Game 6, the Blues mounted a furious comeback to send the contest into overtime, where Doug Wickenheiser scored to force a deciding seventh game. Calgary would win Game 7 at home, 2–1, advancing into the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time. The Flames proved to be no match for the Montreal Canadiens, losing the championship series in five games.
