25|$|Changing {{times and}} the rise of {{television}} saw Mondt's influence in the sport diminishing. Mondt was an arena booker and was never able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> on television like McMahon. That fact coupled with Mondt's gambling problems allowed his business-minded partner to muscle him out of ownership of the New York territory. Toots sold off his share to McMahon in the mid-60s. McMahon reduced Mondt to salaried employee for Capital. Mondt died nearly penniless on June 11, 1976 at the age of 82 after a long battle with an illness. Since then, he has been inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame in 1996, the Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum in 2008 and the WWE Hall of Fame in 2017 as a recipient of its Legacy Award.|$|E
500|$|Johnny Depp as Ed Wood: Burton {{approached}} Depp and [...] "within 10 {{minutes of}} hearing about the project, I was committed," [...] the actor remembers. At the time, Depp was depressed about films and filmmaking. By accepting this part, {{it gave him a}} [...] "chance to stretch out and have some fun", and working with Martin Landau, [...] "rejuvenated my love for acting". Depp was already familiar with some of Wood's films through John Waters, who had shown him Plan 9 from Outer Space and Glen or Glenda. <b>To</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> on how to portray Wood, Depp studied the performance of Jack Haley as the Tin Man in The Wizard of Oz, and the acting of Mickey Rooney, Ronald Reagan and Casey Kasem. He watched several Reagan speeches because the actor felt that [...] "he had a kind of blind optimism that was perfect for Ed Wood." [...] Depp also borrowed some of Kasem's cadence and [...] "that utterly confident, breezy salesman quality in his voice".|$|E
500|$|Writing in Time, Richard Schickel said, [...] "I'm {{not going}} to argue that Valkyrie is a great movie. But in its way it is a {{thoughtful}} and entertaining one, especially {{in comparison with the}} pomp and pretentiousness of most of the competition this holiday season." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe described the film: [...] "It's a smooth, compelling, almost suspenseful ... and slightly hollow Hollywood period piece—a World War II action-drama in which an intriguing (but not electrifying) star performance is buttressed by stellar support." [...] Burr analyzed Cruise's performance: [...] "... his Claus von Stauffenberg is an honorable conception that's ultimately too thin to fully rise up from the pages of history. This story deserves to be told, but for reasons best known to himself, the star has latched onto a strictly Nietzschean interpretation that he rides into the ground." [...] Claudia Puig of USA Today thought of Cruise as [...] "unconvincing and stiff as the disenchanted" [...] von Stauffenberg. She felt that the film started slowly and that [...] "even during scenes of intense action, the visually slick production is only minimally engrossing". She concluded of the film's overall pace, [...] "The action becomes more engrossing during the film's second half, but one expects more depth and nuance, given its pedigree." [...] Anthony Lane of The New Yorker wrote, [...] " [...] carries the movie, although, once you dig beneath the uniform, there isn’t much for him <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> on; the fascination with Stauffenberg resides in what he did, not in who he was." [...] Lane thought that there was [...] "too much" [...] character acting of the British veteran actors and felt of the casting of Nighy, Stamp, and Wilkinson, [...] "These men are meant to be battle-toughened Nazi officers, but what we get is an array of discreetly amusing studies in mild neurosis." ...|$|E

Hayley Erin found it easy <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> on the character describing Kiki as being [...] "so relatable."

5000|$|In the mid-season finale, [...] "Dual", he injects {{himself with}} a power {{granting}} formula and gains a new, more limited mimicry ability called ability replication. He is once again able to mimic others' powers, but now he requires physical contact to do so, and can only retain one ability at a time, losing the previous power each time he gains a new one. Heroes producers Joe Pokaski and Aron Coliete {{said in an interview}} that, [...] "Peter is still trying <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>handle</b> on his powers.

500|$|A {{number of}} {{commentators}} were {{critical of the}} choice of setting. Though Lawrence claimed that it [...] "illustrated how good Pemberton and Shearsmith are at creating maximum tension on a minimal budget", others found that it interfered with their enjoyment of the episode.
