These losses later were attributed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> factors, including adverse weather, intensive apiculture leading to inadequate forage, and a new infection, the chronic bee paralysis virus, but at the time, the cause of this agricultural beekeeping problem was similarly mysterious and unknown.|$|E

Many indigenous birds have disappeared or become rare owing to destruction of their habitat. There are about 60recorded vascular plant species native to the island, none of which are endemic. Coconut farming, mining, and introduced species have caused serious disturbance to the native vegetation.|$|E

5|$|After {{attaining}} peak intensity, Hurricane Ramon {{began to}} weaken. Late on October10, Ramon weakened slightly while turning northwest. The following morning, the storm reportedly weakened into a Category 2. Hurricane Ramon began to rapidly deteriorate due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> jetstream interactions and increasingly cold sea-surface temperatures. At 0600UTC on October11, {{the storm was}} downgraded into a Category1 on the SSHWS after bypassing the Category2 stage. It weakened into a tropical storm later that day and was further downgraded to a tropical depression on October12. Tropical Depression Ramon dissipated on 0600UTC that day. The remnant moisture of this hurricane later moved into Southern California, resulting in record rains.|$|E
