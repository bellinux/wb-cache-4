5|$|During the A320 {{development}} programme, Airbus considered propfan technology, {{backed by}} Lufthansa. At the time unproven, it {{was essentially a}} fan placed outside the engine nacelle, offering speed of a turbofan at <b>turboprops</b> economics; eventually, Airbus stuck with turbofans.|$|E
5|$|On 5 June 1946, Boeing's Model 462, a straight-wing {{aircraft}} {{powered by}} six Wright T35 <b>turboprops</b> with a gross weight of 360,000pounds (160,000kg) and a combat radius of 3,110miles (2,700nmi, 5,010km), was declared the winner. On 28 June 1946, Boeing was issued {{a letter of}} contract for US$1.7million to build a full-scale mock-up of the new XB-52 and do preliminary engineering and testing. However, by October 1946, the air force began to express concern about {{the sheer size of}} the new aircraft and its inability to meet the specified design requirements. In response, Boeing produced Model 464, a smaller four-engine version with a 230,000pound (105,000kg) gross weight, which was briefly deemed acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1960 as Grønlandsfly, {{the airline}} started its first {{services}} with Catalina water planes {{and within the}} decade expanded to include DHC-3 Otters as well as Sikorsky S-61 helicopters, some of which remain in active service. The majority of operations were based on helicopters until the newly established Greenland Home Rule began investing in a network of short takeoff and landing airfields. These were very expensive to construct and Greenland's airport fees are still {{among the highest in}} the world; they also required a new fleet: DHC-7 <b>turboprops</b> uniquely suited to the harsh terrain and weather conditions in Greenland. The reliability of connections improved as the domestic airport network expanded in the 1990s: increasing use of the Dash 7s made the airline less restricted by inclement weather. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, Air Greenland acquired a Boeing 757 and an Airbus A330, allowing it to open connections to Copenhagen, until then operated by SAS which also competed mid to late 2000s. In the 21st century, it competes with Air Iceland for international connections and small charter services domestically.|$|E

5|$|In May 1948, AMC asked Boeing to {{incorporate}} the previously discarded, but now more fuel-efficient, jet engine into the design. That resulted {{in the development of}} yet another revision—in July 1948, Model 464-40 substituted Westinghouse J40 turbojets for the <b>turboprops.</b> The Air Force project officer who reviewed the Model 464-40 was favorably impressed, especially since he had already been thinking along similar lines. Nevertheless, the government was concerned about the high fuel consumption rate of the jet engines of the day, and directed that Boeing still use the turboprop-powered Model 464-35 {{as the basis for the}} XB-52. Although he agreed that turbojet propulsion was the future, General Howard A. Craig, Deputy Chief of Staff for Material, was not very keen on a jet-powered B-52, since he felt that the jet engine had not yet progressed sufficiently to permit skipping an intermediate turboprop stage. However, Boeing was encouraged to continue turbojet studies even without any expected commitment to jet propulsion.|$|E

The advantages of <b>turboprop</b> engines over pistons was in power-to-weight ratio and the maximum power that could be generated practically.

40|$|A {{laboratory}} experiment {{was conducted to}} quantify the annoyance of people to the flyover noise of advanced <b>turboprop</b> aircraft with counter-rotating propellers (CRP) having {{an equal number of}} blades on each rotor.

A computer synthesis system was used to generate 27 realistic, time-varying simulations of advanced <b>turboprop</b> takeoff noise in which the tonal content was systematically varied to represent the factorial combinations of nine fundamental frequencies and three tone-to-broadband noise ratios. These advanced <b>turboprop</b> simulations along with recordings of five conventional <b>turboprop</b> takeoffs and five conventional jet takeoffs were presented at three D-weighted sound pressure levels to 64 subjects in an anechoic chamber.

The annoyance prediction ability of various noise metrics is also examined...|$|R
