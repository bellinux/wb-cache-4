25|$|It is {{customary}} to {{turn off}} the lights and conduct the search by candlelight, using a feather and a wooden spoon: candlelight effectively illuminates corners without casting shadows; the feather can dust crumbs out of their hiding places; and the wooden spoon which collects <b>the</b> <b>crumbs</b> can be burned the next day with the chametz. However, most contemporary Jewish-Orthodox authorities permit using a flashlight, while some strongly encourage it due to the danger coupled with using a candle.|$|E

While promoting the song, she later performed it at the Nomination Concert for the 51st Grammy Awards, where she coupled it in a medley with a cover of Brenda Lee's [...] "I'm Sorry", and the AOL Sessions. Since, Swift has performed the track at the Studio 330 Sessions, the 2009 CMA Music Festival, the 2009 V Festival, and on Dancing with the Stars. Swift performed [...] "White Horse" [...] on all venues in 2009 and 2010 of her first headlining concert tour, the Fearless Tour. During the performances, Swift wore a pastel sundress as performed solely playing an acoustic guitar, {{standing at the edge}} of the stage's runway. In the concert on May 22, 2009, at Staples Center in Los Angeles, California, Swift sang [...] "White Horse" [...] in duet with American singer John Mayer. Reviewing the June 2, 2010 concert at Verizon Center in Washington, D.C., Dave McKenna of The Washington Post reported, [...] "On 'White Horse,' the chorus of believers also joined in, and threw their young fists in the air to yell Swift's esteem-free but cathartic climax, 'I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well!'" [...] Swift said in a 2012 interview with Cosmopolitan that White Horse is in fact her favorite song to sing live, [...] "a song that I've always been proud of because it's about that really horrible feeling of a one-sided relationship that isn't balanced; it's one-sided. You clearly love him more than he loves you, and you know it. And it's a sinking feeling, but it's also a really intoxicating feeling. And a lot of times girls will end up in these relationships where he's not giving you anything so you'll take <b>the</b> <b>crumbs.</b> In my mind what hurts the most is what they didn't say. It's when they knew I needed to hear something and they wouldn't just say it. They knew I needed commitment or loyalty or reassurance, and they wouldn't give it." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Crumbs from Your Table" [...] {{is about}} the {{relationship}} between Western countries and developing countries. The verses and chorus address the relationship from the perspective of citizens from the developing world, focusing on the disparity between the long-term socioeconomic planning stressed by the West ("You speak in signs and wonders") and the developing world's immediate need for sustenance ("But I'm begging for <b>the</b> <b>crumbs</b> from your table"). One line ("You speak in signs and wonders") was meant as a criticism of the Catholic Church. The bridge ("Where you live should not decide / Whether you live or whether you die") is statement from Bono that follows with the theme in his speeches in which he tries to raise awareness about African poverty. Bono stated on a bonus DVD included with special editions of the album that the band has no recollection of writing the song, as they were intoxicated at the time. A studio performance is also included on the aforementioned bonus DVD. It was only played a handful on times during the third leg of the Vertigo Tour.|$|E

In this study, the impact was characterized using wheat bread stored at - 18 degrees C for a long term of similar to 4 months. The frozen bread incurred a considerable loss of <b>the</b> <b>crumb</b> water that migrated out and formed ice crystals on the bread surface. Such a moisture decrease underwent more rapidly for the bread stored without intact crust, suggesting the specific role of crust during frozen storage. Moisture also redistributed significantly within <b>the</b> frozen <b>crumb,</b> resulting in an elevated crumb heterogeneity of freezable water.

Test samples were produced with a 50 / 70 penetration grade straight asphalt and a crumb rubber obtained by the grinding process which basically consists in a tearing and crushing the old tires at ambient temperature. The digestion time was 60 minutes and the digestion temperature was 170 ºC. The results show that the rotational viscosity and the resilience are the properties most affected by <b>the</b> <b>crumb</b> rubber. It was also observed that the increase of <b>the</b> <b>crumb</b> rubber specific surface (fine crumb rubber) produces asphalt rubber with higher viscosity and lower resilience.

40|$|The {{effect of}} Brea Gum (BG) {{addition}} on a basic bread formulation is described. The {{aim of the}} study was to investigate the effect of BG on the characteristics of wheat bread in terms of changes in moisture, texture, retrogradation of amylopectin, and microstructure. Bread quality was assessed by the physical parameters (volume, specific volume index, width/height ratio, crumb moisture, color, and hardness) and crumb grain structure (total cell number, total cell area, average size of cells, and number of cells per unit area). The effect of BG on the characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>crumb</b> during 24, 48, and 72 hours of storage was determined according to changes in moisture, hardness, and amylopectin retrogradation. Furthermore, the microstructure of <b>the</b> <b>crumb</b> was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results show the ability of BG to retain moisture in <b>the</b> bread <b>crumb,</b> which was expressed by the lower hardness of <b>the</b> bread <b>crumbs</b> with <b>the</b> addition of the hydrocolloid at 48 and 72 hours of storage.

40|$|Crispness {{of bread}} is rapidly lost because of water {{migration}} inside <b>the</b> <b>crumb</b> towards <b>the</b> crust. How <b>crumb</b> properties determine this process independent of crust properties {{has not been}} examined before. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to analyze and explain <b>the</b> influence of <b>crumb</b> morphology on <b>the</b> overall crispness retention. Crispness retention was determined by analyzing the acoustic emission of breads differing in either crust or crumb morphology. When crumb morphology is coarse with a lower number of large connections between the air cells, the effective diffusion coefficient is reduced. This effective diffusion coefficient of crumb, which equals approximately half the value of air, was estimated using X-ray micro-computer tomography images of <b>crumb</b> pieces. If <b>the</b> <b>crumb</b> has a lower effective diffusion coefficient, bread with similar crust properties has significantly longer crispness retention. Despite this, our data show that variations in properties of crust, which has 30 times higher permeability than crumb, have a larger impact on crispness retention than variations in properties of crumb...|$|R
