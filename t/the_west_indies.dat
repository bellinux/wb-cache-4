50|$|After 1890, Germany made a {{major effort}} to build up its navy, leading to a naval arms race with Britain. Germany also sought coaling {{stations}} because the coal-burning warships had to be refueled frequently, and Britain had a large worldwide network. Efforts to gain coaling stations in <b>the</b> Caribbean or <b>west</b> <b>Indies</b> failed. By 1900, {{the possibility of a}} conflict between Germany and Britain loomed larger, as Germany built up its own (much smaller) colonial empire, and started a naval race to try and catch up with Britain, the world's dominant naval power.|$|R

India were {{scheduled}} to play South Africa in a series of One Day Internationals in Ireland in June 2007. Ireland also played one-off matches at Stormont against the two teams. Missing several players from their World Cup squad, Ireland lost both games. Ireland hosted a quadrangular tournament in Dublin and Belfast in July involving <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Indies,</b> the Netherlands, and Scotland. Ireland and <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> both won their games against Scotland and the Netherlands with their direct encounter ending in no result due to rain. <b>The</b> <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> won the tournament because of a bonus point won against the Netherlands.

5|$|Both {{teams were}} evenly matched, with <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> not the force they had been, and England on the rise.

5|$|Early the {{following}} year, a weakened English cricket team toured <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Indies,</b> playing four Tests and eight other first-class matches. Fernandes captained British Guiana {{in both of}} their matches against the MCC, each of which was lost by an innings. Generally, <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> named a different captain for each of their home matches, commonly selecting a player from the host colony for the honour due to financial constraints. Fernandes was chosen as captain for the Test played at Bourda, Georgetown, British Guiana. The first two Tests had resulted in a draw and an English victory. Fernandes won the toss and elected to bat first. Clifford Roach and Errol Hunte opened the batting for <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> and scored 144 runs together for the opening partnership before Hunte was out for 53. George Headley then joined Roach at the crease, and the pair took the score onto 336 before Roach was dismissed after reaching his double century. Fernandes and Headley took the score up to 400, of which Fernandes added 22. The remaining batsmen were dismissed for a combined 71; Headley scored a century and <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> were all out for 471. The England team was then bowled out for 145, a first innings deficit of 326. Despite the healthy lead, Fernandes chose not to enforce the follow-on, and <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> batted again to score 290, leaving England requiring 617 runs in the fourth innings to achieve victory. Patsy Hendren scored a century for the visitors, but no other batsman reached 50 runs, and with just four minutes of the match remaining, <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> secured their maiden Test win by 289 runs.|$|E

50|$|In {{the finals}} Australia won the toss and elected to field. West Indian captain Clive Lloyd scored {{a century and}} enabled <b>west</b> <b>Indies</b> to reach 291/8. Among Australia only Gilmour bowled well, taking six wickets. In chasing, the Australian batsmen's running between the wickets {{turned out to be}} very poor, and five of them were run out.

5|$|Edwin Lloyd St Hill (9 March 1904– 21 May 1957) was a Trinidadian cricketer {{who played}} two Test matches for <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> in 1930. His brothers, Wilton and Cyl, also played for Trinidad; in addition, the former played Test matches for <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Indies.</b> St Hill first played local cricket in Trinidad {{with some success}} and {{graduated}} to the Trinidad team. He played regularly {{for the next five}} years but was not selected for any representative West Indian teams. His increased success in 1929 attracted the attention of <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> selectors, and he played two Test matches against England in 1930. Although not particularly successful, he bowled steadily and was chosen to tour Australia with <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> in 1930–31. He was fairly effective in first-class games but the form of the other fast bowlers in the team meant that he was not chosen for any of the Test matches.|$|E
5|$|Eight teams {{participated in}} the first tournament: Australia, England, India, New Zealand, Pakistan, and <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> (the six Test nations at the time), {{together}} with Sri Lanka and a composite team from East Africa.

The tournament was won by <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Indies,</b> who defeated Australia by 17 runs in the final at Lord's.|$|E
5|$|Garfield Sobers, {{captain of}} <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> cricket team {{and one of}} the most {{prominent}} cricketers in the world, outraged many in the Caribbean in September 1970 when he took part in a friendly double-wicket tournament at Salisbury Sports Club in Rhodesia (renamed Zimbabwe in 1980), a country in southern Africa that was unrecognised internationally because of its mostly white minority government. The resulting furore nearly caused him to lose the captaincy, and threatened the unity of <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> team itself.|$|E

60|$|The corvée, {{vexatious}} as it was, yet excited less violent heats and inflicted less misery {{than the}} abuses of military service. There had been a militia in the country {{as far back as}} the time of the Merovingians, but the militia-service with which Turgot had to deal only dated from 1726. Each parish was bound to supply its quota of men to this service, and the obligation was perhaps the most odious grievance, though not the most really mischievous, of all that then afflicted the realm. The hatred which it raised was due to no failure of the military spirit in the people. From Frederick the Great downwards, everybody was well aware that the disasters to France which had begun with the shameful defeat of Rossbach and ended with the loss of Canada in <b>the</b> <b>west</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Indies</b> in the east (1757-1763), were due to no want of valour in the common soldier. It was the generals, as Napoleon said fifty years afterwards, who were incapable and inept. And it was the ineptitude of the administrative chiefs that made the militia at once ineffective and abhorred. First, they allowed a great number of classified exemptions from the ballot. The noble, the tonsured clerk, the counsellor, the domestic of noble, tonsured clerk, and counsellor, the eldest son of the lawyer and the farmer, the tax collector, the schoolmaster, were all exempt. Hence the curse of service was embittered by a sense of injustice. This was one of the many springs in the old régime that fed the swelling and vehement stream of passion for social equality, until at length when the day came, it made such short and furious work with the structure of envious partition between citizen and citizen.|$|R
5|$|Garry Sobers was {{the captain}} for <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Indies,</b> while England had three captains: Mike Smith (first Test), Cowdrey (second-fourth Test) and Brian Close (fifth Test) during the five Test series. <b>The</b> <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> team {{was not as}} strong as in the {{previous}} series, but many of their deficiencies were glossed over by Sobers' exceptional all-round performance. He scored centuries in three Test matches and claimed five wicket innings hauls in two Tests.|$|E
5|$|Graduating {{from playing}} at the Demerara Cricket Club as a teenager, to play for British Guiana in 1922, Fernandes took part in tours of England in 1923 and 1928. He made his debut Test {{appearance}} during the 1928 tour, playing {{in the first of}} the three Tests. His next, and final Test match came during the English tour of <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> in 1930. At the time, <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> had a practice of picking their captain from the colony that the match was being played in, and Fernandes was granted the honour for the match in British Guiana. <b>The</b> <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> won the match, their maiden victory in Test cricket. After the match, Fernandes only played one further first-class match, and retired from first-class cricket in 1932.|$|E
5|$|He {{played only}} two Tests in 1972 owing {{to a series}} of injuries, but rejoined the team in <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Indies</b> under Denness' captaincy.
