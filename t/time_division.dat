25|$|During 1987, eight HST power {{cars were}} {{converted}} {{for use as}} driving van trailers (DVTs) with Class 91 locomotives during trials on the East Coast Main Line. The power cars were fitted with buffers and <b>Time</b> <b>Division</b> Multiplex equipment {{that allowed them to}} directly control a Class 91, and were moved over to the ECML where they were used on workings with Class 89 and then Class 91 locomotives from London to Leeds. After the Mk 4 stock had been delivered, the HST power cars had the TDM equipment removed, and then reverted to their normal duties. The power cars used for this project can be easily identified as they are still fitted with buffers. They were then transferred to Virgin Cross Country, and put in storage when Virgin replaced its HST fleet with Bombardier's Voyager (though Arriva, upon later taking over the franchise, acquired 10 power cars, 4 of which were buffered). Grand Central bought six of these for services from Sunderland to London, the remaining two having been integrated into Network Rail's New Measurement Train.|$|E

500|$|The {{club was}} {{excluded}} from a wartime league in 1939 {{and was also}} denied re-entry to the Scottish Football League Division Two {{at the end of}} World War II, along with six other small league clubs. As a result, the clubs competed in a newly created Division C along with the reserve teams of some of Scotland's top clubs. In the second season in Division C, East Stirlingshire won the league and was promoted back to Division Two, now renamed [...] "Division B", but finished last after one season in 1948–49, and failed re-election to compete for another year. At the same <b>time,</b> <b>Division</b> C was abolished and the club was forced leave the Scottish Football League to play in regional leagues for six years before rejoining Division Two in 1955–56 when the number of teams was expanded. The club sold many young players to larger clubs, including defender Eddie McCreadie to Chelsea in 1962 who earned 23 international caps for Scotland and is tenth in Chelsea's all-time appearance list with 410. The money earned from the transfer helped attract new players and in the 1962–63 season, the club won promotion to the top flight for a second time, as runners-up in Division Two behind St Johnstone. Like the previous occasion in 1932–33, East Stirlingshire spent one solitary season in the top tier before being relegated.|$|E

In this problem, one must choose time slots for the edges of a wireless communications network so that each node of the network can communicate with each neighboring node without interference. Using a strong edge coloring (and using two time slots for each edge color, one for each direction) would solve the problem but might use more time slots than necessary. Instead, they seek a coloring of the directed graph formed by doubling each undirected edge of the network, with the property that each directed edge [...] has a different color from the edges that go out from [...] and from the neighbors of [...] They propose a heuristic for this problem based on a distributed algorithm for -edge-coloring together with a postprocessing phase that reschedules edges that might interfere with each other.|$|E
