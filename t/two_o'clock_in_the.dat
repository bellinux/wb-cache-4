2500|$|The day of upper-class Parisians {{before the}} Revolution was {{described}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1780s by Sebastien Mercier in his Tableau de Paris. Deliveries of fresh produce by some three thousand farmers {{to the central}} market of Les Halles began at one <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning, followed by the deliveries of fish and meat. At nine o'clock, the limonadiers served coffee and pastries to the first clients. At ten o'clock, the clerks and officials of the courts and administration arrived at work. At noon, the financiers, brokers and bankers took their places at <b>the</b> Bourse and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> financial district of the Saint-Honoré quarter. At <b>two</b> <b>o'clock,</b> work stopped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> financial markets and offices, and the Parisians departed for lunch, either {{at home or in}} restaurants. At five o'clock, the streets were again filled with people, as the wealthier Parisians went to the theater, or for promenades, or to cafés. The city was quiet until nine clock, when the streets filled again, as the Parisians made visits to friends. Dinner, or [...] "souper" [...] began between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock. It was also the hour when the prostitutes came out at the Palais-Royal and other heavily frequented streets. When the souper was finished, between eleven and midnight, most Parisians headed home, with others remained to gamble <b>in</b> <b>the</b> salons of the Palais-Royal. The work day for artisans and laborers was usually twelve hours, from about seven <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning until seven <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evening, usually with a two-hour break at midday for rest and food.|$|R

Victorio's people needed water and believing that {{there were only a}} few soldiers present, regrouped and attacked immediately. As the battle progressed, Victorio sent his warriors to flank the soldiers. Carpenter charged forward with Companies B and H and a few massed volleys from their carbines sent the hostiles scattering back up the canyon. Stunned by the presence of such a strong force but in desperate need of water, Victorio repeatedly charged the cavalrymen in attempts to reach the spring. Grierson's cavalry defenders, now bolstered by Carpenter's two companies, stood firm. The last such attempt to break the soldiers was conducted near nightfall and when it failed, Victorio and his followers withdrew into the westward into the mountains.

5|$|The French advance {{drove in}} the British skirmishers {{and reached the}} sunken road. As they did so, Pack's men stood up, formed into a four deep line {{formation}} for fear of the French cavalry, advanced, and opened fire. However, a firefight had been anticipated and the French infantry had accordingly advanced in more linear formation. Now, fully deployed into line, they returned fire and successfully pressed the British troops; although the attack faltered at the centre, the line in front of d'Erlon's right started to crumble. Picton was killed shortly after ordering the counter-attack and the British and Hanoverian troops also began to give way {{under the pressure of}} numbers. Pack's regiments, all four ranks deep, advanced to attack the French in the road but faltered and began to fire on the French instead of charging. The 42nd Black Watch halted at the hedge and the resulting fire-fight drove back the British 92nd Foot while the leading French 45e Ligne burst through the hedge cheering. Along the sunken road, the French were forcing the Allies back, the British line was dispersing, and at <b>two</b> <b>o'clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afternoon Napoleon was winning the Battle of Waterloo.|$|E

25|$|The scene late in {{the film}} where Grier, Lawrence, and Murphy hug {{in front of the}} Empire State Building was shot around one or <b>two</b> <b>o'clock</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning, when the lights are usually shut off.

When editing the film, they simply reversed the footage to make it appear as if the lights were being turned on. The filmmakers even thought about ending the movie at this point, deciding instead to go with Marcus attempting to win back Angela's affection. For this, an alternate ending was shot where Angela is teaching the kids at the school and Marcus comes, talks to her and eventually wins her back; the filmmakers thought it was slow and uninteresting, and eventually came up with the released version.|$|E
