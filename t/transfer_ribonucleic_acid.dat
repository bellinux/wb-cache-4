40|$|Several {{families}} of multicopy genes, such as <b>transfer</b> <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acids</b> (tRNAs) and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), {{are subject to}} concerted evolution, an effect that keeps sequences of paralogous genes effectively identical. Under these circumstances, {{it is impossible to}} distinguish orthologs from paralogs on the basis of sequence similarity alone. Synteny, the preservation of relative genomic locations, however, also remains informative for the disambiguation of evolutionary relationships in this situation. In this contribution, we describe an automatic pipeline for the evolutionary analysis of such cases that use genome-wide alignments as a starting point to assign orthology relationships determined by synteny. The evolution of tRNAs in primates as well as the history of the Y RNA family in vertebrates and nematodes are used to showcase the method. The pipeline is freely available...|$|R

40|$|Modification of {{approximately}} 65 % of the amine groups of an aminopropylsilyl bonded-phase silica high-performance liquid chromatographic anion exchanger (APS-Hypersil) with organic acids containing n-alkyl moieties of different chain lengths, results in mixed mode chromatographic matrices of varying hydrophobic character.

The observed resolution appears to be primarily a function of interfacial precipitation effected by the high initial salt concentration of the mobile phase and the hydrophobic character of the stationary phase, followed by selective resolubilization during the decreasing salt gradient. After resolubilization, adsorptive processes may additionally contribute to resolution. The residual amine groups decrease the hydrophobic character of the stationary phase compared to a pure reversed-phase support.

The aminoacylated mitochondrial tRNA's of several presumptive tRNA mutants were analyzed by reverse-phase chromatography on RPC- 5. Two mutant strains, G 76 - 26 and G 76 - 35, were determined to carry mutations in the cysteine and histidine tRNA genes, respectively. The cysteine tRNA mutant was used to isolate cytoplasmic petite mutants whose retained segments of mitochondrial DNA contain the cysteine tRNA gene.

40|$|Summary. -The weights of osteosarcomata {{that arose}} 22 {{days after the}} s. c. {{injection}} of cell suspensions (of whole tumours) that had been exposed in vitro to tRNA were {{significantly different from the}} weights of those arising from untreated cells.

Synthesis of 1 -allyl- 5 -cyanouracil (3) by a cyclization reaction provided an affinity group.

Polymerization was allowed to occur in a slab gel electrophoresis system on which tRNA samples were subsequently subjected to electrophoresis. Electrophoresis in all dilute buffer system gels, run under identical conditions, with and without the uracil adduct showed no resolution of the various tRNAs. When a zwitter ion buffer solution of high ionic strength was utilized in electrophoresis, a lower rate of migration of the tRNA species occurred only on the 1 -allyl- 5 - cyanouracil containing gels.

40|$|The <b>transfer</b> <b>ribonucleic</b> <b>acids</b> (tRNAs) of B. subtilis at {{different}} growth phases are examined {{for changes in}} the composition and the methylation of minor constituents. The composition of the tRNAs indicates about equal amounts of adenosine and uridine, and of guanosine and cytidine. About 3 - 4 residues are present as modified bases in the average tRNA molecule. The net composition of tRNAs appears to remain unaltered during different growth phases. In vitro methylation of tRNAs indicates lack of methyl groups in both exponentially growing cells and spores. In vivo methylation studies show tRNA methylation occurs during the stationary phase in the absence of net tRNA synthesis. Thus, both in vitro and in vivo methylation indicates that the tRNAs in exponentially growing cells do not contain their full complement of modified bases. More complete modification is noted in tRNAs from stationary cells or spores. Hence, tRNA modifications in general are preserved with fidelity even in the dormant spore but the possibility is left open that specific modifications of selected isoacceptors of tRNAs may occur...|$|R

They are present at position 37 of the anticodon arm and the contribution of these hypermodified nucleosides to codon–anticodon interactions, as well as translation, are significant, although not fully understood. Herein we described a new chemical synthesis method of the oligoribonucleotides containing N 6 -alkyladenosines and 2 -methylthio-N 6 -alkyladenosines via post-synthetic modifications of precursor oligoribonucleotides. To obtain oligoribonucleotides containing N 6 -alkyladenosines, the precursor oligoribonucleotide carrying 6 -methylthiopurine riboside residue was used, whereas for the synthesis of oligoribonucleotides containing 2 -methylthio-N 6 -alkyladenosines the precursor oligoribonucleotide carrying the 2 -methylthio- 6 -chloropurine riboside was applied. Among the modified oligoribonucleotides of different length and secondary structures, there were several containing naturally occurring modified nucleosides such as: N 6 -isopentenyladenosine (i 6 A), N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A), 2 -methylthio-N 6 -isopentenyladenosine (ms 2 i 6 A), and 2 -methylthio-N 6 -methyladenosine (ms 2 m 6 A), as well as several unnaturally modified adenosine derivatives...|$|R

The hisT mutants grew more rapidly than did hisT+ strains with either arginine or proline as the nitrogen source and glucose as the carbon source. The hisT mutations were transduced into new strains to show that these growth properties were due to the hisT mutations. The hisT mutations did not influence the growth of mutants having altered glutamine synthetase regulation. Assays of the three primary ammonia-assimilatory enzymes, glutamate dehydrogenase, glutamine synthetase, and glutamate synthase, showed that glutamate synthase activities were lower in hisT mutants than in isogenic hisT+ controls; however, the glutamate dehydrogenase activity was about threefold higher in the hisT strains grown in glucose-arginine medium.

Our lab previously developed the signature digestion approach for identifying tRNAs without specific separation.

These quantitative signature digestion products were characterized using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and we find that up to 5 -fold changes in tRNA abundance can be quantified from sub-microgram amounts of total tRNA. Quantitative tRNA signature digestion products must (i) incorporate an isotopic label during enzymatic digestion; (ii) have no m/z interferences from other signature digestion products in the sample and (iii) yield a linear response during LC-MS analysis. Under these experimental conditions, the RNase T 1, A and U 2 signature digestion products that potentially {{could be used for}} the relative quantification of Escherichia coli tRNAs were identified, and the linearity and sequence identify of RNase T 1 signature digestion products were experimentally confirmed. These RNase T 1 quantitative signature digestion products were then used in proof-of-principle experiments to quantify changes arising due to different culturing media to 17 tRNA families.

Further, specific changes in the isoacceptor patterns are revealed when tRNA's from actinomycin-producing cells are compared with those of younger cells by reverse- phase column chromatography. A specific glycyl-tRNA species is eliminated from the reverse-phase profile of tRNA's from actinomycin-producing S. antibioticus cells as compared with younger cells. Changes in isoacceptor patterns were also observed for the amino acids methionine, valine, phenylalanine, and leucine. Actinomycin synthesis was inhibited by growing S. antibioticus cells in the presence of alpha-methyl-DL-tryptophan. Inhibition of actinomycin synthesis reversed the changes in tRNA observed in normally grown control cultures, although it had no demonstrable effect on the growth of the cells. Thus, tRNA from 48 -h-old, alpha-methyl-tryptophan-grown cells had amino acid acceptor activity that was equal to or greater than that of tRNA from 12 -h-old, normally grown cells. Similarly, the reverse-phase chromatographic pattern for glycyl-tRNA's from 48 -h-old, alpha-methyl-tryptophan-grown cells was identical to that of the glycyl-tRNA's from 12 -h-old, normally grown cells. In contrast, the ability of ribosomes from 48 -h-old, alpha-methyl-tryptophan-grown cells to function in polypeptide synthesis in vitro was essentially identical to that of 48 -h-old, normally grown cells.
