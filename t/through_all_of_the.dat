5|$|The story {{revolves}} around two gods: , {{the goddess of}} harmony, and Chaos, the god of discord. The game unites both protagonists and antagonists from installments of the main Final Fantasy series, their stories narrated by the first Final Fantasy game's Cid of the Lufaine. Other than the gods and their champions, the player also deals with crystal-like doppelgangers called Manikins. The game has an overarching storyline that requires playing <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> characters to complete. The game contains twenty-two total playable characters: ten heroes and ten villains, one of each representing Final Fantasy through Final Fantasy X, and two secret characters: a heroine representing Final Fantasy XI, and a villain representing Final Fantasy XII. Initially, only the ten main heroes are playable in all gameplay modes; the ten main villains are playable in Arcade mode, but must still be unlocked for access in all other gameplay modes.|$|E
25|$|Openhole {{completions}} (in {{comparison with}} cemented pipe) require {{better understanding of}} formation damage, wellbore clean-up and fluid loss control. A key difference is that perforating penetrates through the first 6-18 inches (15–45cm) of formation around the wellbore, whilst openhole completions require the reservoir fluids to flow <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> filtrate-invaded zone around the wellbore and lift-off of the mud filter cake.|$|E

25|$|In {{the many}} republics of ancient Greece, such as Athens or Corinth, {{one side of}} their coins would have {{a symbol of the}} state, usually their patron goddess or her symbol, which {{remained}} constant <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coins minted by that state, which is regarded as the obverse of those coins. The opposite side may have varied from time to time.

The theory also states that not everyone goes <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stages, nor in a prescribed order. In addition to the five-stages theory, Kübler-Ross has been credited with bringing mainstream awareness to the sensitivity required for better treatment of people who are dealing with a fatal disease.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of the American Revolution, the {{institution}} of slavery was firmly established in the American colonies. It was most important in the six southern states from Maryland to Georgia, but the total of a half million slaves were spread out <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> colonies. In the South, 40% of the population was made up of slaves, and as Americans moved into Kentucky {{and the rest of the}} southwest, one-sixth of the settlers were slaves.

25|$|CYR61 binds {{directly}} to various integrin receptors {{in a cell}} type-dependent manner, including integrin αvβ3 in endothelial cells, α6β1 and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) in fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells αIIbβ3 in activated platelets, αMβ2 in monocytes and macrophages, and αDβ2 in macrophage foam cells. Where examined, syndecan-4 {{has been identified as}} the HSPG critical for CCN1 functions. The CYR61 binding sites for some of these integrins have been mapped (Figure 1). Due to the cell type specificity of integrin expression, CYR61 acts through distinct integrins to mediate specific functions in different types of cells. For example, CYR61 induces angiogenic functions in endothelial cells through αvβ3, and in fibroblasts promotes cellular senescence and enables TNFα to induce apoptosis through binding to α6β1-HSPGs. However, CYR61 supports cell adhesion <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> integrins identified above.|$|E
25|$|Under normal circumstances, a tiny {{amount of}} urobilinogen, if any, is {{excreted}} in the urine. If the liver's function is impaired or when biliary drainage is blocked, {{some of the}} conjugated bilirubin leaks out of the hepatocytes and appears in the urine, turning it dark amber. However, in disorders involving hemolytic anemia, an increased number of red blood cells are broken down, causing {{an increase in the}} amount of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood. Because the unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble, one will not see an increase in bilirubin in the urine. Because there is no problem with the liver or bile systems, this excess unconjugated bilirubin will go <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> normal processing mechanisms that occur (e.g., conjugation, excretion in bile, metabolism to urobilinogen, reabsorption) and will show up as an increase in urine urobilinogen. This difference between increased urine bilirubin and increased urine urobilinogen helps to distinguish between various disorders in those systems.|$|E

25|$|The Corner Patrol Zones (commonly {{known as}} CPZs) - The Third Wars onwards - the House Robots were now {{confined}} to {{the four corners of}} the arena much like in The First Wars. Which house robot was used in which battle was defined by a rota system but would also sometimes depend on if a house robot was being repaired. In The Fourth Wars, the house robots switched to a rota system of Shunt, Matilda, Sgt.Bash, and Dead Metal. Sir Killalot consistently appeared every round excepting battles 3 & 4 of the War of Independence. From The Fifth Wars and Extreme 1 onwards only two house robots were allowed in the arena at a time, and this moved in a rota <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> machines. However some House Robots didn't appear in a show or on some occasions missed several shows before making an appearance. For Series 8, the CPZs are larger and L-shaped. The house robots no longer attack competitors who enter any CPZ, but stick to guarding their own.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the lander}} was 355 m above the ground, airbags were {{inflated}} {{in less than}} a second using three catalytically cooled solid rocket motors that served as gas generators. The airbags were made of 4 inter-connected multi-layer vectran bags that surrounded the tetrahedron lander. They were designed and tested to accommodate grazing angle impacts as high as 28m/s. However, as the airbags were designed for no more than about 15m/s vertical impacts, three solid retrorockets were mounted above the lander in the backshell. These were fired at 98m above the ground. The lander's on-board computer estimated the best time to fire the rockets and cut the bridle so that the lander velocity would be reduced to about 0m/s between 15 and 25m above the ground. After 2.3 seconds, while the rockets were still firing, the lander cut the bridle loose about 21.5m above the ground and fell to the ground. The rockets flew up and away with the backshell and parachute (they have since been sighted by orbital images). The lander impacted at 14m/s and limited the impact to only 18G of deceleration. The first bounce was 15.7m high and continued bouncing for at least 15 additional bounces (accelerometer data recording did not continue <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bounces).|$|E
500|$|The {{subspecies}} creatures, {{which were}} created from Radu's blood, originally began as local Romanian men in rubber suits. The men were filmed on over-scaled sets {{to simulate the}} miniature size of the creatures. The performances of the Romanian men, along with {{the design of the}} rubber suits, caused director Ted Nicolaou to rethink his approach. Nicolaou brought in animator David W. Allen to assist him in creating [...] "more magical" [...] looking subspecies creatures. Allen went <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film footage that contained the Romanian extras in their rubber suits with the film's editor in order to find usable footage before and after the men enter the scene. Allen would use the isolated footage to develop a new background for the animated creatures he would later create. Allen created two puppet types, displayed in front of a bluescreen: a stop-motion puppet and a rod puppet. Each of the puppet types were composed of foam rubber, and held similar skeletal systems. Some differences between the two types include tension filled joints for the stop-motion puppet, while the rod puppet was looser. The flexibility of the rod-puppet allowed for faster movements, which were needed occasionally for real-time filming.|$|E

500|$|Greater Manchester lies at {{the heart}} of the North West {{transport}} network. Much of the infrastructure converges at Manchester city centre with the Manchester Inner Ring Road, an amalgamation of several major roads, circulating the city centre. The county is the only place in the UK to have a fully orbital motorway, the M60, which passes <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boroughs except Bolton and Wigan. Greater Manchester has a higher percentage of the motorway network than any other county in the country, and according to the Guinness Book of World Records, it has the most traffic lanes side by side (17), spread across several parallel carriageways (M61 at Linnyshaw in Walkden, close to the M60 interchange).• Greater Manchester's [...] of motorway network saw 5.8billion vehicle kilometres in 2002– about 6% of the UK's total, or 89,000vehicles a day. The A580 [...] "East Lancs" [...] road is a primary A road that connects Manchester and Salford with Liverpool. It was the UK's first purpose-built intercity highway and was officially opened by George V on 18 July 1934. Throughout 2008, there were proposals for congestion charging in Greater Manchester. Unlike the London scheme, two cordons would have been used, one covering the main urban core of the Greater Manchester Urban Area and another covering Manchester city centre.|$|E
500|$|The Jaguar {{version was}} noted by critics as having {{problems}} such as slowdown and lack of a save option, although some liked the graphics and gameplay. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly commented that the game itself is great fun, but that the Jaguar conversion had confusing menus and dithered text which is excessively difficult to read. GamePro echoed these criticisms and further stated that the Jaguar version suffers from frustrating slowdown. They summarised that [...] "Ocean didn't work hard enough to make Theme Park look and sound good on the Jaguar". A reviewer for Next Generation took the reverse position, saying that the Jaguar conversion [...] "is seamless" [...] and the game itself was mediocre. Their elaboration was that [...] "Slow gameplay and confusing layouts keep it from ever achieving the addictiveness of the other 'god' games, and most players will find themselves bored before they've even run <b>through</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> options". German magazine Atari Insides reviewer complimented the addictiveness, {{but the lack of}} save opportunities was criticised, and a reviewer from ST Computer believed the game's complexity and colourful graphics assured it of being long and attractive. Mega Funs main criticism of the Jaguar version was its inability to save in-game.|$|E
