40|$|<b>The</b> <b>natural</b> space <b>environment</b> {{has a great}} {{influence}} {{on the ability of}} space systems to perform according to mission design specification. Understanding <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> space <b>environment</b> and its influence on space system performance is critical to the concept formulation, design, development, and operation of space systems. Compatibility with <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> space <b>environment</b> is a primary factor in determining the functional lifetime of the space system. Space systems being designed and developed today are growing in complexity. In many instances, the increased complexity also increases its sensitivity to space environmental effects. Sensitivities to <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> space <b>environment</b> can be tempered through appropriate design measures, material selection, ground processing, mitigation strategies, and/or the acceptance of known risks. The design engineer must understand the effects of <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> space <b>environment</b> on <b>the</b> space system and its components. This paper will discuss the influence of <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> space <b>environment</b> in <b>the</b> mission life cycle with a specific focus on the role of material selection...|$|R

5|$|A {{habitat is}} an {{ecological}} or environmental {{area that is}} inhabited by a particular species of animal, plant, or other type of organism. The term typically refers to the zone in which the organism lives and where it can find food, shelter, protection and mates for reproduction. It is <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>environment</b> in which an organism lives, or the physical environment that surrounds a species population.|$|E
5|$|A {{realignment}} of {{the highway}} between Newman and Port Hedland had been proposed since 1976, which would see the road deviate to the west at Newman, and travel via Wittenoom instead of Marble Bar. In the early 1980s, eleven route corridors were investigated by Main Roads. The potential impacts on <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>environment,</b> regional economy, tourism, and resident population were considered, with particular concern for the crossing of the Hamersley Range.|$|E
5|$|Biofuels, in {{the form}} of liquid fuels derived from plant materials, are {{entering}} the market, driven by factors such as oil price spikes and the need for increased energy security.

A sample of 43 former clients voluntarily participated in semi-structured interview, and the data were analyzed according to interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). Three main superordinate themes were identified as the three phases of NBR-Prelude, Recuperating and Empowerment-explaining and illuminating the role of <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>environments</b> in each phase. An explanatory model of NBR {{in this context is}} presented including the three phases of NBR, IRP supportive occupations and a pyramid of supporting environments.

5|$|During {{early years}} of colonisation, the {{surrounding}} trees were cut down and the river's gravel used in road making and construction of buildings. As <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>environment</b> was removed, the banks were eroded and the riverbed gradually levelled as waterholes filled. By 1878 the river was noted to be a malodorous, black sewer rather than the sylvan stream of the 1830s.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to planned increases in large-scale generating capacity and microsystems using renewable sources, various related schemes to reduce carbon emissions are being researched. Although {{there is significant}} support from the public, private and community-led sectors, concerns {{about the effect of}} the technologies on <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>environment</b> have been expressed. There is also an emerging political debate about the relationship between the siting, and the ownership and control of these widely distributed resources.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium chalcogen and pnictogen {{compounds}} {{have been}} well studied primarily as part of research into their electronic and magnetic properties and their interactions in <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>environment.</b> Pnictide and carbide compounds have also attracted interest because of {{their presence in the}} fuel of several advanced nuclear reactor designs, although the latter group has not had nearly as much research as the former.|$|E

5|$|Promotion: A {{communication}} with the market should put stress on environmental aspects, for example that the company possesses a CP certificate or is ISO 14000 certified.

The Girl Scouts assumed leadership of the program after 2006 and renamed it Camp Artemis, after the Greek goddess who protects young girls, animals, and <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>environment.</b> The Youth Staff are referred to as members of ALTA (Artemis Leadership Training Adventure). They have continued to run Camp Artemis as a resident camp for girls 11 – 17 each summer.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, Czech chemist Bohuslav Brauner {{found out}} that the {{differences}} in properties between neodymium and samarium were the largest between any two consecutive lanthanides in the sequence then known; as a conclusion, he suggested there was an element with intermediate properties between them. This prediction was supported in 1914 by Henry Moseley who, having discovered that atomic number was an experimentally measurable property of elements, found that a few atomic numbers had no known corresponding elements: the gaps were 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, and 87. With the knowledge of a gap in the periodic table several groups started to search for the predicted element among other rare earths in <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{his death}} on 14 August 1956, the Marquess of Bute's will bequeathed the {{archipelago}} to the National Trust for Scotland provided they accepted the offer within six months. After much soul-searching, the Executive Committee {{agreed to do}} so in January 1957. The slow renovation and conservation of the village began, much of it undertaken by summer volunteer work parties.

5|$|The Acjachemem, who {{numbered}} roughly 2000 overall, were hunter-gatherers, {{living in}} small, semi-permanent villages close to water sources. There were five villages {{on the main}} stem of San Juan Creek, three of which were below the Trabuco Creek confluence, and four more {{in other parts of}} the watershed, mostly on Trabuco and Oso Creeks. The Acjachemem diet usually consisted of fruits, acorns, grains, and some meat, while they practiced little agriculture. Shell middens indicate that they also harvested shellfish from the coast. Native peoples in this area are not known to have built permanent structures in this area or significantly influenced <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Mikea are {{culturally}} and linguistically {{nearly identical to}} the neighboring Vezo fishing clan and Masikoro herding and farming clan of the Sakalava; only the traditional source of livelihood distinguishes the three groups. The popular association of the Mikea with the ancestral Vazimba clan has contributed to widespread belief that the Mikea possess Vazimba attributes, such as being small in stature, unclothed, shy and avoidant of contact with outsiders, and living in perfect harmony with <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>environment.</b> None of these are borne out by evidence.|$|E
5|$|The Svalbard Treaty {{was signed}} on 9 February 1920 and came into effect on 14 August 1925.
