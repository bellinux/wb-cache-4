50|$|Meanwhile, Johnson had {{extended}} the Fischer-Fink synthesis by reacting 2-oximinoacetoacetate esters (ethyl, benzyl, or <b>tertiary-butyl),</b> with 3-alkyl substituted 2,4-pentanediones. The Kleinspehn synthesis was extended under David Dolphin {{by the use}} of unsymmetrical &beta;-diketones (such as 3-alkyl substituted 2,4-hexanediones), which preferentially reacted initially at the less hindered acetyl group and afforded the corresponding 5-methylpyrrole-2-carboxylate esters. N,N-Dialkyl 2-oximinoacetoacetamides also were found to give pyrroles when reacted under Knorr conditions with 3-substituted-2,4-pentanediones, in yields comparable to the corresponding esters (around 45%). However, when unsymmetrical diketones were used, {{it was found that the}} acetyl group from the acetoacetamide was retained in the product, and one of the acyl groups from the diketone had been lost. This same mechanism occurs to a minor extent in the acetoacetate ester systems, and had previously been detected radiochemically by Harbuck and Rapoport. Most of the above-described syntheses have application in the synthesis of porphyrins, bile pigments, and dipyrrins.|$|E
5000|$|Recent history {{includes}} an incident involving groundwater contamination. A {{test of the}} groundwater conducted on September 14, 2001, showed that the water contained the ether MTBE (methyl <b>tertiary-butyl</b> ether) at levels of over 350 ppb (parts per billion). This was the first public statement concerning the presence of MTBE in Pascoag drinking water, though residents claim to have detected it as early as May 2001. MTBE is a gasoline additive intended to enhance octane levels. It {{is believed to have}} come from leaking tanks at a local Exxon Mobil gas station. As the situation was resolved over the following months, nearly 1,500 residents of Pascoag responded by filing a lawsuit against Exxon Mobil through the law offices of Napoli, Kaiser, and Bern.

5000|$|Knorr's pyrrole can be derivatized in {{a number}} of useful manners. One {{equivalent}} of sodium hydroxide will saponify the 2-ester selectively. Dissolving Knorr's pyrrole in concentrated sulfuric acid, and then pouring the resulting solution into water will hydrolyze the 4-ester group selectively. The 5-methyl group can be variously oxidized to chloromethyl, aldehyde, or carboxylic acid functionality by the use of stoichiometric sulfuryl chloride in glacial acetic acid. Alternatively, the nitrogen atom can be alkylated. The two ester positions can be more smoothly differentiated by incorporating benzyl or tert-butyl groups via the corresponding acetoacetate esters. Benzyl groups can be removed by catalytic hydrogenolysis over palladium on carbon, and <b>tertiary-butyl</b> groups can be removed by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid, or boiling aqueous acetic acid. R1 and R3 (as well as R2 and [...] "Et") can be varied by the application of appropriate &beta;-ketoesters readily made by a synthesis emanating from acid chlorides, Meldrum's acid, and the alcohol of one's choice. Ethyl and benzyl esters are easily made thereby, and the reaction is noteworthy in that even the highly hindered tert-butyl alcohol gives very high yields in this synthesis.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency had {{authority}} to mandate that minimum proportions of oxygenates {{be added to}} automotive gasoline on regional and seasonal basis from 1992 until 2006 {{in an attempt to}} reduce air pollution, in particular ground-level ozone and smog. In addition to this North American automakers have in 2006 and 2007 promoted a blend of 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline, marketed as E85, and their flex-fuel vehicles, e.g. GM's [...] "Live Green, Go Yellow" [...] campaign. U.S. Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards give an artificial 54% fuel efficiency bonus to vehicles capable of running on 85% alcohol blends over vehicles not adapted to run on 85% alcohol blends. There is also alcohols' intrinsically cleaner combustion, however due to its lower energy density it is not capable of producing as much energy per gallon as gasoline.

40|$|Fuel oxygenates are {{oxygen-containing}} compounds (e. g., ethers and alcohols) {{that are}} added to gasoline either to boost the octane rating, to make the fuel burn cleaner by increas-ing the oxygen content, or to achieve a combination of both. The most commonly used oxygenates are methyl <b>tertiary-butyl</b> ether (MTBE) and ethanol. Other oxy-genates include ter-tiary-amyl methyl ether (TAME), ethyl <b>tertiary-butyl</b> ether (ETBE), diisopropyl ether (DIPE), tertiary-amyl ethyl ether (TAEE), <b>tertiary-butyl</b> alcohol (TBA), tertiary-amyl alcohol (TAA), and methanol.

Ethers, and primarily MTBE, have been used increasingly since the late 1970 s. Ini-tially, MTBE was used to boost the octane rating of mid- and high-grade gasoline and was present at concentrations of about 4 to 8 percent by volume. These fuels were transported, stored, and used nationwide. Amendments to the Clean Air Act in 1990 led to the implementation of the Oxygenated Fuel (Oxyfuel) and Refor-mulated Gasoline (RFG) programs in 1992 and 1995, respec-tively.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of gasoline oxygenates in environmental groundwater samples {{is complicated by}} a variety of factors including constituent co-elution and the improper selection of surrogates (e. g. Rhodes and Verstuyft 2001; EPA 1997). Misidentification of oxygenate concentrations may lead to erroneous conclusions regarding spill composition and history at gasoline release sites. Recently, several authors have reported the potential for acid-catalyzed hydrolysis of methyl <b>tertiary-butyl</b> ether (MTBE) to <b>tertiary-butyl</b> alcohol (TBA) in environmental groundwater samples (O’Reilly et al. 2001; Pirkle and McLoughlin 2002), a process which could further compromise the validity of oxygenate analytical results. However, the conditions under which the hydrolysis reactions were evaluated included higher temperatures than typically encountered during groundwater sample transport and analysis, as well as higher MTBE concentrations than typically encountered at gasoline spill sites. To empirically evaluate the potential for acid hydrolysis of MTBE to TBA under more typical “field conditions”, a series of water samples spiked with 200, 2, 000 and 20, 000 mg/L MTBE, stored at 4 ° C, acidified to a pH of £ 2, were analyzed for MTBE and TBA via EPA method 624 afte...|$|E

40|$|The {{open burning}} of biomass generates {{significant}} air emissions annually in California. Historically, some important sources of these emissions {{have been the}} open-field burning of excess rice straw, and the burning of forest residue and chaparral. These can especially be of concern where they are emitted during days when ground-level ozone concentrations are elevated. Open burning {{can be seen as}} a “disposal method ” for these biomass sources. One means of reducing air emissions and other negative impacts associated with this disposal method is to use this biomass as a feedstock for ethanol production. Biomass-derived ethanol can be used as a fuel oxygenate, either by itself or in the form of its ether derivative, ethyl <b>tertiary-butyl</b> ether (ETBE). This oxygenate can be used as a substitute for methyl <b>tertiary-butyl</b> ether (MTBE), which is currently being used in reformulated gasoline in the state of California and elsewhere in the United States. Therefore, the focus of this report is to quantify and compare the comprehensive environmental flows over the life cycles of two disposal scenarios: (1) the burning of the biomass plus the production and use of MTBE, and (2) the conversion of the biomass into ETBE and its subsequent use. To facilitate the presentation of results, these two scenarios are referred to as the MTBE scenario and the ETBE scenario, respectively. The results of the study were compared in terms of potential impacts of the pollutants emitted (e. g., greenhouse gases, acidification potential, etc.).

Methyl <b>tertiary-butyl</b> ether (MTBE) is already in use world-wide and ethyl <b>tertiary-butyl</b> ether (ETBE) may be used increasingly in the future. The aims of the present thesis were to study the uptake and disposition (toxicokinetics) of MTBE and ETBE in humans, {{to address the issue}} of biological monitoring and to measure acute effects (assessed by questionnaire, lung function, nasal and ocular measurements). Healthy male volunteers were experimentally exposed during 2 h to vaporized MTBE (5, 25 and 50 ppm, n= 10) or ETBE (0, 5, 25 and 50 ppm, n= 8) in a chamber (whole-body) and 13 C-labeled MTBE (50 ppm, n= 4) via a face-mask. The toxicokinetics of MTBE and ETBE in humans were quite similar, judging from breath, blood and urine profiles. However, the respiratory uptake of MTBE was higher (45 % MTBE and 33 % ETBE) and respiratory exhalation of unmetabolized MTBE was lower (38 % MTBE and 47 % ETBE) compared to ETBE. Linear kinetics was seen for the ethers and TBA up to 50 ppm. Low urinary excretion of unmetabolized ether (<b>tertiary-butyl</b> alcohol (TBA) (13 C-labeled MTBE exposure two urinary metabolites, 2 -methyl- 1, 2 -propanediol and (x-hydroxyisobutyric acid, were characterized by 13 C-NMR. These metabolites were excreted in markedly higher amounts than TBA. A physiologically based toxicokinetic model was developed for ETBE using the determined partition coefficients and data from the chamber exposure. The model indicates that workload has a profound influence on internal dose. TBA excretion seemed to be less sensitive to fluctuations in exposure levels compared to the ether, especially in samples taken at the end of a workshift. Only a small accumulation of ether and TBA in the body was seen throughout a week of repeated exposure. MTBE vapor had very small or no effects up to 50 ppm. After ETBE exposure, elevated ratings of irritation in the throat and airways (50 ppm), and, in addition, minor pulmonary function impairments were seen (25 and 50 ppm ETBE, lung measures not performed for MTBE). This effect as such is not of clinical concern in healthy individuals. However, it cannot be excluded that other subjects may show more severe reactions. In conclusion, the toxicokinetic results as well as considering practical issues (i. e. sampling and analysis), implies that the concentration of TBA in urine is a good biological exposure marker for ether and gasoline vapor. However, further studies of other metabolites that are excreted in higher amounts in the urine (e. g., [alpha]-hydroxyisobutyric acid), may identify even more suitable candidates as biomarkers. The knowledge about the toxicokinetics and acute effects of MTBE and ETBE in humans presented in this thesis is relevant in e. g., risk assessments...|$|E
