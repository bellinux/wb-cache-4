40|$|M. Sc. The Hartbeespoort Dam {{is located}} in the North-West Province, {{downstream}} of the confluence of the Crocodile River and the Magalies River. The dam was originally built for agricultural purposes and the surrounding area has many canals for irrigation. The use of pesticides for agricultural practices within the area which are transported by the canals, are of great concern. It is well known that residues of persistent pesticides (especially those of organochlorine) and insecticides are found in terrestrial and aquatic environments {{as well as in the}} organisms occupying these niches. Such xenobiotics are highly lipid soluble and lengthy exposure to them results in their high accumulation in non-target organisms, all contributing to adverse effects on the ecosystem. The upper Olifants River catchment comprises the drainage areas of the Olifants River, Klein Olifants River and Wilge River, with tributaries down to the Loskop Dam. Over the past few years, the Olifants River has been systematically impaired because of an increase in agricultural and mining activities, industrial development and urbanisation. Recent fish kills in the Loskop Dam has lead to many controversies about the water quality in the Olifants River. The aim of this study was to determine through the use of biomarker responses if it would be possible to identify whether sub-lethal pesticide exposure occurs in fish populations in the Crocodile- and Olifants River systems. Both active biomonitoring (ABM) and passive biomonitoring (PBM) were carried out at selected sites in the Crocodile River system. The ABM technique involved the <b>transplantation</b> <b>of</b> bioindicator <b>organisms,</b> in this case fish, and exposing them for a period of four weeks. The ABM and PBM exposures were carried out during different pesticide spraying regimes, which also coincided with high (summer) and low (winter) flow conditions. Following the exposure period, the organisms were removed and assessed for biological responses (biomarkers). General biomarker responses used in pesticide exposure i. e. acetylcholinesterase (AChE), malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase activity (CAT), protein carbonyls (PC), cellular energy allocation (CEA) and condition factor (CF) were determined. The same suite of biomarkers used in the Crocodile River system was used to determine responses in resident fish species in the Olifants River system...|$|R

During acute liver failure, liver support was achieved temporarily by hepatocyte transplantation in the spleen, by intraperitoneally transplanted microcarrier-attached hepatocytes, and by microencapsulated hepatocytes to equal extents, the microencapsulated hepatocytes being the least effective after 8 h of liver ischemi...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the in vitro and in vivo function of hepatocytes after immortalization, cryopreservation, encapsulation, and xenotransplantation into mice with fulminant liver failure (FLF). METHODS: Rat and human hepatocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion. Human hepatocytes were immortalized using lentiviral vectors. Rat and immortalized human hepatocytes (IHH) were encapsulated in 400 microm of alginate-poly-L-lysine (PLL; Sigma, Buchs, Switzerland) -alginate membranes and cryopreserved using a computerized device. In vitro, encapsulated hepatocytes (cryopreserved or noncryopreserved) were cultured; albumin secretion was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Microencapsulated (cryopreserved or noncryopreserved) hepatocytes were transplanted intraperitoneally to mice with FLF: group 1 (n = 10) <b>transplantation</b> <b>of</b> empty capsules; group 2 (n = 12) <b>transplantation</b> <b>of</b> free primary rat hepatocytes; group 3 (n = 12) <b>transplantation</b> <b>of</b> cryopreserved encapsulated rat hepatocytes; group 4 (n = 10) <b>transplantation</b> <b>of</b> encapsulated rat hepatocytes; group 5 (n = 9) <b>transplantation</b> <b>of</b> cryopreserved encapsulated IHH; group 6 (n = 10) <b>transplantation</b> <b>of</b> encapsulated IHH. RESULTS: Compared with free primary hepatocytes, cryopreserved or noncryopreserved encapsulated rodent hepatocytes showed similar levels of continuous in vitro albumin secretion over 1 week. Cryopreserved or noncryopreserved encapsulated IHH showed minimal albumin secretion compared with free primary human hepatocytes. Fulminant liver failure, produced by a combination of acetaminophen and 30 % hepatectomy, resulted in a 20 % to 30 % host survival. In groups 1 and 2, survival was unmodified, compared with untreated mice. For groups 3 and 4, <b>transplantation</b> <b>of</b> cryopreserved or noncryopreserved encapsulated rat hepatocytes significantly increased survival rates to 66 % and 80 %, respectively (P <. 01). For groups 5 and 6, <b>transplantation</b> <b>of</b> cryopreserved or noncryopreserved encapsulated IHH improved host survival to 50 % and 55 %, respectively (P <. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Primary rodent hepatocytes maintained synthetic functions after encapsulation and cryopreservation. Immortalized human hepatocytes showed minimal albumin secretion in the absence of encapsulation and cryopreservation, suggesting that hepatocytes lose some specific functions after immortalization. After induction of FLF in mice, intraperitoneal <b>transplantation</b> <b>of</b> encapsulated (primary or immortalized, cryopreserved or noncryopreserved) xenogeneic hepatocytes significantly improved survival. These results indicate that naive and genetically modified hepatocytes can be successfully encapsulated, stored by cryopreservation, and transplanted into xenogeneic recipients with FLF to sustain liver metabolic functions...|$|R

The metabolic activity of rat hepatocytes co-microencapsulated with hFLSCs, particularly when engineered to produce bFGF (FLSCs/bFGF), is significantly higher than that of microcapsules with rat hepatocytes alone. Intraperitoneal <b>transplantation</b> <b>of</b> the encapsulated hepatocytes with FLSCs/bFGF increased the survival rate and improved liver function of an ALF mouse model induced by a 70 % partial hepatectomy in BALB/C mice.
