Only Spectravideo and Yamaha briefly marketed MSX machines in the U.S. Spectravideo's MSX enjoyed very little success, and Yamaha's CX5M model, built to interface with various types of MIDI equipment, was billed more as a digital music tool than a standard personal computer.|$|E
25|$|The Socialist Party of America was in <b>the</b> <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{membership}} decline {{throughout the}} decade of the 1920s, the communist left wing of the organization having been suspended, expelled, or split from the organization beginning with the seminal 1919 Emergency National Convention of the party. Dues-paying membership fell during this period from more than 100,000 to less than 10,000. The party's finances were similarly deeply affected and the organization felt pressed to explore new means of reaching an increasingly apathetic public. At its December 1926 quarterly meeting the governing National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party decided to erect a radio broadcasting station as a memorial to its recently deceased co-founder, Eugene V. Debs, who had died in October of the previous year.|$|E
25|$|After training, Lair was {{forwarded}} to the Kingdom of Thailand {{for his first}} assignment, arriving on 1 March 1951. U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Edwin F. Stanton was in <b>the</b> <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> postwar rapprochement between the two nations. Agreements {{between the two countries}} led {{to the beginning of the}} American buildup in Thailand. The aim was to help the Thais block any Communist Chinese incursions through the neighboring Kingdom of Laos. Lair's part in this was an assignment to train the Royal Thai Police. He used an old Imperial Japanese training camp in Hua Hin to train a select crew of Thai police in guerrilla warfare, including parachuting. In the process, Lair discovered he had a knack for getting along with the Thais. His bashfulness, his aversion to eye contact, and quiet courteous demeanor were so congruent with ideal Thai manners that his policemen bonded with him, even though he spoke broken Thai with a Texas twang. He trained with them, and underwent survival exercises with them. He even married a Thai socialite.|$|E

25|$|Lord Hasting was not {{averse to}} {{exploiting}} any commercial opportunities {{that access to}} the Himalayan region might offer. He knew that these would gratify his employers and silence his critics, because the East India Company was {{at this time in}} <b>the</b> <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cash-flow crisis. It needed substantial funds in Britain, in order to pay overheads, pensions, and dividends; but there were problems about remitting the necessary assets from India. Traditionally the Company had bought Indian produce and sold it in London; but this no longer made economic sense. The staple Indian export was cotton goods, and demand for these was declining as home-produced textiles captured the British market. So the Company was having to transfer its assets in another, more complicated and expensive way. It was having to ship its Indian textiles to Canton; sell them on the Chinese market; buy tea with the proceeds; then ship the tea for sale in Britain (all tea at this time came from China. It was not grown in India until the 1840s).|$|E

According to Dallas sportswriter Joe Utay, Texas lost because of overconfidence. Blinkey Horn, sportswriter for The Tennessean, wrote: [...] "Vandy outcharged, outfought, and outgamed the boastful Texans. Their courage was finer. Their stamina was greater.

500|$|By {{the time}} Collier rejoined the Browns, {{the team was}} in <b>the</b> <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> transition. Art Modell had bought the club in 1961 and was locked in a bitter power {{struggle}} with Brown. The two men came into conflict over Brown's autocratic coaching style and his failure to notify Modell about personnel decisions. Without informing Modell, Brown in 1962 traded away star halfback Bobby Mitchell {{for the right to}} draft Ernie Davis, a back who won the Heisman Trophy and surpassed Jim Brown's rushing records at Syracuse University. Davis died of leukemia before he played a down for the Browns. Brown's relationship with Jim Brown, the team's star fullback, was another source of tension between Modell and Paul Brown. Jim Brown grew increasingly independent as he rose to fame. He started a weekly radio show, which grated against Paul Brown's emphasis on discipline and teamwork over individualism. [...] Other players, including quarterback Milt Plum, openly questioned Paul Brown's coaching and his control over the team's play-calling.|$|E

[...] Resham Sengar rated the film 2.5 and questioned the logic behind the script and believed {{that several of the}} scenes either dragged on excessively or were too abrupt, which affected the quality of the entire film. India Today also gave the film a rating of 2.5 stars out of four, and argued that the film was only a success because of its soundtrack, saying that the film [...] "merely banks on the power of saleable music and the novelty of a fresh cast to enable brothers Bhatt, Mahesh and Mukesh, [...] make maximum moolah within minimum budget as they have done all along." ...|$|E

2500|$|Phyllida Lloyd's 2003 {{production}} at Shakespeare's Globe, with an all female cast, starring Kathryn Hunter as Katherina and Janet McTeer as Petruchio. The production emphasised the physicality {{of both the}} comedy and the taming, with McTeer's Petruchio a commanding and domineering figure alongside Hunter's shrinking waif-like Katherina. Katherina's final speech was played in an unusual way. The speech was broken up into separate [...] "beats", with Hunter playing each beat up to a false ending (to the relief of the 'men') only to begin the next beat immediately afterwards (much {{to the chagrin of}} the 'men').

2500|$|Bezanozano society {{reached its}} golden {{age in the}} 18th century, acting as {{intermediaries}} in trade between the Merina in the highlands and the European and Arab slave traders and merchants that landed along the east coast. Occasionally Bezanozano villagers would negotiate directly with French traders; some of these were captured and sold into slavery themselves. This intermediary trading role allowed the Bezanozano to amass considerable wealth in slaves and cattle. Some of this wealth was gained by engaging in slave raids in the communities in the neighboring Kingdom of Imerina, which was then in <b>the</b> <b>throes</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> destabilizing civil war. The town of Moramanga became a major hub of Bezanozano trade. [...] The population of slaves owned by the Bezanozano had grown so large by the mid-18th century that in 1768 a slave rebellion erupted; the Bezanozano solicited the aid of Europeans to put it down. To further strengthen their economic position, the Bezanozano entered into an alliance with the powerful Betsimisaraka Kingdom to the east. They were in regular enough economic relations with Europeans {{that they were able}} to offer Spanish piastres in addition to slaves in exchange for the guns provided by European traders. The villages neighboring Bezanozano territory were in many instances invited to assist in transporting Bezanozano trade goods because the demand for Bezanozano services exceeded the manpower available to satisfy it. In the late 18th century the Bezanozano were spread out over a territory twice the size of the area they consider their homeland today, extending from Angavokely in the west to the Betsimisaraka cliffs to the east, and southward to around twelve kilometers beyond Beparasy. The first and only Bezanozano king, Randrianjomoina, emerged around this time.|$|E
