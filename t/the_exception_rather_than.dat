An example is an encounter with guerrillas in the Kandeya Tribal Trust Lands, north of Mount Darwin, on 19 July 1975. On that day a Territorial Force (TF) unit engaged a group of cadres near a river and killed two without suffering casualties. The nationalist fighters retreated into a defensive ambush position on the banks, beneath the roots of some overhanging trees. The Territorials then summoned a Fireforce made up of 7 and 10 Troops, 2 Commando from Mount Darwin, and on arrival made a sweep of the river line, accompanied by 10 Troop. When the Rhodesians rounded {{a bend in the}} stream the concealed insurgents opened fire, immediately killing a Territorial sergeant and RLI Rifleman Hennie Potgieter. Rifleman Ken Lucas, an FN MAG gunner, suffered a wound to his leg. After the initial burst of fire, the insurgents remained behind their cover and waited, concealed from security force eyes. Judging from the silence and inactivity that the guerrillas had fled, and thinking that the two downed men were still alive, Major Hank Meyer told Lieutenant Joe du Plooy to sweep around the river with two 7 Troop sticks and send a medic out to give treatment.|$|E

Thus, in any effective hazards-mitigation program, a basic strategy in reducing volcano risk is the initiation or augmentation of volcano monitoring at historically active volcanoes and also at geologically young, but presently dormant, volcanoes with potential for reactivation. Beginning with the 1980 s, substantial progress in volcano-monitoring techniques and networks ? ground-based as well space-based ? has been achieved. Although some geochemical monitoring techniques (e. g., remote measurement of volcanic gas emissions) are being increasingly applied and show considerable promise, seismic and geodetic methods to date remain the techniques of choice and are the most widely used. Availability of comprehensive volcano-monitoring data was a decisive factor in the successful scientific and governmental responses to the reawakening of Mount St. elens (Washington, USA) in 1980 and, more recently, to the powerful explosive eruptions at Mount Pinatubo (Luzon, Philippines) in 1991.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{preliminary}} {{discussion of the}} material aspects of globalisation {{in terms of the}} effects on older men and women of movements of trade, capital and people round the world. While some elders have benefited, most notably where pensions and health care are well developed, the majority of older men and women are among the poor who have lost out the world over. Free trade, economic restructuring, the globalisation of finance and the upsurge in migration have all tended to affect elders badly {{in most parts of the}} world. These developments have been overseen or even dictated by intergovernmental organisations (IGOs) such as the International Monetary Foundation (IMF), the World Bank and World Trade Organization (WTO) while other IGOs with less power have been limited to anti ageist exhortation. Globalisation transfers resources from the poor to the rich within countries and between them. It therefore increases social problems but at the same time diminishes the capacity of countries to make social policy. However the effects of globalisation, particularly financial globalisation, on national capacity for making social policy can be exaggerated.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the narrations of past and present among students and professors of social science and history at an Israeli university in Jerusalem. Moreover, the goal is to address the perceived effect and value of encounters between Palestinian and Israeli youth on the university campus. The fieldwork was conducted in Palestine and Israel from August to October 2014. During the fieldwork, 15 semi-structured interviews were carried out with 17 informants – 14 students and 3 professors. This study suggests that the school system has the ability to influence relations between conflicting parts in negative and positive ways. The study further argues that history teaching effects the construction of Palestinian and Israeli social identities, and can thus inflame the conflict by presenting negative and biased images of the other group. Psychological barriers among individuals in Israel and Palestine are crucial for the understanding of the deep-rooted mechanisms in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. By offering different, and multiple narratives of Israel and Palestine, the school system and the academia have the potential to play a vital role in the achieving sustainable solution to the conflict. Findings of the study indicate that the university to a larger extent than primary education presents a variety of narratives of the Israeli and Palestinian past and present. Findings further show that the university avoids presentations of contested political issues. Thus, this seems to be an obstacle and challenge concerning the presence of the Palestinian narrative. The majority of the informants said that the university represented the first time when they could interact with members of the other group in an everyday setting. The study suggests that the encounters between Israeli and Palestinian students at the university can lead to an adjustment of prejudices and negative images of the other. Experiences from a dialogue group for Israeli and Palestinian students organised by the university, show that the university have the potential enabling fruitful encounters between the two groups. Essential for positive outcomes of dialogue seems to be that discrepancies in power relations and social barriers are addressed and discussed during the encounters.

Also, the Cybertron cartoon featured many homages to the Brave series King Of Braves GaoGaiGar, most notably the way Optimus Prime combines with Leobreaker and Wing Saber, which is similar to the way GaoGaiGar combines with Goldymarg (Who coincidentally shares a voice actor with Leobreaker) and Stealth Gao and the fact that Hot Shot was identical to Volfogg because of his appearance and transformation. The cinematography for Energon Optimus Prime's stock-footage combination sequence with his Prime Force limbs is also very reminiscent of Brave series stock footage. Transformers Animated characters Jetstorm and Jetfire's combination into Safeguard is a direct homage to the GaoGaiGar's symmetrical dockers, specifically HyoRyu and EnRyu who form ChoRyuJin who themselves are a homage to Exkaiser characters Blue Raker and Green Raker who combine to form Ultra Raker. Transformers Energon character Omega Supreme is also a homage to the symmetrical dockers. The idea for Team Shinkansen in Car Robots is similar to Liner Dagwon. One striking difference between the Brave Series and Transformers is that very few villain robots were released for the former. This is in sharp contrast to most of the Transformers series, for which heroes and villains were and are released in relatively equal numbers (with <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> of Zone and Battlestars). Generally speaking, the lack of villain toys is more the norm for such toy lines in Japan, with the various Transformers lines (save for aforementioned two) being <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> there <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> rule.|$|R
