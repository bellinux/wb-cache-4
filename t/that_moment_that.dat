500|$|Sheriff Ethan {{is portrayed}} by Mitchell Kosterman in {{seventeen}} episodes spanning seasons one and two. Kosterman's first scene as Ethan came in [...] "Jitters", which was originally {{scheduled to be}} the third episode of season one but was pushed back to eighth. Season one's [...] "Rogue" [...] introduced the idea Sheriff Ethan had a history with Jonathan, and it was <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> Kosterman {{felt like he was}} more than a background image for the show. That history was used against Jonathan in season two's [...] "Suspect", when Ethan framed him for the attempted murder of Lionel Luthor. Ethan's subterfuge was discovered by Clark and Pete, who set up a scheme of their own to bring Ethan's action to light, which resulted in Ethan's surrender and arrest.|$|E

[...] For his various characters, the actor assumed a {{different}} posture for each persona. As the conquistador, Jackman was upright and forward-leaning to evoke an unstoppable nature. As the scientist, the actor hunched over with a dedicated focus on his character's work, being weighed down by the [...] "world on his shoulders."

It was first mentioned by Gaga as a track from her album, Born This Way, Ryan Seacrest's radio show, where she described it as one of her favorite songs from the album. Gaga and Garibay had worked previously on the song [...] "Dance in the Dark" [...] (2009), from Gaga's previous release, The Fame Monster. Before starting work on [...] "Marry the Night", Gaga listened to [...] "Dance in the Dark" [...] and decided she wanted to top that song's energy with her new collaboration with Garibay. [...] "I remember being backstage and hearing the concert start, so I go out there and hear 'Dance in the Dark' open up the whole concert, and I wanted to outdo that feeling. I wanted to outdo <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> opens up the show. I'm just that way." ...|$|E

500|$|Ben Parker's {{wife and}} Peter's aunt. Field said {{the main reason}} {{she felt she had}} to be in the film was because of {{producer}} Laura Ziskin (they worked together on the 1985 film Murphy's Romance) because she had an instinct that this was to be Ziskin's last film. After Ziskin's death Field expressed her gratitude at being a part of both Ziskin's first and last films. Director Webb felt that [...] "when you cast someone like Sally, they come with a certain level of awareness and real genuine affection, which for Aunt May is an incredibly important thing to have."

500|$|It is {{not just}} the women in his life that Lex has a {{difficult}} time maintaining a healthy relationship with, but his father as well. Rosenbaum characterizes the relationship between Lex and Lionel as a form of tug-of-war, and disagrees with John Glover's assessment that Lionel is merely testing Lex for the life he is going to take over. For Rosenbaum, Lex is being pushed and pushed, and Lex is afraid that he will reach the point that he knows he will {{no longer be able to}} come back from. In [...] "Vortex", Lex realizes that he forgot who he was in <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> his father was trapped under the column, and he felt guilty over the situation. According to Rosenbaum, Lex realized that by letting his father die he would have been traveling down a dark path, and would have become all that his father was—evil. As Lex continues to live in his father's shadow, and as time progresses, he learns more about the [...] "monster" [...] that Lionel truly is. The breaking point comes when Lex learns that his father killed Lex's grandparents in a tenement fire. Rosenbaum sees this as the ultimate ethical dilemma—he likens it to parents learning that their child has murdered someone, and then having to decide if they should go to the authorities or not—and Lex, who can no longer take his father's abuse, decides to turn Lionel over to the FBI. According to Rosenbaum, the decision is justified to Lex, who sees that monster that Lionel really is from his actions—using electroshock therapy to erase Lex's memories, drugging Lex, killing his own parents, and the way he treated Lex's mother.|$|E
500|$|Eileen Lulevitch, {{entertainment}} reviewer for TV Guide, {{was generally}} favorable of the episode, writing, [...] "Watching the season premiere tonight was like welcoming {{an old friend}} back into your home. It was so easy to slip back into Grey's world and {{get caught up in}} all of the amazing moments that make this show so much fun to watch. And while I expected the night to start off on a somber note, by addressing Cristina and Burke's fallout, I was pleasantly surprised by the way the attendees paid tribute to Bailey, by giving their new interns the same exact first-day speech Bailey had given them." [...] Lulevtich praised Meredith's story arc, noting the surprising turn her character evolution has taken, as she praised Lexie's introduction. While expressing a negative perspective on the writers' decision to have Torres be the Chief Resident, instead of Bailey, Lulevitch described Torres' adjustment to her new position as one of the episode's focal points. Despite praising Yang's storyline in the personal background, the concept of her interaction with the patient she was assigned to was regarded as predictable and obvious, [...] "When the man's family came to see him, and Cristina told them it could be for the very last time. It was <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> really got Cristina thinking about how much she did in fact miss Burke, as we later learned in the episode." [...] Writing for IGN, Laura Burrows was favorable of the episode. Regarding the storylines developed in [...] "A Change Is Gonna Come", Burrows elaborated, [...] "The season opener was promising in that it had the interns in a new role and introduced a new side of George. As all of his friends progressed from interns to residents, George was forced to re-sit his internship. This created new drama and also opened up the hospital to {{a whole new set of}} interns rife with their own set of emotional baggage and drama. There were a series of interesting and new plots." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bourguiba {{had also}} {{reacted to the}} {{statement}} of Maurice Viollette, governor-general of Algeria, who proclaimed [...] "North Africa {{is an integral part}} of France and that it was impossible for France to abandon a bit of it". 1930 was the peak of French colonization in North Africa, which led France to celebrate the centenary of the French conquest of Algeria, by organizing a eucharistic congress in Tunisia. On this occasion, millions of Europeans invaded the capital city and went to the Saint-Lucien de Carthage cathedral, disguised in crusaders, which humiliated and revolted the people who protested against what they considered, as a violation of an Islam land by Christendom. The protestors, strongly repressed, were brought to Justice and some of had Bourguiba for lawyer, as he did not participate in the event. He also remained neutral when Tahar Haddad was dismissed of his duties of notary. He estimated at <b>that</b> <b>moment,</b> <b>that</b> the main goals were political, while other problems of society are secondary, insisting on the Tunisian personality and identity that had to affirm, declaring: [...] "Let us be what we are before becoming what we will".|$|E
2500|$|The episode [...] "Company Man" [...] {{begins with}} the hostage-taking of the Bennet family by Sprague and Parkman, who are in search of answers.

He is eventually ordered to kill Claude, because Claude apparently was hiding [...] "one of them" [...] from The Company. During the confrontation with Sprague, Thompson comes through the back door and shoots Ted, who goes into an uncontrolled radioactive state. Noah Bennet and Matt escape the house, while Claire tranquilizes Sprague. After this, Matt and Ted are taken to the paper factory.

The episode ends with Noah Bennet taking Claire to the same bridge on which he shot Claude so many years ago. The Haitian shows up, and Bennet instructs the Haitian to shoot him in the stomach, then [...] "Go deep" [...] and wipe anything out of his memory that could lead [...] "them" [...] to Claire.

Lonergan and the other White handers, {{according}} to witnesses, were intoxicated and being unruly to other patrons.

[...] It was at <b>that</b> <b>moment</b> <b>that</b> {{the lights went out}} and gunfire was heard. Customers rushed for the exits in a panic as glass was shattered as well as tables and chairs being overturned. As police arrived, they found one of Lonergan's men, his best friend Aaron Harms, dead in the street and they followed a blood trail into the club where they found Lonergan and drug addict Cornelius [...] "Needles" [...] Ferry on the dance floor near a player piano shot execution style. A fourth member, James Hart, managed to escape, having been found a few blocks away crawling on the sidewalk after being shot in the thigh and leg. He was taken to the Cumberland Street Hospital where he eventually recovered but refused to cooperate with police. He denied being at the club claiming he had been shot by a stray bullet from a passing car. The two other members, Joseph [...] "Ragtime Joe" [...] Howard and Patrick [...] "Happy" [...] Maloney, were apparently unaccounted for leaving no witnesses willing to testify.
