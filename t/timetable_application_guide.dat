40|$|Vertex {{colouring}} is {{a well-known}} problem in combinatorial optimisation, whose alternative integer programming formulations have recently attracted considerable attention. This paper briefly surveys seven known formulations of vertex colouring and introduces a formulation of vertex colouring using a suitable clique partition of the graph. This formulation is applicable in <b>timetabling</b> <b>applications,</b> where such a clique partition of the conflict graph is given implicitly. In contrast with some alternatives, the presented formulation can also be easily extended to accommodate complex performance indicators (``soft constraints'') imposed {{in a number of}} real-life course <b>timetabling</b> <b>applications.</b> Its performance depends {{on the quality of the}} clique partition, but encouraging empirical results for the Udine Course Timetabling problem are reported...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Real world <b>timetabling</b> <b>applications</b> {{are usually}} diverse in their problem structures, {{constraints}} and algorithms used. We {{have developed an}} object oriented timetabling framework that adapts to varied problem structures, and allows for easy and flexible maintenance of timetabling algorithms and constraints. We use the Unified Modelling Language for problem structure representations and Object Constraint Language for constraint expressions. The model is easier to understand as compared to mathematical formulations and results in coherent development from problem specification to software constructions. We also describe an application that we have instantiated from this framework. ...|$|R

Today the database involves records of traffic connections between individual municipalities of the Czech republic through the use of public transport for periods suitable for current commutation. Connections are chosen based on several criteria from the list of connections searched out by the <b>Timetables</b> <b>application</b> of the CHAPS spol. s. r. o. company. The database is used for searching job vacancies accessible by public transport from the place of residence on an information portal and also from agents at employment offices, the next utilization is e. g. in the area of assessment of investment projects in a department of labour market analyses.

40|$|Agent {{technology}} promises {{possibilities for}} the design of distributed systems, the design of open systems and the reduction of information overload for the users. <b>Timetabling</b> <b>applications</b> must operate in heterogeneous environments at large organisations where users cannot be bothered with all the details influencing their work schedules. It is a domain where, at least at the system level, many separately developed systems must interact. In this paper, we investigate how agent technology can play a part in <b>timetabling</b> <b>applications.</b> <b>Timetabling</b> problems are distributed by nature but performance also contributes to the distributiveness. The performance issues are related to the complexity of the timetabling problem and the need to respond within a limited time. The problem becomes distributed when departments of a different speciality are interconnected and have to gear their timetables to one another. Timetabling systems must be open systems since they have to interact with existing software. Data are stored in databases; business systems may contain relevant information. The results of the timetabling operations must be fed back to these information providers because these systems ultimately control the operations. Timetabling systems need as much detail as possible while they must report on the resulting timetable to users with a limited scope. Both channels must be guarded against information overload. The user should not be prompted to specify information which he has not available and he should not be confronted with information he cannot interpret. On the other hand the system should try to understand what the user really wants and comment on the results in an accessible way to the user. The three mentioned key issues in timetabling systems are competences for which software agents are particularly appropriate. We review the available technology for distribution, interconnection and information overload and report on some experiments...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} thesis {{is to provide a}} Joint Deployable Intelligence Support System (JDISS) Communication and Imagery <b>Application</b> <b>Guide</b> for New Users. These two applications, together, are the core of the JDISS program. Both applications were examined to identify functions and processes that are difficult to understand as well as functions and processes that lack sufficient instructions for new users. The supporting JDISS Desktop and Utilities applications were added to provide the knowledge base required for the new user to use the <b>Application</b> <b>Guide</b> as a stand-alone document. Other JDISS applications, such as Office Tools, E-mail, Intelink, etc., are not included due, in part, to a common thread with other programs that the new user should already be familiar with, but mostly due to the adequate help instructions readily available within the JDISS main desktop help function. The JDISS program was developed to ensure that each of the U. S. Services and Agencies had an integrated intelligence system, and one that would provide a common data standard permitting interoperability both intra-service and inter- service. The Joint Staff, Director of Intelligence (J 2), has highlighted JDISS in joint doctrine as the principal intelligence component for interoperability (JBOC, 1996). Therefore, this detailed, step-by-step JDISS Communication and Imagery <b>Application</b> <b>Guide</b> for New Users was developed and designed to help future JDISS users worldwide.
