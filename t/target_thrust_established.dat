5000|$|The small {{sword is}} {{considered}} to be a descendant of the [...] "transition rapier", which itself evolved from the rapier due to the demand for a lighter sword better suited to parrying. The shape of a colichemarde blade features a wide forte, which abruptly tapers to a much narrower form at a point varying between a fifth to a third of the blade length from the hilt. The blade cross section was most often triangular and hollow-ground. This configuration combines good parrying characteristics, due to the wide blade forte, with the good maneuverablity and thrusting characteristics imparted by the narrow blade foible. Its lighter weight, shorter length and superior balance, compared to the rapier, allowed faster and more accurate movement of the blade.

The innovative thrust reverser configurations consisted of a cascade thrust reverser with porous fan-duct blocker, a blockerless thrust reverser, two core-mounted <b>target</b> <b>thrust</b> reversers, a multi-door crocodile thrust reverser, and a wing-mounted thrust reverser.

40|$|Nuclear {{propulsion}} {{has been}} identified as one of the key technologies needed for human exploration of the Moon and Mars. The Nuclear Thermal Rocket (NTR) uses a nuclear reactor to heat hydrogen to a high temperature followed by expansion through a conventional convergent-divergent nozzle. A parametric study of NTR nozzles was performed using the Rocket Engine Design Expert System (REDES) at the NASA Lewis Research Center. The REDES used the JANNAF standard rigorous methodology to determine nozzle performance over a range of chamber temperatures, chamber pressures, thrust levels, and different nozzle configurations. A design condition was set by fixing the propulsion system exit radius at five meters and throat radius was varied to achieve a <b>target</b> <b>thrust</b> level. An adiabatic wall was assumed for the nozzle, and its length was assumed to be 80 percent of a 15 degree cone. The results conclude that although the performance of the NTR, based on infinite reaction rates, looks promising at low chamber pressures, finite rate chemical reactions will cause the actual performance to be considerably lower. Parameters which have a major influence on the delivered specific impulse value include the chamber temperature and the chamber pressures in the high thrust domain. Other parameters, such as 2 -D and boundary layer effects, kinetic rates, and number of nozzles, affect the deliverable performance of an NTR nozzle to a lesser degree. For a single nozzle, maximum performance of 930 seconds and 1030 seconds occur at chamber temperatures of 2700 and 3100 K, respectively...|$|R

Sandia Labs is conducting a proof-of-concept project with Delta Air Lines, Lockheed Martin, Textron, and the FAA which seeks to remove any remaining obstacles to the approved use of composite doublers.

Tension-tension fatigue and residual strength tests attempted to grow engineered flaws in coupons with composite doublers bonded to aluminum skin. Also, structures which modeled key aspects of the door corner installation were subjected to extreme tension, shear, and bending loads. In this manner it was possible to study strain fields in and around the Lockheed-designed composite doubler using realistic aircraft load scenarios and to assess the potential for interply delaminations and disbonds between the aluminum and the laminate.

The design equations of the SLIM and the equivalent circuit model are studied and discussed in detail. A SLIM of specified parameters is designed using a user-interactive MATLAB program, and then compared to a similar tubular linear induction motor (TLIM). The SLIM equations and design procedures are developed and its performance is predicted using equivalent circuit models. End effects and edge effects are neglected in this study. The SLIM design algorithm is made completely user-interactive where the user has the convenience of choosing various design parameters like the primary voltage and frequency, number of poles, number of phases and many more.

Recent advances in silicon microfabrication technology allow the possibility of designing high-precision mechanical devices for power conversion. Micro gas turbine engines (microengines) are one particular application of this technology. These tiny jet engines have immediate application as propulsion systems for Micro UAVs Other envisioned applications include portable electrical power generation for commercial, consumer, and military uses A microengine-based power or propulsion system could offer more than 10 x {{the performance of a}} battery of the same weight. This would make it an enabling technology for longduration portable computers, high-power mobile phones, and other portable power applications. This thesis describes an assessment of the aerodynamic, thermodynamic, and manufacturing issues associated with the design, development, and microfabrication of an all-silicon demonstration microengine. The design goal is the simplest feasible engine that can demonstrate the micro gas turbine engine concept. This demo microengine integrates high-speed, low Reynold's number turbomachinery, high-speed micro gas bearings, a compact hydrogen combustor, and an innovative turbine cooling scheme into a quartersized turbojet engine with a <b>target</b> <b>thrust</b> of 10 grams. Due to the scale of the device {{and the nature of the}} microfabrication process, the engine components are tightly coupled and the design involved a number of system trades not normally encountered in conventional engines. This thesis addresses several of these key design trades and identifies thermo-structural design and manufacturing constraints as the two principal limitations on current microengine design. The thesis also discusses the fabrication development effort and results culminating in a micro turbocharger that has been tested to speeds of up to 30, 000 RPM. Rotor imbalance was identified as the probable limit on current operation. Recommendations for future work include development of advanced turbine cooling schemes to improve device efficiency and development improved fabrication capabilities to reduce rotor imbalance. by Jonathan M.
