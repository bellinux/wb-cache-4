5|$|Pliny {{addresses}} {{magic in}} Book XXX. He {{is critical of}} the Magi, attacking astrology, and suggesting <b>that</b> <b>magic</b> originated in medicine, creeping in by pretending to offer health. He names Zoroaster of Ancient Persia {{as the source of}} magical ideas. He states that Pythagoras, Empedocles, Democritus and Plato all travelled abroad to learn magic, remarking that it was surprising anyone accepted the doctrines they brought back, and that medicine (of Hippocrates) and magic (of Democritus) should have flourished simultaneously {{at the time of the}} Peloponnesian War.|$|E
5|$|Some {{critics and}} historians argue that one {{characteristic}} of the Silver Age was that science fiction and aliens replaced magic and gods. Others argue <b>that</b> <b>magic</b> was {{an important element of}} both Golden Age and Silver Age characters. Many Golden Age writers and artists were science-fiction fans or professional science-fiction writers who incorporated SF elements into their comic-book stories. Science was a common explanation for the origin of heroes in the Silver Age.|$|E
5|$|A 2004 {{article in}} USA Today {{suggested}} that playing Magic might help improve {{the social and}} mental skills {{of some of the}} players. The article interviewed players' parents who believe that the game, similar to sports, teaches children how to more gracefully win and lose. Magic also contains a great amount of strategy and vocabulary that children may not be exposed to on a regular basis. Parents also claimed that playing Magic helped keep their children out of trouble, such as using illegal drugs or joining criminal gangs. On the other hand, the article also briefly mentions <b>that</b> <b>Magic</b> can be highly addictive, leading to parents worried about their children's Magic obsession. In addition, until 2007, some of the better players had opportunities to compete for a small number of scholarships.|$|E

5|$|Although modern fantasy {{may often}} embrace strangeness, the Ice and Fire series is {{generally}} praised {{for what is}} perceived as a sort of medieval realism. Believing <b>that</b> <b>magic</b> should be used moderately in the epic fantasy genre, Martin set out to make the story feel more like historical fiction than contemporary fantasy, with less emphasis on magic and sorcery and more on battles, political intrigue, and the characters. Though the amount of magic has gradually increased throughout the story, the series is still to end with less overt magic than most contemporary fantasies. In Martin's eyes, literary effective magic needs to represent strange and dangerous forces beyond human comprehension, not advanced alien technologies or formulaic spells. As such, the characters understand only the natural aspects of their world, but not the magical elements like the Others.|$|E
5|$|Connor {{appears in}} the Family Reunion arc of Angel & Faith. Willow, on a quest to restore magic to herself and the world asks Angel and Faith to travel from London to LA with her so she can use the {{residual}} magic in Buffy's scythe and Connor's connection to Quor'toth to reopen the tear in reality at the Hyperion Hotel {{to get to a}} dimension that has magic. Angel & Faith agree to this in order to gain the piece of Giles's soul in the scythe, but will only help reopen the tear and go to Quor'toth if Connor agrees to it. Connor is living a normal life as a college student studying social work with a girlfriend. Though initially disappointed Angel ignored his attempts to contact his father, Connor is glad to have Angel in his life and realizes that his normal life is precious, but he still wants Angel {{to be a part of}} it. Angel is genuinely proud of the man his son has become. Connor agrees <b>that</b> <b>magic</b> needs to be returned to the world as the most vulnerable in society are already starting to lose hope without it.|$|E

25|$|Reviewer Dale Arnold of the Baltimore Science Fiction Society {{suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>magic</b> {{has real}} political and societal {{impact in the}} Emberverse, {{whether or not it}} is actually the result of supernatural force or merely religious delusions, because the characters act as if it were real.|$|E

25|$|Diversified {{instruments}} or rituals used {{in medieval}} magic include, {{but are not}} limited to: various amulets, talismans, potions, as well as specific chants, dances, prayers. Along with these rituals are the adversely imbued notions of demonic participation which influence of them. The idea <b>that</b> <b>magic</b> was devised, taught, and worked by demons would have seemed reasonable to anyone who read the Greek magical papyri or the Sefer-ha-Razim and found that healing magic appeared alongside rituals for killing people, gaining wealth, or personal advantage, and coercing women into sexual submission. Archaeology is contributing to a fuller understanding of ritual practices performed in the home, on the body and in monastic and church settings.|$|E
25|$|Regina and Emma {{are looking}} for Henry and Violet in Boston, but they have lost the tracker because as Henry left his phone on the bus, as he knew Emma placed the GPS tracker app on it.

They also {{discover}} <b>that</b> <b>magic</b> can work outside of Storybrooke, as Henry has taken the crystal and the magic. Regina then uses a needle on Emma's bloody finger on the map where to find Henry and Violet, leading them to New York City.|$|E

Cinderella, however, knocks him out and takes the motorcycle once she's been shown how it works, with Henry chasing her. At the same time, Lady Tremaine is about to set off for the palace, having clipped the Fairy Godmother's wings and taken her wand. When questioned why she is doing this, she explains to Drizella <b>that</b> <b>magic</b> has no power compared to fear, a point she drives home by destroying the Fairy Godmother.|$|E

Our framework integrates cognitive and quantitative evaluation methods and features three standards that reflect current practice in the Cardiothoracic Intensive Care Unit (CTICU). Using experimental design to compare human-generated and machine-generated briefings, we show <b>that</b> <b>MAGICâ€™s</b> current level of performance is useful. Moreover, MAGIC could help improve information flow in the CTICU by providing a consistent set of information earlier than in current practice. The separate standards are also consistent in suggesting specific modifications that may be necessary for iterative design and further system development...|$|R
25|$|In {{the first}} century CE, the idea of magic was then absorbed by early Christian authors, who {{incorporated}} it into their developing Christian theology. They retained the Graeco-Roman negative connotations of the term and enhanced them by incorporating conceptual patterns borrowed by Jewish thought. Thus, for early Christian writers like Augustine of Hippo, magic was not merely fraudulent and unsanctioned ritual practices, {{it was the very}} opposite of religion because it relied upon cooperation from demons, the henchmen of Satan. Ever since, the idea <b>that</b> <b>magic</b> is something defined in opposition to religion has been pervasive throughout Western culture. Christian theologians believed that there were multiple different forms of magic, the majority of which were types of divination. For instance, Isidore of Seville listed geomancy, hydromancy, aeromancy, and pyromancy as forms of magic alongside enchantment and ligatures.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{extent to}} which the secrecy and {{isolation}} of the wizarding world is maintained varies. Many references are made to the Ministry of Magic performing memory charms to preserve secrecy; however, some Muggles have necessary interactions with the wizarding world. Hermioneâ€™s parents are Muggles, but have been seen in Diagon Alley. They are fully aware <b>that</b> <b>magic</b> exists, but they forbade Hermione to use magic to fix her teeth (as dentists, they felt that this was cheating). The Dursleys are also aware of the Wizarding World; Petunia Dursley indicates that she learned of it when her sister, Lily, was accepted for Hogwarts. She shared this information with her husband, who is shown to be contemptuous of the wizarding world even before Harry shows up at their doorstep. There is no indication that Dudley was aware of this until Harry is told about Hogwarts.|$|E

Before the Test series he helped Essex force the follow on against Kent in the County Championship but faltered with his team, scoring only 4 in the second innings to lose by 192 runs. After the Test series, Cook was omitted from the one day side leaving him free to play for Essex. He joined them in their bid to defend their Friends Provident Trophy matching Varun Chopra's 65 in a 124 run partnership against Lancashire to gain {{a place in the}} semi-final.
