5|$|Cloud Gate is {{described}} as a transformative, iconic work. It is similar to many of Kapoor's previous works in the themes and issues it addresses. While the sculpture's mirror effects are reminiscent of fun-house fairground mirrors, they also have a more serious intent; they help dematerialize this very large object, making it seem light and almost weightless. Cloud Gate is considered Kapoor's most ambitious use of complex mirrored form dynamics. Kapoor challenges his viewers <b>to</b> <b>internalize</b> his work through intellectual and theoretical exercise. By reflecting the sky, visiting and non-visiting pedestrians and surrounding architecture, Cloud Gate limits its viewers to partial comprehension at any time. The interaction with the viewer who moves to create his own vision gives it a spiritual dimension. The sculpture {{is described}} as a disembodied, luminous form, which is also how his earlier 1000 Names (197980) was described when it addressed the metaphysical and mystical.|$|E

A total of 461 young adolescents, 13 to 14 years old (M = 13. 4; SD =. 44), 234 boys and 227 girls, completed self-reporting measures of detachment, parental support, and internalizing and externalizing problems. Data showed that detachment was related positively <b>to</b> <b>internalizing</b> problem behaviors.

However, bacterial toxins, such as diphtheria toxin, which is used in denileukin diftitox, an FDA-approved treatment for leukemia and lymphoma, have proven to be more practical. A promising approach for ricin is to use the non-toxic B subunit (a lectin) as a vehicle for delivering antigens into cells, thus greatly increasing their immunogenicity. Use of ricin as an adjuvant has potential implications for developing mucosal vaccines.|$|E
25|$|Congenital amusia, {{commonly}} known as tone deafness, refers to a musical disability that cannot be explained by prior brain lesion, hearing loss, cognitive defects, or lack of environmental stimulation, and it affects about 4% of the population. Individuals who suffer from congenital amusia seem to lack the musical predispositions with which most people are born. They are unable to recognize or hum familiar tunes {{even if they have}} normal audiometry and above-average intellectual and memory skills. Also, they do not show sensitivity to dissonant chords in a melodic context, which, as discussed earlier, is one of the musical predispositions exhibited by infants. The hallmark of congenital amusia is a deficit in fine-grained pitch discrimination, and this deficit is most apparent when congenital amusics are asked to pick out a wrong note in a given melody. If the distance between two successive pitches is small, congenital amusics are not able to detect a pitch change. As a result of this defect in pitch perception, a lifelong musical impairment may emerge due to a failure <b>to</b> <b>internalize</b> musical scales. A lack of fine-grained pitch discrimination makes it extremely difficult for amusics to enjoy and appreciate music, which consists largely of small pitch changes.|$|E

25|$|Fiscal {{efficiency}} is separate from economic efficiency. Economic analysis of recycling {{does not include}} what economists call externalities, which are unpriced costs and benefits that accrue to individuals outside of private transactions. Examples include: decreased air pollution and greenhouse gases from incineration, reduced hazardous waste leaching from landfills, reduced energy consumption, and reduced waste and resource consumption, {{which leads to a}} reduction in environmentally damaging mining and timber activity. About 4,000 minerals are known, of these only a few hundred minerals in the world are relatively common. Known reserves of phosphorus will be exhausted within the next 100 years at current rates of usage. Without mechanisms such as taxes or subsidies <b>to</b> <b>internalize</b> externalities, businesses may ignore them despite the costs imposed on society. To make such nonfiscal benefits economically relevant, advocates have pushed for legislative action to increase the demand for recycled materials. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has concluded in favor of recycling, saying that recycling efforts reduced the country's carbon emissions by a net 49 million metric tonnes in 2005. In the United Kingdom, the Waste and Resources Action Programme stated that Great Britain's recycling efforts reduce CO2 emissions by 10–15 million tonnes a year. Recycling is more efficient in densely populated areas, as there are economies of scale involved.|$|E

Results: In line with our model, autonomy-connectedness (self-awareness and capacity of managing new situations) was strongly associated <b>to</b> <b>internalizing</b> PDS in both groups. In both groups, neither sex nor autonomy-connectedness predicted externalizing PDS.

40|$|Traditional peer victimization and {{electronic}} peer victimization are concerning public health issues that relate <b>to</b> <b>internalizing</b> symptoms.

Since digital media is such a pervasive social context among youth today, there is a clear demand to examine how it shapes well-being and peer relations. Findings have shown that social support often serves as a protective factor in the faces of stressors like peer victimization. However, very little research has examined exactly how peer victimization???s relation with internalizing symptoms is shaped by social support. Even less research has explored how digital media influences these relations. The current study found that social support found online and offline mediated the relation between peer victimization and internalizing symptoms.

2500|$|Shyness is {{most likely}} to occur during {{unfamiliar}} situations, though in severe cases it may hinder an individual in their most familiar situations and relationships as well. Shy people avoid the objects of their apprehension in order to keep from feeling uncomfortable and inept; thus, the situations remain unfamiliar and the shyness perpetuates itself. [...] Shyness may fade with time; e.g., a child who is shy towards strangers may eventually lose this trait when older and become more socially adept. This often occurs by adolescence or young adulthood (generally around the age of 13). In some cases, though, it may become an integrated, lifelong character trait. Longitudinal data suggests that the three different personality types evident in infancy easy, slow-to-warm-up, and difficult tend to change as children mature. Extreme traits become less pronounced, and personalities evolve in predictable patterns over time. What has been proven to remain constant is the tendency <b>to</b> <b>internalize</b> or externalize problems. This relates to individuals with shy personalities because they tend <b>to</b> <b>internalize</b> their problems, or dwell on their problems internally instead of expressing their concerns, which leads to disorders like depression and anxiety.

40|$|Introduction: Internalized HIV stigma {{is a key}} {{risk factor}} for {{negative}} outcomes amongst adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV), including non-adherence to anti-retroviral treatment, loss-to-follow-up and morbidity. This study tested a theoretical model of multi-level risk pathways <b>to</b> <b>internalized</b> HIV stigma among South African ALHIV. Methods: From 2013 to 2015, a survey using total population sampling of ALHIV who had ever initiated anti-retroviral treatment (ART) in 53 public health facilities in the Eastern Cape, South Africa was conducted. Community-tracing ensured inclusion of ALHIV who were defaulting from ART or lost to follow-up. 90. 1 % of eligible ALHIV were interviewed (n =  1060, 55 % female, mean age =  13. 8, 21 % living in rural locations). HIV stigma mechanisms (internalized, enacted, and anticipated), HIV-related disability, violence victimization (physical, emotional, sexual abuse, bullying victimization) were assessed using well-validated self-report measures. Structural equation modelling {{was used to test}} a theoretically informed model of risk pathways from HIV-related disability <b>to</b> <b>internalized</b> HIV stigma. The model controlled for age, gender and urban/rural address. Results: Prevalence of internalized HIV stigma was 26. 5 %. As hypothesized, significant associations between internalized stigma and anticipated stigma, as well as depression were obtained. Unexpectedly, HIV-related disability, victimization, and enacted stigma were not directly associated with internalized stigma. Instead significant pathways were identified via anticipated HIV stigma and depression. The model fitted the data well (RMSEA = . 023; CFI = . 94; TLI = . 95; WRMR =  1. 070). Conclusions: These findings highlight the complicated nature of internalized HIV stigma. Whilst it is seemingly a psychological process, indirect pathways suggest multi-level mechanisms leading <b>to</b> <b>internalized</b> HIV stigma. Findings suggest that protection from violence within homes, communities and schools may interrupt risk pathways from HIV-related health problems to psychological distress and internalized HIV stigma. This highlights the potential for interventions that do not explicitly target adolescents living with HIV but are sensitive to their needs...|$|R

40|$|Background: Parental {{divorce is}} related <b>to</b> <b>internalizing</b> and externalizing {{problems}} {{in children and}} adolescents. However, family structure has become more diverse over time. There is little understanding about how family structure relates <b>to</b> <b>internalizing</b> and externalizing. Therefore, this study includes married, cohabited, divorced and decohabited families. Purpose: The aim {{of the study is}} to clarify the relation between family structure and internalizing and externalizing problems, the role of gender, and quality of the parent-child relationship. Methods: This study includes 6821 Dutch adolescents in the age of 12 to 18 at a large representative group of secondary schools. Data were collected in six consecutive years via a cross-sequential design. These data consist of self-report questionnaires of adolescents about individual and family functioning. Results: Adolescents from divorced families show significantly higher levels of internalizing problems than adolescents from married, cohabitated, and decohabitated families. Adolescents from decohabitated families show significantly higher levels of externalizing problems than adolescents from married families. Furthermore, gender significantly interacts with family structure for internalizing problems. An indication for a (partial) mediation effect has been found for the quality of the parent-child relationship between family structure and internalizing and externalizing problems. Conclusion: Parental divorce is related <b>to</b> more <b>internalizing</b> problems in adolescents and parental decohabitation is related to more externalizing problems in adolescents, compared to adolescents with married parents. These relations could be partially mediated via the quality of the parent-child relationship and gender is related to the type of problem behavior...|$|R
