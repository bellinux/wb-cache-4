The current carrying conductor is fixed {{on the top of the}} <b>tank</b> <b>lining</b> up with the magnet. When the level of fuel rises, an increasing magnetic field is applied on the current resulting in higher Hall voltage. As the fuel level decreases, the Hall voltage will also decrease.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{focuses on}} the {{behavior}} of structural adhesives used in <b>tank</b> <b>lining</b> applications. The experimental program addresses the fundamental material properties and bond characteristics of adhesives when subjected to normal and severe environmental conditions. A total of 132 adhesive and CPVC tension coupons were examined under severe environmental exposure to determine the influence of these conditions on the tensile strength. Double-lap shear tests were conducted to evaluate the shear strength of the adhesive using fifty CPVC-to-steel specimens. The overall composite behavior of the proposed lining for steel tanks was investigated using three small-scale test specimens to simulate the conditions of a typical <b>tank</b> <b>lining.</b> The specimens were subjected to extreme temperature changes to examine the thermal gradient distribution and the composite interaction of the CPVC liner to the steel wall. Research findings provide better understanding of the performance of adhesives when subjected to severe environmental conditions and different sustained load levels...|$|E

40|$|Non-metallic {{tanks are}} used in {{industry}} to store and transfer gasses such as methane. As the tanks are emptied, {{the properties of the}} gas change, causing heat transfer with the tank wall. When emptied while at low temperatures, liquid condensation can form and the <b>tank</b> <b>lining</b> can reach a critically low temperature, causing fracture to the tank wall. In this study, the emptying of methane in cold weather conditions from a non-metallic tank was modelled using Aspen Tech Software. A full tank of methane, at 250 bar and 288 K, was cooled to the following starting temperatures: 263, 253, 243, 233, and 223 K. Additionally, three different mass flows were used, 0. 300, 0. 119, and 0. 064 kg/s. The study included heat transfer with the tank and the environment. Results of the simulations indicated that at a mass flow rate of 0. 300 kg/s, and a starting temperature of 223 K, the methane approached and followed the saturation line, signifying risk of liquification. At all other starting temperatures, the methane did not reach the saturation line. Additionally, at lower mass flow rates and all starting temperatures, the methane did not reach the saturation line. Further simulations could be conducted at lower temperature ranges to determine the point at which methane crosses the saturation line...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. Establishing {{change the}} basic {{structural}} and functional {{characteristics of the}} sediments {{under the influence of}} waste going fish farming in tanks. Methodology. Bottom sediment samples were collected using a 1 m of dirt tube (SOI- 1), according to the standard requirements. Water-physical properties of sediments were investigated in accordance the recommendations of B. Novikov (1985) and A. Denisova et al. (1987). Determination of the gross content of organic matter carried by loss after calcining. Oxygen consumption in sediments was studied by the method V. І. Romanenko and V. A. Romanenko (1969). Determination of the amount of sediments, which are formed from waste fish farming, carried out in two different ways: by calculating the income from tanks suspended solids and by direct determination of the sediment under the tanks. Findings. Was established that intensive fish farming waste flow predetermines a significant (up to 4) increase the organic matter content. Thus, even 2 years after the reduction of volumes of fish farming tanks and even remove volumetric mass of the skeleton to the initial values of deposits are not refundable. The concentration of organic substances in the zone of the <b>tanks</b> <b>lines</b> causes increased intake of dissolved oxygen, which leads to deterioration in gas mode, especially in the bottom layers of water and may cause suffocation situations.
