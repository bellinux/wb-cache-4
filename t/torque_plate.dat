40|$|Parts with a {{functional}} micro contour or a micro structure {{are needed in}} {{a large number of}} applications. Manufacturing process with a geometrically defined cutting edge are usually rare for such applications. Reasons for this are limited dynamics and accuracy of the existing machine tools. An example of use is the compensation of elastic deformations in cylinder crankcases due to fastening of cylinder head bolts during theirs assembly and general operating conditions. Under unoptimized conditions this results in non-circular cylinder bores, also sometimes called a four-leafed clover owing to its similarity. In the state of the art, <b>torque</b> <b>plates</b> are used during the honing operation to compensate the deformations or a novel method - called form honing - is applied.

This enables a decrease in processing time of cylinder crankcases and in manufacturing more complex and more precise cylinder contours. The spindle support consists of eight high volt piezo actuators in a differential arrangement around a flexure, in whom the spindle is fastened. The flexure itself allows three degrees of freedom (jx, jy, z) for displacement of the HSC-spindle.

40|$|The {{buoyancy}} of lithospheric slabs in subduction zones {{is widely}} thought {{to dominate the}} <b>torques</b> driving <b>plate</b> tectonics. In late Cretaceous and early Paleogene times, the Indian plate moved more rapidly over the mantle than freely subducting slabs sink within it. This signal event {{has been attributed to}} arrival of the Deccan–Réunion mantle plume beneath the plate, but it is unknown in which proportions the plume acted to alter the balance of existing <b>plate</b> driving <b>torques</b> and to introduce torques of its own. Our plate kinematic analysis of the Mascarene Basin yields a detailed Indian plate motion history for the period 89 – 60 [*]Ma. Plate speed initially increases steadily until a pronounced acceleration in the period 68 – 64 [*]Ma, after which it abruptly returns to values much like those beforehand. This pattern is unlike that suggested to result from the direct introduction of driving forces by the arrival of a thermal plume {{at the base of the}} plate. A simple analysis of the gravitational force related to the Indian plate's thickening away from its boundary with the African plate suggests instead that the sudden acceleration and deceleration may be related to uplift of part of that boundary during a period when it was located over the plume head.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to design and analyze the {{carrying}} structure of a multiple air gap generator for tidal turbine application. An initial patent pending electromagnetic design was provided by SmartMotor AS. Electromagnetic values, such as forces from the rotor-stator interaction, were given by SmartMotor. The final product is a 3 D-model of the generator with dimensions and shape based on required power output, production and assembly limitations and static and eigenmode simulations. The multiple air gap principle allows for a more compact generator, as there are several layers - in the radial direction - of rotors (magnets) and stators (windings) instead of one set of rotor and stator. A generator normally uses a gearbox to increase power output. This however increases maintenance and introduces more friction losses. By using multiple air gaps, the generator can potentially maintain {{the same size and}} power output while eliminating the gearbox. The multiple air gap principle, as well as some basic electromagnetic theory, was discussed to give an insight in the planned generator. A requirement specification was set, with the most important ones being a power output of 1. 1 MW and a maximum outer diameter of 3 m. The rotor has 132 magnets in each layer and the stator 144 teeth, creating a varying force between the rotor and the stator. The air gap in each layer is initially 5 mm, and the forces increase if the air gap gets smaller. To evaluate different solutions for the carrying structure, the generator was broken down into smaller parts. Several design ideas were evaluated and discussed with engineers at SmartMotor. The chosen design was influenced especially by deformation and production/cost demands. Complex shapes become expensive and difficult to produce when the total diameter is above two meters. Instead it is used <b>torque</b> <b>plates</b> to counteract the torque forces and radial plates to counteract the bending from the radial forces. The most challenging parts to produce are the rings, which both the stator and rotor active parts are mounted to. These have to be casted due to its large size. The chosen design was modeled and analyzed for deformations and stresses in UGS NX 7. 5. To reduce simulation time and the complexity of the model, the stator, rotor and rings were simulated separately. Some simplifications and assumptions had to be done, but always on the conservative side. The results from the static simulations showed that increasing the axial length and decreasing the diameter resulted in a stiffer structure. The rotor and stator structure were also analyzed for eigenfrequencies in UGS NX, and it was these simulations which set the final dimensions for the generator structure. The final generator has an outer diameter of 2. 32 m, a total length of 2. 035 m (excluding bearings) and uses 4 air gap layers. The total weight was estimated to 25. 4 tons. A step-by-step description of the generator assembly was presented. Finally possible sources of error in the simulations and further work on the generator were discussed...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} we {{consider}} the separated flow of an inviscid fluid around a moving flat plate. The motion of the plate, which is initially started from rest, is prescribed and unconstrained and we set ourselves the task of fully characterizing the resulting motion in the surrounding fluid. To do this we use a boundary integral representation for the complex-conjugate velocity field Φ(z,t) and require that the force and <b>torque</b> on the <b>plate</b> be determined {{as part of the}} solution. The flow solution is assumed to consist of a bound vortex sheet coincident with the plate and two free vortex sheets that emanate from each of the plate's two sharp edges. The time evolution of these vortex sheets is then considered in general. For physical reasons, the flow solution is required to satisfy the unsteady Kutta condition, which states that Φ(z,t) must be bounded everywhere, and the rigorous imposition of this condition then yields two types of additional constraint. The first governs the rate at which circulation is shed from the plate's edges and the second ensures that the free vortex sheets are shed tangentially. In fact, all the familiar flow characteristics associated with the imposition of the steady Kutta condition are rigorously shown to have exact parallels in the unsteady case. In addition, explicit expressions for the normal force and <b>torque</b> on the <b>plate</b> are derived. An asymptotic solution to the full system of evolution equations is developed for small times t > 0 and a simplified version of this solution is used as an initial condition for a desingularized numerical treatment of the full problem. A fast numerical algorithm is proposed and implemented and the results of several example calculations are presented. The featured examples are limited to high effective angles of attack due to the occurrence of a specific type of event that prevents further time-integration of the evolution equations using the current numerical method. The event corresponds physically to a situation in which a Lagrangian point placed at one of the plate's edges moves onto instead of away from the edge...|$|R

The rich dynamical behavior, such as fluttering and tumbling motion, was analyzed. However, obvious discrepancies between the experimental measurement and numerical simulations still exist. In the current study, a similar numerical computation will be conducted using a newly developed moving mesh method for the viscous flow. In order to clarify some early conclusions, both elliptic and rectangular falling plates will be studied. Under the experimental condition, the numerical solution shows that the averaged translational velocity for both rectangular and elliptical plates are almost identical during the tumbling motion.

In terms of smoothness and refinement, the V4 and the rotary were like chalk and cheese compared to the turbine quality of the rotary engine, but what the V4 did provide was dependability, an increase in torque and an improvement in fuel consumption. Later the Ford V6 was tried but needed body modifications, was thirsty and didn't quite have the right handling balance.|$|R
40|$|International audienceAttempts {{to explore}} the {{dynamics}} of convergent boundaries are essentially based on the confrontation of the observed kinematics to the intrinsic dynamic properties of subduction zones. Which often mismatch. On {{the basis of the}} mantle flow model of Conrad and Behn (2010), I explore the role of the often neglected basal drag that the flowing mantle exerts underneath each plate. After computing the total <b>torque</b> underneath each <b>plate,</b> I find that (i) the net torque due to basal drag systematically drives plates away from their ridges and towards subduction zones, conformably to the plate circuit; (ii) compressive zones are found where the net drag forces from upper and lower plates are converging, and diverging for extensive zones; (iii) trench migration is dictated by the difference between the upper plate drag force and lower plate drag force. In other words, trenches advance where upper plates pulls the subduction zones and the lower plate pushes it. These results indicate that differences in the dynamics of plate boundaries arise from the global mantle circulation more than the from the local properties of subduction zones. The often neglected drag force thus appears crucial to reconcile the kinematics and dynamics of subduction zones...|$|R

In off-road heavy-duty vehicles, along with fuel efficiency start-up functionality at extended ambient conditions, such as low temperature and intake absolute pressure are crucial. Off-road vehicle manufacturers can overcome the parasitic loads in these conditions by oversizing the engine. Caterpillar Inc. as the pioneer in off-road technology has developed a novel clutch design to allow for engine downsizing while vehicle’s performance is not affected. The tribological behaviour of the clutch will be crucial to start engagement promptly and reach the maximum clutch capacity in the shortest possible time and smoothest way in terms of dynamics. A multi-body dynamics model of the clutch system is developed in MSC ADAMS. The flywheel is introducing the same speed and torque as the engine (represents the engine input to the clutch). The hydraulic pressure is applied behind the piston to initiate the engagement. The angular motion of the plates is supported by friction <b>torque</b> between the <b>plates</b> and friction linings. The conjunctions between paper-based linings and steel plates {{are designed to be}} dry. Friction (the most significant tribological feature of the linings in torque transmission) is measured in a pin-on-disc tribometer and mapped into the dynamics model in MSC ADAMS. The pin-on-disc tribometer is able to capture the variation of friction coefficient with contact pressure and sliding velocity. The surface topography is obtained experimentally to examine the consistency of surface properties.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{a new set}} of finite {{rotations}} describing the relative motion of the Pacific and North America plates during the last 10 m. y., incorporating recently published studies of the Pacific‐Antarctic, Antarctic‐Africa, and Africa‐North America plate boundaries is presented. These finite rotations show that changes have occurred in Pacific‐western North America motion at 2. 48 Ma and between 3. 40 and 3. 9 Ma, resulting in increased compression along the Pacific‐North America plate boundary. The most significant change in relative motion was of the latter age. During this change the predicted motion of the Pacific plate along the California coast changes from transform to transpressive, due to a clockwise rotation of the relative convergence vector by 12 °. This timing of the onset of transpression agrees well with a variety of geologic data along the California plate boundary, including the onset of compressive deformation in onshore and offshore sedimentary basins, formation of reverse faults and anticlines (which are parallel to strike‐slip faults of the previous, more westerly directed azimuth of relative motion), a change in the orientation of the San Andreas fault, and formation of a set of new, more northerly trending strike‐slip faults. In this model this change in relative motion is caused by a change in the absolute motion of the Pacific plate, due to the detachment of a slab beneath the Fiji Basin between 3. 4 and 3. 9 Ma. The detachment of this slab and the resultant change in overall Pacific <b>plate</b> <b>torque</b> resulted in a noncollisional “orogeny” along the California plate boundary. This study shows that minor adjustments in the motion of large oceanic plates, such as the Pacific plate, can have profound consequences on the preserved geologic record.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the transient relaxation of a Discontinuous Shear Thickening suspension of cornstarch in water. We performed 2 types of relaxation experiments starting from a steady shear {{in a parallel}} plate rheometer, followed by either stopping the top plate rotation and measuring the transient torque relaxation, or removing the <b>torque</b> on the <b>plate</b> and measuring the transient tool rotation. We found that at low weight fraction ϕ_eff< 58. 8 ± 0. 4 %, the suspensions exhibited a relaxation behavior consistent with a generalized Newtonian fluid. However, for larger weight fraction 58. 8 % < ϕ_eff < 61. 0 %, near the liquid-solid transition ϕ_c= 61. 0 ± 0. 7 %, we found relaxation behaviors different from the generalized Newtonian model. The relaxation time in this range scales with the inverse of the critical shear rate {{at the onset of}} shear thickening. In this range the relaxation time was the same in both stress and rate controlled experiments, rather than the viscosity calculated from the relaxation time which is expected to be intrinsic material parameter in the generalized Newtonian model. The discrepancy between the measured relaxation times and the generalized Newtonian prediction was found to be up to 10 ^ 4, and extrapolations diverge in the limit of ϕ_c as the generalized Newtonian prediction approaches 0. At the highest weight fractions, the relaxation time scales were measured to be on the order of ∼ 1 s. The fact that this timescale is resolvable by the naked eye may be important to understanding some of the dynamic phenomenon commonly observed in these systems. We also showed that using the critical shear rate γ̇_c at the onset of shear thickening to characterize the effective weight fraction can more precisely characterize material properties near the critical point ϕ_c, allowing us to resolve this transition so close to ϕ_c.

40|$|The new {{paradigm}} of plate tectonics began in 1960 with Harry H. Hess's 1960 realization that new ocean floor was being created today and is not everywhere of Precambrian age as previously thought. In the following decades an unprecedented coming together of bathymetric, topographic, magnetic, gravity, seismicity, seismic profiling data occurred, all supporting and building upon the concept of plate tectonics. Most investigators accepted the premise {{that there was no}} net <b>torque</b> amongst the <b>plates.</b> Bowin (2010) demonstrated that plates accelerated and decelerated at rates 10 − 8 times smaller than plate velocities, and that globally angular momentum is conserved by plate tectonic motions, but few appeared to note its existence. Here we first summarize how we separate where different mass sources may lie within the Earth and how we can estimate their mass. The Earth's greatest mass anomalies arise from topography of the boundary between the metallic nickel–iron core and the silicate mantle that dominate the Earth's spherical harmonic degree 2 and 3 potential field coefficients, and overwhelm all other internal mass anomalies. The mass anomalies due to phase changes in olivine and pyroxene in subducted lithosphere are hidden within the spherical harmonic degree 4 – 10 packet, and are an order of magnitude smaller than those from the core–mantle boundary. Then we explore the geometry of the Emperor and Hawaiian seamount chains and the 60 ° bend between them that aids in documenting the slow acceleration during both the Pacific Plate's northward motion that formed the Emperor seamount chain and its westward motion that formed the Hawaiian seamount chain, but it decelerated {{at the time of the}} bend (46 Myr). Although the 60 ° change in direction of the Pacific Plate at of the bend, there appears to have been nary a pause in a passive spreading history for the North Atlantic Plate, for example. This, too, supports phase change being the single driver for plate tectonics and conservation of angular momentum.
