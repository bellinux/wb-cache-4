The design specifications were extracted according to the constraints of high data rate wireless sensor devices. Reactive tuning <b>through</b> <b>slot</b> loading was applied to enforce degeneration of a higher resonance, and thus double the bandwidth in the band of interest. Three slotted antenna configurations are reported plus a baseline configuration; a thorough numerical characterisation of performance is provided. Fractional bandwidth (FBW) in the range 22 – 34 % was achieved, which is almost quadruple that of existing implementations. The antennas exhibit total efficiencies around 80 % and are elliptically polarised. A suitable figure-of-merit is suggested for performance comparisons; it attempts to capture overall antenna performance in a single quantity. Antenna performance depends heavily on electrical size, which depends {{on the size of}} the ground plane, since the RF ground is an integral part of the total radiator. The ground-effect study showed that wrong choice of size can force resonant modes to vanish.

40|$|Stream {{discharge}} <b>through</b> <b>slot</b> canyons {{is potentially}} a {{significant source of}} groundwater recharge in the arid Southwest. However, these canyons are normally dry except during flash floods, making stream velocity nearly impossible to measure. The discharge could be estimated using the empirical Manning Equation, which requires only the channel geometry, water depth, slope of the stream surface, and an empirically-derived roughness coefficient. The objective of this research was to develop an empirical formula for calculating the Manning roughness coefficient n for flow <b>through</b> <b>slot</b> canyons by carrying out the first measurements of n in slot canyons. Stream discharge was measured at 13 slot canyon sites on tributaries of the Escalante, Paria and Virgin Rivers in southern Utah that are fed by perennial streams, springs or dam outlets. Based on these measurements, the best estimate for the Manning roughness coefficient n is n =(0. 871 ± 0. 269) n_J exp[(4. 38 ± 0. 72) B] where B is the aspect ratio defined as B = A/w^ 2, where A is cross-sectional area and w is width, and n_J = 0. 39 S^ 0. 38 R^(- 0. 16) is the roughness coefficient estimated by Jarrett (1984) for high-gradient streams (S 3 ̆e 0. 002), in which S is slope of the water surface and R is hydraulic radius (ft).

The algorithm stems from the finding that the shortest delivery time or delay is obtained when the load is semi-equalized throughout the network.

Moreover, through extensive simulations, the performance of Local Voting is further investigated in comparison with several representative scheduling algorithms from the literature. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves better performance than the other distributed algorithms in terms of average delay, maximum delay, and fairness. Despite being distributed, the performance of Local Voting is also found to be very close to a centralized algorithm that is deemed to have the optimal performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{link between}} {{regulation}} and efficient price structures has been recognised in general, {{though it has}} been little analysed {{in the context of}} busy airports.

Slot allocation issues are discussed extensively- while they are very important, the equally important issue of price structures has been relatively ignored. Many countries are privatising their airports, and subjecting them to regulation. However, the issue of how regulation will affect the allocation of capacity is rarely explored. Price regulation constrains the overall levels of prices an airport may charge. Thus, it may not be feasible to rely entirely on prices to ration capacity efficiently. However, the structure of prices will impact on capacity allocation; for example, structures which include higher prices at peaks may perform more efficiently than others. Likewise, when runway capacity is at a premium, uniform prices for all flights at a point of time will be preferable t...|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes latency {{and energy}} {{efficient}} flexible TDMA (LEFT), a {{medium access control}} (MAC) combined with routing protocol for data gathering from number of source nodes to a master station (MS) in a wireless sensor network (WSN). TDMA provides fairness, collision-free communication and reduces idle listening, which saves network energy. Data latency is reduced by allocating same transmission slots to nodes falling out of interference range of each other. Unlike a conventional TDMA, LEFT provides flexibility <b>through</b> <b>slot</b> seizing, wherein a non-holder of a slot can use slot when holder does not have data to send. This increases channel utilization and adaption to dynamic traffic patterns of WSN applications. Further, a node on a multi-hop path towards MS decides to participate in routing based on (i) its location with respect to MS, to forward data in correct direction, (ii) its current status of residual energy, to uniformly distribute energy across network, (iii) its transit traffic load, to prevent local congestion, (iv) its communication link quality, to guarantee reliable data delivery. This decision requires simple comparisons against thresholds, and thus is very simple to implement on energy, storage and computationally constrained nodes. LEFT also encompasses techniques to cater to link and node breakdowns. Experimental analysis of LEFT; Advertisement-based TDMA; Data gathering MAC; Energy Efficient Fast Forwarding and Cross layer MAC protocols using TI's EZ 430 -RF 2500 T nodes shows that LEFT is 65 % more energy efficient compared to Cross layer MAC. Data latency of LEFT is 27 % less, delivery ratio is 17 % more and goodput is 11 % more compared to Cross layer MAC...|$|E
40|$|Investigations on the abiotic {{stresses}} {{in plants}} consist {{in the identification}} of genes involved in the defence response and analysis of the mechanisms regulating their activity. The aim of the present works was to study the differential gene expression induced by cold stress in olive (Olea europaea L.) plants. Cold tolerance in plants is not constitutive, but it is induced by a prolonged exposition at low temperatures. The choice of the biological material is due to the economic relevance that this plant occupies in the Mediterranean country. Since the best quality of olive oil is derived from plants growing in regions frequently subjected to hard-frost (for instance, in Tuscany), it was necessary to set up advanced methodologies for the selection of resistant cultivars. For this purpose, it is necessary to use molecular markers isolated from resistant plants for nursery selection. Molecular biology methodologies were used in order to isolate genes involved in cold-induced tolerance processes in Olea europaea cultivars. In order to systematically isolate and study the involved genes we used the PCR-based cDNA subtraction method, termed suppression subtractive hybridisation (SSH) for generation of subtracted cDNA libraries from tolerant plants, both in control and cold treated material. This powerful method can achieve greater than 1, 000 time enrichment for differentially expressed cDNAs. Samples of Olea europaea L. cv. Leccino, tolerant to low temperatures, were used. This material was selected from plants survived in Tuscany after very low temperature exposition in the year 1985. The clones were cultured for two years in controlled conditions. Control samples were kept in a mean temperature of 25 °C; cold stressed samples were treated with decreasing temperatures till to - 10 °C. RNAs were extracted from control (25 °C) and cold treated (- 10 °C) plants and used for the construction of reverse and forward cDNA libraries, that allow the identification of genes that are switched on/off after the treatments. Forward and reverse libraries are constituted respectively of sequences expressed and suppressed or diminished after the stressing treatment. The system allowed the rapid identification of differentially expressed genes. Selected cDNA clones were sequenced and analysed using the FASTA, BLASTX and BLASTN programmes. The expression levels of the sequences corresponding to the isolated clones were evaluated <b>through</b> <b>slot</b> blot and Northern blot of the total RNA from treated and control materials and the subsequent hybridisation using as labelled probes the selected clones...|$|E
40|$|IDENTIFICATION AND REGULATION OF INTERCELLULAR SIGNALLING IN THE OVIDUCT EPITHELIUM THAT CONTROL MUCOCILIAR TRANSPORTATION IN PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PATHOLOGICAL CONDITIONS Mucus is a {{polymeric}} gel {{that covers}} diverse mucous surfaces. It is a secretion {{made up of}} water, ions, proteins, small molecules and mucins. Mucins are glycoproteins stored in secretion granules, which are hydrated during their exocytosis and form the mucus, a macromolecular matrix with specific rheological properties. MUC 5 AC and MUC 513 are the main mucins in human respiratory mucus. The oligomerization of these proteins {{is the cause of}} their high molecular weight (1 - 40 MDa) and their characteristic structural complexity. Between 60 % and 80 % of the mass in polymers of mucins is composed of 0 -glycan chains whose insertions are concentrated in the protein’s central region. Nowadays it is known that through a prolonged caesium chloride (CsCl) density gradient ultracentrifugation, mucins separate from each other and from other proteins according to their differences in flotation densities. This parameter is also related to the size and biosynthetic state of mucins. One of the objectives proposed by the doctoral thesis that is being developed in parallel to the research stay informed herein was to study the structure and behaviour of MUC 5 AC and MUC 513 in solution, purified from cells in culture. The purpose of this research stay was to purify MUC 5 AC and MUC 513 mucins from primary cultures of human respiratory epithelium. Biological material collected from primary cultures of nasal epithelium in guanidinium chloride (GndCl) 4 M final was used. Conditional culture environments were centrifuged in a density gradient of CsCI 14 MGuHCI, with an initial density of 1. 4 g/mL for 70 hrs. The presence of MUC 5 AC and MUC 513 was determined in the diverse fractions of the CdCl/GuHCl gradient formed (total fractions= 18). The presence and the biochemical characteristics of each mucin were determined <b>through</b> <b>slot</b> and Western blot. A battery of specific antibodies aiming at different regions of each mucin was used. It was observed that both mucins were secreted by primary cultures, where MUC 5 AC was more abundant than MUC 513. No differences were observed in the electrophoretic migration patterns for each mucin. Differences were identified, however, in the intensity of the signal. The mature form of MUC 5 AC appeared strongly between fractions 11 to 15 (1. 33 – 1. 40 g/mL). Nevertheless, there was a poor mark observed for MUC 513 between the fractions 13 to 15 (1. 35 – 1. 40 g/mL). Moreover, less polymeric forms were observed for both mucins, which showed a greater electrophoretic mobility between the fraction 1 to 5 (1. 20 – 1 – 1. 26 g/mL). These results are consistent with the previously described characteristics of the different biosynthetic states of the mucins and suggest that from fractions 11 to 15 {{it will be possible to}} obtain MUC 5 AC and MUC 513 in native state. The final purification state of mucins, related to the separation between them, will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Sheehan after the necessary biological material has been collected and delivered.

Good agreement of theoretical predictions with experimental data shows that the model {{can be applied to the}} filtration of deformable droplets <b>through</b> <b>slotted</b> pore membranes.

At lower interfacial tension (5 mN/m), with the same flux rate, 100 % rejection occurred at 10 μm droplet diameter using the same membrane. It was also found that the droplet rejection efficiency below the 100 % cut-off was roughly linear with drop size, down to zero rejection at zero drop diameter.

5000|$|At low {{angles of}} attack the airflow <b>through</b> the <b>slot</b> is insignificant, {{although}} {{it contributes to}} drag. At progressively higher angles of attack, the flow of air <b>through</b> the <b>slot</b> becomes increasingly significant, accelerating from the higher pressure region below the wing to the lower pressure region {{on top of the}} wing. At high angles of attack the fastest airspeed relative to the airfoil is very close to the leading edge, on the upper surface. In this region of high local airspeed, skin friction (viscous force) is very high and the boundary layer arriving at the slot on the upper wing has lost much of its total pressure (or total mechanical energy) due to this friction. In contrast, the air passing <b>through</b> the <b>slot</b> has not experienced this high local airspeed or high skin friction, and its total pressure remains close to the free-stream value. The mixing of the upper surface boundary layer with air arriving <b>through</b> the <b>slot</b> re-energises the boundary layer which then remains attached to the upper surface of the wing to a higher angle of attack than if the slot were not there.
