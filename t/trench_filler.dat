40|$|An in-situ {{moisture}} sensor intended {{to measure the}} moisture content of cable <b>trench</b> <b>filler</b> material is described. The design of the unit, which has been built to integrate with existing data monitoring systems allowing remote interrogation and enabling real-time decisions {{to be made on}} circuit loading safety margins, is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The minimum trench edge {{termination}} {{length for}} various trench depth is theoretically determined to obtain universal curve for efficient design under considering trade-off relation with trench fabrication difficulty, cost and limitation specially for thin wafer IGBTs and diodes. This study unveils {{for the first}} time clear relationship between trench depth and termination length. We present practical design for each trench depth based on design curve considering <b>trench</b> <b>filler</b> material. 2012 24 th International Symposium on Power Semiconductor Devices and ICs (ISPSD 2012), June 3 - 7, 2012, Bruges, Belgiu...|$|E
