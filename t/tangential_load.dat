There are many parameters that influence the fretting fatigue phenomenon out of which relative displacement, δ, normal load, nF, and <b>tangential</b> <b>load</b> tF, {{are the most important}} and consequently the most studied ones. This paper describes the fretting fatigue phenomenon occurring on a high strength aluminium alloy, Al 7175.

The composite consists of many cylindrical shell cells for which a unit cell is fabricated from polyester and glass woven fabrics and epoxy. FBG sensors are bonded {{on the surface of}} the cells.

40|$|The stick-to-slip {{transition}} of a fingertip {{in contact with}} a planar surface does not occur instantaneously. As the <b>tangential</b> <b>load</b> increases, portions of the skin adhere while others slip, giving rise to an evolution of the contact state, termed partial slip. We develop a quasi-static model that predicts that if the coefficient of kinetic friction {{is larger than the}} coefficient of static friction, then the stuck surface area diminishes as the <b>tangential</b> <b>load</b> increases until reaching a ‘minimal adhesion surface area ’ where it vanishes abruptly. This phenomenon was observed in recently measured finger-slip image data (André et al., 2011) that were processed by an optic flow detection algorithm. We examined the results of ten trials.

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} {{was to develop a}} {{validated}} numerical model for the prediction of static friction of metallic contacts. This model included the real surface topography acquired using a 3 -D optical profilometer. The DC-FFT algorithm, a novel numerical method to calculate the stress components of any element in the contact area was used to predict the maximum <b>tangential</b> <b>load</b> the contact can withstand before sliding. The calculated <b>tangential</b> <b>load</b> and external normal load were used to estimate the static friction coefficient at the contact interface. The model was experimentally validated using data obtained with a specially designed test rig. The validated model was used to investigate the effects of various surface patterns on the static friction coefficient. Preliminary results showed that certain dimple patterns can reduce the static friction coefficient by up to 30 %. It is anticipated that the findings of this project will enable development of compact and efficient design of machine components whose operation is currently limited by friction at start- up. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{buckling}} of {{an elastic}} plate with arbitrary shape flush-mounted on a rigid wall and deforming under {{the action of}} a uniform <b>tangential</b> <b>load</b> due to an overpassing simple shear flow is considered. Working {{under the auspices of}} the theory of elastic instability of plates governed by the linear von Kármán equation, an eigenvalue problem is formulated for the buckled state resulting in a fourth-order partial differential equation with position-dependent coefficients parameterized by the Poisson ratio. The governing equation also describes the deformation of a plate clamped around the edges on a vertical wall and buckling under the action of its own weight. Solutions are computed analytically for a circular plate by applying a Fourier series expansion to derive an infinite system of coupled ordinary differential equations and then implementing orthogonal collocation, and numerically for elliptical and rectangular plates by using a finite-element method. The eigenvalues of the resulting generalized algebraic eigenvalue problem are bifurcation points in the solution space, physically representing critical thresholds of the uniform <b>tangential</b> <b>load</b> above which the plate buckles and wrinkles due to the partially compressive developing stresses. The associated eigenfunctions representing possible modes of deformation are illustrated, and the effect of the Poisson ratio and plate shape is discussed...|$|E

Method: A brief review of the literature and relevant texts relating to the application of the mechanical concept of follower and <b>tangential</b> <b>loads</b> to the spine and the chiropractic concept of the vertebral subluxation was undertaken to determine common factors and inter-related components. Results: Relevant information from the literature relating to follower and <b>tangential</b> <b>loading</b> of the spine, vertebral subluxations and manipulation was correlated and synthesised into a model describing normal spinal mechanics and the loss of mechanical integrity of the spine. The model was developed as a theoretical basis for the chiropractic concept of the vertebral subluxation and as a mechanical rationale for spinal manipulation. Three key components were identified that were common to follower and <b>tangential</b> <b>loads,</b> subluxations and manipulation of the spine and were incorporated into the model. These involved active components, passive elements and feedback mechanisms previously described by Panjabi. Conclusion: The mechanical concepts underlying <b>tangential</b> <b>loading</b> of the spine have been applied to the chiropractic concept of the vertebral subluxation and spinal adjustment.

40|$|International audienceWe {{examine the}} energy {{partitions}} among elastic waves due to dynamic normal and tangential surface loads in a semi-infinite elastic solid. While {{the results for}} a dynamic normal load {{on the surface of}} a half-space with Poisson ratio of 1 / 4 is a well-known result by Miller and Pursey (1955), the corresponding results for a dynamic <b>tangential</b> <b>load</b> are almost unknown. The partitions for the normal and tangential loads were computed independently by Weaver (1985) versus Poisson ratio (0 ≤ν≤ 1 / 2), using diffuse-field concepts within the context of ultrasonic measurements. The connection with the surface load point was not explicit, which partially explains why these results did not reach the seismological and engineering literature. The characteristics of the elastic radiation of these two cases are quite different. For a normal load, about 2 / 3 of the energy leaves the loaded point as Rayleigh surface waves. On the other hand, the <b>tangential</b> <b>load</b> induces a similar amount in the form of body shear waves. It is established that the energies injected into the elastic half-space by concentrated normal and tangential harmonic surface loads are proportional to the imaginary part of the corresponding components of the Green's tensor when both source and receiver coincide. The relationship between the Green's function and average correlations of motions within a diffuse field is clearly established...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRecently the {{interest}} in developing vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs) for offshore application has been increasing. Among the aerodynamic models of VAWTs, double multi-streamtube (DMST) and actuator cylinder (AC) models are two favorable methods for fully coupled modeling and dynamic analysis of floating VAWTs in view of accuracy and computational cost. This paper deals {{with the development of}} an aerodynamic code to model floating VAWTs using the AC method developed by Madsen. It includes the <b>tangential</b> <b>load</b> term when calculating induced velocities, addresses two different approaches to calculate the normal and tangential loads acting on the rotor, and proposes a new modified linear solution to correct the linear solution. The effect of dynamic stall is also considered using the Beddoes-Leishman dynamic stall model. The developed code is verified to be accurate by a series of comparisons against other numerical models and experimental results. It is found that the effect of including the <b>tangential</b> <b>load</b> term when calculating induced velocities on the aerodynamic loads is very small. The proposed new modified linear solution can improve the power performance compared with the experiment data. Finally, a comparison of the developed AC method and the DMST method is performed using two rotors and shows that the AC method can predict more accurate aerodynamic loads and power than the DMST method, at least for the considered rotors...|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} and experimental approach {{was used to}} perform a systematic analysis to find the optimal parameters of a textured surface {{for the purpose of}} reducing the coefficient of static friction. A textured surface implies using laser, mechanical, or in this case chemical means to produce regularly shaped and spaced depressions (or dimples) in metallic contacts. This research focused on high load metallic contact, such as in a hydraulic gerotor or geroler displacement machine. The theoretical approach used a DC-FFT algorithm to estimate the <b>tangential</b> <b>load</b> required to initiate motion between two real surfaces, the topography of which was acquired by a 3 -D optical profilometer. Mathematical means were used to superimpose a textured surface on one of the surfaces. Once the <b>tangential</b> <b>load</b> was calculated, it was divided by the external normal load to predict the coefficient of static friction. These results were compared with experimental results measured by a specifically designed test rig. The test rig was originally developed by Jose Garcia, and modified for flat contacts. The results of both experimental and theoretical approaches imply that a higher area density of dimples produces a lower coefficient of friction, but that other variables such as depth and width of dimples do not follow such a clear trend. The experimental approach also suggests that the presence of lubricant tends to increase the coefficient of static friction for textured surfaces, perhaps due to increased adhesion. ...|$|E
