Maurice and Lyda sit by the fire, holding hands, saying that they almost had the two agents. Meanwhile, at Mulder's apartment, Mulder and Scully exchange gifts, even though they told each other they would not.|$|E
5|$|The 33-foot {{cast iron}} spiral {{staircase}} from 1871 was repaired and restored {{for the cost}} of $15,724. The work was done by Conservation Services and they uncovered and preserved the numbering of <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> <b>In</b> October 2010, a major restoration project repainted the tower and lantern, installed ventilated steel doors, restored the original weathervane and repaired the 12-pane casement window on the west wall of the lighthouse. The work was completed in March 2011 after it was suspended due to poor weather in December 2010; the total cost was $121,000.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins with}} scenes of Brown wearing a {{mirrored}} mask inside a giant birdcage, before {{switching to a}} dance routine in a smoke-filled, graffiti-covered parking garage. In between these scenes, the video shows a Step Up-type dance-off in the parking garage. When Brown raps his verse, he is seen standing next to Rhymes, wearing horn-rimmed glasses, a red Brooklyn cap, and a white baseball jersey, which was the signature look of Mars Blackmon from the 1986 film, She's Gotta Have It. Rhymes then raps his verse after Brown's, standing beside him and later on <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>in</b> the parking garage. Wayne's verse soon follows after, with scenes of him rapping {{in front of the}} DeLorean DMC-12 sports car, and also on top of an ambulance car. The video also features cameo appearance from Kevin McCall, Diplo, Birdman and Mack Maine. Birdman and Maine appear when Lil Wayne is performing his verse.|$|E

25|$|Lastly, {{almost every}} {{fighting}} scene has a middle point {{which has a}} strong effect on combat. On a ship, this is the flight of stairs leading from the poop deck or forecastle onto the main deck. In a tavern, this is the balcony and the stairs leading up to it. If a combatant has been pushed {{all the way to}} the middle point, a cut scene will show the two combatants moving past the obstacle. On a ship, they run down or up <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> <b>In</b> a tavern, the enemy will be knocked down the gallery, and the player will run up the stairs. This has the effect of giving time for the advantage bar to swing back to the neutral position, equalizing the fight somewhat during this cut scene.|$|E
25|$|RichardII {{was imprisoned}} at the Tower of London and abdicated there in 1399; {{according}} to tradition, the event {{took place in}} the White Tower. In the 1490s a new floor was added to the White Tower, creating extra storage. Architecturally virtually no trace remains of the White Tower's forebuilding, although it appears in a manuscript drawing circa 1500 depicting the imprisonment of Charles, Duke of Orléans and was recorded in a plan of 1597. It was demolished in 1674. On 17June that year, {{during the course of the}} demolition, bones belonging to two children were discovered beneath <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>in</b> the forebuilding. It was assumed that they belonged to the Princes in the Tower. The remains were re-interred in Westminster Abbey. The story of the Princes in the Tower is one of the most infamous stories related to the castle. After the death of EdwardIV his 12-year-old son was crowned as EdwardV. Richard Duke of Gloucester was declared Lord Protector while the prince was too young to rule. Edward was confined to the Tower of London along with his younger brother, Richard. The Duke of Gloucester was proclaimed King RichardIII in July. The princes were last seen in public in June 1483; the most likely reason for their disappearance is that they were murdered late in the summer of 1483.|$|E

25|$|After Mickey dies in 2010, Maggie {{begins a}} new {{friendship}} with Victor Kiriakis. The two grow closer, despite Victor's marriage to Vivian Alamain. The vengeful Vivian plots to have Maggie entombed in a crypt in the Kiriakis mausoleum, but as fate has it, ends up there herself. When Vivian is freed, {{she manages to}} entrap Maggie, and for days, her relatives are worried about her absence. Eventually, Victor finds her and she is rushed to the hospital. Maggie is stunned when she discovers that Victor knew Vivian was entrapped and did nothing about it. After Victor demands a divorce from Vivian, he begins to court Maggie. She struggles to accept Victor and his criminal past, but is able to build a relationship with him. Maggie and Victor begin to date and Victor proposes to Maggie in September 2011. During their engagement, Hope comes across a letter from Alice to Maggie, written the day before Alice died. Alice reminds Maggie about an experimental program she and Mickey entered into over thirty years prior, Maggie had attempted to harvest some of her eggs. Eventually she and Mickey abandoned the project, though the eggs were preserved. It was revealed that Daniel Jonas was her biological son, a product of these missing eggs. This also makes Melanie Layton her granddaughter. On November 8, 2011, Victor and Maggie get married. That Christmas Julie tells Maggie that she {{will always be a}} member of the Horton family, and extends an ornament to Victor, Daniel, and Melanie, despite their not being biological Hortons. In 2012, Maggie and Victor experience brief marital trouble when it is revealed that Victor knew about Maggie's missing eggs all those years. Maggie was eventually able to forgive him although she continues to keep him in line when his ruthless ways get the better of him. Maggie also said goodbye to Melanie, who left town. Additionally, Maggie opened her home to her nephew, Nick Fallon, Marie's grandson, who was recently paroled. Though Maggie has a new husband, son, granddaughter, and home, she is considered to be the matriarch of the Horton Family and still maintains a relationship with the members of the Horton family.In February 2016 her son Daniel Jonas was injured in a car accident that also injured Eric Brady, Brady Black and Jennifer Horton. He eventually dies from his injuries and Maggie makes the decision to take Daniel off Life Support and donate his heart to her Step-Grandson Brady. Maggie's life began to get more complicated when a young woman named Summer showed up in Salem and informed her that she was the child Maggie had when she was only 17 and had believed to be stillborn. In the middle of all of this, Victor's estranged brother, Deimos, showed up, vowing revenge against Victor. He poisoned Maggie with pills that caused her to have dizzy spells. After one serious dizzy spell, Maggie fell down <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>in</b> the Kiriakis mansion, was rushed to the hospital, where Victor was informed that not only had she broken her back, but that her legs were once again paralyzed, like they had been when she had first met Mickey. Victor learned that Deimos had poisoned her and had an antidote which he would give Maggie on the condition that Victor turn all his assets over to him. Determined to save Maggie from instant death, Victor agreed. Maggie's recovery seemed more psychological than physical, but with support from her husband and the Horton's, Maggie became encouraged to fight to walk once again, and Victor declared his determination to stand by her in her time of need, even deciding to retire from Titan to devote all of his time to her.|$|E
500|$|According to Hitchcock, {{a series}} of shots with Arbogast going up <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>in</b> the Bates house before he is stabbed were helmed by {{assistant}} director Hilton A. Green, working with storyboard artist Saul Bass' drawings only while Hitchcock was incapacitated with the common cold. However, upon viewing the dailies of the shots, Hitchcock was forced to scrap them. He claimed they were [...] "no good" [...] {{because they did not}} portray [...] "an innocent person but a sinister man who was going up those stairs". Hitchcock later re-shot the scene, though a little of the cut footage made its way into the film. Filming the murder of Arbogast proved problematic owing to the overhead camera angle necessary to hide the film's twist. A camera track constructed on pulleys alongside the stairway together with a chairlike device had to be constructed and thoroughly tested over a period of weeks.|$|E
500|$|Madeline Parker {{was cast}} as Kacey Brynn. Parker's {{performance}} impressed the producers, as they {{believed she was}} [...] "one of the better child actors" [...] they ever worked with, since casting them, especially at a younger age, was not easy. The one problem they had with Parker however, was filming her lying injured on <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> <b>In</b> the scene where the NCP arrest civilians at night, {{the idea of using}} night vision, which did not come from the original script, came from director Sergio Mimica-Gezzan. Real night scopes were used to ensure the authenticity of the effect. One of the main visual effects of the episode was another suicide bombing which was caught on camera. Moore stated to have [...] "tortured the visual effects guys about [...] quite a bit," [...] because the camera footage was in black and white and the visual quality of the explosion had to be degraded to match the footage.|$|E

500|$|In another instance, a scene {{called for}} Garland {{to exit the}} saloon, jump on a horse, and ride out of town. When the scene was shot, Garland jumped over the horse instead of on it, so the scene had to be shot again. During the second take, she twisted her ankle running down <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>in</b> the saloon, but {{continued}} the scene. When Garland returned home, {{she thought it would}} feel good to put her ankle in a warm bath and did. She left it there for about an hour, but when she took it out, she found that it had swollen to twice its normal size. When she returned to the set, Corman said, [...] "Well, we have to start shooting." [...] In order to fit her ankle into her boot, the crew cut the back of it and taped it to her foot. Garland was unable to walk for nearly a week after Gunslinger finished shooting, writing that [...] "I had screwed up my ankle so bad!" ...|$|E
500|$|At {{about three}} in the morning of 26 June 1830 at Windsor Castle, George awoke and passed a bowel {{movement}} – [...] "a large evacuation mix'd with blood." [...] He then sent for Halford, allegedly calling to his servants [...] "Sir Henry! Sir Henry! Fetch him; this is death!" [...] Accounts of George's final moments and last words vary. According to Halford, following his arrival and that of Sir William Knighton, the King's [...] "lips grew livid, and he dropped his head on the page's shoulder...I was up <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>in</b> five minutes, and he died but eight minutes afterwards." [...] Other accounts state the King placed his hands on his stomach and said [...] "Surely, this must be death," [...] or that he called out [...] "Good God, what is this?", clasped his page's hand, said [...] "my boy, this is death", and died. George died at 3:15 a.m. An autopsy conducted by his physicians revealed George had died from upper gastrointestinal bleeding resulting from the rupture of a blood vessel in his stomach. A large tumour [...] "the size of an orange" [...] was found attached to his bladder; his heart was enlarged, had heavily calcified valves and was surrounded by a large fat deposit.|$|E
500|$|The {{video of}} [...] "Jealous" [...] was {{considered}} to be a sequel to the one for the previous clip on the album, [...] "Partition". It opens with Beyoncé watching a man while he is sitting on a table in front of her, reading a newspaper. She stands up and the scene transitions to the singer walking down <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>in</b> a mansion, wearing a gown. It continues with Beyoncé, sitting alone at an arranged table for dinner, waiting for her love interest to come home. As she waits for him, at one point she angrily sweeps the crystal, dinnerware and candles from the table with her hands as he does not show up. Afterwards, she dresses in a red leather trench coat with a gold choker and goes outside to look for her man. She is seen on a street surrounded by various fans taking pictures of her. The scenes also transition to the singer being at a party in a bar, chatting with people, holding a drink in her hands and straddling a pinball machine. As the song nears its end, sped-up scenes of a car driving on different streets follows. During the end, Beyoncé runs to a man who is seen only from the back, dressed in a hooded coat. She embraces him with teary eyes, sighing with relief. Throughout the video, close-up shots of the singer are also featured, showing her expressions. Beyoncé is seen wearing a high-waist corset and a cropped lace top designed by Ulyana Sergeenko with her look being complete with an earring. She also wears a studded plate cuff, a chain, and a gold bracelet from jewelry by Eddie Borgo. During scenes at the party, she wears a sweatshirt designed by Givenchy.|$|E
