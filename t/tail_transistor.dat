40|$|Phase {{noise is}} one of the most {{restricted}} specifications in oscillators, especially ring oscillators. Phase noise will exhibit large fluctuations around its nominal value due to the increased process variation with technology scaling. These fluctuations will cause some fabricated ring oscillators not to meet the phase noise constraint and, hence, result in yield loss. This yield loss is expected to become worse especially for sub- 90 -nm technology nodes. In this paper, an analytical model for the phase noise variability in ring oscillators is proposed. The proposed model has been verified using Monte Carlo SPICE simulations for an industrial 65 -nm CMOS technology and is found in good agreement. The model shows that for the commonly used differential-pair-based ring oscillators, the main contribution in phase noise variability comes from the differential pair <b>tail</b> <b>transistor.</b> It also shows that the phase noise variability is reduced as the supply voltage increases. These results can be used to mitigate the phase noise variability and improve the yield through proper sizing of the <b>tail</b> <b>transistor</b> or higher supply voltage...|$|E

40|$|In this project, two {{new power}} {{efficient}} data-aware cells have been proposed. In the proposed cells, dynamic power consumption {{is reduced by}} reducing the voltage swing on the respective bit-lines during write operation. In first proposed cell (7 T BLC), an extra transistor is included {{in one of the}} pull down path of the 6 T cell. This transistor is known as a <b>tail</b> <b>transistor</b> and its switching activity is controlled by the voltage at the bit-line. The second cell (9 T cell) is designed after modifying the conventional 6 T cell at the architecture level. The switching operation of the pull up and pull down transistors of the left inverter is controlled by an additional write signal. The value of the write signal is decided by the data to be written in the cell. The cell behaves dynamically during write operation due to a broken latch which allows the data to be flipped quickly. The read operation in the 9 T cell is performed on a separate circuit which consists of two series connected transistors and one read bit-line...|$|E

40|$|Voltage {{controlled}} oscillators (VCOs) are {{key components}} in frequency synthesizers for Radio Frequency (RF) wireless communications. The design of monolithic VCOs with standard CMOS processes {{has been the}} object of several recent research projects. The common goal of these attempts has been to investigate the possibility of meeting the very demanding VCO phase noise specifications without making use of bipolar processes or external components. Two categories of VCOs are studied in this thesis, one involving an inductor, {{and the other is}} inductor free, which is a ring oscillator. The study of the phase noise performance of complementary LC VCO shows that most of the phase noises come from the tail current. A modification has been made based on this topology, where the <b>tail</b> <b>transistor</b> is removed. However this brings another problem: higher power consumption. To overcome this problem, sub-threshold techniques have been used leading to sub-threshold LC VCO. A Ring oscillator is designed at the end because of its wide tuning range and ease of implementation. Schematic simulations, layout and post-layout simulations are accomplished using TSMC 0. 18 um CMOS technology. The performances of the three types of VCOs are compared regarding the oscillating frequency, phase noise and tuning range. All of these can be used in the Bluetooth applications. In addition, the figure of merit (FOM) of the designed VCOs is compared with work by other researcher...|$|E
40|$|The {{automatic}} {{amplitude control}} (AAC) loop is an indispensable element for the practical realization of VCOs embedded in a complete transceiver. Its noise however can unacceptably degrade the single-sideband-to-carrier ratio (SSCR) performance of the oscillator, this problem being even exacerbated in low-voltage circuits. This paper addresses the design issues of a low-voltage low-noise differential LC-VCO with AAC, tunable within a 2. 3 - 2. 8 -GHz frequency range, fully integrated in bipolar technology with 2 -V power supply. First, the mechanisms through which the AAC noise affects the output phase are identified as the poor indirect stability and the AM-to-PM conversion due to the varactors. The effect of the AAC noise is discussed and substantially reduced with suitable design choices. We show that the achievable noise-to-signal ratio is bounded by the shot noise coming from the bias source of the differential oscillator, an intrinsic limit set by the low supply voltage which {{does not allow for}} degeneration of the <b>tail</b> <b>transistor.</b> Second, the design of the AAC is discussed. A large gain-bandwidth product (GBWP), about 100 MHz, has been implemented in order to correct for the fast oscillation amplitude variations and reduce the effect of the ground line disturbances. The expected value of the phase noise level, SSCR at 100 kHz =- 104 dBc/Hz, is tightly matched by the experimental results. The core oscillator dissipates 7 mA, while less than 600 μA are drawn by the AAC circuit...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Embedded {{memories}} {{are widely used}} in low power system on chip. Low power performance can optimized with process, circuit, architecture and system level codevelopment. Static random access memories consist of almost 90 % of Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI). In this project, Low power design considerations are described in advanced technology nodes to address memory leakage and active power dissipation. Memory bit cell design in context of process technology definition; Circuit techniques at the macro design level and chip level integration consideration of low power are described. A novel half-select disturb transistor SRAM cell are introduced. This together with elimination of half select disturbs enhance the overall array by implementing the low power VLSI. The floating body effect is shown to degrade the read stability while improving the write stability. The Stability and speed of cell are deteriorated which can be improved by proper sizing of the <b>tail</b> <b>transistor.</b> A short bit line loading of 16 cell / BL is adopted to achieve highperformance in read logic operation. The number of system accesses into the actual memory will be reduced by size of this ” output cache”. This made the system to achieve the high performance under read and write operation, Comparison was made between the 8 T-CDC and default 6 T cell. Cache {{memories are}} hits at high rate in 8 T comparing to the 6 T and elimination of half select with comparable access time as 6 T-Based designs, The Vdd min minimize due to switching circuit, Hence power consumption are achieve.

40|$|This paper reports two fast VCO {{frequency}} calibration {{techniques and}} their applications on a 10 -GHz CMOS integer-N phase-locked loop. The proposed methods automatically {{search for the}} optimum VCO tuning curve out {{of a group of}} curves using much less time than other existing approaches. The agility is due to the novel searching technique which is based on the comparison of signal periods, rather than counting signal cycles or reading the VCO control voltage after the PLL settled. This work further proposes employing a programmable triode transistor array to establish VCO biasing current instead of the tail current source, in order to lower the noise contribution from the <b>tail</b> current <b>transistors.</b> The PLL incorporating the proposed techniques is implemented in a 0. 18 -μm CMOS process.
