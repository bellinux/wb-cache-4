25|$|District heating (also {{known as}} heat {{networks}} or <b>teleheating)</b> {{is a system}} for distributing heat generated in a centralized location for residential and commercial heating requirements such as space heating and water heating. The heat is often obtained from a cogeneration plant burning fossil fuels but increasingly also biomass, although heat-only boiler stations, geothermal heating, heat pumps and central solar heating are also used, as well as nuclear power. District heating plants can provide higher efficiencies and better pollution control than localized boilers. According to some research, district heating with {{combined heat and power}} (CHPDH) is the cheapest method of cutting carbon emissions, and has one of the lowest carbon footprints of all fossil generation plants. A combination of CHP and centralized heat pumps are used in the Stockholm multi energy system. This allows the production of heat through electricity when there is an abundance of intermittent power production and cogeneration of electric power and district heating when the availability of intermittent power production is low.|$|E

The remaining are mostly fossil fuels: oil (3%), natural gas (3%), peat (2%), and coal (1%).|$|E

50|$|In {{designing}} their community, planners had {{the opportunity}} to look into new urban planning ideas. After looking at <b>teleheating</b> in some urban areas, planners decided to establish a community-wide district heating system. Heat for the village is thus generated in a central boiler house with two boilers. One has dual fuel capabilities and can burn wood or oil, while the second is for peak and standby purposes and runs on oil only.|$|E
50|$|District heating or <b>teleheating</b> systems {{consist of}} a network of {{insulated}} feed and return pipes which transport heated water, pressurized hot water or sometimes steam to the customer. While steam is hottest and may be used in industrial processes due to its higher temperature, it is less efficient to produce and transport due to greater heat losses. Heat transfer oils are generally not used for economic and ecological reasons. The typical annual loss of thermal energy through distribution is around 10%, as seen in Norway's district heating network.|$|E
50|$|Oil {{pipelines}} {{are made}} from steel or plastic tubes which are usually buried. The oil is moved through the pipelines by pump stations along the pipeline. Natural gas (and similar gaseous fuels) are lightly pressurised into liquids known as Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs). Natural gas pipelines are constructed of carbon steel. Highly toxic ammonia is theoretically the most dangerous substance to be transported through long-distance pipelines, but accidents have been rare. Hydrogen pipeline transport is the transportation of hydrogen through a pipe. District heating or <b>teleheating</b> systems use a network of insulated pipes which transport heated water, pressurized hot water or sometimes steam to the customer.|$|E

40|$|Understanding if a technologic {{solution}} {{satisfies the}} energy {{demands of a}} residential neighbourhood, and whether it is financially a benefit or not, cannot {{be determined by the}} only amount of energy that can be saved. Technologies such as CCHP could represent the perfect answer to this problem, on one condition though: it must be taken into consideration the reliability parameter as well. The plant configuration should guarantee a service without any interruptions. Redundancies must be evaluated and the consequences of the installation costs they imply. This study presents a method to make the right choice about an energy system characterized by: energy, reliability and economic services which satisfy power supplying to a polygeneration grid in a residential context. The case study is the area of Arci, near Rome, Italy. Our purpose is to realize a <b>teleheating</b> network and create a system able to satisfy the electric demands of the area. The first step is an accurate estimation of the electrical and thermal demands. Then we compare the optimized energy solutions with the traditional ones. Some changes have been introduced to improve the system's availability. All these steps take to an economic evaluation able to give some useful information about the feasibility of the technical choices previously made. © 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Lignite (brown coal) is Greece's most {{important}} energy mineral raw material. Lignite exploitation {{has made a}} highly {{significant contribution to the}} development of energy sector of Greece on past 50 years, and will, according to estimations, continue to supply energy for another 40 years. Greece is very rich in Lignite resources. The two main basins - from where Lignite is extracted by opencast mining - are a) in Western Macedonia (northen Greece) where is generated the 70 % of the whole electricity of Greece and b) in Central Peloponese (Southern Greece) where is generated the 10 % of the whole electricity of Greece. In this respect, Public Power Corporation of Greece cooperates with the local administrative authorities and finances or undertakes social "compensation" projects for life improvement, and social and financial support of the residential areas near mines. Also provides technical services and contributes to the carrying out of small projects in municipalities and communities. Finaly provides thermal energy from the power stations for the district <b>teleheating</b> of the towns of Kozani, Ptolemais and Megalopolis and surrounting settlements. In addition to the works of social regeneration and the duty for the development of industrial areas, for the redevelopment works and environmental protection of the new ground at the lignite mines, more than 500. 000 Euros are spent on a yearly basis (350. 000 Euros at West Macedonia and 150. 000 Euros at Central Peloponese). Moreover, according to data taken from the statement of accounts regarding only the operation of the mines (salaries, commossions, contracts assigned etc) the amount of 367. 000. 000 Euros is spent in the local societies of Kozani and Florina Prefectures. As a result, Lignite contributes to the regional Development of the country. Lignite mining and the generation of electric power take place in less developed areas, ensuring employment for a large number of scientific and labor personel, reducing unemployment and urban attraction and increasing the per capita local income in these areas. ...|$|E
