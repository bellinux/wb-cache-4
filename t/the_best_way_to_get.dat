5|$|On one {{occasion}} {{while he was}} bathing in the Saigon River, Nao decided to inspect the sewer tunnel which his father had advised him to use. Nao concluded that the tunnel would provide <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{in and out of}} the American area, but using it also presented challenges. The sewerage tunnel contained both wastes and toxic oils which could cause blindness, so Nao and his men would have to close their eyes as they move through the tunnel, in order to avoid blindness. Furthermore, Nao and his men must wash their bodies to get rid of the deadly odours to avoid detection, and probably arrest, by South Vietnamese authorities. After Nao had surveyed the tunnels which lead into the port, he presented his plan of attack to the Saigon-Gia Dinh Military District Headquarters. Nao decided to utilise high explosives, enough to sink a ship, and detonate it using a timer so that his men could get away safely. Nao’s superiors approved the plan, and they ordered him to launch the attack before sunrise to avoid killing local Vietnamese civilians.|$|E
25|$|As the fissile {{material}} growth rate {{does not meet}} this objective, it becomes necessary to look at alternative approaches for obtaining the {{fissile material}}. This conclusion is mostly independent of future technical breakthroughs, and complementary to the eventual implementation of the three-stage approach. It was realised that <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> access to the requisite fissile material would be through uranium imports, which was not possible without ending India’s nuclear isolation by U.S. and the NSG.|$|E
25|$|Walking {{for normal}} able bodied {{children}} is {{a lot different than}} walking for below-knee-amputees. Walking is less fluid and symmetrical for the children who are amputees. Research was conducted in order to find <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the amputee children to develop a more symmetrical and fluid walking form like normal able bodied children. Because {{of the results of the}} study which showed that the normal bodied children can withstand a lot more external loading than the amputees, researchers are now looking into the manufacturing and design of the prosthetics that these amputees use. Potentially, they could come up a new idea or a model that can improve the walking capabilities of these amputee children.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} factors that promote {{circular}} migration. Modern forms of transport and communication, increased social networks, {{and the growth}} of international corporations all contribute to the growing phenomena. Advances in transportation have reduced the time and money necessary to travel between locations, making it easier for migrants to return home more frequently {{and in the case of}} an emergency. New methods of communication facilitate closer connections with the migrants’ homes than before. Border-crossing social networks are especially important to the success of migrants. Through these networks, migrants are able to help each other by providing information about where to go, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> jobs, where to live, etc., helping them to overcome many of the costs and barriers of entry. Furthermore, through these social networks, workers are able to keep up with families, economic activities, political interests, and individual cultures. This also contributes to the self-perpetuating nature of circular migration. With each return visit, migrants learn more about work, housing, and the process of migration itself. These social relationships and experiences, referred to as “migration-specific capital”, lower the risk and costs of moving and improve the changes of success.|$|E
500|$|Michael Davitt {{was the son}} of a small {{tenant farmer}} in County Mayo who became a {{journalist}} and joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood. [...] He was arrested and given a 15-year sentence for gun-running. Charles Stewart Parnell, then Member of Parliament for Meath and member of the Home Rule League, arranged to have Davitt released on probation. When Davitt returned to County Mayo, he was impressed by the Fenians' attempts to organise farmers. He thought that the [...] "land question" [...] was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the support of the farmers for Irish independence.|$|E
500|$|When Alberta and Saskatchewan {{were made}} provinces in 1905, the federal {{government}} retained control over their lands and natural resources, which made the new provinces unique in Canada. [...] The Rutherford government acquiesced to this state of affairs; because the terms of confederation had been drawn up by the Liberal government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, it was natural for the provincial Liberal Party to cast itself as their defender. [...] In this capacity, Rutherford pointed to the $375,000 per year that the provincial government received from {{the federal government}} as compensation. [...] In 1910, however, Liberal MLA Alwyn Bramley-Moore (who was a staunch provincial rights advocate and who many years later would be called [...] "Alberta's first separatist" [...] by the Edmonton Journal) moved a resolution calling on the Sifton government to [...] "take such steps as may be deemed necessary to acquire the control of all such natural resources as are of purely local concern". [...] Sifton responded that it was already the intention of his government to begin negotiations with the federal government to this end. [...] He asserted [...] "I have always believed... that we should administer our mines and timber. [...] The question is not now whether we would like to control our natural resources, but what is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> them." ...|$|E

500|$|Writing about Lee's {{style and}} use of humor in a tragic story, scholar Jacqueline Tavernier-Courbin states: [...] "Laughter... the {{gangrene}} under the beautiful surface but also by demeaning it; one can hardly... be controlled by what one is able to laugh at." [...] Scout's precocious observations about her neighbors and behavior inspired National Endowment of the Arts director David Kipen to call her [...] "hysterically funny". To address complex issues, however, Tavernier-Courbin notes that Lee uses parody, satire, and irony effectively by using a child's perspective. After Dill promises to marry her, then spends too much time with Jem, Scout reasons <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> him {{to pay attention to}} her is to beat him up, which she does several times. Scout's first day in school is a satirical treatment of education; her teacher says she must undo the damage Atticus has wrought in teaching her to read and write, and forbids Atticus from teaching her further. Lee treats the most unfunny situations with irony, however, as Jem and Scout try to understand how Maycomb embraces racism and still tries sincerely to remain a decent society. [...] Satire and irony are used {{to such an extent that}} Tavernier-Courbin suggests one interpretation for the book's title: Lee is doing the mocking—of education, the justice system, and her own society—by using them as subjects of her humorous disapproval.|$|E
500|$|Greatest Hits: My Prerogative {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. Mary Awosika of the Sarasota Herald-Tribune selected [...] "(I've Just Begun) Having My Fun" [...] {{as the best}} of the new tracks, and added that [...] "The rest of the album is a romp down memory lane of when Spears was the 'It' girl of popular culture, ruling the pop charts as a multi-million dollar entertainment should. [...] In all honesty, no one can deny Spears has recorded some great dance songs, and this album is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> all the songs in one swoop". Faridul Anwar Farinordin of the New Straits Times said, [...] "rest assured, fans will surely grab this one" [...] and selected [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again" [...] and [...] "Overprotected" [...] as the best tracks. Annabel Leathes of BBC Online deemed it [...] "calorific as the KFC burgers dished up at her chav-style wedding; twenty finger lickin' tracks that mirror her trajectory from pretty pop puff to lusty strumpet". Christy Lemire of the Associated Press stated that it was premature for Spears to release a greatest hits album compilation after only five years, but highlighted [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U", [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "Everytime". Andy Petch-Jex of MusicOMH highlighted the first four tracks and commented [...] "true some of the tunes are complete pony plops, but beneath the occasional reek there beats a solid gold pop heart".|$|E
