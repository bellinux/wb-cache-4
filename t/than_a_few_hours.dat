The kaitens tentatively claimed a tanker sunk, though it was unable to verify if the ship had actually been struck. The strike had been unsuccessful. She then sped back to Kure and arrived there on 20 January. She remained in port there until March, likely due to supply shortages. On 1 March, she was ordered to Iwo Jima to support the battle taking place there. Once there, I-58 was ordered to launch all of its kaitens without their pilots and immediately return home.

40|$|Dual-action {{antidepressants}} serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SRNIs) {{are widely}} used to treat depression. Owing to its efficiency and safety, venlafaxine holds a prominent place in this group of depressants. Abrupt venlafaxine discontinuation involves {{a high risk of}} withdrawal syndrome. Mechanism of its development {{is similar to that of}} selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), but of higher intensity. Venlafaxine withdrawal symptoms may include several somatic symptoms as well as several psychiatric symptoms. In some cases, symptoms may look like a stroke. A treatment option is re-inclusion of venlafaxine or a SSRI antidepressant. The paper presents the case of a 70 -year-old patient who discontinued of her own accord to take venlafaxine, which she had been taking regularly at a daily dose of 225 mg for more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> year. <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> after taking the last dose, withdrawal syndrome occurred with severe symptoms resembling a stroke.

The possibility of its occurrence should be always kept in mind and patients should be timely informed about it. In this way, the risk of venlafaxine withdraw syndrome could be reduced, unnecessary stress to patients prevented and the costs of medical treatment lowered...|$|R

500|$|Legionary {{soldiers}} of the 1st and 2nd centuries had use of the lorica segmentata, or laminated-strip cuirass, as well as (lorica hamata) and scale armour (lorica squamata). Testing of modern replicas have demonstrated that segmentata was impenetrable to most direct and missile strikes. It was, however, uncomfortable: reenactors have discovered that chafing renders it painful to wear for longer <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> at a time, {{and it was also}} expensive to produce and difficult to maintain. In the 3rd century, the segmentata appears to have fallen out of use and troops were depicted wearing chain mail or scale. The artistic record shows that most late Roman soldiers wore metal armour, despite Vegetius' statement to the contrary. For example, illustrations in the Notitia Dignitatum show that the army's fabricae (arms factories) were producing mail armour {{at the end of the}} 4th century. Actual examples of quite large sections of mail have been recovered, at Trier (with a section of scale), Independenta, and Weiler-La-Tour, within a late 4th-century context. Officers and some soldiers may have worn muscle cuirasses, together with decorative pteruges. The catafractarii and clibanarii cavalry, from limited pictorial evidence and especially from the description of these troops by Ammianus, may have worn specialised forms of armour. In particular their limbs were protected by laminated defences, made up of curved and overlapping metal segments: [...] "Laminarum circuli tenues apti corporis flexibus ambiebant per omnia membra diducti" [...] (Thin circles of iron plates, fitted to the curves of their bodies, completely covered their limbs).

40|$|Abstract. - Corrosion of {{metallic}} materials by coal gasification atmospheres {{has been the}} subject of extensive study for over 20 years. While many alloys were found to be resistant to attack by high moisture content gases representative of fluidized bed gasifiers at temperatures up to 900 OC, good resistance could not be sustained for more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> thousand <b>hours</b> as <b>a</b> result of changes in the structure and composition of oxide scales. A shift to use of entrained slagging gasifiers by the electric power industry during the past 12 years has largely eliminated the need for {{metallic materials}} to operate above 600 OC. However, the moisture content of the gas has been reduced greatly and nearly all materials form non-protective sulfideloxide scales and can have high rates of surface recession, even at low temperatures. The challenge for the 90 's is to develop a basic understanding of factors controlling the rate of surface recession in such atmospheres and to develop new alloys that will have adequate resistance to attack. Research should be directed to the effect of alloy and gas composition on corrosion mechanisms and kinetics in low moisture gas representative of entrained slagging gasification at high temperature reacting with metal surfaces at temperatures of 300 - 600 C. 1.
