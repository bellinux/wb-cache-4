5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{that cause}} extreme destruction are rare, although when they occur, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> great amounts of damage {{or thousands of}} fatalities.|$|E
5|$|The {{most obvious}} {{contribution}} that thrips make to their ecosystem is the damage <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> during feeding. This impact may fall {{across a broad}} selection of prey items, as there is considerable breadth in host affinity across the order, and even within a species, varying degrees of fidelity to a described host remain. Family Thripidae in particular is notorious for members with broad host ranges, {{and the majority of}} pest thrips come from this family. For example, Thrips tabaci damages crops of onions, potatoes, tobacco, and cotton.|$|E
5|$|When tumors compress, invade or inflame {{parts of}} the nervous system (such as the brain, spinal cord, nerves, ganglia or plexa), <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> pain and other symptoms. Though brain tissue {{contains}} no pain sensors, brain tumors can cause pain by pressing on blood vessels or the membrane that encapsulates the brain (the meninges), or indirectly by causing a build-up of fluid (edema) that may compress pain-sensitive tissue.|$|E

5|$|Most millipedes are slow-moving detritivores, eating {{decaying}} {{leaves and}} other dead plant matter. Some eat fungi or suck plant fluids, {{and a small}} minority are predatory. Millipedes are generally harmless to humans, although some can become household or garden pests, especially in greenhouses where <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> severe damage to emergent seedlings. Most millipedes defend themselves {{with a variety of}} chemicals secreted from pores along the body, although the tiny bristle millipedes are covered with tufts of detachable bristles. Reproduction in most species is carried out by modified male legs called gonopods, which transfer packets of sperm to females.|$|E
5|$|Noise {{pollution}} from anthropogenic activities is another major concern for marine mammals. This {{is a problem}} because underwater noise pollution interferes with the abilities of some marine mammals to communicate, and locate both predators and prey. Underwater explosions are used {{for a variety of}} purposes including military activities, construction and oceanographic or geophysical research. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> injuries such as hemorrhaging of the lungs, and contusion and ulceration of the gastrointestinal tract. Underwater noise is generated from shipping, the oil and gas industry, research, and military use of sonar and oceanographic acoustic experimentation. Acoustic harassment devices and acoustic deterrent devices used by aquaculture facilities to scare away marine mammals emit loud and noxious underwater sounds.|$|E
25|$|Some {{patients}} taking tetracyclines require {{medical supervision}} because <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> steatosis and liver toxicity.|$|E
5|$|Injection {{moulding}} is {{a complex}} technology with possible production problems. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> be <b>caused</b> either by defects in the moulds, or more often by the moulding process itself.|$|R

50|$|The {{games have}} a lot of variability, in that the dice that are {{available}} to purchase each game change, so the way <b>they</b> interact <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> a great variety of changes in the game.|$|R
25|$|When threatened, common {{ostriches}} run away, but <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> {{serious injury}} and death with kicks from their powerful legs. Their legs can only kick forward.|$|E
25|$|Salts are {{frequently}} used for de-icing, but salt solutions {{are not used}} for cooling systems because <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> severe corrosion to metals. Instead, non-corrosive antifreezes are commonly used for critical de-icing, such as for aircraft wings.|$|E
25|$|Posterior {{subcapsular}} cataracts are cloudy at {{the back}} of the lens adjacent to the capsule (or bag) in which the lens sits. Because light becomes more focused toward the back of the lens, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> disproportionate symptoms for their size.|$|E
5000|$|... 5-HT3 {{receptor}} antagonists block serotonin receptors in {{the central}} nervous system and gastrointestinal tract. As such, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be used to treat post-operative and cytotoxic drug nausea & vomiting. However, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> also <b>cause</b> constipation or diarrhea, dry mouth, and fatigue.|$|R
40|$|At least 61 {{different}} species of mosquitoes exist in South Carolina. Mosquitoes are pests that <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> itchy bites, but <b>they</b> <b>can</b> also <b>cause</b> serious health issues. Mosquitoes can carry harmful viruses and parasites that infect millions of people worldwide each year. Mosquito-borne diseases <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> brain inflammation (or encephalitis), birth defects, internal bleeding, complications from parasites and even death in some cases...|$|R
25|$|Ticks* are an {{external}} parasite {{of the dog}} and can spread diseases such as Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, babesiosis, and ehrlichiosis. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> also <b>cause</b> a neurological disorder known as tick paralysis.|$|R
25|$|Congenital {{vertebral}} anomalies, including butterfly, block, and transitional vertebrae, and hemivertebrae, are {{a collection}} of malformations of the spine in animals. Most are not clinically significant, but <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> compression of the spinal cord by deforming the vertebral canal or causing instability.|$|E
25|$|These spiders, {{like many}} undomesticated pets, can bite when provoked. However, {{as they have}} urticating hairs, biting is {{typically}} not their first line of defense. Their venom is not considered medically significant, but due to their large size, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> mechanical damage.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the commingled recyclates {{are removed}} from the {{collection}} vehicle and placed on a conveyor belt spread out in a single layer. Large pieces of corrugated fiberboard and plastic bags are removed by hand at this stage, as <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> later machinery to jam.|$|E
30|$|FVPs {{are often}} asymptomatic, and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> {{suddenly}} <b>cause</b> respiratory distress from laryngeal blockage. Therefore, we emphasize that when such cases are encountered, airway management and surgical treatment {{should be considered}} as early as possible.|$|R

25|$|Drainage {{systems are}} a crucial {{compromise}} between human habitability and a secure, sustainable watershed. Paved areas and lawns or turf {{do not allow}} much precipitation to filter through the ground to recharge aquifers. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> flooding and damage in neighbourhoods, as the water flows over the surface towards a low point.|$|E
25|$|Benzodiazepines, antianxiety {{medications}} such as alprazolam and clonazepam, {{are used}} to treat anxiety and can also help control the symptoms of a panic attack. If taken in doses larger than those prescribed, or for too long, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> dependence. Side effects may include confusion, drowsiness, light-headedness, loss of balance, and memory loss.|$|E
25|$|Corticosteroids are a {{class of}} {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs used to treat moderate to severe flares of Crohn's disease. However, they are used sparingly because <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> serious side effects, including Cushing's syndrome, mania, insomnia, hypertension, high blood glucose, osteoporosis, and avascular necrosis of long bones. Corticosteroids {{should not be confused}} with the anabolic steroids used to enhance athletic performance.|$|E
50|$|Although locks {{were derived}} for file databases, data is also shared in memory between {{processes}} and threads. Sometimes {{more than one}} object (or file) is locked at a time. If they are not locked simultaneously <b>they</b> <b>can</b> overlap, <b>causing</b> a deadlock exception.|$|R
50|$|Micronutrient {{deficiency}} - Micronutrient deficiency {{is when a}} {{child is}} lacking essential vitamins or minerals such as Vitamin A, iron, and zinc.

25|$|The meadow vole {{is active}} year-round, usually at night. It also digs {{underground}} burrows, where it stores {{food for the}} winter and females give birth to their young. Although these animals tend to live close together, they are aggressive towards one another. This is particularly evident in males during the breeding season. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> damage to fruit trees, garden plants, and commercial grain crops.|$|E
25|$|They have short slender {{bodies with}} a rust-colored back, light brown sides and underparts {{and a short}} thick tail. Their short ears are visible through their fur. They are 14cm long with a 3.5cm tail and weigh about 30 to 40 g. Their dental formula is 1/1, 0/0, 0/0, 3/3. They are active year-round, usually at night. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> damage to fruit trees and stored grains.|$|E
25|$|Kami are of two minds. They can {{nurture and}} love when respected, or <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> {{destruction}} and disharmony when disregarded. Kami must be appeased {{in order to}} gain their favor and avoid their wrath. Traditionally, kami possess two souls, one gentle (nigi-mitama) and the other assertive (ara-mitama); additionally, in Yamakage Shinto, kami have two additional souls that are hidden: one happy (sachi-mitama) and one mysterious (kushi-mitama).|$|E
50|$|Shedim {{are said}} to have had the feet and claws of a rooster and share some {{characteristics}} both of human and angels. Like angels, they know the future and have wings, but like humans they eat, drink, procreate and die. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> also <b>cause</b> sickness and misfortune.|$|R
50|$|Subclinical {{infections are}} {{important}} since they allow infections to spread from a reserve of carriers. <b>They</b> also <b>can</b> <b>cause</b> clinical problems {{unrelated to the}} direct issue of infection.
