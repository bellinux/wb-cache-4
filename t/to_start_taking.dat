5|$|Miller {{warmed up}} for the Second Victory Test by top-scoring for the RAAF against Lancashire and the RAF. In the Test, played at Bramall Lane, Miller went wicketless and scored 17 in the first innings. In the second innings, Miller bowled a fierce spell, hitting Test world record holder Len Hutton and Cyril Washbrook on the arm and head respectively, {{provoking}} an angry crowd reaction. At the time, Miller had a leisurely attitude towards bowling, so his success led to calls for him <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>taking</b> it seriously, instead of simply jogging in and releasing the ball. Despite this, Australia lost the match.|$|E
5|$|In view {{of growing}} labor shortages, on July 1, 1944 the War Manpower Commission made an {{important}} decision, ruling that {{from then on}} all hiring of male employees in the country was to be done through the United States Employment Service (USES). By that time the USES followed strict anti-discrimination employment practices. The PTC management finally gave in and within a week posted notices about available skilled positions that {{would be open to}} all applicants, regardless of race. The company accepted eight black applicants (three from the USES and five from its own ranks) to train as streetcar coachmen. Their training was to take place in late July, and they were <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>taking</b> an empty streetcar on the lines from August 1. It was that impending trial run of the streetcars by the eight black trainees that finally triggered the strike.|$|E

5|$|Miller {{went on to}} play {{a two-day}} match for the RAAF against Lancashire, where his 52 was the only fifty in a low-scoring game. He also took match figures of 2/28. After scoring 30 in an innings victory over Learie Constantine's XI, Miller {{represented}} the RAAF against the RAF at Lord's where he top-scored with 63 in 90 minutes. The Second Victory Test was played at Bramall Lane in Sheffield, where the grandstands were damaged by German air raids. Hassett sent the Englishmen into bat. Miller went wicketless. He was run {{out in the first}} innings for 17. In the second innings, Miller bowled a fast and hostile spell, hitting Test world record holder Len Hutton in the arm before hitting Cyril Washbrook in the head, provoking an angry crowd reaction, comparing Miller to the Bodyline spearhead Harold Larwood. He later removed Washbrook and ended with 2/28. His efforts led to calls for him <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>taking</b> his bowling seriously, instead of simply jogging in releasing the ball, especially from former South African representative Bob Crisp. Despite this, Miller fell for eight in the second innings and Australia fell 41 runs short of the target and series was squared.|$|E

25|$|On 2 July 1816 Méduse {{ran into}} {{increasingly}} shallow water, both Chaumareys and Richefort ignoring signs such as white breakers and mud in the water. Eventually, Lieutenant Maudet {{took it upon}} himself <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>taking</b> soundings off the bow, and, measuring only 18 fathoms (ca. 32 metres), warned his captain. Realising the danger at last, Chaumareys ordered the ship brought up into the wind, but it was too late, and Méduse ran aground 50 kilometres off the coast. The accident occurred at a spring high tide, which made it difficult to re-float the frigate. The captain refused to jettison the 14 three-tonne cannons and so the ship settled into the bank.|$|E

Eight members were {{initially}} selected in the charter group. Originally, four men were chosen from the junior and senior classes every year {{on the basis of a}} significant contribution to The University of Texas. The Friar Society recognizes students who have made a significant contribution to The University of Texas. In 1936, the Friars decided <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>taking</b> larger classes to accommodate the growing size of the university. Women were first admitted to the Friar Society on March 25, 1973. In 1982, the Friars decided to create a teaching fellowship in honor of the upcoming centennial celebration for The University of Texas. Friar alumni raised $100,000 for this purpose, and this amount was matched by the Board of Regents to create an endowment. The Friar Centennial Teaching Fellowship is an annual award given to a UT professor who has demonstrated excellence at the undergraduate teaching level. With a prize of $25,000, the award is the largest monetary award annually given to a UT professor.|$|E

25|$|By 1855 New South Wales {{had been}} granted {{responsible}} self-government and increasingly took responsibility for its own affairs. The colony remained within, and was fiercely loyal to, the British Empire, and while the Colonial Office continued to determine foreign policy, the decision was taken in London that the Australian colonies would need <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>taking</b> {{responsibility for their own}} defence. In 1860, as British Army units were being sent to New Zealand, New South Wales attempted to raise a volunteer force of 1,700 men. This number was almost achieved with 1,644 volunteers enlisting, who were formed into one troop of mounted rifles, three batteries of artillery, and 20 companies of infantry. To encourage enlistments, land grants were offered in 1867. It was not considered a success. In 1868, these were later organised into a battalion and regimental structure. The Volunteer Sydney Rifle Corps ceased to exist, being subsumed into the 20 company-strong 1st Regiment, New South Wales Rifle Volunteers. During the Maori Wars, although the colony had no official role, New South Wales contributed significantly to the 2,500 volunteers that were sent from Australia in 1863.|$|E
25|$|Crespin {{was born}} in Marseille in 1927. She moved to Nîmes with her family {{at the age of}} five and her parents opened a large shoe store in that city which they ran for many years. Crespin's {{childhood}} was not an easy one, being affected both by growing up during World War II and her mother's alcoholism. She initially intended to be a pharmacist but was prevented in pursuing this path after failing to pass her Baccalauréat at the age of 16. Up to this point her father had not allowed her to study singing. However, as her career path was limited by the exam results he finally allowed her <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>taking</b> lessons for purely pragmatic reasons. She went on to win first prize in a singing competition a few years later, and, at the age of nineteen, she went to Paris to study at the Conservatoire de Paris in the classes of Suzanne Cesbon-Viseur and Georges Jouatte. Four years later, in 1950, she was awarded first prize in the school's onstage competitions for opera and opéra comique and second prize in the school's singing competition. Traditionally past winners of Conservatoire's competitions were offered performance contracts with the Opéra National de Paris, but Crespin was for some unknown reason not offered one. This created a somewhat tenuous relationship between Crespin and her country's musical establishment which extended into the early portion of her career.|$|E

2500|$|Scientists {{involved}} in the clinical trials published articles warning of birth defects {{at the same time}} the drug was launched in the US, but nonetheless isotretinoin was taken up quickly and widely, both among dermatologists and general practitioners. Cases of birth defects showed up in the first year, leading the FDA to begin publishing case reports and to Roche sending warning letters to doctors and placing warning stickers on drug bottles, and including stronger warnings on the label. [...] Lawsuits against Roche started to be filed. [...] In 1983 the FDA's advisory committee was convened and recommended stronger measures, which the FDA took and were that time unprecedented: warning blood banks not to accept blood from people taking the drug, and adding a warning to the label advising women <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>taking</b> contraceptives a month before starting the drug. [...] However use of the drug continued to grow, as did the number of babies born with birth defects. [...] In 1985 the label was updated to include a boxed warning. [...] In early 1988 the FDA called for another advisory committee, and FDA employees prepared an internal memo estimating that around 1,000 babies had been born with birth defects due isotretinoin, that up to around 1,000 miscarriages had been caused, and that between 5,000 and 7,000 women had had abortions due to isotretinoin. [...] The memo was leaked to the New York Times a few days before the meeting, leading to a storm of media attention. [...] In the committee meeting, dermatologists and Roche each argued to keep the drug on the market but to increase education efforts; pediatricians and the CDC argued to withdraw the drug from the market. [...] The committee recommended to restrict physicians who could prescribe the drug and to require a second opinion before it could be prescribed. [...] The FDA, believing it did not have authority under the law to restrict who had the right to prescribe the drug, kept the drug on the market but took further unprecedented measures: it required to Roche to make warnings yet more visible and graphic, provide doctors with informed consent forms to be used when prescribing the drug, and to conduct follow up studies to test whether the measures were reducing exposure of pregnant women to the drug. [...] Roche implemented those measures, and offered to pay for contraception counseling and pregnancy testing for women prescribed the drug - the program was called the [...] "Pregnancy Prevention Program".|$|E
