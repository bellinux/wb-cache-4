5|$|After {{his victory}} in the Spanish Civil War, Francisco Franco's plans for the Spanish Navy {{included}} the acquisition of four modern battleships, and {{a variation on the}} Italian s was the favored candidate to fill the requirement. In late 1939, a Spanish mission to Italy received assurances of <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> for the construction of ships of the class in Spanish yards, and a slipway of sufficient size to construct two ships at a time was built at Ferrol. However, Italy's entry into the Second World War in 1940, combined with the limited resources of Spain, led to the cancellation of the project.|$|E

5|$|Maintenance of the Australian Globemasters is {{undertaken}} {{by both the}} RAAF and Boeing. As part of Australia's membership of the Globemaster III Sustainment Partnership, Air Force technicians are responsible for routine servicing, and Boeing handles major maintenance tasks. Boeing also provides <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> for RAAF Globemasters during deployments outside of Australia, {{and the company is}} paid in return for achieving contractually mandated aircraft availability targets. Due to the economies of scale arising from a large international maintenance program, the contract with Boeing is considered to be cheaper than attempting to support the aircraft through unique Australian contracts. It is expected that the RAAF's Globemasters will remain in service for 30 years.|$|E

5|$|The Isinglass/Rheinberry {{concept was}} {{considered}} to be superior to spy satellites in a number of ways, including rapid turnaround time and quick response capability. As there was little funding to be had from the CIA budget, McDonnell developed the aircraft using its own funds, although <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> gleaned from Oxcart was supplied by the CIA. The McDonnell Isenglass/Rheinberry proposal's shape remains classified, although it has been described as being similar to the Space Shuttle, albeit much reduced in size. A 1/3 cross-sectional model of the aircraft was constructed to illustrate the principles used in its construction.|$|E

Around 60 per cent of the 2010 census was funded by UNFPA, UKAID (formerly DFID), USAID and AfDB, while the rest was contributed by the Zambian Ministry of Finance.

During this time, there were changes to how Hergé conducted his work; on 6 April 1950, he established Studios Hergé as a public company. The Studios were based in his Avenue Delleur house in Brussels, with Hergé making a newly purchased country house in Céroux-Mousty his and Germaine's main abode.

5|$|MacPaint 2.0 was {{released}} on January 11, 1988 by Claris. It added many improvements to the software, including the capability to open and use up to nine documents simultaneously. The original MacPaint operated as a single-document application with a non-movable window. MacPaint 2.0 eliminated this limitation, introducing a fully functioning document window, which could be sized up to 8 x 10". Several other features were introduced, such as a Zoom tool, MagicEraser tool for undo actions and stationary documents. MacPaint 2.0 was developed by David Ramsey, a developer at Claris. MacPaint 2.0 was sold for US$125, with a US$25 upgrade available for existing users of MacPaint. Claris discontinued <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> for the original MacPaint in 1989. Claris stopped selling MacPaint in early 1998 because of diminishing sales. There has been an unofficial update called MacPaint X which is 3.0 beta, mainly for people who wished {{to be able to}} use the program.|$|E

5|$|Testing program staff {{originally}} {{set test}} Charlie for early 1947. They wanted to explode it deep {{under the surface}} {{in the lee of}} the atoll to test the effect of nuclear weapons as depth charges on unmoored ships. The unanticipated delays in decontaminating the target ships after test Baker prevented the required <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> personnel from assisting with Charlie and also meant that there were no uncontaminated target ships available for use in Charlie. The naval weapons program staff decided the test was less pressing given that the entire U.S. arsenal had only a handful of nuclear weapons and cancelled the test. The official reason given for cancelling Charlie was that the program staff felt it was unnecessary due {{to the success of the}} Able and Baker tests. The deep ocean effects testing that Charlie was to have performed were fulfilled nine years later with Operation Wigwam.|$|E
5|$|The PS3 {{client was}} {{developed}} in a collaborative effort between Sony and the Pande lab and was first released as a standalone client on March23, 2007. Its release made Folding@home the first distributed computing project to use PS3s. On September18 of the following year, the PS3 client became a channel of Life with PlayStation on its launch. In the types of calculations it can perform, {{at the time of}} its introduction, the client fit in between a CPU's flexibility and a GPU's speed. However, unlike CPUs and GPUs, users were unable to perform other activities on their PS3 while running Folding@home. The PS3's uniform console environment made <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> easier and made Folding@home more user friendly. The PS3 also has the ability to stream data quickly to its GPU, which was used for real-time atomic-level visualizing of the current protein dynamics.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposal}} {{was accepted by}} the defence operational requirements committee in August 1978, and the project was given the procurement designation of SEA 1114. Approval for the development phase {{of the project was}} given in the 1981–82 federal budget. The RAN had four main requirements: that the submarines were tailored to operating conditions in the Australasian region, that they be equipped with a combat system advanced enough to promote a long service life, that appropriate and sustainable infrastructure be established in Australia to construct the boats, then provide maintenance and <b>technical</b> <b>support</b> for their operational lifespan, and that the submarines were capable of peacetime and emergency operations in addition to their hunter-killer role. Ten submarines were envisioned, a number which was revised to between four and eight boats by the start of 1983, and later settled on the acquisition of six submarines, with the option to order two more.|$|E
