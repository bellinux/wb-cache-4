5|$|In 1924, one of Independence Hall's {{exterior}} doors {{was replaced by}} glass, allowing some view of the bell even when the building was closed. When Congress enacted the nation's first peacetime draft in 1940, the first Philadelphians required to serve took their oaths of enlistment before the Liberty Bell. Once the war started, the bell was again a symbol, used to sell war bonds. In {{the early days of}} World War II, it was feared that the bell might be in danger from saboteurs or enemy bombing, and city officials considered moving the bell to Fort Knox, to be stored with the nation's gold reserves. The idea provoked a storm of protest from around the nation, and was abandoned. Officials then considered building an underground steel vault above which it would be displayed, and into which it could be lowered if necessary. The project was dropped when studies found that the digging might undermine the foundations of Independence Hall. The bell was again <b>tapped</b> <b>on</b> D-Day, as well as in victory on V-E Day and V-J Day.|$|E

25|$|Fresh oysters must {{be alive}} just before {{consumption}} or cooking. There {{is only one}} criterion: the oyster must be capable of tightly closing its shell. Open oysters should be <b>tapped</b> <b>on</b> the shell; a live oyster will close up and is safe to eat. Oysters which are open and unresponsive are dead and must be discarded. Some dead oysters, or oyster shells which are full of sand may be closed. These make a distinctive noise when tapped, and are known as 'clackers'.|$|E
50|$|Being a {{distance}} based system, Opal card users {{are required to}} <b>tap</b> <b>on</b> and <b>tap</b> off <b>on</b> all modes (apart from the Manly Ferry) to ensure the correct fare is charged. If a user does not correctly tap off after <b>tapping</b> <b>on,</b> a default fare will be charged, corresponding to the maximum fare on that mode of travel. However, a lower default fare applies {{if it is not}} possible to reach the maximum fare on the route for which the <b>tap</b> <b>on</b> took place. The default fare will be charged after a time-out period of five hours from initial <b>tap</b> <b>on</b> or if the user changes modes or <b>taps</b> <b>on</b> at a gated station.|$|R

25|$|This {{is a rare}} form of synesthesia where {{individuals}} {{feel the}} same sensation that another person feels (such as touch). For instance, when such a synesthete observes someone being <b>tapped</b> <b>on</b> their shoulder, the synesthete involuntarily feels a tap on their own shoulder as well. People {{with this type of}} synesthesia have been shown to have higher empathy levels compared to the general population. This {{may be related to the}} so-called mirror neurons present in the motor areas of the brain, which have also been linked to empathy.|$|E
25|$|Capillary tubes {{may also}} be used. A small sample of {{bacteria}} is collected {{on the end of}} the capillary tube, without blocking the tube, to avoid false negative results. The opposite end is then dipped into hydrogen peroxide, which is drawn into the tube through capillary action, and turned upside down, so that the bacterial points downwards. The hand holding the tube is then <b>tapped</b> <b>on</b> the bench, moving the hydrogen peroxide down until it touches the bacteria. If bubbles form on contact, this indicates a positive catalase result. This test can detect catalase-positive bacteria at concentrations above about 105 cells/mL, and is simple to use.|$|E
25|$|Playing shows {{late into}} the night, and living {{with his wife and}} young child in his tiny apartment, Orbison often sought refuge by taking his guitar to his car and writing songs there. Songwriter Joe Melson, an {{acquaintance}} of Orbison's, <b>tapped</b> <b>on</b> his car window one day in Texas in 1958, and the two decided to try to write some songs together. In three recording sessions in 1958 and 1959, Orbison and Melson recorded seven songs at RCA Nashville, with Atkins producing, but only two were judged worthy of release by RCA; Wesley Rose brought Orbison to the attention of producer Fred Foster at Monument Records.|$|E

25|$|Oxford: Prior to {{admission}} to the degree, the graduand will normally wear either the undergraduate commoner's or scholar's gown (if being admitted to the BA), or the graduate student's gown or the gown and hood of their previous Oxford/external university degree (if being admitted to a higher degree). After being formally admitted during the ceremony, they exit the Theatre and assume the gowns and hoods of their new degrees {{and then return to}} the Theatre in their new gowns and hoods. For certain degrees such as the higher doctorates and MAs, if they profess the Christian faith, the graduand may (if they wish) kneel in front of the (Vice-)Chancellor and be admitted in 'the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit' whilst being <b>tapped</b> <b>on</b> the head with the Bible.|$|E
500|$|By Louis's reign, Bastille {{prisoners were}} {{detained}} using a [...] "lettre de cachet", [...] "a letter under royal seal", {{issued by the}} king and countersigned by a minister, ordering a named person to be held. Louis, closely involved in this aspect of government, personally decided who should be imprisoned at the Bastille. The arrest itself involved an element of ceremony: the individual would be <b>tapped</b> <b>on</b> the shoulder with a white baton and formally detained {{in the name of}} the king. Detention in the Bastille was typically ordered for an indefinite period and there was considerable secrecy over who had been detained and why: the legend of the [...] "Man in the Iron Mask", a mysterious prisoner who finally died in 1703, symbolises this period of the Bastille. Although in practice many were held at the Bastille as a form of punishment, legally a prisoner in the Bastille was only being detained for preventative or investigative reasons: the prison was not officially supposed to be a punitive measure in its own right. The average length of imprisonment in the Bastille under Louis XIV was approximately three years.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{production}} expanded on that of The Chronic, with new, sparse {{beats and}} reduced use of samples which were prominent on his debut album. Co-producer Scott Storch talked of how Dr. Dre used his collaborators during recording sessions: [...] "At the time, I saw Dr. Dre desperately needed something. He needed a fuel injection, and Dre utilized {{me as the}} nitrous oxide. He threw me into the mix, and I sort of <b>tapped</b> <b>on</b> a new flavor with my whole piano sound and the strings and orchestration. So I'd be on the keyboards, and Mike [...] was on the bass guitar, and Dre was on the drum machine." [...] Josh Tyrangiel of Time has described the recording process which Dr. Dre employs, stating [...] "Every Dre track begins the same way, with Dre behind a drum machine {{in a room full}} of trusted musicians. (They carry beepers. When he wants to work, they work.) He'll program a beat, then ask the musicians to play along; when Dre hears something he likes, he isolates the player and tells him how to refine the sound." ...|$|E

A painter on the steeple in 1852 died of [...] "painter's colic" [...] when he was scared into a fall off the church, and in 1984 another painter suddenly climbed down after he claimed to have been <b>tapped</b> <b>on</b> the shoulder three times. The hobgoblin {{is supposed to have}} added an extra line to the clock face so that [...] "XII" [...] became [...] "XIII".|$|E
2500|$|On 22 August {{the eighth}} {{borehole}} broke through {{at a depth}} of , at a ramp near the shelter where the miners had taken refuge. For days the miners had heard drills approaching and had prepared notes, which they attached to the tip of the drill with insulation tape when it poked into their space. They also <b>tapped</b> <b>on</b> the drill before it was withdrawn, and these taps could be heard on the surface. When the drill was withdrawn a note was attached to it: [...] (English: [...] "We are well in the refuge the 33"). The words became the motto of the miners' survival and the rescue effort, and appeared on websites, banners and T-shirts.|$|E

2500|$|Though the Roma are {{primarily}} {{known as the}} performers of Hungarian styles like verbunkos, {{they have their own}} form of folk music that is largely without instrumentation, in spite of their reputation in that field outside of the Roma community. Roma music tends to take on characteristics of whatever music the people are around, however, embellished with [...] "twists and turns, trills and runs", making a very new, and distinctively Roma style. Though without instruments, Roma folk musicians use sticks, <b>tapped</b> <b>on</b> the ground, rhythmic grunts and a technique called oral-bassing which vocally imitates the sound of instruments. Some modern Roma musicians, like Ando Drom, Romano Drom, Romani Rota and Kalyi Jag have added modern instruments like guitars to the Roma style, while Gyula Babos' Project Romani has used elements of avant-garde jazz.|$|E
2500|$|In 134 BC, he {{was serving}} {{with the army}} at Numantia and his good {{services}} {{brought him to the}} attention of Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus Africanus. Whether he arrived with Scipio Aemilianus or was already serving in the demoralized army that Scipio Aemilianus took over at Numantia is not clear. According to Plutarch, during a conversation after dinner, when the conversation turned to generals, someone asked Scipio Aemilianus where the Roman people would find a worthy successor to him. Aemilianus then gently <b>tapped</b> <b>on</b> Marius' shoulder, saying: [...] "Perhaps this is the man." [...] It would seem that even at this early stage in his army career, Marius had ambitions for a political career in Rome. He ran for election as one of the twenty-four special military tribunes of the first four legions who were elected (the rest were appointed by the magistrate who raised the legion). Sallust tells us that he was unknown by sight to the electors but was returned by all the tribes {{on the basis of his}} accomplishments.|$|E
2500|$|In {{places such}} as Kerala where {{coconuts}} are in abundance, the half shell of coconut {{was used as the}} latex collection container. Glazed pottery or aluminium or plastic cups became [...] more common in Kerala and other countries. The cups are supported by a wire that encircles the tree. This wire incorporates a spring so it can stretch as the tree grows. The latex is led into the cup by a galvanised [...] "spout" [...] knocked into the bark. Tapping normally takes place early in the morning, when the internal pressure of the tree is highest. A good tapper can tap a tree every 20 seconds on a standard half-spiral system, and a common daily [...] "task" [...] size is between 450 and 650 trees. Trees are usually <b>tapped</b> <b>on</b> alternate or third days, although many variations in timing, length and number of cuts are used. [...] "Tappers would make a slash in the bark with a small hatchet. These slanting cuts allowed latex to flow from ducts located on the exterior or the inner layer of bark (cambium) of the tree. Since the cambium controls the growth of the tree, growth stops if it is cut. Thus, rubber tapping demanded accuracy, so that the incisions would not be too many given the size of the tree, or too deep, which could stunt its growth or kill it." ...|$|E
