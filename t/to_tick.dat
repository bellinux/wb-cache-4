5|$|Common ixodid ticks {{collected}} from impala include Amblyomma hebraeum, Boophilus decoloratus, Hyalomma marginatum, Ixodes cavipalpus, Rhipicephalus appendiculatus and R. evertsi. In Zimbabwe, heavy infestation by ticks such as R. appendiculatus {{has proved to}} be a major cause behind the high mortality of ungulates, as they can lead <b>to</b> <b>tick</b> paralysis. Impala have special adaptations for grooming, such as their characteristic dental arrangement, to manage ticks before they engorge; however, the extensive grooming needed to keep the tick load under control involves the risk of dehydration during summer, lower vigilance against predators and gradual wearing out of the teeth. A study showed that impala adjust the time devoted to grooming and the number of grooming bouts according to the seasonal prevalence of ticks.|$|E
5|$|Following the score, kickoff, and return, Tech began another {{offensive}} possession at its 24-yard line. The Hokies {{picked up}} two first downs and drove into NC State territory, but the clock continued <b>to</b> <b>tick</b> toward halftime. In the Wolfpack {{side of the}} field, Tech running back Eddie Hunter broke free for a 23-yard run, the longest play by Virginia Tech in the second quarter. There was now just over twominutes remaining in the quarter. Tech was unable to pick up another first down after Hunter's run, and attempted to convert the fourth down rather than trying a field goal. When the play was stopped for a loss, however, Virginia Tech was denied points and NC State's offense returned with 47seconds remaining in the half.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's kickoff was downed in the {{end zone}} for a touchback. Texas' offense thus began its drive at its 20-yard line. The first play of the drive was an end-around that gained 10yards and a first down for Texas. After an {{incomplete}} pass, Mitchell gained five yards on a counter run. On third down, Williams caught a six-yard pass for a first down at the Texas 41-yard line. Mitchell ran six yards on first down, but was stopped after a gain of just one yard on second down. The second-down play caused the final seconds <b>to</b> <b>tick</b> off the clock in the third quarter, which ended with Virginia Tech leading, 1410.|$|E
40|$|In guinea-pigs it {{has been}} shown that {{resistance}} <b>to</b> <b>ticks</b> is an acquired, immunologically mediated phenomenon. It has been suggested recently that epidermal Langerhans cells (LC) may play roles in the mechanisms of resistance <b>to</b> <b>ticks.</b> The ATPase-positive epidermal LC of guinea-pigs have been shown to be depleted for a period of several days following u. v. irradiations. In this study, u. v. treatment of guinea-pigs' ears before primary tick infestations resulted in a significant reduction of acquired resistance <b>to</b> <b>ticks.</b> When u. v. treatments were applied to resistant animals prior to the challenge infestations, a marked reduction in expression of resistance <b>to</b> <b>ticks</b> was demonstrated. These results can be interpreted to imply that functional LC in the epidermis are required for both the normal acquisition and the expression of the guinea-pig's immune responses to D. andersoni infestations...|$|R
40|$|We {{determined}} {{whether the}} infectivity of the Lyme disease spirochete (Borrelia burgdorferi) <b>to</b> vector <b>ticks</b> {{varies with the}} duration of infection in laboratory mice. Thus, noninfected nymphal deer <b>ticks</b> were permitted <b>to</b> feed on two strains of early (2 months after infection) and late (8 months after infection) spirochete-infected mice. The attached ticks were removed from their hosts at specified time intervals and were thereafter examined for spirochetes by direct immunofluorescence microscopy. Spirochetes can be acquired by nymphal ticks as fast as 8 h after attachment. More than 80 % of the attached ticks acquired spirochetal infection within 48 h after feeding on early spirochete-infected mice. In contrast, spirochetal infectivity <b>to</b> <b>ticks</b> was less than 50 % after feeding on late spirochete-infected mice. The overall infectivity of spirochete-infected mice <b>to</b> <b>ticks</b> correlated with the duration of tick attachment. In addition, there was no adverse effect on the spirochetal infectivity <b>to</b> <b>ticks</b> by high levels of host antibody against spirochetes, and no obvious differences in infectivity <b>to</b> <b>ticks</b> was observed by the site of tick feeding. We conclude that the span of spirochetal infectivity <b>to</b> <b>ticks</b> varies with the duration of infection in mice and suggest that spirochetes may persist and may be evenly distributed in the skin of infected hosts, regardless of prominent host immunity...|$|R

As they approach the hotel, Iris is taken out on a stretcher. The next day, Lenny and Mace take the disc <b>to</b> <b>Tick,</b> who cannot identify the source of the recording, but recalls that Iris was looking for Lenny. Mace deduces that Iris may have left something in Lenny's car, and the two go to the impound and find Iris's disc. Steckler and Engleman appear and demand the disc at gunpoint, but Lenny and Mace escape in her car before being forced to stop at a dock. Steckler pours gasoline on the car and sets it on fire, but Mace drives it into the harbor, extinguishing the flames. When they reach the surface, the cops have left.|$|E
5|$|With a firm {{lead and}} now in {{possession}} of the ball, Virginia Tech began to run out the clock by executing short rushing plays up {{the center of the}} field. Since the game clock does not stop in American college football if a player remains in bounds short of the first down marker, the Hokies could hasten {{the end of the game}} and preserve their lead by following this strategy. From their one-yard line, Taylor ran the ball for a one-yard gain, followed by two rushes by Evans for another four yards. The Hokies prepared to punt the ball, but during the kick, Cincinnati committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty by tackling Tech punter Brent Bowden. The penalty gave Virginia Tech a first down and kept their drive going. From the Tech 21-yard line, Evans was stopped for a loss of one yard, but broke free for an 11-yard gain and a first down on the next play. As the clock continued <b>to</b> <b>tick</b> down, Cincinnati began to use its timeouts in an effort to stop the clock after each play. This strategy was partially successful, as Tech was denied another first down and punted with 2:31 remaining in the game.|$|E

25|$|In the Listening exam of 2007, {{there was}} a part asking {{students}} to determine whether marked sentences were correct or not, based on the whole recording. There were 10 questions, carrying 2 marks each. In that part, if a candidate answered a question correctly, 2 marks were awarded but if the question was answered, 2 marks were deducted. No marks were given or deducted for blank answers. A candidate who answered all the questions, {{with no more than}} 5 being correct, would end up having no marks for that section, but if 5 were correct, 10 marks were given. That stirred up controversy among candidates, who claimed that the marking scheme was not fair. They said that all questions were compulsory so there should not be any advantage to those who left some of the blanks empty by deducting marks for wrong answers. The HKEAA said that it had been in practice for years to prevent students guessing answers, but in fact, this type of marking had appeared only in table-type questions in which candidates were required <b>to</b> <b>tick</b> some of the boxes in the table but not in questions in which all blanks were to be filled.|$|E

40|$|Guinea-pigs {{developed}} {{resistance to}} larvae of the ixodid tick, Dermacentor andersoni, after one infestation.

Larvae feeding on resistant hosts weighed less than larvae engorging on a host with no previous exposure <b>to</b> <b>ticks.</b> Evidence is presented which indicates that this resistance can be passively transferred with viable lymph node cells, but not with serum, from resistant guinea-pigs.

40|$|Cattle ticks, Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus, are {{a serious}} threat to animal health and production. Some ticks feed on a single host species while others such as R. microplus infest {{multiple}} hosts. White tailed deer (WTD) {{play a role in the}} maintenance and expansion of cattle tick populations. However, cattle ticks fed on WTD show lower weight and reproductive performance when compared <b>to</b> <b>ticks</b> fed on cattle, suggesting the existence of host factors that affect tick feeding and reproduction. To elucidate these factors, a proteomics approach was used <b>to</b> characterize <b>tick</b> and host proteins in R. microplus ticks fed on cattle and WTD. The results showed that R. microplus ticks fed on cattle have overrepresented tick proteins involved in blood digestion and reproduction when compared <b>to</b> <b>ticks</b> fed on WTD, while host proteins were differentially represented in ticks fed on cattle or WTD. Although a direct connection cannot be made between differentially represented tick and host proteins, these results suggested that differentially represented host proteins together with other host factors could be associated with higher R. microplus tick feeding and reproduction observed in ticks fed on cattle.
