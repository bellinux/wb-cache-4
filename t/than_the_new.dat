5|$|In 2009, the Premier of New South Wales, Nathan Rees, {{commissioned}} a state logo {{based on the}} floral emblem. The resultant logo design has been criticised as resembling a lotus rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> South Wales Waratah.|$|E
5|$|Now the fan favorites, the Midnight Express had {{to contend}} with a team thought to be disbanded forever: the Original Midnight Express, which {{consisted}} of Condrey and Randy Rose, who joined JCP after a brief run in the AWA. The duo was led by long-time Jim Cornette nemesis Paul E. Dangerously, in a storyline that saw them trying to prove the originals were better <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> version. The surprise appearance of the Original Midnight Express gave Dangerously's team the initial momentum in the feud, but soon after, Condrey left the promotion once more. This forced the bookers to bring in Jack Victory as a replacement as Condrey's disappearance cut the promising feud short.|$|E
5|$|While {{serving on}} the Western Front, Godley {{continued}} to fulfill {{his role as the}} overall commander of the NZEF in addition to his corps command. By September 1917, as reinforcements from New Zealand continued to arrive on the Western Front to replace the casualties lost in the major battles of the previous two years, Allen, still the Minister of Defence, was concerned by the drain on New Zealand's manpower. Allen considered that Australia and Canada were not making their proper contributions to the war effort. In response, Godley pointed out that the Australian divisions had seen more action <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Zealanders.|$|E
50|$|Another, rival newspaper, The Akron Reporter, began {{publication}} on July 1, 1916. It, too, {{went through}} several changes in ownership until February, 1929, though fewer <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>News.</b> <b>The</b> changes {{are summarized in}} the following table.|$|R
50|$|X2 modules {{are smaller}} and consume less power than first {{generation}} XENPAK modules, but larger and consume more energy <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> XFP transceiver standard and SFP+ standards.|$|R
2500|$|Similarly, {{the paper}} by Kaiser and Shevoroshkin is much older <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>newest</b> Altaic Etymological Dictionary (2003; see Altaic {{languages}} article) and therefore assumes {{a somewhat different}} phonological system for Proto-Altaic.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} Xbox 360 weighs approximately 3.5kg (7.7lb), about 350grams heavier <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> Xbox. The {{new version}} weighs in at 2.9kg (6.6lbs).|$|E
25|$|Commander's Edition was, effectively, a {{ground-up}} rewrite of the rules. The old rule-number {{system was}} discarded {{in favor of}} a completely new alpha-numeric system. The three Expansions were scrapped and re-packaged. However, other <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> (bigger) reorganized rulebook, the initial 1983 release of the boxed set was mostly unchanged from the Designer's Edition, including the box (later printings labeled it Star Fleet Battles: Volume I).|$|E
25|$|In England Brogdens were {{offering}} better terms <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Zealand government, {{mainly in the}} sense that they paid most of the necessary costs themselves, relying on promissory notes from the immigrants, whereas the government wanted substantial payments in advance which were hard for a working man to find. For this reason the colony's Agent-General in London, Dr. Isaac Featherston directed staff to support the Brogden programme.|$|E
5000|$|High-adhesion HT-C trucks, reused {{from the}} [...] "donor" [...] SD60M, rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> [...] "radial" [...] or [...] "bolsterless" [...] trucks. Nearly all SD40-2s and SD50s {{used the same}} truck.|$|R
5000|$|Similarly, {{the paper}} by Kaiser and Shevoroshkin is much older <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>newest</b> Altaic Etymological Dictionary (2003; see Altaic {{languages}} article) and therefore assumes {{a somewhat different}} phonological system for Proto-Altaic.|$|R
50|$|The R64 is {{a provincial}} route in South Africa that connects Kimberley with Bloemfontein via Boshof and Dealesville. It is {{slightly}} longer <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> N8 route via Petrusburg, by about 10 kilometres.|$|R
25|$|Conditional {{branches}} {{test whether}} the {{least significant bit}} of a register is set or clear, or compare a register as a signed quadword to zero, and branch if the specified condition is true. The conditions available for comparing a register to zero are equality, inequality, less than, {{less than or equal}} to, greater than or equal to, and greater <b>than.</b> <b>The</b> <b>new</b> address is computed by longword aligning and sign extending the 21-bit displacement and adding it to the address of the instruction following the conditional branch.|$|E
25|$|From 1945 to 1947, Bernstein was the Music Director of the New York City Symphony, {{which had}} been founded the {{previous}} year by the conductor Leopold Stokowski. The orchestra (with support from the Mayor) was aimed at a different audience <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> York Philharmonic, with more modern programs and cheaper tickets. Also in regard to a different audience, in 1945 Bernstein discussed the possibility of acting in a film with Greta Garbo—playing Tchaikovsky opposite her starring role as the composer's patron Nadezhda von Meck.|$|E
25|$|The {{airport was}} {{designed}} to be larger than any in the world, bigger in size <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> York, London, Berlin, Paris, Chicago, and Philadelphia ones put together. Woodhouse claimed it would eventually become the combined size of the airports of Croydon in London, Le Bourget in Paris, Tempelhof in Berlin, Roosevelt Field in New York, Chicago's Air Park, and Boston's Jeffery Field. However, the airport never did develop as intended and a 1949 picture taken from an airplane showed no evidence of the three world's longest runways which had been illustrated in earlier depictions.|$|E
50|$|Construction {{began on}} <b>the</b> <b>new</b> span in 1988. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> $54 million {{southbound}} span was opened to traffic in 1990. The older bridge was then closed, rehabilitated, and reopened in 1992. The older northbound span is shorter {{and has a}} steeper hump <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> southbound span.|$|R
5|$|Quebec's {{transmission}} system contains {{a variety of}} electrical pylons depending on era and voltage level. Older pylon designs tend to consume more material <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> pylons and <b>the</b> higher the voltage level, the larger the tower.|$|R
5000|$|Eisregen's old albums {{were more}} black metal {{influenced}} <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> ones. <b>The</b> violin parts, now typical for the band, came with [...] "Krebskolonie" [...] (Cancer Colony), considered as their best album {{by many of}} their fans.|$|R
25|$|Construction management, {{extremely}} centralized {{until the}} reign of Alexander II, was gradually decentralized in the 1880s–1890s. The right to initiate individual construction projects passed from the Emperor himself to imperial ministers and department chiefs. In 1896 admiral Pavel Tyrtov, director of the Imperial Russian Navy Ministry, started preparations to build a cathedral in Kronstadt in earnest. Tyrtov insisted that the cathedral be built on the site identified nearly two centuries earlier by Peter I and reasoned {{that it should not}} cost more <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> Kharkov cathedral (200,000 roubles).|$|E
25|$|It follows that, in general, the {{defenders}} of the new calendar hold the view that in localities where the Church's episcopal authority has elected to adopt the new calendar, but where some have broken communion with those implementing this change, it is those who have broken communion who have in fact introduced the disunity, rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> calendar itself or those who have adopted it— although most would agree that attempts at various times to mandate {{the use of the}} new calendar through compulsion, have magnified the disunity.|$|E
25|$|Many {{residents}} were {{outraged by the}} raid on the family home. The Missouri state legislature narrowly defeated a bill that praised the James and Younger brothers and offered them amnesty. Allowed to vote and hold office again, former Confederates in the legislature voted to limit the size of rewards which the governor could make for fugitives. This extended a measure of protection over the James–Younger gang by minimizing the incentive for attempting to capture them. The governor had offered rewards higher <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> limit only on Frank and Jesse James.|$|E
50|$|This has <b>the</b> {{effect that}} <b>new</b> Java {{installations}} only provide new language features and bug fixes, {{but they do}} not correct security vulnerabilities, because malicious programs can look for the older prior Java releases and use them rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>newest</b> versions.|$|R
25|$|The {{cosmology}} of Korea {{has changed}} over time as new religions have been imported into the country and been slowly syncretized. Also, there are larger regional differences with the older mythology rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> mythology when <b>the</b> country became united.|$|R
50|$|Another paper tries it: The Herald Mexico, {{published}} by El Universal circulated in Mexico City. It was published through a joint-venture between The Miami Herald and El Universal. It {{was a much}} smaller publication <b>than</b> <b>The</b> <b>News</b> and closed on May 31, 2007.|$|R
25|$|During the Throne Speech on October 16, 2007, the {{government}} made word {{that they want}} to extend the mission until 2011 after finishing the training of Afghan military and police officers in which it mentions that {{it would be impossible to}} conclude by 2009 although a vote would be proposed on the issue. While the Throne Speech passed, General Rick Hillier mentioned that the mission could take another 10 years at least before training and re-building the Afghan army, thus 6 years further <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> proposed deadline for the end of the mission. A confidence mention is scheduled for Spring 2008.|$|E
25|$|A further radical {{step was}} to abandon the 3½-inch floppy disk drive which had been present in every Macintosh since the first in 1984. Apple argued that {{recordable}} CDs, the Internet, and office networks were quickly making diskettes obsolete, however, Apple's omission generated controversy. At the time of iMac's introduction, third-party manufacturers offered external USB floppy disk drives, often in translucent plastic to match the iMac's enclosure. Apple had initially announced the internal modem in the iMac would operate at only 33.6 kbit/s rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> 56 kbit/s speed, but was forced by consumer pressure to adopt the faster standard.|$|E
25|$|The Los Angeles {{crime family}} is an Italian American {{criminal}} {{organization based in}} California, {{as part of the}} American Mafia (or Cosa Nostra). Since its inception in the early 20th century, it has spread throughout Southern California. Like most Mafia families in the United States, the L.A. crime family gained power bootlegging during the Prohibition Era. The L.A. family reached its peak in the 1940s and early 1950s under Jack Dragna, who was on The Commission, although the L.A. family was never bigger <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> York or Chicago families. Since his death the crime family has been on a gradual decline, with the Chicago Outfit representing them on The Commission.|$|E
50|$|Today {{the church}} {{congregation}} is unusual among {{those of the}} modern Episcopal Church, as it uses the traditional 1928 edition of the Book of Common Prayer. Some weekday services use the Anglican Missal, rather <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> 1979 edition Book of Common Prayer.|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} {{lots of other}} packs before Winning Moves UK took over. These {{have been made by}} Waddingtons, Dubreq, Ace and many other {{companies}} up until 1999. These packs are usually rarer <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> Winning Moves packs as they are much older.|$|R
50|$|The First {{boat house}} used by KSBC {{was nothing more}} than a large shed. Today one would pass it by with little thought of its {{tremendous}} history. It is located on the other side of the Macedonia Brook farther down river <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> boat houses.|$|R
25|$|The New Zealand greater short-tailed bat (Mystacina robusta) {{is one of}} {{two species}} of New Zealand short-tailed bats, a family (Mystacinidae) unique to New Zealand. Larger <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Zealand lesser short-tailed bat, there have been no {{confirmed}} sightings of this species since 1965 and it is considered to be critically endangered, if not extinct. In prehistoric times it lived in the North and South Islands but by the time of European arrival was restricted to small islands near Stewart Island/Rakiura. It is thought that a rat invasion of Taukihepa/Big South Cape Island in 1963 led to the species extinction.|$|E
25|$|Midway {{through the}} third quarter, Allen lost a fumble {{that led to}} Franklin's field goal, tying the game back up at 20. Then in {{what turned out to}} be the key play of the game, Raiders cornerback Sam Seale fumbled the ensuing kickoff, and Bowman {{recovered}} in the end zone for a touchdown to give his team a 27–20 lead. There was still a full quarter left to play, but the Raiders would get no further in the game <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> England 41-yard line. Los Angeles' three fourth quarter drives would result in a punt, an interception by Fred Marion and a turnover on downs at their own 13.|$|E
25|$|Australia bowled well, Bronwyn Calver, Karen Rolton and Charmaine Mason {{taking two}} wickets each, with Cathryn Fitzpatrick taking 1/22 off ten overs, {{including}} that of Hockley's wicket. Australia were set 165 runs to win, and began solidly, reaching 107/2 with Belinda Clark reaching 52 before being caught and bowled by Catherine Campbell. Knocks of 37 from Michelle Goszko and Karen Rolton's 24 enabled Australia to reach 165/5 from 47.4 overs, three minutes quicker <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>New</b> Zealand innings of 176 minutes. The New Zealand bowlers shared two wickets each between Keenan and Kathryn Ramel, with the former the most economical, taking 2/23 at 2.30 an over, however they could not prevent Australia's victory.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} side, the M1909/37 was rugged and reliable. It was also lighter <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> M-30 or <b>the</b> 10.5 cm le.F.H.16. It was similar in most {{characteristics}} to another modernized World War I-era howitzer in Soviet service, the M1910/30, except slower rate of fire.|$|R

40|$|QUESTION Many of my {{pregnant}} and breastfeeding patients suffer from allergies and frequently {{ask me about}} the safety of antihistamines during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Should I advise them to use the older sedating medications? I have heard that they might be safer <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> nonsedating class of drugs. Or have <b>the</b> <b>newer</b> ones been studied as well...|$|R
