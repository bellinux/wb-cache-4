500|$|At 11:35p.m., Obama {{appeared}} on major television networks:Good evening. Tonight, I can report <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> {{to the world}} that the United States has conducted an operation that killed Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaeda, and a terrorist who was responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men, women, and children... President Obama recalled the victims of the September 11 attacks. He praised the nearly ten-year-old war against al-Qaeda, which he said had disrupted terrorist plots, strengthened homeland defenses, removed the Taliban government, and captured or killed scores of al-Qaeda operatives. Obama said that when he took office he made finding bin Laden the top priority of the war. Bin Laden's death was the most significant blow to al-Qaeda so far but the war would continue. He reaffirmed that the U.S. was not at war against Islam and defended his decision to conduct an operation within Pakistan. He said Americans understood the cost of war but would not stand by while their security was threatened. [...] "To those families who have lost loved ones to al-Qaeda's terror," [...] he said, [...] "justice has been done." [...] This remark book-ended President Bush's statement to a joint session of Congress following the September 11 attacks that [...] "justice will be done." ...|$|E

60|$|Mr. PRESIDENT AND Mr. SPEAKER, AND GENTLEMEN OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF OHIO:--It is true, as {{has been}} said by the {{president}} of the Senate, that very great responsibility rests upon me in the position to which the votes of the American people have called me. I am deeply sensible of that weighty responsibility. I cannot but know what you all know, that without a name, perhaps without a reason why I should have a name, there has fallen upon me a task such as did not rest even upon the Father of his Country; and so feeling, I can turn and look for that support without which it will be impossible for me to perform that great task. I turn, then, and look <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>people</b> <b>and</b> to that God who has never forsaken them. Allusion has been made to the interest felt in relation to the policy of the new administration. In this I have received from some a degree of credit for having kept silence, and from others some deprecation. I still think that I was right.|$|E

And in a recent letter to New Jersey Democrats we find him warning his party, or more properly the nation, of the domestic social changes necessarily flowing from his international program. While rightly resolved to prosecute the war on the battle lines to the utmost limit of American resources, {{he points out that}} the true significance of the conflict lies in [...] "revolutionary change." [...] "Economic and social forces," [...] he says, [...] "are being released upon the world, whose effect no political seer dare to conjecture." [...] And we [...] "must search our hearts through and through and make them ready for the birth of a new day--a day we hope and believe of greater opportunity and greater prosperity for the average mass of struggling men and women." [...] He recognizes that the next great step in the development of democracy which the war must bring about--is the emancipation of labour; to use his own phrase, the redemption of masses of men and women from [...] "economic serfdom." [...] "The old party slogans," [...] he declares, [...] "will mean nothing to the future." ...|$|E
