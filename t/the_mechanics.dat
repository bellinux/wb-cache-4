50|$|The {{trial court}} awarded Picard $60,366 in {{compensatory}} damages {{and an additional}} $6,350 in punitive damages. The Supreme Court held that <b>the</b> <b>mechanic</b> committed battery, because <b>the</b> <b>mechanic</b> caused an offensive or unconsensual touching upon the body of Picard, regardless of <b>the</b> <b>mechanic's</b> intent to injure. Items attached to or identified with the plaintiff's body, such as the camera, also count. The court also found that <b>the</b> <b>mechanic</b> committed assault. <b>The</b> court vacated the award and remanded {{for a new trial}} on damages.|$|R
50|$|The next day, {{the driver}} of the jeep reaches a nearby garage in a two wheeler and picks up <b>the</b> <b>mechanic</b> to <b>the</b> jeep. On querying, <b>the</b> <b>mechanic</b> was told that toys were present in <b>the</b> jeep. <b>The</b> <b>mechanic</b> finds fault with the diesel pipe of the jeep. The driver goes in the two wheeler to get a new diesel pipe. During the course of time, <b>the</b> <b>mechanic</b> smells {{something}} fishy, when he notices the parts of broken indicator light of the two wheeler lying on the ground. He also finds that the registration number of the jeep was actually a fake one stickered on the numbered plate. When he enquires to the assistant, the assistant gets arrogant asking him to mind his own business. When the assistant moves into a short sleep, <b>the</b> <b>mechanic</b> checks <b>the</b> load within the jeep and finds swords and similar weapons concealed within vegetable boxes. On seeing this the assistant gets angry and he beats <b>the</b> <b>mechanic.</b> While <b>the</b> driver returns with a newly bought diesel pipe, <b>the</b> <b>mechanic</b> refuses to repair the jeep, and asks for the person who came in the two wheeler. The driver shows him with mouth and hands tied, hidden in a nearby area. The two wheeler guy pleads to free him as it is a borrowed bike, and his marriage is approaching and that he has to invite a few relatives that day. The driver tells that once the jeep gets repaired, they all can go. However <b>the</b> <b>mechanic</b> stays still. <b>The</b> assistant gets angry with mechanic as he stays stubborn without repairing the jeep, and hits him again. While they hear the sound of another two wheeler approaching, they hide <b>the</b> <b>mechanic</b> and two wheeler guy and somehow manages to handle the situation without any problem and sends them off. The driver asks the two wheeler guy to do something so that <b>the</b> <b>mechanic</b> repairs <b>the</b> jeep and that they all can leave. However <b>the</b> <b>mechanic</b> stays still, to which the driver gets annoyed and hits <b>the</b> <b>mechanic.</b> Ultimately <b>the</b> driver and assistant flee the scene in the two wheeler. The assistant guy of <b>the</b> <b>mechanic</b> arrives there with the lunch in a bicycle and he sets the two wheeler guy free. <b>The</b> <b>mechanic</b> then flattens <b>the</b> jeep tyres and they leave the scene, taking the two wheeler guy pledging to leave him at the nearest junction where he can get some form of vehicle.|$|R
5000|$|The College of Engineering and Science and its {{predecessors}} {{have had two}} main homes on the Tech campus since 1904.

This building housed <b>the</b> <b>Mechanic</b> Arts Department (which over time expanded into the School of Engineering) from 1904 until 1940. <b>The</b> <b>Mechanic</b> Arts Building was demolished shortly after the erection of Bogard Hall {{on the east side}} of the campus.|$|R
5|$|The {{game was}} well {{received}} in arcades and by critics, who praised the gameplay, <b>the</b> <b>mechanics</b> of which influenced titles by other developers. Joust {{was followed by}} a sequel four years later, and was ported to numerous home and portable platforms.|$|E
5|$|An article {{published}} in 1997 reported research of <b>the</b> <b>mechanics</b> of Apatosaurus tails by Nathan Myhrvold and paleontologist Philip J. Currie. Myhrvold carried out a computer simulation of the tail, which in diplodocids like Apatosaurus was a very long, tapering structure resembling a bullwhip. This computer modeling suggested sauropods were capable of producing a whiplike cracking sound of over 200 decibels, comparable to the volume of a cannon being fired.|$|E
5|$|Cheng {{related in}} an {{interview}} that Don't Starves development taught Klei a considerable amount {{about the nature of the}} emergent gameplay that was endemic to its open and random world; Klei tries to experiment with a new genre with each project and prefers not to create sequels to any of its games.

5|$|Fukuda's {{training}} method consisted mostly {{of the student}} taking fall after fall for the teacher or senior student until he began to understand <b>the</b> <b>mechanics</b> of the technique. Fukuda stressed applied technique over ritual form. He gave beginners a short description of the technique and had them engage in free practice (randori) in order to teach through experience. It was only after the student had attained some proficiency that he taught them traditional forms (kata). This method was difficult, as there were no special mats for falling, only the standard straw mats (tatami) laid over wooden floors.|$|E
5|$|McCudden {{was based}} at Farnborough and began his {{training}} on 22 February 1916. He {{started with a}} 20-minute flight in a Henry Farman pusher. McCudden had already flown 100 hours as a passenger with 25 different pilots including 46 hours as a regular observer since November 1915 and had much experience with his surroundings. His instructor was impressed with his grasp of <b>the</b> <b>mechanics</b> and theory. He practiced six landings and progressed to the more powerful Avro 504 as the last Farman had been written off by another student.|$|E

5|$|Peléan eruptions are {{characterized}} most prominently by the incandescent pyroclastic flows that they drive. <b>The</b> <b>mechanics</b> of a Peléan eruption {{are very similar}} to that of a Vulcanian eruption, except that in Peléan eruptions the volcano's structure is able to withstand more pressure, hence the eruption occurs as one large explosion rather than several smaller ones.|$|E
5|$|Some critics {{consider}} The Man in the Moone, {{along with}} Kepler's Somnium, {{to be one}} of the first works of science fiction. The book was well known in the 17th century, and even inspired parodies by Cyrano de Bergerac and Aphra Behn, but has been neglected in critical history. Recent studies have focused on Godwin's theories of language, <b>the</b> <b>mechanics</b> of lunar travel, and his religious position and sympathies as evidenced in the book.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the twentieth}} century, <b>the</b> <b>mechanics</b> of how dew {{condenses}} were much better understood. The key insight was that low-mass collectors which rapidly lose heat by radiation perform best. A number of researchers worked on this method. In the early 1960s, dew condensers made from sheets of polyethylene supported on a simple frame resembling a ridge tent were used in Israel to irrigate plants. Saplings supplied with dew and very slight rainfall from these collectors survived much better than the control group planted without such aids– they all dried up over the summer. In 1986 in New Mexico condensers made of a special foil produced sufficient water to supply young saplings.|$|E
5|$|Development of Shiny Festa {{began as}} a result of series {{producer}} Yōzō Sakagami's desire to create a video game that has a lighter feel and makes use of the franchise's songs that had not been featured in video game form. Shiny Festa original releases sold a total of 119,132 copies in its first week of release in Japan, and together ranked as the best-selling video game in Japan that week. The games were described by reviewers as accessible to the franchise's new and existing fans, but the iOS releases were criticized by journalists for their prohibitive pricing. <b>The</b> <b>mechanics</b> of Shiny Festa later reappear in The Idolmaster Shiny TV, a high-definition remastered version for the PlayStation 3.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s various {{internal}} {{changes and}} improvements {{were made to}} <b>the</b> <b>mechanics.</b> In 1969 the hammer tips were changed to neoprene rubber instead of felt, to avoid the excessive need for regular maintenance, while in 1975 harp supports were changed from wood to aluminum. Although this made production cheaper, it changed the resonance of the instrument slightly. In 1977 the power amplifier design was changed from an 80 to a 100-watt model. The Mk II model was introduced in late 1979, which was simply a set of cosmetic changes over the most recent Mk I models. A new 54-note model {{was added to the}} range.|$|E
