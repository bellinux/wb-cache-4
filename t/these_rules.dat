5|$|<b>These</b> <b>rules,</b> {{drawn up}} by the club for this initial tournament, were {{eventually}} adopted for the entire sport and, with only slight modifications, have retained their validity. All matches during the tournament were played as best-of-five sets.|$|E
5|$|To <b>these</b> <b>rules</b> we must add {{a further}} one for closed loops that implies an {{integration}} on momenta , since these internal ("virtual") particles are not constrained to any specific energy–momentum – even that usually required by special relativity (see this article for details).|$|E
50|$|Both of <b>these</b> <b>rule</b> {{changes were}} soon adopted into {{all levels of}} the game.|$|R

50|$|Nonetheless, it {{has been}} noted that <b>these</b> <b>rule</b> changes have made certain kinds of boxing deaths far rarer, though boxing remains the 8th most deadly sport with 1.3 deaths per 100,000 participants.|$|R
5|$|A One Day International, or an ODI, is an {{international}} cricket match between two representative teams, each having ODI status, {{as determined by the}} International Cricket Council. both players are listed as receiving a cap for this match. <b>These</b> <b>rules</b> were not in place for the 2007 Afro-Asia Cup.|$|E
5|$|Also in the 1920s, Victor Moritz Goldschmidt {{and later}} Linus Pauling {{developed}} rules for eliminating chemically unlikely structures and {{for determining the}} relative sizes of atoms. <b>These</b> <b>rules</b> led {{to the structure of}} brookite (1928) and an understanding of the relative stability of the rutile, brookite and anatase forms of titanium dioxide.|$|E
5|$|In June 2006 the EIHL {{announced}} {{the adoption of}} the 'zero tolerance' interpretation of the rules with regard to holding, hooking and interference implemented in the National Hockey League during the 2005–06 season. <b>These</b> <b>rules</b> had proved highly successful in the NHL, increasing the pace of the game and leading to a rise in spectator numbers.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the fuzzy}} system output is a {{consensus}} {{of all of the}} inputs and all of the rules, fuzzy logic systems can be well behaved when input values are not available or are not trustworthy. Weightings can be optionally added to each rule in the rulebase and weightings can be used to regulate {{the degree to which a}} rule affects the output values. <b>These</b> <b>rule</b> weightings can be based upon the priority, reliability or consistency of each <b>rule.</b> <b>These</b> <b>rule</b> weightings may be static or can be changed dynamically, even based upon the output from other rules.|$|R
2500|$|The main {{motivations for}} <b>these</b> <b>rule</b> changes were {{protection}} of {{the health of the}} fighters, the desire to shed the perception of [...] "barbarism and lawlessness", and to be recognized as a legitimate sport.|$|R
50|$|The XBRL {{standard}} has {{the ability}} to define business <b>rules.</b> <b>These</b> business <b>rules</b> can be found in different places in the XBRL taxonomy, that is in datatypes or linkbases.

5|$|Nearly all {{butterflies}} are diurnal, {{have relatively}} bright colours, and hold their wings vertically above their bodies when at rest, unlike {{the majority of}} moths which fly by night, are often cryptically coloured (well camouflaged), and either hold their wings flat (touching the surface on which the moth is standing) or fold them closely over their bodies. Some day-flying moths, such as the hummingbird hawk-moth, are exceptions to <b>these</b> <b>rules.</b>|$|E
5|$|Within {{six months}} of the {{original}} ruling, the ICC ultimately decided to change the 12-hour work limit in 24hours to a 10-hour driving limit in 24hours, and the 15-hour on-duty limit was rescinded. Motor carriers were required to give drivers 8, rather than 9, consecutive hours off-duty each day. <b>These</b> <b>rules</b> allowed for 10hours of driving and 8hours of rest within a 24-hour day.|$|E
5|$|Between 1962 and 2003, {{there were}} {{numerous}} proposals to change the HOS again, but none were ever finalized. By this time, the ICC had been abolished, and regulations were now issued by the FMCSA. The 2003 changes applied only to property-carrying drivers (i.e., truck drivers). <b>These</b> <b>rules</b> allowed 11hours of driving within a 14-hour period, and required 10hours of rest. These changes would allow drivers (using the entire 14-hour on-duty period) to maintain a natural 24-hour cycle, with a bare minimum 21-hour cycle (11hours driving, 10hours rest). However, the retention of the split sleeper berth provision would allow drivers to maintain irregular, short-burst sleeping schedules.|$|E
50|$|<b>These</b> <b>rule</b> {{changes will}} {{certainly}} affect “New Winkies” {{but whether it}} can still be played in an adapted form, only time will tell, although 2009's XV's match used the new rules - this indicates that the new rules are to be kept.|$|R
50|$|The Rules Committee {{was formed}} on April 2, 1789, {{during the first}} Congress. However, it had nowhere near the {{powerful}} role it has today. Instead, it merely proposed general rules for the House to follow when debating bills (rather than passing a special rule for each bill), and was dissolved after proposing <b>these</b> general <b>rules.</b> <b>These</b> general <b>rules</b> still have {{a great impact on}} the tone of the House floor today.|$|R
50|$|<b>These</b> three {{additional}} <b>rules</b> extend the propositional system to axiomatise classical predicate logic. Likewise, <b>these</b> three <b>rules</b> extend system for intuitionstic propositional logic (with P1-3 and P4i and P5i) to intuitionistic predicate logic.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the death}} in 1838 of another fighter, William Phelps, {{also known as}} Brighton Bill, in a match against Owen Swift, the London Prize Ring Rules were {{introduced}} by the Pugilists's Protective Association to more clearly define the range of fouls and to introduce certain safety measures. Butting, gouging, biting, scratching, kicking were all forbidden as {{was the use of}} stones or any hard object in the hand. Thirty-second breaks were introduced between rounds, {{at the end of which}} each fighter had to walk to the scratch unaided within 8seconds. The wearing of spiked boots was prohibited, and boxers who went to ground without being hit were disqualified. <b>These</b> <b>rules</b> still form the basis for the modern sport of boxing.|$|E
5|$|In 1938, the now-abolished Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) {{enforced}} {{the first}} HOS rules. Drivers {{were limited to}} 12hours of work within a 15-hour period. Work was defined as loading, unloading, driving, handling freight, preparing reports, preparing vehicles for service, or performing any other duty pertaining to the transportation of passengers or property. The ICC intended the 3-hour difference between 15hours on-duty and 12hours {{of work to be}} used for meals and rest breaks. The weekly maximum was limited to 60hours over 7days (non-daily drivers), or 70hours over 8days (daily drivers). <b>These</b> <b>rules</b> allowed for 12hours of work within a 15-hour period, 9hours of rest, with 3hours for breaks within a 24-hour day.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{members of}} the European Union signed an {{agreement}} known as the Maastricht Treaty, under which they pledged to limit their deficit spending and debt levels. Some EU member states, including Greece and Italy, were able to circumvent <b>these</b> <b>rules</b> and mask their deficit and debt levels {{through the use of}} complex currency and credit derivatives structures. The structures were designed by prominent US investment banks, who received substantial fees in return for their services and who took on little credit risk themselves thanks to special legal protections for derivatives counterparties. Financial reforms within the U.S. since the financial crisis have only served to reinforce special protections for derivatives—including greater access to government guarantees—while minimising disclosure to broader financial markets.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>these</b> <b>rule</b> changes, this season {{marked the first}} time that the league commissioner became involved in enforcement of player conduct standards. Commissioner Elmer Layden in August assessed $25 fines on Green Bay Packers quarterback Larry Craig and New York Giants halfback Hank Soar for fighting.|$|R
40|$|We {{document}} a flypaper {{effect in}} asset allocation: securities received in kind "stick where they hit. " We study {{a firm that}} twice changed the rules governing the securities in which its 401 (k) matching contributions were initially invested. Both of <b>these</b> <b>rule</b> changes were economically neutral: employees were always free to immediately reallocate their match account balances. However, we find that most employees neither reallocate their match balances, nor offset employer-initiated changes in the match allocation by adjusting the allocation of their own contributions. Consequently, <b>these</b> <b>rule</b> changes caused dramatic shifts in participants' 401 (k) portfolio risk. After examining several alternative explanations for this flypaper effect, we conclude that it {{is largely due to}} a combination of passivity and mental accounting. asset allocation, 401 (k), employee contributions Working Paper Series...|$|R

5|$|In {{the same}} period, {{different}} helms {{began to be}} used for different ranks: sovereigns' and knights' helms faced forwards (affronté), whereas those of peers and gentlemen faced to the right (dexter). In the medieval period crests would always have faced {{the same way as the}} helm, but as a result of <b>these</b> <b>rules,</b> the directions of the crest and the helm might be at variance: a knight whose crest was a lion statant, would have the lion depicted as looking over the side of the helm, rather than towards the viewer. Torses also suffered artistically, being treated not as silken circlets, but as horizontal bars.|$|E
5|$|Local wine-labeling {{regulations}} are slowly {{catching up with}} the DNA evidence, a process that has been slowed by trade disputes. The European Union recognized Zinfandel as a synonym for Primitivo in January 1999, meaning that Italian Primitivos can be labelled as Zinfandel in the United States and any other country that recognises EU labelling laws. Italian winemakers {{have taken advantage of}} <b>these</b> <b>rules</b> and shipped Primitivo wines to the United States labelled as Zinfandels, with the approval of the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB).|$|E
5|$|Many LARPs have game {{rules that}} {{determine}} how characters can affect {{each other and}} the setting. The rules may be defined in a publication or created by the gamemasters. <b>These</b> <b>rules</b> may define characters' capabilities, what can be done with various objects that exist in the setting, and what characters can do during the downtime between LARP events. Because referees are often not available to mediate all character actions, players are relied upon to be honest in their application of the rules.|$|E

5|$|Mushers {{must start}} the race with at most {{fourteen}} dogs and finish with {{no fewer than}} six. Dogs are visually examined by veterinarians stationed at every checkpoint, and mushers can be ejected and banned from the race for mistreating dogs. Dog whips and forced feeding are forbidden. Participating dogs may not receive injections during the race or be {{under the influence of}} performance-enhancing substances such as steroids. The race marshal may remove any team from the race for violations of <b>these</b> <b>rules</b> or substandard dog care.|$|E
5|$|One {{objection}} is that two-level utilitarianism undermines an agent's {{commitment to}} act in accordance {{with his or her}} moral principles. For example, a theist will comply with his/her moral code because he/she sees it as based upon God's will. However, a two-level utilitarian knows that his everyday set of moral rules is merely a guideline, and as such any breach of <b>these</b> <b>rules</b> is unlikely to accompany the same degree of guilt as would someone who believed that it was wrong in principle {{to act in}} that way.|$|E
5|$|The Critters rule is a block {{cellular}} automaton in which, at each step, {{the cells of}} the automaton are partitioned into 2×2 blocks and each block is updated independently of the other blocks. Its transition function flips the state of every cell in a block that does not have exactly two live cells, and in addition rotates by 180° blocks with exactly three live cells. Because this function is invertible, the automaton defined by <b>these</b> <b>rules</b> is a reversible {{cellular automaton}}.|$|E
