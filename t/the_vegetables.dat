5|$|In the 1760s and 1770s, botany became {{increasingly}} popular in Britain {{because of the}} translation of Linnaeus's works into English. One {{of the most prominent}} books about botany was William Withering's Botanical Arrangement of all <b>the</b> <b>Vegetables</b> Naturally Growing in Great Britain (1776), which used Linnaeus's system for classifying plants. Withering's book went through multiple editions and became the standard text on British plants for a generation. The book delighted and intrigued experts, amateurs, and children alike.|$|E
5|$|Mahshi (pl. mahshi) {{dishes are}} {{composed}} of rice stuffed vegetables such as, eggplants, baby pumpkins, potatoes, carrots and marrows {{as well as a}} variety of leaf vegetables, primarily grape leaves, cabbage leaves and less often chard. Mahshi requires delicacy and time—the main reason it is prepared before the day it is cooked and served. Many female family members participate in the rolling and stuffing of <b>the</b> <b>vegetables,</b> relaxing the amount of individual effort required, with great attention to detail.|$|E
50|$|The {{shelf life}} of {{celeriac}} is approximately {{six to eight}} months if stored between 0 C and 5 C, and not allowed to dry out. However, <b>the</b> <b>vegetable</b> will tend to rot through the centre if the finer stems surrounding the base are left attached. The freshness of <b>the</b> <b>vegetable</b> can be determined by viewing the hollowness of the vegetable; a fresh celeriac should not have a hollow centre. The freshness of <b>the</b> <b>vegetable</b> will also be obvious from the taste; <b>the</b> older <b>the</b> <b>vegetable,</b> <b>the</b> less potent the celery flavour.|$|R

5|$|Stews {{are basic}} fare {{for every day}} family cooking and are always served with {{vermicelli}} rice or plain rice. They are popular because they provide {{a wide range of}} nutrients from the meat, <b>the</b> <b>vegetables</b> and the rice. The extra liquid is also essential in such dry climate. Stews are also economically beneficial, as they provide relatively small amount of meat into feeding large families, especially within the poorer population.|$|E

5|$|Gaza's cuisine is {{characterized}} by its generous use of spices and chillies. Other major flavors and ingredients include dill, chard, garlic, cumin, lentils, chickpeas, pomegranates, sour plums and tamarind. Many of the traditional dishes rely on clay pot cooking, which preserves the flavor and texture of <b>the</b> <b>vegetables</b> and results in fork-tender meat. Traditionally, most Gazan dishes are seasonal and rely on ingredients indigenous to the area and its surrounding villages.

Although popularized by the kibbutzim, versions of this mixed salad were brought to Israel from various places.

5|$|Strict Jains don't eat root {{vegetables}} such as potatoes, onions, roots and tubers. This is so because tiny life forms are injured when {{the plant is}} pulled up and because the bulb {{is seen as a}} living being, as it is able to sprout. Also, consumption of most {{root vegetables}} involves uprooting and killing the entire plant, in contrast to consumption of most other terrestrial vegetables, upon which the plant lives on after plucking <b>the</b> <b>vegetables</b> (or it was seasonally supposed to wither away anyway). Mushrooms, fungi and yeasts are forbidden because they are parasites, grow in non-hygienic environments, and may harbour other life forms. Alfalfa is the only known plant that contains vitamin D2, which they may use directly or make vitamin D2 supplements from. Honey is forbidden, as its collection would amount to violence against the bees.|$|E

At the time he was criticised for having produced a bowdlerised version of Linnaeus, deliberately omitting any references to sexual reproduction, out of a desire to protect 'female modesty', notably by the Lichfield Botanical Society. However he found plenty of support for his position, and botany was considered a subject unsuitable for many women during the next century.
