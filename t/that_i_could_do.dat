5|$|In 1935, Barbera {{created his}} first solo-effort {{storyboard}} about a character named Kiko the Kangaroo. The storyline was of Kiko {{in an airplane}} race with another character called Dirty Dog. Terry declined to produce the story. In his autobiography, Barbera said of his efforts..."I was, quite honestly, {{not in the least}} disappointed. I had proven to myself <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> a storyboard, and that I had gained the experience of presenting it. For now, that was enough."The original storyboard, which had been passed down through the Barbera family, went on sale at auction in November 2013.|$|E
500|$|In May 1994, Jackson married Lisa Marie Presley, the {{daughter}} of Elvis and Priscilla Presley. They had met in 1975, when a seven-year-old Presley attended one of Jackson's family engagements at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino, and reconnected through a mutual friend. According {{to a friend of}} Presley's, [...] "their adult friendship began in November 1992 in L.A." [...] They stayed in contact every day over the telephone. As the child molestation accusations became public, Jackson became dependent on Presley for emotional support; she was concerned about his faltering health and addiction to drugs. Presley said: [...] "I believed he didn't do anything wrong and that he was wrongly accused and yes I started falling for him. I wanted to save him. I felt <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it." [...] She eventually persuaded him to settle the civil case out of court and go into rehabilitation to recover.|$|E
500|$|Smith {{graduated}} from Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts in 1991 {{with a degree}} in philosophy and political science. [...] "Went straight through in four years", he explained to Under the Radar in 2003. [...] "I guess it proved to myself <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> something I really didn't want to for four years. Except I did like what I was studying. At the time it seemed like, 'This is your one and only chance {{to go to college and}} you had just better do it because some day you might wish that you did.' Plus, the whole reason I applied in the first place was because of my girlfriend, and I had gotten accepted already even though we had broken up before the first day." [...] After he graduated, he [...] "worked in a bakery back in Portland with a bachelor's degree in philosophy and legal theory".|$|E

500|$|When Cher was {{in fifth}} grade, she {{produced}} {{a performance of}} the musical Oklahoma! for her teacher and class. She organized a group of girls, directing and choreographing their dance routines. Unable to convince boys to participate, she acted the male roles and sang their songs. By age nine, she had developed an unusually low voice. Fascinated by film stars, Cher's role model was Audrey Hepburn, particularly due to {{her role in the}} 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's. Cher began to take after the unconventional outfits and behavior of Hepburn's character. She was disappointed by the absence of dark-haired Hollywood actresses whom she could emulate then. She had wanted to be famous since childhood but felt unattractive and untalented, later commenting, [...] "I couldn't think of anything <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do...</b> I didn't think I'd be a singer or dancer. I just thought, well, I'll be famous. That was my goal." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{first met}} Lisa Marie Presley (and Elvis Presley) in 1974, during a Jackson 5 {{engagement}} at the MGM Grand. In November 1992, Jackson was reconnected with Presley through a mutual friend, staying in contact {{almost every day}} by telephone. As the child sexual abuse accusations became public, he became dependent on Presley for emotional support; she was concerned about his faltering health and his addiction to drugs. She explained, [...] "I believed he didn't do anything wrong {{and that he was}} wrongly accused and yes I started falling for him. I wanted to save him. I felt <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it." [...] In one phone call he made to her, she described him as high, incoherent and delusional. He proposed to her over the phone towards the fall of 1993, saying, [...] "If I asked you to marry me, would you do it?". The marriage was, in her words, [...] "a married couple's life ... that was sexually active". They divorced fewer than two years later, remaining friendly.|$|E
500|$|Ingres' {{early career}} {{coincided with the}} Romantic movement, which reacted against the {{prevailing}} neoclassical style. Neoclassicism in French art had developed as artists saw themselves {{as part of the}} cultural center of Europe, and France as the successor to Rome. Romantic painting was freer and more expressive, preoccupied more with colour than with line or form, and more focused on style than on subject matter. Paintings based on classical themes fell out of fashion, replaced by contemporary rather than historical subject matter, especially in portraiture. Ingres resisted this trend, and wrote, [...] "The history painter shows the species in general; while the portrait painter represents only the specific individual—a model often ordinary and full of shortcomings." [...] From his early career, Ingres' main source of income was commissioned portraits, a genre he dismissed as lacking in grandeur. The success of his The Vow of Louis XIII at the 1824 Salon marked an abrupt change in his fortunes: he received a series of commissions for large history paintings, and for the next decade he painted few portraits. [...] His financial difficulties behind him, Ingres could afford to concentrate on historical subjects, although he was highly sought-after as a portraitist. He wrote in 1847, [...] "Damned portraits, they are so difficult to do that they prevent me getting on with greater things <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> more quickly." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Then," [...] he said, very slowly, [...] "it {{would be}} useless to expect <b>that</b> {{anything}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> would ever induce you to once more have any confidence in me?" ...|$|R

2500|$|In March, Ponor competed at the Artistic Gymnastics World Cup {{event in}} Doha, Qatar. She placed first on balance beam {{with a score}} of 15.300 and first on floor with a score of 15.275. Ponor said, [...] "I {{want to do the}} same thing that I did in 2004. It was hard to make a comeback, but all the time I was {{thinking}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it. I will not relax till I reach my goal." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tyler was {{announced}} as the United Kingdom's entrant on 7 March 2013, and {{was met with}} a mixed reaction. [...] "Believe in Me" [...] was released on 13 March, and peaked at number 93 in the United Kingdom. As {{a member of the}} [...] "Big Five", the United Kingdom automatically qualified to the Eurovision Grand Final on 18 May. Tyler finished in 19th place with 23 points. Reacting to the results, Tyler stated, [...] "I did the best <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> with a great song", adding, [...] "I'm so glad and so happy that I did it because it was an incredible experience. It was like the Grammy awards all over again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Andrews' {{stepfather}} sponsored {{lessons for}} her, {{first at the}} Cone-Ripman School (now known commonly as ArtsEd), an independent arts educational school in London, then with concert soprano and voice instructor Madame Lilian Stiles-Allen. [...] "She had an enormous influence on me", Andrews said of Stiles-Allen, adding, [...] "She was my third mother– I've got more mothers and fathers {{than anyone in the}} world." [...] In her memoir Julie Andrews – My Star Pupil, Stiles-Allen records: [...] "The range, accuracy, and tone of Julie's voice amazed me ... she had possessed the rare gift of absolute pitch" [...] (though Andrews herself refutes this in her 2008 autobiography Home). According to Andrews: [...] "Madame was sure <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> Mozart and Rossini, but, to be honest, I never was". Of her own voice, she says [...] "I had a very pure, white, thin voice, a four-octave range – dogs would come for miles around." [...] After Cone-Ripman School, Andrews continued her academic education at the nearby Woodbrook School, a local state school in Beckenham.|$|E

6000|$|... "Up yonder," [...] he answered, tossing {{his head}} backward. [...] "I thought {{as we were}} neighbours, Mr. Upperton, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>do</b> less than look in and see if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> assist you in any way." ...|$|R
2500|$|Later in 1990, Alexandru Stefu (another {{old friend}} from Romania) invited Comăneci and Panait to Montreal, {{where he was}} staying {{with his family and}} Béla Károlyi. Comăneci noted in her memoir that after they arrived in Montreal, andwhen he finally had an {{opportunity}} to get me alone, Alexandru asked what was next for me. I told him that I was thinking about staying in Montreal, but hadn't yet mentioned the idea to [...] because he'd already booked us on a flight back to Los Angeles. The next day, Alexandru sent me to meet with the director of the Olympic stadium, who told me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> some exhibitions and appearances for him [...] When I woke up the next morning and went downstairs, Alexandru told me that [...] was gone. I never heard from him again, but I hope he is well and thank him for his help. I realize that our business relationship may have tarnished my name and image, but I safely escaped from Romania, and that is truly what was most important. There wasn't too much time to figure out why [...] had left because very soon after his departure, CNN contacted me.|$|E

60|$|I was too paralysed by the unexpectedness of {{the attack}} to form any plan; and, indeed, I {{do not think that}} there was {{anything}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>done.</b> <b>I</b> was unarmed and helpless. I stood there, waiting for the inevitable.|$|R
