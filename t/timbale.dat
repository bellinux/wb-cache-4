5|$|The book offered {{elaborate}} dishes, described with French terminology such as bisque, entrées, entremets, vol-au-vent, <b>timbale</b> and soufflé. It included {{bills of}} fare for meals {{for up to}} 300 people, and {{for a series of}} eight- or nine-course dinners served to Queen Victoria; one exceptional royal dinner in 1841 had sixteen entrées and sixteen entremets, including truffles in Champagne.|$|E
5|$|Even {{after the}} initial {{production}} of Trial by Jury, however, Carte continued to produce continental operetta, touring {{in the summer of}} 1876 with a repertoire consisting of English adaptations of French opera bouffe (Offenbach’s La Périchole, and La Grande-Duchesse de Gérolstein, Lecocq's La fille de Madame Angot and Léon Vasseur's La <b>Timbale</b> d'argent), paired with two one-act English after-pieces (Happy Hampstead and Trial by Jury). Carte acted as the musical director of this travelling company that included W.H. Denny.|$|E

5000|$|In French, <b>timbales</b> (...) is {{also the}} word for timpani, thus the French refer to Cuban <b>timbales</b> as <b>timbales</b> latines.|$|R
50|$|With songo, the <b>timbales</b> were {{expanded}} {{with the}} addition of a kick bass drum, and sometimes a snare drum and hi-hat. Songo uses a Cuban-style timbale/drum kit hybrid, which can be anything from standard <b>timbales</b> with kick, to a full drum kit augmented with <b>timbales,</b> woodblock, and various cowbells. Songo was the first Cuban popular dance rhythm to blend rumba and North American funk rhythms.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{style of}} soloing on <b>timbales</b> {{is known as}} típico ('typical'). Manny Oquendo (1931-2009) played <b>timbales</b> solos famous for their tastefully sparse, straight forward típico phrasing. The following five measure excerpt is from a <b>timbales</b> solo by Oquendo on [...] "Mambo." [...] The clave pattern is written above for reference. Notice how the passage begins and ends by coinciding with the strokes of clave.|$|R
25|$|New York based Machito's Afro-Cubans was {{the first}} band to make the triumvirate of congas, bongo, and timbales the {{standard}} battery of percussion in Cuban-based dance music. The three drums are used together in most salsa bands and function in ways similar to a traditional folkloric drum ensemble. The timbales play the bell pattern, the congas play the supportive drum part, and the bongos improvise, simulating a lead drum. The improvised variations of the bongos are executed {{within the context of}} a repetitive marcha, known as the martillo ('hammer'), and do not constitute a solo. The bongos play primarily during the verses and the piano solos. When the song transitions into the montuno section, the bongo player picks up a large hand held cowbell called the bongo bell. Often the bongocero plays the bell more during a piece, than the actual bongos. The interlocking counterpoint of the <b>timbale</b> bell and bongo bell provides a propelling force during the montuno. The maracas and guíro sound a steady flow of regular pulses (subdivisions) and are ordinarily clave-neutral.|$|E

2500|$|Since a chord {{progression}} {{can begin}} {{on either side}} of clave, percussionists {{have to be able to}} initiate their parts in either half (a single measure in [...] or [...] ). The following examples show clave with the bongo bell and <b>timbale</b> bell parts in both a 3-2 and a 2-3 sequence. The <b>timbale</b> bell comes from a stick pattern (cáscara) used in the Afro-Cuban folkloric rhythm guaguancó.|$|E
50|$|Timbalitos or pailitas {{are small}} <b>timbales</b> with diameters of 6″ (15 cm), 8″ (20 cm), or 10″ (25 cm). The timbalitos {{are used to}} play {{the part of the}} bongos with sticks and are not used to play the {{traditional}} <b>timbales</b> part. Papaíto and Manny Oquendo were masters at playing the bongó part on timbalitos. Timbalitos are sometimes incorporated into expanded <b>timbales</b> set-ups, or incorporated into drum kits.|$|R

2500|$|Timbales {{can be used}} {{to extend}} the range of tom-toms, {{particularly}} when the drummer owns them for other musical settings; a traditional <b>timbale</b> is tuned far higher than a tom of the same diameter, so the result is not always the most ideal (see also Timbales#Non-traditional use) ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{are related}} recipes in Latin America, where a corn meal mix is boiled and moulded into a <b>timbale</b> with other ingredients. Among them, cuscuz (...) , a popular recipe usually {{associated}} with Northeastern Brazil and its diaspora, a steamed cake of corn meal served with sugar and milk, varied meats, cheese and eggs or other ingredients.|$|E
2500|$|A {{standard}} drum kit {{is generally}} used in reggae, but the snare drum is often tuned very high {{to give it}} a timbales-type sound. Some reggae drummers use an additional <b>timbale</b> or high-tuned snare to get this sound. [...] Cross-stick technique on the snare drum is commonly used, and tom-tom drums are often incorporated into the drumbeat itself.|$|E
5000|$|In merengue tipico, known also as perico ripiao (the oldest form of merengue), the tambora has a {{significantly}} large role, playing {{many different types}} of rhythms and variations on those rhythms. However, in orchestra merengue, the tambora usually only plays the merengue derecho rhythm as a background instrument, while congas are the main rhythm instrument, followed by the güira. In orchestra merengue, a separate performer for <b>timbales</b> can be seen very frequently, while in perico ripiao, the <b>timbales</b> and tambora are played most of the time by the same musician (<b>timbales</b> are used most of the time for fills, and, occasionally, solos). <b>Timbales</b> are said to have been introduced into the genre by Dominican percussionist Ray [...] "Chino" [...] Diaz.|$|R

2500|$|The Sicilian {{influence}} on Maltese culture is extensive, and is especially {{evident in the}} local cuisine, {{with its emphasis on}} olive oil, pasta, seafood, fresh fruits and vegetables (especially the tomato), traditional appetizers such as caponata (Maltese: [...] "kapunata") and rice balls (arancini), speciality dishes such as rice <b>timbale</b> (Maltese: [...] "ross fil-forn"), and sweets such as the cassata and kannoli.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to D'León's performance, Cuban musicians had for {{the most}} part, {{rejected}} salsa, considering it bad imitation Cuban music. Something changed after d'León's performance. By that time, Cuban popular music had moved way beyond the old Cuban templates used in salsa. Cuba's momentary [...] "salsa craze" [...] brought back some of those older templates. For example, Orquesta Ritmo Oriental started using the most common salsa <b>timbale</b> bell and bongo bell combination. That bell arrangement became the standard for timba, which emerged {{at the end of}} the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|<b>Timbale</b> pans can {{be large}} (such as {{that used to}} bake a panettone), or they can be small enough to be single-portion (like a tartlet pan). Timbales {{typically}} narrow toward the bottom. Bundt pans, angelfood cake pans, and springform pans can be substituted for purpose-made <b>timbale</b> bakeware.|$|E

During the early 1940s Machito and his Afro-Cubans was the first band to employ the triumvirate of congas, bongos and timbales, the standard battery of percussion used in contemporary salsa.
