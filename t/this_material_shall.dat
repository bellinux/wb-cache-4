40|$|It is {{necessary}} to adapt ceramics to conventional metals, e. g. steel, in order to guarantee an extended application as an engineering material in machines and technical equipment. The different expansion coefficients {{in connection with the}} small temperature shock resistence lead to problems in metal-ceramics compounds. These problems can be reduced by Functionally Gradient Materials. Those materials posses one or more gradients of properties. The aim of our investigations was the development of graduated SiC-TiC ceramics where a gradual transition from SiC to TiC is realized. <b>This</b> <b>material</b> <b>shall</b> be used as a metal-ceramics compound. An interesting prospective results from the thermal expansion coefficient of TiC which is more similar to steel than to SiC. Therefore the thermal tension can be almost compensated, and a compound with a unimportent loss of strength not worth mentioning can be produced. It is also expected that a TiC-metal compound is easier to realize. As a result of the i nvestigations the microstructure in the transition zone has been evaluated of a pressureless sintered SiC-TiC ceramics with increasing TiC-content (up to 100 percent). The latent danger of cracking (forming tears, cracks) can be minimized by an appropriate choice of the TiC-concentration steps...|$|E
40|$|Triboluminescence {{is light}} that is {{produced}} by pressure, friction or mechanical shock. New composite materials are constantly being reengi neered {{in an effort to}} make lightweight spacecrafts for various NASA missions. For these materials there is interest in monitoring the con dition of the composite in real time to detect any delamination or cr acking due to damage, fatigue or external forces. Methods of periodic inspection of composite structures for mechanical damage such as ult rasonic testing are rather mature. However, there is a need to develop a new technique of damage detection for composites, which could dete ct cracking or delamination from any desired location within a materi al structure in real time. This could provide a valuable tool in the confident use of composite materials for various space applications. Recently, triboluminnescent materials have been proposed as smart sen sors of structural damage. To sense the damage, these materials can b e epoxy bonded or coated in a polymer matrix or embedded in a composi te host structure. When the damage or fracture takes place in the hos t structure, it will lead to the fracture of triboluminescent crystal s resulting in a light emission. This will warn, in real time, that a structural damage has occurred. The triboluminescent emission of the candidate phosphor has to be sufficiently bright, so that the light signal reaching from the point of fracture to the detector through a fiber optic cable is sufficiently strong to be detected. There are a large number of triboluminescent materials, but few satisfy the above criterion. Authors have synthesized a Eu based organic material know n as Europium tetrakis (dibenzoylmethide) triethylammonium. (EuD(sub 4) TEA), one of the bright triboluminescent materials, which is a pote ntial candidate for application as a damage sensor and could be made into a wireless sensor with the addition of microchip, antenna and el ectronics.

40|$|Recent {{interest}} in {{a new class of}} materials known collectively as metamaterials has sparked great {{interest in}} the antenna research community. Metamaterials are materials whose electrical properties go beyond those which can be achieved with conventional materials science.

The second is the horizontal electric dipole antenna with a double negative metamaterial coating operating at or just below the ocean 2 ̆ 7 s surface. In both cases, the Sommerfeld integral representation of the fields shall be derived and predictions on the antenna performance made. Should significant improvement be predicted, genetic algorithms shall be used to optimize the antenna 2 ̆ 7 s performance.
