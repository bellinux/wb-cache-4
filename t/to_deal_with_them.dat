5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the second}} day there was still no signs of the {{expected}} German ground attack. That night was also uneventful but just after stand to on 8 June, German infantry were observed advancing through the woods to their front. Holding fire until the last minute, the Germans were beaten back but ATroop found themselves surrounded on three sides and forced to withdraw. That night the Germans attacked again, this time targeting CTroop, but were again driven back. Shortly thereafter a group from No. 45 (Royal Marine) Commando arrived and reported that the Germans had broken through and were on the road behind No. 4 Commando. Captain Porteous and DTroop moved down the road <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> Outnumbered two to one DTroop charged, killing some and forcing the rest to withdraw.|$|E

5|$|Bessell, {{anxious to}} be of service to his party's highest-profile figure, flew to Dublin in April 1965. He found that Josiffe was being advised by a {{sympathetic}} Jesuit priest, Father Sweetman, who believed {{that at least some}} of Josiffe's allegations might be true; otherwise, he asked Bessell, why had he flown all the way from London <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>them?</b> Bessell warned Josiffe of the consequences of attempting to blackmail a public figure, but in a more conciliatory vein promised to help recover the missing luggage and insurance card. He also hinted at the possibility of an equestrian job in America. Bessell's intervention appeared to contain the problem, particularly as Josiffe's suitcase was recovered shortly afterwards—although, according to Josiffe, letters implicating Thorpe had been removed. For most of the following two years Josiffe remained largely quiescent in Ireland, attempting to establish himself in various careers; part of this time was spent in a monastery. It was during this period that he formally adopted the name of Scott.|$|E

5|$|Fermi's Chicago Pile-1 reactor, {{constructed}} {{under the}} west viewing stands {{of the original}} Stagg Field at the University of Chicago, went critical on December 2, 1942. This graphite-moderated reactor only generated up to 200 W, but it demonstrated that k was higher than anticipated. This not only removed most of the objections to air-cooled and water-cooled reactor designs, it greatly simplified {{other aspects of the}} design. Wigner's team submitted blueprints of a water-cooled reactor to DuPont in January 1943. By this time, the concerns of DuPont's engineers about the corrosiveness of water had been overcome by the mounting difficulties of using helium, and all work on helium was terminated in February. At the same time, air cooling was chosen for the reactor at the pilot plant. Since it would be of a quite different design from the production reactors, the X-10 Graphite Reactor lost its value as a prototype, but its value as a working pilot facility remained, providing plutonium needed for research. It was hoped that problems would be found in time <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> in the production plants. The semiworks would also be used for training, and for developing procedures.|$|E
5|$|Following a preparatory {{artillery}} barrage {{which began}} on 3 June, the battle commenced {{in the early}} hours of 7 June with the explosion of several mines which had been dug under the German lines. Over a million pounds of explosive were used, and the tremors were felt as far away as London. The New Zealanders were in the centre of the II ANZAC front, flanked by the British 25th Division and the 3rd Australian Division. This marked the first time the Australians and New Zealanders had fought alongside each other in a major engagement on the Western Front. The 2nd and Rifle Brigades quickly moved forward; the surviving German soldiers encountered initially were still dazed from the detonation of the mines and were quickly subdued and made prisoners of war. They continued to advance into stiffening resistance, but these opponents, soldiers of the 40th (Saxon) and 3rd (Bavarian) Divisions, were soon dealt with and the outskirts of Messines village were within sight. The Rifle Brigade's 3rd Battalion was attacking the village when it was slowed by two machine gun posts. Corporal Samuel Frickleton led his section on a successful foray <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> for which he was later awarded the VC.|$|E

5|$|The {{simultaneous}} {{arrival of}} aggressive new enemies– Turks {{in the east}} and Normans in the west– was another contributory factor. In 1040, the Normans, originally landless mercenaries from northern parts of Europe in search of plunder, began attacking Byzantine strongholds in southern Italy. In order <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> a mixed force of mercenaries and conscripts under the formidable George Maniakes was sent to Italy in 1042. Maniakes and his army conducted a brutally successful campaign, but before it could be concluded he was recalled to Constantinople. Angered by a series of outrages against his wife and property by one of his rivals, he was proclaimed emperor by his troops, and led them across the Adriatic to victory against a loyalist army. However, a mortal wound led to his death shortly afterwards. With opposition thus absent in the Balkans, the Normans were able to complete the expulsion of the Byzantines from Italy by 1071.|$|E
5|$|The most {{pressing}} threat for many species, particularly the smaller ones, comes from species introduced to their colonies. Procellariids overwhelmingly breed on islands away from land predators such as mammals, {{and for the}} most part have lost the defensive adaptations needed <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> (with the exception of the oil-spitting fulmarine petrels). The introduction of mammal predators such as feral cats, rats, mongooses and even mice can have disastrous results for ecologically naïve seabirds. These predators can either directly attack and kill breeding adults, or, more commonly, attack eggs and chicks. Burrowing species that leave their young unattended at a very early stage are particularly vulnerable to attack. Studies on grey-faced petrels breeding on New Zealand's Whale Island (Moutohora) have shown that a population under heavy pressure from Norway rats will produce virtually no young during a breeding season, whereas if the rats are controlled (through the use of poison), breeding success is much higher. That study also highlighted the role that non-predatory introduced species can play in harming seabirds; introduced rabbits on the island caused little damage to the petrels, other than damaging their burrows, but they also acted as a food source for the rats during the non-breeding season, which allowed rat numbers to be higher than they otherwise would be, resulting in more predators for the petrels to contend with. Interactions with introduced species can be quite complex. Gould's petrels breed only on two islands, Cabbage Tree Island and Boondelbah Island off Port Stephens (New South Wales). Introduced rabbits destroyed the forest understory on Cabbage Tree Island; this both increased the vulnerability of the petrels to natural predators and left them vulnerable to the sticky fruits of the birdlime tree (Pisonia umbellifera), a native plant. In the natural state these fruits lodge in the understory of the forest, but with the understory removed the fruits fall to the ground where the petrels move about, sticking to their feathers and making flight impossible.|$|E

Although (Generalized) LR parsers have many merits when applied to NL, most progress with extra-grammatical phenomena has been through rule-based systems, in contrast to the applications of LR parsers in programming languages. In this paper some techniques are developed to extend the ability of a (G) LR parser in <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> extra-grammatical phenomena, though similar techniques can also be applied in other parsers.

40|$|Definitions of the {{concepts}} of bias and recovery are discussed and approaches <b>to</b> <b>dealing</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> described. The Guide To Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) recommends correction for all significant systematic effects, {{but it is also}} possible to expand measurement uncertainty to take account of uncorrected bias. Run, laboratory and method bias can be defined as components of the bias of a particular measurement result, and can be useful as concepts used in method validation. Estimation of run bias allows a simplification of the estimation of measurement uncertainty. Multivariate calibration brings its own biases that must be quantified and minimised. © 2007 Elsevier B.
