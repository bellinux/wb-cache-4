50|$|In {{contrast}} to frequency, voltage varies widely throughout electric systems, {{because it is}} the voltage difference between two devices that largely determines the direction and magnitude of the current (hence the power) that flows between them. Therefore voltage is a more local phenomenon, and grid-friendly devices that respond to voltage will support more local aspects of the electric delivery system. However, load types such as <b>thermally</b> <b>protected</b> induction motors and power electronics can respond poorly to significant voltage changes. When a sufficient fraction of the power demand in a region is composed of such loads, their collective response can lead to fault-induced delayed voltage recovery behavior, which may have adverse effects on transmission system reliability and may require mitigation to avoid initiating system outages.|$|E

The hoop-shaped requirement, so that vital components could be <b>thermally</b> <b>protected</b> inside the weak-link capacitor, made the Flourinert capacitor design too expensive, complex and impractical.

The model permits to determine the instantaneous evolution of maximum fuel temperatures and the boil-off rate {{as well as the}} possible insulation ablation. To get a realistic estimation of the maximum fuel temperature and boil-off loss, the good knowledge of the internal convection coefficient, taking into account the possible fuel ebullition, is indispensable. The aerothermal flux provokes the insulation degradation and its ablation. Because of the ablation, the reservoir becomes less and less <b>thermally</b> <b>protected,</b> which may cause an important fuel boil-off.

40|$|While the {{successful}} fabrication and {{characterization of the}} inherently two-dimensional graphene has pioneered a host of research into other two-dimensional materials, {{many of the most}} promising implementations of graphene involve sculpting it in three dimensions. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a prominent graphene fabrication method due to the high degree of control over the quality of the resulting graphene. However, almost no research has been done exploring the processes and products of CVD of graphene on three-dimensional nanostructured catalyst, likely because nanostructures are limited from high temperature processes due to their decreased thermal stability. This is a serious void in the current research because the high quality of CVD-derived graphene coupled with the ability to very precisely control the morphology of the template could result in graphene structures with superlative properties and numerous uses. In this work, CVD is used to grow three-dimensional coatings of graphene on slanted columnar thin films (SCTFs), a material that is currently being explored for use as a chemical sensor based on birefringence changes upon adsorption. The chief drawback of SCTF-based sensors is their non-selective response to chemical adsorption, which can be remedied by adding coating of CVD graphene that allows functionalization with analyte specific binders. In order to perform CVD on nanostructures under temperatures at which the morphology of the nanostructures is maintained, acetylene is preferable to the more conventional methane as the hydrocarbon precursor due to its higher reactivity. Furthermore, it is found that graphene grown at lower temperatures can <b>thermally</b> <b>protect</b> the nanostructures from damage at higher temperatures. This enables a high-quality graphene coating to be grown over SCTFs at higher temperatures, which was then characterized optically by Mueller matrix ellipsometry. By growing a layer of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) at the interface of the SCTF and the substrate, the resulting solution-stable CNT-SCTF hybrid was able to be used for in-situ ellipsometry to monitor the functionalization of the SCTFs by pyrene attachment to the graphene coating. This demonstrates both the ability to functionalize the graphene/SCTF hybrid with analyte-specific binders, and the proof-of-concept design of an optical sensor based on graphene-coated SCTFs. ...|$|R

The school principal requested the study after expressing concern that the compound, which had leaked from several fluorescent lamp ballast casings, might contain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). On December 7, 1981, a wipe sample was collected and analyzed. The surface of a luminaire where the ballast had previously burned out contained 3600 micrograms of PCB which was reported as Aroclor- 1242 (53469219). Other samples contained 0. 9 and 0. 6 micrograms of PCB per 100 square centimeters. The ballasts may have inadequate internal thermal protective mechanisms to prevent overheating and ultimate burnout, {{both of which are}} causes of leakage of the thermal dielectric compound. The author concludes that significant quantities of PCBs were released during ballast burnout. The author suggests that thermally unprotected ballasts be replaced with <b>thermally</b> <b>protected</b> units of Class-P classification. On December 4, 1981, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) was requested to determine if the thermal-dielectric compound that had leaked from several fluorescent lamp ballast casings contained polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). On December 7, 1 b 1. bulk solid and wipe samples were obtained to determine the presence of PCBs. A sample of the thermal-dielectric compound obtained from the surface of a luminaire in the cafeteria (where a ballast had previously burned-out) contained 3600 micrograms of PCB (reported as Aroclor 1 4). Samples obtained from the top surfaces of ballasts from the Art Room and Principal 27 s Office contained 0. 9 and 0. 6 micrograms of PCB per 100 square centimeters (reported as Aroclor 1260), respectively. These results indicate that the ballasts tested may have inadequate internal thermal protective mechanisms to prevent overheating and ultimate burnout, both of which are causes of leakage of the thermal-dielectric compound from the fluorescent lamp ballasts.

40|$|A new reactor plant {{concept is}} {{presented}} that combines {{the benefits of}} ceramic-coated, high-temperature particle fuel with those of clean, high-temperature, low-pressure molten salt coolant. The Advanced High-Temperature Reactor (AHTR) concept is a collaboration of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories, and the University of California at Berkeley. The purpose of the concept is to provide an advanced design capable of satisfying the top-level functional requirements of the U. S. Department of Energy Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP), while also providing a technology base that is sufficiently robust to allow future development paths to higher temperatures and larger outputs with highly competitive economics. This report summarizes {{the status of the}} AHTR preconceptual design. It captures the results from an intense effort over a period of 3 months to (1) screen and examine potential feasibility concerns with the concept; (2) refine the conceptual design of major systems; and (3) identify research, development, and technology requirements to fully mature the AHTR design. Several analyses were performed and are presented to quantify the AHTR performance expectations and to assist in the selection of several design parameters. The AHTR, like other NGNP reactor concepts, uses coated particle fuel in a graphite matrix. But unlike the other NGNP concepts, the AHTR uses molten salt rather than helium as the primary system coolant. The considerable previous experience with molten salts in nuclear environments is discussed, and the status of high-temperature materials is reviewed. The large thermal inertia of the system, the excellent heat transfer and fission product retention characteristics of molten salt, and the low-pressure operation of the primary system provide significant safety attributes for the AHTR. Compared with helium coolant, a molten salt cooled reactor will have significantly lower fuel temperatures (150 - 200 -C lower) for the equivalent temperature of heat delivered to either the power conversion system or a hydrogen production plant. Using a comparative cost analysis, the construction costs per unit output are projected to be 50 - 55 % of the costs for modular gas-cooled or sodium-cooled reactor systems. This is primarily a consequence of substantially larger power output and higher conversion efficiency for the AHTR. The AHTR has a number of unique technical challenges in meeting the NGNP requirements; however, it appears to offer advantages over high-temperature helium-cooled reactors and provides an alternative development path to achieve the NGNP requirements. Primary challenges include optimizing the core design for improved response to transients, designing an internal blanket to <b>thermally</b> <b>protect</b> the reactor vessel, and engineering solutions to high-temperature refueling and maintenance...|$|R
40|$|To remain competitive, {{gas turbine}} {{manufacturers}} must aim for continuingly improved engine efficiencies and thrust-to-weight ratio. This {{has resulted in}} the design of gas turbines with increased turbine entry temperature (TET). Thermal barrier coatings (TBCs) are the most promising systems, which <b>thermally</b> <b>protect</b> engine components and allow their use at higher engine gas temperature by potentially reducing metal surface temperature by up to 150 °C. The TBC system consists of a metallic bondcoat and a thermally insulating strain-tolerant ceramic top coat. The bondcoat is a critical part of the system; its failure has a major impact on the lifetime of the TBC. The purpose of this work is the development of a novel and innovative bondcoat with reduced weight, also called "low-mass" bondcoat. This new class of bond coat consisted of a thin (2. 5 to 8 J [...] lm thick) coating containing successive layers (from 9 to 163) of aluminium and platinum. The layers react with one another exothermically by diffusion after a subsequent heat-treatment at a relatively low temperature (700 °C), to form an intermetallic bond coat. In this thesis, the manufacture and optimisation of the low-mass bond coat TBC are presented and discussed. Deposition prerequisites along with good deposition practice were defined in order to produce successfully the low-mass bond coat in a clean environment. Stable working parameters were established, among which a roughness working window, as the substrate initial roughness appears to be a key parameter for coating adherence. The structure of the individual as deposited layers were characterised, which allowed to determine the surface temperature during deposition (between 150 °C and 350 °C). This was well below the temperature above which the exothermic reaction is triggered (400 °C). High-multilayered bondcoats (PtAI, PtAh, Pt 2 Ah stoichiometries) were successfully manufactured, characterised and integrated in a TBC system, among which the thinnest bond coat for THC ever made (51 layers for a 2. 5 J [...] lm thick PtAh). The low-mass bond coat TBC system presented a singular structure consisting of a dense intermetallic layer overlaid by a composite structure of Ah 03 precipitates within a (Ni,Pt) xAly matrix. Furthermore the TGO, thermally grown oxide, formed and grew with a typical equiaxed granular structure. This novel TBC system was tested along with commercial coatings under thermal cyclic oxidation, aiming to simulate the thermal cycles induced by the operating aircraft gas turbine [...] Regarding to the thickness and the aluminium reservoir of the low mass bond coats, the performances are outstanding, confirming the potentiality of this new type of TBC systems. A degradation mechanism was proposed based on FIB and SEM observations along with chemical analysis. The outstanding performance of the low mass bond coat TBC system is thought to be due to the very specific manufacturing process and its influence on the alumina scale growth under the TBC...|$|R

The effective thermal conductivity of the composite is evaluated for a variable thickness of the reinforcement, i. e. for a variable volume fraction.

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) {{is sending}} a large (> 850 kg) rover {{as part of the}} Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) mission to Mars in 2011. The rover's primary power source is a Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG) that generates roughly 2000 W of heat, which is {{converted}} to approximately 110 W of electrical power for use by the rover electronics, science instruments, and mechanism-actuators. The large rover size and extreme thermal environments (cold and hot) for which the rover is designed for led to a sophisticated thermal control system to keep it within allowable temperature limits. The pre-existing Martian atmosphere of low thermal conductivity CO 2 gas (8 Torr) is used to <b>thermally</b> <b>protect</b> the rover and its components from the extremely cold Martian environment (temperatures as low as - 130 deg C). Conventional vacuum based insulation like Multi Layer Insulation (MLI) is not effective in a gaseous atmosphere, so engineered gaps between the warm rover internal components and the cold rover external structure were employed to implement this thermal isolation. Large gaps would lead to more thermal isolation, but would also require more of the precious volume available within the rover. Therefore, a balance of the degree of thermal isolation achieved vs. the volume of rover utilized is required to reach an acceptable design. The temperature differences between the controlled components and the rover structure vary from location to location so each gap has to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis to arrive at an optimal thickness. For every configuration and temperature difference, there is a critical thickness below which the heat transfer mechanism is dominated by simple gaseous thermal conduction. For larger gaps, the mechanism is dominated by natural convection. In general, convection leads to a poorer level of thermal isolation as compared to conduction. All these considerations play important roles in the optimization process. A three-step process was utilized to design this insulation. The first step is {{to come up with a}} simple, textbook based, closed-form equation assessment of gap thickness vs. resultant thermal isolation achieved. The second step is a more sophisticated numerical assessment using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software to investigate the effect of complicated geometries and temperature contours along them to arrive at the effective thermal isolation in a CO 2 atmosphere. The third step is to test samples of representative geometries in a CO 2 filled chamber to measure the thermal isolation achieved. The results of these assessments along with the consistency checks across these methods leads to the formulation of design-guidelines for gap implementation within the rover geometry. Finally, based on the geometric and functional constraints within the real rover system, a detailed design that accommodates all these factors is arrived at. This paper will describe in detail this entire process, the results of these assessments and the final design that was implemented...|$|R
40|$|Cryosurgery is {{a useful}} {{technique}} in the selective destruction of undesirable tissues, such as tumors, within the human body. Cryosurgery's primary benefit is that as a percutaneous method, it reduces the invasiveness and cost associated with traditional surgery. The objective of cryosurgery is to ensure complete destruction of the target tissue while simultaneously minimizing collateral damage to surrounding tissues. In addition {{to the problem of}} collateral damage, the nature of cryosurgery can make it difficult to ascertain the extent of cryoinjury during the surgical procedure. The scope of this work is to provide tools to minimize collateral damage, visualize cryoinjury following cryoinsult, and to better simulate cryosurgical outcomes. A method to counteract the collateral damage of cryosurgery was developed, which employs laser heating to <b>thermally</b> <b>protect</b> tissues surrounding a target tissue (e. g. tumor). A mouse hepatic tissue sample was cryogenically frozen with a cryoprobe {{on one side of the}} tissue, while freezing of the other side was prevented using selective laser heating. Tissue biopsies confirmed that this method can successfully protect regions of tissue from cryogenic damage through gentle laser heating. To visually characterize the regions of tissue damage following cryoinjury, Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) transfected tissues were cryoinjured using a cryoprobe circulating liquid nitrogen. The long-term fluorescent yield of transfected tissues was observed in a controlled environment to determine the tissue's fluorescent response to cryoinjury. Other phenomena that impact fluorescent intensity were controlled and/or observed to eliminate these effects as the source of changing fluorescent intensity. It was observed that following cryoinjury, GFP fluorescence within tissues decays with a trend that follows Fick's second law of diffusion, suggesting that cryoinjury does not directly affect fluorescence, but allows the onset of GFP diffusion through and out of cryoinjured regions. Additional studies designed to account for the movement of all GFP within a closed system support this conclusion. It was determined that GFP-transfected tissues can effectively indicate cryoinjury, provided that conditions are favorable to diffusion. Emerging techniques that combine cryosurgery with laser heating need accurate methods to simulate the thermal response of a cryogenic tissue to optical irradiation. Light transport in tissue has been studied in great depth, and various computer programs and models currently exist that simulate light transport in simple systems. Light transport in tissues that undergo large changes in temperature, such as those encountered with laser-irradiated cryogenic tissues, cannot be accurately modeled with traditional methods, as those methods rely on simple geometries and optical properties which are constant with respect to temperature. A computer program and the supporting algorithms was developed which allows for the simulation of light transport in arbitrarily-shaped tissues which have temperature-dependent thermal and optical properties. The program first determines the optical distribution/deposition within the tissue, using a Monte Carlo photon heating simulation. The volumetric heating data is then used in determining heat transfer within the system. Optical properties based on the new thermal profile are interpolated and the optical distribution is repeated using these updated optical properties. This process repeats itself as necessary for the duration of the simulation. The simulation results compare favorably to established laser-tissue simulations, and to fundamental laws, validating the accuracy of the simulation outputs. The simulation can accurately predict the thermal response of a geometrically-complicated system to optical irradiation, including systems that undergo large changes in temperature and thus large changes in optical and thermal properties...|$|R

This makes the TJA 1050 eminently suitable for use in nodes that are in a power-down situation in partially powered networks...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTemperatures in {{the high}} {{pressure}} chamber of aircraft engines are continuously increasing to improve the engine efﬁciency. As a result, constitutive materials such as cobalt and nickel-base superalloys need to be <b>thermally</b> <b>protected.</b> The ﬁrst protection is a ceramic thermal barrier coating (TBC) cast on all the hot gas-exposed structure. The second protection is provided by a cool air layer realized {{by the use of}} a thousand of drills on the parts where a cool air is ﬂowing through. The laser drilling process is used to realize these holes at acute angles. It has been shown on coated single crystal nickel-base superalloy that the laser drilling process causes an interfacial cracking (also called delamination), detected by a cross section observation. The present work aims at characterizing interfacial cracking induced by laser drilling on coated cobalt-base super alloy. On the one hand, this work attempted to quantify the crack by several microscopic observations with regards to the most signiﬁcant process parameters related as the angle beam. On the other hand, we studied the difference of the laser/ceramic and the laser/substrate interaction with real time observation by using a fast movie camera...|$|E
40|$|Small {{heat shock}} protein (sHsp) {{responses}} were studied for two evergreen perennial shrubs in the northern California chaparral; one common on warm, south-facing slopes (Ceanothus cuneatus), {{and the other on}} cooler, north-facing slopes (Prunus ilicifolia). Small Hsp expression was induced experimentally for field collected leaves. Leaf collections were made where the species co-occur. Small Hsp expression was quantified using two antibodies, one specific to a chloroplast 22 [*]kD sHsp and another that detects a broad range of sHsps. Differences between chloroplast sHsp accumulation, which <b>protects</b> <b>thermally</b> labile proteins in PSII, and the general sHsp response were examined. The species from the cooler microclimate, Prunus, had a lower induction temperature and accumulated greater levels of sHsps at low temperatures. Both Prunus and Ceanothus reached peak sHsp expression at 42 ∘C. The species from the warmer microclimate, Ceanothus, had greater sHsp expression at higher temperatures. Chloroplast sHsp expression generally tracked sHsp expression in Ceanothus, but in Prunus general Hsps were elevated before chloroplast sHsps. Variation between species for sHsp expression (induction temperatures, accumulation levels, and the duration of expression) coupled with the costs of Hsp synthesis, may contribute to differences in the abundance and distribution of plants across environmental gradients...|$|R
40|$|Lake-level {{variations}} at Marcella Lake, a small, hydrologically closed lake in {{the southwestern}} Yukon Territory, document changes in effective moisture since the early Holocene. Former water levels, driven by regional palaeohydrology, were reconstructed by multiproxy analyses of sediment cores from four sites spanning shallow to deep water. Marcella Lake today is <b>thermally</b> stratified, being <b>protected</b> from wind by its position in a depression. It is alkaline and undergoes bio-induced calcification. Relative accumulations of calcium carbonate and organic matter at the sediment/water interface depend on {{the location of the}} depositional site relative to the thermocline. We relate lake-level fluctuations to down-core stratigraphic variations in composition, geochemistry, sedimentary structures and to the occurrence of unconformities in four cores based on observations of modern limnology and sedimentation processes. Twenty-four AMS radiocarbon dates on macrofossils and pollen provide the lake-level chronology. Prior to 10 000 cal. BP water levels were low, but then they rose to 3 to 4 m below modern levels. Between 7500 and 5000 cal. BP water levels were 5 to 6 m below modern but rose by 4000 cal. BP. Between 4000 and 2000 cal. BP they were higher than modern. During the last 2000 years, water levels were either near or 1 to 2 m below modern levels. Marcella Lake water-level fluctuations correspond with previously documented palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic changes and provide new, independent effective moisture information. The improved geochronology and quantitative water-level estimates are a framework for more detailed studies in the southwest Yukon...|$|R
40|$|Gold {{nanoparticles}} (Au NPs) {{have attracted}} substantial attention {{in recent years}} owing to their small size and quantum properties leading {{to a wide range}} of potential applications as molecular devices and catalysts compared to their macromolecular counterparts. Since the physical and chemical properties of Au NPs are known to be dramatically affected by their size, shape and spatial arrangement, the potential of the concept to produce new Au NPs tailored to possess desired properties was investigated through careful selection of the passivating ligands. The aim of this thesis with respect to gold nanoparticles is two fold. First, multidentate thioether based ligands were designed based on structural considerations, and synthesized. Then, the interactions of these novel well-defined ligands with Au 55 nanoparticles were investigated. Ligand exchange attemps to replace phosphine ligands with more stable benzothioether ligands could not be achieved. In fact, coagulation of Au 55 nanoparticles into bigger particles or even into bulk gold was observed. Alternatively, the potential of multidentate macrocyclic ligands as stabilizing and size steering additives during the direct synthesis of new gold clusters with the Brust-Schiffrin method was investigated. Significantly, a very narrow size distribution with mainly 1. 1 nm gold nanoparticles was obtained as demonstrated by TEM analysis. Calculations utilizing the characterization data showed that two of our bulky ligands stabilized one gold nanoparticle composed of 34 gold atoms. It was also observed that the newly formed gold nanoparticles are additionally stabilized with the help of the ionic phase transfer reagent and showed very high stability in solution or solid phase. In the second part of this study, the potential of tert-butoxycarbonyl (BOC) protected arylamine structures as supramolecularly organized building blocks which might be subsequently interlinked via reactive intermediates accessed by deprotection chemistry was investigated. Besides common usage as a protection group, Boc groups can also play an important role in the self assembly of molecules by forming intermolecular hydrogen bonds due to the H-bond donor and acceptor capability. Being <b>thermally</b> cleavable, Boc <b>protected</b> molecules are not only ideal candidates to arrange ordered structures but also to release active species at well defined positions as building blocks of a network consisting of interlinked deprotected molecules. Several Boc protected aromatic structures were synthesized and their ability to form ordered structures on surfaces using the concepts of supramolecular chemistry and the formation of new N-N and N-C covalent bonds were investigated...|$|R

40|$|Megacopta cribraria, kudzu bug, is an {{invasive}} pest of soybeans in the Southeast United States, with {{a northern}} distribution limit in Maryland. Soybeans, however, are grown north of Maryland, which places producers {{at risk of}} future range shifts. Additionally, producers in the current distribution need a development model to aid management. To address both concerns, I studied the cold tolerance of the kudzu bug and its phenology. I examined the supercooling point (SCP) and lethal temperature to kill 50 % (LLT 50) of three populations over the fall of 2015 to determine the cold tolerance. I found the kudzu bug is a freeze avoidant species with an average SCP of - 12. 6 °C and LLT 50 of - 5. 1 °C. I also determined that the kudzu bug moves to <b>thermally</b> <b>protected</b> leaf litter in late November to overwinter. To address phenology, I determined the kudzu bug requires 625 degree-days at a minimum temperature of 16 °C to complete egg and nymphal development. Field validation fit the model well with a biofix of May 1 st and 30 days for a preoviposition period. The phenological degree-day model indicates two generations per year and allows producers evaluate and time pest management strategies within a year.

40|$|The SRB {{attach ring}} is <b>thermally</b> <b>protected</b> with layered {{phenolic}} cloth fairings that are {{fastened to the}} ring. The gap between the fairings and the motor case is closed off with a rubber seal of a fishtail cross sectional shape bonded to the phenolic. On both the STS- 1 and STS- 2 flights this gap was discovered to vary anywhere from an intended gap of 0. 375 in. to an actual measured gap of 0. 60 in. due to tolerances. Tests were conducted with and without a 0. 25 in. thick cork shim placed under the seal with a 0. 60 in. gap under the phenolic TPS to determine and compare {{the performance of the}} seal in the two different configurations. To alleviate the difficult and costly procedure of installing the cork shim under the seal, especially after phenolic TPS mounting on the attach ring, large fishtail seals of idential Elder gray silicon material and two different hardnesses were tested. A similar matrix of tests was conducted with this new large fishtail seal, and seals with both type hardnesses performed well {{regardless of whether or not}} the seal was bonded in the phenolic at the front of the seal groove.

40|$|Department of Electrical EngineeringIn this thesis, the design, implementation, and {{measurement}} of a CAN transceiver {{are presented as}} a part of an architecture of Multi-domain Electronic Control Unit (MECU) and Smart Output ASIC for better mileage, wire length reduction and flexible system configuration. The proposed Smart Output ASIC is a dedicated terminal system for actuation feature. The main component includes MCU core, four types of actuator drivers, CAN/LIN transceiver, temperature sensor, and BGR/LDO regulator. The Smart Output ASIC communicates with a central ECU by using CAN or LIN protocols. Therefore, the first step for the Smart Output ASIC is to implement the CAN transceiver meeting ISO 11898 - 2 /- 5. In this work, two types of CAN transceiver were implementedone is a stand-alone version CAN transceiver (Type I), and another is an MCU integrated version (Type II). Both support high-speed CAN which has the maximum data rate of 1 Mbps. They are <b>thermally</b> <b>protected,</b> and robust against high voltage hazard. An 8 -bit MCU is used for Type II. Type II is the first prototype of Smart Output ASIC, and it would be extended to the complete Smart Output ASIC by embedding the actuator drivers. The designed CAN transceivers were fabricated by using automotive 0. 181 ̆d 4621 ̆d 45 a, 52 V BCDMOS technology. The chip size of the Type I is 1, 2751 ̆d 4621 ̆d 45 a (W) × 1, 1251 ̆d 4621 ̆d 45 a (H) except I/O pads. Also, Type II was implemented with the size of 2, 6801 ̆d 4621 ̆d 45 a (W) × 3, 2801 ̆d 4621 ̆d 45 a (H) except I/O pads.

40|$|The {{incineration}} process on the moving grate {{can be divided}} into four different stages, drying, devolatilization, gasification/combustion and final char burn-out. These stages are influenced mainly by the primary air flow and are affected to a smaller extent by secondary air flow, temperature conditions within and above the grate, composition of waste (particularly humidity) and movements of grate elements which enable waste movement along the grate and mixing. The composition of flue gases depends on both the composition of the waste and {{on a wide range of}} process conditions; a detailed knowledge of the flue gas is essential in defining the design of the {{incineration process}}. The incinerator design can particularly differ in the grate type, the geometrical configuration of a combustion chamber and the process control system. While all existing commercial waste incinerators have been designed on the basis of empirical models developed from a wide range of available information, there is a large potential to improve plant design and operation. One of the key areas is detailed in-situ measurements of combustion conditions in the region of the grate where the first flue gases are produced. Until recently, flue gas monitoring in this zone has received little attention due in large part to technical difficulties. In order to achieve applicable data and information on flue gas composition directly from the combustion chamber close to the grate a novel measuring instrument is used. The specially designed sensor instrument is a <b>thermally</b> <b>protected</b> unit for temperature and flue gas concentration measurements. This work describes the design and application of the sensor instrument use in large-scale waste incinerators. The data collected is used in waste incineration process modelling or as an indicator to prove the suitability of a specific incineration process. JRC. F. 2 -Cleaner energie...|$|E
