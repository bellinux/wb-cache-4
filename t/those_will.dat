The {{total number of}} languages {{in the world is}} not known. Estimates vary depending on many factors. The consensus is that there are between 6,000 and 7,000 languages spoken as of 2010, and that between 50–90% of <b>those</b> <b>will</b> have become extinct by the year 2100. The top 20 languages, those spoken by more than 50 million speakers each, are spoken by 50% of the world's population, whereas many of the other languages are spoken by small communities, most of them with less than 10,000 speakers.|$|E

25|$|Due to lack {{of skills}} and {{education}} as well as competitive job markets, many slum dwellers face high rates of unemployment. The limit of job opportunities causes many of them to employ themselves in the informal economy, inside the slum or in developed urban areas near the slum.

25|$|Lomborg concludes {{his book}} by once again {{reviewing}} the Litany, and {{noting that the}} real {{state of the world}} is much better than the Litany claims. According to Lomborg, this discrepancy poses a problem, as it focuses public attention on relatively unimportant issues, while ignoring those that are paramount. In the worst case, The Skeptical Environmentalist argues, the global community is pressured to adopt inappropriate policies which have adverse effects on humanity, wasting resources that could be put to better use in aiding poor countries or fighting diseases such as AIDS. Lomborg thus urges us to look at what he calls the true problems of the world, since solving <b>those</b> <b>will</b> also solve the Litany.|$|E
25|$|A science {{documentary}} by EBS {{has revealed}} that Chang Bogo-class submarines undergo major generational overhaul and refit every eight to twelve years. The overhaul and refit involves periodic cutting, complete disassembly, and rewelding of the hull for the upgrade or total replacement of the submarine's old engines, navigational equipment, batteries, and other essential equipment with their modern counterparts. Hull stretch may also {{have taken place in}} some of the Chang Bogo-class vessels since the early 2000s, but it has neither been completely confirmed nor denied. Some Chang Bogo-class vessels are demonstrated to have sub-Harpoon launching capability when previously the class was lacking it. ROKN is committed to build and maintain a submarine force of 26 attack submarines until 2025, excluding small and midget submarines, though {{it is not clear how}} many submarines among <b>those</b> <b>will</b> belong to the Chang Bogo class. The oldest commissioned Chang Bogo class submarine by then will be 32 years old.|$|E

2500|$|As well as {{decaying}} via stimulated emission, {{electrons in}} the upper energy level can also decay by spontaneous emission, which occurs at random, depending upon the glass structure and inversion level. [...] Photons are emitted spontaneously in all directions, but a proportion of <b>those</b> <b>will</b> be emitted {{in a direction that}} falls within the numerical aperture of the fiber and are thus captured and guided by the fiber. [...] Those photons captured may then interact with other dopant ions, and are thus amplified by stimulated emission. [...] The initial spontaneous emission is therefore amplified {{in the same manner as}} the signals, hence the term Amplified Spontaneous Emission. [...] ASE is emitted by the amplifier in both the forward and reverse directions, but only the forward ASE is a direct concern to system performance since that noise will co-propagate with the signal to the receiver where it degrades system performance. [...] Counter-propagating ASE can, however, lead to degradation of the amplifier's performance since the ASE can deplete the inversion level and thereby reduce the gain of the amplifier.|$|E

2500|$|Compound given names, such as Jean-Luc, Jean-Paul, or Anne-Sophie are not uncommon. These are not {{considered}} to be two separate given names. The second part of a compound name may be a given name normally used by the opposite sex. However, the gender of the compound is determined by the first component. Thus, Marie-George Buffet has a given name considered as female because it begins with Marie, and George is spelled with a final -e like all the traditional French female given names, instead of Georges with -es for a male. The feminine component in male compound names is mostly Marie, as in Jean-Marie Vianney. In the past, some Frenchmen would have Marie or Anne as first name (example: Anne du Bourg), which is still nowadays in [...] practice in rare traditional Catholic families (but then the man will have other given names and one of <b>those</b> <b>will</b> be used in everyday life). Second or third given names, which usually are kept private, may also include names normally used by the opposite gender. For instance, in 2006, 81 Frenchmen have Brigitte among their given names, 97 Catherine, 133 Anne, and 204 Julie. In addition to the above-described custom of using Marie for males, {{this is due to the}} habit of traditional Catholic French families to give children the names of their godmother and godfather: if there is no counterpart of the opposite gender for the name of the godparent who is not of the same sex as the child, generally the name of the godparent will be left as such. For instance, a male child born to a traditional Catholic family choosing for him the name Nicolas and whose godparents are called Christian and Véronique could be called Nicolas Christian Marie Véronique.|$|E
