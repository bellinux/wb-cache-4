60|$|The Mohegan chief {{heard this}} {{sentence}} with deep attention. When {{he found he}} was to be denied the satisfaction of proving, or perhaps of overcoming, the resolution of his enemy, a deep cloud passed across his swarthy visage. But the strength of his tribe had long been broken, and to resist would have been as unprofitable as to repine would have been unseemly. The conditions were therefore accepted, and preparations were accordingly made among the Indians <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> <b>to</b> <b>judgment.</b>|$|E
60|$|In the Court of the High Steward, {{he alone}} is judge in all points {{of law and}} practice; the peers triers are merely judges of fact, and are summoned by virtue of a precept from the High Steward to appear before him on the day {{appointed}} by him for the trial, ut rei veritas melius sciri poterit. The High Steward's commission, after reciting that an indictment hath been found against the peer by the grand jury of the proper county, impowereth him to send for the indictment, to convene the prisoner before him at such day and place as he shall appoint, then and there {{to hear and determine}} the matter of such indictment; to cause the peers triers, tot et tales, per quos rei veritas melius sciri poterit, at the same day and place to appear before him; veritateque inde compert√¢, <b>to</b> <b>proceed</b> <b>to</b> <b>judgment</b> according to the law and custom of England, and thereupon to award execution.[82] By this it is plain that the sole right of judicature is in cases of this kind vested in the High Steward; that it resideth solely in his person; and consequently, without this commission, which is but in nature of a commission of Oyer and Terminer, no one step can be taken in order to a trial; and that when his commission is dissolved, which he declareth by breaking his staff, the court no longer existeth.|$|E
