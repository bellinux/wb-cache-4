The attacks were widely perceived by Christians in southern Karnataka to be punishment from right-wing Hindu nationalist organisations because they had been outspoken about Christian persecution in Orissa, after the assassination of Hindu monk Swami Lakshmanananda Saraswati allegedly by local christian community and also because <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Life</b> Fellowship Trust (NLFT), a non-denominational Christian Church, was alleged by Bajrang Dal to be responsible for forced conversions of Hindus to Christianity.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the tornado {{outbreak}} law enforcement officers, including 30 national guard troops, were sent to Lone Grove to provide security. The American Red Cross opened shelters in Ardmore, Edmond, and Oklahoma City. About 100 volunteers from the Sorghum Mill Estates Neighborhood Association traveled to affected areas in Edmond to help with cleanup efforts. A local restaurant provided free meals to the volunteers as they assisted relief workers. The Salvation Army had two canteens in Oklahoma City, one in Lone Grove, and one in Perkins. About 2,000 meals, drinks, and snacks were provided by the Salvation Army to emergency responders. Feed the Children sent two truckloads of relief supplies to Carter County. They also sent three food trucks, containing a total of 619 meals, 900 drinks, and about 500 snacks, to Ardmore. On February22, <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Life</b> Baptist Church sent drinks and prepackaged snacks, along with items needed for clean-up. Baptist Disaster Relief assisted in Lone Grove with food and emotional care. The Oklahoma City Thunder of the National Basketball Association (NBA) gave away two tickets to anyone who made a donation of $25 or an equivalent amount of food to benefit victims of the tornado. A concert featuring Chris Cagle and other local musicians at Heritage Hall in Ardmore raised over $18,000 to benefit Carter County tornado victims. Another concert set up by the Salvation Army raised $2,300 more for victims.|$|E
5|$|The September 2008 attacks had {{political}} significance, {{given that}} the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Karnataka state government, led by B. S. Yeddyurappa, were also accused of involvement and backing the anti-Christian campaigns and {{that the police were}} reported to have had knowledge of the imminent attacks but failed to prevent them. The police were criticised for their reaction to the protests and a report by a committee of human rights activists set up in the aftermath to examine the causes of the attacks claimed that they had used the event as a pretext to assault the community, rather than defend it. Justice B. K. Somasekhara of Karnataka, however, concluded that the police and government helped maintain order and were not responsible for the attacks. In response to the alleged forcible conversions of involvement, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) gave a three-month deadline for New Life Fellowship Trust (NLFT) to stop all conversion activities in Mangalore. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Mangalore declared that it would distance itself from <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Life</b> Fellowship Trust.|$|E

5|$|When the CCP {{entered the}} First United Front to fight warlords and unite China from 1924–27 with the Guomindang (GMD), the each party {{established}} their own women’s department during this time. However, the United Front {{ended with the}} White Terror (1927), where the GMD launched an attack to purge the communists and laborers. The ideas about liberating Chinese women from Confucian values were only permitted within the territory under CCP rule. These territories were called soviets, and were the places the CCP fled to following the White Terror {{because they were not}} {{under the control of the}} GMD. The GMD championed traditional Confucian ideals about women, and they established <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Life</b> Movement, which sought to counter the gender role espoused by the CCP with traditional Confucian gender roles supported by the GMD. The CCP's time in the soviets from 1927–1945 also gave them the opportunity to develop the skills for organizing federations and governing, which greatly facilitated the founding of the ACWF later.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{communities}} in Crawley {{that do not}} worship at a building used solely for religious purposes. The non-denominational Crawley Family Church uses Waterfield Primary School, which opened in 1985 in Bewbush. Also in Bewbush, an Elim Pentecostal congregation meets weekly at Bewbush Community Primary School; regular prayer meetings, study groups and other social activities take place elsewhere in the neighbourhood. The congregation was established in May 2005. This church {{is associated with the}} Elim church in Langley Green. The Crawley Gatwick Church of Christ, an independent, non-denominational congregation formed in 1996, meets at the community centre in Gossops Green. The Salvation Army established a barracks in 1902 in West Green, but the Crawley branch is now based in Ifield: worship takes place at the neighbourhood's community centre. The Kingdom Faith church, affiliated with a group of churches based in nearby Horsham, meets at Oriel High School in the Maidenbower neighbourhood and at Roffey Place, just over the borough boundary at Faygate. In 2006, a Pentecostalist community founded the Exodus Pentecostal Church, which worships at Tree House—Crawley's ancient manor house, now owned by the Borough Council. The weekly services cater especially for residents from Diego Garcia and Mauritius. Also in the town centre, the Potter's House Church uses the church hall of St John the Baptist's Church. It is part of the London Fellowship of Potter's House Christian Fellowship churches. The Solution Chapel International, a non-denominational church founded in January 2009 by Pastor Adama Segbedji with just 2 adults and 1 child has grown to become the largest non denominational, multi cultural church, is based at Northgate Community Centre. The Vine Christian Fellowship meets in a hotel in Southgate and holds joint services in <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Life</b> and Green Fields Baptist churches. The Powerhouse Revival Centre meets for worship at the community centre on Ifield Drive in the Ifield neighbourhood.|$|E
