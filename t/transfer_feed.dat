40|$|Utah is {{historically}} an agricultural state with many resources adapted to livestock production. The beef and dairy industries in Utah account for 40 and 15 percent respectively {{of the total}} receipts received from agricultural marketings (7).

Nevertheless, poultry production represents {{a significant portion of}} the total agricultural receipts. Production of livestock and poultry have expanded beyond the state 2 ̆ 7 s capacity to produce concentrate feed to benefit from economy of scale and to increase farm size through intensification. This feed deficit in Utah must be supplied from sources outside the state. It is estimated that Utah is dependent upon out-of-state sources for approximately 60 percent of the concentrate feed used. With a limited quantity of concentrate feed, livestock and poultry industries can be increased only by increasing the amount of feed procured from other areas.

40|$|Carbon (C) and {{phosphorous}} (P) {{regulation in}} aquatic food chains are transferred from lower to upper trophic levels primarily as polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and C:P stoichiometry. The majority of C is transferred through algal based pathway. Microbial loop, though optionally contributes to C transfer, highly constrained by P limitation and bacterial predator type. Lack of essential PUFAs in bacteria is {{also responsible for}} its low trophic transfer of C. The seston size and algal taxonomic variations directly affect herbivore through P-dependent food quality and de novo synthesis of PUFAs. Change in algal community over a gradient could therefore determine C <b>transfer.</b> <b>Feeding</b> nature (herbivorous or carnivorous) and predator sizes also regulate transfer efficiency of C and P to upper trophic levels. As trophic levels move up, P-limitation becomes higher compared to autotrophs. For Daphnia, as mostly studied aquatic herbivore member, P limitation becomes critical at C:P > 300 indicating excess C is not always invited under P-deficient situations.

40|$|Abstract Background During {{bioprocess}} development, secondary screening {{is a key}} step at {{the boundary}} between laboratory and industrial conditions. To ensure an effective high-throughput screening, miniaturized laboratory conditions must mimic industrial conditions, especially for oxygen <b>transfer,</b> <b>feeding</b> capacity and pH stabilization. Results A feeding strategy {{has been applied to}} develop a simple screening procedure, in which a stoichiometric study is combined with a standard miniaturization procedure. Actually, the knowledge of all nutriments and base or acid requirements leads to a great simplification of pH stabilization issue of miniaturized fed-batch cultures. Applied to cellulase production by Trichoderma reesei, this strategy resulted in a stoichiometric mixed feed of carbon and nitrogen sources. While keeping the pH between shake flask and stirred bioreactor comparable, the developed shake flask protocol reproduced the strain behaviour under stirred bioreactor conditions. Compared to a an already existing miniaturized shake flasks protocol, the cellulase concentration was increased 5 -fold, reaching about 10 g L - 1. Applied to the secondary screening of several clones, the newly developed protocol succeeded in selecting a clone with a high industrial potential. Conclusions The understanding of a bioprocess stoichiometry contributed to define a simpler and more effective miniaturization. The suggested strategy can potentially be applied to other fed-batch processes, for the screening of either strain collections or experimental conditions. </p...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{studies on}} feed utilization in two Indonesian villages (Putukrejo and Kedungsalam) with large seasonal variation in availability of feeds. The model used calculates {{the effect of}} varying degrees of feed selection {{on the number of}} animals that can be fed ad libitum, the corresponding mean liveweight gain (MLWG) per animal and total liveweight production (TLWP) of the herd. Calculations assume that, if only part of the feed is used, the feeds giving the highest intake of metabolizable energy are selected first. When feeds were pooled for the whole year, 2976 AU (animal units) could be fed ad libitum in Putukrejo and 4443 in Kedungsalam, but maximum TLWP was obtained with a smaller herd size (HS; 2300 and 3800 AU, respectively), not using the poorest <b>feeds.</b> Without <b>transfer</b> of <b>feeds</b> from one month to another, the maximum number of AU that could be fed ad libitum each month varied from 583 to 4130 AU in Putukrejo and from 1446 to 11080 in Kedungsalam.

With assumptions most closely reflecting farmers' practices, optimal HS was 1200 AU for Putukrejo and between 1900 and 3200 for Kedungsalam, with MLWGs of 199 and 131 - 159 g AU(- 1) d(- 1), respectively.

40|$|A {{balanced}} diet for bovines: strategies {{to improve the}} efficiency of nitrogen use. The main aim {{of this paper was}} to present some feeding recommendations, which, when applied on the farm, would increase nitrogen use by bovines and to give information as to how the effects of the nitrogen produced can be reduced. Ruminants have the ability to digest structural carbohydrates and to produce meat and milk proteins for human consumption. At the animal cells level, amino acids are essential for biological functions, mainly involving their maintenance and production. These amino acids are supplied by the intestinal digestion of microbial protein and feed protein that escapes microbial degradation in the rumen. Today, the efficiency of nitrogen utilization is typically low and highly variable in ruminants. Nitrogen excretion by ruminants mainly depends on the level of nitrogen intake and of the animal's productivity. Optimal N utilization may be achieved through an understanding of the key mechanisms involved in the control of N digestion and metabolism. These include the efficiency of N capture in the rumen and the protein degradation according to the type of diet and forage, the control of the rumen microorganisms involved in protein degradation and the proper formulation of the diet, avoiding feeding excess protein in relation to requirements. The dependence on energy supply in <b>transferring</b> <b>feed</b> nitrogen into milk and meat protein is strong both at the rumen and the cell levels of ruminants. The rumen metabolism is identified as the single most important factor contributing to the low level of efficient use of nitrogen in ruminants and partially depends on practical farming operations...|$|R

Living environment was devided into three areas according to the geographical areas (Hokkaido-Tohoku-Hokuriku-Sanin, Kanto-Tokai-Kinki, and Sanyo-Shikoku-Kyushu), two community types according to an urban or an agricultural or fishing village, and four community sizes according to number of the population. Factors considered to contribute to a high level of ADL were evaluated. The results can be summarized as follows. 1. According to the geographical area, the independence rate (percentage of individuals who were competent for ADL) was significantly higher in Sanyo-Shikoku-Kyushu area than in Kanto-Tokai-Kinki area in all items examined (<b>transferring,</b> <b>feeding,</b> continence and bathing). Regional differences were observed in the state of living, state of medical care, social and cultural activities, and dietary habit since the age of 80 years, watching TV and an interest in health as social and cultural activites were related to high independence rates in areas such as Sanyo. 2. According to the community type, the state of medical care, whether there was a family doctor, social and cultural activities, and dietary habit since tha age of 80 years in agricultural and fishing communities appeared to be favorable for independence rate, but there were not observed significant relations. 3. According to the community size, none of the residents in large cities were independent in eating, continence, or bathing. The independence rate of continence was significantly lower than that in small cities and towns or villages in rural districts, suggesting that large cities are an environment unfavorable for socially independent longevity.
