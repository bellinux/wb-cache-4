5|$|After the Congress of Vienna, a small Kingdom of Poland, {{known as}} Congress Poland, was recreated, with its king being the Tsar of Russia, Alexander I. Alexander I, an enlightened autocrat, {{decided to use}} Congress Poland as an {{experiment}} to see if Russian autocratic rule could be mixed with an elective legislative system, and rule Poland as a constitutional monarchy. At that time many hoped that this experiment would be a success and pave way to a liberalization in Russia; in <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>it</b> {{proved to be a}} failure.|$|E
5|$|As Thrilling Wonder the {{magazine}} was much less influential. Until the mid-1940s it was focused on younger readers, {{and by the time}} Merwin and Mines introduced a more adult approach, Astounding Science Fiction had taken over as the unquestioned leader of the field. Thrilling Wonder could not compete with John Campbell and the Golden Age of science fiction that he brought into being, but it did periodically publish good stories. In <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>it</b> was unable to escape its roots in the pulp industry, and died in the carnage that swept away every remaining pulp magazine in the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{decision}} to disband the Ranger units, the 2nd Ranger Company was deactivated on 1 August 1951 while it was still in Korea. Like many of the other Ranger units, most of the 2nd Ranger Company veterans were folded into the 187th RCT. As an airborne unit, it was believed that by sending the men to the 187th, their airborne skills could be used. Nevertheless, in <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>it</b> turned out that Operation Tomahawk was the last airborne jump of the war and as a result, the former Rangers did not get a chance to exercise these skills again.|$|E
5|$|Finally, {{to end the}} impasse, Shackleton agreed, in {{a letter}} to Scott dated 17 May 1907, to work to the east of the 170°W {{meridian}} and therefore to avoid all the familiar Discovery ground. In <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>it</b> was a promise that he was unable to keep after his search for alternative landing grounds proved fruitless. With his only other option being to return home, he set up his headquarters at Cape Royds, close to the old Discovery base. For this he was roundly condemned by the British polar establishment at the time.|$|E
5|$|Ip Man is {{the first}} film in a trilogy. Donnie Yen reprised the lead role in the sequel Ip Man 2, the second feature film based {{on the life of}} Ip Man.

5|$|The {{colocation}} of the Angels and Apostles {{as well as}} the affinity {{between them}} suggest that both Tamagnino and Cairano obtained early ownership of the internal works at the Santa Maria dei Miracoli, though at <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>it</b> devolved to Cairano. Technically, however, the Angels of Tamagnino are far superior to the Apostles. In addition to the Angels, Tamagnino also delivered four busts for the pendentive of the first dome of the church, titled Dottori della Chiesa, and two smaller roundels for the frieze of the nave. But for these constructions, three of which were monumental, and the Angels, the sculptor received a smaller compensation than Cairano did for his Apostles.|$|E

5|$|Aesthetically, {{the game}} used Fire Emblem {{elements}} as motifs, but took its setting and premise of {{a clash between}} worlds from Shin Megami Tensei. The battle system was originally going {{to be similar to}} a Fire Emblem game, but while it did incorporate elements such as the Weapon Triangle, it ultimately became a turn-based RPG battle system. After Atlus was made primary developer, the story was set in modern-day Tokyo and written around a group of young people facing challenges together. Its upbeat focus on character drama was a deliberate shift away from the dark scenarios of the Megami Tensei series. The game takes place in multiple locations around Tokyo, including Shibuya and Harajuku. The modern setting provided challenges for incorporating Fire Emblem characters, as characters in medieval armor just dropping into a modern setting would have looked strange. Among the considered possibilities were introducing Fire Emblem characters as human party members. In <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>it</b> was decided to make them summoned helpers similar to the demons of Shin Megami Tensei, drawn into the real world from their Idolosphere dimension.|$|E

Interchanges are planned at {{junctions}} with Reid Highway, Hepburn Avenue and Beechboro Road North, Gnangara Road, The Promenade, Stock Road, Neaves road and Brand Highway and Great Northern Highway. The 3rd stage was originally planned to be a 2 lane single-carriageway road with at-grade intersections, with provision for upgrading in the future, but in <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>it</b> was decided that the ultimate plan with a 4 lane dual-carriageway was to go ahead. The previously planned route of the PDNH, prior to 2012, followed Lord Street, east of Whiteman Park. Construction is due to be completed mid 2019.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{initial safety}} concerns, DC-10 {{aircraft}} continued {{to serve with}} passenger airlines for over 30 years after the crash of Flight 191. In <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>it</b> was newer, more fuel-efficient twin-engined airplanes from Boeing and Airbus and not safety concerns that ultimately ended the passenger career of the DC-10. Many retired passenger DC-10s have since been converted to all-cargo use. DC-10 freighters, along with its derivative, the MD-11, form {{the backbone of the}} FedEx Express fleet. The DC-10s have been upgraded with the glass cockpit from the MD-11, thereby turning them into MD-10s. American Airlines retired its last DC-10s in 2000 after 29 years of service. In February 2014, Biman Bangladesh Airlines operated the final DC-10 passenger flights. DC-10s continue to be used extensively in air freight operations, and military variants also remain in service.|$|E

Heading to Eden Tower to decrypt the core's transmission, she agrees to meet Kai there. Once reunited, they are ambushed by Victor. Kai stays behind to provide Joule the time to escape. She finds a lost crawler filled with parietal art indicating that Victor had manipulated the other corebots to attack the maintenance habitats. Corebot Duncan enters, lamenting the death of his human companion, and unites with Joule against Victor. Joule approaches Eden Tower to activate it, only to be faced with Victor and his minions. She learns that the ships, once orbiting Far Eden while waiting for its terraforming to complete, are long gone, having been destroyed by Victor. He throws Kai's prosthetic leg to the ground, proclaiming him dead. Finally, Joule bests Victor in combat and activates the terraforming system, materializing a hologram of her father from parts of memories hidden in the cores. In <b>the</b> <b>end,</b> <b>it</b> becomes clear that Kai survived his confrontation with Victor.|$|E

Quarterback Brent Meyer was the all-time leader in passing yards and total offense at ISU. He finished the season with the Cyclone record for career touchdowns as well. Meyer was complemented by wide receiver Todd Blythe who led the nation in career yards per catch (19.0) and was fifth on the career touchdown receptions list (25) before the game. ISU linebacker Alvin Bowen also led the nation in tackles per game this season and had 17against Nebraska.

5|$|Meanwhile, Springfield Elementary {{put on a}} {{production}} of Casablanca, in which Lisa gets the lead role of Ilsa.

5|$|Nobody {{has ever}} cut {{anything}} from Andrei Rublev. Nobody except me. I made some cuts myself. In {{the first version}} the film was 3 hours 20 minutes long. In the second — 3 hours 15 minutes. I shortened the final version to 3 hours 6 minutes. I am convinced the latest version is the best, the most successful. And I only cut certain overly long scenes. The viewer doesn't even notice their absence. The cuts have in no way changed neither the subject matter nor what was for us important in the film. In other words, we removed overly long scenes which had no significance. We shortened certain scenes of brutality in order to induce psychological shock in viewers, {{as opposed to a}} mere unpleasant impression which would only destroy our intent. All my friends and colleagues who during long discussions were advising me to make those cuts turned out right in <b>the</b> <b>end.</b> <b>It</b> took me some time to understand it. At first I got the impression they were attempting to pressure my creative individuality. Later I understood that this final version of the film more than fulfils my requirements for it. And I do not regret at all that the film has been shortened to its present length.|$|E

5|$|The United States Geological Survey (USGS) {{estimates}} that the annual worldwide production of thallium is about 10metric tonnes as a by-product from the smelting of copper, zinc, and lead ores. Thallium is either extracted from the dusts from the smelter flues or from residues such as slag that are collected {{at the end of}} the smelting process. The raw materials used for thallium production contain large amounts of other materials and therefore a purification is the first step. The thallium is leached either by the use of a base or sulfuric acid from the material. The thallium is precipitated several times from the solution to remove impurities. At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>it</b> is converted to thallium sulfate and the thallium is extracted by electrolysis on platinum or stainless steel plates. The production of thallium decreased by about 33% in the period from 1995 to 2009 – from about 15metric tonnes to about 10tonnes. Since there are several small deposits or ores with relatively high thallium content, it would be possible to increase the production if a new application, such as a hypothetical thallium-containing high-temperature superconductor, becomes practical for widespread use outside of the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The X-Files {{was a hit}} for the Fox {{network and}} {{received}} largely positive reviews, although its long-term story arc was criticized near the conclusion. Initially considered a cult series, {{it turned into a}} pop culture touchstone that tapped into public mistrust of governments and large institutions and embraced conspiracy theories and spirituality. Both the series itself and lead actors Duchovny and Anderson received multiple awards and nominations, and by <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>it</b> was the longest-running science fiction series in U.S. television history. The series also spawned a franchise which includes The Lone Gunmen spin-off, two theatrical films and accompanying merchandise. After the final theatrical film in 2008, fans continued to push for a third movie to conclude the series' plot lines, and in March 2015, Fox eventually announced that the series would return, with Chris Carter as executive producer and writer, and Duchovny, Anderson, Pileggi, Davis, and Gish all reprising their roles.|$|E
