In this book, Joe Warren, a {{deckhand}} on Anderson during the November 10, 1975, storm, said that the storm changed {{the way things were}} done. He stated, [...] "After that, trust me, when a gale came up we dropped the hook [...] We dropped the hook because they found out <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>ones</b> could sink." [...] Mark Thompson wrote, [...] "Since the loss of the Fitz, some captains may be more prone to go to anchor, rather than venturing out in a severe storm, but there are still too many who like to portray themselves as 'heavy weather sailors.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1938, the Civil Aeronautics Act was passed, {{creating}} the Civil Aeronautics Authority. This ended the free-wheeling bush flying era of Alaska aviation, and assigned specific routes {{to the air}} carriers. The new law established a [...] "grandfather clause" [...] which entitled existing carriers to receive certificates for routes where the carrier could prove that it had provided continuous service on a route during the period May 14, 1938 to August 22, 1938. This regulation resulted in the consolidation of several airlines; <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>ones</b> got bigger, and the small ones disappeared. Goodman and the Strandbergs determined to make Star Air Lines one of Alaska’s major carriers.|$|E

2500|$|In late July 2013, Lonnie Snowden said he {{believed}} his son {{would be better off}} staying in Russia, and didn't believe he would receive a fair trial in the U.S. In mid-October, he visited his son in Moscow, later telling the press that he was pleased with Edward's situation, and still believed Russia was the best choice for his asylum, saying he wouldn't have to worry about people [...] "rushing across the border to render him." [...] Lonnie Snowden commented that his son was living comfortably in Russia and found Moscow [...] "modern and sophisticated." [...] Edward Snowden's Russian lawyer, Anatoly Kucherena, announced on October 31 that his client had found a website maintenance job at one of Russia's largest websites, but declined to identify the site. Jesselyn Radack, one of Snowden's American lawyers, said she was unaware of any new job. Asked about this by The Moscow Times in June 2014, The Guardian correspondent Luke Harding replied, [...] "Kucherena is completely unreliable as a source. We [...] did the rounds of Russian IT companies when he made that claim last year and none of them—none of <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>ones,</b> at least—confirmed this." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was in 1896 that D. Ward King first {{dragged the}} road with an old frostbitten pump stock and an oak post. The {{improvement}} in the dirt roads it worked was dramatic. Until then, {{the only way to}} firm up dirt roads had been to dump layers of stone on them and then press it in with a heavy roller to make a road surface resistant to turning into muck after every rain. This method was fairly effective, but it was also labor-intensive and expensive. These stone-permeated roads were called [...] "macadamized roads". These roads took their name from their Scotch inventor, John Loudon McAdam. Using his method, roads were covered with several layers of stone, starting with large ones and then reducing their size in each successive layer. The stones in the first level would be {{about the size of a}} human head. The stones in the next layer would be about the size of a fist. The final layer would be of stones of about the size of golf balls. It was grueling work to haul this heavy stone to the places needed, to unload it in the right places and then to spread it evenly over the road surface with only horse-drawn wagons and hand-held shovels and rakes. Further, in the days before powered stone crushers, there was the additional and very arduous task of smashing much bigger rocks down to the right size for use in the respective layers. This work came to be known as [...] "making <b>the</b> <b>big</b> <b>ones</b> into the small ones." [...] Men did it by hand by smashing large rocks with sledgehammers. In many states, convicts did this work and sometimes even built these macadamized roads by working on the roads themselves. When these convict crews worked directly on these roads, necessarily outside the walls of the prison, each man was typically chained to the next to prevent runaways. These convict road crews became the infamous [...] "chain gangs" [...] of that day. In the days of horse power, this method was just too time-consuming and expensive to be practical for widespread use.|$|E
