That afternoon, General Nguyễn Khánh arrived in Pleiku to meet with Westmoreland and Bundy, and they both informed him that recommendations for air strikes against North Vietnam had been made to the President of the United States.|$|E

5|$|Rogers {{outlined}} {{the request for}} the establishment of the commission, with four members to be appointed by each house of Congress and three by President Calvin Coolidge. Rodgers and Dallinger wanted $10,000 for the commission, and for Congress to authorize the issuance of commemorative coins and stamps. Rogers told the committee that the language for the legislative provisions for the coin had been borrowed from the bill for the Pilgrim Tercentenary half dollar (1920–1921), and reminded them of other commemorative coins that had been issued. At the time, commemorative coins were not sold by the government—Congress, in authorizing legislation, designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase the coins at face value and vend them to the public at a premium. A maximum of 300,000 coins was requested. Dallinger noted that the government would incur no cost from the commemorative half dollars: it would profit from the seignorage and would never be called upon to redeem them, as they would be retained by collectors. After the two congressmen appeared, Chairman Luce introduced a letter from <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Majority</b> Leader, Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts, indicating his support for the bill. Luce reported his own version of the resolution the following day, with his committee's recommendation that it pass.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores majoritarian procedural exceptions, {{which are}} special procedures in that exempt designated bills from a filibuster {{on the floor}} of <b>the</b> United States <b>Senate.</b> I argue that these rules are created in order to ease the passage of legislation that will improve the electoral prospects of <b>the</b> <b>Senate’s</b> <b>majority</b> party. In Chapter 1, I describe these rules. In Chapter 2, I explore patterns in the creation of one class of the procedures, known as oversight exceptions, which induce the president to take actions favored by <b>the</b> <b>Senate’s</b> <b>majority</b> party that he would otherwise avoid. In Chapter 3, I investigate the creation of a second class of the procedures, known as delegation exceptions; these rules help <b>the</b> <b>Senate’s</b> <b>majority</b> party reduce <b>the</b> negative electoral consequences of certain policy choices. In Chapters 4 and 5, I conduct a case of study of one particular majoritarian exception: the budget reconciliation procedures. Chapter 4 describes these rules and their history and offers a theoretical account and accompanying empirical test of when we should expect to observe their use. Chapter 5 then explores the policy consequences of the reconciliation rules. Finally, Chapter 6 summarizes my findings and discusses their implications for procedural reform in Congress...|$|R
