6000|$|I {{have been}} hearing from Clare and Margaret, and writing to them--with the effect on my {{feelings}} so great that even if I hadn't got their leave to address you thus directly, and their impression that you would probably have patience with me, I should still be perpetrating this act, from the simple force of--well, let me say of fond affection and have done with it. I really take as much interest in your movements and doings, in all your conditions, as if I were Margaret herself--such great analogies prevail between the heavy uncle and the infant daughter when following their object up is concerned. I haven't kept my thoughts off you at all--not indeed that I have tried!--since those days early in the winter, in that little London house, where you were so admirably interesting and vivid about your first initiations and impressions and I pressed you so hard over the whole ground, and didn't know whether most to feel your acute intelligence at play or your kindness to your poor old gaping visitor. I've neglected no opportunity of news of you since then, though I've picked the article up in every and any way save by writing to you--which my respect for your worried attention and general overstrain forbade me to regard as a decent act. At the same time, when I heard of your having, at Crowborough or wherever, a sharp illness of some duration, I turned really sick myself for sympathy--I couldn't see the faintest propriety in that. And now my sentiments hover about you with the closest fidelity, and when I think of the stiff experience and all the strange initiations (so to express my sense of them) that must have crowded upon you, I am lost in awe at the vision. For you're the kind of defender of his country to whom I take off my hat most abjectly and utterly--the thinking, feeling, refining hero, who knows and compares, and winces and overcomes, and on whose lips I promise myself {{one of these days}} <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>again</b> with a gape even beyond that of last winter. I wish to goodness I could do something more and better for you than merely address you these vain words; however, they won't hurt you at least, for they carry with them an intensity of good will. I won't pretend to give you any news, for it's you who make all ours--and we are now really in the way, I think, of doing everything conceivable to back you up in that, and thereby become worthy of you. America, my huge queer country, is being flouted by Germany in a manner that looks more and more like a malignant design, and if this should (very soon) truly appear, and that weight of consequent prodigious resentment {{should be able to do}} nothing else than throw itself into the scale, then we should be backing you up to some purpose. The weight would in one way and another be overwhelming. But these are vast issues, and I have only wanted to give you for the moment my devotedest personal blessing. Think of me as in the closest sustaining communion with Clare, and don't for a moment dream that I propose--I mean presume--to lay upon you the smallest burden of notice of the present beyond just letting it remind you of the fond faith of yours, my dear Wilfred, all affectionately, ...|$|E
6000|$|Yes, {{delightful}} I shall undertake finding it, {{and perhaps}} even making it, to read J. R. L.'s exposure back into its light; which I in fact see begin to shine for me more amply during those very minutes of our wait for our distinguished host and even the several that followed the latter's arrival and his seating himself opposite the unknown guest, whose identity {{he had failed to}} grasp. Nothing, exactly, could have made dear Lowell more [...] "my" [...] Lowell, as I have presumed to figure him, than the stretch of uncertainty so supervening and which, in its form of silence at first completely unbroken between the two poets, rapidly took on for me monstrous proportions. I conversed with my gentle neighbour during what seemed an eternity--really but hearing, as the minutes sped, all that Tennyson didn't say to Lowell and all that Lowell wouldn't on any such compulsion as that say to Tennyson. I like, however, <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> <b>again</b> upon the hush--for the sweetness of the relief of its break by the fine Tennysonian growl. I had never dreamed, no, of a growling Tennyson--I had too utterly otherwise fantasticated; but no line of Locksley Hall rolled out as I was to happen soon after to hear it, could have been sweeter than the interrogative sound of [...] "Do you know anything about Lowell?" [...] launched on the chance across the table and crowned at once by Mrs. Tennyson's anxious quaver: [...] "Why, my dear, this is Mr. Lowell!" [...] The clearance took place successfully enough, and the incident, I am quite aware, seems to shrink with it; in spite of which I still cherish the reduced reminiscence for its connections: so far as my vision of Lowell was concerned they began at that moment so to multiply. A belated guest or two more came in, and I wish I could for my modesty's sake refer to this circumstance alone the fact that nothing more of the occasion survives for me save the intense but restricted glow of certain instants, in another room, to which we had adjourned for smoking and where my alarmed sense of the Bard's restriction to giving what he had as a bard only became under a single turn of his hand a vision of quite general munificence. Incredibly, inconceivably, he had read--and not only read but admired, and not only admired but understandingly referred; referred, time and some accident aiding, the appreciated object, a short tale I had lately put forth, to its actually present author, who could scarce believe his ears on hearing the thing superlatively commended; pronounced, that is, by the illustrious speaker, more to his taste than no matter what other like attempt. Nothing would induce me to disclose the title of the piece, which {{has little to do with}} the matter; my point is but in its having on the spot been matter of pure romance to me that I was there and positively so addressed. For it was a solution, the happiest in the world, and from which I at once extracted enormities of pleasure: my relation to whatever had bewildered me simply became perfect: the author of In Memoriam had [...] "liked" [...] my own twenty pages, and his doing so was a gage of his grace in which I felt I should rest forever--in which I have in fact rested to this hour. My own basis of liking--such a blessed supersession of all worryings and wonderings!--was accordingly established, and has met every demand made of it.|$|E

500|$|Marie: Julien visits Marie and Simon's old apartment, {{where the}} letting agent shows him {{a room that}} Julien chillingly {{recognises}} — it {{is identical to the}} room Marie has prepared. This is where Marie <b>hanged</b> herself, trying <b>to</b> frame Simon in revenge after a terrible row. Julien returns home and Marie silently leads him to the attic where she has prepared a noose, feeling she has <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> herself <b>again.</b> Julien carries her downstairs, and they make love again. She leaves to meet Adrienne, who says that she knows that Marie no longer wants to die. They agree they do not know the rules of their situation. Returning, Marie interrupts Julien about <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> himself {{in a desperate attempt to}} join her. He runs to the kitchen and tries to slit his wrist; Marie stops him and her wrist and his palm are cut. Marie warns him that he will lose all memory of her, but he says that all he wants is for her to be there. Marie slowly covers her face with her hands —"the forbidden sign"— and Julien becomes oblivious to her and unaware of why he is bleeding. Madame X arrives for her letter and he hands it over, confused by her enquiries about [...] "l'autre personne". Madame X burns the letter, freeing Adrienne. Marie cries while watching Julien sleep, and as her tears land on her wrist her cut bleeds. Julien wakes and asks who she is; she replies that she is [...] "the one he loved". He doubts it as she's [...] "not his type", but she says with a smile to give her a little time.|$|R
500|$|Cragh's {{recovery}} {{began the}} day after his hanging, but it was some time– one witness said 15 days– before he was able to stand unaided. That he did not recover more quickly cast doubt on the validity of the miracle, as miracles were supposed to be immediate, but [...] "partial miracles" [...] could be explained by the [...] "lukewarm faith of those who had made the vow". Once sufficiently recovered, Cragh was summoned to appear at Swansea Castle, before Lord and Lady Briouze. The chaplain, William of Codineston, was also present. Cragh explained, [...] "with great fear and apprehension" [...] according to the chaplain, that as he was being taken to the gallows he prayed to Thomas de Cantilupe to save him. His fear resulted from his concern that he might be executed again, and he had good reason to be worried. Although those who survived were usually pardoned, it was not unknown for them <b>to</b> be <b>hanged</b> <b>again.</b> Between the time of his hanging and his appearance at the castle Cragh may have convinced himself that he had been saved by Cantilupe, or he may simply have decided that it would be prudent for him {{to go along with the}} story for his own safety. Cragh went on to claim that as he was hanging from the gallows a bishop dressed all in white appeared, and saved him either by supporting his feet or by replacing his tongue in his mouth.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, he is {{separated}} from Harriet by local townspeople who identify him as a witch and intend <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> him. <b>Again,</b> something unexpected happens to the flow of time, placing him a short time in the past, which is a ghostly, decaying shadow of the world. He is able {{to walk out of}} the town before returning to normal time. He encounters Riley, an old man nursing a decrepit pickup truck on a journey north. They travel together for a while, discussing the state of the world. Fishhook is operating a commercial monopoly on the science and technology found in the galaxy, disrupting commerce and daily life while people lapse into superstition and hatred of paranormals. Some paranormals are retaliating by using their powers to terrorize people. They meet a group of young levitators who fly around at night. Riley shoots at them with a shotgun, but Blaine tries to make peace using his telepathy. He bonds with one young girl, Anita. He becomes separated from Riley, and enters a trance which results in him returning to visit the alien, who he calls the Pinkness. The Pinkness is far older than the human race, and has been traveling the universe, exchanging minds with beings of all kinds. Blaine settles in to learn from the Pinkness, but is abruptly returned to his body which has been in a coma for days. He is in hospital next to Riley, who is severely injured.|$|R

40|$|Genre: Medicine/huru. I and Pidhu went to Bako {{to record}} 'huru' and stories 20 Sept - 15 in the morning. In this {{recording}} Sofia Sopu tells her 'huru hola' (huru snake). She demonstrated before {{us how to}} make the 'huru' sign/prohibition (picture). We brought the usual sirih pinang (sometimes we bring something else as "sirih pinang"). Sopu tells how this 'huru' was inherited to her, at an early age, after other family members were incapable. 'Huru' refers both to the curse-prohibition, to protect the crops in the plantation – whether jambu (cashew "water fruit") mango trees – from theft, and the symptoms. Symptoms: stomach ache, vomiting, severe diarrhea. She cures five times, at five evenings, and the patient has to 'cega', pay a symbolic sum, if not he/she will still suffer. The sign that is hung is made from long grass ('ci'i') and a long frilly piece of cut lontar leaf (sign of snake, stomache ache, it is moving and turning isside the belly). The sign is charged with five "strikes" by a machete, and this is repeated in the cure, that also can use a comb ('hubi'). The sign is taken down carefully, five times, to the ground before it is safe to pick fruits again. The cure is with chewed areca nut and piper betel, 'kaliraga' root and long grass tips, first aiming with the machete towards the navel five times, then the chewed materials are put on the stomach. Long grass should not be put on the liver. It is a hot, bad material, volcano and fire, and she only picks it at night and somewhere a bit far from the village. Sopu said that she does not want <b>to</b> <b>hang</b> 'huru' <b>again</b> because she does not want to chew ginger and kaliraga, because she thinks it damages her teeth. Recorded by SD with the AT 2020 mic in her house sitting on the tiled floor of the living/guest room. Present were also Pidhu (Ebbe), who asks questions {{at the end of the}} recording. We had a good time in Bako – people were very open and quick to speak and teach, although it was my first real visit. Pidhu knew them though and his family have relations extending to Dure/Bako.
