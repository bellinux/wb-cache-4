5|$|For his part, Thompson said {{he thought}} the judge was trying to protect Moore's {{criminal}} conviction at any cost. He also complained about the judge's ethics, saying a local attorney who claimed to have influence on <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>had</b> assured him the case would be dismissed unless the attorney was on Thompson's team, and also claimed that Rockstar Entertainment and Take Two Interactive posted slanderous comments about him on their website.|$|E
5|$|Taylor {{received}} a ten-year sentence, the maximum sentence <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>had</b> {{the power to}} impose. The sentences received by the other defendants ranged from four years to nine-and-a-half years imprisonment.

5|$|Kasab's {{trial began}} on 6 May 2009. He {{initially}} pleaded not guilty, but later admitted his guilt on 20 July 2009. He initially apologised {{for the attacks}} and claimed that he deserved {{the death penalty for}} his crimes, but later retracted these claims, saying that he had been tortured by police to force his confession, and that he had been arrested while roaming the beach. The court had accepted his plea, but {{due to the lack of}} completeness within his admittance, <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>had</b> deemed that many of the 86 charges were not addressed and therefore the trial continued.|$|E
5|$|When Berkman {{was brought}} to the {{courtroom}} on September19, the jury had already been empaneled. The district attorney had selected the jury without allowing Berkman to examine prospective jurors, and <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>had</b> no objection to the unusual procedure. Berkman was charged with six counts: felonious assault with the intent to kill Frick; felonious assault with the intent to kill Lawrence Leishman, who had been in Frick's office {{at the time of the}} attack; feloniously entering the offices of the Carnegie Steel Company on three occasions; and unlawfully carrying concealed weapons. Berkman pleaded not guilty to all charges.|$|E
5|$|When Freddy Mike's {{statement}} {{became known}} to the public, various petitions and campaigns to free Williams were organised throughout the country. A petition containing 35,000 signatures requesting a reprieve {{was sent to the}} Home Secretary. As soon as the House of Commons opened on 23 January 1913, McKenna was questioned by Labour, Conservative, and Liberal MPs. Robert Munro, MP for Wick Burghs, made a speech asking the Home Secretary {{to take into account the}} conflicting accounts, lack of any direct evidence, and the way <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>had</b> directed the jury, and pardon Williams. In this he was supported by Will Crooks, the Marquess of Tullibardine, and Ian Macpherson.|$|E

5|$|Bamber first sought {{leave to}} appeal in November 1986, arguing that <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>had</b> {{misdirected}} the jury. The application was heard and refused by a single judge in April 1988. Bamber's lawyer requested a full hearing before three judges, arguing that the trial judge's summing up had been biased against Bamber, that his language had been too forceful, {{and that he had}} undermined the defence by advancing his own theory. The lawyer also argued that the defence had not pressed Julie Mugford about her dealings with the media, but should have, because as soon as the trial was over her story began to appear in newspapers. The judges rejected the application in March 1989.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{organised}} {{a meeting}} with Johnston, starting at 09:00 on 18 August, where he informed the British High Commissioner that he had considered the Lisbon appointment extensively, {{with the help of}} Dupont, several legal advisers, and a judge of the Rhodesian High Court. <b>The</b> <b>judge</b> <b>had</b> examined the relevant documents, and had {{come to the conclusion that}} Dupont's interpretation of them was correct. Smith therefore felt certain that Reedman's appointment was legitimate so long as Portugal agreed. A long argument ensued, with neither man willing to budge. Smith said that he had always tried to be flexible and civil, but that he and his government felt they had to make a stand. By making clear to Lisbon the exact nature of their proposed representative, and informing Britain of their intent, Smith said the Rhodesians had filled every legal obligation.|$|E
5|$|Two {{months into}} his term, Dow {{inadvertently}} ran afoul {{of his own}} prohibition laws. After setting up a committee to dispense alcohol for medicinal and industrial use (the only uses permitted), Dow ordered $1600 worth of alcohol and stored it at City Hall. Dow neglected to appoint an official agent to hold it there; because the invoice was in his name, this placed Dow in technical violation of the law. Dow's enemies seized on the mistake and demanded that the police search the municipal building for illegal liquor. Because the recent additions to the Maine law had removed judicial discretion, <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>had</b> {{no choice but to}} issue the warrant. Police seized the alcohol, but did not arrest Dow.|$|E

25|$|In 1977, Polanski {{was arrested}} and charged with drugging and raping a 13-year-old girl. He {{subsequently}} pled guilty to the charge of statutory rape. He was released from prison after serving 42 days, and as part of an apparent plea bargain, was to be put on probation. When he learned that <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>had</b> changed his mind and planned to reject the plea bargain, he fled to Paris before sentencing.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the death}} penalty was imposed, both the {{conviction}} and sentence were automatically appealed to the Georgia Supreme Court. Davis and his lawyers requested a new trial, citing problems with the trial site and selection of the jury. The request was denied in March 1992. In March 1993, the Georgia Supreme Court also upheld Davis's conviction and sentence, ruling that <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>had</b> correctly refused to change trial site and that the racial composition of the jury did not deny his rights. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal in November 1993. Direct appeals having been exhausted, in March 1994 an order was signed for Davis's execution.|$|E

Iguarán acknowledged that, although Vallejo contacted his office on 4 July, <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>had</b> decided to close the trial on 9 July, several weeks before the prospective closing date. This action was seen as too late; but, in 2011 Santofimio was sentenced to 24 years in prison {{for his role in the}} assassination.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, {{the high}} court {{addressed}} the issue of whether it could sanction a judge without a formal recommendation from the JSC. In this case, a District Court judge had voluntarily admitted his misconduct, and the JSC recommended public censure to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court held that it could accept the JSC's recommendation, but was not bound by it. It could, if it wished, impose a harsher sanction (and did so). However, the court also held that because <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>had</b> voluntarily admitted misconduct but had not agreed to submit to sanction, the judge should be offered the opportunity to withdraw his voluntarily admission. This would trigger a new, formal JSC investigation.|$|E

25|$|The pace of {{the trials}} was very fast before the standing-room-only, all-white audience. The judge and {{prosecutor}} wanted to speed the nine trials to avoid violence, so the first trial took {{a day and a}} half, and the rest took place one right after the other, in just one day. <b>The</b> <b>judge</b> <b>had</b> ordered the Alabama bar to assist the defendants, but the only attorney who volunteered was Milo Moody, a 69-year-old attorney who had not defended a case in decades. The judge persuaded Stephen Roddy, a Chattanooga, Tennessee, real estate lawyer, to assist him. Roddy admitted he had not had time to prepare and was not familiar with Alabama law, but agreed to aid Moody.|$|E
25|$|One {{prominent}} case {{occurred in}} October 2011 {{when the first}} person in Mali was prosecuted on allegations of slavery for exploiting Iddar Ag Ogazide. Temedt pressured for the case and provided financial assistance to Ag Ogazide's family during the difficult period. After a first hearing in which the accused claimed that he had paid Ag Ogazide for his work, the trial was delayed when <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>had</b> to flee Gao for his safety. With the Tuareg Rebellion and the military coup, the case has been delayed further. The organization also pushes the government to further criminalize slavery and add additional sanctions against the practice and works with anti-slavery organizations in other countries and with Anti-Slavery International to coordinate efforts.|$|E
25|$|The bombing {{occurred}} at 4:58 PM on 19 July 1992, 57 {{days after the}} bombing of Capaci, in which Borsellino's friend, anti-mafia magistrate Giovanni Falcone, had been killed {{with his wife and}} police escort. The only survivor of the escort in the massacre of Via D'Amelio, Antonino Vullo, said <b>the</b> <b>judge</b> <b>had</b> stayed in his summer residence outside Palermo from 1:30pm to around 4:00pm, when he and the escort drove to Via D'Amelio in the Sicilian capital, where he was to meet his mother. When they arrived, Vullo and the other agents noticed nothing unusual except some parked cars. The car in which Borsellino had been travelling exploded, along with one of the escort cars, while Vullo was sitting in a third car.|$|E
