40|$|<b>Foreign</b> <b>policy</b> {{analysis}} {{stands at}} the crossroads of different issues and academic disciplines, including political economy and international relations. In this study, <b>the</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policies</b> of Greece and Spain are analysed in the period between 1945 and the early 1990 s, {{in the context of the}} world-system approach in which <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> is considered a part of the interaction between a single world-economy and multiple political structures (nation states). In other words, this is a study of the political economy of <b>foreign</b> <b>policy.</b> <b>The</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policies</b> of Greece and Spain are analysed in the context of the world and national levels of the organisation of power and production. In this general context, the two countries are defined as the interesting but debatable category of semiperiphery states in the world-system hierarchy of states. The analysis of Greece and Spain shows that <b>the</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policies</b> of both countries were strongly affected by their semiperipheral development patterns during both the "expansion-hegemonic rise" and "contraction-hegemonic decline" periods of the world-economy. The study examines the relative impact of national and international structural factors, the distribution of wealth and power, the state, external and internal economic and power elites on <b>the</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policies</b> of Greece and Spain. The examination demonstrates the effect of their semiperipheral status on their <b>foreign</b> <b>policy.</b> <b>The</b> main theoretical contention of the study is that the world-system analysis and the concept of "semiperiphery" provide a useful framework for the study of the political economy of <b>the</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policies</b> of middle income countries...|$|R

5|$|Duhalde was {{appointed}} {{president in the}} aftermath of the September 11 attacks, when <b>the</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> of the United States was strictly focused on the War on Terror. Initially, the Argentine society was divided on how to manage the bilateral relations with the US. One group wanted to keep the close relations of the previous decade, as Argentina might need foreign help to deal with the crisis. The other group preferred to maintain more distant relations. Duhalde sought to strike a balance between both options, and eventually leaned towards the second when the US refused to help Argentina.|$|E

McCain opposed keeping U.S. Marines deployed in Lebanon citing unattainable objectives, and subsequently criticized President Reagan for pulling out the troops too late; in the interim, the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing killed hundreds. McCain won re-election to the House easily in 1984, and gained {{a spot on the}} House Foreign Affairs Committee.

40|$|Continuity and Change in the Baltic Sea Region uncovers <b>the</b> Baltic States? <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> {{transition}} from Socialist Republics to EU member-states. Situated between the Russian Federation and Northern Europe, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania {{have had to}} manoeuvre within an often delicate sub-region. Since independence, <b>the</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policies</b> of <b>the</b> Baltic States have been dominated by de-Sovietization and European integration. Lying at the crossroads between small state theory and identity politics, this analysis engages {{with the development of}} Baltic <b>foreign</b> <b>policies</b> as post-Soviet, small and transitioning states. The authors argue that Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania dictated their early <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> agendas based on a process of identity construction and as a response to their regional environment. This process took the Baltic States from East to West in their <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> aspirations. Key factors in <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> making and implementation are discussed, as well as external factors that shaped Baltic <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> agendas. Overall, <b>the</b> book illustrates how continuity and change in <b>the</b> Baltic <b>foreign</b> <b>policies</b> has been shaped by both 'hard? and 'soft? factors. It is a study in <b>the</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policies</b> of transitioning states and in this regard illuminates a much larger research area beyond its geographic focus...|$|R

To do that, we are going to try to answer the following questions: What characterizes Russia's official <b>foreign</b> <b>policy?</b> What theories are there for <b>the</b> Russian <b>foreign</b> <b>policy?</b> How can <b>the</b> various theories explain <b>the</b> Russian <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> actions at <b>the</b> international level? Our theory is to try explaining how <b>the</b> Russian <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> is continuing its development during the 21 st century through three theories known as the Western liberalism, Pragmatic nationalism and Fundamental nationalism. Furthermore, to explain Russia's <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> and their behaviour, we are going to use <b>the</b> two <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> doctrines from 2000 and 2008. In addition, books and articles will also be used to explain how Russia's <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> is conducted and developed...|$|R
5|$|Shortly after, the {{religious}} reformers (and protégés of Cromwell) Robert Barnes, William Jerome and Thomas Garret were burned as heretics. Cromwell, meanwhile, {{fell out of}} favour although it is unclear exactly why, for {{there is little evidence}} of differences of domestic or foreign policy. Despite his role, he was never formally accused of being responsible for Henry's failed marriage. Cromwell was now surrounded by enemies at court, with Norfolk also able to draw on his niece's position. Cromwell was charged with treason, selling export licences, granting passports, and drawing up commissions without permission, and may also have been blamed for the failure of <b>the</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> that accompanied the attempted marriage to Anne.

5|$|The Ming {{initiated}} sporadic armed {{intervention in}} Tibet during the 14th century, {{but did not}} garrison permanent troops there. At times the Tibetans also used armed resistance against Ming forays. The Wanli Emperor (r.1572–1620) made attempts to reestablish Sino-Tibetan relations after the Mongol-Tibetan alliance initiated in 1578, which affected <b>the</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> of the subsequent Qing dynasty (1644–1912) of China in {{their support for the}} Dalai Lama of the Gelug school. By the late 16th century, the Mongols were successful armed protectors of the Gelug Dalai Lama, after increasing their presence in the Amdo region. This culminated in Güshi Khan's (1582–1655) conquest of Tibet from 1637–1642 and the establishment of the Ganden Phodrang regime by the 5th Dalai Lama with his help.|$|E
5|$|The Ming {{sporadically}} sent armed {{forays into}} Tibet during the 14th century, which the Tibetans successfully resisted. Several scholars {{point out that}} unlike the preceding Mongols, the Ming dynasty did not garrison permanent troops in Tibet. The Wanli Emperor (r. 1572–1620) attempted to reestablish Sino-Tibetan relations {{in the wake of}} a Mongol-Tibetan alliance initiated in 1578, an alliance which affected <b>the</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> of the subsequent Manchu Qing dynasty (1644–1912) in their support for the Dalai Lama of the Yellow Hat sect. By the late 16th century, the Mongols proved to be successful armed protectors of the Yellow Hat Dalai Lama after their increasing presence in the Amdo region, culminating in the conquest of Tibet by Güshi Khan (1582–1655) in 1642, establishing the Khoshut Khanate.|$|E

40|$|Feminist {{theories}} {{of international relations}} traditionally criticize realism {{as a representative of}} masculine values in the international relations.

The aim of this thesis is to analyse feminisation and masculinisation of <b>the</b> Czech <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> in cases of three events [...] the terroristic attacks from September 11, 2001, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. This thesis points out the plurality of masculine and feminine values.

5|$|After {{abortive}} {{talks between}} Smith and Wilson in 1966 and 1968, a constitution was agreed {{upon by the}} Rhodesian and British governments in November 1971; however, when a British test of Rhodesian public opinion was undertaken in early 1972, black opinion was judged to be against the new deal, causing it to be shelved. The Rhodesian Bush War suddenly re-erupted in December 1972, {{after two years of}} relative inactivity, when ZANLA attacked Altena and Whistlefield Farms in north-eastern Rhodesia. After a successful security force counter-campaign during 1973 and 1974, drastic changes in <b>the</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> of the Rhodesian government's two main backers, Portugal and South Africa, caused the conflict's momentum to shift in the nationalists' favour. In April 1974, the Portuguese government was overthrown by a military coup and replaced with a leftist administration in favour of ending the unpopular Colonial War in Angola, Mozambique and Portugal's other African territories.|$|E
5|$|Blaine’s {{earliest}} expressions in <b>the</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> sphere {{were those}} of a reactionary Anglophobe, {{but by the end}} of his career his relationship with the United Kingdom had become more moderate and nuanced. A dispute over seal hunting in the waters off Alaska was the cause of Blaine’s first interaction with Britain as Harrison’s Secretary of State. A law passed in 1889 required Harrison to ban seal hunting in Alaskan waters, but Canadian fishermen believed they had the right to continue fishing there. Soon thereafter, the United States Navy seized several Canadian ships near the Pribilof Islands. Blaine entered into negotiations with Britain and the two nations agreed to submit the dispute to arbitration by a neutral tribunal. Blaine was no longer in office when the tribunal began its work, but the result was to allow the hunting once more, albeit with some regulation, and to require the United States to pay damages of $473,151. Ultimately, the nations signed the North Pacific Fur Seal Convention of 1911, which outlawed open-water seal hunting.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the report}} {{produced}} by the OIR, by 1957 the CIA realized that its version {{of the history of}} the Árbenz government and the coup were not gaining traction. Books written by defenders of the Árbenz government, which were strongly critical of the US intervention, were generally better received. Nationalist Latin Americans were inclined to view the Castillo Armas government as a creation of the US. As a result, the US government decided to allow Ronald Schneider, a historian who was in the process of completing his Ph.D, to access the PBHistory archive. Scheider published Communism in Guatemala: 1944 to 1954 in 1959. Later observers have stated that the publication may have been subsidized in some way by the CIA: both <b>the</b> <b>Foreign</b> <b>Policy</b> Research Institute, where Schneider worked, and Frederick A. Praeger, who published Schneider's book, received CIA funds. Schneider stated in his book that the Comite was responsible for collecting the documents he accessed, but did not mention the CIA's role in funding the Comite, nor did he explain how the documents came to the US. Schneider's book did not rely on PBHistory material alone, but also on information that Schneider gathered during a trip to Mexico and Guatemala in 1957. The book was generally well received.|$|E

5|$|Faced {{with the}} {{possibility}} of annihilation, Alboin made an alliance in 566 with the Avars under Bayan I, at the expense of some tough conditions: the Avars demanded a tenth of the Lombards' cattle, half of the war booty, and on the war's conclusion all of the lands held by the Gepids. The Lombards played on the pre-existing hostility between the Avars and the Byzantines, claiming that the latter were allied with the Gepids. Cunimund, on the other hand, encountered hostility when he once again asked the Emperor for military assistance, as the Byzantines had been angered by the Gepids' failure to cede Sirmium to them, as had been agreed. Moreover, Justin II was moving away from <b>the</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> of Justinian, and believed in dealing more strictly with bordering states and peoples. Attempts to mollify Justin II with tributes failed, and as a result the Byzantines kept themselves neutral if not outright supportive of the Avars.|$|E
5|$|Harrison had {{developed}} {{his foreign policy}} based largely on Blaine’s ideas, and {{at the start of}} his term, Harrison and Blaine had very similar views on the United States' place in the world. In spite of their shared worldview, however, the two men became personally unfriendly as the term went on. Harrison was conscious that his Secretary of State was more popular than he, and while he admired Blaine’s gift for diplomacy, he grew displeased with Blaine’s frequent absence from his post because of illness, and suspected that Blaine was angling for the presidential nomination in 1892. Harrison tried to limit how many “Blaine men” filled subordinate positions in the State Department and denied Blaine’s request that his son, Walker, be appointed First Assistant Secretary, instead naming him Solicitor of the Department of State. Despite the growing personal rancor, the two men continued, with one exception, to agree on <b>the</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> questions of the day.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy easily {{defeated}} Republican businessman Ray Shamie to win {{re-election in}} 1982. Senate leaders granted him {{a seat on}} the Armed Services Committee, while allowing him to keep his other major seats despite the traditional limit of two such seats. Kennedy became very visible in opposing aspects of <b>the</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>policy</b> of the Reagan administration, including U.S. intervention in the Salvadoran Civil War and U.S. support for the Contras in Nicaragua, and in opposing Reagan-supported weapons systems, including the B-1 bomber, the MX missile, and the Strategic Defense Initiative. Kennedy became the Senate's leading advocate for a nuclear freeze and was a critic of Reagan's confrontational policies toward the Soviet Union. A 1983 memorandum from KGB chairman Viktor Chebrikov to general secretary Yuri Andropov noted this stance and asserted that Kennedy, through former Senator John Tunney's discussions with Soviet contacts, had suggested that U.S.-Soviet relations might be improved if Kennedy and Andropov could meet in person to discuss arms control issues and if top Soviet officials, via Kennedy's help, were able to address the American public through the U.S. news media.
