5|$|Although {{thallium}} is a modestly abundant {{element in}} the Earth's crust, with a concentration estimated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> 0.7mg/kg, mostly in association with potassium-based minerals in clays, soils, and granites, thallium is not generally economically recoverable from these sources. The major source of thallium for practical purposes is the trace amount that is found in copper, lead, zinc, and other heavy-metal-sulfide ores.|$|E

5|$|Comet Hale–Bopp's {{activity}} and outgassing were not spread uniformly over its nucleus, but instead came from several specific jets.

In the early 18th century, the Calusa came under attack from the Yamasee to the north. They asked the Spanish for refuge in Cuba, where almost 200 died of illness.

5|$|The {{biological}} half-life of strontium in humans has variously been reported as from 14 to 600 days, 1000 days, 18 years, 30 years and, at an upper limit, 49 years.

However, by averaging all excretion paths, the overall biological half-life is estimated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>about</b> 18 years. The elimination rate of strontium is strongly affected {{by age and}} sex, {{due to differences in}} bone metabolism.|$|E
