5|$|The palace was {{originally}} {{surrounded by a}} medieval deer park. When <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> built, streams were diverted to form the moat as a reservoir. In the 1820s, the grounds within <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> planted and laid out as pleasure grounds by Bishop George Henry Law, who created a reflecting pond near the springs. Parts of the buildings are still used as a residence by the current bishop, however much of the palace is now used for public functions and as a tourist attraction.|$|E

5|$|Southampton's town walls {{remained}} an important defensive feature during the 15th century, the gatehouses sometimes {{being used as}} important civic facilities, including acting as the town's guildhall and housing the town's gaol. From {{the end of the}} 17th century their importance steadily declined and <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> slowly demolished or adapted for other uses throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. This process continued into the early 20th century until, in the post-war years, <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> recognised as an important historical feature of Southampton. Conservation projects have since occurred and the walls are now promoted as a tourist attraction.|$|E

5|$|Another {{change in}} the 1370s was the {{formalisation}} {{of the process of}} guarding and maintaining the walls. During the invasion scare of 1377, Edward instructed the mayor to review these processes; it appears that the four wards of the town were surveyed, and each property was assigned a piece of the wall to maintain, varying according {{to the size of the}} property. For these purposes, <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> measured out in units called loupes, or embrasures. The four wards were also responsible for the security and policing of the town.|$|E
5|$|By 1474, cannons {{had been}} {{introduced}} in Mdina. Other extensive preparations for an attack {{were made in the}} 1480s, when the fortifications were once again improved under the direction of Sicilian military engineers. At this point, some buildings in Rabat were demolished to clear the fortifications' line of fire. By 1522, the fortifications were being modernized with the construction of embrasures. However, <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> still regarded as obsolete, since they lacked bastions and could not resist bombardment from modern artillery.|$|E
5|$|Excavations {{under the}} {{supervision}} of the Deutsches Archäologisches Institut Kairo (DAIK) in 2001 and 2004 revealed that the tomb had been erected and completed in a great hurry. The building works took place in a single phase; <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> plastered roughly; and the monument had collapsed several times over the centuries. During the Middle Kingdom, Peribsen's tomb was restored at least twice together with the tomb of Djer, which was thought to be that of Osiris.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, Preckwinkle {{decided to}} paint over two 36-year-old, unmaintained and {{severely}} damaged public murals in the 47th Street Metra underpass. The murals {{had been created}} by graffiti artists, working with permission from the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs, and had represented themes that included Latin-American, African, Mayan, Indian, and Native American spiritual practices. <b>The</b> <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> later covered with newly commissioned murals: one {{is made up of}} a series of ceramic tiles and the other is a traditional painted mural featuring the city and important historical South Side figures, including former Alderman Dorothy Tillman.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the staff}} from the Ludlow {{incarnation}} of Hibiscus agreed to move to London to continue working at the restaurant, including head chef Marcus McGuinness and sommelier Simon Freeman. Hibiscus re-opened in October 2007 in its new location after following building works and planning delays. The interior of the London-based restaurant was decorated in orange and shades of brown. <b>The</b> <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> covered in pale-coloured wooden panels, and a chandelier designed {{as a series of}} globes hungs {{from the middle of the}} main dining room's ceiling.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>walls</b> <b>are</b> single-skin with exposed studs to {{the east}} and west verandahs. <b>The</b> west <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> lined with 140mm {{horizontal}} beaded tongue and groove boards. <b>The</b> south <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> clad to <b>the</b> exterior with rough sawn beaded tongue and groove boards with joins at the junctions of the stud framing and the internal partitions. <b>The</b> north <b>wall</b> <b>is</b> clad with horizontal beaded tongue and groove boards.|$|R
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> {{initially}} built {{solely from}} tamped earth. During the Longqing Emperor's period (1568) <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> strengthened by laying blue bricks {{on the top}} and exterior faces of <b>the</b> earthen <b>walls.</b> During <b>the</b> reign of Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty (1781), <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> enlarged; drainage features, crenels and other modifications were made; and the structure as it is now seen came into existence. By the end of the Qing dynasty rule, the structure had begun to deteriorate. In a limited degree the Republican Authorities carried out maintenance of <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> which <b>was</b> in a poor state. In {{the first decade of the}} 20th century, <b>the</b> <b>wall's</b> defense system <b>was</b> considered to be of strategic importance, even though demolishing of similar walls in other regions of the country was undertaken following the 1911 Revolution. In 1926, <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> attacked with bombs by enemy forces resulting in serious structural damage, but the city within <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>was</b> not affected. During the Second World War, when the Japanese carried out air bombings from 1937 to 1940, the residents built around 1,000 bunkers, as anti-aircraft shelters within the wide base (thickness of more than [...] ) of <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> A few escape openings were also made through <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> as passageways.

5|$|Murals, mostly {{replaced}} by monochromatic tin sheets, were also {{present on the}} church's ceilings. Though most ceiling paintings were unpreserved, an original work of Max Aya-ay in 1957 can still be seen on portions of the crossing. <b>The</b> <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> originally adorned with wooden images of Stations of the Cross commissioned by Father Ubeda in 1859 which were later {{replaced by}} European-made images.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the temple}} {{building}} proper was the temple enclosure, {{surrounded by a}} rectangular brick wall that symbolically protected the sacred space from outside disorder. On occasion this function was more than symbolic, especially during the last native dynasties {{in the fourth century}} BC, when <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> fully fortified in case of Persian invasion. In late temples these walls frequently had alternating concave and convex courses of bricks, so that the top of the wall undulated vertically. This pattern may have been meant to evoke the mythological waters of chaos.|$|E
5|$|Several {{kings of}} the Middle Ages lay in state in St Paul's before their {{funerals}} at Westminster Abbey, including Richard II, Henry VI and Henry VII. In {{the case of}} Richard II, the display of his body in such a public place was to counter rumours {{that he was not}} deceased. <b>The</b> <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> lined with the tombs of mediaeval bishops and nobility. In addition to the shrine of Erkenwald, two Anglo-Saxon kings were buried inside: Sebbi, King of the East Saxons, and Ethelred the Unready.|$|E

5|$|The Round Church {{featured}} {{marble and}} limestone cornices. These included {{a large number}} of intertwined ornaments and details, such as palmettes, grape clusters, leaves, and chamfers. Besides classic ornamental shapes, the cornices feature some that are entirely new in character or well-known yet redesigned motifs. Floral decoration dominates the cornices. Tiles found inside the church ruins depict birds and other animals in addition to geometric shapes and floral motifs, all glazed in either brown, yellow, green, blue, or blue-green. <b>The</b> <b>walls</b> <b>were</b> covered in polished marble facing with encrusted shapes.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{had three}} tiers of {{artillery}} – the heaviest and longest range weapons occupying the upper levels, including the keep – {{with a total}} of 39 firing positions, and 31 gunloops in the basement for handguns should close defence be required.
