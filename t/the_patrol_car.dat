5|$|Six National Guardsmen arrive, led by Sergeant Winshiser (Aleks Paunovic), as does Colonel James Livingston-Graham (Ian D. Clark), an {{experienced}} big game hunter and tracker from England {{who specializes in}} hunting man-eating tigers. Sergeant Winshiser and his men arrogantly refuse to use the sheriff's advice and help. Graham tells the sheriff the soldiers will fail due to their arrogance {{and that he will}} start his hunt for the tiger when they finish. When the guardsmen search for the tiger, it kills one silently. Graham appears and explains how the tiger did it and helps them find the body. Later, Deputy Weinman and Deputy Ezra Hundt (Karl Thordarson), the mayor's son, find one of the National Guard trucks sitting empty on the road. They investigate and Weinman tells Hundt to call their position in to headquarters. She finds that the two guardsmen were attacked by the tiger, one being killed and the other shot by his partner. Hearing Hundt blowing <b>the</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>car</b> horn, she runs back to the car, but the Tiger has already killed him. Meanwhile, Roy encounters Graham in the woods and they discuss the tiger. When Roy asks if Graham is going to kill the Tiger, Graham tells him that he must because it can't chose not to hunt whatever is around it, including people. They shake hands and part ways with Graham continuing {{to the scene of the}} National Guard attack. When he arrives, he explains how the tiger attacked the guardsmen and deputy.|$|E

25|$|After the two {{passengers}} {{were placed in}} <b>the</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>car,</b> five white Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officers – Stacey Koon, Laurence Powell, Timothy Wind, Theodore Briseno, and Rolando Solano – attempted to subdue King, {{who came out of}} the car last. King was tasered, struck with side-handled batons, then tackled to the ground and handcuffed. Sgt. Koon later testified at trial that King resisted arrest, and that he believed King was under the influence of PCP {{at the time of the}} arrest, which caused him to be very aggressive and violent toward the officers. Video footage of the arrest showed that he was attempting to get up each time he was struck, and that the police made no attempt to cuff him until he lay still.|$|E

The foils are removed when the cars are sold to the public as standard silver used cars when the lease runs out.|$|R
500|$|Bundy {{was arrested}} on August 16, 1975 in Granger, another Salt Lake City suburb, by a Utah Highway Patrol officer who {{observed}} him cruising a residential area in the pre-dawn hours, then fleeing at high speed after seeing <b>the</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>car.</b> The officer noticed that the Volkswagen's front passenger seat had been removed and placed on the rear seats, and searched the car. He found a ski mask, a second mask fashioned from pantyhose, a crowbar, handcuffs, trash bags, a coil of rope, an ice pick, and other items initially assumed to be burglary tools. Bundy explained that the ski mask was for skiing, {{he had found the}} handcuffs in a dumpster, and the rest were common household items. However, Detective Jerry Thompson remembered a similar suspect and car description from the November 1974 DaRonch kidnapping, and Bundy's name from Kloepfer's December 1974 phone call. In a search of Bundy's apartment, police found a guide to Colorado ski resorts with a checkmark by the Wildwood Inn, and a brochure advertising the Viewmont High School play in Bountiful (where Debra Kent had disappeared), but nothing sufficiently incriminating to hold him. He was released on his own recognizance. (Bundy later said that searchers missed a collection of Polaroid photographs of his victims, which he destroyed after he was released.) ...|$|E
2500|$|... 12 December 1993: two RUC {{officers}} (Constables Andrew Beacom and Ernest Smith) {{were shot}} dead by the IRA while traveling in their patrol car in Fivemiletown, County Tyrone. <b>The</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>car</b> was on Main Street {{when it was}} hit by at least 20 shots {{from both sides of}} the street.

The IRA and Martin McGuinness (on behalf of Sinn Féin) apologised for the death of the civilian, a Roman Catholic nun, Sister Catherine Dunne, a native of Dublin.|$|E
50|$|In 1933 The Police and Fire Departments were merged briefly {{under the}} Department of Safety. Two-way radios were {{installed}} in <b>the</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>cars</b> and received {{called from the}} police radio station KGZB. This allowed for “Scout Cars” to be deployed more effectively and designed to create a feeling of friendliness and safety between the department and citizens.|$|R
50|$|Nissan {{provided}} {{a wide variety}} of vehicles for the show, most notably for use as police vehicles as well as villain vehicles. The majority of <b>the</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>cars</b> in <b>the</b> show are a mix of Nissan Laurel, Gloria, Cedric as well as Skyline sedans. For vehicle wrecking scenes the 230 and 330 model Cedrics, Glorias and Laurels were mainly used; as the filming staff had strict orders not to damage any of the 430 model Cedric marked <b>patrol</b> <b>cars.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} two seasons the series {{received}} technical assistance from <b>the</b> California Highway <b>Patrol.</b> <b>The</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>cars</b> in early episodes are actual CHP vehicles with the show's car door emblem covering the CHP emblem (sometimes a real CHP star is briefly visible). For instance, the 1955 Buick Century two-door <b>patrol</b> <b>car</b> seen in early episodes was built exclusively for CHP. Eventually California Highway Patrol dropped its support, reportedly dissatisfied with how the show had evolved. At that point the show had to create its own <b>patrol</b> <b>cars</b> using non-police models, but still outfitted in CHP-style, distinctly subdued compared with many police agencies.|$|R
2500|$|Roy Truly, Lee Harvey Oswald's {{supervisor}} at the depository, reported him missing to the Dallas police. [...] About 70minutes after the assassination, Oswald {{was arrested for}} the murder of Dallas police officer J. D. Tippit. According to witness Helen Markam, Tippit had spotted Oswald walking along a sidewalk in the residential neighborhood of Oak Cliff, three miles from Dealey Plaza. Officer Tippit had earlier received a radio message that gave a description of the suspect being sought in the assassination, and he called Oswald over to <b>the</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>car.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{murder of}} Timothy Brenton {{occurred}} on October 31, 2009, in the Central District of Seattle, Washington, United States. Timothy Q. Brenton (February 9, 1970 [...] October 31, 2009), an {{officer with the}} Seattle Police Department, was seated in a parked patrol car with another officer discussing a traffic stop when a gunman stopped his vehicle alongside <b>the</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>car,</b> opened fire on both officers, and fled the scene. Brenton died at the scene and his partner sustained minor injuries. One week later, as a public memorial service for Brenton was being held at KeyArena, the suspected gunman was apprehended and seriously wounded after being shot by police officers in Tukwila.|$|E
2500|$|Serpico {{was then}} {{shot in the}} face by the suspect, with a [...]22 LR pistol, and the bullet struck just below the eye lodging {{at the top of}} his jaw. He fired back, fell to the floor, and began to bleed profusely. His police colleagues refused to make a [...] "10-13" [...] {{dispatch}} to police headquarters indicating that an officer had been shot. An elderly man who lived in the next apartment called the emergency services reporting that a man had been shot and stayed with Serpico. When a police car arrived, aware that Serpico was a fellow officer, they transported him in <b>the</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>car</b> to Greenpoint Hospital.|$|E
50|$|The Cyprus Police {{also uses}} unmarked {{vehicles}}. Unmarked vehicles {{are not necessarily}} covert {{to be used for}} undercover work. Most unmarked cars are the same models as <b>the</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>cars</b> and they are mostly used by plain clothed officers such as crime investigators, crime prevention squads, technicians etc. Most of these cars are fitted with sirens and {{can be seen in the}} streets with detachable strobe lights.|$|R
5|$|Police {{officers}} are not armed with firearms during patrolling, but have weapons locked down in <b>the</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>cars.</b> Arming of <b>the</b> locked-down weapons requires {{permission from the}} chief of police or someone designated by him. The police use Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine guns and Heckler & Koch P30 semi-automatic pistols. The Emergency Response Unit uses Diemaco C8 assault rifles. Norwegian police officers do not use electroshock weapons.|$|R
5000|$|Before July 2006, {{the city}} of Elk Grove was <b>patrolled</b> by <b>the</b> Sacramento County Sheriff's Department under contract. <b>The</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>cars</b> were Sheriff {{vehicles}} painted with [...] "Elk Grove Police {{brought to you by}} Sacramento County" [...] lettering. In 2006, {{the city of}} Elk Grove decided to form its own law enforcement agency, thus forming the Elk Grove Police Department, and ending the contract with the Sacramento County Sheriff's Department.|$|R
2500|$|The {{designation}} [...] "1-Adam-12" [...] is {{a combination}} of three elements. The first element indicates the unit's LAPD division. The second element indicates the type of unit. The third element identifies the patrol car's number. The one in 1-Adam-12 means <b>the</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>car</b> operates in Division 1 (Central Division). LAPD assigns two-person units the letter [...] "A". [...] In the LAPD phonetic alphabet, the letter [...] "A" [...] is spoken as [...] "Adam". [...] The third element is the last two numbers of the patrol car's full unit number. [...] In the program, 1-Adam-12 typically operated in the Rampart Division, Division 2, not the Central Division, Division 1, meaning the unit's call sign should have technically been 2-Adam-12. There was never an actual patrol car with the call sign of 1-Adam-12.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of October 31, 2009, at {{approximately}} 10:00 pm Pacific Daylight Time (UTC-7), Brenton and his partner, trainee officer Britt Sweeney, were both sitting in their patrol car following a traffic stop at 29th Avenue South and East Yesler Way in the Central District. Sweeney {{was sitting in the}} driver's seat with Brenton in the passenger seat. As they were debriefing the traffic stop they had just performed, a vehicle pulled up alongside their police car and someone inside opened fire with a rifle. [...] Sweeney ducked, and a bullet grazed {{the top of her head}} and her back. Brenton, meanwhile, was mortally wounded in the attack. The suspect's vehicle reversed, turned around, and fled the scene in the direction from which it had come. As the vehicle was fleeing the scene, Sweeney managed to call for help, exit <b>the</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>car,</b> and return fire.|$|E
2500|$|According to Santa Rosa Police Lieutenant Paul Henry, two Sonoma County sheriff's deputies (Gelhaus and Michael Schemmel; Schemmel {{was driving}} <b>the</b> <b>patrol</b> <b>car)</b> were patrolling the Moorland Avenue {{neighborhood}} when they spotted Andy Lopez approximately [...] ahead carrying an airsoft replica of an AK-47 assault rifle {{while he was}} walking on Moorland, just past the corner of West Robles Avenue. The rifle {{appeared to be a}} real weapon, since it did not have the orange tip that is a legal requirement for all toy guns for import.§272.3 Approved markings.The following markings are approved by the Secretary of Commerce: }} However, airsoft and pellet rifles are exempted from the marking requirements.§272.1 Applicability.This part applies to toy, look-alike, and imitation firearms (“devices”) having the appearance, shape, and/or configuration of a firearm and produced or manufactured and entered into commerce on or after May 5, 1989, including devices modelled on real firearms manufactured, designed, and produced since 1898. This part does not apply to: }} As the sheriff's deputies approached the child from behind, Gelhaus radioed an observation of [...] "Code 20, two units" [...] at 3:13:58p.m. Schemmel activated the light bar and briefly sounded the siren as he parked the patrol vehicle, and Gelhaus exited the passenger's side, calling out to demand that Lopez drop the weapon. Lopez turned to his right, towards the deputies and the barrel allegedly began to ascend.|$|E
