5|$|After its release, Music Box {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics.

5|$|Blackout {{represents}} a musical departure from Spears' earlier work featuring a foreboding and atmospheric <b>tone</b> <b>in</b> terms of musical and lyrical direction. She collaborated with producers including Danja, Bloodshy & Avant, Sean Garrett, and The Neptunes in several recording studios around the United States, including Spears' home in Los Angeles, {{with the intention}} of creating uptempo, high-energy music. Their efforts resulted in a primarily dance-pop and electropop record, which sees additional influences from Euro disco, dubstep and funk. The lyrical themes revolve around love, fame, media scrutiny, sex, and clubbing.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{subsequent}} vowel loss many Mayan languages now show complex consonant clusters at {{both ends}} of syllables. Following the reconstruction of Lyle Campbell and Terrence Kaufman, the Proto-Mayan language had the following sounds.

5|$|Lilias Eveline Armstrong (29 September 1882– 9 December 1937) was an English phonetician. She {{worked at}} University College London, where she {{attained}} {{the rank of}} reader.

5|$|Myotis alcathoe is the {{smallest}} European Myotis species. The fur is brownish on the upperparts, with a reddish <b>tone</b> <b>in</b> old specimens, and a slightly paler gray-brown below. Younger animals may be completely gray-brown. The brown fur distinguishes adult M.alcathoe from other whiskered bats, but juveniles cannot be unambiguously identified {{on the basis of}} morphology. M.alcathoe is similar to Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii) and M.emarginatus in color. On the upper side of the body, the hairs are 6 to 8mm long and have dark bases and brown tips. The hairs on the lower side of the body are only slightly paler at the tip than at the base.|$|E

5|$|Traffic on the opened {{section was}} {{much lower than}} anticipated, and the {{prospects}} of building {{the rest of the}} canal dwindled, as profits were minimal. However, in 1829 James Green {{turned his attention to the}} link to Taunton. He had been the architect of the Bude Canal, which was built for tub-boats and used inclined planes to change levels, and proposed a similar solution here. The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal had opened in 1827, making navigation from Taunton to Bridgwater easier than on the River <b>Tone.</b> <b>In</b> a report of 1830, Green proposed using vertical lifts instead of inclined planes, and estimated the cost of the canal at £65,000.|$|E
5|$|Advance Wars: Days of Ruin was {{intended}} to have a darker atmosphere and more serious <b>tone</b> <b>in</b> contrast to the previous installments in the series, and features a new storyline independent of the previous games. Set amidst a post-apocalyptic world, the story focuses on the Rubinelle 12th Battalion, one of the surviving remnants of the military of the country of Rubinelle, which had been locked in a century-long war with its rival, Lazuria, prior to a devastating global meteor shower. In the aftermath, the Battalion devotes itself to saving any other survivors of the disaster, despite the shattered nations renewing their war against each other and an uncurable disease ravaging both sides. Meanwhile, a mysterious faction with unknown motives {{takes advantage of the}} destruction and pushes both sides deeper into conflict from behind the scenes.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the series}} {{shared the same}} mockumentary style as The Office, Daniels and Schur sought to {{establish}} a slightly different <b>tone</b> <b>in</b> the camerawork of the pilot episode of Parks and Recreation. For example, the documentary-style interviews with characters sometimes feature two separate angles on the same person, with footage of the two different angles intercut into a single scene for the final episode. This distinguishing technique was inspired by The Five Obstructions, a 2003 documentary by Lars von Trier and Jørgen Leth, which Daniels watched {{at the suggestion of}} actor Paul Schneider. The pilot episode also makes use of the jump cut technique more often than in The Office. In one example from the pilot episode, a scene repeatedly jumps cuts to several brief clips in which Leslie seeks permission from Ron to pursue the pit project.|$|E
5|$|Smashed was {{conceived}} by James Ponsoldt and Susan Burke {{after they had}} a conversation about things they had done while drunk. Some of the story's details were based on Burke's own experience; she was an alcoholic until she was 24 years old, when she started attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. Burke felt that her experiences with alcoholism had not been represented on film before, and so she decided to write about a young woman deciding to become sober. Burke and Ponsoldt discussed the story, characters and <b>tone</b> <b>in</b> detail before they began to write the script. Since they lived {{on opposite sides of}} the United States, they communicated by email, dividing the script into 15-page installments which they wrote alternately. The entire writing process took six months.|$|E
5|$|The {{next major}} {{development}} {{in the history of}} clarinet was the invention of the modern pad. Because early clarinets used felt pads to cover the tone holes, they leaked air. This required pad-covered holes to be kept to a minimum, restricting the number of notes the clarinet could play with good <b>tone.</b> <b>In</b> 1812, Iwan Müller, a Baltic German community-born clarinetist and inventor, developed a new type of pad that was covered in leather or fish bladder. It was airtight and let makers increase the number of pad-covered holes. Müller designed a new type of clarinet with seven finger holes and thirteen keys. This allowed the instrument to play in any key with near-equal ease. Over the course of the 19th-century makers made many enhancements to Müller's clarinet, such as the Albert system and the Baermann system, all keeping the same basic design. Modern instruments may also have cork or synthetic pads.|$|E
