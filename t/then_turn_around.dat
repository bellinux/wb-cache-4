25|$|Assistant Attorney General John Doar {{and former}} Florida Governor LeRoy Collins, {{representing}} President Lyndon Johnson, went to Selma {{to meet with}} King and others at Richie Jean Jackson's house and privately urged King to postpone the march. The SCLC president told them that his conscience demanded that he proceed, and that many movement supporters, especially in SNCC, would {{go ahead with the}} march even if he told them it should be called off. Collins suggested to King that he make a symbolic witness at the bridge, <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> and lead the marchers back to Selma. King told them that he would try to enact the plan provided that Collins could ensure that law enforcement would not attack them. Collins obtained this guarantee from Sheriff Clark and Al Lingo in exchange for a guarantee that King would follow a precise route drawn up by Clark.|$|E
25|$|Uniting with Van Dorn at Ripley, Mississippi on September 28, Price placed {{himself under}} Van Dorn's command. The Army of the West was redesignated Price's Corps, which with Mansfield Lovell's {{division}} from the District of the Mississippi, formed Van Dorn's Army of West Tennessee. (Lovell's division remained separate from Price's corps and reported directly to Van Dorn.) Van Dorn then informed Price of {{his plans to}} capture Corinth: first the Confederates would march to Pocahontas, northwest of Corinth, in order to confuse the Union high command, <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> and attack Corinth {{from the north and}} northwest. Although opposed to the plan, Price went along with it. During the two‑day Battle of Corinth, Price's corps did much of the fighting. On the first day, Price's troops drove the Union troops from their lines north of Corinth into their second line of fortifications; on the second, his divisions overran several parts of the Union line and briefly entered into Corinth but had to fall back due to lack of support. Hebert reported himself sick {{on the morning of the}} second day and was replaced by Brigadier General Martin E. Green; in addition, several field officers were killed or wounded during the battle. During both days, Lovell failed to fully support Price's attacks, which may have been due to his opposition to attacking Corinth at all.|$|E

500|$|Courses {{range from}} beaches with debris-littered water to swamps and ice-covered mountains. The game has its {{variant of the}} {{traditional}} race track, but also introduces a new course type known as a Suicide course. Instead of being a continuous loop, these tracks have checkpoints {{at either end of}} the course, and the starting grid in the center. [...] Riders race to one end, <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> to head for the other checkpoint, repeating the process until all laps are complete.

2500|$|LittleBigPlanet (2008) had {{a last-minute}} delay {{involving}} a licensed {{song in the}} game's soundtrack, after a PlayStation Community member reported the lyrics {{to one of the}} licensed songs in the game included passages from the Qur'an and could therefore be offensive to Muslims. However, no actual complaints regarding the music were made. The song, entitled [...] "Tapha Niang", was by Malian artist Toumani Diabaté, himself a devout Muslim. The game was patched twice, the day before its release for players who had received the game early, before its intended release date. The first update did not affect the song, whilst the second updated the game to remove the vocals from the track, leaving only an instrumental. Some American Muslims responded to the recall and stated that they were offended by the restriction of freedom of speech. M.

2500|$|The {{first player}} tosses the marker also called a [...] "lucky" [...] unto the court. This object should {{land in the}} square without bouncing, sliding, or rolling out. It is {{typically}} a small flat stone, coin, bean bag, or small chain with a charm. The marker must land completely within the square without touching the line. The player then hops through the course, skipping the square with the marker in it. Single squares must be hopped on one foot. For the first single square, either foot may be used. Side-by-side squares are straddled, with the left foot landing in the left square, and the right foot landing in the right square. Optional squares marked [...] "Safe", [...] "Home", or [...] "Rest" [...] are neutral squares, and may be hopped through in any manner without penalty. After hopping into [...] "Safe", [...] "Home", or [...] "Rest", the player must <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> and return through the course (square 9, then squares 8 and 7, next square 6, and so forth) {{on one or two}} legs depending on the square until reaching the square with the marker. The player stops in the square before the marker and reaches down to retrieve the marker and continue the course as stated, without touching a line or stepping into a square with another player's marker.|$|E
2500|$|The set of pronouns {{which forms}} the song's title is a {{conventional}} way of {{referring to the}} ego in a Hindu context. For example, the Bhagavad Gita 2:71-72 can be translated as [...] "They are forever free who renounce all selfish desires and {{break away from the}} ego-cage of 'I', 'me' and 'mine' to be united with the Lord. This is the supreme state. Attain to this, and pass from death to immortality." [...] Author Jonathan Gould claims that Harrison wrote [...] "I Me Mine" [...] "as a commentary on the selfishness" [...] of his Beatles bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney and considers it poignant that the song was only properly recorded because, during the group's filmed rehearsals at Twickenham Film Studios in January 1969, it had provided accompaniment to Lennon and his partner Yoko Ono dancing. Gould writes that Harrison was particularly upset at Twickenham [...] "that his fellow Beatles could complain about the amount of time they had to spend learning the arrangement for 'I Me Mine' and <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> and submit to a laborious rehearsal of a song like 'Maxwell's Silver Hammer' which struck George as a paragon of pop inanity." [...] Gould contends further that, if [...] "friends like Bob Dylan and Eric Clapton heard something worthwhile in material like [...] 'All Things Must Pass'" [...] then only [...] "sheer egotism could account for the air of complete indifference with which Lennon and McCartney first greeted" [...] both that tune and [...] "I Me Mine".|$|E

2500|$|On March 11, 2016, HRC {{voted to}} endorse Republican US Senator Mark Kirk over his Democratic Party {{challenger}} Representative Tammy Duckworth in his re-election bid to the US Senate. [...] The endorsement {{was met with}} widespread surprise and criticism in news media and social media as HRC had given Kirk a score of 78 percent out of 100 percent on LGBT issues, while HRC awarded Duckworth a score of 100 percent. David Nir at Daily Kos called the endorsement as [...] "appalling as it is embarrassing" [...] and [...] "pathetic and stupid", while Slate observed that Democrat control of the Senate was effectively necessary for passing the Equality Act of 2015 and beneficial for many other LGBT equality issues, and thus {{it would be in}} line with the organization's stated goals for Duckworth to be elected rather than Kirk. Meanwhile, The New Republic stated that, in light of a recent internal report revealing HRC's [...] "serious diversity problem", [...] "Choosing the white male candidate in this race over the Asian-American female candidate—someone who happens to have a better voting record anyway—is probably the worst way of convincing your detractors that you are taking a core problem seriously." [...] HRC president Chad Griffin defended the endorsement in a column published by the Independent Journal Review, describing the senator's work on behalf of LGBT equality issues including co-sponsoring the Equality Act of 2015. Griffin stated: [...] "The truth is we need more cross party cooperation on issues of equality, not less", adding [...] "when members of Congress vote the right way and stand up for equality — regardless of party — we must stand with them. We simply cannot ask members of Congress to vote with us, and <b>then</b> <b>turn</b> <b>around</b> and try to kick them out of office." ...|$|E
