5|$|Lee was {{appointed}} commissioner, along with William Beverley, <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Six Nations of the Iroquois at the Treaty of Lancaster in 1744. At the treaty, an agreement {{was made with}} the Six Nations for 400 pounds (equal to £ today) {{in return for the}} right for Virginians to travel through and settle in the Shenandoah Valley.|$|E
5|$|Peruvian viceroy Joaquín de la Pezuela had {{instructions}} from Spain <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> patriots. Under an armistice the opponents celebrated {{a meeting in}} Miraflores. The viceroy's deputies proposed to adopt the liberal Spanish constitution if San Martín left the country, but his deputies requested instead that Spain grant the independence of Peru. The negotiations did not bear fruit.|$|E
5|$|The crusaders had {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Fatimids during their march to Jerusalem, {{but to no}} avail. After the crusaders captured Jerusalem from the Fatimids, they learned of a Fatimid army about to attack them. On 10 August Godfrey of Bouillon led the remaining troops from Jerusalem to Ascalon, a day's march away.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>negotiating</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Cree, MacDonald of the Mounted rescues white hostages (Robert Horton and Penny Edwards) arrests a murderer, and {{adopts a}} Cree son (Anthony Earl Numkena).|$|R
50|$|The, Conservative MP for North East Hertfordshire, Oliver Heald, {{who sits}} on the government’s’ Work and Pensions Select Committee, told the local media that he thought the Coalition was still open <b>to</b> <b>negotiating</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> union on all issues.|$|R
25|$|At war's end, {{he gave up}} the Exchequer for {{the less}} {{demanding}} sinecure office of Lord Privy Seal, but remained Leader of the Commons. In 1921, ill health forced his resignation as Conservative leader and Leader of the Commons in favour of Austen Chamberlain. His departure weakened the hardliners in the cabinet who were opposed <b>to</b> <b>negotiating</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Irish Republican Army, and the Anglo-Irish War ended in the summer.|$|R
5|$|A fierce {{defense was}} {{launched}} {{from within the}} walls, even as Bowie and Travis made unsuccessful attempts <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Mexican army. Travis repeatedly dispatched couriers with pleas for reinforcements. Although Santa Anna refused to consider a proposed conditional surrender, he extended an offer of amnesty for all Tejanos inside the fortress to walk away unharmed. Most Tejanos evacuated from the fortress about February 25, either {{as part of the}} amnesty, or as a part of Juan Seguín's company of courier scouts on their last run.|$|E
5|$|Politically, Leopold {{disliked the}} Socialist party, preferring <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Catholic Party, which held power {{for much of}} his reign. He was widely distrusted by politicians, who saw him as meddling in state {{business}} and seeking to expand the power of the monarchy. Towards the end of his reign, public awareness of the atrocities committed under his colonial regime, as well as his marital infidelity, led to a significant fall the monarchy's popularity. Following his death in December 1909, his funeral cortege was booed.|$|E
5|$|With various {{plans for}} using {{the route of the}} canal for {{landfill}} and for a bypass, some local interest was aroused regarding its future. The Tiverton Canal Preservation Committee was formed in 1962. This committee was stirred to action by plans in 1966 to infill parts of the canal so that housing could be built over it. Tiverton Borough Council gave the committee the power <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> British Waterways Board in March 1967, but the Board were unwilling to offer financial assistance.|$|E
25|$|Through the Japanese, Hitler learns {{about the}} results of the {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union and sends Ribbentrop <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> peace <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union.|$|R
5000|$|In 1985 he {{was sent}} back to London <b>to</b> again <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> print unions {{regarding}} Wapping. [...] These talks were unsuccessful and led to the 13-month-long Wapping dispute.|$|R
5000|$|The Public Enemy made a brief {{return to}} ECW at the House Party '99 show on January 16, 1999, battling the Dudley Boys to a double countout. [...] Their next {{scheduled}} appearance was at Crossing the Line '99 on February 12 in Queens, New York against the Dudleys, which they cancelled due <b>to</b> <b>negotiating</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> WWF. The team was buried on the February 20 edition of ECW Hardcore TV as being cowards who ran from a fight. Footage of the Dudleys hitting big moves {{on the team}} at an event in Detroit was shown, with a headline stating [...] "Breaking News: The Dudleys Destroy Public Enemy." [...] Two days later, the team would make their WWF debut.|$|R
5|$|After {{his tenure}} in Congress, Rowan {{was elected to}} {{represent}} Nelson County in the Kentucky House of Representatives from 1813 to 1817. In 1817, the House debated a resolution instructing Governor Gabriel Slaughter <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> governors of Indiana and Ohio to secure passage of legislation requiring citizens of those states to return fugitive slaves. Representative James G. Birney vigorously opposed the resolution, and it was defeated. The pro-slavery members of the House then rallied behind Rowan's leadership to pass a substitute resolution which softened the most objectionable language but retained the call for fugitive slave legislation in Indiana and Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Another one-party cabinet was {{announced}} in January 1992, which prompted large scale protests in Kigali, and finally forced Habyarimana to make real concessions. He promised {{for the first time}} <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> RPF; a multiparty cabinet formed in April, still dominated by the MRND, but with opposition figures in some key positions. The opposition members of this cabinet met with the RPF, and were successful in negotiating a ceasefire. In July 1992 the rebels agreed to stop fighting, and the parties began a peace negotiation process headquartered in the Tanzanian city of Arusha.|$|E
5|$|Isolated {{inside the}} Tower, the royal {{government}} {{was in a}} state of shock at the turn of events. The King left the castle that morning and made his way <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rebels at Mile End in east London, taking only a very small bodyguard with him. The King left Sudbury and Hales behind in the Tower, either for their own safety or because Richard had decided it would be safer to distance himself from his unpopular ministers. Along the way, several Londoners accosted the King to complain about alleged injustices.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, general {{practitioners}} (GPs) were joining {{together to form}} independent practitioner associations (IPAs). They did this <b>to</b> better <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> purchasers of healthcare at that time.|$|R
5000|$|By 30 September 1985, {{four and}} a half years into the Reagan {{administration}} and shortly after Stockman's resignation from the OMB during August 1985, the gross federal debt was $1.8 trillion. Stockman's OMB work within the administration during 1981 until August 1985 was dedicated <b>to</b> <b>negotiating</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Senate and House about the next fiscal year's budget, executed later during the autumn of 1985, which resulted in the national debt becoming $2.1 trillion at fiscal year end 30 September 1986. [...] Reaganomics had just begun.|$|R

5|$|Nolan {{returned}} to the British forces to join the Light Division at Devna as aide-de-camp to Airey. The Royal Navy had control over the Black Sea, and with a Russian treaty with Turkey and Austria, the enemy forces were withdrawing from Eastern Europe. Despite this favourable outcome, the British government wished <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Russians from a strong position. The decision was taken to invade the Crimea itself, {{with the objective of}} destroying or capturing the Russian naval base at Sevastopol. Raglan personally considered this unrealistic – British forces knew little about the region, the port's defences, or the strength of the Russian military, with estimates of troop numbers varying between 45,000 and 140,000. It was also quite a distance away, causing logistical difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the Persians in Syria was not strong; {{although}} the locals constructed fortifications, they generally tried <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Persians. The cities of Damascus, Apamea, and Emesa fell quickly in 613, giving the Sasanian army {{a chance to}} strike further south into Palaestina Prima. Nicetas continued to resist the Persians but was defeated at Adhri'at. He managed to win a small victory near Emesa, however, where both sides suffered heavy casualties—the total death count was 20,000. More seriously, {{the weakness of the}} resistance enabled the Persians and their Jewish allies to capture Jerusalem following a three weeks siege. Ancient sources claim 57,000 or 66,500 people were slain there; another 35,000 were deported to Persia, including the Patriarch Zacharias.|$|E
5|$|Speidel {{met with}} former foreign {{minister}} Konstantin von Neurath and Strölin on 27 May in Germany, ostensibly at Rommel's request, although {{the latter was}} not present. Neurath and Strölin suggested opening immediate surrender negotiations with the West, and, according to Speidel, Rommel agreed to further discussions and preparations. However, {{around the same time}} the plotters in Berlin were not aware that Rommel had reportedly decided {{to take part in the}} conspiracy. On 16 May, they informed Allen Dulles, through whom they hoped <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Western Allies, that Rommel could not be counted on for support.|$|E
50|$|Offering net {{metering}} {{is required by}} federal law, but Mississippi {{is one of only}} four states to not have adopted a statewide policy on {{net metering}}, which means it needs <b>to</b> be <b>negotiated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> utility.|$|R
5000|$|James Glynn (1800 - 1871) was a U.S. Navy {{officer who}} in 1848 {{distinguished}} himself {{by being the}} first American <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> successfully <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Japanese during the [...] "Closed Country" [...] period.|$|R

5|$|The Belgian Revolution {{broke out}} on 25 August 1830, after the {{performance}} of a nationalist opera (La muette de Portici) in Brussels led to a minor insurrection among the capital's bourgeoisie, who sang patriotic songs and captured some public buildings in the city. This early revolutionary group was swelled by a large number of urban workers. The following day, the revolutionaries began flying their own flag, clearly influenced by that of the Brabant Revolution of 1789. To maintain order, several bourgeois militia groups were formed. The situation in Brussels led to widespread unrest across the country. William I rejected his son's advice <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rebels, forcing them towards a more radical, pro-independence stance, and sent a large military force to Brussels suppress the insurrection.|$|E
5|$|The Danish statesman Hannibal Sehested was {{instructed}} by Frederick III <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Swedes, {{and the resulting}} peace treaty can largely be credited to him. Without any direct involvement by foreign powers, the Danes and Swedes managed to negotiate the Treaty of Copenhagen within weeks, much {{to the surprise of}} both parties. A bone of contention was the islands of Hven and Bornholm, the latter having received the Danish king's personal promise of protection. In the end, Bornholm remained under Danish control in exchange for a number of estates in the south of present-day Sweden.|$|E
5|$|The Viking {{invasions of}} the 8th and 9th centuries reintroduced paganism to North-East England, leading {{in turn to}} another wave of conversion. Indigenous Scandinavian beliefs were very similar to other Germanic groups, with a pantheon of gods {{including}} Odin, Thor and Ullr, combined with a belief in a final, apocalyptic battle called Ragnarok. The Norse settlers in England were converted relatively quickly, assimilating their beliefs into Christianity in the decades following the occupation of York, which the Archbishop had survived. The process was largely complete by the early 10th century and enabled England's leading Churchmen <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> warlords. As the Norse in mainland Scandinavia started to convert, many mainland rulers recruited missionaries from England {{to assist in the}} process.|$|E
50|$|Al Gosaibi {{began his}} career working as a {{lecturer}} at King Saud University in 1965. He held various positions, including associate professor, dean of the faculty of commerce {{and head of the}} department of political science. In 1965, he served as a legal consultant to the Saudi reconciliation committee; the job was related <b>to</b> <b>negotiating</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Egyptian forces in Yemen. He also served as the director general of Saudi Railways Organization in 1970, chairman of Jubail Petrochemical Company (Sadaf) and Yanbu Petrochemical Company (Yanpet), member on Public Investment Fund, Supreme Manpower Council, and Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu.|$|R
50|$|The US {{claimed that}} the {{operation}} had succeeded in forcing North Vietnam's Politburo <b>to</b> return <b>to</b> <b>negotiating,</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Paris Peace Accords signed shortly after the operation. Also, sources indicated that when South Vietnam's President Nguyen Van Thieu objected to the terms, Nixon threatened that he might follow the footsteps of Ngo Dinh Diem (implying that Thieu might also find himself deposed by a military coup). Also, while the bombing did severe infrastructure damage in Northern Vietnam, it did not break the stalemate in the South, nor did it halt the flow of supplies down the Ho Chi Minh trail.|$|R

5|$|The {{government}} sponsored numerous {{initiatives aimed}} at improving conditions or achieving repatriation. At {{the request of the}} Vichy government, Georges Scapini, a deputy and World War I veteran, was appointed to lead a committee to monitor the treatment of French prisoners in Germany. Scapini's Service Diplomatique des Prisonniers de Guerre (Diplomatic Service of Prisoners of War; SDPG) was given responsibility <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> German authorities in all matters concerning prisoners of war. A government-backed national fund-raising campaign was run by the Secours National (National Aid) for the benefit of French prisoners. Among other activities, the Secours ran a week-long campaign nationally in 1941.|$|E
5|$|Thi {{demanded that}} Diệm appoint an officer as prime {{minister}} and that Diệm remove Madame Nhu from the palace. Saigon Radio broadcast a speech authorised by Thi's Revolutionary Council, claiming that Diệm was being removed because he was corrupt and suppressed liberty. Worried by the uprising, Diệm sent his private secretary Vo Van Hai <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> coup leaders. In the afternoon, Khanh left the palace to meet with rebel officers to keep abreast of their demands, which they reiterated. The rebels' negotiators were Đông and Major Nguyen Huy Loi. They wanted officers and opposition figures to be appointed to a new government to keep Diệm in check.|$|E
5|$|Turnbull's {{willingness}} <b>to</b> <b>negotiate</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> {{government was}} met with opposition from some Coalition MPs. By September 2009, The Australian was reporting that only 12 of the 59 Liberal backbenchers supported negotiations. On 18 October 2009, Turnbull fronted a meeting of Coalition MPs with a proposal to negotiate amendments to the government's ETS. This meeting supported his proposal, in what {{was seen as a}} test of Turnbull's leadership. However, there was speculation that a number of Coalition Senators would defy Turnbull and cross the floor of the Senate to vote against any ETS legislation. The ETS opponents argued that it would be premature for Parliament to pass ETS legislation before the Copenhagen Summit on climate change.|$|E
