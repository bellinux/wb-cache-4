40|$|The <b>transverse</b> <b>loading</b> {{requirement}} for stoppings as {{specified in the}} current Code of Federal Regulations is 39 psf. This measure is based on physical testing of a freestanding wall in accordance with ASTM E 72 specifications, where the dominant parameter is the tensile strength of the sealant. A new protocol based on arching has been developed to determine the true <b>transverse</b> <b>load</b> capacity of stoppings. Arching is achieved by the restraint of the stopping against the mine roof and floor, whereby compressive forces are developed within the wall. A laboratory procedure using the NIOSH Mine Roof Simulator (MRS) to simulate rigid-arching of stoppings was developed and verified through full-scale in-mine tests. Using this protocol, a systematic study of the design parameters that affect arching capability in block stoppings was conducted. The study included a theoretical assessment of arching and development of design formulations that can accurately define the <b>transverse</b> <b>load</b> capacity of various stopping constructions under various loading conditions.

40|$|The {{push-out}} test {{as proposed}} in EN 1994 - 1 - 1 originally {{was developed for}} solid slabs and not for composite slabs with additional steel sheeting. It leads to a load-slip behaviour of headed shear stud connectors which differs from the behaviour in the real beam. In particular, the vertical forces and negative bending moments of the composite slab at its support are ignored by this setup. Within the European research project “Development of improved shear connection rules in composite beams (DISCCO) ” a total of 70 push-out tests was performed to investigate a more realistic push-out test setup.

40|$|The {{buckling}} {{strength of a}} new cold-formed hollow flange channel section known as LiteSteel beam (LSB) is governed by lateral distortional buckling characterised by simultaneous lateral deflection, twist and web distortion for its intermediate spans. Recent research has developed a modified elastic lateral buckling moment equation to allow for lateral distortional buckling effects. However, it {{is limited to a}} uniform moment distribution condition that rarely exists in practice. <b>Transverse</b> <b>loading</b> introduces a non-uniform bending moment distribution, which is also often applied above or below the shear centre (load height). These loading conditions are known to have significant effects on the lateral {{buckling strength}} of beams. Many steel design codes have adopted equivalent uniform moment distribution and load height factors to allow for these effects. But they were derived mostly based on data for conventional hot-rolled, doubly symmetric I-beams subject to lateral torsional buckling. The moment distribution and load height effects of <b>transverse</b> <b>loading</b> for LSBs, and the suitability of the current design modification factors to accommodate these effects for LSBs is not known.

40|$|The present work {{introduces}} the boundary element method {{applied to the}} bending analysis of functionally graded plates. It is assumed that material properties are graded through the thickness direction of the plate according to a power law distribution.

A direct approach based on the Green's identity is used to formulate boundary element method. By introducing a novel approach, domain integrals which arise from distributed <b>transverse</b> <b>loads</b> are transformed into boundary integrals.
