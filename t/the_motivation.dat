40|$|The {{study of}} the effects of {{institutions}} suffers from a potential endogeneity problem. This article proposes a strategy for addressing this problem by estimating <b>the</b> <b>motivations</b> for institutional choice directly. It identifies <b>the</b> <b>motivations</b> behind <b>the</b> wording of post-independence constitutions in Francophone sub-Saharan Africa. We find that constitutional wording in these countries has been motivated by the strength of ties with France. However, contrary to standard narratives, domestic political preferences have also been influential. By estimating <b>the</b> <b>motivations</b> for institutional choice directly, we are better placed to draw conclusions about the independent effect of institutions in this region...|$|R

If heterozygosity is maintained or increased as a result, hybrid vigour and other production benefits {{occurring in the}} F1 generation will be maintained or increased. Maintenance of heterozygosity {{is the key to}} maintaining the highest levels of hybrid vigour. This requires complex breeding programmes and high levels of management. Simplified crossbreeding programmes have been developed using hybrid or composite bulls, which was <b>the</b> <b>motivation</b> behind the development of Lim-Flex hybrids.|$|E

Charges were made that Old Court supporters had instigated the murder. Crittenden tried to blunt these charges by introducing a resolution condemning Sharp's murder and offering $3,000 for the murderer's capture. When assassin Jereboam O. Beauchamp was apprehended, it became clear that <b>the</b> <b>motivation</b> for the killing was personal, not political. (Beauchamp's wife had married him on the condition that he kill Sharp, who had refused to claim the child he had fathered with her previously.) Despite this, Crittenden refused a request to represent Beauchamp in his murder trial because he wanted to avoid any implication in the matter.|$|E
5|$|Journal The Library Quarterly {{published}} an article by Eliza T. Dresang which classed Not in Front of the Children as an effective treatise on the harmful to minors doctrine. Dresang wrote that Heins had successfully shown that this doctrine, which served as the core basis for legislation including the Children's Internet Protection Act (CIPA), was demonstrably impossible to prove. She concluded that Heins concisely argued censorship of works from the reach of children can have negative impacts on their level of innovation, healthy mental growth, and adaptive abilities. Writing in English Journal, Tonya Perry discussed the work and emphasized that if <b>the</b> <b>motivation</b> behind children's education was to produce independent critical thinkers, {{it was necessary to}} extend the limits of censorship.|$|E

Avalon Production launched the album in Macedonia, while Croatian label Dallas Records released it throughout former Yugoslav countries in April 2015. The album consists of eight original songs written by Valentin Soklevski and Vesna Malinova; the arrangement and production were completed by Nikola Micevski and Dejan Momirovski.

For Gočeva, <b>the</b> <b>motivation</b> to record the album came from the critical and commercial success of her previous project inspired by the Macedonian traditional music, Makedonsko Devojče (2008).|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} few months, RhAR patrols in the Chaah, Labis, Bekok and Sungai Karas areas were stepped up to last between 10 and 18 days each, but {{contacts}} with the communist forces remained rare. The constant patrols gradually began to take their toll on the insurgents, and guerrillas began to give themselves up increasingly frequently. A contributing factor here was Britain's granting of independence to Malaya within the Commonwealth on 31 August 1957, which dented <b>the</b> <b>motivation</b> of many fighters. Starting in October 1957, the RhAR were tasked to work alongside former MNLA personnel to wipe out any remaining communist forces in the region. The ex-insurgents were supposed to lead the security forces to MNLA camps and resting places, but this strategy was not successful. The RhAR soon developed a low opinion of these ex-MNLA men.|$|E

Seth Shostak, an astronomer at the SETI Institute, disagrees, stating that the finite quantity of resources in the galaxy would cultivate aggression in any intelligent species, and that an explorer civilization that would want to contact humanity would be aggressive. Similarly, Ragbir Bhathal claims that since the laws of evolution would be the same on another habitable planet as they are on Earth, an extremely advanced extraterrestrial civilization may have <b>the</b> <b>motivation</b> to colonize humanity, much as British colonizers did to the aboriginal peoples of Australia.|$|E
