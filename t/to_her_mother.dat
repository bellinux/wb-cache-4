5|$|Jelena Balšić {{was praised}} as an {{extraordinary}} woman who preserved {{the power of}} the Balšić family during a very turbulent period.

Despite how <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> had bade <b>her</b> never <b>to</b> return to that island and to never associate herself with Hotaruko, Ryo nonetheless feels that something {{should be done in}} order <b>to</b> explain <b>her</b> <b>mother's</b> eccentric sexual behavior and what caused <b>her</b> <b>to</b> act so oddly. However, what Ryo never counted on was that the island contained a dark carnal cult that lured unsuspecting woman for blood sacrifice, seduced them to their highest points of ecstasy and then brutally slew them in blood as an offering to their god; Master Mizuno.|$|R

5|$|The Greek poet Stasinos {{mentioned}} {{them in the}} Cypria {{amongst the}} flowers of Cyprus. The legend of Persephone comes to us mainly {{in the seventh century}} BC Homeric Hymn To Demeter, where the author describes the narcissus, and its role as a lure to trap the young Persephone. The flower, she recounts <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> was the last flower she reached for before being seized.|$|E
5|$|The Paisley witches, {{also known}} as the Bargarran witches or the Renfrewshire witches, were tried in Paisley, Renfrewshire, central Scotland, in 1697. Eleven-year-old Christian Shaw, {{daughter}} of the Laird of Bargarran, complained of being tormented by some local witches; they included one of her family's servants, Catherine Campbell, whom she had reported <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> after witnessing her steal a drink of milk.|$|E
5|$|Another {{theory is}} that Madeleine, nearly four at the time, left the {{apartment}} by herself, perhaps to look for her parents, and was abducted by a passer-by or fell {{into one of the}} open construction sites nearby. This is widely regarded as unlikely. According <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> Madeleine would have had to open the unlocked patio doors, close the curtains behind her, close the door again, open and close the child gate {{at the top of the}} stairs, then open and close the gate leading to the street.|$|E

5|$|Before her marriage, Louise {{served as}} an {{unofficial}} secretary <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother,</b> the Queen (1866–1871). The question of Louise's marriage was discussed in the late 1860s. Suitors from the royal houses of Prussia and Denmark were suggested, but Victoria wanted new blood {{in the family and}} therefore suggested a high-ranking member of the aristocracy. Despite opposition from members of the royal family, Louise fell in love with John, Marquess of Lorne, the heir to the Duke of Argyll. Victoria consented to the marriage, which took place on 21 March 1871. Despite a happy beginning, the two drifted apart, possibly because of their childlessness and the Queen's constraints on their activities.|$|E
5|$|Copeland {{returned}} to her mother's home and frequent arguments. Her mother had long resented the Bradleys' influence and soon decided that Copeland would cease study with the Bradleys. Copeland was distraught with fear {{that she would not}} be able to dance. She had heard the term emancipation while in San Francisco; the procedure was common among young performers to secure their financial and residential independence. The Bradleys introduced Copeland to Steven Bartell, a lawyer who explained the emancipation petition process. The Bradleys encouraged her to be absent from home when the emancipation petition was delivered <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother.</b> Copeland ran away from home for three days and stayed with a friend, while Bartell filed the emancipation papers. After her mother reported Copeland missing, she was told about the emancipation petition. Three days after running away, Copeland was returned <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> by the police. DelaCerna engaged lawyer Gloria Allred and applied for a series of restraining orders, which included the Bradleys' five-year-old son, who had been Copeland's roommate, and Bartell. The order was partly intended to preclude contact between the Bradleys and Copeland, but it did not have proper legal basis, since there had been no stalking and no harassment.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth finally {{decides to}} reveal her {{pregnancy}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> Françoise, who, to Elizabeth's surprise, is supportive. Over dinner, she learns her mother was raised by Stephen and Jeanne, who married and settled in Norfolk after Elizabeth's grandmother Isabelle's premature death due to the postwar influenza epidemic. Elizabeth and the still-married Robert go on holiday to Dorset, where she goes into labour and has a son, naming him John (after Jack Firebrace's late son). The book ends with Robert walking down the garden of the holiday cottage and having an immense sense of joy.|$|E

5|$|The demands made on Beatrice during <b>her</b> <b>mother's</b> reign were high.

Beatrice's piano playing suffered as her rheumatism got gradually worse, eliminating an enjoyment {{in which she}} excelled; however, this did not change <b>her</b> willingness <b>to</b> cater <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother's</b> needs. <b>Her</b> effort did not go unnoticed by the British public.|$|R
