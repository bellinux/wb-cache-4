5|$|At a {{memorial}} service held on 8 September 1978 for Flight 825's passengers and crew at Salisbury's Anglican Cathedral, about 2,000 people crowded inside, with another 500 standing outside on <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> pavement, many listening to the service inside on portable radio sets. Prominent among those present in the cathedral were uniformed Air Rhodesia and South African Airways personnel, as well as Rhodesian Special Air Service soldiers and senior officers from other military units. Smith and several government ministers also attended, including PK van der Byl, the co-Minister of Foreign Affairs.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, {{the celebration}} of 200 years since {{the arrival of the}} First Fleet was {{organised}} on a large scale, with many significant events taking place in all major cities. Over 2.5million people attended the event in Sydney. These included street parties, concerts, including performances on <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> forecourt of the Sydney Opera House and at many other public venues, art and literary competitions, historic re-enactments, and the opening of the Powerhouse Museum at its new location. A re-enactment of the arrival of the First Fleet took place in Sydney Harbour, with ships that had sailed from Portsmouth a year earlier taking part.|$|E
5|$|From {{the end of}} the pool, steps lead down to {{a smaller}} {{rectangular}} pool at right-angles to the first. <b>The</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> the retaining wall at {{the end of the}} terrace are listed at GradeII. The retaining walls of the pool are also listed at GradeII. This area contains two statues by Jonathan Kenworthy. From this pool a path, known as the Broad Walk, stretches to the north and the south. At each end of the Broad Walk is a building designed by Waterhouse for the 3rdMarquess. At the north end is the Parrot House, dating from 1881–83, which is built in yellow terracotta. It is the form of a round colonnaded Ionic temple with a shallow domed roof. Above the colonnade and the inner drum are concentric balustrades. A flight of eleven steps leads up to the south entrance. The Parrot House is listed at GradeII. At the south end of the Broad Walk is a loggia, dating from about 1880. This is built in buff and red sandstone. At its front are three arches between Ionic columns. The loggia was built to enclose a Roman altar which was found in 1821 at a spring near Boughton and brought to Eaton in 1822. The loggia is listed at GradeII. To the east and west of the loggia are reconstructed Roman columns, each of which is listed at GradeII.|$|E

5|$|To {{reach the}} chapel's ceiling, Michelangelo {{designed}} his own scaffold, a flat wooden platform on brackets built out from {{holes in the}} wall {{near the top of}} the windows, rather than being built up from the floor. Mancinelli speculates that this was in order to cut the cost of timber. According to Michelangelo's pupil and biographer Ascanio Condivi, the brackets and frame that supported <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> flooring were all put in place at the beginning of the work and a lightweight screen, possibly cloth, was suspended beneath them to catch plaster drips, dust, and splashes of paint. Only half the building was scaffolded at a time and the platform was moved as the painting was done in stages. The areas of the wall covered by the scaffolding still appear as unpainted areas across the bottom of the lunettes. The holes were re-used to hold scaffolding in the latest restoration.|$|E

The other three escaped uninjured.|$|E
25|$|Fariborz Sahba {{began work}} in 1987 {{designing}} the gardens and oversaw construction. The terraces were {{opened to the}} public in June 2001.

25|$|After curfew one night, two Police constables saw a very drunk German soldier {{staggering}} through town, a quick shove {{sent him}} flying {{down a steep}} flight of granite steps. The Police reported a drunk soldier lying on <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> after an ambulance had taken him away, the Policemen were given some cigarettes from a grateful German for helping their comrade.

25|$|Another {{commemorative}} {{monument to}} La Fontaine {{was set up}} {{at the head of}} the Parisian Jardin du Ranelagh in 1891. The bronze bust designed by Achille Dumilâtre was exhibited at the Exposition Universelle (1889) before being placed on a high stone pedestal surrounded by various figures from the fables. The work was melted down, like many others during World War II, but was replaced in 1983 by Charles Correia’s standing statue of the fabulist looking down at the fox and the crow on <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> plinth below him.|$|E
25|$|The Municipals charged {{out of the}} building, and {{for over}} a half-hour, the rival forces fought on <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> in the {{corridors}} of City Hall. The Metropolitans were eventually forced from the building in a disorganized retreat. During the riot, 53 men were injured, including one officer from the Seventeenth Precinct, Patrolman Crofut, whose injuries resulted in his becoming an invalid. The wounded Metropolitans were brought to the office of Recorder James M. Smith and treated, while Mayor Wood and his supporters celebrated their victory in his private office.|$|E

25|$|Between 1936 and 1940, the vicar and Brotherhood of Santa Cruz dos Passos, {{informed}} {{the public of}} the necessity of completing restoration work on the church and its annexes, due to water infiltration, that was ruining the coverings, corners, stucco and wood frames. The groups solicited the DGEMN Direcção-Geral de Edifícios e Monumentos Nacionais (General-Directorate for Buildings and National Monuments) {{in order to make the}} necessary repairs; the DGEMN first intervened in 1938, with the repair of the gutter and the raising of the front walkway to the church. This was followed in 1942 by the repair of <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> railings to the altars; the replacement of the wood floors, stone and tiles; the cleaning of the building's exterior stonework; and plastering joints.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{performing}} tasks {{favorable to}} one of the four nations in the game and thus being promoted enough, the player may be given the chance to dance with a governor's daughter at a ball. Dancing is done by following the daughter's hand signals (left, right, back, forward, spin left, spin right) and moving appropriately. Successful dancing is rewarded with 'amour' from the governor's daughters, as well as gifts or valuable information. With the purchase of dancing shoes from the tavern merchant, the player is more nimble on his toes. When the daughter's 'amour' is high enough, she will request items such as a diamond necklace or ruby ring (purchased from the mysterious stranger at the tavern) or notify the hero that someone seeks to fight a duel over her. In the final step, the daughter is abducted, and the hero must track down the abductor aboard his ship and defeat him. Upon returning the daughter to her home city and the hero subsequently agreeing to marry her, the game will show a cutscene of the marriage, and the hero will gain bonus fame points. The more attractive the daughter (plain, attractive, beautiful), the more difficult the sequence of moves required during a dance, and the more fame points she is worth upon marriage. The difficulty level selected also affects the complexity of <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> <b>and</b> introduces new and more demanding musical scores.|$|E

25|$|For {{the making}} of the pyramid itself there passed a period of 20years; and the pyramid is square, each side {{measuring}} 800feet, and the height of it is the same. It is built of stone smoothed and fitted together in the most perfect manner, not one of the stones being less than 30feet in length. This pyramid was made after the manner of steps, which some call 'rows' and others 'bases': When they had first made it thus, they raised the remaining stones with devices made of short pieces of timber, lifting them first from the ground to the first stage of <b>the</b> <b>steps,</b> <b>and</b> when the stone got up to this it was placed upon another machine standing on the first stage, and so from this it was drawn to the second upon another machine; for as many as were the courses of the steps, so many machines there were also, or perhaps they transferred one and the same machine, made so as easily to be carried, to each stage successively, in order that they might take up the stones; for let it be told in both ways, according as it is reported. However, that may be, the highest parts of it were finished first, and afterwards they proceeded to finish that which came next to them, and lastly they finished the parts of it near the ground and the lowest ranges.|$|E

500|$|Since its {{dedication}} in 1934, the Shrine {{has been}} the centre of war commemoration in Melbourne.
