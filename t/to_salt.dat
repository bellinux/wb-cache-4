5|$|In 1856, {{the church}} inaugurated {{a system of}} {{handcart}} companies in order to enable poor European emigrants to make the trek more cheaply. Handcarts, two-wheeled carts that were pulled by emigrants instead of draft animals, were sometimes used as an alternate means of transportation from 1856 to 1860. They were seen as a faster, easier, and cheaper way to bring European converts <b>to</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake City. Almost 3,000 Mormons, with 653 carts and 50 supply wagons, traveling in 10 different companies, made the trip over the trail <b>to</b> <b>Salt</b> Lake City.

5|$|Sodium ferrocyanide, {{also known}} as yellow prussiate of soda, is {{sometimes}} added <b>to</b> <b>salt</b> as an anticaking agent. The additive is considered safe for human consumption. Such anti-caking agents have been added since at least 1911 when magnesium carbonate was first added <b>to</b> <b>salt</b> to make it flow more freely. The safety of sodium ferrocyanide as a food additive {{was found to be}} provisionally acceptable by the Committee on Toxicity in 1988. Other anticaking agents sometimes used include tricalcium phosphate, calcium or magnesium carbonates, fatty acid salts (acid salts), magnesium oxide, silicon dioxide, calcium silicate, sodium aluminosilicate and calcium aluminosilicate. Both the European Union and the United States Food and Drug Administration permitted the use of aluminium in the latter two compounds.|$|E

5|$|Cannon {{recovered}} from the sea are often extensively damaged from exposure <b>to</b> <b>salt</b> water; because of this, electrolytic reduction treatment is required to forestall the process of corrosion. The cannon is then washed in deionized water to remove the electrolyte, and is treated in tannic acid, which prevents further rust and gives the metal a bluish-black colour. After this process, cannons on display may be protected from oxygen and moisture by a wax sealant. A coat of polyurethane may also be painted over the wax sealant, to prevent the wax-coated cannon from attracting dust in outdoor displays.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{significant}} value of tests used to certify {{the diagnosis of}} occupational asthma due <b>to</b> persulphate <b>salts</b> remains uncertain. Aims: To validate the specific inhalation challenge (SIC) test for the diagnosis of occupational asthma. Methods: Eight patients with occupational asthma due <b>to</b> persulphate <b>salts,</b> eight patients with bronchial asthma who were never exposed <b>to</b> persulphate <b>salts,</b> and ten healthy subjects were studied. Clinical history taking, spirometry, bronchial challenge with methacholine, skin prick testing to common inhalant allergens and persulphate salts, total IgE levels, and SIC to potassium persulphate were carried out in all subjects. The SIC used increasing concentrations of potassium persulphate (5, 10, 15, and 30 g) mixed with 150 g of lactose. Patients tipped the mixture from one tray to another {{at a distance of}} 30 cm from the face for 10 minutes in a challenge booth. Results: The SIC was positive in all subjects with persulphate induced asthma and in one patient with bronchial asthma who had never been exposed <b>to</b> persulphate <b>salts.</b> Sensitivity was 100 % (95 % CI 67. 6 to 100) and specificity was 87. 5 % (95 % CI 52. 9 â€“ 97. 8) when patients with occupational asthma due <b>to</b> persulphate <b>salts</b> were compared with those with bronchial asthma never exposed <b>to</b> persulphate <b>salts.</b> Conclusions: SIC <b>to</b> persulphate <b>salts</b> performed according <b>to</b> the protocol described appears to be usefu...|$|R

40|$|WHEN the {{mammalian}} {{red cell}} {{is put in}} a hypotonic solution, it undergoes an increase in volume accompanied by changes in shape. If the solution is sufficiently hypo-tonic, it swells until it reaches its "critical area " substantially {{the same as the}} area of the original biconcave disk (Ponder, 1937; Castle & Daland, 1937). The cell then haemolyses, losing salts and haemoglobin; the tonicity inside becomes equal to that of the surrounding fluid, but the haemoglobin concentrations inside and outside do not come into equilibrium, an excess of pigment ("residual haemoglobin") re-maining inside. If the hypotonic system is restored to isotonicity by the addition of NaCl, "reversal of haemolysis " occurs. The almost transparent haemolysate be-comes opaque, and under certain circumstances the ghosts. can be centrifuged down at moderate-speeds.
