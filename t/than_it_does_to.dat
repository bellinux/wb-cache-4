5|$|Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is {{a protein}} that helps T {{cells of the}} immune system attack {{pathogens}} and tumors. Unfortunately, its use as a cancer treatment is restricted due to serious side effects such as pulmonary edema. IL-2 binds to these pulmonary cells differently <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>to</b> T cells, so IL-2 research involves understanding the differences between these binding mechanisms. In 2012, Folding@home assisted with the discovery of a form of IL-2 which is three hundred times more effective in its immune system role but carries fewer side effects. In experiments, this altered form significantly outperformed natural IL-2 in impeding tumor growth. Pharmaceutical companies have expressed interest in the mutant molecule, and the National Institutes of Health are testing it against a large variety of tumor models to try to accelerate its development as a therapeutic.|$|E

Correct accounting for this saved energy can be accomplished with life-cycle analysis using real energy values. In addition, exergy, which is a measure of useful energy can be used.

These include the rapper sword dance, the Clog dance and the Northumbrian smallpipe, a sweet chamber instrument, quite unlike the Scottish bagpipe. Northumberland {{also has its}} own tartan or check, sometimes referred to in Scotland as the Shepherd's Tartan. Traditional Northumberland music has more similarity to Lowland Scottish and Irish music <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>to</b> that of other parts of England, reflecting the strong historical links between Northumbria and the Lowlands of Scotland, and the large Irish population on Tyneside.|$|E
500|$|Many critics {{felt that}} the special effects overshadowed other {{elements}} of the film. Canby stated that the film [...] "owes more to [...] <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>to</b> the director, the writers or even the producer". Livingston felt that Trumbull and Dykstra's work on the film was not as impressive as on Star Wars and Close Encounters due to the limited amount of production time. Godfrey called the effects [...] "stunning", but conceded that they threatened to overpower the story two-thirds of the way into the film. Kroll, Martin, and Arnold agreed that the effects were not able to carry the film or gloss over its other deficiencies; [...] "I'm not sure that Trumbull & Co. have succeeded in pulling the philosophic chestnuts of Roddenberry and his co-writers out of the fire," [...] Arnold wrote.|$|E
500|$|Amarillo {{is located}} near {{the middle of the}} Texas Panhandle. It does not share similar weather {{characteristics}} with south and east Texas. Amarillo is situated in the grasslands of Northern Texas, and is surrounded by dense prairie. Though urbanization, agricultural farming, and construction have occurred over the last century in and around Amarillo, the native grasslands that dominate this region have remained largely untouched. Amarillo sits closer in proximity to the Oklahoma, New Mexico and Colorado state capitals <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>to</b> Austin. The region's surface is relatively flat and has little soil drainage. [...] Due to the lack of developed drainage, much of the rainfall either evaporates, infiltrates into the ground, or accumulates in playa lakes. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , with [...] of it land and [...] of it (0.50%) covered by water.

500|$|Ring Mountain, a flow-dominated tuya lying at the {{northern}} portion of the Mount Cayley volcanic field, consists of a pile of at least five andesite lava flows lying on a mountain ridge. Its steep-sided flanks reach heights of [...] and are composed of volcanic rubble. This {{makes it impossible to}} measure its exact base elevation or how many lava flows constitute the edifice. With a summit elevation of , Ring Mountain had its last volcanic activity between 25,000and 10,000years ago when the Fraser Glaciation was close to its maximum. Northwest of Ring Mountain lies a minor andesite lava flow. Its chemistry is somewhat unlike other andesite flows comprising Ring Mountain, but it probably erupted from a volcanic vent adjacent to or at Ring Mountain. The part of it that lies higher in elevation contains some features that indicate lava-ice interactions, while the lower-elevation portion of it does not. Therefore, this minor lava flow was likely extruded after Ring Mountain formed but when glacial ice covered a broader area <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>to</b> this day, and that the lava flowed beyond the region in which glacial ice existed at that time.|$|E
500|$|Bizenghast {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. The September 2005 issue of Teen People listed Bizenghast as the Hot Book of the Month.

Coolstreak Cartoons's Leroy Douresseaux described the series as [...] "belong to a fantasy subgenre {{sometimes referred to as}} 'pop Gothic' and relying on atmosphere and looks. Critics praised the art of Bizenghast as detailed, but did not see it as manga-styled. Anime Jumps Chad Clayton called the series [...] "heavily steeped in the gothic tradition" [...] and commented that the series [...] "successfully develops an inventive visual style all its own. It seems to owe more to classical art, gothic comics, and even artists like Edward Gorey <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>to</b> manga." [...] Johanna Draper Carlson, a longtime reviewer for Publishers Weekly, found the art reminiscent [...] "of classic fantasy indy comics" [...] and noted [...] "stock elements" [...] in the story. Reviewers found Dinah's character design [...] "striking" [...] and with the potential to appeal to fans of the Gothic Lolita fashion. Criticism focused on the writing, [...] "uneven pacing", flat characters, and the varying quality of the art. Anime News Network's Zac Bertschy heavily criticized Bizenghast for the [...] "slightly modified generic monster-of-the-week cliché" [...] plot, one-dimensional characters, and art. David Welsh compared Bizenghast to [...] "a cosplay of a horror manga", and wrote: [...] "It’s got a handle on the cosmetics, but central elements of story and character are vague and underdeveloped." ...|$|E

Leila Cobo Hanlon from Miami Herald was positive, saying that the album [...] "retains Shakira's trademark sound — rock-laced pop melodies backed by acoustic guitars — as well as her deeply personal approach to music-making", but also noting that [...] "ironically, the album's only failures occur when it looks too closely at its predecessor". Sputnikmusic website gave a positive review saying [...] "¿Dónde Están Los Ladrones? is the gem of Shakira's discography, {{and one of the best}} Spanish pop releases of the past decade", although criticized its [...] "slight lack of variety". Franz Reynold from Latin Beat Magazine noted that [...] "while many of the cuts on this collection are definitely chart-bound, that is due more to the fact that she doesn't stray too far from the previous formula, <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>to</b> any hope that success provides room for expansion", but complimented tracks like [...] "Inevitable" [...] and [...] "Tú". Rubens Herbst from Brazilian newspaper [...] gave a mixed review, writing that the album was [...] "homogenous, well-produced and full of potential hits", but [...] "empty and forgettable, like every FM pop — and the fact of singing in Spanish doesn't take Shakira away from the label". In July 2017, the album ranked at number 95 on the list for the 150 greatest female albums of all time by the National Public Radio.|$|E

2500|$|The Energy Information Administration (EIA) {{states on}} its website that [...] "a paper mill uses 40 percent less energy to make paper from {{recycled}} paper <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>to</b> make paper from fresh lumber." [...] Some critics argue that it takes more energy to produce recycled products <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>does</b> <b>to</b> dispose of them in traditional landfill methods, since the curbside collection of recyclables often requires a second waste truck. However, recycling proponents point out that a second timber or logging truck is eliminated when paper is collected for recycling, so the net energy consumption is the same. An Emergy life-cycle analysis on recycling revealed that fly ash, aluminum, recycled concrete aggregate, recycled plastic, and steel yield higher efficiency ratios, whereas the recycling of lumber generates the lowest recycle benefit ratio. Hence, the specific nature of the recycling process, the methods used to analyse the process, and the products involved affect the energy savings budgets.|$|E
