40|$|Thin shell <b>torispherical</b> {{pressure}} vessel heads {{are known to}} exhibit complex elastic-plastic deformation and buckling behaviour under static pressure. In {{pressure vessel}} Design by Analysis, the designer is required to assess both of these behaviour modes when specifying the allowable static load. The EN and ASME boiler and pressure vessel codes {{permit the use of}} inelastic analysis in design by analysis, known as the direct route in the EN Code. In this paper, plastic collapse or gross plastic deformation loads are evaluated for two sample <b>torispherical</b> heads by 2 D and 3 D FEA based on an elastic-perfectly plastic material model. Small and large deformation effects are considered in the 2 D analyses and the effect of geometry and load perturbation are considered in the 3 D analysis. The plastic load is determined by applying the ASME twice elastic slope criterion of plastic collapse and an alternative plastic criterion, the Plastic Work Curvature criterion. The formation of the gross plastic deformation mechanism in the models is considered in relation to the elastic-plastic buckling response of the vessels. It is concluded that in both cases, design is limited by formation of an axisymmetric gross plastic deformation in the knuckle of the vessels prior to formation of non-axisymmetric buckling modes...|$|E

40|$|The gross plastic {{deformation}} and associated plastic loads of four axisymmetric <b>torispherical</b> pressure vessels {{are determined by}} two criteria of plastic collapse: the ASME twice elastic slope (TES) criterion and the recently proposed plastic work curvature (PWC) criterion. Finite element analysis was performed assuming small and large deformation theory and elastic–perfectly plastic and bilinear kinematic hardening material models. Two plastic collapse modes are identified: bending-dominated plastic collapse of the knuckle region in small deformation models and membrane-dominated plastic collapse of the cylinder or domed end in large deformation models. In both circumstances, the PWC criterion indicates that a plastic hinge bending mechanism leads to gross {{plastic deformation}} and {{is used as a}} parameter to identify the respective plastic loads.

40|$|This report {{presents}} a feasibility study on structural analysis of pressure-containing structures subject to external blast loads using finite element and volume simulation software. A {{basic understanding of}} the main factors influencing the results of such analyses was established in an earlier study. An extensive series of computations have now been performed {{and the results are}} presented and discussed in detail in this report. These involve a 3 -D simulation of a large steel vessel of hypothetical design containing pressurised water and subject to an explosive blast from a charge located directly underneath the lower <b>torispherical</b> end. The top is closed by a flat lid arrangement. The properties of the explosive material, the air and water environments and the vessel steel were taken from the literature. For the latter, elastic-plastic material properties at 20 °C have been considered. The vessel is located in a bunker and by using FSR boundary conditions the reflections of the pressure waves on the bunker walls are also considered. To provide a cross-check on the computational results, some simplified analyses were performed using engineering and empirical formulae to estimate the pressure loads need to produce yielding and failure of the vessel, {{as well as of the}} corresponding quantities of explosives that would be needed to produce sufficient shock wave pressures.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{external pressure}} tests {{carried out on}} machined steel <b>torispherical</b> domes, such as those used as end closures on cylinders. There were small axisymmetric regions at the poles of the shells, in which the local radius was greater than the nominal one (that is the domes had increased-radius geometric imperfections, or '$at ' spots, in them). The '$at ' areas were covered with CFRP (carbon Jibre reinforced plastic) and one {{aim of the tests}} was to see if the buckling strength of the reinforced imperfect domes could equal that of a similar, unreinforced, perfect dome. Two sizes of polarflattening were investigated. The agreement between the experimental failure pressures and the theoretical predictions of the BOSOR 5 shell buckling program was good. The tests showed that the flattened dome's buckling resistance could indeed be restored (so that it equalled that of the perfect dome) by covering theJlattened area (and its environs) with CFRP. It was also shown that, by applying a somewhat thicker composite layer to the localizedjlat region, it was possible to achieve the same buckling resistance with glassfibre reinforced plastic (GFRP) as with CFRP.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study has been}} made of the behaviour of "very thin" <b>torispherical</b> ends subjected to internal pressure. The seventeen ends tested were full-size production ends made from stainless steel, with thickness to diameter ratios (te/Di) varying from 0. 002 to 0. 001. At each value of te/Di the knuckle radius (ri) and crown radius (Ri) were varied to cover the range of ends frequently used. Each end was stain gauged on both inner and outer surfaces and then pressurised until buckling occurred in the knuckle region. The strain gauges were monitored throughout each test thus giving a detailed coverage of the strain distribution. High compressive hoop strains, shown to exist on both surfaces of the knuckle, are responsible for the buckling mode of failure. A shape/thickness survey was performed on each end prior to pressure testing. The effects of thickness reductions and deviations of curvature from the nominal are discussed. Residual strain measurements were made on three ends and were shown to be significantly large in the pressed and spun manufactured ends. A study of the effect of work hardening on the properties of the material from which the ends were made is also presented. It is shown that the proof stress and Vickers hardness number increases rapidly when the material is work hardened. The dependence of the elastic stress indices, limit pressures and first buckling pressures on wall thickness, knuckle radius and crown radius has been examined.

40|$|In the United States, about {{a hundred}} million gallons of {{high-level}} nuclear waste are stored in underground containments. Basically, these containments are of two different designs: single-shell and double-shell structures. The single-shell structures consist of reinforced concrete cylindrical walls seated on circular mats and enclosed on top with <b>torispherical</b> domes or circular flat roofs. The walls and the basemats are lined with carbon steel. The double-shell structures provide another layer of protection and constitute a completely enclosed steel containment within the single-shell structure leaving an annular space between the two walls. Single-shell containments are of earlier vintage and {{were built in the}} period 1945 - 1965. Double-shell structures were built through the 1960 s and 1970 s. Experience gained in building and operating the single-shell containments was used in enhancing the design and construction of the double-shell structures. Currently, there are about 250 underground single-shell and double-shell structures containing the high-level waste with an inventory of about 800 million curies. During their service lives, especially in early stages, these structures were subjected to thermal excursions of varying extents; also, they have aged in the chemical environment. Furthermore, in their remaining service lives, the structures may be subjected to loads for which they were not designed, such as larger earthquakes or chemical explosions. As a result, the demonstration of safety of these underground nuclear containments poses a challenge to structural engineers, which increases with time. Regardless of current plans for gradual retrieval of the waste and subsequent solidification for disposal, many of these structures are expected to continue to contain the waste through the next 20 - 40 years. In order to verify their structural capabilities in fulfilling this mission, several studies were recently performed at Brookhaven National Laboratory...|$|E
