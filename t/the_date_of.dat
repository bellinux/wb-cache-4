50|$|The {{numbers or}} casting <b>dates</b> on <b>the</b> major {{components}} of a car would be present and fall in a particular order.For example, an engine’s assembly date would be before <b>the</b> build <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car, and <b>the</b> casting <b>dates</b> would be before <b>the</b> assembly <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine because an engine assembly <b>date</b> (<b>the</b> <b>date</b> <b>the</b> engine was assembled, usually at a different location) could not be after <b>the</b> assembly <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> whole car. Engines are assembled prior to being installed in the car at the factory. Therefore, <b>the</b> assembly <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car {{would have to be}} after <b>the</b> assembly <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine. Casting <b>dates</b> (<b>the</b> <b>dates</b> formed in <b>the</b> metal of a component at the foundry) could not be after <b>the</b> assembly <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> engine.
