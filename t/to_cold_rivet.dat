40|$|The {{essential}} role of hot-driven rivets is described for {{the industrial revolution}} with very limited-size rolling capability, with costly poor-quality bolts and without dependable fusion welding. While <b>cold</b> <b>rivets</b> were common for ages, the shrinkage of hot rivets gave water or steam tight joint. Rolled plate was limited to 1 x 3 m because of small mills, low power and manual handling. The essentials of riveting procedures and their limitations are described. The application of rivets in boilers, ships and bridges are described...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Over {{the last}} few years {{considerable}} effort has been put into the improvement of the fatigue life of aircraft structures. Aircraft experience complex loading conditions during flight and safe operation requires understanding of the underlying mechanics of fatigue crack growth. One of the outcomes of the research carried out over the last thirty years is that fatigue cracks in metals are partially closed over part of a load cycle. This phenomenon is thought by many researchers to be the key to understanding the effect of non-uniform loading. Understanding crack closure is particularly challenging when initial residual stress fields (e. g. due to manufacturing or mechanical treatment) need to be taken into account. For example, rivet holes are a critical area for fatigue and they are usually <b>cold</b> expanded <b>to</b> create a beneficial residual stress field and to improve the fatigue performance. This paper describes the development of a simple analytical model for plasticity-i nduced fatigue crack closure taking into account the residual stresses due <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> expansion of <b>rivet</b> holes. The model is compared to a more sophisticated finite element analysis of plasticity-induced crack closure. The results show that the residual stress field has a strong influence on the closure behaviour and therefore on fatigue crack propagation. The potential for the application of this model to real components is assessed by modelling some experiments taken from the literature. The model results agree with the experimental findings for the location of fatigue crack initiation. Residual stresses from FE analyses of cold expansion were used as an input to the analytical closure model, which successfully predicted crack propagation from cold-expanded holes...|$|R
40|$|Fatigue tests {{carried out}} on three {{configurations}} (unexpanded, <b>cold</b> expanded and <b>riveted)</b> of fiber metal laminate material clearly demonstrated the beneficial effect of <b>riveting</b> compared <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> expansion in zero load transfer joints, for an approximately equivalent level of interference. Digital image correlation {{was used to measure}} the in-plane surface strain on <b>cold</b> expanded and <b>riveted</b> coupons during fatigue loading, and for the first time, digital image correlation was combined with pressure sensitive films to measure the strains resulting from the application of the rivet, including those under the rivet head. A comparison of the resultant strain field showed that the application of a rivet significantly reduces the stress concentration at the central hole and is effective in extending fatigue life. Some rivet heads were removed by milling, and the results from subsequent fatigue tests were used together with closed-form calculations to explain the findings of this study. It was concluded that the beneficial effect of riveting was less as a result of interference hole filling {{on the part of the}} rivet shank, but more a combination of the effect of interference and compression through the joint thickness.

40|$|A rivet is a {{cylindrical}} body called a shank with a head.

40|$|Although {{sensitivity}} <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> {{is reported}} {{in more than}} half of Japanese females, there are few studies investigating it in young generations including male subjects. This study examined relationships between sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> and the health status in elementary, middle, high school, and college students in order to collect basic data to provide health care support for young people. A self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted involving 81 elementary, 226 middle, and 353 high school students living in Nara Prefecture, and 521 college students in Kyoto Prefecture (549 males and 632 females). The survey included questions that asked about the presence or absence, region, and level of sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>cold,</b> and health status (physical and psychological symptoms), and the results were compared between age groups and gender. In total, 70 % of the female students and 30 % of the male students reported sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>cold,</b> and they increased with age in both genders. In female subjects, the level of sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> increased with age, and, in male subjects, it was strongest in high school students. The health status was poorest in high school students of both genders, and female subjects presented significantly greater physical and psychological symptoms in all age groups than males. A significant positive correlation (r= 0. 66) was observed between the levels of sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> and health status. Although sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> and a poor (physical and psychological) health status were identified mostly in female subjects in all ages, sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> was also present in many male subjects. A strong correlation between sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> and the health status suggested the importance of implementing measures to improve symptoms of sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> and providing health care guidance. The poorest health status among high school students in both genders also indicated the need to provide health care guidance particularly for high school students...|$|R
40|$|In Drosophila melanogaster {{the fitness}} of males {{depends on a}} broad array of {{reproductive}} traits classified as pre- and post-copulatory traits. Exposure <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> stress, can reduce sperm number, male mating ability and courtship behavior. Therefore, it is expected that the adaptation <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> stress will involve changes in pre- and post-copulatory traits. Such evolution of reproductive traits in response <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> stress is not well studied. We selected replicate populations of D. melanogaster for resistance <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> shock. Over 37 - 46 generations of selection, we investigated pre- and post-copulatory traits such as mating latency, copulation duration, mating frequency, male fertility, fitness (progeny production) and sperm competitive ability in male flies subjected <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> shock and those not subjected <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> shock. We found that post cold shock, the males from the selected populations had a significantly lower mating latency along with, higher mating frequency, fertility, sperm competitive ability and number of progeny relative to the control populations. While most studies of experimental evolution of cold stress resistance have documented the evolution of survivorship in response to selection, our study clearly shows that adaptation <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> stress involves rapid changes in the pre- and post-copulatory traits. Additionally, improved performances under stressful conditions need not necessarily trade-off with performance under benign conditions...|$|R

40|$|Background: Cassava, an {{important}} tropical crop, has remarkable drought tolerance, but is very sensitive <b>to</b> <b>cold.</b> The growth, development, and root productivity of cassava are all adversely affected under cold and drought. Methods: To profile the transcriptional response <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> and drought stresses, cassava seedlings were respectively subjected to 0, 6, 24, and 48 h of cold stress and 0, 4, 6, and 10 days of drought stress. Their folded leaves, fully extended leaves, and roots were respectively investigated using RNA-seq. Results: Many genes specifically and commonly responsive <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> and drought were revealed: genes related to basic cellular metabolism, tetrapyrrole synthesis, and brassinosteroid metabolism exclusively responded to cold; genes related to abiotic stress and ethylene metabolism exclusively responded to drought; and genes related to cell wall, photosynthesis, and carbohydrate metabolism, DNA synthesis/chromatic structure, abscisic acid and salicylic acid metabolism, and calcium signaling commonly responded <b>to</b> both <b>cold</b> and drought. Discussion: Combined with cold- and/or drought-responsive transcription factors, the regulatory networks responding <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> and drought in cassava were constructed. All these findings will improve {{our understanding of}} the specific and common responses <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> and drought in cassava, and shed light on genetic improvement of cold and drought tolerance in cassava...|$|R
