5|$|According to Martin Noth, {{a scholar}} of the Hebrew Bible, the {{narratives}} of Isaac date back to an older cultural stage {{than that of the}} West-Jordanian Jacob. At that era, the Israelite tribes were not yet sedentary. In the course of looking for grazing areas, they had come in contact in southern Philistia with the inhabitants of the settled countryside. The biblical historian A. Jopsen believes in <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Isaac traditions and the north, and in support of this theory adduces Amos 7:9 ("the high places of Isaac").|$|E
5|$|Ahmad Karimi-Hakkak of the University of Maryland {{discusses}} how {{one aspect}} of Kiarostami's cinematic style {{is that he is}} able to capture essences of Persian poetry and create poetic imagery within the landscape of his films.

5|$|As he {{indicated}} in the title, Kepler thought he had revealed God's geometrical plan for the universe. Much of Kepler's enthusiasm for the Copernican system stemmed from his theological convictions about <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> physical and the spiritual; the universe itself was an image of God, with the Sun corresponding to the Father, the stellar sphere to the Son, and the intervening space between to the Holy Spirit. His first manuscript of Mysterium contained an extensive chapter reconciling heliocentrism with biblical passages that seemed to support geocentrism.|$|E

5|$|In his Poetics, Aristotle {{points to}} the ″voice of the shuttle″ in Sophocles′ tragedy Tereus {{as an example of}} a poetic device that aids in the ″recognition″—the change from ignorance to knowledge—of what has {{happened}} earlier in the plot. Such a device, according to Aristotle, is ″contrived″ by the poet, and thus is ″inartistic.″. <b>The</b> <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> nightingale's song and poetry is evoked by Aristophanes in his comedy The Birds and in the poetry of Callimachus. Roman poet Virgil compares the mourning of Orpheus for Eurydice to the “lament of the nightingale”.|$|E

The urethral sponge, however, {{which is also}} hypothesized as the G-spot, contains sensitive nerve endings and erectile tissue. Sensitivity is not determined by neuron density alone: other factors include the branching patterns of neuron terminals and cross or collateral innervation of neurons. While G-spot opponents argue that because {{there are very few}} tactile nerve endings in the vagina and that therefore the G-spot cannot exist, G-spot proponents argue that vaginal orgasms rely on pressure-sensitive nerves.|$|E
5|$|The name Bruce Castle {{is derived}} from the House of Bruce, who had {{historically}} owned a third of the manor of Tottenham. However, there was no castle in the area, and {{it is unlikely that the}} family lived nearby. Upon his accession to the Scottish throne in 1306, Robert I of Scotland forfeited his lands in England, including the Bruce holdings in Tottenham, ending <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Bruce family and the area. The former Bruce land in Tottenham was granted to Richard Spigurnell and Thomas Hethe.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, a new diesel {{shunting}} locomotive, made by Thomas Hill of Rotherham was purchased. It {{was built}} at Kilnhurst, and driven along the ex-Great Central Railway line {{from there to}} the works. The first Ruston and Hornsby engine was partially dismantled, and eventually cut up in January 1978. <b>The</b> <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> works and the British Rail network was cut in 1984, and the system became one of {{a very small number of}} isolated standard gauge railways. By 1986, the track layout had been simplified, and the track across Jordan bridge had been lifted. When rail operation ceased in the 1990s, one of the Hudson tipping wagons went to the National Railway Museum at Shildon, and the Thomas Hill engine, after several changes of ownership, is now located on the Peak Rail preserved railway at Matlock.|$|E
5|$|Juliomys anoblepas {{is similar}} to the other members of its genus in the {{configuration}} of its zygomatic plate (a bony plate {{on the side of the}} skull). It hardly extends forward in front of <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> plate and the main body of the skull, and that connection is relatively low on the skull. Furthermore, the incisive foramina, openings in the front part of the palate, extend to a point between the first molars, and the palate is short, with its back margin between the third molars. The living species of Juliomys differ from J.anoblepas in various characters, including shorter incisive foramina in two species and the shape of the zygomatic arch (cheekbone) in J.anoblepas. The upper molar row is 4.13mm long, which makes J.anoblepas the largest known species of Juliomys.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, John {{passes the}} time with both idle and cryptic chat, {{eventually}} telling Eric that his survival of a suicide attempt after his diagnosis is the true reason for his games. With the little time left to him, he wants to inspire in others the new appreciation for life he had found. Eric, not interested in any of this, runs out of patience {{and returns to the}} monitors. He destroys several of John's documents and sketches at Kerry's suggestion, but fails to provoke John. As the tech team arrives, John reveals <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> victims: Eric has framed all of them for various crimes, and Daniel will be in danger if his identity is discovered.|$|E

5|$|Tarbosaurus lacked these bony struts, and <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> nasals and lacrimals was weak. Instead, a {{backwards}} {{projection of}} the maxilla was massively developed in Tarbosaurus and fit inside a sheath formed from the lacrimal. This projection was a thin, bony plate in North American tyrannosaurids. The large backwards projection suggests that force was transmitted more directly from the maxilla to the lacrimal in Tarbosaurus. The lacrimal was also more firmly anchored to the frontal and prefrontal bones in Tarbosaurus. The well-developed connections between the maxilla, lacrimal, frontal and prefrontal would have made its entire upper jaw more rigid.|$|E
5|$|The Arizona Jewish Historical Society {{undertook}} a $4 million campaign in 2007 {{to raise the}} funds needed to restore the original synagogue building and other related structures to create the Cutler-Plotkin Jewish Heritage Center.

A $150,000 grant had been received in May of that year from the Arizona State Heritage Fund. By August 2008 much of the work of the first phase – the restoration of the sanctuary and annex – had been completed, and $2.1 million of the $2.6 million required for the work had been raised.|$|E
5|$|The most manifestly {{cyclical}} work of {{the three}} sonatas is the Sonata in A major. In the sonata's scherzo, a joyous passage in C major is suddenly interrupted by a fierce downward rushing scale in C-sharp minor, which closely recalls a parallel passage at {{the climax of the}} preceding movement; this is followed in the scherzo by a dance theme whose melody is derived from the Andantino's opening melody. This unique moment {{is one of the most}} explicit, audible cyclic references in the sonata trilogy. Another important cyclic element in the A major Sonata is the subtle similarities and connections that exist between each movement's ending and the following movement's opening; <b>the</b> <b>connection</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> opening and ending of the sonata as a whole, is even bolder: the sonata ends in a cancrizans of its opening, a framing device which is probably unprecedented in the sonata literature.|$|E
