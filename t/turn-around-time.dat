40|$|The aims of {{this project}} were to {{introduce}} the VITEK 2 Compact and to implement European Committee Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing guidelines in a small microbiology department. The VITEK 2 Compact is an automated analyser for the identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacteria and {{has been associated with}} decreased sample <b>turn-around-times,</b> cost savings and improved detection of multi-drug resistant organisms. There are 10 different guidelines for the clinical interpretation of antimicrobial susceptibility data. A national decision was made in 2010 to harmonise susceptibility data reporting in Ireland, by adopting European Committee Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing guidelines. This will enable the comparison of data between institutions at the patient, national and internationally level. The HSE Change Model was used to guide the change process. A vision for change, aligned with the organisations strong commitment to quality was created along with the key stakeholders. The vision was communicated along with the drivers for change. A plan was developed and implemented which included validation of the new processes and a training program. Mini-successes during the initial stages of the project were celebrated to ensure mainstreaming. Donabedian’s structure, process, outcome model was used for evaluation. Results demonstrated cost savings of € 2. 90 -€ 10. 28 per isolate and reduced <b>turn-around-times</b> of 1 - 20 hours, depending on organism complexity. Higher scores for external quality assurance samples were achieved in a direct comparison with historical procedures, demonstrating both trainee proficiency and process accuracy.

However, it's wide spread use has been hampered by the complex instrumentation required for its implementation when using fluorescence as the readout modality. We report herein a simple and compact fluorescence single-molecule instrument that is straightforward to operate and consisted of fiber optics directly coupled to a microfluidic device. The integrated fiber optics served as waveguides to deliver the laser excitation light to the sample and collecting the resulting emission, simplifying the optical requirements associated with traditional SMD instruments by {{eliminating the need for}} optical alignment and simplification of the optical train. Additionally, the use of a vertical cavity surface emitting laser and a single photon avalanche diode serving as the excitation source and photon transducer, respectively, as well as a field programmable gate array (FPGA) integrated into the processing electronics assisted in reducing the instrument footprint. This small footprint SMD platform was tested using fluorescent microspheres and single AlexaFluor 660 molecules to determine the optimal operating parameters and system performance.

40|$|The Precision Landing Reusable Launch Vehicle (PL-RLV) {{is a low}} L/D, 2 -stage craft with {{a mission}} plan that calls for low cost, speedy retrieval, and quick <b>turn-around-times</b> for {{successive}} flights. A guidance scheme that best adheres to these goals and captures the vehicle's capability is desired. During re-entry, the PL-RLV's second stage, the Precision Landing Vehicle 2 (PLV- 2), will perform a reversal maneuver. This thesis concentrates on a possible re-entry guidance scheme for the PLV- 2 during the terminal phase, the time from {{the completion of the}} reversal until the landing system parachutes are deployed. A simple bank-to-steer algorithm is suggested. The angle of attack is trimmed, and the bank angle (or bank rate) remains as the only means for control. The algorithm controls the time history of the vehicle's bank angle and tunes the bank angle history to meet landing and fuel requirements. This versatile guidance approach employs predictor-corrector methods. The guidance scheme presented generates a possibility of bankrate profiles within limitations {{that could be used for}} target acquisition. Selection of a robust target location and the nominal bankrate profile which will yield a minimum target miss are investigated. Testing shows the trade-offs between fuel cost and landing capability. Dispersion testing with winds and density are also performed. The predictor-corrector combination can yield target miss distances on the order of hundreds of feet or less. Open-loop and closed-loop results display the guidance system's ability to capture the PLV- 2 's capability in the presence of dispersions while still meeting system requirements. by Carla Haroz.

This study aimed to determine the ideal incubation time for accurate identification of inducible macrolide resistance as well as to determine if there was an association between the time taken to detect inducible resistance in M. abscessus group organisms and their erm(41) sequevar. We amplified and sequenced the erm(41) genes of a total of 104 M. abscessus group isolates and determined their sequevars. The isolates were tested for phenotypic clarithromycin resistance at days 7, 10, 14 and 21, using Trek Diagnostics Sensititre RAPMYCO microbroth dilution plates. Associations between erm(41) gene sequevars and time to detection of resistance were evaluated using Fisher's exact test in R. The samples included in this study fell into 14 sequevars, with the majority of samples falling into Sequevar 02 (16), Sequevar 06 (15), Sequevar 08 (7) and Sequvar 15 (31), and several isolates that were in small clusters, or unique. The majority (82. 7 %) of samples exhibiting inducible macrolide resistance were interpreted as resistant by day 7. Two isolates in Sequevar 02, which has a T 28 C mutation that is associated with sensitivity, showed intermediate resistance at day 14, though the majority (13) were sensitive at day 14.

Here we elucidate improvements in 24 hour workflow through incorporating multiple rapid technologies for positive blood culture ID into a 24 hour algorithm. Methods: MALDI-TOF (Bruker) analysis with sepsityper extraction (aerobic Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria); MALDI-TOF analysis with serum separator tube concentration (Gram-negative bacteria); and a FilmArray Blood Culture Panel (Biofire) were utilized. MALDI was utilized on 1 st shift for single bacterium positives. FilmArray was performed on 2 nd and 3 rd shift for aerobic bottles and on 1 st shift for gram-positive cocci in clusters and Candida. We examined all events during our pre-modification (September-November 2013) and post-modification (late-December 2014 -March 2015) time periods and defined an event as the first positive blood culture for a patient within the examined data period. The Antimicrobial Stewardship Pharmacist (ASP) was notified with identifications and also KPC carbapenemase positives, to implement a carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) empiric treatment algorithm. For KPC positives (CRE) a custom minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) panel was utilized, replacing a standard susceptibility panel and Etests. Finally, 2 nd shift began susceptibility setup on subcultured bloods that had turned positive from 11 p. m. - 6 a. m. Results: Pre- and post- workflow modification average turn-around times (TAT) and p-values are shown in the Table. Detection of either the KPC or the mecA marker significantly improved the TAT needed for phenotypic detection of carbapenem or methicillin resistance. KPC was detected in 3 Enterobactericeae.

The economic costs associated are substantial. Laboratory diagnosis of viral IID is important as the many infectious and non-infectious causes cannot be reliably differentiated using clinical or epidemiological characteristics alone. An accurate diagnosis can aid patient management, infection control procedures and reduce health care costs by preventing unnecessary treatments, testing for alternative causes and hospital stay. It also aids public health surveillance. At {{the start of the}} research described in this thesis the West of Scotland Specialist Virology Centre (WOSSVC) used Electron Microscopy (EM) as the frontline test for outbreaks and sporadic cases of IID. However, although rapid on a small number of samples, this technique {{has been shown to be}} insensitive, laborious and is not suited to testing large numbers of samples. The research presented in this thesis sought to examine whether molecular diagnostic techniques such as conventional gel-based or real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assays could be a viable replacement for EM as the frontline test(s) for viral IID in a routine laboratory service of this type, and whether their implementation could bring benefits to the laboratory service in terms of improved rapidity, sensitivity and throughput. The aim was to adapt published PCR methods for use in routine diagnostic work rather than for research purposes, an approach that distinguishes this research from previous work in this area. In order to achieve this aim, the appropriate PCR techniques were first selected from the literature, based on a combination of clinical and laboratory requirements, and were adapted for use in the laboratory service. A series of laboratory experiments was then carried out in order to compare the sensitivity of the adapted methods to existing techniques such as EM and antigen detection assays (EIAs) and to other methods that emerged during the period of study including alternative PCR assays. Where found to be suitable, the selected PCR tests were implemented in the routine diagnostic service for viral IID. The effects of these changes on the laboratory service were then examined. The results show that since the introduction of molecular tests at WOSSVC for the detection of viral pathogens in cases of gastroenteritis the number of samples tested has risen steadily, as have the detection rates for each of the main viral causes of IID. Furthermore, this has been achieved at the same time as a substantial reduction in sample <b>turn-around-times.</b> Such improvements will have a positive impact in several areas of public health relating to viral IID and are discussed fully, including patient management, infection control and national surveillance.
