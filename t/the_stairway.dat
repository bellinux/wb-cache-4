50|$|<b>The</b> central <b>stairway</b> is {{accessed}} {{from the}} L-shaped central hallway, which leads from an interior doorway in the kitchen. The hallway also provides {{entrance to the}} dining room and to the parlor. <b>The</b> central <b>stairway</b> featured a 3-step spiral at its base as late as the mid-1950s. That space now contains two landings instead. From the first landing, two steps downward through a former door once provided an additional entrance to the library. Beneath <b>the</b> first-floor <b>stairway</b> is a straight flight of stairs leading to the basement. On the second floor, at the top of <b>the</b> central <b>stairway,</b> there is an original stairway with one landing and one turn, leading to a trap door in the cupola. <b>The</b> central <b>stairway,</b> <b>the</b> circular <b>stairway,</b> and <b>the</b> cupola <b>stairway</b> all feature original, low handrails with three/quarter balusters.|$|R

5|$|Burial 265 {{was found}} {{at the base of}} <b>the</b> <b>stairway</b> of Terrace 1 Structure 2 in the acropolis. Ceramics {{associated}} with the burial have been dated to the Middle Preclassic Period. This burial is the only evidence yet found of such early activity at the site. It consists of the burial of a seated infant together with a newborn. The burial was laid out upon a layer of large stones and was accompanied by a plate and other ceramics as a funerary offering. The child's skull was found underneath the plate itself. Burnt stones and earth were found next to the burial.|$|E
5|$|Stela 88 {{may have}} been paired with Stela 62. The {{monument}} has {{the image of a}} queen but her name is unknown. B'olon K'awiil also appears to be mentioned on the stela. It dates to around 751 and stands on <b>the</b> <b>stairway</b> of Structure 13. Stela 91 is another very late monument probably dating to the early 10th century. Like Stela 84, it bears an inscription that is a meaningless imitation of hieroglyphic writing.|$|E
5|$|Temple 3 (also {{known as}} Structure 3) is a pyramid-temple {{located on the}} east side of Plaza A, {{opposite}} Temple 2, and is similar in form to that building. <b>The</b> <b>stairway</b> climbs the west (plaza) side of the temple platform. In front of <b>the</b> <b>stairway,</b> at the level of the plaza, is a small rectangular platform. A large amount of ceramic remains were found associated with this building, these were pieces of large cylindrical incense-burners, of which more than twelve were used in the temple. One represented an elderly god emerging from the jaws of a serpent, another two show the same deity in a standing position. They may represent one of the patrion deities of the Kaqchikel, B'elehe-Toh or Hun-Tihax. The incense burners were found exactly where the Kaqchikels had left them when they abandoned Iximche. Some of these incense-burners bore a suspended solar disc with modelled rays. Fragments of an Early Postclassic plumbate ware vessel were recovered scattered around three sides of the temple that were probably the remains of a relic from within the temple itself. There is no evidence of such early occupation at Iximche and may have been plundered from Zaculeu, a city with a long occupational history that was conquered by the K'iche'-Kaqchikel alliance. A sacrificial flint knife was also recovered from Structure 3. Two low platforms stand in front of the temple, they were likely to have been used either as altars or as dance platforms.|$|E

5|$|Both of the mansion's {{two floors}} consist of four large rooms with high ceilings, {{and each of}} these rooms {{is exactly the same}} size and shape. A grand {{stairway}} is located {{at the end of the}} mansion's central hall, extending from the first floor to <b>the</b> attic. <b>The</b> <b>stairway's</b> handrail is crafted of walnut, and it is connected to <b>the</b> <b>stairway's</b> shallow steps by a balustrade consisting of three small balusters per step.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>stairways</b> to <b>the</b> tenth terrace are {{along the}} side {{retaining}} walls where only the water chute with fountains is provided.|$|R
5|$|The house's room {{arrangement}} was planned for convenience and comfort, {{as compared to}} typical English mansions, which often were built with kitchens far from the dining room. Woodlea has 140 rooms, which were designed not to be drafty, and with important rooms not too remote. The rooms are all over-scaled {{in terms of the}} height of the ceilings and size of the doors, with large fireplaces, and the length and breadth of <b>the</b> <b>stairway</b> to the house's second floor. The staircases have recesses with intricate decorative panels.|$|E
5|$|The main {{entrance}} to the castle would have involved crossing a stone bridge between the two easterly ditch bridge towers and the main gatehouse; little remains of the bridge towers today and a timber entrance way to the gatehouse replaces the bridge. A water gate overlooks a protected stairway of 127 steps that runs down {{to the foot of}} the cliffs. In the 13th century, the sea came up close to <b>the</b> <b>stairway,</b> allowing resupply by sea, but today the sea has retreated significantly, making it more difficult to envisage the concept in its original setting.|$|E
5|$|The next ruler was K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil, {{a son of}} K'ak' Joplaj Chan K'awiil. The {{early period}} of his rulership fell within Cop√°n's hiatus, but later on he began a {{programme}} of renewal {{in an effort to}} recover from the city's earlier disaster. He built a new version of Temple26, with the Hieroglyphic Stairway being reinstalled on the new stairway and doubled in length. Five life-size statues of seated rulers were installed seated upon <b>the</b> <b>stairway.</b> K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil died in the early 760s and is likely to have been interred in Temple11, although the tomb has not yet been excavated.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> first <b>stairway</b> {{leading to}} <b>the</b> summit of Moro Rock was {{constructed}} {{of wood and}} installed in 1917. This stairway deteriorated significantly by the late 1920s, and was replaced in 1931 by the present Moro Rock <b>Stairway,</b> built by <b>the</b> Civilian Conservation Corps. Unlike <b>the</b> earlier <b>stairway,</b> <b>the</b> new <b>stairway</b> adopted a design policy of blending with the natural surfaces to the greatest extent possible. <b>The</b> 797-foot-long <b>stairway</b> was designed by National Park Service landscape architect Merel S. Sager and engineer Frank Diehl, following natural ledges and crevices. It has 400 steps {{that lead to the}} summit of Moro Rock. Changes since the original construction have impaired the integrity of the design.|$|R
25|$|On {{the grounds}} of the facility, cracks in the {{pavement}} and soil were present, but no surface faulting was present. In addition to the collapse of <b>the</b> <b>stairways,</b> <b>the</b> elevators were out of commission. Power and communications failures affected the hospital {{at the time of the}} earthquake, but very few people occupied the lower floors and <b>the</b> <b>stairways</b> at <b>the</b> early hour. Casualties in these highly affected areas might have increased had the shock occurred later in the day. The duration of strong ground motion at that location was probably similar to the 12 seconds that was observed at the Pacoima Dam, and an additional few seconds of shaking is thought to have been enough to bring the building to collapse.|$|R
5|$|The {{performance}} of Rebecca {{seems to me}} to have taken us further into the danger area instead of showing any improvement. I am unable to defend at a time when departmental costs and scene loads are in an acute state the load imposed by Rebecca on Design and Supply and the expenditure upon extras and costumes... the vast area of the hall and <b>the</b> <b>stairway</b> never justified the great expenditure of effort required in building and one is left with a very clear impression of reaching a point where the department must be accused of not knowing what it is doing.|$|E
5|$|When Engine Co. 22 arrived, it {{was ordered}} to pump water on the {{warehouse}}. The company's firefighters entered the warehouse and dragged a hose up a staircase to direct water onto the fourth floor. When heavy black smoke began coming down <b>the</b> <b>stairway,</b> Foreman Garrett B. Lane ordered his firemen to evacuate. Fireman Francis Hart, Jr., became trapped while trying to collect the hose {{and was forced to}} flee to the roof and escape over neighboring rooftops.|$|E
5|$|A {{visually}} striking {{effect is}} seen every March and September as an unusual shadow occurs around the equinoxes. A shadow appears to descend the west balustrade {{of the northern}} stairway. The visual effect is of a serpent descending <b>the</b> <b>stairway,</b> with its head at the base in light. Additionally the western face points to sunset around 25 May, traditionally the date of transition from the dry to the rainy season. The intended alignment was, however, likely incorporated in the northern (main) facade of the temple, as it corresponds to sunsets on May 20 and July 24, recorded also by the central axis of Castillo at Tulum.. The two dates are separated by 65 and 300 days, {{and it has been}} shown that the solar orientations in Mesoamerica regularly correspond to dates separated by calendrically significant intervals (multiples of 13 and 20 days).|$|E
60|$|All of <b>the</b> <b>stairways</b> {{had been}} burned away, and the {{plastering}} {{from top to bottom}} of the three hallways was down. In the rear, two dormitories and the garret floor {{had been burned}} out.|$|R

5|$|In 1902, the First Roumanian-American congregation/Congregation Shaarey Shamoyim {{purchased}} the Rivington Street building from the Church Extension and Missionary Society {{to satisfy a}} need for a larger building to serve the Lower East Side's rapidly growing Romanian-Jewish population. At the time, the property was valued at $95,000 (today $). The funds for the purchase were raised from the members of the congregation, and to honor those contributing $10 or more, names were engraved on one of four marble slabs in <b>the</b> <b>stairway</b> to the main sanctuary. The most generous gift was $500, at a time when $10 was two weeks' pay. The congregation also took out two mortgages; one for $50,000 (today $) with the Title Insurance Company, and a second for $30,000 (today $) with the Church Extension and Missionary Society.|$|E
5|$|Smoke Imix {{demolished}} the Papagayo {{phase and}} ritually interred the broken remains of its sculpted monuments, accompanied by stone macaw heads {{from an early}} version of the ballcourt. He then built a pyramid over the earlier phases, nicknamed Mascar√≥n by archaeologists. It in turn was developed into the Chorcha pyramid {{with the addition of a}} long superstructure with seven doorways at the front and back. Before a new building was built over the top, the upper sanctuary was demolished and a tomb was inserted into the floor and covered with 11 large stone slabs. The tomb contained the remains of an adult male and a sacrificed child. The adult's badly decayed skeleton was wrapped in a mat and accompanied by offerings of fine jade, including ear ornaments and a necklace of sculpted figurines. The burial was accompanied by offerings of 44 ceramic vessels, jaguar pelts, spondylus shells, 10 paintpots and one or more hieroglyphic books, now decayed. There were also 12 ceramic incense burners with lids modeled into human figurines, thought to represent Smoke Imix and his 11 dynastic predecessors. The Chorcha building was dedicated to the long-lived 7th-century king Smoke Imix and it is therefore likely that the remains interred in the building are his. Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil had sealed the Chorcha phase under a new version of the temple, nicknamed Esmeralda, by AD710. The new phase bore the first version of the Hieroglyphic Stairway, which contains a lengthy dynastic history. K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil built over the Esmeralda phase in the mid-8thcentury. He removed the Hieroglyphic Stairway from the earlier building and reinstalled it into his own version, while doubling the length of its text and adding five life-size statues of rulers dressed in the garb of Teotihuacano warriors, each seated on a step of <b>the</b> <b>stairway.</b> At the base of <b>the</b> <b>stairway,</b> he also raised StelaM, with his own image. The summit shrine of the temple bore a hieroglyphic text composed of full-figure hieroglyphs, each placed beside a similar glyph in faux-Mexican style, giving the appearance of a bilingual text.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} 2015‚Äì2019 MTA Capital Program, the 42nd Street Shuttle {{will become}} ADA accessible, and the shuttle will be reconfigured from three tracks to two tracks, and the trains will become six cars long. The whole project will cost $235.41 million. The {{platforms}} at Times Square will be extended {{to allow for a}} second point of entry at Sixth Avenue, with a connection to the IND Sixth Avenue Line. The Times Square station will be rehabilitated with congestion mitigation measures. A wider stairway would be installed from the shuttle mezzanine to street level, a new control area would be installed at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>stairway,</b> and 21 columns would be removed. The cost of this part of the project is $28.93 million. Also included in the Capital Program is funding for a study that would develop the requirements for a second program to automate the shuttle. The cost of this part of the project is $30 million. The project is delayed, and construction will start in May 2018.|$|E
