50|$|In several {{clinical}} trials, clocapramine {{has been}} compared to other neuroleptic agents. Against haloperidol, though {{there was no significant difference}} in efficacy at the end of the study, clocapramine tended to be superior in alleviating motor retardation, alogia, and thought disorder, and also produced fewer side effects. Against sulpiride, clocapramine demonstrated more favorable effects in the treatment of both positive and negative symptoms, including motor retardation, delusions, hallucinations, and social isolation, though it produced more side effects. Against <b>timiperone,</b> clocapramine showed lower efficacy against both positive and negative symptoms and produced more side effects such as dyskinesia, insomnia, constipation, and nausea.|$|E
40|$|The {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} <b>timiperone,</b> a new butyrophenone derivative, in schizophrenia as compared with haloperidol were assessed in a multi-clinic double-blind controlled study {{in a total of}} 206 patients. The patients were given <b>timiperone</b> (1 · 0 mgltablet) or haloperidol (1 · 5 mgltablet) in a daily dose of 1 - 3 tablets for the first day, then up to a maximum of 12 tablets depending on symptoms for 12 weeks. <b>Timiperone</b> was found to be significantly superior to haloperidol in the final global improvement rating and in the general usefulness rating. In the over-all safety rating there were no statistically {{significant differences between the two}} drug treatments. With regard to analysis by stratification <b>timiperone</b> was superior to haloperidol in improving abnormal experiences such as hallucination and delusion as well as deficiency of initiative and blunted affect. From these results it is considered that <b>timiperone</b> could be superior to haloperidol in the treatment ofschizophrenia. at PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIV on September 18, 2016 imr. sagepub. comDownloaded from T K ariya et a...|$|E
40|$|Seven butyrophenones {{in human}} whole blood were {{analyzed}} by LC/MS/MS using a new polymer column (MSpak GF- 310), which enabled direct injection of crude biological samples without complicated pretreatments. The quantitation was made by mass chromatography for each product ion, The recoveries were more than 50 % for haloperidol, bromperidol, moperone and spiroperidol at 80 ng/ml in whole blood, but less than 10 % for pimozide. The regression equations showed good linearity for haloperidol, bromperidol, moperone and spiroperidol {{in the range of}} 10 - 80 ng/ml, for <b>timiperone</b> in the range of 20 - 80 ng/ml and for pimozide in the range of 50 - 200 ng/ml using the chlorinated analog of haloperidol as internal standard, Their detection limits were about 5 ng/ml for haloperidol, bromperidol, moperone and spiroperidol, about 10 ng/ml for <b>timiperone</b> and about 25 ng/ml for pimozide. Thus, the present method seems useful for sensitive and specific detection and determination of their high therapeutic and toxic levels present in biological specimens including whole blood. rights:日本法中毒学会rights:本文データは日本法中毒学会の許諾のもと掲載しています...|$|E
40|$|We {{established}} a practical and reliable method for rapid and simple analysis for butyrophenones in human hemolyzed blood by LS/MS/MS. Removal of hemoglobin {{and other large}} proteins from hemolyzed blood was simply completed using Amicon Ultra- 4 centrifugal filter device (MILLIPORE). Six kinds of butyrophenones used in this research were detected with high sensitivity by LC/MS/MS. The detection limit in human hemolyzed blood was about 5 ng/ml except for <b>timiperone</b> and pimozide. rights:日本法中毒学会rights:本文データは日本法中毒学会の許諾のもと掲載しています...|$|E
40|$|Pharmacological {{specificity}} of several classes of {{drugs such as}} antipsychotics and antiischemic agents was assessed for σ receptors labeled with [(3) H] haloperidol. Specific binding of [(3) H] haloperidol {{in the presence of}} 25 nM spiperone was saturable and high affinity) Kd= 1. 96 ± 1. 31 nM, Bmax= 2. 37 ± 0. 27 pmol/mg of protein;n= 8). Among the 29 antipsychotics tested in inhibition studies, bromperidol and haloperidol were the most potent inhibitors (Ki= 0. 9 nM, 1. 0 nM, respectively). The conventional antipsychotics moperone, <b>timiperone</b> etc. and the novel promising drugs YM- 09151, Y- 516, BMY- 14802 and remoxipride potently inhibited [(3) H] haloperidol binding with the Ki in the range of low to moderate nanomolar. On the other hand, among the other 27 drugs tested, the antispasmodics eperisone and tolperisone, the antiischemic agents ifenprodil, the Ca(2 +) antagonist flunarizine and cinnarizine, and the antitussives carbetapentane, cloperastine and dextromethorphan, were especially potent inhibitors. These results, taken together with the evidence that the antiischemic agents ifenprodil and dextromethorphan antagozine NMDA responses and NMDA receptor complex is a possible site of action for neuroprotective agents, strongly suggest that σ receptors may be potential sites of action for antiischemic as well as antipsychotic drugs, i. e., σ receptors mediate the neuroprotective effects of certain antiischemic agents by affecting the NMDA receptor complex...|$|E
