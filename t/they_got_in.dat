25|$|While {{the effects}} of the tariff were exaggerated, {{manufactured}} imports from Europe were cheaper than American-made products without the tariff, and the tariff did reduce British imports of cotton to some extent. These were largely short-term problems that existed before United States factories and textile makers could compete with Europe. Also, the tariff replaced a tax system where slave states previously had to pay more in taxes for the increased representation <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> the U.S. House of Representatives under the three-fifths clause.|$|E

25|$|After {{the first}} {{loss of the}} season, Tottenham then had the {{challenge}} of Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, and although Spurs stayed in the game for long periods, they eventually succumbed to a 3–0 defeat.

The game played out on even footing with Preston giving as good as <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> the early stage until Tottenham finally got the breakthrough and ended the game with a 5–1 victory with Peter Crouch scoring a hat-trick in the process.|$|E
25|$|That {{was before}} <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> to bat, however. England survived {{the first three}} overs, bowled by McGrath and Lee, without loss. From then on, however, the English lost wickets by the bucketful. England went from 11 for 0 to 19 for 4 {{in the space of}} four overs, as the bowlers put the {{pressure}} on immediately, and their entire top-order came and went for single-figure scores. Paul Collingwood and Andrew Flintoff survived for a couple more overs, before Flintoff edged McGrath to slip – the score 33 for 5, and England should see themselves lucky to bat out 50 overs – or even score 100 runs. Collingwood and Geraint Jones decided to wait, giving McGrath maiden overs (as he finished his first bowling spell with figures of 7–4–9–3), and despite the batsmen being rapped on the pads, they survived, even taking the occasional six off Jason Gillespie.|$|E
25|$|The Backstreet Boys {{had their}} very first {{performance}} at SeaWorld Orlando on May 8, 1993. The group then continued {{to perform in}} various venues during summer 1993, from shopping malls, restaurants, to a high-profile charity gala in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. With a change in management in the fall, they began to tour schools across the U.S. (including Littrell's former school, Tates Creek High School), building a fan base while {{trying to get a}} record deal. Mercury Records nearly signed them in 1993, but the deal fell through at the last minute because longtime Mercury recording artist John Mellencamp threatened to leave the label if <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> boy band business. However, in February 1994, Jeff Fenster (then senior VP A Zomba/JIVE Records) and David Renzer (then senior VP/GM of Zomba Music Publishing) caught the group performing at a high school in Cleveland, and signed them to their first record deal.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea behind}} using the sex gas came from Chibnall, but he {{admitted}} to having [...] "genuinely no idea where the episode came from". Davies stated [...] "when we're launching a new adult science fiction drama, it's kind of inevitable you're {{going to do the}} sex monster." [...] He also emphasised that the episode is not solely about [...] "having a laugh" [...] with the sex gas, as it also has [...] "something to say about the world". The scene where Carys walks down the street featuring sex in advertisements and couples kissing in public was one of Davies' favourite scenes in the episode, as it explores how [...] the Western world is. The episode was originally much lighter in tone, however, the majority of the comedic moments had to be cut on the final script, as <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> the way of the plot. Also, Carys was originally meant to have two or three boyfriends, but because of scheduling restrictions, there could only be one. This ended up being beneficial to the episode, as it made it more emotive. There was a scene that would be filmed with Carys and a second boyfriend, but that would be cut and added on the deleted scenes on the DVD boxset of the first series.|$|E
500|$|Hopkins was {{generally}} expected to reprise his Academy Award-winning role. Hopkins did say in June 1999 {{that he would}} only be interested if the script was [...] "really good". Hopkins says on the making-of feature on DVD that he couldn’t {{make up his mind}} to commit. [...] "I was kind of surprised by this book, Hannibal. I thought it was really overreaching and so bizarre. So I couldn’t make up my mind about it all. Some of it I found intriguing, some I was a little doubtful about." [...] When the producers confirmed {{that they were going to}} film Harris' novel, Hopkins told them yes, but added: [...] "It needs some condensing." [...] The Hollywood Reporter would confirm that Hopkins had agreed to reprise his role in late December 1999, saying he had approved the latest [...] of the script by Steven Zaillian. Hopkins said he had no difficulty moving back into [...] "Lecter's mind". [...] "I just learned the lines and showed up and walked around as Hannibal Lecter. I thought, 'Do I repeat that same performance, or do I vary it?' Ten years had passed so I changed a bit." [...] In the book, Lecter uses bandages to disguise himself as a plastic surgery patient. This was left out of the film because Scott and Hopkins agreed to leave the face alone. Hopkins explains why: [...] "It's as if he's making a statement—'catch me if you can'. With his big hat, he's so obvious that nobody thinks he's Hannibal Lecter. I've always thought he's a very elegant man, a Renaissance man." [...] In the film, Lecter is first seen in Florence [...] "as the classical Lecter, lecturing and being smooth", according to Hopkins. When the film moves to the U.S., Hopkins changed his appearance by building up muscle and cropping his hair short [...] "to make him like a mercenary, that he would be so fit and so strong that he could just snap somebody in two if <b>they</b> <b>got...</b> <b>in</b> his way".|$|E

2500|$|Jimmy Jacobs, who co-managed Mike Tyson, used a {{synchronizer}} {{to measure}} young Ali's punching speed versus Sugar Ray Robinson, a welter/middleweight who was considered pound-for-pound the best fighter in history. Ali was 25% faster than Robinson, even though Ali was 45–50pounds heavier. Ali's punches produced approximately 1,000pounds of force. [...] "No matter what his opponents heard about him, they didn't realize how fast he was until <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> the ring with him", Jacobs said. The effect of Ali's punches was cumulative. Charlie Powell, who fought Ali early in Ali's career and {{was knocked out}} in the third round, said: [...] "When he first hit me I said to myself, 'I can take two of these to get one in myself.' But {{in a little while}} I found myself getting dizzier and dizzier every time he hit me. He throws punches so easily that you don't realize how much they hurt you until it's too late." ...|$|E

Jericho recovered and clotheslined JBL out of the ring. When <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> again, JBL threw Jericho into the ring post, as a result of which, Jericho was busted open. JBL tried {{to take advantage of this}} situation, but Jericho still fought back. The fight went outside the ring, where JBL began clearing the ECW announce table. Jericho grabbed a steel chair and hit Layfield with it. The referee immediately disqualified Jericho, who ignored the fact that he had lost the match and started to strangle JBL with some wires by the ring, in the same process Layfield did to Jericho on Raw.|$|E

One of their questions was 'Weren't there times when everybody, {{or at least a}} few people, just panicked?' My answer was 'No, when bad things happened, we just calmly laid out all the options, and failure was not one of them. We never panicked, and we never gave up on finding a solution.' I immediately sensed that Bill Broyles wanted to leave and assumed that he was bored with the interview.

2500|$|King Kong was {{the first}} film to feature a giant monster running amok in civilization (the silent The Lost World was {{actually}} the first—although it featured a rampaging Brontosaurus rather than a non-science-based monster—but was rarely seen after its first release until the video and cable-TV booms of the 1980s); there are echoes of the original King Kong film in every giant-monster film {{that has been made}} since 1933. These include The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms (1953), Godzilla (1954) and Jurassic Park (1993). The dinosaur scenes from King Kong are referenced or mimicked in the three Jurassic Park films, especially the second film, [...] (1997). In the third act of the film, a creature (a Tyrannosaurus rex) is brought to civilization from a remote island where it runs amok in a city (the ship that transports the beast is even called The Venture, which {{is the name of the}} ship in King Kong). Kong is even mentioned directly in the first one: as the tour group approaches the massive Jurassic Park gate that is reminiscent of the gate in King Kong, Jeff Goldblum's character asks, [...] "What have <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> there, King Kong?" [...] In the third film in this series, a Spinosaurus vs. Tyrannosaurus rex fight is similar to the Kong–rex battle in the original and the second remake.|$|E
2500|$|In 1977, Boyer {{published}} a pamphlet, Trailing an American Myth, {{in which he}} stated that the Clum manuscript was actually written by several authors.

[...] In the same year, Boyer wrote and {{published a}}nother pamphlet, [...] "Who Killed John Ringo?" [...] It stated that fiction writers Dashiell Hammett, Wilson Mizner, Rex Beach and Walt Coburn had written {{a portion of the}} [...] manuscript documenting Josephine' Tombstone years. [...] When questioned about the origins of the Clum manuscript during the early 1980s, Boyer changed his story to say that he did not receive the Clum manuscript from Colyn after all, instead it was given to him by one of Earp's nieces, Jeanne Cason Laing. When asked if these were all the same manuscript, Boyer replied, [...] "Some of them are a manuscript. Some are only a mishmash, as a matter of fact... The earlier ones of those guys all lean heavily on Clum and Parsons for insights, {{which is one of the}} reasons <b>they</b> <b>got</b> <b>in</b> trouble with Josephine Earp...
