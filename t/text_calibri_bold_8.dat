5000|$|Aoki {{started a}} project called Miyumi Project, named after his daughter, at Museum of Contemporary Art. It brings {{together}} the distinct {{music of the}} East in the forms of Japanese drums - taiko and shime, Korean drums - Buk, and mixed them with his own jazz bass, and AACM musician Mwata Bowden. Aoki’s vision was to create sounds that borrow from the traditional drumming of Asia spiced by African, Latin and European sounds. The Taiko drumming beats (and I mean beats) a macho time in a very regular pattern. Over this very physical sound, Mwata Bowden (<b>8</b> <b>Bold</b> Souls) improvises his large baritone saxophone. The effect is similar to fellow Chicago percussionist Kahil El Zabar’s Ethnic Heritage Ensemble, except the beat is from the East. Double reedist Robbie Hunsinger to add a call and response joins Bowden’s saxophone and clarinet. He even picks up a digeridoo on [...] "Early Dance” pushing the recording to an entire world music. Most songs state a simple pattern for the reeds or Aoki’s bass to improvise over. This engaging approach comes directly from {{the heart and soul}} of a true innovator of jazz.|$|R
40|$|Natural {{images have}} a {{characteristic}} 1 /f a power spectrum (Field, 1985). Different natural images thus differ mostly in their phase, and their spatial structure (e. g. edges) results in correlated phase spectra. Our {{aim was to}} study how processing in visual cortex varies {{as a function of}} phase correlation. To do this, we generated random phase spectra and performed linear interpolation between these random spectra and phase spectra of natural images. By using different interpolation levels (0, 25, 50, 75, 100 signal), we could parametrically investigate the effects of phase correlation on the activity in visual areas, while keeping the power spectrum constant. Images were 10 °× 10 ° in size, and were presented at randomized locations within ± 3 ° of the center of gaze to mimick saccadic eye movements. To study such effects by means of <b>BOLD</b> imaging, multi-shot (<b>8)</b> horizontal GE-recalled EPI images (voxel volume 0. 5 × 0. 5 × 2 mm 3, TE= 20, TR= 740, FA= 50) of the entire brain of anesthetized monkeys were obtained using a Biospec 4. 7 T/ 40 cm scanner (Bruker, Inc.) with 50 mT/m gradients. This preparation affords the unique opportunity to examine activity in many brain areas simultaneously independent of cognitive factors, and provides a baseline to which human and awake monkey fMRI data on object processing may be compared. We found that many voxels were activated by natural images and/or interpolated patterns. Activity in striate and extrastriate cortical areas was modulated by interpolation level, with natural objects at 100 signal typically eliciting most activity. We plan {{to examine the effects of}} varying power spectra (i. e. values of a) on the BOLD signal...|$|R
40|$|Increasing urban {{development}} can have significant effects on wildlife species, includingcarnivores. Some carnivore {{species have been}} able to adapt to and even thrive in urban envi-ronments, including coyotes (Canis latrans). The presence of carnivores in urban areas cansometimes lead to conflicts with humans and their pets. Although coyotes may frequentlyuse urban areas, they also inhabit natural areas surrounding {{urban development}}. Under-standing the various factors affecting patch choice of urban coyotes may assist wildlifeofficials in managing human-coyote conflicts. Both sex and behavioral profile can influ-ence patch choice; bold individuals {{are more likely to be}} exploratory than shy animals,which can result in increased conflicts in urban environments. Using a captive populationof coyotes, we tested whether coyotes preferred urban (anthropogenic) habitat structure,natural structure, or a mixture of structures and whether sex, behavioral profile, biologi-cal season, or food manipulation affected coyote patch choice. Coyotes generally preferredthe control, homogeneous structure representing their natal habitat (mean percentage oftime 23. 3 % ± 19. 3 SD; P = 0. 037). The next most preferred habitat for coyotes, especiallyfemales (23. 7 ± 16. 6 % for 25 % urban pen; P = 0. 020) and <b>bold</b> coyotes (27. <b>8</b> ± 23. 2 % for 75 %urban pen; P = 0. 005), was a mixture of anthropogenic and natural structures rather thanuniform structure (all natural or all anthropogenic), and this preference was more stronglyexpressed during the non-breeding season (25. 6 ± 23. 2 % for 75 % urban pen; P = 0. 017). Foodhad no effect on patch choice (P = 0. 983); coyotes appeared to be primarily motivated by thestructure of the habitat rather than by the amount of food within each habitat. Our resultssuggested that urban areas containing large amounts of both natural and anthropogenicstructures are more likely to be used by coyotes and, thus, could have the potential forhuman-coyote conflicts...|$|R
40|$|Approximately 20 % of {{the adult}} {{population}} suffer from chronic pain that is not adequately treated by current therapies, highlighting a great need for improved treatment options. To develop effective analgesics, experimental human and animal models of pain are critical. Topically/intra-dermally applied capsaicin induces hyperalgesia and allodynia to thermal and tactile stimuli that mimics chronic pain and is a useful translation from preclinical research to clinical investigation. Many behavioral and self-report studies of pain have exploited the use of the capsaicin pain model, but objective biomarker correlates of the capsaicin augmented nociceptive response in nonhuman primates remains to be explored. Here we establish an aversive capsaicin-induced fMRI model using non-noxious heat stimuli in Cynomolgus monkeys (n = <b>8).</b> <b>BOLD</b> fMRI data were collected during thermal challenge (ON: 20 s/ 42 °C; OFF: 40 s/ 35 °C, 4 -cycle) at baseline and 30 min post-capsaicin (0. 1 mg, topical, forearm) application. Tail withdrawal behavioral studies were also conducted in the same animals using 42 °C or 48 °C water bath pre- and post- capsaicin application (0. 1 mg, subcutaneous, tail). Group comparisons between pre- and post-capsaicin application revealed significant BOLD signal increases in brain regions associated with the 'pain matrix', including somatosensory, frontal, and cingulate cortices, as well as the cerebellum (paired t-test, p< 0. 02, n = 8), while no significant change was found after the vehicle application. The tail withdrawal behavioral study demonstrated a significant main effect of temperature and a trend towards capsaicin induced reduction of latency at both temperatures. These findings provide insights into the specific brain regions involved with aversive, 'pain-like', responses in a nonhuman primate model. Future studies may employ both behavioral and fMRI measures as translational biomarkers to gain deeper understanding of pain processing and evaluate the preclinical efficacy of novel analgesics...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Phosphorus {{utilization}} {{efficiency is}} very low in soil due to its low solubility and mobility. Legumes {{have been shown to}} increase P uptake of the following wheat, but the underlying mechanisms of this effect are unclear. MATERIALS AND METHODS Using three soils with low P availability differing in pH and therefore predominant P form: Mount <b>Bold</b> (pH 4. <b>8),</b> Monarto (pH 7. 5) and Langhorne Creek pH 8. 8), a rotation of faba bean, white lupin and wheat and unplanted soil in phase 1 and wheat in phase 2 was grown. To distinguish between the pre-crop effect and the residue effect, the residues from the pre-crops in phase 1 were either returned to the pre-crop soil or added to the previously unplanted soil. In the rhizosphere of wheat, P fractions were determined and the community composition of bacteria, fungi, P mobilizers (ALP gene), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) – denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). RESULTS There were no differences in wheat root and shoot biomass among treatments in the acidic Mount Bold soil, but in both the alkaline Langhorne Creek and neutral Monarto soils, wheat shoot biomass was highest in wheat and white lupin pre-crop soils. The alkaline Langhorne Creek soil had the highest concentrations of HCl P, whereas NaOH I Pi, NaOH I Po, NaOH II Pi, residual P and total P were highest in the acidic Mount Bold soil. In the soil with residues, the presence of plants in phase 1 of the rotation increased the concentrations of labile P pools and the NaOH extractable P pools in the rhizosphere of wheat compared to wheat grown in the previously unplanted soil, with the increase occurring in both inorganic and organic P fractions. As the amount of residues added in the soil was only 1 g[*]kg- 1, the effect of the residues alone on soil P pools was relatively small. The community composition of all microbial groups investigated differed among soils and within one soil by the pre-crop. Among the pre-crops, white lupin had a negative effect on AMF colonization although resin P concentrations were not higher than in the other pre-crop treatments. CONCLUSIONS Soil P pools and microbial community composition were predominantly affected by soil pH and within a given soil by the pre-crop treatment whereas the residue effect was small. The finding that in two of the soils the presence of plants in phase 1 of the rotation increased P uptake by 6 week-old wheat but also increased the concentrations of labile P pools and the NaOH extractable P pools in the rhizosphere of wheat suggests that pre-crops may enhance P uptake by wheat also in the later stages of growth.
