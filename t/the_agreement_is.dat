5|$|The {{chair of}} European Parliament Mediator for International Parental Child Abduction was {{established}} in 1987 by initiative of British politician and MEP Charles Henry Plumb, {{with the goal of}} helping minor children of international couples victim of parental abduction. The Mediator finds negotiated solutions in the higher interest of the minor when said minor is abducted by a parent following separation of the couple, regardless whether married or unmarried. Since its institution, the chair has been held by Mairead McGuinnes (since 2014), Roberta Angelilli (2009-2014), Evelyne Gebhardt (2004-2009), Mary Banotti (1995-2004), and Marie-Claude Vayssade (1987-1994). The Mediator's main task is to assist parents in finding a solution in the minor's best interest through mediation, i.e. a form of controversy resolution alternative to lawsuit. The Mediator is activated by request of a citizen and, after evaluating the request, starts a mediation process aimed at reaching an agreement. Once subscribed by both parties and the Mediator, <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>is</b> official. The nature of <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>is</b> that of a private contract between parties. In defining the agreement, the European Parliament offers the parties the juridical support necessary to reach a sound, lawful agreement based on legality and equity. The agreement can be ratified by the competent national courts and can also lay the foundation for consensual separation or divorce.|$|E
5|$|The port officially started {{operating}} on July 15, 1945, handling imports of coal and cereal and exports of bauxite and timber. The railway was rebuilt to standard gauge in 1966, and electric traction {{was installed in}} 1969 to increase the port's throughput, which reached one million tonnes within a few years. Development of the port was sustained until 1991, when the Croatian War of Independence and the Bosnian War brought about a five-year decline, affecting not only the port's accessibility but also its primary market. In 1996, Croatia and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina signed the Ploče Agreement, regulating unhindered passage of goods between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Port of Ploče and stipulating that such cargo should be duty-free. Enforcement of <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>is</b> related to {{the duration of the}} Neum Agreement.|$|E

It would, however, be advisable for the parties to <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> to sign a single written document, as this would assist in eliminating later disputes {{as to whether or}} not an <b>agreement</b> <b>was</b> actually entered into, and what the content of <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>was.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>was</b> never {{carried out}} {{due to the}} failure of the Dardanelles {{campaign}} and the threat Britain saw in Russia after the former finally reached the city in 1918. <b>The</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>was</b> revealed by <b>the</b> Bolsheviks in 1917, making public the British diplomatic intentions and encouraging the passing of the Balfour Declaration.

25|$|Swedenborg's {{approach}} to demonstrating {{the veracity of}} his theological teachings was to find and use voluminous quotations from the Old Testament and the New Testament to demonstrate agreement between the Bible and his theological teachings.

25|$|The {{implementation}} of <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> has <b>been</b> controversial, as critics {{have argued that}} <b>the</b> <b>agreement</b> <b>was</b> passed without proper environmental review.
