500|$|Paul {{built the}} members a cabana style house on his pool deck with air conditioning, a TV, and beds so the members felt {{comfortable}} while recording. Paul produced {{the record and}} Gray felt Paul [...] "facilitated the whole thing". The album was completed in roughly a month, with three recording sessions. The band worked on the record for eight days and returned home for a break. A 14-day session, followed the break and then another 10 days in the studio. Gray asserts the breaks in between recording sessions were to [...] "re charge the batteries", and [...] "get a fresh head". As the line-up was complete, the band started to brainstorm names. When a member thought of a name they would write it {{on a piece of}} paper and put it in an amp box outside the studio. Someone wrote [...] "Hellyeah", and the band thought it was a perfect choice. Paul says it's [...] "very affirmative and full of attitude. When your buddy asks if you want to get a beer <b>tonight,</b> <b>you</b> don't just say 'yes,' you say, [...] "Hell yeah!". Gray attributes the name to [...] "late teens, keggers and chicks and AC/DC and Metallica".|$|E
500|$|The album's {{opening track}} and lead single, [...] "Control", is an up-tempo {{electronic}} song. Heavily influenced by techno and trance, {{it contains a}} prominent electric guitar riff. [...] "I told Ben [...] I {{wanted to do a}} song that had elements of rock and roll but with a techno vibe and he ran with it, creating a slamming heavy metal guitar intro on an insanely hyper track." [...] The song is about a dominant female who nurses a broken heart as she sings, [...] "Let me kiss it and make it better/After <b>tonight</b> <b>you</b> will forget her". [...] "Fallen Angel" [...] is also an up-tempo techno-trance song with elements of ambient music. It features Spanish guitar and castanets. The lyrics were influenced by and written surrounding the death of Kurt Cobain. The third track, [...] "Good-N-Evil", incorporates elements of industrial music. [...] "Fly" [...] is a mid-tempo song built around a trip hop beat. The album's fifth track and the only ballad on the album, [...] "Distant Land", contains elements of ambient music and features mellow guitar melody. Lyrically, the song is a tale of a woman waking up lost and not knowing where she is, searching for light in a distant land.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Diamonds" [...] is a {{departure}} from Rihanna's recurring themes of unhealthy relationships on her other songs, and contains a prominent concept of love. The first verse introduces the song's concept: [...] "Find light in the beautiful sea / I choose to be happy / You and I, you and I / We're like diamonds in the sky." [...] The hook continues this metaphor: [...] "So shine bright, <b>tonight,</b> <b>you</b> and I / We're beautiful like diamonds in the sky / Eye to eye, so alive." [...] According to Glenn Yoder of The Boston Globe, the song shows Rihanna differently than how she is viewed by the public because of lyrics such as [...] "I choose to be happy" [...] and [...] "We're like diamonds in the sky". James Montgomery of MTV News commented that she embraces the positivity and fulfillment of a realized relationship, particularly with the line [...] "When you hold me, I'm alive", and admits [...] "I knew that we'd become one right away". Lindsay DiMattina of Hollywood.com interpreted that Rihanna is crying out for her lover when she sings lines such as, [...] "When you hold me, I'm alive," [...] and [...] "At first sight I felt the energy of sun rays / I saw the life inside your eyes." [...] The Herald Sun asserted that the lyrics were most likely inspired by Rihanna's private life.|$|E
