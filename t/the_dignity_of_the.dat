5|$|Shareholders in the LSWR were {{concerned}} {{at the impact}} the cemetery scheme {{would have on the}} normal operations of the railway. At a shareholders' meeting in August 1852 concerns were raised about the impact of funeral trains on normal traffic and of the secrecy in which negotiations between the LSWR and the promoters of the cemetery were conducted. The LSWR management pledged that no concessions would be made to the cemetery operators, other than promising them the use of one train each day. Charles Blomfield, Bishop of London was hostile in general to railway funeral schemes, arguing that the noise and speed of the railways was incompatible with the solemnity of the Christian burial service. Blomfield also considered it inappropriate that the families of people from very different backgrounds would potentially have to share a train, and felt that it demeaned <b>the</b> <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deceased for the bodies of respectable members of the community to be carried on a train also carrying the bodies and relatives of those who had led immoral lives.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{constant}} oppression, {{the desire}} of the people for democratic participation in government decisions was strong. Since the Age of Enlightenment, Russian intellectuals had promoted Enlightenment ideals such as <b>the</b> <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual and the rectitude of democratic representation. These ideals were championed most vociferously by Russia’s liberals, although populists, Marxists, and anarchists also claimed to support democratic reforms.

25|$|In 1957, a {{military}} coup overthrew the government of Field Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram with allegations of lèse-majesté, which is an offense against <b>the</b> <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monarch, punishable under Thai law. This began a new and long-lasting relationship between the monarch and military, leading the king to condone the Thammasat University massacre in defense of his throne, and support a series of military dictatorships. Although Bhumibol did invite public criticism in a 2005 speech, the lèse majesté laws have not been revoked by the Thai parliament.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the centuries}} the {{interpretation}} of Mary as an ever virgin bride of the Lord who had taken a vow of perpetual chastity spread and was in full vogue {{by the time of}} Rupert of Deutz in the 12th century. By the 13th century, Thomas Aquinas had fashioned long and detailed theological arguments in defense of the doctrine and stated that a denial of the perpetual virginity of Mary would be derogatory to the perfection of Christ, an insult to the Holy Spirit, and an affront to <b>the</b> <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mother of God.|$|E
25|$|Two very {{effective}} Deys were 'Uthman Dey (1598–1610) and his son-in-law Yusuf Dey (1610–1637). Able administrators, they displayed tact, enhancing <b>the</b> <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> office. Neither being fond of luxury, treasury funds were {{made available for}} public projects and new construction (e.g., a mosque, fortress, barracks, and repair of aqueducts). Rebellious tribes were subdued. A long period of chronic social turbulence in Tunisia was brought to a close. The resulting peace and order allowed for some measure of prosperity.

40|$|Dutch {{elderly people}} who are weary of life are looking for {{assistance}} to end their lives. According to the organizations Nederlandse Vereniging voor een Vrijwillig Levenseinde (NVVE) and Uit Vrije Wil, <b>the</b> <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> these elderly people is under threat. Therefore arguments based on personal dignity were constructed to justify possible assistance for elderly {{men and women in}} this situation. The main question is: “What is <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> in <b>the</b> current Dutch ‘weary of life’ debate?”. This thesis also focuses on <b>the</b> potential role <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> within <b>the</b> Dutch ‘weary <b>of</b> life’-debate. <b>The</b> different categorizations provided by Nordenfelt, Sulmasy, Schultziner and Beyleveld and Brownsword provide different uses and forms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>dignity.</b> <b>The</b> analytical framework, based on dignity as empowerment, <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> identity and inflorescent <b>dignity,</b> shows <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> in <b>the</b> arguments based on personal <b>dignity</b> made by <b>the</b> NVVE and Uit Vrije Wil.

50|$|A {{belief in}} <b>the</b> {{inherent}} <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human person also requires that {{basic human needs}} are adequately met, including food, health care, shelter, etc. The bishops have {{see this as a}} basis for <b>the</b> support <b>of</b> social welfare programs and of governmental economic policies that promote equitable distribution of income and access to essential goods and services.|$|R
25|$|The {{clothing}} West {{depicted in}} this scene was highly controversial at the time. Although the event was relatively recent—only eleven years prior—its subject matter made it a fitting example of the genre of history painting, for which contemporary dress was unsuitable. During the painting, several influential people, including Sir Joshua Reynolds, instructed him to dress the figures in classical attire, and after its completion, George III refused to purchase it because the contemporary clothing compromised <b>the</b> <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> event. The work, however, eventually overcame all objections and helped inaugurate more historically accurate practice in history painting.|$|E
25|$|In the 15th-century the Tinwald Mote near Dumfries {{was still}} the legal head of the barony, where sasine (possession) was given by the {{ceremony}} of handing the grantee, before witnesses, a handful of earth and stone from the head messuage called the Mote near the church of Tynwald. In mediaeval law the barony required a principal residence at which the legal process could be formally transacted, which explains why many such motes as that at Ellon were retained, here by the earls of Buchan, when little else remained of their possessions in the district. The mote still carried <b>the</b> <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earldom.|$|E
25|$|Indrabhuti, {{the oldest}} known king of Sambalpur, founded Vajrayana, while his sister, {{who was married}} to Yuvaraja Jalendra of Lankapuri (Suvarnapur), founded Sahajayana.

The Tantric Buddhist sects made efforts to raise <b>the</b> <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lowest of the low of the society to a higher plane.
