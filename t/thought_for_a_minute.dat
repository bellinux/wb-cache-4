60|$|Hereupon Marble {{made what}} he called a rumpus in good earnest. I <b>thought,</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> he would kick the cabin-doors down.|$|E
60|$|Philip <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two. He was {{so deeply}} moved by her {{distress}} {{that he could}} not think of himself.|$|E
60|$|Dick <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two, {{and then}} {{got up and walked}} about under the trees, keeping his eyes fixed upon the {{branches}} overhead.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of course,' said Hermione, {{lifting her}} face like a rhapsodist, 'there CAN be no reason, no EXCUSE for education, except the joy and beauty of {{knowledge}} in itself.' She seemed to rumble and ruminate with subterranean <b>thoughts</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> then she proceeded: 'Vocational education ISN'T education, it is the close of education.' ...|$|R
60|$|Girdlestone <b>thought</b> intently <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two, {{with his}} great eyebrows drawn {{down over his}} little restless eyes.|$|R
60|$|There was silence. Poirot {{remained}} lost in <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes.</b> Finally {{he turned}} to the lawyer again.|$|R
60|$|The Merry Little Breeze who {{had brought}} him the warning in a capful of smoke <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> Then he called all the other Little Breezes to him.|$|E
6000|$|The {{young man}} <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> 'All right,' he said. 'We're {{supposed}} to be an empty train, and there's no one to blow me up at the other end.' ...|$|E
6000|$|He sank {{away from}} her and brooded over this <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two before he replied. [...] "But the whole thing is so preposterous. Have you seen her slate-writing 'stunt'?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Everyone <b>thought</b> soberly <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> then Meg announced, as if {{the idea}} was {{suggested}} {{by the sight of}} her own pretty hands, [...] "I shall give her a nice pair of gloves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear boy," [...] and Aunt Hannah vainly {{tried to}} raise her head, [...] "I never <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> single <b>minute</b> that you came downstairs for any other purpose than {{to leave the house}} secretly." ...|$|R
60|$|When I have indulged such <b>thoughts</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two, I {{enter the}} mansion, which {{is said to}} have been the gate-house only of the {{original}} building, and find one being on whom time seems to have made little impression; for the Aunt Margaret of to-day bears the same proportional age to the Aunt Margaret of my early youth that the boy of ten years old does to the man of (by'r Lady!) some fifty-six years. The old lady's invariable costume has doubtless some share in confirming one in the opinion that time has stood still with Aunt Margaret.|$|R
6000|$|The {{young man}} <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> [...] "All right," [...] he said. [...] "We're {{supposed}} to be an empty train, and there's no one to blow me up at the other end." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's no {{law against}} selling quack {{medicine}} that I know of," [...] said my aunt. She <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> and became unusually grave. [...] "It's our only chance, George," [...] she said. [...] "If it doesn't go..." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Larkyn <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> of the Laplaces--whom she {{had known}} when Laplace and his wife {{believed}} in each other--and answered:--"I will send it. I think it will do her good. But remember, we must NEVER tell her the truth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> {{that there}} was going to be some dreadful accident, and I was so mad with myself for having made you jump it. If you had broken your leg, how would you have borne it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The debtor irresolutely <b>thought</b> of it <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> and said, 'Perhaps you wouldn't {{object to}} really being her godfather?' ...|$|R
60|$|Tiggle <b>thought</b> hard <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> {{and then}} said he remembered {{sweeping}} the King's rooms and finding a queer thing--that {{might have been an}} umbrella--lying beneath a cabinet. It had ropes and two wooden seats and a wicker basket all attached to the handle.|$|R
6000|$|He <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or {{two before}} he {{answered}} her. Perhaps the man would be more impressed if the message came to him through his wife. [...] "If {{you think that he}} will not be annoyed with you, you may do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|Martha {{pursed her}} little mouth and knitted her brows in <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> Then she said slowly, [...] "I'd {{ask for a}} mug of hot soup, an' a blanket, an' some coals, and--oh! I forgot, a teapot, for ours is cracked an' won't 'old in now." ...|$|E
6000|$|The Squire <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> [...] "This is a {{very serious}} step, Ida," [...] he said. [...] "I don't mean that I think that the man has behaved well--but still he may have given up the {{mortgages}} to Quest under pressure of some sort and might be willing to find the money to meet them." ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{mind was}} not {{equal to the}} effort. She tried to lessen the strain on it--to lose the sense of her own position--to escape from her <b>thoughts</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> only. After <b>a</b> little, she opened Mr. Vanstone's letter, and {{mechanically}} set herself to read it through once more.|$|R
6000|$|... "Command us, Gospodar!" [...] {{they said}} simply, {{as they stood}} to attention. [...] "Shall {{we go to the}} head of the ravine road and there take hiding?" [...] He <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> perhaps <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> whilst we all stood as silent as [...] images. I could hear our hearts beating. Then he said: ...|$|R
6000|$|Father Herman <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> {{and then}} resumed: [...] "A small {{schooner}} is loading at a beach {{not far off}} and I know the patron. He would take you to Arenas, where the president has supporters and {{you might get a}} ship. I think he sails to-night, but I will send a message." ...|$|R
60|$|It was half-past four; {{we had no}} time to lose. I <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> Andrea {{would have}} to go to his mother's and find the needful clothes, then come back; it would all take time, and time meant life and death. Then, the sight of a young and {{beautiful}} woman might arouse the guard's attention, and Giulia might be recognised.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] Mr. Beard {{glanced at}} the band and began to laugh. He thought Jethro a queer customer, no doubt, {{but he was a}} friend of Comrade Prescott's. [...] "By gum!" [...] said Mr. Beard, [...] "I <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> a rebel chain-shot had took my leg off. Well, sir, I guess that band gets about two dollars. They've come in here every evening since I've been at the hotel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense," [...] {{said little}} Hartopp. [...] "If you <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> Prout, {{you would see}} that the 'precocious flow of fetid imagery,' that King {{complains}} of, is borrowed wholesale from King. He 'nursed the pinion that impelled the steel.' Naturally he does not approve. Come into the smoking-room for a minute. It isn't fair to listen to boys; {{but they should be}} now rubbing it into King's house outside. Little things please little minds." ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>thought</b> hard <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes.</b> We were speculating boldly, {{and already}} had {{undertaken}} rather {{more than we}} could manage; but the offer was tempting, and, noting Harry's eagerness, I agreed.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy <b>thought</b> hard <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two. It {{was a very}} tempting offer, {{and wages}} out of that port were {{excellent}} just then. What was more to the purpose, it promised to send {{him back to the}} liners, where a commander was a person of some consequence, and, besides this, Anthea had told him that she was in all probability going to Alaska. Then he reluctantly shook his head.|$|R
60|$|He <b>thought</b> it over <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> {{and as he}} {{had watched}} {{carefully}} from the hedge every motion of the old witch, and listened to her words, he believed he could repeat exactly {{what she had said}} and done.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's the trouble; Arch preaches, and Prince won't stand it. He told Arch {{he was a}} prig and a parson, and Arch {{told him}} he wasn't a gentleman. My boots! weren't they both mad, though! I <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> they'd pitch into one another and have it out. Wish they had, and not gone {{stalking}} round stiff and glum ever since. Mac and I settle our rows with a bat or so over the head, and then we are all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Singleton <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute.</b> 'I did {{not notice}} {{anything}} at the time. Of course it differed from your ordinary voice as I am accustomed to hear it. You see she was crying, with a handkerchief up to her face, and spoke low and hesitatingly. All of which changes the voice. I never doubted it was you, you see, and as I had never heard you speak in low, broken tones, sobbing and crying, any difference {{there may have been}} did not strike me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't know it," [...] said he, [...] "but Captain Guy did a {{good deal}} more than pick up those two women from an {{abandoned}} vessel. You see he was making his way north with a pretty fair wind from the south-west, the first they'd had for several days, and when his lookout sighted La Fidélité nobody on board <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> that he would try to beat up to her, for she lay a long way to the west of his course, though pretty well in sight.|$|E
60|$|It didn't sound a {{comfortable}} plan, Alice <b>thought,</b> and <b>for</b> <b>a</b> few <b>minutes</b> she walked on in silence, puzzling over the idea, and {{every now and}} then stopping to help the poor Knight, who certainly was NOT a good rider.|$|R
6000|$|Tarzan <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> long <b>minute</b> {{and then}} he spoke. [...] "Ja-don," [...] he said, [...] "was {{one of the few}} who {{believed}} in me and who wished to accord me fair treatment. I have a debt to pay to Ja-don and an account to settle with Lu-don, not alone on my own behalf, but principally upon that of my mate. I will go with you Ja-don to mete to Lu-don the punishment he deserves. Tell me, chief, how may the Dor-ul-Otho best serve his father's people?" ...|$|R
60|$|Frank <b>thought</b> hard <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> or two. There was {{no doubt}} that ranching, when it {{included}} clearing land, as it generally seemed to do, was remarkably arduous work. In {{the case of a}} man with little money it evidently meant almost incessant toil, for it was only by persistent effort that one could chop and saw up the great trees and grub the stumps out. Still, he was growing fond of it, and, what was more, he was conscious that he was gaining a resolution and muscular vigor that in all probability he would never have acquired in the crowded cities.|$|R
