40|$|The {{celebration of}} <b>the</b> Thirteenth <b>Amendment</b> in many Essays {{prepared}} for this Symposium may be premature. That <b>the</b> Thirteenth <b>Amendment</b> arguably protects a different and, perhaps, wider array of rights than <b>the</b> Fourteenth <b>Amendment</b> may be {{less important than the}} less controversial claim that <b>the</b> Fourteenth <b>Amendment</b> was ratified after <b>the</b> Thirteenth <b>Amendment.</b> If <b>the</b> Fourteenth <b>Amendment</b> covers similar ground as <b>the</b> Thirteenth <b>Amendment,</b> but protects a narrower set of rights than <b>the</b> Thirteenth <b>Amendment,</b> then <b>the</b> proper inference may be that <b>the</b> Fourteenth <b>Amendment</b> repealed or modified crucial rights originally protected by <b>the</b> Thirteenth <b>Amendment.</b> <b>The</b> broad interpretation of <b>the</b> Thirteenth <b>Amendment,</b> which is increasingly in vogue in certain progressive circles, may have been good constitutional law only between 1865 and 1868. For purposes of argument, this Essay assumes that the participants in this Symposium correctly interpret <b>the</b> original Thirteenth <b>Amendment</b> when they construe the constitutional ban on slavery broadly in order to protect a wide variety of fundamental rights. Rather than interpret <b>the</b> Fourteenth <b>Amendment</b> as adding to the Thirteenth, however, this Essay explores the textual and political evidence supporting claims that <b>the</b> Fourteenth <b>Amendment</b> diminished <b>the</b> rights protected by <b>the</b> Thirteenth <b>Amendment</b> or, more accurately, diminished the likelihood that any of <b>the</b> post-Civil War <b>Amendments</b> would be interpreted as protecting rights that might have been protected by a freestanding Thirteenth Amendment.

5|$|The Supreme Court has {{eventually}} adopted {{some elements}} of Harlan's approach, holding that only some Bill of Rights guarantees were applicable against the states—the doctrine known as selective incorporation. However, under Chief Justice Earl Warren during the 1960s, {{an increasing number of}} rights were deemed sufficiently fundamental for incorporation (Harlan regularly dissented from these rulings). Hence, the majority of provisions from the Bill of Rights have been extended to the states; the exceptions are <b>the</b> Third <b>Amendment,</b> <b>the</b> grand jury clause of <b>the</b> Fifth <b>Amendment,</b> <b>the</b> Seventh <b>Amendment,</b> <b>the</b> excessive bail provision of <b>the</b> Eighth <b>Amendment,</b> <b>the</b> Ninth <b>Amendment,</b> and <b>the</b> Tenth <b>Amendment.</b> Thus, although <b>the</b> Supreme Court has agreed with Harlan's general reasoning, the end result of its jurisprudence is very different from what Harlan advocated.|$|R
5|$|On July 20, 1868, Secretary of State William H.

50|$|Alternatively, <b>the</b> <b>amendments</b> {{to section}} 8 of the ISA {{did not come}} within the {{legislative}} powers conferred by Article 149 as amended since the article {{should be given a}} strict interpretation. <b>The</b> <b>amendments</b> were therefore void. Further arguments made were that as <b>the</b> <b>amendments</b> were passed to deprive the applicant of the fruits of her victory in the previous case, to authorize her illegal detention and to retrospectively deny her the right to appeal to the Privy Council, <b>the</b> <b>amendments</b> denied her right to equal protection of the law and were accordingly void under Article 12. <b>The</b> <b>amendments</b> were alleged to violate the separation of powers between the various branches of government, by usurping the power of the independent judiciary for the impartial determination on the question as to whether the executives decision to detain the applicant was in fact based on national security considerations. <b>The</b> <b>amendments</b> were a direct disposal of the applicants proceedings by the legislature itself, and were therefore judicial acts and not law within Article 5(1). Parliament was also limited in its power to amend the constitution and had overstepped the limits by amending the basic structure of the Constitution.|$|R
