5|$|Cholangitis can be life-threatening, and is {{regarded}} as a medical emergency. Characteristic symptoms include yellow discoloration of the skin or whites of the eyes, fever, abdominal pain, and in severe cases, low blood pressure and confusion. Initial treatment is with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> an underlying problem (such as gallstones or narrowing in the bile duct) for which further tests and treatments may be necessary, usually in the form of endoscopy to relieve obstruction of the bile duct. The word is from Greek chol-, bile + ang-, vessel + -itis, inflammation.|$|E
5|$|DKA most {{frequently}} occurs {{in those who}} already have diabetes, {{but it may also}} be the first presentation in someone who had not previously been known to be diabetic. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> a particular underlying problem that has led to the DKA episode; this may be intercurrent illness (pneumonia, influenza, gastroenteritis, a urinary tract infection), pregnancy, inadequate insulin administration (e.g. defective insulin pen device), myocardial infarction (heart attack), stroke or the use of cocaine. Young people with recurrent episodes of DKA may have an underlying eating disorder, or may be using insufficient insulin for fear that it will cause weight gain.|$|E

5|$|Each {{of these}} priests, either as secular clergy, or as previously, {{members of a}} {{religious}} order, is obligated to say the “Holy Office” every day. To this end, cathedrals normally {{have a number of}} small chapels used for private devotion or for small groups. In England there is a strong tradition that each chapel should face the east. For this reason the transepts of English cathedrals are longer than those in most other countries, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> a second transept, as at Salisbury. This arrangement permits a greater number of eastward-facing chapels. That part of the main interior which is furthest to the east and reserved for the prayers of the clergy is the presbytery.|$|E
5|$|The Rover {{section is}} open to any young adults {{between the ages of}} 18 and 30. The Rover {{programme}} focuses on their motto of 'Service', which has 3 aspects - service to the community, service to the Scout Movement and service to oneself. Rovers are not necessarily adult leaders of Scout Troops, although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> some overlap. The Rover section has historically been open to young men and women, even prior to Cubbing and Scouting being opened to girls.|$|E
5|$|The body of {{the soft}} tick, family Argasidae, is pear-shaped or oval with a rounded {{anterior}} portion. The mouthparts cannot be seen from above as {{they are on the}} ventral surface. The cuticle is leathery; <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> a centrally positioned dorsal plate, with ridges which project slightly above the surrounding surface, but there is no decoration. A pattern of small, circular depressed areas show where muscles are attached to the interior of the integument. The eyes are {{on the sides of the}} body, the spiracles open between legs 3 and 4, and males and females only differ in the structure of the genital pore.|$|E

5|$|There are {{significantly}} fewer bughouse openings {{than there are}} chess openings. Many chess openings create weaknesses which can be easily exploited in bughouse. It is for instance not recommended to move pawns other than the d- and e-pawns. Bughouse openings are generally geared towards dominating vital squares and fast development. Captured pieces become available {{after the first few}} moves and it is important to develop at this stage as <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> not enough time to do so later. Development also helps to defend against early piece drop attacks.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> {{a fierce}} rivalry {{between the two}} strongest teams in a {{national}} league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid is known as El Clásico. From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Catalonia and Castile, {{as well as of}} the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between Catalans and the Castilians, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.|$|E
5|$|While historians value {{contemporary}} skaldic poetry highly as {{the most}} accurate source available, {{it must be remembered}} that the poems are not preserved independently but as quotations in the kings' sagas. After two centuries of oral preservation, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> doubt that a verse was accurately remembered and correctly attributed. Furthermore, skaldic poetry did not primarily aim at giving information but at artistically rendering facts already known to the hearers. Historians frequently fall back on the less reliable but more detailed accounts of the sagas.|$|E

5|$|Due to the 'challenge' {{format of}} Stanley Cup play before 1915, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> {{confusion}} {{about how many}} Stanley Cups the Senators should be given credit for: nine, ten or eleven. The Senators were Stanley Cup champions {{at the end of}} nine hockey seasons without dispute. In another two seasons, 1905–06 and 1909–10, the Senators won Stanley Cup challenges but were not champions {{at the end of the}} season. The Hockey Hall of Fame and the National Hockey League agree that the Senators of 1906 were champions but disagree on whether the Senators were champions in 1910. In both seasons, the Senators were the undisputed defending champions, and during that year's hockey season, the Senators won Stanley Cup challenges. However, by the end of both hockey seasons, they were no longer holders of the Stanley Cup.|$|E
5|$|Every {{participant}} at the Paralympics {{has their}} disability grouped {{into one of}} five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly {{under one of the}} other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability.|$|E
5|$|Finally <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> a need {{to correct}} for the {{apparent}} movement of the stars. On the timescale of human civilisation the stars have largely maintained the same position relative to each other. Each night they appear to rotate around the celestial poles due to the Earth's rotation about its axis. However, the Earth spins rather like a spinning top. Not only does the Earth rotate, it wobbles. The Earth's axis takes around 25,800 years to complete one full wobble. The effect to the archaeoastronomer is that stars did not rise over the horizon {{in the past in}} the same places as they do today. Nor did the stars rotate around Polaris as they do now. In the case of the Egyptian pyramids, it has been shown they were aligned towards Thuban, a faint star in the constellation of Draco. The effect can be substantial over relatively short lengths of time, historically speaking. For instance a person born on 25 December in Roman times would have been born with the sun in the constellation Capricorn. In the modern period a person born on the same date would have the sun in Sagittarius due to the precession of the equinoxes.|$|E

5|$|In {{veterinary}} practice, {{dogs are}} the species most commonly affected by hypothyroidism. The {{majority of cases}} occur {{as a result of}} primary hypothyroidism, of which two types are recognized: lymphocytic thyroiditis, which is probably immune-driven and leads to destruction and fibrosis of the thyroid gland, and idiopathic atrophy, which leads to the gradual replacement of the gland by fatty tissue. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> lethargy, cold intolerance, exercise intolerance, and weight gain. Furthermore, skin changes and fertility problems are seen in dogs with hypothyroidism, {{as well as a number}} of other symptoms. The signs of myxedema can be seen in dogs, with prominence of skin folds on the forehead, and cases of myxedema coma are encountered. The diagnosis can be confirmed by blood test, as the clinical impression alone may lead to overdiagnosis. Lymphocytic thyroiditis is associated with detectable antibodies against thyroglobulin, although they typically become undetectable in advanced disease. Treatment is with thyroid hormone replacement.|$|E
5|$|Most nuthatches are {{woodland}} {{birds and}} the majority are found in coniferous or other evergreen forests, although each species has a preference for a particular tree type. The strength of the association varies from the Corsican nuthatch, which is closely linked with Corsican pine, to the catholic habitat of the Eurasian nuthatch, which prefers deciduous or mixed woods but breeds in coniferous forests {{in the north of}} its extensive range. However, the two species of rock nuthatches are not strongly tied to woodlands: they breed on rocky slopes or cliffs, although both move into wooded areas when not breeding. In parts of Asia where several species occur in the same geographic region, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> an altitudinal separation in their preferred habitats.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{intercourse}} is {{the major}} mode of HIV transmission. Both X4 and R5 HIV {{are present in the}} seminal fluid, which is passed from a male to his sexual partner. The virions can then infect numerous cellular targets and disseminate into the whole organism. However, a selection process leads to a predominant transmission of the R5 virus through this pathway. In patients infected with subtype B HIV-1, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> a co-receptor switch in late-stage disease and T-tropic variants appear that can infect a variety of T cells through CXCR4. These variants then replicate more aggressively with heightened virulence that causes rapid T cell depletion, immune system collapse, and opportunistic infections that mark the advent of AIDS. Thus, during the course of infection, viral adaptation to the use of CXCR4 instead of CCR5 may be a key step in the progression to AIDS. A number of studies with subtype B-infected individuals have determined that between 40 and 50 percent of AIDS patients can harbour viruses of the SI and, it is presumed, the X4 phenotypes.|$|E

5|$|Strategic design {{management}} involves {{the creation of}} strategic long-term vision and planning for design, and deals with defining the role of design within the company. The goal of strategic {{design management}} is to support and strengthen the corporate visio by creating {{a relationship between the}} design and corporate strategy. It includes the creation of design, brand and product strategies, ensuring that design management becomes a central element in the corporate strategy formulation process. Strategic design management is responsible for {{the development and implementation of}} a corporate design programme that influences the design vision, mission, and positioning. It allows design to interact with the needs of corporate management and focuses on the long-term capabilities of design. Where strategic design management is applied, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> a strong belief in the potential to differentiate the company and gain competitive advantage by design. As a result, design thinking becomes integrated into the corporate culture. Depending on the type of company and industry the following job titles are associated with this function: design strategist, strategic design manager, chief design officer, vice president design and innovation, chief creative officer, innovation design director, and others.|$|E
5|$|The Internet is of {{interest}} to sociologists in various ways; most practically {{as a tool for}} research and as a discussion platform. The sociology of the Internet in the broad sense regards the analysis of online communities (e.g. newsgroups, social networking sites) and virtual worlds, thus <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> overlap with community sociology. Online communities may be studied statistically through network analysis or interpreted qualitatively through virtual ethnography. Moreover, organizational change is catalysed through new media, thereby influencing social change at-large, perhaps forming the framework for a transformation from an industrial to an informational society. One notable text is Manuel Castells' The Internet Galaxy—the title of which forms an inter-textual reference to Marshall McLuhan's The Gutenberg Galaxy. Closely related to the sociology of the Internet, is digital sociology, which expands the scope of study to address not only the internet but also the impact of the other digital media and devices that have emerged since {{the first decade of the}} twenty-first century.|$|E
5|$|The winter fur is dense, {{but short}} and closely fitting. In {{northern}} subspecies, the fur {{is soft and}} silky, but coarse in southern forms. The summer fur is very short, sparser and rougher. The upper parts in the summer fur are dark, but vary geographically from dark-tawny or dark-chocolate to light pale tawny or sandy. The lower parts, including the lower jaw and inner sides of the legs, are white. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>often</b> a brown spot {{at the corner of}} the mouth. The dividing line between the dark upper and light lower parts is usually straight but sometimes forms an irregular line. The tail is brown, and sometimes the tip is a little darker but it is never black. In the northern part of its range and at high altitudes, the least weasel changes colour in the winter, the coat becoming pure white and exhibiting a few black hairs in rare circumstances.|$|E
