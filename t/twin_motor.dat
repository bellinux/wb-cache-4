5000|$|... 1994 was {{the year}} in which Honda's Mick Doohan began to stamp his {{authority}} on the Grand Prix world. Honda's Longtime sponsor Rothmans left Honda to join Williams Renault in Formula One. Doohan won 9 races, the most since Giacomo Agostini won 11 in 1972. Kevin Schwantz was injured in a pre-season bicycle crash and raced in 6 races with his arm in plaster. Luca Cadalora took over from Wayne Rainey on the Yamaha and won two races. Aprilia began campaigning in the 500cc class with a 250 V <b>twin</b> <b>motor</b> enlarged to 380cc in hopes of using its lighter weight and nimble handling as an advantage.|$|E
5000|$|In the UK, {{a number}} of limited edition {{locomotives}} have been commissioned by model retailers. Heljan models of the British Rail Class 14 and Class 28 [...] "Co-Bo" [...] diesel locomotives {{as well as the}} LMS 2-6-0+0-6-2 Beyer Garratt with <b>twin</b> <b>motor</b> design and working coal pusher are available through Hattons of Liverpool. Several different models of the iconic LNER EM1 and EM2 DC Electric locomotives constructed for use on the Woodhead Route are currently being produced for Olivia's Trains of Sheffield (terminus of the Woodhead line). A Midland Pullman is also planned. Several standard Heljan models have been produced in special, limited edition, liveries for particular retailers or UK railway modelling magazines. The standard Falcon, Kestrel and Lion models are all high volume limited editions.|$|E
25|$|In August 1952 Taruffi {{protected}} {{a racing}} car design under patent 2,608, 264. The patent had three torpedo-shaped parallel bodies joined together. Independent <b>twin</b> <b>motors</b> and wheels {{were in the}} two larger bodies, at left and right. The driver and the passengers sit in the car's central part. The central portion is both higher and smaller than the others. Taruffi commented on the low wind resistance and low centre of gravity of his design.|$|R

50|$|It was {{designed}} as a contender with the Tamiya Clod Buster which was released two years earlier. Both were 4WD monster trucks with four wheel steering and four wheel drive using <b>twin</b> <b>motors,</b> one to each gearbox. Both trucks used a single servo to steer and another to run a heavy duty mechanical speed controller, so they were easily controlled with a common two channel radio. Both trucks came with a set of eight friction type shocks and 27 turn RS-540 motors.|$|R
50|$|Ikarus 215 was {{designed}} by engineer constructor Dušan Stankov, and was originally designed before the World War II as a Zmaj R-1 multi-purpose fighter - bomber - but the scout redesigned given the available engines and purpose. The prototype first flew in 1949. The aircraft was of mixed construction, <b>twin</b> <b>motor</b> low with a crew of two to four (depending on the purpose of aircraft). The main landing gear wheels are retracted into the motor housing back, while the tail is not he penetrates. Prototype Ikarus 215 are driven by two piston engines Ranger line SVG-770 C-B1, with twelve-cylinder air-cooled. Wing aircraft have had a wooden structure lined with plywood, was the trapezoid-shaped wings and the ends were rounded. The construction of the fuselage was made from an oval-shaped duralumin covered cardboard timber.|$|E
50|$|The styling of the TAs {{resembled the}} A {{units of the}} {{contemporary}} EA and E1 built in 1937, but the single 1200 hp Winton 201-A motor provided only two thirds {{the power of the}} E-units' 1800 hp <b>twin</b> <b>motor</b> arrangement, the TAs were shorter and lighter, and they rode two-axle rather than three-axle trucks. Future locomotives for high speed and long distance passenger service would follow the direction taken by the EA/EB, E1 and E2; EMC's FT locomotives introduced in 1939 would adapt the single-engine two-axle truck layout of the TA and the cab/booster format of the E units to freight service. With the introduction of the E-series and the TA units EMC undertook regular production of locomotives of their own design, opening the standardized mass production phase in marketing Diesel power for passenger service.|$|E
5000|$|However, their 500 cc Grand Prix bikes {{failed to}} attain the same success. They began campaigning in the 500cc class in 1994 with a 250 V <b>twin</b> <b>motor</b> {{enlarged}} to 380cc in hopes of using its lighter weight and nimble handling as an advantage against the heavier, V4 engine bikes used by the competition. The bike eventually displaced 430cc and had its best result with a third place by rider Doriano Romboni at the 1997 Dutch TT but, could never overcome power disadvantage during the starting line sprint and was withdrawn {{at the end of}} the [...] season for further development. Their first MotoGP effort, dubbed the RS Cube, was technically advanced but difficult to ride and performed poorly in the championship. The Cube did, however, pioneer many advanced technologies including ride by wire throttle and pneumatic valve actuation systems. Aprilia left the MotoGP class at the end of [...] and then left the lower classes when two-stroke engines were banned. Aprilia set the record for the most points earned by a manufacturer in a single season from the 125cc class with 410 points in [...] It was also the highest points earned by a constructor in Grand Prix motorcycle racing's history until [...] when 420 points were won by the same bikes winning 16 out of 17 races.|$|E

50|$|It is possible, however, {{to mount}} a regular <b>Twin</b> Cam <b>motor</b> to a pre-2000 Softail (or any chassis that accepts an Evolution engine), through {{third-party}} adapters.|$|R
50|$|Nordenfelt then {{built the}} Nordenfelt II (Abdülhamid) in 1886 and Nordenfelt III (Abdülmecid) in 1887, {{a pair of}} 30 metre long {{submarines}} with twin torpedo tubes, for the Ottoman Navy. Abdülhamid became the first submarine in history to fire a torpedo while submerged under water. Nordenfelt's efforts culminated in 1887 with the Nordenfelt IV which had <b>twin</b> <b>motors</b> and <b>twin</b> torpedoes. It was sold to the Russians, but proved unstable and ran aground off Jutland; when the Russians refused to pay for it, it was scrapped.|$|R
50|$|Dąbrowski's {{greatest}} {{achievement was}} {{the design of}} a very advanced medium bomber PZL.37 Łoś, even though he had not worked on an airplane of this type and size. PZL submitted a proposal in response to the specification issued by the Departament Aeronautyki (Department of Aeronautics) in 1934 for a <b>twin</b> <b>motor</b> bomber capable of carrying a load of 2000 kg (including 300 kg bombs) with speed in excess of 350 km/h and a range of 1200 km. Dąbrowski's preliminary design won an internal PZL contest for the new plane and in the fall of 1934 Dąbrowski became chief engineer of the project. The all-metal aircraft with a large elliptical wing and aerodynamically profiled fuselage had superb flying qualities. The requirement to cary bombs in the wing resulted in the development of an elongated aerodynamic cross-section with excellent qualities, later identified as a laminar flow airfoil. The PZL.37 could carry more than 5000 lb of bombs (2500 kg) over a distance of 900 miles (1500 km) and 2200 lb (1000 kg) over 1400 miles (2200 km - to Moscow and back?), however the Polish Air Force did not have a clear philosophy for the use of such plane. Over 100 were produced by the outbreak of World War II, the last few being the first aircraft manufactured at the new Mielec plant in southern Poland. Only 36 Łoś' were in active bomber units before the Invasion of Poland. A further 18 were in reserve at the Małaszewicze base and a dozen in training. The remainder of the aircraft was being finished slowly at the PZL factories in Warsaw and Mielec, with the main emphasis shifting to the production of fighters. During that time Dąbrowski designed a very promising low-wing fighter with inline engine, PZL.62, but the war prevented its development.|$|E
