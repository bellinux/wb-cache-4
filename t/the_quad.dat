40|$|A {{mathematical}} tool {{is developed}} {{for evaluation of}} antenna radiation pattern effects on the shuttle orbiter S band quad antennas. A ray optics approach is used which includes multiple internal reflections with special consideration to reflection from the metallic orbiter skin. Significant depolarization may occur as the angle from the normal increases. The effect of changing tile thickness on the beamwidth of <b>the</b> upper <b>quads</b> versus <b>the</b> lower <b>quads</b> results in a small increase in <b>the</b> lower <b>quad</b> beamwidth compared with the beamwidth in <b>the</b> upper <b>quads.</b> <b>The</b> optimization and evaluation of <b>the</b> S band <b>quads</b> and <b>the</b> computer tool developed {{may be used to}} evaluate other shuttle orbiter antennas...|$|R

40|$|The Next Linear Collider main linacs are 13 km {{linear accelerators}} which each contain approxi-mately 750 hybrid iron/permanent-magnet quadrupoles in a FODO array. The {{small amount of}} ver-tical {{emittance}} dilution permitted in the main linacs implies a tight tolerance on the RMS distance between the beam and the centers of <b>the</b> <b>quads.</b> We describe two methods for measuring the off-sets between <b>the</b> <b>quads</b> and their integrated beam position monitors, and three algorithms for steering the main linac to minimize the emittance dilution. Simulation studies of the alignment and steering algorithms are presented...|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Quad</b> Electrostatic Loudspeaker (ESL) is the world's first {{production}} full-range electrostatic loudspeaker, {{launched in}} 1957 by Quad Electroacoustics, {{then known as}} the Acoustical Manufacturing Co. Ltd. The speaker is shaped somewhat like a home electric radiator curved slightly on the vertical axis. They are widely admired for their clarity and precision, but known to be difficult speakers to run and maintain.|$|E
5|$|The design's lack of {{structural}} integrity {{is seen as}} another significant weakness of <b>the</b> <b>Quad</b> ESL-63 since its inception, and lived on in its various successors. Other shortcomings include very limited sound pressure levels, meaning that it won't play loud, and its bass response was lacking. In addition, one reviewer experienced problems with shut-downs playing music with high intensity bass drums.|$|E
