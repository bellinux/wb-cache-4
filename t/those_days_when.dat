In <b>those</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> the presidential campaign did not begin in earnest until September, Hanna had planned a vacation while McKinley anticipated a quiet summer. [...] The Republicans were caught by surprise by the wave of enthusiasm that Bryan's speech and nomination caused, and scuttled these plans; as Hanna wrote to McKinley on July 16, [...] "the Chicago convention has changed everything".|$|E

James M.

[...] A few newspapers published articles about the long flights, but no reporters or photographers had been there. The lack of splashy eyewitness press coverage was a major reason for disbelief in Washington, D.C. and Europe and in journals like Scientific American, whose editors doubted the [...] "alleged experiments" [...] and asked how U.S. newspapers, [...] "alert as they are, allowed these sensational performances to escape their notice." ...|$|E

500|$|On October 2, 1938, Feller was the {{starting}} pitcher against the Detroit Tigers. Detroit's Hank Greenberg was {{two home runs}} short of Babe Ruth's then-single-season record of 60 home runs. By the ninth inning, Feller had recorded 16 strikeouts, one fewer than the MLB record in a nine-inning game. He tied the record when he struck out Detroit's Pete Fox and passed it, to set a modern major league record of 18 strikeouts, when he struck out Chet Laabs {{for the fifth time}} that day. Greenberg said, [...] "Feller's curve was jumping wickedly and with that and his fast ball, he was murder." [...] Feller did not earn a win, however, as the Indians lost, 4–1. [...] "It was one of <b>those</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> everything feels perfect, your arm, your coordination, your concentration, everything. There was drama in the air because of Greenberg's attempt to break Ruth's record, and the excitement grew even greater when my strikeouts started to add up", Feller said. For the 1938 season, Feller led all pitchers with 208 walks and 240 strikeouts. In 1939, Feller received his first career Opening Day start against the Tigers after a match against the Browns was rained out. He won the game 5–1, after allowing three hits. On Mother's Day, Feller pitched against the Chicago White Sox with his family in attendance. One pitch was fouled off by Marv Owen into the seats and into the face of Feller's mother; he {{went on to win the}} game. Feller finished the 1939 season having led the AL in wins (24), complete games (24) and innings pitched (296.2) and led the majors for a second consecutive year in both walks (142) and strikeouts (246).|$|E

Since fasting before communion was the rule in the ancient church, the ninth hour suggested itself as the appropriate time to offer the Patarag. Thus, a service which contained the readings and much of the prayers from the Patarag was added after the Ninth Hour for <b>those</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> no Patarag would be celebrated.|$|E

2500|$|Smith found that, at the time, nobody {{believed}} in her concept of stylish activewear.

He recalls that when he explained the clothes should not be sold in the sports section, [...] "The buyer {{looked at me like}} I was crazy. They had no box to put me in." [...] Eventually, Myer bought a small range for five of their stores and stocked it in a corner between swimwear and lingerie.
