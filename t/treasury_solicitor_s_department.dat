40|$|Conference organizers, {{speakers}} and/or moderators included University of Colorado School of Law professors David H. Getches, Michael A. Gheleta, Teresa Rice, Elizabeth Ann (Betsy) Rieke and Charles F. Wilkinson. In {{the face}} of numerous proposals for privatizing, marketing, and changing the management of public lands, the Natural Resources Law Center will hold its third annual fall public lands conference October 11 - 13, at the CU School of Law in Boulder. A panel of public land users and neighbors, including timber, grazing, mining, recreation, and environmental interests, will address current discontent with public land policy and management. There will also be discussion of proposals to dispose of federal public lands, alternatives to disposal, and rationales for retaining public lands under federal ownership and management. Another topic that will be addressed is shared public land decisionmaking in which traditionally governmental decisions and policies are made with local, private people and groups taking leadership. Thirty four speakers representing {{a wide variety of}} perspectives will address such questions as: Is the original purpose of producing public benefits being realized by keeping lands in public ownership? Can this purpose be better achieved by changing the ownership of lands? Or is the real question how the lands are managed? Lunch speakers include prominent law Professor Joseph L. Sax, now Counselor to the Secretary, U. <b>S.</b> <b>Department</b> of the Interior; John D. Leshy, <b>Solicitor,</b> U. <b>S.</b> <b>Department</b> of the Interior; and Senator Frank H.
