500|$|In late 1898 Karim's {{purchase}} of a parcel of land adjacent to his earlier grant was finalised; {{he had become a}} wealthy man. Reid claimed in his diary that he had challenged Karim over his financial dealings: [...] "You have told the Queen that in India no receipts are given for money, and therefore you ought not to give any to Sir F Edwards [...] This is a lie and means <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> to cheat the Queen." [...] The Munshi told the Queen he would provide receipts in answer to the allegations, and Victoria wrote to Reid dismissing the accusations, calling them [...] "shameful".|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert, {{writing in}} the Chicago Sun-Times, awarded the film {{three out of four}} stars. He praised the [...] "convincing" [...] acting and [...] "realistic {{locations}} and terse dialogue" [...] but questioned the verisimilitude of the story and concluded, [...] "Body of Lies contains enough you can believe, or almost believe, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> so much of it weren't sensationally implausible." [...] Kenneth Turan reached the same conclusion in the Los Angeles Times, [...] "The skill of top-flight director Ridley Scott and his veteran production team, not to mention the ability of stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe, ensure that this story of spies and terrorism in the Middle East is always crisp and watchable," [...] he writes, [...] "but as the film's episodic story gradually reveals itself, it ends up too unconvincing and conventional to consistently hold our attention." [...] Lou Lumenick in the New York Post writes that, [...] "There's nothing here we haven't seen in many other movies" [...] and Lisa Kennedy in the Denver Post summarised: [...] "Body of Lies is an A-list project with B-game results. The movie might be set in the Age of Jihad. But the rules of trust and mistrust are wholly familiar." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw wrote, [...] "I felt {{occasionally}} that Owen's rumpled performance {{is in danger}} of becoming a little one-note ... but this is still an unexpectedly well–made thriller with brainpower as well as firepower". Philip French, in his review for The Observer, called the film a [...] "slick, fast-moving conspiracy thriller" [...] and the gunfight in the Guggenheim [...] "spectacular". In his review for The Independent, Anthony Quinn wrote, [...] "It's reasonably efficient, passably entertaining, and strenuously playing catch-up with the Bourne movies: flat-footed Owen doesn't look as good as Matt Damon sprinting through city streets, and the editing doesn't match Paul Greengrass's whiplash pace". The New Yorker magazine's David Denby wrote, [...] "And there's a big hole {{in the middle of the}} movie: the director, Tom Tykwer, and the screenwriter, Eric Warren Singer, forgot to make their two crusaders human beings". In his review for The New York Post, Lou Lumenick wrote, [...] "There, an anticlimactic rooftop chase reminds us that Tykwer, the German director who reinvented the Euro thriller with Run, Lola, Run a decade ago, has been far surpassed by Paul Greengrass and the Bourne adventures, yet thankfully lacking the rampant and nonsensical roller-coaster style of editing, where no shot lingers for longer than a nano-second.". A.O. Scott, in his review for The New York Times, wrote, [...] "The International, in contrast, is so undistinguished that the moments you remember best are those <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> another, more original director had tackled". Citing the climatic shoot-out in the Guggenheim, hailed by other critics as spectacular, Scott wonders if another, such as Brian de Palma could have [...] "turned into a fugue of architectural paranoia"? ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{had better}} {{go to your}} mother now, hadn't you?" [...] he said, with what seemed like perfect calm. [...] "You said just now <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>wished</b> to speak to her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I must know," [...] she insisted. [...] "Have I not the right? Tell me now: Was it <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>wished</b> {{to see my}} {{face again}} before they gave me over to the grave?" ...|$|R
500|$|In {{adapting}} the film, a few adjustments were made, such as changing {{the names of}} the protagonists to Owen and Abby, and moving the setting from the Stockholm suburb of Blackeberg to [...] "a small New Mexico town." [...] Reeves was also asked to change the ages of the main characters, but he refused, saying that [...] "would ruin the essence of the story and change everything completely…we need that childlike innocence." [...] He also told his actors to not watch the original film beforehand so [...] "we could make our own version but stay very true to the essence of the story." [...] The filmmakers have noted that [...] "they intend to forge a unique identity for Let Me In, placing it firmly in an American context", {{while at the same time}} paying respect to the original. In comparing his adaptation to the Swedish one, Reeves admitted to not adding many different details from the book that weren't in the original film, stating that [...] "the story was so big that you couldn't really add a lot of stuff in without taking away the focus of the coming of age story so I tried to have allusions and references to stuff in the book." [...] Reeves also admitted to borrowing elements from the Swedish film, stating [...] "There are things that [...] adapted brilliantly in the movie and I borrowed from that because I thought he did a great adaptation. But there are some things that hopefully don't detract and fit into the context of the story. It's a mixture of details from the book, the original film and things that grew out of adapting it." [...] In {{adapting the}} story for American audiences, Reeves stated that keeping the 1980s time period within the film was critical in exploring the theme of good and evil. He used Ronald Reagan's [...] "evil empire speech" [...] as an example of American thought during that period. Reeves stated, [...] "The idea of Reagan's 'evil empire' speech and that whole sort of school of thought was that evil was something that was outside of us. Evil was 'Other,' it was over there, it was the Soviets". Reeves felt that this idea was central to the main character Owen, as he [...] "would be grappling with these very, very dark feelings but being in a kind of American town where there was that sort of [...] mindset and religiousness. How would you fit in? How would you feel about yourself being confused and being 12 or 13 years old and not knowing what it means <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> you could kill those kids who were terrorizing you every day? The humanity of that." ...|$|E
2500|$|... “The Honorable Elijah Muhammad {{said these}} planes {{were used to}} set up {{mountains}} on the earth. The Qur'an says it like this: We have raised mountains on the earth lest it convulse with you. How do you raise a mountain, {{and what is the}} purpose of a mountain? Have you ever tried to balance a tire? You use weights to keep the tire balanced. That's how the earth is balanced, with mountain ranges. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad said that we have a type of bomb that, when it strikes the earth a drill on it is timed to go into the earth and explode at the height <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> the mountain to be. If you wish to take the mountain up a mile (1.6 km), you time the drill to go a mile (1.6 km) in and then explode. The bombs these planes have are timed to go one mile (1.6 km) down and bring up a mountain one mile (1.6 km) high, but it will destroy everything within a 50-square-mile (130 km²) radius. The white man writes in his above top secret memos of the UFOs. He sees them around his military installations like they are spying.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{wished to}} see me?" [...] she asked, a little hesitatingly, {{as she reached}} the bottom stair. [...] "I thought I heard you tell my servant <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>wished</b> {{to speak to her}} mistress." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Nay, I did {{not mean}} to press you,' said Lord Ormersfield, gently; 'but I thought, since James has had the {{fellowship}} and Clara has been at school, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>wished</b> to give up your pupils.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So {{you have}} {{returned}} from your ride, Miss Clifford, {{and perhaps it}} was as well that the thought came from <b>you</b> to me <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>wished</b> me to meet you here in this very place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mullins {{tells me}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> to see me," [...] {{she said the}} merest conventionality to break the disconcerting, uneasy silence.|$|E

60|$|Chairman.

6000|$|... "I am afraid," [...] I said, [...] "that I am out of candles--and oil. I got {{a little}} overtired walking here, and my foot slipped in the dark. Did I {{understand}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>wished</b> to see me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{said that}} I would {{do as you}} bade me, and so I will. I {{would have done it}} sooner if I had known <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>wished</b> it. I would never have worn it at all if I had thought <b>that</b> <b>you</b> disliked it." ...|$|R

"My dear Helène," [...] he said, {{placing a}} chair for her, [...] "if I {{had had the}} least idea <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>wished</b> to see me, I would have let you know my whereabouts.

6000|$|... "Lady Glencora, I {{really must}} say that such a cross-questioning from one lady to another is very unusual. I have promised not to be offended, unless I thought <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>wished</b> to offend me. But do not drive me too far." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You did quite right, Ned, quite right," [...] said Mr Shirley, {{when his}} nephew had concluded; [...] "and now I'll {{tell you what}} I want you to do. You told me the other day, I think, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>wished</b> to become a farmer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is it true <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> {{to remain}} with Effie and Tishy? That's what your mother calls it when she means that you will give me up.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not I. Nor {{is that my}} idea of marriage. Tell {{your father}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> to go with me, and then he will let us have the money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Suppose I {{tell you}} all <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> to know,". said Mombi, {{speaking}} so suddenly that she startled them all. [...] "What will you do with me then?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{understood}} from Mr. Jarvis <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>wished</b> {{to speak}} to me, sir," [...] he remarked. [...] "I hope that my work has given satisfaction? I know that I am quite inexperienced but I don't think that I have made any mistakes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is {{it without}} reason?" [...] he asked. [...] "Would not any one {{be afraid of}} you--if, indeed, they {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>wished</b> to know our secrets? I wonder {{if there is a}} man alive whom you could not turn round your little finger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'That {{is quite}} correct,' I answered; 'but you will excuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my {{professional}} qualifications. I {{understand that it}} was on a professional matter <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>wished</b> to speak to me?' ...|$|R
6000|$|The girl stared; {{her light}} laugh filled the air. [...] "And it's {{in order to}} see more of them and judge <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> to make my mother's acquaintance?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, Lily, {{say what}} you think {{yourself}}. We shall get on better when you have brought yourself to speak. Do you think <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>wish</b> to see him again?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{provoked}} him," [...] Louis said firmly. [...] "You {{gave him}} provocation such as no gentleman of honour could suffer. It {{was not for}} this that I came out with you, but because <b>you</b> said <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>wished</b> to unravel {{what may be a}} plot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{sure she}} does not. It {{was all a}} {{misunderstanding}} from the first. When some of us could not do all <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>wished,</b> we thought it better--" [...] Then Bell paused, finding that she would get herself into a mess if she persevered.|$|R
6000|$|... "At least I {{should find}} peace there, and gentle words," [...] {{answered}} Cicely with spirit, for {{she knew her}} father, and the worst of her fear had departed.
