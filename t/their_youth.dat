40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} to {{what extent}} the political mean of rapidly increasing higher education in the 1990 s in Sweden has decreased educational inequalities (i. e. the choice of attending higher education has become less dependent on family background in the 1990 s than before). Smaller regional colleges were heavily exposed to the expansion of higher education. Although the parental impact on the educational choice of <b>their</b> <b>youths</b> grew stronger in the 1990 s compared to the 1980 s, difference-in-difference estimates show that the educational association between parents and <b>their</b> <b>youths</b> grew less in the geographical areas of the regional university colleges than in Sweden as a whole. Some support is provided here that social mobility has increased, in the sense that most socioeconomic groups gained from the educational expansion, except for the group with the least educated parents.
