5|$|At Panxian, {{there appears}} to have been a {{transition}} in the endemic marine reptile fauna, possibly caused by volcanism. This volcanism is indicated by the presence of a bentonite layer between the Middle and Upper Reptile Horizons. From lower in the Upper Reptile Horizon, fossils have also been found of the ubiquitous mixosaurian ichthyosaur Mixosaurus panxianensis (which occurs in all layers), the pachypleurosaurs Keichousaurus sp. and Wumengosaurus delicatomandibularis, and fish, although fossils of the latter are fragmentary. The lower Middle and Lower Reptile Horizons also include the mixosaurian Phalarodon cf. fraasi, <b>the</b> <b>primitive</b> ichthyosaur Xinminosaurus catactes, the placodont Placodus inexpectatus, the nothosaurs Lariosaurus hongguoensis and Nothosaurus yangjuanensis, and the archosaur Qianosuchus mixtus, alongside bivalves and saurichthyid fish.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{spectral}} evidence, Hygiea's {{surface is}} thought to consist of primitive carbonaceous materials {{similar to those found}} in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Aqueous alteration products have been detected on its surface, which could indicate the presence of water ice in the past which was heated sufficiently to melt. <b>The</b> <b>primitive</b> present surface composition would indicate that Hygiea had not been melted during the early period of Solar System formation, in contrast to other large planetesimals like 4 Vesta.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} Miocene, around 10 Mya, the bovids rapidly diversified, {{leading to the}} {{creation}} of 70 new genera. This late Miocene radiation was partly because many bovids became adapted to more open, grassland habitats. The Aepycerotinae first appeared in the late Miocene, and {{no significant difference in the}} sizes of <b>the</b> <b>primitive</b> and modern impala has been noted. Fossils of obivines, a tribe of Caprinae, in Africa date back to the late Miocene. The earliest Hippotragine fossils date back to the late Miocene, and were excavated from sites such as Lothagam and Awash Valley. The first African fossils of Reduncinae date back to 6-7 Mya. Reduncinae and Peleinae probably diverged in the mid-Miocene.|$|E
5|$|Fish ovaries may be {{of three}} types: gymnovarian, {{secondary}} gymnovarian or cystovarian. In the first type, the oocytes are released directly into the coelomic cavity and then enter the ostium, then through the oviduct and are eliminated. Secondary gymnovarian ovaries shed ova into the coelom from which they go directly into the oviduct. In the third type, the oocytes are conveyed to the exterior through the oviduct. Gymnovaries are <b>the</b> <b>primitive</b> condition found in lungfish, sturgeon, and bowfin. Cystovaries characterize most teleosts, where the ovary lumen has continuity with the oviduct. Secondary gymnovaries are found in salmonids {{and a few other}} teleosts.|$|E

5|$|It {{quickly became}} {{evident that the}} {{cyclical}} pattern of the monsoon weather would dictate the timing and pace of military operations in the northeast. From November through May (the dry season), North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces advanced out of Sam Neua Province along Route 6 {{and out of the}} Barthelemy Pass through Ban Ban toward the Plain of Jars. The lack of roads and <b>the</b> <b>primitive</b> state of those that did exist forced the communists to stretch their lines of communication taut, inviting counterattack. This Vang Pao's forces did from June through October (the wet season), utilizing air power, air mobility, and guerrilla tactics to push the communists back to their starting places.|$|E
5|$|Pleuronectiformes (flatfish) are {{an order}} of ray-finned fish. The most obvious {{characteristic}} of the modern flatfish is their asymmetry, with both eyes {{on the same side}} of the head in the adult fish. In some families the eyes are always on the right side of the body (dextral or right-eyed flatfish) and in others they are always on the left (sinistral or left-eyed flatfish). <b>The</b> <b>primitive</b> spiny turbots include equal numbers of right- and left-eyed individuals, and are generally less asymmetrical than the other families. Other distinguishing features of the order are the presence of protrusible eyes, another adaptation to living on the seabed (benthos), and the extension of the dorsal fin onto the head.|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} few years the use of {{distributed}} structured shared memory paradigms for coordination betwe en parallel processes has become common.

In this p ap er we describe a new set of primitives for fully distributed coordination of processes and agents using tuple spaces, called theBonita <b>primitives.</b> <b>The</b> Linda <b>primitives</b> provide synchronous access to tuple spaces, whereas <b>the</b> Bonita <b>primitives</b> provide asynchronous access to tuple spac es. <b>The</b> prop osed <b>primitives</b> are able to mimic <b>the</b> Linda <b>primitives,</b> therefore providing <b>the</b> ease of use and expressibility of Linda together with anumber of advantages for the coordination of agents or processes in distributed environments. <b>The</b> <b>primitives</b> allow user processes to p erform computation concurrently with tuple spac e accesses, and provide new coordination constructs which lead to more e�cient programs.

5|$|A later 1994 {{study by}} Novas instead {{classified}} Herrerasaurus within Dinosauria, and strongly supported its position within Saurischia, as well a provided synapomorphies shared with Theropoda. Novas found that <b>the</b> <b>primitive</b> features of lacking a brevis fossa and having only two sacral vertebrae were simply reversals {{found in the}} genus. In 1996, Novas went further by supporting a theropod position for Herrerasaurus with a phylogenetic analysis, which placed it closer to Neotheropoda than Eoraptor or Sauropodomorpha. Langer (2004) mentioned that this hypothesis was widely accepted, but that more later authors instead preferred to place Herrerasaurus as well as Eoraptor basal to Theropoda and Sauropodomorpha, a clade called Eusaurischia. Langer (2004) conducted a phylogenetic analysis, {{and found that it}} was much more likely that Herrerasaurus was a basal saurischian, than either a theropod or a non-dinosaurian. Langer's proposal was supported by multiple studies until the discovery of Tawa, when Nesbitt et al. conducted a more inclusive analysis, and the resulting cladogram placed Herrerasauridae basal to Eoraptor, but closer to Dilophosaurus than Sauropodomorpha. Unlike Nesbitt, Ezcurra (2010) conducted a phylogenetic analysis to place his new taxon Chromogisaurus, and found that Herrerasauridae was basal to Eusaurischia.|$|E
