During his opening statement, Perot explained {{that there was a}} [...] "giant sucking sound" [...] caused by the rush of manufacturing jobs to Mexico. During one exchange, Perot commented that Democrats and Republicans were both to blame for the deficit, but that neither was willing to take responsibility. He joked [...] "somewhere out there, there's an extraterrestrial that's doing <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> I guess." [...] At the close of the debate, Perot described himself as [...] "results... action oriented", and explained that [...] "if they want to keep slow dancing and talk about it and not do it, I'm not your man." [...] Perot took part in the third debate held in East Lansing, Michigan, on October 19. Throughout the debate, he plugged and referenced his infomercials. He criticized Bush's economic plan to start off the debate, stating that it would not balance the budget. He later remarked that he would spend $60 {{million of his own money}} to finish the race. Notably, Perot brought up the fact that [...] "both parties have foreign lobbyists on leaves and key roles in the campaigns." [...] After the debate, he ripped the media during a press conference, criticizing them for their use of [...] "gotcha" [...] stories and the lack of coverage concerning his opponent's foreign lobbyists. Former pollster Frank Luntz explained, [...] "When Ross Perot uses his head, he's unbeatable. He's focused, straightforward and compelling. When he uses his heart, sometimes his emotions get carried away." ...|$|E
500|$|On several occasions, {{people within}} the {{television}} and entertainment industry have suggested that Holby City {{is a waste of}} the television licence fee, with some suggesting that it ought to be cancelled. In August 2002, Paul Bolt, director of the Broadcasting Standards Commission criticised BBC programming as being [...] "humdrum" [...] and [...] "formulaic", saying of Holby City and the police procedural Mersey Beat: [...] "One begins to wonder what really is the point of the BBC bringing <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> Let's have something a bit different." [...] Then head of BBC drama Jane Tranter responded that Bolt's examples were [...] "highly selective" [...] as well as [...] "hugely patronising to the millions of viewers who enjoy popular dramas like Holby City – week in, week out". Young, who at the time held the position of head of drama serials, told The Guardian: [...] "Popular drama has always been singled out for criticism, but people are increasingly voting with their on-buttons." [...] Also in 2002, David Cox of the New Statesman criticised BBC One's 2001 Christmas schedule, for airing Holby City against a contemporary version of Othello. On this basis, Cox advocated the abolition of the licence fee, explaining: [...] "The BBC was invented in a period when the elite decided what the population should know. If that has gone, then the licence fee should go too." [...] At the 2003 Edinburgh International Television Festival, BSykB chief executive Tony Ball called for stricter restrictions on how the BBC spent licence payers' money, suggesting that Holby City be sold to the channel's commercial rivals, with the proceeds used to develop more original programming. The BBC refused Ball's suggestion, responding in a statement: [...] "This speech clearly reflects BSkyB's view that programmes are merely a commodity to be bought and sold." [...] In June 2004, Charles Allen, chief executive of ITV plc questioned the amount of funding spent on lengthened episodes of Holby City, and in January 2010, Janet Street-Porter of The Independent, opined Holby City had [...] "come to the end of [...] natural life" [...] and should be cancelled.|$|E
2500|$|The Arrest of Pangeran Diponegoro {{has been}} {{considered}} an example of early South-East Asian nationalism in art. John Clark, in his 1998 book, wrote that the painting declared [...] "you did <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> but we are still us" [...] to the Dutch. Krauss expands on this, stating that the positioning of De Kock on the left-hand ("female", or [...] "less powerful") side and the over-large heads of the Dutch officers relegates them (to a Javanese viewer) as impotent raksasas; Dutch viewers unfamiliar with such Javanese cultural considerations could have not {{realized that it was}} a [...] "bitter comment on Dutch colonial rule". This analysis has been supported by Carey, who describes the gifting of the painting as a [...] "curious backhanded gesture" [...] towards the Dutch king. He considers the morning to indicate that [...] "the memory of Dipanagara– his genius and his suffering– would one day... redeem the nation from the shackles of colonialism.|$|E

For, like other professional palmists, every time he worked the Heart Line too strongly he immediately moved along the Line of Least Resistance. Though Etienne did not confide <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> we surmised that he had moved out into the dusk about twenty minutes ahead of a constable, and had thus encountered the snow.

For as the veil of the temple, when whole, kept the view of the things of the holiest from us, but when rent, gave place to man to look in unto them; even so the body of Christ, while whole, kept the things of the holiest from that view, we, since he was pierced, have of them. Hence we are said to enter into the holiest, by faith, through the veil, that is to say, his flesh (Heb 10:19-22). But yet, I say, all is by faith; and, indeed, the rending of the veil that day that Christ was crucified, did loudly preach <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>us.</b> For no sooner was the body of Christ pierced, but the veil of the temple rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and so a way was made for a clearer sight of what was there beyond it, both in the type and antitype (Matt 27:50-53; Heb 10:19,20).|$|E

The scheme he laid out looked like a sure winner, and he talked me and Buck into putting our capital against his burnished dome of thought. It looked all right for a kid-gloved graft. It seemed to be just about {{an inch and a half}} outside of the reach of the police, and as money-making as a mint.

6000|$|Creator, as was hinted before, {{is one of}} God's {{peculiar}} titles. It is {{not given}} to him above {{five or six times}} in all the Book of God; and usually, when given him, it is either to show his greatness, or else to convince us that of duty we ought to depend upon him; and not to faint, if he be on our side, for or under any adversity, according as we are bidden in the text: [...] "Let them that suffer according to the will of God, commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing, as unto a faithful creator." [...] Shall God display his glory before us under the character and title of a Creator, and shall we yet fear man? Shall he do <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> when we are under a suffering condition, and that on purpose that we might commit our souls to him in well-doing, and be quiet, and shall we take no notice of this? [...] "Who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass; and forgettest the Lord thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth?"

6000|$|For instance: “Upon {{the banks}} of the St. Lawrence there are several little Indian villages. The cleared land is rarely, I may almost say never, cultivated, nor are any inroads made in the forest for such a purpose. The soil is, nevertheless, fertile, and, were it not, manure lies in heaps by their houses. Were every family to inclose half an acre of ground, till it, and plant it in {{potatoes}} and maize, it would yield a sufficiency to support them one half the year. They suffer, too, every now and then, extreme want, insomuch that, joined to occasional intemperance, it is rapidly reducing their numbers. <b>This,</b> <b>to</b> <b>us,</b> so strange apathy proceeds not, in any great degree, from repugnance to labor; on the contrary, they apply very diligently to it when its reward is immediate. It is evidently not the necessary labor that is the obstacle to more extended culture, but the distant return from that labor. I am assured, indeed, that among some of the more remote tribes, the labor thus expended much exceeds that given by the whites. On the Indian, succeeding years are too distant to make sufficient impression; though, to obtain what labor may bring about {{in the course of a}} few months, he toils even more assiduously than the white man.” ...|$|E

A nation, strong, rich, luxurious, prosperous in {{industry}} at home, and aggressive (if not in theory, certainly in practice) to less civilized races abroad--are we not tempted daily to that habit of mind which the prophet calls--with that tremendous irony in which the Hebrew prophets surpass all writers--looking on men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things which have no ruler over them, born to devour each other, and be caught and devoured in their turn, by a race more cunning than themselves? There are those among us in thousands, thank God, who nobly resist that temptation; {{and they are the}} very salt of the land, who keep it from decay. But for the many- -for the public--do not too many of them believe that the law of human society is, after all, only that internecine conflict of interests, that brute struggle for existence, which naturalists tell us (and truly) is the law of life for mere plants and animals? Are they not tempted to forget that men are not mere animals and things, but persons; that they have a Ruler over them, even God, who desires to educate them, to sanctify them, to develop their every faculty, that they may be His children, and not merely our tools; and do God's work in the world, and not merely their employer's work? Are they not--are we not all--tempted too often to forget this? ...|$|E

6000|$|But {{they will}} tell you again--and this, too, is surely true--that I Am must be the very name of God, because God alone can say perfectly, [...] "I Am," [...] and no more. You and I dare not, if we think accurately, say of ourselves, [...] "I am." [...] We may say, I am this or that; I am a man; I am an Englishman; but we must not say, [...] "I am;" [...] that is, [...] "I exist of myself." [...] We must say--not I am; but I become, or have become; I was made; I was created; I am growing, changing; I depend for my very {{existence}} on God and God's will, and if He willed, I should be nothing and nowhere in a moment. God alone can say, I Am, and there is none beside Me, and never has, nor can be.

Yes, my friends; philosophy may be true, and yet be dreary, and awful, and have no gospel and good news in it at all. I believe it never can have; that only in Revelation, and in the Revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ, can poor human beings find any gospel and good news at all. And sure I am, that that is an awful thought, a dreary thought, a crushing thought, which makes a man feel as small, and worthless, and helpless, and hopeless, as a grain of dust, or a mote in the sunbeam--that thought of God for ever contained in Himself, and saying for ever to Himself, [...] "I Am, and there is none beside Me." ...|$|E

In the centre of its curved front, a small bracket and detached shaft sustain the projection of a narrow marble desk (occupying the place of a cushion in a modern pulpit), which is hollowed out into a shallow curve on the upper surface, leaving a ledge at the bottom of the slab, so that a book laid upon it, or rather into it, settles itself there, opening as if by instinct, but without the least chance of slipping to the side, or in any way moving beneath the preacher's hands.
