The roof collapses and Syed is hospitalised and Yusef lies to Zainab that Syed could die so she visits him, but his injuries were not serious noticing that Yusef tricked her. Yusef makes out that he is sleeping with Zainab so Masood and Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) then kidnap Yusef {{in an attempt to}} scare him away. Masood threatens to pour petrol over Yusef, though it is only water and leaves him unharmed. When Masood returns home, Yusef has cuts on his face and blames it on Masood. Everyone believes Yusef and Masood is rejected from his home. Yusef convinces Tamwar, Afia and Zainab that Masood should not be at the mehndi. At the wedding, Masood turns up to try to stop it but Tamwar reveals that he and Afia already married. Yusef's cousin Tariq (Antony Bunsee) arrives and he reveals that Yusef started the fire that burnt Zainab.|$|E
25|$|This last {{discrepancy}} may {{be explained}} as Dalin wanting {{to talk to his}} father but not wanting to open the emotional floodgates of a reunion that both want but seem unable to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> towards. Instead Dalin asks Kolea about his parents, and Kolea replies as if he knew them well. On Games Day Germany in 2009 Abnett clarified this discrepancy being caused by the psychic influence of Agun Soric, which meddled with the character's thinking, and made Dalin forget the revealed identity of his father.|$|E

500|$|Some Wii {{players have}} {{experienced}} a form of tennis elbow, known as [...] "Wiiitis". A {{study published in the}} British Medical Journal stated that Wii players use more energy than they do playing sedentary computer games. While this energy increase may be beneficial to weight management, it was not an adequate replacement for regular exercise. A case study published in the American Physical Therapy Association's journal, Physical Therapy, focused on use of the Wii for rehabilitation in a teenager with cerebral palsy. It {{is believed to be the}} first published research demonstrating physical-therapy benefits from use of the gaming system. Researchers say the system complements traditional techniques through use of simultaneous gaming rehabilitation efforts. In May 2010 the American Heart Association (AHA) endorsed the Wii to encourage sedentary people to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> toward fitness. The AHA heart icon covers the console and two of its more-active games, Wii Fit Plus and Wii Sports Resort.|$|E

2500|$|Haig sent {{copies of}} the {{relevant}} orders and a critique of GHQ's conduct of the battle to his wife, who showed them to Stamfordham (10 November) for the King to see. Robertson was working against French, telling Haig (15 November) that [...] "the first thing is to get you in command". The Prime Minister discussed the matter with the King and Kitchener (both of whom thought French {{not up to the}} job, although Kitchener thought the time not right for a change), and, on 23 November, Haig. Asquith then asked Esher to convey to French in person the news that he must resign, but that he was being offered a peerage and the newly created job of Commander-in-Chief Home Forces. [...] However, French insisted on seeing Asquith again (29 November) at which meeting Asquith told him that he must <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> and that he was not being [...] "recalled" [...] (sacked). [...] French's official critique of Haig's performance at Loos finally reached the War Office on 1 December. [...] He wrote to Asquith (2 December) suggesting that Kitchener be removed {{to be replaced by a}} civilian Secretary of State to avoid friction with the new job of Commander-in-Chief Home Forces, and writing that he would await Asquith's decision on this point. [...] He returned to France (3 December), but Asquith had been exchanging further letters with Stamfordham and they agreed that French must now be pressed to quit. [...] Walter Long telephoned French (4 December) passing on the Prime Minister's message that he must resign.|$|E
