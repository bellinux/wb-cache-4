40|$|AbstractPurposeThe {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the effects of {{intermittent}} sprint training and plyometric training on endurance running performance. MethodsFourteen moderately trained male endurance runners were allocated into either the intermittent sprint training group (n[*]=[*] 7) or the plyometric training group (n[*]=[*] 7). The preliminary tests required subjects to perform a treadmill graded exercise test, a countermovement jump test for peak power measurement, and a 10 [*]km time trial. Training included 12 sessions of either intermittent sprint or plyometric training carried out twice per week. On completion of the intervention, post-tests were conducted. Both groups showed significant reduction in weekly <b>training</b> <b>mileage</b> from preintervention during the intervention period. ResultsThere were significant improvements in the 10 [*]km time trial performance and peak power. There was also significant improvement in relative peak power for both groups. The 10 [*]km time trial performance and relative peak power showed a moderate inverse correlation. ConclusionThese findings showed that both intermittent sprint and plyometric training resulted in improved 10 [*]km running performance despite reduction in <b>training</b> <b>mileage.</b> The improvement in running performance was accompanied by an improvement in peak power and showed an inverse relationship with relative peak power...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{relationships between}} <b>training</b> <b>mileage</b> and intensity, and the type, incidence, severity, {{and duration of}} respiratory illness in distance runners, {{and the impact of}} illness on submaximal and maximal running perfon-nance. Design: A longitudinal observational study of distance runners with serial monitoring of training loads and clinical patterns of illness. Setting: A 4 -month winter training period in the Southern Hemisphere. Participants: A total of 20 highly trained (elite) male middle-distance and distance runners competing at the national and international levels. Main Outcome Measures: Training was quantified by mileage (km), intensity (scale, 1 - 5), and load (volume X intensity). Symptoms and signs of respiratory illness (type, duration, and severity) were verified by a physician at a weekly review. Performance was monitored by measuring submaximal and maximal oxygen uptake and time to exhaustion on a incremental treadmill test. Results: A majority of subjects (15 / 20) experienced 1 or more episodes of respiratory illness (mean, 2. 5 episodes; range, 1 - 5), with 79 % of symptoms classified as upper respiratory in origin. There {{were no significant differences in}} mean weekly mileage (P = 0. 43), training intensity (P = 0. 85), or training load (P = 0. 45) between healthy runners and those affected by illness. Mean weekly (88 +/- 46 km) and mean monthly (373 +/- 163 km) mileages prior to each episode of illness were similar to the overall study means (95. 5 +/- 36. 4 km and 382 +/- 146 km). There were no substantial relationships between mean weekly <b>training</b> <b>mileage,</b> intensity, or <b>training</b> load and the number of illnesses reported (all r < 0. 20). Neither submaximal nor maximal running performance was significantly affected by the presence of illness. Conclusions: Differences in <b>training</b> <b>mileage,</b> intensity, and load were not associated with the incidence of respiratory illness in highly trained middle-distance and distance runners. Runners with mild illness can be reassured that symptoms will not necessarily impair submaximal and maximal performance...|$|R

2500|$|By the mid-1920s, {{traffic was}} growing {{with up to}} 7 trains {{a day on the}} Beech Forest line.

50|$|Certain {{economies in}} <b>train</b> <b>mileage</b> were {{possible}} after {{acquisition of the}} Northampton line, and the opportunity was taken to rationalise the junction at Greens Norton: the junction (and signalbox) was abolished by running a second single track from Towcester; two single tracks ran side by side, and for {{the expense of the}} additional track the signalmen's wages were saved.|$|E

30|$|An {{interesting}} {{finding was}} that women had a slower swimming speed in the World Championships than in the European Championships, whereas men showed a slower swimming speed in the European Championships than in the World Championships. Previous studies showed that training variables influence swimming speed in competitive performance (Anderson et al. 2008; Stewart & Hopkins 2000). Stewart and Hopkins (2000) reported a significantly better performance with greater weekly <b>training</b> <b>mileage</b> for swimmers specialised in sprint (i.e. 50 m and 100 m) and middle-distance (i.e. 200 [*]m and 400 [*]m). Pyne et al. (2004) described that the progression in race times between competitions {{is related to the}} effects of training. Training includes improvement of fitness, technique, swimming skills and psychological skills (Pyne et al. 2004).|$|R
50|$|The {{long run}} is an {{important}} element in marathon training. Recreational runners commonly try to reach a maximum of about 32 km in their longest weekly run and a total of about 64 km a week when training for the marathon, but wide variability exists in practice and in recommendations. More experienced marathoners may run a longer distance during the week. Greater weekly <b>training</b> <b>mileages</b> can offer greater results in terms of distance and endurance, but also carry a greater risk of training injury. Most male elite marathon runners will have weekly mileages of over 160 km. It is recommended that those new to running should get a checkup from their doctor, as there are certain warning signs and risk factors that should be evaluated before undertaking any new workout program, especially marathon training.|$|R

The FAST, developed to identify disordered eating behaviours in athletes, is reliable with a high internal consistency (Cronbach’s α[*]=[*] 0.87). Higher FAST scores are associated with eating disorders as identified by the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (0.60, p[*]<[*] 0.05) and Eating Disorder Inventory (0.89, p[*]<[*] 0.001) [13].

The LEAF-Q was validated in endurance athletes (Cronbach’s α[*]≥[*] 0.71) with scores ≥ 8 producing a sensitivity of 78  % and specificity of 90  % to correctly classify energy availability and/or reproductive function and/or bone health [12].|$|R
5|$|The son of {{prominent}} Western Australian businessman and politician Max Evans, Evans had a late start to his swimming career, making his debut at the Australian Championships {{in his hometown}} of Perth, aged 17.

40|$|Exercise-induced hypogonadotropic {{hypogonadism}} is well recognized among female endurance athletes but is less commonly observed in male endurance athletes. We have reported a well-characterized case of severe acquired {{hypogonadotropic hypogonadism}} in a male distance runner with osteopenia, stress fracture, and sexual dysfunction. Using this case as an index, {{we hypothesized that}} the presence of 1 or more specific risk factors would prospectively identify male endurance athletes with exercise-induced hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. These include a history of stress fracture, sexual dysfunction, or the initiation of endurance exercise before age 18 years. We studied 28 male endurance runners younger than 50 years who ran more than 40 miles per week. Of these runners, 15 had 1 or more of the above risk factors (group 1), and the remaining 13 had none of the putative risk factors (group 2).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{demographics}} and training characteristics of adventure racing {{athletes in the}} United Kingdom, the prevalence and anatomical distribution of hazardous encounter, and overuse injury in this population, and the effects these injuries have on training. METHODS: A retrospective training and injury questionnaire for the previous 18 months was distributed to 300 adventure racing athletes at two national race meetings. The definition of an injury was "any musculoskeletal problem causing a stop in training {{for at least one}} day, reduction in <b>training</b> <b>mileage,</b> taking of medicine, or seeking of medical aid. " RESULTS: The data were derived from the responses of 223 athletes. Advanced level athletes did 11 (4) sessions and 17 (8) hours of training a week (mean (SD)). An injury was reported in the previous 18 months by 73 % of the respondents. The most common site of acute injury was the ankle (23 %) and of chronic/overuse injury, the knee (30 %), followed by the lower back, shin, and Achilles tendon (12 % each). There were significant correlations (p< 0. 01) between the hours spent cycling per week and number of acute injuries, and between the number of days off per week and number of chronic/overuse injuries. Injuries resulted in an average of 23 days training cessation or reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Acute injuries were sustained mainly {{as a result of the}} nature of the terrain over which athletes train and compete. In overuse injuries lack of adequate rest days was a significant contributing factor. Only a small proportion of training time was spent developing flexibility and core stability...|$|R

Howden also reported that the existing equipment of the railway had an economic life of 10-25 years. Economies were made throughout the 1950s and early 1960s. These included the ending of evening and Sunday services, the deferral of track maintenance, and cuts to <b>train</b> <b>mileage</b> as locomotives became unserviceable. To further reduce expenses, there were winter closures of the Peel line (1960-61 only) and the Ramsey line after September 1961, but A. M.

40|$|Background. To {{investigate}} if {{the characteristics}} and training profiles of runners are significant indicators to predict a {{successful completion of}} a marathon. Methods. Experimental design: comparative investigation between two groups of runners at a marathon race. Setting: participants of the study came from the 1998 Standard Chartered New Airport International Marathon in Hong Kong. Participants: 113 runners were investigated, of which 58 runners dropped out at the first 10 km of the race, while the other 55 were those that consulted for physiothearpy service after the marathon. Measures: using questionnaire, the characteristics and the training profiles of these runners were obtained. These included weekly training distance, longest and shortest training distance per session in one week; warm-up and stretching exercise with the training sessions, number of marathons previously finished and the runners' opinion of optimal <b>training</b> <b>mileage</b> to complete a marathon. Results. Independent t-tests with Bonferroni adjustment were used to investigate {{the difference between the}} two groups, the results showed significant difference in the weekly training distance (p= 0. 00), longest and shortest training distance per week (p= 0. 00), and personal opinion on optimal weekly training distance for a marathon (p= 0. 00). Logistic regression modeling was then employed to determine variables that best predict the likelihood of completing a marathon. Conclusions.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the association of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use and self-reported running performance and the perceptive reasons for NSAID use in Chinese recreational marathon runners. A self-administered questionnaire was filled by 201 Chinese marathon runners at marathon exposition or running club training sessions one to two weeks prior to 2009 Standard Chartered Hong Kong Marathon race. The questionnaire included sections comprising of personal information, running performance and training background, sports injury, and NSAID usage. Fifty-three participants (26 %) {{reported that they had}} used NSAID in the previous three months. Of these, 22 runners (42 %) indicated that treatment of sprain injury was the main reason for taking NSAID and 48 runners (91 %) reported incidence of sports injury in the past three months. A significant association was found between the incidence of sports injury and NSAID usage according to Ï 2 analysis (P < 0. 001). Among the 53 runners who reported NSAID usage, physician was the major source (70 %) in obtaining NSAID while 26 % of the users indicated that they acquired no or limited knowledge on the side effects of NSAID. NSAID usage was found to be significantly associated with self-reported personal best run time as well as weekly <b>training</b> <b>mileage</b> (P < 0. 05). In the fast runner group stating less than 4 hours of personal best run time, 32. 4 % of them reported NSAID usage. In contrast, only 20 % of the runners who stated more than 4 hours of personal best run time reported NSAID usage. These findings suggest that the use of NSAID is related to the incidence of sports injury and self-reported running performance in Chinese recreational marathon runners.

Two groups of high mileage (HM; > 45 km/wk, n = 13) and low mileage (LM; < 15 km/wk, n = 13) runners ran at four speeds (2. 5 - 5. 5 m/s) while lower limb mechanics and electromyography of the thigh muscles were collected. There were few differences in prelanding activation levels, but HM runners displayed lower activations of the rectus femoris, vastus medialis, and semitendinosus muscles postlanding, and these differences increased with running speed. HM runners also demonstrated higher initial knee stiffness during the impact phase compared with LM runners, which was associated with an earlier peak knee flexion velocity, and both were relatively unchanged by running speed. In contrast, LM runners had higher knee stiffness during the slightly later weight acceptance phase and the disparity was amplified with increases in speed. It was concluded that initial knee joint stiffness might predominantly be governed by tendon stiffness rather than muscular activations before landing. Estimated elastic work about the ankle was found to be higher in the HM runners, which might play a role in reducing weight acceptance phase muscle activation levels and improve muscle activation efficiency with running training. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Although neuromuscular factors play a key role during running, the influence of high <b>mileage</b> <b>training</b> on neuromuscular function has been poorly studied, especially in relation to running speed. This study is the first to demonstrate changes in neuromuscular conditioning with high <b>mileage</b> <b>training,</b> mainly characterized by lower thigh muscle activation after touch down, higher initial knee stiffness, and greater estimates of energy return, with adaptations being increasingly evident at faster running speeds...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{reasons and}} urban {{congestion}} make {{the use of}} powered two-wheelers (PTW) increasingly more attractive. While injuries and fatalities among car users have been decreasing in high-income countries (WHO, 2013), the share of PTW riders among all victims still increases. For this reason and due to the severity of motorcycle accidents, motorcycle novices and motorcyclists {{that have not been}} riding for some time (“returning riders”) are the target group of this research. Examples from Sweden, Germany and Austria show that quality and extent of driver training {{have a significant impact on}} novice drivers’ risks. Furthermore, a study of the Institute for Road Safety Research in the Netherlands (SWOV) showed that trained riders scored better on safe driving when observing their riding behaviour before and after a one-day advanced rider (risk) training, both in the short and in the long term (De Craen, 2013). Thus, improving the driver training can effectively reduce traffic accidents. However, a training duration of up to two years and <b>training</b> <b>mileage</b> of several thousand kilometres can only be achieved by lay instruction models. Professional training to this extent would not be affordable. So far, no experience exists in applying such a comprehensive, holistic education model for PTW riders. In Austria, the basic driver training is highly formalised, consisting of about 5 hours of theoretical and 12 hours of practical training provided by certified professionals. Therefore, in order to offer the required education in a cost-efficient way, two additional training modules, especially targeting PTW riders, were recently developed by the Austrian Road Safety Board (KFV). Both training modules are voluntary and intended for the time after obtaining a driving license in order to foster safer driving behaviour and attitudes of motorcycle novices and returning riders. The two additional training modules for PTW riders are an e-learning tool and a training with a “buddy” thus representing a theoretical and a practical approach. The e-learning tool addresses issues of risk perception and risk management, vehicle safety, protective equipment and related topics. These topics are prepared individually depending on the learning content and the learning target and include practical information and professional advice. The main advantage of an e-learning-based method is flexibility - users can learn according to their individual learning speed and whenever it is convenient for them. In addition, the content of the e-learning tool is customised for the preferences of the users. The main goal of the e-learning tool is to reduce the risk of accidents through a target-oriented intermediation of risk competence by raising awareness concerning specific hazards and bringing about a related change of attitude toward motorcycle riding. The second module consists of hands-on training with a “buddy”. Within this training, motorcycle novices or returning riders (“rookies”) are accompanied and supervised on the road by an experienced rider (“buddy”). The training targets the intensive build-up of driving routine and gathering of driving practice on typical motorcycle tracks. The guided "learning by doing" and the strengthening of defensive driving habits form the core of this module. Important are: the training of higher order skills (i. e. anticipation skills); the improvement of safety behaviour, risk competence and hazard perception; the increased sustainability of the previously learned issues; and the strengthening of realistic perception. The e-learning tool and the training with a “buddy” will be linked together within a matching application in the future to accomplish an autonomous “dating platform” where “buddies” and “rookies” can team up and stay in touch. Thus, motorcycle novices and returning riders get additional theoretical and practical training within one application...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the impact {{of being involved in}} a collision on the subsequent driving behavior of young novice drivers aged 16 - 17. Participants were part of the Naturalistic Driving Study for the Strategic Highway Research Program 2. Each participant’s car was fitted with a data acquisition system that recorded a number of measures during the study period which averaged 472 days. The recorded measures included gravitational force (g-force) events, video footage (from four cameras), and <b>mileage.</b> <b>Trained</b> coders identified which g-force events were associated with “police reportable” and “most severe” collisions. There were 41 participants who were involved in these collisions and, of these, 35 had at least 200 miles of recorded driving before and after their collision. The authors looked at g-force event rates (g-force events per mile driven) at four driving periods: 200 – 100 miles before a collision; 100 – 0 miles before a collision; 0 – 100 miles after a collision; and 100 – 200 miles after a collision. A repeated measures ANOVA found that there was a significant change in g-force event rates across the four time points. Pairwise analyses found that participants’ g-force event rates significantly decreased from the period just prior to the collision to the period after. Future research questions that emerge from these preliminary findings are discussed...|$|R
