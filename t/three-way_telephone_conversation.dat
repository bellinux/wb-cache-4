40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was multifold: it aimed to {{investigate}} similarities and differences between Chinese and English <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations,</b> to test the validity of the theoretical distinction between transactional talk and interactional talk, and to examine L 2 learners' use of the target language. Comparisons along four dimensions were conducted: (1) across languages [...] Chinese and English, (2) across functions [...] transactional and interactional talk, (3) across settings [...] China and the U. S., (4) L 1 vs. L 2 [...] English as native language and English as a second language. The data consist of natural <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> in Chinese and in English recorded by eighteen female participants (native speakers of Chinese and native speakers of American English) and interviews with the participants. Four sets of data were analyzed: Chinese <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> recorded in China, Chinese <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> recorded in the U. S., English <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> recorded in the U. S., and English <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> recorded in the U. S. by native speakers of Chinese. The findings suggest that primary differences between Chinese and English <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> occur in identification, phatic talk, and leave-taking. Transactional calls and interactional calls display variation in greeting, phatic talk, initiation of closing, and register. The comparison of the use of language between the two settings reveals differences predominantly in transactional calls. The examination of L 2 discourse suggests that learners' communicative competence will be further enhanced with the promotion of sociolinguistic knowledge and pragmatic awareness of the communicative event...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aims {{to focus on}} <b>telephone</b> <b>conversation</b> opening and closing in Persian and the {{problems}} which may emerge in translating them into English. With {{particular attention to the}} studies done on <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> by Schegloff (1968; 1986), Liddicoat (2007), Taleghani Nikazem (2002), and Khadem and Eslami Rasekh (2012), the researchers intend to analyze some movies and series in Persian as the source language and compare them with their subtitled translations in English. The corpus of the study consists of the <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> in Persian with their subtitled translations, which both are extracted from these movies and series. As there are some differences in the cultures of both Persian and English and some peculiarities exist in the structure of <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> in both languages, there seems some noticeable findings will be achieved...|$|R

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study investigated code-switching in <b>telephone</b> <b>conversation,</b> {{with a focus}} on gender differences. Conversations were taken as samples from a local radio call-in program. The <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> were first listened to and then categorized according to the gender. Once filtered to different genders, the conversations were analyzed and the code-switches were categorized according to their functions. The sample were recorded and downloaded from the radio online archive, which are then transcribed and analyzed using Gumperz Semantic Model (1982). Six functions of codeswitching, which are personalization or objectivisation, quotation, message qualification, situational code-switching, interjection and reiteration, noted from the <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations.</b> The function of code-switch used most by both the male and female subjects is personalization or objectivisation. Study also showed that the females codeswitch more than the male in the <b>telephone</b> <b>conversations</b> of this nature. This study also provides pedagogical implications and suggestions for future research...|$|R
