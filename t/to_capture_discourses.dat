40|$|Digital {{differences}} {{constitute a}} significant problem {{when it comes to}} the use of social media in crisis management. There is a lack of systematic strategies and theories for understanding and handling differences, which significantly delimits the effectiveness of humanitarian response in all phases of a crisis. Consequently, we must better understand the broader communication settings and in particular how different applications and methods can enable an understanding of the demographics of social media contributors and users. In this article, we provide an overview and an analysis of the description of the participant in crisis informatics against this background. We also suggest a taxonomy <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> <b>discourses</b> about the role of the participant in the communication situation. This methodology is applied on research in the field of crisis informatics to identify some aspects on how the problem with unequal data production is addressed in this field. The results show that participants often are described in terms of roles defined by action such as "police" or "first responder". When it comes to participants' different situated perspectives, i. e., whether the participants have on site experience or are reporting from a particular locality, disability is to some extent acknowledged, while differences between participants such as age, gender, and socio-economic factors, are not taken into account at all. Overall participants are seen as a homogenous crowd from where data is extracted...|$|E
40|$|Deep neural {{networks}} have shown recent promise in many language-related {{tasks such as}} the modeling of conversations. We extend RNN-based sequence to sequence models <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> the long range discourse across many turns of conversation. We perform a sensitivity analysis on how much additional context affects performance, and provide quantitative and qualitative evidence that these models are able <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> <b>discourse</b> relationships across multiple utterances. Our results quantifies how adding an additional RNN layer for modeling discourse improves the quality of output utterances and providing more of the previous conversation as input also improves performance. By searching the generated outputs for specific discourse markers we show how neural discourse models can exhibit increased coherence and cohesion in conversations...|$|R

Researchers have investigated various features of written <b>discourse</b> <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> <b>discourse</b> variation in L 1 and L 2 writings. Likewise, the present ex-post-facto study compared the formality and emotionality of diction in general and emotional English and Farsi texts produced by 20 MA students at Islamic Azad University, Tabriz Branch. Having verified the initial homogeneity of the participants, we required them to write four paragraphs, two in English and two in Farsi, on a general and an emotional topic. The formality of the words in English texts was determined based on Webster’s Dictionary. Further, the positive and negative emotion words used in English and Farsi texts were measured based on the definitions offered by Pennebaker and King (1999). The results of the statistical analyses revealed {{no significant difference in the}} formality of the words used by the participants in general and emotional English texts. The comparison of the research data, however, indicated significant differences in the use of emotion words in general and emotional English and Farsi texts. The findings underscore the need for raising learners’ awareness of the role diction can play in writing...|$|R
40|$|To enable {{effective}} referential {{grounding in}} situated human robot dialogue, {{we have conducted}} an empirical study to investigate how conversation partners collaborate and mediate shared basis when they have mismatched visual perceptual capabilities. In particular, we have developed a graph-based representation <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> linguistic <b>discourse</b> and visual discourse, and applied inexact graph matching to ground references. Our empirical results have shown that, even when computer vision algorithms produce many errors (e. g. 84. 7 % of the objects in the environment are mis-recognized), our approach can still achieve 66 % accuracy in referential grounding. These results demonstrate that, due to its error-tolerance nature, inexact graph matching provides a potential solution to mediate shared perceptual basis for referential grounding in situated interaction. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to present the use of selfconfrontation in applied linguistics (AL) research on teachers’ activities. Selfconfrontation was developed by Faïta (1997), and improved by Clot (2006) within the context of Activity Clinics. It is a device that attempts <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> the multiple <b>discourses</b> around an activity and enable its transformation by workers. Thus, a qualitative research approach was employed and documental analysis of theses, dissertations and papers abstracts produced in Brazil (1987 to 2011), available in the electronic site of CAPES, was performed. The results demonstrated that selfconfrontation is used in a fragmented manner in AL studies that examine teachers’ activities, being primarily used for the collection of data, with little emphasis being placed on the transformation of the labor process...|$|R
40|$|The built {{environment}} puts major {{pressure on the}} natural environment; its role in transitioning to a circular economy (CE) is therefore fundamental. However, current CE research tends to focus either on the macro-scale, such as eco-parks, or the micro-scale, such as manufactured products, with the risk of ignoring the additional impacts and potentials at the meso-scale of individual buildings. This article sets out to unpack the fundamental defining dimensions of a CE and frame them for CE studies for the {{built environment}}. A critical literature review forms the basis for identifying and framing such fundamental dimensions. Our contribution highlights the key roles of interdisciplinary research and of both bottom-up and top-down initiatives in facilitating the transition to ‘circular buildings’. The frame for reference has been used <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> current <b>discourse</b> on the sustainability of the built environment and {{has proved to be}} a valuable tool to cluster existing initiatives and highlight missing links for interdisciplinary endeavours. The article represents a contribution to the theoretical foundations of CE research in the built environment and a stepping stone to shape future research initiatives. The authors would like to thank and acknowledge the Isaac Newton Trust (Research Grant RG 74916) for funding this research as well as the valuable inputs received by the anonymous reviewers...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} semantic analysis of long-distance reflexives (LDRs), reflexive pronouns with antecedents {{outside of their}} minimal clause. The study is based on Latin data, but in also includes cross-linguistic considerations. The analyses are framed in Partial Compositional Discourse Representation Theory (Haug 2013). Latin LDRs are frequent in indirect discourse in Latin {{as well as in}} other languages, and they refer to the author of the indirect discourse. Given this pattern, an analysis based on the modal semantics of indirect discourse easily comes to mind. However, LDRs are also attested in non-reported environments, which are often treated in terms of perspective shift. <b>To</b> <b>capture</b> the different uses, I argue that LDRs are anaphors with a presuppositional restriction to shifted perspective holders. Perspective shift is analyzed using events and thematic roles. This approach to perspective shift correctly captures the antecedents of LDRs in indirect discourse, but it can also account for other uses of LDRs. When indirect discourse containing an LDR is embedded within indirect discourse, the LDR becomes ambiguous. By modeling LDR binding as anaphora, this ambiguity is immediately <b>captured,</b> without having <b>to</b> resort to covert structural differences. Latin LDRs are widely attested in so-called unembedded indirect discourse (UID; Bary and Maier 2014), multi-sentence stretches of indirect discourse. In such cases, the LDR is often several sentences away from its antecedent. I show how UID can be analyzed in terms of event anaphora. When paired with the event-semantics of perspective shift, it is possible <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> the <b>discourse</b> antecedents of LDRs in UID. Finally, I discuss the antecedents of Latin LDRs in indirect discourse conveyed by a messenger, which have previously been seen as problematic. I present a new corpus study of such cases and show how they can be explained...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} was an explorative {{study of the}} race talk present in discourse when discussing HIV/AIDS and aimed to explore the discourses drawn on by participants during discussions around HIV and AIDS, to explore whether these discourses differed in one-to-one interviews with the author (private talk) compared with those in focus group discussions (public talk) and to investigate how learners navigated race during discussions around HIV/AIDS. The sample {{was made up of}} 26 grade 11 learners at a private school in Johannesburg. Data collection was conducted using three focus group discussions (FGD) and several individual one-on-one interviews. Both the interviews and focus groups were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide and recorded on Mp 3 players. The data was transcribed using several conversation analysis transcription conventions and later analysed using discourse analysis. An important methodological innovation of this {{research was}} its use of HIV/AIDS discussion <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> race <b>discourse.</b> Seven broad themes were analysed and discussed in the research and included (a) HIV/AIDS and the ‘Other’, (b) Race and ‘common sense’, (c) Navigating the perception of racism, (d) Race Trouble and location, (e) Race, Education and Government (f) Race and Apartheid and (g) Public talk Vs. Private talk While this research was mainly exploratory and attempted to investigate as many instances of ‘race talk’ as possible, as well as offer various feasible explanations for the learners’ use of race talk, it was suggested that {{it may be necessary to}} explore the possibility of expanding on existing theories to explain the use of race talk among black learners to ‘Other’ people of the same race. Furthermore, while this research did not specifically set out to explore the implications that the intersections between race and HIV/AIDS could have for education, it was suggested that the attachment of apartheid meanings to race (and HIV/AIDS) could lead to learners’ reluctance to critically engage with historical and contemporary texts or avoid discussing issues around HIV/AIDS...|$|R

40|$|This study {{considers}} the contested meaning {{of public education}} through a qualitative investigation of Patrick Henry School of Science and Arts, a charter elementary school in Richmond, Virginia. The central research question that guides this study is “How do parents construct the idea of public schools as they explain their choice of Patrick Henry Charter School?” To answer this question I conducted a constructivist inquiry that involved a series of 16 semi-structured interviews with a maximum variation sample of Patrick Henry parents concerning their ideas about the school and about public education. The analysis of these interviews led to a grounded theory of the parents’ ideas {{as well as a}} case report constructed from the categorized units of data that explores the core themes of the theory. This study also addresses two sub-questions: (1) “How do the parents’ ideas about public schools reflect the logics embedded in the larger policy discourses concerning charters and the reinvention of public education?” and (2) “How do the parents’ ideas about public schools reflect the local public discourse around the public-ness of the school?” To answer the first sub-question I use my review of literature to develop an understanding of the reform debates around charter schools and their relationship to the contested ideas of public education. To answer sub question two, I present an adapted constructivist qualitative analysis of the public discourse that surrounded the school from April 2007 – when the idea of the school was first proposed at a school board meeting – until December 2011 – {{a year and a half}} after the school opened its doors. <b>To</b> <b>capture</b> the public <b>discourse</b> I collected and analyzed articles, editorials and letters from six local print publications (newspapers, weekly magazines) as well as the public comment portion of the minutes from Richmond School Board meetings. This analysis resulted in the construction of two competing narratives about the school, the juxtaposition of which shed light on the how idea of public-ness was constructed in the public discourse...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis study {{deals with}} the {{determinants}} of prosodic phrasing in schooled childrens' narratives. According to Bronckart (1985) and Chafe (1986) the linguistic devices used by the speaker to structure discourse are the expression of conceptual constraints involved in the processing of information. We hypothetized that {{the way in which}} discourse is divided into segments by prosodic means, also carries the trace of the speakers' cognitive activity and that this segmentation provides perceptual cues to the listeners <b>to</b> <b>capture</b> the <b>discourse</b> structure. Tape-recorded narrations told by 84 seven- to eleven-year-old children were submitted to a perceptual evaluation. The children were shown wordless comic strip stories, which they were asked to tell to an age peer ignorant of the stories. The narative picture sequences were either arbitrary or ordered. In the arbitrary sequence, the events depicted in each picture, although presented as a sequence, could have occurred in any order. The speaker had to infer the links between the pictures from the proposed sequence in order to build an overall representation of the story. In the ordered sequence, the events could only occur in one order. Moreover in this later sequence, the ordinary succession of events was modified by the occurrence of a surprise event. Stories were produced according to simultaneous or consecutive displays. In the simultaneous display, all pictures were on a single page. The speaker was asked to look at them and prepare himself/herself to tell the story immediately afterwards. Then the pictures remained visible throughout the narration. In the consecutive display, the comic strip was presented in booklet format with one picture per page. Speakers were instructed to turn the pages one by one, and to tell the story as he/she discovered each new picture. He/she had to make the connection between the current content and the previous content as the story was being told. In this case, the storyteller was not allowed to look ahead or backtrack. Each speaker was tested in one frame display mode and one type of sequence. One hundred and twelve naive French listeners were invited to segment the recordings using melodic variation as a criterion, and to decide whether each prosodic segment was a conclusive or a continuative one. The results of the auditory analysis shows: (1) an age effect on the production of continuative segments (the listeners identified more continuative segments in the narrations of the eleven-year-old children than in the seven-year-old childrens' one); (2) the impact of the display mode on the production of conclusive segments (the listeners identified more conclusive segments in narratives produced in consecutive display than in simultaneous display); (3) the impact of the surprise event of the ordered sequence in consecutive display (the listeners identified more conclusive segments in this case than in the other cases) ...|$|R

Results of an application to Spanish point that this system succeeds in finding new DMs in corpus and ranking them according to their likelihood as DMs. Moreover, due to its modular architecture, X-TRACTOR evidences the specific contribution of each out of a number of parameters to characterise DMs. Therefore, this tool can be used not only for obtaining DM lexicons for heterogeneous purposes, but also for empirically delimiting the concept of DM. 1...|$|R
