25|$|In 2008, AC {{announced}} {{a joint venture}} with Brooklands Motor Company (the spiritual successor of Autokraft) in Weybridge, Surrey, UK and confirmed plans for the continuation of the traditional AC designed <b>tubular</b> <b>chassis</b> and aluminium-bodied models.|$|E
25|$|TA2 {{class rules}} specify a <b>tubular</b> <b>chassis</b> built by Howe Racing Enterprises, M-1 Motorsports, Mike Cope Racing, or Meissen Enterprises, and a Chevrolet Camaro, Ford Mustang or Dodge Challenger body (full-scale replica) built by either Five Star Racing Race Car Bodies (Gen 6 Camaros and Mustangs), or Howe Racing Enterprises (all other {{eligible}} cars), with the Camaro body {{being the most}} popular by far. A minimum of two functional brake lights in their approximate stock location are required on all cars competing in the Trans Am Series.|$|E
25|$|Chassis {{and engine}} changes {{made to the}} {{experimental}} 4CLs eventually coalesced into the 4CLT, the appended T denoting its <b>tubular</b> <b>chassis.</b> The improvements in torsional rigidity that the tubular construction brought were required to counteract the increases in torque and power resulting from the twin-supercharger upgrade of the elderly inline-4 engine. Power was up to approximately , from the 4CL's 220. Other changes included the use of roller bearings for the crankshaft, forged (rather than cast) rear suspension components, and the chassis was designed to run with hydraulic dampers from the outset.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tubular</b> {{spaceframe}} <b>chassis</b> {{suffered from}} rust, {{especially from the}} inside which would lead to its sudden and unexpected collapse.|$|R

25|$|The Maserati 4CL and its derived sister {{model the}} Maserati 4CLT are single-seat racing cars that were {{designed}} and built by Maserati. The 4CL was introduced {{at the beginning of}} the 1939 season, as a rival to the Alfa Romeo 158 and various ERA models in the voiturette class of international Grand Prix motor racing. Although racing ceased during World War II, the 4CL was one of the front running models at the resumption of racing in the late 1940s. Experiments with two-stage supercharging and <b>tubular</b> <b>chassis</b> construction eventually led to the introduction of the revised 4CLT model in 1948. The 4CLT was steadily upgraded and updated over the following two years, resulting in the ultimate 4CLT/50 model, introduced for the inaugural year of the Formula One World Championship in 1950. In the immediate post-war period, and the first two years of the Formula One category, the 4CLT was the car of choice for many privateer entrants, leading to numerous examples being involved in most races during this period.|$|E
2500|$|Clément was a {{director}} of Panhard-Levassor, and when the factory could not meet the production requirements for circa 500 units of the 1898 'voiture légère' ('dog cart') model, he undertook manufacture under licence at his factory in Levallois-Perret. It was designed by airship pioneer Commandant Arthur Krebs, of Panhard, and used a <b>tubular</b> <b>chassis,</b> centre-pivot steering, near-horizontal [...] rear-mounted engine with automatic inlet valve and hot-tube ignition, driving through a constant-mesh gear-train, and final drive by side chains; early models had no reverse gear.|$|E
2500|$|TA class {{cars are}} {{high-performance}} Grand Touring race cars with a <b>tubular</b> <b>chassis</b> and a Cadillac CTS-V, Chevrolet Camaro / Corvette, Dodge Challenger, or Ford Mustang body (full-scale replica) built by Advanced Composite Products (all eligible cars except Corvette C7) or Derhaag Motorsports (Corvette C6 / C7 / Camaro Generation 6 [...] only). Many of the entries carry Chevrolet Corvette bodywork, {{but there are}} several Ford Mustangs, a couple of Cadillac CTS-V coupes, and a Dodge Challenger in the class as well. All body types are eliminated 5 years after the last year that type or generation is produced. A minimum of two functional brake lights in their approximate stock locations are required on all cars competing in the Trans Am Series. They must be plainly visible, unobscured, and function just as they would on a production car.|$|E

50|$|The 288 GTO {{introduced}} in 1984 is considered {{as the first}} Ferrari supercar. The 288 borrowed much of the styling from the European 308 GTB QV of the previous year, 1983: it is also powered by a similar debored 2.8-litre V8 (but with turbochargers), it retained the general bodywork lines with extended wheelarches, different side air vents, and bigger rear spoiler, longer (5 inch) wheelbase, and the central <b>tubular</b> space-frame <b>chassis.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Cars were {{produced}} over two periods: from 1902 to 1915, and again from 1922 to 1925. The first proper Ariel {{car was a}} [...] twin-cylinder car produced in 1902. [...] In 1903, their first four-cylinder was a 15/19 model. Both these vehicles had a leather cone clutch that was entirely separate from the flywheel. In early 1904, Ariel began production of a six-cylinder model built on a seemingly inadequate <b>tubular</b> steel <b>chassis.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{fibreglass}} bodies {{covered a}} <b>tubular</b> central beam <b>chassis</b> made from steel, with {{front wheel drive}} and four wheel independent suspension directly lifted from the Panhard donors. Until 1952 all DBs had been intended for competition purposes only.|$|R
