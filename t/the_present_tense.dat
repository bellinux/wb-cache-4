5|$|The {{ability to}} plan and strategize, much like {{abstract}} thinking, {{can be seen in}} the more diversified toolkit of the Middle Stone Age, as well as in the subsistence patterns of the period. As MSA hominins began to migrate into a range of different ecological zones, it became necessary to base hunting strategies around seasonally available resources. Awareness of seasonality is evident in the faunal remains found at temporary sites. In less forgiving ecological zones, this awareness would have been essential for survival and the {{ability to plan}} subsistence strategies based on this awareness demonstrates an ability to think beyond <b>the</b> <b>present</b> <b>tense</b> and act upon this knowledge.|$|E

40|$|It {{is known}} that most {{students}} often find difficulties in learning English tenses and they seriously have problems in learning <b>the</b> Simple <b>Present</b> <b>Tense</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Present</b> Continuous <b>Tense.</b> Giving a learning reinforcement {{can be one of}} the solutions to strengthen the students’ grammatical knowledge. In this study, the writer used songs as a learning reinforcement. Songs can give the students the feeling of joy while they are learning <b>the</b> Simple <b>Present</b> <b>Tense</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Present</b> Continuous <b>Tense.</b> This study was written to find out the students’ responses, the teacher’s, and the students’ problems during the reinforcement process of <b>the</b> Simple <b>Present</b> <b>Tense</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Present</b> Continuous <b>Tense</b> using songs. This study is in the form of a reflective research. The writer first observed and then participated in the English class as a teacher. The reflections were done in SLTPK Santo Yosef Surabaya, with the second-year students as the subjects of this study. The writer chose this school because it is the school where the writer conducted her Teaching Practice. To obtain the data, the writer first asked permission to the principal of SLTPK Santo Yosef Surabaya to conduct the reflections. The reflections were supported by the observers, observation lists, video, and interviews. After the data was obtained, the writer analyzed the data. Analyzing data was done by <b>presenting</b> <b>the</b> transcription of the recorded data, setting up categories of the students’ responses, the teacher’s problems, and the students’ problems. Then, it was continued by classifying <b>the</b> data, <b>presenting</b> <b>the</b> findings, and the last was discussing the findings. From the reflections, the writer found that songs as the learning reinforcement are very helpful and able to encourage the students in learning English grammar especially <b>the</b> Simple <b>Present</b> <b>Tense</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Present</b> Continuous <b>Tense.</b> They will be useful in developing the students’ grammar acquisition. Grammar is no more frightening to study and no more difficult to understand. For further research, the writer expects that one day this study can be forwarded in form of quantitative research. From it, it is expected that we can know exactly the influence of using songs in teaching grammar toward the result of the students’ learning. Finally, the writer hopes that this study will give some guidance for the English teachers who want to use songs in their teaching-learning process and also some help further research...|$|R
