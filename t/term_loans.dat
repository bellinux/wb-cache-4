5|$|The CCF {{represented}} many {{agricultural areas}} in the Commons, and it proposed several measures to assure financial security for farmers. It proposed national growers' cooperatives for agricultural products which were exported. It proposed cash advances for farm-stored wheat, short and long <b>term</b> <b>loans</b> for farmers at low interest rates, and government support of prices, to assure the farmer a full income even in bad years. For the Atlantic fisherman, the CCF proposed cash advances {{at the start of}} the fishing season and government-owned depots which would sell fishing equipment and supplies to fishermen at much lower than market prices.|$|E

50|$|A <b>term</b> <b>loan</b> {{is simply}} an {{installment}} loan, such as a loan one would use to buy a car. The borrower may draw on the loan during a short commitment period and repay it based on either a scheduled series of repayments or a one-time lump-sum payment at maturity (bullet payment). There are two principal types of term loans: an amortizing <b>term</b> <b>loan</b> and an institutional <b>term</b> <b>loan.</b>|$|R
25|$|Asset {{liability}} mismatch/Maturity transformation – banks borrow more {{on demand}} debt and short term debt, but provide more long <b>term</b> <b>loans.</b> In other words, they borrow short and lend long. With a stronger credit quality {{than most other}} borrowers, banks can do this by aggregating issues (e.g. accepting deposits and issuing banknotes) and redemptions (e.g. withdrawals and redemption of banknotes), maintaining reserves of cash, investing in marketable securities that can be readily converted to cash if needed, and raising replacement funding as needed from various sources (e.g. wholesale cash markets and securities markets).|$|E
25|$|The Imperial Company of Trieste and Antwerp {{was opened}} to public {{subscription}} in August 1781 to raise, nominally, half its capital in one thousand shares. In fact, the Company was seriously under-capitalized, {{as the other}} thousand shares held by the Proli group and Bolts were {{paid for by the}} nominal value of the assets of the former association. Bolts’s valuation of those assets was accepted at face value, but it was a fictitious valuation and in fact the new Company inherited the old association’s debts. It consequently suffered chronic lack of cash and had to resort to short <b>term</b> <b>loans</b> and bottomry bonds (for which the ships themselves were the collateral) at a premium of 30 to 35 per cent. Under these conditions, every voyage had to be a success for the Company to remain viable. Also {{under the terms of the}} agreement erecting the new company, Bolts ceded his charter to his Belgian partners in return for a loan of 200,000 florins (that is, his 200 shares in the Company) and the right to send two ships on his own account to China.|$|E
500|$|Credit Suisse's founder, Alfred Escher, was called, [...] "the spiritual {{father of}} the railway law of 1852," [...] for his work {{defeating}} {{the idea of a}} state-run railway system in Switzerland in favor of privatization. Escher founded Credit Suisse (originally called the Swiss Credit Institution, i.e., Schweizerische Kreditanstalt) jointly with jointly with Allgemeine Deutsche Credit-Anstalt in 1856 primarily to provide domestic funding to railway projects, avoiding French banks that wanted to exert influence over the railway system. Escher aimed to start the company with three million shares and instead sold 218 million shares in three days. The bank was modeled after Crédit Mobilier, a bank funding railway projects in France that was founded two years prior, except Credit Suisse had a more conservative lending policy focused on short-to-medium <b>term</b> <b>loans.</b> In its first year of operation, 25 percent of the bank's revenues was from the Swiss Northeastern Railway, which was being built by Escher's company, Nordostbahn.|$|E

The well known claim eight on Eldorado Creek was sold for as much as $350,000 ($280 million). Prospectors were also allowed to hire others to work for them, either on their first claim or on later purchases. Enterprising miners such as Alex McDonald set about amassing mines and employees. Leveraging his acquisitions with short <b>term</b> <b>loans,</b> by the autumn of 1897 McDonald had purchased 28 claims, estimated to be worth millions.

However, unlike the Bank of England, the primary function of the bank would be credit issued to government and private interests, for internal improvements and other economic development, per Hamilton's system of Public Credit. The business it {{would be involved in}} on behalf of the federal government—a depository for collected taxes, making short <b>term</b> <b>loans</b> to the government to cover real or potential temporary income gaps, serving as a holding site for both incoming and outgoing monies—was considered highly important but still secondary in nature.|$|E
2500|$|Syndication and {{securitization}} {{also lead}} to greater risk distribution. Commercial and industrial (C) lending potential has expanded with the adoption of syndication practices, allowing credit risks to be spread across {{a greater number of}} participating banks and non-bank lenders. Perhaps an even more significant support for the expansion of C loans is the rapid growth of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs)-special purpose entities that buy C loans with funds raised from investors seeking different risk exposures. CLOs allow loans to be financed primarily with high-rated debt securities issued to institutions like mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance companies. Indeed, in recent years, the share of syndicated C <b>term</b> <b>loans</b> funded by institutional investors is estimated to have exceed that funded by commercial banks." ...|$|E

2500|$|The firm claims its {{loans are}} often cheaper than {{unauthorised}} bank charges and although APR disclosure is mandatory, it {{is a poor}} comparison measure for short <b>term</b> <b>loans.</b> The Business, Innovation and Skills Committee heard evidence from consumer money expert Martin Lewis that {{the total cost of}} a payday loan was more useful than APR. Lewis calculated in his blog that at a compounding interest rate of 4,212%, a £100 loan that is not repaid would in seven years amount to more than the USA's entire national debt, however, he explained that his calculation [...] "bears little resemblance to reality", because Wonga does not charge compound interest. He also explained that he had performed this calculation purely to raise awareness of the risks of payday loans and concluded by expressing the hope that his example would make people [...] "think twice before getting payday borrowing". Wonga have stated that they stop charging interest altogether once a loan becomes more than 60 days overdue.|$|E
