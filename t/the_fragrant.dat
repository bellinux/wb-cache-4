5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>Fragrant</b> Hill project neared completion, Pei {{began work}} on the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City, for which his {{associate}} James Freed served as lead designer. Hoping to create a vibrant community institution {{in what was then}} a run-down neighborhood on Manhattan's west side, Freed developed a glass-coated structure with an intricate space frame of interconnected metal rods and spheres.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Fragrant</b> Hill Hotel {{opened on}} 17 October 1982 but quickly fell into disrepair. A member of Pei's staff {{returned}} for a visit several years later and confirmed the dilapidated condition of the hotel. He and Pei attributed this to the country's general unfamiliarity with deluxe buildings. The Chinese architectural community at the time gave the structure little attention, as their interest at the time centered {{on the work of}} American postmodernists such as Michael Graves.|$|E
5|$|Thelephoric acid {{is present}} in several Hydnellum species. This compound, derived metabolically from the shikimic acid pathway, {{inhibits}} the enzyme prolyl endopeptidase, which is involved in deteriorating certain neuropeptides that are believed to contribute to memory and learning. Hydnellum caeruleum and H.concrescens have several para-terphenyl derivatives named thelephantins (specifically, variants thelephantins I–N), some of which can inhibit the enzyme alpha-glucosidase. The compounds hydnellins A and B are terphenyls found in H. suaveolens and Hydnellum geogerirum. The chemicals responsible for <b>the</b> <b>fragrant</b> anise-like aroma of H.suaveolens {{have been identified as}} coumarin and para-anisaldehyde.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>fragrant</b> {{and white}} {{elephants}} are the promotions in dai dai shogi and, in Steve Evans' Shogi Variants software, for tai shogi as well. (See link below.) The Japanese Wikipedia articles are confused. One states {{that both the}} northern and southern barbarians demote to gold. A second states that the northern demotes to gold and the southern promotes to white elephant. <b>The</b> <b>fragrant</b> elephant article states that this piece occurs in tai shogi, but provides no piece to promote into it.|$|E

25|$|Limited range: <b>The</b> king, <b>fragrant</b> {{elephant}} {{and white}} elephant can move {{one or two}} squares in any direction, orthogonal or diagonal.|$|R
25|$|Steam distillation: Steam from {{boiling water}} is {{passed through the}} raw material, which drives out their {{volatile}} fragrant compounds. The condensate from distillation are settled in a Florentine flask. This allows for the easy separation of <b>the</b> <b>fragrant</b> oils from the water. The water collected from the condensate, which retains some of <b>the</b> <b>fragrant</b> compounds and oils from the raw material is called hydrosol and sometimes sold. This is most commonly used for fresh plant materials such as flowers, leaves, and stems.|$|E
25|$|Distillation: A common {{technique}} for obtaining aromatic compounds from plants, such as orange blossoms and roses. The raw material is heated and <b>the</b> <b>fragrant</b> compounds are re-collected through condensation of the distilled vapor.|$|E
25|$|Bark: Commonly used barks include {{cinnamon}} and cascarilla. <b>The</b> <b>fragrant</b> oil in sassafras root bark {{is also used}} either directly or purified for its main constituent, safrole, which {{is used in the}} synthesis of other fragrant compounds.|$|E

25|$|Supercritical fluid extraction: A {{relatively}} new technique for extracting fragrant compounds from a raw material, which often employs Supercritical CO2. Due {{to the low}} heat of process and the relatively nonreactive solvent used in the extraction, <b>the</b> <b>fragrant</b> compounds derived often closely resemble the original odor of the raw material.|$|E
25|$|Expression: Raw {{material}} is squeezed or compressed and the essential oils are collected. Of all raw materials, only <b>the</b> <b>fragrant</b> oils from the peels of fruits in the citrus family are extracted {{in this manner}} since the oil is present in large enough quantities as to make this extraction method economically feasible.|$|E

Absolutes are usually found {{in the form of}} an oily liquid.|$|E
25|$|Note: Although Japanese Wikipedia {{mentions}} {{in passing}} that <b>the</b> <b>fragrant</b> elephant {{is used in}} tai shogi, it does not describe how it moves, or which piece promotes into it, and thus {{it may be an}} error. The movement described here is taken from English-language sources, and matches the Japanese description for dai dai shogi.|$|E

25|$|Many modern {{perfumes}} contain synthesized odorants. Synthetics {{can provide}} fragrances {{which are not}} found in nature. For instance, Calone, a compound of synthetic origin, imparts a fresh ozonous metallic marine scent that is widely used in contemporary perfumes. Synthetic aromatics are often used as an alternate source of compounds that are not easily obtained from natural sources. For example, linalool and coumarin are both naturally occurring compounds that can be inexpensively synthesized from terpenes. Orchid scents (typically salicylates) are usually not obtained directly from the plant itself but are instead synthetically created to match <b>the</b> <b>fragrant</b> compounds found in various orchids.|$|E
