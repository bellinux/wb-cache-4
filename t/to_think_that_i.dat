5|$|And <b>to</b> <b>Think</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> Saw It on Mulberry Street is Theodor Seuss Geisel's first children's book. It was {{published}} under the pen name Dr. Seuss. First published by Vanguard Press in 1937, the story follows {{a boy named}} Marco, who describes a parade of imaginary people and vehicles traveling along a road, Mulberry Street, in an elaborate fantasy story he dreams up to tell his father {{at the end of}} his walk. However, when he arrives home he decides instead to tell his father what he actually saw—a simple horse and wagon.|$|E

25|$|Geisel's {{earliest}} elephants {{were for}} advertising and had somewhat wrinkly ears, much as real elephants do. With And <b>to</b> <b>Think</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> Saw It on Mulberry Street! (1937) and Horton Hatches the Egg (1940), the ears became more stylized, somewhat like angel wings and thus {{appropriate to the}} saintly Horton. During World War II, the elephant image appeared as an emblem for India in four editorial cartoons. Horton and similar elephants appear frequently in the postwar children's books.|$|E
25|$|Geisel {{was born}} and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts, the son of Henrietta (née Seuss) and Theodor Robert Geisel. All four of his {{grandparents}} were German immigrants. His father managed the family brewery and was later appointed to supervise Springfield's public park system by Mayor John A. Denison after the brewery closed because of Prohibition. Mulberry Street in Springfield, made famous in Dr. Seuss' first children's book And <b>to</b> <b>Think</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> Saw It on Mulberry Street, is less than a mile southwest of his boyhood home on Fairfield Street. Geisel was raised a Lutheran. He enrolled at Springfield Central High School in 1917 and graduated in 1921. He took an art class as a freshman and later became manager of the school soccer team.|$|E

25|$|In 1936, {{the couple}} were {{returning}} from an ocean voyage to Europe when {{the rhythm of the}} ship's engines inspired the poem that became his first book: And <b>to</b> <b>Think</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> Saw It on Mulberry Street. Based on Geisel's varied accounts, the book was rejected by between 20 and 43 publishers. According to Geisel, he was walking home to burn the manuscript when a chance encounter with an old Dartmouth classmate led to its publication by Vanguard Press. Geisel wrote four more books before the US entered World War II. This included The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins in 1938, as well as The King's Stilts and The Seven Lady Godivas in 1939, all of which were in prose, atypically for him. This was followed by Horton Hatches the Egg in 1940, in which Geisel returned to the use of poetry.|$|E
500|$|After {{leaving the}} church Keable and Sybil {{moved back to}} England, {{settling}} at West Wratting, Cambridgeshire, where both began to explore the Roman Catholic Church. Sybil converted and became a devout Catholic, but Keable also read works in contemporary philosophy and the books of Charles Darwin, and appears briefly to have lost his faith altogether. He wrote, {{of the history of}} Christianity, [...] "I can see creative evolution at work. What is behind it, I don't know. But I'm inclined <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do not believe it is anything which the old concept of God really covers." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Judith and Neil Morgan, Geisel {{conceived}} {{the core of}} Mulberry Street {{in the summer of}} 1936 aboard the MS Kungsholm, a Swedish American luxury liner, during the return trip from a European vacation with his wife, Helen Palmer. As the Kungsholm endured a storm and Geisel suffered from sea sickness, he jotted down a rambling plot that started with [...] "a stupid horse and wagon". To keep himself occupied, he began reciting poetry to the rhythm of the ship's engines and soon found himself saying, [...] "And that is a story that no one can beat, and <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> saw it on Mulberry Street." [...] For days after they landed, he had the rhythm of the ship's engine stuck in his head, so, at Helen's suggestion, he decided to write a story based around it.|$|E

[...] Corgan said in 2005, [...] "I never wanted to leave the Smashing Pumpkins. That was never the plan." [...] On February 17, 2004, Corgan posted a message on his personal blog calling Wretzky a [...] "mean-spirited drug addict" [...] and blaming Iha for {{the breakup of the}} Smashing Pumpkins. On June 3, 2004, he added that [...] "the depth of my hurt [...] is only matched with the depth of my gratitude". Iha responded to Corgan's claims in 2005, saying, [...] "No, I didn't break up the band. The only person who could have done that is Billy." ...|$|E
500|$|Modern-day {{historians have}} {{continued}} to characterize the battle as a wholesale massacre. Mark Grimsley, {{a history professor at}} Ohio State University, concluded in 2005, based on other modern accounts, that the Battle of Bad Axe would be better termed a massacre. Kerry A. Trask's 2007 work, Black Hawk: The Battle for the Heart of America, points to the writings of Wakefield as evidence that delusional beliefs about doing brave deeds and magnifying manliness spurred the U.S. forces to revel in and pursue massacring and exterminating the Sauk and Fox. Trask concluded that Wakefield's statement [...] "I must confess, that it filled my heart with gratitude and joy, <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had been instrumental, with many others, in delivering my country of those merciless savages, and restoring those people again to their peaceful homes and firesides," [...] was a viewpoint held by nearly all militia members.|$|E
500|$|... "Not Pictured" [...] {{would mark}} the final {{appearance}} by series regular Jackie Cook (Tessa Thompson). When asked whether Jackie {{was done with}} the show, Thomas replied, [...] "She is. I would not hesitate for a second to have her come in to do an arc, but she will not be a series regular." [...] One notable recurring character absence in the finale is that of Gia Goodman (Krysten Ritter). Ritter wanted to appear in the episode, but she was unable to do so because of scheduling conflicts. [...] "It was unfortunate for me that I couldn't be in the finale episode (I booked a pilot) because I was looking forward to showing how everything that went down affected her. On a side note, I did start <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was responsible for the crash. I really wanted her to be a bad guy." [...] She would later appear in the Veronica Mars movie.|$|E

500|$|He {{transferred}} to the Royal Air Force when the RNAS and the RFC were merged on 1 April 1918. The creation of the Royal Air Force did not initially {{have a big impact}} on Allingham and he later remarked that at that time he still considered himself a navy man. [...] In the RAF he was ranked as a Rigger Aero, Aircraft Mechanic Second Class and was given a new service number: 208317. Allingham returned to the Home Establishment in February 1919 and was formally discharged to the RAF Reserve on 16 April 1919. During the last few years of his life Allingham was recognized as the last surviving founding member of the RAF. Speaking with Dennis Goodwin of the First World War Veterans' Association, Allingham said, [...] "It is a shock as well as a privilege <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am the only man alive from that original reorganisation when the RAF was formed." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's lead single was [...] "Moto Psycho", and a {{video was}} also made for this song. The song is about people who commute every day to work, {{spending}} a lot of time on the road. [...] "Dread and the Fugitive Mind" [...] was released on the [...] compilation a year earlier, at the insistence of Megadeth's former label, Capitol Records. The album's opener, [...] "Disconnect", is explained by Mustaine as being about living a double life and [...] "the person I want you <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am and the person inside that I really know I am." [...] "Coming Home" [...] was only available on the Japanese pressing as a bonus track, but has since been released on the Warchest box set. Mustaine has stated that concept for [...] "Promises" [...] is [...] "prejudiced relationships," [...] such as those between a Catholic and a Protestant in Ireland, interracial and same-sex relationships, [...] "it could be about a guy and a sheep for all I care. It just means that if we can't be together in this life, maybe we'll make it in the next." ...|$|E
2500|$|On the {{question}} of Sir Samuel Griffith's English translation of Dante Alighieri which had received numerous unflattering reviews, {{it was reported that}} when Griffith presented a copy to Salomons, the latter asked Griffith to autograph the fly leaf, explaining that [...] "I should not like anyone <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had borrowed the book, even less should I like anyone <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had bought it". Salomons was a supporter of religion being a moderator of human behaviour. [...] He endowed a local public school on the basis that religion was taught as a subject and was upset when it was not. [...] In an address on Australian Federation, he said that having an [...] "education without religion is like putting a sword into the hands of a savage".|$|E

2500|$|During 2004, rumors {{circulated}} that Häkkinen {{was making}} a possible return to Formula One {{to fill in the}} vacant Williams seat left by Juan Pablo Montoya. In May, McLaren team principal Ron Dennis dismissed the rumors, stating that Häkkinen was not prepared for a comeback. Häkkinen held talks with BAR and Williams and later decided against returning to Formula One saying in 2005: [...] "It's impossible <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would race a Formula One car again because as time passes my reactions become slower and my eyesight gets worse – that's life." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{realize that}} I shouldn't be {{surprised}} at God's doing things that I can't explain. [...] I shouldn't doubt His existence just because I find that I sometimes can't understand why or how He has made something. [...] I know that my nature is weak and limited and that God's is limitless, incomprehensible, and infinite, and, from this, I can infer that He can do innumerable things whose reasons are unknown to me. [...] On this ground alone, I regard the common practice of explaining things {{in terms of their}} purposes to be useless in physics: it would be foolhardy of me <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can discover God's purposes.

2500|$|Geisel {{adopted the}} name [...] "Dr. Seuss" [...] as an {{undergraduate}} at Dartmouth College and {{a graduate student at}} the University of Oxford. He left Oxford in 1927 to begin his career as an illustrator and cartoonist for Vanity Fair, Life, and various other publications. He also worked as an illustrator for advertising campaigns, most notably for Flit and Standard Oil, and as a political cartoonist for the New York newspaper PM. He published his first children's book And <b>to</b> <b>Think</b> <b>That</b> <b>I</b> Saw It on Mulberry Street in 1937. During World War II, he took a brief hiatus from children's literature and worked in an animation department of the United States Army where he produced several short films, including Design for Death, which later won the 1947 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature.|$|E
