5|$|Following {{a wave of}} {{political}} reforms in the late 1990s, Antara began to produce its reporting independently {{of the government and}} was reorganized as a state-owned enterprise in 2007. However, media scholars argue that a lengthy relationship with the government makes it difficult for <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> <b>to</b> become an unbiased news organization. Antara celebrated its 75th anniversary on 13December 2012.|$|E
5|$|No {{subsidiary}} legislation made under an Act of Parliament may be {{inconsistent with the}} provisions of any Act. This means that any {{subsidiary legislation}} that was made ultra vires its parent Act (that is, the Act did not confer power on <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> <b>to</b> make the subsidiary legislation) or is not consistent with any other statute is void {{to the extent of}} the inconsistency.|$|E
5|$|Several {{figures in}} Eisenhower's administration, {{including}} Secretary of State John Foster Dulles {{and his brother}} CIA Director Allen Dulles, had {{close ties to the}} United Fruit Company. The Dulles brothers had worked for the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell, and in that capacity had arranged several deals for the UFC. Undersecretary of State Walter Bedell Smith would later become a director of the company, while the wife of the UFC public relations director was Eisenhower's personal assistant. These personal connections meant that the Eisenhower administration tended to conflate the interests of the UFC with that of U.S. national security interests, and made it more willing to overthrow the Guatemalan government. The success of the 1953 CIA operation to overthrow the democratically elected Prime Minister of Iran also strengthened Eisenhower's belief in using <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> <b>to</b> effect political change overseas.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} roams Pacific City, {{systematically}} eliminating the leaders and subordinates {{of the three}} gangs. Upon defeating the gangs' Kingpins and generals, the Agent must put down a final riot by the remaining gang members in the area which after completion will cause that city to be almost crime free. Once all three gangs are fully exterminated, in the closing cutscene of the game, the Director reveals to the Agent {{that there was an}} ulterior motive for the Agency's actions: the Agency had secretly empowered the three gangs in the first place to instill fear in Pacific City's residents, thus creating a need for <b>the</b> <b>Agency</b> <b>to</b> control the city, and acceptance in the populace when they did take over. The Agency Director's comments suggest that the Agency will replicate this plan in other cities across the globe to create a New World Order.|$|E
5|$|From 1969 until 2007, the Nassif Building {{served as}} the {{headquarters}} of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). The building was designed to have removable interior walls to permit easy reconfiguration of the interior space. In November 1970, the federal government exercised its powers of eminent domain and seized control of the three-story basement parking garage from Nasif in order to provide inexpensive parking for DOT workers. Over the years, so many government workers complained of ailments while working in the structure that some believed it suffered from sick building syndrome. David Nassif Associates, owner of the building, disputed these claims. However, when the Department of Transportation announced it would leave the building in 2000, the owners promised a $100 million renovation that included a new air ventilation and cleaning system as an inducement for <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> <b>to</b> stay. The owners also unsuccessfully sued the General Services Administration in 1999 to force it to renew the federal lease on the building. The Department of Transportation completed their move out of the Nassif Building and into their new headquarters in June 2007.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the watchful}} eye of police detective Bobby Fulbright, Phoenix, Apollo and Athena become {{involved}} in several cases. Apollo and Athena investigate the murder of alderman Rex Kyubi. They face Simon Blackquill in court, who prosecutes despite serving a murder sentence himself. Additional content set after these events tells the story of Phoenix's first case after regaining his badge, having to defend an orca accused of killing her owner. Afterwards, Athena defends her childhood friend Juniper Woods who is charged with the murder of her teacher. Some time later, following a bombing at a space station, Apollo's friend Clay Terran is found murdered. During the trial, where Athena and Apollo defend an astronaut named Solomon Starbuck, a bomb goes off in the courtroom, injuring Apollo. Juniper is accused of the bombing, but Phoenix defends her and finds the real culprit. Feeling personally involved in the case, Apollo takes a leave of absence from <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> <b>to</b> investigate the case on his own while Phoenix takes over Solomon's case. He proves Solomon's innocence, but a new piece of evidence places Athena as the prime suspect.|$|E

In Bantam, he met some Indonesian nationalist youth activists such as Sukarni, Chaerul Saleh, and Wikana, {{who would be}} known as members of Persatuan Perdjuangan in Surakarta in 1948.|$|E

25|$|In 2006, the Coliseum Commission {{focused on}} signing a {{long-term}} lease with USC; the school offered {{to purchase the}} facility from the state but was turned down. After some at-time contentious negotiations, with the university threatening in late 2007 to move its home stadium to the Rose Bowl, the two sides signed a 25-year lease in May 2008 giving the Coliseum Commission 8% of USC's ticket sales, approximately $1.5 million a year, but commits <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> <b>to</b> a list of renovations.|$|E
25|$|In {{what appears}} to have been a {{response}} to lingering skepticism, on September 16, 2008, the FBI asked the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to conduct an independent review of the scientific evidence that led <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> <b>to</b> implicate U.S. Army researcher Bruce Ivins in the anthrax letter attacks of 2001. However, despite taking this action, Director Mueller said that the scientific methods applied in the investigation had already been vetted by the research community through the involvement of several dozen nonagency scientists.|$|E

50|$|The {{province}} comprised {{three groups}} of areas - the settled districts, <b>the</b> political <b>agencies</b> and <b>the</b> tribal area.

25|$|In 1998 {{a lawsuit}} was filed {{challenging}} the project, {{alleging that the}} environmental impact review of the project violated the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

25|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, the {{encroachment}} of settlers slowly drove the Cherokee {{south to the}} Hiwassee River and on to Georgia.

Nahum Sokolow, who had been elected to succeed Weizmann, remained in his position. Arthur Ruppin succeeded Sokolow as Chairman of the Jewish Agency in 1933 and David Ben-Gurion and Moshe Shertok joined the executive.
