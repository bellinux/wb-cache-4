5|$|The {{thought of}} {{acting in a}} film had never even entered their minds. They're easy-going people, {{they have a good}} time {{in front of the camera}} and I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> single moment where either of them felt they were working. Paz, however, was {{definitely}} conscious of the fact that she was interpreting a role.|$|E
25|$|Radcliffe {{had already}} {{established}} himself as an actor in the 1999 BBC television production of David Copperfield in which he played the title role's childhood years. Heyman persuaded Radcliffe's parents {{to allow him to}} audition for the part of Harry Potter, which involved Radcliffe being filmed. (This screen test footage was released via the first set of Ultimate Editions in 2009.) Rowling was enthusiastic after viewing Radcliffe's filmed test, saying she didn't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> better choice for the part of Harry Potter.|$|E
500|$|In 1963 he {{initiated}} {{the creation of}} the science fiction television series Doctor Who. The series has been described by the British Film Institute as having [...] "created a phenomenon unlike any other British TV programme", and by The Times newspaper as [...] "quintessential to being British". Newman had long been a science-fiction fan: [...] "p to the age of 40, I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> science-fiction book I hadn't read. I love them because they're a marvellous way—and a safe way, I might add—of saying nasty things about our own society." ...|$|E

500|$|Harrison's final studio album for EMI and Apple Records was {{the soul}} music-inspired Extra Texture (Read All About It) (1975). He {{considered}} it the least satisfactory {{of the three}} he had recorded since All Things Must Pass. Leng identified [...] "bitterness and dismay" [...] {{in many of the}} album's tracks; his long-time friend Klaus Voormann commented: [...] "He wasn't up for it... It was a terrible time because I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> lot of cocaine going around, and that's when I got out of the picture... I didn't like his frame of mind". He released two singles from the LP: [...] "You", which reached the Billboard top 20, and [...] "This Guitar (Can't Keep from Crying)", Apple's final original single release.|$|E
500|$|The Naval Academy and the University of Maryland are {{separated}} by about 30 miles {{in the state of}} Maryland. The schools by their nature, a Federal service academy and a public university, differ radically in terms of culture and lifestyle. For many years, the University of Maryland possessed the reputation of a blue-collar, working-class school. Some students viewed the Naval Academy, with its strictly regimented culture, as elitist. A former Terrapins linebacker, Jerry Fishman, believed that many Midshipmen [...] "thought they were far superior to the Maryland redneck coal miners." [...] A former Navy fullback, Pat Donnelly, said that compared to a [...] "public institution, [...] was night and day. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> feeling of mutual dislike, but it wasn’t personal, it was more institutional." ...|$|E
500|$|GoldenEye 007 {{introduced}} stealth elements {{not seen}} in previous first-person shooter games. Doak explained how this was implemented: [...] "Whenever you fired a gun, it had a radius test and alerted the non-player characters within that radius. If you fired the same gun again within {{a certain amount of}} time, it did a larger radius test and I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> third even larger radius after that. It meant if you found one guy and shot him in the head and then didn't fire again, the timer would reset". Windows throughout the game were programmed so that enemies cannot see through them while the player can. Though decidedly unrealistic, this was an intentional feature made to encourage the player to use windows to covertly spy on enemies. The game's multiplayer mode was added late in the development process; Martin Hollis described it as [...] "a complete afterthought". According to David Doak, the majority of the work on the multiplayer mode was done by Steve Ellis, who [...] "sat in a room with all the code written for a single-player game and turned GoldenEye into a multiplayer game." ...|$|E
500|$|Steve Redgrave, {{vice-president}} of the BOA, added [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> sense of disappointmentI <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> sense of celebration of winning that gold medal. I would take one gold medal over five bronze medals any day." [...] Hunt also {{announced that the}} BOA would conduct a strategic review of funding and may support the channeling of more funds towards realistic medal hopes.|$|R

500|$|The {{show was}} {{announced}} in late 2004 as a mid-season replacement for Boston Legal. It was originally scheduled {{to run in the}} Boston Legal time slot for just four weeks, but after receiving high ratings remained in the time slot {{for the remainder of the}} season. ABC Entertainment President Steve McPherson commented on the scheduling decision: [...] "Ultimately we decided that, without having adequate lead time or marketing dollars to devote to moving either show so late in the season, we'd continue to let 'Grey's' build on its tremendous momentum through May." [...] Prior to broadcast, it was announced that the show's title would change from Grey's Anatomy to Complications, although ultimately this did not come to pass. Francie Calfo, executive vice president for development at ABC Entertainment, commented on the show's conception: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> need for this kind of show on our air, specifically a medical show. And Shonda found a twist on it that made it perfect for where we're at right now. Medical shows are hard, and it was hard trying to figure out where ours could be different. But where everybody else is speeding up their medical shows, she found a way to slow it down, so you get to know the characters. There's definitely a strong female appeal to it." [...] Rhimes explained that she had found the idea of a show about smart women competing against one another an interesting one.|$|E
500|$|Madonna herself {{would later}} say: [...] "I wouldn't say I regret it. I've made {{mistakes}} and learned from them. Most {{people want to}} hear me say that I regret publishing my Sex book. I don't. What was the problem was releasing my Erotica album at the same time. I love that album and it got overlooked." [...] However, author Andy Koopmans in his book Madonna (2002) would comment that the singer regretted both publishing Sex and recording Erotica and that the book [...] "had affected everything she did later". It was not until 2003 that Madonna would once again declare that she regretted nothing; [...] "I'm not apologizing in any shape or form [...] I was interested in pushing buttons and being rebellious and being mischievous and trying to bend the rules. There was a lot of irony in the Sex book and I am poking fun at a lot of things and I am being kind of silly and adolescent and I am being very f you, if a man can do it, I can do it." [...] A year earlier on 2002, Naomi Campbell confessed to [...] "have {{a lot of respect for}} Madonna being bold enough to come out and do a book on sex. I've never reneged on that". However, in 2009, rapper Vanilla Ice, who was Madonna's boyfriend at the time of the book's creation, confessed to not being happy with the book once he saw it. [...] "My friends were like, 'Dude, that's cool man', but I was like, 'I'm dating her, it's not cool to see your girlfriend with all these other people' [...] It kinda ruined the whole thing. I wonder what her kids think of that book? Here she is writing kids' books now but they're going to see it and go, 'Mommy, what were you thinking?'" [...] Another of the book's models, actress Isabella Rossellini, told Out magazine that she regretted her participation on the book; [...] "I don't think the book worked, even though the photos were extraordinary, and some of them quite memorable. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> little bit of a moralistic sort of 'I'll teach you how to be free!' – and that bothered the hell out of me." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 1976 Houston Opera production, the director, Sherwin Goldman, {{had trouble}} finding {{interested}} performers. Goldman, a white Texas native {{and a graduate}} of Yale and Oxford Universities, recalled, [...] "I was auditioning singers all around the country, I guess thirty cities in all, from theater groups to church choirs, but {{was having a hard time}} finding directors ... I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> single black person, of those who had never been associated with Porgy, who didn't seriously bad-mouth it." [...] Nevertheless, a cast was assembled of African American classically trained performers from all around the country.|$|E

2500|$|The initial police {{portrayals of}} the incident, {{consisting}} of about 400 pages of typed and handwritten reports, prompted police supervisors {{to rule the}} case a justifiable homicide and {{within the bounds of}} the department's use of force guidelines. The reports did not say how many times McDonald was shot and said McDonald was acting [...] "crazed" [...] and lunged at officers after refusing to drop his knife. Michael D. Robbins, one of the attorneys representing the McDonald estate, said his initial thoughts were that “I didn’t <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> case if he had lunged at a police officer,” adding, [...] "The police narrative, without exception, is that the use of force is justified and necessary, which it sometimes is." ...|$|E
2500|$|That same month, Ciara {{said that}} there was no release date for the album. She instead said [...] "I think I'm almost done. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> date December 4 that was {{supposedly}} put in the universe, but the date was never ever confirmed, not from my mouth, but they can definitely look out for this album this winter. I'll be telling you soon. Stay tuned. You know what? I'm giving you guys my video [...] on my birthday, so you never know what could happen around Christmas-time. I love giving gifts." [...] After the premiere of the [...] "Got Me Good" [...] video, the album was slated to drop in early 2013. On April 15, 2013, Ciara revealed the official tracklist for the album and confirmed that it is now titled Ciara. Additionally, she stated that it would be released on June 4, 2013. The album was then postponed to July 9, 2013. The aforementioned singles were swept aside from the album and subsequently under the title Ciara, the album is now led by the single [...] "Body Party". The album artwork features a mirror-flipped image of Ciara.|$|E
2500|$|Mulroney and Schreiber {{question}} each other's truthfulness and credibility. In {{his testimony}} to the Canadian House of Commons Ethics Committee on December 13, 2007, Mulroney pointed out contradictory statements Schreiber has made over the years, including statements made under oath. Mulroney also stated that the work he had performed for his arms-trading business associate Schreiber was out-of-country, rather than lobbying his own Canadian government – such as lobbying the late President Boris Yeltsin that Russia buy arms yet {{to be made in}} Canada. Schreiber had been incarcerated in Canada following his 1999 arrest on a German warrant for tax evasion, and is currently (June 2008) free on bail. Mulroney did not declare the income or pay taxes on it until years later, when Schreiber had come under criminal investigation in Germany. Erik Nielsen, former Deputy Prime Minister for Mulroney, stated disbelief in Mulroney's account, and denied his credibility: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> phrase that attached to Brian years ago where he was known as Lyin' Brian, and for my own part, I believe that they're both in the same boat — Schreiber and Mulroney." ...|$|E

2500|$|Draper's {{tenure in}} Virginia was so {{successful}} that in 1922, when Dr. Hugh Cumming became the Surgeon General, Draper was brought onto his staff and {{put in charge of}} the States Relations Division where he would work with the health departments of each state. [...] With only twelve years in the Public Health Service, Dr. Draper was promoted to Assistant Surgeon General, possibly becoming the youngest member of the Public Health Service to reach this position up to that time. [...] Draper became very involved in working with state health departments, and deeply interested in helping states get appropriations from congress to develop county health departments through which better control of disease could be carried on. [...] In a 1963 interview he said [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> state health officer that I didn't call by his first name and who didn't call me by my first name too." [...] In September 1926, Draper was assigned as assistant surgeon general in charge of domestic quarantine, continuing to maintain his close ties and collaboration with the various state health departments. [...] In 1949, after Draper's retirement from the Public Health Service, he was given an award of recognition from the Conference of State and Provincial Health Associations of North America for his long and meritorious public health service.|$|E
