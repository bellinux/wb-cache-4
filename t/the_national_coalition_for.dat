25|$|The Syrian {{opposition}} {{is not a}} rigid political structure. In December 2015, the Syrian opposition convened in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, with 34 groups present at the convention with the aim to produce a unified delegation for negotiations with the Syrian government.

25|$|The Syrian Government {{has bought}} oil {{directly}} from ISIL, and the Syrian government and ISIL jointly run a HESCO gas plant in Tabqah. The facility supplies electricity to government-held areas, and government-run power plants supply ISIL-held areas. The Syrian government has tactically avoided ISIL forces {{in order to}} weaken opposition such as the Free Syrian Army (FSA), and according to United States Secretary of State John Kerry the Syrian government has purposely ceded territory to ISIL. An IHS Jane's Terrorism and Insurgency Center database analysis confirmed that only 6% of Syrian government forces attacks were targeted at ISIL from January to November 2014, while {{in the same period}} only 13% of all ISIL attacks targeted government forces. <b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>for</b> Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces has stated that the Syrian government has operatives inside ISIL, as has the leadership of Ahrar ash-Sham.

25|$|During {{the ongoing}} revolution, the Syrian opposition, {{represented}} by the Syrian National Council, then by <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Coalition</b> <b>for</b> Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces (commonly named the Syrian National Coalition) used {{a modified version of}} the independence flag first used in 1932 with a 2:3 aspect ratio. The modified independence flag began to be used as a universal display of the protesting opposition in late 2011. The opposition wanted to distinguish themselves from the current Syrian government and favoured the use of the flag used when Syria gained its independence from France. Khaled Kamal, an official from the Syrian National Council, now believes this flag to also represent independence and the end of Bashar al-Assad's government. Today the flag is mainly used in areas controlled by the Syrian National Coalition. The use of the modified independence flag is similar to the Libyan rebels' use of the pre-Gaddafi Libyan flag from the era of the Kingdom of Libya in opposition to Muammar Gaddafi's green flag. The original 1:2 aspect ratio flag has been used by the opposition unofficially on several occasions.|$|E
