5|$|The {{historical}} {{consensus is}} <b>that</b> <b>responsibility</b> or guilt {{for the war}} was not attached to the article. Rather, the clause was a prerequisite to allow a legal basis to be laid out for the reparation payments that were to be made. Historians have also highlighted the unintended damage created by the clause, which caused anger and resentment amongst the German population.|$|E
5|$|Early in 1957, family tragedy {{struck a}} third time {{when one of the}} nieces she had cared for in the 1940s {{died at the age of}} 31, leaving a five-year-old orphan son, Roger Christie. Carson took on <b>that</b> <b>responsibility,</b> {{adopting}} the boy, alongside caring for her aging mother. This took a considerable toll on Carson. She moved to Silver Spring, Maryland, to care for Roger, and much of 1957 was spent putting their new living situation in order and focusing on specific environmental threats.|$|E

His responsibilities were broad ones; they included supervising program planning, budgeting and scheduling; systems engineering; and mission planning.

40|$|According to Michael Zimmerman, no {{interpretation}} of the idea <b>that</b> moral <b>responsibility</b> is essentially interpersonal captures a significant truth. He raises several worries about the Strawsonian view <b>that</b> moral <b>responsibility</b> consists in susceptibility to the reactive attitudes and claims that this view at best supports only an etiolated {{interpretation of}} the idea <b>that</b> moral <b>responsibility</b> is essentially interpersonal. He outlines three problems. First, the existence of self-reactive attitudes may be incompatible with the interpersonal nature of moral responsibility. Secondly, Zimmerman questions {{the significance of the}} interpersonal nature of moral responsibility, according to the Strawsonian view. Thirdly, he argues that that view may be taken to suggest the wrong kind of priority relation between ‘P is morally responsible’ and ‘it is appropriate to adopt some reactive attitude toward P’. I discuss each of these problems in turn and conclude that Strawsonians can respond to all three problems raised by Zimmerman.

5|$|Much of {{the actual}} {{software}} development work on the game was done at Artoon, with Takuya Matsumoto serving as director and Manabu Kusonoki responsible for the game's world view. Matsumoto previously worked as a designer on , while Kusonoki {{is known for his}} work at Sega, including the world of Panzer Dragoon. Near the end of November 2005, roughly a year before the title was released in Japan, Artoon's Naoto Ohshima indicated that the game was around 40% complete. He also pointed out that Artoon had previously been known primarily for action titles, so <b>that</b> <b>responsibility</b> for Blue Dragon was originally somewhat frightening. Following this, a relative lack of media information for most of 2006 resulted in speculation that the title would be delayed until 2007, but Microsoft's Takashi Sensui confirmed in August 2006 that the game would indeed see a year-end 2006 release. Blue Dragon was eventually released on three full DVD discs, making it the first Xbox 360 game to span multiple discs.|$|E
5|$|When {{high levels}} of {{phosphorus}} and mercury were discovered in the waterways in 1986, water quality became a focus for water management agencies. Costly and lengthy court battles were waged between various government entities to determine {{who was responsible for}} monitoring and enforcing water quality standards. Governor Lawton Chiles proposed a bill that determined which agencies would have <b>that</b> <b>responsibility,</b> and set deadlines for pollutant levels to decrease in water. Initially the bill was criticized by conservation groups for not being strict enough on polluters, but the Everglades Forever Act was passed in 1994. Since then, the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have surpassed expectations for achieving lower phosphorus levels.|$|E
5|$|Churchill's {{return to}} the prime ministership meant Lord Cherwell's {{return to the}} post of Paymaster General. He was a strong {{supporter}} of the atomic energy programme, but while he agreed with its size and scope, he was critical of its organisation, which he blamed for slower progress than its Soviet counterpart. In particular, the programme had experienced problems with Civil Service pay and conditions, which were below those for comparable workers in industry. The Treasury had agreed to some flexibility in exceptional cases, but the procedure for doing so was absurdly slow. Hinton in particular was concerned at the low remuneration his senior staff were receiving compared with those with similar responsibilities at ICI. When he attempted to bring Frank Kearton in as his successor, the Treasury refused to adjust the salaries of his other two deputies to match. Rather than ruin his organisation's morale, Hinton had dropped the proposal to appoint Kearton. Nor could any reorganisation be carried out without Treasury approval. Within a month of assuming office, Cherwell had prepared a memorandum proposing <b>that</b> <b>responsibility</b> for the program be transferred from the Ministry of Supply to an Atomic Energy Commission.|$|E
30|$|The {{overall picture}} from the {{empirical}} data {{is that there}} is clear agreement <b>that</b> legal <b>responsibilities</b> come before economic responsibilities. No sub-section of the sample thought <b>that</b> economic <b>responsibilities</b> came first (although for Indian respondents economic responsibilities tied with legal responsibilities). Legal responsibilities came first overall and joint first with ethical responsibilities for US respondents and female respondents. However those who believed the legal system was inadequate to protect public welfare (n[*]=[*] 64) ranked ethical responsibilities first and significantly higher than legal responsibilities, which is consistent with the proposal <b>that</b> ethical <b>responsibilities</b> will be deemed to be more important than legal responsibilities when the legal system is not trusted to protect public welfare.|$|R

5|$|The 4th Marines were {{relieved}} as the garrison of Emirau by the 147th Infantry on 11 April 1944. The next day, Noble was replaced as island commander by a marine aviator, Major General James T. Moore, the Commanding General of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing. In turn, the 147th Infantry was relieved as garrison by the 369th Infantry in June. In August, General MacArthur directed <b>that</b> <b>responsibility</b> for garrisoning Emirau would {{be transferred to}} the Australian Army. The Australian 8th Infantry Battalion arrived to take over the garrison role on Emirau on 30 September. They were met by a small ANGAU detachment that had been on the island since May. Marine Aircraft Group 12 operated from Emirau until December, when it moved to Leyte; its place was taken by squadrons of the RNZAF. On 20 March 1945, General MacArthur authorized a reduction in the garrison size to one company of the 8th Infantry Battalion. In June 1945, it too was withdrawn. CBMU 502 departed for Manus that month. The RNZAF maintained a bomber-reconnaissance squadron at Emirau until July 1945, and a fighter squadron until August, when all forces were withdrawn from the island.|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{influence}} of social responsibility ratings on market returns to Arthur Andersen (AA) clients following the Enron audit failure. Chaney and Philipich (2002) found that AA's loss of reputation resulted in negative market returns to AA clients following the Enron audit failure. Proponents of social <b>responsibility</b> argue <b>that</b> social <b>responsibility</b> can improve {{the reputation of the}} firm, while detractors argue <b>that</b> social <b>responsibility</b> expenditures are a poor use of shareholder money. If social responsibility sends a signal to investors regarding the reputation/ethics of management, social responsibility could mitigate the negative returns to AA clients following the Enron audit failure. Using a matched sample of AA and non-AA firms, we do not find evidence <b>that</b> social <b>responsibility</b> mitigated the negative returns to AA clients following the Enron audit failure. Our results are inconsistent with claims <b>that</b> social <b>responsibility</b> can burnish a firm's reputation in a time of crisis and with prior research indicating a positive relationship between social responsibility and market value.
