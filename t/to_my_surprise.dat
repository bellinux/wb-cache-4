5|$|Vol. 3: (The Subliminal Verses) is {{the third}} studio album by American metal band Slipknot. The album was {{released}} on May 25, 2004, by Roadrunner Records, and a special edition, containing a bonus disc, was released on April 12, 2005. It is the band's only album produced by Rick Rubin, and also the only one not to feature any profanity. Following the band's tour to promote its second album in 2002, speculation regarding the future began. Some band members had already been involved in side projects including Murderdolls, <b>To</b> <b>My</b> <b>Surprise,</b> and the reformation of Stone Sour. In 2003, Slipknot moved into The Mansion {{to work on the}} album. Initially, the band was unproductive; lead vocalist Corey Taylor was drinking heavily. Nevertheless, they wrote more than enough material for a new album—the band's first to incorporate more traditional, melodic song structures, guitar solos and acoustic guitars.|$|E

The album was intended to be self-produced by Shawn Crahan and Brandon Darner, but after producer Rick Rubin was sent demos by Crahan, Rubin invited the band to Los Angeles where he assumed the role of executive producer. Following the release of the album, a music video was released for the song [...] "In The Mood" [...] on December 1.|$|E

Asked if her pregnancy affected her role, Berry replied, [...] "I wasn't in as much as I was meant to be. My ever-growing belly was posing a constant challenge! What I could do was getting more limited so the role that I play is so different from what it could have been, due <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>surprise</b> pregnancy". According to Kinberg, Berry had another scene in the film that was cut because of Berry's limited schedule.|$|E
500|$|<b>To</b> <b>My</b> <b>Surprise</b> was {{met with}} {{generally}} favorable critical reviews, but did not appear on any sales charts. One point which was generally drawn upon was the significant difference between their musical style to that of Crahan's other band Slipknot. Reviewer Neil Strauss opens his review with {{a reference to the}} title of the album, saying, [...] "And, truly, it is a surprise", and then going on to say that the album [...] "is commendable not just because [...] different but because [...] good". RobertL.Doerschuk of Allmusic declares that the album—aside from the track [...] "Say Goodbye"—"maintains a buoyant and unsubtle approach". He also noted Crahan's [...] "muscular style" [...] as a notable element to the album saying that [...] " [...] transplants well into this setting, which probably should not have been a surprise after all". The vocals on the album were praised by the reviewers at babysue, saying [...] "the vocals [...] masculine yet right on key". When reviewing for Calgary Sun, MikeBell highlighted their eclectic nature and in conclusion said the album is [...] "fittingly, fun and surprising". However RowanShaeffer of Counterculture said that their diversity was ultimately their strength and weakness; he suggested that they relied too heavily on their influences by creating songs of other bands, saying that [...] "the only [...] left out was the <b>To</b> <b>My</b> <b>Surprise</b> song".|$|E

500|$|In mid-2002, Slipknot went on hiatus {{because of}} {{internal}} conflicts, and band members focused on side projects. Vocalist Taylor and guitarist Root revived their band Stone Sour, drummer Jordison created Murderdolls with vocalist Wednesday 13, percussionist Crahan founded <b>To</b> <b>My</b> <b>Surprise</b> and DJ Wilson went solo as DJ Starscream. For a while, {{the future of}} Slipknot was uncertain and there was much speculation about whether {{there would be a}} third album, or if the split would become permanent. [...] "I don't have a problem with anyone in Slipknot," [...] Jordison protested. [...] "I've seen comments from Corey saying there are things to be resolved, but I have no fucking idea what he's talking about." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{the sheet}} music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Publishing, Stefani's vocals range from E3 to D5, leading an instrumentation of piano, guitar, and backup singers. An acoustic guitar is featured during the track's interlude, which {{is accompanied by}} a repetitive drum beat. NME's Alex Needham compared the song's composition to Orbit's contributions on Madonna's seventh studio album, Ray of Light (1998). Lyrically, Stefani sings about being impatient in a lustful romance, which additionally serves as a [...] "central theme" [...] on Rock Steady. The singer turns down acts of kindness in a relationship: [...] "The flowers arrive <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>surprise</b> / But that just ain't good enough". It also mentions the recording's protagonist feeling a sort of lovesickness during a long-distance relationship, where she predicts: [...] "I anticipate us making out".|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of the album, drummer Crahan touted <b>To</b> <b>My</b> <b>Surprise</b> as [...] "a hybrid of folk, '70s rock fuzz and {{schizophrenic}} grooves". Neil Strauss of The New York Times stated that each song has a unique sound, concluding that they sound like [...] "pop songs that have been pushed off balance". In another article Strauss includes They Might Be Giants, Weezer and Faith No More as bands with similar-sounding [...] "elements". Rowan Shaeffer of Counterculture, commented on the album's diversity, saying [...] "to say that the [...] is eclectic would be a gross understatement," [...] citing Pink Floyd and Mr. Bungle as evident influences. The Calgary Suns Mike Bell cited [...] "glam, new wave, Beatles pop and country rock" [...] as the sounds the album presents. In his review for Allmusic RobertL.Doerschuk noted that the track [...] "Sunday" [...] makes musical references to the single [...] "Pleasant Valley Sunday" [...] by The Monkees, giving the [...] "happy, strumming guitars and skippy rhythms" [...] as similarities. He also said that they quote [...] "one of the darker verses in the Jim Morrison songbook".|$|E

500|$|Azaria did {{not expect}} to hear from the show again, but they {{continued}} to call him back, first to perform the voice of Chief Wiggum and then Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. He felt that, initially, [...] " [...] didn't seem too pleased with what I had done... was very exacting... was kind of impatiently directing me on the ABCs of comedy. But then, much <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>surprise,</b> he would still keep having me back every week. But each week, I {{thought it was going to}} be my last week because I really didn't think I had done that well." [...] Nevertheless, by the show's second season he was performing multiple recurring voices and so was given a contract and made a permanent member of the main cast. Since he joined later than the rest of the cast, Groening still considered Azaria the [...] "new guy". In addition to Moe, Wiggum and Apu, Azaria provides the voices of Comic Book Guy, Carl Carlson, Cletus Spuckler, Professor Frink, Dr. Nick Riviera, Lou, Snake Jailbird, Kirk Van Houten, the Sea Captain, Superintendent Chalmers, Disco Stu, Duffman, the Wiseguy and numerous one-time characters. His co-star in The Simpsons, Nancy Cartwright, wrote that: [...] "The thing about Hank that I most remember is that he started out so unassuming and then, little by little, his abilities were revealed and his contributions to the show escalated. I realized Hank was going to be our breakaway star." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2002, Shawn Crahan, Brandon Darner and Steven Robinson {{began working}} on an album together.

However, Rubin invited the band to Cello Studios in Los Angeles to work on an album.

Their musical style has been noted to include; glam rock, new wave, pop, country rock, alternative rock and disco.
