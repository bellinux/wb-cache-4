5|$|The {{attack was}} led by Hernando Pizarro, the senior Spanish {{commander}} in Cusco, with a force of 100Spaniards (30infantry, 70cavalry) and an estimated 30,000 native allies. One of his main assets against the Inca armies was the Spanish cavalry because horses provided a considerable advantage in hitting power, maneuverability, speed, and stamina over Inca warriors. All Spaniards wore some kind of armor, {{the most commonly used}} types were chain mail shirts and padded cloth armor which were lighter and cheaper than full armor suits; they were complemented by steel helmets and small iron or wooden shields. The main Spanish offensive weapon was the steel sword, which horsemen supplemented with the lance; both weapons could easily penetrate <b>the</b> <b>padded</b> armor worn by Inca troops. Firearms, such as arquebuses were rarely used during the Spanish conquest of Peru because they were scarce, hard to use, and despised by horsemen as an ungentlemanly weapon. Spaniards relied heavily on Indian auxiliaries because they provided thousands of warriors as well as support personnel and supplies. These native troops had the same sorts of arms and armor as their Inca counterparts. During the Ollantaytambo campaign, the Pizarro expedition included thousands of auxiliaries, mainly Cañaris, Chachapoyas, and Wankas as well as several members of the Inca nobility opposed to Manco Inca.|$|E

25|$|The {{innovative}} {{new techniques}} specially improved tailoring trousers and tights which designs needed more differently cut pieces of cloth than most skirts. “Real” trousers and tights increasingly replaced the prevalent {{use of the}} hose (clothing) which like stockings covered only the legs {{and had to be}} attached with garters to underpants or a doublet. A skirt-like garment to cover the crotch and bottom was no more necessary. In an intermediate stage to openly wearing trousers the upper classes favoured voluminous pantskirts and diverted skirts like <b>the</b> <b>padded</b> hose or the latter petticoat breeches.|$|E
25|$|The Korean {{word for}} trousers, baji (originally pajibaji) first appears in {{recorded}} history {{around the turn}} of the 15th century, but pants may have been in use by Korean society for some time. From at least this time pants were worn by both sexes in Korea. Men wore trousers either as outer garments or beneath skirts, while it was unusual for adult women to wear their pants (termed sokgot) without a covering skirt. As in Europe, a wide variety of styles came to define regions, time periods and age and gender groups, from the unlined gouei to <b>the</b> <b>padded</b> sombaji.|$|E

25|$|In the 14th century {{it became}} common {{among the men}} of the noble and knightly classes to connect the hose {{directly}} to their pourpoints (<b>the</b> <b>padded</b> under jacket worn with armoured breastplates that would later evolve into the doublet) rather than to their drawers. In the 15th century, rising hemlines led to ever briefer drawers until they were dispensed with altogether by the most fashionable elites who joined their skin-tight hose back into trousers. These trousers, which we would today call tights but which were still called hose or sometimes joined hose at the time, emerged late in the 15th century and were conspicuous by their open crotch which was covered by an independently fastening front panel, the codpiece. The exposure of the hose to the waist was consistent with 15th-century trends, which also brought the pourpoint/doublet and the shirt, previously undergarments, into view, but the most revealing of these fashions were only ever adopted at court and not by the general population.|$|E

Between 1991 and 1993, UK sales of that Wonderbra style quadrupled to $28 million, accounting for 12.5% of the $225 million UK branded bra market. Several factors might have contributed to this boom including [...] "an article in British Vogue on the return of <b>the</b> <b>padded</b> bra, a Vivienne Westwood-inspired fad for corsetry and that Gaultier driven yearning for underwear as outerwear".

500|$|Seven days of {{pre-production}} {{began on}} August 15, 1997. On the first day, Fleder met with Yoshimura and Fontana {{to discuss the}} script and the director's vision for the episode. Fleder suggested modifying the prologue, and storyboarded the introduction which {{was included in the}} episode. The new prologue involved commuters coming down to the train station while a street band performed, leading up to the subway accident before the opening credits rolled. The song featured in this prologue, [...] "Killing Time", was written by Lisa Matthews, the lead singer of the Baltimore-area band Love Riot. Matthews also had a brief cameo on [...] "Subway" [...] as one of the witnesses to Lange's fall. On August 16, the show creators scouted out the Johns Hopkins Hospital Metro Subway Station, where the episode was to be filmed. At the request of the authority, the subway was renamed the fictional Inner Harbor station during filming. Fleder himself had only one hour to scout the location with his technical crew. Art director Vincent Peranio created a dummy wall to place in the empty space between two subway cars, making it appear that the two trains were one big car. Inside the dummy wall was a space in which the actor could stand and appear cut. Stunt coordinator G.A. Aguilar also choreographed the accident that day, and Peranio simulated the accident itself by tying a dummy into the hole in the dummy wall. Peranio originally wanted a stuntman to fall against the moving train, spin and fall into <b>the</b> <b>padded</b> hole in the dummy wall, but the transit authority refused to allow it.|$|E

500|$|The {{main event}} was a Six Sides of Steel cage match contested between America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) and Triple X (Christopher Daniels and Elix Skipper), with the losing team {{disbanding}} forever. Mid-way through, Skipper handcuffed Harris to {{the ropes and}} kept the key away from the referee. Storm later took the key from Skipper and freed Harris from the cuffs. [...] At {{one point in the}} match, Skipper and Daniels double teamed Harris and performed America's Most Wanted signature finishing maneuver, the Death Sentence by holding Harris in place while the other member climbed to the top rope and performed a leg drop across Harris's neck and head. Skipper followed by covering Harris for a pinfall, however, he kicked out before the count of three. Harris later climbed {{up to the top of}} the cage. While Harris sat on top of the cage, Skipper climbed up at another corner and walked across the top similar to walking a tightrope. Skipper then jumped and grabbed Harris's head with his legs, falling backwards towards the ring in a move he dubbed the New School. This move caused Harris to fly off of the top of the cage and land on his back in the middle of the ring. A brief time later, all four men were positioned at certain points on one of <b>the</b> <b>padded</b> turnbuckles to perform what TNA calls the [...] "Tower of Doom". In a variation of the move, Daniels was being held upside-down by Storm, until Skipper grabbed Storm and placed his head between Storm's legs to lift him off of a padded turnbuckle. Harris then grabbed Skipper and placed Skipper on his shoulders while he held Storm, who remained holding Daniels. Harris then performed a powerbomb on Skipper, while Skipper pulled down Storm, who suplexed Daniels off of the top of the cage. The conclusion to the match saw America's Most Wanted cuff Daniels to the ropes and perform Triple X's signature maneuver, the Powerplex by lifting Skipper up onto Storm's shoulders while Harris held Skipper's head. Storm and Harris then fell to the mat, forcing Skipper's neck into Harris's shoulder and mat while slamming his back into the mat as well. Storm then pinned Skipper for the pinfall victory. As a result of Triple X's loss, the team had to disband forever.|$|E

40|$|Here are {{guidelines}} for deembedding <b>the</b> mounting <b>pads</b> in standard component models to achieve accurate EM simulation By default, Modelithics library models include mounting pad effects.

However, there are reasons to include <b>the</b> <b>pads</b> in <b>the</b> EM simulation instead of having them inside the components models. Some of these reasons are: • Use of a pad size different from the one included with the model, or outside <b>the</b> range of <b>pad</b> dimensions if using a padscalable model. • Including the step effect when the feed line is different from <b>the</b> <b>pad</b> width. This step can also be included using an analytical model in a circuit simulation. • Including the effects of coupling between <b>the</b> <b>pads</b> and another part of the circuit. • Desire to simulate <b>the</b> <b>pads</b> along with other printed circuit patterns as a standard practice.
