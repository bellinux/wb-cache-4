5|$|Oxidative {{phosphorylation}} {{works by}} using energy-releasing chemical reactions to drive energy-requiring reactions: The {{two sets of}} reactions {{are said to be}} coupled. This means one cannot occur without the other. The flow of electrons through the electron <b>transport</b> <b>chain,</b> from electron donors such as NADH to electron acceptors such as oxygen, is an exergonic process– it releases energy, whereas the synthesis of ATP is an endergonic process, which requires an input of energy. Both the electron <b>transport</b> <b>chain</b> and the ATP synthase are embedded in a membrane, and energy is transferred from electron <b>transport</b> <b>chain</b> to the ATP synthase by movements of protons across this membrane, in a process called chemiosmosis. In practice, this is like a simple electric circuit, with a current of protons being driven from the negative N-side of the membrane to the positive P-side by the proton-pumping enzymes of the electron <b>transport</b> <b>chain.</b> These enzymes are like a battery, as they perform work to drive current through the circuit. The movement of protons creates an electrochemical gradient across the membrane, which is often called the proton-motive force. It has two components: a difference in proton concentration (a H+ gradient, ΔpH) and a difference in electric potential, with the N-side having a negative charge.|$|E
5|$|Another {{example of}} a {{divergent}} electron <b>transport</b> <b>chain</b> is the alternative oxidase, which is found in plants, {{as well as some}} fungi, protists, and possibly some animals. This enzyme transfers electrons directly from ubiquinol to oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Cytochrome c oxidase, {{also known}} as complex IV, is the final protein complex in the {{electron}} <b>transport</b> <b>chain.</b> The mammalian enzyme has an extremely complicated structure and contains 13 subunits, two heme groups, as well as multiple metal ion cofactors– in all, three atoms of copper, one of magnesium and one of zinc.|$|E
50|$|Bacterial {{electron}} transport pathways are, in general, inducible. Depending {{on their}} environment, bacteria can synthesize different transmembrane complexes and produce different electron <b>transport</b> <b>chains</b> in their cell membranes. Bacteria select their electron <b>transport</b> <b>chains</b> from a DNA library containing multiple possible dehydrogenases, terminal oxidases and terminal reductases. The situation is often summarized {{by saying that}} electron <b>transport</b> <b>chains</b> in bacteria are branched, modular, and inducible.|$|R

50|$|A common {{feature of}} all {{electron}} <b>transport</b> <b>chains</b> {{is the presence}} of a proton pump to create a transmembrane proton gradient. Bacterial electron <b>transport</b> <b>chains</b> may contain as many as three proton pumps, like mitochondria, or they may contain only one or two. They always contain at least one proton pump.|$|R
5|$|Many catabolic {{biochemical}} processes, such as glycolysis, the {{citric acid}} cycle, and beta oxidation, produce the reduced coenzyme NADH. This coenzyme contains electrons {{that have a}} high transfer potential; in other words, they will release {{a large amount of}} energy upon oxidation. However, the cell does not release this energy all at once, as this would be an uncontrollable reaction. Instead, the electrons are removed from NADH and passed to oxygen through a series of enzymes that each release a small amount of the energy. This set of enzymes, consisting of complexes I through IV, is called the electron <b>transport</b> <b>chain</b> and is found in the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. Succinate is also oxidized by the electron <b>transport</b> <b>chain,</b> but feeds into the pathway at a different point.|$|E
5|$|Succinate-Q oxidoreductase, {{also known}} as complex II or succinate dehydrogenase, is a second entry point to the {{electron}} <b>transport</b> <b>chain.</b> It is unusual {{because it is the}} only enzyme that is part of both the citric acid cycle and the electron <b>transport</b> <b>chain.</b> Complex II consists of four protein subunits and contains a bound flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor, iron–sulfur clusters, and a heme group that does not participate in electron transfer to coenzyme Q, but is believed to be important in decreasing production of reactive oxygen species. It oxidizes succinate to fumarate and reduces ubiquinone. As this reaction releases less energy than the oxidation of NADH, complex II does not transport protons across the membrane and does not contribute to the proton gradient.|$|E
5|$|With {{protons and}} {{electrons}} from the electron <b>transport</b> <b>chain,</b> nitrogen {{is reduced to}} ammonia and free hydrogen gas. This is an energy-using process, requiring the splitting (hydrolysis) of ATP into ADP plus free phosphate (Pi).|$|E

40|$|A {{variety of}} lactic acid {{bacteria}} contain rudimentary electron <b>transport</b> <b>chains</b> that can be reconstituted {{by the addition of}} heme and menaquinone to the growth medium. These activated electron <b>transport</b> <b>chains</b> lead to higher biomass production and increased robustness, which is beneficial for industrial applications, but a major concern when dealing with pathogenic {{lactic acid bacteria}}...|$|R
50|$|Individual {{bacteria}} use multiple electron <b>transport</b> <b>chains,</b> often simultaneously. Bacteria can use {{a number}} of different electron donors, {{a number of different}} dehydrogenases, a number of different oxidases and reductases, and a number of different electron acceptors. For example, E. coli (when growing aerobically using glucose as an energy source) uses two different NADH dehydrogenases and two different quinol oxidases, for a total of four different electron <b>transport</b> <b>chains</b> operating simultaneously.|$|R
5|$|In glycolysis, glucose and {{glycerol}} are metabolized to pyruvate. Glycolysis generates two equivalents of ATP through substrate phosphorylation catalyzed by two enzymes, PGK and pyruvate kinase. Two equivalents of NADH {{are also}} produced, {{which can be}} oxidized via the electron <b>transport</b> <b>chain</b> and result in the generation of additional ATP by ATP synthase. The pyruvate generated as an end-product of glycolysis is a substrate for the Krebs Cycle.|$|E
5|$|The {{electron}} transport pathways {{produced by}} these alternative NADH and ubiquinone oxidases have lower ATP yields than the full pathway. The advantages {{produced by a}} shortened pathway are not entirely clear. However, the alternative oxidase is produced in response to stresses such as cold, reactive oxygen species, and infection by pathogens, {{as well as other}} factors that inhibit the full electron <b>transport</b> <b>chain.</b> Alternative pathways might, therefore, enhance an organisms' resistance to injury, by reducing oxidative stress.|$|E
5|$|The redox {{energy from}} NADH and FADH2 is {{transferred}} to oxygen (O2) in several steps via the electron <b>transport</b> <b>chain.</b> These energy-rich molecules are produced within the matrix via the citric acid cycle but are also produced in the cytoplasm by glycolysis. Reducing equivalents from the cytoplasm can be imported via the malate-aspartate shuttle system of antiporter proteins or feed into the electron <b>transport</b> <b>chain</b> using a glycerol phosphate shuttle. Protein complexes in the inner membrane (NADH dehydrogenase (ubiquinone), cytochrome c reductase, and cytochrome c oxidase) perform the transfer and the incremental release of energy is used to pump protons (H+) into the intermembrane space. This process is efficient, but {{a small percentage of}} electrons may prematurely reduce oxygen, forming reactive oxygen species such as superoxide. This can cause oxidative stress in the mitochondria and may contribute to the decline in mitochondrial function associated with the aging process.|$|E

[...] Bacteria can use {{a number}} of different electron donors, {{a number of different}} dehydrogenases, a number of different oxidases and reductases, and a number of different electron acceptors. [...] For example, E. coli (when growing aerobically using glucose as an energy source) uses two different NADH dehydrogenases and two different quinol oxidases, for a total of four different electron <b>transport</b> <b>chains</b> operating simultaneously.|$|R
25|$|Electron <b>transport</b> <b>chains</b> {{are major}} sites of {{premature}} electron leakage to oxygen, generating superoxide and potentially resulting in increased oxidative stress.|$|R
5|$|Although it is {{important}} in catabolism, NADH is also used in anabolic reactions, such as gluconeogenesis. This need for NADH in anabolism poses a problem for prokaryotes growing on nutrients that release {{only a small amount}} of energy. For example, nitrifying bacteria such as Nitrobacter oxidize nitrite to nitrate, which releases sufficient energy to pump protons and generate ATP, but not enough to produce NADH directly. As NADH is still needed for anabolic reactions, these bacteria use a nitrite oxidoreductase to produce enough proton-motive force to run part of the electron <b>transport</b> <b>chain</b> in reverse, generating NADH.|$|E
5|$|In many organisms {{the capture}} of solar energy is similar in {{principle}} to oxidative phosphorylation, as it involves the storage of energy as a proton concentration gradient. This proton motive force then drives ATP synthesis. The electrons needed to drive this electron <b>transport</b> <b>chain</b> come from light-gathering proteins called photosynthetic reaction centres or rhodopsins. Reaction centers are classed into two types {{depending on the type}} of photosynthetic pigment present, with most photosynthetic bacteria only having one type, while plants and cyanobacteria have two.|$|E
5|$|In {{oxidative}} phosphorylation, {{the electrons}} removed from organic molecules {{in areas such}} as the protagon acid cycle are transferred to oxygen and the energy released is used to make ATP. This is done in eukaryotes by a series of proteins in the membranes of mitochondria called the electron <b>transport</b> <b>chain.</b> In prokaryotes, these proteins are found in the cell's inner membrane. These proteins use the energy released from passing electrons from reduced molecules like NADH onto oxygen to pump protons across a membrane.|$|E
25|$|These {{proteins}} {{are involved}} in electron <b>transport</b> <b>chains.</b> They include cytochrome c, cupredoxins, high potential iron protein, adrenodoxin reductase, some flavoproteins, and others.|$|R

40|$|Trimodal <b>transport</b> <b>chains</b> for {{containerised}} seaport {{hinterland traffic}} are {{often referred to}} by actors {{in the field of}} inland navigation as a major possibility to increase the transport volume of inland navigation in container traffic and to strengthen the position of inland ports as trimodal hinterland-hubs in container <b>transport</b> <b>chains.</b> However, a sound scientific investigation of the feasibility of trimodal <b>transport</b> <b>chains</b> in relation to alternative transport offers in containerised seaport hinterland traffic has been missing so far. For this purpose, a suitable modelling approach has been developed in this research, which combines the detailed process analysis of trimodal seaport hinterland traffic with the use of geographical information systems (GIS) for intermodal transport. Based on the detailed process analysis of intermodal seaport hinterland traffic, a new typology of combined transport terminals in seaports is proposed and, in particular, necessary enhancements of nowadays available GIS in the transport sector with respect to specific infrastructure restrictions of each transport mode are defined in the form of attributes of the road, rail and inland waterway networks. These will allow for a significantly wider use of GIS as a knowldge base for the planning of intermodal transport networks in the future. Furthermore, through the development of calculation schemes for the detailed modelling of process times and costs of combined seaport hinterland traffic, extensive scenarios of trimodal <b>transport</b> <b>chains</b> have been calculated. The results show that for a major part of goods transported in containers, from low-value bulk cargo up to relatively high-value electronic goods, trimodal <b>transport</b> <b>chains</b> are feasible compared to direct rail transport...|$|R
5|$|Some prokaryotes use redox pairs {{that have}} only a small {{difference}} in midpoint potential. For example, nitrifying bacteria such as Nitrobacter oxidize nitrite to nitrate, donating the electrons to oxygen. The small amount of energy released in this reaction is enough to pump protons and generate ATP, {{but not enough to}} produce NADH or NADPH directly for use in anabolism. This problem is solved by using a nitrite oxidoreductase to produce enough proton-motive force to run part of the electron <b>transport</b> <b>chain</b> in reverse, causing complex I to generate NADH.|$|E
5|$|The {{electron}} <b>transport</b> <b>chain</b> carries both {{protons and}} electrons, passing electrons from donors to acceptors, and transporting protons across a membrane. These processes use both soluble and protein-bound transfer molecules. In mitochondria, electrons are transferred within the intermembrane space by the water-soluble electron transfer protein cytochrome c. This carries only electrons, {{and these are}} transferred by the reduction and oxidation of an iron atom that the protein holds within a heme group in its structure. Cytochrome c {{is also found in}} some bacteria, where it is located within the periplasmic space.|$|E
5|$|The enzymes of the {{citric acid}} cycle {{are located in}} the {{mitochondrial}} matrix, with the exception of succinate dehydrogenase, which is bound to the inner mitochondrial membrane as part of Complex II. The citric acid cycle oxidizes the acetyl-CoA to carbon dioxide, and, in the process, produces reduced cofactors (three molecules of NADH and one molecule of FADH2) that are a source of electrons for the electron <b>transport</b> <b>chain,</b> and a molecule of GTP (that is readily converted to an ATP).|$|E
40|$|AbstractIsoprenoid quinones {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} groups of compounds occurring in membranes of living organisms. These compounds are composed of a hydrophilic head group and an apolar isoprenoid side chain, giving the molecules a lipid-soluble character. Isoprenoid quinones function mainly as electron and proton carriers in photosynthetic and respiratory electron <b>transport</b> <b>chains</b> and these compounds show also additional functions, such as antioxidant function. Most of naturally occurring isoprenoid quinones belong to naphthoquinones or evolutionary younger benzoquinones. Among benzoquinones, the most widespread and important are ubiquinones and plastoquinones. Menaquinones, belonging to naphthoquinones, function in respiratory and photosynthetic electron <b>transport</b> <b>chains</b> of bacteria. Phylloquinone K 1, a phytyl naphthoquinone, functions in the photosynthetic electron transport in photosystem I. Ubiquinones participate in respiratory chains of eukaryotic mitochondria and some bacteria. Plastoquinones are components of photosynthetic electron <b>transport</b> <b>chains</b> of cyanobacteria and plant chloroplasts. Biosynthetic pathway of isoprenoid quinones has been described, as well as their additional, recently recognized, diverse functions in bacterial, plant and animal metabolism...|$|R
25|$|Because NADP+ {{reduction}} removes electrons {{from the}} electron <b>transport</b> <b>chains,</b> {{they must be}} replaced—the job of photosystem II, which splits water molecules (H2O) to obtain the electrons from its hydrogen atoms.|$|R
25|$|A {{small amount}} of ATP is {{available}} from substrate-level phosphorylation, for example, in glycolysis. In most organisms the majority of ATP is generated in electron <b>transport</b> <b>chains,</b> while only some obtain ATP by fermentation.|$|R
5|$|The {{most common}} set of catabolic {{reactions}} in animals can be separated into three main stages. In the first stage, large organic molecules, such as proteins, polysaccharides or lipids, are digested into their smaller components outside cells. Next, these smaller molecules are taken up by cells and converted to smaller molecules, usually acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), which releases some energy. Finally, the acetyl group on the CoA is oxidised to water and {{carbon dioxide in the}} citric acid cycle and electron <b>transport</b> <b>chain,</b> releasing the energy that is stored by reducing the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) into NADH.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} {{well-known}} drugs and toxins that inhibit oxidative phosphorylation. Although {{any one of}} these toxins inhibits only one enzyme in the electron <b>transport</b> <b>chain,</b> inhibition of any step in this process will halt the rest of the process. For example, if oligomycin inhibits ATP synthase, protons cannot pass back into the mitochondrion. As a result, the proton pumps are unable to operate, as the gradient becomes too strong for them to overcome. NADH is then no longer oxidized and the citric acid cycle ceases to operate because the concentration of NAD+ falls below the concentration that these enzymes can use.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{has been}} shown to have at least three {{additional}} modes of action. It uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria, by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix, where it ionizes once again to release protons. Aspirin buffers and transports the protons. When high doses are given, it may actually cause fever, owing to the heat released from the electron <b>transport</b> <b>chain,</b> as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses. In addition, aspirin induces the formation of NO-radicals in the body, which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation. This reduced leukocyte adhesion is an important step in the immune response to infection; however, evidence is insufficient to show aspirin helps to fight infection. More recent data also suggest salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signaling through NF-κB. NF-κB, a transcription factor complex, plays a central role in many biological processes, including inflammation.|$|E
