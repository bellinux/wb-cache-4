25|$|When Alaska and Hawaii {{were being}} {{considered}} for statehood in the 1950s, more than 1,500 designs were submitted to President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Although {{some of them were}} 49-star versions, the vast majority were 50-star proposals. At least three of these designs were identical to the present design of the 50-star flag. At the <b>time,</b> <b>credit</b> was given by the executive department to the United States Army Institute of Heraldry for the design.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the clues}} had changes to their rules. The Detour and Roadblock retain their rules, {{although}} there is no limit on individual Roadblocks. Fast Forwards appear in the race, but they are not optional. Instead, the team that completes it fastest gets a two-hour <b>time</b> <b>credit.</b> Also featured alongside the Detour and Roadblock is the Intersection. However, the Intersection's rules are drastically different. It is a task that all teams complete, similar to an additional task on the real race.|$|E
25|$|Once the Pit Stop is complete, {{the team}} is given their next clue and allowed to start racing again. Each team's Pit Stop was {{originally}} 12 hours long starting {{from the time they}} reached the mat, or made longer with additional 24-hour segments as needed as to appear 12 hours long during broadcast. In more recent seasons, Pit Stop times have varied both longer or shorter to avoid teams loitering in airports or other areas. Penalties from the previous leg may also be applied to a team's Pit Stop time. Teams are responsible for being ready to leave at the correct time, and are given no <b>time</b> <b>credit</b> should they miss their departure time. In most cases, Teams leave from the same location they ended the previous leg at, but some Pit Stops have been on mobile housing, such as riverboats, with their point of departure changed {{during the course of the}} Pit Stop.|$|E

The potential of <b>time</b> <b>credits</b> to interact with local economies has been questioned as alternative community currencies show greater compatibility with business.

Drawing on recent research with a time bank in the Welsh valleys, this paper explores these two issues, to consider the potential of time banks for local economies, beyond their social intervention status. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceUnion-Find is {{a famous}} {{example of a}} simple data {{structure}} whose amortized asymptotic time complexity analysis is nontrivial. We present a Coq formalization of this analysis, following Alstrup et al. 's recent proof (2014). Moreover, we implement Union-Find as an OCaml library and formally endow it with a modular specification that offers a full functional correctness guarantee {{as well as an}} amortized complexity bound. In order to reason in Coq about imperative OCaml code, we use the CFML tool, which implements Separation Logic for a subset of OCaml, and which we extend with <b>time</b> <b>credits.</b> Although it was known in principle that amortized analysis can be explained in terms of <b>time</b> <b>credits</b> and that <b>time</b> <b>credits</b> can be viewed as resources in Separation Logic, we believe our work is the first practical demonstration of this approach. Finally, in order to explain the meta-theoretical foundations of our approach, we define a Separation Logic with <b>time</b> <b>credits</b> for an untyped call-by-value lambda-calculus, and formally verify its soundness...|$|R

5000|$|The petitioner, Michael Barber, sought {{habeas corpus}} {{in a federal}} {{district}} court. He argued that the Bureau of Prisons [...] "inaccurately calculated his good <b>time</b> <b>credit</b> toward the service of his federal sentence." [...] Barber argued that the BOP should have calculated good <b>time</b> <b>credit</b> based on the sentence imposed rather than the time actually served in prison. Barbers petition was denied by the district court, on appeal the Ninth Circuit affirmed the ruling of the lower courts citing Tablada v. Daniels noting that the good <b>time</b> <b>credit</b> statute was ambiguous and the BOP's interpretation was reasonable.|$|E

50|$|Prior to 2010, {{it was not}} {{uncommon}} for accused criminals, particularly in cases where there was a strong likelihood of conviction, to consent to their own detention. This was because it had become customary for judges to grant double <b>time</b> <b>credit</b> and even triple <b>time</b> <b>credit</b> for time served prior to sentencing. Amendments to the Criminal Code that took effect in 2010 greatly reduced the discretion of judges to offer credit for time served in remand in excess of the actual time served. Only credit in equivalent to time and a half is now permitted, and even then only in extraordinary circumstances. As a result, defendants are now much less willing to consent to detention, and Crown prosecutors are less willing to consent to the release of the accused.|$|E
