40|$|Abstract The {{definition}} of geographic and product markets {{is a critical}} aspect of any antitrust analysis. This paper argues for {{a different approach to}} market defini-tion in areas where insurance plans that contract selectively are a significant market presence. Such a proposed approach is described and some policy implications are drawn. <b>The</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> proposing a reform of the health care based on the principle of managed competition. This proposal, as implied by its name, contains some elements to rationalize the management {{of the health care system}} and others to increase its competitiveness. These ele-ments will require antitrust enforcement to make subtle distinctions be-tween pro- and anticompetitive combinations, that is, between the com-binations of providers and insurers that add to consumer choice and those that reduce it. This paper is an attempt to provide a conceptual framework for this difficult enforcement task. We start from the perspective that much can be learned from the ex-perience of procompetition policies in the 1980 s, particularly from areas with insurance plans that contract selectively. We argue that the growth of such plans implies the need to develop a new approach to analyzing hospital markets.

40|$|The USA is in {{the middle}} of the pack of {{industrial}} countries as regards the public debt-GOP and public deficit-GOP ratios. The period since 1980 is the only peace-time period outside the Great Depression to see a sustained increase in the debt-GOP ratio. The budgetary retrenchment planned by <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> likely to prove insufficient to achieve a sustainable path. although the remaining permanent primary (noninterest) gap is small: between 0. 1 % and 1. 0 % of GOP. The maximal amount of seigniorage revenue that can be extracted at a constant rate of inflation is not far from the recent historical value of less that 0. 5 % of GOP. Subtracting net public sector investment from the conventional budget deficit is likely to overstate the government revenue producing potential of public sector investment. Public debt matters when markets are incomplete and/or lump-sum taxes are restricted. Future interest payments associated with the public debt are not equivalent to currently expected future transfer payments. Even ignoring the distortionary character of most real-world taxes and transfers. and holding constant the government's exhaustive spending program, the "generational accounts" are therefore not a sufficient statistic for the effect on aggregate consumption of the government's tax-transfer program.

40|$|One of {{the many}} curious revelations in the {{increasingly}} bizarre saga of the presidential pardon of Marc Rich in the twilight hours of <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> especially fascinating to the student of international human rights law. Former President Clinton, in justifying the pardon, explained that Mr. Rich was an unheralded human rights activist. Among his apparently numerous, but unacknowledged, good deeds, one stands out for its carefully crafted hypocrisy. Mossad, the Israeli covert action agency, arranged for Mr. Rich secretly to transfer 400, 000 to the Egyptian government, which then established a fund to compensate the families of Israeli victims of a shooting attack by an Egyptian soldier who had run amok in a tourist area near the Egyptian-Israeli border. Thanks to Mr. Rich 2 ̆ 7 s anonymous generosity, Egypt could appear to be making voluntary payments to the families, thereby seeming to acknowledge the grave human rights violations that had occurred, while expressing Egypt 2 ̆ 7 s contrition for them. Israeli public opinion, which had been aroused by the murders, would be assuaged, while those who viewed events through a human rights lens could take satisfaction in the 2 ̆ 2 fact 2 ̆ 2 that, though horrible things continue to happen, {{the world as a}} whole is increasingly sensitive and responsive to human rights claims.

40|$|It {{has been}} ten years since A {{nation at risk}} (National Commission on Excellence in Education, 1983) set the USA off on a course to address the ’mediocrity ’ of its public schooling. Seeking to promote {{systemic}} change, this ’excellence ’ movement of educational reform (for example, Finn, 1991) now struggles {{to stay the course}} despite the nation’s weak economy and competing social and political agenda. Suffice it to say, the goal of educational excellence has yet to be attained. Political and social debates set excellence against equity. The excellence movement pushes to assure an ’internationally competitive ’ citizenry, sometimes arguing for private competition to prod the public education system. The equity movement fears that the excellence strategy will leave many children behind (for example, Viadero, 1993) and demands resources to create ’opportunities to learn ’ for disadvantaged students. (With the political rhetoric, perfectly good words became codewords, e. g., ’excellence ’ and ’equity’ came to be associated with right- and left-wing thought, respectively, thus obscuring much of the complexity of the issues.) <b>The</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>administration</b> <b>is</b> currently trying to negotiate between these two positions with its proposed education reform bill, the ’Goals 2000 : Educate America Act’, which carries forward from the Bush administration several reforms, the most important of which in this reporter’s view is standards-based education (SBE).

40|$|During the 1980 's, {{a period}} of intense concern over {{educational}} quality in the United States, few indicators of U. S. student achievement garnered the interest of policy makers and pundits as successfully as the results of international testing in mathematics and science. This concern {{was so great that}} {{as a part of the}} Goals 2000 initiative, President George Bush indicated that 'By the year 2000, U. S. students should be first in the world in mathematics and science. ' <b>The</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>is</b> placing a major emphasis, not only on rigorous academic standards and creating a new system for assessing students' progress, but also including professional development as a major focus. The argument being that teachers need more sustained, intensive training to prepare them to teach to higher standards. Executive order 12821 mandates that national laboratories 'assist in the mathematics and science education of our Nation's students, teachers, parents and the public by establishing programs at their agency to provide for training elementary and secondary school teachers to improve their knowledge of mathematics and science'. These and other issues led to the development of ideas for a project that addresses the need for excellence in mathematics, science and technology instruction. In response to these initiatives the NASA/LaRC Teacher Enhancement Institute was proposed. The TEI incorporated systemic reform perspectives, enhanced content knowledge for teachers, and teacher preparation. Emphasis was also placed on recruiting those educators who teach in impoverished urban school districts with at-risk student populations who have been traditionally under represented in science, mathematics, technology and engineering. Participants in the Teacher Enhancement Institute were 37 teachers from grades K- 8, teaching in Region 2 in the state of Virginia, as well as 2 preservice teachers from Norfolk State University and one teacher from Dublin, Virginia, where a Science/Mathematics model school has been established. Teachers selected for this project represented school systems where income levels are extremely low, and students served tend not to receive innovative instruction in mathematics and science and their use of technology is limited. The Teacher Enhancement Institute contained several features, that when combined, allowed for a unique experience. Some of these features included local teachers, administrators and school board members as presenters, instruction and use of technology every day, tours of select features of the research facility, briefings by NASA/LaRC scientists, engineers and researchers as well as individuals from the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF). Another unique feature of this program is to have participants convene on three separate occasions throughout the academic year to discuss strategies for information dissemination and implementation results. Teachers' attitudes towards the use of technology, their ability to develop lessons using technology and their ability to develop lessons using information obtained through TEI were assessed using instruments developed by TEI summer faculty members. Data from these instruments were analyzed and reported in a final report submitted to the director of the Office of Education...|$|E
