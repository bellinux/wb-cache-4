It is not uncommon for a team's actual draft pick to differ from their assigned draft pick, or for a team to have extra or no draft picks in any round due to these <b>trades.</b> <b>Of</b> the players selected in each draft and throughout its history, East Carolina has had 63 players picked.|$|E

The Chicago Cubs sought a {{slugging}} first baseman to replace the injured Derrek Lee, and the Rangers traded Nevin to Chicago on May 31, 2006. The Rangers received second baseman and outfielder Jerry Hairston, Jr. in return. The Rangers also agreed to pay the difference in the two players' salaries. On August 31, the deadline for <b>trades</b> <b>of</b> players who had cleared waivers, the Cubs traded Nevin to the Twins for cash and a player to be named later. To make room for Nevin, Twins' outfielder Shannon Stewart was placed on the 60-day disabled list.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, the Heffrons {{moved to}} Melbourne, Victoria. That same year in Victoria, Heffron was {{appointed}} an organiser for the Federated Clothing <b>Trades</b> <b>of</b> the Commonwealth of Australia and also joined the leftist Victorian Socialist Party. Later in 1921 {{he moved to}} Sydney, becoming {{the secretary of the}} New South Wales branch of the Federated Marine Stewards' and Pantrymen's Association of Australasia. As the union's state secretary, a role he would hold for ten years, he took a prominent role in maritime trade unionism in Sydney. In February 1924, when the Commonwealth and Dominion Line steamer Port Lyttelton was declared 'Black' by the Labor Council of New South Wales owing to various worker's disputes and the ship having been declared unseaworthy, Heffron and six other union representatives acted to advise members of the Seamen's Union to refuse to work on the Port Lyttelton. For this, in April the government of Sir George Fuller had Heffron and the six other unionists arrested on the charge of conspiracy to strike action. Although controversially refused bail by the trial judge, Heffron and his fellow defendants, represented by Richard Windeyer KC and H. V. Evatt, were found not guilty and released in July 1924 by the court, a verdict that had been returned by the direction of the judge. Later joining the Australian Labor Party, at the time he showed himself to be a supporter of party leader Jack Lang, supporting Lang's successful motion at the 1923 state conference to readmit James Dooley to the party.|$|E

25|$|Prime brokers are broker-dealers {{which offer}} custody and other {{services}} to hedge funds.

40|$|Attempts {{have been}} made in this study to examine the terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> <b>of</b> Thailand during export {{situation}} relative to import situation, and the gains or losses and welfare condition of the country in international trade can be known. On account of the unavailability of some of the relevant data, this study cannot cover all the concepts of the terms <b>of</b> <b>trade.</b> Hence, this study will concentrate only on the analysis which can be measured. The concepts of the terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> in this study are the net barter terms <b>of</b> <b>trade,</b> the gross barter terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> and the income terms <b>of</b> <b>trade.</b> This study will investigate the trend of Thailand 2 ̆ 7 s terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> in the period between 1975 and 1981, terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> <b>of</b> Thailand and Japan, terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> <b>of</b> Thailand and the United States, terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> <b>of</b> Thailand and ASEAN, and terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> <b>of</b> Thailand and EEC.

40|$|My {{empirical}} analysis a {{reveals a}} strong {{link between the}} terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> <b>of</b> industrial and developing countries. I show that the terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> developing countries are essentially the relative prices of commodity exports and manufactured imports. Similarly, I find that terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> fluctuations <b>of</b> industrial countries are heavily influenced by movements in the relative price of manufactured exports and commodity imports. This means that improvements in the terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> <b>of</b> developing countries imply a worsening in the terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> <b>of</b> developing industrial countries, and vice versa. One {{example of this is}} the explosion of oil prices in the early 1970 s. The terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> industrial countries worsened considerably, while the terms <b>of</b> <b>trade</b> <b>of</b> oil exporting countries improved dramatically. This episode led to a sizeable loss of income for industrial countries (of around 3 percent) and a sizeable gain in real income for oil exporting countries (of roughly 80 percent).

25|$|Children {{are also}} used in drug trades in all regions of the world. Specifically, {{children}} are often trafficked into exploitation as either drug couriers or dealers, and then 'paid' in drugs, such that they become addicted and further entrapped. Due to the illicit nature of drug trafficking, children who are apprehended are often treated as criminals, when in reality they are often the ones in need of legal assistance. While comprehensive worldwide statistics regarding the prevalence of this practice are unknown, several useful regional studies have been conducted. For example, the I.L.O has recently investigated the use of Afghan children in the heroin trade and child involvement in the drug <b>trades</b> <b>of</b> Brazil. Scholar Luke Dowdney specifically studied children {{in the drug trade}} in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; he found that children involved in the drug trades are at significantly higher risk of engaging in violence, particularly murder.|$|E
25|$|Most large {{derivatives}} exchanges operate their own clearing houses, {{allowing them to}} take revenues from post-trade processing as well as trading itself. By netting off the different positions traded, a smaller amount of capital is required as security to cover the <b>trades.</b> <b>Of</b> the big derivatives venues Chicago Mercantile Exchange, ICE and Eurex all clear trades themselves. There is sometimes a division of responsibility between provision of trading facility, and that of clearing and settlement of those trades. Derivative exchanges like the CBOE and LIFFE take responsibility for providing the trading environments, settlement of the resulting trades are usually handled by clearing houses that serve as central counterparties to trades done in the respective exchanges. The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) and LCH.Clearnet (London Clearing House) respectively are the clearing corporations for CBOE and LIFFE, although LIFFE and parent NYSE Euronext has long stated its desire to develop its own clearing service.|$|E
25|$|The {{existence}} of a Jewish community in Włodawa is first recorded {{in connection with the}} Lublin fair of 1531. By 1623 Włodawa had a representative in the Council of the Four Lands.

For much of the early modern period, a time when the Polish-speaking community of the region was predominately engaged in agriculture, Jews appear to have composed much {{of the population of the}} city, engaged in all forms of craft production and trade. The community was devastated by the Chmielnicki massacres of 1648, but afterwards was re-established and rebuilt. By 1765 the town had 630 Jews. In 1693, the town had 197 dwellings, 89 of which were owned by Jewish families.
