5|$|Atomic nitrogen, {{also known}} as active nitrogen, is highly reactive, being a triradical with three {{unpaired}} electrons. Free nitrogen atoms easily react with most elements to form nitrides, and even when <b>two</b> <b>free</b> nitrogen atoms collide to produce an excited N2 molecule, they may release so much energy on collision with even such stable molecules as carbon dioxide and water to cause homolytic fission into radicals such as CO and O or OH and H. Atomic nitrogen is prepared by passing an electric discharge through nitrogen gas at 0.1–2mmHg, which produces atomic nitrogen along with a peach-yellow emission that fades slowly as an afterglow for several minutes even after the discharge terminates.|$|E
