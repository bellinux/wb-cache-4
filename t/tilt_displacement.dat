40|$|PURPOSE: We {{aimed to}} {{minimize}} the effect of ocular microfluctuations during videokeratoscopy to improve the qualitative and quantitative analysis of corneal topography. METHODS: A technique was developed to measure the <b>tilt,</b> <b>displacement,</b> and cyclotorsion in multiple videokeratographs from the same cornea. This information was used to reposition each videokeratograph according to the average position of a sample of multiple measurements. The corneal topography of 10 subjects was measured 20 times each, using videokeratoscopy. RESULTS: The {{root mean square error}} calculated from difference between single videokeratographs and the average videokeratograph decreased by an average of 24. 6 % for the 10 subjects' data. The standard deviation of some terms of Zernike polynomials fitted to the cornea was significantly reduced after the procedure. CONCLUSION: The method that we propose can improve the precision performance of videokeratoscopy in multiple measurements of corneal topography...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} results of a recent search for the lowest value of thermal noise that can be {{achieved}} in LIGO by changing the shape of mirrors, while fixing the mirror radius and maintaining a low diffractional loss. The result of this minimization is a beam with thermal noise a factor of 2. 32 (in power) lower than previously considered Mesa Beams and a factor of 5. 45 (in power) lower than the Gaussian beams employed in the current baseline design. Mirrors that confine these beams {{have been found to be}} roughly conical in shape, with an average slope approximately equal to the mirror radius divided by arm length, and with mild corrections varying at the Fresnel scale. Such a mirror system, if built, would impact the sensitivity of LIGO, increasing the event rate of observing gravitational waves in the frequency range of maximum sensitivity roughly by a factor of 3 compared to an Advanced LIGO using Mesa beams (assuming all other noises remain unchanged). We discuss the resulting beam and mirror properties and study requirements on mirror <b>tilt,</b> <b>displacement,</b> and figure error, in order for this beam to be used in LIGO detectors...|$|E
40|$|We {{illustrate}} {{an approach}} which allows determining the out-of-plane {{component of the}} vortex core (polarity) in NiFe nanodots using Fresnel imaging in Lorentz electron microscopy. Using tilted Fresnel images, contribution of the polarity is introduced into the Fresnel image. However, this contribution is relatively small and a difference image from two symmetrically tilted Fresnel images must be used to eliminate the strong contribution from the in-plane curling magnetization and non-magnetic contrast. The sense of the polarity appears as a bipolar white black contrast in the difference image on the tilt axis. A vortex core with a diameter of 16. 5 &# 177; 2. 5 nm is experimentally measured. Image <b>tilting,</b> <b>displacement</b> and geometrical distortion may disturb the difference image, and hence subtraction of the difference image must be aligned by cross-correlation. The method is also justified by {{a study of the}} observed contrast characteristic due to misalignment.

40|$|II Geometric {{correction}} of remote sensing imagery is indispensable {{for the purpose}} of data integration and applications. Conventional ortho-rectification only considers the {{correction of}} <b>tilt</b> <b>displacements</b> and terrain relief displacements. Since high-resolution imagery captures more detailed information, the abrupt changes of object elevation result in the relief displacements and occlusions in image space. In urban areas, high-rise buildings and multi-layer road systems of orthoimages cause serious image deformation. True-orthorectification procedures take account of ground objects for the correction of relief displacements and compensation of the hidden areas. Accordingly, the true orthoimages provide the exact position of land objects. This research focuses on the man-made constructions, including buildings and roads. Thus, the generation of true orthoimages is done by integration of building, road, and terrain models. The test data comprise three dimensional building models, road models and digital terrain models, and multi-view aerial images are employed for the compensation of hidden areas. The proposed scheme includes：(1) visibility analysis, (2) hidden detection, (3) hidden compensation, and (4) shadow enhancement. Three test sites includie...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well know}} that it is {{possible}} to use the vanishing point geometry to assess the orientation parameters of the photographic image. Here we propose a numerical or graphical procedure to estimate such parameters, assuming that in the imaged object are present planar surfaces, straight-line edges, and right angles. In addition, by means of the same estimated parameters, it is possible to project the same image onto a selected plane say to rectify the image. The advantages are that non-metric images, taken from archives or books also, provided a good geometry and quality, are suitable for the task. From one side the role of the classical line photogrammetry is taken more and more over by laser scanning, and on the other side, this simplified procedure enables the researcher to use photogrammetric techniques for stereoscopy and interpretation, thematic mapping, research. The convergent nonstereoscopic images rectified with digital photogrammetric techniques, are then made suitable for stereoscopy. In fact the rectification corrects for <b>tilt</b> <b>displacement</b> and not for relief displacement, but it is just relief displacement that enables stereoscopy. Some examples of stereoplotting and photo-interpretation with digitally rectified photographs are shown. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} integrates existing LOD 2 building {{models and}} multiple close-range images for façade structural lines extraction. The major works are orientation determination and multiple image matching. In the orientation determination, Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF) {{is applied to}} extract tie points automatically. Then, tie points and control points are combined for block adjustment. An object-based multi-images matching is proposed to extract the façade structural lines. The 2 D lines in image space are extracted by Canny operator followed by Hough transform. The role of LOD 2 building models is to correct the <b>tilt</b> <b>displacement</b> of image from different views. The wall of LOD 2 model {{is also used to}} generate hypothesis planes for similarity measurement. Finally, average normalized cross correlation is calculated to obtain the best location in object space. The test images are acquired by a nonmetric camera Nikon D 2 X.

There is little research, however, regarding adaptations in trunk motion with pregnancy. In this paper, we investigated the application of two pattern recognition techniques: support vector machine (SVM) and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to detect differences in trunk kinematics, when walking, between women in late pregnancy and nulliparous (control) women. Test results indicate that the SVM can identify the trunk motion of pregnant women from their counterparts with a better accuracy compared to the LDA (71. 43 % vs 28. 57 % respectively). Furthermore, with a feature selection technique applied, the accuracy improved to 95. 24 % % using only 2 features namely the pelvic sagittal plane displacement and thoracic lateral <b>tilt</b> <b>displacement</b> at heel contact. The results suggest that for better detection of trunk motion changes in pregnant women, non-linear analysis may be required. The SVM was able to effectively differentiate pregnancy related trunk motion changes during a walking task which may indicate altered musculoskeletal loads with potential for injury or pain...|$|E

[Subjects and Methods] Seventeen patients participated in this study. Eight weeks of leg press or leg press with hip adduction training, including progressive lower-limb weight-training and stretching, was given. Patellar alignment (<b>tilt</b> and <b>displacement)</b> and pain measurements were conducted before and after leg press or leg press with hip adduction training.

40|$|The cornea is {{the most}} {{powerful}} refractive component of the eye and as such, subtle changes in corneal shape can cause substantial changes in the optical characteristics of the eye. Monocular diplopia has previously been linked to corneal distortion following near work in various studies but has not been investigated in detail. The work reported in this thesis has investigated the optical effects of corneal distortions caused by eyelid forces and demonstrated that several corneal higher and lower order Zernike wavefront aberrations can change following reading. Measuring subtle changes in corneal topography requires the highest possible instrument accuracy, while software analysis tools should be able to detect and highlight those subtle changes with high reliability.

40|$|AbstractPurpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to express quantitatively and {{noninvasively}} the efficiency of the venomuscular pump by using photoplethysmography (PPG). Method and patients: PPG was used to record volume changes induced by dorsiflexion resulting in exercise displacement volume (EDV) and subsequently by passive limb elevation resulting in <b>tilt</b> <b>displacement</b> volume (TDV). Dividing EDV by TDV yields efficiency of the venomuscular pump. Twenty-four control subjects, 21 patients with venous valvular insufficiency (VVI), and 10 additional patients with both VVI and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) were studied. Data for one leg in each subject are reported. Though calculation of efficiency does not require calibrated or quantitative PPG, in this case because we used calibrated PPG we recorded the respective values for EDV after dorsiflexion and TDV after passive leg elevation. Results: EDV decreased from a normal value of 3. 15 % optical reflectance (% OR) to 1. 68 % OR in patients with VVI and 1. 09 % OR in patients with VVI plus DVT. TDV response was quite opposite, increasing from 6. 55 % OR in the control group to 10. 30 % OR in the VVI group and 16. 66 % OR in the VVI plus DVT group. Finally, efficiency decreased from the average normal value of 50. 5 % to 24. 4 % in the VVI group and 8. 8 % in the VVI plus DVT group. Conclusion: Dividing EDV by TDV, venomuscular efficiency can be determined and may be considered a useful index of venous hemodynamics. (J Vasc Surg 2003; 37 : 839 - 41. ...|$|E
40|$|Local {{earthquakes}} with magnitudes of>• 2. 5 {{and within}} 20 - 50 km of tiltmeters along the San Andreas fault typically generate offsets in tilt, tilt seismograms, and impulsive tilt behavior {{at the time}} of the earthquake. The amplitudes and azimuths of the coseismic tilt offsets from local earthquakes observed at a small array of four instruments approximately 30 km south of Hollister, California, are compared to the amplitudes and azimuths predicted by a rectangular source, elastic half-space dislocation model. Almost all observed coseismic offset amplitudes are 1 - 3 orders of magnitude larger than the predicted amplitudes. The predicted offset azimuths also are not in agreement with the observed azimuths. There is neither a uniform method of scaling the predicted amplitudes nor a constant rotation that may be applied to the predicted azimuths that will consistently reproduce the observed offsets. Errors in hypocenter location and fault plane orientation are not sufficient to explain the discrepancies between observations and predictions. Similar results occur for teleseismic earthquakes. A lack of agreement in the observed offset amplitudes across the array indicates that tilt changes are triggered at or near the instrument site by the passage of seismic waves. No significant agreement was obtained between the direction of coseismic tilts and either the secular tilt trends or local geologic features. Triggered movement on near-surface cracks, fractures, and minor faults appears the most viable physical explanation for the observed offsets. Short-base-line near-surface tiltmeters appear inadequate for measuring <b>tilt</b> <b>displacement</b> fields generated by local earthquakes. Deep borehole installations appear necessary for this measurement. Coseismic tilt transients appear to be caused by seismically induced water table perturbations near the tiltmeter site...|$|E

Employing an inexpensive rotating container of mercury as its primary parabolic mirror, the NASA LMT is a cost-effective alternative to telescopes utilizing glass mirrors. We detail criteria for mirror construction including environmental considerations via Hg vapor emission analysis.

40|$|The project {{analyses}} and tests the potential use of low cost hobbyist electronics {{to monitor and}} control mechanical faults in Coal Wagons. An Arduino Due micro- controller board and sensors {{similar to those found}} in smart devices have been integrated into the initial concept. Low level hardware will make it financially viable to instrument wagons on a mass scale. Instrumentation to permanently monitor and control the mechanical condition of Coal Wagons is not commercially available; while the value of fixed track side systems is debatable. The idea behind this project was to use proven fixed plant condition monitoring techniques, low cost consumer level electronics and 'the internet of things' to create a synergized solution to overcome the shortfalls of other systems. The objective of this project was to build and program a controller unit to process and record data, while keeping the design open for later integration of an ABS system. A Failure Modes, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA) was conducted on Coal Wagons to identify the mechanical componentry in need of monitoring. Research was conducted on low weight algorithms for processing data, sensor types, communication protocols and C/C++ programming. Currently the unit can process and log vibration, temperature, acceleration, <b>tilt,</b> <b>displacement,</b> axle speed and strain data from sensors to an SD card, while averages are sent via a wireless 3 G router to an internet cloud service called Xively. GPS stamps are assigned to each data set which allows for tracking and mapping of faults on the rail corridor, either in real time as a Xively meta-data feed, or by downloading the data from the SD card and displaying it in 2 D or 3 D using Google Maps or Google Earth Pro respectively. More code debugging is required to improve program runtime and to add a greater degree of error checking capability.

40|$|The jumping front-leg axe-kick {{is a valid}} attacking and counterattacking {{technique}} in Taekwondo competition (Streif, 1993). Yet, the existing literature on this technique is sparse (Kloiber et al., 2009). Therefore, {{the goal of this}} study was to determine parameters contributing significantly to maximum linear speed of the foot at impact. Parameters are timing of segment and joint angular velocity characteristics and segment lengths of the kicking leg. Moreover, we were interested in the prevalence of proximal-to-distal-sequencing. Three-dimensional kinematics of the kicks of 22 male Taekwondo-athletes (age: 23. 3 ± 5. 3 years) were recorded via a motion capturing system (Vicon Motion Systems Limited, Oxford, UK). The participants performed maximum effort kicks onto a rack-held kicking pad. Only the kick with the highest impact velocity was analysed, as it was assumed to represent the individual’s best performance. Significant Pearson correlations to impact velocity were found for pelvis <b>tilt</b> angular <b>displacement</b> (r = 0. 468, p < 0. 05) and for hip extension angular velocity (r = - 0. 446, p < 0. 05) and for the timing of the minima of pelvis tilt velocity (r = - 0. 426, p < 0. 05) and knee flexion velocity (r = - 0. 480, p < 0. 05). Backward step linear regression analysis suggests a model consisting of three predictor variables: pelvis <b>tilt</b> angular <b>displacement,</b> hip flexion velocity at target contact and timing of pelvic tilt angular velocity minimum (adjusted R 2 = 0. 524). Results of Chi-Squared tests show that neither for the leg-raising period (χ 2 = 2. 909) of the technique, nor for the leg-lowering period a pattern of proximal-to-distal sequencing is prevalent (χ 2 = 0. 727). From the results we conclude that the jumping front-leg axe-kick does not follow a proximal-to-distal pattern.

40|$|The {{solid-state}} molecular {{disorder of}} pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB) {{and its role}} in causing anomalous dielectric properties are investigated. Normal coordinate analysis (NCA) of atomic mean-square displacement parameters (ADPs) is employed to distinguish disorder contributions from classical and quantum-mechanical vibrational contributions. The analysis relies on multitemperature (5 - 295 K) single-crystal neutron-diffraction data. Vibrational frequencies extracted from the temperature dependence of the ADPs are in good agreement with THz spectroscopic data. Aspects of the static disorder revealed by this work, primarily <b>tilting</b> and <b>displacement</b> of the molecules, are compared with corresponding results from previous, much more in-depth and time-consuming Monte Carlo simulations; their salient findings are reproduced by this work, demonstrating that the faster NCA approach provides reliable constraints for the interpretation of diffuse scattering. The dielectric properties of PCNB can thus be rationalized by an interpretation of the temperature-dependent ADPs in terms of thermal motion and molecular disorder. The use of atomic displacement parameters in the NCA approach is nonetheless hostage to reliable neutron data. The success of this study demonstrates that state-of-the-art single-crystal Laue neutron diffraction affords sufficiently fast the accurate data for this type of study. In general terms, the validation of this work opens up the field for numerous studies of solid-state molecular disorder in organic materials. © 2011, American Physical Societ...|$|R
40|$|Structural health {{assessment}} {{is an important}} practice to guarantee the safety of infrastructure in general. In case of dam monitoring, {{it is necessary to}} control the structure itself and the water reservoir, to guarantee efficient operation and safety of surrounding areas. Ensuring the longevity of the structure requires the timely detection of any behaviour that could deteriorate the dam and potentially result in its shutdown or failure. Traditional structural dam monitoring requires the identification of soil movements, <b>tilt,</b> <b>displacements,</b> stress and strain behaviour. The detection and monitoring of surface displacements is increasingly performed through the analysis of satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, thanks to the non-invasiveness of their acquisition, the possibility to cover large areas in a short time and the new space missions equipped with high spatial resolution sensors. The availability of SAR satellite acquisitions from the early 1990 s enables to reconstruct the historical evolution of dam behaviour, defining its key parameters, possibly from its construction to the present. Furthermore, the progress on SAR Interferometry (InSAR) techniques through the development of Differential InSAR (DInSAR) and Advanced stacking techniques (A-DInSAR) allows to obtain accurate velocity maps and displacement time-series. The importance of these techniques emerges when environmental or logistic conditions do not allow to monitor dams applying the traditional geodetic techniques. In such cases, A-DInSAR constitutes a reliable diagnostic tool of dam structural health to avoid any extraordinary failure that may lead to loss of lives. In this contest, an emblematic case will be analysed as test case: the Mosul Dam, the largest Iraqi dam, where monitoring and maintaining are impeded for political controversy, causing possible risks for the population security. In fact, it {{is considered one of the}} most dangerous dams in the world because of the erosion of the gypsum rock at the basement and the difficult interventions due to security problems. The dam consists of 113 m tall and 3. 4 km long earth-fill embankment-type, with a clay core, and it was completed in 1984. It started generating power on 1986. Specific objective consists in determining the degree of detail of dam surface strains that can be obtained from different satellite SAR datasets at different resolutions (microwaves X and C bands). Therefore, different datasets are analysed: the archive available SAR data (ERS and Envisat from ESA), the currently acquiring Sentinel data (EU Copernicus programme) and the high-resolution COSMO-SkyMed data (ASI program) over the study area (Mosul dam). The different stacks of data are processed applying SBAS and PS A-DInSAR techniques; the deformation fields obtained from SAR data are evaluated to assess the temporal evolution of the strains affecting the structure. Obtained results represent the preliminary stage of a multidisciplinary project, finalized to assess possible damages affecting a dam through remote sensing and civil engineering surveys...|$|R
2500|$|Crane Mountain is a fault-block {{geologic}} structure typical of southeast Oregon's basin and range country. [...] The primary rock {{that makes up}} the mountain is basalt. [...] The mountain has a west-facing fault scarp with a steep cliff face overlooking the Goose Lake Valley. [...] The mountain's fault-block <b>displacement</b> <b>tilts</b> layers of basalt upward to expose the underlying John Day rhyolite tuff formation on the western flank of the mountain. [...] Agates and thunder eggs {{are found in the}} rhyolite layers. [...] Small amounts of gold bearing quartz are also found on the southern slope of the mountain. [...] This is very unusual for an area dominated by basalt. [...] The soils around the mountain are typical of the area. [...] They are derived primarily from broken-down basalt and tuffaceous materials.|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} {{analytic}} {{description of the}} inter-element alignment effect of misaligned optical systems with circular pupils. The description shows that decenter and <b>tilt</b> produce lateral <b>displacement</b> {{of the field and}} pupil coordinates, whilst a despace directly modifies the aberration coefficients by perturbing paraxial distances and scale factors of the two coordinates. This reveals that a misaligned surface not only changes its aberration characteristics, but also affects those of subsequent surfaces, which is the essence of the inter-element alignment effect. This description, combined with primary aberration theory, was applied to various misaligned systems to approximate their aberrations and alignment sensitivities given by ray-tracing. The results demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of this approach. We also discuss the potential usefulness of the description in estimating the axial separations between surfaces...|$|R
50|$|The XU {{design was}} {{introduced}} in 1981 with the Peugeot 305. It was a SOHC or DOHC straight-4 design with two or four valves per cylinder, using petrol as fuel. It was applied transversely in front wheel drive vehicles only, <b>tilted</b> by 30°. <b>Displacement</b> ranged between 1580 and 1998 cc, and all production XU gasoline engines had a bore of 83 mm (3.3 in) or 86 mm (3.4 in). The engine uses in all models aluminium cylinder head. All models blocks are made, except XU10, in cast aluminium alloy with removable cast iron wet cylinder liners. XU10 blocks are made in cast iron, with bores machined directly in the block, without removable cylinder liners. Its first Citroën application was on the Citroën BX in 1983, where it appeared in 1580cc format.|$|R
