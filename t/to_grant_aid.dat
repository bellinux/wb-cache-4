When someone utters the name [...] "Pazuzu" [...] three {{consecutive}} times, the demon lord is telepathically linked to that person for one minute. During that time, Pazuzu is capable of reading the thoughts of whoever he is linked to, in addition to checking whether they are lawful or good. After confirming that whoever said his name isn't endeavoring to capture him on the Material Plane, Pazuzu appears before the speaker. Pazuzu grants the person aid, usually via his wish spell-like ability, and in reply asks that his name be repeated to others. The mortal's miraculous turn of fortune attracts other desperate souls. Pazuzu continues <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>aid</b> when called upon, each time producing more evil results. Eventually the cultists come to depend on him for their success, at which point he reveals his true nature. Those who try to repent are tortured and sacrificed. After a cult has committed its first sacrifice, Pazuzu abandons it and seeks out other prospects. Eventually the cult is destroyed by lawful and good forces; looters discover Pazuzu's name and the cycle's continuance is assured.|$|E
50|$|The ACTT Workshop Declaration was a {{ground-breaking}} agreement {{promulgated by}} the ACTT (now BECTU) in 1982, {{in consultation with}} the English Regional Arts Associations, the Welsh Arts Council, Channel Four and the BFI, recognising the alternative practices of the ‘workshops’ and constituting them to encourage a cultural, social and political contribution to society. The declaration was a radical step for a traditionally closed-shop union, and established working practices in the non-profit, cultural sector. Groups of four or more full-time members whose funding derived from public sources and who engaged in non-commercial work on a not-for-profit basis were enfranchised by the ACTT and given a condition <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>aid</b> for a period of 1, 2 or 3 years, freeing them from ‘the tyranny of continually searching for insecure short time funding from arts organisations’. Of immediate significance was that the ACTT placed the cultural and political ideologies of its new membership before wage concerns in allowing the groups to operate on an egalitarian minimum wage structure. The recognition of cross-grade practice also allowed filmworkers to gain experience in a range of roles and stipulated that the group and not the commissioner would own sole copyright to the work.|$|E

The author's principal purpose is to assess the fundamental input assumptions behind the public support of these projects. As a prerequisite he outlines the nature of the property-development decisionmaking process. In the subsequent analysis of the funding-appraisal process of urban regeneration projects he considers a number of issues about the level of the developer's profit, land values, and the value of completed projects. In conclusion the author makes an overall assessment of the approach <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>aid</b> for urban regeneration. ...|$|E

Beispiele solcher Vertragsklauseln werden vorgeschlagen. The German {{public law}} {{financial}} institutions {{benefit from an}} enhanced credit standing {{as a consequence of}} institutional and guarantee liability (Anstaltslast and Gewährträgerhaftung) hence are the beneficiaries of aid. The aid granted enables these institutions to fulfill their public duties but also enhances their competitive position, hence represents State Aid according to the EC-Treaty. The application of the State Aid principles of the EC-Treaty are compatible with the tasks assigned to the German public law financial institutions: Whilst property ownership rules must not be affected by the EC-Treaty, Member Sates must not act in a way that contravenes the Treaty provisions. The market economy investor principle does not allow a Member State <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>aid</b> as long as the supported institution remains in an economically viable position. The degree of aid granted can be masured by the enhanced credit rating. The value of unlimited aid is not comparable to civil law concepts such as guarantees, letters of comfort, profit sharing agreements or investor compensation schemes. Institutional and guarantee liability distorts competition. The Commission should therefore order Germany to abolish or alter the aid granted. Counterparties of public law financial institutions should accordingly insert safe harbour provisions/termination provisions/disclosure notes in derivatives, securities, credit and Capital Markets documentation.

The Commission is satisfied that the restructuring plan will ensure the long-term viability of Citadele banka, whilst allowing an orderly realisation of the assets remaining in Parex. The plan also includes an adequate contribution of the legacy capital holders to the restructuring costs as well as safeguards to limit the distortive effects of the received aid.

40|$|The {{subject for}} this thesis {{has been the}} {{relations}} between the European Union (EU) and the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP). In June 2000 the EU and the ACP States signed a new Partnership Agreement, the so-called Cotonou Agreement. This was a new step in {{the relations between the}}se two parties. These relations have long roots. It started in the late 1950 s with the Treaty of Rome and a system of association. In 1963 the Yaoundé Convention was signed, followed by Yaoundé II in 1969. In 1975 the Lome Convention was signed. This Convention was renegotiated several times. In the 1990 s the EU began a process of reviewing these relations and in 1996 the European Commission published a Green Paper on these relations. The Cotonou Agreement pays attention to issues such as poverty reduction, democracy and human rights, the economic, social and cultural development of the ACP States, conflict prevention and Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs). 	I chose to focus on the process which led to the Cotonou Agreement. My research question asks about the driving forces for the EU in this process. I have used two theoretical perspectives, realism/neo-realism and path dependence. From realism/neo-realism I have chosen to focus on interests, not only economic and security interests, but value-based interests as well. Path dependence is a theory used to describe social processes. According to this theory, when an actor has chosen a certain policy {{it is very difficult to}} reverse it. This thesis was designed as a theoretically interpretive case study in which I have used document analysis. Most of the sources are documents. 	The analysis is divided into two parts. The first part of the analysis deals with the interests of the European Union; economic, security and value-based interests. Integrating the ACP countries into the world economy is important to the EU, as the EU believed it would benefit from it. The EU was clearly interested in getting more access to the ACP markets and wanted reciprocity in trade arrangements. Economic development should be mutually advantageous. The EU also wanted to reform technical and financial cooperation, such as programming. The EU wanted <b>to</b> <b>grant</b> <b>aid</b> according to both need and merit. Rationalisation and more simplicity, as well as efficiency and flexibility were important to the EU. Security was given a lot more attention than previously. Armed conflicts, proliferation of nuclear weapons, terrorism and migration are considered the main threats by the EU. Further, the EU claims that promoting peace and stability is in their interest. Conflict prevention is central here. The EU wanted cooperation on security issues such as migration, trafficking, terrorism and pandemics. Values were also important to the EU: It was stated in the Green Paper that the EU wanted a world development that was more compatible with European values. Further, the EU argued it could contribute to institutional development in the ACP countries and that the EU had an interest in promoting solidarity. The economic and social dimension, and particularly poverty alleviation were of high importance to the EU. The EU is an actor with global ambitions and concerned with its image and reputation. 	In the Green Paper several options for a future partnership were discussed. In this case it was important to preserve the integrity of the Lome Convention. The EU decided that there would be an overall agreement, but with differentiation. The partnership was to be maintained and strengthened. There was a will to continue these relations, an ambition to revitalise the relations. These relations were even called a “culture” that had to be preserved. However, the EU was aware of the need to renew or change these relations due to international changes and the great challenges that the ACP countries are facing, such as poverty. The EU did have a will to continue, but there was also a sense of duty. It seemed rather unlikely that the EU would reverse these long-lasting relations. 	I conclude that the economic interests most likely were the most important interests for the EU, due to trade and reform of technical and financial assistance. Value-based interests were also of importance to the EU. Although security issues did get more attention than previously, it was not decisive, but more important. Further, the EU did have a strong will to continue the relations with the ACP, but most likely they had no choice but to continue. These relations can be characterised as path dependent. The driving forces are a combination of several factors; various interests and path dependence...|$|E
