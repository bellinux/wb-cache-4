The method of supplying energy to the system had a profound influence on the drying rate and on the internal temperature of the samples during drying. The drying time of (S) -N-acetylindoline- 2 -carboxylic acid (1 b) with the low moisture content (5 wt %) could be reduced by a factor 4 using microwave irradiation instead of conventional heating, while keeping the sample temperature under 35 °C. N-Acetyl-(S) -phenylalanine (2) with a higher moisture content (22 wt %) demonstrated a decrease in drying time by a factor 2. 5 to 4 depending on the applied microwave powers. A reduction in drying time of the precipitated (S) -N-acetylindoline- 2 -carboxylic acid (1 a, 17 wt % moisture) by a factor 2 was demonstrated for drying at 150 W of microwave irradiation instead of using a water bath at 70 °C. A dramatically shorter drying time by a factor 10 was found for cocarboxylase hydrochloride (3, 15 wt % water) on lab-scale which could be reproduced on pilot-plant scale. To achieve with conventional heating similar drying times as under microwave irradiation for the four examples, extremely high energy inputs should be applied, necessitating extremely high temperature differences between the heating source and the sample.

The optimum concentrations of manganese, cobalt, and zinc, in conjunction with one another, were 2. 5, 10. 0, and 5. 02 ̆ 0023 ̆bcM, respectively. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{cardiovascular}} effects of intravenous chlormethiazole (Heminevrin) was carried out on five volunteers. It showed that induction of light anaesthesia was easy, maintenance easy, and the recovery period short and uneventful. During induction, maintenance and recovery the only cardiovascular disturbance noted {{was an increase in}} heart rate; cardiac output was maintained at the pre-induction level. In view of the results obtained in this series and the clinical experience of its use in an assisted ventilation unit, it is suggested that chlormethiazole would be a suitable agent to provide sedation during many of the procedures required in an intensive care unit. Chlormethiazole (Heminevrin) is a powerful hypnotic and anticonvulsant derived from the "thiazole " portion of <b>thiamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (vit B,) (Charonnat, Lechat and Chareton, 1957). It is widely used in the treatment of delirium tremens and status epilepticus and its anaesthetic proper-ties were first investigated by Laborit and associ...|$|E
40|$|The {{growth of}} Pasteurella haemolytica strain H 44 L was studied under aerobic {{conditions}} {{in a medium}} of acid-hydrolyzed casein, supplementary cysteine, inorganic salts, vitamins, and a carbon source. The concentration of casein hydrolysate necessary for optimal growth was 1. 5 or 2. 0 %, depending upon the carbon source employed. Essential vitamins were calcium pantothenate, nicotinamide, and thiamine. Concentrations as low as 0. 01 μg/ml of thiamine monophosphate or thiamine pyrophosphate supported maximal growth, but <b>thiamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> or thiamine nitrate were active only at the unusually high levels of 10 to 20 μg/ml. The best carbon sources were d-galactose or sucrose. Maximal growth resulted from an inoculum containing fewer than 10 cells per milliliter of medium. Cellular yields averaged 6 × 109 to 7 × 109 cells per milliliter for the test organism and five other strains of P. haemolytica isolated from cases of bovine respiratory diseases...|$|E
40|$|A low cost, accurate, {{rapid and}} {{sensitive}} capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) quantitative method, using <b>thiamine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> as internal standard (IS), {{was developed for}} the simultaneous analysis of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine in mice plasma. Analytes were extracted from plasma samples by n-hexane/dichloromethane/isopropanol (2 : 1 : 0. 1, v/v/v) after alkalization, and stripped with 1. 5 % hydrochloric acid solution. Separation was performed by CZE using 50 mM borax- 20 mM threonine (pH 9. 27) as running buffer, with voltage of + 10 kV applied and UV detection wavelength at 210 nm. The total running time was within 10 min. Calibration curves for plasma samples were linear over the concentration range of 0. 075 - 5. 0 μg/mL for ephedrine and 0. 0375 - 2. 5 μg/mL for pseudoephedrine. The method had a limit of quantitation of 17. 80 ng/mL for ephedrine and 22. 00 ng/mL for pseudoephedrine,respectively. The method was reliable and feasible {{for the evaluation of}} pharmacokinetic profiles of drug products containing ephedrine and pseudoephedrine...|$|E
