40|$|In English Question+Answer (Q+A) pairs, {{periodicity}} typically emerges across <b>turn</b> <b>space,</b> to {{a degree}} of precision matching standards of music perception. Interactionally- aligned Q+A pairs display such shared periodicity across the turn, while unaligned pairs do not. Periodicity is measured as temporal location of f 0 maxima or minima, ‘pikes’, in successive accented syllables. This study asks whether periodicity of pikes across a turn is accompanied by systematic use of musical pitch intervals across the <b>turn</b> <b>space.</b> Recordings of 77 Q+A pairs from 8 pairs of native English speakers talking naturally. Ratios of f 0 in the last pike of the Question and {{the first of the}} Answer fell more reliably into Western musical interval categories when the Q+A pair’s turn transition was periodic (the Answer was aligned or preferred, re the Question) than when it was aperiodic (disaligned, dispreferred). Similar results were found for ratios of modal f 0. Such pitch ratios are better described by musical interval categories of Western tuning systems than by those of three non-Western systems, and best of all by semitones, suggesting close connections between culturally-specific uses of pitch in conversation and in music. Judgments of arousal/valence suggest weak relations with specific pitch intervals. Theoretical implications are discussed...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how to <b>turn</b> <b>space</b> into place. In the digital age, place {{is more important}} than ever before. Around the world communities are dealing with the issue of placelessness. The food system has become standardized and suburbia has become a monotonous repetition in cities across the country. As people search for a sense of place in their communities, creation of place can be a tool for exploring these issues. Through experience, individuals can begin to understand and become aware of the place they call home. This thesis discusses three methods for the comprehension of place. They are narrative writing, deep mapping, and photography. These methods provide a catalyst to investigate how a person’s personal experiences, the history of a place, and visual representations of a place can help create a sense of place that can carry into the future...|$|E

I will try to justify this claim by finding {{evidence}} in the usage of such discourse strategies as interruptions, overlaps and minimal responses. In {{order to have a}} clear-cut analysis of these linguistic devices, I will examine conversations not only in mixed-sex pairs or groups but also between the same sexes. Moreover, I will make a distinction between interruptions and overlaps and try to compare them with minimal responses which also occur during someone’s speaking turn. It will also turn out whether using minimal responses during others’ <b>turn</b> <b>space</b> or not intruding into the current speaker’s turn are viewed as clear signs of weakness or not. Additionally, we will see whether the timing of these strategies takes an important role in controlling a conversation. egyetemiangol nyelv és irodalo...|$|E
40|$|What {{does it mean}} {{to create}} a home, or <b>turn</b> <b>space</b> into a {{meaningful}} place? What can the built form teach us about the cultural construction of people’s lives? This monograph presents a detailed analysis of the practices, discourses and meanings of daily life as it unfolds in and around the domestic space of the Kasena of northern Ghana. Building on years of research, and with a great sense for ethnographic detail, the author explores the lifecycle of the Kasena house, the sensuousness of its material shape, its emplacement within natural, social and cultural geographies, the complex interactions between houses, and the specific ways in which the social biography of the house is interwoven with the lives and works of its inhabitants. Throughout this analysis of the culturally constructed ontology of Kasena lifeworlds, the author privileges a female perspective. In particular she focuses on women’s paths and movements in and between houses, carefully drawing out the analogies that exist between the social body {{of the house and the}} female body in each phase of their existence (from birth and marriage to death). The book conveys how the house, as a living body, constantly enables the regeneration and replenishing of ongoing cycles and flows of gifts, goods and people, and thereby forms a prerequisite for the never-ending renewal or stirring of life itself. edition: 1 stnrpages: 336 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Seit dem so {{genannten}} spatial turn ist Raum eine zentrale Kategorie auch der Literatur- und Kulturwissenschaften. Diesem ‚Paradigmenwechsel‘ entspricht der vorliegende Band, in dem neue Fragestellungen an das an Raumschilderungen so reiche Werk Droste-Hülshoffs herangetragen werden. Neben einer thematischen Einführung und einem theoretischen Überblick zu Raumkonzeptionen sind zwölf Beiträge versammelt, die sich u. a. mit Fragen nach einer Poetologie des Raums, nach den Raumkonzepten sowie deren Funktionen im Text beschäftigen. Die Relevanz dieser Fragestellungen für die Droste-Forschung wird überzeugend nachgewiesen. Zugleich kommt aber die theoretische Reflexion etwas zu kurz. Wichtigste und zum Teil einzige Referenz ist Michel Foucaults „Heterotopie“-Begriff – trotz oder wegen mancher Inkonsistenzen dieses Konzepts. Since {{the so-called}} spatial <b>turn,</b> <b>space</b> {{has become a}} central category also for literary and cultural studies. This ‘paradigm shift’ corresponds to the volume at hand, which asks new questions {{of the work of}} Droste-Hülshoff, itself rich in spatial descriptions. The volume contains a thematic introduction and a theoretical overview of spatial conceptions as well as twelve contributions approaching such questions as the poetology of space, spatial conceptions, and their functions in text. The volume convincingly proves the relevance of these questions for Droste research. At the same time, however, it does not adequately discuss theoretical reflections. The most important and often sole reference is Michel Foucault’s term “heterotopology,” despite, or perhaps because of, this concept’s inconsistencies...|$|E

40|$|Cosmic {{topology}} {{is difficult}} to constrain {{due to the lack}} of observable phenomena which are affected by this property of the Universe. The phenomenon with the most potential to reveal cosmic topology is the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The task of constraining topology with the CMB is challenging, and so the more data that is utilised the better. This thesis sets out a method that uses the full information available from the CMB, including polarisation, in the form of a Bayesian analysis of the full correlation matrix of the CMB. A catalogue of flat spaces is presented, of which four are analysed here; the remainder could be analysed with minimal modifications to the code developed in this work. With a little more modification, the code could also be utilised to investigate spherical and hyperbolic spaces. The four topologies analysed here are the flat torus, half <b>turn</b> <b>space,</b> Klein space and Klein space with vertical flip. More work needs to be done on the Bayesian analysis in order to achieve constraints on these four spaces; efforts in this work were concentrated on efficiently generating full correlation matrices. The code developed for this task is capable of generating at least 231 individual correlation matrices for a given topology (the parameters varied being the size and cosmology of the Universe, as well as the type of correlation, e. g. TT), for a CMB resolution of l = 30 and a spatial resolution of k = 100 /L (where k are Fourier modes and L is the size of the Universe), on an entry level server in less than one day.

40|$|The {{following}} research project {{is grounded in}} the interrelated contexts of the Russian intelligentsia’s ambivalent engagement with post-revolutionary culture and cinema’s rise as an artistic medium and instrument of Russian cultural development. By examining Viktor Shklovsky’s earliest activities in the Soviet film industry, this project will explore how narrative, aesthetic, and ideological programmes were repeatedly and variously moulded, undermined, and complicated by the twentieth-century Russian avant-garde interest in dissolving creative boundaries between the domains of the ‘internal’ (embracing private, individual, and domestic concerns) and ‘external’ (their public, communal, and social counterparts) in a bid ‘to <b>turn</b> <b>space</b> outwards’ (vyvorachivat´ prostranstvo vovne). These critical enquiries will lend themselves to an investigation of how the behaviours of Shklovsky, his colleagues, and his artistic creations were affected by internal and/or external loci of control and how these activities were reconciled (if at all) in a society where the relationship between freedom and necessity was {{in a constant state of}} fluctuation. This research aims not simply to establish the extent and significance of Shklovsky’s influence on cinema as an individual, but rather to utilise his personal narrative for an assessment of the levels of interaction between theory and practice and between the verbal and the visual as integral to the intelligentsia movement. The project will investigate the part that Shklovsky played in conceptualising the boundaries, exchanges, and conflicts that arose between different artistic media and the critical institutions that developed around them, before considering how these relations changed as Soviet culture entered and emerged from the period of Cultural Revolution. In addition, an exploration of the effects of personal and professional tensions between different ideological groups will not only develop a better understanding of Shklovsky’s role in the cinema as theorist, critic, polemicist, screenwriter, and ‘creative administrator’, but will also help to establish the similarities and/or disparities between his film-works and contemporary cultural experience...|$|E
40|$|Co-curated with Lisa Otty, this {{exhibition}} showcases artists’ books and multiples {{to explore and}} expand the twin concepts of performance and performativity. Considering how books stage images, enact ideas and direct experiences to subversive effect, {{this exhibition}} presents thoughts and actions grounded in ritual, gesture, mime, documentation and scores through works exhibited. Artists and writers have engaged with the performative possibilities of the book for over a century, the French 19 th century poet Mallarmé imagined his Le Livre emerging {{as a series of}} ritualised séances, whilst the modernist artist Marcel Duchamp’s Green Box staged the book in order to subvert its traditions. Drawing upon a broad range of contemporary works, a book is a performance follows Mallarmé’s desires and Duchamp’s lead and situates the book and the act of reading as a performative practice inscribed with gesture and action. At the heart of the fascination with the book is its potential as a transformative space, in which identities and places can be unsettled. In Polaroid Portraits Richard Hamilton enters this mutable space and shows the ambivalence of portraiture. In the work of Viola Yeşiltaç photographs are used to directly mark, reorder and <b>turn</b> <b>space</b> into a fiction of her own. Yeşiltaç’s editorial control over space is echoed in the work of Sharon Kivland who organises postcards and historical images into unlikely and random categories, forming equivalences between disparate fictions, realties and histories. But it is not only space and identity that are subject to radical re-invention in the book, in Simon Morris’ Rewriting Freud words and thoughts are recombined to generate different perspectives on the hidden depths of Freud’s practice of psychoanalysis. Alec Finley adopts a similar approach in his work Mesostic Interleaved, which consists of a series of poems distributed randomly throughout a library collection: these ‘bookmarks’ reconfigure the readers engagement with the collection, sending them in unexpected directions. Yet the book is inherently a material object and it is this persistent physical quality that provides the ‘binding’ of Helen Douglas’ Threads, in this work the book becomes a stage upon which a thread of thought literally wanders into, across and through its pages. The wandering and wondering capacity of thought and words is further traced out in the unfolding of the book into a live and public space in Cullinan Richards Savage School Window Gallery, whilst in the work of Nina Chua the book becomes a map of words that opens into the unknown. The works in a book is a performance cumulatively reveal the book as the anchor point for riveting and radical forms of experience, in which a turned page can lead into an encounter with performative acts, gestures and beautiful subversions. </p...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} about the facades and the streets impact on the {{experience}} of the city and how architects can create cities for the human kind with simple tools that makes a hugh difference for the experience of urban space. As the cities are growing in a faster rate and as more people move to the cities, they will also affect more people. The different structures that {{can be found in the}} cities therefore gets more important and giving design to city structures also gets more complex because of our higher demands on urban functions and content. It’s difficult to evaluate the ultimate city structure since all people experience their city in different ways, but architects still should be able to create urban spaces that is suited for the human kind, just as we can create different biotopes for flora and fauna. Therefore there must be general ideas of what the human being experience as good or bad and these should be guidelines when designing urban space. Since urban space is something that most people experience every day it doesn´t always have a clear impact on them. Although there are places that are designed in a certain way that makes people to want to stay in that space. It is the architects ability to <b>turn</b> <b>space</b> into place that makes the difference between the urban structures and that ability also decides whether it is suited for the human being or not. The city has changed from being a place for meeting and socializing to mainly function as a space for trade and consumption. The cities role as a place where people meet is still very important for the wellbeing of the inhabitants. The facade and the street are the most fundamental elements in the urban context and they influence the peoples experience of their surroundings. It is these two variables that can be used to turn urban space into actual place and to keep up the cities role as a place for peoples interaction with eachother. A walk through the city reflects the way that most people see and experience urban space. This study shows that the most fundamental in urban design is the relation between the facade and the street and their positioning to eachother. It is vital with a change in surroundings during a city walk for making the urban space interesting and pleasant for the stroller. The urban space ought to be divided into shorter sequences for maintaining the strollers attention and interest. The components of the facade tells us about the buildings character as a private or public construction, but it is difficult to substantialize an effect in experience according to design of facades. It is of high importance that city planners and designers are aware of these small details. The placing of entrances, differences in levels, shaping of corners etcetera, makes a big difference for the experience and movement through the city.
