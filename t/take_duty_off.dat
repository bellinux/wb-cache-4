On the 15th she arrived off Inchon with Task Force 90 (TF 90); provided support while the 1st and 5th Marines went ashore; then remained in the area until after Allied forces had pushed back across the 38th Parallel. On 3 October she left Inchon to <b>take</b> up <b>duties</b> <b>off</b> the Korean east coast.|$|R

Boats from the steamer and [...] entered Mosquito Inlet on a {{reconnaissance}} on 21 March and next day were fired upon by batteries and musketry, killing the captains of both Henry Andrew and Penguin. Subsequently, {{the ship was}} active in the blockade off Mosquito Inlet, Stono River, and other points on the coast until sent to Winyah Bay, South Carolina, where she arrived on 21 June.|$|R
5000|$|On 6 February, she got {{underway}} for the Pacific Theater. Arriving off Guadalcanal on 30 May, she <b>took</b> up patrol <b>duties</b> <b>off</b> the Solomons, and, on {{the night}} of 17/18 July, joined [...] and [...] in attacking three Japanese destroyers off Vanga Point, Kolombangara. Scoring several torpedo hits, she also shot down one Japanese plane.|$|R
50|$|Newport {{then was}} {{converted}} for {{service as a}} weather ship, and so served on ocean weather stations in the Northwest Pacific Ocean until November 1951, when she <b>took</b> up varied <b>duties</b> <b>off</b> Korea, including screening underway replenishment groups, patrolling, and on 29 December 1951 conducting a shore bombardment at Wonsan. She next operated in the Philippine Islands until decommissioning at Yokosuka on 30 April 1952 and returning to a reserve status.|$|R
50|$|On 4 January, she <b>took</b> up patrol <b>duty</b> <b>off</b> Japanese-held Jolo Island. The next day, she {{developed}} leaks {{in the air}} supply piping to the starboard main motor panel. Makeshift repairs decreased the air leaks, and S-37 remained in the Sulu district on 6 January. On 7 January, she continued south, toward Port Darwin. On 8 January, new orders arrived, and she set a course for Soerabaja, the Dutch naval base on the northeast coast of Java.|$|R
50|$|Arriving at Dutch Harbor on 11 May, S-41 {{departed}} {{four days}} later and <b>took</b> up patrol <b>duties</b> <b>off</b> Paramushiro in the Kuril Islands, on 21 May. On 27 May, she scored a probable kill on a four-masted fishing schooner; and, in the pre-dawn darkness of 31 May, she torpedoed a cargo ship in a night surface attack. From the violent internal explosion and fires which followed the initial torpedoing, the victim was presumed to have been carrying high explosives or light, volatile liquids.|$|R

I will give her full instructions to act for me, and even an authorization in writing, if you prefer it. She is already in the habit of coming here; but her visits will give you very little trouble. And, as she is a slave, or, as you call it, I believe, a chattel, she will be already quite accustomed to the treatment which her class are in the habit of receiving from Northern hands." ...|$|R

25|$|The SO19 {{firearms}} officers {{involved in}} the shooting were debriefed and drugs and alcohol tests were taken as a standard procedure. The officers were <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>duty</b> pending {{an investigation into the}} shooting. One security agency source said later that members of SO19 received training from the SAS. He said the operation was not typical of the police, and bore the hallmarks of a special forces operation.|$|R

'Two {{pounds of}} best black tea, good quality--yours is {{generally}} atrocious, Mrs. Oswald--that's {{the next thing}} on the list,' said poor trembling, shaky Miss Luttrell, the Squire's sister, a palsied old lady with a quavering, querulous, rasping voice. 'Two pounds of best black tea, and mind you don't send it all dust, as you usually do. No good tea to be got nowadays, since they <b>took</b> the <b>duties</b> <b>off</b> and ruined the country. And I see a tall young man lounging about the place sometimes, and never touching his hat to me as he ought to do. Young people have no manners in these times, Mrs. Oswald, {{as they used to}} have when you and I were young. Your son, I suppose, come home from sea or something? He's in the fish-curing line, isn't he, I think I've heard you say?' ...|$|R

50|$|On 2 April 1894, Alert was recommissioned, Cdr. W. A. Morgan in command. Assigned to the Pacific Squadron once again, she {{returned}} to the Bering Sea late in May for a summer of duty suppressing seal poachers. The warship finished that assignment in mid-September and arrived back at San Francisco on the 27th. The following day, she moved to the Mare Island Navy Yard and remained there {{through the end of the}} year. On 24 January 1895, Alert, departed Mare Island to <b>take</b> up <b>duty</b> <b>off</b> the Pacific coasts of Central and South America. Proceeding via San Diego and Acapulco, she reached Puerto San José on 15 February. The vessel cruised along the Latin American littoral between Guatemala and Peru for over 16 months keeping watch over U.S. interests in the region. On 2 June 1896, she departed La Libertad, Salvador (now El Salvador), to return home. After stops at several Mexican ports and at San Diego, she reached San Francisco on 17 July.|$|R
2500|$|In June 1942 {{she joined}} Western Local Escort Force (WLEF) and in June 1943, {{assigned}} to escort group W-8.

On 7 May 1945, Dunvegan was detached from convoy SC 175 to help [...] escort the captured [...] back to port.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to dawn on 22 December, she <b>took</b> up patrol <b>duties</b> <b>off</b> San Fernando in the {{northern}} approaches to the gulf, and moved south. At 0411, she sighted an enemy destroyer and, at 04:24, she fired. Although the [...] "fish" [...] headed [...] "right at" [...] the destroyer, there was no explosion. At 04:26, a second destroyer appeared; and, the hunter became the hunted. Saury commenced evasive tactics in the relatively shallow waters of the gulf. Depth charges were dropped, but none within 1000 yd of the submarine. Saury continued on evasive courses, working {{her way to the}} northwest and out of the destroyer-patrolled area. By noon, she was clear. After dark, she moved back into the gulf, past the enemy patrol line between San Fernando and Cape Bolinao.|$|R
5|$|USS Wadsworth was {{commissioned}} into the United States Navy at the Boston Navy Yard on 23 July 1915 {{under the command}} of Lieutenant Commander Joseph K. Taussig. After trials and torpedo firing drills out of Newport, Rhode Island, the destroyer <b>took</b> up <b>duty</b> <b>off</b> the New England coast line in October. Her duty included patrols to insure America's neutrality vis-a-vis the year-old European war. On 7January 1916, she departed Provincetown, Massachusetts, to join in the annual Fleet maneuvers in the Caribbean. After a stop at Norfolk, Virginia, she reached the West Indies at Culebra Island on 15January and began a three-month round of war games, drills, and exercises. During her stay in the Caribbean, she visited Guantanamo Bay, Guacanayabo Bay, Manzanillo, and Santiago — all in Cuba. On 10April, she left Guantanamo Bay to steam north, stopped at New York for a five-week stay, and returned to Newport on 21May. Wadsworth resumed operations along the New England coast, and the succeeding year passed {{in much the same way}} as had its predecessor — summer operations along the northeastern coast followed by Fleet maneuvers in the Caribbean.|$|R
50|$|Vandalia soon {{returned}} to duty with the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron and was deployed off Tybee Roads, Georgia, in December. She remained at Tybee until April 1862, {{at which time}} she was ordered to proceed to the blockade at Wassaw Sound, Georgia. The sloop {{returned to}} Port Royal, South Carolina, in late June and <b>took</b> up blockade <b>duty</b> <b>off</b> Charleston in July. She served at Port Royal as a guardship in September and was repaired and resupplied there in November. Later that month and in December, she cruised along the outside line of the blockade off Charleston and Port Royal Bay, performing reconnaissance duties as well as giving practical sailing experience to recent Naval Academy graduates. On 29 December, the vessel was ordered north for major structural repairs at New York, having sprung a leak under her magazine.|$|R
5000|$|Jaffa Parrish (Alan Talbot, 1989-2000) - Jaffa was {{a member}} of Red Watch at Blackwall, and the uncle of Colin Parrish. Jaffa had to leave the brigade in Series 7 after being injured on a 'shout' to a propane {{cylinder}} storage yard. He was with Blue Watch, standing in for George, and was in the pump when it was hit by a gas cylinder, badly burning him. Though he recovered, he was eventually <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>duty</b> due to the trauma he had suffered. George felt guilty over the accident, but Jaffa dismissed his worries. He later took over as landlord of the Watch's favourite pub.|$|R
60|$|Our {{regiment}} {{had been}} <b>taken</b> <b>off</b> <b>duty</b> whenever {{it was clear}} that Feversham did not mean to advance, and they were now busy upon the victuals which our night-foray had furnished. It was a Sunday, fresh and warm, with a clear, unclouded sky, and a gentle breeze, sweet with the smack of the country. All day the bells of the neighbouring villages rang out their alarm, pealing their music over the sunlit countryside. The upper windows and red-tiled roofs of the houses were crowded with pale-faced women and children, who peered out to eastward, where the splotches of crimson upon the dun-coloured moor marked the position of our enemies.|$|R
5000|$|The ship then <b>took</b> up {{blockade}} <b>duty</b> <b>off</b> Mobile, Alabama. On {{the afternoon}} of the 11th, her masthead lookout reported [...] "black smoke bearing about south", and San Jacinto set out in pursuit of the steamer. During the chase, the lookout spotted the blockade runner Fox, aground and burning. About dusk, San Jacinto changed course for Mobile, hoping to intercept the fleeing vessel if she attempted to dash into that port. This strategy proved sound for, early the next morning, the Union steam frigate found that her quarry was again within sight; and the chase began again. Near the Chandeleur Islands, San Jacinto anchored in shoal water and sent her first cutter after the steamer. That evening shortly before twilight, the blockade runner—which happened to bear the name of the frigates old adversary, Alabama—ran ashore and was abandoned. Before San Jacintos cutter could reach the prize, the Union blockader Eugenie arrived upon the scene and took possession of the blockade runner.|$|R
6000|$|As to one disservice, however, {{there can}} be no doubt. The French Revolution has {{furnished}} the enemies of each successive proposal of reform with a boundless supply of prejudicial analogies, appalling parallels, and ugly nicknames, which are all just as conclusive with the unwise {{as if they were the}} aptest arguments. Sydney Smith might well put [...] "the awful example of a neighbouring nation" [...] among the standing topics of the Noodle's Oration. The abolition of rotten boroughs brought down a thousand ominous references to noyades, fusillades, and guillotines. When Sir Robert Peel <b>took</b> the <b>duty</b> <b>off</b> corn, Croker warned him with great solemnity that he was breaking up the old interests, dividing the great families, and beginning exactly such a castastrophe as did the Noailles and the Montmorencis in 1789. Cobden and Bright were promiscuously likened to Baboeuf, Chaumette, and Anacharsis Clootz. Baboeuf, it is true, was for dividing up all property, and Chaumette was an aggressive atheist; but these were mere nuances, not material to the purposes of obloquy. Robespierre, Danton, Marat have been mercilessly trotted forth in their sanguinary shrouds, and treated as the counterparts and precursors of worthies so obviously and exactly like them as Mr. Beales and Mr. Odger; while an innocent caucus for the registration of voters recalls to some well-known writers lurid visions of the Cordeliers and the Jacobin Club.|$|R
50|$|The crew soon {{discovers that}} a Malon ship has {{discovered}} the lost probe, and {{they too are}} constructing a specialized craft to recover it for themselves. Efforts to build the Delta Flyer are boosted as it now becomes a race to recover the probe. As it nears completion, a structural flaw is discovered. Torres offers to test it via the holodeck, but purposely turns off the safety controls. The simulation shakes the virtual Delta Flyer and Torres is injured and knocked out from the test. While she is recovering, The Doctor diagnoses Torres with clinical depression. Captain Janeway discovers that Torres has been using the holodeck without safety protocols several times of late, and <b>takes</b> her <b>off</b> <b>duty.</b>|$|R
5000|$|At about 7 pm on January 3, 1989, a Loveland {{police officer}} and Larimer County sheriff’s deputy responded to a {{domestic}} dispute on Glade Road off highway U.S. 34, about 6 mi west of the Riverhouse Restaurant in Larimer County. [...] The object of the complaint, two-tour Vietnam veteran of the 101st Airborne Division and paroled drug dealer Wayne Strozzi, age 35, armed with a 9 mm pistol confronted the police officers, wounded one, and then fled east down highway 34 with police in pursuit. Strozzi pulled his partly disabled pickup into the restaurant parking lot, entered the restaurant and initially <b>took</b> an <b>off</b> <b>duty</b> Loveland police officer’s wife, Belva Bethel, hostage at gunpoint at the checkout counter demanding the husband, Steve Bethel, retrieve his automobile for escape.|$|R
