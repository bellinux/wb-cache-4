5000|$|Comments by supporters: The {{proposed}} {{amendment would}} remedy inconsistency in the taxation of personal motor vehicles {{also used for}} the production of income and allows the will of the legislature in enacting House Bill No. 809 in 2005 to have its desired effect. Because the motor vehicles affected by the proposed amendment were exempted from rendition for <b>taxation</b> <b>by</b> House Bill No. 809, most of those vehicles go untaxed. Current law allows an appraiser to harass a property owner by taxing motor vehicles that are exempt from rendition. It is clear that the legislature exempted these vehicles from rendition with the intent to exempt them from <b>taxation.</b> <b>By</b> limiting this exemption to one motor vehicle per individual owner, the proposed amendment allays concerns that a fleet of motor vehicles could be exempted from <b>taxation</b> <b>by</b> a person who uses each vehicle for personal use for a short time each year.|$|R
