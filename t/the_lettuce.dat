5|$|After Potter's {{death in}} December 1943, Frederick Warne & Co. granted {{licenses}} to various firms {{for the production}} of merchandise based on the Potter characters. Beswick Pottery of Longton, Staffordshire released six porcelain figurines beginning in 1965 depicting characters or scenes from the tale: Flopsy, Mrs. Tittlemouse, Benjamin Bunny, Peter Rabbit Digging, a Flopsy and Benjamin Bunny tableau, and a tableau depicting the sleeping bunnies under <b>the</b> <b>lettuce.</b> and, in 1984, Schmid & Co. of Toronto and Randolph, Massachusetts released a Flopsy Bunnies music box, a flat ceramic Flopsy Christmas ornament, and in 1985 a Flopsy music box. Stuffed toy manufacturers had sought licensing rights as early as 1906 for Potter's characters, {{but it was not until}} the 1970s that an English firm was granted worldwide rights. Their labour-intensive products were unprofitable however, and in 1972, The Eden Toy Company of New York became the exclusive manufacturer of Potter characters. Although Peter Rabbit and Mr. McGregor were released as plush toys, they were associated with the Peter Rabbit tale and not with that of The Flopsy Bunnies. None of The Flopsy Bunnies characters were released as Eden plush toys.|$|E

40|$|Dietary {{potassium}} restriction {{is recommended}} for chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with hyperkalemia. Boiling or soaking vegetables in water is known to decrease their potassium content. However, these methods can also reduce the quantity of other nutrients. Recently, low-potassium (LK) lettuce has been developed for CKD patients with hyperkalemia. This study compared the potassium content, other nutritional values, and taste characteristics of LK lettuce with those of normal <b>lettuce.</b> <b>The</b> amounts of potassium and other nutrients in LK lettuce, normal leaf lettuce, and normal leaf lettuce that had been soaked in water were measured and compared. The taste characteristics of LK lettuce and normal leaf lettuce were evaluated for saltiness, bitterness, and overall preference. <b>The</b> LK <b>lettuce</b> contained a lower amount of potassium (− 87 %) than <b>the</b> normal leaf <b>lettuce.</b> There {{was no difference in}} the other nutritional contents between LK lettuce and normal leaf lettuce, except for higher sodium and lower nitrate contents in LK lettuce. Taste evaluation revealed that <b>the</b> LK <b>lettuce</b> had lower bitterness and higher saltiness than <b>the</b> normal leaf <b>lettuce.</b> <b>The</b> overall preference score was significantly higher for LK <b>lettuce.</b> <b>The</b> potassium content of LK lettuce was significantly lower than that of normal leaf <b>lettuce,</b> but <b>the</b> other nutritional values were very similar. <b>The</b> LK <b>lettuce</b> had a higher preference score than <b>the</b> normal leaf <b>lettuce.</b> These results indicate that <b>the</b> LK <b>lettuce</b> is useful for increasing the variety of foods in CKD patients with hyperkalemia. 背景：對於血鉀過高的慢性腎病 (CKD) 患者，建議限制飲食中的鉀。用水浸泡或煮食則會降低蔬菜中的鉀含量，然而亦會同時降低其他營養素含量。最近，有專家特別為血鉀過高的 CKD 患者研發出低鉀萵苣。本研究對低鉀萵苣的鉀含量、營養與味道特徵作出調查，並與正常的萵苣作出比較。 方法：研究人員分別對低鉀萵苣、正常葉萵苣、與泡水後的正常葉萵苣，測量了鉀及其他營養素含量。對於低鉀萵苣及正常葉萵苣的味道特徵，則根據鹹度、苦澀度、及整體偏好作出評估。 結果：低鉀萵苣的鉀含量比正常葉萵苣低 87 %，其他營養素方面，與正常葉萵苣相比，低鉀萵苣具較高的鈉及較低的硝酸鹽含量。味道評估顯示，相比於正常葉萵苣，低鉀萵苣的苦澀度較低，鹹度則較高。整體偏好上，低鉀萵苣的得分高於正常葉萵苣。 結論：與正常葉萵苣相比，低鉀萵苣的鉀含量較低，但其他營養素含量相似。同時，低鉀萵苣的整體味道偏好比正常葉萵苣較佳。本研究的結果顯示，對於血鉀過高的慢性腎病患者，低鉀萵苣是適合的食物選擇之一...|$|R
5|$|Western Europe and North America {{were the}} {{original}} major markets for large-scale lettuce production. By the late 1900s, Asia, South America, Australia and Africa became more substantial markets. Different locations tended to prefer {{different types of}} lettuce, with butterhead prevailing in northern Europe and Great Britain, romaine in the Mediterranean and stem lettuce in China and Egypt. By the late 20th century, the preferred types began to change, with crisphead, especially iceberg, lettuce becoming the dominant type in northern Europe and Great Britain and more popular in western Europe. In the US, no one type predominated until the early 20th century, when crisphead lettuces began gaining popularity. After the 1940s, {{with the development of}} iceberg lettuce, 95 percent of <b>the</b> <b>lettuce</b> grown and consumed in the US was crisphead lettuce.

40|$|In general, plants grown under {{diffuse light}} yield higher biomass than those grown under direct {{light as a}} result of a more uniform {{distribution}} of the light across the plant canopy. We compared the effects of a light-diffusing plastic film and a clear plastic film on growth of Batavia lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) in two greenhouses during five growth periods. <b>Lettuce</b> grown under <b>the</b> light-diffusing film were smaller (up to 36 %) than control plants grown under the clear film, due to the fewer leaves per plant (up to 22 %) and lower mean values of individual leaf area (up to 29 %). The photosynthetically active radiations use efficiency was sometimes lower (up to 23 %) in <b>lettuces</b> grown under <b>the</b> light-diffusing film. The pigment contents tended to be lower in plants grown under the light-diffusing plastic. The total macroelement contents of <b>the</b> <b>lettuces</b> grown under <b>the</b> light-diffusing plastic were up to 10 % higher than in <b>the</b> <b>lettuces</b> grown under clear plastic, mainly {{as a result of}} higher leaf K contents (up to 19 % higher). In addition, use of the light-diffusing plastic tended to increase leaf nitrate contents (by up to 23 %). The leaf solid soluble content and acidity values were higher in <b>the</b> <b>lettuces</b> grown under <b>the</b> light-diffusing plastic, while leaf pH values were lower than in the control plants. The findings showed that the light-diffusing plastic was detrimental to production of compact heads of lettuce, and to some quality parameters such as nitrate and pigment contents.

40|$|In {{the present}} study we {{investigated}} the performance of dark-stored wounded leaf discs and pieces (to some extent mimicking fresh-cut product) of Lactuca sativa L. {{in relation to the}} physiological maturity at harvest. We used two related genotypes, i. e. a green (cv. Troubadour) and a red butterhead (cv. Teodore) differing in their pigment levels. For both genotypes, senescence of the wounded (fresh-cut) tissue prepared from leaves of younger plants was significantly delayed compared to wounded tissue prepared from the more mature plants. Shelf-life (time to unacceptable quality) of fresh-cut was doubled when plants were harvested one week before the commercial harvesting date. To explain differences in shelf-life between fresh-cut products prepared from plants harvested at different age, a number of physiological and nutritional parameters were determined at harvest. <b>The</b> red <b>lettuce</b> contained about two times more chlorophyll, carotenoids, and polyphenolic antioxidants than <b>the</b> green <b>lettuce,</b> but <b>the</b> shelf-life of both genotypes was about similar. Increasing the amount of pigments and polyphenols through application of LED light (with high percentage blue) during cultivation did not affect the shelf life of the wounded leaf tissue. The content of chlorophyll, carotenoids, phenolic compounds, as well as total antioxidant capacity was not affected by age of the plants for either genotype. The content of ascorbic acid decreased with maturation in <b>the</b> green <b>lettuce</b> but it was not affected by maturity in <b>the</b> red <b>lettuce.</b> This shows that there are no obvious signs of leaf senescence with age and the differences in pigments and antioxidants show no relation to the fresh-cut shelf life and thus cannot explain the effect of plant age on senescence of the wounded tissue. The net photosynthesis rate and carbohydrate reserves in <b>the</b> red <b>lettuce</b> were about half of that in <b>the</b> green <b>lettuce</b> but <b>the</b> shelf-life of both genotypes was similar. The net photosynthesis rate was not influenced by plant maturity in <b>the</b> green <b>lettuce,</b> whereas it decreased with maturation in <b>the</b> red <b>lettuce.</b> A decrease in sucrose and starch, and therefore the total content of carbohydrates with aging was observed in both genotypes. This effect was more pronounced in the red than in <b>the</b> green <b>lettuce.</b> There was no apparent relationship between the absolute levels of the total carbohydrates and the shelf-life of the fresh-cut product showing that carbohydrate reserves in itself cannot explain the effect of plant age on senescence of the wounded tissue. The leaves from older plants apparently have a reduced capability to cope with the stress from wounding. No simple one to one relationship emerged between any of the measured nutritional parameters, their change during maturation and the eventual shelf-life of the fresh-cut produce...|$|R
