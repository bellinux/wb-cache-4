The rare earths are extracted from a feed solution containing anions that form weakly extracting complexes such as chloride or sulfate salts to an <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> through complex formation with anions present exclusively In the <b>organic</b> <b>phase,</b> The <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> comprises a water-immiscible ionic liquid with nitrate or thiocyanate anions. In addition to the ionic liquid, the <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> can also contain a neutral extractant. The rare earths can easily be stripped as chloride or sulfate salts from the loaded <b>organic</b> <b>phase.</b> status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|In {{a typical}} scenario, an {{industrial}} process will use an extraction step in which solutes are {{transferred from the}} aqueous <b>phase</b> to the <b>organic</b> phase; this is often followed by a scrubbing stage in which unwanted solutes are removed from the <b>organic</b> <b>phase,</b> then a stripping stage in which the wanted solutes are removed from the <b>organic</b> <b>phase.</b> The <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> may then be treated to make it ready for use again.|$|R
40|$|The {{extraction}} equilibrium of indium(III) from a {{nitric acid}} solution using di(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (D 2 EHPA) as an acidic extractant of organophosphorus compounds dissolved in kerosene was studied. By graphical and numerical analysis, the compositions of indium-D 2 EHPA complexes in <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> and stoichiometry of the extraction reaction were examined. Nitric acid solutions with various indium concentrations at 25 °C {{were used to}} obtain the equilibrium constant of InR 3 in the <b>organic</b> <b>phase.</b> The experimental {{results showed that the}} extraction distribution ratios of indium(III) between the <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> and the aqueous solution increased when either the pH value of the aqueous solution and/or the concentration of the <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> extractant increased. Finally, the recovery efficiency of indium(III) in nitric acid was measured...|$|R
40|$|Partitioning of {{ethylene}} oxide oligomers and polymers (PEO) in biphasic systems {{of water and}} chloroform or dichloromethane favors transfer to the <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> as the molecular weight increases. For systems containing chlorobenzene, partitioning into the aqueous phase is always predominant. Calorimetric determination of the enthalpies of transfer for PEO from aqueous to <b>organic</b> <b>phases</b> reveals an endothermic process {{for all of the}} systems investigated, which was ascribed to the replacement of a more energetically favored PEO solvation in water for that in the <b>organic</b> <b>phase.</b> These results indicate that spontaneous PEO transfer from water to an <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> is driven by an entropy increase. The number of water molecules transferred to the <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> with PEO was determined to be ca. 0. 08 water molecules per EO unit, smaller than hydration numbers reported in aqueous solutions. All of these findings lead to a picture where PEO may be extracted from water to an <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> as long as the solvation by the organic solvent is relatively strong as compared to water. The displacement of water causes an entropy increase, which drives the transfer process. Chloroform and dichloromethane are suitable solvents for PEO extraction probably because of their hydrogen bond-donating capability...|$|R
50|$|Phase-boundary {{catalytic}} (PBC) {{systems can}} be contrasted with conventional catalytic systems. PBC is primarily applicable to reactions at the interface of an aqueous <b>phase</b> and <b>organic</b> <b>phase.</b> In these cases, an approach such as PBC is needed due to the immiscibility of aqueous <b>phases</b> with most <b>organic</b> substrate. In PBC, the catalyst acts at the interface between the aqueous and <b>organic</b> <b>phases.</b> The reaction medium of phase boundary catalysis systems for the catalytic reaction of immiscible aqueous and <b>organic</b> <b>phases</b> consists of three phases; an <b>organic</b> liquid <b>phase,</b> containing most of the substrate, an aqueous liquid phase containing most of the substrate in aqueous phase and the solid catalyst.|$|R
50|$|After use, the <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> may be {{subjected}} to a cleaning step to remove any degradation products; for instance, in PUREX plants, the used <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> is washed with sodium carbonate solution to remove any dibutyl hydrogen phosphate or butyl dihydrogen phosphate that might be present.|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of an inert immiscible <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> in gasâ��liquid dispersions in stirred vessels influences the interfacial area in a more complex fashion than hitherto reported. As the <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> fraction is increased, the interfacial area expressed {{on the basis of}} a unit volume of dispersion or aqueous phase, first increases, passes through a maximum and then decreases. This trend is observed irrespective of whether the area is determined by chemical means or by physical method. It is found that for low values of inert phase fraction, the average bubble size decreases whereas the gas holdup increases, resulting in increased interfacial area. The lower average bubble size is found to be due to partial prevention of coalescence as the bubbles size generated in the impeller region actually increases with the <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> fraction. The actual values of interfacial areas depend on the nature of the <b>organic</b> <b>phase.</b> It is also found that the <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> provides a parallel path for mass transfer to occur, when the solubility of gas in it is high...|$|R
50|$|When the {{nitric acid}} {{concentration}} is high the extraction into the <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> is favoured, {{and when the}} nitric acid concentration is low the extraction is reversed (the <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> is stripped of the metal). It is normal to dissolve the used fuel in nitric acid, after {{the removal of the}} insoluble matter the uranium and plutonium are extracted from the highly active liquor. It is normal to then back extract the loaded <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> to create a medium active liquor which contains mostly uranium and plutonium with only small traces of fission products. This medium active aqueous mixture is then extracted again by tributyl phosphate/hydrocarbon to form a new <b>organic</b> <b>phase,</b> the metal bearing <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> is then stripped of the metals to form an aqueous mixture of only uranium and plutonium. The two stages of extraction are used to improve the purity of the actinide product, the <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> used for the first extraction will suffer a far greater dose of radiation. The radiation can degrade the tributyl phosphate into dibutyl hydrogen phosphate. The dibutyl hydrogen phosphate can act as an extraction agent for both the actinides and other metals such as ruthenium. The dibutyl hydrogen phosphate can make the system behave in a more complex manner as it tends to extract metals by an ion exchange mechanism (extraction favoured by low acid concentration), to reduce the effect of the dibutyl hydrogen phosphate it is common for the used <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> to be washed with sodium carbonate solution to remove the acidic degradation products of the tributyl phosphate.|$|R
40|$|A {{new process}} called phase {{enhanced}} gas-liquid absorption {{has been developed}} in its early stage. It was found that adding another phase into the absorption system of gas/aqueous phase could enhance the absorption rate. A system with three phases was studied. In the system, gas phase was carbon dioxide. Two liquid phases were used. One was <b>organic</b> <b>phase.</b> Another was aqueous phase. By addition of <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> into the absorption system of CO{sub 2 }-aqueous phase, the absorption rate of CO{sub 2 } was increased significantly. CO{sub 2 } finally accumulated into aqueous phase. The experimental results proved that (1) Absorption rate of carbon dioxide was enhanced by adding <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> into gas aqueous <b>phase</b> system; (2) <b>Organic</b> <b>phase</b> {{played the role of}} transportation of gas solute (CO{sub 2 }).

Equal volumes of aqueous and <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> will be used. The speciation of the actinides in the aqueous and <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> {{will be determined by}} a number of different spectroscopic and radiochemical techniques. Additionally the actinide distribution between the phases as a function of conditions will be determined.

40|$|International audienceA solid/liquid system {{involving}} {{activated sludge}} immobilized in an agar medium and a non-aqueous phase liquid containing the target pollutant {{has been considered}} to treat a model hydrophobic volatile organic compound, toluene. The positive impact {{of the use of}} a multiphase bioreactor is that the <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> constitutes a pollutant reservoir and also helps to overcome possible pollutant toxicity. In addition and to overcome the drawbacks of the use of a solid <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> (high pressure drop and low mass transfer) instead of a liquid <b>organic</b> <b>phase,</b> the considered solid phase was the aqueous. Consequently, silicone oil (polydimethylsiloxane) which showed its relevance for implementation in multiphase bioreactors was used. Promising results were observed from the analysis of toluene in the gaseous phase; for an initial amount of 2 g L(- 1) related to the <b>organic</b> <b>phase,</b> a v/v ratio of 0. 5 of the <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> to the aqueous agar phase, total toluene consumption was observed in about 9 days, leading to a global biodegradation rate of approximately 3. 1 mg L(- 1) h(- 1), namely in the range of values previously observed in liquid/liquid systems.

40|$|Accurate pseudo-hexagonal nanoarchitecture of nacre {{was used}} to design three {{dimensional}} finite element models of nacre, the inner layer of mollusk shells. Tensile tests were simulated introducing linear and nonlinear material properties in these models. Material parameters of components of nacre (aragonitic bricks and the complex <b>organic</b> <b>phase)</b> such as elastic modulus and hardness were obtained from bulk measurements reported in literature. In addition, nanoscale experiments conducted using atomic force microscopy and nanoindentation provided mechanical properties of aragonite platelets and <b>organic</b> <b>phase.</b> Linear simulations in the elastic regime at low stresses (2 MPa) {{was conducted on the}} new models. Our simulations indicate that a high modulus of <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> (∼ 20 GPa) is necessary to obtain the experimentally obtained bulk phase elastic response of nacre. Our nanoindentation experiments also confirmed the simulations. Further nonlinear simulations were conducted under the assumption of a fully elastic behavior of aragonite and an elastoplastic model for the <b>organic</b> <b>phase.</b> Further the yield stress of the <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> is varied over a wide range from 40 to 400 MPa. The resulting yield stress of nacre was compared to experimentally obtained value. Again ou...|$|R
40|$|The {{galvanic}} stripping {{technique for}} metal recovery uses commercial organic extractants containing a metal to be recovered. The <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> {{is placed in}} contact with a solid metal reducer that allows electrochemical reactions to occur. One product of these reactions is a metal layer deposited {{on the surface of}} the reducer consisting of reduced species desorbed from the <b>organic</b> <b>phase.</b> Another product is metal ions from the reducer adsorbed onto the <b>organic</b> <b>phase.</b> This work presents results for gold recovery by galvanic stripping of strong-base anionic extractants of a quaternary amine salt, ALIQUAT 336 ®, in xylene using solid zinc as the metal reducer. The parameters studied were contact time for the <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> containing gold and the samples of the reducing zinc metal, temperature of the system, gold concentration in the <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> and type of stirring used in the galvanic stripping system. Experiments showed results higher than 28 % of gold recovery and an adherent film of gold on the zinc surface. The Arrhenius plot for gold recovery from the organic extractant suggests a change in the rate- controlling step from mixed control to diffusion control with increasing temperature in the range of 20 to 50 ºC...|$|R

50|$|This method {{relies on}} phase {{separation}} by centrifugation of {{a mixture of}} the aqueous sample and a solution containing water-saturated phenol and chloroform, resulting in an upper aqueous phase and a lower <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> (mainly phenol). Guanidinium thiocyanate, a chaotropic agent, {{is added to the}} <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> to aid in the denaturation of proteins (such as those that strongly bind nucleic acids or those that degrade RNA). The nucleic acids (RNA and/or DNA) partition into the aqueous phase, while protein partitions into the <b>organic</b> <b>phase.</b> The pH of the mixture determines which nucleic acids get purified. Under acidic conditions (pH 4-6), DNA partitions into the <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> while RNA remains in the aqueous phase. Under neutral conditions (pH 7-8), both DNA and RNA partition into the aqueous phase. In a last step, the nucleic acids are recovered from the aqueous phase by precipitation with 2-propanol or ethanol.|$|R

40|$|There are {{few studies}} {{oriented}} {{to analyze the}} interaction between the variables of the stripping process of actual leaching solutions. The aim of this work was to study the effect of temperature and the percent of <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> in the stripping pseudo-emulsion (D 2 EPHA and kerosene) on the manganese stripping process. Other studied variables were the acid concentration (H 2 SO 4) in the aqueous phase, the percent of the <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> in the pseudo-emulsion and the number of stripping stages. This information may be of interest to countries with radical temperature variations. It was discovered that in the range of 10 ?C to 50 ?C, temperature improves the depletion of manganese from the D 2 EPHA. Additionally, the percent of the <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> should be less than 90 % by volume of the pseudo-emulsion to favour the manganese exchange.

30|$|According to TEM results {{nanoparticles}} {{prepared with}} different amount of polymer are spherical in shape, but on increasing the polymer content {{lead to a}} regular increase in nanoparticles diameter. When the amount of PLGA was doubled from 10 to 20  mg/ml of <b>organic</b> <b>phase,</b> the particle diameter increased from 270 to about 390  nm. In Fig.  3 image (b) exhibits the TEM image of nanoparticles prepared by using the PLGA as 10  mg/ml of <b>organic</b> <b>phase.</b> According to this result, it can be conclude that, for this technique the polymer content in the <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> is a significant factor, because the size of nanoparticles increased as polymer concentration was increased. The increase in the particle size {{with an increase in}} polymer amount was reported by other authors [26, 27]. This was probably caused by the increasing viscosity of dispersed <b>phase</b> (<b>organic</b> <b>phase),</b> resulting a low dispersability of the PLGA solution into the aqueous phase. Increase in polymer concentration leads to an increase in the viscous forces resisting the droplet break down by sonication. These forces oppose the shear stresses in the <b>organic</b> <b>phase</b> and the final size of particles depends on the net shear stress, which is available for droplet breakdown [24].|$|R
