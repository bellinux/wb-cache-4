5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Manne began to compose his own film scores, {{such as that}} for The Proper Time (1959), with the music also played by his own group, Shelly Manne and His Men, and issued on a Contemporary LP. In later years, Manne divided his time playing the drums on, adding special percussive effects to, and {{sometimes}} writing complete scores for both film and television. He even provided a musical setting for a recording of the Dr. Seuss children's classic Green Eggs and Ham (1960) and later performed in and sometimes wrote music for the backgrounds of numerous animated cartoons. For example, he joined other notable jazz musicians (including Ray Brown and Jimmy Rowles) in playing Doug Goodwin's music for the cartoon series The Ant and the Aardvark (19691971). Notable examples of later scores that Manne wrote himself and also performed in are, for the movies, Young Billy Young (1969) and Trader Horn (1973), and, for television, Daktari, 19661969. With these and other contributions to cartoons, children's stories, movies, television programs (and even commercials), Manne's drumming became woven into <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> <b>culture</b> of several decades.|$|E

25|$|A bhoot or bhut is {{a supernatural}} creature, usually {{the ghost of}} a {{deceased}} person, in <b>the</b> <b>popular</b> <b>culture,</b> literature and some ancient texts of the Indian subcontinent. Interpretations of how bhoots come into existence vary by region and community, but they are usually considered to be perturbed and restless due to some factor that prevents them from moving on (to transmigration, non-being, nirvana, or heaven or hell, depending on tradition). This could be a violent death, unsettled matters in their lives, or simply the failure of their survivors to perform proper funerals.|$|E
