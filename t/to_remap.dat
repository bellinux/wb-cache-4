25|$|When {{there is}} damage {{to just one}} side of the MTL, there is {{opportunity}} for normal functioning or near-normal function for memories. Neuroplasticity describes the ability of the cortex <b>to</b> <b>remap</b> when necessary. Remapping can occur in cases like the one above, and, with time, the patient can recover and become more skilled at remembering. A case report describing a patient who had two lobectomies– in the first, doctors removed part of her right MTL first because of seizures originating from the region, and later her left because she developed a tumor– demonstrates this. This case is unique because it is the only one in which both sides of the MTL were removed at different times. The authors observed that the patient was able to recover some ability to learn when she had only one MTL, but observed the deterioration of function when both sides of the MTL were afflicted. The reorganization of brain function for epileptic patients has not been investigated much, but imaging results show that it is likely.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{decentralized}} remapping method for data parallel applications on distributed memory multiprocessors. The method uses a generalized dimension exchange (GDE) algorithm periodically during the execution of an application <b>to</b> balance (<b>remap)</b> the system's workload. We implemented this remapping method in parallel WaTor simulations and parallel image thinning applications, and {{found it to be}} effective in reducing the computation time. The average performance gain is about 20 % in the WaTor simulation of a 256 × 256 ocean grid on 16 processors, and up to 8 % in the thinning of a typical image of size 128 × 128 on eight processors. The performance gains due <b>to</b> <b>remapping</b> in the image thinning case are reasonably substantial {{given the fact that the}} application by its very nature does not necessarily favor remapping. We also implemented this remapping method, using up to 32 processors, for partitioning and re-partitioning of grids in computational fluid dynamics. It was found that the GDE-based parallel refinement policy, coupled with simple geometric strategies, produces partitions that are comparable in quality to those from the best serial algorithms. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{occipital}} lobe {{contains a}} retinotopic {{representation of the}} visual field. The representation of the central retina in early visual areas (V 1 - 3) is found at the occipital pole. When the central retina is lesioned in both eyes by macular degeneration, this region of visual cortex at the occipital pole is accordingly deprived of input. However, even when such lesions occur in adulthood, some visually driven activity {{in and around the}} occipital pole can be observed. It has been suggested that this activity is due <b>to</b> <b>remapping</b> of this area, so that it now responds to inputs from intact, peripheral retina. We evaluated whether or not remapping of visual cortex underlies this activity. Our fMRI results provide no evidence of remapping, questioning the contemporary view that early visual areas of the adult human brain have the capacity to reorganize extensively...|$|R

40|$|In {{previous}} studies, we {{demonstrated that}} the forebrain commissures are the primary pathway for remapping from one hemifield to the other. Nonetheless, remapping in lateral intraparietal cortex (LIP) across hemifield is still present in split brain monkeys. This finding indicates that a subcortical structure must contribute <b>to</b> <b>remapping.</b> The primary goal {{of the current study}} was <b>to</b> characterize <b>remapping</b> activity in the superior colliculus in intact and split brain monkeys. We recorded neurons in both the superficial and intermediate layers of the SC. We found that across-hemifield remapping was reduced in magnitude and delayed compared with within-hemifield remapping in the intermediate layers of the SC in split brain monkeys. These results mirror our previous findings in area LIP. In contrast, we found no difference in the magnitude or latency for within- compared with across-hemifield remapping in the superficial layers. At the behavioral level, we compared the performance of the monkeys on two conditions of a double-step task. When the second target remained within a single hemifield, performance remained accurate. When the second target had to be updated across hemifields, the split brain monkeys' performance was impaired. Remapping activity in the intermediate layers was correlated with the accuracy and latency of the second saccade during the across-hemifield trials. Remapping in the superficial layers was correlated with latency of the second saccade during the within- and across-hemifield trials. The differences between the layers suggest that different circuits underlie remapping in the superficial and intermediate layers of the superior colliculus...|$|R
