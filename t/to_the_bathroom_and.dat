In a 1992 interview, Harrison commented on the volume of material: [...] "I didn't have many tunes on Beatles records, so doing an album like All Things Must Pass was like going <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>and</b> letting it out."

500|$|In May 1967 Leigh was rehearsing {{to appear}} with Michael Redgrave in Edward Albee's A Delicate Balance when her {{tuberculosis}} recurred. Following {{several weeks of}} rest, she seemed to recover. On the night of 7 July 1967, Merivale left her as usual at their Eaton Square flat to perform in a play, and he returned home just before midnight to find her asleep. About 30 minutes later (by now 8 July), he entered the bedroom and discovered her body on the floor. She had been attempting to walk <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>and,</b> as her lungs filled with liquid, collapsed and suffocated. Merivale first contacted her family and later was able to reach Olivier, who was receiving treatment for prostate cancer in a nearby hospital. In his autobiography, Olivier described his [...] "grievous anguish" [...] as he immediately travelled to Leigh's residence, to find that Merivale had moved her body onto the bed. Olivier paid his respects, and [...] "stood and prayed for forgiveness for all the evils that had sprung up between us", before helping Merivale make funeral arrangements; Olivier stayed until her body {{was removed from the}} flat.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} get the feel of an actual documentary, the {{producers}} hired cinematographer Randall Einhorn, who is known for directing episodes of Survivor, which allowed the show to have the feel of [...] "rough and jumpy" [...] like an actual documentary. According to producer Michael Schur, the producers to the series would follow the documentary format strictly. The producers would have long discussions over whether a scene could work under the documentary format. For example, in the fourth-season episode [...] "Did I Stutter?," [...] a scene featured Michael going through a long process to go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>and</b> not pass by Stanley. The producers debated whether that was possible and Einhorn walked through the whole scene in order to see if a camera man could get to all the places in time to shoot the whole scene. Despite the strict nature {{in the early years of}} the series, later seasons seem to have loosened the rules on the format, with the camera crew often going into places that actual documentary crews would not, which also changed the writing and comedy-style of the series. This inconsistency has received criticism from critics and fans.|$|E
500|$|Perry {{announced}} [...] "Roar" [...] {{would be}} the first single from Prism with the release of a video teaser featuring the singer burning a blue wig. More video teasers were released onto YouTube, that showed Perry at a funeral with a coffin decorated with the singer's famous pink and white pinwheels dress, and entering a recording booth while dressed with a [...] "throwback" [...] jacket featured in the single's cover art, which was revealed on August 8, 2013. It features a tiger print border around Perry, who wears a blue Japanese silk sukajan jacket, with the image of a tiger printed on its back. On the same day of the song's digital release, a lyric video for it, produced by Joe Humpay, Aya Tanimura, Tim Zimmer, and Tuan Le, was released onto YouTube. It primarily shows Perry doing daily activities such as eating breakfast, going <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom,</b> <b>and</b> taking a bath, while texting the lyrics of [...] "Roar" [...] to friends. Some words are substituted with various Emoji characters. It was target of plagiarism accusations by music producer Dillon Francis, who felt it copied the concept of instant messaging from his video entitled [...] "Messages".|$|E

To this end, Lawrence has Hoffman brought <b>to</b> <b>the</b> disused <b>bathroom</b> <b>and</b> shackled by <b>the</b> ankle <b>to</b> a pipe. Lawrence appears, throws the hacksaw he used to sever his own foot out the door, and then turns off the lights and seals the door, leaving Hoffman to die.|$|R

Megan insists Glen stay until she can drive him to his train. Betty gives Sally a hot water bottle and assures her that starting her cycle means [...] "everything is working." ...|$|E
500|$|At trial, {{it emerged}} that Capper had been kidnapped for [...] "insubstantial, even trivial" [...] reasons: Jean Powell claimed that Capper {{had tried to}} persuade her to sleep with a man for money; McNeilly and Dudson had {{contracted}} pubic lice which they believed were from a bed that Capper had also used; and McNeilly believed that she had taken a pink duffle coat that belonged to her. In November 1992, when Dudson had contracted pubic lice and had his pubic hair shaved, McNeilly told him she {{thought that he had}} caught them from Capper. Dudson believed otherwise, and said later: [...] "I told Jean [...] I thought I got them from Bernie [...]" [...] On 7 December 1992, Capper was lured to Jean Powell's home, where Glyn Powell and Dudson were already waiting. She was grabbed as soon as she arrived and held down while Glyn Powell shaved her head and her eyebrows and then made her clean up the hair and place it in a bin. Then he placed a plastic bag over her head and walked round her while hitting her on the head. She was then kicked by Jean Powell and McNeilly as she lay curled up on the floor and both women took turns beating her with a three-foot-long (1 m) wooden instrument and a belt. She was then taken <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>and</b> forced to shave off her own pubic hair as [...] "ritual humiliation in revenge for having caused, as they claimed, Dudson and McNeilly themselves to be shaved." [...] Afterwards Jean Powell locked her in a cupboard overnight. The following morning she was taken upstairs and locked in another cupboard. On 8 December she was transferred to McNeilly's house because of concern that Powell and McNeilly's six children were disturbed by Capper's crying. There she was tied spreadeagle to an upturned bed with electrical flex in a downstairs back room.|$|E

Shortly thereafter, Rocky and Hugo return pursued by rival gangsters (turning a corner where a billboard advertises Hotel Friz, an in-joke referring to director Friz Freleng). The running gunfight continues as they take cover inside the farmhouse; Bugs comically gets {{up in the middle of}} the gunfight (now also wearing a nightshirt) <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> <b>bathroom</b> <b>and</b> get a glass of water before returning to bed just as the shooting ends.|$|R

2500|$|Schwarz {{was convicted}} on June 27, 2000 for helping Volpe assault Louima in the bathroom, {{and he was}} sentenced to 15 years in prison. At the time of his conviction, there were {{numerous}} questions raised about whether he could receive a fair trial in the highly charged atmosphere. Volpe identified Wiese, not Schwarz, as the second man in a recorded interview on news show 60 Minutes, a fact not brought up in the trial. The conviction was overturned by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which found that Schwarz was denied a fair trial. However, in 2002, he pleaded guilty to a perjury charge for testifying that he did not lead Louima <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>bathroom,</b> <b>and</b> {{he was sentenced to}} five years in prison.

2500|$|While {{fighting}} {{the civil rights}} battle on the national level, Roundtree and her partner Julius Robertson undertook to represent black clients in civil and criminal matters in the segregated courtrooms of Washington, DC. At a time when black lawyers had <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> courthouses <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> <b>bathrooms</b> <b>and</b> black clients were routinely referred to white attorneys {{in order to maximize}} their chances in court, Roundtree and Robertson broke with tradition. [...] They pressed the cases of black clients before white judges and juries and prevailed, winning sizeable recoveries in accident and negligent cases. [...] Their 1957 victory in a negligence case against a Washington, DC psychiatric facility, which resulted in the maximum recovery allowable under the Federal Tort Claims Act at that time, was widely regarded as a turning point not only for black clients in the Nation's Capital, but for black attorneys as well.|$|R
