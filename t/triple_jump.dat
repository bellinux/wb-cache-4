5|$|The men's <b>triple</b> <b>jump</b> {{competition}} has been ever-present at the modern Olympics, {{but it was}} not until 1993 that a women's version gained World Championship status and went on to have its first Olympic appearance three years later. The men's standing <b>triple</b> <b>jump</b> event featured at the Olympics in 1900 and 1904, but such competitions have since become very uncommon, although it is still used as a non-competitive exercise drill.|$|E
5|$|Eleven {{male athletes}} competed {{in track and}} field events on behalf of the Bahamas. Of those athletes, three participated in the 4×400 meters relay only (Williams, Moncur, Miller); five participated only in events other than the 4×400 meters relay (Atkins, Rolle, L. Sands, S. Sands, and Thomas), and three participated in both an {{individual}} event and the 4×400 meters relay. Of the individual events, Bahamian athletes were involved in six distinct events (100 meters, 40 meters, 200 meters, <b>triple</b> <b>jump,</b> 110 meters hurdles, and high jump). The two Bahamian medals won at Beijing were won by men {{in track and field}} events (4×400 meters relay and <b>triple</b> <b>jump).</b>|$|E
5|$|The Dominica National Olympic Committee (NOC) {{selected}} one athlete (Durañona) through qualification standards. NOCs {{may enter}} athletes regardless of time (one athlete per sex) {{if they have}} no athletes meeting the entry standard. This {{made it possible for}} Dominica to have two representatives in the sport. The two athletes that were selected to compete in the Rio Games were Yordanys Durañona in the men's <b>triple</b> <b>jump</b> and Thea LaFond in the women's <b>triple</b> <b>jump.</b> Durañona was selected as the flag bearer for both the opening and closing ceremonies.|$|E
5000|$|Lurz {{was able}} to {{complete}} two different <b>triple</b> <b>jumps,</b> the Salchow and loop, making her technically competitive with other skaters such as Pötzsch and Fratianne. However, even with successfully completed <b>triple</b> <b>jumps,</b> she typically placed significantly lower in the short program and free skating segments due to low presentation scores.|$|R

5|$|All four of {{the common}} jumping events are held at indoor venues. The long and <b>triple</b> <b>jump</b> areas run {{alongside}} the central 60m track and are mostly identical in form to their outdoor counterparts. The pole vault track and landing area are also alongside the central running track. Shot put (or weight throw) is the only throwing event held indoors due to size restrictions. The throwing area {{is similar to the}} outdoor event, but the landing sector is a rectangular section surrounded by netting or a stop barrier.|$|E

5000|$|The {{technical}} {{content of}} performances was generally {{lower than in}} ISU events. Dick Button said: [...] "In the amateur world, they count your <b>triple</b> <b>jumps,</b> and if you don't do enough they forget about your other skating. We do not make our competitors prove their merit. We let them present creative programs with as many or as few <b>triple</b> <b>jumps</b> as they wish." ...|$|R

50|$|As a young skater in {{the early}} 1990s, Chen {{demonstrated}} both athletic and artistic potential. She often out-jumped many of her contemporaries and the world's top figure skaters, including Kristi Yamaguchi, Midori Ito, Tonya Harding, Surya Bonaly, and Nancy Kerrigan. She landed seven <b>triple</b> <b>jumps,</b> including a <b>triple</b> toeloop/triple toeloop combination at the 1991 World Championships held in Munich, Germany. During the free skating portion of the event, she landed more <b>triple</b> <b>jumps</b> than the top 5 finishers. This generated excitement about her prospects {{at a time when}} <b>triple</b> <b>jumps</b> were beginning to dominate women's figure skating, while Chen's artistic talents were praised by such American commentators as Scott Hamilton and Sandra Bezic.|$|R
5|$|New Super Mario Bros. is a side-scrolling video game. While {{it is seen}} in 2D, most of the {{characters}} and objects are 3D polygonal renderings on 2D backgrounds, resulting in a 2.5D effect that visually simulates 3D computer graphics. The player can play as either Mario, or his brother, Luigi. Similar to previous Mario games, Mario (or Luigi) can collect coins, stomp on enemies, and break open blocks. Moves from 3D games featuring Mario reappear in New Super Mario Bros., including the ground pound, <b>triple</b> <b>jump,</b> and wall jump. Enemies from previous games, such as Boos, are also reintroduced.|$|E

5|$|The French team, {{representing}} the Racing Club de France, included 3 {{players who were}} later part of the gold-winning rugby team for France. Jean Collas, Charles Gondouin, and Émile Sarrade were all part of both teams, while it is often misreported that another of their rugby teammates, the Haitian-born Constantin Henriquez was also on the tug of war team, {{but this was a}} case of mistaken identity due to their similar names, with Colombian-born Francisco Henríquez de Zubiría taking part in the tug of war. The other two members of the tug-of-war team were Raymond Basset and Joseph Roffo. The combined Scandinavian team featured three athletes from each of Sweden and Denmark. The Swedish competitors were August Nilsson, who also took part in the pole vault and shot put, Gustaf Söderström, who was competing in the shot put and the discus throw, and Karl Staaf, who did the pole vault, <b>triple</b> <b>jump,</b> standing <b>triple</b> <b>jump</b> and hammer throw. Only one of the three Danish pullers took part in any other events; Charles Winckler competed in the shot put and discus throw. Dane Edgar Aabye was at the Games as a journalist for the Politiken newspaper, but was recruited into the team to make up the numbers as one of the original entrants was injured. Eugen Schmidt, the sixth member of the team, had competed in the 100 metres sprint and the 200 metre rifle shooting at the 1896 Games, and founded the Danish Sports Federation that same year.|$|E

5|$|The {{main event}} was John Cena versus Rob Van Dam for the WWE Championship, which Van Dam won by pinfall after {{performing}} a Five Star Frog Splash following interference from Edge. The predominant match on the undercard was Rey Mysterio versus Sabu for the World Heavyweight Championship, {{which ended in}} a no contest after Sabu executed a <b>Triple</b> <b>Jump</b> DDT on Mysterio through a table on to the floor rendering both men kayfabe unable to wrestle, as a result, Mysterio retained the title. Another match on the undercard was Edge, Mick Foley, and Lita versus Terry Funk, Tommy Dreamer and Beulah McGillicutty in a Hardcore Intergender match.|$|E
5|$|Additional modes can be {{unlocked}} in the game. For Boss Rush Mode, {{the player}} {{is required to}} complete the game once and can then fight the bosses from the game in order {{with the number of}} bosses depending on the level of difficulty selected. Maxim Mode requires the player to finish the game with the best ending and allows the player to take control of Maxim. Unlike Juste, Maxim cannot equip items and can only use his sword and giant shuriken (sub weapon) as weapons. Maxim also has the ability to <b>triple</b> <b>jump</b> and cast certain spells by inputting certain combinations on the buttons. Finishing with the best ending also unlocks an option to listen to the music of the game.|$|E

5|$|Despite its {{similarities}} {{however, the}} gameplay offered many new changes. Instead of collecting four Jet Pods, the player-character must rescue four MuuMuus in each level before exiting. Another new addition {{is the new}} interface, which displays one of Robbit's travelling AI companions, a health bar, a timer and a jump-meter that displays {{whether or not the}} player is eligible for a <b>triple</b> <b>jump.</b> Other new additions include the power orbs as an added power-up and the ability to obtain Performance Medals. A certain Performance Medal may be awarded depending on how the player completes a level. For example, playing through a single level without firing any weapons will reward the player with the Flower Child medal. There are a total of twelve medals to collect.|$|E
5|$|Rey Mysterio versus Sabu {{was next}} in an Extreme Rules match with the World Heavyweight Championship on the line. The match started with several chair shots from both competitors. Sabu had {{the upper part}} {{for most of the}} match, {{executing}} an Arabian Facebuster and a <b>Triple</b> <b>Jump</b> Moonsault, but Mysterio kicked out of both moves. Mysterio regained the upper hand, as he executed a Seated Senton that sent both men through a table at ringside. Sabu countered a second Seated Senton attempt, and put Mysterio on a second table at ringside. Sabu proceeded to execute a Triple-Jump Somersault Splash, but Mysterio made it to his feet while on the table. This turned the move into a DDT, sending both men through the table at ringside. Although neither men were legitimately hurt, Dr. Ferdinand Rios came out and kayfabe declared that the match could not continue. This meant that Mysterio retained the World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
