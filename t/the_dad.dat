25|$|After losing at WrestleMania XX, Kane fell in {{love with}} Lita, but was spurned. This led to him {{kidnapping}} Lita in May and asking her an unknown question, to which she replied in the affirmative later that month. On the same night, Kane won a 20-Man battle royal for a World Heavyweight Championship match against Chris Benoit at Bad Blood. Six days before Bad Blood in a tag team match between Kane and La Resistance against Edge and Benoit, Kane beat Benoit after muscling out of the Crippler Crossface and giving him a huge Chokeslam. Lita later announced that she was pregnant, with Matt Hardy her then-boyfriend both on- and off-screen, assuming that he was the child's father. On the June 21 episode of Raw, Kane claimed that he was <b>the</b> <b>dad.</b> The next week, he explained that he had impregnated Lita in order to continue his legacy and justified a vicious attack on Shawn Michaels several weeks earlier by claiming that Michaels had stood in the way of him winning the World Heavyweight Championship. In order to appease Kane, General Manager Eric Bischoff gave Kane a rematch with Benoit, instructing Benoit that he could only win by submission, whereas Kane could win the title by any means. Despite dominating much of the match, Kane again lost to Benoit. Following the match, Lita came to the ring and low-blowed Kane, who initially went to chokeslam her in revenge but stopped when he realized that she was trying to force him to cause her to miscarry their child.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Isaac Hempstead-Wright, who portrays Bran Stark in the series, Wright {{was asked about the}} significance of Bran witnessing the scene at the Tower of Joy, saying [...] "I don't think Bran knows why this is significant, but he knows that it is significant because he wouldn't have seen it if it wasn't earth-shattering, because everything we've learned so far during his visions has been pretty big and important, from the creation of the first White Walker to the origins of Hodor. This is clearly another important milestone in the history of Westeros. For Bran, he sat there sitting, 'This isn't my brother. This is my cousin somehow, but who's <b>the</b> <b>dad?</b> And why have I been shown this? If I find out who <b>the</b> <b>dad</b> is and why I need to know who <b>the</b> <b>dad</b> is, then let Jon know quick.'" [...] The scene reveals neither Lyanna Stark's son's name nor his father's, with the transition between the newborn's face and Jon Snow's visually conveying the identity. HBO released an infographic shortly after the episode aired, confirming Ned Stark as Jon's guardian, and Lyanna Stark and Rhaegar Targaryen as his parents.|$|E

2500|$|The convicts of {{the early}} colonial period helped {{establish}} anti-authoritarianism as a hallmark of Australian comedy.

His contemporary, Banjo Paterson, contributed a number of classic comic poems including The Man from Ironbark [...] and The Geebung Polo Club. CJ Dennis wrote humour in the Australian vernacular – notably in The Songs of a Sentimental Bloke. <b>The</b> <b>Dad</b> and Dave series about a farming family was an enduring hit {{of the early}} 20th century.
