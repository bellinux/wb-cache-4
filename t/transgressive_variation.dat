40|$|A {{quantitative}} trait locus (QTL), dth 1. 1, was associated with <b>transgressive</b> <b>variation</b> for days to heading in an advanced backcross population derived from the Oryza sativa variety Jefferson and an accession of the wild rice relative Oryza rufipogon. A series of near-isogenic lines (NILs) containing different O. rufipogon introgressions across the target region were constructed to dissect dth 1. 1 using substitution mapping. In contrast to the late-flowering O. rufipogon parent, O. rufipogon alleles in the substitution lines caused early flowering under both short- and long-day lengths and provided evidence {{for at least two}} distinct sub-QTL: dth 1. 1 a and dth 1. 1 b. Potential candidate genes underlying these sub-QTL include genes with sequence similarity to Arabidopsis GI, FT, SOC 1, and EMF 1, and Pharbitis nil PNZIP. Evidence from families with nontarget O. rufipogon introgressions in combination with dth 1. 1 alleles also detected an early flowering QTL on chromosome 4 and a late-flowering QTL on chromosome 6 and provided evidence for additional sub-QTL in the dth 1. 1 region. The availability of a series of near-isogenic lines with alleles introgressed from a wild relative of rice provides an opportunity to better understand the molecular basis of <b>transgressive</b> <b>variation</b> in a {{quantitative trait}}...|$|E

40|$|It is {{estimated}} that 5 million years of evolution separate Arabidopsis thaliana from its close relative Arabidopsis lyrata. The two taxa differ by many characteristics, and together they exemplify the differentiation of angiosperms into self-fertilizing and cross-fertilizing species as well as annual and perennial species. Despite their disparate life histories, the two species can be crossed to produce viable and vigorous hybrids exhibiting heterotic effects. Although pollen sterile, the hybrids produce viable ovules and were used as female parent in backcrosses to both parental species. The resulting backcross plants exhibited <b>transgressive</b> <b>variation</b> {{for a number of}} interesting developmental and growth traits as well as negative nuclear/cytoplasmic interactions. Moreover, the genesis of a fertile amphidiploid neospecies, apparently by spontaneous somatic doubling in an interspecific hybrid, was observed in the laboratory.

Warming of surface waters during S 5 deposition is indicated by the high abundance of the calcareous nannofossil "small" Gephyrocapsa group, {{the presence of the}} dinoflagellate species Spiniferites mirabilis, Spiniferites pachydermus, Lingulodinium machaerophorum and Polysphaeridium zoharyi, and the tropical-subtropical diatom Pseudosolenia calearavis, Chaetoceros resting spores, Rhizosolenids and Thalassionema group. Increased productivity accompanied S 5 deposition as evidenced by a general decrease in abundance of calcareous nannofossil superficial species and a coeval increase of dinocysts and diatoms. The productivity increase is further supported by an increase of the deep dwelling calcareous nannofossil species Florisphaera profunda. Stratification of near-surface waters is recorded by the presence of the dinocyst species L. machaerophorum and P zoharyi together with the co-occurrence of the diatom Chaetoceros resting-spore group, Thalassionema frauenfieldii, and Thalassionema nitzschioides var. parva, which reflect transport of neritic waters off-shore, and by the presence of some freshwater and transport-related diatom taxa (Cyclotella, Diatomella and Diploneis). Gradual shoaling of the nutricline and a gradual weakening of water stratification at the end of S 5 deposition is indicated by an increase in the deep dwelling calcareous nannoplankton species Gladiolithus flabellatus, which suggests a less-deep niche compared to the deeper dwelling F profunda.

Moreover, the occurrence of upwelling-related diatom and dinocyst taxa, such as Chaetoceros resting spores and S. pachydermus, suggests the presence of a former gyre structure south of Crete that was active during S 5 time...|$|R

Using the randomly intermated B 73 x Mo 17 (IBM) RIL mapping population, we are identified chromosome regions which control brace root development. Previous work analyzed data from 94 mapping lines and identified numerous QTL. The number of potential candidates within these QTL intervals is too large to realistically test. For this reason, we are utilizing a larger number of mapping lines from this population in combination with additional markers, especially within known QTL regions, to refine the QTL intervals and reduce the number of candidate genes. The IBM mapping population was evaluated in the field in two replications in the summer of 2006. Pictures were taken and brace root angles were measured digitally using Image J. Analysis of variance was performed in SAS (SAS Institute, Raleigh, NC) with replicates and lines as main effects.

Here, we use an assay to select hybrid genotypes that can proliferate in environmental conditions beyond the conditions tolerated by their parents, and we directly compete them against parental genotypes in habitats across environmental clines. We made 45 different hybrid swarms by crossing yeast strains (both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S. paradoxus) with different genetic and phenotypic divergence. We compared {{the ability of}} hybrids and parents to colonize seven types of increasingly extreme environmental clines, representing both natural and novel challenges (mimicking pollution events). We found that a significant majority of hybrids had greater environmental ranges compared to the average of both their parents’ ranges (mid-parent transgression), but {{only a minority of}} hybrids had ranges exceeding their best parent (best-parent transgression). Transgression was affected by the specific strains involved in the cross and by the test environment. Genetic and phenotypic crossing distance predicted the extent of transgression in only two of the seven environments. We isolated a set of potentially transgressive hybrids selected at the extreme ends of the clines and found that many could directly outcompete their parents across whole clines and were between 1. 5 - and 3 -fold fitter on average.

Industrial bioethanol fermentations are intrinsically stressful environments for yeast and the adaptive protective response varies between strain backgrounds. With the aim of identifying quantitative trait loci (QTL’s) that regulate phenotypic variation, linkage analysis on six F 1 crosses from four highly divergent clean lineages of S. cerevisiae was performed.

Jefferson × O. rufipogon (IRGC 105491) population based on five generations of backcrossing and seven generations of selfing. Despite {{the use of an}} interspecific cross for mapping and the pericentromeric location of the QTL, we observed no suppression of recombination and have been able to narrow down the location of the gene underlying this QTL to a 93. 8 -kb region. The locus was associated with <b>transgressive</b> <b>variation</b> for grain size and grain weight in this population and features prominently in many other inter- and intraspecific crosses of rice. The phenotype was difficult to evaluate due to the large amount of variance in size and weight among grains on a panicle and between grains on primary and secondary panicles, underscoring the value of using multiple approaches to phenotyping, including extreme sampling and NIL group-mean comparisons.

In an effort to overcome these limitations, we constructed a linkage map and conducted a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of 10 agronomic and fiber quality traits in a recombinant inbred mapping population derived from a cross between TM- 1, an Upland cotton line, and NM 24016, an elite line with stabilized introgression from.

40|$|As a major {{food source}} potato {{delivers}} significant levels of minerals {{to the human}} diet. The {{aim of this study}} was to understand the control over the mineral concentrations found in tubers. The three-dimensional patterns of mineral distribution in tubers give clues to the processes leading to storage in the tuber. Within the tuber flesh, calcium and phosphorus content decreased towards the centre of the tuber (on FW basis). The elements iron, magnesium, zinc, manganese, sulphur and chlorine were higher at the stem end, while potassium was higher at the bud end. Remobilisation of minerals within the tuber was evident after six months of cold storage. Mineral variation was explored in potato germ plasm. Three diverse germ plasm collections, the Commonwealth Potato Collection, the Phureja and Tuberosum Core Collection and the Neotuberosum Population demonstrated wide variation for tuber mineral concentrations, an interaction with tuber yield and, on multivariate analysis, consistent parallels between some minerals suggesting unsuspected shared processes affecting their concentrations. The 12601 ab 1 x Stirling tetraploid mapping population was used to identify QTLs for tuber mineral concentration using REML analysis to account for local field <b>variation.</b> <b>Transgressive</b> segregation for tuber mineral concentrations was detected. The genetic map for this population was extended using DArT markers and QTLs were identified on all 12 linkage groups for all minerals studied. Two bulk segregant analyses were performed to add precision to the QTL analysis. One approach identified candidate genes on the potato genome sequence and used nearby SSRs to seek association in the tetraploid mapping population. A second approach used the variation present in the highly diverse Neotuberosum Population to identify DArT markers which were associated with the tails of the distribution of minerals. Using the latter approach, single superscaffolds containing candidate loci and trait-associated DArT markers could be aligned with a small part of mapping population QTLs, providing additional resolution.

40|$|Evidence {{that adult}} humans have {{functional}} brown adipose tissue has stirred {{interest in the}} possibility that the impressive effectiveness of induction of brown adipocytes to reduce obesity in mice may be translated to the human condition. A major focus recently on the identification of signaling and transcription factor that stimulate the induction of brown adipocytes has come from transgenic and gene KO models. However, these models have created a very complex picture of the regulatory mechanisms for brown fat induction. In this review insights into the critical regulatory pathways involved in brown adipocyte induction in the retroperitoneal fat depot of mice are described from quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of allelic variability determining Ucp 1 levels and brown adipocyte induction in A/J vs. B 6 mice. The key observation is that recombinant genotypes, found in recombinant inbred stains and backcross and intercross progeny, show <b>transgressive</b> <b>variation</b> for Ucp 1 mRNA levels. These genetic crosses also show that the levels of Ucp 1 mRNA are determined by interactions that control the levels of PPARα, PGC- 1 α, and type 2 deiodinase (DIO 2) and that each factor is controlled by a subset of QTLs that also control Ucp 1 expression. These results indicate that induction of Ucp 1 in the retroperitoneal fat depot involves synergy between signaling and transcription factors that vary depending upon the environmental conditions.

The emergence of these {{forms in the}} absence of true wild rice remains unclear. A genetic analysis of domestication-related traits (weed syndrome) has been conducted to better understand the appearance of these plants in rice fields. A doubled haploid (DH) population was derived from a cross between a #japonica$ variety and a weedy plant collected in Camarque (France) to set up a genetic linkage map consisting of 68 SSR and 31 AFLP loci. Five qualitative traits related to pigmentation of different organs and 15 developmental and morphological quantitative traits were scored for genes and QTLs mapping. Despite a good reactivity in another culture and a high fertility of DH lines, segregation distortions were observed on chromosonal segments bearing gametophytic and sterility genes and corresponded to various QTLs evidenced in #indica$ x #japonica$ distant crosses. Mapping of the coloration genes was found to be in agreement with the presence of several genes previously identified and according to the genetic model governing the synthesis and distribution of anthocyan pigment in the plant. In addition, the main specific traits of weedy forms revealed the same genes/QTLs as progeny derived from a cross between #Oryza sativa$ and its wild progenitor #O. rufipogon$. A large variation for most characters was found in the DH population, including <b>transgressive</b> <b>variation.</b> Significant correlations were observed between morphology and traits related to weeds and corresponded to a distinct colocalization of most of the QTLs on a limited number of chromosomal regions.

40|$|Abstract Background Rapid {{response}} to selection was previously observed in mice selected for {{high levels of}} inter-male aggression based on number of attacks displayed in a novel social interaction test after isolation housing. Attack levels in this high aggression line (NC 900) increased significantly within just four generations of selective breeding, suggesting {{the presence of a}} locus with large effect. We conducted an experiment using a small (n ≈ 100) F 2 cross between the ICR-derived, non-inbred NC 900 strain and the low aggression inbred strain C 57 BL/ 6 J, genotyped for 154 fully informative SNPs, to determine if a locus with large effect controls the high-aggression selection trait. A second goal was to use high density SNP genotyping (n = 549, 000) in the parental strains to characterize residual patterns of heterozygosity within NC 900, and evaluate regions that are identical by descent (IBD) between NC 900 and C 57 BL/ 6 J, to determine what impacts these may have on accuracy and resolution of quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in the F 2 cross. Results No evidence for a locus with major effect on aggressive behavior in mice was identified. However, several QTL with genomewide significance were mapped for aggression on chromosomes 7 and 19 and other social behavior traits on chromosomes 4, 7, 14, and 19. High density genotyping revealed that 28 % of the genome is still segregating among the six NC 900 females used to originate the F 2 cross, and that segregating regions are present on every chromosome but are of widely different sizes. Regions of IBD between NC 900 and C 57 BL/ 6 J are found on every chromosome but are most prominent on chromosomes 10, 16 and X. No significant differences were found for amounts of heterozygosity or prevalence of IBD in QTL regions relative to global analysis. Conclusions While no major gene was identified to explain the rapid selection response in the NC 900 line, <b>transgressive</b> <b>variation</b> (i. e. where the allele from the C 57 BL/ 6 J increased attack levels) and a significant role for dominant gene action were hallmarks of the genetic architecture for aggressive behavior uncovered in this study. The high levels of heterozygosity and the distribution of minor allele frequency observed in the NC 900 population suggest that maintenance of heterozygosity may have been under selection in this line. </p...|$|E
40|$|Summary Seed is {{the basic}} and most {{critical}} input for seed propagated agricultural crops: seed quality and seedling vigour determine plant establishment, growth and development in both natural and agricultural ecosystems. Seed quality and seedling vigour are mainly determined by the interactions of the following three components: genetic background, physiological quality and the environmental conditions during seed set, seed ripening, storage, seed germination and early seedling development. In the past, many efforts {{have been made to}} improve seed germination and seedling vigour by optimizing physiological and environmental factors (non-genetic factors); however, the paradigm has shifted to investigate genetic factors and to use these to improve crop performance by plant breeding. The aim of this thesis is to unravel the genetics of seed germination and seedling vigour under different conditions in Brassica rapa, using a systems genetics approach. Studies in many crop species have reported that seed germination and seedling vigour traits are governed by many genes and are strongly affected by environmental conditions. As salinity stress is becoming {{one of the most important}} abiotic stresses affecting crop growth and yield, we studied the genetics of seed germination and seedling vigour under neutral and salt stress conditions. For a number of crops, it has been established that larger seed size and higher seed weight indicate more reserve food and contribute positively to seedling establishment. Therefore, our hypothesis for this thesis is that transcriptional regulation of genes during seed development determines the composition and content of seed reserves, and that these seed reserves play a major role in seed germination and seedling growth, especially at the heterotrophic stage under optimal and sub-optimal conditions.  B. rapa is an extremely diverse Brassica species which includes, besides many diverse leafy vegetable types and turnips, also oilseed crops. Brassica seeds are of high economic importance for several reasons. They are the starting point of the life cycle of the crop, but also they are directly used as sources of vegetable oil or condiments. At present, B. napus is the most important source of vegetable oil worldwide, but B. rapa is often used for introgression breeding to broaden its narrow genetic base resulting in genetic improvements. Therefore, the acquired knowledge is also useful for the scientific community and plant breeders working in B. napus and other Brassica species. In Chapter 2 we evaluated the genetic diversity of a B. rapa core collection of 168 accessions representing different crop types and geographic origins. Using the Bayesian cluster analysis software STRUCTURE, we identified four subpopulations: subpopulation 1 with accessions of Indian origin, spring oil, yellow sarson and rapid cycling; subpopulation 2 consisting of several types from Asian origins: pak choi, winter oil, mizuna, mibuna, komasuna, turnip green, oil rape and Asian turnip; subpopulation 3, which included mainly accessions of Chinese cabbage and subpopulation 4 with mostly vegetable turnip, fodder turnip and brocoletto accessions from European origin. The geographical distribution of the accessions was very much congruent with genetic, metabolic and morphological diversity. This initial study was followed by association studies for secondary metabolites from the tocopherol and carotenoids pathways, using the population structure of these four subpopulations as a correction term to control for spurious marker-trait associations (Chapter 2). Additionally, we used a machine learning approach, Random Forest (RF) regression, to find marker-trait associations. We chose the RF approach as it can handle large numbers of variables (markers, metabolites, transcript abundance) in combination with relatively small sample sets of accessions, to show its perspectives for application to the increasing amounts of data available through the different ~omics technologies. In our analysis, the markers showing significant association with metabolites identified by the RF approach overlapped with markers obtained from association mapping. Those markers could potentially be used for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in breeding for these secondary metabolites in different morphotypes or sub-populations. Knowledge of genetic distance as evaluated in this chapter allowed the choice of parents to create a segregating population for QTL analyses by maximizing genetic variation between the parents. In Chapter 4, a doubled haploid (DH) population from a cross of genetically diverse morphotypes of B. rapa, an oil-type yellow sarson (YS 143) and a vegetable pak choi (PC 175) (Chapter 2), was used to evaluate the genetic basis of seed germination and seedling vigour traits under both non-stress and salt stress conditions. The yellow sarson parent had larger seed size and higher thousand-seed weight than the pak choi parent, and displayed earlier onset, higher uniformity in germination, faster germination and maximum germination, and higher root- and shoot- lengths and biomass under both non-stress and salt stress conditions. Positive correlations of thousand-seed weight with earliness, speed and uniformity of germination and maximum germination percentage, supports that larger seeds germinate earlier, faster, more uniformly and to a higher maximum germination percentage than smaller seeds. Thus, we conclude that yellow sarson had higher seed quality and seedling vigour than pak choi. However yellow sarson also contributed negative alleles to seed germination, as illustrated by its allele of the QTL at A 05 which decreases the uniformity of seed germination. In addition we also observed that yellow sarson seedling growth was more affected by salt stress than pak choi. All traits were scored over the DH population, and this clearly showed <b>transgressive</b> <b>variation</b> for most traits. Eight QTL hotspots were identified for seed weight, seed germination, and root and shoot lengths. A QTL hotspot for seed germination on A 02 co-located with a homologue of the FLOWERING LOCUS C (BrFLC 2) genes and its cis-acting expression QTL (cis-eQTL). FLC 2 (BrFLC 2 in B. rapa) is an important repressor of flowering time in both A. thaliana and B. rapa and recently, FLC 2 was reported for its pleiotropic effect on seed germination in A. thaliana. A QTL hotspot on A 05 with salt stress specific QTL co-located with the FATTY ACID DESATURASE 2 (BrFAD 2) gene and its cis-eQTL. Besides the role of FAD 2 in fatty acid desaturation, the up-regulation of this gene was associated with enhanced seed germination and hypocotyl elongation under salinity in B. napus (BnFAD 2) and A. thaliana (FAD 2). We observed epistatic interactions between the QTL hotspots at the BrFLC 2 and BrFAD 2 loci, and between other QTL hotspots. Seed development is regulated by many dynamic metabolic processes controlled by complex networks of spatially and temporally expressed genes. Therefore, morphological characteristics and the transcriptional signatures of developing seeds from yellow- and brown/black-seeded genotypes were studied to get to know the timing of key metabolic processes, to explore the major transcriptional differences and to identify the optimum stage for a genetical genomics study for B. rapa seed traits (Chapter 3). This is the first study of genome-wide profiling of transcript abundance during seed development in B. rapa. Most transcriptional changes occurred between 25 and 35 days after pollination (between the bent-cotyledon stage and the stage when the embryo fully fills the seed), which is later than in the related species B. napus. A weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified 47 gene modules with different co-expression patterns, of which 17 showed a genotype effect, 4 modules a time effect during seed development and 6 modules both genotype and time effects. Based on the number of genes in gene modules, the predominant variation in gene expression was according to developmental stages rather than morphotype differences. We identified 17 putative cis-regulatory elements (motifs) for four co-regulated gene clusters of genes related to lipid metabolism. The identification of key physiological events, major expression patterns, and putative cis-regulatory elements provides useful information to construct gene regulatory networks in B. rapa developing seeds and provides a starting point for a genetical genomics study of fatty acid composition and additional seed traits in Chapter 5. Since Brassica seeds are sources of vegetable oil, genetic studies of the gene regulatory mechanisms underlying lipid metabolism is of high importance, not only in relation to seed and seedling vigour, but also for Brassica oilseed breeding. In Chapter 5, an integrative approach of QTL mapping for fatty acids composition and for transcript abundance (eQTL) of genes related to lipid metabolism, together with gene co-expression networks was used to unravel the genetic regulation of seed fatty acid composition in the DH population of B. rapa. In this study, a confounding effect of flowering time variation was observed on fatty acid QTLs (metabolite level) at linkage group A 02 and of seed colour variation on eQTLs (transcript level) at linkage group A 09. At A 02, fatty acid QTLs from 2009 seeds co-locate with the genetic position of a gene-targeted marker for BrFLC 2, its cis-QTL, and a major flowering time QTL. Flowering time variation is very obvious in this DH population and the BrFLC 2 gene at A 02 (16. 7 cM) is the major regulator of flowering time, with a non-functional allele in the yellow sarson parent. When QTL analysis was performed on seeds from 2011, from DH lines that flowered synchronously due to staggered sowing, this fatty acid QTL hotspot disappeared. The 2011 seed lot was used for further analysis combining fatty acid QTLs with eQTLs in this study. On A 09, a large trans-eQTL hotspot was co-localized with a major seed colour QTL, in the region where the causal gene, the bHLH transcription factor BrTT 8, was cloned. The role of this gene in seed colour development was functionally proven in B. rapa. As the yellow sarson and pak choi parents of this population have contrasting seed coat colour (Chapter 3) the DH lines segregated for seed colour. When seed colour variation was used as a co-variate in our statistical model, we could exclude its confounding effect on eQTL mapping. We compared the fatty acid QTL and eQTL results from the analyses before and after seed colour correction and later discuss the results from the analysis after correction. The distribution of major QTLs for fatty acids showed a relationship with the types of fatty acids: linkage group A 03 contained major QTLs for monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), A 04 for saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and A 05 for polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Using a genetical genomics approach, eQTL hotspots were found at major fatty acid QTLs on A 03, A 04 and A 05 and on A 09. Finally, an eQTL-guided gene co-expression network of lipid metabolism related genes showed major hubs at the genes BrPLA 2 -ALPHA, BrWD- 40, a number of seed storage protein genes and a transcription factor BrMD- 2, suggesting essential roles of these genes in lipid metabolism. Several genes, such as BrFAE 1, BrTAG 1, BrFAD 2, BrFAD 5, BrFAD 7, which were reported as important genes for fatty acid composition in seeds in other studies of related species, had relatively lower degrees of connection in the networks. However their cis-eQTLs co-localized with specific fatty acid QTLs, making them candidate genes for the observed variation. We hypothesize that these play a role in modifying fatty acid content or composition across genotypes, rather than playing essential roles in the pathway itself. These results suggest the need of a global study of lipid metabolism rather than a strict focus on the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway per se. This study gives a starting point for understanding the genetic regulation of lipid metabolism, by identification of a number of key regulatory genes, identified as major hub genes, and candidate genes for fatty acid QTLs. In the final chapter (Chapter 6) we summarize and critically discuss the relationships among phenotypic traits, metabolites and expression variation as well as the co-localization of QTLs from these different levels. In this thesis, we developed methodology to integrate transcriptomics and metabolomics data sets and to construct gene regulatory networks related to major fatty acids, and found a set of (possible) candidate genes involved in lipid metabolism. In the future, we recommend to integrate the genome-wide transcriptome data set with all major seed metabolites and phenotypic data on seed and seedling vigour to directly link all three components: transcriptome, metabolome and phenotypic traits, and ultimately expand the knowledge on the genetic regulation of seed metabolites, seed quality and seedling vigour in B. rapa to other Brassica species...|$|E
