40|$|A {{pension plan}} {{is said to}} be exactly vested if it {{provides}} in addition to the benefit available upon retirement, a benefit, upon termination for any cause prior to retirement, which is exactly equivalent to the actuarial accured liability for the <b>terminating</b> <b>participant.</b> The concept of exact vesting has simple application in defined contribution plans such as those of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association. It is also feasible to develop the exact vesting concept for a defined benefit plan which uses an individual type of actuarial cost method. An exactly vested plan would have more individual equity than is available under customary vesting and early retirement provisions of defined benefit plans. In this paper, theory is developed for an exactly vested model plan in parallel to the theory for a pure pension model plan discussed in previous papers on pension funding dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Performance {{management}} systems that provide (relatively) quick feedback to program operators {{play an important}} role in employment and training programs around the world. This paper brings together evidence on the effects of such systems, drawn primarily from the widely studied U. S. Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) program. The questions addressed include the effects of performance standards systems on who gets served, on what services they receive, on the technical efficiency of program operation, on the economic efficiency of program operation, and on strategic behavior by program managers to “game ” the system. Though incomplete on important dimensions, the available evidence makes it clear that the JTPA standards did little to enhance the impact of the program on employment and earnings, while at the same time inducing attempts to “game ” the system by actions such as <b>terminating</b> <b>participants</b> at a time that would maximize measured performance rather than when services are no longer provided. We conclude by drawing policy conclusions from the available evidence and making suggests for future research...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Ontology {{development}} is {{time and money}} consuming {{as well as an}} error-prone process; the need for an embedded mechanism that evaluates quality and acceptance of the resultant collaborative ontology is apparent. Existing tools and methodologies lack consensus building mechanisms that must be employed in order for a team to cooperate and agree on the design and deployment process of a shared one. In this paper we describe a collaborative methodology for ontology development that supports a team to reach consensus through iterative evaluations and improvements. In every cycle of the iterative process, the structure of the collaborative ontology is revised and evolved. Finally, the process <b>terminates</b> when the <b>participants</b> have no more critiques and objections. We illustrate the methodology by creating an ontology for an airline training centre using the PROTÉGÉ software tool...|$|R

(Previous work generally used simple stimuli.) Researchers discovered that when a target is rare, participants spend less time searching before concluding that it is absent (regardless of stimuli complexity).

40|$|Background: As {{healthcare}} services become {{progressively more}} stretched, {{there is increasing}} discussion {{of ways in which}} technological adjuncts may be used to deliver more cost-efficient services. Before widespread implementation, however, the use of these adjuncts requires proper scrutiny of their effects on psychological practice. Aims: This research examined the effectiveness of SMS reminders on client appointment attendance and dropout in a psychological treatment setting. It was predicted that the reminders would result in increased initial appointment attendance, increased total appointment attendance, and decreased client dropout. Method: A randomized controlled trial investigated the impact of SMS appointment reminders (two levels: present or absent) on client attendance (three levels: attended, rescheduled, or did not attend) and dropout (two levels: completed treatment or <b>terminate</b> early). <b>Participants</b> (N = 140) at an outpatient psychology clinic were randomly allocated to either receive an SMS appointment reminder one day before their scheduled appointment, or to receive no reminder. Results: No {{significant differences were found between}} the SMS and no SMS conditions in relation to appointment attendance. There were more client dropouts in the SMS compared to the no SMS condition. Conclusions: The SMS appointment reminders were not effective at increasing appointment attendance. The current research suggests that there is more to client non-attendance in psychological settings than the simple forgetting of appointments. Technological adjuncts may be useful in increasing the cost-efficiency of current services; however, this research highlights the importance of understanding the effects of technology before widespread implementation.

40|$|The session {{initiation}} protocol (SIP) is {{a powerful}} application-layer protocol which {{is used as a}} signaling one for establishing, modifying, and <b>terminating</b> sessions among <b>participants.</b> Authentication is becoming an increasingly crucial issue when a user asks to access SIP services. Hitherto, many authentication schemes have been proposed to enhance the security of SIP. In 2014, Arshad and Nikooghadam proposed an enhanced authentication and key agreement scheme for SIP and claimed that their scheme could withstand various attacks. However, in this paper, we show that Arshad and Nikooghadam’s authentication scheme is still susceptible to key-compromise impersonation and trace attacks and does not provide proper mutual authentication. To conquer the flaws, we propose a secure and efficient ECC-based authentication scheme for SIP. Through the informal and formal security analyses, we demonstrate that our scheme is resilient to possible known attacks including the attacks found in Arshad et al. ’s scheme. In addition, the performance analysis shows that our scheme has similar or better efficiency in comparison with other existing ECC-based authentication schemes for SIP...|$|R
40|$|Language {{comprehension}} {{requires that}} single words be grouped into syntactic phrases, as words in sentences {{are too many}} to memorize individually. In speech, acoustic and syntactic grouping patterns mostly align. However, when ambiguous sentences allow for alternative grouping patterns, comprehenders may form phrases that contradict speech prosody. While delta-band oscillations are known to track prosody, we hypothesized that linguistic grouping bias can modulate the interpretational impact of speech prosody in ambiguous situations, which should surface in delta-band oscillations when grouping patterns chosen by comprehenders differ from those indicated by prosody. In our auditory electroencephalography study, the interpretation of ambiguous sentences depended on whether an identical word was either followed by a prosodic boundary or not, thereby signaling the ending or continuation of the current phrase. Delta-band oscillatory phase at the critical word should reflect whether <b>participants</b> <b>terminate</b> a phrase {{despite a lack of}} acoustic boundary cues. Crossing speech prosody with participants’ grouping choice, we observed a main effect of grouping choice—independent of prosody. An internal linguistic bias for grouping words into phrases can thus modulate the interpretational impact of speech prosody via delta-band oscillatory phase...|$|R
30|$|Approval for the {{research}} {{was obtained from the}} School Research Ethics Committee. Advertisement leaflets were distributed in the Southampton area and in a number of bowling clubs. All subjects were tested in the morning so as to avoid systematic effects of fatigue. The participants were first given a short (3 to 4  min) run on the practice drive (the beginning portion had S-curves, which can expose drivers prone to simulation sickness) in the driving simulator to ensure that the driver was not prone to simulation sickness syndrome. Nausea, disorientation and ocular problems such as eyestrain, blurred vision and eye fatigue have been reported as some of the indicators of simulation sickness in fixed-base simulators [27, 32]. If a participant experienced the syndrome, the practice drive was immediately <b>terminated</b> and the <b>participant</b> was deemed unfit to take the simulation drive. If a participant did not feel any discomfort in the practice drive, then the rest of the protocol followed. The sample of drivers was tested over a period of 3  months. The annual road mileage of participants was not considered as most drivers (especially older drivers) confessed to its inaccuracy. This inaccurate reporting of annual mileage by older drivers may have been consciously reported because of its roots in the low-mileage bias phenomena [26].|$|R
40|$|Dropout is {{a common}} and serious problem in {{psychological}} research and practice. When <b>participants</b> <b>terminate</b> treatment prematurely, this may have methodological and clinical consequences. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify predictors of dropout in a sample of patients (N = 217) with sub-threshold and mild panic disorder treated with a public mental health intervention programme based on cognitive-behavioural principles. Three groups of possible baseline predictors were selected from the literature: (1) socio-demographic, (2) personal, and (3) illness-related variables. A total of 51 (23. 5 %) participants were classified as dropouts. Dropouts were further subdivided into pretreatment dropouts (n = 17) who attended no course sessions at all and regular dropouts (n = 34) who attended 1 – 5 course sessions. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify independent predictors of dropout. Few variables were significantly associated with increased odds of dropout and the total explained variance was small. Fewer years of education was the only independent predictor of total dropout and male gender was associated with more pretreatment dropout. No independent predictors were found for regular dropout. It can be concluded that it is difficult to precisely predict dropout risk in patients participating in a public mental health intervention for panic symptoms...|$|R
40|$|In today’s U. S. {{airspace}} operations, each {{sector has}} a capacity threshold {{in the form}} of the maximum number of aircraft. This threshold, called as Monitor Alert Parameter, serves as a controller workload limit indicator for each sector. Studies have shown that a number of factors, beyond a simple aircraft count, affect sector complexity and controller workload. This study examined if a sector’s capacity could be based on a measure of maximum manageable complexity rather than a simple aircraft count. The results of a human-in-the-loop simulation study were used to identify the maximum acceptable complexity and its relationship with sector capacity. Aircraft in the study continued to enter the simulated sector until the controller <b>participant</b> <b>terminated</b> the simulation due to excessive workload, thus providing a sector complexity threshold. The number of aircraft at that complexity threshold varied, which provided a range of capacity values. In most cases, the controllers were able to handle more than the current instantaneous capacity limit. However, at higher complexities, losses of separations were observed. At the safest complexity range (1 to just under 4), where there were no separation losses, the maximum average number of aircraft controlled was about 24 indicating that sector capacities will vary if they are based on complexity. ...|$|R

40|$|One {{way to make}} {{inferences about}} social statistics, such as the {{frequencies}} of health risks in the population, is to probe relevant instances in one`s social network. People can infer, for instance, the relative frequency of different diseases by probing how many members of their social network suffer from them. How are such instance-based inferences cognitively implemented? Noncompensatory strategies based on lexicographic and limited search have been extensively examined {{in the context of}} cue-based inference. Their role in instance-based inference, by contrast, has received scant attention. We propose the social-circle heuristic as a model of noncompensatory instance-based inference entailing lexicographic and limited search, and test its descriptive and prescriptive implications: To what extent do people rely on the social-circle heuristic? How accurate is the noncompensatory heuristic relative to a compensatory strategy when inferring event frequencies? Two empirical studies show that the heuristic accurately predicts the judgments of a substantial portion of participants. A response time analysis also supports the assumption of lexicographic search: The earlier the heuristic predicted search to be <b>terminated,</b> the faster <b>participants</b> classified as using the social-circle heuristic responded. Using computer simulations to systematically investigate the heuristic`s prescriptive implications, we find that despite its limited search, the heuristic can approximate the accuracy of a compensatory strategy in skewed and in spatially clustered environments both common properties of distributions in real-world social environments.

40|$|Abstract Background Tetrabenazine (TBZ) {{selectively}} depletes central monoamines by reversibly binding to the type- 2 vesicular monoamine transporter. A previous {{double blind}} study in Huntington disease (HD) demonstrated that TBZ effectively suppressed chorea, with a favorable short-term safety profile (Neurology 2006; 66 : 366 - 372). The {{objective of this}} study was to assess the long-term safety and effectiveness of TBZ for chorea in HD. Methods Subjects who completed the 13 -week, double blind protocol were invited to participate in this open label extension study for up to 80 weeks. Subjects were titrated to the best individual dose or a maximum of 200 mg/day. Chorea was assessed using the Total Maximal Chorea (TMC) score from the Unified Huntington Disease Rating Scale. Results Of the 75 participants, 45 subjects completed 80 weeks. Three <b>participants</b> <b>terminated</b> due to adverse events (AEs) including depression, delusions with associated previous suicidal behavior, and vocal tics. One subject died due to breast cancer. The other 26 subjects chose not to continue on with each ensuing extension for various reasons. When mild and unrelated AEs were excluded, the most commonly reported AEs (number of subjects) were sedation/somnolence (18), depressed mood (17), anxiety (13), insomnia (10), and akathisia (9). Parkinsonism and dysphagia scores were significantly increased at week 80 compared to baseline. At week 80, chorea had significantly improved from baseline with a mean reduction in the TMC score of 4. 6 (SD 5. 5) units. The mean dosage at week 80 was 63. 4 mg (range 12. 5 - 175 mg). Conclusions TBZ effectively suppresses HD-related chorea for up to 80 weeks. Patients treated chronically with TBZ should be monitored for parkinsonism, dysphagia and other side effects including sleep disturbance, depression, anxiety, and akathisia.

Twelve healthy subjects (6 male and 6 female) were exposed to a 15 -min virtual ride on a rollercoaster on two different days in a counterbalanced manner, such half of participants were facing forward during the first ride while another half was facing backward. Forehead skin conductance, heart rate and HRV parameters (SDRR, RMSSD) were collected as objective measures; subjective symptoms were assessed with the Motion Sickness Assessment Questioner immediately after exposure. We found that while nausea ratings at which <b>participants</b> <b>terminated</b> the experiment did not differ between forward/backward rides, the mean ride tolerance time was significantly longer during reverse ride compared to forward ride (6. 1 ± 0. 4 vs 5. 0 ± 0. 5 min, respectively, p = 0. 01, η 2 = 0. 45). Analysis of HRV parameters revealed significant reduction in both RMSSD (p = 0. 02, t = 2. 62, η 2 = 0. 43) and SDRR (p = 0. 01, t = 2. 90, η 2 = 0. 45) in the forward ride; no such changes were found in the backward ride. We also found that amplitude of phasic changes in forehead skin conductance increased significantly in both ride directions. This increase however was significantly lower (p< 0. 05) in backward ride when compared to the forward ride. When assessed immediately post-ride, subjects reported significantly lower (p = 0. 04) subjective symptom intensity after the reverse ride compared to the forward ride.

DesignRandomized placebo-controlled trial. SettingAcute and subacute geriatrics units, speech therapists' clinic, and nursing home. ParticipantsOlder patients on tube-feeding for > 2  weeks because of dysphagia secondary to cerebrovascular diseases. InterventionParticipants were randomized to lisinopril 2. 5  mg or placebo once daily for 26  weeks. MeasurementsParticipants were followed up at weeks 12 and 26. The primary outcome was the incidence rate of pneumonia as determined by pneumonic changes on x-ray and clinical criteria. The secondary outcomes were mortality rate and swallowing ability as defined by the Royal Brisbane Hospital Outcome Measure for Swallowing at week  12. ResultsA total of 93 older patients were randomized. In interim analysis, 71 completed the trial, whereas 15 had dropped out. Among those who had completed the trial, odds ratio (OR) for death was significantly higher in the intervention group (unadjusted OR 2. 94, P = . 030; fully adjusted OR 7. 79, P = . 018). There was no difference in the incidence of pneumonia or fatal pneumonia in the 2 groups.

40|$|Active {{labour market}} policy {{under the terms}} of Volume III of the German Social Code is being subsidized by the European Social Fund within the scope of the 'ESF-BA programme' from 2000 until 2008. First of all, {{participation}} in vocational training schemes is facilitated by ESF subsistence allowances paid to unemployed persons who are not entitled to subsistence benefits by law. Furthermore, occupation-oriented training schemes were offered as supplementary ESF modules within the programme, which were not eligible according to the German Social Code Volume III. One main focus of research conducted by the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) in parallel with the ESF-BA programme is the evaluation of measures to promote vocational training funded by the ESF in comparison to existing statutory promotion schemes (evidence of 'added value') and the 'counterfactual' non-participation in measures. The main benchmark for evaluating ESF-funded training schemes is employability, the impact of which is analyzed by comparing participants in measures with groups of non-participants with similar characteristics. The evaluation is empirically based on the administrative process-generated data of the Federal Employment Agency and a national representative survey of participants in measures funded by the ESF from 2000 to 2002 and comparison groups (participants without ESF-funding and unemployed non-participants). Both the heterogeneity of participant groups funded by the ESF and of schemes conducted in East and West Germany is demonstrated with a descriptive analysis of the survey data. Multivariate analyses of the transition from ESF-funded vocational training to subsequent employment verify that the structural mismatch on the labour market, which particularly affects priority groups targeted by the ESF, cannot be balanced by occupational training schemes. Impact analyses of comparison groups are based on process-generated and survey data selected by the method of sequential matching. The share of participants who continue to work in 'non-funded employment liable to social security' as well as 'funded and non-funded employment including funded self-employment' after completing the programme is analyzed to indicate the performance of ESF-funded training schemes. Finally, it is investigated whether registered unemployment is likely to be <b>terminated</b> faster by <b>participants</b> in measures.

40|$|Thesis (MSc (Research Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013 The {{termination}} of pregnancies is increasing worldwide and {{is associated with}} profound physical and emotional changes, {{but at the same}} time support in the form of pre- and post-counselling, especially in the South African context, does not always take place. Many women are thus reliant on themselves to deal with the trauma without receiving professional help in order to cope. Coping refers to efforts to manage claims made on the individual and which are viewed as a demand that exceeds the resources of the person. Coping is increasingly seen as a form of self-regulation, indicating the ability to conduct, direct and monitor a flexible plan of behaviour, depending on changing circumstances. A self-regulating perspective on coping can be very valuable to understand how appropriate adjustments are made in response to the discrepancy between stated goals and actual behaviour. In spite of this, there is lack of available research data in relation to the {{termination of}} pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to explore coping strategies relating to the termination of pregnancy from a self-regulating perspective. An exploratory qualitative case study research design was used, comprising in-depth interviews with a convenience sample of two young women and who had chosen to terminate their pregnancies. Both <b>participants</b> <b>terminated</b> their unplanned pregnancies by means of vacuum aspiration within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, without any post-abortion counselling. Both indicated that they were not yet ready to have children and that they would have been unable financially to care for the children. The interviews began with an open-ended question to get a general idea of the participants’ views on the termination of pregnancy, to establish how they coped with it, and to obtain insight into their subjective experience. Then, by using more structured questions, the focus shifted to their coping, specifically as a form of self-regulation. Thematic content analysis of the data was done independently by the researcher and a second experienced qualitative researcher. Results show that coping with the termination of a pregnancy is an extremely difficult process that is emotionally difficult to handle, and that both participants coped through social, emotional, cognitive and problem focused strategies, as well as by managing goals. In addition to this, one participant also made use of religion as a source to be able to cope. Particularly significant was the realisation that a self- regulating perspective contributed to the observation that there were clear differences in how these strategies were applied in the unique context of each case. It is shown that the way in which social support and interpersonal conflict is regulated, plays an important role in the coping process, especially because, in this study, it could be distinguished in terms of how the participants made cognitive and problem focused adjustments. Furthermore, it is indicated that both sometimes suppressed their emotions and at other times expressed them appropriately within the context of the stressor. The value of faith as an internal source, as well as the ability to create a synthesis between assimilation and accommodation, became apparent in one participant, and supports research in this regard. The conclusion is eached that a self-regulating perspective adds value to the understanding of coping with the termination of pregnancy, especially because it emphasises how coping is essentially a self-regulatory process, and not just a one- dimensional implementation strategy. Finally, some gaps were identified and recommendations made for further research. Master...|$|R
