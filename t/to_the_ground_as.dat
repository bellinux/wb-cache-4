5|$|A judge banned all filming {{but this}} ruling was {{overturned}} by an injunction. Although officials were angry, the residents were not and Jackson {{was surrounded by}} crowds of enthusiastic onlookers during filming. One woman managed to push through security to hug Jackson who continued dancing while hugging her. Another woman appeared and hugged him from behind. He then fell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>as</b> police pulled the two women off him and escorted them away. After the director helped Jackson get up off the street, he continued to sing and dance. This incident {{made it into the}} music video. 1,500 policemen and 50 residents acting as security guards effectively sealed off the Dona Marta favela. Some residents and officials found it offensive that Jackson's production team had negotiated with drug dealers in order to gain permission to film in one of the city's shantytowns.|$|E

5|$|As {{they enter}} the room, the man stands up and holds the briefcase. During the third chorus, they engage in battle and {{circulate}} the room for defence. Inter cut scenes have the group dancing to the song in the room. Perfume member Kashiyuka summons a mini version of herself, holding onto it, and casting a spell against the man, making him fall <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>As</b> they celebrate, Perfume member Nocchi goes towards him and retrieves the briefcase. However, the man stands up and transforms into a polar bear; he then pushes Nocchi to the ground. Perfume member A-Chan throws an apple as a detraction, and the group attacks the bear by using laser beams. Defeated, the polar bear shrinks and transforms into a plush toy. A-Chan picks up the plush toy, and Kashiyuka opens the briefcase to witness a small gold ornament. The video ends with the group exiting the office.|$|E
5|$|Australian ravens begin {{breeding}} {{once they}} are three years old. Breeding season is from July to September, with no substantial difference in timing across its range around the country despite it inhabiting a range of diverse climates and habitats across 19 degrees of latitude. Rowley has pointed out this is unusual for a bird species {{with a wide range}} and has postulated that breeding is initiated by day length. Rarely, breeding can take place in May, June or October. Australian ravens generally nest in tall trees, never near <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>as</b> some species do. The nest also functions as a lookout post and so tall or emergent trees are selected. The ravens occasionally nest on buildings, telegraph poles, or tall windmills which allow the species to occupy areas lacking in tall trees. Windmills may have assisted the spread of the species in North Queensland and the Northern Territory. The highest recorded corvid nest in Australia was found atop the AWA Tower in Sydney.|$|E
5|$|In 335 BC, Alexander {{fought against}} the Thracian tribe of the Triballi at Haemus Mons and along the Danube, forcing their {{surrender}} on Peuce Island. Shortly thereafter, the Illyrian king Cleitus of the Dardani threatened to attack Macedonia, but Alexander took the initiative and besieged the Dardani at Pelion (in modern Albania). When Thebes had once again revolted from the League of Corinth and was besieging the Macedonian garrison in the Cadmea, Alexander left the Illyrian front and marched to Thebes, which he placed under siege. After breaching the walls, Alexander's forces killed 6,000 Thebans, took 30,000 inhabitants as prisoners of war, and burned the city <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>as</b> a warning that convinced all other Greek states except Sparta not to challenge Alexander again.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} move, Rowe formed {{a new group}} under Herbert Skinner to develop the {{magnetron}} into an AI system, at that time known as AI, Sentimetric (AIS). Lovell adapted his parabolic antennas to the magnetron with relative ease, and the AIS team immediately detected a passing aircraft when they turned on the set {{for the first time}} on 12 August 1940. The next day they were asked to demonstrate the set for managers, but no airplane happened to be flying by. Instead, they had one of the workers bicycle along a nearby cliff carrying a small plate of aluminum sheet. This neatly demonstrated its ability to detect objects very close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>As</b> AIS rapidly developed into the AI Mk. VII, development of the Mk. IV's follow-ons, the Mk. V, and Mk. VI (see below) saw vacillating support.|$|E
5|$|Squads {{from the}} larger group broke off and moved up the hill toward coal pit number three. One squad took up a {{position}} at the pit number three coal shed; another, at the pump house. A warning party was sent ahead of the squads into Chinatown. They warned the Chinese they had one hour {{to pack up and}} leave town. After only 30 minutes, the first gunshots were fired by the squad at the pump house, followed by a volley from those at the coal shed. Lor Sun Kit, a Chinese laborer, was shot and fell <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>As</b> the group at coal pit number three rejoined them, the crowd pressed on toward Chinatown, some men firing their weapons as they went. The smaller group of white miners at the plank bridge divided itself into squads and surrounded Chinatown. One squad stayed at the plank bridge to cut off any Chinese escape.|$|E

5|$|The {{brain was}} {{slightly}} sigmoidal (S-shaped), without much {{expansion of the}} cerebral hemispheres, more like a crocodile than a bird. This {{is in keeping with}} the overall conservatism of non-coelurosaurian theropod brains. Acrocanthosaurus had large and bulbous olfactory bulbs, indicating a good sense of smell. Reconstructing the semicircular canals of the ear, which control balance, shows that the head was held at a 25° angle below horizontal.

5|$|To {{perform a}} bicycle kick, the ball must be {{airborne}} {{so that the}} player can hit it while doing a backflip; the ball can either come in the air towards the player, such as from a cross, or the player can flick the ball up into the air. The non-kicking leg should rise first to help propel the body up while the kicking leg makes the jump. While making the leap, the body's back should move rearwards until it is parallel <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>As</b> the body reaches peak height, the kicking leg should snap toward the ball as the non-kicking leg is simultaneously brought down to increase the kick's power. Vision should stay focused on the ball until the foot strikes it. The arms {{should be used for}} balance and to diminish the impact from the fall.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the castle}} of the Grail, Amfortas is {{brought before the}} Grail shrine and Titurel's coffin.

The Knights of the Grail passionately urge Amfortas to uncover the Grail again but Amfortas, in a frenzy, says he will never again show the Grail. He {{commands}} the Knights, instead, to kill him and end his suffering and the shame he has brought on the Knighthood. At this moment, Parsifal steps forth and says that only one weapon can heal the wound (""). He touches Amfortas' side with the Spear and both heals and absolves him. Parsifal commands the unveiling of the Grail.

5|$|Early on the {{afternoon}} of Thursday, March1, at 1:08pm CST (19:08 UTC), a destructive tornado first developed near the Enterprise Municipal Airport. The tornado lifted off the ground briefly before returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>as</b> an even stronger storm. It quickly slammed into Enterprise, Alabama, at 1:12pm CST (19:12 UTC). The tornado left severe damage throughout a large section of the city. The most severe damage took place at Enterprise High School, where a section of the school was destroyed {{during the middle of the}} school day. Eight students were killed at the school and 50 other people were taken to local hospitals. Some early reports suggested that there had been as many as 15 deaths at Enterprise High School and 18 deaths statewide, which was found to be an over-estimation. It was the first killer tornado at a US school since the Grand Isle, Louisiana tornado in 1993, and the deadliest tornado-related school disaster since one in Belvidere, Illinois in 1967. One other death was reported in Enterprise at a nearby private residence when a woman's living room window was shattered by the tornado.|$|E
