50|$|The {{principle}} {{parts of}} a MORGOIL Bearing are relatively uncomplicated. The Sleeve is an alloy steel forging, heat-treated and ground to a fine finish. The Sleeve has a precision non-locking tapered bore, which fits on, and is keyed to, the <b>tapered</b> <b>Roll</b> Neck, thus becoming the bearing journal. Surrounding the Sleeve is the Bushing, fixed in the Chock, which carries the radial load. The precision Sleeve rotating in the bushing on an unbroken film of oil provides a Bearing with a low coefficient of friction, low power consumption, high load capacity, high stiffness, and freedom from wear and fatigue. Adjacent to the outbound end of the sleeve is the Thrust Bearing, which is typically a double acting roller (or ball bearing in some applications {{depending on the size}} of the radial bearing). The Thrust Bearing is mounted in such a manner that it only carries the thrust load and is not subject to any radial loading.|$|E

40|$|Rolling {{of sticks}} and pipes in multirolled calibers is very {{perspective}} {{owing to the}} profitable state of stress scheme and possibility of large stretches obtaining. While slight widening large stretches contribute to longitudinal texture creation in sticks and pipes, which are succeeded to recrystallization texture after hot deformation. Texture of metalwares, made of complex alloyed steel and alloys, creates mechanical anisotropy. Substitution of longitudinal sharp-texture for screw texture enhances impact resistance and long-term strength of sticks and pipes made of refractory steel and alloys. The present article describes and analyses means of torsion and numerically estimate torsion size of stripes, rolled in 4 -rolls calibers of <b>tapered</b> <b>rolls.</b> This new rolling method in section and reducing mills allows to create screw texture and enhance strength characteristics of sticks and pipes in tangential direction and totally dispose split of metalwares at heat treatment. Owing to 4 -rolls calibers of <b>tapered</b> <b>rolls,</b> rolling according to circle-circle system is realized without overfill at relatively large reduction. At pipe rolling in round calibers without eccentricity nonuniform pipe wall thickness reduced without fixture is totally removed...|$|R

Four to eight progressively finer abrasive stones are used to superfinish the workpiece. The stones contact the workpiece at a 90° angle and are oscillated axially. Examples of parts that would be produced by process include <b>tapered</b> <b>rolls,</b> piston pins, shock absorber rods, shafts, and needles.|$|R

The shaft is formed by skew rolling using three <b>tapered</b> <b>rolls.</b> The principle of this forming process was discussed stressing its universality {{due to the}} potential of applying it for forming various products by one set of rolls. The numerical analysis results (product shape progression in rolling, wall thickness distribution, effective strain, temperature and variations in loads and torques) confirm that the proposed technique {{can be used for}} producing hollow long shafts...|$|R

First, the design of this forming technique is described. Then the paper stresses the universality of this process, as the skew rolling technique enables forming various products using one set of rolls.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a new method for forming a crankshaft preform. The method {{is based on}} the skew rolling technique. With this method the part is formed by three <b>tapered</b> <b>rolls</b> rotated with the same velocity and in the same direction. Simultaneously, the rolls either converge or diverge depending on the desired cross section of the product. The numerical modeling enabled determination of the distributions of effective strains, temperatures, and damage function according to the Cockroft - Latham criterion, aswell as variations in the loads and torques during rolling. The results confirm that a crankshaft preform can be formed by the proposed skew rolling method...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a new method for producing stepped rail axles. The method {{is based on}} the skew rolling process. With this method, the product is formed by three <b>tapered</b> <b>rolls</b> located every 120 ° on the perimeter of the billet. Positioned askew to the centerline of the billet, the rolls rotate in the same direction and with the same velocity. At the same time, they get closer together or go apart depending on the desired cross sectional reduction of an axle step. In addition, the workpiece is shifted lengthwise relative to the rolls by the translational motion of the workpiece-holding chuck. In order to verify the designed method for producing rail axles, a series of numerical simulations were performed using the Simufact. Forming v. 12 simulation software. The numerical modeling enabled the determination of maps of the effective strain and temperature in the finished product as well as variations in the loads and torques during rolling. The numerical results unambiguously confirm that the skew rolling method can be applied to form parts of considerable dimensions (the modeled axles had a length of 2146 mm and their maximum diameter was 202 mm) ...|$|R

This paper for the first time proposed the self-centering ability of <b>tapered</b> hearth <b>roll</b> on initial flatness of strip travelling in the furnace and a FEM model that coupling the strip and furnace roll is constructed to simulate the traveling process of strip in the furnace. The self-centering ability is quite different with respect to the different initial flatness waves of strip traveling in the furnace and can be used for optimization of initial flatness of strip for stability improvement...|$|R
50|$|The {{evolution}} to {{the current}} 20-High Cluster Sendzimir Mill from the early 12-High configuration was pioneered by Tadeusz Sendzimir in the early 1930s. The designs for the Sendzimir Mill were perfected and patented by Tadeusz's company T. Sendzimir, Inc. Significant design improvements were made by T. Sendzimir, Inc. including the flexible shaft backing assemblies and segmented idler rolls, as well as <b>tapered</b> edge intermediate <b>rolls</b> with lateral adjust for superior shape control. With advent of Finite Element Analysis technology T. Sendzimir, Inc. iterated the mono-block housing design to create the Zero Crown Housing solution. This reduced the amount of material required for the housing, while creating uniform elastic deformation across the housing during rolling {{in order to maintain}} a better shape profile of the strip.|$|R
40|$|Bimetallic {{castings}} {{are widely}} used in the mining industries as construction material for crushers which have to perform high abrasive resistance at the outer side and excellent machinability at the inner side. To manufacture bimetallic casting goods cconsecutive centrifugal and gravity casting methods are commonly applied. Centrifugal and consecutive casting come up with geometrical constraints at the parting line of both materials. This research dealed with the manufacturing of <b>tapered</b> grinding <b>roll</b> by applying gravity casting method. The possibilities of casting the white cast iron outer ring in the preheated ductile cast iron of the inner ring were investigated. The inner ring was first heated up by casting liquid metal around the inner side, which prevented the inner ring from cracking due to rapid expansion during the casting process and to provide adequyate shrinkage of inner ring during solidification. After achieving the desired temperature of the inner ring, the liquid metal of white cast iron was then poured into the cavity to form the outer ring. The preheating temperature of the inner ring was mainly derived from the linear thermal expansion of both quasi isotrophic material and the diffusion at the parting line. This preheating temperature has to facilitate the formation of metallurgical bonding and avoid cracks due to the difference of shrinkage value between inner and outer ring. The preheating temperature {{was set up in}} the range of 500 °C - 1000 °C and the flushing time was fixed for 7 seconds. Studies on the microstructure of sample material have revealed a formation of metallurgical bonding at all of the preheating temperature. The width of the diffusion at the interface area varied between 291 µm at 500 oC preheating temperature, 301 µm at 625 oC, 834, 8 µm at 750 °C, 909, 1 µm at 875 °C and 1027, 7 µm at 1000 °C. By preheating temperature of higher than 750 °C fusion occured at the interface area between inner and outer material. This research concludes that the casting of bimetallic by applying gravity casting method can be done by preheating the inner ring to 625 oC, interface temperature of 1150 oC, flushing time of 7 seconds and pouring the white cast iron outer ring at the temperature of 1430 o...|$|R
