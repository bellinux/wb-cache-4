Combining the {{advantages}} of lumped elements – low spurious problem and predictable response – with multilayer low-temperature co-fired ceramic technology, circuit layouts can be integrated vertically to realize a miniaturized rat-race coupler. The proposed coupler uses high-pass and low-pass lumped models to replace the <b>transmission</b> line <b>sections</b> of the conventional design. A new structure with enhanced bandwidth is achieved by increasing {{the order of the}} 270 ° <b>transmission</b> line <b>section.</b> Measurement results are shown to validate the design and theoretical prediction, demonstrating 98. 63 % area reduction compared to conventional rat-race coupler and a 50 % fractional bandwidth.
