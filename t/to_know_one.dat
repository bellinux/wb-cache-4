5|$|Accepting {{the offer}} on January 19, 2009, Ryan {{immediately}} began {{to carry out a}} plan of action that he had outlined for the franchise's future. He planned to remove the players from distractions {{on and off the field}} and allow them get <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>one</b> another to build team chemistry. Thus, training camp was moved to the campus of SUNY Cortland, where the team would be relatively secluded from the media and any other distractions. Ryan and general manager Mike Tannenbaum were also determined to draft a quarterback who could lead and be the face of the franchise. As a result, the team traded up to select Mark Sanchez of USC in the first round with the fifth overall pick in the 2009 NFL Draft.|$|E

It is uncertain {{when they first}} met, and there are varying accounts of how they came <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>one</b> another. Journalist Michael Azerrad states that the two met in 1989 at the Satyricon nightclub in Portland, Oregon, though Cobain biographer Charles Cross has claimed the date was actually February 12, 1990, and that Cobain playfully wrestled Love to the floor after she commented to him in passing that he looked like Dave Pirner of Soul Asylum. According to Love, she first met him at a Dharma Bums show in Portland, while Love's bandmate Eric Erlandson stated that both he and Love were formally introduced to Cobain {{in a parking lot}} after a Butthole Surfers concert at the Hollywood Palladium on May 17, 1991. Sometime in late 1991, Love and Cobain became reacquainted through Jennifer Finch, one of Love's longtime friends and former bandmates.|$|E
40|$|Abstract) The diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{reflection}} of the right <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>one's</b> own origin in the Czech legal order. Knowledge of one's own origin and the right <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>one's</b> own origin constitute not only a legal but also a moral and ethical question. The right <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>one's</b> own origin (i. e. the right <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>one's</b> parents, one's biological family and one's ancestors) is one of the subjective human rights, which belongs to every natural person. This right is more or less reflected in majority of institutes of family law. The thesis analyses the most important of them and indicates how the right <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>one's</b> own origin is reflected in these institutes or it is not, although it should be. The work seeks to highlight possible shortcomings of the legislation and tries to propose possible solutions de lege ferenda. There are also stated (for the purposes of comparison) some examples of foreign legislation in cases of some legal institutes. The diploma thesis is based on the legislation effective on the 26 th March 2016. It is composed of an introduction, five chapters and a conclusion. The first chapter {{deals with the}} right <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>one's</b> own origin and its legal regulation in the Czech Republic. It mainly discusses the international conventions that are (in compliance with the Art. 10 of the [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract, Keywords The thesis {{concerns}} {{itself with}} the analysis of Czech legislation currently in effect {{with respect to the}} right <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>one's</b> origin. Discussed are the contents of this right, the legislation's addressees, Article 7 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child including the reservations to it made by the Czech Republic. The affected Czech regulations and their reforms are also talked about. Attention is also given to the issue of determining one's parentage. The bulk of the thesis is made up of analyzing the issues of assisted reproduction, surrogacy, adoption, anonymized and confidential childbirths, and baby boxes in regard to protecting the right <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>one's</b> origin. The thesis aims to critically evaluate current legislation, point out its shortcomings and suggest possible future development as the right <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>one's</b> origin isn't currently being given enough attention. Some of the aforementioned institutes aren't set out in law at all, others give preference to the anonymity of the child's biological parents. Adoption has recently seen some positive development with the recodification of the civil law, however even this is an area that leaves a lot to be desired as there still are certain faults and deficiencies of the legislation.

25|$|Watchung, in the 1900s was a semi-rural small {{community}} of about 3,200 people {{in comparison with}} the relatively larger and more urban communities of Plainfield and Somerville. The first mayor of the town was Henry Baldwin Macdonald, who served from 1926 to 1928. Even as late as the 1960s, it was common for residents <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>one</b> another by name, with few moving in or out of the town. The 1967 Plainfield riots, however, caused an exodus of the large upper-middle class population from the nearby cities to the Watchung Hills area to communities such as Watchung, Warren Township and Bridgewater Township.|$|E

500|$|The film (and {{subsequent}} novel) were memoirs {{written by}} Herman Raucher; they detailed {{the events in}} his life {{over the course of}} the summer he spent on Nantucket Island in 1942 when he was fourteen years old.

Seltzer was shot dead on a battlefield in Korea whilst attending to a wounded man; this happened on Raucher's birthday, and consequently, Raucher has not celebrated a birthday since. During the course of writing the screenplay, Raucher came to the realization that despite growing up with Oscy and having bonded with him through their formative years, the two had never really had any meaningful conversations or gotten <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>one</b> another on a more personal level.|$|E
