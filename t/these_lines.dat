5|$|Along <b>these</b> <b>lines,</b> some {{academics}} {{link the}} Gawain pentangle to magical traditions. In Germany, the symbol {{was called a}} Drudenfuß and was placed on household objects to keep out evil. The symbol was also associated with magical charms that, if recited or written on a weapon, would call forth magical forces. However, concrete evidence tying the magical pentagram to Gawain's pentangle is scarce.|$|E

5|$|From {{the bone}} {{features}} of the holotype OMNH 10146 and NCSM 14345, {{it is estimated that}} Acrocanthosaurus requires at least 12 years to fully grow. This number may be much higher because in the process of bones remodeling and the growth of the medullary cavity, some Harris lines were lost. If accounting for <b>these</b> <b>lines,</b> Acrocanthosaurus needs 18–24 years to be mature.|$|E
5|$|The Bendigo {{line was}} {{completed}} in 1862, with extensions were opened to Echuca in 1864, and Swan Hill in 1890, followed {{by a number of}} lines throughout the north-west corner of the state.

5|$|After quickly {{growing into}} a city, Omaha failed to pave its streets accordingly. A chaotic {{transportation}} system was highlighted by several miles of successful horsecar tracks; however, the city only ever had four miles (6km) of cable car service. Several early suburbs were built on reliance of service from <b>these</b> <b>lines,</b> including Dundee, Benson and Kountze Place. In the early 1880s an extensive boulevard system {{was built to}} create a park-like atmosphere for drivers throughout the city.

5|$|For {{lines with}} three or four tracks with express service, local stops will have side {{platforms}} and the middle one or two tracks will not stop at the station. On <b>these</b> <b>lines,</b> express stations typically have two island platforms, one for the local and express in one direction, and another for the local and express in the other direction. Each island platform provides a cross-platform interchange between local and express services. Some lines with four-track express service have two tracks each on two levels and use both island and side platforms.|$|E
