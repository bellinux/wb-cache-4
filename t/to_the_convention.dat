In 1892, Oregon received a second congressional district, and Tongue served as the Republican party's chairman for the district until 1896.

50|$|In Article 19 of Part 5, {{the process}} of denouncing <b>the</b> <b>Convention</b> is laid out.

5|$|As Nixon {{prepared}} for the August 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, he discussed possible running mates with his staff. Among these were Ronald Reagan, the conservative Governor of California, and the more liberal Mayor of New York City, John Lindsay. Nixon felt that these high-profile names could split the party, and looked for a less divisive figure. He did not indicate a preferred choice, and Agnew's name was not raised at this stage. Agnew was intending to go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>convention</b> with his Maryland delegation as a favorite son, uncommitted {{to any of the}} main candidates.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{favorable}} position {{toward the}} proposed federal constitution, Marshall {{was chosen as}} a delegate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>convention</b> from Fayette County. On June 25, 1788, he joined Jefferson County delegates Robert Breckinridge and Rice Bullock in voting for ratification. Ten other Kentucky delegates opposed ratification and one abstained.

It was reported that even the Jefferson County delegates were beginning to waver in {{their commitment to the}} proposed constitution, but that Marshall steeled their resolve and also influenced several delegates from other parts of Virginia to favor it.|$|E
5|$|However, Conway relaxed this stance with Anthrocon's move to Pittsburgh in 2006. While no television, {{magazine}} or tabloid representatives were present, several newspapers {{were invited to}} attend, and did, including the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and the Pittsburgh City Paper, which printed both a preview and an extensive review. When local television station KDKA-TV showed up, Conway gave a short television interview outside the convention hotel. In November 2006 he gave a radio interview to Dublin's 98FM. Anthrocon still retains tight control over media access, not only <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>convention</b> grounds but to the membership, and has official policy that forbids unmonitored dealings with unauthorized members of the media.|$|E
5|$|In 1850, the {{sectional}} {{differences that}} eventually {{culminated in the}} Civil War led to a convention {{to be held in}} Nashville, Tennessee, for the purpose of defining a common course of action for all Southern (slave-holding) states. Although Mallory had held no statewide offices, he was regarded as sufficiently powerful in the state Democratic Party to be chosen as an alternate delegate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>convention.</b> Personal considerations kept him from attending, but he expressed his agreement with the purposes of the convention in a letter that was widely reprinted in the Florida newspapers.|$|E

5|$|Many state {{conventions}} elected delegates {{pledged to}} support bimetallism {{in the party}} platform.

Cleveland issued a statement urging Democratic voters to support gold—the next convention to be held, in Illinois, unanimously supported silver; the keynote speaker prayed for divine forgiveness for Cleveland's 1892 nomination. Gold and silver factions in some states, such as Bryan's Nebraska, sent rival delegations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>convention.</b>|$|E
