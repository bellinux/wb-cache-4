5000|$|The World of Paul Slickey (1959) is a play by John Osborne. It was Osborne's only {{attempt to}} write a musical, {{intended}} as a social satire on high-society gossip columnists. After <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> <b>successes</b> of Osborne's previous plays Look Back in Anger and The Entertainer, the play was to become [...] "one {{of the most spectacular}} disasters in English theatre".|$|E
5000|$|Writers of {{the past}} few years tend to ignore <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> <b>successes</b> of the Mustang II and point out flaws as {{evaluated}} by today's standards. Opinions include noting in 2003 that [...] "if there were any steps forward in technology with the Pinto chassis, it was that it had a rack-and-pinion steering gear rather than the Falcon's recirculating ball, and front disc brakes were standard," [...] Edmunds Inside Line wrote of the Mustang II: [...] "It was too small, underpowered, handled poorly, terribly put together, ill-proportioned, chintzy in its details and altogether subpar.|$|E

He said that the game needed to be released {{before the end of}} the year [...] "in order to achieve what we have to do", also stating that he wanted an initial release around November 2012. The game will be running on a branch of the Take On Helicopters engine (part of the Real Virtuality engine), and the main areas of developmental focus were to be [...] "critical issues", such as bug fixing, hacking, and security.|$|E

40|$|Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart {{collaborated on}} over 40 shows before Hart’s death, {{contributing}} dozens of classic hits to the Great American Songbook. We’ll Have Manhattan {{focuses on the}} early, formative period of the Rodgers & Hart collaboration, before <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> <b>successes</b> of the 1930 s. From 1919, when they first met, until their brief flirtation with Hollywood in the early thirties, their output was prodigious, progressive and experimental. It is during this period that they developed their own characteristic style and an approach to writing for the musical stage that would be fundamental {{to the development of}} the Broadway musical. Despite this, despite the many celebrated songs of the period, and despite the many Broadway and West End successes they enjoyed, the 1920 s shows remain little known, and several important archives of their work remain little explored. Not just a historical study of their first collaborative years, this book also offers an accessible but authoritative study of their material, documenting the early shows and providing a critical and analytical commentary on their developing practice and its influence on the subsequent development of the American musical...|$|E
40|$|The broad {{progress}} in QCD studies {{during the last}} years is summarised. 1 QCD evidence: The last 24 years Next year’s Rencontre de Moriond can celebrate the 25 th anniversary of the direct observation of the gluon. With this discovery in e + e − collisons at DESY 1 in 1979 QCD became the accepted theory of strong interaction and boosted the confidence in the Standard Model. Twenty- four years later the status of QCD is excellent. The only free parameter αs is measured {{in a lot of}} observables and different kinds of reactions yielding consistent values and an overall precision of 2 - 3 %. As a function of Q 2 the strong coupling exhibits the expected strong energy variation, the most apparent evidence for quantum corrections in gauge theories. Also the gluon self coupling has been directly observed and found to agree with theory. The {{progress in}} understanding QCD {{over the last two decades}} is expressed in the shrinking uncertainty of αs(Z 0) as shown in Fig. 1. Whereas before LEP it was not known to better than 20 %, during the last 10 years the uncertainty was reduced by an order of magnitude. Having praised <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> <b>successes,</b> let us turn to the basic limitation of QCD tests: the beautifully displayed running of αs, meaning a large value at low Q 2, causes it its precision to be limited to ’some percent’. Theoretical uncertainties and experimental signatures are far more complicated than those for electroweak processes. The precision on αs is some factor 200 below the one for the weak coupling, not to speak of αem. Both progress and difficulties are reflected in the main directions in experimental QCD: 1. Fix the one free parameter αs(Z 0). α...|$|E
