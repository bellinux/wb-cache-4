40|$|A {{neural network}} based {{technique}} is introduced which hides the control latency of reconfigurable interconnection networks (INs) in shared memory multiprocessors. Such INs require complex control mechanisms to reconfigure <b>the</b> <b>IN</b> <b>on</b> demand, {{in order to}} satisfy processor-memory accesses. Hiding the control latency seen by each access improves multiprocessor performance significantly. The new technique hides control latency by employing a time-delay neural network (TDNN) as a prediction technique that learns the current processor-memory access patterns and predicts the need to reconfigure the IN. Training and prediction of the TDNN is performed on-line. Based on three experiments, the TDNN is able to learn repetitive patterns and predict the need to reconfigure the IN thus, effectively hiding control latency of processor-memory accesses. ...|$|E

40|$|The long {{terminal}} repeats (LTRs) that flank the retroviral DNA genome play {{a distinct}} {{role in the}} integration process by acting as specific substrates for the integrase (IN). The role of LTR sequences in providing substrate recognition and specificity to integration reactions was investigated for INs from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1), Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV), human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV- 1), and human T-cell leukemia virus type 2 (HTLV- 2). Overall, these INs required specific LTR sequences for optimal catalysis of 3 '-processing reactions, as opposed to strand transfer and disintegration reactions. It is of particular note that in strand transfer reactions the sites of integration were similar among the four INs. In the 3 '-processing reaction, sequence specificity for each IN was traced to the three nucleotides proximal to the conserved CA. Reactions catalyzed by M-MuLV IN were additionally influenced by upstream regions. The nucleotide requirements for optimal catalysis differed for each IN. HIV- 1 IN showed {{a broad range of}} substrate specificities, while HTLV- 1 IN and HTLV- 2 IN had more defined sequence requirements. M-MuLV IN exhibited greater activity with the heterologous LTR substrates than with its own wild-type substrate. This finding was further substantiated by the high levels of activity catalyzed by <b>the</b> <b>IN</b> <b>on</b> modified M-MuLV LTRs. This work suggests that unlike the other INs examined, M-MuLV IN has evolved with an IN-LTR interaction that is suboptimal...|$|E
40|$|The systems studied involve {{deposition}} of metals {{of a larger}} atomic diameter on a Cu 100 single crystal surface under vacuum and determining the structures formed along with {{the effect on the}} Cu 100 substrate. Cu microelectrodes were fabricated and characterised with Indium electrodeposited on the electrode surface. <b>The</b> <b>In</b> <b>on</b> Cu 100 growth mode is compared with the growth mode of electrodeposited Indium on Cu microelectrodes. The Cu 100 /In system has been studied for the In coverage range 0. 1 - 0. 65 monolayer using Auger electron spectroscopy (AES), low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM). The Auger signal versus deposition time plot for the {{deposition of}} In on Cu 100 is characteristic of the Stranski-Krastanov growth mode. In this deposition mechanism the first atomic layer grows in a layer by layer fashion but when monolayer point is reached, subsequent growth occurs in the form of 3 D crystallites. At a concentration of 0. 4 ± 0. 05 monolayer In forms a (9 V 2 x 2 a / 2) R 4 5 ° on the Cu 100 surface which on heating above a temperature of 373 K undergoes a reproducible phase transition to form a c(2 x 2) phase. Increasing the In deposited to a surface concentration of 0. 6 ± 0. 05 monolayer results in a Cu 100 -c(4 x 4) -ln overlayer structure which remains uniform with heating. A Tensor LEED analysis was conducted on this structure in conjunction with K. Pussi et al., from which {{it was found that the}} In overlayer consisted of two layers. The In layer closest to bulk comprises a c(2 x 2) structure with In atoms occupying 4 fold hollow sites with respect to substrate. The top layer is a c(4 x 4) In layer in which the atoms lie at four fold hollow sites with respect to the c(2 x 2) layer. The deposition of 0. 25 ML Sb on clean Cu 100 at room temperature results in a p(2 x 2) LEED pattern which is confirmed by STM. Using Tensor LEED calculations, the structure of the Cu 100 -p(2 x 2) -Sb phase has been determined. The results show that despite the large size mismatch between Sb (atomic radius = 1. 450 A) and Cu (atomic radius = 1. 278 A), a surface alloy is formed in which Sb atoms substitute Cu atoms in the outermost layer. Sb is found to ripple outward from the surface by 0. 56 + 0. 05 A. The second and deeper Cu layers are found to be close to their bulk values. As the Sb coverage is increased to a concentration of 0. 33 ML, the surface exhibits a p(6 x 6) LEED pattern. The atomic resolution STM images for this surface display alternating double and single rows of atoms implying a reconstruction in the selvedge. Based on the STM and LEED results possible models for the Cu 100 - p(6 x 6) -Sb structure have been proposed. The favoured structures are based on a slight deformation from the simple c(2 x 2) surface. Cu microelectrodes were fabricated and characterized using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The Cu microelectrodes were found to have a potential window of — 0. 08 to - 0. 6 V in HCIO 4, although this can be improved with pH adjustment, with the potential window found to be at a maximum of + 0. 1 to - 1. 0 V at a pH of 4. Chronoamperometric data was taken in differing concentrations of HCIO 4 giving resistance, capacitance and RC time constant values for the Cu microelectrode in an HCIO 4 electrolyte system. Indium was electrochemically deposited on the Cu microelectrode at a potential of— 0. 6 V. Cyclic voltammograms are taken at different scan rates to determine the dynamics of In deposition. At low scan rates there was an increase in the amount of. In deposited as witnessed by hysteresis on the cyclic voltammograms. This hysteresis is thought to be caused by In on In deposition. Al scan rates of 1. 0 Vs"! and above it is thought that little or no In deposition occurs as peaks corresponding to indium reduction or subsequent oxidation are no longer observed. SEM and EDX were used to confirm the deposition of In on the Cu microelectrodes. Chronoamperometric measurements were taken to determine the growth mode and nucleation type of the deposited In. From these measurements, a plot of I/Imax versus t for the. In deposition is compared with nucleation and growth models for 2 D progressive, 2 D instantaneous, 3 D progressive and 3 D instantaneous. After comparison it was found that the electrodeposition of In on Cu microelectrodes obeys a progressive nucleation mode with further In growth found to be 3 D. This result compares favourably with the growth mode for In deposition on a Cu 100 substrate under vacuum, with the growth mode for both being 3 D. It was found that the nucleation types for both were remarkably similar with vacuum deposited In and electrodeposited indium both undergoing progressive nucleation...|$|E

40|$|Nanotechnology refers any {{technique}} that involves about object with nanoscale (10 {sup - 9 } m) or even smaller. It {{has become more}} and more important in recently years and has changed our world dramatically. Most of modern electronic devices today should thanks to the miniaturizing driven by development of nanotechnology. Recent years, more and more governments are investing huge amount of money in research related to nanotechnology. There are two major reasons that nanostructure is so fascinate. The first one is the miniaturizing. It is obvious that if we can make products smaller without losing the features, we can save the cost and increase the performance dramatically. For an example, the first computer in the world, ENIAC, which occupied several rooms, is less powerful than the cheapest calculator today. Today's chips with sizes of less than half an inch contain millions of basic units. All these should thank to the development of nanotechnology. The other reason is that when we come to nanoscale, there are many new effects due to the quantum effect which can't be found in large systems. For an example, quantum dots (QDs) are systems which sizes are below 1 {micro}m(10 {sup - 6 }m) and restricted in three dimensions. There are many interesting quantum effects in QDs, including discrete energy levels, and interdot coupling. Due to these properties and their small sizes, QDs have varies potential applications such as quantum computing, probe, light emitting device, solar cells, and laser. To meet the requirement of the nanoelectrical applications, the QDs must be grown highly uniformly because their property is highly dependent on their sizes. The major methods to grow uniform QDs include epitaxial, and lithograph. Lithography is a process to make patterns on a thin film by selectively removing certain parts of the film. Using this method, people have good control over size, location and spacing of QDs. For an example, the Extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) have a wave length of 13. 4 nm so it can curve on the surface of an sample to make structure as small as the order of 10 nm. however, lithograph usually causes permanent damages to the surface and in many cases the QDs are damaged during the lithograph and therefore result in high percentage of defects. Quantum size effect has attracted more and more interests in surface science due to many of its effects. One of its effects is the height preference in film growing and the resulting possibility of uniformly sized self-assemble nanostructure. The experiment of Pb islands on In 4 x 1 phase shows that both the height and the width can be controlled by proper growth conditions, which expands the growth dimensions from 1 to 2. This discover leads us to study the In/Pb interface. In Ch. 3, we found that the Pb islands growing on In 4 x 1 -Si(111) surface which have uniform height due to QSE and uniform width due to the constriction of In 4 x 1 lattice have unexpected stability. These islands are stable in even RT, unlike usual nanostructures on Pb/Si surface which are stable only at low temperature. Since similar structures are usually grown at low temperature, this discovery makes the grown structures closer to technological applications. It also shows the unusual of In/Pb interface. Then we studied the In islands grown on Pb-{alpha}-{radical} 3 x{radical} 3 -Si(111) phase in Ch. 4. These islands have fcc structure in the first few layers, and then convert to bct structure. The In fcc islands have sharp height preference due to QSE like Pb islands. However, the preferred height is different (7 layer for Pb on Si 7 x 7 and 4 layer for Pb on In 4 x 1), due to the difference of interface. The In islands structure prefers to be bct than fcc with coverage increase. It is quantitatively supported by first-principle calculation. Unexpectedly, the In islands grown on various of In interfaces didn't show QSE effects and phase transition from fcc and bct structures as on the Pb-{alpha} interface (Ch. 6). In g(s) curve there is no clear oscillations in the g(s) curve as <b>the</b> <b>In</b> <b>on</b> Pb-{alpha} phase. This {{may be due to the}} extra mobility of In atoms, which causes the In bct islands to grow too fast to be observed in diffraction or STM (Ch. 5). From these experiments we can see the importance of Pb-? phase in growth of In islands. It is the best interface to grow In islands in the phases we have experimented. Recent experiments show that the Existence of Pb will decrease the diffusion speed of In. In Ch. 6 we have shown that In atoms diffusion is so fast that the bct spots are not visible in diffraction. But when we put some Pb onto the In surface, we can see the bct spots, although very weak. So Pb should play an role in slowing down the indium atoms diffusion. The interaction of Pb and In may play a role, but it is still not fully understood. So the general conclusion of this thesis is that In/Pb interface has extraordinary properties and may have potential in self-assembling growth...|$|E
