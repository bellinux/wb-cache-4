50|$|The Taupin had {{tailskid}} {{landing gear}} with its low pressure mainwheels mounted on V-struts hinged {{from the lower}} longerons and with a single <b>telescopic</b> <b>strut</b> on each side to the mid-upper longerons, though the drawing in L'Aéronatique shows a different, split axle undercarriage.|$|E
5000|$|The airship had a {{tricycle}} undercarriage with a non-steerable nosewheel beneath the central hull and steerable (via {{a connection with}} the rudders) wheels at {{the tips of the}} ventral fins at the aft ends of the outer hulls. The nosewheel functioned as an [...] "internal mooring mast," [...] with a <b>telescopic</b> <b>strut</b> that allowed the ship's angle of attack to be varied while moored (e.g. nose down to hug the ground or nose up in preparation for takeoff) and a tie-down fitting at its lower end.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{conventional}} aircraft, the HM.14 has no ailerons or elevators, and no foot-operated {{flight control}}s. The {{flight control system}} comprises a conventional control stick. Fore-and-aft movement of the stick is transmitted via cables to the rear underside of the main wing, that {{is supported by a}} single pivot at the front underside, mounted on a pylon on the fuselage. Rearward movement of the stick pulls the cables, and increases the pitch and therefore the lift of the main wing. The aircraft will then pitch up, due to the centre of pressure being forward of the center of gravity. Forward stick movement has the reverse effect. Resistance to stick movement is usually an aerodynamic force from the main wing, {{but there is also a}} rubber spring (bungee) pulling down on the leading edge of the wing, and a <b>telescopic</b> <b>strut</b> behind the pilot's head limits the total wing movement. Side-to-side movement of the stick controls the all-moving rudder via cables. In flight, this produces a stable rolling motion, as required in a banked turn, because the wings both have dihedral. That rolling characteristic is not safely available during take-off or landing, so crosswinds are not easily tolerated.|$|E
50|$|SAAZ (СААЗ) (Skopinskiy Avtoagregatniy Zavod, Скопинский Автоагрегатный Завод, SAAZ Complect, СААЗ Комплект) is a Russian factory of {{automotive}} components (<b>telescopic</b> <b>struts,</b> shock absorbers, pneumatic-stops and gas springs). The company {{was established in}} 1962 and is a supplier of products for conveyors of AvtoVAZ, UAZ and others.|$|R
50|$|The wing was braced to {{the lower}} {{fuselage}} on each side with V-struts to the spars and the central-section joined to the upper fuselage on steel cabane struts. The outer panels folded back along the fuselage for storage or transport on outward leaning rear hinges which placed {{the trailing edge of}} the folded wing above that of the centre-section. Short, <b>telescopic</b> <b>struts</b> supported the wings during the folding process.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{design for a}} Stewart {{platform}} (or hexapod), an apparatus which performs positioning tasks with high accuracy. The platform, which is supported by six hydraulic <b>telescopic</b> <b>struts,</b> provides {{six degrees of freedom}} with 1 μm resolution. Rotations about user defined pivot points can be specified for any axis of rotation with microradian accuracy. Motion of the platform is performed by changing the strut lengths. Servo systems set and maintain the length of the struts to high precision using proportional hydraulic valves and incremental encoders. The combination of hydraulic actuators and a design which is optimized in terms of mechanical stiffness enables the platform to manipulate loads of up to 20 kN. Sophisticated software allows direct six–axis positioning including true path control. Our platform is an ideal support structure for a large variety of scientific instruments that require a stable alignment base with high-precision motion...|$|R
40|$|Classical {{flexible}} structures {{dynamics and}} control suffer from several major deficiencies. First, reliable mathematical models involve partial differential equations which {{are difficult to}} deal with analytically as well as numerically. A partial differential equations mathematical model of a system 2 ̆ 7 s dynamics is not practical for control system design, since most of the modern control systems design methodologies assume a state space representation. Second, from a practical perspective, the control of classical truss structures involves the use of expensive and short life mechanisms like <b>telescopic</b> <b>struts.</b> Third, the control of classical truss structures involves high energy, massive, hydraulic actuators. Fourth, classical controllable structures have many, complicated, bar to bar joints, which make the control task difficult. ^ This thesis proposes a class of lightweight, space structures, called tensegrity structures, which can be reliably modeled using ordinary differential equations. Tensegrity structures offer excellent opportunities for physically integrated structure and control system design since their members can serve simultaneously as sensors, actuators, and load carrying elements. The actuating functions can be carried by tendons, controlled by electric motors. Thus, <b>telescopic</b> <b>struts</b> and hydraulic actuators can be eliminated. Additionally, tensegrity structures can be built without any bar to bar connections. ^ The general prestressability conditions for tensegrity structures are derived from the principle of virtual work. In several cases these conditions are analytically solved, allowing for the parameterization of certain classes of prestressable configurations. A general methodology for the investigation of the prestressability conditions is also developed. The methodology uses symbolic and numeric computation, and it is meant to significantly reduce the complexity of the prestressability conditions for certain prestressable configurations. ^ Mathematical models for tensegrity structures dynamics are developed using the Lagrangian approach. For certain classes of structures, particular motions are investigated and simpler dynamic equations are derived. These equations are next used for a simple, efficient, tendon control reconfiguration procedure. For certain classes of tensegrity structures linear parametric dynamical models are also developed. ^ A tendon control deployment procedure for tensegrity structures is developed. The procedure is time optimal and uses continuous time control laws. It is based on the discovery of a connected equilibrium manifold to which the deployed and undeployed configurations belong. The deployment is conducted such that, in the state space, the deployment path is close enough to the equilibrium manifold. ^ A force and torque sensor based on a tensegrity structure is proposed, enabling the simultaneous measurement of six quantities, three orthogonal forces and three orthogonal moments. An optimal estimator is designed, based on the linearized model of the structure. ^ Finally, a motion simulator which exploits the intrinsic advantages of a tensegrity structure, is proposed. The actuating functions are carried out by the tendons, eliminating the telescopic actuators. A nonlinear robust tracking controller is designed to assure exponential convergence of the tracking error to a ball of prespecified radius, with a prespecified rate of convergence. ...|$|R
50|$|The Pegasus had a rectangular-section, ply-covered {{fuselage}}, which tapered {{towards the}} tail. The wing was braced above the fuselage by the struts and the open, unscreened cockpit {{was under the}} leading edge; fabric-covered, inverted V-shaped decking tapered from the lower wing surface rearwards. There was a short, curved landing skid fixed at the nose and joined to the lower longerons {{at the same point}} as the lift struts by a V-form pair of <b>telescopic</b> compression <b>struts.</b> Initially the Pegasus had a tailskid but flight trials showed that both skids were easily broken, so the main skid was replaced with a stiffer one and the tailskid by a rubber tailwheel.|$|R
2500|$|The 156 uses a {{platform}} {{derived from the}} Alfa Romeo 155, which in turn {{was derived from the}} Fiat Group's [...] "Tipo" [...] platform. However it is sufficiently different from the original [...] "Tipo" [...] one {{to be seen as a}} new platform. The 156 is a highly developed front-wheel drive car; (the Cross/Sportwagon Q4 offered four-wheel drive in left-hand drive markets) with a double high wishbone front suspension and Camuffo type rear suspension, which consists of a <b>telescopic</b> vertical <b>strut</b> with coaxial spring and two transverse links of different lengths and a longitudinal strut. This structure means that the rear wheels have a tiny passive steering ability. Weight saving material (aluminium) has been used in several parts both front and rear suspension.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{the upper}} wing tilted, {{it had to}} be a {{cantilever}} structure. It was built around two wooden spars and was mounted at its centre on a chordwise circular cross-section rod, fixed to the fuselage, which acted as a hinge and allowed the wing to see-saw. When the Jona J-6 appeared at the Milan show in 1935, the year before its first flight, this hinge was held above the fuselage on a faired column, but before it flew this was replaced by four pairs of faired V-form struts with their eight ends fixed to it. [...] Control wires from the ailerons were attached to the fixed hinge rod, providing the required automatic deflections as the wing tilted. The rate of tilt was limited by a pair of <b>telescopic,</b> sprung <b>struts</b> from mid-chord quite close to the centreline, which met at the bottom centre of the fuselage after passing in through the upper sides. These could be hydraulically locked for aerobatics and spins or when stabilisation was not wanted. Leading edge automatic Handley Page slots were fitted to prevent spinning via wingtip stalling. The wing was plywood-covered and straight-tapered in plan form, with semi-elliptical tips. The lower wing was generally similar, though much smaller and rigidly mounted. Though not required when the automatic lateral control system was engaged, conventional, pilot operated ailerons were later added to the lower wing.|$|R
50|$|The front {{suspension}} geometry {{was developed}} {{from that of}} the Ford P5 and again incorporated MacPherson <b>struts.</b> <b>Telescopic</b> dampers also improved the suspension of the wheels {{at the back of the}} car where the steel beam axle and the semielliptical leaf springs would have been familiar to drivers of earlier Taunus models. The rear suspension setup was by now seen as rather outclassed in comparison with traditional rivals from Opel, and tended to undermine any aspirations for the 26M version of the relatively lowly 17M/20M to compete in a higher class than the earlier 17M had attempted. The antiquated rear axle would be replaced by a more up-to-date semitrailing arm arrangement on the successor model, but Ford nevertheless remained curiously attached to the old combination of a rigid rear axle and leaf springs, and by now. uniquely among Germany’s mainstream sutomakers, were still selling this rear-axle configuration to buyers of the Ford Capri until 1984.|$|R
