5|$|Deities {{were present}} {{not only in}} the heavens, but also in the human body itself. They were {{responsible}} for maintaining the body's five viscera, guarding the registers of life, and regulating the souls. There were five internal deities that were particularly important in Lingbao Daoism. The Great Unity lived in the head, along with Lordling and White Prime, who could descend into the liver and lungs. The Director of Destinies lived in <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> sexual organs, and finally, the Peach Child lived in the lower dantian. Normally these deities resided in the heavens, but they could be activated by scriptural recitations to descend into the body.|$|E
5|$|Fibropapillomatosis disease {{caused by}} a form of the herpes-type virus threatens loggerheads with {{internal}} and external tumors. These tumors disrupt essential behaviors and, if on the eyes, cause permanent blindness. Trematodes of the family Spirorchiidae inhabit tissues throughout {{the body of the}} loggerhead, including vital organs, such as <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> the brain. Trematode infection can be highly debilitating. For example, inflammatory trematode lesions can cause endocarditis and neurological disease. A nematode, Angiostoma carettae, also infects loggerheads, causing histologic lesions in the respiratory tract.|$|E

Failure to win <b>the</b> <b>hearts</b> <b>and</b> minds of Malayans would lead to other developments, for example the rise of the Malayan Communist Party.|$|R
5000|$|THE HOLY SPIRIT - The Holy Spirit is {{the active}} Presence of God {{in the world}} <b>and</b> in <b>the</b> <b>hearts</b> <b>and</b> lives of God's people.

Also, the Holy Spirit empowers the Christian to live out his/her faith, provides assurance of salvation for the believer, and bestows upon the believer spiritual gifts for ministry.|$|R
5|$|Heart {{conditions}} {{related to}} the King Charles Spaniel include mitral valve disease, in which the mitral valve degrades, causing blood to flow backwards through the chambers of <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> eventually leading to congestive heart failure. Patent ductus arteriosus, where blood is channelled back from the heart into the lungs, is also seen {{and can lead to}} heart failure. Both of these conditions present with similar symptoms and are inheritable. The OFA conducted a survey on cardiac disease, where of 105 breeds, the King Charles Spaniel was found to be 7th worst, with 2.1% of 189 dogs affected.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo's {{anatomical}} drawings {{include many}} {{studies of the}} human skeleton and its parts, and of muscles and sinews. He studied the mechanical functions of the skeleton and the muscular forces that are applied to it {{in a manner that}} prefigured the modern science of biomechanics. He drew <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> vascular system, the sex organs and other internal organs, making one of the first scientific drawings of a fetus in utero. The drawings and notation are far ahead of their time, and if published would undoubtedly have made a major contribution to medical science.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} molluscs, the {{excretory}} organs of bivalves are {{a pair of}} nephridia. Each of these consists of a long, looped, glandular tube, which opens into the body cavity just beneath <b>the</b> <b>heart,</b> <b>and</b> a bladder to store urine. The pericardial glands either line the auricles of the heart or attach to the pericardium, and serve as extra filtration organs. Metabolic waste is voided from the bladders through a pair of openings {{near the front of}} {{the upper part of the}} mantle cavity, from where it joins the stream of exhalant water.|$|E

5|$|Megalodon {{probably}} {{had a profound impact}} on the structure of marine communities. The fossil record indicates that it had a cosmopolitan distribution. It probably targeted large prey, such as whales, seals, and giant turtles. Juveniles inhabited warm coastal waters where they would feed on fish and small whales. Unlike the great white which attacks prey from the soft underside, megalodon probably used its strong jaws to break through the chest cavity and puncture <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> lungs of its prey.|$|E
5|$|Molluscs' circulatory {{systems are}} mainly open. Although {{molluscs}} are coelomates, their coeloms {{are reduced to}} fairly small spaces enclosing <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> gonads. The main body cavity is a hemocoel through which blood and coelomic fluid circulate and which encloses {{most of the other}} internal organs. These hemocoelic spaces act as an efficient hydrostatic skeleton. The blood contains the respiratory pigment hemocyanin as an oxygen-carrier. The heart consists of one or more pairs of atria (auricles), which receive oxygenated blood from the gills and pump it to the ventricle, which pumps it into the aorta (main artery), which is fairly short and opens into the hemocoel.|$|E

5|$|Normal {{blood flow}} is {{anterograde}} (going to <b>the</b> <b>heart),</b> <b>and</b> from superficial to deep veins via perforator veins. However, {{there are two}} exceptions: firstly, the great saphenous vein (GSV) collaterals, (the veins that run parallel), drain the abdominal wall and have a flow {{from top to bottom}} so that when an examiner tests the sapheno-femoral junction, a false positive diagnosis might be made; secondly, in the flow from the sole of the foot venous network around 10% drains to the dorsal venous arch of the foot, going therefore against the norm, from deep to superficial veins.|$|E
5|$|The {{innermost}} {{layer of}} the heart is called the endocardium. It {{is made up of}} a lining of simple squamous epithelium, and covers heart chambers and valves. It is continuous with the endothelium of the veins and arteries of <b>the</b> <b>heart,</b> <b>and</b> is joined to the myocardium with a thin layer of connective tissue. The endocardium, by secreting endothelins, may also play a role in regulating the contraction of the myocardium.|$|E
5|$|The playable {{character}} can lead {{a group of}} three additional allies into battle, controlling their actions to attack a single enemy or to use specific powers. Characters can be set to one of three modes: defensive, neutral, or offensive. In defensive mode, the character remains distant from battles, while offensive mode sends the character directly into battle. The main character and active allies are represented by portraits on screen that reflect their current physical or emotional state, showing sadness, anger, feeding, or the presence of injuries or staking—having been stabbed through <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>and</b> rendered immobile.|$|E
5000|$|A diamond {{that has}} the top facet or [...] "table facet" [...] exactly {{perpendicular}} {{to the bottom of}} the diamond or [...] "pavilion" [...] and has its other facets precisely aligned with excellent symmetry, may show patterns that look like arrows from <b>the</b> top <b>and</b> <b>hearts</b> from <b>the</b> bottom. Generally it will need to be viewed loose under a gemscope to see the pattern very well. Although <b>the</b> <b>hearts</b> <b>and</b> arrows property is indicative of a top-tier cut, it does not always mean the diamond will be the most brilliant. Optimal facet placement is the key to brilliance and more important than facet patterning. Not all ideal round cuts will have <b>the</b> <b>hearts</b> <b>and</b> arrows effect either.|$|R
