5|$|Colleen and Suzanne Dengel, {{the twins}} who played Miranda's daughters, were cast {{two weeks after}} auditioning for Frankel and Finerman. The {{director}} and producer laughed, which the sisters believed help them get the part.

5|$|Aston and Taylor {{subsequently}} decided <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>together</b> <b>on</b> a new archaeological television series, devising {{the format}} for Time Team.

He knew the actor and television presenter Tony Robinson after they had met on an archaeological course in Greece, and successfully requested that he present the show. From an early stage, they had agreed that every episode would feature a practical process or a re-enactment alongside the field archaeology.|$|E

The plan was finalized in December 2004, with an agreement to accelerate planning and construction in time for a December 2009 opening, in time for the 2010 Winter Olympics held in nearby Vancouver, British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{intensely}} closeted {{nature of}} Miami's gay community at that time, many voters {{who were not}} swayed by Bryant's rhetoric were persuaded instead by her campaign's point that the law was unnecessary; {{they were unable to}} see the problem of discrimination. Unlike blacks or Cubans, gay men and lesbians were able to find jobs, although they faced dismissal upon their supervisors learning of their sexual orientation. In order to see a complaint through, they would have to remain out, and many lived in constant fear of exposure. Since the advent of second wave feminism earlier in the decade, many lesbians in the U.S. were unable to see themselves as part of the same community with gay men. Accusations from Save Our Children were almost all directed at the behavior of men. As a result, much of the response by gay men was angry and many lesbians took issue with the misogynistic tone gay men used. However, with Bryant representing a common adversary, {{for the first time in}} years, gay men and lesbians united <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>together</b> <b>on</b> the campaign.|$|E

25|$|The {{corporate}} LCMS is formally constituted of {{two types}} of members: autonomous local congregations that qualify for membership by mutual agreement to adhere to stated principles, and clergymen who qualify by similar means. Congregations hold legal title to their church buildings and other property, and call (hire) and dismiss their own clergy. Much of the practical work of the LCMS structure is as a free employment brokerage to bring the two together; it also allows the congregations <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>together</b> <b>on</b> projects far too large for even a local consortium of congregations to accomplish, such as foreign mission work.|$|E
25|$|British girl {{group the}} Sugababes were formed in 1998 by Siobhán Donaghy, Mutya Buena and Keisha Buchanan.

Garrison initially shared Lundy's gradualist views, but while working for the Genius, he became convinced of the need to demand immediate and complete emancipation. Lundy and Garrison continued <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>together</b> <b>on</b> the paper in spite of their differing views. Each signed his own editorials.|$|E

25|$|P. vivax is {{the only}} {{indigenous}} malaria parasite on the Korean peninsula. In the years following the Korean War (1950–53), malaria-eradication campaigns successfully {{reduced the number of}} new cases of the disease in North Korea and South Korea. In 1979, World Health Organization declared the Korean peninsula vivax malaria-free, but the disease unexpectedly re-emerged in the late 1990s and still persists today. Several factors contributed to the re-emergence of the disease, including reduced emphasis on malaria control after 1979, floods and famine in North Korea, emergence of drug resistance and possibly global warming. Most cases are identified along the Korean Demilitarized Zone. As such, vivax malaria offers the two Koreas an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>together</b> <b>on</b> an important health problem that affects both countries.|$|E
