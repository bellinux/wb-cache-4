5|$|In the Jataka {{tales of}} the Buddha's {{previous}} lives, there is narration related to his birth as Boddhisattva in a forest as a Sharabha, the eight-legged deer. This story is of one compassion of <b>the</b> <b>deer</b> shown towards the King who wanted to hunt <b>the</b> <b>deer.</b> The King, while trying to hunt <b>the</b> <b>deer,</b> fell into a precipice with his horse. <b>The</b> <b>deer</b> instead of abandoning the king to his fate rescued him. The King was deeply touched by the compassion shown by <b>the</b> <b>deer</b> and thereafter promulgated a decry stating that hunting was an illegal activity in his country.|$|E

5|$|The Dutch {{soon found}} trade in deerskins and venison in the East Asian market to be a lucrative {{endeavor}} and recruited Plains Aborigines to procure the hides. <b>The</b> <b>deer</b> trade attracted the first Han traders to aboriginal villages, but {{as early as}} 1642 the demand for deer greatly diminished <b>the</b> <b>deer</b> stocks. This drop significantly reduced the prosperity of aboriginal peoples, forcing many aborigines to take up farming to counter {{the economic impact of}} losing their most vital food source.|$|E

50|$|Though it {{has been}} argued that <b>the</b> black-tailed <b>deer</b> is a species, {{virtually}} all recent authorities maintain it as a subspecies of <b>the</b> mule <b>deer</b> (Odocoileus hemionus). Strictly speaking, <b>the</b> black-tailed <b>deer</b> group consists of two subspecies, as it also includes O. h. sitkensis (Sitka black-tailed <b>deer).</b> <b>The</b> black-tailed <b>deer</b> group and <b>the</b> mule <b>deer</b> group (sensu stricto) hybridize, and mule deer appear to have evolved from <b>the</b> black-tailed <b>deer</b> group. Despite this, the mtDNA of <b>the</b> white-tailed <b>deer</b> and mule deer are similar, but differ from that of <b>the</b> black-tailed <b>deer.</b> This may be the result of introgression, although hybrids between <b>the</b> mule <b>deer</b> and white-tailed deer are rare in the wild (apparently more common locally in West Texas), and the hybrid survival rate is low even in captivity.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> mule <b>deer</b> can {{be divided}} into two main groups: <b>The</b> mule <b>deer</b> (sensu stricto) and <b>the</b> black-tailed <b>deer.</b> <b>The</b> first group {{includes}} all subspecies, except O. h. columbianus and O. h. sitkensis, which are in <b>the</b> black-tailed <b>deer</b> group. <b>The</b> two main groups have been treated as separate species, but they hybridize, and virtually all recent authorities treat <b>the</b> mule <b>deer</b> and black-tailed deer as conspecific. It appears <b>the</b> mule <b>deer</b> evolved from <b>the</b> black-tailed <b>deer.</b> Despite this, <b>the</b> mtDNA of <b>the</b> white-tailed <b>deer</b> and mule deer are similar, but differ from that of <b>the</b> black-tailed <b>deer.</b> This {{may be the result of}} introgression, although hybrids between <b>the</b> mule <b>deer</b> and white-tailed deer are rare in the wild (apparently more common locally in West Texas), and the hybrid survival rate is low even in captivity. Many claims of observations of wild hybrids are not legitimate, as identification based on external features is complicated.|$|R
5|$|Afternoon winds usually {{die down}} in the evening, {{prompting}} behavioral modifications in the herd. <b>The</b> <b>deer</b> avoid the dry wind by being more active at night when the wind is not blowing. In 1991 there was a three-year average of 420 mule deer.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} known to kill deer, {{especially}} in winter when smaller prey is scarce, or when deer populations become more abundant. One study in the Everglades showed a large majority of kills (33 of 39) were fawns, but prey up to eight times the bobcat's weight could be successfully taken. It stalks <b>the</b> <b>deer,</b> often when <b>the</b> <b>deer</b> is lying down, then rushes in and grabs it by the neck before biting the throat, base of the skull, or chest. On the rare occasions a bobcat kills a deer, it eats its fill and then buries the carcass under snow or leaves, often returning to it several times to feed.|$|E
5|$|Pudús have various {{methods of}} obtaining the foliage they need. Their small stature and {{cautious}} nature create obstacles in attaining food. They stop often while searching for food {{to stand on}} their hind legs and smell the wind, detecting food scents. Females and fawns peel bark from saplings using their teeth, but mature males may use their spikelike antlers. <b>The</b> <b>deer</b> may use their front legs to press down on saplings until they snap or become low enough to the ground so they can reach the leaves. Forced to stand on their hind legs due to their small size, <b>the</b> <b>deer</b> climb branches and tree stumps to reach higher foliage. They bend bamboo shoots horizontally in order to walk on them and eat from higher branches.|$|E
25|$|Compared to <b>the</b> hog <b>deer,</b> <b>the</b> chital {{has a more}} cursorial build. The antlers and brow tines {{are longer}} than those in <b>the</b> hog <b>deer.</b> <b>The</b> pedicles (the bony cores from which antlers arise) are shorter and the {{auditory}} bullae are smaller in the chital. The chital may be confused with <b>the</b> fallow <b>deer.</b> <b>The</b> chital is darker and has several white spots, whereas <b>the</b> fallow <b>deer</b> has white splotches. The chital has a prominent white patch on its throat, while the throat of <b>the</b> fallow <b>deer</b> is completely white. The hairs are smooth and flexible.|$|R

5|$|Set {{in a small}} steep valley {{overlooking}} the city of Bath a park was established on the site by John of Tours, the Bishop of Bath and Wells, in around 1100 as a deer park. It was subsequently sold to Humphrey Colles, a lawyer and member of parliament for Somerset, and then another member of parliament, Matthew Colthurst. Even before the Dissolution of the Monasteries the walls which had enclosed <b>the</b> <b>deer</b> park had fallen into disrepair and <b>the</b> <b>deer</b> had escaped. The land was then returned to agricultural use.|$|E
5|$|The {{animals were}} kept in pens on Sullivan Hill, {{situated}} across the East Drive from the zoo's present location, near the sheep paddock and northeast of the Dairy Farmhouse. Of the original zoological facilities in the park, <b>the</b> <b>Deer</b> Paddock, located near the present Carousel, was converted into a meadow and <b>the</b> <b>deer</b> were moved to the new Menagerie, The Wild Fowl Pond remained, located {{on the east side}} of the park in a low area now forming the northern part of the zoo. The Menagerie continued to accrue animals in the first decades of the 20th century. These were generally donated by prominent individuals and institutions and formed a varied collection of specimens both native to North America and other regions of the world.|$|E
5|$|The deer- and boar-hunting {{scenes are}} less clearly connected, {{although}} scholars {{have attempted to}} link each animal to Gawain's reactions in the parallel seduction scene. Attempts to connect <b>the</b> <b>deer</b> hunt with the first seduction scene have unearthed a few parallels. Deer hunts of the time, like courtship, {{had to be done}} according to established rules. Women often favoured suitors who hunted well and skinned their animals, sometimes even watching while a deer was cleaned. The sequence describing <b>the</b> <b>deer</b> hunt is relatively unspecific and nonviolent, with an air of relaxation and exhilaration. The first seduction scene follows in a similar vein, with no overt physical advances and no apparent danger; the entire exchange is humorously portrayed.|$|E

5|$|The {{house is}} {{surrounded}} by a deer park which was landscaped by Capability Brown from 1775. He established a winding path, known as Capability Brown path, through the park and planted deciduous trees in key places to frame the house and castle. <b>The</b> <b>deer</b> park contains notable herds of rare White Park cattle and fallow deer. A small garden behind the house, overlooking <b>the</b> <b>deer</b> park, Moorish in style with a central fountain, has been restored to its former glory.

5|$|About 10 to 20 {{white-tailed deer}} {{per square mile}} (2.6 to 5.2 deer per square kilometer) live along {{the river and the}} parkway, more than the {{ecosystem}} can carry.

5000|$|The Capreolinae, [...] Odocoileinae, or <b>the</b> New World <b>deer</b> are a {{subfamily}} of deer. Alternatively, {{they are}} known as <b>the</b> telemetacarpal <b>deer,</b> due to their bone structure being different from <b>the</b> plesiometacarpal <b>deer</b> subfamily Cervinae. <b>The</b> telemetacarpal <b>deer</b> maintain their distal lateral metacarpals, while <b>the</b> plesiometacarpal <b>deer</b> maintain only their proximal lateral metacarpals.
