5|$|In 1967, Venera 4 found Venus's {{magnetic}} field <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> weaker {{than that of}} Earth. This {{magnetic field}} is induced by an interaction between the ionosphere and the solar wind, rather than by an internal dynamo as in the Earth's core. Venus's small induced magnetosphere provides negligible protection to the atmosphere against cosmic radiation.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013, Gavyn Davies for The Financial Times {{emphasized}} that a key {{difference between the}} 1930s and the 21st century outbreaks {{is that in the}} thirties some of the retaliations between countries were carried out not by devaluations, but by increases in import tariffs, which tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more disruptive to international trade.|$|E
5|$|LucasArts {{developed}} a port of the enhanced edition for the Sega CD, but the release was eventually canceled because The Secret of Monkey Island failed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> {{of a commercial}} success on the platform.

5|$|Mass {{estimates}} from the Voyager program missions suggested that Enceladus was composed {{almost entirely of}} water ice. However, based {{on the effects of}} Enceladus's gravity on Cassini, its mass was determined <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> higher than previously thought, yielding a density of 1.61 g/cm3. This density is higher than Saturn's other mid-sized icy satellites, indicating that Enceladus contains a greater percentage of silicates and iron.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the writing}} {{received}} mixed reviews, {{the reception of}} the artwork was almost entirely positive. Higgins, recalling the heavy blacks and bold outlines of the original strip, found Critchlow's new style <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more open and expressive. Maxwell also praised Critchlow's development as an artist, judging the comic to be beautifully drawn and coloured with a clear line style. Carter thought that the art was a little flat in places, but nevertheless praised it for being unique {{with a lot of}} character.|$|E
5|$|Ampelosaurus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{completely}} known titanosaurian sauropods from Europe. Since 1989, over 500 bones discovered at the Upper Cretaceous Bellevue locality of southern France have been assigned to A. atacis. An abundant amount of well-preserved elements have been uncovered at Bellevue. In the original description, only a tooth and some vertebrae were examined. In 2005, a complete description was made by Le Loueff of all known material, allowing Ampelosaurus <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> better understood. All the material has been assigned to the species, and even though there are some differences in limb proportions, it has all been linked to individual variation.|$|E
5|$|Assuming a {{composition}} {{similar to that}} of Jupiter and that the planet's atmosphere is close to chemical equilibrium, it is predicted that 55 Cancri d is covered in a layer of water clouds: the planet's internal heat probably keeps it too warm to form the ammonia-based clouds that are typical of Jupiter. Its surface gravity is likely to be about 4 to 5 times stronger than Jupiter, or about 10 to 15 times that of Earth which is because the radius of the planet is unlikely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> more than Jupiter's and is probably slightly smaller than Jupiter due to the high metal content in the parent star.|$|E

5|$|Because {{they have}} to carry the large water tank and fuel for the burner, snow melting {{machines}} tend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> larger and heavier than most winter service vehicles, at around , with the largest being hauled by semi-trailer tractor units. In addition, the complicated melting process means that snow melting vehicles have a much lower capacity than the equivalent plow or blower vehicle; the largest snow melter can remove 500 metric tons of snow per hour, compared to the 5,000 metric tons per hour capacity of any large snow blower.|$|E
5|$|II Napoleon {{ordered the}} {{assemblage}} of over 5,000 artillery for transport through the pass, {{despite the fact}} that the pass was widely considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> too narrow, and the route too volatile and unstable, to allow any form of artillery, light or heavy, to come through. Thus, Napoleons military advisers warned him against this move, but he insisted on this presence of this great number of artillery.|$|E
5|$|In 1627, Kepler {{published}} his Rudolphine Tables. Two {{years later he}} published extracts from the tables in his pamphlet De raris mirisque Anni 1631 which included an admonitio ad astronomos (warning to astronomers) concerning a transit of Mercury in 1631 and transits of Venus in 1631 and 1761. The Mercury transit occurred as predicted and was observed by Johann Baptist Cysat in Innsbruck, Johannes Remus Quietanus in Rouffach and Pierre Gassendi in Paris, vindicating the Keplerian approach. But their observations threw into question previous theories about the Solar System as Mercury was shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> smaller than expected.|$|E
