The full-time ones are at the north end and each has a turnstile bank, token booth, and two street stairs. <b>The</b> <b>ones</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Manhattan-bound platform go up to the northeast and southeast corners of Bergen and Smith Streets while those on the Coney Island-bound platform go up to the northwest and southwest corners. The fare control areas on the south end of the platforms are unstaffed, containing full height turnstiles and one street stair to the northeast corner of Warren and Smith Streets on the Manhattan-bound platform and the northwest corner for the Coney Island-bound platform. The south fare control area is more heavily used.|$|E

25|$|As {{the century}} ended, the natural-cement {{industry}} dominated the market. The Snyder family was proud that their cement {{had been used}} in the Brooklyn Bridge, an icon of the era. Beach built another new plant in the northeast corner of the property to handle demand. But the development of the cheaper Portland cement during that time period eventually toppled the Rosendale variety, whose market share dropped 90% {{in the first decade of}} the 20th century. Local industrial magnate Samuel Coykendall eventually tried to salvage the Rosendale industry through mergers, combining all the local companies save <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Snyder property into one. The Consolidated Rosendale Cement Company was no more successful than any of its component companies had been, and was in receivership by 1918.|$|E

25|$|Arriving at Norway during winter, Gudrid is {{amazed that}} {{the trees are}} huge {{compared}} to <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> islands. When the group goes ashore to make camp, they are suddenly attacked by a bear that is awake despite winter. The bear almost kills Thorfinn and Einar, but is suddenly killed by a crossbow quarrel. A female hunter emerges from the wood and intrudes herself as Hild, daughter of Hrafnkell. Hild skins the bear and lets the group have the meat. While enjoying a bear meat stew, Hild and the group get along quite well, chatting friendly with each other. However, Hild suddenly reveals that she recognizes Thorfinn {{as the one who}} killed her father when her home was attacked by Askeladd's warband 8 years before. Thorfinn remembers the attack and admits that he is guilty. Hild almost shoots Thornfinn with her crossbow but hesitates because Karli is strapped to his back. Hild tell the group that she poisoned the soup and will throw the antidote away unless Thorfinn follow her into the woods alone to face her. Thorfinn agrees, swearing to his comrades that he will not die, nor will he hurt Hild. Thorfinn initially keeps himself at bay while evading Hild's quarrels, but he finally figures out her position and charges her. However, he is taken completely by surprise by Hild's specially crafted crossbow's ability to reload rapidly, taking multiple quarrels to his legs. Thorfinn's comrades arrive despite Hild's threat and try to convince Hild that Thorfinn is not the person he once was, and Thonfinn himself begs for time to atone for his sins. Hild remains unconvinced and is about to finish Thorfinn off, but she sees a vision of her father and her old hunting master which causes her to miss. Although she cannot forgive Thorfinn, she agrees to give him time to try and complete his mission. Hild decides to travel with the group {{to keep an eye on}} Thorfinn and swears that if he shows any signs of abandoning his mission to create a land of peace, she will kill him at last.|$|E

500|$|The high {{fatalities}} of the Americans in the Battle of Frenchtown and {{the subsequent}} Massacre of prisoners became fuel for pro-war political factions known as War Hawks, and for anti-British sentiment of the era.

[...] The {{fact that many of}} the murdered men were well-known and well-connected members of Kentucky's elite increased the public outcry.

2500|$|The {{importance}} of these findings {{lies in the fact}} that the bulk of the Vinča symbols were created in the period between 4500 and 4000 BC, with <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Tărtăria clay tablets even dating back to around 5300 BC. This means that the Vinča finds predate the proto-Sumerian pictographic script from Uruk (modern Iraq), which is usually considered to be the oldest known script, by more than a thousand years. Analyses of the symbols showed that they have little similarity with Near Eastern writing, leading to the view that these symbols and the Sumerian script probably arose independently.|$|E

Three {{level crossings}} are operated remotely by staff from a traffic control center, using cameras; these have full barriers and no bells.

Crossings with little road traffic and/or little rail traffic have no alarm, just warning signs. There are no level crossings where trains routinely run at over 140km/h. Level crossings have a sign saying [...] "WACHT" [...] (WAIT).|$|E

2500|$|The Big Synagogue {{was built}} between 1899 and 1900 at the {{initiative}} of the Jewish community [...] "Status Quo" [...] and that {{was considered to be}} one of the most beautiful synagogues of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.

Each side of the central spire is decorated with a floral rosette similar to <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> façade. This type of window is also used several times on the lateral façades. The vast interior is richly decorated, both with shapes and color. The synagogue has 314 seats on the ground floor and 238 on the top floor.

2500|$|The {{history of}} American poetry {{is not easy}} to know.

The received narrative of Modernism proposes that Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot were perhaps the most influential modernist English-language poets in the period during World War I. But this narrative leaves out African American and women poets who were published and read widely {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century. By the 1960s, the young poets of the British Poetry Revival looked to their American contemporaries and predecessors as models for the kind of poetry they wanted to write. Toward the end of the millennium, consideration of American poetry had diversified, as scholars placed an increased emphasis on poetry by women, African Americans, Hispanics, Chicanos and other cultural groupings.|$|E
