50|$|The treaty {{included}} a protocol which detailed technical {{data to be}} exchanged and which limited weapon testing to specific designated test sites to assist verification. The data to be exchanged included information on the geographical boundaries and geology of the testing areas. Geological data—including such factors as density of rock formation, water saturation, and depth of the water table—are useful in verifying test yields because the seismic signal produced by a given underground nuclear explosion varies with these factors at the <b>test</b> <b>location.</b> After an actual test has taken place, the geographic coordinates of the <b>test</b> <b>location</b> are to be furnished to the other party, to help in placing the test in the proper geological setting and thus in assessing the yield.|$|E

40|$|Sunflower mega-environment {{analysis}} was conducted for the grain yield data of 20 hybrids and 19 <b>test</b> <b>locations</b> during 2006, and 20 hybrids and 16 <b>test</b> <b>locations</b> during 2007. Combined data included 15 hybrids and 9 <b>test</b> <b>locations</b> common for both years and it was analyzed as balanced experiment. The analysis of variance components showed that hybrid by location interaction explained 2. 74, 5. 8, and 3. 72 times more variation than hybrid, for grain yield, for 2006, 2007, combined data, respectively, and indicated potential mega-environment existence. Our results showed the existence of two mega-environments in Serbia sunflower growing region: (1) Kula Vitovnica, Aleksa Šantić, Sombor and (2) Rimski Šančevi, Kikinda. It has been concluded that if we want promising sunflower hybrids to be optimally used, they should be cropped differently for the two determined mega-environments...|$|R
40|$|We used a {{statistical}} cluster analysis to analyze patterns of loss in 76 visual fields with typical glaucomatous defects to identify natural groupings of <b>test</b> <b>locations</b> {{in the visual}} field. Eleven clusters in the Octopus Program G 1 (Interzeag, Inc., Northboro, Massachusetts) visual field were thus defined. In a separate population of 70 early glaucomatous and 70 age-matched normal visual fields, the local mean defects within these clusters and the global mean defect were calculated to assess their relative abilities to discriminate between the two groups. The 11 clustered mean defects collectively had a sensitivity of 90 % and a specificity of 93 %; the global mean defect had a sensitivity of 81 % and a specificity of 91 %. Additionally, we examined the long-term fluctuation clusters of <b>test</b> <b>locations</b> compared to the long-term fluctuation of individual <b>test</b> <b>locations.</b> Four hundred ten visual fields of 93 clinically stable eyes of 67 patients with glaucoma, as well as 210 visual fields of 105 eyes of 105 normal subjects were studied. In the stable glaucoma group, mean fluctuation of clustered <b>test</b> <b>locations</b> was 3. 5 dB 2, and mean fluctuation of individual <b>test</b> <b>locations</b> was 7. 0 dB 2. In the normal group, the respective values were 0. 6 dB 2 and 1. 8 dB 2. Cluster analysis was effective in detecting localized loss and in dampening long-term fluctuation. We studied the use of clusters in distinguishing normal from glaucomatous as well as stable from deteriorating visual fields. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the locus of}} <b>test</b> <b>locations</b> that exhibit statistically similar age-related decline in sensitivity to light increments and age-corrected contrast sensitivity isocontours (CSIs) across the central visual field (VF). We compared these CSIs with test point clusters used by the Glaucoma Hemifield Test (GHT). Methods: Sixty healthy observers underwent testing on the Humphrey Field Analyzer 30 - 2 test grid using Goldmann (G) stimulus sizes I-V. Age-correction factors for GI-V were determined using linear regression analysis. Pattern recognition {{analysis was used to}} cluster <b>test</b> <b>locations</b> across the VF exhibiting equal age-related sensitivity decline (age-related CSIs), and points of equal age-corrected sensitivity (age-corrected CSIs) for GI-V. Results: There was a small but significant test size–dependent sensitivity decline with age, with smaller stimuli declining more rapidly. Age-related decline in sensitivity was more rapid in the periphery. A greater number of unique age-related CSIs was revealed when using smaller stimuli, particularly in the mid-periphery. Cluster analysis of age-corrected sensitivity thresholds revealed unique CSIs for GI-V, with smaller stimuli having a greater number of unique clusters. Zones examined by the GHT consisted of <b>test</b> <b>locations</b> that did not necessarily belong to the same CSI, particularly in the periphery. Conclusions: Cluster analysis reveals statistically significant groups of <b>test</b> <b>locations</b> within the 30 - 2 test grid exhibiting the same age-related decline. CSIs facilitate pooling of sensitivities to reduce the variability of individual <b>test</b> <b>locations.</b> These CSIs could guide future structure-function and alternate hemifield asymmetry analyses by comparing matched areas of similar sensitivity signatures...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} task of multienvironment trials (MET) analysis is evaluation of testing sites for megaenvironment differentiation and selection of "ideal" candidate location {{to improve the}} efficiency of cultivar selection and recommendation. The objectives of this research work were (i) to divide the Spanish cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) <b>testing</b> <b>locations</b> into megaenvironments and (ii) to separate the <b>testing</b> <b>locations</b> based on their distance to the "ideal" location, discriminating ability, representativeness, and uniqueness. GGE biplot was employed to analyze eight 1 -yr and two multiyear (3 -yr, 4 -yr) balanced datasets from 1999 to 2006 cotton trials of Delta & Pine Land Co. in Spain for yield, fiber quality traits, a selection index (SI) based on yield and quality, and Verticillium wilt (Verticillium dahliae Kleb.) disease infestation level. Yearly GGE biplots revealed crossover genotype x location interactions, but not large enough to divide the area into different megaenvironments. Therefore, the Spanish cotton region may {{be considered as a}} complex megaenvironment and cultivar recommendation may be based on both mean performance and stability. Las Cabezas location was the closest to an ideal based on both yield and the SI regardless of the change from plastic to nonplastic mulching cultural practice. Aznalcazar did not provide unique information and could be dropped as a test site. The separation of <b>test</b> <b>locations</b> for their discriminating ability and representativeness provided useful information on the effectiveness of each <b>testing</b> <b>location</b> for developing and/or recommending cultivars with specific or broad adaptation.
