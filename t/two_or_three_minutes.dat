Kouma's four vehicles attacked this structure, and after about a minute of heavy fire the bridge collapsed, and the ponton boats used to hold the bridge in place were sunk. At 23:00 a small arms fight flared around the left side of A Company north of the tanks. This gunfire had lasted only <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes</b> when the A Company roadblock squads near the tanks received word by field telephone that the company was withdrawing to the original ridge positions and that they should do likewise.|$|E
5|$|Not one of {{the marchers}} even raised an arm {{to fend off the}} blows. They went down like ten-pins. From where I stood I heard the sickening whacks of the clubs on {{unprotected}} skulls. The waiting crowd of watchers groaned and sucked in their breaths in sympathetic pain at every blow. Those struck down fell sprawling, unconscious or writhing in pain with fractured skulls or broken shoulders. In <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes</b> the ground was quilted with bodies. Great patches of blood widened on their white clothes. The survivors without breaking ranks silently and doggedly marched on until struck down....Finally the police became enraged by the non-resistance....They commenced savagely kicking the seated men in the abdomen and testicles. The injured men writhed and squealed in agony, which seemed to inflame the fury of the police....The police then began dragging the sitting men by the arms or feet, sometimes for a hundred yards, and throwing them into ditches.|$|E
50|$|All {{branches}} are terminating in cone-like inflorescences, 1.5-3 cm long. Cymes {{consist of}} (<b>two</b> <b>or)</b> <b>three</b> <b>minute</b> flowers that are sunk in the axil of each opposite bract. The bisexual flowers are free. The connate tepals {{are reduced to}} a minute membranous lobe or sometimes absent, especially in fruit. There is only one stamen and an ovary with two stigmas.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 11 mm. The forewings are pale stone grey with minute sprinkling of tawny fuscous, especially across the apical {{fourth of the}} wing, at the commencement {{of which is a}} minute ochreous costal spot and another opposite to it on the dorsum, the latter encircled above by tawny fuscous scales. Along the termen are <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minute</b> groups of black scales. The hindwings are pale stone grey.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 13 mm {{for males and}} 16 mm for females. The forewings are ochreous-brownish with the plical and second discal stigmata minute and dark fuscous. There are small fine oblique marks of fuscous irroration from the costa about one-third and the middle, as well as very fine linear interneural blackish marginal marks around the posterior part of the costa and apex, and <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minute</b> dots on the termen. The hindwings are dark grey.|$|R
5|$|The C5 {{is powered}} by a 12-volt {{lead-acid}} electric battery driving a motor with a continuous rating of 250 watts and a maximum speed of 4,100 revolutions per minute. It is coupled with a two-stage gear-drive that increases torque by a factor of 13, without which the motor {{would not be able to}} move the vehicle when a person is on board. However, the motor is vulnerable to overheating. The torque increases as the load on the vehicle increases, for instance by going up too steep a gradient. Sinclair's tests showed that it could cope under power with a maximum slope of 1 in 12 (8%) and could manage a 1 in 7 (14%) slope using the pedals. As the speed of the motor reduces, the current flow through its windings increases, drawing up to 140 amps at stall speed. This would very quickly burn the motor out if sustained, so the motor's load is constantly monitored by the C5's electronics. If it stalls under full load the electronics disable the motor after 4 seconds, while if it is under heavy load (around 80 or 90 amps) it trips after <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes.</b> A heat-sensitive resistor inside the motor warns the driver if the vehicle is beginning to overheat and disconnects the motor after a short time, and a third line of defence is provided by a metallic strip mounted on the motor. If an excessive temperature is reached the strip distorts and the power is disconnected.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} start of the action, monitor Tecumseh moved past the fort and toward Tennessee, {{apparently}} in obedience to that part of her orders. Commander Tunis A. M. Craven either disregarded or forgot the instruction to stay to the east of the minefield, so he took his ship directly across. Almost immediately, a torpedo went off under her hull, and she filled with water and sank in <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes.</b> Only 21 of her crew of 114 were saved. Craven was among those lost, so he could not explain his decisions.|$|E
25|$|Shortly before 11:00a.m., {{the event}} went on an {{unscheduled}} break {{due to a}} technical problem. At 10:58a.m. PST, Farook and Malik, armed with semi-automatic pistols and rifles, fired five shots, killing two people outside the building. Farook then entered a minute later and opened fire on those in attendance, followed quickly by Malik. They wore ski masks and black tactical gear (including load-bearing vests holding magazines and ammunition), but not ballistic or bulletproof vests. The entire shooting took <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes,</b> during which the shooters fired more than 100 bullets before fleeing.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on Shorea materialis. They {{mine the}} leaves of their host plant. The mine starts as a linear gallery {{occurring}} on the lower surface of the leaf and running mostly along leaf-veins. When it reaches the leaf-margin, it is broadened along the margin to form an elongate blotch. When full-grown, the mining part of the leaf is folded downward. Pupation takes place outside of the mine. The cocoon is boat shaped, ochreous in colour, and covered by <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minute</b> bubbles on the upper surface.|$|R

50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 14 mm. The forewings are white sprinkled fuscous, the costal edge blackish towards the base, there is minute blackish costal dot near the base. The stigmata are black, the discal moderate, remote, the plical small, obliquely beyond the first discal, a small blackish dot {{at the end}} of the fold, slightly before the second discal. There is an inwards-oblique triangular blotch of fuscous suffusion from the costa at three-fourths, its apex touching the second discal. There are <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minute</b> black dots near before the lower part of the termen. The hindwings are pale grey.|$|R
25|$|The Ronde, in {{its first}} decades, {{followed}} the general rule that each racer was responsible for his own problems. Help from others was banned and riders carried spare tyres looped round their shoulders to cope with punctures. It could take <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes</b> to change and inflate a tyre, longer if it was cold or there were other problems. Tyres weighed around 500g (compared to currently around 200g). A rim or {{any other part of}} the bike that broke spelled the end of the race and still left the rider with the problem of getting to the finish.|$|E
25|$|From 1977 {{served in}} Northern Ireland both as {{intelligence}} officer and, after attending Staff College, Camberley and promotion to major on 30 September 1981, company commander of A Company 1 CHESHIRE, with an intermediate period spent at RMA Sandhurst as an instructor. During {{his time in}} Northern Ireland he was the Incident Commander at the Droppin Well bombing in Ballykelly which killed seventeen people. Stewart heard the explosion and arrived at the scene <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes</b> later. Six of the dead soldiers were from his company, including his clerk and storeman. He received a personal commendation from the General commanding in Northern Ireland for his actions on the day.|$|E
25|$|James Mahon, an apothecary, gave {{evidence}} that he lived {{at the corner of}} Bow Street. Coming through the piazzas in Covent-Garden, he heard two pistols go off. Going back, he saw a gentleman lying on the ground, with a pistol in his left hand, beating himself violently and bleeding copiously. The prisoner was the gentleman. Mahon had taken the pistol away from him and given it to the constable, asking him to take the prisoner to his house for the wound to be dressed. He had seen nothing of the lady until <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes</b> later he saw her lying at the bar, with a mortal wound, and said he could not help her.|$|E
5000|$|In Naked City's {{characteristic}} early style, {{songs were}} often performed at astonishingly fast tempos, drawing on thrash metal and hardcore punk's emphasis on extreme speed. Many songs were quite brief, and typically switched musical genres every few measures. One critic described the band's music as [...] "jump-cutting micro-collages of hardcore, country, sleazy jazz, covers of John Barry and Ornette Coleman, brief abstract tussles — a whole city crammed into <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minute</b> bursts". This fast-change tendency was inspired {{in part by}} Carl Stalling — a Zorn favorite — who wrote music for many Warner Brothers cartoons, that featured frequent shifts in tempo, theme and style.|$|R
60|$|Cirri, {{extremely}} long, but slightly curled, {{capable of}} being protruded so as almost to touch {{the base of the}} peduncle or the surface of attachment; segments short, extraordinarily numerous. In the three posterior cirri (excepting the rudimentary rami), each segment supports two long, slightly serrated spines, with <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minute</b> intermediate ones, and with one <b>or</b> <b>two</b> very short, thick spines on the inner and upper lateral margins: dorsal tufts with only <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> long, fine, unequal spines. All the segments are extremely flat, broad, short, with their anterior faces not protuberant; the greater number of the segments, especially the lower ones, have very obscure articulations, to be seen only with a high power, and these can be capable of little or no movement.|$|R
60|$|Cirri.--In {{the three}} {{posterior}} pair, the segments have their bristles {{arranged in a}} transverse row, either {{in the form of}} a narrow brush, or consisting only of a single pair with <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minute,</b> intermediate, and lateral marginal spines. The anterior ramus of the second cirrus is thicker, and more thickly clothed with spines than is the posterior ramus: this latter ramus, however, and both rami of the third cirrus, are rather more thickly clothed with spines than are the three posterior pair. The unique case in A. cornuta of the inner rami of the fifth and sixth cirri being rudimentary (Pl. X, fig. 28) will be minutely described under that species.|$|R
25|$|After {{the above}} process, the yerba may be brewed. If the straw is {{inserted}} into dry yerba, the mate {{must first be}} filled once with cool water as above, then be allowed to absorb it completely (which generally takes no more than <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes).</b> Treating the yerba with cool water before the addition of hot water is essential, as it protects the yerba mate from being scalded and from the chemical breakdown {{of some of its}} desirable nutrients. Hot water may then be added by carefully pouring it, as with the cool water before, into the cavity opposite the yerba, until it reaches almost {{to the top of the}} gourd when the yerba is fully saturated. Care should be taken to maintain the dryness of the swollen top of the yerba beside the edge of the gourd's opening.|$|E
25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of Sunday 30 May, Ciudad de Barcelona was {{off the coast of}} Malgrat, about 60 kilometres north of Barcelona. She was spotted by the Italian submarine General Sanjuro, which was under the command of captain Pablo Suances Jaudenes. The submarine was originally named Torricelli and transferred to the Spanish nationalist navy in April 1937. General Sanjuro was seeking revenge for the Germans, as the cruiser Deutschland was hit by the Republican airplanes in the port of Ibiza a week earlier. The attack killed 31 German sailors. The submarine launched two torpedoes. The first one missed and landed to the beach of Lloret de Mar. Captain Nadal tried a desperate maneuver by turning Ciudad de Barcelona towards Malgrat, in order to save the passengers, but at 6 PM she was hit by another torpedo which exploded in the engine room. At the time, the ship was only 400 metres off the shore. Ciudad de Barcelona sank rapidly, in just <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes.</b>|$|E
500|$|Just after 3pm, {{minutes after}} the lunch had ended, the Yugoslav Air Force {{attacked}} the Banski dvori and other targets in the Gornji Grad area of Zagreb {{and elsewhere in the}} Croatian capital city, <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes</b> after everyone had left the hall where the lunch was hosted. Zagreb was attacked by approximately 30 Yugoslav jets, however the Gornji Grad raid was carried out by two Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21s carrying eight Munja [...] unguided missiles each and two Soko G-4 Super Galebs carrying two Mark 82 bombs each. The Banski dvori building was struck by the Mark 82 bombs set off by proximity fuzes [...] above the target, scoring two direct hits.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 13 mm. The forewings are dark fuscous sprinkled with grey-whitish {{and with the}} stigmata round, moderate and blackish, the plical somewhat beyond the first discal. There is a small irregular white spot on the costa before the middle, {{and one on the}} dorsum beyond the middle, as well as cloudy whitish dots below the plical stigma, and above and below the second discal. The costal edge at three-fourths, and some scattered scales beneath it are white and there is a nearly straight blackish line from the costa beyond this to the termen above the tornus, as well as an interrupted blackish line around the apical portion of the costa and termen, preceded by <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minute</b> cloudy whitish dots. The hindwings are dark bronzy-fuscous.|$|R
60|$|Another {{plant was}} {{placed under the}} same small bell-glass with three drops of chloroform, and before two minutes had elapsed, the tentacles began to curl inwards with rapid little jerks. The glass was then removed, {{and in the course}} of <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> {{additional}} <b>minutes</b> almost every tentacle reached the centre. On several other occasions the vapour did not excite any movement of this kind.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 13 mm. The forewings are white, the dorsal half tinged with brownish {{and with a}} fine dark fuscous median dash near the base. The stigmata are moderate and dark fuscous, the plical rather obliquely beyond the first discal, a short oblique streak above and before the first discal pointing to it. There is an undefined patch of fuscous suffusion extending along the anterior half of the dorsum and touching the plical stigma. There are oblique transverse dark fuscous lines from the costa at the middle and three-fourths, the first straight, irregular, interrupted in the disc, nearly preceding the second discal stigma, the second curved on the lower half, the dorsal half between these forming a fuscous blotch becoming dark fuscous anteriorly. There are three pre-marginal black dots on the apical part of the costa, the lowest largest, and <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minute</b> and undefined ones on the termen. The hindwings are ochreous-whitish, suffused light grey posteriorly with a fringe of long raised ochreous-whitish hairs along the lower margin of the cell and basal half of vein two.|$|R
500|$|Novgorod {{was armed}} with two 20-calibre 11-inch rifled muzzle-loading guns. The guns could {{penetrate}} 11 inches of armour {{at a range}} of their [...] shells had a muzzle velocity of [...] Their rate of fire was very slow, about one round every 10 minutes. The guns were mounted on separate revolving turntables that could be moved independently or locked together. Each turntable took about <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes</b> to rotate 180°. Gunnery trials in November 1874 showed that the locks for the turntables were too weak; {{so much so that}} the gun's recoil could cause them to rotate, leading to the persistent myth that the whole ship rotated when a gun fired. Reinforcement of the locks solved the problem, but the myth persisted.|$|E
500|$|At 22:30 the fog {{lifted and}} Kouma {{saw that a}} North Korean pontoon bridge was being laid across the river {{directly}} in front of his position. Kouma's four vehicles attacked this structure, with Kouma manning the M2 Browning [...]50-caliber machine gun atop the tank. As the gunner fired the tank's main cannon, Kouma sank many of the boats attempting to cross the river with his machine gun. At 23:00 a small arms fight flared around the left side of A Company north of the tanks. This gunfire had lasted only <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes</b> when the A Company roadblock squads near the tanks heard over the field telephone that the company was withdrawing and that they should do likewise. Kouma instead opted to act as a rearguard to cover the infantry. He was wounded shortly thereafter in the foot reloading the tank's ammunition. He quickly fought off another North Korean attack across the river with his machine gun.|$|E
500|$|In early 2003, [...] {{while in}} Los Angeles {{and before they}} met with {{producer}} Gregg Hoffman, Hoffman's friend pulled him {{into his office and}} showed him the short. Hoffman said, [...] "About <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes</b> into it, my jaw hit the floor." [...] He quickly showed the short and script to his partners Mark Burg and Oren Koules of Evolution Entertainment. They later formed Twisted Pictures as a horror genre production label. The producers read the screenplay that night and two days later offered Wan and Whannell creative control and 25% of the net profits. Even though Wan and Whannell received [...] "better offers" [...] from studios like DreamWorks and Gold Circle Films, they were not willing to chance Wan's directing and Whannell acting in the lead role. In order to finance the film, Hoffman, Burg, and Koules put up a second mortgage on their Highland Avenue headquarters. Saw was given a production budget of between $1 million and $1.2 million.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 9 mm. The forewings are leaden-grey, finely sprinkled with whitish with black dots beneath the fold before one-fourth {{and before the}} middle. The costal edge is black from the base to a minute black strigula at one-fifth {{and there are two}} adjacent flattened-triangular black costal patches extending from about one-third to four-fifths, separated by an oblique whitish strigula. There are <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> indistinct <b>minute</b> black pre-marginal dots near the termen. The hindwings are dark fuscous.|$|R
60|$|The brig was now {{floating}} fast, {{with the}} tide, up {{abreast of the}} east end of Blackwell's, and in <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> more <b>minutes</b> she would be fairly in the Gate. Spike was aft, where he could command a view of everything forward, and Mulford stood on the quarter-deck, to look after the head-braces. An old and trustworthy seaman, who acted as a sort of boatswain, had the charge on the forecastle, and was to tend the sheets and tack. His name was Rove.|$|R
60|$|Two {{big ones}} showed their heads among the pads some twenty feet apart. Pushing up {{so as to}} make a {{triangle}} with my canoe, I dangled a red ibis impartially between them.

Then one seemed to wake suddenly from a trance, or to be touched by an electric wire, for he came scrambling in a desperate hurry over the lily pads. Swimming was too slow; he jumped fiercely out of water at the red challenge, making a great splash and commotion.|$|R
500|$|On 4 November 1918, {{the whole}} of No.80 Wing RAF—of which No.4 Squadron was part—took to the sky {{in an effort to}} [...] "harass the German retreat on the Leuze-Ath road" [...] and to bomb the aerodrome to the east of Leuze. A {{formation}} of Sopwith Snipes from No.4 Squadron had been utilised as an escort when the initial raid was carried out, and then to protect the bombers as they returned to the Allied lines. However, when the Australians had executed the latter duty, they were tailed by a patrol of twelve Fokkers. After seeing the bombers off, the Snipes wheeled around to confront the German aircraft. The battle raged for <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes</b> before dying out. As the Snipes re-grouped, they discovered that three pilots were missing; Baker was among the three. Baker and fellow ace Lieutenant Arthur Palliser were initially recorded as missing, but were later found to have fallen victim to Rittmeister Karl Bolle during the battle.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{arriving}} in the NBA, Javie developed a reputation early for having a [...] "quick trigger finger", and he {{was believed to be}} one of the league leaders in calling technical fouls during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Reflecting on his early years in the league, Javie told Sports Illustrated in October 2000, [...] "I'd get so mad I'd lose control for <b>two</b> <b>or</b> <b>three</b> <b>minutes,</b> and that's when I would miss calls." [...] Javie developed mentorships with referees Joe Crawford and Jack Madden to assist in the maturation process. [...] Working his debut game with Crawford at the Pontiac Silverdome in Detroit, Michigan, Javie received a grade of 40 points out of 100 by supervisor Darell Garretson. [...] While reviewing game film later at the hotel, Crawford noted errors made throughout the game by himself. [...] As a result of this film study, Javie learned that experienced officials make mistakes and admitting error will improve a referee's ability in the long-term. Ninety minutes after the conclusion of a game, Javie reviews game film. [...] In addition to film review, Madden taught Javie not to lose focus when players and coaches were upset, and to walk away from them rather than becoming angry. [...] Javie credited his mentors for success as a referee saying, [...] "My mentors have made me what I am today. I'm a little part of each of them. It's their success in teaching me." ...|$|E
