5|$|His regents, Armansperg and Rundhart, {{established}} a controversial policy of suppressing the monasteries. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> upsetting to the Church hierarchy. Russia was self-considered as stalwart defender of Orthodoxy but Orthodox believers {{were found in}} all three parties. Once he rid himself of his Bavarian advisers, Otto allowed the statutory dissolution of the monasteries to lapse.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, eight {{main line}} {{railways}} existed in Berlin, with terminal stations at the city's edge {{or outside the}} city limits. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> impractical for many passengers, who were forced to use hackney carriages to transfer from one train to another. Therefore, a railway line was planned to connect these terminuses with each other.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, Glenn T. Seaborg {{established}} that when thorium was bombarded with neutrons, {{it could be}} transformed into fissile uranium-233. This was another possible route to an atomic bomb, especially if {{it turned out that}} uranium-233 could be more easily separated from thorium than plutonium from uranium. It was not pursued further because uranium-233 production would have required a complete redesign of the Hanford reactors; but in April 1944 the Metallurgical Laboratory's Thorfin R. Rogness calculated that a nuclear reactor containing thorium could produce enough uranium-233 to sustain its reaction without adding anything but more thorium. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> interesting, because {{at the time it was}} thought that uranium might be scarce, whereas thorium was at least ten times more plentiful.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after her}} sister Marie {{was married to}} Crown Prince Ferdinand of Romania, a search was made for a {{suitable}} husband for Victoria. Her visit to her grandmother Queen Victoria at Balmoral Castle {{in the autumn of}} 1891 coincided with a visit by her cousin Prince Ernest Louis of Hesse, heir to the grand ducal throne of Hesse. Both were artistic and fun loving, got along well and even shared a birthday. The Queen, observing <b>this,</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> keen for her two grandchildren to marry.|$|E
5|$|In the 1964 renumbering, the {{legislative}} designation {{was changed to}} Route 680. SR 17 was officially moved to former Route 5 between San Jose and Warm Springs, which {{had not had a}} signed designation since the Nimitz Freeway (then I-680) was constructed, but this was instead marked as part of SR 238 (which replaced SR 9 north of Mission San Jose), and SR 17 remained signed along the Nimitz Freeway. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> short-lived, as the Bureau of Public Roads approved a shift in the south end of I-680 in October 1964. The legislature changed the routes in 1965, swapping Routes 17 and 680 south of Warm Springs, and creating a new SR 262 on the short roadway at Warm Springs where they had overlapped to switch sides. However, until I-680 was completed in the early-to-mid 1970s, it remained signed along the Nimitz Freeway, and the old road between San Jose and Warm Springs continued to be marked as SR 238. One more change was made to the routing of I-680: in July 1973, the remainder of SR 21, from Benicia to Fairfield, was added to the Interstate Highway System. This became the new alignment of I-680, and the old route to Vallejo became I-780. The corresponding changes were made by the state legislature in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Mladen {{and other}} members of the Tuzla group were sent to the prison in Zenica. Three months after they were sentenced they were joined by Ilić, whose death penalty had been {{commuted}} to 20 years' imprisonment. In the Zenica prison, each convict had to spend the first three months in solitary confinement. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> hard on Mladen, who became mentally unwell and became so emaciated that Ilić could hardly recognise him. He recovered and took a course in shoe-making which was given in the prison. Afterwards, he fell seriously ill and had to undergo surgery in the prison hospital. In late 1917, the Austrian authorities pardoned all convicts of the Tuzla group except Ilić. Mladen went to his family in Prijedor. After a medical examination, he was declared unfit for army service due to his surgery and as a result was not drafted into the Austrian army. He entered the School of Medicine, University of Zagreb, shortly before the disintegration of Austria-Hungary in November 1918.|$|E

The lecture continued for about one hour, with only brief intervals. After the humiliating session, the First Officer remained mostly silent {{throughout the rest of the}} flight, likely from a loss of self esteem and confidence. Subsequently, the First Officer did not challenge the Captain over any of his errors or violations.|$|E
25|$|By May 1863 Bahá'u'lláh was exiled next to Constantinople, {{the capital}} of the Ottoman Empire, and his family went with him.

After a short while in Constantinople the family was again exiled to Adrianople. Bahíyyih Khánum describes how she was a strong young woman until the journey to Adrianople. Adrianople proved a very unhappy period for the young Bahíyyih Khánum.|$|E

25|$|Dr Krapf {{also noted}} that the rivers flowing from Mt Kenya, and other {{mountains}} in the area, were continuously flowing. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> different from the other rivers in the area, which swelled up in the wet season and completely dried up after the rainy season had ended. As the streams flowed even in the driest seasons he concluded that there must be a source of water up on the mountain, in the form of glaciers. He believed the mountain to be the source of the White Nile.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the early}} 1990s, {{any notion of}} lesbian love in a film almost always {{required}} audiences to infer the relationships. The lesbian aesthetic of Queen Christina (1933) with Greta Garbo has been widely noted, even though the film is not about lesbians. Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca (1940), {{based on the novel}} by Daphne du Maurier, referred more or less overtly to lesbianism, but the two characters involved were not presented positively: Mrs. Danvers was portrayed as obsessed, neurotic and murderous, while the never-seen Rebecca was described as having been selfish, spiteful and doomed to die. All About Eve (1950) was originally written with the title character as a lesbian but <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> subtle in the final version, with the hint and message apparent to alert viewers.|$|E
