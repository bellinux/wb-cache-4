5|$|In {{the final}} chapter Stace looks at mysticism and logic. He returns {{to the idea that}} {{theology}} and mystical philosophies (he gives the examples of Vedanta, Spinoza, Hegel, and Bradley) will always contain contradictions. Known as the doctrine of the Mystery of God, he maintains this is because the intellect is inherently incapable of understanding the Ultimate. All attempts <b>to</b> <b>state</b> <b>the</b> nature of the ultimate necessarily produce contradictions.|$|E
5|$|Experimentation by Faraday in 1831 {{revealed}} that a wire moving perpendicular to a magnetic field developed a potential difference between its ends. Further analysis of this process, known as electromagnetic induction, enabled him <b>to</b> <b>state</b> <b>the</b> principle, now known as Faraday's law of induction, that the potential difference induced in a closed circuit {{is proportional to the}} rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop. Exploitation of this discovery enabled him to invent the first electrical generator in 1831, in which he converted the mechanical energy of a rotating copper disc to electrical energy. Faraday's disc was inefficient and of no use as a practical generator, but it showed the possibility of generating electric power using magnetism, a possibility that would be taken up by those that followed on from his work.|$|E

5000|$|The powers not {{delegated}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United <b>States</b> by <b>the</b> Constitution, nor {{prohibited by}} it <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>States,</b> are reserved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>States</b> respectively, or <b>to</b> <b>the</b> people. The Tenth Amendment reinforces {{the principles of}} separation of powers and federalism by providing that powers not granted {{to the federal government}} by the Constitution, nor prohibited <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states,</b> are reserved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states</b> or <b>the</b> people. The amendment provides no new powers or rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>states,</b> but rather preserves their authority in all matters not specifically granted to the federal government.|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{after taking}} power, the extremist {{leaders of the}} {{revolution}} had begun constructing fortifications on Eetioneia, a dominant point in {{the entrance to the}} harbor of Piraeus, ostensibly to protect the harbor against an attack from the fleet at Samos. With internal dissent increasing, they joined these new fortifications to existing walls to form a redoubt defensible against attacks from land or sea, which contained a large warehouse into which the extremists moved most of the city's grain supply. Theramenes protested strongly against the building of this fortification, arguing that its purpose was not to keep the democrats out, but to be handed over to the Spartans; Thucydides testifies that his charges were not without substance, as the extremists were actually contemplating such an action. Initially cautious (as enemies of the regime had been executed before), Theramenes and his party were emboldened and galvanized into action by several events. First, a Peloponnesian fleet, ostensibly dispatched to assist anti-Athenian forces on Euboea, was moving slowly up the coast of the Peloponnese; Theramenes charged that this fleet was planning to seize the fortifications on Eetioneia, in collaboration with the extremists. Second, an Athenian militiaman, apparently acting on orders from conspirators higher in the ranks of the government, assassinated Phrynichus, the leader of the extremist faction. He escaped, but his accomplice, an Argive, was captured; the prisoner, under torture, refused <b>to</b> <b>state</b> <b>the</b> name of his employer. With the extremists unable to take effective action in this case, and with the Peloponnesian fleet overrunning Aegina (a logical stopping point on the approach to Piraeus), Theramenes and his party decided to act.|$|E
5|$|The Cascade Range was {{produced}} by convergence of the North American Plate with the subducting Juan de Fuca Plate. Active volcanism has taken place for approximately 36million years; the nearby Challis Range features complexes as old as 55 mya. Most geologists believe that activity in the Cascades has been relatively intermittent, producing up to 3,000 volcanic calderas at a time. Frequent volcanism within the last 10,000years created complexes from Mount Garibaldi in British Columbia to north California's Lassen Peak complex. Remarkably different from state <b>to</b> <b>state,</b> <b>the</b> volcanism ranges from large volcanoes to zones of many smaller geologic features such as lava shields and cinder cones. TheCascadevolcanoes are divided into two large sectors, called the High Cascades and the Western Cascades; Thielsen {{is part of the}} High Cascades, which are east of the Western Cascades.|$|E
5|$|Zwingli {{was obliged}} <b>to</b> <b>state</b> <b>the</b> {{terms of the}} armistice. He demanded the {{dissolution}} of the Christian Alliance; unhindered preaching by reformers in the Catholic states; prohibition of the pension system; payment of war reparations; and compensation to the children of Jacob Kaiser. Manuel was involved in the negotiations. Bern was not prepared to insist on the unhindered preaching or the prohibition of the pension system. Zurich and Bern could not agree and the Five (Catholic) States pledged only to dissolve their alliance with Austria. This was a bitter disappointment for Zwingli and it marked his decline in political influence. The first Land Peace of Kappel, der erste Landfriede, ended the war on 24 June.|$|E

In Norway, there were supporters and opponents in all the parties. The debate took ten hours, and even among those who were in favor were skeptical. The proposal passed with 107 against 26 votes. The proposal was passed unanimously by the Parliament of Sweden.|$|E

25|$|British Conservative Party Member of Parliament Charlie Elphicke {{published}} research on October 30, 2012, {{which showed that}} some multinational companies, including Apple Inc., were making billions of pounds of profit in the UK, but were paying an effective tax rate to the UK Treasury of only 3 percent, well below standard corporation tax. He followed this research by calling on the Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne to force these multinationals, which also included Google and The Coca-Cola Company, <b>to</b> <b>state</b> <b>the</b> effective rate of tax they pay on their UK revenues. Elphicke also said that government contracts should be withheld from multinationals who do not {{pay their fair share}} of UK tax.|$|E
25|$|Elections to the Senate {{are held}} on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November in even-numbered years, Election Day, and {{coincide}} with elections for the House of Representatives. Senators are elected by their state as a whole. In most states (since 1970), a primary election is held first for the Republican and Democratic parties, with the general election following a few months later. Ballot access rules for independent and minor party candidates vary from state <b>to</b> <b>state.</b> <b>The</b> winner is often the candidate who receives a plurality of the popular vote. In some states, runoffs are held if no candidate wins a majority.|$|E
25|$|Stylistically, Anselm's treatises {{take two}} basic forms, dialogues and {{sustained}} meditations. In both, he strove <b>to</b> <b>state</b> <b>the</b> rational grounds for central aspects of Christian doctrines as a pedagogical exercise for his initial audience of fellow monks and correspondents. The subjects of Anselm's works were sometimes dictated by contemporary events, {{such as his}} speech at the Council of Bari or the need to refute his association with the thinking of Roscelin, but he intended for his books to form a unity, with his letters and latter works advising the reader to consult his other books for the arguments supporting various points in his reasoning. It {{seems to have been}} a recurring problem that early drafts of his works were copied and circulated without his permission.|$|E

25|$|In China, the {{practice}} of acupuncture is regulated by the Chinese Medicine Council that was formed in 1999 by the Legislative Council. It includes a licensing exam and registration, as well as degree courses approved by the board. Canada has acupuncture licensing programs in the provinces of British Columbia, Ontario, Alberta and Quebec; standards set by the Chinese Medicine and Acupuncture Association of Canada are used in provinces without government regulation. Regulation in the US began in the 1970s in California, which was eventually followed by every state but Wyoming and Idaho. Licensing requirements vary greatly from state <b>to</b> <b>state.</b> <b>The</b> needles used in acupuncture are regulated in the US by the Food and Drug Administration. In some states acupuncture is regulated by a board of medical examiners, while in others {{by the board of}} licensing, health or education.|$|E
25|$|Act Two {{begins with}} fitness queen, Brooke Wyndham, and her fitness team's workout video, {{which is being}} viewed by Elle, Callahan, Emmett, Vivienne, Warner, and Enid ("Whipped Into Shape"). Callahan tells the legal team that Brooke is accused of murdering her billionaire husband. At the jail, the legal team are unable to get Brooke to tell them her alibi and refuses to plead guilty. Upon {{learning}} that they were both Delta Nu sisters, Brooke then privately tells Elle her alibi that she was getting liposuction, but makes Elle promise not to tell anyone ("Delta Nu Nu Nu"). Because of Elle's loyalty to her client and refusal <b>to</b> <b>state</b> <b>the</b> alibi, Elle and Emmett are shunned by the group. To cheer Emmett up and to increase his chances of impressing Callahan, Elle gives him a makeover ("Take It Like A Man").|$|E
