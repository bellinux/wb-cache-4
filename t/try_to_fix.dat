5|$|Affeldt's final {{start of}} the year came on July 23, in a game he won against Minnesota. After the start, the Royals moved him to the bullpen to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> his blister problems. The move was {{originally}} thought to be temporary. While in the bullpen, on August 3, he got his career first save in a 20 win over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. On August 21, the Royals announced that Affeldt would {{spend the rest of the}} year in the bullpen. Two days later, he got another save against Minnesota. He picked up two more saves before the end of the year and finished with a 76 record and a 3.93 ERA. After the season, to try to help with his blister problems, he had part of a fingernail on the middle finger of his left hand removed. Also, the Royals announced that if he developed blister problems again, he would be sent to the bullpen for good.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{the effort}} to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> the problems, MIM {{installed}} some column flotation cells in the zinc concentrate and bulk concentrate sections of the plant. In those days, the air was introduced into flotation columns using air spargers, usually {{in the form of a}} bag or sheath around a pipe. The spargers were high-maintenance items, and their performance was critical to the operation of the column.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the fire}} is built, {{the next step is}} to light the tinder, using either an {{ignition}} device such as a match or a lighter. A reasonably skillful fire-builder using reasonably good material only needs one match. The tinder burns brightly, but be reduced to glowing embers within half a minute. If the kindling does not catch fire, the fire-builder must gather more tinder, determine what went wrong and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> it.|$|E

500|$|The message {{throughout}} the song, in which Martin sings, is words of encouragement: [...] "Lights will guide you home / And ignite your bones / And I will <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> you." [...] Michele Hatty of USA Weekend reported that Martin sings about recovering from grief in the song. Travis Gass of the Bangor Daily News wrote that Martin offers his sympathies for the downtrodden, with [...] "When you love someone {{but it goes}} to waste / Could it be worse?".|$|E
500|$|The song {{has been}} used on the final {{sequences}} of the episode [...] "I'll <b>Try</b> <b>to</b> <b>Fix</b> You" [...] of the 2012 HBO's television series The Newsroom, {{as well as an}} episode of Scrubs, and the final scene of the episode [...] "Cargo" [...] of the CBS series Cold Case. The song also briefly featured in the Australian family drama Packed to the Rafters. In 2013, [...] "Fix You" [...] was used in the final episode of the first season of British public television Channel 4's comedy-drama Derek. [...] "Fix You" [...] was played during an episode of Brothers & Sisters.|$|E

500|$|Another {{recurrent}} {{theme in}} the album is that everything is broken, out of place or missing; This is apparent in nearly all songs in the album. Examples include [...] "Fix You" [...] ("When you lose something you can't replace") and also in [...] "X" [...] ("When something is broken, and you <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> it, trying to repair it, any way you can") and [...] "Talk" [...] ("Are you lost or incomplete? Do {{you feel like a}} puzzle, you can't find your missing piece?"). This theme is also reflective of the random, incomprehensible pattern on the album's cover (until you [...] "fix" [...] it using the Baudot Code).|$|E
500|$|Classification for {{swimming}} {{relied on a}} points system to assess the severity of physical disability without considering athlete functionality specifically as it applied {{to the ability to}} swim a particular stroke. This caused problems because certain types of disability had a greater negative impact on swimming than others, and the point system did not directly address functional ability. [...] To address this, in 1990 point consideration was eliminated for disability types that did not impact performance. The IPC decided {{to reduce the number of}} classifications, and to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> classification so that competitors could have more certainty in which classification they would compete in before attending an event. This was a major change, as previously, athletes would be classified immediately before, and even during, an event. As a result, the number of swimming classifications dropped from 31 at Seoul in 1988 to 10 at the 1992 Summer Paralympics in [...] Barcelona.|$|E

On Babe's reasons for revealing the secret, Badland explained, [...] "She's not sure where she stands, but she's desperate to get back inside the family. She loves Mick so much she wants to be around him. Linda and Mick have hurt her and you mustn't do that... Babe can get very upset!" [...] Abi consequently reveals that Babe encouraged her to have a one-night stand, which causes Mick and Linda to reject Babe. However, after she is attacked, Mick and Linda <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> their relationship with Babe. Of Mick and Linda making amends with Babe, Badland explained, [...] "Although it might appear on the surface the Carters have forgiven her for playing a part in Abi's fake pregnancy lie and encouraging her to sleep with Lee, there could be repercussions further down the line." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Mountain of Madness" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder, {{although}} the script underwent many rewrites. According to Josh Weinstein, [...] "a Swartzwelder script is like a finely tooled crazy German machine {{and if you have}} the wrong engineers <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> it, it blows up. And that's the thing, 'cause it had great jokes but we sort of changed the story and went through a bunch of drafts." [...] The story was completely rewritten and as a result, the plot became odder and quirkier with the scenes of paranoia deriving from this. The original script was [...] "really crazy" [...] {{but a lot of the}} more insane material was cut. However, most of the rewrites were done during the script-writing and did not require any major animation changes. One change was the ending, which was added after the animatic. The episode features several pairings of established characters who had previously interacted little, such as Waylon Smithers with Bart and Lisa. Weinstein feels that this was one of the first episodes to really feature the duo of Lenny Leonard and Carl Carlson and developed them more.|$|E
500|$|Everyone {{is pleased}} to welcome the new {{neighbours}} at first, but things soon get out of control. [...] The new bears unwittingly make a huge mess of everything (especially when the huge mansion they asked for causes pollution). Then, after a confrontation with them at a picnic ("Get a Lot") Wish Bear accidentally wishes Twinkers away to the new bears; they soon abuse the star's power with an amusement park focusing on Me Bear, a mud pie for Messy Bear, and a huge noisy motorcycle for Too Loud Bear. [...] Once the new bears finally realise their problem, they <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> it with more wishes, but to no availCare-a-lot becomes a blank white space (wishing {{that all of this}} was gone), the bears begin to glow in color (wishing for everything to be back how it was, but with more color), Grumpy Bear turns black and white (wishing for less color), and Messy Bear turns into Messy Cub (wishing for everything to be like it used to be). [...] When they try to wish Twinkers back to Wish Bear, the star ultimately loses his power from exhaustion (because they had been pushing him much too hard). [...] Wish Bear uses Grumpy Bear's rocket to bring him to the Big Wish, a grandmother star, in the sky. Big Wish restores his power, but not before Wish Bear assures her that she has learned her lesson, which is wishing is fun, but it is far more important to work hard to achieve your dreams.|$|E

2500|$|Nevertheless, those {{voting on}} the bill were later {{surprised}} by the reaction it gained. [...] State Representative Michele Reagan reflected three months later: [...] "The majority of us who voted yes on that bill, myself included, did not expect or encourage an outcry from the public. The majority of us just voted for it because {{we thought we could}} <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> the problem. Nobody envisioned boycotts. Nobody anticipated the emotion, the prayer vigils. The attitude was: These are the laws, let's start following them." [...] State Representative Kyrsten Sinema, the assistant House minority leader who tried to stop the bill and voted against it, similarly reflected: [...] "I knew it would be bad, but no one thought it would be this big. No one." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{shutting}} of Harvard’s {{gates has}} determined {{the character of}} the protest and the criticism made against it. [...] Whereas Occupy Boston has attracted all kinds of wild characters, the atmosphere at Occupy Harvard is calm and polite. [...] The occupiers are almost invariably well-groomed and articulate. [...] The donation jar took in $130 one day, most of it in $20 bills, and it didn’t disappear when no one had their eye on it. [...] It is, to use a word popular in Dewey Square, [...] "bougy" [...] (fancy, bourgeois). [...] Many holders of Harvard IDs have a decent shot of joining the 1% if they weren’t already born into it. [...] The occupiers in the Yard say this privilege – earned through hard work in many cases, inherited in others – gives them more obligation to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> the system rather than less.|$|E
2500|$|While Andrew Carnegie and Thomas N. Miller {{spent the}} better part of the next year touring Europe, Thomas Carnegie flourished at the Union Iron Mills. The company {{struggled}} financially as the end of the Civil War led to sharp drops in the need for iron products, but Thomas proved to be a warm and friendly executive where his brother was cold and austere. Thomas' ability to make friends allowed the firm to receive numerous contracts and even infusions of capital when needed, and it is unlikely the company would have survived without him. Andrew wrote to Thomas extensively from Europe, constantly criticizing his business decisions, providing him with micromanaging instructions, and generally demeaning him. From Europe, Andrew also badgered Thomas to make improvements to their home in America, and decided to call the rapidly expanding mansion [...] "Fairfield." [...] But Thomas' judgment could prove wiser than Andrew's. In July 1865, Andrew Carnegie became fascinated with the [...] "Dodd process," [...] a new English method of welding steel facing to iron railroad rails, and despite Tom's misgivings he purchased the American patent for the process. But the process proved unworkable, and despite additional investments and retooling of the mill additional rails proved just as brittle and breakable as the first. Thomas advised him to conserve his money, but Andrew purchased yet another steel welding patent to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> the process. That, too, failed and soon Carnegie's steel-welding business was bankrupt. Thomas correctly foresaw that Andrew too easily believed his judgment was infallible, and soon a coal mining process Andrew had purchased also led to significant financial losses.|$|E
