5|$|Hawaiian eruptions are {{responsible}} for several unique volcanological objects. Small volcanic particles are carried and formed by the wind, chilling quickly into <b>teardrop-shaped</b> glassy fragments known as Pele's tears (after Pele, the Hawaiian volcano deity). During especially high winds these chunks may even {{take the form of}} long drawn-out strands, known as Pele's hair. Sometimes basalt aerates into reticulite, the lowest density rock type on earth.|$|E
5|$|Many {{teeth are}} widest at their midsections and narrow {{closer to the}} jaws, giving them the {{appearance}} of a teardrop. <b>Teardrop-shaped</b> teeth are unique to Dimetrodon and other closely related sphenacodontids, and help distinguish them from other early synapsids. As in many other early synapsids, the teeth of most Dimetrodon species are serrated at their edges. The serrations of Dimetrodon teeth were so fine that they resembled tiny cracks. The dinosaur Albertosaurus had similarly crack-like serrations, but, at the base of each serration was a round void, which would have functioned to distribute force over a larger surface area and prevent the stresses of feeding from causing the crack to spread through the tooth. Unlike Albertosaurus, Dimetrodon teeth lacked adaptations that would stop cracks from forming at their serrations. The teeth of D.teutonis lack serrations, but still have sharp edges.|$|E
5|$|The crossback stingaree's {{pectoral}} fin disc is slightly wider than long and oval in shape, with the anterior margins nearly straight and converging {{at a very}} obtuse angle. The snout is fleshy and blunt, generally not protruding from the disc. The eyes are small and immediately followed by <b>teardrop-shaped</b> spiracles, which have rounded to angular posterior rims. The outer rim of each nostril may form a small knob at the back. Between the nostrils is a skirt-shaped curtain of skin with a deeply fringed posterior margin. The mouth is small and strongly arched, containing 36 papillae (nipple-like structures) {{on the floor and}} an additional patch of papillae is present {{on the outside of the}} lower jaw. Both upper and lower teeth are small with roughly oval bases, and are arranged in a quincunx pattern. The five pairs of gill slits are short. The pelvic fins are small, with rounded margins.|$|E
25|$|Brilliant Pebbles was a non-nuclear {{system of}} satellite-based interceptors {{designed}} to use high-velocity, watermelon-sized, <b>teardrop-shaped</b> projectiles made of tungsten as kinetic warheads. It {{was designed to}} operate {{in conjunction with the}} Brilliant Eyes sensor system. The project was conceived in November 1986 by Lowell Wood at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Detailed studies were undertaken by several advisory boards, including the Defense Science Board and JASON, in 1989.|$|E
25|$|Lutes {{are made}} {{almost entirely of}} wood. The {{soundboard}} is a <b>teardrop-shaped</b> thin flat plate of resonant wood (typically spruce). In all lutes the soundboard has a single (sometimes triple) decorated sound hole under the strings called the rose. The sound hole is not open, but rather covered with a grille {{in the form of}} an intertwining vine or a decorative knot, carved directly out of the wood of the soundboard.|$|E
25|$|This sea turtle's dorsoventrally {{flattened}} body {{is covered}} by a large, <b>teardrop-shaped</b> carapace; it has a pair of large, paddle-like flippers. It is usually lightly colored, although in the eastern Pacific populations parts of the carapace can be almost black. Unlike other members of its family, such as the hawksbill sea turtle, C. mydas is mostly herbivorous. The adults usually inhabit shallow lagoons, feeding mostly on various species of seagrasses. The turtles bite off {{the tips of the}} blades of seagrass, which keeps the grass healthy.|$|E
25|$|Laotian Aviation {{officers}} {{received the}} ANL service peaked cap in both light khaki and white-topped versions, which was copied after the French M1927 pattern (French: Casquette d'officier Mle 1927) to wear {{with either the}} light khaki or white service dress uniforms. The peaked caps were worn with the standard gilt metal ANL cap device, a wreathed Airavata crest bearing the Laotian Royal Arms – a three-headed white elephant standing on a pedestal and surmounted by a pointed parasol – set on a black <b>teardrop-shaped</b> background patch.|$|E
25|$|Flight {{testing of}} the prototypes proved to be vice-free and {{required}} only a few modifications to be made. The changes included the installation of a glazed nose to accommodate a bomb-aimer, due to the advanced H2S Mk9 bombing radar not being ready for production, the turbojet engines that powered the type were replaced by the more powerful Rolls-Royce Avon R.A.3s, and distinctive <b>teardrop-shaped</b> fuel tanks were fitted under the wingtips. Refinements were also quickly made following early flight testing to the rudder and elevator to reduce instances of buffeting, after which it is claimed that the Canberra handled much like a fighter, proving to be atypically manoeuvrable for a bomber.|$|E
25|$|The {{differences}} between the two models are the scale length (445mm of free string length in Lisboa guitars and 470mm in Coimbra guitars), body measurements, and other finer construction details. Overall, the Coimbra model is of simpler construction than the Lisboa model. Visually and most distinctively, the Lisboa model can easily be differentiated from the Coimbra model by its larger soundboard and the scroll ornament that usually adorns the tuning machine, in place of Coimbra's <b>teardrop-shaped</b> motif. Lisboa guitars usually employ a narrower neck profile as well. Both models have a very distinct timbre, the Lisboa model having a more bright and resonant sound, and the choice between the both of them falls upon each player's preferences.|$|E
25|$|The {{rack and}} {{internal}} fuel lines for carrying a 300L (80US gal) under-fuselage drop-tank were widely used on G-2s, {{as were the}} underwing 20mm MG 151/20 cannon gondolas. Several G-2s were fitted with the ETC 500 bomb rack, capable of carrying one 250kg (550lb) bomb. The final G-2 production batches built by Erla and Messerschmitt Regensburg were equipped as tropical aircraft (often referred to as G-2 trop), equipped with a sand-filter {{on the front of}} the supercharger intake and two small, <b>teardrop-shaped</b> metal brackets on the left side of the fuselage, below the cockpit sill. These were used as mounts for specially designed sun umbrellas (called Sonderwerkzeug or Special tool), which were used to shade the cockpit.|$|E
25|$|The lobed stingaree has {{a rounded}} {{pectoral}} fin disc much wider than long, with nearly straight leading margins. The snout is fleshy and forms an obtuse angle; the tip may protrude slightly past the disc. The medium-sized eyes {{are followed by}} <b>teardrop-shaped</b> spiracles, which have a rounded posterior margin. The outer posterior corner of each nostril forms a visible lobe. Between the nostrils is a skirt-shaped curtain of skin with a fringed trailing margin; the front corners of the curtain are enlarged into distinctive, semicircular lobes. The mouth is small and contains 910 papillae (nipple-like structures) on the floor; a handful of papillae are also found on the lower jaw. The small teeth have roughly oval bases. The five pairs of gill slits are short. The pelvic fins are small and rounded.|$|E
25|$|In 1951, Percival Aircraft Company {{formed a}} {{helicopter}} division, and began design {{work on a}} medium-sized helicopter designated P.74. They designed the helicopter to meet Air Ministry Specification EH.125D issued in May 1952 for an experimental helicopter to test jet driven rotors. This experimental helicopter had a <b>teardrop-shaped</b> fuselage with a two-seat cockpit in the nose and a large cabin that ran {{the full length of}} the fuselage. Beneath the cabin floor, two Napier Oryx gas generators fed compressed air to the tips of the three rotor blades through triple ejector ducts. The rotor blades used ailerons on the trailing edges with pitch control achieved by a screw jack. The unusual engine location required that exhaust pipes pass through the cabin wall between the rows of seats. This created excessive noise and heat for intended passengers.|$|E
25|$|Like other angel sharks, S. caillieti has a flattened, ray-like {{form with}} greatly {{enlarged}} pectoral and pelvic fins. The horizontal {{edges of the}} broad, rounded head bear enlarged folds of skin. The large nostrils are <b>teardrop-shaped</b> and preceded by flaps of skin enlarged into two cylindrical barbels that overhang the mouth. The eyes are horizontally oval and placed relatively close together. Behind the eyes are crescent-shaped spiracles, which are spaced further apart than the eyes and bear prominent papillae (nipple-shaped structures) along their posterior inner rims. The mouth is wide and terminally placed on the snout, with furrows at the corners {{and the center of}} the upper lip forming a rounded arch. The upper and lower jaws contain 10 and 9 tooth rows respectively on either side; the teeth are small, conical, and sharp. The five pairs of gill slits are laterally situated on the head.|$|E
25|$|All {{previous}} night fighter {{versions of the}} Ju 88 used a modified A-series fuselage. The G-series fuselage was purpose-built for {{the special needs of}} a night fighter, with the A-series' Bola ventral under-nose defensive gun position omitted for lower aerodynamic drag and less weight, and adding the enlarged squared-off vertical fin/rudder tail unit of the Ju 188. G-1 aircraft possessed more powerful armament and like the earlier R-1, used a pair of 1,700PS BMW 801 radial engines, the G-1 using the later BMW 801G-2 version. Electronic equipment consisted of the then-standard FuG 220 Lichtenstein SN-2 90MHz VHF radar using eight-dipole Hirschgeweih antennas, which could include fitment of the borderline-SHF-band FuG 350 Naxos radar detector with its receiving antenna housed in a <b>teardrop-shaped</b> streamlined fairing above the canopy, or FuG 227 Flensburg radar detector homing devices that had their own trio of twin-dipole antennae: one on each wing leading edge and one under the tail. One Ju 88G-1 of 7. Staffel/NJG 2 was flown by mistake to RAF Woodbridge in July 1944, giving the Royal Air Force its first chance to check out the VHF-band Lichtenstein SN-2 radar and Flensburg radar detector gear.|$|E
25|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} has a blunt apex and is {{placed over the}} aft part of the pelvic fins. The second dorsal fin is similar in shape and nearly equal in size to the first, and placed over the aft part of the anal fin. The {{pectoral}} fins are fairly large and broad. The small pelvic fins are low relative to their bases, and have angular margins. The anal fin is elongated and placed close to the pelvic and caudal fins; the anal fin base measures 11% of the total length, about comparable to {{the space between the}} dorsal fins. The caudal fin has a small lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The body is covered by small, overlapping dermal denticles, each with a <b>teardrop-shaped</b> crown with a median ridge and three marginal teeth. There are enlarged denticles forming distinctive saw-like crests along the anterior portions of both the dorsal and ventral caudal fin edges. This species has a unique dorsal color pattern, consisting of dark horizontal stripes outlined in white in front of the dorsal fins, and a series of dark saddle-like markings running from the first dorsal fin base to the tail, on a dusky background. The underside is uniformly white.|$|E
25|$|In the 1989 Tour de France, 1988 winner Pedro Delgado {{was the big}} favourite, with Fignon, Stephen Roche, and Erik Breukink listed {{together}} as top contenders. After Delgado inexplicably was nearly three minutes late {{for the start of}} the prologue time trial, the race was open to all contenders, and ended up a battle between Greg LeMond and Fignon. LeMond won a minute in the time trial in stage five, using aerobars which enabled a new and more aerodynamic riding position (also known as tri-bars as they had previously only been used in triathlons), a new type of <b>teardrop-shaped</b> aerodynamic helmet in the time trials and a rear disc wheel, Fignon used normal road handlebars and a bicycle with both front and rear disc wheels, which left him more affected by cross winds. LeMond led the general classification after that stage by 5 seconds. In the tenth stage, Fignon beat LeMond by 12 seconds, and became the new leader, 7 seconds ahead of LeMond. In the time trial of stage 15, LeMond again won time on Fignon, and took back the leading position. Fignon came back by dropping LeMond on Alpe d'Huez, taking back the lead, and after he won alone at Villard-de-Lans the next day, the margin was 50 seconds.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of dinosaurs had teeth that were similarly shaped throughout their jaws but varied in size. Dinosaur tooth shapes included cylindrical, peg-like, <b>teardrop-shaped,</b> leaf-like, diamond-shaped and blade-like. A dinosaur that has variety of tooth shapes {{is said to}} have heterodont dentition. An example of this are dinosaurs of the group Heterodontosauridae and the enigmatic early dinosaur, Eoraptor. While most dinosaurs had a single row of teeth on each side of their jaws, others had dental batteries where teeth in the cheek region were fused together to form compound teeth. Individually these teeth were not suitable for grinding food, but when joined together with other teeth they would form a large surface area for the mechanical digestion of tough plant materials. This type of dental strategy is observed in ornithopod and ceratopsian dinosaurs as well as the duck-billed hadrosaurs, which had more than one hundred teeth in each dental battery. The teeth of carnivorous dinosaurs, called ziphodont, were typically blade-like or cone-shaped, curved, with serrated edges. This dentition was adapted for grasping and cutting through flesh. In some cases, as observed in the railroad-spike sized teeth of Tyrannosaurus rex, the teeth were designed to puncture and crush bone. Some dinosaurs had procumbent teeth, which projected forward in the mouth.|$|E
25|$|The {{pectoral}} fin disc of the Kapala stingaree {{is more or}} less diamond-shaped with rounded outer corners and posterior margins, and is slightly wider than long. The leading margins of the disc are nearly straight and converge at an obtuse angle on the fleshy, barely protruding snout. The eyes are of modest size and followed by <b>teardrop-shaped</b> spiracles with rounded posterior rims. There is a subtle knob on the rear margin of each nostril. Between the nostrils is a bell-shaped curtain of skin, with the posterior margin shallowly fringed and corners elongated into lobes; only the sparsely-spotted stingaree (U. paucimaculatus) has a similarly shaped nasal curtain. The mouth is small and contains 57 papillae (nipple-like structure) arranged in a W-shaped pattern on the floor. The lower jaw also bears a patch of prominent papillae, arranged to form a series of transverse ridges. The teeth have rhomboid bases and are arranged in a quincunx pattern; the crowns are blunt for teeth at the sides of the jaws, becoming higher and more pointed towards the middle of the jaw. There are 25 upper and 3132 lower tooth rows. The five pairs of gill slits are S-shaped. The pelvic fins are small with rounded rear margins; males have short, stout claspers.|$|E
25|$|When {{the primary}} {{electron}} beam {{interacts with the}} sample, the electrons lose energy by repeated random scattering and absorption within a <b>teardrop-shaped</b> volume of the specimen known as the interaction volume, which extends from less than 100nm to approximately 5µm into the surface. The size of the interaction volume depends on the electron's landing energy, the atomic number of the specimen and the specimen's density. The energy exchange between the electron beam and the sample results in the reflection of high-energy electrons by elastic scattering, emission of secondary electrons by inelastic scattering and the emission of electromagnetic radiation, each {{of which can be}} detected by specialized detectors. The beam current absorbed by the specimen can also be detected and used to create images of the distribution of specimen current. Electronic amplifiers of various types are used to amplify the signals, which are displayed as variations in brightness on a computer monitor (or, for vintage models, on a cathode ray tube). Each pixel of computer video memory is synchronized with the position of the beam on the specimen in the microscope, and the resulting image is therefore a distribution map of the intensity of the signal being emitted from the scanned area of the specimen. In older microscopes images may be captured by photography from a high-resolution cathode ray tube, but in modern machines they are digitised and saved as digital images.|$|E
25|$|In September 1942, the G-4 appeared; {{this version}} was {{identical}} to the G-2 in all respects, including performance, except for being fitted with the FuG 16 VHF radio set, which provided much clearer radio transmissions and had three-times {{the range of the}} earlier HF sets. Externally this could be recognised by the position of the fuselage antenna lead-in which was moved further aft to between frames seven and eight on the fuselage spine. Due to the steady weight increases of the 109, from the spring of 1943 larger 660×160mm (26×6.3in) mainwheels were introduced, replacing the previously used 650×150mm (25.6×6in) type. The undercarriage legs were altered so that the wheel's vertical axis was nearly upright rather than being parallel with the oleo leg. These changes resulted in the fitting of <b>teardrop-shaped</b> fairings to the upper wing surface above the wheel-wells to accommodate {{the upper part of the}} mainwheels. The larger wheels and fairings were often retrofitted to G-2s. In addition, a larger 350×135mm (14×5in) tailwheel replaced the original 290×110mm (11×4in) one; the larger tailwheel no longer fitted the recess, so the retraction mechanism was disconnected and the tailwheel fixed down. Up to July 1943, 1,242 G-4s were produced, with an additional four in Győr and WNF factories in the second half of 1943. Between January and February 1943, 50 examples of a pressurized version, the G-3 were also produced; similar to the G-1 although it was equipped with the same FuG 16 VHF radio set as the G-4.|$|E
500|$|Finally, the U.S. Navy was {{debating the}} best {{approach}} to optimize performance, particularly underwater speed, for its nuclear submarine fleet. Triton achieved high speeds through brute horsepower, rather than the more hydrodynamically efficient <b>teardrop-shaped</b> hull form pioneered by [...] which, when combined with nuclear power, allowed [...] to achieve higher speed with less horsepower.|$|E
500|$|Matt Lucas portrayed both Tweedledee and Tweedledum. Burton {{commented on}} the mixture of {{animation}} and Lucas, saying that [...] "It's a weird mixture of things which gives his characters the disturbing quality that they so richly deserve." [...] The characters are portrayed {{through a combination of}} CGI and live-action, with Lucas' face digitally composited to a full animated body. While performing the character, Lucas had to wear a <b>teardrop-shaped</b> motion capture suit and walk on stilts. In order to play both characters, Lucas was doubled by Ethan Cohn.|$|E
500|$|U-5s design {{featured}} a single-hull with a <b>teardrop-shaped</b> body that bore a strong resemblance to modern nuclear submarines. She was [...] long by [...] abeam {{and had a}} draft of [...] She displaced [...] surfaced, and [...] submerged. Her two [...] bow torpedo tubes featured unique, cloverleaf-shaped design hatches that rotated on a central axis, and the boat was designed to carry up to four torpedoes. For surface running, U-5 was outfitted with 2 gasoline engines, but suffered from inadequate ventilation, which resulted in frequent intoxication of the crew; her underwater propulsion was by two electric motors.|$|E
500|$|While Earth's {{magnetic}} field is roughly <b>teardrop-shaped,</b> Jupiter's is flatter, more closely resembling a disk, and [...] "wobbles" [...] periodically about its axis. The {{main reasons for}} this disk-like configuration are the centrifugal force from the co-rotating plasma and thermal pressure of hot plasma, both of which act to stretch Jupiter's {{magnetic field}} lines, forming a flattened pancake-like structure, known as the magnetodisk, at the distances greater than 20RJ from the planet. The magnetodisk has a thin current sheet at the middle plane, approximately near the magnetic equator. The magnetic field lines point away from Jupiter above the sheet and towards Jupiter below it. The load of plasma from Io greatly expands {{the size of the}} Jovian magnetosphere, because the magnetodisk creates an additional internal pressure which balances the pressure of the solar wind. In the absence of Io the distance from the planet to the magnetopause at the subsolar point would be no more than 42RJ, whereas it is actually 75RJ on average.|$|E
500|$|The I-5 was a single-seat biplane with {{staggered}} {{wings in}} a sesquiplane configuration with fixed landing gear and a tailskid. The aircraft was of mixed construction, with the fuselage being {{made of a}} framework of welded steel tubes covered by a fabric skin over the rear fuselage, with the front fuselage section being covered by detachable duralumin panels {{as far back as}} the rear of the cockpit. There were also detachable panels allowing easy access to the tailskid shock absorber. The fabric skin was laced for tightness and the seams were covered with calico. A fireproof bulkhead separated the [...] fuel tank from the engine and a fire extinguisher was fitted with outlets to the fuel pump, inlet pipe and carburetor. The conventional landing gear was connected by a one-piece axle and some aircraft were fitted with <b>teardrop-shaped</b> spats covering the wheels. Initially the tailskid was fixed, but later aircraft had smaller skids that moved in concert with the rudder. Rubber rings were used as shock absorbers on the landing gear.|$|E
500|$|The XBTM-1 was a low-wing, {{all-metal}} monoplane with folding {{wings to}} allow more compact storage in carrier hangar decks, and conventional landing gear. Its fuselage was an oval-shaped stressed-skin semi-monocoque with the single-seat cockpit and its <b>teardrop-shaped</b> [...] canopy positioned just aft of the air-cooled engine. Just behind the cockpit was a [...] fuel tank. The large wing consisted of a two-spar center section with hydraulically-folded three-spar outer panels. A large dive brake was positioned on {{the trailing edge of}} the wing. When closed it could be lowered for use as a landing flap or it could be split into alternating upper and lower sections, with intermeshing [...] "fingers" [...] for use in its intended role. It was very effective in this role, mainly due to its great surface area, but this was at the cost of the width of the ailerons, which significantly reduced their efficiency. A pair of [...] fuel tanks were positioned in the roots of the center section. All fuel tanks were self sealing and the pilot and oil cooler were protected by [...] of armor.|$|E
500|$|The Yak-19 had an {{flattened}} oval-shaped, metal semi-monocoque fuselage {{with the}} single-seat cockpit and its <b>teardrop-shaped</b> canopy positioned just {{forward of the}} [...] axial-flow RD-10F turbojet engine. Its air intake was in the nose and the afterburner was positioned {{at the rear of}} the fuselage, just below the tail structure. Fitted with tricycle landing gear, the main landing gear retracted inwards into the fuselage while the nose gear retracted forwards. The laminar-flow, two-spar, straight wing was mounted in the middle of the fuselage. It was equipped with modified Fowler flaps and Frise ailerons. The rudder was split into two sections by the horizontal stabilizers; the upper portion was fabric-covered while the lower half was metal-skinned. The pilot was protected by a bulletproof windscreen, a forward armor plate and an armored seat back. In addition, he was provided with an ejection seat. The Yak-19 was equipped with four fuel tanks in the fuselage that had a total capacity of [...] of fuel. It was armed with two [...] Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon, each with 70 rounds.|$|E
500|$|The Lavochkin OKB {{was ordered}} to design a fighter using a single Junkers Jumo 004B axial-flow {{turbojet}} in February 1945. Much like their rivals at the Mikoyan-Gurevich OKB with their MiG-9, the OKB chose a [...] "pod-and-boom" [...] layout for their new fighter, based on advice from the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute (TsAGI), although their design had a shoulder-mounted wing. The wings of the all-metal aircraft had fixed leading edges and slotted flaps. The cockpit was well forward, giving the pilot good visibility, and he was protected by an armored headrest. The windscreen of the <b>teardrop-shaped</b> canopy was also armored. Two [...] Nudelman-Suranov NS-23 autocannon were mounted on the lower side of the fuselage with 75 rounds per gun. The tricycle landing gear retracted into the fuselage which gave the 150 a very narrow track. The Soviet derivative of the Jumo engine, the RD-10, was rated at [...] and was mounted behind the cockpit. A steel heat shield protected {{the bottom of the}} rear fuselage from the engine's exhaust. Air was supplied by an intake in the aircraft nose that split around the cockpit before reaching the engine. Seven tanks, five in the fuselage and one in each wing, carried a total of [...] of fuel.|$|E
500|$|Depending on {{the variety}} and time of year, lettuce {{generally}} lives 65–130 days from planting to harvesting. Because lettuce that flowers (through the process known as [...] "bolting") becomes bitter and unsaleable, plants grown for consumption are rarely allowed to grow to maturity. Lettuce flowers more quickly in hot temperatures, while freezing temperatures cause slower growth and sometimes damage to outer leaves. Once plants move past the edible stage, they develop flower stalks up to [...] high with small yellow blossoms. Like {{other members of the}} tribe Cichorieae, lettuce inflorescences (also known as flower heads or capitula) are composed of multiple florets, each with a modified calyx called a pappus (which becomes the feathery [...] "parachute" [...] of the fruit), a corolla of five petals fused into a ligule or strap, and the reproductive parts. These include fused anthers that form a tube which surrounds a style and [...] stigma. As the anthers shed pollen, the style elongates to allow the stigmas, now coated with pollen, to emerge from the tube. The ovaries form compressed, obovate (<b>teardrop-shaped)</b> dry fruits that do not open at maturity, measuring 3 to 4mm long. The fruits have 5–7 ribs on each side and are tipped by two rows of small white hairs. The pappus remains at the top of each fruit as a dispersal structure. Each fruit contains one seed, which can be white, yellow, gray or brown depending on the variety of lettuce.|$|E
2500|$|... 75U.S. gallon(284l) drop tank: A standardized, {{all-metal}} <b>teardrop-shaped</b> steel {{tank with}} a prominent protruding horizontal seam, initially produced for the P-39 Airacobra, was {{adapted to the}} P-47 beginning 31 August 1943.

2500|$|Assistant Chief Engineer [...] Howell [...] "Pete" [...] Miller and Zantford [...] "Granny" [...] Granville {{spent three}} days of wind tunnel testing at NYU with {{aeronautical}} engineering professor Alexander Klemin. The aircraft had a very peculiar design. Granville reasoned that a <b>teardrop-shaped</b> fuselage— especially as seen from directly above— would have lower drag than a straight-tapered one, so the fuselage was wider than the engine at its widest point (at the wing attachment point, within {{the length of the}} wing chord). The cockpit was located very far aft, {{just in front of the}} vertical stabilizer, in order to give the racing pilot better vision while making crowded pylon turns.|$|E
2500|$|Copepods, {{the primary}} zooplankton, {{are a major}} item on the forage fish menu. [...] Copepods are {{typically}} 1 to 2mm (0.04 to 0.08in) long, with a <b>teardrop-shaped</b> body. Some scientists say they form the largest animal biomass on the planet. Copepods are very alert and evasive. They have large antennae (see photo below left). When they spread their antennae, they can sense the pressure wave from an approaching fish and jump with great speed over a few centimetres. If copepod concentrations reach high levels, schooling herrings adopt a method called ram feeding. In the photo below, herring ram feed on a school of copepods. They swim with their mouth wide open and their percula fully expanded.|$|E
