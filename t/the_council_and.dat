The mayor chairs both <b>the</b> city <b>council</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>council</b> of mayor <b>and</b> aldermen. <b>The</b> <b>council</b> of mayor <b>and</b> aldermen exercise the executive power of the provincial government. The relationship between the Alderman <b>and</b> <b>the</b> City <b>Council</b> is officially dualistic, that is they have separate responsibilities.|$|R
5|$|The Permanent Court of International Justice was {{provided}} {{for by the}} Covenant, but not established by it. <b>The</b> <b>Council</b> <b>and</b> the Assembly established its constitution. Its judges were elected by <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>and</b> the Assembly, and its budget {{was provided}} by the latter. The Court was to hear and decide any international dispute which the parties concerned submitted to it. It might also give an advisory opinion on any dispute or question referred to it by the Council or the Assembly. The Court was open to all {{the nations of the world}} under certain broad conditions.|$|E

This {{would be the}} last attempt to abolish <b>the</b> <b>council</b> <b>and,</b> as the first time the NSW Labor party had lost a state poll in many years, was widely seen as {{the beginning of the end}} for the Labor government, which had been in power since 1941. Heffron's supporter Dougherty resigned from the council a month later in protest of the result.|$|E
5|$|By June, {{the mayor}} was looking for {{political}} support to avert a full public inquiry. The National Party, whose members were dominant on <b>the</b> <b>Council,</b> <b>and</b> MLC Melinda Pavey had been particularly critical {{of the actions of}} the Department of Local Government in the General Purpose Standing Committee. Local independent MP, Rob Oakeshott said, however, that the Council should instead address the findings of the report, and stop arguing about the facts or using emotional arguments in support of it. He also cautioned against getting politicians involved, stressing that this was a formal legal process.|$|E

The Palestinian president, Yasser Arafat, appointed Samir Mohammed Azayiza as mayor until 2000 when he replaced him with Sami Abu Salim, a wealthy businessman from the city.

5|$|Many educated Sudanese were {{suspicious}} of <b>the</b> <b>Council</b> <b>and</b> drifted towards the Khatmiyya {{side in the}} 1944 elections, not for religious reasons but because they were hostile to the government, wanted to retain links with Egypt as a counterpoise to British influence {{and did not want}} a monarchy under Sayyid Abd al-Rahman.|$|E
5|$|On 12 April, the 14th Panzer Division linked up {{with the}} Italians at Vrbovsko, closing the ring around the {{remnants}} of the 7th Army, which surrendered, and the 1st Mountain Division pushed through Novo Mesto and Črnomelj without facing resistance, reaching Vinice {{by the end of the}} day. At Celje, Lanz received a delegation led by Natlačen which included Andrej Gosar. The meeting was very formal and cold, as Lanz had already received orders regarding the break-up of Slovenia into Italian and German-controlled territories, and <b>the</b> <b>council</b> <b>and</b> its goal of an independent Slovenia were superfluous from a German perspective.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Gardiner was refused {{access to}} Henry {{during his last}} months. Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, found himself accused of treason; {{the day before the}} king's death his vast estates were seized, making them {{available}} for redistribution, and he spent the whole of Edward's reign in the Tower of London. Other historians have argued that Gardiner's exclusion was based on non-religious matters, that Norfolk was not noticeably conservative in religion, that conservatives remained on <b>the</b> <b>Council,</b> <b>and</b> that the radicalism of such men as Sir Anthony Denny, who controlled the dry stamp that replicated the king's signature, is debatable.|$|E
