The current from the antenna creates an alternating magnetic field in the primary coil, which induced a current in the secondary coil which was then rectified and powered the earphone. Each of the coils functions as a tuned circuit; the primary coil resonated with the capacitance of the antenna (or sometimes another capacitor), and the secondary coil resonated with the <b>tuning</b> <b>capacitor.</b> Both the primary and secondary were tuned to the frequency of the station.

40|$|The free-piston Stirling power {{convertor}} is {{a promising}} technology for high efficiency heat-to-electricity power conversion in space. Stirling power convertors typically utilize linear alternators for converting mechanical motion into electricity. The linear alternator {{is one of}} the heaviest components of modern Stirling power convertors. In addition, state-of-art Stirling linear alternators usually require the use of <b>tuning</b> <b>capacitors</b> or active power factor correction controllers to maximize convertor output power. The linear alternator to be discussed in this paper, eliminates the need for <b>tuning</b> <b>capacitors</b> and delivers electrical power output in which current is inherently in phase with voltage. No power factor correction is needed. In addition, the linear alternator concept requires very little iron, so core loss has been virtually eliminated. This concept is a unique moving coil design where the magnetic flux path is defined by the magnets themselves. This paper presents computational predictions for two different low inductance alternator configurations, and compares the predictions with experimental data for one of the configurations that has been built and is currently being tested...|$|R

40|$|Frequency tuning of work modes in {{the silicon}} {{vibratory}} gyroscope is studied by the theoretical, numerical, and experimental methods in this paper. First, the schematic structure and simplified kinematics {{model of the}} gyroscope were presented for deducing the natural frequencies. Then, the width and length of support beams were optimized to tune work frequencies at their designed value. Besides, the frequency difference was experimentally tested and manually tuned by varying the voltage applied on the <b>tuning</b> <b>capacitors.</b> The test on a prototype showed that the difference could be localized between − 55. 8 [*]Hz and 160. 2 [*]Hz when the tuning voltage limit is 20 [*]V. Finally, a frequency control loop was developed to automatically tune the sense frequency toward the drive frequency. Both the theoretical analysis and numeric simulation show that the difference is stabilized at 0. 8 [*]Hz when no Coriolis force or quadrature coupling force is applied. It is proved that the frequency difference is successfully tuned by modifying the size of support beams before fabrication {{as well as the}} voltage applied on the <b>tuning</b> <b>capacitors</b> after fabrication.
