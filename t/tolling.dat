5000|$|A barrier <b>toll</b> system (also {{known as}} an open <b>toll</b> system) is a method of {{collecting}} <b>tolls</b> on highways using <b>toll</b> barriers at regularly spaced intervals on the <b>toll</b> road's mainline. Motorists are typically charged a flat-rate <b>toll,</b> unlike <b>toll</b> roads with a ticket system where the <b>toll</b> rate {{is determined by the}} distance traveled or number of exits passed. Some highways use coin-drop machines on <b>toll</b> plazas. For <b>toll</b> roads whose ramps have no <b>toll</b> plazas, it is possible to exit the <b>toll</b> road before the mainline <b>toll</b> plaza, use local streets to bypass it, then re-enter the highway via an interchange {{on the other side of}} the <b>toll</b> plaza. Thus it is possible to drive on some barrier <b>toll</b> roads while paying less or not paying at all.|$|R
5|$|An {{electronic}} {{toll collection}} system was proposed in 1990 where a motorist would create an account and use an electronic device which would be read from an electronic tollbooth; the motorist would be billed later. The multi-state electronic <b>tolling</b> system, E-ZPass, was planned to go into effect by 1998; however, implementation of the system was postponed until 2000.|$|E
5|$|Initially, it was {{suggested}} that <b>tolling</b> would cease once the original cost of construction plus accrued interest was repaid – this was done in 1993 and it was planned that tolls would not be levied after May 1995. Instead legislation enabling the continued levying of tolls was renewed by Parliament (originally that of the UK but now the Scottish Parliament) in 1998, 2003 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|On March6, 2012, {{the turnpike}} {{commission}} {{announced that it}} was going forward with an all-electronic <b>tolling</b> plan. Such a plan will take at least five years to implement to allow time for equipment to be installed and the reconfiguration of ramps. It will save the turnpike commission $65 million a year on labor costs by eliminating toll collectors. The plans call for a 76% surcharge for motorists who do not have E-ZPass that are billed by mail. This surcharge could raise the toll for someone without E-ZPass to $53.10 to travel the entire turnpike. In October 2016, the turnpike began accepting credit cards as payment at all cash toll booths. In April 2018, the turnpike commission will implement all-electronic <b>tolling</b> at the Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit toll plazas.|$|E

The melodic line is simple and restrained, and except for a passionate section near the end is generally quiet and elegiac.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{tests the}} {{hypothesis}} that the salience of a tax system affects equilibrium tax rates. To do this, I analyze how <b>toll</b> rates change after <b>toll</b> facilities adopt electronic <b>toll</b> collection. Unlike manual <b>toll</b> collection, in which the driver must hand over cash at the <b>toll</b> collection plaza, electronic <b>toll</b> collection automatically debits the <b>toll</b> amount as the car drives through the <b>toll</b> plaza, thereby plausibly decreasing the salience of the <b>toll.</b> I find robust evidence that <b>toll</b> rates increase following the adoption of electronic <b>toll</b> collection. My estimates suggest that, in steady state, <b>toll</b> rates are 20 to 40 percent higher than they would have been without electronic <b>toll</b> collection. Consistent with {{the hypothesis that}} decreased tax salience is responsible for the increase in <b>toll</b> rates, I also find evidence that the short run elasticity of driving with respect to the actual <b>toll</b> declines (in absolute value) following the adoption of electronic <b>toll</b> collection. I consider a variety of alternative explanations for these results and conclude that these are unlikely to be able to explain the findings.

5|$|The turnpike {{commission}} {{announced plans}} to consider eliminating manned toll booths in favor of all-electronic tolls. With this system, tolls will be paid with E-ZPass or credit cards. Drivers unable to pay by either method will be billed by mail (using license plate recognition), and a surcharge will be imposed. In addition to E-ZPass, the turnpike commission offered other automated options to pay for tolls such as using a prepaid account that utilizes license plate recognition. McCormick Taylor and Wilbur Smith Associates have been hired to conduct a feasibility study on converting the road to all-electronic tolls. On March 6, 2012, the turnpike commission {{announced that it was}} implementing an all-electronic <b>tolling</b> plan. The turnpike commission will save $65million annually on labor costs by eliminating toll collectors. Plans call for a 76-percent surcharge on motorists without E-ZPass who are billed by mail; this surcharge could raise the toll for a motorist without E-ZPass to well over $50 to travel the entire turnpike. On January 3, 2016, all-electronic <b>tolling</b> was introduced in the westbound direction at the Delaware River Bridge mainline toll plaza, while the eastern terminus of the ticket system was moved from the Delaware River Bridge to Neshaminy Falls.|$|E

Moments of silence were also held elsewhere throughout the DeKalb community. There was a special memorial service held in the NIU Convocation Center on February 24, the day before classes resumed, in honor of the victims that initiated a set of activities and services aimed at community recovery.

It recommended that the Langevåg–Buavåg Ferry, which connected to southern Bømlo, remain, but that the other four ferry services be terminated. During late 1989, advance <b>tolling</b> on the ferries was approved by the municipal councils and the county council, who recommended that collection start from 1 July 1990. However, the start date was not supported by the national government and the issue placed on hold.|$|E

5|$|The {{death of}} an {{individual}} – signified by the <b>tolling</b> of the bell – is thus a treasure buried {{at the bottom of}} a mine: only of value if it is given to someone who makes good use of it. In this he refers to the work of Augustine of Hippo, specifically On Christian Doctrine, in which Augustine describes the knowledge of pagans as gold and silver: something that can be involved in Christian purposes if appropriated properly. Donne, twisting this idea, is arguing that the {{death of an}}y individual is something others can learn from, should they understand it properly.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} toll highways, Highway 407 {{features}} no toll booths. Rather, {{a system of}} cameras and transponders allows for automatic toll collection. It {{is one of the}} earliest examples of a highway to exclusively use open road <b>tolling.</b> Highway407 is otherwise designed as a normal freeway; interchanges connect directly to surface streets. A radio antenna detects when a vehicle with a transponder has entered and exited the highway, calculating the toll rate. For vehicles without a transponder, an automatic number plate recognition system is used. In both cases, monthly statements are mailed to users. The automatic number plate recognition system is linked to several provincial and U.S. state motor vehicle registries.|$|E
5|$|By late January 2006, campaigning {{was under}} way for the Dunfermline and West Fife by-election, 2006 {{scheduled}} to take place for the Westminster constituency in which {{the north end of}} the bridge is situated.

It was won by Liberal Democrat candidate Willie Rennie, overturning a large Labour majority on a 16% swing. In the aftermath of the by-election defeat, media speculation suggested the Executive had turned against the proposals, and Tavish Scott eventually confirmed their rejection and the retention of the existing toll structure on 1 March 2006. FETA condemned the decision, while local opposition MSPs charged the minister that his <b>tolling</b> review short-changed Fifers as tolls were axed on the Erskine Bridge leaving tolls on only the Forth and Tay Road Bridge.|$|E

5|$|Japanese temple bells are struck {{externally}} {{with either}} a hammer or a suspended beam rather than with an internal clapper. The sound of the bell {{is made up of}} three parts. First is the atari, the impact of the strike. A well-made bell should produce a clean, clear tone. The initial sound of the strike is immediately followed by the prolonged oshi, the reverberation that continues to sound after the bell is struck. This is higher in pitch and is a low rumble with a sorrowful air, rich in harmonics; it lasts for up to ten seconds. Finally comes the okuri or decay, the resonance that is heard as the vibration of the bell dies away, which can last up to a minute. There are also continuous harmonic overtones heard throughout the <b>tolling</b> of the bell. These multiple tones create a complex pitch profile.|$|E
5|$|The Northeast Extension of the Pennsylvania Turnpike {{uses the}} ticket system method of <b>tolling</b> between the Mid-County and Wyoming Valley toll plazas {{along with the}} {{mainline}} Pennsylvania Turnpike. With the ticket system, a motorist receives a ticket upon entering the turnpike at an interchange and pays the fare and surrenders the ticket upon exiting. If a motorist loses the ticket, the turnpike charges the highest fare to the exit where the motorist leaves. Mainline toll plazas are also located at Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit, charging a flat rate. There are no tolls on exit ramps between Wyoming Valley and Clarks Summit. E-ZPass is accepted at all toll plazas. As of 2017, it costs a passenger vehicle $12.10 to travel {{the length of the}} Northeast Extension between Mid-County and Wyoming Valley using cash and $8.54 using E-ZPass. The Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit toll plazas cost $1.45 using cash and $0.81 using E-ZPass for passenger vehicles.|$|E
