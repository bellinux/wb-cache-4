25|$|Sculpting Life {{received}} its premier <b>terrestrial</b> <b>broadcast</b> on the Irish National Broadcaster, RTÉ to much critical acclaim. The film, also aired on the Arts Channel in New Zealand, provides a unique {{view of the}} world of a bronze casting sculptor, as he creates a series of famine sculptures from research, through to unveiling in Ireland Park, Toronto. Partly based on his reading of Joseph O'Connor's the Star of the Sea, Gillespie enters the world of its central character, the murderous Pius Mulvey as he haunts the decks of a coffin ship and becomes an emaciated ghost, living among the hundreds of Irish emigrants crammed into steerage. The documentary follows the sculptor as he brings the character to life in bronze.|$|E

2500|$|In {{presenting}} [...] "The {{opinion and}} the other opinion" [...] (the station's motto), {{it did not take}} long for Al Jazeera to shock local viewers by presenting Israelis speaking Hebrew on Arab television for the first time. Lively and far-ranging talk shows, particularly a popular, confrontational one called The Opposite Direction, were a constant source of controversy regarding issues of morality and religion. This prompted a torrent of criticism from the conservative voices among the region's press. It also led to official complaints and censures from neighboring governments. Some jammed Al Jazeera's <b>terrestrial</b> <b>broadcast</b> or expelled its correspondents. In 1999, the Algerian government reportedly cut power to several major cities in order to censor one broadcast. There were also commercial repercussions: Saudi Arabia reportedly pressured advertisers to avoid the channel, to great effect. Al Jazeera was also becoming a favorite sounding board for militant groups such as Hamas and Chechen separatists.|$|E
2500|$|The Tom Leykis Show had {{its last}} regular <b>terrestrial</b> <b>broadcast</b> on Friday, February 20, 2009, and ended at 5 p.m., {{the middle of}} its usual time slot. Leykis took calls until the last five minutes. At that point, the host {{mentioned}} that people had {{asked him how he}} was going to end the show. Saying [...] "Let's tell the truth", Leykis commented that he knew since the previous summer that it was possible the flagship station (KLSX, which originated the broadcast of the show) would switch format. Saying he [...] "tossed and turned", he thought about it and asked himself: [...] "What could I say that would wrap this all up? And then I one day heard this song … and I realized – the lyrics of this song … are about me." [...] With that, Leykis rolled into Joe Jackson's [...] "I'm the Man" [...] (the title track of Jackson's 1979 album). By the time the song was over, the studio was filled with people—as could be seen by the live online video broadcast on the station website. The host thanked his producers, the program director, the crowd in the studio, and everyone in southern California who made it [...] "12 great years", and he finished with [...] "Let's do this thing one more time..." [...] The crowd yelled [...] "Blow me up, Tom" [...] one last time to end the show and mark the end of KLSX as [...] "The FM Talk Station" [...] in what coincidentally became a strikingly appropriate catch phrase to be had: The phrase [...] "blow up the station" [...] is a radio term for ending a particular format or station run. After a much longer than usual explosion sound effect, the crowd cheered and KLSX changed format from hot talk to CHR/Top 40.|$|E
