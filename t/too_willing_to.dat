5|$|During {{research}} on his dissertation, Arrington found a manuscript from 1946 by Feramorz Fox about Mormon communitarianism. Arrington found the manuscript fascinatingly free of Marxist thought and together with Dean L. May, revised and expanded the manuscript {{under the title}} Building the City of God: Community and Cooperation among the Mormons. Deseret Book published the book in 1976. The book was received poorly at LDS Church Headquarters; Deseret Book {{was not allowed to}} reprint the book and Church News was not permitted to review it. Fellow historians found the book well-researched but <b>too</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> give Mormonism credit for modern welfare programs.|$|E
25|$|The Tea Party {{movement}} is typically {{aligned with the}} Republican Party, but it feuds with the pro-business wing of the party, which it sees as too moderate and <b>too</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> compromise.|$|E
25|$|Geronimo, camped on the Mexican {{side of the}} border, {{agreed to}} Crook's {{surrender}} terms. That night, a soldier who sold them whiskey said that his band would be murdered {{as soon as they}} crossed the border. Geronimo, Nachite, and 39 of his followers slipped away during the night. Crook exchanged a series of heated telegrams with General Philip Sheridan defending his men's actions, until on April 1, 1886, he sent a telegram asking Sheridan to relieve him of command, which Sheridan was all <b>too</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> do.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} morning, the bear inexplicably begins to hammer away at iron. He's roaring loudly, {{almost as if}} in song, and no one understands why. However, the men join him and, in essence, lose {{themselves}} in the hard work. Prushevsky does not follow suit. A girl asks him to teach her knowledge, and he leaves the worksite with her. The activist receives {{a letter from the}} Soviet government stating that any peasants who seem <b>too</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> have their property collectivized should be treated with suspicion as undercover agents.|$|E
25|$|The {{candidacy}} of Massimo D'Alema {{was supported}} by his party, the Democrats of the Left, and by other parties of the coalition, such as the Party of Italian Communists, the Communist Refoundation Party and Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy, but opposed by others, such as the Rose in the Fist, arguing that his candidacy was driven by a particracy's mentality. Also, part of the left-wing coalition considered D'Alema far <b>too</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> conduct backroom deals with the opposition. Some moderate journalists liked D'Alema because his presidency would have given Romano Prodi a stable government since the biggest party of the Union had not been rewarded with any institutional position.|$|E
500|$|Aaron Payne of musicOMH wrote, [...] "Daft Punk somehow {{misplace}} the wit and {{the light}} touch that's pretty much their trademark. Instead, these long epics become somewhat tedious {{and there is a}} strong whiff of egoism and self-indulgence.…At over 70 minutes, the album feels rather bloated. Quite a few of the songs are too long, or too empty of ideas, or <b>too</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> repeat themselves, or <b>too</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> play to type". Dan Weiss of Paste noted that [...] "none of the admittedly eclectic pilferings of Random Access Memories challenge or defy anything. They all evoke specific eras of film soundtrack or disco trend. The beats have grown less, not more, complex over time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Essayist Clifton Fadiman wrote, [...] "Bierce {{was never}} a great writer. He has painful faults of vulgarity and cheapness of imagination. But... his style, for one thing, will {{preserve}} him; and the purity of his misanthropy, <b>too,</b> <b>will</b> help <b>to</b> keep him alive." ...|$|R
25|$|Upon their return, Ursula reveals that, {{with the}} death of her {{counterpart}} Seth, she <b>too</b> <b>will</b> cease <b>to</b> exist. Before disappearing, she resurrects the girl that Hector killed, and also charges Ein, Fia, Lina, Serene, Cierra and Rose with the continued protection of Riviera.|$|R
50|$|With {{her plans}} to seduce Percy scuppered, Theresia turns her {{attention}} to Sir Percy's wife Marguerite and uses an all <b>too</b> <b>willing</b> Bertrand <b>to</b> set the trap. Lady Blakeney is kidnapped yet again and taken to France and imprisoned as bait for Sir Percy.|$|R
500|$|Kill the Irishman {{contains}} four historical inaccuracies. This {{has been}} noted by critics, one of whom said the film's main {{problem is that it}} seemed [...] "all <b>too</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> sacrifice historical accuracy in the name of an easy-to-digest narrative". Shondor Birns was murdered on March 29, 1975, whereas in the film this occurs on March 8. The movie also misspells the name of a nearby parish known as 'St. Malachi's'; in the movie it is spelled 'St. Malichy's'.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{the murder}} of Maurice, Narses, {{governor}} of the Byzantine province of Mesopotamia, rebelled against Phocas and seized Edessa, a major city of the province. Emperor Phocas instructed general Germanus to besiege Edessa, prompting Narses to request help from the Persian king Khosrow II. Khosrow, who was only <b>too</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> help avenge Maurice, his [...] "friend and father-", used Maurice's death {{as an excuse to}} attack the Roman Empire, trying to reconquer Armenia and Mesopotamia.|$|E
500|$|By {{eliminating}} his dangerous rival, Bokassa demonstrated {{his ability}} to deal ruthlessly with dissidents and political opponents. He started to rule more arbitrarily after the Banza affair, giving himself control of various ministerial positions and the army. In one instance, he promoted Second Lieutenant François Bozizé, the future president of the Central African Republic, to General after he beat a Frenchman who showed disrespect for the president. According to Brian Titley, author of Dark Age: The Political Odyssey of Emperor Bokassa, he surrounded himself with [...] "sycophants, who were all <b>too</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> nurture his growing delusions of grandeur"; {{with no one to}} stop him, he also spent money with reckless abandon.|$|E

6000|$|... "One cannot reckon upon men {{coming back}} from the dead," [...] Peter declared. [...] "It isn't often that you find every morning and every evening paper mistaken. As for the woman, I believe in her. She {{honestly}} meant to sell us those papers of Bernadine's. I believe that she, <b>too,</b> <b>will</b> have <b>to</b> face a day of reckoning." ...|$|R
500|$|David Orr of The New York Times {{describes}} Jon as [...] "a complex, {{thoughtful and}} basically good character". David Benioff and D. B. Weiss, the creators and executive {{producers of the}} television adaptation of the series, explain that Jon {{is one of several}} characters in the series who must [...] "face hard truths about the world they live in, and adapt themselves to those truths" [...] because [...] "The struggle many of them face is how to do that without losing their grip on who they are." [...] Ned Stark teaches all his children about leadership, selflessness, duty and honor. Following his father's example becomes more difficult as Jon faces challenges to his identity as a man, a Stark, and a brother of the Night's Watch. Benioff and Weiss note that [...] "Jon Snow tries to live with honor, while knowing that honor often gets his family members murdered." [...] Writing for Variety about the season 6 episode [...] "Battle of the Bastards", Laura Prudom suggests that Jon [...] "has the same shortcomings" [...] as his father: [...] "he fights with honor against opponents who are all <b>too</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> use that predictable morality against him".|$|E
500|$|The {{battle was}} tactically inconclusive, {{although}} Lee technically was defeated because he withdrew first {{from the battlefield}} and retreated back to Virginia. McClellan wired to Washington, [...] "Our victory was complete. The enemy is driven back into Virginia." [...] Yet there was obvious disappointment that McClellan had not crushed Lee, who was fighting with a smaller army with its back to the Potomac River. Although McClellan's subordinates can claim their share of responsibility for delays (such as Ambrose Burnside's misadventures at Burnside Bridge) and blunders (Edwin V. Sumner's attack without reconnaissance), these were localized problems from which the full army could have recovered. As with the decisive battles in the Seven Days, McClellan's headquarters were {{too far to the}} rear to allow his personal control over the battle. He made no use of his cavalry forces for reconnaissance. He did not share his overall battle plans with his corps commanders, which prevented them from using initiative outside of their sectors. And he was far <b>too</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> accept cautious advice about saving his reserves, such as when a significant breakthrough {{in the center of the}} Confederate line could have been exploited, but Fitz John Porter is said to have told McClellan, [...] "Remember, General, I command the last reserve of the last Army of the Republic." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was on {{this day}} that Friedrich Kellner began to record his {{observations}} in a secret diary that he entitled Mein Widerstand, [...] "My Opposition". [...] He wanted the coming generations to know how easily young democracies could turn into dictatorships, and how people were <b>too</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> believe propaganda rather than resist tyranny and terrorism.|$|E

6000|$|... 'I {{have met}} deceit by deceit, till I am weary of it--weary, weary--and I {{long to be}} what I shall never be again--artless and innocent, like you. But I suppose that you, <b>too,</b> <b>will,</b> prove <b>to</b> be not worth a thought, as every new friend does on more {{intimate}} knowledge. Come, why don't you talk to me, child? Have you said your prayers?' ...|$|R
2500|$|How Tuoba Gui {{appeared}} <b>too</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> {{turn against}} his maternal uncles the Helans {{early in his}} reign. [...] If he was actually the son of Princess Murong, then {{he would not be}} related to the Helans, and his campaigns against them seemed less problematic. [...] (Of course, it would then render it problematic how he eventually attacked and seized most of Later Yan's history, as the Later Yan emperor Murong Bao would be his cousin.) ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 25, 2006, Boehner {{issued a}} {{statement}} defending his agenda and attacking his [...] "Democrat friends" [...] such as Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Boehner said regarding national security that voters [...] "have a choice between a Republican Party that understands the stakes and is dedicated to victory, and a Democrat Party with a non-existent national security policy that sheepishly dismisses the challenges of a post-9/11 world and is all <b>too</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> concede defeat on the battlefield in Iraq." ...|$|E
2500|$|Healey was Shadow Foreign Secretary {{during most}} of the 1980s, a job he coveted. He {{believed}} Foot was initially <b>too</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> support military action after the Falkland Islands were invaded by Argentina in April 1982. He accused Thatcher of [...] "glorying in slaughter", and had to withdraw the remark (he later claimed he had meant to say [...] "conflict"). [...] Healey was retained in the shadow cabinet by Neil Kinnock, who succeeded Foot after the disastrous 1983 general election, when the Conservatives bolstered their majority and Labour suffered their worst general election result in decades.|$|E
60|$|THE SERPENT. Things {{wear out}} by {{practice}}: {{they do not}} grow by it. Your hair streams in the wind {{as if it were}} trying to stretch itself further and further. But it does not grow longer for all its practice in streaming, because you have not willed it so. When Lilith told me what she had imagined in our silent language (for there were no words then) I bade her desire it and will it; and then, to our great wonder, the thing she had desired and willed created itself in her under the urging of her <b>will.</b> Then I <b>too</b> <b>willed</b> <b>to</b> renew myself as two instead of one; and after many days the miracle happened, and I burst from my skin another snake interlaced with me; and now there are two imaginations, two desires, two <b>wills</b> <b>to</b> create with.|$|R

"I hate to ask too much, {{after all}} you have done," [...] said the girl, [...] "but after you have seen my father and told him everything, for he must be in sore trouble, would you mind rowing to our house and {{bringing}} me some clothes?

2500|$|Churchill {{also wrote}} that {{although}} the Allied offensives up until August 1918 had been [...] "as hopeless as they were disastrous", requiring men of fifty to be called up because of the manpower shortage, [...] "Haig and Foch were vindicated in the end" [...] and that the Hundred Days [...] "will excite the wonder of future generations." [...] Churchill (23 Nov 1926) admitted to Lord Beaverbrook, who thought him <b>too</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> praise Haig that [...] "subsequent study of the war has led me to think a good deal better of Haig than I did at the time. It is absolutely certain {{there was no one}} who could have taken his place." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{this early}} interest, most {{scientists}} ignored Stevenson's work. According to his New York Times obituary, his detractors {{saw him as}} [...] "earnest, dogged but ultimately misguided, led astray by gullibility, wishful thinking and a tendency to see science where others saw superstition." [...] Critics suggested that the children or their parents had deceived him, that he was <b>too</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> believe them, {{and that he had}} asked them leading questions. In addition, critics said, the results were subject to confirmation bias, in that cases not supportive of the hypothesis were not presented as counting against it. Leonard Angel, a philosopher of religion, told The New York Times that Stevenson did not follow proper standards. [...] "ut you do have to look carefully to see it; that's why he's been very persuasive to many people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Malthus {{might have}} created a much better book, {{suggests}} Hazlitt, [...] "a great work {{on the principle of}} population". But he has weakened its effect, even precipitated dangerous consequences, by being biassed in favour of the affluent establishment and <b>too</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> place upon the poor the burden of solving the entire problem. [...] "It is not our author's wish to recommend any alterations in existing institutions. ... Mr. Malthus's 'gospel is preached to the poor.'" [...] "Our author has ... counteracted many capital errors formerly prevailing as to the universal and indiscriminate encouragement of population under all circumstances ... but he has countenanced opposite errors ... and has left it to future philosophers to follow up the principle, that some check must be provided for the unrestrained progress of population, into a set of wiser and more humane consequences." ...|$|E
50|$|Resonance example: A {{good example}} of morphodynamic work is the induced {{resonance}} that can be observed by singing or playing a flute next to a string instrument like a harp or guitar. The vibrating air emitted from the flute will interact with the taut strings. If any of the strings are tuned to a resonant frequency that matches the note being played, they <b>too</b> <b>will</b> begin <b>to</b> vibrate and emit sound.|$|R
60|$|Robert, the father, {{looked at}} her with his pained eyes, but her eyes were hard and shining, her lips almost {{disappeared}} in the tight closing of the mouth. She was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> believe the worst. He looked at his son; he was frowning; he looked as coldly angry as the mother. He, <b>too,</b> was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> believe everything, and they neither seemed very sorry.... Perhaps they were even glad.|$|R
