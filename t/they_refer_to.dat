5|$|Wagiman {{speakers}} are {{conscious of}} {{a distinction between}} two dialects of Wagiman, which <b>they</b> <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> as matjjin no-roh-ma 'light language' and matjjin gu-nawutj-jan 'heavy language'. The differences are minor and speakers have no difficulty understanding one another.|$|E
5|$|Ottawa {{grammatical}} gender classifies nouns as either animate or inanimate. Transitive verbs encode {{the gender of}} the grammatical object, and intransitive verbs encode {{the gender of the}} grammatical subject, creating a set of four verb subclasses. The distinction between the two genders also affects verbs through agreement patterns for number and gender. Similarly, demonstrative pronouns agree in gender with the noun <b>they</b> <b>refer</b> <b>to.</b>|$|E
5|$|Senufo {{languages}} have {{a typical}} Niger–Congo noun class (or gender) system. Suffixes on nouns mark membership {{of one of}} the five noun genders. Pronouns, adjectives and copulas reflect the noun gender of the nominal <b>they</b> <b>refer</b> <b>to.</b> Although none of the sources on Nafaanra provides any details, it can be inferred from a brief word list given by Jordan that the Nafaanra noun class system resembles that of other Senufo languages.|$|E

5|$|Of the 71 {{words in}} this list, 67 are nouns, and most would {{generally}} be considered loanwords; the only modern-English words that contain Q not followed by U {{and are not}} borrowed from another language are qiana, qwerty, and tranq. However, all of the loanwords on this list {{are considered to be}} naturalised in English according to at least one major dictionary (see References), often because <b>they</b> <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> concepts or societal roles that do not have an accurate equivalent in English. For words to appear here, they must appear in their own entry in a dictionary; words which occur only as part of a longer phrase are not included.|$|E
5|$|Fenton and Licht {{note that}} the effect of a rattlesnake's {{rattling}} could be deimatic (startle) in inexperienced animals, whether predators or large animals that might injure the snake by stepping on it, but aposematic (a warning signal) in animals that are aware of the rattle's meaning. <b>They</b> <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> the work of Fenton and his colleague David Bates on the responses of the big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, to the defensive clicks made by moths in the family Arctiidae, which includes the garden tiger moth, Arctia caja. This family includes large, furry, bitter-tasting or poisonous moths. They found that while sounds can startle inexperienced bats, after a few trials the bats ignored the sounds if the prey was edible; but the same sounds can warn experienced bats of bitter-tasting prey (an honest signal).|$|E
5|$|Regardless of the sequencing, {{artificial}} mottes {{had to be}} {{built by}} piling up earth; this work was undertaken by hand, using wooden shovels and hand-barrows, possibly with picks {{as well in the}} later periods. Larger mottes took disproportionately more effort to build than their smaller equivalents, because of the volumes of earth involved. The largest mottes in England, such as Thetford, are estimated to have required up to 24,000 man-days of work; smaller ones required perhaps as little as 1,000. Contemporary accounts talk of some mottes being built in a matter of days, although these low figures have led to suggestions by historians that either these figures were an underestimate, or that <b>they</b> <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> the construction of a smaller design than that later seen on the sites concerned. Taking into account estimates of the likely available manpower during the period, historians estimate that the larger mottes might have taken between four and nine months to build. This contrasted favourably with stone keeps of the period, which typically took up to ten years to build. Very little skilled labour was required to build motte and bailey castles, which made them very attractive propositions if forced peasant labour was available, as was the case after the Norman invasion of England. Where the local workforce had to be paid – such as at Clones in Ireland, built in 1211 using imported labourers – the costs would rise quickly, in this case reaching £20.|$|E

50|$|Who <b>they</b> <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> is uncertain. John {{only makes}} clear that Peter and the Beloved Disciple were present, but it is {{possible}} that Mary Magdalene was also there at this point. Thus some scholars, such as Hartmann, believe <b>they</b> <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> Peter and Mary who were in ignorance while the Beloved Disciple did understand that Jesus had risen from the dead. The alternative is that <b>they</b> <b>refers</b> <b>to</b> Peter and the Beloved Disciple and shows that they were both still ignorant about the resurrection and that this verse thus clarifies the preceding one and confirms that the Beloved Disciple did not realize that Jesus had risen. Schnackenberg believes that John 20:8, and everything else <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> the Beloved Disciple, is a later addition to the chapter. In this model 20:9 would follow directly after 20:7 and would clearly be talking about Peter and Mary Magdalene.|$|R

25|$|The {{children}} {{access the}} virtual world through Internet-connected visors, which <b>they</b> <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> as megane, the usual term for protective or corrective eyeglasses. The visors allow them to see virtual reality superimposed on objective reality. To visually confirm something as virtual, the children often lift their visors from their eyes. The visors also work in conjunction with futuristic ear monitors placed behind the ear, which allow the wearer to hear sounds from the virtual environment.|$|E
