40|$|Banknote {{papers are}} {{automatically}} recognized and classified in various machines, such as vending machines, {{automatic teller machines}} (ATM), and banknote-counting machines. Previous studies on automatic classification <b>of</b> <b>banknotes</b> {{have been based on}} the optical characteristics <b>of</b> <b>banknote</b> papers. On each banknote image, there are regions more distinguishable than others in terms <b>of</b> <b>banknote</b> <b>types,</b> sides, and directions. However, there has been little previous research on banknote recognition that has addressed the selection of distinguishable areas. To overcome this problem, we propose a method for recognizing banknotes by selecting more discriminative regions based on similarity mapping, using images captured by a one-dimensional visible light line sensor. Experimental results with various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>banknote</b> databases show that our proposed method outperforms previous methods...|$|R

Apart from this, the banknote was reintroduced in 1985 by the Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) in green and yellow, followed by The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in 1986 in similar colours, but more green involved. The Bank of China issued their version in 1994 as a blue coloured banknote. These were standardised in 2004 when all three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>banknotes</b> were changed to a blue colour.|$|R
50|$|More notable {{than the}} actual house is to whom the house belonged. Jim Brown, the owner, was a notorious counterfeiter. This man {{generally}} sold five thousand dollars of fake, counterfeit bills for one thousand dollars of legitimate money, {{taking advantage of the}} contemporary economy. During the Revolutionary War, the Continental Congress authorized issuing American currency. This was a further step to gaining independence from England, no longer relying on English money. At the time, paper money was produced by banks (approximately sixteen hundred nationwide), regulated by state charters. With seven thousand different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>banknotes,</b> it was extremely difficult for anyone to determine which ones originated from legitimate sources.|$|R

Copper coins of the smallest nominal value of half kopeck were minted in 1925 - 1928.In 1923, the first Soviet gold coin (1 chervonets in nominal value) was minted. This conformed in all its features to the gold coin worth of 10 rubles of Russian Empire. It almost never appeared in circulation and was only used in foreign trade transactions.Starting from 1926, coins in nominal value 1, 2, 3 and 5 were made of bronze; starting from 1931, coins in nominal value 10, 15 and 20 kopecks were made of cuprum-nickel alloy.There has been a great variety of the first Soviet banknotes. In circulation were the Soviet chervonets (10 rubles) and the rubles designed to portray the symbols of the Soviet ideology. The <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>banknotes</b> <b>of</b> this period were often replacing each other.A monetary reform was passed in 1947 with a key objective to promote to a quick recovery of the war-suffered economy, withdrawal of counterfeit money from circulation and replacement of the old samples with new ones.The monetary reform of 1961 was aimed to change the price scale (10:1), improve the money cycle and issue <b>banknotes</b> <b>of</b> new design.

500|$|Municipalities {{suffered}} most, {{being forced}} to implement taxes, including the alcaba del viento (lit. [...] "wind tax"), which was imposed on foreign suppliers. However, these taxes barely helped, this was because each one had to receive a Royal certification, a bureaucratic procedure which usually lasted several years. Once they reached an established deadline, the process {{would have to be}} repeated, taking an extended amount of time. From January 1, 1636, to December 15, 1637, Philip IV of Spain imposed an obligatory payment to the treasuries in Puerto Rico. The debt was to be paid with currency symbolized by legalized papers bearing a Royal seal. Researchers believe that the use of these documents had an impact in the production <b>of</b> <b>banknotes</b> in Puerto Rico. In due time, these documents would be short in supply upon their arrival, in such cases the government officials would stamp the current date into old papers. Pedro Tomás de Cordova and Humberto Burzio claim in their research that Puerto Rico was the first place in America to print 8-real, establishing 1766 as the date for this achievement. Thus, putting Puerto Rico ahead by two decades before Cuba (1781), Hispaniola (1782) and even Spain (1783). Both researchers divided the first two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>banknotes</b> issued, the two varieties were classified as [...] "issued" [...] and [...] "printed". Although both were manufactured using the same method, those referred to as [...] "printed" [...] bore stamps listing numbers and letters. In 1767, the Spanish Crown approved subsequent issues, conditioning that they should be collected once situado shipped. When this was lacking, paper money was used in a widespread manner throughout the main island. These requirements were met when possible, an example of this was in 1769, when 88,000 banknotes were reclaimed by the authorities.|$|R
50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the October overturn in 1917 Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan left the Russian Empire soon to create the Transcaucasian Commissariat, an independent constituency. In February 1918, the Transcaucasian Commissariat issued notes in nominal value 1, 3, 5, 10, 50, 100 and 250 rubles. For the first time Armenian inscriptions appear on these notes, and the numismatic intelligence takes them as the first Armenian paper notes. Achieving independence on May 28, 1918, the first Republic of Armenia put the checks, as issued by Yerevan branch of the State Bank, into circulation. In summer <b>of</b> 1920, <b>banknotes</b> <b>of</b> the 1919 series were introduced in nominal value 50, 100 and 250 rubles. These were designed by H. Kojoyan and A. Fetvajyan and printed by “Waterloo & Sons Limited” in London. This issue stands apart with its original design as it uses national patterns and ornaments full of creativity. In 1921, Yerevan branch of the State Bank issued checks in nominal value 10000 rubles. Then <b>banknotes</b> <b>of</b> the 1921 series in nominal value 5000 and 10000 rubles came in. At some point later, <b>banknotes</b> <b>of</b> the 1922 series in nominal value 25000, 100000, 1 million and 5 million rubles as well as bills at par value of 5 million rubles were issued.In 1922 the three republics - Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan - united to constitute the Federative Union of Transcaucasian Soviet Socialist Republics. In 1923, the FUTSSR issued in banknotes in nominal value 1000, 5000, 10000, 25000, 50000, 100000, 250000, 500000, 1 million, 5 million and 10 million rubles.On December 13, 1922, the FUTSSR was re-organized into the Transcaucasian Soviet Socialist Federative Republic and began issuing banknotes in nominal value 25, 50, 75, 100, 250 million and 1 and 10 billion rubles. The 10 billion rubles banknote was never put into circulation. The 1923 series bill at par value of 1 chervonets was neither put into circulation.Shortly thereafter, these banknotes were replaced although the authorities of the Soviet Armenia had the December 20, 1920 decree stipulating that the circulation <b>of</b> <b>banknotes</b> <b>of</b> the Soviet Russia was mandatory, too. After formation of the Soviet Union, a monetary reform was passed with an April 15, 1924 government decree issuing resolution on substitution <b>of</b> all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>banknotes</b> in circulation in Transcaucasia for the <b>banknotes</b> <b>of</b> unified samples of the Soviet Union.|$|R
