40|$|It was {{observed}} that pressure of host immune system leads <b>to</b> <b>diversifying</b> selection (which {{can be measured}} in terms of pN/pS ratio). In this research we checked whether Plasmodium falciparum proteins containing experimentally evident epitopes from the IEDB database are subject <b>to</b> <b>diversifying</b> selection. We also investigated which life stage of this parasite and which proteins are subject to the strongest immune pressure. To answer these questions we used information about experimentally evident epitopes from Plasmodium, that interact with human immune system and sequences of different isolates of P. falciparum. We confirmed the expectations that proteins containing IEDB epitopes are subject <b>to</b> stronger <b>diversifying</b> selection which is evidenced by higher pN/pS ratio. A stage characterized by the highest average pN/pS ratio is that of the sporozoite. The greatest fraction of putative antigens is also present at this stage. We also found that the sporozoite stage is particularly interesting for further analysis as it potentially contains the highest number of unidentified epitopes...|$|R
