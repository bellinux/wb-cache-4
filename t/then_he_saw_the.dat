2500|$|In 1922 the Kuomintang-warlord {{alliance}} in Guangzhou was ruptured, and Sun fled to Shanghai. By <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> need to seek Soviet {{support for his}} cause. In 1923 a joint statement by Sun and a Soviet representative in Shanghai pledged Soviet assistance for China's national unification. Soviet advisers—the most prominent of whom was {{an agent of the}} Comintern, Mikhail Borodin—began to arrive in China in 1923 to aid in the reorganization and consolidation of the Kuomintang {{along the lines of the}} Communist Party of the Soviet Union and establish the First United Front. The CCP was under Comintern instructions to cooperate with the Kuomintang, and its members were encouraged to join while maintaining their party identities to form a [...] "bloc within." ...|$|E
2500|$|One night, Ibrahim {{went up to}} the mountain, {{leaned against}} a rock, and looked up to the sky. He saw a shining star and said to himself, [...] "Could this be my Lord?" [...] But when it set he said: [...] "I don't like those that set." [...] The star had {{disappeared}} so it could not be God. God is always present. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> moon rising in splendor and said, [...] "Could this be my Lord?" [...] but the moon also set. At daybreak, he saw the sun rising and said, [...] "Could this be my Lord? This is the biggest and brightest!" [...] But when the sun also set he said, [...] "O my people! I am free from all that you join as partners with Allah! I have turned my face towards Allah who created the heavens and the earth and never shall I associate partners with Allah. Our Lord is the creator of the heavens and the earth and everything in between. He has the power to make the stars rise and set." [...] After this declaration, Ibrahim then heard Allah calling him, [...] "O Ibrahim!" [...] Ibrahim trembled and said, [...] "Here I am O my Lord!" [...] Allah replied, [...] "Submit to Me! Be a Muslim!" [...] Ibrahim fell to the ground, crying. He said: [...] "I submit to the Lord of the universe!" [...] Ibrahim kept prostrating himself until nightfall. He then got up and went back to his home, in peace and full of conviction that Allah has guided him to the truth.|$|E
2500|$|Late in the {{day they}} heard , the Big Giant, approaching. [...] His {{footsteps}} shook the canyon walls. Then they saw him come to the water's edge and stoop down to drink. He drank deeply four times, until most of the water was gone from the lake. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> reflection of the twins in the water, and stood and stared at them. [...] he shouted. The twins did not understand, but answered, [...] Then [...] {{paced back and forth}} and said, [...] "What are the two beautiful things that I see, and how shall I kill them?" [...] The twins shouted back, [...] "What beautiful Big Thing is walking about? [...] And how shall we kill it?" [...] , the Wind came to them and whispered in their ear that since Big Giant was their elder he should be given right of first strike, as they were destroying the child of the Sun. Then suddenly , the Wind, called [...] "Akóóh! Beware! Jump!" [...] and suddenly the twins found themselves standing {{on the end of a}} rainbow, just as , the Big Giant, hurled his great black knife at them. The rainbow raised up, and the knife passed just below their feet. [...] , the Wind, whispered [...] "Keep low now!" [...] and [...] hurled his great blue knife. [...] It passed over them. [...] The Wind said, [...] "Jump to the right!" [...] and the great yellow knife of [...] passed just to their left. [...] "This is his last weapon," [...] whispered the Wind. [...] "Jump to the left. Now!" [...] The twins leapt to the left, just as the white knife with many points passed to the right of them." [...] The twins were about to use one of their own weapons when a blinding flash of lightning came out of the sky and struck [...] the Giant on the side of the head. [...] The heavens shook with the thunder, and the Giant shook but stayed on his feet. [...] Then the elder of the two brothers shot a chain-lightning arrow at [...] [...] The Giant dropped to his knee, but stood again. [...] The second brother then shot an arrow of sheet lightning which struck the giant in the chest. [...] He fell to both knees and began to fall forward, catching himself with his hands. [...] Then the first brother shot a deadly sunbeam arrow and hit the Giant in the head. [...] fell face down on the ground. [...] Blood flowed in great streams from the Giant's mouth, and , the Wind said, [...] "Stop the blood before it reaches the water! It will become alive!" [...] The twins ran to block the flow of blood and it remains on the ground today near the spring at the foot of , the Blue Bead Mountain.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> as <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> blood rise to Wyllard's {{forehead}} {{he broke}} off with a little soft laugh.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then,</b> as <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> half-veiled {{amusement}} in her eyes, a light {{seemed to}} break in on him.|$|R
60|$|Shirley did not {{hand him}} the lantern, but the captain {{took it from}} him, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>the</b> man was very pale.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> bandage {{about her}} brow, {{and was very}} penitent.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> set {{expression}} of Azuma-zi's eyes as the Asiatic {{came out of}} the shadow towards him.|$|E
6000|$|... "By zounds!" [...] {{said the}} lieutenant. [...] "I do believe they're firing on the boat!" [...] And <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> boat turn and begin pulling toward them.|$|E
60|$|The man {{was startled}} and slackened his pace. <b>Then,</b> when <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> youth raise his shotgun, he let up {{a cry of}} fear.|$|R
60|$|He {{caught up}} his stick and hat, and {{followed}} her. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>the</b> color {{in her cheeks}} was not wholly natural. She was nervous and excited.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>the</b> cloudy grey disc {{had taken}} depth and colour, had assumed the {{appearance}} of an oval window looking out upon a strange unfamiliar scene.|$|R
60|$|Mok {{not only}} trod with the {{softness}} and swiftness of a panther, {{but he had}} eyes like that animal, {{and if there were}} any light at all, those eyes could make good use of it. As he neared the two men, he saw that one was scolding the other. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> other man drop down on his knees. Then, being still nearer, he perceived that the man on his knees was Cheditafa. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> man in front of him draw a knife from under his coat.|$|E
6000|$|The pause was unexpected. Jessie {{had some}} trouble with a crumb. Mr. Hoopdriver's face passed through several phases of surprise. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> explanation. [...] "Had an accident?" ...|$|E
60|$|Macheson woke {{with the}} daylight, stiff, a little tired, and haunted with the {{consciousness}} of disturbing dreams. He sprang {{to his feet and}} stretched himself. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> roses.|$|E
6000|$|... "Might {{as well go}} back," [...] he said to Dick, <b>then</b> as <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> boy start <b>he</b> continued: [...] "What's up? Do yer see {{anything}} of her?" ...|$|R
60|$|Halliday {{ran for the}} ball, but {{was only}} {{able to get it}} on the first bounce. <b>Then,</b> as <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> batsman {{rounding}} first for second, he threw the ball wildly.|$|R
60|$|Frank {{drank some}} of the brandy and water and sat down for a few minutes. <b>Then,</b> when <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> surgeon {{at the other end}} of the room, he got up and went across to Lechmere's bed.|$|R
60|$|Isaac {{looked up}} in amazement at me and Melissa craning our necks {{over the edge of}} the roof. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> dog and took in the situation. The {{creature}} actually grinned.|$|E
60|$|Jonathan's {{attention}} was now directed from the maple grove to the hunter beside him. He {{had heard a}} slight metallic click, as Wetzel cocked his rifle. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> black barrel slowly rise.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> bear {{standing}} beside him, {{looking at him}} with gentle, beseeching eyes, and something {{in the eyes of}} the bear made him say: 'Take off that skin, some mystery is hidden beneath it.' ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Vyner {{looked up}} at him suddenly, his face hard and forbidding. <b>Then,</b> as <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> embarrassment in the kindly old face before him, his anger {{vanished}} and he bent his head to hide a smile.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, my lad," [...] said he; [...] "such is my name, to be sure. And who may you be?" [...] And <b>then</b> as <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> squire's letter, <b>he</b> {{seemed to}} me to give {{something}} almost like a start.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] {{he murmured}} as he {{gathered}} his scattered senses and arose slowly to his feet. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>the</b> torch {{was on the}} point of going out and he made a dash for it, and swung it once again into a faint blaze.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> feet of {{his brother}} under the door, and he fled, his brother {{following}} him; and he cried to Ra, and Ra heard him, and {{between him and his}} brother made a great water flow full of crocodiles.|$|E
6000|$|Lemuel {{expected}} {{himself to}} cast the thief off with bitter rejection. But he heard himself saying hopelessly, [...] "Go away, and try to behave yourself," [...] and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> thief {{make the most of}} the favour of heaven and vanish through the crowd.|$|E
60|$|The man stared and {{hesitated a}} moment. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> face, and {{shut his eyes}} convulsively. He turned on his heel before he opened them, so {{that he should not}} see Holroyd again, and went out of the shed to get advice and help.|$|E
60|$|Larry {{pushed the}} front door open, grunting. He set his {{briefcase}} down and took off his hat. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> Bob for <b>the</b> first time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hurrah! {{that did}} the trick!" [...] cried the boy, in deep satisfaction, and <b>then,</b> as <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> moose plowing off through the {{deepening}} snow, he jumped {{to the ground and}} rushed off to where he had dropped his gun. Perhaps he could lay the beast low after all.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> {{suddenly}} <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> ridiculous {{side of the}} situation. The {{notion that}} he should have murdered anyone in order to marry Doris! If they only knew how miserably bored he was. Poor, dear Janet! She had tried to be malicious; she had only succeeded in being stupid.|$|R
60|$|In the afternoon, {{about an}} hour before sunset, the train arrived at the station where Lord Harry was to get down. The station-master {{recognised}} him, and touched his hat. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> two other men got down after him, and he turned pale.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tom! Tom! What {{happened}} to you?" [...] he cried, in horror, when he beheld his brother on the ground. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> footstool and a cut on Tom's head and understood what had occurred. The dangling rope told {{the rest of}} the story.|$|E
6000|$|There {{presently}} {{came the}} sound of a bell, and Mr. Ledbetter was taken to the back door and instructed to open it. A fair-haired man in yachting costume entered. At the sight of Mr. Ledbetter he started violently and clapped his hand behind him. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> stout man. [...] "Bingham!" [...] he cried, [...] "who's this?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw,</b> through <b>the</b> {{bars of the}} gate, that a great cavern lay beyond, {{in which}} were stacked treasures of all sorts: rich cloths, golden dishes and ornaments, gemmed coronets and bracelets, cleverly forged armor, shields and battle-axes. Also there were casks and bales of {{merchandise}} of every sort.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Sadler, {{still holding}} the fire-shovel sceptre-fashion and still with the paper cap on his head, {{opened his mouth to}} reply. <b>Then,</b> as <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> unkempt figure of Mr. Hatchard with the scared face of Mrs. Hatchard peeping over his shoulder, his face grew red, his eyes watered, and his cheeks swelled.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned away}} almost abruptly, and Winston stood still {{with one hand}} closed tightly and a little deeper tint in the bronze of his face, {{sensible}} at once of an unchanged resolution and a horrible degradation. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>the</b> Colonel had helped Miss Barrington into the saddle and her niece was speaking.|$|R
