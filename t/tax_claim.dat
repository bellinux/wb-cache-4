5|$|Mitchell {{turned himself}} in to {{authorities}} on March 12, 2012, after being indicted on federal tax fraud charges. He was arraigned on March 22 on the charges, and a warrant for his arrest in Indiana for failure to pay child support led to his incarceration in Orange County, Florida. In May 2012, Mitchell {{filed a lawsuit against}} a married couple, who were defendants in his previous charges, citing fraud, breach of contract, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Mitchell pleaded guilty on March 8, 2013, to one count of conspiring to file a false <b>tax</b> <b>claim</b> with the federal government. At a hearing on October 24, 2013, in Orlando, Florida, he claimed that his crime stemmed from concussions he suffered during his career in the NFL, adding that he suffers from headaches, insomnia, and memory loss. That memory loss was cited as a possible reason for his failing to pay child support in that case as well. His attorneys asked the judge in the case that Mitchell only be sentenced to community service and probation. On October 29, he was sentenced to serve 37 months in prison. He began his sentence on December 6.|$|E
25|$|The {{portrait}} is {{the final}} and most fully representative work of Klimt's golden phase. It {{was the first of}} two depictions of Adele by Klimt—the second was completed in 1912; these were two of several works by the artist that the family owned. Adele died in 1925; her will asked that the artworks by Klimt were to be left to the Galerie Belvedere, although these belonged to Ferdinand, not her. Following the Anschluss of Austria by Nazi Germany, Ferdinand fled Vienna, and made his way to Switzerland, leaving behind much of his wealth, including his large art collection. The painting was stolen by the Nazis in 1941, along with the remainder of Ferdinand's assets, after a false charge of tax evasion was made against him. The assets raised from the purported sales of artwork, property and his sugar business were offset against the <b>tax</b> <b>claim.</b> The lawyer acting on behalf of the German state gave the portrait to the Galerie Belvedere, claiming he was following the wishes Adele had made in her will. Ferdinand died in 1946; his will stated that his estate should go to his nephew and two nieces.|$|E

40|$|Sorry, {{the full}} text of this article is not {{available}} in Huskie Commons. Please click on the alternative location to access it. 221 p. The purpose of the dissertation is to determine the effect of variables hypothesized to be most important in changing the strength of <b>tax</b> expenditure <b>claims</b> on state financial resources and to determine if some types of <b>tax</b> expenditure <b>claims</b> might respond differently to those variables. Tax expenditures are conceptualized as features of tax policy that eliminate or reduce the tax liability of certain groups or categories of taxpayers. They represent claims on financial resources, just like budget requests that receive direct appropriations. They are "weak" or "strong" {{to the extent that they}} are successful in becoming and/or remaining part of the tax code. A market-based theory of budgeting was employed to deduce causal variables and hypotheses. Four causal variables [...] fiscal condition, the tax burden, legislative budget procedures that expose tax expenditures to scrutiny and competition, and the availability of information about tax expenditures [...] when found in certain ideal combinations, were hypothesized to either minimize or maximize the strength of <b>tax</b> expenditure <b>claims.</b> A comparative case study methodology was used to evaluate the effect of the causal variables on <b>tax</b> expenditure <b>claims.</b> Four states were selected for study: Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Changes in tax expenditure provisions were examined in the four states over a fourteen-year period, 1980 - 1993. The case studies also examined income tax revisions where tax expenditures were repealed in order to reduce marginal rates. The four causal variables were found to be influential in determining the strength of <b>tax</b> expenditure <b>claims.</b> However, <b>tax</b> expenditure <b>claims</b> can also be weakened when states attempt to reduce the burden in one tax by repealing tax expenditures that apply to another tax, thus shifting the tax burden from one tax to another. Tax expenditures that are targeted at increasing investment to spur economic development can be very strong claims, even when the combination of causal variables predicts weak <b>tax</b> expenditure <b>claims.</b> Efforts to reduce high marginal income tax rates were also found to weaken <b>tax</b> expenditure <b>claims...</b>|$|R
