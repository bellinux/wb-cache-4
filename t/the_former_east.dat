5|$|Both {{stations}} {{closed in}} the 1960s {{as part of the}} Beeching Axe. Shepton Mallet (High Street) closed with the withdrawal of passenger services on the Yatton to Witham line in 1963, though part of <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>East</b> Somerset line remains open for freight and as a heritage railway. Shepton Mallet (Charlton Road) closed in 1966 with the closure of the Somerset and Dorset line. Nowadays, the nearest Network Rail station is Castle Cary, some eight miles south of Shepton Mallet. However, the nearest station on the East Somerset Railway is Mendip Vale, which is {{a mile and a half}} away.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, many East Germans cut the coat of arms out of their flags, as Hungarians had done in 1956 and as Romanians would soon do during {{the fall of}} Ceaușescu. The {{widespread}} act of removing the coat of arms from the East German flag implied the plain black-red-gold tricolour as symbol for a united and democratic Germany. Finally, on 3 October 1990, as the area of the German Democratic Republic was absorbed into the Federal Republic of Germany, the black-red-gold tricolour became the flag of a reunified Germany. In 1998, the Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship was formed. The duty of this organisation, directly responsible to the federal government, is to examine the consequences of <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>East</b> German regime. As its logo, the foundation used an East German flag with the Communist coat of arms cut out.|$|E

5|$|County Bus & Coach {{took over}} the former London Country North East garages at Harlow, Grays and Hertford. Under AJS's {{ownership}} it was managed by Graham Willet, previously London Country Bus Services' chief engineer. The company enjoyed some expansion: small independent Sampson Coaches and its garage at Hoddesdon were bought in February 1989; however, {{as a result of}} this, Hertford garage was vacated and sold for redevelopment by its owners Parkdale Holdings. The Debden and Wyatts Green depots and some local routes of <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>East</b> Midland owned Frontrunner operation were acquired in July 1989. County Bus & Coach's fleet policy was to use Mercedes-Benz minibuses on most routes, including in Grays when Lakeside Shopping Centre opened and when two London contracted routes were run; {{there is some evidence that}} passengers did not like these vehicles, and their use is thought to have reduced patronage in the area.|$|E
5|$|On the {{southern}} {{side of the}} town, on a triangle of land bounded on the east by the A37, on the north by the line of <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>East</b> Somerset Railway, and on the west by Cannard's Grave Road, is Tadley Acres, a modern housing development built on land partly belonging to the Duchy of Cornwall. The development has been praised {{for the quality of}} its design and the use of locally sourced natural building materials. North of the former railway line is Collett Park. Across Cannard's Grave Road from Tadley Acres is the Mid-Somerset Showground. Immediately to the south-west of the town centre, on a site which {{at the start of the}} 20th century had been the grounds of the former Summerleaze House and then a shoe-factory, is the Townsend Retail Park, built in 2006–7.|$|E
5|$|Pressured by the United Nations, {{which had}} looked at the {{situation}} in <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>East</b> Indies with disdain, on 29August 1947 the Dutch established the Van Mook Line, which divided Dutch and Indonesian-controlled areas. Along this line a ceasefire was called. Sudirman recalled the Indonesian guerrillas hiding in Dutch-held lands, ordering them to return to Indonesian-held areas. To keep their spirits up, {{he referred to the}} withdrawal as a hijrah, reminiscent of Muhammad's migration to Medina in 622AD, implying that they would return. Over 35,000troops left western Java at this order, travelling to Yogyakarta by train and ship. This boundary was formalised by the Renville Agreement on 17January 1948; among the signatories was Amir Sjarifuddin, by then also serving as prime minister. Meanwhile, Sjarifuddin began rationalising the army, cutting back on the number of troops. At the time the regular army consisted of 350,000men, with a further 470,000in the laskar.|$|E

Some accounts claim that Albert Anastasia and Frank Scalise were the shooters that day, although Valachi wrote that Buster was responsible.|$|R
5|$|Stuart William Morgan is an English {{lorry driver}} and former heating {{engineer}} from Poole. One {{of five children}} of John and Julianne Morgan, {{he was raised in}} Tunbridge Wells, Kent, where his father was employed as a council foreman and his mother– a refugee from <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>East</b> Germany– worked as a school cleaner. Morgan left school with three CSEs, and in 1974 served a custodial sentence in borstal following a conviction for burglary. After attending Croydon Polytechnic to train as a plumber and heating engineer, he established a plumbing business in the Tunbridge Wells area. He moved to Dorset following the failure of that business in 1983 and worked as a heating engineer for Bournemouth Borough Council. He became a lorry driver in 1991.|$|E
5|$|Early plans also {{included}} a northsouth freeway {{on each side of}} the Los Angeles Central Business District, splitting at the merge of the Harbor Parkway (Harbor Freeway) and Venice Parkway northeast of the University of Southern California, and rejoining at the split between the Arroyo Seco Parkway (Pasadena Freeway) and Riverside Parkway south of Dodger Stadium. Initially known as the East By-Pass and West By-Pass, the latter later became part of the Harbor Parkway, while the former remained as a separate route roughly along Main Street. The state legislature added the East By-Pass to the state highway system in 1947 as Route 222. The Los Angeles City Planning Commission approved a revised master plan in mid-1955, based on various studied that had been made. A new Industrial Freeway replaced the Terminal Island Freeway and Alamitos Parkway between Terminal Island and downtown Los Angeles, where it then continued north along <b>the</b> <b>former</b> <b>East</b> By-Pass (which was not kept south of the Santa Monica Freeway) and the southern part of the Riverside Parkway to the interchange of the Glendale Freeway and Golden State Freeway (which had replaced the rest of the Riverside Parkway). The Industrial Freeway south of the Santa Monica Freeway became Route 270 in 1959, but the ex-Riverside Parkway piece north of the Arroyo Seco Parkway never became a state highway.|$|E
