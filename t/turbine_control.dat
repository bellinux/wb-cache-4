40|$|Large {{numbers of}} bats {{are killed by}} wind {{turbines}} worldwide and minimizing fatalities is critically important to bat conservation and acceptance of wind energy development. We implemented a 2 -year study testing the effectiveness of an ultrasonic acoustic deterrent for reducing bat fatalities at a wind energy facility in Pennsylvania. We randomly selected <b>control</b> and treatment <b>turbines</b> that were searched daily in summer and fall 2009 and 2010. Estimates of fatality, corrected for field biases, were compared between treatment and <b>control</b> <b>turbines.</b> In 2009, we estimated 21 – 51 % fewer bats were killed per treatment <b>turbine</b> than per <b>control</b> <b>turbine.</b> In 2010, we determined an approximate 9 % inherent difference between treatment and <b>control</b> <b>turbines</b> and when factored into our analysis, variation increased and between 2 % more and 64 % fewer bats were killed per treatment <b>turbine</b> relative to <b>control</b> <b>turbines.</b> We estimated twice as many hoary bats were killed per <b>control</b> <b>turbine</b> than treatment turbine, and nearly twice as many silver-haired bats in 2009. In 2010, although we estimated nearly twice as many hoary bats and nearly 4 times as many silver-haired bats killed per <b>control</b> <b>turbine</b> than at treatment turbines during the treatment period, these only represented an approximate 20 % increase in fatality relative to the pre-treatment period for these species when accounting for inherent differences between turbine sets. Our findings suggest broadband ultrasound broadcasts may reduce bat fatalities by discouraging bats from approaching sound sources. However, effectiveness of ultrasonic deterrents is limited by distance and area ultrasound ca...|$|R

50|$|Blade {{pitch control}} is a feature of nearly all large modern horizontal-axis wind turbines. While {{operating}}, a wind <b>turbine's</b> <b>control</b> system adjusts the blade pitch to keep the rotor speed within operating limits as the wind speed changes. Feathering the blades stops the rotor during emergency shutdowns, or whenever the wind speed exceeds the maximum rated speed. During construction and maintenance of wind turbines, the blades are usually feathered to reduce unwanted rotational torque {{in the event of}} wind gusts.|$|R
40|$|Until now, wind <b>turbine</b> <b>controls</b> {{that reduce}} {{the impacts of}} wind gusts and {{turbulence}} were always reactive - responding to the wind rather than anticipating it. But with today's laser-based sensors that measure wind speed ahead of the turbine, researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and their industry partners are developing more intelligent controls. The world's first field tests of these controls are currently underway at the National Wind Technology Center (NWTC) at NREL, with plans for future commercialization...|$|R
50|$|Acoustic {{resonance}} technology enables measurement {{within a}} small cavity, the sensors therefore {{tend to be}} typically smaller in size than other ultrasonic sensors. The small size of acoustic resonance anemometers makes them physically strong and easy to heat and therefore resistant to icing. This combination of features means that they achieve high levels of data availability and are well suited to wind <b>turbine</b> <b>control</b> and to other uses that require small robust sensors such as battlefield meteorology. One issue with this sensor type is measurement accuracy when compared to a calibrated mechanical sensor. For many end uses, this weakness is compensated for by the sensor's longevity {{and the fact that}} it does not require re-calibrating once installed.|$|E
50|$|Typically, an {{automatic}} controller operates the turbine inlet valve to maintain constant speed (and frequency) when the load {{changes on the}} generator. In a system connected to a grid with multiple sources, the <b>turbine</b> <b>control</b> ensures that power always flows out from the generator to the system. The frequency of the alternating current generated needs to match the local standard utility frequency. In some systems, if the useful load on the generator is not high enough, a load bank may be automatically connected to the generator to dissipate energy not required by the load; while this wastes energy, it may be required if it's not possible to control the water flow through the turbine.|$|E

The reactor had been operating at 6 percent power output at the time. Plant instruments indicated three of 185 control rods used {{to shut down the}} reactor were not fully inserted triggering the emergency declaration.

40|$|Physically {{measuring}} the dynamic responses of wind turbine support structures enables {{the calculation of}} the applied loads using an inverse procedure. In this process, inverse means deriving the inputs/forces from the outputs/responses. This paper presents results of a numerical verification of such an inverse load calculation. For this verification, the comprehensive simulation code FAST is used. FAST accounts for the coupled dynamics of wind inflow, aerodynamics, elasticity and <b>turbine</b> <b>controls.</b> Simulations are run using a 5 -MW onshore wind turbine model with a tubular tower. Both the applied loads due to the instantaneous wind field and the resulting system responses are known from the simulations. Using the system responses as inputs to the inverse calculation, the applied loads are calculated, {{which in this case}} are the rotor thrust forces. These forces are compared to the rotor thrust forces known from the FAST simulations. The results of these comparisons are presented to assess the accuracy of the inverse calculation. To study the influences of <b>turbine</b> <b>controls,</b> load cases in normal operation between cut-in and rated wind speed, near rated wind speed and between rated and cut-out wind speed are chosen. The presented study shows that the inverse load calculation is capable of computing very good estimates of the rotor thrust. The accuracy of the inverse calculation does not depend on the control activity of the wind turbine...|$|R
50|$|During an {{extended}} power uprate test on March 5, 2002 (designed {{to extend the}} power efficiency of existing BWR reactors), Quad Cities Unit 2 began to experience vibrations in a steam line. On March 29 the plant was manually shut down due to high vibrations causing leaks in the main <b>turbine</b> <b>control</b> system. Unit 2 was restarted on April 2, but vibration broke a main steam pipe drain line. The line was repaired and the restart resumed, but by June 7 the main steam lines were showing unexplained aberrations. The plant was again taken offline for repairs on July 11, and the problem was traced to {{a hole in the}} steam dryer. The steam dryer was repaired and Unit 2 was restarted on July 21, 2002.

50|$|Utility-scale {{wind turbine}} {{generators}} have minimum temperature operating limits which apply in areas that experience temperatures below -20 C. Wind turbines must be protected from ice accumulation. It can make anemometer readings inaccurate and which, in certain <b>turbine</b> <b>control</b> designs, can cause high structure loads and damage. Some turbine manufacturers offer low-temperature packages at a few percent extra cost, which include internal heaters, different lubricants, and different alloys for structural elements. If the low-temperature interval is combined with a low-wind condition, the wind turbine will require an external supply of power, equivalent to a few percent of its rated power, for internal heating. For example, the St. Leon Wind Farm in Manitoba, Canada, has a total rating of 99 MW and is estimated to need up to 3 MW (around 3% of capacity) of station service power a few days a year for temperatures down to -30 C. This factor affects the economics of wind turbine operation in cold climates.|$|E

After teaching mathematics at the University of Michigan, at the Case Institute of Technology, at Illinois Institute of Technology, and at DePaul University, he changed the focus of his research from pure mathematics to mechanical engineering and automatic control. He was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in 1936 at Oslo. For the academic year 1937-38 he was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. Among his engineering achievements are many contributions {{in the fields of}} prime-mover speed governors, in particular electric governors for hydraulic turbines, diesel governors with optimum non-linear control, and a new type of hydraulic governor without dashpots. He also developed a computer-type gas <b>turbine</b> <b>control,</b> a signal stabilization device, and a rapid method of finding the roots of algebraic equations especially for the problem of control design. In 1956 he was named professor of engineering science and mechanical engineering at Purdue, later being appointed professor of electrical and mechanical engineering, and then professor of mechanical engineering in the School of Mechanical Engineering. He was also the founder and Director of the Automatic Control Center at Purdue. Author of two books and editor-co-author of five others, Oldenburger wrote some 110 papers. Forty of these were on pure mathematics devoted to higher dimensional determinants and matrices, higher degree polynomials and forms, and symbolic dynamics.

40|$|As {{wind energy}} becomes a larger {{portion of the}} world’s energy {{portfolio}} and wind turbines become larger and more expensive, wind <b>turbine</b> <b>control</b> systems play an ever more prominent role {{in the design and}} deployment of wind turbines. The goals of traditional wind <b>turbine</b> <b>control</b> systems are maximizing energy production while protecting the wind turbine components. As more wind generation is installed there is an increasing interest in wind turbines actively controlling their power output in order to meet power set‐ points and to participate in frequency regulation for the utility grid.
