25|$|There {{are three}} aspects to ballistics: {{internal}} ballistics, external ballistics, and terminal ballistics. Internal ballistics refers {{to things that}} happen inside the firearm during and after firing but before the bullet leaves the muzzle. The handloading process can realize increased accuracy and precision through improved consistency of manufacture, by selecting the optimal bullet weight and design, and tailoring bullet velocity to the purpose. Each cartridge reloaded can have each component carefully matched {{to the rest of}} the cartridges in the batch. Brass cases can be matched by volume, weight, and concentricity, bullets by weight and design, powder charges by weight, <b>type,</b> <b>case</b> filling (amount of total usable case capacity filled by charge), and packing scheme (characteristics of granule packing).|$|E
25|$|Having {{previously}} {{worked as a}} professional goldsmith, Gutenberg made skillful use of the knowledge of metals he had learned as a craftsman. He {{was the first to}} make type from an alloy of lead, tin, and antimony, which was critical for producing durable type that produced high-quality printed books and proved to be much better suited for printing than all other known materials. To create these lead types, Gutenberg used what is considered one of his most ingenious inventions, a special matrix enabling the quick and precise molding of new type blocks from a uniform template. His <b>type</b> <b>case</b> is estimated to have contained around 290 separate letter boxes, most of which were required for special characters, ligatures, punctuation marks, and so forth.|$|E
25|$|Wooden {{movable type}} {{had been used}} and experimented with by Bi Sheng in the 11th century, but it was {{discarded}} because wood was judged to be an unsuitable material to use. Wang improved the earlier experimented process by adding the methods of specific type cutting and finishing, making the <b>type</b> <b>case</b> and revolving table that made the process more efficient. In Wang's system, all the Chinese writing characters were organized by five different tones and according to rhyming, using a standard official book of Chinese rhymes. Two revolving tables were actually used in the process; one table that had official types {{from the book of}} rhymes, and the other which contained the most frequently used Chinese writing characters for quick selection. To make the entire process more efficient, each Chinese character was assigned a different number, so that when a number was called, that writing character would be selected. Rare and unusual characters that were not prescribed a number were simply crafted on the spot by wood-cutters when needed.|$|E

30|$|Here, {{we found}} {{two types of}} laminolysis: hemilaminar <b>type</b> (<b>cases</b> 1 and 2) and intralaminar <b>type</b> (<b>cases</b> 3 and 4). The former has a cleft in the {{unilateral}} pars and the latter has a coronal fracture line though both laminae. In a biomechanical study, Sairyo et al. reported that extension loading causes a more coronally oriented fracture line, while rotational loading causes a more sagittally oriented fracture line [10]. Therefore, the intralaminar type is considered to result from a stress fracture due to repetitive extension loading. In the presence of hemilateral spondylolysis, axial rotation of the contralateral pedicle and pars interarticularis increases stress an average of 6.8 -fold, with a 12.6 -fold increase being the highest [5].|$|R
