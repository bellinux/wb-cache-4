5|$|Central Indiana {{was struck}} by a major flood in 2008, leading <b>to</b> <b>widespread</b> damage and the {{evacuations}} {{of hundreds of thousands of}} residents. It was the costliest disaster in the history of the state, with early damage estimates topping $1billion.|$|E
5|$|Due to the erratic {{movement}} of the storm along the Texas coastline, significant rainfall fell in areas near the center and in parts of Louisiana. This led <b>to</b> <b>widespread</b> flooding, especially of farmland, that left $6million in damages. Five people were killed during the storm.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} serious crop {{failures}} in the late 19th century led <b>to</b> <b>widespread</b> famines on the subcontinent {{in which it is}} estimated that over 15 million people died. The East India Company had failed to implement any coordinated policy to deal with the famines during its period of rule. Later, under direct British rule, commissions were set up after each famine to investigate the causes and implement new policies, which took until the early 1900s to have an effect.|$|E

5|$|Cagney, born in 1899 (prior <b>to</b> <b>widespread</b> use of automobiles), loved horses from childhood. As a child, {{he often}} {{sat on the}} horses of local deliverymen, and rode in horse-drawn streetcars with his mother. As an adult, well after horses were {{replaced}} by automobiles as the primary mode of transportation, Cagney raised horses on his farms, specializing in Morgans, a breed {{of which he was}} particularly fond.|$|E
5|$|Crinolines {{were worn}} by women of every social {{standing}} and class across the Western world, from royalty to factory workers. This led <b>to</b> <b>widespread</b> media scrutiny and criticism, particularly in satirical magazines such as Punch. They were also hazardous if worn without due care. Thousands of women {{died in the}} mid-19th century {{as a result of}} their hooped skirts catching fire. Alongside fire, other hazards included the hoops being caught in machinery, carriage wheels, gusts of wind, or other obstacles.|$|E
5|$|Danny {{had only}} minor effects on land. However, it {{triggered}} high surf and rip currents from Florida through the Mid-Atlantic states, {{leading to the}} death of a 12-year-old boy in North Carolina. The cyclone's remnants contributed <b>to</b> <b>widespread</b> rainfall in the northeast United States. At one point, some weather forecasts predicted Danny to rapidly strengthen, and hit Nantucket as a Category 1 Hurricane, although this never occurred. Localized flooding was reported, particularly in Pennsylvania. It later caused heavy precipitation and power outages in Atlantic Canada.|$|E

5|$|Flooding rains {{extended}} into Pakistan by July26. Flash floods {{in the slums}} outside Karachi killed at least 16 people and washed away 500 huts. An estimated 20,000 people were left homeless in the city. Communication and transportation throughout Karachi was reportedly paralyzed as well due <b>to</b> <b>widespread</b> power outages. Further north in Hyderabad, six others {{were killed by the}} storm. Throughout the country, at least 31 people were killed.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Ma-on posed {{a slight}} {{threat to the}} Mariana Islands and {{prompted}} the issuance of tropical storm warnings. However, the system remained {{far away from the}} area and only produced scattered rainfall. In Japan, hundreds of people evacuated from mudslide-prone areas. Torrential rains produced by the storm, estimated at more than 1,200mm (48in), led <b>to</b> <b>widespread</b> and damaging floods. Five people perished as a result of Ma-on, and damage reached ¥3.9billion (2011JPY, $50million 2011USD).|$|E

5|$|It {{was in the}} 19th {{century that}} Leeds began to grow into one of Britain's largest cities. This led <b>to</b> <b>widespread</b> {{building}} across the city. Leeds' wool and cloth trades resulted {{in the building of}} many industrial buildings during this era. The resulting workforce which migrated to the city from rural areas brought about the building of many houses. Leeds has perhaps the most surviving examples of back-to-back terrace housing in the UK, particularly in Holbeck and Harehills.|$|E
5|$|Marquee Moon was {{released}} <b>to</b> <b>widespread</b> critical acclaim and unexpected commercial {{success in the}} United Kingdom, but sold poorly in the United States.

The film was released through the studio's Family Entertainment division on December 25, 1993 <b>to</b> <b>widespread</b> acclaim from critics, who praised the animation, voice performances, storyline and music. However, due to the decision to release it in theaters on short notice, Mask of the Phantasm failed at the box office.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the end of}} the Civil War, the United States had {{experienced}} panics of varying severity. Economists Charles Calomiris and Gary Gorton rate the worst panics as those leading <b>to</b> <b>widespread</b> bank suspensions—the panics of 1873, 1893, and 1907, and a suspension in 1914. Widespread suspensions were forestalled through coordinated actions during both the 1884 and the 1890 panics. A bank crisis in 1896, in which there was a perceived need for coordination, is also sometimes classified as a panic.|$|E

5|$|The Mikea are {{culturally}} and linguistically {{nearly identical to}} the neighboring Vezo fishing clan and Masikoro herding and farming clan of the Sakalava; only the traditional source of livelihood distinguishes the three groups. The popular association of the Mikea with the ancestral Vazimba clan has contributed <b>to</b> <b>widespread</b> belief that the Mikea possess Vazimba attributes, such as being small in stature, unclothed, shy and avoidant of contact with outsiders, and living in perfect harmony with the natural environment. None of these are borne out by evidence.|$|E
5|$|The TSB made nine {{recommendations}} {{relating to}} changes in aircraft materials (testing, certification, inspection, and maintenance), electrical systems, and flight data capture, as both flight recorders had stopped when they lost power six minutes before impact. General recommendations were also made regarding improvements in checklists and in fire-detection and fire-fighting equipment and training. These recommendations have led <b>to</b> <b>widespread</b> changes in FAA standards, principally impacting wiring and fire hardening.|$|E
