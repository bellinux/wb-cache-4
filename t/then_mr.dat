When Bonnie, Lois and Cleveland's new girlfriend come to dance at The Drunken Clam, they state {{that they would}} like to make the bar their place to hang out, after Peter grabs Joe's gun and kills himself. It turns out that this was only Peter's imagination as he snaps out of it when Joe starts talking to him; Peter answers that he was having a Scrubs fantasy moment. Quagmire responds to Peter's moment by stating that Scrubs is the best show people are not watching. Cleveland replies that he hates shows that leave the story for a gag or joke, referring to the numerous cutaways Scrubs and Family Guy contain. While in the hospital Peter realizes that Mr. Pewterschmidt and Dr. Hartman have a similar voice, <b>then</b> <b>Mr.</b> Pewterschmidt comes into the room and they both start talking about how their voices sound alike; this is a reference to the show's creator Seth MacFarlane as he voices both characters.|$|E

The Snow Queen knows that Gold wants to leave Storybrooke with Belle and to be free of the Dagger of Kris, while the Snow Queen wants Storybrooke all to herself, and she says that she has the secret to the missing ingredient he needs. She then asks for the ribbons, and as he gives them to her, the Snow Queen whispers the secret into his ear. <b>Then,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Gold says that he will obtain the final ingredient with great pleasure, causing the Snow Queen to stare at him with a shocked expression.|$|E
25|$|In the fall, the Ingalls quickly {{prepare for}} a move to town for the winter. Laura and Carrie attend school in town and Laura is reunited with her friends Minnie Johnson and Mary Power and meets a new girl, Ida Brown. There is a new schoolteacher for the winter term: Eliza Jane Wilder, Almanzo’s sister. Nellie Oleson, Laura's nemesis from Plum Creek, has moved to De Smet and is {{attending}} the school. Nellie turns the teacher against Laura and Miss Wilder loses control of the school for a time. A visit by the school board restores order; however, Miss Wilder leaves {{at the end of}} the fall term, and is eventually replaced by Mr. Clewett and <b>then</b> <b>Mr.</b> Owen, the latter of whom befriends Laura. Through the course of the winter, Laura sets herself to studying, as she only has one year left before she can apply for a teaching certificate.|$|E

25|$|The {{requirement}} for reliance {{has not been}} pushed {{so far as to}} say that a misrepresentor is never liable when a misrepresentee could have found out the truth. In the leading case, Redgrave v Hurd Mr Hurd was told by the elderly Mr Redgrave that the solicitor practice earned £300 pa. Mr Redgrave told Mr Hurd he could check some documents in the office to prove it. Mr Hurd did not check, and subsequently signed a contract to join Mr Redgrave as a partner. <b>Then</b> <b>Mr</b> Hurd found out the practice only generated £200 pa, and the documents in the office had never said otherwise. Lord Jessel MR held that the contract could be rescinded for misrepresentation, because Mr Redgrave had still made a misrepresentation. Furthmore it would be inferred that Mr Hurd relied on the statement from the fact that it was untrue. Edgington v Fitzmaurice confirmed further that a misrepresentation need not be the sole cause of entering a contract, for a remedy to be available, so long as it is an influence.|$|E

But 'tis well known who were the principal men that began and promoted that design, both in this city and in Oxford; and that a long while before Mr Oldenburg came into England. And not only these Philosophic Meetings were before Mr Oldenburg came from Paris; but the Society itself was begun before he came hither; and those who then knew Mr Oldenburg, understood well enough how little he himself knew of philosophic matter.|$|E
500|$|President Johnson issued no {{statement}} upon {{the death of}} his enemy. Newspaper reaction was generally along partisan lines, though sometimes mixed.

500|$|Contrecœur {{prepared}} {{an official}} {{report of the}} action {{that was based on}} two sources.

[...] The English gave them two volleys, but the Indians did not fire. [...] Mr. de Jumonville, by his interpreter, told them to desist, that he had something to tell them.

Monceau saw all our Frenchmen coming up close to Mr. de Jumonville, whilst they were reading the Summons ... during which Time, said Monceau made the best of his Way to us". [...] Contrecœur's second source was an Indian from Tanacharison's camp, who reported that [...] "Mr. de Jumonville was killed by a Musket-Shot in the Head, whilst they were reading the Summons". The same Indian claimed that the Indians then rushed in to prevent the British from slaughtering the Frenchmen.|$|E

He told Cameron he had been a Eurosceptic for a quarter-century, and thought his readers were too. This was shortly after Cameron renegotiated Britain's membership of the EU on the day on which they were formally announced. The paper's headline that day anticipating the day's announcement, was [...] "Is that it <b>then,</b> <b>Mr</b> Cameron?"

2500|$|The {{institution}} of marriage enjoys a privileged position in the Constitution. A family exclusively based on marriage is envisaged: Article 41.3.1° states that [...] "he State pledges itself to guard with special care the {{institution of}} Marriage, on which the Family is founded". The effect is that non-marital unit members are not entitled {{to any of the}} encompassed protections, including those under the realms of tax, inheritance, and social welfare, granted by Article 41. For example, in State (Nicolaou) v. An Bord Uchtála [...] IR 567, where an unmarried father, who had become estranged from the mother of his child some months after living and caring for the same child together, was prevented from invoking the provisions of Article 41 to halt the mother's wishes of putting the child up for adoption.

And there in the {{presence}} of Mr. Rochester, comptroller of the queen's household, Sir Richard Southwell, both the sheriffs, and a great number of people, he was burnt to ashes, washing his hands in the flame as he was burning. A little before his burning, his pardon was brought, if he would have recanted; but he utterly refused it. He was the first martyr of all the blessed company that suffered in Queen Mary's time that gave the first adventure upon the fire. His wife and children, being eleven in number, ten able to go, and one sucking at her breast, met him by the way, as he went towards Smithfield. This sorrowful sight of his own flesh and blood could nothing move him, but that he constantly and cheerfully took his death with wonderful patience, in the defence and quarrel of the Gospel of Christ." ...|$|E

Emma visits the jail to talk to Will Scarlet and shows him the book he was found next to. He tries to say it has no meaning to him. Emma looks at his eye and asks what happened. Will sees Hook arrive and claims that he does not remember what happened to his eye. When Emma asks him about his hook being back, Hook states that Mr. Gold's magic wasn't what he had hoped it would be. David, going through documents with Elsa, tells Emma that the Snow Queen's alias, Sarah Fisher, is nowhere in any Storybrooke records stating that she did not arrive at the town via the curse.

2500|$|Paul Ebersol (as Mr. Fix) {{appears in}} , voiced by Donny Lucas. He {{is a genius}} {{inventor}} and a high-tech arms dealer with ties to the Maggia. For protection, he employs highly sophisticated communications and surveillance equipment, teams of soldiers, and individuals equipped with high-tech weapons. In the episode “Whiplash”, Mr. Fix orders Whiplash to kill Pepper Potts’ FBI agent father (who is close to apprehending him); <b>then,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Fix sends Whiplash after Pepper herself. Whiplash fails at both tasks; ultimately, Iron Man defeats him. In the episode “Man and Iron Man”, Mr. Fix sends an enhanced Whiplash to get revenge against Iron Man. He is nearly killed when his lab is destroyed. In the episode [...] "Don’t Worry, Be Happy", Iron Man suggests that Mr. Fix is trying to eliminate Unicorn and Killer Shrike upon learning that Mr. Fix hired them to perform a robbery, but, unbeknownst to them, equipped them with explosives powerful enough to destroy the entire city. Mr. Fix later returns in the second season under the employ of a shadowy figure and has Whiplash kidnap Obadiah Stane and Justin Hammer (who had orchestrated his own kidnapping). After escaping from Iron Man, Mr. Fix learns that his mysterious benefactor was Hammer. Hammer's assistant Sasha then implants a nano-virus into Mr. Fix which Hammer would activate if Mr. Fix threatens him or leaves his services. In the episode [...] "Look Into the Light" [...] Mr. Fix gives Justin Hammer a disk with the information needed to complete Project Titanium. In the episode [...] "Titanium vs. Iron", Mr. Fix completes the Titanium Man armor yet Hammer wants to test drive it. Growing impatient that Mr. Fix had not yet {{found a way to}} properly bond titanium to vibranium following his first outing as Titanium Man, Hammer activates the nano-virus killing his physical body. However, Hammer removed a flash drive with Mr. Fix's consciousness on it from him and places it into a nearby console. Hammer tells Mr. Fix that his consciousness has evolved at the cost of his body and that now he can work on Hammer's other projects 24/7. In the episode [...] "The Hawk and the Spider", Hammer speaks with Mr. Fix 2.0 about the Titanium Man armor. Hammer tells Mr. Fix 2.0 {{to find a way to}} make it work or he will destroy him. In the episode [...] "Hostile Takeover", Mr. Fix 2.0 works on the 'dissection' of Iron Man (whose armor was under lock-down to save enough power upon being knocked down by Titanium Man) even when the Iron Man armor is accidentally recharged during Killer Shrike and Unicorn's fight. When Hammer receives a shock trying to remove the Iron Man helmet, Mr. Fix 2.0 tells Hammer that War Machine is approaching Hammer Multinational. In the episode [...] "The Hammer Falls", Mr. Fix 2.0 creates the Zombie Gas which Hammer tests on Count Nefaria. When Mr. Fix 2.0 is unable to trace the call of an individual who recently started blackmailing Hammer, Hammer threatens him. It is revealed that Mr. Fix 2.0 was responsible for the blackmail and had helped Iron Man expose Hammer as part of his revenge for what Hammer did to him. After Hammer is dropped from his Titanium Man armor, Mr. Fix 2.0 then traps Hammer in a Zombie Gas chamber which results in Iron Man blasting the console Mr. Fix 2.0 is in causing Mr. Fix 2.0 to disintegrate.|$|E
