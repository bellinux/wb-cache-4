500|$|The {{husband and}} wife team of Amole Gupte and Deepa Bhatia {{developed}} the story that would eventually become Taare Zameen Par {{as a way of}} understanding why some children cannot conform to a conventional educational system. Their initial work began as a short story that evolved into a screenplay over seven years. Deepa Bhatia later stated in an interview with The Hindu that her original inspiration was not dyslexia but rather the childhood of Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa, who performed poorly in school. Her goal was thus to explore the story of [...] "a child who did not fit into the school stream." [...] She referenced a specific moment in Kurosawa's biography where he began to excel after meeting an attentive art teacher, and noted that this scene [...] "became the inspiration for how a <b>teacher</b> <b>could</b> transform the life of a student".|$|E
500|$|As to why Proba {{arranged}} {{in the poem}} in the first place, scholars are still divided. The Latinist R. P. H. Green argues that the work was {{a reaction to the}} Roman emperor Julian's law forbidding Christians from teaching classical Greek and Latin mythological literature which they did not believe to be true. Proba's goal, Green writes, was to present Virgil [...] "without [...] gods, and [...] a [...] no longer vulnerable to Christian criticism". In this way, a Christian <b>teacher</b> <b>could</b> use the text to discuss Virgil without compromising their moral integrity. A somewhat related hypothesis, proposed by the classicist Aurelio Amatucci, suggests that Proba composed the cento to teach her children stories from the Bible. However, there is no direct evidence that the poem was a teaching tool. Clark and Hatch postulate that Jesus's Virgilian nature in the cento may have been Proba's attempt to rebut the unflattering, demonizing descriptions of Jesus in Julian's Caesares and Contra Galilaeos. They conclude that the hypothesis is intriguing but unverifiable {{due to the lack of}} information about Proba, the date of the cento's creation, and her intentions.|$|E
2500|$|The typical {{structure}} of a chapter employing the Audio-Lingual-Method (ALM—and {{there was even a}} text book entitled ALM [...] ) was usually standardized as follows: 1. First item was a dialog in the foreign language (FL) to be memorized by the student. The teacher would go over it the day before. 2. There were then questions in the FL about the dialog to be answered by the student(s) in the target language. 3. Often a brief introduction to the grammar of the chapter was next, including the verb(s) and conjugations. 4. The mainstay of the chapter was [...] "pattern practice," [...] which were drills expecting [...] "automatic" [...] responses from the student(s) as a noun, verb conjugation, or agreeing adjective was to be inserted in the blank in the text (or during the teacher's pause). The <b>teacher</b> <b>could</b> have the student use the book or not use it, relative to how homework was assigned. Depending on time, the class could respond as a chorus, or the <b>teacher</b> <b>could</b> pick individuals to respond. Julian Dakin, in 'The Language Laboratory and Language Learning' (Longman 1973), coined the phrase 'meaningless drills' to describe this kind of pattern practice, which others have also described as [...] "mimicry-memorization." [...] 5. There was a vocabulary list, sometimes with translations to the mother tongue. [...] 6. The chapter usually ended with a short reading exercise.|$|E

60|$|Letters {{then came}} {{regularly}}, month by month, and were always regularly answered,--till a chance reader {{would have thought}} that no father and no son stood on better terms with each other. There had been misfortunes; but the misfortunes did not seem to touch John Caldigate himself. After three months of hard work and steady conduct Mick Maggott had broken out and had again taken to drinking champagne out of buckets. Efforts were made, with infinite trouble, to reclaim him, which would be successful for a time,--and then again he would slip away into the mud. And then Shand would sometimes go into the mud with him; and Shand, when drunk, would be more unmanageable even than Mick. And this went on till Mick had--killed himself, and Dick Shand had disappeared. 'I grieve for the man as for a dear friend,' he said in one of his father's letters; 'for he has been as true to me as steel in all things, save drink; and I feel that I have learned under him the practical work of a gold-miner as it cannot be learned except by the unwearied attention of the <b>teacher.</b> <b>Could</b> he have kept from spirits, this man would have made a large fortune and would have deserved it; for he was indefatigable and never-ending in resources.'

6000|$|L. My dear, do {{you think}} any <b>teacher</b> <b>could</b> be worth your {{listening}} to, or anybody else's listening to, who had learned nothing, and altered his mind in nothing, from seven and twenty to seven and forty? But that second volume is very good for you {{as far as it}} goes. It is a great advance, and a thoroughly straight and swift one, to be led, as it is the main business of that second volume to lead you, from Dutch cattle pieces, and ruffian-pieces, to Fra Angelico. And it is right for you also, as you grow older, to be strengthened in the general sense and judgment which may enable you to distinguish the weaknesses from the virtues of what you love: else you might come to love both alike; or even the weaknesses without the virtues. You might end by liking Overbeck and Cornelius as well as Angelico. However, I have perhaps been leaning a little too much to the merely practical side of things, in to-night's talk; and you are always to remember, children, that I do not deny, though I cannot affirm, the spiritual advantages resulting, in certain cases, from enthusiastic religious reverie, and from the other practices of saints and anchorites. The evidence respecting them has never yet been honestly collected, much less dispassionately examined: but assuredly, there is in that direction a probability, and more than a probability, of dangerous error, while there is none whatever in the practice of an active, cheerful, and benevolent life. The hope of attaining a higher religious position, which induces us to encounter, for its exalted alternative, the risk of unhealthy error, is often, as I said, founded more on pride than piety; and those who, in modest usefulness, have accepted what seemed to them here the lowliest place in the kingdom of their Father, are not, I believe, the least likely to receive hereafter the command, then unmistakable, 'Friend, go up higher.' ...|$|E
60|$|They began, as {{they are}} apt to do, with lessons in a private house, where a lady taught several other children, and where he {{possibly}} learned to read; though he could only remember being set on a platform in punishment for some forgotten offence. After {{that he went to}} school {{in the basement of a}} church, where a number of boys and girls were taught by a master who knew how to endear study at least to my boy. There was a garden outside of the schoolroom; hollyhocks grew in it, and the boys gathered the little cheeses, as they called the seed-buttons which form when the flowers drop off, and ate them, because boys will eat anything, and not because they liked them. With the fact of this garden is mixed a sense of drowsy heat and summer light, and that is all, except the blackboard at the end of the room and a big girl doing sums at it; and the wonder why the teacher smiled when he read in one of the girls' compositions a phrase about forging puddings and pies; my boy did not know what forging meant, so he must have been very young. But he had a zeal for learning, and somehow he took a prize in geography--a science in which he was never afterwards remarkable. The prize was a little history of Lexington, Mass., which the teacher gave him, perhaps because Lexington may have been his native town; but the history must have been very dryly told, for not a fact of it remained in the boy's mind. He was vaguely disappointed in the book, but he valued it for the teacher's sake whom he was secretly very fond of, and who had no doubt won the child's heart by some flattering notice. He thought it a great happiness to follow him, when the teacher gave up this school, and took charge of one of the public schools; but it was not the same there; the <b>teacher</b> <b>could</b> not distinguish him in that multitude of boys and girls. He did himself a little honor in spelling, but he won no praise, and he disgraced himself then as always in arithmetic. He sank into the common herd of mediocrities; and then, when his family went to live in another part of the town, he began to go to another school. He had felt that the teacher belonged to him, and it must have been a pang to find him so estranged. But he was a kind man, and long afterwards he had a friendly smile and word for the boy when they met; and then all at once he ceased to be, as men and things do in a boy's world.|$|E
