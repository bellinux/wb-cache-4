5|$|An {{unofficial}} fan translation patch {{was announced}} in mid-2012. Work on the fan translation took place over the following two years, during which time Square Enix was noncommittal concerning an official Western release. <b>The</b> <b>patch</b> was initially announced for an August 2014 release, but was instead was released on June 9, 2014. According to the translation team leader, <b>the</b> <b>patch</b> was downloaded 100,000 times {{in the first four}} days. It was taken down in July of the same year after Square Enix allegedly threatened unspecified legal action, originally thought to be a cease-and-desist order. Later statements revealed that <b>the</b> <b>patch</b> was released earlier than originally announced due to the lead translator on the project wanting fans to see their achievements, which ended up causing a rift between him {{and the rest of the}} team. Before the release, Square Enix and the translation team had been in friendly communication concerning the translation. The formal requests to take <b>the</b> <b>patch</b> down were made in the weeks following its release, shortly before the announcement of Type-0 HD. Work on <b>the</b> <b>patch</b> was eventually resumed and a second version, which included unofficial compatibility with the PlayStation 3 system and further translation bugfixes, was eventually released in 2015.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, {{a common}} patch was {{released}} {{for both the}} Xbox and Windows version. <b>The</b> <b>patch</b> included additional content such as new Plasmids, new achievements for the Xbox 360 version, and additional graphics settings {{to address some of}} the field-of-view issues identified by players. (See below). <b>The</b> <b>patch</b> also added in an option to disable the use of Vita-Chambers, a feature requested by players to make the game more challenging, as well as an achievement to complete the game at its hardest setting without using a Vita-Chamber.|$|E
5|$|Unlike its two predecessors, Valkyria Chronicles III was not {{released}} in the west. According to Sega, {{this was due to}} poor sales of Valkyria Chronicles II and the general unpopularity of the PSP in the west. An unofficial fan translation patch began development in February 2012: players with a copy of Valkyria Chronicles III could download and apply <b>the</b> <b>patch,</b> which translated the game's text into English. Compatible with the Extra Edition, <b>the</b> <b>patch</b> was released in January 2014.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Polyvinyl alcohol–gelatin patches were {{developed}} and salicylic acid was incorporated {{at different stages}} of preparation of <b>the</b> <b>patches.</b> <b>The</b> <b>patches</b> were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry, tensile strength test, and scanning electron microscopy. The release patterns of the drug from <b>the</b> <b>patches</b> were also studied. The FTIR spectra of <b>the</b> blank <b>patch</b> indicated complete esterification of the free carboxylic groups of gelatin. The XRD studies indicated a crystalline form of the drug entrapped in <b>the</b> <b>patches.</b> Release of <b>the</b> drug from <b>the</b> <b>patches</b> followed Higuchian/Fickian kinetics indicating a diffusion-controlled release process...|$|R
30|$|We {{perceived}} that the relative position of <b>the</b> <b>patches</b> to <b>the</b> whole blob {{can affect the}} similarity measure. Then, we gather in a single set <b>the</b> <b>patches</b> from grids of size N− 1, N and N+ 1. Some of <b>the</b> <b>patches</b> are disregarded as explained below.|$|R
5|$|When the Eisenhower dollar coin was {{released}} in 1971, <b>the</b> <b>patch</b> design provided the eagle for its reverse side. The design was also used for the smaller Susan B. Anthony dollar unveiled in 1979, {{ten years after the}} Apollo 11 mission.|$|E
5|$|A {{hologram}}, used on {{the note}} which appears to see the hologram image change between the value and a window or doorway, but in the background, {{it appears to be}} rainbow-coloured concentric circles of micro-letters moving from the centre to the edges of <b>the</b> <b>patch.</b>|$|E
5|$|Another project, {{which aims}} to {{overhaul}} the game and improve upon the gameplay and graphics to better resemble the original PlayStation version, was released in 2013 {{by members of the}} Romhacking.net community. <b>The</b> <b>patch,</b> which took four years to develop, first started off as a graphics hack, but has since evolved into an extensive revamp.|$|E
50|$|This {{causes a}} lot of work for the project maintainers who have to merge all <b>the</b> <b>patches.</b> <b>The</b> process may be split up with people who inspect, approve and merge <b>the</b> <b>patches.</b>|$|R
50|$|Similar {{species in}} <b>the</b> bordered <b>patch's</b> range include <b>the</b> crimson <b>patch</b> (Chlosyne janais), <b>the</b> rosita <b>patch</b> (Chlosyne rosita), and <b>the</b> red-spotted <b>patch</b> (Chlosyne marina).|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>patching</b> {{thickness}} and <b>patching</b> zone affect <b>the</b> load–lateral deflection behaviour of patched RC columns {{where the}} behaviour could {{be related to}} the stress distribution across <b>the</b> <b>patched</b> sections.|$|R
5|$|In 2008, an {{unofficial}} patch was released to keep C working on both 32 and 64 bit versions of Windows XP and higher. <b>The</b> <b>patch</b> fixes several bugs in the game, and adds upgrades like higher resolution {{and support for}} language packs.|$|E
5|$|Issho ni A-SO-BO also {{contained}} several serious errors. Petit Ferret addressed {{these issues in}} two patches. The first patch added missing voice data from the original game CD; customers were given the option of downloading <b>the</b> <b>patch</b> or exchanging for a new CD. Ferret released the second patch on July 7, 2003; it corrected grammatical errors, adjusted the game's difficulty, and enhanced stability. The second patch did not contain the first's fixes.|$|E
5|$|The first patch for the Xbox 360 {{version was}} {{released}} {{about two weeks}} after release to fix some of the game stability issues players had reported <b>The</b> <b>patch</b> was found to introduce more problems to the game for some users, including occasional freezes, bad framerates, and audio-related issues, though methods to resolve these issues through the console's cache system were outlined by Irrational Games.|$|E
40|$|Rhizoctonia-like fungi were {{isolated}} from the roots of discased wheat and barley plants sampled from the centre and periphery of bare patches and from apparently healthy plants from outside of <b>the</b> <b>patches.</b> Of <b>the</b> isolates recovered. 89 % were multinucleate and belonged to R. solani anastomosis groups: AG- 8, AG- 2 - 2 and AG- 4. The remaining isolates were binucleate Rhizoctonia spp. The multinucleate isolates of R. solani were all pathogenic. All the binucleate isolates were non-pathogenic. The AG- 8 isolates of R. solani were obtained morę frequently from the plants within <b>the</b> <b>patches</b> than outside <b>the</b> <b>patches.</b> <b>The</b> highly virulent isolates of AG- 8 were not found outside <b>the</b> <b>patches.</b> Isolates of anastomosis groups AG- 2 - 2, AG- 4 and saprotrophic isolates of AG- 8 noted less frequently within <b>the</b> <b>patches...</b>|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>patches</b> were {{subjected}} to weight variation test by weighing all <b>the</b> <b>patches</b> on a digital weighing machine. The determinations were carried out in triplicate for each formulation. Average weight and standard deviation values were then calculated.|$|R
5000|$|The {{condition}} is so {{named for the}} fine scaly appearance initially present (pityriasis) and the pallor of <b>the</b> <b>patches</b> that develop (while [...] "alba" [...] is Latin for white, <b>the</b> <b>patches</b> in this condition are not totally depigmented).|$|R
5|$|The {{insignia}} of the Cadet Nurse Corps was the Maltese Cross. <b>The</b> <b>patch</b> {{was worn}} {{on the left}} shoulder of the uniforms and on the student nurse uniform of the official school of nursing. The USPHS official insignia was worn on jacket lapels and was also present on the silver buttons. On the Montgomery beret, the USPHS insignia was worn beneath the spread eagle and the American Shield.|$|E
5|$|Any Penrose tiling has local {{pentagonal}} symmetry, in {{the sense}} that there are points in the tiling surrounded by a symmetric configuration of tiles: such configurations have fivefold rotational symmetry about the center point, as well as five mirror lines of reflection symmetry passing through the point, a dihedral symmetry group. This symmetry will generally preserve only a patch of tiles around the center point, but <b>the</b> <b>patch</b> can be very large: Conway and Penrose proved that whenever the colored curves on the P2 or P3 tilings close in a loop, the region within the loop has pentagonal symmetry, and furthermore, in any tiling, there are at most two such curves of each color that do not close up.|$|E
5|$|During the Shaman Fight, Yoh {{encounters}} Hao Asakura, {{a strong}} shaman {{who wishes to}} eradicate humans and create a world for shamans. At {{the end of the}} shaman battles, the remaining teams consist of Yoh and his friends, the X-Laws and Hao's team. The remaining teams choose to forfeit the tournament, crowning Hao with the title of Shaman King. As Hao is led away, Yoh and his allies decide to attack Hao while he is merging with the Great Spirit, which is in a coma. To conquer Hao, Yoh and his friends must defeat <b>The</b> <b>Patch</b> Tribe members who are obligated to serve under the new Shaman King.|$|E
30|$|The {{solution}} involving <b>the</b> nine <b>patches</b> is <b>the</b> {{closest to}} the reference solution. However, because at the border of <b>the</b> <b>patches</b> <b>the</b> usual plate kinematics is enforced, {{a gap between the}} nine-patches solution and the refined 3 D FEM solution (reference solution) persists. In any case, as <b>the</b> <b>patches</b> solution involved less constraints (plate kinematics) than the one related to enriched elements where the kinematic constrains are applied to all the elements boundaries, its accuracy is superior.|$|R
40|$|Rhizoctonia‐like fungi were {{isolated}} from the roots of diseased wheat plants sampled from the centre and periphery of three bare patches, and from apparently healthy plants from outside <b>the</b> <b>patches.</b> Of <b>the</b> isolates recovered, 81 % were multinucleate and belonged to R. solani anastomosis group 8, and pectic zymogram group 1 ‐ 1; the remaining isolates were binucleate Rhizoctonia spp. The multinucleate isolates could be grouped into highly virulent, intermediately virulent, and weakly virulent types. The binucleate isolates were all non‐pathogenic. The multinucleate isolates were obtained at a significantly higher frequency from plants within <b>the</b> <b>patches</b> compared with outside <b>the</b> <b>patches,</b> and with <b>the</b> exception of a single isolate, the highly virulent isolates were not found outside <b>the</b> <b>patches.</b> <b>The</b> weakly virulent isolates were present at much lower frequencies than the highly virulent and intermediately virulent forms within <b>the</b> <b>patches.</b> <b>The</b> frequency of occurrence of binucleate isolates did not vary significantly among the locations sampled. None of the multinucleate isolates contained plasmids. Some of the isolates contained a prominent single dsRNA species and one or more minor dsRNA species. The distribution of these dsRNAs was not correlated with pathogenicity...|$|R
30|$|Plants in <b>the</b> open <b>patch</b> {{produced}} significantly larger floral displays {{than those}} in <b>the</b> forested <b>patch</b> in both populations. Floral display size had {{a positive effect on}} pollinator visitation rate per flower in one population, but no effect in the other. Plants in <b>the</b> open <b>patch</b> received approximately 8 – 11 times more visitation rates and produced significantly more fruit and seeds per flower {{than those in}} <b>the</b> forested <b>patch.</b> However, supplemental pollination resulted in significantly more fruit and seed production per flower compared to natural pollination in <b>the</b> forested <b>patch</b> but not in <b>the</b> open <b>patch</b> in one population, and did not enhance fruit and seed production in either the forested or <b>the</b> open <b>patch</b> in <b>the</b> other. In both populations, supplementally pollinated plants in <b>the</b> open <b>patch</b> produced significantly more fruit and seeds per flower than supplementally pollinated plants in <b>the</b> forested <b>patch.</b>|$|R
5|$|Impala feed on {{soft and}} nutritious grasses such as Digitaria macroblephara; tough, tall grasses, such as Heteropogon contortus and Themeda triandra, are {{typically}} avoided. Impala {{on the periphery}} of the herds are generally more vigilant against predators than those feeding in the centre; a foraging individual will try to defend <b>the</b> <b>patch</b> it is feeding on by lowering its head. A study revealed that time spent in foraging reaches a maximum of 75.5% of the day in the late dry season, decreases through the rainy season, and is minimal in the early dry season (57.8%).|$|E
5|$|In January 2015, DeWitt {{announced}} plans for the Cardinals to renovate a baseball field in Sosúa in Taveras's honor, modeled after the Cardinals Care facilities in Greater St. Louis. The team would also wear black circular patches inscribed with OT (Taveras's initials) inside a white circle on their jerseys. <b>The</b> <b>patch</b> will omit Taveras's No. 18 because Martínez is already wearing it as his uniform number as a tribute. A large decal in his memorial was posted in the home team bullpen of Busch Stadium along with the ones of Hancock and former pitcher Darryl Kile, who died of coronary artery disease during the 2002 season while still active.|$|E
5|$|Recorded in an abbey {{shortly after}} Patch's death, the song {{consists}} of Thom Yorke's vocals {{and a string}} arrangement composed by Jonny Greenwood, absent of Radiohead's typical mix of rock and electronic instrumentation. The lyrics are {{from the perspective of}} a soldier in the First World War, and include modifications of quotations from Patch. While reception to the song was generally positive, with many critics praising the song's message, others criticised it as too sombre. <b>The</b> <b>Patch</b> family voiced their approval of the song's message and the band's charitable use of the proceeds.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>patches</b> {{created and}} applied by Kompare are {{compatible}} with patch files generated or applied by the command line interface diff utility, because Kompare is in fact merely a graphical front end to diff and <b>the</b> <b>patches</b> are created and applied by patch, which gets called by Kompare.|$|R
30|$|The {{basic unit}} of {{dictionary}} learning is still patch, but each dictionary is only updated by <b>the</b> <b>patches</b> in <b>the</b> corresponding groups. Different {{from the traditional}} dictionary learning method proposed by Yang et al. [10] that uses a single dictionary {{for the construction of}} all patches, this method also contained the information of all <b>patches</b> in <b>the</b> group in dictionary learning phase, which made the dictionary more suitable for <b>the</b> <b>patches</b> in <b>the</b> corresponding group. Because <b>the</b> <b>patches</b> in <b>the</b> group are similar, the dictionary is relatively more compact than the initial one.|$|R
50|$|After {{receiving}} {{strong support}} to restudy this corridor, MnDOT has re-identified <b>the</b> Dan <b>Patch</b> Corridor as a Tier 1 Project for implementation {{within the next}} 20 years. Current stances of communities along the corridor; Minneapolis supports <b>the</b> Dan <b>Patch</b> Corridor project; St. Louis Park has an official stance against <b>the</b> Dan <b>Patch</b> Corridor project; Edina supports <b>the</b> Dan <b>Patch</b> Corridor project with a guarantee that the community will {{have at least one}} station; Bloomington is neutral towards the project and is willing to work with MnDOT on future passenger rail on <b>the</b> Dan <b>Patch</b> Corridor; Savage supports <b>the</b> Dan <b>Patch</b> Corridor project; Burnsville has no official stance; Lakeville is against any public spending for study and construction of <b>the</b> Dan <b>Patch</b> Corridor and; Northfield supports <b>the</b> Dan <b>Patch</b> Corridor project.|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} project {{received}} the {{cease and desist}} letter, an alpha version of <b>the</b> <b>patch</b> was leaked on the internet. ZeaLitY expressed his disapproval and embarrassment on the Crimson Echoes website, noting that the alpha version was extremely buggy and lacked many of the improvements made in the beta version. In January 2011, a more complete beta version was leaked which could be played from beginning to end, {{believed to be the}} final build of the project prior to cancellation.|$|E
5|$|The dozen {{fans who}} worked on the project had been vetted by Mandelin and had prior {{localization}} experience. Thousands of hours were put into the project between hacking the game data and translating the 1,000 pages of scripted dialogue. They built their own tools for the work. The final version was released in October 2008 and issued as a patch. <b>The</b> <b>patch</b> was downloaded over 100,000 times in its first week. A fan-made, full-color, 200-page, professional-quality player's guide was released alongside the translation. The Verge cited the effort as proof of the fan base's dedication.|$|E
5|$|The {{team was}} less {{successful}} in resolving other issues; programmer Matt Pritchard complained following {{the release of}} Age of Empires that {{there was still no}} process by which patches could be issued. Extensive cheating in multiplayer games of Age of Empires came as a result of several bugs in the game, which resulted in Microsoft promising Ensemble Studios there would be a patch process for The Age of Kings. On release, there were several bugs that needed immediate attention, but <b>the</b> <b>patch</b> process was not yet ready. The first patch was released 11 months later.|$|E
40|$|Alternative {{reproductive}} tactics (ARTs) {{are found}} in several Lake Tanganyika shell-brooding cichlids. Field studies were conducted in the Wonzye population to examine reproductive ecology and ARTs in the Lake Tanganyika shell-brooding cichlid Neolamprologus brevis. We discovered that this fish occurred in both rocky- and sandy-bottom habitats, but in rocky habitats, brood-caring females exclusively occurred in shell-patches that another cichlid species created. All N. brevis of both sexes in <b>the</b> <b>patches</b> were sexually mature, whereas immature males and females with unripe eggs were found frequently in sandy-bottom habitats. Males in sandy-bottom habitats were smaller, but fed more frequently and were in better somatic condition than males in <b>the</b> <b>patches.</b> Similar tendency was found in females. This indicates that N. brevis uses different habitats depending {{on the stage of}} its life history, with migration from sandy-bottom habitats to the shell-patches for reproduction. Males in <b>the</b> <b>patches</b> exhibited different behavior patterns: floating above <b>the</b> <b>patches</b> and lying in <b>the</b> <b>patches.</b> <b>The</b> former was larger, more aggressive, and invested less in gonads (relative to body size) than the latter. These results accord with those of other shell-brooding Lake Tanganyika cichlids with ARTs, and they therefore suggest the presence of ARTs in N. brevis...|$|R
