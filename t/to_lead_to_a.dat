5|$|A {{day after}} the draw against Vitesse, Ronald Koeman {{announced}} he would end his tenure as manager of Feyenoord {{at the end of}} the 2013–14 season. On 4 February the team beat Roda JC away 2–1. Immers and Armenteros scored to take a two-goal lead at half time, Roda got on the board near the end of the game. The win moved Feyenoord to two points behind Vitesse. The following Saturday Feyenoord played N.E.C. at home. The visitors took an early lead, before Immers and Pellè gave Feyenoord a one-goal advantage at half time. An additional goal by Pellè and two scores from Boëtius led to a 5–1 win that led Feyenoord to third place in the league table. On 16 February the club played away at NAC Breda. The game ended in a 1–1 draw; Janmaat scored the lone Feyenoord goal in the first half before NAC equalized from a penalty kick. Feyenoord played their last February match on the 23rd away against FC Twente. They created a two-goal lead halfway in the second half from goals by Pellè and Boëtius before Twente scored twice <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 2–2 draw. The last goal came after 5 minutes of stoppage time and was controversial as it was even considered to be offside by Twente player Castaignos. The club ended February fourth in the league table.|$|E

5|$|A state {{wishing to}} devalue, {{or at least}} check the {{appreciation}} of its currency, must work within {{the constraints of the}} prevailing International monetary system. During the 1930s, countries had relatively more direct control over their exchange rates through the actions of their central banks. Following the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in the early 1970s, markets substantially increased in influence, with market forces largely setting the exchange rates for an increasing number of countries. However, a state's central bank can still intervene in the markets to effect a devaluation – if it sells its own currency to buy other currencies then this will cause the value of its own currency to fall – a practice common with states that have a managed exchange rate regime. Less directly, quantitative easing (common in 2009 and 2010), tends <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fall {{in the value of the}} currency even if the central bank does not directly buy any foreign assets.|$|E
5|$|Banksia prionotes is {{susceptible}} {{to a number of}} threatening processes. It is highly {{susceptible to}} Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback; wild populations are harvested commercially by the cut flower industry; and some of its range is subject to land clearing for urban or agricultural purposes. An assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that severe change is likely <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> reduction in its range of around 50% by 2080; and even mild change is projected to cause a reduction of 30%; but under mid-severity scenarios the distribution may actually grow, depending on how effectively it can migrate into newly habitable areas. However, this study does not address the potential of climate change to alter fire regimes; these have already been impacted by the arrival of humans, and this change is thought to have led to a decline in the abundance and range of B.prionotes.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} at Genesis was a Six Man Tag Team match pitting {{the team of}} Rhino and Team 3D (Brother Ray & Brother Devon) against the team of Jeff Jarrett and America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris & James Storm; AMW). This match was {{promoted}} for Genesis by TNA on their official website, and later announced on the October29 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!. The storyline behind this match began the October1 episode of Impact!, when Team 3D made their TNA debut. On the October8 episode of Impact!, AMW and Jarrett assaulted Team 3D to the point they were left covered in blood. Afterwards, Team 3D were not seen due to a scripted injury, with Jarrett, AMW, and Team Canada (A-1, Bobby Roode, Eric Young, Petey Williams, and Coach Scott D'Amore) hosting a segment where they buried Team 3D's careers on the October15 episode of Impact!. Meanwhile, then-NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jarrett {{was involved in a}} feud with Kevin Nash which was <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> title defense at TNA's Bound for Glory PPV event on October23. However, Nash {{was rushed to the hospital}} the night before and was not cleared to wrestle. Rhino took Nash's place in the match, where he defeated Jarrett to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. The same night Team 3D made their return from their scripted injury, coming to the aid of Rhino after the main event. Later, Jarrett reclaimed the title on the November3 episode of Impact!.|$|E

30|$|Discussion On {{the basis}} of our quiz, we could suspect that a rather unimpressive image, {{characterized}} by few emotional words, risks <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> excess of optimism, while a very impressive image, characterized by numerous emotional words, risks <b>to</b> <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> excess of pessimism, which could <b>lead</b> <b>to</b> inadequate WWLST decisions. Our quiz overlines that the doctors are conscious of this risk and that to protect them against this risk, their WWLST decisions are based mostly on clinical examination, are helped by radiologists and experts and are always collective. In fact, real decisions for these patients weren’t influenced by the impressive character of the image, as the patients with the most impressive image are alive, and the patient with the less impressive one is dead after a WWLST decision.|$|R
