5000|$|Some {{critics have}} {{questioned}} the circumstances surrounding <b>the</b> <b>bullet's</b> discovery at Parkland Hospital. In a 1966 interview with author Josiah Thompson, {{one of the men}} who found <b>the</b> <b>bullet,</b> Parkland personnel director O.P. Wright, cast doubt on whether <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> subsequently entered into evidence as CE 399 was <b>the</b> same <b>bullet</b> he held in his hand that day.

5|$|Howard {{has played}} six-and-a-half seasons (1994–2001) for <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> {{franchise}} (renamed the Wizards in 1997), three full seasons (2004–07) for the Houston Rockets, two plus seasons for the Heat and shorter stints for several other teams. During his rookie year with <b>the</b> <b>Bullets,</b> {{he became the}} first player to graduate on time with his class after leaving college early to play in the NBA. After one season as an All-Rookie player and a second as an All-Star and an All-NBA performer, {{he became the first}} NBA player to sign a $100million contract. While he continued to be a productive starter, he was never again selected to play in an All-Star Game. Towards the end of his contract, he was traded at the NBA trade deadline twice to make salary cap room. He was most recently a regular starter during the 2005–06 NBA season. In 2010, he signed with the Heat and entered his 17th NBA season, during which he reached the playoffs for the sixth time and made his first career NBA Finals appearance. He remained with the Heat the following season and won his first NBA championship during the 2012 NBA Finals. He returned to the Heat for part of the following season, and won a second championship. Howard has developed a reputation as a humanitarian for his civic commitment.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} 1964–65 NBA season, West averaged 31.0points (at the time, a career-high), only surpassed by perennial scoring champion Wilt Chamberlain. After ending {{the regular season}} with 49 wins, L.A. played the Baltimore Bullets {{in the first round}} of the 1965 NBA Playoffs, but then team captain Baylor suffered a career-threatening knee injury. West spectacularly took over Baylor's leader role, as he scored 49points and willed the shocked Lakers to the win. In Game 2, Baltimore was unable to stop the Lakers guard, who scored 52points, nearly half of L.A.'stotal, in the 118–115 win. <b>The</b> <b>Bullets</b> took their two home games, despite West scoring 44 and 48points respectively, but in the decisive Game 5 in L.A., the guard helped beat <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> with 42points in a close 117–115 win. West averaged 46.3points per game, a figure that is still an NBA record. However, in the 1965 NBA Finals, the Celtics easily beat the short-handed Lakers, 4–1. In Game 1, which Boston easily won, defensive Celtics guard K. C. Jones kept West to only 26points, and in Game 2, West scored 45points, but Boston still won 129–123. In Game 3, West scored 49points, and L.A. finally won a game, but in Games 4 and 5, the Lakers were beaten by double digits; in the last quarter of Game 5, West missed 14 of 15 shots and could not prevent yet another Celtics win. Still, the Lakers guard finished the playoffs with 40.6points per game.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Bullets</b> won {{the league}} {{championship}} in 1960–61, after which Spivey played two seasons {{in a different}} American Basketball League, with the Los Angeles Jets and Long Beach–Hawaii Chiefs. Spivey {{was named to the}} 1961–62 All-ABL Second Team after averaging 22.7points per game and 11.2rebounds per game with the Chiefs; his total of 1,773points was second behind Connie Hawkins. In the 1962–63 season, which was shortened when the league suspended operations, he had an average of 22.5points per game in 24 games with Long Beach. In ABL history, Spivey was third in points scored and fourth in rebounds.|$|E

5|$|Blood {{and urine}} samples {{indicated}} {{that she had}} taken the anti-psychotic drug haloperidol, and several days earlier had used cannabis. There were no marks on her body suggestive of a struggle. The firearms officer who first saw her said her feet and hands were clean, her fingernails manicured and not broken, and her fingertips free of blood, dirt or powder. There was no trace of lead dust. The rifle magazine would have been loaded at least twice during the killings; this would usually leave lubricant and material from <b>the</b> <b>bullets</b> on the hands. A scenes-of-crimes officer, DC Hammersley, said there were bloodstains {{on the back of}} her right hand, but that otherwise her hands were clean.|$|E

Fung is finally the last surviving member, so he attempts to walk nonchalantly by Costello, relying on the Frenchman's inability to recognize him without the coat, but as he is walking by, Costello sees a sticker on Fung's tie. Both men shoot at each other. Fung is hit and Costello demands that he put the coat on, which Fung refuses, so Costello shoots him in the leg. Fung puts the coat on, Costello checks the bullet holes in the coat and sees that they align with <b>the</b> <b>bullets</b> stuck in the bullet-proof vest he was wearing. Costello then stands up and fires a round into Fung's head killing him. Costello is last seen eating and laughing with the woman and children.|$|E

The intention was to prove the hypothesis that syphilis had caused insanity in him, but nothing resulted from the analysis; no evidence of syphilis was found on his body either. No autopsy was carried out on Petacci. In 2009, Mussolini's granddaughter Alessandra Mussolini demanded a police investigation into claims that samples of his blood and brain had been reportedly offered for sale on eBay.|$|E
50|$|Overall, {{the effect}} of the Magnus force on a bullet's flight path itself is usually {{insignificant}} compared to other forces such as aerodynamic drag. However, it greatly affects <b>the</b> <b>bullet's</b> stability, which in turn affects the amount of drag, how <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> behaves upon impact, and many other factors. The stability of <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> is affected because the Magnus effect acts on <b>the</b> <b>bullet's</b> centre of pressure instead of its centre of gravity. This means that it affects the yaw angle of the bullet: it tends to twist <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> along its flight path, either towards the axis of flight (decreasing the yaw thus stabilising <b>the</b> <b>bullet)</b> or away from the axis of flight (increasing the yaw thus destabilising <b>the</b> <b>bullet).</b> <b>The</b> critical factor is the location of the centre of pressure, which depends on the flowfield structure, which in turn depends mainly on <b>the</b> <b>bullet's</b> speed (supersonic or subsonic), but also the shape, air density and surface features. If the centre of pressure is ahead of the centre of gravity, the effect is destabilizing; if the centre of pressure is behind the centre of gravity, the effect is stabilising.|$|R
50|$|The {{ratio of}} the kinetic {{energies}} {{is the same as}} the {{ratio of the}} masses (and is independent of velocity). Since the mass of <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> is much less than that of the shooter there is more kinetic energy transferred to <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> than to <b>the</b> shooter. Once discharged from <b>the</b> weapon, <b>the</b> <b>bullet's</b> energy decays throughout its flight, until the remainder is dissipated by colliding with a target (e.g. deforming <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> and target).|$|R
5000|$|When a hand gun bullet strikes body armor, it {{is caught}} in a [...] "web" [...] of {{extremely}} strong fibers. These fibers absorb and disperse the impact energy that is transmitted to <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> proof vest from <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> causing <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> to deform, otherwise known as a [...] "mushroom". Additional energy is absorbed by each successive layer or material in bullet proof vests {{until such time as}} <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> has been stopped.|$|R
5|$|The 1966 NBA Expansion Draft was {{the second}} {{expansion}} draft of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The draft was held from April 30 to May 1, 1966, so that the newly founded Chicago Bulls could acquire players for the upcoming 1966–67 season. Chicago had been awarded the expansion team on January 16, 1966. The Bulls were the third NBA franchise to play in Chicago, following the Chicago Stags, which folded in 1950, and the Chicago Packers–Zephyrs, which moved to Baltimore and became the Baltimore Bullets in 1963. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> relocated to Washington in 1973 as the Capital Bullets, then became the Washington Bullets a year later, before becoming the Washington Wizards in 1997.|$|E
5|$|The Washington Wizards are an American {{professional}} basketball team based in Washington, D.C. They are {{a member of}} the Southeast Division of the Eastern Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team plays its home games at the Capital One Arena. The franchise was established in Chicago, Illinois as the Chicago Packers in 1961; after one season, its name was changed to the Chicago Zephyrs. In 1963, the franchise moved to Baltimore, Maryland and was renamed the Baltimore Bullets. It moved to Landover, Maryland in 1973 and changed its name to the Capital Bullets. After one season, the team became the Washington Bullets. In 1978, <b>the</b> <b>Bullets</b> won the 1978 NBA Finals in seven games for the franchise's only championship. In 1997, the team became the Washington Wizards, which is the team's current name. Since their formation, the Wizards have won sixdivisional championships, fourconference championships, oneleague championship and have appeared in the playoffs twenty-threetimes.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} 1957–58 season, Spivey spent 10 of his {{remaining}} 12 professional {{seasons in the}} EBL. The first two of those EBL seasons were spent with the Wilkes-Barre Barons, and Spivey led the team to consecutive league championships. On April 20, 1958, he scored 62points in the title-clinching game against the Easton Madisons, setting an EBL playoff record. In 1958–59, {{he became the first}} player in league history with a 1,000-point season, and had 64points in a March 1959 game. Along with his play in the EBL, Spivey reached an agreement to join the Ansonia Norwoods of the semi-professional Connecticut Basketball Association (CBA) in 1958. Over two years with the Norwoods, his points-per-game average exceeded 30.0. Spivey moved to the Baltimore Bullets for the 1959–60 season, and played two seasons for the club. In Spivey's first season with <b>the</b> <b>Bullets,</b> he had 36.3points per game, the highest average of his EBL career. Outside EBL competition, he received an opportunity to play opposite leading NBA center Wilt Chamberlain in a 1960 exhibition game, held in Milford, Connecticut, against the CBA's Milford Chiefs. Spivey had a 30-point, 23-rebound performance; his statistics were comparable to those of Chamberlain, who recorded a 31-point, 27-rebound game.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{issue that}} {{has an effect on}} the barrel's hold on <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> is <b>the</b> rifling. When <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> is fired, it is forced into the rifling, which cuts or [...] "engraves" [...] the surface of <b>the</b> <b>bullet.</b> If <b>the</b> rifling is a {{constant}} twist, then the rifling rides in the grooves engraved in <b>the</b> <b>bullet,</b> and everything is secure and sealed. If the rifling has a decreasing twist, then the changing angle of the rifling in the engraved grooves of <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> causes <b>the</b> rifling to become narrower than the grooves. This allows gas to blow by, and loosens the hold of <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> on <b>the</b> barrel. An increasing twist, however, will make the rifling become wider than the grooves in <b>the</b> <b>bullet,</b> maintaining <b>the</b> seal. When a rifled-barrel blank is selected for a gun, careful measurement of the inevitable variations in manufacture can determine if the rifling twist varies, and put the higher-twist end at the muzzle.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{the smaller}} mass of <b>the</b> <b>bullet,</b> {{compared}} {{that of the}} gun-shooter system, allows significantly more kinetic energy to be imparted to <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> than to <b>the</b> shooter.

5|$|The {{following}} year, on September 19, 1827, Bowie and Wright {{attended a}} duel on a sandbar outside of Natchez, Mississippi. Bowie supported duellist Samuel Levi Wells III, while Wright supported Wells's opponent, Dr. Thomas Harris Maddox. The duellists each fired two shots and, as neither {{man had been}} injured, resolved their duel with a handshake. Other members of the groups, who had various reasons for disliking each other, began fighting. Bowie {{was shot in the}} hip; after regaining his feet he drew a knife, described as a butcher knife, and charged his attacker, who hit Bowie over the head with his empty pistol, breaking the pistol and knocking Bowie to the ground. Wright shot at and missed the prone Bowie, who returned fire and possibly hit Wright. Wright then drew his sword cane and impaled Bowie. When Wright attempted to retrieve his blade by placing his foot on Bowie's chest and tugging, Bowie pulled him down and disemboweled Wright with his large knife. Wright died instantly, and Bowie, with Wright's sword still protruding from his chest, was shot again and stabbed by another member of the group. The doctors who had been present for the duel removed <b>the</b> <b>bullets</b> and patched Bowie's other wounds.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{locations}} {{reflect the}} dark atmosphere of real metro tunnels, with added survival horror elements. Paranormal phenomena, such as shadow figures, hallucinations, and unexplained noises are present, and, {{for the most}} part, the player has to rely on their lighter and rechargeable flashlight to navigate the darkness. Locations will often have an intricate layout, and the game lacks any form of map or objective marker, leaving the player to try finding their objectives with only a compass. The surface is more lethal than the metro system. Featuring a day-night cycle, and a dynamic weather system, these sections are severely irradiated and a gas mask must be worn at all times because of the toxic air. The player must collect air filters for the gas mask. These last several minutes each, and are automatically replaced provided the player has more in reserve. Players are also tasked to wipe off the dirt and blood splatter that collects on the gas mask. There is no head up display indicator to tell how long the player has until the gas mask's filters begin to fail — rather, a timer on the character's wristwatch shows how long until the current filter expires. The watch also serves to indicate to a player {{if they have been}} exposed to enemy attention. With every weapon, <b>the</b> <b>bullets</b> are (partly) visible, informing the player that their weapon is about to run out of ammunition and they have to reload. Instead of head up display the game makes use of audio and visual cues to present information to players.|$|E
5|$|As Styles was {{examining}} the ricochet marks, Alison Cahn {{was approached by}} an elderly woman, who led Cahn to a nearby apartment building. There, the woman introduced Cahn to her daughter—Carmen Proetta—who told Cahn that she had witnessed the shooting at the petrol station; although initially reluctant, she was persuaded by Cahn to give her account of the events in an affidavit. Proetta asserted that, immediately before McCann and Farrell were shot, she saw a police car travelling north on Winston Churchill Avenue with its siren activated; as she watched, the police car stopped abruptly and four men—one uniformed police officer and three men in civilian clothes—jumped out. She stated that the three men in plain clothes, all carrying pistols, leapt across the central reservation barrier, at which point she saw McCann and Farrell raise their hands. Proetta believed that all three men then opened fire, while McCann and Farrell had their hands in the air, and that neither suspect made any movements towards their clothing or Farrell's handbag. She went on to state that she witnessed {{one of the men}} crouch over McCann and Farrell while they were on the ground, and continue to shoot them. According to Styles, Proetta's account of the shooting tallied with the bullet marks he examined at the petrol station; he also found her description of <b>the</b> <b>bullets</b> striking the bodies particularly convincing, believing that only somebody who had witnessed such an event would be able to describe it so vividly. The journalists also discovered that Proetta's account of the soldiers arriving in a police car matched some of the newspaper reports from the day after the shootings.|$|E
50|$|The modern {{chronograph}} {{consists of}} two sensing areas called chronograph screens, which contain optical sensors that detect the passage of <b>the</b> <b>bullet.</b> <b>The</b> <b>bullet</b> is fired so it passes through both screens, and {{the time it takes}} <b>the</b> <b>bullet</b> to travel <b>the</b> distance between the screens is measured electronically.|$|R
