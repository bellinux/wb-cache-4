5|$|Geography affects {{solar energy}} {{potential}} because {{areas that are}} closer to the equator have a greater amount of solar radiation. However, the use of photovoltaics that can follow {{the position of the}} sun can significantly increase the solar energy potential in areas that are farther from the equator. Time variation effects the potential of solar energy because during <b>the</b> <b>nighttime</b> there is little solar radiation {{on the surface of the}} Earth for solar panels to absorb. This limits the amount of energy that solar panels can absorb in one day. Cloud cover can affect the potential of solar panels because clouds block incoming light from the sun and reduce the light available for solar cells.|$|E

5|$|The {{series is}} named after Spica, a binary star system in the {{constellation}} Virgo {{and one of the}} brightest stars in <b>the</b> <b>nighttime</b> sky. It appears as one star because of the relatively low center-to-center distance between the two component stars, estimated at an average of 11 million miles (17.7 million km). Astronomical observations also suggest that there may be additional stars in the Spica system. In the story, Asumi mentions Spica's distance to Earth as 350 light-years. This figure is also cited by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency; however, other sources indicate a distance of approximately 260 light-years.|$|E
5|$|During the afternoon, {{satellites}} {{revealed that}} Laura {{had developed a}} deep warm core, a characteristic of a tropical cyclone, but the wind field remained subtropical in nature. By <b>the</b> <b>nighttime</b> hours, the radius of the strongest winds contracted to 80mi (130km), much smaller than what is typical of a subtropical cyclone. However, Laura was still {{under the influence of}} an upper-level low and cloud tops remained shallow. However, the cloud tops became colder overnight and Laura {{was on the verge of}} becoming a tropical cyclone by the morning of September30, but strong interaction with the upper-level low meant it was still subtropical. Despite moving over colder waters, a water vapor satellite image determined that Laura had separated itself from the upper-level low, signifying it had developed into a tropical cyclone. Laura was re-classified as a tropical storm at a relatively high latitude, 40.6°N. Not long after being declared tropical, early signs of an extratropical transition appeared. Cold air began to enter the storm on the west side and forecast models showed Laura becoming extratropical the next morning and non-tropical later the next day.|$|E

Another attempt to intercept a British convoy in late November resulted in the Battle of Cape Spartivento. The Italian fleet left port on 26 November and clashed with the British fleet the next day, in an engagement that lasted for about an hour. Campioni broke off the action because he mistakenly believed he was facing a superior force, the result of poor aerial reconnaissance. The British heavy cruiser HMS Berwick was hit twice by 203mm rounds during the engagement, either fired by Fiume or her sister Pola.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} afternoon, an eye feature began to form; subsequently, Hernan was nearing {{hurricane}} status. However, by <b>the</b> <b>nighttime</b> hours, a microwave satellite {{found that the}} center of Hernan was located to the west-southwest of the eye feature, and the intensification ceased {{for the rest of}} the day and into the morning of August 8. Later in the morning, the center of Hernan was determined to be located underneath the eye and was determined to have become a hurricane, the fifth of the season, during the afternoon of August 8. Throughout the day, the eye became better defined, indicating that moderate northeasterly wind shear had already begun to diminish. Despite a cloud-filled eye, meteorologists showed Hernan peaking as a category 2 hurricane overnight.|$|E

5|$|The {{outbreak}} {{was caused}} by a vigorous upper-level trough that moved into the Southern Plains states on April 25. An extratropical cyclone developed ahead of this upper-level trough between northeastern Oklahoma and western Missouri, which moved northeast. Conditions were similar on April 26, with a predicted likelihood of severe thunderstorms, including an extended threat of strong to violent long-track tornadoes during the afternoon and evening hours; mixed-layer CAPE values were forecast to be around 3000–4000 J/kg, around east Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas. The storm mode on April 26 was predicted to consist of mostly discrete supercells during the afternoon and early evening, shifting over to a mesoscale convective complex, with more of a threat of damaging winds and hail during <b>the</b> <b>nighttime</b> hours.|$|E
5|$|This {{cosmology}} {{was accepted}} by Isaac Newton, Christiaan Huygens and later scientists. Edmund Halley (1720) and Jean-Philippe de Chéseaux (1744) noted independently that the assumption of an infinite space filled uniformly with stars {{would lead to the}} prediction that <b>the</b> <b>nighttime</b> sky would be as bright as the Sun itself; this became known as Olbers' paradox in the 19th century. Newton believed that an infinite space uniformly filled with matter would cause infinite forces and instabilities causing the matter to be crushed inwards under its own gravity. This instability was clarified in 1902 by the Jeans instability criterion. One solution to these paradoxes is the Charlier Universe, in which the matter is arranged hierarchically (systems of orbiting bodies that are themselves orbiting in a larger system, ad infinitum) in a fractal way such that the Universe has a negligibly small overall density; such a cosmological model had also been proposed earlier in 1761 by Johann Heinrich Lambert. A significant astronomical advance of the 18th century was the realization by Thomas Wright, Immanuel Kant and others of nebulae.|$|E

40|$|Imaging the {{atmosphere}} using ground-based sky cameras {{is a popular}} approach to study various atmospheric phenomena. However, it usually focuses on <b>the</b> daytime. <b>Nighttime</b> sky/cloud images are darker and noisier, and thus harder to analyze.

5|$|Troika {{wanted to}} make a 3D game, but was {{uncertain}} whether to build a new game engine or license an existing one and whether to use first- or third-person. At that time, the Source game engine was being built by Valve Corporation. Valve employee Scott Lynch approached Troika about using the engine, {{and it was the first}} external team to use it. Troika chose Source for its facial animation and lip-synching system, since it wanted players to speak to the characters face-to-face. Since the engine was in development with Bloodlines and Valve's own Half-Life 2, Troika was working with unfamiliar code and tools, forcing it to write its own code to compensate for the unfinished engine, and with only a single source for technical support. Troika developed a lighting system to create distinctive, moody illumination for <b>the</b> <b>nighttime</b> setting, a particle system for the special effects accompanying the vampire Disciplines, and a cloth system for clothing flow. Source lacked its later artificial intelligence (AI) coding, and Troika's code worked poorly with the Source engine.|$|E
5|$|Upon first {{becoming}} a tropical cyclone, the depression tracked towards the west-northwest {{due to a}} strong subtropical ridge located {{to the north of}} the system. A few hours later, the system made landfall in Dilasag, Philippines with winds of 55km/h (35mph 1-minute winds). After being over land for most of July31, the depression relocated into the South China Sea and the JTWC determined that it intensified into a tropical storm. At around 06:00 UTC, the JMA designated the storm Tropical Storm Prapiroon about 300km (185mi) northwest of Dagupan City, Philippines, a few hours later, PAGASA issued their final advisory on Tropical Storm Henry (Prapiroon) as it moved out of their area of responsibility. Prapiroon gradually intensified as it moved towards the west-northwest at 24km/h (15mph), and by that afternoon, the system had completely moved into the South China Sea. By <b>the</b> <b>nighttime</b> hours, the JMA upgraded Prapiroon to a severe tropical storm, as they determined that the maximum sustained winds had reached 95km/h (60mph 10-minute winds).

5|$|Where spotted hyenas and lions {{occupy the}} same {{geographic}} area, {{the two species}} occupy the same ecological niche, and are thus in direct competition with one another. In some cases, the extent of dietary overlap can {{be as high as}} 68.8%. Lions typically ignore spotted hyenas, unless they are on a kill or are being harassed by them. There exists a common misconception that hyenas steal kills from lions, but most often it is the other way around. Lions will readily steal the kills of spotted hyenas; in the Ngorongoro Crater, it is common for lions to subsist largely on kills stolen from hyenas. Lions are quick to follow the calls of hyenas feeding, a fact demonstrated by field experiments, during which lions repeatedly approached whenever the tape-recorded calls of hyenas feeding were played. When confronted on a kill by lions, spotted hyenas will either leave or wait patiently at a distance of 30–100 metres until the lions have finished eating. In some cases, spotted hyenas are bold enough to feed alongside lions, and may occasionally force lions off a kill. This mostly occurs during <b>the</b> <b>nighttime,</b> when hyenas are bolder. Spotted hyenas usually prevail against groups of lionesses unaccompanied by males if they outnumber them 4:1. In some instances they were seen to have taken on and routed two pride males while outnumbering them 5:1. The two species may act aggressively toward one another even when there is no food at stake. Lions may charge at hyenas and maul them for no apparent reason; one male lion was filmed killing two hyenas on separate occasions without eating them, and lion predation can account for up to 71% of hyena deaths in Etosha. Spotted hyenas have adapted to this pressure by frequently mobbing lions which enter their territories. Experiments on captive spotted hyenas revealed that specimens with no prior experience with lions act indifferently to the sight of them, but will react fearfully to the scent.|$|E
