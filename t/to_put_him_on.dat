5|$|His {{introduction}} to films was unusual. When visiting an aunt {{who lived in}} Brooklyn opposite Vitagraph Studios, Cagney would climb over the fence to watch the filming of John Bunny movies. He became involved in amateur dramatics, starting as a scenery boy for a Chinese pantomime at Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, {{one of the first}} settlement houses in the nation, where his brother Harry performed and his soon-to-be friend, Florence James, directed. He was initially content working behind the scenes and had no interest in performing. One night, however, Harry became ill, and although Cagney was not an understudy, his photographic memory of rehearsals enabled him to stand in for his brother without making a single mistake. Therefore, Florence James has the unique distinction of being the first director <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> a stage. Afterward, he joined a number of companies as a performer in a variety of roles.|$|E
25|$|In {{the tenth}} inning, Jansen hit McCann with a pitch <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> base with two outs. Subsequently, Springer walked on five pitches to move McCann to second base. McCann was then {{replaced}} by pinch runner Derek Fisher.|$|E
25|$|The {{severity}} of the repression led to angry debates in the Grand National Assembly. The assembly decided to send Nureddin Pasha to a commission of enquiry and <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> trial. Nureddin Pasha was relieved on 3 November 1921 and recalled to Ankara. But Mustafa Kemal prevented a trial.|$|E
5000|$|WVR {{originally}} wanted both Shooto {{world champion}} [...] "Lion Takeshi" [...] Takeshi Inoue and Deep titlist Dokonjonosuke Mishima {{to participate in}} the tournament but Inoue was unable due <b>to</b> Shooto <b>putting</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> their May 10 fight card while Mishima suffered a knee injury.|$|R
60|$|Bostil {{went into}} the village. All day long he was so busy with a {{thousand}} and one things referred <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>him,</b> undertaken by him, {{that he had no}} time to think. Back in his mind, however, there was a burden of which he was vaguely conscious all the time. He worked late into the night and slept late the next morning.|$|R
5000|$|The film {{features}} {{a tribute to}} Edgar Allan Poe. Corman says [...] "It was actually a second thought when we put Poe in it. We just started putting things in. In the original concept, he wasn’t in it. And we just decided <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> in <b>on</b> a motorcycle—it seemed appropriate." ...|$|R
25|$|In {{the final}} {{season of the}} WHA, Gordie had the {{opportunity}} to play with Wayne Gretzky in the 1979 WHA All-Star Game. The format of the game was a three-game series between the WHA All-Stars against HC Dynamo Moscow. The WHA All-Stars were coached by Jacques Demers, and Demers asked Howe if it was okay <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> a line with Gretzky and his son Mark. In Game One, the line scored seven points, as the WHA All-Stars won by a score of 4–2. In Game Two, Gretzky and Mark Howe each scored a goal and Gordie Howe picked up an assist as the WHA won 4–2. WHA also won Game Three to ensure a clean sweep.|$|E
25|$|NBC {{chose to}} {{continue}} the Late Night franchise, and {{at the suggestion of}} Saturday Night Live producer Lorne Michaels, hired Conan O'Brien, a relatively unknown writer for The Simpsons, to take over the time slot beginning in late 1993. Late Night with Conan O'Brien was constantly at risk for cancellation in its early years; at one low point in 1994, NBC threatened <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> a week-to-week contract. Executives were anxious to replace him with Greg Kinnear, who followed O'Brien with Later at 1:30am., but Kinnear left to pursue a career in acting later on. Interns filled empty seats in the audience while affiliates began to inquire about replacement hosts. Things improved for the show slowly (mostly revolving around O'Brien's performance) and by 1996, O'Brien's audience, largely young and male (a coveted demographic), grew steadily and the show began to best competitors in the ratings, which it would continue to do for 15 years.|$|E
500|$|Kraft had {{originally}} been surprised at Time Magazines decision <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the cover, telling the NASA public affairs officer that [...] "they've got the wrong guy. It should be Bob Gilruth... not me." [...] However, he eventually came {{to terms with the}} idea, and the portrait that was painted for the cover became one of his prized possessions.|$|E
60|$|Sanford {{was almost}} as gay as a lover. He {{seemed to be on}} the point of regaining his old place in his wife's respect. Somehow the {{possession}} of the package of money in his pocket seemed to make him more worthy of her, <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> more <b>on</b> an equality with her.|$|R
50|$|As he pries and spies {{upon his}} tenants, Rigsby often carries Vienna, his large, fluffy, {{black-and-white}} tomcat. Rigsby's amiable pet, and confidant, is {{so named because}} - as Rigsby tells it - when he goes <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> out <b>on</b> a cold dark night, if there is another set of eyes out there, then it's Good Night, Vienna.|$|R
50|$|In 2007, Eric Parker {{injured his}} toe during {{training}} camp. This led <b>to</b> the Chargers <b>putting</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> season-ending injured reserve. He {{was released by}} the team on July 23, 2008.|$|R
500|$|From 1909 to 1912, Kilmer was {{employed}} by Funk and Wagnalls, which was preparing an edition of The Standard Dictionary {{that would be}} published in 1912. According to Hillis, Kilmer's job [...] "was to define ordinary words assigned to him at five cents for each word defined. This was a job at which one would ordinarily earn ten to twelve dollars a week, but Kilmer attacked the task with such vigor and speed that it was soon thought wisest <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> a regular salary." ...|$|E
500|$|Butcher {{abandoned}} {{the history of}} Buffalo and Dawson counties after spending {{more than a thousand}} dollars on the project. [...] Discontented with his profession as photographer, which had failed to make him a fortune or even <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> a sound financial footing, he turned his efforts elsewhere. [...] In 1911, he turned the Kearney studio over to his son and began work as an agent for the Standard Land Company. [...] He gave stereopticon lectures throughout Buffalo and Dawson counties promoting the company's irrigated lands in south Texas, and made plans to move there himself.|$|E
500|$|Afterward, Johnson began celebrating {{his fourth}} {{consecutive}} Sprint Cup Series championship. During the celebration, Johnson was delighted with his performance, saying, [...] "The {{truth of it}} is, to do something that's never been done in this sport -- to love the sport like I do and respect it like I do -- and the greats: Petty, Earnhardt, Gordon ... to do something they've never done is so awesome. To win four championships in eight years, what this team has done ... I don't know where to start. It's unbelievable." [...] Burton, who finished second, commended Johnson's achievements saying, [...] "It’s hard to say he’s the best when you’re out there racing against him, but you have <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the list.” Martin, who finished second in points, said, ...|$|E
50|$|By {{this time}} he had {{developed}} a serious alcohol problem. He tried to stop drinking, worked as a printer for a while but eventually started a new band and called Harold Kudlets <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> back <b>on</b> the road. The newly formed band played all the old Rock & Roll stuff but with more blues and boogie woogie thrown in.|$|R
25|$|In {{the twelfth}} stage, all the favourites {{finished}} together. That stage was won by Belgian Maurice Blomme, {{but not without}} difficulties: he was so exhausted that he mistook a dark shadow for the finish line, and stopped racing. The secretary of the Tour de France, Jean Garnault, had <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> back <b>on</b> his bicycle so he would ride the last meters of the stage.|$|R

500|$|In 1466, Stephen regained Khotyn from Poland in a {{diplomatic}} victory, {{but in the}} same year, Corvinus became on bad terms with King Casimir IV Jagiellon of Poland, which frustrated the Hungarian king further, knowing that Moldavia was a Polish fief. One year later, in 1467, the locals of Transylvania started an uprising in which Corvinus had a difficult time quelling the riots. He later found out that Stephen had supported the rioters, [...] probably in order to find and kill Aron. Długosz writes in his ‘’Annals’’ that in 1467, a certain [...] "Berendeja" [...] went to the court of Corvinus and promised to make Moldavia his vassal, if the King would in turn make him Prince of Moldavia. This was denounced by Romanian historian Nicolae Iorga, who argued that Corvinus started recruiting troops and took Aron with him <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the Moldavian throne. This is disputed by Długosz though, who in ‘’Historiae Polonicae’’, adds that Corvinus brought with him both Aron and Berendeja, making unknown whom the king considered more worthy of the Moldavian throne.|$|E
500|$|Once {{his junior}} season at Cornell ended, Nieuwendyk joined the {{national}} team for five games before turning professional with the Flames. [...] He made his NHL debut on March 10, 1987, against the Washington Capitals and scored his first NHL goal against goaltender Pete Peeters. He appeared in nine regular season games in the 1986–87 NHL season, scoring five goals and one assist, and appeared in six playoff games. Playing his first full season in 1987–88, Nieuwendyk {{captured the attention of}} the sports media by scoring 32 goals in his first 42 games <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> a pace to surpass Mike Bossy's rookie record of 53 goals. [...] Nieuwendyk finished two goals short of Bossy's record, but led the team with 51 goals and was the second first-year player to score at least 50 goals in one season. [...] He played in his first NHL All-Star Game, was named to the All-Rookie Team and was voted the winner of the Calder Memorial Trophy as the NHL's top rookie.|$|E
500|$|The {{hearing before}} {{a panel of}} six judges on 16 April 1860 was {{attended}} by neither the Mortara family nor Feletti—the former {{because they were in}} Turin and learned of the trial date only two days beforehand, and the latter because he refused to recognise the new authorities' right <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> trial. With the evidence gathered by Curletti and Carboni already in hand, the prosecution had no witnesses to call. The prosecutor Radamisto Valentini, a lawyer fighting his first major case, declared that Feletti had ordered the seizure alone and on his own initiative, and then turned his focus to Carboni's second point of how the authorities in Rome could have possibly concluded that Morisi's story was genuine. Valentini went over Morisi's account in detail, arguing that even if things had happened as she said, the baptism had not been administered properly and was therefore invalid. He then highlighted the inconsistencies between her testimony and the other accounts, condemned Morisi as a silly girl [...] "corrupted by the foul breath and touch of foreign soldiers... rolled over without shame with them", and finally charged that Feletti had ordered the seizure himself out of megalomania and [...] "an inquisitor's hatred of Judaism".|$|E

2500|$|On the whole, antiquity looked favourably on Sallust as a historian. Tacitus speaks {{highly of}} him (Annals, iii.30); and Quintilian [...] does not {{hesitate}} <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> a level with Thucydides, and declares {{that he is}} a greater historian than Livy. Martial joins the praise: [...] "Sallust, according to the judgment of the learned, will rank as the prince of Roman historiographers".|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} January 2006, the Washington Nationals offered Sosa two {{different}} minor-league offers, both of which he turned down. On February 15, 2006, Sosa's agent Adam Katz stated: [...] "We're not going <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the retirement list. We decided that [...] {{was the best thing}} to do. But I can say, with reasonable certainty, that we've seen Sammy in a baseball uniform for the last time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thomas quickly had {{to adjust}} to Knight's disciplinarian style. At the 1979 Pan American Games in Puerto Rico Knight got so mad at Thomas he {{threatened}} <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> a plane home. Knight recalled yelling at the freshman-to-be, [...] "You {{ought to go to}} DePaul, Isiah, because you sure as hell aren't going to be an Indiana player playing like that." [...] Prior to the start of his freshman year, the 1979–80 season, Knight became so upset with Thomas that he kicked him out of a practice. According to Thomas, Knight was making a point that no player, no [...] "matter how talented, is bigger than Knight's philosophy." ...|$|E

5000|$|On August 23, the Blue Jays {{played the}} New York Yankees. José Bautista hit is 39th and 40th home {{run of the}} game {{to become the first}} Blue Jay since 2003 to hit 40 home runs in a season. In the same game, Brandon Morrow struck out another 12 batters in under 7 innings of work to raise is K/9 average <b>to</b> 11.0, <b>putting</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> pace <b>to</b> have the highest single season k/9 average in Blue Jays history.|$|R
2500|$|A Turkish governor, Ebubekir Hazim Tepeyran of the Sivas province, said in 1919 {{that the}} massacres were so horrible {{that he could}} not bear to report them. He {{referred}} to the atrocities committed against Greeks in the Black Sea region, and according to the official tally 11,181 Greeks were murdered in 1921 by the Central Army under the command of Nurettin Pasha (who is infamous for the killing of Archbishop Chrysostomos). [...] Some parliamentary deputies demanded that Nurettin Pasha be sentenced to death and it was decided <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> trial, although the trial was later revoked by the intervention of Mustafa Kemal. Taner Akçam wrote that according to one newspaper, Nurettin Pasha had suggested to kill all the remaining Greek and Armenian populations in Anatolia, a suggestion rejected by Mustafa Kemal.|$|E
2500|$|Nothing {{was more}} {{controversial}} during Clarke's {{time as a}} general manager than his dispute with Eric Lindros and his parents, particularly his father Carl who was Eric's agent. The trouble started following the 1997–98 season while negotiating a new contract for Lindros. Clarke threatened to trade him, saying, [...] "If {{you want to be}} the highest-paid player in the game or close to it, you've got to play that way." [...] While Lindros was not traded and he played well during the 1998–99 season, his season was cut short after sustaining a collapsed lung during a game on April 1 against the Nashville Predators. Lindros' parents criticized team trainer John Worley and claimed Clarke tried to kill their son by trying <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> a plane back to Philadelphia, which would have been fatal given his condition.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of July 27, 2008, Ivins was found {{unconscious}} at his home. He was taken to Frederick Memorial Hospital and died on July 29 from what was then called an overdose of Tylenol with codeine, an apparent suicide. No autopsy was ordered following his death because, according to {{an officer in the}} local police department, the state medical examiner [...] "determined that an autopsy wouldn't be necessary" [...] based on laboratory test results of blood taken from the body. A summary of the police report of his death, released in 2009, lists the cause of death as liver and kidney failure, citing his purchase of two bottles of Tylenol PM (containing diphenhydramine), contradicting earlier reports of Tylenol with codeine. [...] His family declined <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>him</b> <b>on</b> the liver transplant list, and he was removed from life support.|$|E
