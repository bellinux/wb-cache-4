5|$|The {{most common}} set of catabolic {{reactions}} in animals can be separated into three main stages. In the first stage, large organic molecules, such as proteins, polysaccharides or lipids, are digested into their smaller components outside cells. Next, these smaller molecules are taken up by cells and converted to smaller molecules, usually acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA), which releases some energy. Finally, the acetyl group on the CoA is oxidised to water and {{carbon dioxide in the}} citric acid cycle and electron transport chain, releasing <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>that</b> is stored by reducing the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) into NADH.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{patterns}} of reflectivity are important clues for the meteorologist as well. The three body scatter spike is an example. This {{is the result}} of energy from the radar hitting hail and being deflected to the ground, where they deflect back to the hail and then to the radar. The energy took more time to go from the hail to the ground and back, as opposed to <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>that</b> went direct from the hail to the radar, and the echo is further away from the radar than the actual location of the hail on the same radial path, forming a cone of weaker reflectivities.|$|E

Vegeta outmatched Frieza showing the flaw of his new form where his body hasn't been used to <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>that</b> gets consumed. Out of desperation, Frieza had destroyed Earth but with Whis' do over ability, Goku was able to prevent Frieza from destroying the Earth after being too over confident against {{him in the first place}} and destroys him once more.|$|E

5|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} heat energy {{generated}} {{and stored in}} the Earth. Thermal energy is <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>that</b> determines the temperature of matter. The geothermal energy of the Earth's crust originates from the original formation of the planet and from radioactive decay of materials (in currently uncertain but possibly roughly equal proportions). The geothermal gradient, which is the difference in temperature between {{the core of the}} planet and its surface, drives a continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface. The adjective geothermal originates from the Greek roots γη (ge), meaning earth, and θερμος (thermos), meaning hot.|$|E
5|$|If {{the mass}} of the nucleus {{following}} a fusion reaction is less than the sum of the masses of the separate particles, then the difference between these two values can be emitted as a type of usable energy (such as a gamma ray, or the kinetic energy of a beta particle), as described by Albert Einstein's mass–energy equivalence formula, E=mc2, where m is the mass loss and c is the speed of light. This deficit is part of the binding energy of the new nucleus, and it is the non-recoverable loss of <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>that</b> causes the fused particles to remain together in a state that requires this energy to separate.|$|E
5|$|Lead's lighter carbon group {{congeners}} form stable or metastable allotropes {{with the}} tetrahedrally coordinated and covalently bonded diamond cubic structure. The energy levels of their outer s- and p-orbitals are {{close enough to}} allow mixing into four hybrid sp3 orbitals. In lead, the inert pair effect increases the separation between its s- and p-orbitals, and the gap cannot be overcome by <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>that</b> would be released by extra bonds following hybridization. Rather than having a diamond cubic structure, lead forms metallic bonds in which only the p-electrons are delocalized and shared between the Pb2+ ions. Lead consequently has a face-centered cubic structure like the similarly sized divalent metals calcium and strontium.|$|E

5|$|The brown honeyeater is {{more active}} {{in the early morning}} than at other times of the day; flying more when visiting flowers at the time when nectar is most abundant. Its body mass {{decreases}} during the night, and then increases during the day with the greatest increase occurring during the important first hour of early morning foraging. It seems to make up around half of the overnight water loss during this hour. <b>The</b> <b>energy</b> <b>that</b> the brown honeyeater can potentially get from nectar exceeds its requirements in all seasons except winter, when it needs to be selective in the plants that are used, to balance energy intake and expenditure. It compensates for any lessening in nectar concentration by increasing the frequency of feeding.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} storm {{of the season}} was Hurricane Bob, {{which at the time}} was among the ten costliest United States hurricanes. After brushing the Outer Banks of North Carolina and Long Island in New York, the hurricane made landfall on Rhode Island. It caused $1.5billion in damage (1991USD), mostly in Massachusetts, and 17fatalities. The strongest hurricane of the season was Claudette, which reached peak winds of 135mph (215km/h) near Bermuda. It passed near the island but did not cause any damage. Tropical Storm Fabian was the only tropical storm to move over or near Cuba or Florida, producing heavy rainfall but no damage. Hurricane Grace, the final named storm of the season, provided <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>that</b> {{led to the development of}} a powerful nor'easter known as the Perfect Storm. Originating from an extratropical storm, the Perfect Storm intensified while moving westward toward New England, leaving $200million in damage and causing coastal damage from Puerto Rico to Florida and northward through Canada. It later transitioned into a hurricane over the Gulf Stream, finally dissipating over Nova Scotia on November2.|$|E
5|$|When Backer et al. {{reported}} their finding in November 1982, {{they found that}} the rotation period of PSR B1937+21 was increasing at a rate of 3 seconds per second. Pulsars are expected to slow over time, as <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>that</b> they emit is ultimately drawn from the rotational energy of the pulsar. Using the initially observed values for the period and spin down rate, and assuming a minimum period of 0.5 milliseconds for pulsars, the maximum age for PSR B1937+21 was found to be about 750 years old. The estimate of the minimum possible period is obtained from the centrifugal break-up limit, which is the rotational period at which the centrifugal force and the self-gravity of the pulsar are equal. The value of the minimum rotational period depends upon the neutron star equation of state, with different models giving values between 0.3 and 1 millisecond, which corresponds to a rotation frequency of 1-3 kilohertz. There may be mechanisms such as gravitational radiation which keep the pulsar from reaching this absolute limit, but pulsars can spin no faster.|$|E

5|$|When a pair {{of virtual}} {{particles}} (such as an electron and positron) is created {{in the vicinity of}} the event horizon, random spatial positioning might result in one of them to appear on the exterior; this process is called quantum tunnelling. The gravitational potential of the black hole can then supply <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>that</b> transforms this virtual particle into a real particle, allowing it to radiate away into space. In exchange, the other member of the pair is given negative energy, which results in a net loss of mass-energy by the black hole. The rate of Hawking radiation increases with decreasing mass, eventually causing the black hole to evaporate away until, finally, it explodes.|$|E
5|$|Even more remarkably, {{there is}} a general set of laws known as black hole mechanics, which is {{analogous}} to the laws of thermodynamics. For instance, by the second law of black hole mechanics, the area of the event horizon of a general black hole will never decrease with time, analogous to the entropy of a thermodynamic system. This limits <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>that</b> can be extracted by classical means from a rotating black hole (e.g. by the Penrose process). There is strong evidence that the laws of black hole mechanics are, in fact, a subset of the laws of thermodynamics, and that the black hole area is proportional to its entropy. This leads to a modification of the original laws of black hole mechanics: for instance, as the second law of black hole mechanics becomes part of the second law of thermodynamics, it is possible for black hole area to decrease—as long as other processes ensure that, overall, entropy increases. As thermodynamical objects with non-zero temperature, black holes should emit thermal radiation. Semi-classical calculations indicate that indeed they do, with the surface gravity playing the role of temperature in Planck's law. This radiation is known as Hawking radiation (cf. the quantum theory section, below).|$|E
