5|$|When Ohioan began sailing for American-Hawaiian, {{the company}} shipped cargo from East Coast ports via the Straits of Magellan to West Coast ports and Hawaii, and vice versa. Eastbound {{shipments}} were primarily sugar and pineapple from Hawaii, but westbound cargoes were more general in nature.

5|$|Two years later, {{construction}} {{began on}} two auxiliary lanes on I-805 southbound from SR54 to Bonita Road, to improve traffic flow at the SR54 interchange. In 2010, Caltrans proposed adding high-occupancy toll express lanes between SR15 and East Palomar Street in Chula Vista. The California Transportation Commission (CTC) awarded $100million {{for the work}} in June 2011, which would be split into two phases at the interchange with SR54. Work is also underway to add two HOV lanes between SR52 and Mira Mesa Boulevard; this project also received $59.5million from the CTC in September 2011. Meanwhile, SANDAG made arrangements to purchase the SR125 toll road and reduce the tolls, which was hoped to encourage commuters <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> road instead of I-805 and reduce congestion; this would then enable Caltrans to construct two managed lanes instead of the original four.|$|E

5|$|The {{key idea}} is that under certain {{circumstances}} where a representation has been made by a public authority to an individual who {{would be affected by}} a decision by the authority, the individual expects to be heard before the decision is made. To deny the right to be heard amounts to unfairness. The court will thus be inclined to quash a decision if there has been unfairness and reliance by the individual on the representation to his detriment. This is demonstrated in the 1983 House of Lords decision Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service (the GCHQ case). This case involved the trade unions of employees of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), a government signals and intelligence department, who argued that they had an expectation to be consulted before the Minister took the decision to deny them the right to join trade unions. The Minister argued that it had been necessary <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> step as the trade unions were conducting strikes that crippled GCHQ operations and threatened the national security of the United Kingdom. The Court established that in the past the trade unions had been consulted on employment-related matters, even though it was not a rule. However, their Lordships clearly recognized that an individual can have a legitimate expectation to be consulted before a decision is taken when it is proven that this is the practice. Such a representation can {{come in the form of}} a clear and unambiguous promise to hear the individual or an established practice to consult those affected before taking the decision. Nonetheless, on the facts of the case, their Lordships agreed that they could not review the Minister's decision even though there was an enforceable legitimate expectation as the decision had been made on national security grounds.|$|E

The ultimate goal of Maurice was <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> city in 1591 but the defensvies looked too strong.

25|$|In October, Overland {{moved to}} have the entire case {{dismissed}} {{on the grounds that}} the initial investigators should have identified Lazarus as a suspect but failed to do so. In support, he cited missing aspects of the original file such as recordings of interviews, Sherri Rasmussen's blood toxicology report, as well as a polygraph test Ruetten allegedly failed. The motion noted Nels Rasmussen's belief that Lazarus was a suspect at the time of the murder, and his ensuing efforts to get the LAPD <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> theory seriously. Because of this failure, he argued, Lazarus' due process rights had been adversely affected since the quality of evidence had degraded in the intervening 23 years.|$|E

He took 54 wickets in May {{mostly on the}} placid Oval pitches, and carried on so well that he took 171 County Championship wickets for 15.42 each even when many pitches were too wet for him. He played for England against India at Old Trafford but the wicket was so good that even his energetic delivery could produce no venom. The following year (1937) Gover did equally well, again taking 201 wickets. He remains the only fast bowler <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> many wickets in a season, since Tom Richardson in 1897.|$|E
