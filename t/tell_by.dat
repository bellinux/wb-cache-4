Liverpool responded late in the game when defender Chris Lawler scored in the 89th minute; however, Ajax scored a minute later through Henk Groot to win the match 5–1.

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{evidence for}} {{occupation of the}} citadel mound dates to the 5th millennium BC, and possibly earlier. It appears {{for the first time}} in historical sources in the Ebla tablets around 2,300 BC, and gained particular importance during the Neo-Assyrian period. During the Sassanian period and the Abbasid Caliphate, Erbil was an important centre for Christianity. After the Mongols captured the citadel in 1258, the importance of Erbil declined. During the 20th century, the urban structure was significantly modified, as a result of which a number of houses and public buildings were destroyed. In 2007, the High Commission for Erbil Citadel Revitalization (HCECR) was established to oversee the restoration of the citadel. In the same year, all inhabitants, except one family, were evicted from the citadel as part of a large restoration project. Since then, archaeological research and restoration works have been carried out at and around the <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> various international teams and in cooperation with local specialists. The government plans to have 50 families live in the citadel once it is renovated.|$|E

Rich Goldstein of The Daily Beast argued that the emotional depth of the series increased during this season, highlighting [...] "Simon & Marcy" [...] as an example. Emily Guendelsberger of The A.V. Club later awarded the entire season an [...] "A", noting that [...] "Adventure Time has somehow managed to stay on fire for its fifth season's double-wide 52-episode run." [...] Guendelsberger praised the show's aforementioned creativity and experimentation, and also wrote that [...] "the writing staff has also taken the less-obvious X-Files approach: expanding the length of the stories they're able to <b>tell</b> <b>by</b> linking monster-of-the-week episodes into longer arcs." [...] The A.V. Club later named the series the 27th best television series of 2014, noting that, [...] "The end of the super-sized season five saw a string of conceptually ambitious episodes that blew the world of Ooo wide open, deepening the stories of Lemongrab, Lumpy Space Princess' doomed romance, and Ice King's past as Simon Petrikov." [...] The site selected [...] "Lemonhope" [...] as the stand-out from the season's end. Each episode was also graded by The A.V.

500|$|The {{town meeting}} {{attracted}} a packed crowd of over a thousand, with Nixon supporters distributing anti-Voorhis literature at the door. The Senate proxies spoke first for their candidates, followed by Voorhis. Nixon, who had notified organizers {{that he would}} be late due to another commitment, arrived during Voorhis's speech, and remained backstage until the congressman had completed his talk. He then came onstage, shook hands with Voorhis, and delivered a fifteen-minute address. A question-and-answer period then followed, with a Nixon supporter asking Voorhis about his onetime Socialist registration, and about his views on monetary policy. [...] After the representative responded, a Voorhis supporter asked Nixon why he was making [...] "false charges" [...] about the supposed Voorhis CIO-PAC endorsement. [...] In response, Nixon reached into his pocket and pulled out a copy of a Southern California NCPAC bulletin mentioning the group's endorsement of Voorhis. [...] The congressman was unaware of the endorsement; those of his aides in the know had [...] "completely forgotten" [...] to tell him. [...] Nixon walked halfway across the stage and displayed it to Voorhis, asking him to read it for himself. Voorhis came from his seat and took it, and (according to Bullock, who served as timekeeper at the debate) [...] "mumbled" [...] that this seemed to be a different organization from the CIO-PAC. [...] Nixon reclaimed the document, and began to read out names {{of the members of the}} boards of directors of the two groups, [...] "It's the same thing, virtually, when they have the same directors."
