5|$|Before the 1978 season, the Stampeders traded Allison to the Winnipeg Blue Bombers for wide {{receiver}} Rick Koswina. Allison played in nine regular season {{games for the}} Blue Bombers recording one fumble recovery before being released. He was <b>then</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> by his original team, the Toronto Argonauts, in October 1978. Allison finished the 1978 season with the Argonauts, playing in five more games, before being cut in June 1979.|$|E

He had spent the afternoon with Margaret Hacker and <b>then</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> Tim and Kelly for Tim's hockey game. After dropping the children back off with their mother at about 8:45, he had dinner with Hacker, leaving her around 11:15 in the evening.|$|E
5|$|In June 1964, {{during a}} {{performance}} at the Railway, Townshend accidentally broke {{the head of his}} guitar on the low ceiling of the stage. Angered by the audience's laughter, he smashed the instrument on the stage, <b>then</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> another guitar and continued the show. The following week, the audience were keen to see a repeat of the event. Moon obliged by kicking his drum kit over, and auto-destructive art became a feature of the Who's live set.|$|E

5|$|Altgens {{tried to}} find a good camera angle on the bridge, but uniformed police said it was private {{property}} and turned him away, and he moved to a location within the plaza. He began photographing the motorcade on Main Street as the vehicles approached Houston Street, and got a close-up of the presidential limousine as it turned right onto Houston. He <b>then</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> his equipment bag and ran on the grass toward the south curb along Elm Street, stopping across from the Plaza's north colonnade. Altgens heard a loud noise {{at about the same time}} as his first photograph from that spot (simultaneous to Zapruder film frame 255), but he did not recall having any reaction since he thought the noise came from a firecracker.|$|E
5|$|Following the missed field goal, Auburn {{took over}} on offense at its six-yard line—the {{point from which}} Tech had missed the kick. Ronnie Brown picked up 13 yards and a first down on three rushes. Carnell Williams <b>then</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> three yards, and Jason Campbell threw a seven-yard pass that gave Auburn another first down. A five-yard penalty against Virginia Tech pushed Auburn's offense near midfield, and Ronnie Brown {{returned}} to the field, rushing the ball four consecutive times for 16yards and driving the Tigers into Virginia Tech territory. Facing a fourth down and one yard, Auburn elected to give the ball to Brown again. On the one-yard run, however, Brown fumbled the ball, which was recovered by Virginia Tech's Mikal Baagee with 8:38 remaining.|$|E
5|$|Linton ran {{for nine}} yards, <b>then</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> {{a first down}} with a five-yard gain on second down. Keldorf {{completed}} a 12-yard pass to Barnes for a first down, Linton ran seven yards to the Carolina 43-yard line, then gained another first down with a run to the 50-yard line. From midfield, Keldorf attempted a deep pass on first down, but the ball fell incomplete. On second down, Keldorf completed a four-yard pass to Linton but was sacked on third down by the Virginia Tech defense. The sack forced Carolina to punt {{for the second time}} in the game, and the ball rolled out of bounds at the Virginia Tech 11-yard line.|$|E

5|$|The {{reclamation}} of Chat Moss and Trafford Moss was innovative in {{that instead}} of constructing roads to give access for the material to be dumped onto the bog, a movable light railway was developed. Narrow gauge track– which allowed {{the weight of the}} wagons to be spread evenly across an area of the bog– was temporarily laid down and <b>then</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> and relaid elsewhere as needed. Roscoe was declared bankrupt in 1821, but the reclamation work continued under the stewardship of others who took over his leasehold interest, amongst them William Baines, the anti-Corn Law MP and owner of the Leeds Mercury newspaper.|$|E
5|$|An extra in the film, Tyler Nelson, {{violated}} his nondisclosure {{agreement in}} an interview with The Edmond Sun on September 17, 2007, which was <b>then</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> by the mainstream media. It is unknown if he remained in the final cut. At Nelson's request, The Edmond Sun subsequently pulled the story from its website. On October 2, 2007, a Superior Court order was filed finding that Nelson knowingly violated the agreement. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed. A number of production photos and sensitive documents pertaining to the film's production budget were also stolen from Spielberg's production office. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department set up a sting operation after being alerted by a webmaster that the thief might try to sell the photos. On October 4, 2007, the seller, 37-year-old Roderick Eric Davis, was arrested. He pleaded guilty to two felony counts and was sentenced to two years and four months in prison.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies' kickoff {{after the}} {{defensive}} score was caught at {{the goal line}} {{and returned to the}} 28-yard line by Boston College's Chris Fox. Following the return, Davis completed a seven-yard pass to the 35-yard line, <b>then</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> a first down to the 42-yard line with another pass. Davis then scrambled three yards and threw for another first down, this time to tight end Lars Anderson. Now at the Tech 46-yard line, Davis threw three incomplete passes before throwing another on fourth down. With 6:39 remaining in the game, Boston College turned the ball over on downs to the Virginia Tech offense. The Hokies again began to run out the clock. Evans ran the ball three consecutive times, but on the third rush, Evans fumbled {{for the second time in}} the game. The fumble was recovered by Boston College linebacker Mark Herzlich and Boston College's offense returned to the field.|$|E

5|$|The {{returning}} Chinook, {{carrying the}} remainder of the A Company group including second-in-command (2IC) Captain Danny Matthews, came under fire from a heavy machine gun in Magbeni, which was promptly strafed by one of the 657 Squadron Lynx helicopters until it ceased firing. The soldiers in Matthews' helicopter exited and joined {{the first half of the}} company group on the ground. As the company group moved forward, an explosion—possibly a mortar fired by the British fire support group—injured seven men, including company commander Major Matthew Lowe, one of the platoon commanders, a signaller, and two of Lowe's headquarters staff. Another signaller radioed in a casualty report, and one of the Chinooks en route to Gberi Bana to extract the Royal Irish (who had just been freed by the SAS) landed on the track through the village. The casualties were loaded onto the helicopter, which <b>then</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> the Royal Irish and flew to RFA Sir Percivale where all 13 men were assessed by medics.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, and Shyrone Stith returned the opening kickoff from the end zone to the Tech 44-yard line. On the first play of the game, Tech quarterback Al Clark completed a pass to Angelo Harrison, but Alabama committed a five-yard offsides penalty, setting up the Hokies at their 49-yard line. After the penalty, running back Lamont Pegues ran straight ahead for a gain of four yards <b>then</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> a first down with a short gain on the next play. Clark completed a pass to Harrison at the 43-yard line, then Clark broke free of the Alabama defense on an improvised run, scrambling 43 {{yards for a touchdown}} and the game's first points. Kicker Shayne Graham kicked the extra point, and Virginia Tech took a 70 lead over Alabama with 12:25 remaining in the first quarter.|$|E
5|$|Between 7:00a.m. and 8:00a.m. CT on March 3, {{the morning}} Fischer was killed, Olivarez {{confirmed}} with Garza {{at the motel}} that the murder was successful. He then went to Martínez' shop {{to tell her the}} teenager was dead. She told Garza that she would not give him the money unless there was solid proof that Fischer was dead. Garza then talked with Olivarez and Puentes Pizaña at the motel room. A few hours after the murder, Martínez phoned Cisneros and told her that the job had been carried out. Cisneros arrived at her store minutes later and left a sealed envelope with the money. Cisneros then went to St. Joe and picked up her daughter from school. Later that evening, Garza and Puentes Pizaña met with Martínez and picked up the envelope. They headed back to the motel and Garza handed over the envelope to Olivarez. Garza claims that the hitmen received $3,500, though he stated he never counted the money. Martínez said she did and that it was $3,000. Investigators believe it could have been as much as $5,000. Garza was <b>then</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> by his nephew from Matamoros and taken to the Harlingen airport, where he flew back to San Antonio. On his way to the airport, he passed through Rancho Viejo and recalled seeing police cars and a house cordoned off with yellow tape.|$|E

5|$|In the 1999–2000 NBA season, Bowen {{signed with}} the Philadelphia 76ers, and was later traded to the Chicago Bulls and {{immediately}} waived, <b>then</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> off waivers by the Miami Heat. In that season, he wore jersey #12 instead of #30 and appeared in 69 games, averaging 2.8 points and 1.4 rebounds in 12.7 minutes per game, and scored in double-figures six times. In the following year, Bowen was retained by the Heat. In that year, he had his breakout season. For {{the first time in}} his career, he played in all 82 regular season games, averaged 7.6 points, 3.0 rebounds, 1.6 assists and 1.01 steals in 32.7 minutes per game and set new single season career-highs in games, points, rebounds, assists, blocks, minutes, field goals made and attempted, three-point goals made and attempted and free throws made and attempted. Bowen logged more minutes (2,685 vs. 2,678), scored more points (623 vs. 606) and hit more threes (103 vs. 54) than he had in his first four seasons combined. Especially, Bowen earned himself a reputation as a defensive stopper. For his strong perimeter defense, he was voted into the All-Defensive Second Team.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of 27 February, 'C' Company, 2nd Parachute Battalion, {{under the command of}} Major John Frost, parachuted into France {{a few miles from the}} installation. The force then {{proceeded}} to assault the villa in which the radar equipment was kept, killing several members of the German garrison and capturing the installation after a brief fire-fight. A technician that had come with the force partially dismantled the Würzburg radar array and removed several key pieces to take back to Britain, the raiding force then retreated to the evacuation beach. The detachment assigned to clear the beach had failed to do so, however, and another brief fire-fight was required to eliminate the Germans guarding the beach. The raiding force was <b>then</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> by a small number of landing craft and transferred to several Motor Gun Boats which brought them back to Britain. The raid was entirely successful. The airborne troops suffered only a few casualties, and the pieces of the radar they brought back, along with a German radar technician, allowed British scientists to understand German advances in radar and to create counter-measures to neutralise those advances.|$|E
5|$|Qualification for Euro 1988 meant {{winning a}} group {{containing}} Bulgaria, Luxembourg and Scotland. The campaign opened with Belgium at the Heysel Stadium, and though Ireland contained danger man Nico Claesen, {{they had to}} settle for a 2–2 draw after conceding twice from corner-kicks; Frank Stapleton and Liam Brady scored the goals for Ireland. They then dominated Scotland at Lansdowne Road, but failed to find the net and instead drew 0–0. In the return fixture at Hampden Park Mark Lawrenson scored an early goal and another clean sheet won the Irish their first win of qualification. The campaign faltered with a 2–1 loss in Bulgaria, though Charlton was furious with referee Carlos Silva Valente as he felt that both of Lachezar Tanev's goals should not have counted as Nasko Sirakov allegedly pushed Mick McCarthy in the build-up to the first and he felt that Sirakov was outside the penalty box when he was fouled by Kevin Moran – Valente instead gave a penalty. They picked up another point after a 0–0 draw with Belgium in Dublin. Despite not particularly impressing Ireland <b>then</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> six points with two victories over Luxembourg. They ended the campaign with a 2–0 home win over Bulgaria, Paul McGrath and Kevin Moran the scorers, though Liam Brady (an ever-present in qualification) picked up a two match suspension after lashing out late in the game after being kicked by a Bulgarian. Despite the victory the Irish had to rely on a favour from the Scots in order to qualify, who duly obliged with a 1–0 victory in Sofia to keep Bulgaria one point behind Ireland in the table.|$|E

5|$|The ball {{rolled out}} of bounds at the one-yard line, and Tech was penalized half the {{distance}} to the goal line due to a holding penalty during the kick. Pegues ran for a two-yard gain, then was stopped for a loss of one yard on second down. On third down, Clark completed a pass to Harrison for a first down at the 11-yard line. After the first down, a Tech running play was stopped for a loss of three yards, then Clark scrambled to the 16-yard line, five yards short of the first down. Stith then gained the first down with a run to the 25-yard line. During this time, Tech concentrated on running out the clock by executing multiple running plays, which do not stop the game clock, unlike passing plays. After the first down, Clark was sacked by Alabama defender Cornelius Griffin for a loss of seven yards. Clark regained the lost yards with a nine-yard pass, <b>then</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> a first down with a shovel pass. On first down, Clark completed a pass to Ricky Hall with a first down at the Alabama 45-yard line. At this point, Tech switched from running down the clock to attempting passes downfield in hopes of scoring before halftime. With 32 seconds remaining in the first half, Clark threw an incomplete pass. Clark then was sacked by the Alabama defense, setting up third down at the Tech 46-yard line. Stith ran for a short gain, then Tech set up for a long pass downfield on fourth down.|$|E
