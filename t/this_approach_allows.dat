25|$|An RGB triplet (r,g,b) {{represents}} the three-dimensional coordinate {{of the point}} of the given color within the cube or its faces or along its edges. <b>This</b> <b>approach</b> <b>allows</b> computations of the color similarity of two given RGB colors by simply calculating the distance between them: the shorter the distance, the higher the similarity.

25|$|Alternatively, the {{programmer}} may {{abandon the}} notion of representing the Life field with a 2-dimensional array, and use a different data structure, like a vector of coordinate pairs representing live cells. <b>This</b> <b>approach</b> <b>allows</b> the pattern to move about the field unhindered, {{as long as the}} population does not exceed the size of the live-coordinate array. The drawback is that counting live neighbours becomes a hash-table lookup or search operation, slowing down simulation speed. With more sophisticated data structures this problem can also be largely solved.|$|E

25|$|Another approach, which avoids typing or cutting-and-pasting into a {{resolver}} is {{to include}} the DOI in a document as a URL which uses the resolver as an HTTP proxy, such as http://doi.org/ (preferred) or http://dx.doi.org/, both of which support HTTPS. For example, the DOI 10.1000/182 can {{be included in a}} reference or hyperlink as https://doi.org/10.1000/182. <b>This</b> <b>approach</b> <b>allows</b> users to click on the DOI as a normal hyperlink. Indeed, as previously mentioned, this is how CrossRef recommends that DOIs always be represented (preferring HTTPS over HTTP), so that if they are cut-and-pasted into other documents, emails, etc., they will be actionable.|$|E
25|$|The models {{described}} {{on this page}} describe {{the evolution of a}} single site within a set of sequences. They are often used for analyzing the evolution of an entire locus by making the simplifying assumption that different sites evolve independently and are identically distributed. This assumption may be justifiable if the sites can be assumed to be evolving neutrally. If the primary effect of natural selection on the evolution of the sequences is to constrain some sites, then models of among-site rate-heterogeneity can be used. <b>This</b> <b>approach</b> <b>allows</b> one to estimate only one matrix of relative rates of substitution, and another set of parameters describing the variance in the total rate of substitution across sites.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the lines}} of {{difference}} in interpretation is whether to treat the regressors as random variables, or as predefined constants. In the first case (random design) the regressors xi are random and sampled together with the yis from some population, as in an observational study. <b>This</b> <b>approach</b> <b>allows</b> for more natural study of the asymptotic properties of the estimators. In the other interpretation (fixed design), the regressors X are treated as known constants set by a design, and y is sampled conditionally on the values of X as in an experiment. For practical purposes, this distinction is often unimportant, since estimation and inference is carried out while conditioning on X. All results stated {{in this article are}} within the random design framework.|$|E
25|$|An exergoeconomic {{assessment}} {{accounting for}} the total and non-renewable unit exergy costs and specific CO2 emissions of Brazilian electricity is performed by Flórez-Orrego et al. (2014), comprising thermal, nuclear, hydro, wind farms and biomass-fired power plants. The analysis starts from the fuel obtainment and continues through the different stages of construction, fuel transportation and processing, operation and decommissioning of the plant, with electricity generation as the desired output. <b>This</b> <b>approach</b> <b>allows</b> the calculation of direct CO2 emissions {{as well as the}} upstream and downstream emissions, which {{play an important role in}} some technologies. In this way, a better comparison between the utilization of different fuels in the electricity generation can be achieved. An iterative calculation procedure is used to determine the unit exergy costs of electricity and processed fuels, since both electricity and processed fuel are used in their own production routes.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists {{unveiled}} the , an online tool that estimates {{the full cost}} of electricity produced by three configurations of the nuclear fuel cycle. Two years in the making, this interactive calculator is the first generally accessible model to provide a nuanced look at the economic costs of nuclear power; it lets users test how sensitive the price of electricity is to a full range of components—more than 60 parameters that can be adjusted for the three configurations of the nuclear fuel cycle considered by this tool (once-through, limited-recycle, full-recycle). Users can select the fuel cycle they would like to examine, change cost estimates for each component of that cycle, and even choose uncertainty ranges for the cost of particular components. <b>This</b> <b>approach</b> <b>allows</b> users around the world to compare the cost of different nuclear power approaches in a sophisticated way, while taking account of prices relevant to their own countries or regions.|$|E

500|$|The {{phases of}} the inputs to each power {{combiner}} are arranged such that the two inputs are 90° out of phase with each other. [...] Since the coupled port of a hybrid combiner is 90° out of phase with the transmitted port, this causes the powers to add at {{the output of the}} combiner and to cancel at the isolated port: a representative example from figure 21 is shown in figure 22. [...] Note that there is an additional fixed 90° phase shift to both ports at each combiner/divider which is not shown in the diagrams for simplicity. [...] Applying in-phase power to both input ports would not get the desired result: the quadrature sum of the two inputs would appear at both output ports – that is half the total power out of each. [...] <b>This</b> <b>approach</b> <b>allows</b> the use of numerous less expensive and lower-power amplifiers in the circuitry instead of a single high-power TWT. [...] Yet another approach is to have each solid state amplifier (SSA) feed an antenna and let the power be combined in space or be used to feed a lens attached to an antenna.|$|E

2500|$|In Valve's early days, the company's {{structure}} {{was similar to}} other development firms; this was principally driven {{by the nature of}} physical game releases through publishers that required tasks to be completed by given deadlines, requiring a more regimented structure. As the company moved to digital releases where they serve as their own publisher, the company structure has become more as a flat organization. Valve published their employee handbook to the public in 2012, demonstrating at that time that outside of executive management, there were no bosses, and the company used an open allocation system, allowing employees to move between departments at will. <b>This</b> <b>approach</b> <b>allows</b> employees to work on whatever interests them, but requires them to take ownership of their product and mistakes they may make, according to Newell.

2500|$|Following twentieth-century {{developments}} in mathematical analysis and differential geometry, {{it became clear}} that the notion of the differential of a function could be extended in a variety of ways.

[...] This leads directly to the notion that the differential of a function at a point is a linear functional of an increment Δx. [...] <b>This</b> <b>approach</b> <b>allows</b> the differential (as a linear map) to be developed for a variety of more sophisticated spaces, ultimately giving rise to such notions as the Fréchet or Gâteaux derivative. [...] Likewise, in differential geometry, the differential of a function at a point is a linear function of a tangent vector (an [...] "infinitely small displacement"), which exhibits it as a kind of one-form: the exterior derivative of the function.
