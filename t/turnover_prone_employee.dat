We use data-sets from employers and from employees in the Dutch public and education sectors. Results show that shrinking employment indeed {{is associated with the}} experience of imbalance between efforts and rewards at work. Imbalance is negatively associated with health and work satisfaction. The association between shrinking employment and imbalance is less strong for risk <b>prone</b> <b>employees...</b>|$|R
40|$|Because of the {{outcomes}} associated with employee turnover, few {{areas have been}} researched as extensively {{in the field of}} Industrial/Organizational Psychology (Cotton&Tuttle, 1986). Correlates and consequences of employee turnover have been widely examined, though less expansive research has been dedicated to identifying (and potentially screening) <b>turnover</b> <b>prone</b> candidates. To address this concern, the comparative utility of three personality measures for predicting voluntary turnover in law enforcement was assessed. Self-report predictor measures consisted of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory- 2, the most widely used instrument in this industry, and the Personality Research Form-E. The implicit personality measure for this investigation was the Conditional Reasoning Test for Aggression (James, 1998). In line with previous research (e. g., Hough, 1998), self-report job applicant scores indicated a defensive or self-presentation bias, whereas the CRT-A did not. Normative and comparative data for all predictor measures are presented to further knowledge for the researcher and practitioner. The importance of context, in this case the influence of the economy on attrition rates, is also discussed. M. S. Committee Chair: Lawrence R.

5000|$|Spanoulis {{agreed to}} play for Houston, at a price of $1,944,000 USD gross income per season, for 3 years, passing up on his former team Panathinaikos Athens' much larger offer of €1.6 million euros net income per season, over 3 years, just for a chance of playing in the NBA. Spanoulis made the Rockets' rotation, but eventually, there was a falling out between him and Rockets coach Van Gundy, after Van Gundy benched Spanoulis, after the coach claimed that he had played poorly, citing that rookie players are {{dangerous}} for coaches that are in contract years, and that Spanoulis was too <b>turnover</b> <b>prone</b> and lacking in outside shooting touch {{to be a good}} fit in Van Gundy's offensive system design. Said Van Gundy about the situation: [...] "(Spanoulis) says, 'I was Tracy McGrady back home.' Great. McGrady is McGrady here," [...]. [...] "I feel badly for him. He feels he was misled. Frankly, he's been his own worst enemy in many ways. Some of it is excuses. His turnovers have been high; his fouls have been high; his shooting percentage has been low. I would rather anybody start out with self-evaluation — what can I do better? — versus lash out and blame. Because I'm not playing him now doesn't mean he won't play in the future or we don't feel he could be a good player. I think he's allowed his disappointment to go to discouragement, which has, at times, stunted his improvement. We'll see. We'll see." ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Although {{retention}} of employees has become hot topic in this career turbulent era, practically no empirical research {{is carried out}} in the fast growing ceramic sector till now and this research fills the gap in the literature. The literatures surveys reported that organization commitment is an important determinant of retention and work environment, supervisor support and training and development are the most relevant antecedents increasing commitment towards organization. This paper examines the impact of the above factors over organization commitment and explores the effects of organization commitment on retention, and verifies the mediating effect of organization commitment on the relationship between proposed factors and retention. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was completed by 416 employees working in five ceramic sanitary ware factories located at different places in India. Questionnaire consisting of items adopted from previous researches were used to collect data. The selection of respondents was based on the simple random sampling. Findings: Findings reveals that organization commitment influences retention and all the above factors enhances it. Moreover organization commitment partially mediates the relationship between proposed factors and retention. However multiple regression analysis indicated that training and development did not have any notable   influence on retention. Limitations: This study was conducted in a particular country and also in a particular sector of manufacturing industry, which limits generalization. Possibility of bias towards their organization and assumption that respondents know about their organization are other limitations. Implications: This paper offers recommendations to HR(Human resource) managers that they should extend their support to work environment, supervisor support and training and development in order to generate better relationship with employees and to reduce their likelihood of leaving the company. Originality/value: This article makes significant contribution to most <b>turnover</b> <b>prone</b> Indian environment, highlighting the important factors to be given priority for employee’s retention...|$|R

Construction of multi-storey buildings is at increase in the major cities where large and medium sized companies are working as main and sub-contractors; however these projects are suffering from fatal accidents, as safety measures are not rigorously enforced. This paper therefore presents a research framework to identify the safety climate factors which can significantly enhance the safety performance in the construction of multi-storey buildings. The quantitative data, split into calibration and validation sample, are being analyzed using exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis by examining the causal relationship between the safety climate and safety performance. Structured interviews and Delphi survey are being conducted to identify and prioritize; the causes of accidents, the impediments in the safety implementation, and the strategies to enhance the safety performance. The qualitative findings about neglected safety aspects are also discussed.

40|$|The German {{pension reform}} of 2001 was a {{milestone}} {{on the road}} towards pension individualisation. It enhanced the funded occupational (and private) pension system (Riester-pensions), and therefore shifted investment risks to employers and individuals. The new occupational scheme allows for different types of pension vehicles that are either defined benefit (DB) or defined contribution (DC) plans. Since all such schemes are embedded in multiple layers of institutional insurance mechanisms, including strict investment principles, even the riskier DC schemes have limited exposure to financial market volatility. This article explores the extent of risk individualisation in Riester-occupational pensions by describing risk distribution between the employee and the employer. It starts with discussing the relevant legislation since the nineteenth century until the reform of 2001. The reform defined two main risk-related decisions which are analysed here. The first, {{the selection of the}} pension vehicle, determines the scope of the risk. The second is the choice between DB and German DC that defines the distribution of risk between the employer and the employee. Finally, the paper investigates these choices empirically by using a unique, proprietary data-set of a German pension provider with approximately 271, 000 pension scheme enrolees joining in the years between 2002 and 2008. The findings highlight the employer’s pivotal role in determining the options available to the employee. For this reason, employee’s choice is limited and could partly be explained by socio-economic variables traditionally associated with risk aversion. Furthermore, despite the low level of risk embedded in Riester-type occupational pensions, individuals prefer the low risk alternatives. The study also identifies a conscious, risk <b>prone</b> group of <b>employees</b> who joined the savings plan right after the reform, in 2002 and 2003. Enrolees of the latter years are more likely to prefer insurance over uncertain returns, and reject the idea of risk individualisation...|$|R
40|$|Employee {{turnover}} {{can cost}} an organization {{a significant amount}} of money. In addition, retention of employees can beneficial towards to an organization as it e. g. allows to save costs related torecruitment and training of new employees. The fast food industry is recognized as an industry which employs low-skilled employees and is especially in the United States known to be <b>prone</b> to high <b>employee</b> <b>turnover.</b> With regards to Europe, only little information is available in the field of low-skilled employee retention in the fast food industry. Looking towards the Netherlands, there has been no conducted research concerning this topic from a manager’s perspective allowing to identify the best HR practices to limit employee turnover in the organization. Our purpose of this thesis is to increase the understanding of the practices on employee retention of low-skilled employees in the Dutch fast food industry. To be able to meet this purpose, the following research question was developed “How do managers address retention of low-skilled employees in the Dutch fast food industry?” To be able to answer this research question, a multiple case study was conducted to study several franchises of the Dutch fast food organization “Verhage fast food”. We chose to conduct a qualitative study by developing semi-structured interviews. The empirical material was collected by interviewing an HR manager and the CEO of Verhage to develop an overview of the organization. Furthermore, we conducted five interviews with franchisees of Verhage. These franchisees were chosen based on four criteria being location, variety in experience, amount of employees, and amount of franchises owned. These four criteria ensured that the chosen franchisees in our study are active in different environmental settings. These interviews were conducted with the aim to find out how these franchisees perceive low-skilled employee retention and to identify how these franchisees address retention through the implementation of HR practices. Our study provided a contribution that shows the most effective HR practices in the fields of recruitment and selection, training and development, career development, and recognition and rewards are depending on the situational factors. Whereas one franchisee needs to pay well above minimum wage to attract low-skilled employees, another franchisee can easily pay the employees minimum wages without the need to worry for job applicants. Another contribution based on the outcome of our study is that the provision of training and responsibilities besides being done to benefit the company in e. g. productivity it also results in more engaging employees with a higher intention to stay...|$|R
