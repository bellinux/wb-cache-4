500|$|I'm {{always going}} {{to fall back on}} 'we were ahead of our time,' because it's easy. The biggest thing we did was an all or nothing {{proposal}} from an entertainment point of view. It's not like you can start up a new TV network and give one show a month and expect it to be successful... We couldn't quite pull that off with <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>we</b> had." ...|$|E
500|$|On 21 September 2012 it was {{announced}} that financing for the Jeddah Tower was complete. Talal Al Maiman, chief executive officer and managing director of Kingdom Real Estate Development Co. said in an interview [...] "We have all the investors, all the finance, all <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>we</b> need," [...] Al Maiman said. [...] "It took us beyond 20 months to convince investors, working every detail and aspect of financing." ...|$|E

500|$|A triple album, The Concert for Bangladesh, was {{released}} by Apple Corps that year, followed by a concert film in 1972. Tax troubles and questionable expenses later tied up many of the proceeds, but Harrison commented: [...] "Mainly the concert was to attract attention to the situation... <b>The</b> <b>money</b> <b>we</b> raised was secondary, and although we had some money problems... they still got plenty... {{even though it was}} a drop in the ocean. The main thing was, we spread the word and helped get the war ended." [...] The event has been described as an innovative precursor for the large-scale charity rock shows that followed, including Live Aid.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{acknowledging}} {{the possibility that}} humans may be partially responsible for climate change, Johnson rejects government action to control or limit it - including cap and trade - as ineffective. [...] "When {{you look at the}} amount of money we are looking to spend on global warming — in the trillions — and look at the result, I just argue that the result is completely inconsequential to <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>we</b> would end up spending," [...] he said. [...] "We can direct those moneys to other ways that would be much more beneficial to mankind." [...] Johnson has signed the Western Governors' Association resolution, which aims at [...] "collaborative, incentive driven, locally-based solutions," [...] and has advocated for free market solutions to environmental problems. He has stated that he will not [...] "compromise when it comes to clean air, clean land, or clean water." [...] Johnson supports nuclear energy and fossil fuels, but has stated that the government has a role to protect Americans against businesses that would harm human health or property, including environmental harm.|$|E
500|$|... "There's Something About Marrying" [...] {{was written}} by co-executive {{producer}} J. Stewart Burns and directed by Nancy Kruse {{as part of the}} sixteenth season of The Simpsons. Work on the episode started in March 2004, after the 2004 San Francisco same-sex weddings, a period during February 2004 when the city was issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. This served as the Simpsons staff's inspiration for [...] "There's Something About Marrying". The plot point where Springfield tries to increase tourism by marketing towards the LGBT community also had a basis in reality. An example is Fort Lauderdale, which became a popular tourist destination for gays and lesbians in the mid-2000s. Executive producer Al Jean said they were interested in doing the episode because they could explore the various characters' different positions on gay marriage while remaining neutral. [...] "Lisa thinks it's good for civil rights. The reverend of the local Protestant church is opposed to it. Other people think tourists will come to town. Mayor Quimby wants <b>the</b> <b>money.</b> <b>We</b> don't take a position as much as explore everybody's positions," [...] he commented.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Certainly you did,' {{returned}} David, warmly, 'but that's not the idea. Who said, that if <b>we</b> put <b>the</b> <b>money</b> together <b>we</b> could furnish an office, {{and make}} a show?' ...|$|R

2500|$|... "We {{could get}} <b>the</b> <b>money.</b> ... <b>We</b> didn't need to launder money—ever." [...] But [...] "the end result {{would have been}} the end of the agency. Not only would I have gone to jail if I had gone along with what the White House wanted us to do, but the agency's {{credibility}} would have been ruined forever." ...|$|E
2500|$|Andy Ramos, {{a member}} of the City Council when Tatangelo became mayor and later the Webb County {{administrative}} judge, recalled how Tatangelo [...] "wanted everything done today. ... He was always asking the city council for support in getting projects done as fast as we could with <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>we</b> had available. He was very compassionate, and his heart was with the people of Laredo, especially those who were economically disadvantaged." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006 Kilbey {{said of the}} recording, [...] "It's {{actually}} flat lifeless 'n' and sterile. Great song, sure, but the performance, {{the sounds}} are ordinary. We coulda got that in Australia {{in a week or}} two for a 20th of <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>we</b> spent. Hey, it's sold almost a million in the US alone, but we'll never see any money 'cause it cost so much to make". Kilbey's assessment ignored its second life as a much-licensed track. In December 2011, he told News Limited reporter, Cameron Adams: ...|$|E
40|$|The "money's worth " measure {{has been}} used to assess whether annuities are fairly valued and also as {{evidence}} for adverse selection in the annuity market. However, a regulated life assurer with concerns about predicting long-run mortality may price annuities to reduce these risks which will affect <b>the</b> <b>money’s</b> worth. <b>We</b> provide a simple model of the effect of cohort mortality risk on <b>the</b> <b>money’s</b> worth. <b>We</b> demonstrate that cohort mortality risk is quantitatively important, and show that {{it is not possible to}} identify the effect of a cohort mortality risk model from that of an adverse selection model...|$|R

6000|$|... "True, my love," [...] said he, now again {{quite happy}} and {{at ease in}} his manner. [...] "What good to us is this place or all <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> if <b>we</b> are to be ill-spoken of?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Jed's death deeply {{affected}} Kesey, {{who later}} called Jed {{a victim of}} policies that had starved the team of funding. [...] He wrote to Senator Mark Hatfield, [...] "And I began to get mad, Senator. I had finally found where the blame must be laid: that <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>we</b> are spending for national defense is not defending us from the villains real and near, the awful villains of ignorance, and cancer, and heart disease and highway death. How many school buses could be outfitted with seatbelts with the money spent {{for one of those}} 16-inch shells?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite public attacks {{about his}} {{financial}} status, after {{meeting at the}} National Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas, Nevada in April 2001, it was Hammer (credited as a producer) who provided the much needed funding to filmmaker Justin Lin for Better Luck Tomorrow (2002). In its first ever film acquisition, MTV Films eventually acquired Better Luck Tomorrow after it debuted at The Sundance Film Festival. The director said, [...] "Out of desperation, I called up MC Hammer because he had read the script and liked it. Two hours later, he wired <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>we</b> needed into a bank account and saved us." ...|$|E
2500|$|PepsiCo {{replaced}} DLF Ltd as {{the title}} sponsor starting with the 2013 season. DLF did not renew their contract after their initial five-year contract, for [...] 2.50billion, ended with the previous season. PepsiCo's contract is [...] 3968million for five years, ending with the 2017 season. In response to questions about the higher sponsorship costs compared to DLF's, a representative of PepsiCo said, [...] "Our estimate {{is that we will}} get five to six times the value of <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>we</b> paid." [...] However, Brand Finance had assessed the IPL's brand value to have fallen from $4.1 billion in 2010 to $2.9 billion in 2012, attributed to the decline in television ratings over the two years.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't borrow for less. However, if <b>we</b> use <b>the</b> <b>money</b> judiciously, <b>we</b> {{ought to}} get {{something}} back by higher rents. Lang and Grey, for example, would {{pay a little more}} for the improvements they require." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{need the}} {{services}} of just such an unscrupulous and clever individual as you have proven yourself to be. I'm willing to pay liberally for those services, and you doubtless need <b>the</b> <b>money.</b> Are <b>we</b> allies, then?" ...|$|R

If you don't give up...you can lead your boy blind the rest of your days." ...|$|R
2500|$|On 24 January 2006, it was {{announced}} that the band had reformed and signed a record deal with Parlophone. They subsequently began work on their third studio album, Studio 1. The first single, [...] "Rock Steady" [...] (released in November 2006), reached number three on the UK Singles Chart. Studio 1 entered the albums chart at number forty and sold 60,000 copies according to the BPI, being certified silver. A second single, [...] "Chick Fit" [...] failed to reach the top 200. Blatt discussed the reunion's failure in an interview with i-D magazine in 2012: [...] "I don't think it was done for the right reasons... I know that I did it for <b>the</b> <b>money.</b> <b>We</b> got signed before we had even made music again, it wasn't like we felt we had something to give back to the world... we were given an opportunity and took it, without really thinking about it too hard". She also said she never felt comfortable with the success the band had and that [...] "it was not necessarily the plan at the beginning; {{there was a lot of}} compromise involved".|$|E
2500|$|William Otterburn-Hall {{describes}} the men as close around the star [...] "like a football scrum after a loose ball." [...] He relates {{that they were}} a [...] "friendly bunch" [...] who, when Elvis began to sing just for fun during his interview, followed [...] "suit, singing, clowning, all on their feet". According to Patrick Humphries, they [...] "acted as Elvis' bodyguards, babysitters, drug procurers, girl-getters, mates and car buyers." [...] The author also mentions other functions of the guys: [...] "various members of the Memphis Mafia had ... played vital roles in keeping Elvis' numerous dirty secrets out of the public eye. A couple of them had been arrested with false prescriptions attempting to collect drugs for Elvis, quite a few had taken physical hits in the service of protecting Elvis and none were paid more than $500 a week. For that they were often shouted at, abused and belittled by the King when he felt like it." [...] noted Buzz Cason. Marty Lacker states, [...] "Everyone had assigned responsibilities and they were far from leeches, hangers on or whatever else they were called." [...] "They all had jobs to do so that Elvis could do his and as far as being there for the money, that's laughable because there really wasn't much in that area to be there for." [...] Marty went on to say, [...] "Most of us were not there for <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> <b>we</b> were there because we all cared about Elvis and each other like brothers." ...|$|E

6000|$|The adventuress dresses magnificently. Where {{she gets}} <b>the</b> <b>money</b> from <b>we</b> never could understand, for {{she and her}} companions are always more or less {{complaining}} of being [...] "stone broke." [...] Dressmakers must be a trusting people where she comes from.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish I {{could think}} {{it were not}} so. I have thought {{sometimes}} that it was this very pride, turning suddenly to madness, which drove him to it. You have heard how he returned <b>the</b> <b>money</b> which <b>we</b> had lost?" ...|$|R

5000|$|... "Every {{time one}} of the Flames left, it was on account of money. (Brown) didn't want to pay <b>the</b> <b>money</b> that was {{supposed}} to be paid to us.
