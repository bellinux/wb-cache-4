500|$|Westenra {{has been}} known as a vegetarian/pescetarian. In 2007, she was {{nominated}} for PETA's 'Sexiest Vegetarian'. However, when touring she sometimes has worried about getting the appropriate amounts of nutrients. She was sometimes unable to obtain the more nutritious vegetables and other foods she preferred, and now on occasions she eats meat. In 2007, Westenra told The New Zealand Herald, [...] "I'm completely bursting the bubble now, aren't I? <b>That's</b> <b>that</b> ruined." ...|$|E
500|$|Whereas Radiohead {{developed}} In Rainbows {{from their}} live performances, The King of Limbs was developed from studio experimentation. After Godrich and Yorke had {{become interested in}} DJing during their time in Los Angeles, Godrich proposed [...] "an experiment for two weeks where everyone has a turntable instead of playing the guitar or drums or whatever. And that two-week experiment ended up being fucking six months. And <b>that’s</b> <b>that</b> record, {{the whole story of}} all of it." [...] Much of the album is constructed from samples of drum, bass and guitar parts which were looped, manipulated and edited with turntables and vinyl emulation software. The band also used sampling software written by Greenwood, which he described as a [...] "wonky, rubbish version" [...] of Ableton Live.|$|E
500|$|Rapper Snoop Dogg, {{who had a}} {{significant}} role on the album, was praised for his lyrics and flow, and it was mentioned that [...] "Coupled with his inventive rhymes, Snoop's distinctive style made him a superstar before he'd even released a recording of his own" [...] and that his involvement was {{as important to the}} album's success as its production. Touré of The New York Times remarks that [...] "While Snoop delivers rhymes delicately, the content is anything but. Growing up poor, often surrounded by violence, and having served six months in the Wayside County jail outside of Los Angeles (for cocaine possession) gave Snoop Dogg experiences upon which he draws." [...] Snoop Dogg later commented on the [...] "reality" [...] of his lyrics, stating [...] "My raps are incidents where either I saw it happen to one of my close homies or I know about it from just being in the ghetto. I can't rap about something I don't know. You'll never hear me rapping about no bachelor's degree. It's only what I know and <b>that's</b> <b>that</b> street life. It's all everyday life, reality." ...|$|E

500|$|Gangsta rap {{has been}} criticized for its extreme lyrics, which are often accused of glamorizing gang {{violence}} and black-on-black crime. The Gangsta rappers responded that they were simply describing the realities of life in places such as Compton, California, and Long Beach, California. Describing Doggystyle in 1993, Snoop Doggy Dogg likewise points to the album's realism, {{and the extent to which}} it is based on his personal experience. [...] He said, [...] "I can't rap about something I don't know. You'll never hear me rapping about no bachelor's degree. It's only what I know and <b>that's</b> <b>that</b> street life. It's all everyday life, reality." [...] Explaining his intentions, Snoop Doggy Dogg claims he feels he is a role model to many young black men, and that his songs are designed to relate to their concerns. [...] "For little kids growing up in the ghettos," [...] he said, [...] "it's easy to get into the wrong types of things, especially gangbanging and selling drugs. I've seen what that was like, and I don't glorify it, but I don't preach. I bring it to them rather than have them go find out about it for themselves." [...] He further explained the [...] "dream" [...] that he would pursue after making the album: [...] "I'm going to try to eliminate the gang violence. I'll be on a mission for peace. I know I have a lot of power. I know if I say, 'Don't kill', niggas won't kill".|$|E

2500|$|Keaton {{also had}} a {{relationship}} with her The Godfather Trilogy costar Al Pacino. Their on-again, off-again relationship ended following the filming of The Godfather Part III. Keaton said of Pacino, [...] "Al was simply the most entertaining man... To me, <b>that's,</b> <b>that</b> is the most beautiful face. I think Warren was gorgeous, very pretty, but Al's face is like whoa. Killer, killer face." ...|$|E

2500|$|His {{style has}} been noted for its unique instrumentation, {{utilizing}} {{a vast array of}} ethnic instruments, recorded sounds, synthetic textures, and the traditional orchestra, often concurrently. [...] When asked about his inclination for embracing new techniques and constantly shifting his musical palette throughout his career, Goldsmith said, [...] "It seems like it's me, and <b>that's</b> <b>that!</b> [...] Certain composers are doing {{the same thing over and}} over again, which I feel is sort of uninteresting. [...] I don't find that you grow very much in that way. [...] I like to keep changing, trying to do new things. [...] Basically, I'm saying the same thing with a little different twist on it. Once you get caught up in the creative process, something inside takes over, and your subconscious just does it for you." ...|$|E
2500|$|I've {{given up}} {{speaking}} to them. I've said basically everything that possibly {{can be said}} to this bunch. I'm basically leaving it up to them now. They are going to show me if they really want to play for Australia and whether they really want to play under me. I'll find out over the next three games and my decision will be made as to my future as a captain and a player after that... I don't think it's my captaincy... but if we continue to lose, you've just got to start saying: [...] "Right, someone else has to come in and see if they can do something different." [...] It just gets as simple as that. That's the way I see it. The fellows are not responding to me and <b>that's</b> <b>that.</b> I'll find out over the next three games if that's the case or not.|$|E
