5|$|These {{muscles are}} {{involved}} in moving and manipulating the <b>tongue.</b> The left and right genioglossus muscles in particular are responsible for protruding the <b>tongue.</b> The muscles, attached to {{the underside of the}} top and back parts of the <b>tongue,</b> cause the <b>tongue</b> to protrude and deviate towards the opposite side. The hypoglossal nerve also supplies movements including clearing the mouth of saliva and other involuntary activities. The hypoglossal nucleus interacts with the reticular formation, involved in the control of several reflexive or automatic motions, and several corticonuclear originating fibers supply innervation aiding in unconscious movements relating to speech and articulation.|$|E

Replacing Binger Hermann, <b>Tongue</b> won {{by a total of}} 63 votes over his opponents. He was re-elected three times and served in the 56th and 57th United States Congresses. <b>Tongue</b> also won {{re-election}} in 1902 to the 58th Congress, but died before that session began. In the 1898 campaign he defeated three opponents led by Fusion Party candidate Robert M. Veatch, winning by 2,037 votes over Veatch. <b>Tongue</b> won by 3,100 votes in 1900 and by 7,318 votes in the 1902 campaign.|$|E

5000|$|Although Calvary Chapel {{believes}} in the continuing efficacy of the gift of <b>tongues,</b> it does not recognize uninterpreted <b>tongues</b> spoken in a congregational setting as necessarily inspired (or at least directed) by the Holy Spirit because of its understanding of [...] Calvary Chapel accepts that the Bible affirms interpreted <b>tongues</b> and modern prophecy.

5|$|A {{specimen}} of Pinacosaurus preserves large paraglossalia (triangular bones or cartilages {{located in the}} <b>tongue)</b> which show signs of muscular stress, and it is {{thought this was a}} common feature of ankylosaurs. The researchers who examined the specimen suggested that ankylosaurs relied heavily on muscular tongues and hyobranchia (<b>tongue</b> bones) when feeding, since their teeth were fairly small and were replaced at a relatively slow rate. Some modern salamanders have similar <b>tongue</b> bones, and use prehensile tongues to pick up food. Based on the broadness of the ribcage, Ankylosaurus may have digested through a hindgut fermentation system like modern herbivorous lizards, which have several chambers in their enlarged colon.|$|E
5|$|Down {{the middle}} of the sublingua is a thick {{strengthening}} rod called the plica mediana or lytta, which connects the sublingua to the underside of the <b>tongue,</b> and is part of the lingual septum (septum of the <b>tongue).</b> The thickness and size of the plica mediana can vary between species, and except in treeshrews, it is cartilaginous and provides support for the sublingua.|$|E
5|$|Since cats lack lips {{to create}} suction, {{they use a}} lapping method with the <b>tongue</b> to draw liquid upwards into their mouths. Lapping {{at a rate of}} four times a second, the cat touches the smooth tip of its <b>tongue</b> {{to the surface of the}} water, and quickly retracts it, drawing water upwards.|$|E
5000|$|Direction. The New Testament {{describes}} <b>tongues</b> {{largely as}} speech addressed to God, {{but also as}} something that can potentially be interpreted into human language, thereby [...] "edifying the hearers" [...] (1 Cor 14:5,13). At Pentecost and Caesarea the speakers were praising God (Acts 2:11; 10:46). Paul referred to praying, singing praise, and giving thanks in <b>tongues</b> (1 Cor 14:14-17), {{as well as to}} the interpretation of <b>tongues</b> (1 Cor 14:5), and instructed those speaking in <b>tongues</b> to pray for the ability to interpret their <b>tongues</b> so others could understand them (1 Cor 14:13). While some limit speaking in <b>tongues</b> to speech addressed to God - [...] "prayer or praise", others claim that speech in <b>tongues</b> is revelation from God to the church, and when interpreted into human language by those embued with the gift of interpretation of <b>tongues</b> for the benefit of others present, may be considered equivalent to prophecy.|$|R

5|$|Some speech sounds, both vowels and consonants, involve {{release of}} air {{flow through the}} nasal cavity, and these are called nasals or nasalized sounds. Other sounds are defined {{by the way the}} <b>tongue</b> moves within the mouth: such as the l-sounds (called laterals, because the air flows along both sides of the <b>tongue),</b> and the r-sounds (called rhotics) that are {{characterized}} by how the <b>tongue</b> is positioned relative to the air stream.|$|E
5|$|The Elves of the Third Clan, or Teleri, {{who reached}} Eldamar {{later than the}} Noldor and the Vanyar, spoke a {{different}} but closely related <b>tongue,</b> usually called Telerin. It was seen by some Elves to be just another dialect of Quenya. This {{was not the case}} with the Teleri for whom their <b>tongue</b> was distinct from Quenya. After the Vanyar left the city of TÃºna, Telerin and Noldorin Quenya grew closer.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypoglossal}} nerve is the twelfth cranial nerve, and innervates all the extrinsic and intrinsic {{muscles of the}} <b>tongue,</b> except for the palatoglossus which is innervated by the vagus nerve. It is a nerve with a solely motor function. The nerve arises from the hypoglossal nucleus in the brain stem {{as a number of}} small rootlets, passes through the hypoglossal canal and down through the neck, and eventually passes up again over the <b>tongue</b> muscles it supplies into the <b>tongue.</b> There are two {{hypoglossal nerve}}s in the body: one on the left, and one on the right.|$|E

50|$|The muscles {{parallel}} to the long axis are arranged in longitudinal bundles. The more peripherally these are located, the more elaborate bending movements are possible. A more peripheral distribution is found in mammalian <b>tongues,</b> octopus arms, nautilus tentacles, and elephant proboscides. <b>Tongues</b> that are adapted for protrusion typically have centrally located longitudinal fibers. These are found in snake <b>tongues,</b> many lizard <b>tongues,</b> and the mammalian anteaters.|$|R
50|$|Scriptures {{quoted by}} the Revival Fellowship {{to justify its}} {{position}} on salvation include Acts 2 (particularly the first few verses, which record speaking in <b>tongues</b> {{on the day of}} Pentecost, and Acts 2:38, which is included in the group's logo), Mark 16:15-20, Acts 10:44-48, Acts 19:1-6 and John 3:1-21 (particularly verses 1-9). Their doctrine regarding speaking in <b>tongues</b> emphasises glossolalia <b>tongues</b> (an unintelligible language; e.g. Acts 10:46) over xenolalia <b>tongues</b> (a foreign language; e.g. Acts 2:8); there is no official doctrinal stance on when this transition between known and unknown <b>tongues</b> should have occurred.|$|R
5|$|The {{rootlets}} of the {{hypoglossal nerve}} {{arise from the}} hypoglossal nucleus {{near the bottom of}} the brain stem. The hypoglossal nucleus receives input from both the motor cortices but the contralateral input is dominant; innervation of the <b>tongue</b> is essentially lateralized. Signals from muscle spindles on the <b>tongue</b> travel through the hypoglossal nerve, moving onto the lingual nerve which synapses on the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus.|$|E
5|$|The {{tip of the}} <b>tongue</b> {{probably}} acts as a {{suction cup}} and during lapping, nectar may be drawn up the proboscis by capillary action. When at rest or flying, the proboscis is kept folded under the head. The longer the <b>tongue,</b> the deeper the bumblebee can probe into a flower and bees probably learn by experience which flower source is best-suited to their <b>tongue</b> length. Bees with shorter proboscides, like Bombus bifarius, have a more difficult time foraging nectar relative to other bumblebees with longer proboscides; to overcome this disadvantage, B. bifarius workers were observed to lick the back of spurs on the nectar duct, {{which resulted in a}} small reward.|$|E
