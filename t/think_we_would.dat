What I {{was trying to say}} is that if more organizations in this country, including religious groups, were more outspoken against war, then I do not <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> be pursuing war as an option." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite her {{generally}} leftist views, Barr voiced {{her support}} for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump in a June 2016 The Hollywood Reporter interview. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> {{be so lucky}} if Trump won. Because then it wouldn't be Hillary." [...] A July CNN story reported {{that she did not}} endorse Trump as she only supports herself for president -- [...] "I will be writing myself in in every election from now until I win."

We're proud of 'Alright' {{and how well}} it did, but we never {{wanted to find a}} formula and stick to it. Our aim was always to progress and keep the music interesting, for us and for the fans. So the people who see us in the street and still shout 'We are young' may not like the new album, but fans who have grown up with us and know to expect change probably will." ...|$|E

40|$|The author <b>thinks</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> not {{tolerate}} {{this sort of}} regulation in any context other than telecommunications; the First Amendment would forbid it. But somehow telecommunications speech is different and permits, many think, a different First Amendment regime. The author seeks here to raise questions about this assumption through {{an exploration of the}} justifications generally offered to support this different First Amendment regime for telecommunications speech. After exploring those justifications, the author will offer some alternative strategies for reforming telecommunications regulation in a manner which both eliminates present intrusion into protected speech and forwards the First Amendment interest of diversity of ideas...|$|R

I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> have {{expected}} a lot of drama, and the truth is, she is probably the most down-to-earth person. It was endearing. She was friendly and kind. ... I think, for us, we're so excited to have someone of her talent, and to have somebody like that shoot here is a sheer honor. What her music does for music is so much more than entertainment. It's connecting to the arts on a much deeper level, and that's what I hope we can do here." ...|$|E
500|$|Armagh manager Joe Kernan {{claimed he}} would have {{resigned}} had his side won but defeat encouraged him to continue. He lauded his players for their effort nonetheless, saying: [...] "..we've won an All-Ireland, and {{got back to the}} final. I think that's a phenomenal achievement." [...] He added that he was confident Armagh would win another title in the future. Of the match itself, Kernan said: [...] "I think if Steven McDonnell had got that goal towards the end, even with the man down I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> have won the game. Big matches hinge on certain things {{and that was one of}} them." [...] McDonnell applauded Conor Gormley's tackle which prevented him from scoring: [...] "...I'd say it was one of the best tackles ever." ...|$|E
500|$|The ensuing feud between Conrad and Montag {{received}} extensive {{media attention}} since its beginning; Conrad was doubtful {{of the possibility}} of a reconciliation, noting that [...] "I can see us getting to not hating each other but I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> ever go back to being best friends." [...] When addressing speculation that the conflict was fabricated for television, Conrad stated that [...] "I wouldn't fight for the camera. If anything I would try not to." [...] In a separate interview, she revealed that she almost quit the program before the season began, stating [...] "it wasn't so much about the filming, but I didn't want to do a show with the other people on it", which was assumed to be alluding to Montag and Pratt.|$|E

500|$|England {{experienced}} {{another surprise}} upset under Winterbottom's guidance in 1953 when Hungary defeated England 6–3 at Wembley Stadium. [...] Winterbottom said afterwards, [...] "...The press tended to <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> win easily, but I tried {{to point out}} that the Hungarians were actually a great side." [...] He guided England to first place in the 1954 British Home Championship, which qualified the team for the 1954 World Cup in Switzerland, but saw his side knocked out in the quarter-finals, going down 4–2 against Uruguay. Four wins from four matches enabled England's qualification for the 1958 World Cup only for Winterbottom's side to fail in the group play-off stage, losing 1–0 to USSR. [...] England lost to Brazil in the quarter-final of the 1962 World Cup in Chile and, under attack from the British press, Winterbottom resigned five months later. [...] He remains the longest serving manager of England.|$|E
500|$|In 1970, Tarkenton's fourth {{with the}} Giants, New York showed marked improvement, fielding their most {{competitive}} team since 1963. After an 0–3 start the Giants won 9 {{out of their}} next 10, [...] and went into their season finale against the Los Angeles Rams {{with a chance to}} win the NFC East Division. Though New York took an early 3–0 lead, the Rams scored the next 31 points, dashing the Giants hopes and leaving them out of the playoffs. Tarkenton had his best season as a Giant in 1970 and made the Pro Bowl. Much of the team's success was credited to him. Teammate Fred Dryer later commented, [...] "ithout Tarkenton, I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> have won any games." [...] Running back Ron Johnson also made the Pro Bowl and ran for 1,027yards, becoming the first Giant ever to gain 1,000yards rushing in a season, and Webster was named NFL Coach of the Year. Meanwhile, the Jets, much as the Giants had in 1964, fell apart, dropping to a 4–10 record after several consecutive seasons of success, with Namath breaking his wrist in a Super Bowl III rematch with the Baltimore Colts and missing the final eight games.|$|E

[...] During the 2006 Lebanon War, McCain said, regarding Israel's role in the conflict with Lebanon and Hezbollah, [...] "What would we do if somebody came across our borders and killed our soldiers and captured our soldiers?

[...] "We need more women leaders. Women tend to see the whole picture. For society to advance, we need more women in public service at all levels – local to global. They bring an unique perspective often missing in global challenges," [...] Elbegdorj said [...] "Have you ever heard of a woman bloody dictator or tyrant? I think not.

2500|$|A {{documentary}} titled Lockerbie Revisited {{aired on}} 27 April 2009, {{in which the}} film's director and narrator, Gideon Levy, interviewed officials involved with the case. Former FBI Laboratory scientist Fred Whitehurst described the FBI laboratory itself as a [...] "crime scene," [...] where an unqualified colleague Thomas Thurman would routinely alter his scientific reports. The interviews also revealed that the timer fragment had never been tested for explosives residue due to [...] "budgetary reasons." [...] Thurman, who led the forensic investigation and identified the fragment's Libyan connection, confirmed {{that it was the}} [...] "only real piece of evidence against Libya". When asked {{about the importance of the}} timer in the conviction of al-Megrahi, FBI Task Force Chief Richard Marquise stated, [...] "It would be a very difficult case to prove ... I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> ever (have) had an indictment".|$|E
2500|$|Webber caused {{controversy}} with {{a series}} of comments about Eurovision in a Radio Times interview. He said: [...] "I don't think there's any point in beating around the bush. I saw no black faces on the programme Eurovision 2012. I was questioned by the press over Jade Ewen's race, and I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> have placed second, but there is a problem when you go further east. If you're talking about Western Europe it's fine, but Ukraine, not so good." [...] The EBU corrected Webber, telling him Ukraine's singer Gaitana was black, that year's winner Loreen for Sweden was of North African background and accompanied by a black backing dancer, and France's contestant Anggun was Indonesian. The contest organisers also told Webber that black singer Dave Benton won for Estonia in 2001. The EBU thoroughly denied racism in its show, and insisted it unites Europe for three nights in a year.|$|E

2500|$|Piquet Jr. was criticised {{by many in}} the {{community}} and some suggest that the controversy effectively ended his hopes of continuing in F1. BBC F1 commentator Martin Brundle suggested that Piquet Jr. was now unemployable in Formula One, saying that no team or sponsor would want {{to be associated with the}} Piquet family. Brundle noted that Piquet Jr. [...] "didn't deliver at Renault, he wasn't fast enough, that's why he was released and that's why he has dropped hand grenades into the system ever since". Brundle was also highly critical that Piquet Jr. escaped sanction from the FIA despite admitting to race-fixing, while the others involved were heavily punished. Other leading F1 figures have echoed Brundle's sentiments. Toyota team principal John Howett was quoted as saying, [...] "I think on his performance...disregarding the issue, I probably would not give him a drive and I would probably be further influenced in that decision by what took place." [...] Christian Horner, team principal of Red Bull Racing, has added, [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> have any interest [...] at Red Bull Racing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Now {{continuing}} their {{career as a}} trio, with Ihsahn handling keyboards, vocals, guitars and bass, the band recorded their third album IX Equilibrium and toured Europe and North America. It was around 2000 when Samoth and Trym started to gravitate more towards death metal, while Ihsahn directed his musical exploration towards his side project, Peccatum. Thus, in 2001, Emperor decided to disband after releasing one final album, , composed entirely by Ihsahn. [...] Ihsahn later recalled that [...] "When we announced the split up in 2001, we didn't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> do anything more with Emperor ever again...The decision was also based on the feeling that Emperor {{had a lot of}} integrity, and that {{if we were going to}} end it, we should end it while we still created great music. [...] For us, the decision was made in the black metal spirit. Since Samoth and I pulled in different directions, we didn't see any point in continuing. [...] The core of the band wasn't intact anymore". Samoth echoed Ihsahn's position: [...] "At that point, we both had other priorities that we wanted to pursue and we both felt that splitting up Emperor was the best thing to do. [...] We really wanted to focus on other things, and felt it was the only right thing to do".|$|E

500|$|While {{opening the}} Victorian Returned Services League Conference {{shortly before his}} {{retirement}} as Lieutenant Governor, Herring criticised anti-war protesters and praised Australian soldiers who {{had served in the}} Vietnam War.
