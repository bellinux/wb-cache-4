Faith, {{a little}} would make me, I {{could find in}} my heart, {{if it were not}} for one thing, I have a good mind, if I had not {{something}} else to do, I would answer your dear saucy letter. O, Lord, I am going awry with writing in bed. O, faith, but I must answer it, or I shan't have room, for it must go on Saturday; and don't think I will fill the third side, I an't come to that yet, young women. Well then, as for your Bernage, I have said enough: I writ to him last week.--Turn over that leaf. Now, what says MD to the world to come? I tell you, Madam Stella, my head is a great deal better, and I hope will keep so. How came yours to be fifteen days coming, and you had my fifteenth in seven? Answer me that, rogues. Your being with Goody Walls is excuse enough: I find I was mistaken in the sex, 'tis a boy.(12) Yes, I understand your cypher, and Stella guesses right, as she always does. He(13) gave me al bsadnuk lboinlpl dfaonr ufainf btoy dpionufnad,(14) which I sent him again by Mr. Lewis, to whom I writ a very complaining letter <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>showed</b> him; and so the matter ended. He told me he had a quarrel with me; I said I had another with him, and we returned to our friendship, and I should think he loves me as well as a great Minister can love a man in so short a time. Did not I do right? I am glad at heart you have got your palsy-water;(15) pray God Almighty it may do my dearest little Stella good! I suppose Mrs. Edgworth set out last Monday se'ennight. Yes, I do read the Examiners, and they are written very finely, as you judge. I do not think they are too severe on the Duke;(16) they only tax him of avarice, and his avarice has ruined us. You may count upon all things in them to be true. The author has said it is not Prior, but perhaps it may be Atterbury.--Now, Madam Dingley, says she, 'tis fine weather, says she; yes, says she, and we have got to our new lodgings. I compute you ought to save eight pounds by being in the others five months; and you have no more done it than eight thousand. I am glad you are rid of that squinting, blinking Frenchman. I will give you a bill on Parvisol for five pounds for the half-year. And must I go on at four shillings a week, and neither eat nor drink for it? Who the Devil said Atterbury and your Dean were alike? I never saw your Chancellor, nor his chaplain. The latter has a good deal of learning, and is a well-wisher to be an author: your Chancellor is an excellent man. As for Patrick's bird, he bought him for his tameness, and is grown the wildest I ever saw. His wings have been quilled thrice, and are now up again: he will be able to fly after us to Ireland, if he be willing.--Yes, Mrs. Stella, Dingley writes more like Presto than you; for all you superscribed the letter, as who should say, Why should not I write like our Presto as well as Dingley? You with your awkward SS;(17) cannot you write them thus, SS? No, but always SSS. Spiteful sluts, to affront Presto's writing; as that when you shut your eyes you write most like Presto. I know the time when I did not write to you half so plain as I do now; but I take pity on you both. I am very much concerned for Mrs. Walls's eyes. Walls says nothing of it to me in his letter dated after yours. You say, [...] "If she recovers, she may lose her sight." [...] I hope she is in no danger of her life. Yes, Ford is as sober as I please: I use him to walk with me as an easy companion, always ready for what I please, when I am weary of business and Ministers. I don't go to a Coffee-house twice a month. I am very regular in going to sleep before eleven.--And so you say that Stella is a pretty girl; and so she be, and methinks I see her just now as handsome as the day is long. Do you know what? when I am writing in our language, I make up my mouth just as if I was speaking it. I caught myself at it just now. And I suppose Dingley is so fair and so fresh as a lass in May, and has her health, and no spleen.--In your account you sent do you reckon as usual from the 1st of November(18) was twelvemonth? Poor Stella, will not Dingley leave her a little daylight to write to Presto? Well, well, we'll have daylight shortly, spite of her teeth; and zoo(19) must cly Lele and Hele, and Hele aden. Must loo mimitate Pdfr, pay? Iss, and so la shall. And so lele's fol ee rettle. Dood-mollow.--At night. Mrs. Barton sent this morning to invite me to dinner; and there I dined, just in that genteel manner that MD used when they would treat some better sort of body than usual.|$|E

40|$|CONTEXT: Pancreatic {{pseudoaneurysm}} rupture {{is a rare}} {{complication of}} chronic pancreatitis, with severe prognosis and high mortality. Angiography is usually required for confirmation of the diagnosis, but transabdominal ultrasound and CT angiography are useful noninvasive diagnostic methods. CASE REPORT: We present {{the case of a}} 66 -year-old patient with a large pancreatic pseudoaneurysm of the superior mesenteric artery complicated with obstructive jaundice. Transabdominal ultrasound with color and power Doppler showed a large pancreatic head pseudoaneurysm that communicated directly to the superior mesenteric artery. Presence of a spinning blood flow inside the pseudoaneurysm was visualized by color Doppler, with evidence of bidirectional flow in the pseudoaneurysm neck <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>showed</b> by Doppler spectral analysis. The contrast-enhanced helical computer tomography with multiplanar sagittal and the 3 D reconstruction of coronal images confirmed the communication of the pseudoaneurysm with the superior mesenteric artery. The patient was scheduled for selective angiography and embolization. However, clinical evolution was rapidly deteriorating, with collapse, hemorrhagic shock and massive hemorrhage. The patient was operated on and subsequently died despite three days of intensive care, due to disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiorgan failure. CONCLUSION: Non invasive imaging methods consisting of transabdominal ultrasound with color Doppler and contrast-enhanced computer tomography with sagittal reconstruction of coronal images were very useful in the establishment of the diagnosis of pancreatic pseudoaneurysm of the superior mesenteric artery complicated with cholestatic jaundice. However, these imaging methods do not obviate the need for diagnostic and therapeutic angiography, eventually followed by surgical intervention in cases of recurrent bleeding or hemodynamic unstable patients...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Nonimmune {{pregnant}} women {{are at risk}} of developing congenital rubella syndrome and measles complications. We aimed to identify {{pregnant women}} susceptible to rubella or measles {{in order to determine the}} need for immunity screening and supplemental immunization in women of childbearing age. METHOD: This seroprevalence survey was conducted by convenience sampling in obstetric hospitals affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences (southern Iran). Serum IgG levels were measured by ELISA. RESULT: Mean age of the 175 pregnant women was 27. 3 ± 5. 3 (range 16 to 42) years. The geometric mean concentration of anti-rubella IgG was 14. 9 IU/mL (CI 95 %, 14. 1 - 15. 5), and that of anti-measles IgG was 13. 8 IU/mL (CI 95 %, 13 - 14. 5). One hundred sixty-eight women (96 %) had a protective serologic level (> 11 IU/mL) of IgG against rubella, and 143 (81. 7 %) had a protective level against measles. Except for a significant inverse correlation <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>showed</b> by univariate analysis between anti-rubella IgG and the women's age (P =  0. 01), immunity did not correlate with demographic or obstetric characteristics or medical history. There was no significant correlation between anti-rubella and anti-measles IgG levels (P =  0. 25). CONCLUSION: Nearly a decade after Iran's nationwide measles-rubella vaccination campaign for the population aged 5 - 25 years, most pregnant women up to 34 years of age had humoral immunity against rubella. We recommend rubella immunity screening or catch-up immunization for women older than 35 years who wish to become pregnant, and measles immunity screening and appropriate vaccination for all women of childbearing age...|$|E

40|$|Khark & Kharko Islands are {{the last}} Northern point for {{fringing}} coral reefs in Iranian side of the Persian Gulf. These Coralline habitats are the Protected Area and Wildlife Refugees with the total area of 2400 ha which located in the territory of Bushehr Province. This research carried out during 2006 - 2007 with monthly sampling from 12 stations, which selected around Islands and inshore waters with maximum depth of 20 meter. Sampling was conducted using by Bongo-Net plankton sampler with 500 μ of mesh size. Totally, 1808 specimen from 45 family fish larvae was identified in studied area, including: 21 coralline fish larva families and 24 shore fish larvae such as pelagic and demersal fishes which some of them known as indicator, sentinel or endemic species for coral reef ecosystems. The results was shown that coral reef diversity in coral reefs (Khark & Kharko Islands) is more than other habitats such as estuary and river mouth, creeks, mangrove forest sites, and off shore water of the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea Iranian side. Among Identified families, Clupeidae, Blenniidae, Sillaginidae, Atherinidae and Tripterygiidae; with more abundance were dominant families in studied area. The pick of fish larvae abundance family were estimated in spring. There were significant differences between seasonally abundance and sub areas, but there were not significant differences in diversity indexes between Khark and Kharko stations with coastal stations (p< 0. 05). The mean abundance of fish larvae were estimated 18. 7083 larvae under 10 m² of sea surface, and the mean diversity indexes and evenness were estimated 0. 7135 and 0. 565342 consequently, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>showed</b> the area is under ecological stress for fish larvae, and wasn’t stable. Therefore, from the ecological point of view, {{only some of the}} fish larvae groups as like Clupeidae were dominant. Thus, they were the main cause of the fish larvae abundance change in studied area. Due to geographical location of Khark and Kharko Islands and among the environmental parameters, Its seems that the condition of sea current is the main cause for present or absent and distribution patterns of fish larvae in area. Abundance of fish larvae in west of Islands was higher than eastern parts in the spring. But this condition will be reversed in eastern part of Island and several coastal stations, so that the Islands surrounding clock wise current to cause fish larvae distribution patterns...|$|E
40|$|Regional {{integration}} is to progress to an advanced and critical stage in SADC. With {{the launch of}} the SADC free trade area having taken place successfully in 2008 the next step according to the SADC RISDP is the customs union stage. This stage involves deeper integration as well as more cooperation amongst Member countries and to some extent will involve ceding of sovereignty to a supranational body that will be tasked with the administration of the customs union. With the lack of cooperation <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>showed</b> by some SADC countries during the implementation of the SADC FTA one doubts whether SADC countries will indeed cooperate during the customs union phase. Different levels of development, divergent trade policies and overlapping membership into other RECs pose a significant challenge into the formation of a SADC customs union. Looking at the challenges confronting the formation of the SADC customs union it would seem as if it is all gloom and doom. However one lesson picked up in all regional integration initiatives in all regions of the world is that significant challenges will always exist; what is important is that Member countries need to show full commitment and focus on the bigger goal they seek to achieve as the region. SACU the world’s oldest customs union is constituted by SADC Member countries. With the problem of overlapping membership SACU is both an obstacle and a solution for SADC depending on which view one holds. SACU can be seen as an obstacle because if SACU was not there perhaps the problem of overlapping membership would not be the way it is. Currently only one SADC country is not affected by the problem of overlapping into various other RECs. If SACU was not there the number of countries not overlapping would be perhaps six countries. On the other hand one can choose to look at SACU as a solution to the establishment of the SADC customs union under the circumstances that currently prevail in SADC. SACU {{can be used as a}} basis for a SADC customs union by having all other SADC Member that are ready to join the customs union accede into SACU and whilst others that are not ready still work on their policies and join latter when they are ready to do so. This is referred to as ‘variable-geometry’; a principle that has been successfully implemented in the EU over the years. However taking a close look at SACU one realises that there is still lot of work to be done within SACU to have SACU ready for expansion. Dissertation (LLM) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

40|$|The first time, Legislative {{election}} (pilkada) of bupati and wakil bupati in kabupaten jombang hold in 2008. Previously, {{the election}} of bupati and wakil bupati was done by assembly at regional. There were three couple of the candidate in pilkada, they were Nyono Suharli-Abdul Halim Iskandar (Nyono-Halim), Soeharto-Mudjib Musta’in (Harum), and Suyanto-Widjono Soeparno (ToNo). And information of pilkada campign of jombang {{became one of the}} interesting news to follow. One of the media that delivered news of campaign activity was Radar Mojokerto (Jawa Pos Group). Radar malang is daily news which was publicated in Mojokerto and Jombang. Cabub-Cawabub conducted the campaign in various ways to outdraw the society and it didn’t stay away from the media role. The news was constructed in such a manner by media. Therefore, it influenced the forming of Cabup-Cawabup that followed in pilkada and the gain voting. Based on the phenomena, the researcher was interested in knowing how the construction of news about campaign which was done by each of the couple candidates. To know the ways or ideology media in constructing news was used the discpourse analysis method through Teun A. Van Dijk. This research observed the meaning of behind the texts, to see how cognition of journalist who formed and influence in the textsa, and to see how the social structure, domination and authority group in society. That case was used as the strategy in the forming of news texts. before analyzing the social cognition and context, the texts firstly was analyzed by using discourse structure that was devided in three large structures, those were macro structure, superstructure and micro structure. Furthemore, they were clasified in elements of discourse, those were tematic, scematic, semantic, sintaxis, stylistic and retorist. This research also used qualitative design with discourse analysis method,while to explain the result used qualitative interpretative. From the result, daily radar Mojokerto constructed the news of campaign in pilkada in Jombang 2008 as open competition to get votes from their sympathizers. In the fact, the case based on the reality of the couple who followed in pilkada. Nyono-Halim Suyanto-Widjono was constructed by Radar Mojokerto to follow their jargon, Nyono-Halim had motto will “think, work, and pray for the civil”. There was religious nuance from the jargon itself, supporting by media that they always invited the sympathizers to keep aakhlaqul karimah. In the other hand, the jargon of Suyanto-Widjono made more important the successfulness of suyanto as incumbent candidate. It was also showed by Radar Mojokerto in giving information about the orations that yelled their success. Soeharto-Mudjib had slogan “Jombang Juara 1 ”, they were not supported from radar mojokerto because this couple was impressed “adem ayem’ during the campaign. Constructing by Radar Mojokerto in Cabup-Cawabup was influenced by social reality in jombang which notabene has name of kota santri, the society partly can not received if jombang was head from PDIP becaused of less religious. So, in giving infprmation of Suyanto-Widjono more emphasized on successful as incumbent candidate. Thus, Radar Mojokerto was still influenced by level of extra media. Moreover, Radar Mojokerto showed more to stay in Santri community Another level of extra media also influenced the forming texts. in this case was the influence of Suyanto-Widjono as news source and advertiser as source of income in media. The factors influence the information of Suyanto-Widjono <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>showed</b> by forming positive image about this couple through texts result. Therefore, the individual manager level of media influenced in constructing the texts because he had correlation personally with Suyanto. It also implicated economic charge from media which still depended on the advertisement income...|$|E
