40|$|Objective 　To {{explore the}} {{relationship}} of perioperative INVOS cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO 2) and postoperative cognition function alteration of geriatric patients under combined intravenous and volatile anesthesia with creatine phosphate disodium to provide guidance for clinical anesthesia. Methods 　Sixty ASA Ⅰ-Ⅱpatients aged > 60 years scheduled for selective abdominal surgeries or surgeries on lower limb {{were enrolled in the}} study. The patients were randomly divided into 3 groups of 20 patients: creatine phosphate disodium group 1 (CPD 1), creatine phosphate disodium group 2 (CPD 2), control group (C). All the patients were not premedicated with atropine 0. 5 mg until entering the operation room. Anesthesia was induced with intravenous infusion of propofol, fentanyl and cisatracurium slowly, and maintained by inhalational anesthetics sevoflurane 1 MAC plus intravenous infusion of propofol (6 - 8 mg•kg- 1 •min- 1) and remifentanyl (0. 2 - 0. 4 μg•kg- 1 •min- 1), and intravenous bolus cisatracurium (0. 07 - 0. 10 mg•kg- 1). After tracheal intubation, all the patients were mechanically ventilated with PETCO 2 in the normal range. rSO 2 was continuously monitored and recorded during the operation. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Trail-making <b>Test</b> and <b>Grooved</b> Pegboard <b>Test</b> were used to access cognitive function 24 h before surgery and 4, 8, 12, 24 h after surgery. Results 　(1) There {{were no significant differences in}} general status between the three groups (P> 0. 05). (2) The scores of MMSE, Trail-making <b>Test</b> and <b>Grooved</b> Pegboard <b>Test</b> were not different 24 h before the operation between the three groups (P> 0. 05). (3) The scores of cognitive tests were higher in group CPD 2 and group CPD 1 than in group C (P 0. 05). Conclusion 　CPD can reduce the occurrence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction in geriatric patients under combined intravenous and inhalational anesthesia.

40|$|Improvement in {{specific}} aspects of neurocognitive performance in children after renal transplantation. BackgroundChronic renal failure in childhood is considered to affect neurocognitive function adversely, and kidney transplantation may ameliorate the deficits. However, previous studies have suffered {{from the use of}} poorly matched control groups, comparison of transplant with uncorrected uremia, lack of standardization of dialysis, and insufficiently sensitive neuropsychological tests. MethodsWe studied nine medically stable children and adolescents age 14. 2 ± 3. 5 years with end-stage renal disease prior to and again one year after successful renal transplant. At baseline, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-III (WISC-III) or the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised (WAIS-R) was performed. Repeatable tests used before and after transplant included the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) or the Children’s Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (CHIPASAT), the Stroop Color-Word Naming Test, the Buschke Selective Reminding Test, the Meier Visual Discrimination <b>Test,</b> the <b>Grooved</b> Pegboard <b>Test,</b> the WISC-III or the WAIS-R Coding subtests and the Trailmaking Test. Computer-based measures of mental processing speed, reaction time, and discrimination sensitivity included the Cognitive Abilities Test (CAT) and the Connors Continuous Performance Test (CPT). Formal kinetic modeling of dialysis delivery ensured adequate renal replacement therapy. Transplant function was good on stable doses of immunosuppressives, without recent rejections at the time of testing. ResultsWithin-subject comparison showed statistically significant improvement in mental processing speed by CAT, reaction time and discrimination sensitivity by CPT, and working memory by PASAT/CHIPASAT after renal transplant. Other measures were unchanged. ConclusionMental processing speed and sustained attention improved in children after renal transplantation in a carefully controlled prospective cross-over study...|$|R
40|$|Background. Neurological deficits after {{a stroke}} are {{commonly}} classified according to motor function for clinical decision making regarding discharge and rehabilitation. Participants in clinical stroke studies are also stratified by motor function {{to avoid a}} sampling bias. Objective. This post hoc analysis examined a suite of upper limb functional assessment tools {{to test the hypothesis}} that motor function of survivors of stroke can be stratified using 2 simple tests of manual dexterity despite the heterogeneity of the population. Methods. The functional ability of the more affected hand and arm was assessed for 67 hemiparetic patients, aged 18 to 83 years (mean ± standard deviation, 59. 8 ± 14. 0 years), at 1 to 264 months after a stroke (23. 6 ± 39. 6 months) using the Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), upper limb motor Fugl-Meyer Assessment (F-M), Box and Block <b>Test</b> (BBT), <b>grooved</b> pegboard test, and wrist range of motion. We tested the strength of our proposed stratification scheme with a hypothesis-driven hierarchical cluster analysis using standardized raw scores and dichotomous BBT and grooved pegboard test values. Results. The most salient discriminator between low and higher motor function was the ability to move 3 ̆e 1 block on the BBT. Within the higher function group, the ability to place all 25 pegs on the grooved pegboard test discriminated between moderate and high motor function. The derived scheme was congruent with clinical observations. The WMFT timed tasks, F-M scores, and range of motion did not discriminate functional groups. Conclusions. Two simple unambiguous and objective tests of gross (BBT) and fine (grooved pegboard test) manual dexterity discriminated 3 groups of motor function ability for a heterogeneous group of patients after stroke...|$|R

40|$|Background and aims: Patients {{with pain}} have shown {{cognitive}} impairment across various domains. Although the pain qualities vary among patients, research has overlooked how cognitive performance {{is affected by}} the duration and persistence of pain. The current study sought to fill this gap by examining how qualitatively different pain states relate to the following cognitive functions: sustained attention, cognitive control, and psychomotor ability. Patients and methods: Patients with musculoskeletal pain in primary care were divided into three pain groups: acute pain (duration 3 months), and persistent pain (duration > 3 months). These groups were then compared with healthy controls. The MapCog Spectra Test, the Color Word <b>Test,</b> and the <b>Grooved</b> Pegboard <b>Test</b> were used to measure sustained attention, cognitive control, and psychomotor ability, respectively. Results: Patients with persistent pain showed significantly worse sustained attention and psychomotor ability compared with healthy controls. The acute pain group showed a significant decrease in psychomotor ability, and the regularly recurrent pain group showed a significant decrease in sustained attention. These results remained unchanged when age, education, and medication were taken into account. Conclusion: Persistent musculoskeletal pain seems to impair performance on a wider range of cognitive tasks than acute or regularly recurrent pain, using pain-free individuals as a benchmark. However, there is some evidence of impairment in psychomotor ability among patients with acute pain and some impairment in sustained attention among patients with regularly recurrent pain...|$|R

40|$|Insulin receptors {{have been}} {{identified}} in the central nervous system, particularly in the brain stem and limbic regions. Binding to the insulin receptor is regulated by the distribution of insulin in the brain, and this by the level of insulin in the peripheral circulation. Studies in animals suggest that insulin modulates a number of different neuronal activities including sleep-awake cycle patterns and satiety. Based on these observations, we hypothesized insulin also had effects on sleep and daytime cognitive performance in humans and that there may be differences between the effect of different insulin species or modes of insulin administration due to their differing time-effect profiles. Thus, we performed a crossover comparison of natural sleep measured by overnight polysomnography (PSG), day-time sleepiness measured by the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT), daytime cognitive performance measured by four psychological tests; namely, the Digit Symbol Substitution Test, the Symbol Digit Modalities <b>Test,</b> the <b>Grooved</b> Pegboard <b>Test</b> and the Manual Finger Tapping Test, in subjects with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) randomized to one-monthly treatments with human R/N insulin, beef/pork R/NPH insulin, beef/pork Iletin R/N insulin, lispro/human ultralente insulin, and continuous subcutaneous (beef/pork Iletin R or lispro) insulin using an insulin pump. They were also compared to eight age-, gender-, and weight-matched non-diabetic healthy control subjects. Our result showed that diabetic patients had a very disrupted sleep, characterized by a 30 % shorter REM onset latency, 30 % less time in SWS and REMS and a high frequency of stage shifts, REMS periods and awakenings after sleep onset. They were also significantly more sleepy during the day on the MSLT. Cognitive performance on psychometric testing was similar to that of non-diabetic controls, but showed significantly greater fluctuation throughout the day. Human R/N insulin-treated diabetics fell asleep faster on both the PSG and MSLT, and had 25 % more REMS time and a better sleep distribution than beef/pork R/NPH insulin-treated diabetics. Conversely, lispro/human ultralente treated diabetics spent more time in stage 1 sleep, and less in REMS. Insulin pumping, particularly with beef/pork insulin increased the duration of REMS and REMS distribution, increased the time to fall asleep on the MSLT, and generally improved overall daytime cognitive function, although the pattern of sleep disruption persisted. Thus, we conclude that insulin has important effects on sleep and daytime performance in humans, and that different insulin have different effects, depending upon their pharmacokinetic profiles...|$|R

The main objective {{of this research was}} to measure the steady-state and transient thermal performance of three wall assemblies (4 ft 7 6 ft), two of which incorporated VIPs within an XPS Tongue and <b>Groove</b> (<b>T</b> and G) configuration and VIPs within an XPS Clip-On (C-O) configuration, and a third assembly incorporating only XPS. The three wall assemblies were installed in the FEWF for 1 -year cycle of exposure to outdoor natural weather conditions. The hygIRC-C model was used in this study. The results of the model calculations were in good agreement with the experimental data. Given that the VIPs could be punctured during the installation process or could fail during normal operating conditions, additional model calculations were used to predict the thermal resistance in cases where one or more VIPs failed. The model was also used to predict the yearly cumulative heat losses across these wall systems. It is {{important to point out that}} the aging effect and the effect of the thermal bridging due to envelope (i. e. skin) of the VIPs are not accounted for in this study.

We prospectively evaluated 59 patients undergoing CABG. Patients in the single (SC, n = 37) and multiple clamp (MC, n = 22) groups were comparable in relation to age and operative risk (p > 0. 05). Neurocognitive evaluation consisted of the Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT), Color Trails <b>Test</b> A, the <b>Grooved</b> Pegboard test and the Mini-Mental State Examination. Data acquisition was performed preoperatively, early postoperatively and at the 4 -month follow-up. Intraoperative transcranial Doppler (TCD) monitoring was used to quantify the embolic load in relation to different aortic clamping strategies. Preoperative neurocognitive results were similar between the groups (p > 0. 05). The incidence of postoperative delirium was greater in the MC group but this failed to reach statistical significance (23 % vs 8 %, p = 0. 14). SC patients had fewer embolization signals (270 ± 181 vs 465 ± 160, p < 0. 0001). Early postoperative neurocognitive results were depressed in comparison to preoperative values in both groups (p < 0. 05 for multiple comparisons). The magnitude of this cognitive depression was greater in the MC group (p < 0. 05 for multiple comparisons). Preoperative levels of neurocognition were restored at follow-up in the SC group in all tests except the AVLT. A trend towards improvements in neurocognitive performances at follow-up was also observed in the MC group. Residual attention, motor skill and memory deficits were, however, documented with multiple tests. In conclusion, the embolic burden was significantly lower in the SC group. This TCD imaging outcome translated into fewer early cognition deficits and superior late restoration of function...|$|R

Purpose This in-vitro {{study was designed}} from a clinical case and investigated how mechanical and chemical changes on implant abutment surfaces would result in different tensile strengths between computer-aided design/computer-aided manufactured lithium disilicate crowns and implant abutments. Material & Methods A clinical case master cast of a maxillary right central incisor single implant restoration was utilized to fabricate five different abutment types: titanium smooth surface (Ts), titanium with retentive grooves (Tr), titanium with titanium nitride coating without grooves (Gs), titanium with titanium nitride coating with retentive feature (Gr), and zirconia(Z). A total of 50 lithium disilicate crowns were fabricated and equally divided into five groups. The maximum tensile strength of each combination was measured using a universal testing machine until the interface failed. Results The rank of mean retention value was found from highest to lowest, titanium with titanium nitride coating with grooves (Gr), titanium with titanium nitride coating without grooves (Gs), titanium with retentive grooves (Tr), titanium without retentive <b>grooves</b> (<b>Ts),</b> and zirconia (Z). One-way ANOVA analysis indicated the retention value of the Gr has statistically significant difference compared to all other groups (p < 0. 05).

40|$|Antigenic {{peptides}} {{are thought}} to bind to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules through three modes of interaction: van der Waals interaction {{and to a lesser}} extent, hydrogen bonding of anchor side chain atoms to residues comprising the binding pockets of the MHC molecule; hydrogen bonding of N- and C-termini to residues at the ends of the binding groove; and hydrogen bonding of peptide backbone atoms to residues lining the binding <b>groove.</b> <b>T</b> cell receptors (TCRs) on surfaces of CD 8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) recognize a molecular surface created from the combination of the antigenic peptide with the MHC class I molecule. ^ In this work, we explored the structural parameters of this interaction with VSV- 8, an H- 2 Kb restricted antigenic peptide derived from vesicular stomatitis virus, as a model peptide. Retro-inverso (RI) analogs of the VSV- 8 peptides were synthesized to determine the contribution of peptide backbone atoms to the stability of the MHC- peptide complex. We found that the peptide backbone atoms greatly contribute to the affinity of the VSV- 8 peptide to the H- 2 Kb molecule. Analysis of the first-order computer models of the RI VSV- 8 analogs in complex with the H- 2 Kb molecule suggested that the stability of the MHC-peptide complex is derived from an extensive network of hydrogen bonds formed between the peptide backbone atoms and the MHC side chain atoms. ^ Furthermore, P 3 and/or P 5 side chain analogs of the VSV- 8 peptide were also made to explore the role of buried peptide side chains in the conformation of the MHC class I molecular surface recognized by the TCR. We found that fine atomic substitutions of the hydroxyl group with hydrogen, fluorine, or bromine on the buried tyrosine residues resulted in a conformational change in the MHC-peptide complex that can be detected by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), CTLs, and TCR transfected hybridomas. These results are consistent with a model of the conformation of the MHC class I molecular surface that is exquisitely dependent on the structure of the buried “anchor” residues within the antigenic peptide. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSelenium (Se) is a {{well-known}} anti-oxidant with {{a critical role in}} the proper functioning of nervous and muscle functions. Se deficiency has been associated with both cognitive and neuromotor impairment, while sensory and motor deficits have been attributed to excess Se. In the Lower Tapajós Region of the Brazilian Amazon, riverside populations present a wide range of Se levels. These fish-eating communities have among the highest mercury (Hg) exposures reported in the world today, and recently, lead (Pb) exposure has been identified. Some studies suggest that Se intake can be protective for Hg and/or Pb toxicity, however, data from animal and human studies are inconsistent. The objective {{of the present study was}} to examine the relations between biomarkers of Se and motor functions, taking into account co-variables and biomarkers of exposure to Hg and Pb. Participants (n= 448), aged 15 – 87 y, were recruited from 12 communities along the Tapajós River. Se concentrations were measured in whole blood (B-Se), plasma (P-Se), hair (H-Se) and urine (U-Se) by ICP-MS. Whole blood Hg (B-Hg) and Pb (B-Pb) were also measured by ICP-MS. Interview-administered questionnaires served to collect information on socio-demographics and medical history. All participants underwent a complete visual examination and performed tests of motor functions (Branches Alternate Movement Task, Santa Ana <b>Test,</b> Dynamometer and <b>Grooved</b> Pegboard <b>Test).</b> B-Se varied from 103 to 1500 μg/L (median 228 μg/L), P-Se from 53. 6 to 913 μg/L (median 135 μg/L), H-Se from 0. 4 to 3. 8 μg/g (median 0. 7 μg/g) and U-Se from 2. 3 to 1375 μg/g cr. (median 33. 6 μg/g cr.). Median B-Hg and B-Pb levels were 42. 5 μg/L and 113 μg/L respectively. In multivariable analysis, Se biomarkers (log-transformed) were positively related to better performance on all motor tests, taking into account socio-demographic co-variables and B-Hg and B-Pb levels. P-Se consistently showed stronger associations to motor performance compared to the other Se biomarkers. Regression estimates for Se biomarkers were considerably stronger when controlling for B-Hg. When stratifying at the median for B-Hg concentrations, P-Se consistently presented associations with the outcomes only at high B-Hg concentrations. This is the first human study to report beneficial effects of high Se status on motor functions. For this population with elevated Hg exposure, high dietary Se intake may be critical for brain and muscle functions. However, these findings are not necessarily applicable to populations with lower Hg exposure and/or Se status, which is the case for people who do not rely heavily on fish consumption, be they in Brazil, the United States or elsewhere. The associations were mostly observed with P-Se, suggesting that P-Se or plasma selenoproteins may be good biomarkers for these outcomes...|$|R
