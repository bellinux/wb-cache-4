40|$|Overcrowding {{has been}} an issue in many {{outpatient}} clinics and emergency rooms of healthcare organizations. However, they are important departments that are required to efficiently serve the masses of patients from the general public. This workshop is created to {{understand the importance of}} evaluating the business processes in these departments and how data analytics can help to create insights and provides the opportunity for process and scheduling improvement, hence maximizing efficiency. A process view is important as it allows healthcare organization <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>focus</b> <b>on</b> business needs and drive analytics initiatives. It also helps to leverage on economies of scales in applying techniques to multiple processes of similar nature. The workshop will also cover more advanced topics such as predictive and decision analytics, coupled with IT considerations to create decision-support strategies that enable proactive business processes. Proactive processes combine analytic tools with business process management technology in order to achieve continuous process improvements. Being proactive helps the healthcare organization prepare for likely scenarios. In the final part of the workshop, a case-study in the context of fulfilling service targets of a hospital’s emergency room will be used to show how use of data analytics, prediction analytics and decision analytics can empower decision-making and bring improvements to the ED process. The workshop will be conducted in seminar-styled, small-group coaching and small-group presentations. It is designed to be highly interactive to facilitate discussions and idea generations...|$|R

40|$|The tempestuous rise {{of finance}} in {{contemporary}} capitalism has incited a frantic {{search for new}} conceptual tools to make empirical and theoretical sense of it.

5000|$|Ravikumar's {{films are}} usually {{made with a}} {{commercial}} format in the masala genre, with action, family sentiment, comedy, betrayal, revenge and redemption, appearing as key themes. The decision against marking art films was a self-made decision, despite making his debut with a significantly different thriller in Puriyaadha Pudhir (1990). Ravikumar has often associated with the same team of writers and assistants since his early career, with actor-director Ramesh Khanna being a constant fixture in his team since a shelved venture titled Pudhu Kaaviyam was announced in 1990. Rather than considering his original storylines, Ravikumar has primarily gathered plots from other writers, refined them and adapted them into screenplays. He has also regularly associated with Erode Soundar in village action films, M. A. Kennedy in romantic comedies and Crazy Mohan in ventures featuring Kamal Haasan. Ravikumar often works on the script with his own story discussion team, away from his assistant directors, revealing that writing was [...] "a personal process".

40|$|AbstractIn the {{academic}} sector, most engineering research funding presupposes collaborative projects. Collaboration between academia and industry is encouraged. This approach creates successive complexity in most Research and Development (R&D) projects in many ways. Projects {{funded by the}} European Commission or jointly funded by national agencies are often encouraged to become large, competing companies may become partners, objectives are unclear, and overall vagueness usually increases with consortium size. Many companies and some research organizations have created project management offices (PMO) to deal with project complexity. Typically, project managers in research organizations are excellent researchers but less skilled or interested in project management. <b>To</b> help researchers <b>stay</b> <b>focused</b> <b>on</b> research and not get side tracked by project management, the PMO provides professional project management services to researchers and research projects. The combination of excellent research and professional project management is a success factor when handling a large portfolio of complex projects.
