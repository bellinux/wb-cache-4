5|$|Psychological {{studies found}} that {{individuals}} with little mathematics education tend to estimate quantities logarithmically, that is, they position a number on an unmarked line according to its logarithm, so that 10 is positioned as close to 100 as 100 is to 1000. Increasing education shifts <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> linear estimate (positioning 1000 10x as far away) in some circumstances, while logarithms are used when the numbers to be plotted are difficult to plot linearly.|$|E

The third constitution in 1850 reduced the succession limitation to four years. A 1992 {{amendment to the constitution}} allowed governors to have a second term before being prevented from succeeding themselves for four years.|$|E

5|$|The town {{used to be}} {{the focus}} of {{thriving}} river business and was an important stop on the Dublin to Limerick navigation. It supported a number of large industries, most notably a maltings and distillery, which are now defunct. Tourism has supplanted <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> certain extent with a modern marina providing support for river cruisers and watersports facilities and the town is an important angling centre, with particular attraction for pike anglers. Banagher is the centre of the Shannon Callows, grassy meadows which flood in winter and provide living space for myriads of waterfowl.|$|E
5|$|A study {{published}} in 2000 by researchers from the University of Georgia and the US Fish and Wildlife Service looked at data collected between 1986 and 1990 {{in an effort to}} better understand the herd dynamics of the Cumberland Island herd. The study found that band instability was high, with mares not generally forming close relationships with each other and commonly switching which stallion they banded with, and juveniles dispersing quickly. The researchers attributed <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lack of territory, with bands frequently inhabiting overlapping areas, along with a high number of bachelor stallions (those without mares). They also saw a high number of co-dominant stallions, where two or more stallions would lead a band together, and alternate breeding of the band's mares. Foals born on Cumberland Island were less likely to survive than comparable foals in western feral herds, with survival rates of 58.8-61.1% and 80% respectively. This was found to be especially true in animals born after 1 June, which was attributed to higher temperatures, higher insect levels and reduced food availability. The number of horses in the Cumberland bands was comparable to western bands and those on some eastern islands. However, Assateague and Shackleford Banks horses tended to have larger bands, with an average of 8.1 and 12.3 horses per band, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Double Fine {{demonstrated}} an in-progress {{version of the}} remastered game at the 2014 IndieCade event in October 2014; new features included higher-resolution textures and improved resolution for the character models as well as having real-time lighting models, {{and the ability to}} switch back and forth between this presentation and the original graphics {{at the touch of a}} control. The remastered game runs in 4:3 aspect ratio but has an option to stretch <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> 16:9 ratio rather than render in a native 16:9 ratio. The remaster includes improvements to the control scheme developed by Pfaff's patch and other alternate control schemes in addition to the original tank-like controls, including analogue controls for console versions and point-and-click controls for computer versions. The game's soundtrack was fully orchestrated through performances of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (who also performed the soundtrack for Double Fine's Broken Age). The remastered version also includes developer commentary, which can be activated via the options menu and listened to at various points in the game. The PlayStation version also features cloud saving between the PS4 and Vita versions.|$|E

5|$|During Richard's {{first years}} as king, {{government}} {{was in the}} hands of a series of councils. Most of the aristocracy preferred <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> regency led by the king's uncle, John of Gaunt, yet Gaunt remained highly influential. The first major challenge of the reign was the Peasants' Revolt in 1381. The young king played a major part in the successful suppression of this crisis. In the following years, however, the king's dependence on a small number of courtiers caused discontent among the influential, and in 1387 control of government was taken over by a group of aristocrats known as the Lords Appellant. By 1389 Richard had regained control, and for the next eight years governed in relative harmony with his former opponents.|$|E
5|$|Following this, the 17th Brigade {{advanced}} towards Guadagasal, {{but after}} supply problems ground <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> halt, throughout March and April {{a series of}} patrols were sent out towards Mubo. By late April the brigade was detached to the 3rd Division, a primarily Militia formation, which took up the task of defending Wau. Throughout this time, engineers from the 6th Division, including the 2/1st Field Company, would to improve supply lines throughout the area, cutting a road to Wau. The 2/2nd Field Ambulance also provided support to the brigade's operations, establishing medical services close to the Australian forward areas.|$|E
5|$|Marine mammals were hunted by coastal {{aboriginal}} humans historically {{for food}} and other resources. These subsistence hunts still occur in Canada, Greenland, Indonesia, Russia, the United States, and several nations in the Caribbean. The effects of these are only localized, as hunting efforts were on a relatively small scale. Commercial hunting took <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> much greater scale and marine mammals were heavily exploited. This led to the extinction of the †Steller's sea cow (along with subsistence hunting) and the †Caribbean monk seal. Today, populations of species that were historically hunted, such as blue whales (Balaenoptera musculus) and the North Pacific right whale (Eubalaena japonica), are much lower than their pre-whaling levels. Because whales generally have slow growth rates, are slow to reach sexual maturity, and have a low reproductive output, population recovery has been very slow.|$|E

5|$|Sydney {{normally}} transported 450 soldiers—the main {{force of}} a Royal Australian Regiment (RAR) battalion—plus equipment and vehicles on each voyage. The soldiers were accommodated in the sailors mess decks, with the sailors displaced to the hangar. Vehicles were secured to the flight deck, while other cargo was packed onto pallets and stored either in the hangar or on the flight deck. Although it was originally intended that Sydney would sail to and from Saigon, the ship's commanding officer {{at the time of}} the first voyage, John Crabb, informed the Naval Board that he would refuse orders to do so, as the Saigon River could easily be mined after Sydney had sailed up. Instead, the port of Vũng Tàu was selected as the destination, with soldiers and equipment transferred to shore by helicopters, landing craft, and barges. During the early voyages, unloading and reloading was a multiple-day process, with the transport moving to deeper waters each night, but improved cargo handling practices, upgrades to Sydney (including the installation of three new cargo cranes and six embarked landing craft during mid-1968 refit), and increased access to US cargo- and troop-carrying helicopters, reduced <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> single day by 1968.|$|E
5|$|The RPF advance {{continued}} unchecked through February, {{its forces}} moving steadily south and gaining territory without opposition. They took Ruhengeri {{on the first}} day of fighting, and later the city of Byumba. As with the previous RPF advances, the Hutu civilians in the area fled en masse from the areas the RPF were taking, travelling back into the government-controlled territory. These exoduses were likely driven primarily by the fear of the RPF established by years of propaganda, although the RPF soldiers were guilty in some areas of small scale killing of Hutu civilians. Prunier attributes <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> combination of retribution for the massacre of Tutsi perpetrated in these areas in late January, as well as some indiscriminate killing. This RPF violence increased the fear felt by the Hutu population, but also served to further alienate the rebels from their potential allies in the democratic Rwandan opposition parties.|$|E
5|$|The average {{ordinary}} {{revenue of}} the republic at this time amounted to between 28 and 35 million guilders. However, since {{the outbreak of the}} war in 1793 the expenditure had been running at between 40 and 55 millions. For the year 1800 the republic had to find 78 million guilders for its expenditures. In other words, the new Agent of Finance, Gogel, was faced with a financial emergency. He needed to generate about 50 million guilders annually in ordinary revenue on a permanent basis urgently. Besides, as the Dutch tax system was heavily skewed toward highly regressive indirect taxes, which inordinately burdened the impoverished population, he wanted to change <b>this</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> system that depended more on direct (income and wealth) taxes. Finally, he wanted {{to do away with the}} provincial differentiation in the taxation, and construct a nationally standardized system. When he put these reform proposals to the Representative Assembly on 30 September 1799, they met with massive resistance. This led to so much delay in its acceptance that by the time it was to be implemented (in 1801) the re-federalisation of the state by the new Staatsbewind regime was already underway. Eventually, Gogel's reforms were only implemented under the successor state of the Kingdom of Holland.|$|E
