25|$|To induce labor: An {{intravenous}} {{infusion of}} oxytocin {{is used to}} induce labor and to support labor in case of slow childbirth if the Oxytocin Challenge Test (OCT) fail. It is unclear whether a high dose {{is better than a}} standard dose for labor induction. It has largely replaced ergometrine as the principal agent to increase uterine tone in acute postpartum hemorrhage. Oxytocin is also used in veterinary medicine to facilitate birth and to stimulate milk release. The tocolytic agent atosiban (Tractocile) acts as an antagonist of oxytocin receptors; this drug is registered in many countries to suppress premature labor between 24 and 33 weeks of gestation. It has fewer side effects than drugs previously used for this purpose (ritodrine, salbutamol, and <b>terbutaline).</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Terbutaline</b> as a {{treatment}} for premature labor is an off-label use not approved by the FDA. It is a pregnancy category C medication and is routinely prescribed to stop contractions. After successful intravenous tocolysis, little evidence exists that oral <b>terbutaline</b> is effective. However, following uterine inversion in the third stage of labor, <b>terbutaline</b> (or either Halothane or magnesium sulfate) can be used to relax the uterus if necessary prior to uterine replacement.|$|E
50|$|<b>Terbutaline</b> {{is used as}} a {{fast-acting}} bronchodilator (often used as {{a short-term}} asthma treatment) and as a tocolytic to delay premature labor. The inhaled form of <b>terbutaline</b> starts working within 15 minutes and can last up to 6 hours.|$|E

50|$|It is also {{marketed as}} a {{combination}} drug with <b>terbutaline</b> as Doxoll-TL, Mucosma-T and Phylex-TR.|$|E
50|$|The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also discourages {{the use of}} <b>terbutaline</b> for {{preventing}} preterm labor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Terbutaline</b> is {{currently}} on the World Anti-Doping Agency's list of prohibited drugs, except when administered by inhalation and a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) has been obtained in advance.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Terbutaline</b> (trade names [...] "Bronclyn",Brethine, Bricanyl, Brethaire, or Terbulin) is a β2 {{adrenergic}} receptor agonist, {{used as a}} [...] "reliever" [...] inhaler {{in the management of}} asthma symptoms and as a tocolytic (anti-contraction medication) to delay preterm labor for up to 48 hours. This time can then be used to administer steroid injections to the mother which help fetal lung maturity and reduce complications of prematurity. [...] It should not be used to prevent preterm labor or delay labor more than 48-72 hours. In February 2011, the Food and Drug Administration has ordered to put a boxed warning on the drug's label. Pregnant women should not be given injections of the drug <b>terbutaline</b> for the prevention of preterm labor or for long-term (beyond 48-72 hours) management of preterm labor, and should not be given oral <b>terbutaline</b> for any type of prevention or treatment of preterm labor [...] "due to the potential for serious internal heart problems and death." ...|$|E
50|$|It is {{synthesized}} by brominating 3,5-dibenzyloxyacetophenone {{into the}} appropriate 3,5-dibenzyloxybromoacetophenone, which is reacted with N-benzyl-N-tert-butylamine, giving the aminoketone. Reduction of this product by hydrogen over a palladium catalyst leads to <b>terbutaline.</b>|$|E
50|$|Bambuterol (INN) is a long-acting β {{adrenoceptor}} agonist (LABA) used in {{the treatment}} of asthma; it also is a prodrug of <b>terbutaline.</b> Commercially, the AstraZeneca pharmaceutical company produces and markets bambuterol as Bambec and Oxeol.|$|E
50|$|The {{tertiary}} butyl {{group in}} <b>terbutaline</b> {{makes it more}} selective for β2 receptors. Since there is no hydroxy group on position 4 of the benzene ring, the molecule is less susceptible to metabolism by the enzyme catechol-O-methyl transferase.|$|E
50|$|Short-acting {{beta-agonists}} like salbutamol or <b>terbutaline</b> or long-acting beta-agonists like salmeterol and formoterol dilate airways which {{relieve the}} symptoms thus reducing {{the severity of}} the reaction. Some patients also use it just before work to avoid a drop in the FEV1.|$|E
5000|$|Inhaled {{bronchodilators}} {{open up the}} airways in the lungs. These include salbutamol and <b>terbutaline</b> (both β2-adrenergic agonists), and ipratropium (an anticholinergic). Medication can {{be administered}} via inhaler or nebuliser. There {{is no evidence to}} prefer a nebuliser over an inhaler.|$|E
50|$|In {{patients}} with asthma, budesonide/formoterol formulation for both maintenance and as-needed treatment reduces exacerbations better than as-needed formoterol or as-needed <b>terbutaline.</b> Nevertheless, {{it is unclear}} as to whether this strategy is better than increasing a maintenance dose of Symbicort or similar combined inhaler.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{several of}} these {{medications}} are available in intravenous forms, including both salbutamol and <b>terbutaline.</b> It {{can be used in}} this form in severe cases of asthma, but it is more commonly used to suppress premature labor because it also relaxes uterine muscle, thereby inhibiting contractions.|$|E
50|$|Salbutamol (INN) or albuterol (USAN) {{and some}} other β2 agonists, such as formoterol, also come in a {{solution}} form for nebulization, which is more commonly used than inhalers in emergency rooms. Salbutamol and <b>terbutaline</b> are also both available in oral forms. Nebulizer form is as effective as administering the drug intravenously.|$|E
50|$|On 28 April 2016, Simon Yates {{returned}} an adverse analytical finding for <b>Terbutaline.</b> Yates had been prescribed {{the drug to}} treat asthma, but a therapeutic use exemption (TUE) request had not been filed. The team attributed this to an administrative error. The team took full responsibility for this error, emphasising that Yates had no fault in the occurrence.|$|E
50|$|If {{aspiration}} is {{not sufficient}} a small dose of phenylephrine may be injected into the corpus cavernosum. Side effects of phenylephrine may include high blood pressure, slow heart rate, and arrhythmia. If this medication is used, {{it is recommended that}} people be monitored {{for at least an hour}} after. For those with recurrent ischemic priapism diethylstilbestrol (DES) or <b>terbutaline</b> may be tried.|$|E
50|$|The {{prevention}} of episodes of SCLS has involved two approaches. The first {{has long been}} identified with the Mayo Clinic, and it recommends treatment with beta agonists such as <b>terbutaline,</b> phosphodiesterase inhibitor theophylline and leukotriene receptor antagonists montelukast sodium. The second, more recent approach pioneered in France involves monthly intravenous infusions of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), and the growing case-report evidence is encouraging.|$|E
5000|$|Uterine {{hyperstimulation}} or hypertonic uterine dysfunction is {{a potential}} complication of labor induction. It is defined as either a series of single contractions lasting 2 minutes or more OR a contraction frequency of five or more in 10 minutes. [...] Uterine hyperstimulation may result in fetal heart rate abnormalities, uterine rupture, or placental abruption. It is usually treated by administering <b>terbutaline.</b>|$|E
50|$|On {{the morning}} of 25 February 2008, MacLeod was {{announced}} to have tested positive for banned substance <b>terbutaline,</b> only to be retrospectively cleared {{a few hours later}} after it was revealed to be nothing more than an administrative error. It was also announced later in the year that he had failed a doping test due to unusually high testosterone levels. He was later cleared as the rise in testosterone was due to a large amount of alcohol being consumed by the player the night before the test to celebrate the birth of his first child.|$|E
50|$|Principles of {{management}} are {{to treat the}} shock and replace the uterus. The patient should be moved rapidly to the OR to facilitate anesthesia monitoring during this procedure. Usually this complication is only recognized after delivery of the placenta, wherein pitocin has already been started, which just exacerbates the problem. The uterus clamps down around the inversion making {{it very difficult to}} perform a replacement. This is a true obstetrical emergency, so extra doctors, nurses, anesthesiologists should be summoned to the room to assist. The pitocin should be turned off immediately. Giving tocolytics such as <b>terbutaline</b> or magnesium sulfate have a lower success rate. Halothane and Nitroglycerine (100mcg to 200 mcg intravenously) have a higher success rate.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} short-acting β2 {{agonists}} available including salbutamol (Ventolin) and <b>terbutaline.</b> They provide some relief of symptoms {{for four to}} six hours. Long-acting β2 agonists such as salmeterol, formoterol and indacaterol are often used as maintenance therapy. Some feel the evidence of benefits is limited while others view the evidence of benefit as established. Long-term use appears safe in COPD with adverse effects include shakiness and heart palpitations. When used with inhaled steroids they {{increase the risk of}} pneumonia. While steroids and LABAs may work better together, it is unclear if this slight benefit outweighs the increased risks. Indacaterol requires an inhaled dose once a day, and is as effective as the other long-acting β2 agonist drugs that require twice-daily dosing for people with stable COPD.|$|E

5000|$|In April 2016 {{it emerged}} that Yates had tested {{positive}} for the banned substance <b>terbutaline</b> in an in-competition test during Paris-Nice the previous month, where he finished seventh overall. In a statement Orica-GreenEDGE took full responsibility for the test result, saying that the team's doctor had failed to apply for a therapeutic use exemption for an asthma inhaler used by Yates which triggered the positive test. Subsequently, the UCI issued a statement indicating that Yates would not be provisionally suspended from competition due to the substance he had {{tested positive for}}. On 17 June, the UCI decided to issue a four-month ban for [...] "non intentional doping", backdated from 12 March (the date the positive sample was collected), preventing Yates from competing at the 2016 Tour de France.|$|E
50|$|In 1967, it {{was shown}} that the β2-receptor was {{responsible}} for bronchodilation and this led to development of more selective drugs. In 1961 orciprenaline, a longer acting β2-agonist was found, {{but it was not}} as potent as isoproterenol. Orciprenaline does not have the catechol structure which was the reason for the longer action time. In the mid-1960s, albuterol or salbutamol was discovered, followed by terbutalin and fenoterol a few years later. Albuterol and <b>terbutaline</b> gave fewer side effects, such as increased heart rate, than isoproterenol. The pharmaceutical company Glaxo discovered salmeterol, a long-acting β2-agonist that had bronchodilation activity for up to 12 hours. It was marketed in 1990. Formoterol, another long-acting β2-agonist, was marketed shortly after. This long duration of action made the treatment for severe asthma and COPD more convenient for the patients because it is inhaled twice a day.In 2013 an extra long-acting β2-agonist, vilanterol, was marketed. Its duration of action lasts for 24 hours which should improve patients' compliance and make the treatment more convenient.|$|E
50|$|The {{kinetics}} of airway {{smooth muscle}} relaxation, {{as long as}} the onset and duration of bronchodilation in asthmatic patients, are reflected by the difference in the mechanism of interaction of short- (SABAs) and longacting β2-agonists (LABAs) and the β2-receptor.There are many formulations of selective β2-agonists; inhalation is the route of choice because it is the most rapidly effective and is associated with minimum side effects.Sulfate conjugates are the main metabolites; protein binding is rather weak and only insignificant interactions have been found with other drugs.The main enzymes that regulate metabolism of the chatecholamines are COMT and MAO. The commercial SABAs, salbutamol and <b>terbutaline</b> are resistant to COMT but are slowly metabolised by MAO, while the LABAs are resistant to both COMT and MAO. Also, the long duration of action for salmeterol is related to increased lipophilicity of the molecules, allowing it to remain for a longer time in the lungs. β2-agonists are mainly eliminated by the renal process after parenteral administration, while after oral administration a more pronounced metabolic clearance (high first pass effect) is responsible for a low bioavailability. The elimination after inhalation has not been studied but the profile is likely somewhere between what we see after parenteral and oral administration.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the efficacy of}} the <b>terbutaline</b> pump for the prevention of preterm delivery, patients in preterm labor defined by progressive cervical change underwent intravenous magnesium sulfate tocolysis (with or without oral indomethacin, as necessary), and once labor was arrested, were randomized to one of three treatment arms: <b>terbutaline</b> by pump, saline by pump (blinded), or oral <b>terbutaline.</b> If recurrent preterm labor occurred despite maximization of therapy, the treatment arm was determined and therapy was changed; saline pump and oral <b>terbutaline</b> were switched to <b>terbutaline</b> pump, <b>terbutaline</b> pump was switched to oral <b>terbutaline.</b> Patients who continued to labor were readmitted for aggressive intravenous therapy. Women randomized to the <b>terbutaline</b> pump (n = 15), saline pump (n = 12), and oral <b>terbutaline</b> (n = 15) groups were similar in terms of gravidity, parity, days of tocolysis before study entry, gestational age at entry, and cervical dilatation at entry. The mean gestational age at delivery was the same in all three groups (35 weeks), as were neonatal outcomes. <b>Terbutaline</b> by pump, saline by pump, and oral <b>terbutaline</b> appear equivalent for the prevention of preterm delivery.

40|$|Pathophysiological {{studies have}} shown that the alveolocapillary {{transfer}} of small solutes is much faster in healthy smokers than in non-smokers. The effects of smoking on the pulmonary absorption of inhaled <b>terbutaline</b> were examined in normal subjects. Nine healthy smokers and 13 healthy non-smokers inhaled nebulised <b>terbutaline</b> and dry <b>terbutaline</b> powder on two study days. Plasma concentrations of <b>terbutaline</b> were measured up to 240 minutes after the inhalation. The plasma concentration of <b>terbutaline</b> rose much faster in smokers than in non-smokers, the mean time to peak <b>terbutaline</b> concentration being 17 minutes in the smokers and 50 minutes in the non-smokers. The peak plasma concentration was nearly twice as high in the smokers as in the non-smokers, being 21 mmol/l and 23 mmol/l for the dry powder inhalation and nebuliser respectively in the smokers and 12 mmol/l and 14 mmol/l in the non-smokers. It is concluded that smoking increases the rate of <b>terbutaline</b> absorption and the peak plasma concentration achieved.

(Day 8); and 3 After 8 days on oral <b>terbutaline</b> and 12 h after prednisone 100 mg orally (Day 10). The time course of the <b>terbutaline</b> concentrations and hypokalaemia was related using a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model.

The oral <b>terbutaline</b> treatment caused a 35 % increase in the distribution volume of SC <b>terbutaline.</b> After one week on oral <b>terbutaline</b> the concentration-effect relationship was shifted to the right and was steeper, with a higher EC 50 of <b>terbutaline</b> and higher values for the apparent threshold concentration. These observations are compatible with a decrease in receptor numbers after 7 days of <b>terbutaline</b> in a system characterised by the presence of spare receptors.
