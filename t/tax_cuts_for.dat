5|$|While Clinton {{had a solid}} base {{of support}} in New York City, {{candidates}} and observers expected the race to be decided in upstate New York where 45 percent of the state's voters live. During the campaign, Clinton vowed to improve the economic picture in upstate New York, promising that her plan would deliver 200,000 New York jobs over six years. Her plan included specific tax credits {{with the purpose of}} rewarding job creation and encouraging business investment, especially in the high-tech sector. She called for targeted personal <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> college tuition and long-term care.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} ballot on November 2, 2004, Boustany and Mount {{garnered}} the most votes; Cravins {{was defeated by}} less than two thousand votes. As both fell short of a majority, a second ballot was mandated. In the subsequent campaign, Mount criticized Boustany for favoring <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> the rich and being indifferent to health care, while Boustany rejected the attacks as false and stressed his willingness to work with Democrats and Independents. Boustany in turn portrayed Mount as liberal and favoring tax increases. Mount criticized Boustany for favoring the privatization of social security, an unpopular position in Louisiana, and as distant from the interests of individual voters. She received endorsements from U.S. Senator John Breaux, who had represented the 7th district for over fourteen years, and Governor Kathleen Blanco. Boustany was helped by Vice President Dick Cheney, who campaigned on his behalf in Lake Charles. Mount, however, was not endorsed by Democratic primary opponent Don Cravins, who complained about the state Democratic Party's endorsement of Mount in a partially party funded mailer that excluded him and which he believed contributed to his narrow loss. Cravins prepared a suit in federal court claiming that the state Democratic Party violated the Voting Rights Act.|$|E

25|$|The year 1999 {{was seen}} by the Social Democrats as the vindication for the tough fiscal {{policies}} pursued since they came to office in 1994: GDP growth was estimated at about 3.6%, well above the European average, inflation remained subdued, and the budget was in surplus {{for the first time}} in the 1990s. The party proposed income <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> 2000.|$|E
25|$|Major fiscal {{reforms were}} {{introduced}} in 2005 in order to tackle the informal sector which according to estimates represents somewhere between 30% to 60% of GDP. Significant <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> corporations were introduced {{for the first time}} in Egyptian history. The new Income tax Law No 91 for 2005 reduced the tax rate from 40% to 20%.

25|$|Democrats reacted {{positively}} to John Kerry's acceptance speech. With Democrats strongly {{opposed to the}} Bush administration, John Kerry {{spent most of his}} speech appealing to independent voters and to swing voters. He promised to train 40,000 new active duty troops, to implement all the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, to cut the national deficit in half within four years, to cut middle class taxes while repealing the Bush administration's <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> those making more than US$200,000 per year, to stop privatization of Social Security, and to expand stem cell research.|$|E
25|$|Obama {{increased}} {{taxes on}} high-income taxpayers via: a) expiration of the Bush income <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> the top 1–2% of income earners starting with 2013; and b) payroll tax increases on roughly the top 5% of earners {{as part of}} the ACA. This increased the average tax rate paid by the top 1% (incomes above $443,000 in 2015) from 28% in 2012 to 34% in 2013. According to the CBO, after-tax income inequality improved, by lowering the share of after-tax income received by the top 1% from 16.7% in 2007 to 15.1% in 2012 and to 12.4% in 2013.|$|E

25|$|The {{national}} debt increased from $10.0 trillion in September 2008 to $19.6 trillion in September 2016. As described above, roughly $3 trillion of this increase was anticipated in the January 2009 CBO baseline forecast, or $6-8 trillion adjusting for {{the extension of}} the Bush tax cuts and other baseline overrides typically legislated. Obama ultimately extended the Bush <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> approximately 98% of taxpayers as part of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, allowing taxes to rise on the top 1–2% of income earners. The debt held by the public (which excludes intra-governmental liabilities like the Social Security Trust Fund) rose from around 36% GDP in 2009 to 76% GDP in 2016, the highest level except for the post World War 2 era.|$|E
25|$|In 1921, Warren G Harding chose Mellon as his {{treasury}} secretary. Mellon {{would remain}} in office until 1932, serving under Harding, Calvin Coolidge, and Herbert Hoover, all three of whom {{were members of the}} Republican Party. Mellon sought to reduce federal taxation and debt. He favored cutting the federal estate tax as well as income taxes on top earners, though he also sought <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> all income levels. His policies were enacted by Congress in the Revenue Act of 1921, the Revenue Act of 1924, and the Revenue Act of 1926. The national debt dropped dramatically during the 1920s, though it would rise again after 1929. Mellon also participated in international agreements such as the Mellon–Berenger Agreement, which reduced French debts from World War I.|$|E
25|$|President Obama pledged {{before he}} was elected not to raise taxes except on those couples earning over $250,000 (200,000 for individuals). With the Bush tax cuts {{extension}} scheduled to expire in January 2013, President Obama had significant leverage with the Republican Congress, as his veto of further extensions {{would have resulted in}} a sizable income tax increase across the income spectrum, a significant expansion of government, but contrary to his pledge. His compromise, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA), passed by a wide majority in the Senate, with both Democrats and Republicans supporting it, while a majority of Republicans in the House opposed it. It extended the Bush <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> roughly the bottom 99% of income earners (those earning below $400,000, or $450,000 for married couples).|$|E
5000|$|Rep. Sander Levin (D-MI) said {{he would}} vote against the bill because he thinks [...] "voting {{permanent}} is counter-productive." [...] Levin thought the bill would increase the deficit.

25|$|A {{candidate}} debate held in Duluth {{featured a}} crowd that jeered Oberstar, with Oberstar {{calling for a}} more civil atmosphere at the next debate. The second debate centered on economic issues. Cravaack argued that the 2003 Bush <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> should be continued on all tax brackets to stimulate employment, and Oberstar said he would end the <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> the top two percent of earners, because the lowered tax had caused part of the deficit.|$|R
500|$|In December 2011, with a {{temporary}} payroll <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> set to expire {{at the end}} of the month, the Senate considered the Middle Class <b>Tax</b> <b>Cut</b> Act of 2011, which would extend the <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> <b>for</b> 113 million workers or families and fund the plan by a 3.25 percent surtax on incomes over $1 million. [...] Brown voted against proceeding to take up the bill (i.e., voted against cloture that would end the filibuster). [...] He announced that his opposition was to the surtax on high incomes.|$|R
25|$|Shortly after Obama's 2012 re-election, Congressional Republicans and Obama again faced {{off over}} the final fate of the Bush tax cuts. Republicans sought to make all tax cuts permanent, while Obama sought to extend the tax cuts only for those making under $250,000. Obama and Congressional Republicans came to an {{agreement}} on the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which made permanent the <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> individuals making less than $400,000 a year (or less than $450,000 for couples). For earnings greater than that amount, the income tax increased from 35% to 39.6%, which was the top rate before {{the passage of the}} Bush tax cuts. The deal also permanently indexed the alternative minimum tax for inflation, limited deductions for individuals making more than $250,000 ($300,000 for couples), permanently set the estate tax exemption at $5.12 million (indexed to inflation), and increased the top estate tax rate from 35% to 40%. Though many Republicans did not like the deal, the bill passed the Republican House in large part {{due to the fact that}} the failure to pass any bill would have resulted in the total expiration of the Bush tax cuts.|$|E

The Moderate Party started to focus more on calls for <b>tax</b> <b>cuts</b> <b>for</b> low- and middle-income groups, rather than on major tax cuts that would more benefit high-income earners.|$|E
500|$|President Obama's 2011 State of the Union Address {{focused on}} themes of {{education}} and innovation, stressing the importance of innovation economics to make the United States more competitive globally.

He promised that the United States would have one million electric vehicles on the road by 2015 and would be 80% reliant on [...] "clean" [...] electricity.|$|E
40|$|A {{capital income}} <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> must in general be financed by {{increasing}} other taxes, and thus will have redistributive effects. This paper studies analytically the redistribution implied by a capital income <b>tax</b> <b>cut</b> in the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans neoclassical growth model when agents differ in wealth and human capital and markets are frictionless. A few parameters affect the efficiency benefits and redistributive costs of capital taxation, {{and determine the}} set of agents who {{are in favor of}} a capital income <b>tax</b> <b>cut.</b> <b>For</b> plausible parameter values, a majority would lose from the <b>tax</b> <b>cut,</b> i. e. high capital taxes may be politically sustainable...|$|R
