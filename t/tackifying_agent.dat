40|$|BACKGROUND: Hydrocolloid wound {{dressings}} {{have been}} in use for nearly two decades, and have rarely caused allergic contact dermatitis. DuoDERM E (DuoDERM CGF) is a newer version of DuoDERM (ConvaTec Ltd, a division of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, Princeton, NJ) that contains a sensitizing derivative of colophony. OBJECTIVE: We describe three patients who developed eczematous lesions under this type of wound covering. METHODS: The patients were patch tested to the European standard series, to a glues and adhesives series, and to pieces of various adhesive dressings. RESULTS: The patients displayed positive patch tests to colophony and to DuoDERM E or DuoDERM CGF hydrocolloid dressings. CONCLUSION: These dressings contain the pentaerythritol ester of hydrogenated rosin as a <b>tackifying</b> <b>agent,</b> and this substance retains the sensitizing potential of colophony. The addition of this compound is an important change that may negatively alter the good safety record of ConvaTec dressings...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} years, {{hydrocolloid}} dressings {{have been introduced}} routinely {{in the treatment of}} various types of wounds. They provide a moist environment promoting autolytic debridement, and stimulate angiogenesis. However, long-term application often leads to inflammation of the skin in the immediate area of the ulcer, causing irritant dermatitis in many cases, but sometimes also leads to contact sensitization. A 32 year-old woman burnt herself by an iron, and presented to our clinic and was treated with Duoderm extrathin Ⓡ. Nine days later, she again presented with an erythematous oozing patch with edema, and allergic contact dermatitis was suspected. A patch test (TRUE test) was performed and a positive reaction to colophonium was obtained. Duoderm extrathin Ⓡ contains hydrogenated rosin (colophonium) as the <b>tackifying</b> <b>agent,</b> so we could diagnose this case as allergic contact dermatitis due to the hydrogenated rosin in Duoderm extrathin Ⓡ. We report another case of allergic contact dermatitis due to Duoderm extrathin Ⓡ in a 32 year-old woman. (Ann Dermatol 23 (S 3) S 387 ∼S 389...|$|E
40|$|This study {{concerns}} a 69 -year-old female {{patient with a}} longstanding history of venous ulcerations on both lower legs and multiple sensitivities, who developed eczematous lesions with the hydrocolloid dressing Combiderm (Convatec Ltd., a Bristol-Myers Squibb division, Ickenham, Middlesex, UK). Epicutaneous tests were positive to this dressing and to a modified colophonium derivative, i. e. glyceryl rosinate, however not to the unmodified colophonium from the standard series. A {{review of the literature}} showed several case reports about sensitization to similar hydrocolloids being distributed under various brand names in different countries and which contain the pentaerythritol ester of the hydrogenated rosin as the <b>tackifying</b> <b>agent.</b> Some of the patients described did, while others did not, react to colophonium but only to a modified derivative. In our patient, the reaction to glyceryl rosinate most probably represent cross-sensitivity with the modified colophonium derivative used in Combiderm, the presence (but not the exact nature) of which was showed by the company. In patients where allergic contact dermatitis from hydrocolloid dressings is strongly suspected and colophonium tests negatively, patch testing to modified colophonium derivatives should therefore be performed. As the complete composition of wound dressings is most often unknown, we urgently advocate legal requirements for labelling of those and in fact all medically used devices...|$|E
