50|$|<b>Tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate,</b> {{also known}} as vitamin E acetate, is a common vitamin {{supplement}} with the molecular formula C31H52O3 (for 'α' form). It is the ester of acetic acid and tocopherol (vitamin E). It is often used in dermatological products such as skin creams. <b>Tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate</b> is not oxidized and can penetrate through the skin to the living cells, where about 5% is converted to free tocopherol and provides beneficial antioxidant effects.|$|E

50|$|Proponents of megavitamin, orthomolecular, and {{naturally}} based therapies {{have for the}} last two thirds of a century advocated and used the natural tocopherols, often mixed tocopherols with an additional 25%-200% w/w d-beta-, d-gamma-, and d-delta-tocopherol. Studies on vitamin E have largely concentrated on use of either a synthetic all-racemic ("d, l-") alpha <b>tocopheryl</b> ester (<b>acetate</b> or succinate) or a semi-synthetic d-alpha <b>tocopheryl</b> ester (<b>acetate</b> or succinate).|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2002 The {{relative}} enrichment of skin {{sebaceous gland}} lipids with deuterium-labeled α-tocopherol was compared with plasma enrichment {{to evaluate the}} delivery of vitamin E to skin. For {{the first week of}} this study, each subject consumed a daily dose of deuterated vitamin E (150 mg of an equimolar mixture of RRR-α-[5 -(C²H₃) ]-(d₃) and all rac-α-[5, 7 -(C²H₃) ₂]-(d₆) <b>tocopheryl</b> <b>acetates)</b> with breakfast. Blood was drawn and skin lipids were collected daily for two weeks, then every other day for the following two weeks. Labeled and unlabeled vitamin E analysis was carried out using liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Skin cholesterol, plasma cholesterol and triglycerides were measured to evaluate changes in vitamin E levels relative to lipid content. While d₃ and d₆-α-tocopherols were found in plasma 24 h after the first dose, d₃-α-tocopherol was only detected in the skin sebaceous gland secretions after 1 week of supplementation. This data suggests a skin-mediated delivery system for vitamin E into skin lipid secretions. This finding is also supported by the observation that the ratio of α-to γ-tocopherol was greater in the skin than in the plasma...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2008 In rats, sesame lignans {{increase}} plasma γ-tocopherol concentrations and inhibit γ-tocopherol degradation to its metabolite γ-carboxyethylhydroxychroman (γ-CEHC). To test if sesame lignan consumption inhibits γ- tocopherol metabolism in humans, muffins {{prepared with}} either corn oil (control) or sesame oil and an equimolar mixture of deuterium labeled d 6 -α- and d 2 -γ- <b>tocopheryl</b> <b>acetates</b> {{were administered to}} male (n= 5) and female (n= 5) volunteers. Tocopherol and CEHC concentrations were followed for 72 h. Sesame lignan consumption significantly increased plasma d 2 -γ-TOH concentrations (p< 0. 05). In men, sesame lignans increased plasma d 2 -γ-tocopherol areas under the curve (AUC; sesame oil: 34. 3 ± 4. 6; corn oil: 28. 9 ± 3. 3 μmol/L·h, p< 0. 01) and reduced d 2 -γ-CEHC AUCs (p< 0. 05). In men, differences in urinary d 2 -γ-CEHC AUCs did not reach statistical significance (AUCs for 24 h, corn oil: 11. 2 ± 3. 0 μmol/g creatinine·h; vs sesame oil: 5. 0 ± 1. 5). In women, sesame lignan consumption did not alter plasma tocopherol CEHC concentrations but reduced urinary d 2 -γ-CEHC excretion (AUCs for 24 h, corn oil: 19. 3 ± 4. 9 μmol/g creatinine·h; and sesame oil: 7. 7 ± 2. 0, p < 0. 05).

40|$|The non{{competitive}} {{and competitive}} hydrolyses of (2 R, 4 'R, 8 'R) - 3 ̆b 1 -tocopheryl acetate (RRR- 3 ̆b 1 -TOAc, the acetate of natural vitamin E) and (2 S, 4 'R, 8 'R) - 3 ̆b 1 -tocopheryl acetate (SRR- 3 ̆b 1 -TOAc) catalyzed by crude and pure bovine cholesterol esterase (BCE) and crude and pure porcine cholesterol esterase (PCE) {{have been studied}} at 37 0 C. These two CE's are catalytically active toward <b>tocopheryl</b> <b>acetates</b> only {{in the presence of}} bile salts. The three 33 ̆b 1, 73 ̆b 1, 123 ̆b 1 -trihydroxy bile salts, cholate, glycocholate and taurocholate, not only are effective activators of BCE and PCE, but also modulate the diastereoselectivities of these two enzymes in their hydrolyses of RRR- and SRR- 3 ̆b 1 -TOAc in a characteristic manner. Rates of hydrolyses were much faster {{in the presence of a}} small quantity of dl- or l-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) than in its absence. However, for each enzyme, the direction and even the magnitude of the diastereoselectivity is primarily determined by the bile salt employed and not by the presence or nature of the co-lipid (DMPC or sodium oleate), nor by the bile salt/co-lipid ratio, nor by the purity of the enzyme. In noncompetitive experiments, the ratios of the BCE-catalyzed initial rates of hydrolyses of the diastereomeric acetates, V(i) (RRR) /V(i) (SRR), are 0. 21, 1. 5, and 2. 7 for cholate, glycocholate, and taurocholate, respectively, and for the PCE-catalyzed noncompetitive reactions, 0. 21, 7. 9, and 7. 5 for the same three bile salts. In competitive experiments using equal concentrations of RRR- and SRR- 3 ̆b 1 -TOAc, the BCE-catalyzed initial rate ratios are 0. 33, 0. 94, and 2. 2, and for the PCE-catalyzed competitive reactions, 0. 21, 1. 1, and 1. 8 for cholate, glycocholate, and taurocholate, respectively. The lower diastereoselectivities found in some of the competitive experiments are tentatively attributed to competitive inhibition of the enzyme by one of the diastereomeric acetates or, more probably, its phenolic product. Glycochenodeoxycholate, a 33 ̆b 1, 73 ̆b 1 -dihydroxy bile salt, activates PCE but not BCE. With the former enzyme, the diastereoselectivities, V(i) (RRR) /V(i) (SRR) are rather similar for the noncompetitive and competitive experiments, viz., 11 and 8. 0, respectively, and the reaction rates are comparable to those found with the trihydroxy bile salts. Since the detailed composition of the bile salt/co-lipid mixed micelle does not determine V(i) (RRR) /V(i) (SRR) ratios, we conclude that diastereoselectivities are not determined by the precise surface structure of the micelle. Presumably, the bile salts modulate the diastereoselectivities of BCE and PCE by a direct effect on the protein which may involve 'refolding' the enzyme with a consequent change in the shape of the active site. It should be noted that the relevant chiral carbon in 3 ̆b 1 -TOAc is separated by six bonds from the bond which is broken and that this chiral center must exert its influence prior to the rate-limiting step in the overall hydrolysis. If the bile salt modulating effect on CE-catalyzed reactions is to be exploited in organic syntheses, it is the competitive experiments which are the more important, and for these, the diastereoselectivity, V(i) (RRR) /V(i) (SSR), varies from a low of 0. 21 for the cholate/PCE couple to a high of 8. 0 for the glycochenodeoxycholate/PCE couple. Such a dramatic 40 -fold change in an enzyme's chiral selectivity is without precedent. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

40|$|The {{bioactivity}} of the acetate of the all-racemic, 1 -thio analog of a-tocopherol (all-rac-]-thio- 3 ̆b 1 <b>tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate)</b> {{has been}} determined by measuring its ability to decrease plasma levels of pyruvate kinase in vitamin E deficient rats using the curative myopathy bioassay. The thio analog is only 0. 22 times as active as RRR- 3 ̆b 1 <b>tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate</b> and is therefore approximately 0. 33 times as active as all-rac- 3 ̆b 1 <b>tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate,</b> since the latter {{has been shown to}} be 1. 47 times less active than RRR- 3 ̆b 1 <b>tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate</b> in the same bioassay (H. Weiser, M. Vecchi and M. Schlachter, Internal. J. Vit. Nutr. Res. 55 149 - 158 (1985)). The 0. 33 : 1. 0 ratio is similar to the ratio of 0. 41 : 1. 0 measured for the in vitro antioxidant activities of the corresponding free phenols. This finding lends further support to our view that the vitamin E activity in the curative myopathy bioassay of close structural analogs of 3 ̆b 1 tocopherol is determined primarily by the in vitro antioxidant activity of the analog relative to 3 ̆b 1 tocopherol, consistent with the belief that vitamin E functions primarily as a general purpose, lipid-soluble antioxidant in mammals. 9 1990 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

40|$|Background: In adults, RRR [...] <b>tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate</b> (natural vitamin E) has {{approximately}} {{twice the}} biological activity of all-rac [...] tocopherol (synthetic vitamin E). Similar studies {{have not been}} done in term infants. Objective: We evaluated the vitamin E and antioxidant status of term infants fed formulas differing in the amount and form of vitamin E acetate. Design: A controlled, blinded, multisite study was completed with 77 term infants randomly assigned to 1 of 3 different infant-for-mula groups. The HIGHNAT-E formula (n = 26) contained 20 IU RRR [...] tocopheryl acetate/L (14. 5 mg/L), the LOWNAT-E for-mula (n = 25) contained 10 IU RRR [...] tocopheryl acetate/L (7. 3 mg/L), and the SYN-E formula (n = 26) contained 13. 5 IU synthetic all-rac [...] tocopheryl acetate/L (13. 5 mg/L). A human milk–fed group (n = 29) served as a reference. Results: Although the LOWNAT-E formula contained only one-half the concentration of -tocopherol that the SYN-E formula did (7. 3 compared with 13. 5 mg/L), the infants fed the LOWNAT-E formula had plasma -tocopherol concentrations that {{were not significantly different}} from those of the infants fed the SYN-E for-mula. However, -tocopherol intakes in the study population, when expressed as mg 2 R-tocopherol isomers consumed/d, corre-lated with plasma -tocopherol (r = 0. 20, P = 0. 02) and the ratio of plasma -tocopherol to lipids (r = 0. 19, P = 0. 03). There were no significant differences in antioxidant status between the 3 groups, but the LOWNAT-E group showed a trend toward lower plasma isoprostanes. Conclusions: This study supports the new definition for vitamin E given in the 2000 Dietary Reference Intakes and suggests that infants discriminate between RRR [...] <b>tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate</b> and all-rac [...] <b>tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate.</b> All 3 infant formulas supported ade-quate vitamin E status.

A lipoprotein lipase-deficient patient and a patient with prolonged production of chylomicrons with absent apolipoprotein B- 100 also demonstrated the lack of discrimination between tocopherols during absorption.

One possible explanation for these findings was that the tissue stores of tocopherol were depleted as the consequence of an antecedent dietary deficiency, and that the low concentrations in the feces and the relatively flat tolerance curves were indicative of greater absorption and more rapid transfer of tocopherol from the intestina...|$|E
40|$|Five {{subjects}} ingested in {{a single}} oral dose containing 50 mg each of 2 R, 4 'R, 8 'R-alpha-(5, 7 -(C 2 H 3) 2) <b>tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate</b> (d 6 -RRR-alpha-tocopheryl acetate) with natural stereochemistry, and of 2 S, 4 'R, 8 'R-alpha-(5 -C 2 H 3) <b>tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate</b> (d 3 -SRR-alpha-tocopheryl acetate). These are two of eight stereoisomers in synthetic vitamin E. By day 1 the plasma and red blood cells were enriched fourfold with d 6 -RRR-alpha-tocopherol (P less than 0. 004). The ratio of d 6 -RRR-/d 2 -SRR- further increased over the succeeding 4 days, because the d 3 -SRR- decreased {{at a faster rate}} than did the d 6 -RRR-stereoisomer. Plasma and lipoproteins were isolated at intervals during the first day, and daily for 3 days, from four additional subjects fed a mixture of equal amounts of the deuterated tocopherols. The plasma contained similar concentrations of the two forms until 11 h, when the d 6 -RRR-alpha-tocopherol concentration became significantly greater (P less than 0. 05). The chylomicrons contained similar concentrations of the two deuterated tocopherols, but the VLDL (very low density lipoproteins) became preferentially enriched in d 6 -RRR-alpha-tocopherol by 11 h. The pattern of the deuterated tocopherols shows that during chylomicron catabolism all of the plasma lipoproteins were labeled equally with both tocopherols, but that during the subsequent VLDL catabolism the low and high density lipoproteins became enriched in d 6 -RRR-alpha-tocopherol. These results suggest the existence of a mechanism in the liver for assembling VLDL preferentially enriched in RRR- relative to SRR-alpha-tocopherol. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E

For a positive control, commercial product (expressed as a control product in this work), a Atopalm® mile cream (ATOPALM, Daejeon, Korea) {{was used in the}} experiments, and the composition of major components was as follows: glycerin, propanediol, myristoyl, capric tryglyceride, polyglyceryl- 10 distearate, glyceryl stearate, cetearyl alcohol, grape seed oil (3 %, v/v), jojoba seed oil, Portulacae Herba extract (5 %, v/v), sorbitan stearate, olive oil, hydrogenated vegetable oil, phytosterol, sodium hyaluronate (1 %, w/v), <b>tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate,</b> allantoin, stearic acid, carbomer, arginine, dimethicone, 1, 2 -hexanediol, and caprylyl glycol, tropolone, etc.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Experiments were {{conducted}} to evaluate the utilization of dl-a-tocopherol, dl-a-tocopheryl acetate and a water-soluble ester, d-a-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 (TPGS), as dietary sources of vitamin E for the chick. Results showed that <b>tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate</b> is utilized with efficiency {{equal to that of}} vitamin E alcohol at dietary concentrations {{less than or equal to}} approximately 40 ml dl-a-tocopherol equivalents per kg. At greater dietary concentrations of the vitamin, the alcohol form appeared to be better utilized than the acetate when it was adequately stabilized in the diet. However, TPGS was poorly utilized at all dietary levels examined. Saponification of both esters improved the utilization of vitamin E from these sources. The utilization of all forms of vitamin E was depressed in hypervitaminotic A chicks and, to a lesser extent, in chicks fed ethoxyquin...|$|E
40|$|In {{view of the}} {{increase}} in the number of cosmetic preparations containing antioxidant vitamins, chiefly, due to their action in preventing the process of skin aging, there is a need to develop pre-formulation studies and to validate analytical methods in order to obtain high quality products. Thus, the objective of this research was to evaluate and compare the thermal behavior of <b>tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate</b> and ascorbyl tetraisopalmitate as raw materials, and incorporated into a base cream. Thermogravimetry (TG / DTG) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used for this purpose. Both vitamins were found to be stable up to 250 ºC. The base cream (placebo) and the sample (base cream containing the vitamins) presented different weight loss. Thermal analysis has shown itself to be an excellent tool for the characterization of these vitamins and can be used in routine analysis for quality control of this type of cosmetic formulation...|$|E
40|$|In vitro models {{based on}} human {{physiology}} {{have been developed}} as simple, inexpensive and reproducible tools to predict the bioavailability of different food components. Our aim {{was to assess the}} applicability of an in vitro digestion model to estimate the bioaccessibility of fat-soluble vitamins contained in commercially available liquid milk. For vitamin A, the rate and degree of hydrolysis of both endogenous and synthetic ester forms varied according to the type of milk (skimmed versus whole), although the amount of free retinol transferred into micelles was equivalent. For vitamin E, there was apparently no hydrolysis of <b>tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate</b> contained in fortified whole milk, while it was incomplete in the skimmed milk. Overall, in vitro results appear consistent with in vivo observations supporting the potential applicability and predictive value of the in vitro approach to assess the bioavailability of fat-soluble vitamins from dairy matrices.

40|$|Cch 1 p and Mid 1 p are {{components}} of a high-affinity Ca 2 +-permeable channel in the yeast plasma membrane. Here, we show that growth of mutants in the Cch 1 pMid 1 p channel is markedly hypersensitive to low temperature and to high iron concentration in the medium. Both phenotypes were suppressed by high Ca 2 + concentration. Iron stress elicited an increased Ca 2 + influx into both wild type and cch 1 Δmid 1 Δ yeast. Inhibition of calcineurin strongly depressed growth of iron-stressed wild type yeast, indicating that calcineurin is a downstream element of the iron stress response. Iron hypersensitivity of the cch 1 Δmid 1 Δ mutant {{was not associated with}} an increased iron uptake. An involvement of oxidative stress in the iron-hypersensitive phenotype was indicated by the findings that the antioxidants <b>tocopheryl</b> <b>acetate</b> and (ethyl) glutathione improved growth and viability of the iron-stressed mutant. Further, the degree of glutathione oxidation was increased in the presence of iron. The results indicate that iron stress leads to an increased oxidative poise and that Cch 1 pMid 1 p is essential to tolerate this condition...|$|E
