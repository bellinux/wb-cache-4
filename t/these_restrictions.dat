5|$|In 2015 Massachusetts banned catching, cage diving, feeding, towing decoys, or baiting and chumming for its {{significant}} and highly predictable migratory great white population without an appropriate research permit. The goal of <b>these</b> <b>restrictions</b> is to both protect the sharks and public health.|$|E
5|$|However, {{potentially}} severe {{restrictions on}} free speech, {{some of which}} are elaborated upon below, may act as a disincentive to people expressing political views. <b>These</b> <b>restrictions</b> inevitably have a bearing on how representative democracy is upheld, and have also been said to impact the content of free speech as opposition parties are tempered by the fear of defamation suits.|$|E
5|$|Under the UPA {{government}} that preceded Modi's administration, field trials of Genetically Modified (GM) crops had essentially {{been put on}} hold, after protests from farmers fearing for their livelihoods. Under the Modi government <b>these</b> <b>restrictions</b> were gradually lifted. The government received some criticism for freezing the bank accounts of environmental group Greenpeace, citing financial irregularities, although a leaked government report said that the freeze {{had to do with}} Greenpeace's opposition to GM crops.|$|E
50|$|The {{mammalian}} DNA {{does not}} come with <b>these</b> <b>restriction</b> sites, so they are built in by overlap extension PCR. The primers are designed to put the restriction sites carefully, so that the coding of the protein is in-frame, and a minimum of extra amino acids is implanted {{on either side of}} the protein.|$|R
50|$|This is a PCR based method. Cassette {{mutagenesis}} {{begins with}} the synthesis of a DNA cassette containing the gene of interest, which is flanked on either side by restriction sites. The endonuclease which cleaves <b>these</b> <b>restriction</b> sites also cleaves sites in the target plasmid. The DNA cassette and the target plasmid are both treated with endonucleases to cleave <b>these</b> <b>restriction</b> sites and create sticky ends. Next the products from this cleavage are ligated together, resulting in the insertion of the gene into the target plasmid. An alternative form of cassette mutagenesis called combinatorial cassette mutagenesis is used to identify the functions of individual amino acid residues in the protein of interest. Recursive ensemble mutagenesis then utilizes information from previous combinatorial cassette mutagenesis. Codon cassette mutagenesis allows you to insert or replace a single codon at a particular site in double stranded DNA.|$|R

5|$|In {{an effort}} to improve air quality, the city placed {{restrictions}} on construction sites and gas stations, and limited the use of commercial and passenger vehicles in Beijing. From 20 June through 20 September, passenger vehicle restrictions were placed on alternate days depending on the terminal digit of the car's license plate. It was anticipated that this measure would take 45% of Beijing's 3.3million cars off the streets. The boosted public transport network was expected to absorb the demand created by <b>these</b> <b>restrictions</b> and the influx of visitors, which was estimated at more than 4million additional passengers per day.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, Banagher was {{the centre}} of a flourishing woollen trade. In 1699, the impost placed on the export of woollen goods to England {{practically}} killed the woollen trade. At {{the outbreak of the}} American Revolutionary War in 1775, an embargo placed on the export of foodstuffs to the American Colonies dealt another blow to the trade of Banagher. In 1780, the British Parliament withdrew all <b>these</b> <b>restrictions</b> and Banagher's economy began to improve rapidly.|$|E
5|$|In the {{tradition}} of Pentecostalism, female members of La Luz del Mundo do not wear jewelery or makeup and are instructed to wear full, long skirts. Women can have their hair as short as their shoulder blades. <b>These</b> <b>restrictions</b> {{do not apply to}} recreational activities, where wearing bathing suits is permitted. Women wear a head covering during religious meetings. According to an interview of one adherent, women in the Church are considered equal to men in social spheres and have equal capacities for obtaining higher education, social careers, and other goals that may interest them.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike other endonucleases, the MmeI (type IIS) and EcoP15I (type III) {{restriction}} endonucleases cut downstream {{of their}} target binding sites. MmeI cuts 18/20 base pairs downstream [...] and EcoP15I cuts 25/27 base pairs downstream. As <b>these</b> <b>restriction</b> enzymes bind at their target sequences {{located in the}} adaptors, they cut and release vectors that contain short sequences of the fragment or cDNA ligated to them, producing PETs.|$|R
5|$|Prior to the statute's {{enactment}} in 1710, copying {{restrictions were}} {{authorized by the}} Licensing of the Press Act 1662. <b>These</b> <b>restrictions</b> were enforced by the Stationers' Company, a guild of printers given the exclusive power to print—and the responsibility to censor—literary works. The censorship administered under the Licensing Act led to public protest; as the act had to be renewed at two-year intervals, authors and others sought to prevent its reauthorisation. In 1694, Parliament refused to renew the Licensing Act, ending the Stationers' monopoly and press restrictions.|$|E
5|$|The Constitution did allow {{followers}} of other, non-Catholic, faiths {{to practice their}} religious beliefs, albeit only in private. The construction of non-Catholic religious buildings was forbidden. From the outset <b>these</b> <b>restrictions</b> were ignored by both the citizenry and authorities. In Belém, Pará's capital, the first synagogue was built in 1824. Jews migrated to Brazil soon after its independence and settled mainly in the northeastern provinces of Bahia and Pernambuco and in the northern provinces of Amazonas and Pará. Other Jewish groups came from the Alsace-Lorraine region of Germany and from Russia. By the 1880s, there were several Jewish communities and synagogues scattered throughout Brazil.|$|E
5|$|The Nclass {{was also}} {{successful}} on the Central section, where they worked alongside L. B. Billinton's LB K class 2-6-0s. However the large cylinder and cab sizes of the Nclass prevented {{use of the}} type on the Eastern section's TonbridgeHastings line. The route's narrow bridges and tunnels were unable to accommodate the class, and provided justification for using the narrower 3-cylinder N1 class 2-6-0 on the route. Despite <b>these</b> <b>restrictions,</b> the class was capable of hauling heavy loads at moderate speeds, a useful attribute that was exploited throughout the Second World War. The entire class came into British Railways' ownership in 1948 and {{could be seen in}} most areas of the Southern Region.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{several questions}} about restriction of representations of classical and metaplectic groups over {{local and global}} fields to subgroups, extending considerably {{the scope of the}} earlier work on $SO(n),SO(n- 1) $. This includes Bessel and Fourier-Jacobi models too. We formulate several conjectures about <b>these</b> <b>restriction</b> problems involving root numbers of symplectic representations in the local case, and central critical L-value in the global case. Along the way we prove several results both in number theory and representation theory. Comment: 112 page...|$|R

In the future, the more restriction enzyme sites will be introduced to the pBD 003 for cloning convenience. However, <b>these</b> <b>restriction</b> sites immediately after the 35 S promoter must be removed by site-directed mutagenesis because the non-viral sequence between the 35 S promoter and 5 ′-end in viral RNA affects the initial infectivity (Lin et al., 2002; Maiss et al., 1992; Shi et al., 1997).|$|R

5|$|The RMNDH {{was only}} a small part of the armed forces of the NDH, largely due to {{restrictions}} imposed by Italy. To avoid <b>these</b> <b>restrictions,</b> the Germans raised the Croatian Naval Legion which fought as part of the German Navy in the Black Sea campaign between 1941 and 1944. After the Italian capitulation in September 1943, the Germans transferred several captured Italian vessels to the RMNDH, although all of the significant ones had been lost by December 1944 when the remaining personnel were assigned to duties ashore to circumvent their defection to the Yugoslav Partisans. The RMNDH was disbanded in May 1945 with the collapse and defeat of the NDH.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{cancelled}} the Boeing 2707, its rival {{supersonic transport}} programme, in 1971. Observers {{have suggested that}} opposition to Concorde on grounds of noise pollution had been encouraged by the United States Government, as it lacked its own competitor. The US, India, and Malaysia all ruled out Concorde supersonic flights over the noise concern, although some of <b>these</b> <b>restrictions</b> were later relaxed. Professor Douglas Ross characterised restrictions placed upon Concorde operations by President Jimmy Carter's administration as having been an act of protectionism of American aircraft manufacturers. Concorde flew to an altitude of 68,000ft (20,700m) during a test flight in June 1973.|$|E
5|$|Although some of <b>these</b> <b>restrictions</b> {{were later}} {{loosened}} or rescinded, Johnson (with McNamara's support) kept a tight rein on the campaign, which continuously infuriated the American military commanders, right-wing members of Congress, {{and even some}} within the administration itself. One of the primary objectives of the operation, {{at least to the}} military, should have been the closure of Haiphong and other ports by aerial mining, thereby slowing or halting the flow of seaborne supplies entering the north. President Johnson refused to take such a provocative action, however, and such an operation was not implemented until 1972. There was also little consultation between Johnson and the military chiefs during the target selection process. Even the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Earl G. Wheeler, was not present for most of the critical discussions of 1965 and participated only occasionally thereafter.|$|E

25|$|Adenine or {{cytosine}} methylation {{is part of}} {{the restriction}} modification system of many bacteria, in which specific DNA sequences are methylated periodically throughout the genome. A methylase is the enzyme that recognizes a specific sequence and methylates one of the bases in or near that sequence. Foreign DNAs (which are not methylated in this manner) that are introduced into the cell are degraded by sequence-specific restriction enzymes and cleaved. Bacterial genomic DNA is not recognized by <b>these</b> <b>restriction</b> enzymes. The methylation of native DNA acts as a sort of primitive immune system, allowing the bacteria to protect themselves from infection by bacteriophage.|$|R
5|$|As a crop, the {{blackcurrant}} {{suffers from}} several pests and diseases. The most serious disease is reversion, {{caused by a}} virus transmitted by the blackcurrant gall mite. Another is {{white pine blister rust}} which alternates between two unrelated hosts, one in the genus Ribes (blackcurrant included) and the other a white pine. This fungus caused damage to forests when the fruit was first introduced into North America, where the native white pines have no genetic resistance to the disease. As a result, the blackcurrant has for most of the 20th century been subject to restrictions in parts of the United States as a disease vector. The effectiveness of <b>these</b> <b>restrictions</b> is questionable, since other Ribes species also host the disease and are native to North America.|$|E
5|$|Due to <b>these</b> <b>restrictions,</b> Shazly {{supported}} a limited war to retake only {{the east bank}} of the canal, as opposed to Sadek. However, Sadek authorized the planning of two offensive plans, starting in July 1971. The first was Operation 41, which involved an offensive along the entire Suez Canal {{with the objective of}} seizing the key passes of the Sinai. The plan was developed in cooperation with Soviet advisers. As it was, the objectives of the operation were outside the capabilities of the Egyptian military and Shazly saw it only as a means of inducing the Soviets to supply more arms and equipment. The plan would also encourage the Syrians to join in an attack against Israel. Operation 41 was completed by September 1971, and the following month, Sadat and Sadek flew to Moscow to conclude Egypt's largest arms deal yet, receiving 100 MiG-21 fighters, 10 Tu-16 bombers, SA-6 anti-aircraft (AA) missiles and heavy artillery. Operation 41 was renamed Granite Two.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Lough Mask before the {{controversy}} began, Boycott had become unpopular with the tenants. He had become a magistrate and was an Englishman, which {{may have contributed to}} his unpopularity, but according to Marlow it was due more to his personal temperament. While Boycott himself maintained that he was on good terms with his tenants, they said that he had laid down many petty restrictions, such as not allowing gates to be left open and not allowing hens to trespass on his property, and that he fined anyone who transgressed <b>these</b> <b>restrictions.</b> He had also withdrawn privileges from the tenants, such as collecting wood from the estate. In August 1880, his labourers went on strike in a dispute over a wage increase.|$|E
50|$|Finally, {{according}} to the Constitution and some later rules created by the Brazilian Imperial House, the princes {{in the line of}} succession must marry with members of other dynastic houses {{in order to keep the}} égalite de naissance to maintain their imperial titles. A princess who marries the head of another dynastic house would not transmit her Brazilian titles to their offspring, and the princes could not assume a foreign throne and keep their Brazilian titles. <b>These</b> <b>restriction</b> are aligned to Portuguese and French royal traditions, although the Brazilian rules of succession are not directed by Salic Law.|$|R

5|$|Following the C-5 crash, {{and with}} the cause still unknown, the C-5 fleet was {{grounded}} and the MAC airlift was reduced to using C-141s and C-130s; rather than loading as many evacuees as possible, each evacuee required a seat and a seatbelt, {{reducing the number of}} passengers that could be carried on each flight. Each C-141 would carry 94 passengers while each C-130 would carry 75, although <b>these</b> <b>restrictions</b> were relaxed, and then ignored altogether as the pace of the evacuation quickened. Armed guards were also present on each flight to prevent the possibility of hijacking. American commercial and contract carriers continued to fly out of Tan Son Nhut, but with decreasing frequency. In addition, military aircraft from Australia, Indonesia, Iran, Poland, UK, France, and other countries flew in to evacuate their embassy personnel.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, oaths {{were taken}} very seriously. As King, James was Head of the Church of Scotland or Kirk, sworn by his Coronation Oath to {{preserve}} its position and privileges. The Test Act required government officials and MPs to swear an Oath of Allegiance to the Protestant religion and the monarch, regardless of personal religion. James thus received their support despite his own Catholicism but promised not to diminish {{the primacy of the}} Church of Scotland. Removing <b>these</b> <b>restrictions</b> was seen as contrary to that commitment. Many MPs were also members of the Episcopalian minority imposed on the Kirk in 1661; Argyll's defeat showed the weakening of Presbyterian influence but voting for these measures would undo that. James' credibility was seriously damaged, since he appeared willing to ignore his previous commitments, his Coronation Oath and his most loyal supporters.|$|E
