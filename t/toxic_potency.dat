50|$|Humans and {{wildlife}} are rarely exposed to solitary contaminants, {{but rather to}} complex mixtures of potentially harmful compounds. Dioxins and DLCs are no exception. This {{is important to consider}} when assessing toxicity because the effects of chemicals in a mixture are often different from when acting alone. These differences can take place on the chemical level, where the properties of the compounds themselves change due to the interaction, creating a new dose at the target tissue and a quantitatively different effect. They may also act together (simple similar action) or independently on the organism at the receptor during uptake, when transported throughout the body, or during metabolism, to produce a joint effect. Joint effects are described as being additive (using dose, response/risk, or measured effect), synergistic, or antagonistic. A dose-additive response occurs when the mixture effect is determined by the sum of the component chemical doses, each weighted by its relative <b>toxic</b> <b>potency.</b> A risk-additive response occurs when the mixture response is the sum of component risks, based on the probability law of independent events. An effect-additive mixture response occurs when the combined effect of exposure a chemical mixture is equal to the sums of the separate component chemical effects, e.g., incremental changes in relative liver weight. Synergism occurs when the combined effect of chemicals together is greater than the additivity prediction based on their separate effects. Antagonism describes where the combined effect is less than the additive prediction. Clearly it is important to identify which kind of additivity is being used. These effects reflect the underlying modes of action and mechanisms of toxicity of the chemicals.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Toxic {{effects of}} many {{persistent}} organic pollutants (e. g., polychlorinated biphenyls or polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans) are mediated via the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Although polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their derivatives also activate AhR, their toxic effects remain to be fully elucidated. In the present study, we used the in vitro H 4 IIE-luc transactivation cell assay to investigate cytotoxicity and potencies to activate AhR by 29 individual PAHs and their N-heterocyclic derivatives (aza-PAHs). The aza-PAHs {{were found to be}} significantly more cytotoxic and more potent inducers of AhR than their unsubstituted analogues. Several aza-PAHs, such as dibenz[a,h]acridine or dibenz[a,i]acridine, activated AhR within picomolar concentrations, comparable to the effects of reference 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. Ellipsoidal volume, molar refractivity, and molecular size were the most important descriptors derived from the modeling of quantitative structure–activity relationships for potencies to activate AhR. Comparable relative <b>toxic</b> <b>potencies</b> (induction equivalency factors) for individual aza-PAHs are derived, and their use for evaluation of complex contaminated samples is discussed.

40|$|An {{approach}} to predict acute aquatic toxicity, {{in the form}} of a quantitative structure-activity-activity relationship (QSAAR), is described. This study assessed relative toxic effects to fish Pimephales promelas, and a ciliate Tetrahymena pyriformis, and attempted to form relationships between tem. A good agreement between <b>toxic</b> <b>potencies</b> (R 2 = 0. 754) was found for a chemically diverse dataset of 364 compounds, when using toxicity to ciliate as a surrogate for that for fish. This relationship was extended by adding three theoretical structural descriptors of the molecules. The inclusion of these descriptors improved the relationship further (R 2 = 0. 824). The structural features that were found to improve the extrapolation between the toxicity to the two different species were related to the electron distribution of the carbon skeleton of the toxicant, its hydrogen-bonding ability, and its relative nitrogen content. Such a QSAAR approach provides a potential tool to predict the toxicities of chemicals for environmental risk assessment and thus for reducing animal tests. JRC.

The five major alkaloid constituents in goldenseal are berberine, palmatine, hydrastine, hydrastinine, and canadine. When goldenseal was evaluated by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) in the standard 2 -year bioassay, goldenseal induced an increase in liver tumors in rats and mice; however, the mechanism of goldenseal-associated liver carcinogenicity remains unknown. In this study, the toxicity of the five goldenseal alkaloid constituents was characterized, and their <b>toxic</b> <b>potencies</b> were compared. As measured by the Comet assay and the expression of γ-H 2 A. X, berberine, followed by palmatine, appeared to be the most potent DNA damage inducer in human hepatoma HepG 2 cells. Berberine and palmatine suppressed the activities of both topoisomerase (Topo) I and II. In berberine-treated cells, DNA damage was shown to be directly associated with the inhibitory effect of Topo II, but not Topo I by silencing gene of Topo I or Topo II. In addition, DNA damage was also observed when cells were treated with commercially available goldenseal extracts and the extent of DNA damage was positively correlated to the berberine content. Our findings suggest that the Topo II inhibitory effect may contribute to berberine- and goldenseal-induced genotoxicity and tumorigenicity...|$|R

Plants were treated with 7 or 10 levels of As to establish concentration-effect curves. Median effective concentration and 10 % effective concentration values were derived with regression analysis to measure As <b>toxic</b> <b>potencies,</b> and no-observed-effect concentration was determined by comparison with a control to elucidate thresholds of As to the two plant species. The median effective concentration values for As varied from 159 to 683 mg/kg for wheat and 59 to 426 mg/kg for lettuce, and the 10 % effective concentration values varied from 79 to 270 mg/kg for wheat and 20 to 156 mg/kg for lettuce. The result suggests that lettuce is a more sensitive species for monitoring soil As contamination. With the same level of As spiked, soil toxicity for a plant showed a tendency of fluvoaquic soil toward red soil or black soil toward paddy soil.

40|$|Here, {{we present}} a novel model to predict the {{toxicity}} and bioavailability of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) as model compounds based on a first principles approach targeting basic electronic characteristics.

The model clearly explains why chlorination of both para positions is required for maximum <b>toxic</b> <b>potency.</b> To rank <b>toxic</b> <b>potency,</b> the dipole moment in relation to the most chemically active Cl-sites was critical. This finding was consistent with the accepted toxic equivalency factor (TEF) model for these molecules, and was also able to improve on ranking <b>toxic</b> <b>potency</b> of PCBs with similar TEFs.

Cation accumulation (νi in mol g- 1) is estimated through calculations with the WHAM chemical speciation model by assuming that organism binding sites can be represented by those of humic acid. Toxicity coefficients (αi) are combined with νi to obtain the variable FTOX (= ∑ αiνi) which, between lower and upper thresholds (FTOX,LT, FTOX,UT), is linearly related to toxic effect. Values of αi, FTOX,LT and FTOX,LT are obtained by fitting toxicity data. Reasonable fits (72 % of variance in toxic effect explained overall) were obtained for four large metal mixture acute toxicity experiments involving daphnids (Cu, Zn, Cd), lettuce (Cu, Zn, Ag) and trout (Zn, Cd, Pb). Strong non-additive effects, most apparent in results for tests involving Cd, could be explained approximately by purely chemical competition for metal accumulation. Tentative interpretation of parameter values obtained from these and other experimental data suggests the following order of bound cation toxicity: H < Al < (Cu Zn Pb UO 2) < (Cd Ag).

The total phenolic content was also determined and expressed in gallic acid equivalent (mg of GAE/g of sample). A great variance was observed for polyphenol content as well as antioxidant activity (1. 574 - 9. 4136 mg GAE/g and DPPH IC 50 10. 52 - 31. 25 μg/ml) depending on the nature of solvent used to fractionate the crude extract.

The compounds studied were phthalic anhydride, di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate, butyl benzyl phthalate, diallyl phthalate, di(2 ethylhexyl) adipate, tris(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphate, and 2 -ethylhexyl sulfate (sodium salt). Estimated maximum tolerable doses and fractionally lower doses of each compound were administered to groups of 50 male and 50 female rats and mice for 2 years, followed by sacrifice, necropsy, and histopathological examination of major organs and tissues. The low <b>toxic</b> <b>potencies</b> {{of most of the}} compounds allowed for relatively high doses to be given during the chronic studies. In general, the toxic manifestations of the PAEs were closely correlated with their ester substituents. Although many of the PAEs possessed some carcinogenic activity, target sites for such effects were dissimilar, suggesting the absence of a common mode of action. In contrast, all of the 2 -ethylhexyl-containing compounds studied possessed some hepatocarcinogenic activity, indicating that this moiety may have a propensity for causing hepatocarcinogenesis in mice, particularly those of the female sex. The 2 -ethylhexyl compound that caused the greatest hepatocarcinogenic response in mice, di(2 ethylhexyl) phthalate, was also hepatocarcinogenic in rats. Similarly, those with a relatively greater effect in female mice were also active in male mice.

40|$|Abstract. Many {{devices have}} been used to {{generate}} data on the <b>toxic</b> <b>potency</b> of smoke from burning products and materials. This paper critically reviews those apparatus and sorts them by the combustion conditions (related to a type of fire) producing the smoke, the specimens tested, and the animal effect measured. All the usable data were derived using rats, and the toxicological effects encountered were lethality, represented by an LC 50 value, and incapacitation, expressed as an IC 50 value. The data showed a wide range of <b>toxic</b> <b>potency</b> values for the products and materials tested. For those engineering applications where the mix of combustibles is unknown, generic values of smoke <b>toxic</b> <b>potency</b> were derived. Statistical analysis of the wealth of published data yielded a generic LC 50 value of 30 g/m 3 ± 20 g/m 3 (one standard deviation) for 30 minute exposure of rats for smoke from well-ventilated combustion. There are limited data for underventilated combustion, and a value of 15 g/m 3 ± 5 g/m 3 is suggested. The mean value of the ratios of IC 50 values to LC 50 values is 0. 50 ± 0. 21, consistent with a prior review. Thus, for well-ventilated fires, a generic 30 minute IC 50 value (for rats) would be 15 g/m 3 ± 10 g/m 3; for underventilated fires, the corresponding number would be 7 g/m 3 ± 2 g/m 3. There are some materials with appreciably lower potency values, indicating higher smoke toxicity. If materials like these are expected to comprise a large fraction of the fuel load, a lower generic value should be used. Key words: fire, smoke, smoke toxicity, incapacitation, lethality 1...|$|E

Phormidium extracts caused weight loss as well as neuro/hepatotoxic symptoms in mice, {{and in the case}} of Ph. bijugatum even death. Very low levels of saxitoxins and microcystins, as confirmed by ELISA, were insufficient to explain this toxicity and the differing <b>toxic</b> <b>potencies</b> of the Phormidium species. Qualitative HPLC analyses confirmed different substance patterns and in the future could aid in the separation of fractions for more detailed substance characterisation.

Further, the human cells were more sensitive than the mouse cells thus suggesting that the former may be a more appropriate choice for studying the impact of Phormidium to man. Among the human cells, two cancer cell lines were more responsive to one of the samples than a normal cell line, thereby indicating a potential anti-tumour activity.

After {{endocytosis}} of the surface-bound toxin, both ricin and CT are transported by vesicle carriers to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The A subunit then dissociates from its holotoxin, unfolds, and crosses the ER membrane {{to reach its}} cytosolic target. Since protein unfolding at physiological temperature and neutral pH allows the dissociated A chain to attain a translocation-competent state for export to the cytosol, the underlying regulatory mechanisms of toxin unfolding are of paramount biological interest.

In contrast, PBA was able to increase the thermal stability of CTA 1 in the presence of anionic phospholipids. PBA inhibits cellular intoxication by CT but not ricin, which is explained by its ability to stabilize CTA 1 and its inability to reverse the destabilizing effect of membranes on RTA.

Several methods to quantify the competitive thyroxine (T 4) displacement potency of pure metabolites exist. However, quantification of the potency of in vitro metabolized PCBs and PBDEs has drawbacks related to the coextraction of compounds disturbing the T 4 -TTR competitive binding assay. This study identifies and quantifies the major coextractants namely cholesterol, saturated and nonsaturated fatty acids (SFA and NSFA) at levels above 20 nmol per mg equivalent protein following various extraction methods. Their TTR binding potency was analyzed in a downscaled, nonradioactive fluorescence displacement assay. At concentration factors needed for TTR competitive binding, at least 10 µM of these coextracts is present, whereas individual SFA and NSFA disturb the assay from 0. 3 µM.

40|$|Purpose Bioassays {{have become}} an {{alternative}} for sediment risk profiling, including potential compliance with sediment quality criteria (SQC). In vitro functional bioassays have evolved through standardization and validation towards a confident toxicological hazard estimate of sediments. Sample preparation is a key aspect {{for the improvement of}} bioassays. It is a standard practice to use a high single-stock concentration of extracts to further dilute test concentrations from and carry out the analysis. This study was carried out to demonstrate that high a contaminant load in a sediment extract (> 20 g sediment equivalents (SEQ) ml- 1) oversaturates solubility in carrier solvents and overloads the clean-up columns, potentially resulting in an under- or overestimation of the quantified dioxin-like <b>toxic</b> <b>potency.</b> Materials and methods Cleaned nonpolar sediment extracts were prepared from samples collected from various locations in Luxembourg. The influence on the quantified <b>toxic</b> <b>potency</b> of the initial stock concentration, sonication assisted dissolution and exposure period in an in vitro bioassay for dioxin-like <b>toxic</b> <b>potency</b> (Bio-TEQ) was evaluated, as well as its impact on the sediment risk characterization according to SQC. Results and discussion Stock sonication before serial dilution strongly reduced the standard variation of the outcomes. Higher initial stock concentrations (> 20 g SEQ ml- 1 for contaminated sediments) produced significantly lower Bio-TEQs g SEQ- 1 compared to those obtained with initial stock concentrations of 2 g SEQ ml- 1, probably due to solvent oversaturation. An initial stock concentration of 2 g SEQ ml- 1 is low enough to prevent mis-estimation, but 20 or even 200 g SEQ ml- 1 might be used when quantification of Bio-TEQ is required. The overload of extract on clean-up columns caused an overestimation of the dioxin-like potency probably due to PAH-induced false-positive responses. Conclusions Higher contaminant load in the initial extracts from sediments affects the reliability of in vitro Bio-TEQ sediment quantification. Advice is given on how to avoid underestimation because of extract oversaturation, avoid overestimation because of overload of clean-up columns and reduce variability by applying sonication in standard testing protocols for risk characterization and quantification of the sample’s <b>toxic</b> <b>potency.</b> Taking into account the new aspects revealed in this study, in addition to important issues for quality control that are already included, the in vitro bioassays based on Bio-TEQs can be applied in a comprehensive monitoring program to determine whether sediments comply with health and safety standards for humans and the environment...|$|E

Moreover, cytotoxicity of the oils was determined using rat hepatoma cells. Except for one crude oil, none of the oils appeared cytotoxic up to 100 mg/L, but all oils activated the AhR. Strong AhR induction was observed for most oils after 6 h, and responses decreased after 24 h, indicating the presence of metabolizable agonists. However, several oils still caused high responses after 24 h, also demonstrating the presence of persistent agonists. The potencies (calculated based on comparisons of concentrations at which 50 % of the maximal effect was observed) of oils were found to be approximately 40 to 106 times lower than the potency of the assay's standards benzo[a]pyrene and 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. However, considering that oils contain thousands of chemicals, the potencies of petrochemical agonists may be very high. Among the most potent oils were bunker and crude oils. Induction up to 200 % as compared to the maximum induction caused by benzo[a]pyrene was observed for these oils. Such supermaximal responses suggest mixture effects that may not be receptor-mediated. Experiments in which oils were tested in combination with the standards demonstrated that oils acted via an antagonistic or additive mode. The results of the present study may help improve risk assessment of petroleum products and judge the necessity or priority of oil spill cleanup activitie...|$|R
40|$|Eighteen {{polycyclic}} {{aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAHs) and 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-pdioxin (TCDD) were examined for their potencies to induce ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity in primary cultures of White Leghorn chicken (Gallus domesticus), Pekin duck (Anas platyrhynchos), and Greater Scaup (Aythya marila) embryo hepatocytes. Of the 18 PAHs, only eight induced EROD activity. In chicken hepatocytes the rank order of potency of the eight EROD inducing PAHs was BkF ≥ DahA > Ind > BaA ≥ BghiP ≥ Chr ≥ BaP > BNT. A log-log plot of the ECthr plotted against the LD 50 (LD 50 data from Brunstrom et al., 1991) for BkF, DahA, BaA, and BNT resulted in a good correlation (r 2 = 0. 898) between EROD-inducing potency and in ovo lethality. The regression line was used to predict LD 50 values for Ind, Chr, and BaP. Although the regression line overestimated the LD 50 values, the estimated values appear to be within one order of magnitude of their approximate LD 50. The rank order of induction potency of the eight EROD-inducing PAHs in duck and scaup hepatocytes was BkF ≥ DahA > BaP ≥ Ind > BghiP ≥ Chr ≥ BaA > BNT, and BkF ≥ DahA > BaP ≥ Ind > BaA ≥ BghiP > Chr, respectively. Among species, there was no clear overall trend in relative sensitivity to EROD induction by individual PAHs. The EROD inducing potency of zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) extracts was investigated in hepatocytes of all three species. The rank order of sensitivity to the extracts was chicken > duck ≥ scaup. While TCDD and several PCBs induce porphyrin accumulation in chicken embryo hepatocytes, none of the PAHs elicited this response. Regardless {{of the lack of}} porphyrinogenic effects, the EROD data suggests that primary cultures of avian embryo hepatocytes maybe a useful model for predicting the in ovo <b>toxic</b> <b>potencies</b> of PAHs in avian species...|$|R
40|$|Hazardous air {{pollutants}} {{are present in}} ambient air as components of complex mixtures {{a large proportion of}} which remains uncharacterised in terms of exposure or effect. Current regulatory approaches however focus on relatively few individual components of this mixture, which are sufficiently characterised, for monitoring and potential regulation. Bio-analytical assessments may be undertaken for complex mixtures for specific mechanisms of toxicity. These assessments would provide a screening tool for overall <b>toxic</b> <b>potency.</b> A framework is outlined for the application of a mode of action test battery for these assessments. Passive air samplers which may be deployed over wide spatial scales simultaneously are particularly suited as a screening tool for assessing exposure. A preliminary field study was conducted at five sites in Queensland using semipermeable membrane devices, a type of passive air sampler. These samples were then assessed for overall <b>toxic</b> <b>potency</b> using the umuC assay (genotoxicity) and analysed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Both toxicity units and maximum induction ratios were determined as overall potency estimates. The sum of benzo[a]pyrene equivalents (ΣBaP Eq) was determined for co-deployed samplers. Significant differences were found between some sites using overall potency estimates. A significant correlation was found between toxicity units and the ΣBaP Eq. However, this parameter does not appear to identify the most potent site as assessed bio-analytically suggesting that other non-quantified components may be responsible for observed effect in certain cases...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of 28 disinfection by-products (DBPs), which {{were divided into}} 5 groups, in 70 drinking water treatment plants in 31 cities across China was investigated, and the <b>toxic</b> <b>potency</b> of each DBP group was calculated using mammalian cell toxicity data from previous studies for profiling. Of the 28 DBPs, 21 were detected with an average frequency of detection of 50 %. Trihalomethanes (THM 4) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) were the most predominant species, whose median concentration levels were at 10. 53 and 10. 95 mu g L- 1, respectively. Two of four iodinated trihalomethanes (I-THMs) were detected, and the concentration of the I-THMs ranged from under the detection limit to 5. 58 mu g L- 1. The total concentration of haloacetonitriles (HANs) in different water samples ranged from under the limit of detection to 39. 20 mu g L- 1, with a median concentration of 1. 11 mu g L- 1. Two of four halonitromethanes (HNMs) were detected, and the maximum concentrations of chloronitromethane (CNM) and trichloronitromethane (TCNM) were 0. 96 and 0. 28 mu g L- 1, respectively. HANs {{were found to be}} the most potent DBP group in terms of cytotoxicity, and HANs and HAAs had the same level of genotoxic potency. These results indicate that although at a low concentration level, the <b>toxic</b> <b>potency</b> of the unregulated HANs in drinking water may not be neglected...|$|E
40|$|In {{a year-round}} {{monitoring}} program (1998), pesticide composition and <b>toxic</b> <b>potency</b> {{of the mix}} of pollutants present in rainwater were measured. The goal {{of the study was}} to relate atmospheric deposition of <b>toxic</b> <b>potency</b> and pesticide composition to each other and to sampling period and local agricultural activity. Rainwater was collected in 26 consecutive periods of 14 days in a background location (BACK) and in two locations representative for different agricultural practices, i. e. intensive greenhouse horticulture (HORT) and flower bulb culture (BULB). Samples were chemically analyzed for carbamate (CARB), organophosphate (OP) and organochlorine (OC) pesticides and metabolites. Esterase inhibiting potency of rainwater extracts was measured in a specially developed bio-assay with honeybee esterases and was expressed as an equivalent concentration of the model inhibitor dichlorvos. Estrogenic potency of the extracts was measured in the ER-CALUX reporter gene assay and was expressed as an equivalent concentration of estradiol. Multivariate principal component analysis (PCA) techniques proved to be valuable tools to analyze the numerous pesticide concentrations in relation to <b>toxic</b> <b>potency,</b> sampling location, and sampling season. Pesticide composition in rainwater depended much more on sampling season than on sampling location, but differences between SPRING and SUMMER were mainly attributed to local differences in agricultural practice. On average, the esterase inhibiting potency exceeded the maximum permissible concentration set for dichlorvos in The Netherlands, and was significantly higher in HORT than in BACK and BULB. Esterase inhibition correlated significantly with OP and GARB concentrations, as expected given the working mechanism of these insecticides. The estrogenic potency incidentally exceeded NOEC levels reported for aquatic organisms and was highest in SPRING. Although estrogenic potency of rainwater correlated with OC concentrations, the ER-CALUX responses could not be attributed to any particular pesticides. Besides, the contribution of non-analyzed xeno-estrogens as alkylphenol(-ethoxylates) and bisphenol-A to the estrogenic potency of rainwater could not be excluded. Further research should focus on the chemical identification of estrogenic compounds in rainwater. In addition, more attention should be given to the ecological consequences of atmospheric deposition of individual pesticides and of total toxic potencies that regularly exceed environmental criteria for Dutch surface waters and/or toxic threshold values for aquatic organisms.

40|$|Exposure to air {{particulate}} matter (PM) is epidemiologically {{associated with increased}} incidence of respiratory and cardiovascular disease in humans. Although inflammation, oxidative stress and toxicity have been implicated in the pathophysiological response to air pollution, the physicochemical properties of the particles responsible for the adverse effects are yet to be elucidated. In vitro assays are widely used to study the toxicity of particles, however, {{they have not been}} comprehensively validated in vivo. This work aimed to evaluate in vitro cytotoxicity and inflammatory cytokine assays as screening tools for relative toxicity of PM, validate their capacity to predict toxicity of PM in BALB/c mice, develop a cell-interaction model {{for the study of the}} biological effects of PM, and evaluate its performance in relation to PM effects in animals. Results show that in vitro assays conducted in macrophage (J 774 A. 1) and alveolar epithelial (A 549) cell lines can discriminate between PM, based on their cytotoxic and inflammatory potency. SRM- and EHG-type particles were more potent than DWR 1 (PM 2. 5) and mineral particles both in vitro and in vivo, although PM rankings varied considerably between assays. PM with different compositions had different <b>toxic</b> <b>potencies.</b> Combinations of 2 to 4 in vitro assays showed a predictive potential for PM-induced effects in vivo, represented by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) neutrophilia in mice. In a co-culture, epithelial (A 549) and macrophage (THP- 1) cells synergistically modulate their production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL- 1 beta, IL- 6, IL- 8, MCP- 1 and TNF-alpha), ICAM- 1 and VEGF in response to PM exposure. Cellular mediators from PM-exposed co-cultures can activate endothelial cells (HPAE) to produce cytokines (IL- 6, IL- 8, GM-CSF, MCP- 1) and adhesion factors (ICAM- 1, VCAM- 1 and E-selectin). Exposure of mice to EHG 6802, DWR 1 and SRM- 1650 particles led to BAL neutrophilia and elevated cytokines (IL- 6, KC, MIP- 1 alpha, TNF-alpha, with a stronger inflammatory response at 2 hrs then 24 hrs. Statistical comparison of the cell interaction model responses with PM-induced BAL neutrophilia in vivo shows that the co-culture model correlates well with biological effects of particles in mice. Along with its ability to simulate physiologically relevant cell-cell interactions, it is a good model for studying mechanisms of PM toxicity, and for relative toxicity screening of particles...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of man made chemicals into the environment, the reproductive success of bird species {{all over the world}} has been compromised. Since the ban on the use of several chemicals, pollution has decreased, but residues still remain, and reproductive and physiological are still reported to be associated with contaminants. In the Baltic Sea, one of the most contaminated areas in the world, fish suffer from massive mortality during the early life stages. These fish contain high levels of contaminants and low levels of thiamine; thus, it has been hypothesised that contaminants induce thiamine deficiency. As fish eating birds occupy the same position in the food chain as the affected fish, one of the aims of the presented research was to establish the role of contaminant induced thiamine deficiency in bird embryotoxicity. Although the contamination levels in Baltic guillemots have decreased since the 1960 s, the birds still contain appreciable amounts of contaminants. The second aim of the research was therefore to assess the potential toxic effects of these contaminants, at the current levels, in these birds. Several experiments were conducted to study both hypotheses, using an optimised chicken embryo bioassay. The thesis describes the development and validation of the bioassay, as well as its use in studies on the effects of contaminants on embryonal transketolase activity, which is a biomarker for thiamine deficiency. In addition, extracts from Baltic guillemots as well as from oystercatcher eggs from the Zeehavenkanaal in the Netherlands (which is contaminated with hexachlorobenzene) were tested for their <b>toxic</b> <b>potencies.</b> None of the selected model compounds or extracts resulted in decreased transketolase activity, indicating that contaminant induced thiamine deficiency probably does not play a role in avian embryotoxicity. Levels of PCBs in guillemot extracts were high enough to enhance the incidence of malformed embryos in fish eating birds. Both extracts resulted in decreased lymphocyte density in the bursa of Fabricius, and increased activity of EROD. Since EROD induction was found to be a very sensitive biomarker for exposure to contaminants that bind to the Ah receptor, this biomarker was studied during embryonic development; it was found to be a conservative predictor for toxicity in birds. Results were discussed in the framework of species differences in sensitivity towards toxic actions of chemicals. It was concluded that under the present contamination levels, toxic effects could not be excluded in Baltic guillemots and oystercatchers from the Zeehavenkanaal...|$|R
40|$|Pyrrolizidine {{alkaloids}} are cytotoxic, carcinogenic, and anti-carcinogenic in vivo and in vitro, {{and they}} produce many hazardous effects in humans and animals. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) also cross-link with DNA and/or protein. However, whether such cross-linking {{is important to}} the toxic action of PAs is not known. In addition, the exact mechanism underlying these DNA cross-links or cytotoxicity is also not clear. In three separate studies, I characterized the nature of PA-induced DNA cross-links and the relationships between PA structures and cross-linking potency. In the first study (Chapter II), I found that cross-linking potency of PA congeners coincided with their abilities to cause cytopathologic effects. Macrocyclic a,p-unsaturated diesters PAs and their pyrrolic metabolites were the most potent inhibitors of colony formation, and inducers of cytopathologic changes and megalocyte formation. The macrocyclic α, β-saturated diester PA and open diesters PAs slightly inhibited colony formation, and slightly changed cell morphology. Retronecine and indicine N-oxide were completely inactive. In the next study (Chapter Ill), I found that pyrrolic macrocyclic metabolites were more potent DNA cross-linkers than their parent compounds as determined by alkaline elution. The pyrroles of the macrocyclic diester PAs were potent DNADNA (inter- and/or intra) cross-linkers in BstEll-digested λ-phage DNA or pBR 322 plasmid DNA but dehydroretronecine and indicine N-oxide were not. I also examined which DNA sequences were more susceptible to PA-induced cross-links by using a series of restriction endonucleases to determine sequence specificity. The most favorable cross-linking site for PAs appeared to be 52 ̆ 7 d(GG) and 52 ̆ 7 -d(GA) although other sites, 52 ̆ 7 -d(CC) or 52 ̆ 7 -d(CG), might be also preferable cross-linking targets. In the next study (Chapter IV), I characterized the nature of DNA-protein interactions induced by PAs, because I found in previous studies that PA-induced cross-links are largely protein associated. In PA or pyrrolic PA exposed cells, cross-linked proteins with molecular weights 40 - 60 kD were detected. Two-dimensional electrophoretic analysis revealed that these proteins were probably acidic in nature. In an in vitro system utilizing pBR 322 or Bst Ell-digested λ-phage DNA. dehydrosenecionine induced DNAprotein cross-links with BSA, indicating that such interactions might be related to amino acid composition of protein. These results confirmed that PA-induced DNA cross-links (DNA-DNA, DNA-protein cross-links) are influenced by three structural features: the C 1, 2 unsaturation of pyrrolizidine ring, α, β-unsaturation, and size of the macrocyclic diester ring. The ability to form cross-links was closely related to the known <b>toxic</b> <b>potencies</b> of these PAs. From this research, I also conclude that DNA crosslinking is the most critical event leading to PA-related diseases and that crosslinking is due to pyrrolic metabolites of PAs, not via a common metabolite as was once thought...|$|R
