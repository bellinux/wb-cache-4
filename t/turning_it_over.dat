5|$|In 1970, the Ebenezer Avery House was {{in danger}} of being torn down to {{construct}} apartments and it was purchased by R. Stanton Avery. R. Stanton Avery purchased the property with the intention of <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to the Avery Memorial Association. Edwin Park, an architect, assessed the house as in need of extensive reconstruction and the association discussed the plan to move the house to Fort Griswold Battlefield State Park. A meeting held on the association on July 24, 1971, was held to discuss the movement plan which involved disassembling and reassembling the house at its new location. The project to move the house was a shared cost between R. Stanton Avery and the Avery Memorial Association. By the 1972 meeting, the total cost of the relocation was $43,000 and the act provoked interest from the State of Connecticut. The house was donated to the State of Connecticut for use as a historic house museum.|$|E
5|$|Philip's {{relatively}} lenient {{treatment of}} the Phocians in 346 BC now bore fruit. Reaching Elatea, he ordered the city to be re-populated, and {{during the next few}} months the whole Phocian confederation was restored to its former state. This provided Philip with a base in Greece, and new, grateful allies in the Phocians. Philip probably arrived in Phocis in November 339 BC, but the decisive phase of the campaign did not occur until August 338 BC. During this period Philip discharged his responsibility to the Amphicytonic council by settling the situation in Amphissa. He tricked a force of 10,000 mercenaries who were guarding the road from Phocis to Amphissa into abandoning their posts, then took Amphissa and expelled its citizens, <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to Delphi. He probably also engaged in diplomatic attempts to try and avoid further conflict in Greece, although if so, he was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of 339 BC, the Thebans had seized the town of Nicaea near Thermopylae, which Philip had garrisoned in 346 BC. Philip {{does not appear to}} have treated this as a {{declaration}} of war, but it nevertheless presented him with a significant problem, blocking the main route into Greece. However, a second route into central Greece was available, leading over the shoulder of Mount Callidromos and descending into Phocis. However, the Athenians and Thebans had either forgotten the existence of this road, or believed that Philip would not use it; the subsequent failure to guard this road allowed Philip to slip into central Greece unhindered. Philip's relatively lenient treatment of the Phocians at the end of the Third Sacred War in 346 BC now bore fruit. Reaching Elatea, he ordered the city to be re-populated, and during the next few months the whole Phocian Confederation was restored to its former state. This provided Philip with a base in Greece, and new, grateful allies in the Phocians. Philip probably arrived in Phocis in November 339 BC, but the Battle of Chaeronea did not occur until August 338 BC. During this period Philip discharged his responsibility to the Amphicytonic council by settling the situation in Amphissa. He tricked a force of 10,000 mercenaries who were guarding the road from Phocis to Amphissa into abandoning their posts, then took Amphissa and expelled its citizens, <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to Delphi.

The method of proof is to apply side-angle-side to the triangle and its mirror image.

25|$|From 1918 until 1944 Iceland was self-governing, but the Danish {{king was}} Head of State of both Denmark and Iceland. The United Kingdom {{occupied}} Iceland (to pre-empt a German occupation) on 10 May 1940, <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to the then neutral United States in July 1941, before that country entered {{the war in}} December 1941. Officially remaining neutral throughout World War II, Iceland became a fully independent republic on 17 June 1944.|$|E
25|$|The game nearly {{went against}} the Sooners. Oklahoma went three-and-out on their opening possession. On their next possession, Allen Patrick fumbled the ball, <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to Iowa State on Oklahoma's 20yard line. Iowa State {{converted}} for a touchdown taking the early lead. It was a defensive struggle {{for the rest of}} the first half with neither team scoring. Iowa State had a couple chances to extend their lead, but the OU defense stood strong. The Cyclones missed a 36yard field goal and the Sooner's defense stopped Iowa State on a 4th down play.|$|E

25|$|To {{increase}} the visual interest of his show, Emerson would abuse his Hammond L-100 organ by, among other things, hitting it, beating {{it with a}} whip, pushing it over, riding it across the stage like a horse, playing with it lying on top of him, and wedging knives into the keyboard. Some of these actions also produced musical sound effects: hitting the organ caused it to make explosion-like sounds, <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> made it feed back, and the knives held down keys, thus sustaining notes. Emerson's show with the Nice has been cited as having a strong influence on heavy metal musicians.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} part of this 25 {{kilometre}} (16 mile) Blitzkrieg-like attack Watanabe, now in control of the road bridge, sent a force of three tanks under the command of Ensign Toichero Sato to explore {{the other side of the}} river. Sato travelled 4km (3 miles) before encountering more British artillery, in the form of two 4.5 inch Howitzers from the 155th Field Artillery Regiment, RA. Sato's tank opened fire on the first gun, <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> and blocking the road. The gunners from the second gun managed to lower their barrels in time to fire on the tanks at point blank range. Sato's tank was hit and destroyed, killing him, and forcing the other two tanks in his force to retreat back to the road bridge.|$|E
25|$|In 1949, the E. Claiborne Robins School of Business opened, {{followed}} by the School of Continuing Studies in 1962. In 1969, when financial issues threatened closing the university or <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to the Commonwealth of Virginia, E. Claiborne Robins Sr., a trustee and alumnus, donated $50 million to the university, the largest gift made to an institution of higher education at the time. In constant dollars, it remains among the largest. Robins' goal was to make Richmond {{one of the best}} private universities in the country. In partnership with the University's president E. Bruce Heilman and development director H. Gerald Quigg the $10 million matching grant component of the gift raised over an additional $60 million, making the University's total endowment at the time one of the highest in the country.|$|E

25|$|While the {{previous}} decades concerned the private {{ownership of the}} Fort, the mid-twentieth century was focused upon reclaiming the land for public use. The first incident was in 1917 when an issue over unpaid back taxes resulted {{in the town of}} Amherstburg seizing a small area of privately owned land known as the Webber property and then turning over ownership of it to the Federal government. In the 1930s, the Cleveland Cliffs Iron and Coal Company were persuaded not to renew their mortgage on the north section of the northeast bastion, which resulted in the town purchasing the land and then <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to the Department of Mines and Resources National Parks Division. After the death of Franklin A. Hough in 1946, the Federal government purchased Lot 4. Additionally, in 1958, the Federal government repeated the same action with the McGregor House, purchasing it from his estate.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} week, the Bears {{faced the}} Indianapolis Colts for Super Bowl XLI rematch. Although the game {{took place during}} prime-time, they would treat the game {{as if it were}} any other preseason game. Regardless, the Bears won by a score of 27â€“24, but not without controversy. Grossman, making his homecoming to Indiana, struggled throughout the night. He fumbled the ball three times (though only <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> once), and threw an interception. Despite completing the night by completing nine of eleven passes for fifty-nine yards and one rushing touchdown, Grossman's struggles became the focus of the night. Griese, however, threw ten completions on thirteen attempts with one touchdown. The Bears defense was able to record three interceptions, while the special teams unit was able to force a fumble on a return. Return specialists Devin Hester and Danieal Manning also performed productively as kick returners.|$|E
25|$|Ohio State {{tied the}} game again {{early in the}} second quarter on a second {{touchdown}} run from Barrett. The Spartans' responded on their next drive, going 66 yards, and taking a 21â€“14 lead on another Langford touchdown run. On the ensuing kickoff, Dontre Wilson fumbled the ball for the Buckeyes, <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to the Spartans, though they were unable to score off of it. Ohio State and Barrett quickly recovered on their next possession, scoring in one play on a 79-yard touchdown pass to Michael Thomas. A touchdown pass from Barrett to Devin Smith late in the first half gave Ohio State their first lead of the game at 28â€“21. Michigan State received the ball to start the second half and settled for a 40-yard field goal from Michael Geiger, cutting the Ohio State lead to 28â€“24. The Buckeyes responded on their first possession of the half, scoring on an Ezekiel Elliott touchdown run and expanding their lead to two possessions.|$|E

25|$|When Xiang {{learned of}} the Cominternâ€™s {{decision}} on anti-rightism, he claimed that the Chinese revolution was in its peak period. Li turned this blindness into extremism, which was later known as the Li Lisan line, calling for armed uprising in the cities and extension of revolution to whole country. From June 1930, the Li Lisan line matured under the support from Xiang. The CCP gave up the daily operation from its headquarters, <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to divisions in all provinces. It set up action committees in all provinces, and began preparing for a full-scale uprising in October. But the Comintern expressed its discontent by stating that it was working out systemic policies for Chinese revolution, and that the CCP should concentrate instead on the uprising in one or several provinces instead. Xiang stood by Li, both refuting that it was zero hour of Chinese revolution. In several rounds of discussion, the tension between Xiang, Li, and the Comintern rose greatly. The suspicion and criticism by the CCP towards the Comintern {{was the same as}} betrayal {{in the eyes of the}} Comintern.|$|E
25|$|Ohio State {{received}} {{the ball to}} start the second half, with the Wolverine defense forcing their first three {{and out of the}} game. Three runs for 58 yards by Mike Hart set up Michigan at the Ohio State 2. Hart scored his second touchdown of the day on a two-yard run, cutting the Buckeye lead again to one possession at 28â€“21. Three plays later, on Ohio State's next possession, Troy Smith threw an interception to Alan Branch, giving Michigan possession of the ball at the Buckeye 25 yard line. Michigan was unable to convert a first down off of the interception, settling instead for a 39-yard field goal from Garrett Rivas, cutting the Ohio State lead to 28â€“24. Ohio State responded three plays later on a 56-yard touchdown from Antonio Pittman, giving the Buckeyes a 35â€“24 lead. After driving to the Ohio State 34, Michigan was unable to convert on a fourth down, <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to Ohio State. Three and outs by both teams on their ensuing possessions, gave the ball back to Ohio State with over a minute remaining in the quarter. A fumble by Smith again gave the ball back to the Wolverines, this time at the Ohio State 9. A rush from no gain from Hart was the last play of the third quarter.|$|E

Fister continued to pitch the game, holding the Giants to one run over six innings before <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to the bullpen.|$|E
500|$|As the album's producer, Hendrix had a {{difficult}} time completing the task. [...] Presented with the sometimes problematic recordings and resigned to <b>turning</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> to a different record company, Hendrix expressed his dissatisfaction with the final product. [...] Shortly after its release, Band of Gypsys reached the top ten of the album charts in the US and UK as well as appearing in charts in several other countries. [...] Although it was as popular as his albums with the Experience, it received mixed reviews. [...] Some faulted the performances as tentative and underprepared; additionally, Miles' contributions on drums and vocals have been characterized as plodding and obtrusive. [...] However, [...] "Machine Gun" [...] is generally regarded as the album's highlight and one of Hendrix's greatest achievements. [...] The influence of Band of Gypsys is heard in the funk rock developments of the 1970s and has been cited as an inspiration by various later rock musicians. Reissues of the album on compact disc included three extra songs recorded during the Fillmore East shows, and additional material has been released on later albums.|$|E
