5|$|The {{whole of}} Scotland {{was covered by}} ice sheets during the Pleistocene ice ages and <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>is</b> much {{affected}} by glaciation. From a geological perspective, the country has three main sub-divisions.|$|E
5|$|A {{topographic}} map {{shows that the}} majority of the interconnected complex of tightly packed lakes with their valley-and-ridge landscape is primarily in Minnesota; the border of <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>is</b> the Canada–US border. This border is composed of the Pigeon River, and these Rove Formation lakes (going east to west): South Fowl, North Fowl, Moose, Mountain, Watap, Rose, South, Little North and Gunflint. The border runs approximately through the center of the lengths of these lakes. The only Rove-typical east-west oriented lakes lying in Ontario are Arrow and North lakes.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} the rest of Scotland the Firth of Clyde was covered by ice sheets during the Pleistocene ice ages and <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>is</b> much {{affected}} by glaciation. Arran's highest peaks may have been nunataks at this time. After the last retreat of the ice sea level changes and the isostatic rise of land makes charting post glacial coastlines a complex task but the resultant clifflines behind raised beaches are a prominent feature of the entire coastline.|$|E

5|$|Rivington is {{situated}} on the moorland fringe between the high unenclosed moorland of the West Pennine Moors and the fields below. <b>The</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>is</b> characterised by marginal pastures with isolated farmsteads, reservoirs and disused mines and quarries scattered across the hillsides. There is an extensive network of footpaths providing public access. The reservoir valleys are dominated by expanses of water and the Victorian gothic architecture of the dams and embankments surrounded by woodland.|$|E
5|$|The {{western part}} of the {{district}} in the Vale of York borders on and is drained by the River Derwent. <b>The</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>is</b> generally low-lying and flat although minor ridges and glacial moraines provide some variations in topography. Where there are dry sandy soils there are remnants of historic heathlands and ancient semi-natural woodlands. Arable fields dominate the land cover of the area and grasslands are infrequent. There are very few flood meadows left, although some significant areas remain on the lower reaches of the River Derwent.|$|E
5|$|The {{whole of}} Scotland {{was covered by}} ice sheets during the Pleistocene ice ages and <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>is</b> much {{affected}} by glaciation, {{and to a lesser}} extent by subsequent sea level changes. In the post-glacial epoch, circa 6100 BC, Scotland and the Faeroe Islands experienced a tsunami up to 20 metres high caused by the Storegga Slides, an immense underwater landslip off the coast of Norway. Earth tremors are infrequent and usually slight. The Great Glen is the most seismically active area of Britain, but the last event of any size was in 1901.|$|E

5|$|We've {{always thought}} Lutz {{was the first}} one to sell it. But it's like how people claim they saw Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game or were at Woodstock. <b>The</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>is</b> {{littered}} with salesmen who say, 'Oh yeah, I {{was the first one}} to bring that in.' The first PBR I ever had was at the Jockey Club, this really old-school punk-rock bar on Killingsworth. As far as the very first ones, there was the Lutz and EJ's, and it's always been our thought that Lutz was first.|$|E
5|$|Georgian English {{landscape}} gardens, such as West Wycombe and Stowe, {{are arranged}} as a walk or series of walks {{that take the}} visitor through a range of locations, {{each with its own}} specific character and separate from the last. Planting and the shape of <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>is</b> used, alongside follies and man-made water features, to create pleasant vistas and set pieces centred on a building, straight avenue, serpentine walk, or viewpoint. In the later years of the 18th century, the 5,000acres (20km²) of grounds were extended to the east, towards the nearby town of High Wycombe, and Humphrey Repton completed the creation of the gardens, until they appeared much as they do today.|$|E
5|$|The Levels {{have few}} wooded areas, just {{occasional}} willow trees. <b>The</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>is</b> dominated by grassland, mostly used as pasture for dairy farming with approximately 70per {{cent of the}} area being grassland and 30per cent arable. From January until May, the River Parrett provides a source of European eels (Anguilla anguilla) and young elvers, which are caught by hand netting as {{this is the only}} legal means of catching them. A series of eel passes have been built on the Parrett at the King's Sedgemoor Drain to help this endangered species; cameras have shown 10,000 eels migrating upstream in a single night. The 2003 BBC Radio 4 play Glass Eels by Nell Leyshon was set on the Parrett.|$|E

5|$|The {{plants and}} animals which live on Solsbury Hill reflect the habitat {{provided}} by grassland overlying the limestone rock beneath. Specialist {{plants and animals}}, {{some of which are}} rare species, have adapted to the calcareous grassland. Most of <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>is</b> largely unaffected by agriculture as shown by the yellow meadow ant. Examples of plant species found include bird's foot trefoil, vetches, greater knapweed, harebells, yarrow (Achillea millefolium), and scabious. It is {{one of a series of}} flower-rich habitats, which Avon Wildlife Trust are trying to link together. The plants attract a range of insects including: the six-spotted burnet moth, hummingbird hawk-moth and a number of butterflies including chalkhill blues. A small population of common buzzard (Buteo buteo) nest in the area. Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), badger and red fox are also seen. The skylark also nests on the hill.|$|E
5|$|The {{trunkline}} turns north, {{away from}} the river, as it nears the stadium and passes through {{the remainder of the}} northern suburb, changing to a more rural character as the freeway passes through the northern end of Kent County. M-46 joins US131 from the west at Cedar Springs and the two highways pass into northwestern Montcalm County near Sand Lake. North of Pierson <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>is</b> dominated by forests. M-46 turns east and leaves the freeway near Howard City while US131 continues into Mecosta County near the Little Muskegon River. The freeway forms the eastern boundary of the Manistee National Forest near the river and north to Big Rapids. Further north M-20 joins the US131 freeway near Stanwood and the two highways cross the Muskegon River on the way to Big Rapids. The city is served by its own business loop and M-20 turns east off the freeway along Bus. US131 toward the main campus of Ferris State University. North of Big Rapids US131 runs through rural Osceola County to a junction with US10 at Reed City.|$|E
5|$|Wales has {{a complex}} {{geological}} history which has left it a largely mountainous country. The coastal plain is narrow {{in the north}} and west of the country but wider in the south, where the Vale of Glamorgan has some of the best agricultural land. Exploitation of the South Wales Coalfield during the Industrial Revolution resulted in the development of an urban economy in the South Wales Valleys, and the expansion of the port cities of Newport, Cardiff and Swansea for the export of coal. The smaller North Wales Coalfield was also developed at this time, but elsewhere in the country, <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>is</b> rural and communities are small, the economy being largely dependent on agriculture and tourism. The climate is influenced by the proximity of the country to the Atlantic Ocean and the prevailing westerly winds; thus it tends to be mild, cloudy, wet and windy.|$|E

5|$|The oldest {{geological}} {{formation in the}} valley is the Supra-Pennant Measures of the Carboniferous period. It is a significant feature towards the north-eastern part of the area and {{is represented by the}} Pensford Syncline coal basin, which formed part of the Somerset coalfield. It is a complex formation containing coal seams and is made up of clay and shales. <b>The</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>is</b> typically undulating and includes outcrops of sandstone. Most of the area around Stanton Drew have neutral to acid red loamy soils with slowly permeable subsoils. Soils to {{the eastern part of the}} area are slowly permeable clayey and fine silty soils. They are found on Carboniferous clay and shales typical of the Supra-Pennant Measures. They are frequently waterlogged where the topography dictates. They tend towards being acid and are brown to grey brown in colour. In the south and south east of the area there are coal measures which are sufficiently near the surface for coal mining to have taken place around Clutton and High Littleton. In the eastern area of the valley as the River Chew flows through Publow, Woollard and Compton Dando before joining the River Avon at Keynsham there are alluvial deposits of clay soils.|$|E
5|$|The road follows Bluewater Highway {{along the}} river, passing {{to the north}} of Saranac. It turns northeasterly through lightly forested {{farmland}} passing Bertha Brock Park as it approaches the city of Ionia. In town, M-66 runs concurrently along M-21 for a few blocks in the central business district. Bluewater Highway leaves town and continues along the Grand River to Muir, and the trunkline crosses the Maple River on east side of town. M-21 follows the course of the Maple briefly before turning east through farms along the Stony Creek to Pewamo. The highway bypasses the village to the south and crosses into Clinton County near the eastern edge of town. Western Clinton County's landscape is dominated by farms, interrupted by the community of Fowler. The highway enters the county seat, St. Johns on State Street, passing through a residential section of town. In the middle of downtown, M-21 intersects 2nd Street, which carries Business US Highway 127 (Bus. US127). East of downtown, M-21 passes back into agricultural land and under the US127 freeway. <b>The</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>is</b> once again dominated by these farms through the western side of the county.|$|E

50|$|In the German-language geography, {{this focus}} on the {{connection}} between social groups and <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> <b>was</b> further developed by Hans Bobek and Wolfgang Hartke after the Second World War. For Bobek, groups of Lebensformen (patterns of life)—influenced by social factors—that formed <b>the</b> <b>landscape,</b> <b>were</b> at <b>the</b> center of his social geographical analysis. In a similar approach, Hartke considered <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> a source for indices or traces of certain social groups' behaviour. The best-known example of this perspective was the concept of Sozialbrache (social-fallow), i.e. the abandoning of tillage as an indicator for occupational shifts away from agriculture.|$|R
