5|$|Severing {{ties with}} both Eighteen Visions and Throwdown, Schieppati opted to pursue Bleeding Through as a {{priority}} {{upon completion of the}} Indecision Records 2002 offering Portrait of the Goddess. At <b>this</b> <b>juncture</b> the group comprised the guitar pairing of Scott Danough and Brian Leppke, bassist Ryan Wombacher (replacing Vijay Kumar who played on Portrait of the Goddess) and drummer Derek Youngsma.|$|E
5|$|At <b>this</b> <b>juncture,</b> the Roman empire was convulsed by {{its first}} major civil war since the Battle of Actium exactly a century earlier: the Year of the Four Emperors (69-70 AD). The {{governor}} of Germania Inferior, ordered {{to raise more}} troops, outraged the Batavi by attempting to conscript more Batavi than the maximum stipulated in their treaty. The brutality and corruption of the Roman recruiting-centurions (including incidents of sexual assault on Batavi young men) brought already deep discontent in the Batavi homeland to the boil.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Nazi–Soviet pact on 23 August 1939, the RAF mobilised. Cunningham had been test-flying the airliner de Havilland Dragon. Only 16 were complete before the declaration of war in September. The growing tension in Europe made war more likely. John was forced to commit himself either to de Havilland or the RAF at <b>this</b> <b>juncture.</b> The RAF had trained him and he felt he could be of far more use in the RAF than test-flying aircraft.|$|E
50|$|At <b>this</b> {{critical}} <b>juncture,</b> {{the grammar}} school building, built in an understated Moderne style, was constructed.|$|R
60|$|But at <b>this</b> {{important}} <b>juncture</b> {{the colonel}} came lounging in, and Kitty glided {{out of the}} room.|$|R

5|$|While Argentina's {{finances}} {{were extremely}} strained at <b>this</b> <b>juncture</b> following {{the economic crisis}} in 1953, the most serious setback to the project came in January 1955 when Tank's contract expired. He reputedly requested almost twice as much money to continue but President Perón instead canceled his contract outright. Despite four years of development and trials, the IAe 33 project was still encountering teething problems and its status remained unclear although no final decision {{had been made to}} abandon a project that had reached iconic stature in the Perónist era.|$|E
5|$|But by {{the time}} he {{captured}} the position, the rest of his company lay dead or wounded. Singh was left alone to achieve the objective assigned. He advanced towards the second Pakistani medium machine gun post. At <b>this</b> <b>juncture,</b> he was almost blinded by a grenade that blast at his face. His Sten gun ammunition had run out. Singh moved out of the trench and lobbed grenades at the next Pakistani post. Meanwhile, he jumped into another trench, and killed two Pakistani soldiers with his bayonet. Before he was able {{to move out of the}} trench, he was hit by a bullet in his head. As he succumbed to his wounds, Singh hurled a grenade into a nearby Pakistani trench.|$|E
5|$|In February 1942, Casterman {{suggested}} to Hergé that his books {{be published in}} a new format; 62-pages rather than the former 100 to 130 pages, and now in full colour rather than black-and-white. He agreed to this, and in 1943 The Crab with the Golden Claws was re-edited and coloured for publication as an album in 1944. Due to the changes in how the adventure had been serialised at , the album at <b>this</b> <b>juncture</b> was only 58 pages long, and thus Hergé filled the missing pages with four full-page colour frames, thus bringing {{it up to the}} standard 62-page format.|$|E
60|$|But at <b>this</b> very <b>juncture</b> Providence, {{which always}} watches over the {{innocent}} and defenceless, was keeping its eye direct upon Winnifred.|$|R
60|$|It was at <b>this</b> {{interesting}} <b>juncture</b> that Mrs. Holt rattled her newspaper {{a little}} louder than usual, arose majestically, and addressed Mrs. Joshua.|$|R
25|$|At <b>this</b> {{critical}} <b>juncture,</b> the Greek {{cause was}} rescued {{by the decision}} of three Great Powers, Great Britain, France and Russia, to intervene jointly in the conflict.|$|R
5|$|When NY47 {{was first}} {{commissioned}} in the Rochester area , it was routed along previously unnumbered roadways, with its northwest terminus {{located at the}} intersection of NY31 (Lyell Avenue) and Howard Road in Gates. NY47 took Howard Road south, passing through Gates Center and intersecting NY33 before crossing the then-New York Central Railroad main line (now the CSX Transportation-owned Rochester Subdivision) at-grade. The route remained on Howard Road until the intersection of Howard Road and Chili Avenue (NY33A), which also included Brooks Avenue at <b>this</b> <b>juncture</b> of time. NY47 turned east onto Brooks Avenue and proceeded toward the Greater Rochester International Airport, joining the current routing of NY204 at Beahan Road (now Old Beahan Road).|$|E
5|$|A {{week after}} that, Theoktistos and Sergios Niketiates were sent on a {{campaign}} to recover Crete, which had been conquered in the 820s by Andalusian exiles. The expedition at first went well, as the Byzantine army landed and took control {{over most of the}} island, confining the Andalusians to their capital, Chandax. At <b>this</b> <b>juncture,</b> Theoktistos heard a rumour that in his absence, Theodora intended to raise her brother Bardas to the imperial throne. He hastily abandoned the army under Niketiates and returned to Constantinople, only to find the rumours false. Once in Constantinople, news arrived of an invasion of Asia Minor by Umar al-Aqta, emir of Malatya. Theoktistos was sent at the head of an army to confront him, but the resulting Battle of Mauropotamos ended in a Byzantine defeat. At the same time, the expeditionary corps left in Crete was defeated and almost annihilated by the Andalusians, who killed Niketiates.|$|E
5|$|Alongside this, Siddhu applies for a {{bank loan}} {{to start his}} {{construction}} company. When his love for Hasini deepens, he wishes to propose to her. He confesses {{to her that he}} is engaged to Subbulakshmi against his wishes, but who he really wants is her. On learning of his engagement, Hasini gets dejected, but comes back a few days later and asks him to do what he wishes for and accepts his proposal. At <b>this</b> <b>juncture,</b> the ecstatic Siddhu is seen by a furious Aravind. Siddhu is admonished back home and he expresses his disinterest in marrying Subbulakshmi. When asked for his reason to like Hasini, Siddhu replies that if Hasini can stay with their family for a week, then all their questions shall be answered. He convinces Hasini to stay at his house after lying to her father, Kanaka Rao (Kota Srinivasa Rao) that she is going on a college tour.|$|E
5000|$|The Nawab of Kurnool and Savnur {{were also}} killed. At <b>this</b> {{critical}} <b>juncture</b> the French commander De Bussy {{made the decision}} to install Salabat Jung as the new Nizam.|$|R
60|$|It {{was all so}} horrible, and he did {{not quite}} {{understand}} it all; his brain, which was usually so keen and so active, refused him service at <b>this</b> terrible <b>juncture.</b>|$|R
60|$|At <b>this</b> very <b>juncture,</b> Maria gave {{a scream}} so loud and shrill that Madame Bernstein woke, that the coachman pulled his horses up, and the footman beside him sprang {{down from his}} box in a panic.|$|R
5|$|At <b>this</b> <b>juncture</b> Richard saw Henry at some {{distance}} behind his main force. Seeing this, Richard decided {{to end the}} fight quickly by killing the enemy commander. He led a charge of mounted men around the melee and tore into Henry's group; several accounts state that Richard's force numbered 800–1000knights, but Ross says it was more likely that Richard was accompanied only by his household men and closest friends. Richard killed Henry's standard-bearer Sir William Brandon in the initial charge and unhorsed burly John Cheyne, Edward IV's former standard-bearer, with {{a blow to the}} head from his broken lance. French mercenaries in Henry's retinue related how the attack had caught them off guard and that Henry sought protection by dismounting and concealing himself among them to present less of a target. Henry made no attempt to engage in combat himself.|$|E
5|$|Dukovac did {{not meet}} further success until 25 May, when he claimed two Supermarine Spitfire V fighters {{southeast}} of Temryuk. Two days later, he and two other pilots surprised eight LaGG-3s west of Trarehof, all of them claiming one, although Dukovac's claim was not witnessed. On 30 May, he was on another He 111 escort mission when he accounted for another LaGG-3. At <b>this</b> <b>juncture</b> there were a spate of defections from 15./JG 52, with pilots flying to Soviet airfields. The remaining pilots were questioned by the Luftwaffe, the Staffel was withdrawn from the front, and {{the commander of the}} HZL was replaced. This {{was the end of the}} second tour of 15./JG 52 on the Eastern Front, during which Dukovac had claimed 14 confirmed and six unconfirmed kills, five of which were later confirmed.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions had in {{the year}} since {{publication}} received highly critical replies from state legislatures. Seven states formally responded to Virginia and Kentucky by rejecting the Resolutions and three other states passed resolutions expressing disapproval, with the other four states taking no action. No other state endorsed the Resolutions. The reason for the criticism was that the General Assembly, led in the effort by state-sovereignty advocate John Taylor of Caroline, had put a state-sovereignty spin on the Virginia Resolutions of 1798 despite Madison's hopes. These replies contended that the Supreme Court of the United States had the ultimate responsibility for deciding whether federal laws were constitutional, and that the Alien and Sedition Acts were constitutional and necessary. The Federalists accused the Democratic-Republicans of seeking disunion, even contemplating violence. At the time, some leading Virginia Democratic-Republican figures such as Rep. William Branch Giles (in public) and Taylor (in private) actually were contemplating disunion, and the Virginia General Assembly chose <b>this</b> <b>juncture</b> for finally constructing a new state armory in Richmond, so there was some truth to the charge.|$|E
60|$|The {{carriage}} which Belsize {{had ordered}} came round at <b>this</b> very <b>juncture.</b> Amidst the crowd, shrinking, bustling, expostulating, threatening, who pressed about him, he shouldered his way. Mr. Taplow, aghast, {{was one of}} the hundred spectators of the scene.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Peagrim bowed coldly. The {{interruption}} had annoyed her. She had no notion who Jill was, and she {{resented the}} intrusion at <b>this</b> particular <b>juncture</b> intensely. Not so Uncle Chris, who skipped {{out into the}} passage like a young lamb.|$|R
60|$|Guy's thus {{leaving the}} ship in the men's hands, {{contrary}} to the mate's advice, was another evidence of his simplicity; for at <b>this</b> particular <b>juncture,</b> had neither the doctor nor myself been aboard, there is no telling what they might have done.|$|R
5|$|His view (part of a {{tradition}} {{that goes back to}} J. J. Müller, who advanced Marius' claims as early as 1870, and supported by modern scholars such as André Chastagnol) was vigorously contested by Ronald Syme, who theorized that virtually all the identifiable citations from Marius Maximus are essentially frivolous interpolations into the main narrative source, which he postulated was a different Latin author whom he styled 'Ignotus ("the unknown one"), the good biographer'. His theory argued, firstly, that as Marius wrote a sequel to the Lives of the Twelve Caesars, his work covered the reigns from Nerva to Elagabalus; consequently, this would not have included a biography of Lucius Verus, even though the biography of that Princeps in the History is mainly of good quality. Secondly, that 'Ignotus' only went up to Caracalla, as is revealed by the inferior and mostly fictitious biography of Macrinus. Finally, that the composer of the Historia Augusta wrote the lives of the emperors through to the Life of Caracalla (including Lucius Verus) using Ignotus as his main source, and supplementing with Marius Maximus on occasion. It was only when the source failed that he turned to other less reliable sources (such as Herodian and Maximus), as well as his own fertile imagination, and it was at <b>this</b> <b>juncture</b> that he composed the first five minor lives, through to the Life of Geta.|$|E
5|$|Phocas's rule lacked {{legitimacy}} and quickly {{came to be}} resented by the populace and the elites of the Byzantine Empire. What prestige he had further eroded when the Persian shah Khosrau II (r. 590–628) declared war, and when the Byzantine forces began to suffer their first defeats. According to a later tradition, Priscus {{sent a letter to}} the Exarch of Africa, Heraclius the Elder, urging him to revolt. This is probably a later invention, but if true, it would indicate the level of dissent even within Constantinople. Whatever the truth of the matter, in 608 Africa rose in revolt, and the Exarch's son, Heraclius the Younger, was dispatched against Constantinople at the head of a fleet. Unopposed by Phocas's forces, he landed at the suburb of Hebdomon on October 3 and marched to the capital, where pro-Heraclian riots had broken out. At <b>this</b> <b>juncture,</b> Priscus pretended to be ill, and withdrew to his mansion at the Boraïdou quarter, where he assembled the excubitores and his own retainers (bucellarii), thus depriving Phocas of his main source of armed support. He is also recorded by John of Nikiu to have safeguarded the women of Heraclius's family from retribution by Phocas.|$|E
5|$|Ibn Tulun now {{seized the}} initiative. Having served {{in his youth}} in the border wars with the Byzantine Empire at Tarsus, he now {{requested}} to be conferred the command of the frontier districts of Cilicia (the Thughūr). Al-Muwaffaq initially refused, but following the Byzantine successes of the previous years al-Mu'tamid prevailed upon his brother and in 877/8 Ibn Tulun received responsibility for the entirety of Syria and the Cilician frontier. Ibn Tulun marched into Syria in person. He received the submission of the son of Amajur, who had recently died, whom he appointed governor at Ramla, and proceeded to take possession of Damascus, Homs, Hama, and Aleppo. At Damascus Ibn Tulun encountered his old rival Ibn al-Mudabbir, who since his eviction from Egypt had served as Amajur's ʿāmil for Palestine and Damascus. Ibn al-Mudabbir was fined 600,000 dinars and thrown into prison, where he died in 883/4. In {{the rest of the}} provincial administration, however, he largely left the people who had served under Amajur in place. Only the governor of Aleppo, Sima al-Tawil, resisted, and fled to Antioch. Ibn Tulun laid siege to the city until Sima was killed, reportedly by a local woman. He then continued on to Tarsus, where he began preparing for a campaign against the Byzantines. The presence of his numerous soldiers, however, led to a rapid rise in prices, causing great hostility among the Tarsians, who demanded that he either leave or reduce his army. At <b>this</b> <b>juncture,</b> news arrived from Egypt that his son Abbas, whom he had left as his regent, was preparing to usurp his position under the influence of his entourage. Ibn Tulun hastily withdrew from Tarsus, but as more information about the situation in Egypt began to arrive, clarifying that Abbas posed no real threat, Ibn Tulun decided to spend more time in Syria and consolidate his authority. He redressed the injustices of Sima, installed troops in Aleppo (under his ghulam Lu'lu') and Harran, secured the co-operation of the Banu Kilab tribe and their leader Ibn al-Abbas, and captured the rebel Musa ibn Atamish. At some point after his takeover of Syria, Ibn Tulun ordered the refortification of Akka, a task undertaken by Abu Bakr al-Banna, the grandfather of al-Muqaddasi, who provides {{a detailed description of the}} work.|$|E
50|$|The {{origins of}} {{transactional}} analysis {{can be traced}} to the first five of Berne's six articles on intuition, which he began writing in 1949.
