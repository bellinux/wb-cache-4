5|$|A {{central part}} of Klamath mythology, the {{mountain}} offers activities such as hiking and horseback riding. Historically, the area around it has been inhabited by Native American tribes and settlers. Until the 1970s, a fire lookout tower sat on the summit of <b>the</b> <b>mountain,</b> <b>and</b> its foundation remains to this day.|$|E
5|$|A {{few miles}} {{southwest}} {{from the head}} of Anderson Lake is Mount Birkenhead, {{on the north side of}} the low pass connecting the valley of those lakes to that of the Birkenhead River. The river, the valley area near Mount Birkenhead known as Birken, and Birkenhead Lake at the summit of the pass were in turn named after <b>the</b> <b>mountain,</b> <b>and</b> not directly by Anderson.|$|E

5|$|The Mount Washington Cog Railway ascends {{the western}} slope of <b>the</b> <b>{{mountain}},</b> <b>and</b> the Mount Washington Auto Road climbs {{to the summit}} from the east. The mountain is popular with hikers (the Appalachian Trail crosses the summit). Other common activities include glider flying, and annual cycle and running races such as the Auto Road Bicycle Hillclimb and Road Race.|$|E
5|$|The mountain's first {{recorded}} climb was in 1950, but traces of earlier climbs, {{and a number}} of archeological sites, were found on <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>and</b> at its feet. With an archeological site at the summit region, Llullaillaco is the highest archeological site in the world. There, in 1999, the mummified remains of three children, known as the Children of Llullaillaco, were found. They are presumed to have been human sacrifices.|$|E

5|$|Angkor Wat, {{located at}} , {{is a unique}} {{combination}} of the temple mountain (the standard design for the empire's state temples) and the later plan of concentric galleries. The temple is a representation of Mount Meru, {{the home of the}} gods: the central quincunx of towers symbolises the five peaks of <b>the</b> <b>mountain,</b> <b>and</b> the walls and moat symbolise the surrounding mountain ranges and ocean. Access to the upper areas of the temple was progressively more exclusive, with the laity being admitted only to the lowest level.|$|E

5|$|As {{a part of}} Terengganu, Kuala Terengganu has a {{tropical}} rainforest climate under the Köppen climate classification (Af) with constant temperature and high humidity. The amount of rainfall varies according to the monsoon season. It is generally fairly hot and humid all year round, averaging from 28°C to 30°C in daytime and slightly cooler after dusk. Nevertheless, the sea breeze from South China Sea hsomehow moderates the humidity in offshore areas while the altitude and lush forest trees and plant has cooled <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>and</b> rural areas.|$|E

5|$|Bågenholm's colleagues made {{an attempt}} to free her but failed. At 18:27 local time (CET), seven minutes after she {{had fallen into the}} water, they called for help on a mobile phone. Police {{lieutenant}} Bård Mikalsen received the call and put together two rescue teams; one at the top of <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>and</b> one at the bottom. Mikalsen also contacted the Bodø rescue team, which was equipped with a Sea King helicopter, but they told him that the helicopter had left to transport a sick child. Mikalsen was persistent and convinced the dispatcher to turn the helicopter around.|$|E
5|$|Chief of Police Alf Reksten {{arrived in}} the {{afternoon}} and took over responsibility. Later, the ship Mira, belonging to Bergen Steamship Company (BSD), arrived with two doctors, two nurses, material from the Red Cross, specialist police officers, fire fighters, representatives from the airline and Norway Post, and journalists. The sister aircraft Najaden arrived later in the afternoon with relatives of the deceased and journalists; its main objective was to search for survivors, but there was no possibility for it to land on <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>and</b> so could not help with the salvaging. Later a Widerøe aircraft arrived as well, which transported DNL's technical director Bernt Balchen, Captain Eckhoff, who worked for the aviation authorities, and Gjermundson from the insurance company. The three, along with Reksten and Bredvik, became the investigation commission.|$|E
5|$|Claude Ewing Rusk, a local settler and mountaineer, was one {{of those}} most {{familiar}} with Adams and he was instrumental in many of the names given to places around the mountain. In 1890, he, his mother Josie, and his sister Leah completed a circuit of <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>and</b> explored, to some extent, all ten of its principle glaciers. This was the first recorded circuit of Adams by a woman and likely the first recorded circuit by anyone. While they were on the east side, they named Avalanche Valley. Later, in 1897, after they had completed an ascent of Adams, they went to the Ridge of Wonders and his mother, awestruck by the scene, named it as such.|$|E

5|$|During {{the late}} 1930s, Joppenbergh became {{the site of}} several ski jumping competitions, which {{continued}} until the early 1940s. The original slope was designed by Harold Schelderup for Rosendale's first competition in 1937; Schelderup himself skied that July, after the slope was coated with borax for a summer competition. Several Olympic skiers participated in the competitions. Skiing began again in the 1960s, when a new slope was built on <b>the</b> <b>mountain,</b> <b>and</b> the revived competitions continued until 1971.|$|E
5|$|Mount Bailey {{heads the}} Mount Bailey chain, which {{consists}} of <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>and</b> smaller cinder cones trending north. Similarly to its neighbor Mount Thielsen, it is a shield volcano with precipitous summit slopes, and the two are almost equal in appearance. Built {{around the same time}} as Rodley Butte, according to morphological study, the current volcano is no more than 100,000 years old, and formed relatively close to Diamond Peak's current cone. Despite its similarity to Rodley Butte, both in age and original composition, Bailey switched from erupting basaltic andesite to pure andesite (silicon dioxide).|$|E
5|$|Mountain birds around Helvellyn {{include the}} raven (Corvus corax), {{which has now}} become common. Peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus), buzzards (Buteo buteo) and ring ouzels (Turdus torquatus) have all bred in the {{immediate}} area. Skylarks (Alauda arvensis) and wheatears (Oenanthe oenanthe) are frequently encountered. At one time eagles (probably Aquila chrysaetos) soared over <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>and</b> bred on the steep cliffs above Red Tarn, but even in Wordsworth's day they had gone, having been persecuted to extinction.|$|E

5|$|On 1 November 1537, Cáceres {{arrived at}} the Peñol de Cerquín. He {{immediately}} sent envoys to Lempira, requesting his submission; Lempira executed the envoys and declared his defiance. In response, Cáceres launched a direct assault against the fortress but found it impregnable. No roads climbed <b>the</b> <b>mountain,</b> <b>and</b> sheer wall prevented attempts to climb it. Well-engineered defences manned by large numbers of gathered warriors prevented the Spanish from storming the approaches, and horses were useless on the steep terrain. Cáceres had no choice except to lay close siege to the Peñol. He divided his men equally amongst the eight approaches to the fortress, and fierce fighting ensued, in which five Spaniards were killed and many were injured, including Cáceres. The siege held firm, {{but was unable to}} gain any ground.|$|E
5|$|Several {{relatively}} young obvious lava flows {{exist in the}} area around Adams.

Only one obvious flow appears on the south slopes of Adams, the A. G. Aiken Lava Bed. Other smaller flows exist in various locations around the mountain as well.|$|E
5|$|Soldiers of the ROK 1st Division {{captured}} a North Korean near Ka-san on September 4 {{who said that}} about 800 North Korean soldiers were on Ka-san with three more battalions following them from the north. The engineer company had succeeded only in establishing a perimeter briefly within the North Korean-held area. By evening of September 5, Ka-san was securely in North Korean hands with an estimated five battalions, totaling about 1,500 soldiers, on <b>the</b> <b>mountain</b> <b>and</b> its forward slope. A North Korean oxtrain carrying 82-mm. mortar shells and rice reportedly {{reached the top of}} Ka-san during the day. The ROK 1st Division captured this oxtrain a few days later south of Ka-san. By September 10, 400-500 North Koreans were on the ridge of Ka-San, as observed by a T-6 Mosquito spotter plane.|$|E
