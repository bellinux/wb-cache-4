5|$|Over one {{thousand}} artists and technicians {{were used in}} the making of Fantasia, which features more than 500 animated characters. Segments were color-keyed scene by scene so the colors in a single shot would harmonize between proceeding and following ones. Before a segment's narrative pattern was complete, an overall color scheme was designed to the general mood of the music, and patterned to correspond with the development of the subject matter. The studio's character model department would also sculpt three-dimensional clay models so the animators could view <b>their</b> <b>subject</b> from all angles.|$|E
5|$|Biblical Hebrew had {{a typical}} Semitic {{morphology}} with nonconcatenative morphology, arranging Semitic roots into patterns to form words. Biblical Hebrew distinguished two genders (masculine, feminine), three numbers (singular, plural, and uncommonly, dual). Verbs were marked for voice and mood, {{and had two}} conjugations which may have indicated aspect and/or tense (a matter of debate). The tense or aspect of verbs was also influenced by the conjugation , in the so-called waw-consecutive construction. Default word order was verb–subject–object, and verbs inflected for the number, gender, and person of <b>their</b> <b>subject.</b> Pronominal suffixes could be appended to verbs (to indicate object) or nouns (to indicate possession), and nouns had special construct states for use in possessive constructions.|$|E

50|$|Commercial kongsis {{are common}} in Chinese {{diasporic}} communities throughout the world, but the kongsi federations of Borneo were unique in that they were sovereign states that controlled large swaths of territory.

50|$|As a revivalist of the Christian historian, Christopher Dawson {{has been}} {{compared}} with Kenneth Scott Latourette and Herbert Butterfield.Comparisons have also been made between the work of Dawson and German sociologist and historian Max Weber.

In their 2016 ranking for social science, McMaster ranked 68th in the world and seventh in Canada. In the same year's ranking, for the field of clinical medicine McMaster ranked 51st in the world and fourth in Canada.|$|E
5|$|The society's early {{meetings}} included experiments performed {{first by}} Hooke {{and then by}} Denis Papin, who was appointed in 1684. These experiments varied in <b>their</b> <b>subject</b> area, and were both important in some cases and trivial in others. The society also published an English translation of Essays of Natural Experiments Made in the Accademia del Cimento, under the Protection of the Most Serene Prince Leopold of Tuscany in 1684, an Italian book documenting experiments at the Accademia del Cimento. Although meeting at Gresham College, the Society temporarily moved to Arundel House in 1666 after the Great Fire of London, which did not harm Gresham but did lead to its appropriation by the Lord Mayor. The Society returned to Gresham in 1673.|$|E
5|$|There is {{capacity}} for 450 pupils in the Sixth Form, including up to 50 people {{from outside the}} Academy. Along with Carre's Grammar School, St George's {{is part of the}} Sleaford Joint Sixth Form, which was founded in 1983 and included Kesteven and Sleaford High School until it withdrew in 2010. It provides a common timetable across both sites and allows for pupils to choose from A-Level options offered at both schools. Pupils may apply to be based at either school, where their pastoral and tutorial activities take place. Pupils are required meet minimum grade requirements for <b>their</b> <b>subject</b> choices and may have interviews to revise offers where appropriate. The Sixth Form has been based in the Arnold Centre since 2012. Sixth Formers are not required to wear school uniform, but must wear business-like attire, namely a lounge suit for boys, including a tie, and a business suit for girls, with either full-length trousers, or a knee-length skirt or dress.|$|E
