40|$|EU–US (European Union–United States) {{interactions}} {{in relation to}} the regulation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have been examined in detail in recent years. To do this scholars have tended to focus on a small number of high profile processes, such as the formal complaint of the US to the World Trade Organisation regarding the regulation of GMOs in the Europe. It is important to analyse developments of this kind but overemphasis on them has also lead to a distorted view of the case and a failure to appreciate the significance of other, less visible, types of interaction. In this paper we focus instead on trying to understand the roles played by various EU–US transnational networks—The <b>Transatlantic</b> Business <b>Dialogue,</b> The <b>Transatlantic</b> Economic Partnership, The <b>Transatlantic</b> Consumer <b>Dialogue,</b> The <b>Transatlantic</b> Environmental <b>Dialogue</b> and the EU–US Consultative Forum on Biotechnology. These networks have been trying to shape the regulation of GMOs in both jurisdictions since the mid 1990 s. By analysing them through a ‘governance lens’ we find that we can better understand EU–US interactions and the dynamics and influences around the regulation of GMOs. This gives us valuable insights into processes of contemporary governance...|$|R
