5|$|On top of {{the failure}} of the franchises to approve the spin-off, a series of {{lawsuits}} complicated the divestiture.

5|$|Cryptothecia rubrocincta {{is easily}} {{recognized}} by the bright red pigment in the thallus. The pigment, first isolated from the species by Hesse in 1904, is called chiodectonic acid. The lichen also contains the colorless depside compound confluentinic acid. A 2005 study employed the technique Raman spectroscopy to determine the chemical composition of the differently colored zones. The white crystalline zone contains calcium oxalate dihydrate, or weddellite, a chemical substance found in other lichens and extremophiles growing on calcium-rich surfaces. Some {{have suggested that the}} calcium oxalate serves in the organism's survival strategy: the storage of water as a crystalline hydrate is essential for periods of drought in desiccated environments, and calcium oxalate has been identified as dissuading herbivores. Because the lichen grows on calcium-poor surfaces, calcium ions are thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acquired</b> from rain, bird droppings, and airborne particles.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 2000, {{the first}} of several {{renovation}} plans was announced for the mall. The initial plan called for the addition of a new, three-story wing with an eighteen-screen movie theater complex, as well as several upscale tenants. Under this proposal, the existing Sears store would have been converted to mall space, and a new Sears store built immediately behind it. These expansion plans never came to fruition. By 2002, General Cinemas had sold the mall's theater complex to AMC Theatres. One year later, Pyramid made a failed attempt to evict the theaters for a Best Buy store, although Best Buy opened a store at the mall next to Sears in 2006. AMC closed the mall's theaters in 2004 and only four days after closing, the theater complex was acquired and reopened by Regal Entertainment Group. The JCPenney Home Store closed in 2002. Kaufmann's was one of several former May Co. brands <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>acquired</b> and renamed by Macy's in 2005, and while the main Kaufmann's store was converted to Macy's, the Home Store was shuttered. Also in 2006, The Bon-Ton closed.|$|E
