5|$|Chaplin {{founded a}} new {{production}} company, Attica, and used Shepperton Studios for the shooting.

Chaplin banned American journalists from its Paris première and decided not to release the film in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States.</b> <b>This</b> severely limited its revenue, although it achieved moderate commercial success in Europe.
