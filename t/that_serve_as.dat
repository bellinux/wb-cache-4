Some like Macat-ang, Tabonan, and Tambak {{are white}} sand beaches, while others, like Togbongan, are pebbled and rocky. The island's waters are also well-known dive sites, with corals <b>that</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> {{breeding ground for}} groupers, snappers, sharks, and stingrays.|$|E
5|$|An {{electric}} current, in {{the form}} of either alternating current or direct current from a welding power supply, is used to form an electric arc between the electrode and the metals to be joined. The workpiece and the electrode melts forming a pool of molten metal (weld pool) that cools to form a joint. As the weld is laid, the flux coating of the electrode disintegrates, giving off vapors <b>that</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> a shielding gas and providing a layer of slag, both of which protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination.|$|E

5|$|Half-Life 2: Episode One is a first-person shooter video game, {{the first}} in a series of episodes <b>that</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> the sequel to the 2004 Half-Life 2. It was {{developed}} by Valve Corporation and released on June 1, 2006. Originally called Half-Life 2: Aftermath, the game was later renamed to Episode One after Valve became confident in using an episodic structure for the game. Similar to Half-Life 2, Episode One also uses the Source game engine. The game debuted new lighting and animation technologies, as well as AI sidekick enhancements.|$|E
5|$|If {{the temple}} is small it {{will consist of}} only a closed mantapa (enclosed with walls {{extending}} {{all the way to}} the ceiling) and the shrine. The closed mantapa, well decorated inside and out, is larger than the vestibule connecting the shrine and the mantapa and has four lathe-turned pillars to support the ceiling, which may be deeply domed. The four pillars divide the hall into nine bays. The nine bays result in nine decorated ceilings. Pierced stone screens (Jali or Latticework) <b>that</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> windows in the navaranga (hall) and Sabhamantapa (congregation hall) is a characteristic Hoysala stylistic element.|$|E

5|$|Morchella rufobrunnea is the morel that is {{cultivated}} commercially per US patents 4594809 and 4757640. This {{process was}} developed in 1982 by Ronald Ower with {{what he thought was}} Morchella esculenta; M.rufobrunnea had not yet been described. The cultivation protocol consists of preparing a spawn culture that is mixed with nutrient-poor soil. This mixture is laid on nutrient-rich soil and kept sufficiently moist until fruiting. In the nutrient-poor substrate, the fungus forms sclerotia—hardened masses of mycelia <b>that</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> food reserves. Under appropriate environmental conditions, these sclerotia grow into morels.|$|E

There are also many charter schools that are run separately from school districts. In addition, some public school districts also have their own charter schools.|$|E

Many Armenian communities in the country are concentrated around churches <b>that</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> community centers. The first Armenian Apostolic church in America, named Church of Our Savior, was built in 1891 in Worcester. The American Diocese of the Church was established in 1898 by Catholicos Mkrtich Khrimian. In 1916 there were 34 Armenian parishes with 27,450 members with a predominantly male population. The top states with Armenian church followers were Massachusetts, Michigan, California and New York. The Western Diocese was established in 1927.|$|E
5|$|The Department Theatre {{presents}} {{a season of}} four professionally designed, produced and directed productions each year <b>that</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> a laboratory for students to put their learning into practice. This Main Stage season is presented at the Herbert and Nicole Wertheim Performing Arts Center. In addition to Main Stage productions students write, direct and perform productions in the Student Theatre Lab Studio, the annual New Plays Festival, and the summer Alternative Theatre Festival. The summer Alternative Theatre Festival includes a development project of a new work by an established playwright, a faculty directed piece, one student directed piece, and may include Alumni showcase and reunion productions.|$|E
5|$|In special relativity, {{energy is}} closely {{connected}} to momentum. Just as {{space and time}} are, in that theory, different aspects of a more comprehensive entity called spacetime, energy and momentum are merely different aspects of a unified, four-dimensional quantity that physicists call four-momentum. In consequence, if energy {{is a source of}} gravity, momentum must be a source as well. The same is true for quantities that are directly related to energy and momentum, namely internal pressure and tension. Taken together, in general relativity it is mass, energy, momentum, pressure and tension <b>that</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> sources of gravity: they are how matter tells spacetime how to curve. In the theory's mathematical formulation, all these quantities are but aspects of a more general physical quantity called the energy–momentum tensor.|$|E

5|$|Mississippi based Grapico Bottling Company {{troubles}} did not {{end with}} its union problems. In September 1924, John Henry Ennis of Ellisville, Mississippi purchased a Grapico. On drinking it, Ennis discovered that the contents were filled with flies, some of which he swallowed and became sick. On filing a lawsuit against Grapico Bottling Company and its sole stockholder, Philip Carriere, Ennis learned that Grapico Bottling Company had filed for and successfully dissolved itself as a corporation between the time Ennis consumed the flies and filed suit against Grapico Bottling. On appeal, the Supreme Court of Mississippi issued an opinion <b>that</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> precedent in Mississippi for the rule that a stockholder of a corporation is not liable for the debts, liabilities, and other acts of the corporation. After Grapico Bottling Company (Mississippi) dissolved in 1925, Rochell's Grapico Bottling Works became the sole supplier of Grapico to Mississippi.|$|E
5|$|The Capitol Loop {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} highway {{running through}} Lansing that was commissioned on October 13, 1989. It forms a loop route off I-496 through downtown near the Michigan State Capitol complex, home of the state legislature and several state departments. However, unlike other business loops in Michigan, it has unique reassurance markers—the signs <b>that</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> regular reminders of the name and number of the highway. It is known internally at MDOT as Connector496 for inventory purposes. The highway follows a series of one-way and two-way streets through downtown Lansing, directing traffic downtown to the State Capitol and other government buildings. Unlike the other streets downtown, the seven streets composing the Capitol Loop are under state maintenance and jurisdiction.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} horse training {{methods for}} Lipizzans were {{developed at the}} Spanish Riding School and {{are based on the}} principles of classical dressage, which in turn traces to the Ancient Greek writer Xenophon, whose works were rediscovered in the 16th century. His thoughts on development of horses' mental attitude and psyche are still considered applicable today. Other writers who strongly influenced the training methods of the Spanish Riding School include Federico Grisone, the founder of the first riding academy in Naples, who lived during the 16th century; and Antoine de Pluvinel and François Robichon de la Guérinière, two Frenchmen from the 17th and 18th centuries. The methods for training the Lipizzan stallions at the Spanish Riding School were passed down via an oral tradition until Field Marshal Franz Holbein and Johann Meixner, Senior Rider at the School, published the initial guidelines for the training of horse and rider at the School in 1898. In the mid-20th century, Alois Podhajsky wrote a number of works <b>that</b> <b>serve</b> <b>as</b> textbooks for many dressage riders today.|$|E
