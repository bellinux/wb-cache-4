Detroit has made the Summer Olympic Games' final bidding election more often than any other ultimately unsuccessful bid city, participating in IOC elections for the 1944 (3rd place, behind bid winner London), 1952 (5th place), 1956 (4th place), 1960 (3rd place), 1964 (2nd place), 1968 (2nd place) and 1972 (4th place) Games. (Los Angeles has made more <b>total</b> <b>bids</b> with nine, but hosted twice) If accepted as the U.S. candidate by USOC, this would be the city's eighth bid. Lowered crime figures improve Detroit's prospects for the USOC competition. Soft-drink manufacturer Faygo has stepped up its efforts as major sponsor. [...] Successful events such as Super Bowl XL have showcased Detroit as a city accustomed to hosting supersized crowds.|$|E
50|$|As noted above, the <b>total</b> <b>bids</b> must equal 11 {{in order}} for a hand to begin. However, some local house rules {{stipulate}} that when a member of any team reaches 30 points, the <b>total</b> <b>bids</b> in the hand must equal 12 for the hand to begin, because the person with 30 points now has a minimum bid of 3. The same occurs when a player reaches 40 points (his/her minimum bid is now 4, therefore the minimum number of bids is 13). Should a second player reach 30, the <b>total</b> <b>bids</b> in the hand should equal to 12.If any member opens their hand to no pictures including the Ace, the member can decide to re-deal the hand.Another variation requires one player to bid 5 tricks equalling to 10 points, but all other players must make minimum bid of 2 tricks. This variation is commonly referred to as five to run. It is a popular variation because it speeds up the flow of the game.|$|E

40|$|The authors aim {{to provide}} a set of tools to {{facilitate}} the main stages of the competitive bidding process for construction contractors. These involve 1) deciding whether to bid, 2) calculating the total price, and 3) breaking down the total price into the items {{of the bill of}} quantities or the schedule of payments to optimise contractor cash flows. To define factors that affect the decision to bid, the authors rely upon literature on the subject and put forward that multi-criteria methods are applied to calculate a single measure of contract attractiveness (utility value). An attractive contract implies that the contractor is likely to offer a lower price to increase chances of winning the competition. The <b>total</b> <b>bid</b> price is thus to be interpolated between the lowest acceptable and the highest justifiable price based on the contract attractiveness. With the <b>total</b> <b>bid</b> price established, {{the next step is to}} split it between the items of the schedule of payments. A linear programming model is proposed for this purpose. The application of the models is illustrated with a numerical example...|$|R
5000|$|The {{most obvious}} {{generalization}} to multiple or divisible goods {{is to have}} all winning bidders pay {{the amount of the}} highest non-winning bid. This is known as a uniform price auction. The uniform-price auction does not, however, result in bidders bidding their true valuations as they do in a second-price auction unless each bidder has demand for only a single unit. A generalization of the Vickrey auction that maintains the incentive to bid truthfully is known as the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism. The idea in VCG is that items are assigned to maximize the sum of utilities; then each bidder pays the [...] "opportunity cost" [...] that their presence introduces to all the other players. This opportunity cost for a bidder is defined as the <b>total</b> <b>bids</b> of all the other bidders that would have won if the first bidder had not bid, minus the <b>total</b> <b>bids</b> of all the other actual winning bidders.|$|E

40|$|A bidding {{strategy}} commonly {{observed in}} Internet auctions {{is that of}} jump-bidding, or entering a bid larger than {{what is necessary to}} be a currently winning bidder. In this paper, we argue that the cost associated with entering on-line bids and the uncertainty about future entry both of which distinguish Internet from live auctions can explain this phenomenon. We present a simple theoretical model that accounts for the preceding characteristics, and derive the conditions under which jump-bidding strategies arise in a format commonly used for on-line trading, the ascending-price auction. We also present evidence recorded from hundreds of Internet auctions that is consistent with the basic predictions from our model. We find that jump-bidding is more likely earlier in an Internet auction, when jumping has a larger strategic value, and that the incentives to jump bid increase as bidder competition becomes stronger. Our results also indicate that jump bidding is effective: jump bidders place fewer bids overall, and increased early jump bidding in auctions reduces the <b>total</b> <b>bids</b> placed. We also discuss possible means of reducing bidding costs, and evidence that Internet auctioneers are pursuing this goal. 1...|$|E
