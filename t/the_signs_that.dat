5|$|Street {{is in the}} Wells {{parliamentary}} constituency, which elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by {{the first}} past the post system. The current MP is James Heappey, elected in 2015, of the Conservative Party. Street {{is also in the}} South West England constituency of the European Parliament which elects six MEPs using the d'Hondt method of party-list proportional representation. Street is twinned with Isny im Allgäu, a town in south-eastern Baden-Württemberg, Germany, and Notre Dame de Gravenchon in Normandy, France.

A false warning might have led to cynicism about any later warnings, but delaying a warning until an eruption began might lead to thousands of deaths, so the volcanologists were under some pressure to deliver a timely and accurate assessment of the volcanic risk.|$|E

25|$|Manual {{babbling}} is structurally {{identical to}} vocal babbling in its development. Just as hearing and/or speaking infants babble with their mouths, infants {{who grow up}} with a sign language babble with their hands. If a hearing infant has deaf and/or mute parents or parents who otherwise use a sign language, {{he or she will}} still imitate <b>the</b> <b>signs</b> <b>that</b> they see their parents displaying. This is evidence that manual babbling is possible in both hearing and deaf infants, and in both speaking and mute infants.|$|E
25|$|Harlequin {{had also}} failed to adapt quickly to <b>the</b> <b>signs</b> <b>that</b> readers {{appreciated}} novels with more explicit sex scenes, and in 1980, several publishers entered the category romance market to fill that gap. That year, Dell launched their Candlelight Ecstasy line with Amii Lorin's The Tawny Gold Man, becoming the first line to waive the requirement that heroines be virgins. By the end of 1983 sales for the Candlelight Ecstasy line totaled $30 million. Silhoeutte also launched similar lines, Desire (sexually explicit) and Special Edition (sexually explicit and longer stories, up to 250 pages), each of which had a 90–100% sellout rate each month.|$|E
25|$|The Seeker (also {{known as}} The Seeker: The Dark Is Rising) is a 2007 American family drama-fantasy film {{adaptation}} of the second book in the five-book young adult fantasy series The Dark Is Rising by Susan Cooper. The film is directed by David L. Cunningham and stars Ian McShane, Alexander Ludwig, Frances Conroy, Gregory Smith, and Christopher Eccleston as the Rider. The Seeker is the first film to be produced by 20th Century Fox and Walden Media {{as part of their}} Fox-Walden partnership. On his 14th birthday Will Stanton (Ludwig) finds out that he is the last of a group of warriors – The Light – who have spent their lives fighting against evil – The Dark. Will travels through time to track down <b>the</b> <b>signs</b> <b>that</b> will enable him to confront the evil forces. The Dark is personified by The Rider (Eccleston). This film adaptation drew strong negative reaction from fans of the book series for its disregard of the source material.|$|E

25|$|In his {{earliest}} works, Orellana shows some of <b>the</b> <b>signs</b> <b>that</b> {{were to become}} the Neo-figuration, with expressive and yet undefined figures. Orellana's works from this period are distinguished for their almost monochromatic nature, where most figures appear in black and grayscale, to the point that, {{even though there is}} a predominant use of oxides and sand, they had an almost watercoulour appearance. On 8 December 1959, the Grupo Hondo proclaims its Neo-figurative theoric principles in a manifesto written by the poet Manuel Conde, of which Orellana is a founding member. In this period, Orellana reaches maturity as an artist, and his paintings reach the confluence of informal abstraction and the mannerism of an existential figuration that would seem even mystical in its representation. In this period, Orellana's work is enriched in terms of colour and texture, developing his artistic expression in a most definite manner.|$|E

2500|$|In Ptolemy’s era the {{boundaries}} of the zodiac signs were close to those of the visible constellations whose names they bear, but Ptolemy demonstrates the theoretical distinction between the two frames of reference in describing the starting point of the zodiac as fixed, not to the stars, but to the mathematically calculated vernal equinox. [...] This determines the seasonally based tropical zodiac which takes its name from the Greek word τροπικός tropikos: ‘of the turning’, [...] because it is set {{by the turn of the}} seasons and, being subject to precession, experiences a slow and gradual revolution through the visible constellations. [...] For the same reason, <b>the</b> <b>signs</b> <b>that</b> mark the Sun’s summer and winter solstice points (Cancer and Capricorn) are described as the 'tropical signs', since these are the places where the Sun 'turns' its direction in celestial latitude, (thereby defining the terrestrial circles of latitude known as the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn).|$|E
2500|$|The contextual {{relevancy}} of Isac's lyrical {{tributes to}} Joseph Stalin {{was assessed by}} literary historians such as Diana Câmpean and Mariana Gorczyca, who researched the impact of communization on the various literary magazines of the 1950s and '60s. In Câmpean's view, Scrisoare către Stalin as one of <b>the</b> <b>signs</b> <b>that</b> Steaua was [...] "tributary to proletkult demands", as a package for the other content, which was more focused on the [...] "actual" [...] and [...] "valuable" [...] elements in Romanian literature (from the celebration of its dead classics to the recovery of non-political voices such as Blaga). According to Gorczyca, Isac's 1949 poem, together with similar ones by Ion Brad, Victor Felea and Miron Radu Paraschivescu, illustrates the [...] "embarrassing obedience" [...] to a political line imposed on writers by the country's officials. To underline its circumstantial nature, she notes that the Steaua of the mid 1960s (that is, during De-Stalinization) replaced its cult of Stalin with that of Vladimir Lenin, and afterwards dropped most politicized content. In autumn 1953, as Anatol E. Baconsky was facing a political investigation for having opened Steaua to non-political content, official critic Mihu Dragomir suggested that [...] "maestro Emil Isac"'s contributions were a good poetic standard to follow, urging Baconsky to again endorse it.|$|E
2500|$|However, similar {{definitions}} can be {{made that}} eliminate the need for prior construction of the ordinals. [...] For instance, we could let the surreals be the (recursively-defined) class of functions whose domain is a subset of the surreals satisfying the transitivity rule ∀g ∈ dom f [...] (∀h ∈ dom g (h ∈ dom f [...] )) and whose range is { −, + }. [...] "Simpler than" [...] is very simply defined nowmdash&x is simpler than y [...] if x ∈ dom y. [...] The total ordering is defined by considering x and y as sets of ordered pairs (as a function is normally defined): [...] Either x = y, [...] or else the surreal number z = x ∩ y [...] is in the domain of x [...] or the domain of y [...] (or both, but in this case the signs must disagree). [...] We then have x < y [...] if x(z) = − or y(z) = + (or both). [...] Converting these functions into sign sequences is a straightforward task; arrange the elements of dom f [...] in order of simplicity (i.e., inclusion), and then write down <b>the</b> <b>signs</b> <b>that</b> f assigns to each of these elements in order. [...] The ordinals then occur naturally as those surreal numbers whose range is { + }.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fifth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Moses exhorted the Israelites to revere God, to walk only in God's paths, to love God, to serve God {{with all their}} heart and soul, and to keep God's commandments. Moses noted that {{although}} heaven and earth belong to God, God was drawn to love their fathers, so that God chose the Israelites from among all peoples. Moses described God as supreme, great, mighty, and awesome, showing no favor and taking no bribe, but upholding {{the cause of the}} fatherless and the widow, and befriending the stranger. Moses thus instructed the Israelites to befriend the stranger, for they were strangers in Egypt. Moses exhorted the Israelites to revere God, worship only God, and swear only by God's name, for God was their glory, who performed for them marvelous deeds, and made them as numerous as the stars. Moses exhorted the Israelites to love God and always keep God's commandments. Moses asked the Israelites to note that they themselves witnessed <b>the</b> <b>signs</b> <b>that</b> God performed in Egypt against Pharaoh, what God did to Egypt's army, how God rolled upon them the waters of the Sea of Reeds, what God did for them in the wilderness, and what God did to Dathan and Abiram when the earth swallowed them. Moses instructed them therefore to keep all the law so that they might have the strength to enter and possess the land and long endure on that land flowing with milk and honey. The fifth reading ( [...] , aliyah) and a closed portion ( [...] , setumah) end here.|$|E
2500|$|Germany had {{the highest}} {{literacy}} rate in Europe; Franklin suggests that Hanna's illiteracy represented the ignorance that allowed ordinary people to commit atrocities. Nicholas Wroe, in the Guardian, likewise writes {{of the relationship between}} Hanna's illiteracy and the Third Reich's [...] "moral illiteracy," [...] and Ron Rosenbaum of Slate says that Hanna is [...] "a stand-in for the German people and their supposed inability to 'read' <b>the</b> <b>signs</b> <b>that</b> mass murder was being done in their name, by their fellow citizens." [...] Michael's relationship with Hanna, partly erotic and partly maternal, stands for the ambivalent relationship of present-day Germany and its Nazi past: the past is [...] "mother" [...] of Michael's generation, and he eventually finds out, like other Germans of his generation, that his [...] "parents" [...] were guilty. [...] "The paralyzing shame, the psychic numbing, the moral failures of the 'lucky late-born' are the novel's central focus," [...] writes Suzanne Ruta in the New York Times. Only through his relationship with Hanna can Michael get well; Franklin interprets that to mean that [...] "postwar Germany is sick, and it can begin to heal only through its encounter with the Nazi past." [...] Richard Bernstein of the New York Times also notes that [...] "In some sense, perhaps, Hanna can be seen to stand in for the larger German quandary of remembrance and atonement," [...] but prefers not to read the novel as an allegory. That said, the novel is about Michael, not Hanna; the original German title, Der Vorleser, specifically indicates one who reads aloud, as Michael does for Hanna.|$|E
