2500|$|The {{condition}} currently {{known as}} CRPS was originally described during the American Civil War by Silas Weir Mitchell, who is sometimes also credited with inventing the name [...] "causalgia." [...] However, this term was actually coined by Mitchell's friend Robley Dunglison from the Greek words for heat and for pain. Contrary {{to what is}} commonly accepted, it emerges that these causalgias were certainly major by {{the importance of the}} vasomotor and sudomotor symptoms but stemmed from minor neurological lesions. Mitchell even thought that the cause of CRPS came from the cohabitation of the altered and unaltered cutaneous fibres on <b>the</b> same <b>nerve</b> distribution territory. In the 1940s, the term reflex sympathetic dystrophy came into use to describe this condition, based on the theory that sympathetic hyperactivity was involved in the pathophysiology. In 1959, Noordenbos observed in causalgia patients that [...] "the damage of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> partial." [...] Misuse of the terms, as well as doubts about the underlying pathophysiology, led to calls for better nomenclature. In 1993, a special consensus workshop held in Orlando, Florida, provided the umbrella term [...] "complex regional pain syndrome", with causalgia and RSD as subtypes.|$|R

40|$|Background: Plantar heel pain {{may result}} from several {{conditions}} such as tarsal tunnel syndrome (TTS) and plantar fasciitis. The dorsiflexion-eversion test is used to diagnose TTS, whereas the windlass test is used for plantar fasciitis. Given the similarity between both tests, {{the purpose of this study}} was to evaluate whether these tests are able to selectively load the structures which they aim to examine. Methods: Both tests were evaluated in six cadavers by measuring strain in the plantar fascia, tibial nerve, lateral plantar nerve (LPN), and medial plantar nerve (MPN) using miniature displacement transducers. Longitudinal excursion of <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> <b>was</b> measured with a digital caliper. Results: With the dorsiflexion-eversion test, dorsiflexion and eversion of the ankle in combination with extension of the metatarsophalangeal (NITP) joints significantly increased strain in <b>the</b> tibial <b>nerve</b> (+ 1. 1 %), LPN (+ 2. 2 %), and MPN (+ 3. 3 %) but also in the plantar fascia (+ 1. 2 %) (all: p = 0. 016). Both components (dorsiflexion-eversion and MTP extension) resulted in significant increases. With the windlass test, extension of all MTP joints significantly increased strain in the plantar fascia (+ 0. 4 %, p = 0. 016), but also in <b>the</b> tibial <b>nerve</b> (+ 0. 4 %, p = 0. 016), LPN (+ 0. 8 %, p = 0. 032) and MPN (+ 2. 0 %, p = 0. 016).

50|$|The lumbar plexus {{is formed}} from the {{anterior}} rami of nerves L1 to L4 and some fibers from T12.

40|$|Background: The {{anatomical}} {{orientation of}} {{structures in the}} axilla has not been well studied, although {{it is essential for}} a neat and safe dissection. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the relations between neurovascular structures in the axilla as they were encountered during axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for breast cancer. Methods: This was a prospective study of 29 consecutive ALNDs accompanying either mastectomy or wide local excision. The dissections were conducted in a stepwise manner and the orientation of the structures was determined as the dissections advanced from superficial to deeper planes. Results: The medial pectoral pedicle was the most superficial neurovascular structure encountered during the dissections and was curled around the lateral border of the pectoralis minor muscle in most cases. <b>The</b> intercostobrachial <b>nerve</b> lay 1 â 2 Â cm behind and below, and the axillary vein was located 2 â 3 Â cm behind and above the pedicle. <b>The</b> long thoracic <b>nerve</b> <b>was</b> constantly found 2 â 3 Â cm behind <b>the</b> intercostobrachial <b>nerve.</b> <b>The</b> thoracodorsal <b>nerve</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> accompanied by a posterior tributary of the axillary vein.

I shook a pasteboard box close before the eyes {{of one of my}} infants, when 114 days old, and it did not in the least wink; but when I put a few comfits into the box, holding it in the same position as before, and rattled them, the child blinked its eyes violently every time, and started a little. It was obviously impossible that a carefully-guarded infant could have learnt by experience that a rattling sound near its eyes indicated danger to them. But such experience will have been slowly gained at a later age during a long series of generations; and from what we know of inheritance, there is nothing improbable in the transmission of a habit to the offspring at an earlier age than that at which it was first acquired by the parents.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Phrenic <b>nerve</b> {{transfer}} has <b>been</b> {{used for}} treating lesions of the brachial plexus since 1970. Although, today, surgeons are more experienced with the technique, {{there are still}} widespread concerns about its effects on pulmonary function. This study was undertaken {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} and safety of this procedure. METHODS: Fourteen patients with complete palsy of the upper limb were submitted to phrenic nerve transfer as part of a strategy for surgical reconstruction of their plexuses. Two patients were lost to follow-up, and 2 patients were followed for less than 2 years. Of the remaining 10 patients, 9 (90 %) were male. The lesions affected both sides equally. The mean age of the patients was 24. 8 years (range, 14 - 43 years), and the mean interval from injury to surgery was 6 months (range, 3 - 9 months). <b>The</b> phrenic <b>nerve</b> <b>was</b> <b>always</b> transferred to <b>the</b> musculocutaneous <b>nerve,</b> and a nerve graft (mean length, 8 cm; range, 4. 5 - 12 cm) was necessary in all cases. RESULTS: There was no major complication related to the surgery. Seven patients (70 %) recovered functional level biceps strength (Medical Research Council grade >= 3). All of the patients exhibited a transient decrease in pulmonary function tests, but without clinical respiratory problems. CONCLUSION: On the basis of our small series and data from the literature, we conclude that phrenic nerve transfer in well-selected patients is a safe and effective procedure for recovering biceps function...|$|R

Blind and image-guided techniques have been described, {{all of which}} target <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> within <b>the</b> supraspinous fossa or at the suprascapular notch. This classic target point <b>is</b> not <b>always</b> ideal when ultrasound (US) is used because it is located deep under the muscles, and hence <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>is</b> not <b>always</b> visible.

METHODS: In the first step, 60 volunteers were scanned with US, both in the supraclavicular and the classic target area. The visibility of the SSN in both regions was compared. In the second step, 20 needles were placed into or immediately next to the SSN in the supraclavicular region of 10 cadavers. The accuracy of needle placement was determined by injection of dye and following dissection. RESULTS: In the supraclavicular region of volunteers, <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>was</b> identified in 81 % of examinations (95 % confidence interval [CI], 74 %- 88 %) and located at a median depth of 8 mm (interquartile range, 6 - 9 mm).

40|$|AbstractãObjective: Although most {{of nerve}} in-juries {{associated}} with Monteggia fracture-dislocation in children are neurapraxias and will recover spontaneously after conservative treatment, surgical exploration of <b>the</b> in-volved <b>nerve</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> required in <b>the</b> cases with the en-trapment of posterior interosseous <b>nerve</b> (PIN). However, <b>the</b> necessity and time frame for surgical intervention for specific patterns of nerve dysfunction remains controversial. The {{aim of the}} report is to observe and understand the pathology of PIN injury associated with Monteggia frac-ture-dislocation in children, and to propose the possible indication for <b>the</b> exploration of <b>nerve.</b> Methods: Eight cases, six boys and two girls, with Monteggia fracture-dislocation complicated by PIN injury, managed operatively at the authorsâ Hospital from 2007 to 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. All the patients under-went the attempted closed reduction before they received exploration of PIN, with open reduction and internal fixation or successful closed reduction. Results: The PIN {{was found to be}} trapped acutely posterior to the radiocapitellar joint in 4 out of 5 Type III Badoâs Monteggia fractures. In the remaining cases, since there were longer time intervals from injury to operation, chronic compressive changes and epineural fibrosis of ra-dial <b>nerve</b> <b>were</b> visualized. After a microsurgical neurolysis performed, the complete recovery in <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> function <b>was</b> obtained in all the cases during the follow-up. Conclusion: The findings from this study suggest that every case of type III Monteggia fracture-dislocation with decreased or absent function of muscles innervated by PIN and an irreducible radial head in children should be viewed as an indication for immediate surgical exploration of <b>the</b> involved <b>nerve</b> to exclude a potential PIN entrapment.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examines}} {{the sequence of}} maturation of sensory nerve terminals that can be identified on primate facial guard hairs. At birth, the sensory innervation of both guard and vellus hairs is mature in that lanceolate, Ruffini, and free nerve ending (FNE) terminals can be identified and resemble those of the adult. Presumptive lanceolate terminals can be identified {{at the beginning of}} the third trimester of gestation, and other axons present are either Ruffini or FNEs, but definite identification is not possible. In the latter half of the second trimester only axons arranged circumferentially are present, resembling FNE or Ruffini terminals. Some of these axons directly abut the hair follicle and might eventually become lanceolate endings. <b>The</b> earliest <b>nerve</b> terminals associated with hairs cytologically resemble FNE or Ruffini terminals. At the onset of hair differentiation in the early part of <b>the</b> second trimester, <b>nerves</b> <b>were</b> <b>always</b> associated with developing epithelial hair placodes. Branching Schwann cells in the axons radiating toward the epidermis in these youngest embryos studied were best identified by electron microscopy. The early development of afferent nerve fibers in hairy skin provides an anatomical substrate for the known reflexogenic activity of primate embryos. Adequate cytologic criteria are thus available for the identification of sensory terminals in growing, differentiating, and presumably regenerating axons in primate hairy skin...|$|R

The lateral root of <b>the</b> medial <b>nerve</b> <b>was</b> formed in 55. 56 % of cases from a single nerve fascicle, in 44. 44 % of cases consisting of two <b>nerve</b> fascicles. <b>The</b> medial root was formed in 61. 11 % of cases from a single nerve fascicle, in 38. 89 % of the cases being made up of two nerve fascicles. In 27. 78 % of cases, the medial root passed behind the axillary artery. Regarding the volume of the two roots, we found that in 44. 44 % of the cases, the lateral root was more voluminous, in 27. 78 % of cases, the median root was larger and in 27. 78 % of cases, the two roots were approximately equal. We have encountered situations where a ramification for the forearms muscles emerged from the lateral root. Occasionally, a ram for the brachial muscle was detached from the medial root, and from the lateral root a ram for the biceps muscle, both muscles receiving branches also from <b>the</b> musculocutaneous <b>nerve.</b> We have encountered a single case where <b>the</b> median <b>nerve</b> inches <b>the</b> anterior muscles of the arm, missing <b>the</b> musculocutaneous <b>nerve.</b> In cases of low joining of the roots, we have encountered cases where a lateral root formed a ram for forearm muscles. The anastomoses between <b>the</b> two median <b>nerve</b> roots can sometimes be located just above their union or anterior to the lower portion of the axillary artery. In one case, we encountered between the two roots, above their union, the existence of three oblique anastomoses, the two upper ones from the lateral to the medial root, and the third from the medial root to the lateral root. Common are anastomoses between the roots of the roots and the root on the opposite side. The most common are the anastomosis between the medial fascicle of the lateral root and the medial root of <b>the</b> median <b>nerve.</b> In one case, we encountered a double overlap between <b>the</b> musculocutaneous <b>nerve</b> and <b>the</b> lateral <b>nerve</b> root.

40|$|Recently, several {{methods have}} been {{developed}} to verify exposure to nerve agents. Most of these methods, such as the fluoride reactivation technique and the analysis of inhibited phosphonylated butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), are based on mass spectrometry. The high specificity of the mass spectrometer might also imply a disadvantage, because the acquisition mass, i. e. the identity of the analyte must be known beforehand in order to direct the MS analysis in the most sensitive mode. In real cases, the identity of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> agent <b>is</b> not <b>always</b> known beforehand and the mass spectrometer should be operated in a scanning mode, with the consequence that sensitivity of the method will be lower. Comprehensive GC, or GC Ã GC, is a technique which offers enhanced separation. The implied larger selectivity of the GC separation allows mass spectrometry to be conducted in a less specific, scanning, mode. By the use of this configuration, the identity of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> agent {{does not have to be}} known beforehand but can be traced. In order to be able to detect lower concentrations and assess lower exposure levels, a large volume injection technique was developed allowing sample sizes up to 100 Î¼L. The technique was tested with plasma samples that had been inhibited with various <b>nerve</b> agents. Subsequently, <b>the</b> cholinesterase-bound <b>nerve</b> agent <b>was</b> regenerated by the fluoride reactivation technique. Using the newly developed comprehensive GC-MS method it was possible to detect nerve agent at an exposure level of 1 % BuChE inhibition, which is approximately 70 pg nerve agent/mL. These low exposure levels cannot be verified with a cholinesterase (ChE) activity assay. Moreover, the identity of <b>the</b> regenerated <b>nerve</b> agent <b>was</b> verified by the mass spectrum that was generated by the TOF mass spectrometer. This paper presents a technique able to deliver full-scan data on <b>the</b> analysis of <b>nerve</b> agents in biomedical samples at relevant exposure levels (1 % BuChE inhibition).

40|$|Innervation of flexor muscles (the Brachialis and the biceps brachii) and an {{extensor}} (the triceps brachii) of the elbowjoint {{was examined}} in 61 dogs, 25 monkeys and 2 men. 1. Macroscopically <b>the</b> musculocutaneous <b>nerve</b> innervating <b>the</b> flexor muscles is usually formed from C_ 6 and C_ 7 (2 roots), and <b>the</b> radial <b>nerve</b> which innervates <b>the</b> extensors is from C_ 7, C_ 8 and T, (3 roots). Degeneration experiments show, however, that <b>the</b> ventral <b>nerve</b> fibres innervating <b>the</b> flexors {{are derived from}} C_ 6 to T, (4 segments), and the dorsal root fibres are from C_ 5 to T_ 3 (7 segments). Further, the ventral root fibres innervating extensors are derived from C_ 7 to T, (3 segments), and dorsal root fibres are from C_ 6 to T_ 2 (5 segments). Thus, <b>the</b> extensor-muscle <b>nerves</b> originate 1 segment caudal than <b>the</b> flexor-muscle <b>nerves,</b> and <b>the</b> flexor and extensor muscles are innervated by more roots from <b>the</b> dorsal <b>nerve</b> fibres than those from the ventral fibres. 2. The ratios between myelinated <b>nerve</b> fibres to <b>the</b> extensors and those to the flexors are 1 : 0. 41 in dog, 1 : 0. 48 in green monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops), 1 : 0. 64 in crab-eating monkey (Macaca cynomolga) and 1 : 0. 83 in man. It appears therefore that the higher the animals, the more the development of <b>the</b> flexor <b>nerves.</b> 3. Myelinated nerve fibres per gram of flexor and extensor muscles are 96. 9 and 48. 4 in number from dog, 203. 3 and 124. 2 from crab-eating monkey, and 152. 3 and 123. 1 from green monkey, respectively. Thus, the innervation rate of <b>the</b> flexor muscle <b>nerves</b> <b>is</b> <b>always</b> {{higher than that of}} the extensor. 4. The most of <b>the</b> myelinated <b>nerve</b> fibres innervating voluntary muscles are maximum-sized in dog, monkey and man. The more decrease in diameter of <b>the</b> myelinated <b>nerve</b> fibres <b>the</b> smaller in number of those fibres. No difference of <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> fibre diameter <b>is</b> found between the flexor and extensor <b>nerves.</b> 5. <b>The</b> ratio between sensory fibres from dorsal roots and motor fibres from ventral roots is 58. 4 %: 41. 6 % in the flexor, and 69. 6 %: 30. 4 % in <b>the</b> extensor <b>nerves</b> in dog. Thus, the number of sensory nerve fibres always predominate over motor <b>nerve</b> fibres. There <b>are</b> relatively many motor <b>nerve</b> fibres in <b>the</b> flexor muscles than in the extensors, and, on the contrary, many sensory fibres in the extensors...|$|R

40|$|Background/Objective: Our {{aim was to}} {{optimize}} the most effective MR imaging sequence for visualization of the 12 th cranial nerve (hypoglossal nerve) through its cisternal course. "nPatients and Methods: We applied balanced fast-field echo (B-FFE), 3 D-T 2 weighted Driven Equilibrium RF Reset Pulse (DRIVE), T 2 weighted 2 D TSE and post-contrast T 1 weighted sequences and {{tried to find out}} the best sequence for the perfect visualization of the 12 th cranial nerve. One-hundred patients without any hypoglossal <b>nerve</b> paralysis <b>were</b> examined via these sequences. Imaging analysis was graded as follows: certain visualization of nerves (score 2), partially visualized nerves (score 1), non-visualized nerves (score 0). "nResults: <b>The</b> hypoglossal <b>nerve</b> <b>was</b> visualized exactly in only eight cases and partially depicted in only six cases with the post-contrast T 1 series. In B-FFE sequence; 56 % of <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> <b>were</b> properly seen and 8 % of <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> <b>were</b> partially identified, using T 2 weighted DRIVE sequences; 30 % of <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> <b>were</b> clearly visualized, <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> <b>were</b> partially depicted in 15 patients. Regarding the T 2 weighted TSE sequence, 15 % of <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> <b>were</b> certainly depicted and in seven patients <b>the</b> <b>nerves</b> <b>were</b> partially depicted. "nConclusion: The most diagnostic sequence for the exact visualization of the cisternal course of hypoglossal <b>nerve</b> <b>is</b> B-FFE revealing a 64 % visualization rate for the cisternal parts (112 exactly, 16 partially). T 2 W DRIVE sequence is shown to be more diagnostic than the T 2 W TSE for visualization of the cisternal part of <b>the</b> hypoglossal <b>nerve.</b> &nbsp; &nbsp...|$|R
50|$|The {{symptoms}} and signs depend on which <b>nerve</b> <b>is</b> affected, where along its length <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>is</b> affected, and how severely <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>is</b> affected.

500|$|<b>The</b> {{hypoglossal}} <b>nerve</b> <b>is</b> {{tested by}} examining the tongue and its movements. At rest, if <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>is</b> injured a tongue may appear to have {{the appearance of a}} [...] "bag of worms" [...] (fasciculations) or wasting (atrophy). <b>The</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>is</b> then tested by sticking the tongue out. If there <b>is</b> damage to <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> or its pathways, the tongue will usually but not always deviate to one side. [...] When <b>the</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>is</b> damaged, <b>the</b> tongue may feel [...] "thick", [...] "heavy", or [...] "clumsy." [...] Weakness of tongue muscles can result in slurred speech, affecting sounds particularly dependent on the tongue for generation (i.e., lateral approximants, dental stops, alveolar stops, velar nasals, rhotic consonants etc.). Tongue strength may be tested by poking the tongue against the inside of their cheek, while an examiner feels or presses from the cheek.|$|R
