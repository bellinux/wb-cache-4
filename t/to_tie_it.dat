5|$|After Parise's {{penalty was}} served, it was Canada's turn {{to go on}} the power play, and Esposito scored his sixth goal of the series <b>to</b> <b>tie</b> <b>it</b> at 1–1. The teams {{exchanged}} power plays before Lutchenko scored a power play goal on a slap shot to put the Soviets ahead 2–1. Brad Park then scored his only goal of the series at even strength to complete some pretty passing between Dennis Hull and the Rangers' teammates of Ratelle, Gilbert and Park to tie the score. The period ended with the teams tied 2–2.|$|E

5|$|Bulldogs battled the Dayton Triangles in week five. The Bulldogs {{opened the}} scoring {{in the first}} quarter on a two-yard rushing {{touchdown}} by Pete Calac. But the Triangles came back in the second quarter, scoring twice: back Frank Bacon had a four-yard rushing touchdown, and end Dave Reese had a 50-yard receiving touchdown. Guyon scored a 22-yard rushing touchdown during the corner, but the extra point sailed wide. In the third quarter, the Triangles responded with a 3-yard rushing touchdown by back Lou Partlow, but Dayton missed the extra point to make the score 20–14. Thorpe then came into the game, and kicked a 45-yard field goal to bring his team within three points. In the final minutes, Thorpe kicked another 35-yard field goal <b>to</b> <b>tie</b> <b>it.</b> The Triangles were the first team to score on the Bulldogs since the opening game of the previous year.|$|E

5|$|Nowitzki {{began playing}} for the German {{national}} basketball team in 1997. In his debut tournament, the EuroBasket 1999, the 21-year-old rookie emerged as the main German scorer, but Germany finished seventh and failed {{to qualify for the}} 2000 Olympic Games. In the EuroBasket 2001, Nowitzki was top scorer with 28.7 points per game, and narrowly lost the MVP vote to Serbian player Peja Stojaković. Germany reached the semifinals and were close to beating host nation Turkey, but Hedo Türkoğlu hit a 3-point buzzer beater <b>to</b> <b>tie</b> <b>it,</b> and the Turks eventually won in overtime. Germany then lost 99–90 against Spain, and did not win a medal. However, with averages of 28.7 points and 9.1 rebounds, Nowitzki led the tournament in both statistics, and was voted to the All-Star team. Back home, the German basketball team attracted up to 3.7 million television viewers, a German basketball record at the time.|$|E
5|$|The Regional Championship matched Tennessee {{with the}} 2nd-seeded Tar Heels, who were coming {{off of a}} 6-point victory over 3rd-seeded Illinois. Summitt's team started off with a 17–11 lead, only to falter and allow Carolina <b>to</b> <b>tie</b> <b>it</b> up at 21. Tennessee responded with a 12–6 run to end the first, but Carolina {{answered}} by opening the second half with the first seven points, giving them a one-point lead, 34–33, {{and the first time}} an opponent had held a lead over Tennessee in over three months. Carolina slowly extended the lead as the game continued, until they were eventually leading 61–49, at which point Summitt sent several players, including Holdsclaw (who was on the bench due to a poor shooting performance) back onto the floor. A minute later, Tennessee had cut the deficit to five, and by the five-minute mark the game was tied again, at 62. The teams traded baskets, tying the game at 64 and 66, before Tennessee reached a 70–67 lead, with less than ninety seconds remaining. Carolina was soon forced to start fouling the Lady Vols, who made their free throws and advanced to the Final Four, 76–70. Holdsclaw once again led all scorers, this time with 29, and Semeka Randall had 20. North Carolina was led by Wright and Reid, who had 21 and 20.|$|E

25|$|The ace {{race was}} still on; Boelcke {{became the first}} Überkanone with his 10th victory on 12 March; the {{following}} day, even as he scored, Immelmann scored {{one of the first}} double victories of the war <b>to</b> <b>tie</b> <b>it</b> up at 11 all. The dead heat lasted for a week; on 19 March, Boelcke used his usual tactics of pointblank fire to kill the enemy pilot and saw off his Farman's wing with machine gun fire, for win number 12. Immelmann telephoned to congratulate him and ask him for an opportunity to catch up; Boelcke jokingly offered him a week's grace. Boelcke's victory two days later may be seen as symptomatic of his disregard for Immelmann.|$|E
25|$|The Netherlands' {{target was}} {{therefore}} 198 to win (in 36 overs), or 197 <b>to</b> <b>tie.</b> <b>It</b> is fair that their target was increased, {{even though they}} had the same number of overs to bat as Australia, as Australia would have batted less conservatively in their first 28 overs, and scored more runs at the expense of more wickets, if they had known that their innings would only be 36 overs long. Increasing the Netherlands' target score neutralizes the injustice done to Australia when they were denied some of the overs to bat they thought they would get. The Netherlands were all out for 122, giving Australia victory by 197 minus& 122 = 75 runs.|$|E

25|$|The fourth {{chapter of}} this {{treatise}} includes an exposition {{of the method}} of least squares, a remarkable testimony to Laplace's command over the processes of analysis. In 1805 Legendre had published the method of least squares, making no attempt <b>to</b> <b>tie</b> <b>it</b> {{to the theory of}} probability. In 1809 Gauss had derived the normal distribution from the principle that the arithmetic mean of observations gives the most probable value for the quantity measured; then, turning this argument back upon itself, he showed that, if the errors of observation are normally distributed, the least squares estimates give the most probable values for the coefficients in regression situations. These two works seem to have spurred Laplace to complete work toward a treatise on probability he had contemplated as early as 1783.|$|E
