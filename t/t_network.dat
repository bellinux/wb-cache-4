40|$|The {{application}} of a new method for fault diagnosis in an automotive diesel engine is presented. Two common types of fault are investigated: (i) sensor fault, caused by a bias in the inlet manifold pressure sensor and (ii) process fault, caused by small air leaks in the inlet manifold plenum chamber. Such faults may lead to increased emission levels which, if left undetected, can eventually degrade engine performance. A diagnostic model using a variant of auto-associative neural networks (AANN), which has a unique architecture which shows great potential for fault diagnosis, is investigated. This new variant uses a reduced set of original data for the input-target network and is denoted as a generalized serial T 2 T (GST 2 <b>T)</b> <b>network.</b> The proposed GST 2 T model is experimentally validated using data from a real engine embedded in a chassis dynamometer at a test-cell facility.

We have previously reported that ABA-specific Ts repertoires matured in normal and Ig-deficient environments differ from one another in their composition, and consequently, their functionally expressed Igh restrictions. The present report characterizes the impact of natural development of mature B cell activity upon the composition of the Ts repertoire. After stopping anti-mu treatment of C.

The resulting dual Ts repertoire, characterized by expression of parallel, idiotypically restricted <b>Ts</b> <b>networks,</b> is demonstrable for at least 13 wk.
