Her parents separated when she was young; but according to Tanuja, Kajol was not affected by the split as [...] "we never argued in front of [...] ". In the absence of her mother, Kajol was looked after by her maternal grandmother, who [...] "never let me feel <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> away and working". According to Kajol, her mother inculcated a sense of independence in her at a very young age. Growing up between two separate cultures, she inherited her [...] "Maharashtrian pragmatism" [...] from her mother and her [...] "Bengali temperament" [...] from her father.|$|E
2500|$|Charles's mother, Elizabeth Dickens, did not {{immediately}} support his removal from the boot-blacking warehouse. This influenced Dickens's view that a father should rule the family, and a mother find her proper sphere inside the home: [...] "I never afterwards forgot, I never shall forget, I never can forget, <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> warm for my being sent back". His mother's failure to request his return {{was a factor in}} his dissatisfied attitude towards women.|$|E
2500|$|It {{must have}} been late 1941 or early 1942. Jews were {{required}} to wear the Star of David and to obey a 6p.m. curfew. I had gone {{to play with a}} Christian friend and had stayed too late. I turned my brown sweater inside out to walk the few blocks home. As I was walking down an empty street, I saw a German soldier approaching. He was wearing the black uniform that I had been told to fear more than others – the one worn by specially recruited SS soldiers. As I came closer to him, trying to walk fast, I noticed that he was looking at me intently. Then he beckoned me over, picked me up, and hugged me. I was terrified that he would notice the star inside my sweater. He was speaking to me with great emotion, in German. When he put me down, he opened his wallet, showed me a picture of a boy, and gave me some money. I went home more certain than ever <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> right: people were endlessly complicated and interesting. (Kahneman, 2003, p. 417) ...|$|E

2500|$|His down-to-earth manner was {{attested to}} by a White House butler who {{recalled}} that, {{on a visit}} in 1979, Philip had engaged him and a fellow butler in a conversation, and poured them drinks. As well as a reputation for bluntness and plain speaking, Philip is noted for occasionally making observations and jokes that have been construed as either funny, or as gaffes: awkward, [...] politically incorrect or even offensive, but sometimes perceived as stereotypical of someone of his age and background. In {{an address to the}} General Dental Council in 1960, he jokingly coined a new word for his blunders: [...] "Dontopedalogy  is  the science of opening your mouth and putting your foot in it, a science which I have practised for a good many years." [...] Later in life he suggested his comments {{may have contributed to the}} perception that he is [...] "a cantankerous old sod". The historian David Starkey has described him as a kind of [...] "HRH Victor Meldrew". For example, in May 1999 British newspapers accused Philip of insulting deaf children at a pop concert in Wales by saying, [...] "No wonder you are deaf listening to this row." [...] Later Philip wrote, [...] "The story is largely invention. It so happens <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> quite seriously deaf and I have been Patron of the Royal National Institute for the Deaf for ages, so it's hardly likely that I would do any such thing." [...] When he and the Queen met Stephen Menary, an army cadet blinded by an IRA bomb, and the Queen enquired how much sight he retained, Philip quipped: [...] "Not a lot, judging by the tie he's wearing". Menary later said: [...] "I think he just tries to put people at ease by trying to make a joke. I certainly didn't take any offence." [...] During a state visit to the People's Republic of China in 1986, in a private conversation with British students from Xi'an's North West University, Philip joked, [...] "If you stay here much longer, you'll go slit-eyed." [...] The British press reported on the remark as indicative of racial intolerance, but the Chinese authorities were reportedly unconcerned. Chinese students studying in the UK, an official explained, were often told in jest not to stay away too long, lest they go [...] "round-eyed". His comment had no effect on Sino-British relations, but it shaped his own reputation.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} hear the {{pleasant}} news my sister has just brought me," [...] said Hardyman, when Isabel joined him in the parlor. [...] "Mrs. Drumblade has been told, on the best authority, <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>is</b> not coming to the party." ...|$|R
60|$|HITHERTO I {{have said}} little about my mother, and I may {{even seem to}} have {{regarded}} that lady {{in the light of}} a temporary convenience. My readers will, however, already have guessed <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> no common character.|$|E
60|$|I now {{began to}} dimly {{perceive}} <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> not well. Although large and seemingly strong, her increasing weight made her long days of housework a torture. She grew very tired and her sweet face was often knotted with physical pain.|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> {{the only}} honest woman that ever entered the family!" [...] cried the Baroness, {{stamping}} her foot.

6000|$|... "Less {{than you}} suppose, sir; {{but you will}} {{remember}} <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>is</b> esteemed as a terrible power by all concerned with her.

6000|$|... "But you--you especially, I mean," [...] {{she went}} on. [...] "Do {{not be afraid}} of me, Mr. Greatson.

I think that she must be very much happier as she is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The one {{who calls}} will only think that another visitor is leaving, Joey. But I shall have no visitors, or very few.

6000|$|... "I cried," [...] he explained, [...] "because I {{suddenly}} knew <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> nearing her end. There was no weight, no hurt, in her blows. I cried because I knew SHE NO LONGER HAD STRENGTH ENOUGH TO HURT ME. That is why I cried, my Flower of Serenity, my Perfect Rest. That is {{the only}} reason why I cried." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you not {{remember}} <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> ill when {{you spent a}} night in our hut, and my little sister was dying? You nursed her, and tried your best to save her, and when you could not save her, and she died, you wept as if the child had been your own. I do not forget that, Van der Kemp. Sympathy is of more value than service." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had been}} {{thinking}} two minutes before of the cold fruit pie that glorified our Sunday dinner-table, and how I might perhaps get into the tree {{at the end of}} the garden to read in the afternoon. Now an immense fact had come down like a curtain and blotted out all my childish world. My father was lying dead before my eyes.... I perceived <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> helpless and that things must be done.|$|E
60|$|And {{after all}} we're not {{in such a}} bad {{position}} as all <b>that.</b> <b>My</b> <b>mother's</b> father <b>was</b> a gentleman.|$|R

60|$|Now, all {{the time}} I had been on my visit, I had been ungrateful to my home again, and had thought little or nothing about it. But I was no sooner turned towards it, than my reproachful young {{conscience}} seemed to point that way with a ready finger; and I felt, {{all the more for}} the sinking of my spirits, that it was my nest, and <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> my comforter and friend.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pshaw!" [...] She {{flashed a}} look of scorn upon him. [...] "You don't understand! How should you, you are of their kidney--you're only half a man. Thank God <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> of the people! I'd have died to have gone smirking through life with a brick for a heart and milk and water in my veins!

6000|$|... "I {{never thought}} of it in that way, Harry, any more than you did, but I know now <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> right, and that I loved you all along without knowing it.

5000|$|On 28 January 2011, Nikolić {{obtained}} Hungarian citizenship. András Cser-Palkovics, {{mayor of}} Székesfehérvár said that [...] "We {{know about him}} that he knows the country, speaks the language since he has big plans with Videoton this year". Nikolić said that [...] "I knew {{that it is not}} easy to obtain Hungarian citizenship but I hoped that due to the fact <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>is</b> Hungarian it would be easier but it turned out to be a bit more difficult".|$|R
5000|$|In March 2009, Kim Hyon Hui met Yaeko Taguchi's son Koichiro Izuka in Busan, South Korea. Kim told Izuka she {{believes}} Taguchi is still alive. Izuka said, [...] "I received evidence <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>is</b> certainly alive. I have new hope for our rescue efforts.". In October 2011, South Korean intelligence agencies reported they believed dozens of South Korean and Japanese abduction victims {{were moved to}} Wonhwa-ri in South Pyongan Province; this group may have included Taguchi and her second husband Tadaaki Hara.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is simply}} skill against brute force, Osip. I may tell you, what I have not told anyone before since I came here, <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> English. I {{did not say}} so, because, as you may guess, I feared that were it known and {{reported}} it might be traced who I was, and then, instead of being merely classed as a vagabond, I should {{be sent back to}} the prison I escaped from, and be put among another class of prisoners." ...|$|E
60|$|My {{father had}} once been a {{favourite}} of hers, I believe; but she was mortally affronted by his marriage, on the ground <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> 'a wax doll'. She had never seen my mother, but she knew her to be not yet twenty. My father and Miss Betsey never met again. He was double my mother's age when he married, and of but a delicate constitution. He died a year afterwards, and, as I have said, six months before I came into the world.|$|E
60|$|I told him, shortly, that I was a Scot of Fife; whereto he {{answered}} that my speech was strangely English. On this matter I satisfied {{him with the}} truth, namely, <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>was</b> of England. I gave my name but not that of our lands, and showed him how I had been wandering north, to take service with the Dauphin, when I was set upon, and robbed and bound by thieves, for I had no clearness as to telling him all my tale, and no desire to claim acquaintance with Brother Thomas.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, doctor, {{not as far}} as I know. I've always 'eard <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> uncle <b>was</b> very eccentric, {{but that}} wouldn't account for this, because we wasn't related before we married.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{met some}} {{one in the}} village who lives in my country, {{and he told me}} <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> <b>is</b> very, very ill, and if I do not go to her at once she will be dead before I arrive. I will return as soon as I can, and now farewell.' And she set forth in the {{direction}} of the mountains. But this story was not true; she knew nothing about her mother, only she wanted an excuse to go home and tell her family that their prophecies had come true, and that the buffalo was dead.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps it <b>is</b> not {{surprising}} <b>that</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> should <b>be</b> vexed, seeing the false {{position in which}} both she and I have been placed; partly by my fault, for I should not have accepted the living under such conditions." ...|$|R
