60|$|<b>They</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> {{one another}} again. They took things {{for granted in}} the most amazing way.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him, {{these two}} white-faced brothers, like tiger-cats about to spring. Mr. von Tassen was getting impatient.|$|E
60|$|For {{the space}} of perhaps two seconds <b>they</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> each other, eye to eye. Then she {{vanished}} into the room.|$|E

5000|$|Williams is one {{of several}} female Jewish comedians (along with Belle Barth, Patsy Abbott, Rusty Warren and Totie Fields) who traced their [...] "bawdy" [...] {{performance}} style back to Sophie Tucker. The back cover of A Trip around The World is Not a Cruise repeats the anecdote that when they met, Tucker told Williams that [...] "You're me at your age, only better."

50|$|Mellencamp's {{paintings}} from the 1990s—of {{family and friends}} and many of himself—show lone figures isolated frontally against simple, shadowy backgrounds. <b>They</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> the viewer or off into space with eyes both tough and vulnerable, projecting intensity akin to Beckmann's self-portraits with his sad, glowering eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think it}} is you <b>they</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> and envy," [...] said Margaret, glancing at the splendid woman at her side, whose beauty she knew well over-shadowed her own rarer loveliness, at any rate in a street pageant, as in the {{sunshine}} the rose overshadows the lily.|$|R
60|$|<b>They</b> all <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him. Granet's {{face was}} expressionless, {{the girls were}} bewildered, Ralph was frowning.|$|R

50|$|On the bridge, Minoru {{tries to}} catch Chieko when she stumbles, but she recoils from his touch as she shouts {{at him to}} get away from her. <b>They</b> <b>stare</b> <b>at</b> each other for a few tense seconds.

60|$|By {{this time}} Slugger and Nappy had come up, and <b>they</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> Jack and his cousins {{as if they}} could not believe the evidences of their senses.|$|E
6000|$|Three came in. <b>They</b> <b>stared</b> <b>at</b> him. They uttered brief {{expressions}} of pity in slang. They said to Mr. Speedwell, [...] "We {{wanted to see}} him. What is it--eh?" ...|$|E
