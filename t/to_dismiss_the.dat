5|$|The debate {{took all}} day, and the votes were counted very late that night.

The ideas explained were divided into a small number of proposals, designated with the names of their main supporters, and the people then voted for one of those proposals.

5|$|A {{request by}} the state <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> <b>the</b> suit was denied in August 1966, and the case was {{eventually}} heard {{by the state}} Court of Appeals, the highest court in the state. In the meantime, the state built the easternmost mile (1.6km) of the new alignment, which was not affected by the lawsuit. On July7, 1967, the court ruled 6–1 {{in favor of the}} Sleepy Hollow Valley Committee. As a result, the western half of the new road was moved an additional mile to the north, bypassing North Tarrytown completely. The new alignment of NY117 was completed in November1970 and its former alignment along Bedford Road was redesignated as NY448.|$|E

5|$|After {{a series}} of Russian retreats at the {{beginning}} of the campaign, the nobility grew alarmed about the advancing French troops and forced the Czar <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> <b>the</b> army's commander, Barclay de Tolly. Mikhail Kutuzov was appointed as his replacement. In a final attempt to save Moscow, the Russians made a stand near the village of Borodino, west of the town of Mozhaysk. They fortified their positions and waited for the French to attack. The Russian right wing occupied ideal defensive terrain, so the French tried to press the Russian left for much of the battle.|$|E

On July 18, 1984, Jernigan's son Randy found him dead in the room. An autopsy showed that Jernigan suffered from coronary atherosclerosis, and heart disease was officially listed as the cause of death. Lexington police determined that there was no evidence to suggest foul play. Jernigan's ex-wife continued to pursue Jernigan's case against Wilkinson, but a Fayette County Circuit Court Judge awarded Wilkinson a summary judgment <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> <b>the</b> case in 1986.|$|E

5|$|Following the mistrial in Boston, the {{prosecution}} moved {{to schedule a}} new trial. LaRouche and the other defendants appealed that effort on October 5, 1988, saying that a new trial would create double jeopardy. The appeal was denied four months later. The contempt of court fines were appealed again on January 9, 1989, and affirmed again on March 29. Following the convictions in the Alexandria court, prosecutors moved <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> <b>the</b> charges from the Boston court, canceling the retrial.

Warner Bros. also claimed that the 1994 deal did not cover distribution rights and had conferred upon Gordon all the rights he needed to take the film to Warner Bros.

5|$|In April 2010, {{after months}} of {{political}} pressure, the government passed the 18th Amendment, which reduced the President to a ceremonial figurehead by stripping {{the office of the}} power to dissolve Parliament, <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> <b>the</b> Prime Minister, and to appoint military chiefs. The amendment also lifted the restriction of two terms as Prime Minister, which enabled Zardari's foremost political rival, Nawaz Sharif, to seek a third term. The amendment was passed with virtually unanimous support in Parliament and Zardari himself espoused the legislation because of political pressure. After the 18th Amendment, Zardari's main power derived from his position as leader of the PPP, which controls the largest bloc in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Dartmouth College case (supra), there are other reports of certificates of division that were issued but never decided by the Supreme Court. After the indictment of Jefferson Davis, the President of the Confederacy, for treason, William Wirt Henry reports that a certificate of division was issued on Davis's motion <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> <b>the</b> indictment {{on the grounds that}} he owed no allegiance to the United States after the secession of his state. Reportedly, Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase sided with Davis, while District Judge John Curtiss Underwood sided with the government. No response from the Supreme Court to that certificate is reported, but Davis's bail was eventually absolved, and he was released.|$|E

Immediately after the Headingley Test, McCool made 31batting at No. 8as Australia amassed 456 against Derbyshire. After taking 0/45 in the first innings, McCool bounced back as Australia enforced the follow on. A 100-run second wicket partnership by Arnold Townsend and Denis Smith took Derbyshire to 1/110. McCool removed Townsend for 46 and quickly dismissed the next two batsmen to leave Derbyshire at 4/116. He returned with the score at 5/163 and took three further wickets in close succession <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> <b>the</b> hosts for 182, sealing victory by an innings.

According to Walters, the matter was unrelated to the assault on Barker, and {{it had not been}} referred to during the Barker proceedings. The defense filed a motion <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> <b>the</b> Barker charges on the ground that retrying Bell would amount to double jeopardy. On November 8, 2007, Mauffray denied the motion.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} appealed and {{heard by the}} Second Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan on June 18, 2007.

Therefore, they were not considered a chemical weapon and thus not a violation of international law. A further review of the case by the whole panel of judges of the Court of Appeals also confirmed this decision.

5|$|He enjoyed more {{opportunities}} in the ODI arena in 2005, when Kumble was dropped by newly appointed coach Greg Chappell due to his lack of athleticism, {{as well as the}} introduction of the experimental rules which allowed the use of one substitute, thus opening an extra position in the team. Kartik had a modest start under the new regime, taking 1/52 from nine overs in a win over a depleted host Zimbabwe team. He returned to India and started the new season in fine all-round form. After taking 2/34 in the first innings, he scored his highest first-class score of 96 to guide Railways to 311, giving them a first-innings lead of 88 runs over the Rest of India in the Irani Trophy. He then took 3/28 <b>to</b> <b>dismiss</b> <b>the</b> Rest of India for 137 in their second innings, setting up a nine-wciket win. He then took seven wickets at 16.85 at an economy rate of 4.56 in three matches for India Seniors in the Challenger Trophy, including a match-winning 5/29 in the final against India B.|$|E
5|$|In United States v.

Phillips has been cited as an early example of judicial recognition of the norm of prosecutorial enforcement discretion and as an example of mootness (although the Phillips Court did not use that term). The underlying case had involved the prosecution of Zalegman Phillips, a prominent Philadelphia attorney, for interfering with diplomatic immunity, as protected by the Crimes Act of 1790, by filing a lawsuit against a former diplomat. The question certified was whether the provision extended to former diplomats.|$|E
