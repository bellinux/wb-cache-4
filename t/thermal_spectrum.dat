25|$|Less fissile fuel needed. Because LFTRs are <b>thermal</b> <b>spectrum</b> reactors, {{they need}} much less fissile fuel to get started. Only 1-2 tons of fissile are {{required}} to start up a single fluid LFTR, and potentially as low as 0.4 ton for a two fluid design. In comparison, solid fueled fast breeder reactors need at least 8 tons of fissile fuel to start the reactor. While fast reactors can theoretically start up very well on the transuranic waste, their high fissile fuel startup makes this very expensive.|$|E
25|$|Another notable {{feature of}} the MSR is the {{possibility}} of a <b>thermal</b> <b>spectrum</b> nuclear waste-burner. Conventionally only fast spectrum reactors have been considered viable for utilization or reduction of the spent nuclear stockpiles. The conceptual viability of a thermal waste-burner was first shown in a whitepaper by Seaborg Technologies spring 2015. Thermal waste-burning was achieved by replacing a fraction of the uranium in the spent nuclear fuel with thorium. The net production rate of transuranium element (e.g. plutonium and americium) is reduced below the consumption rate, thus reducing the magnitude of the nuclear storage problem. Without the nuclear proliferation concerns and other technical issues associated with a fast reactor.|$|E

They {{should not be}} confused with designs that use a [...] molten salt for cooling only (fluoride high-temperature reactors, FHRs) and still have a solid fuel. Molten salt reactors, as a class, include both burners and breeders in fast or thermal spectra, using fluoride or chloride salt-based fuels and a range of fissile or fertile consumables. LFTRs are defined by the use of fluoride fuel salts and the breeding of thorium into uranium-233 in the <b>thermal</b> <b>spectrum.</b>|$|E

It is shown that quantum effects appear in <b>thermal</b> <b>spectra</b> when the photon energy {{is greater than}} the electron temperature, and in power-law spectra when the electron energy in units of the electron rest mass times the magnetic field strength in units of the critical field strength is of order unity. These spectra are compared with spectra calculated from the ultrarelativistic approximation for synchrotron emission. It is found that the approximation for the power-law spectra is good, and the approximation for <b>thermal</b> <b>spectra</b> produces the shape of the spectrum accurately but fails to give the correct normalization. Single photon pair creation masks the quantum effects for power-law distributions, so only modifications to <b>thermal</b> <b>spectra</b> are important for gamma-ray bursts...|$|R

2500|$|Limited {{plutonium}} solubility - Fluorides of plutonium, americium and curium {{occur as}} trifluorides, {{which means they}} have three fluorine atoms attached ( [...] , , [...] ). Such trifluorides have a limited solubility in the FLiBe carrier salt. This complicates startup, especially for a compact design that uses a smaller primary salt inventory. Of course, leaving plutonium carrying wastes out of the startup process is an even better solution, making this a non issue. Solubility can be increased by operating with less or no beryllium fluoride (which has no solubility for trifluorides) or by operating at a higher temperature(as with most other liquids, solubility rises with temperature). A <b>thermal</b> <b>spectrum,</b> lower power density core does not have issues with plutonium solubility.|$|E
2500|$|Kirk Sorensen, former NASA {{scientist}} and Chief Nuclear Technologist at Teledyne Brown Engineering, {{has been a}} long-time promoter of thorium fuel cycle and particularly liquid fluoride thorium reactors. He first researched thorium reactors while working at NASA, while evaluating power plant designs suitable for lunar colonies. Material about this fuel cycle was surprisingly hard to find, so in 2006 Sorensen started [...] "energyfromthorium.com", a document repository, forum, and blog to promote this technology. In 2006, Sorensen coined the liquid fluoride thorium reactor and LFTR nomenclature to describe a subset of molten salt reactor designs based on liquid fluoride-salt fuels with breeding of thorium into uranium-233 in the <b>thermal</b> <b>spectrum.</b> In 2011, Sorensen founded Flibe Energy, a company that initially intends to develop 20-50 MW LFTR small modular reactor designs to power military bases. (It is easier to promote novel military designs than civilian power station designs in today's US nuclear regulatory environment). An independent technology assessment coordinated with EPRI and Southern Company represents the most detailed information so far publicly available about Flibe Energy's proposed LFTR design.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} effect caused by {{external}} magnetic fields on the observed <b>thermal</b> <b>spectra</b> and iron line profiles of thin accretion discs formed around Kerr black holes and naked singularities. We aim {{to provide a}} tool {{that can be used}} to estimate the presence of magnetic fields in the neighbourhood of a compact object and to probe the cosmic censorship conjecture in these particular astrophysical environments. We developed a numerical scheme able to calculate <b>thermal</b> <b>spectra</b> of magnetised Page-Thorne accretion discs formed around rotating black holes and naked singularities as seen by an arbitrary distant observer. We incorporated two different magnetic field configurations: uniform and dipolar, using a perturbative scheme in the coupling constant between matter and magnetic field strength. Under the same assumptions, we obtained observed synthetic line profiles of the 6. 4 keV fluorescent iron line. We show that an external magnetic field produces potentially observable modifications on the <b>thermal</b> energy <b>spectrum</b> and the fluorescent iron line profile. <b>Thermal</b> energy <b>spectra</b> of naked singularities are harder and brighter than those from black holes, and in addition, peak and cut-off energies are affected by the external magnetic field. Moreover, iron line profiles of slowly rotating black holes suffer more changes by a uniform magnetic field, while nearly extremal black holes and naked singularities are more altered in the dipolar case. Based on our calculations, we discard the possibility of modelling the archetypal black-hole candidate in Cygnus X- 1 as a naked singularity. Comparison of our models with observational data can be used to probe the cosmic censorship conjecture and to estimate the existence and global geometry of magnetic fields around compact objects by fitting the <b>thermal</b> energy <b>spectra</b> and iron line profiles of X-ray binaries.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the features of}} the non-corrected <b>thermal</b> (non-thermal) <b>spectrum</b> and the quantum corrected <b>thermal</b> (non-thermal) <b>spectrum.</b> We find that: (i) using the quantum corrected non-thermal spectra, the black hole radiation as tunneling is an entropy conservation process, and thus black hole evaporation process is unitary; (ii) there are no obvious differences between all spectra except for near the Planck mass scale by comparing their average emission energies, average numbers of emissions and average emission energy fluctuations; (iii) the energy covariances of Hawking radiations for all the <b>thermal</b> <b>spectra</b> are exactly zero, while they are nontrivial for all the non-thermal spectra. Especially, there are distinctly different maximums of energy covariances for the temperature-corrected and energy-corrected non-thermal spectra. Consequently, these differences provide a possible way towards experimentally analyzing whether the radiation spectrum of black hole is thermal or non-thermal with or without high order quantum corrections.
