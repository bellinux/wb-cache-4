40|$|A {{follow-up}} {{study was conducted}} to ascertain if the rate of reading gain made during part-time placement in a resource room would be maintained following a year of full-time attendance in <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> classes. <b>The</b> Wide Range Achievement Test (WRA T) was administered to 62 learning disabled children. Statistical analyses were computed for children grouped by duration of interven-tion and chronological age and were compared among the three testing phases: pretest, posttest, and follow-up. It was found that the resource room intervention is effective for increasing reading rates of learning disabled children but that the increased rates {{do not appear to be}} maintained in <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> <b>classrooms.</b> <b>The</b> group with the shortest stay in the resource room made significantly greater rate gains during treatment and continued during follow-up to learn at a higher rate. Conversely there were no significant differences between the chronological age groups. However, the difference between the testing phases was statistically significant. The author suggested alternative strategies to sustain the increased rates of reading achievement for children returning full time to <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> <b>classrooms.</b> T he disappointing findings from the efficacy studiesof self-contained classes (Goldstein, Moss, & Jordan 1965) and the decisions handed down by the courts (Weintraub 1972) have prompted the expansion of the resource room model as an alternative instructional strategy for the education of children with learning disabilities. The children who do not require a basic modification of <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> curriculum but who require additional, intensive, supportive help outside <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> <b>classrooms</b> go to <b>the</b> resource room during a specified period of time on a regularly scheduled basis. Efficacy studies (Pepe 1974, Sabatino 1971) have subsequently demonstrated the effectiveness of the resource room for increasing academic achievement and appro-priate behaviors.

2500|$|Educational {{psychology}} {{has seen}} rapid {{growth and development}} as a profession in the last twenty years. School psychology began {{with the concept of}} intelligence testing leading to provisions for special education students, who could not follow <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> <b>classroom</b> curriculum {{in the early part of}} the 20th century. However, [...] "school psychology" [...] itself has built a fairly new profession based upon the practices and theories of several psychologists among many different fields. Educational psychologists are working side by side with psychiatrists, social workers, teachers, speech and language therapists, and counselors in attempt to understand the questions being raised when combining behavioral, cognitive, and social psychology in the classroom setting.|$|E
2500|$|Acceleration {{presents}} {{gifted children}} academic material from established curricula that is commensurate with their ability and preparedness, {{and for this}} reason is a low-cost option {{from the perspective of the}} school. This may result in a small number of children taking classes targeted at older children. [...] However, for the majority of gifted students, acceleration is beneficial both academically and socially. [...] "Radical acceleration (acceleration by two or more years) is effective academically and socially for highly gifted students." [...] Some advocates have argued that the disadvantages of being retained in a standard mixed-ability classroom are substantially worse than any shortcomings of acceleration. For example, psychologist Miraca Gross reports: [...] "the majority of these children [...] are socially rejected , isolated, and deeply unhappy. Children of IQ 180+ who are retained in <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> <b>classroom</b> are even more seriously at risk and experience severe emotional distress." [...] These accelerated children should be placed together in one class if possible. Research suggests that acceleration might have an impact long after students graduate from high school. For example, one study shows that high-IQ individuals who experienced full-grade acceleration earned higher incomes as adults.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the primary}} school level, {{students}} spend all class {{time with their}} peers, but receive extra material to challenge them. Enrichment may {{be as simple as}} a modified assignment provided by <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> <b>classroom</b> teacher, or it might include formal programs such as Odyssey of the Mind, Destination Imagination or academic competitions such as Brain Bowl, Future Problem Solving, Science Olympiad, National History Day, science fairs, or spelling bees. Programmes of enrichment activities may also be organised outside the school day (e.g. the ASCEND project in secondary science education [...] ). This work is done in addition to, and not instead of, any regular school work assigned. Critics of this approach argue that it requires gifted students to do more work instead of the same amount at an advanced level. On the secondary school level sometimes an option is to take more courses like English, Spanish, Latin, Philosophy, Science, etc., or to engage in extra curricular activities. [...] Some perceive there to be a necessary choice between enrichment and acceleration, as if the two were mutually exclusive alternatives. [...] However, other researchers see the two as complements to each other.|$|E
40|$|The SALAMANCA Statement (UNESCO, 1994), and the Namibian {{constitution}} (1990) {{commit the}} government to offering education to children with disabilities. The primary focus {{of this study was}} to examine the attitudes of the population of primary school principals' with regard to the inclusive education practice of placing and educating students with disabilities in <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> <b>classrooms.</b> In addition, <b>the</b> researcher sought to ascertain principals' perceived barriers and needs with regard to facilitating and implementing inclusive education practices. The survey instruments used to collect data consisted of: a) demographic section, b) Attitude Toward Inclusive Education Scale, c) Opinions Relative to the Integration of Students with Disabilities scale, and d) openended questions. The results suggest that Namibian primary school principals hold positive attitudes toward students with disabilities in general, though they have preferences of the type of disabilities to be accommodated in <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> <b>classrooms.</b> Students with social difficulties were more favored for inclusion than students with sensory and physical disabilities. Principals favored inclusion of students with behavioral challenges slightly more than students with academic difficulties. Principals' perceptions were that inclusive education has potential benefits for students with and without disabilities and that it presents opportunity for academic growth for students with disabilities. Yet, special school or classroom placement was perceived as the most stable environment for educating students with disabilities, especially when considering their social and emotional development. Furthermore, principals were of the opinion that due to pre-service training, which did not include courses on special education and disabilities, educators lack the needed knowledge, skills, and abilities to educate thesestudents, hence the need for comprehensive in-service. In addition to lack of training in special education as a major barrier, other reported barriers were lack of proper educational facilities and equipment, lack of parent involvement and students' characteristics. The multivariate analysis revealed that younger school principals held more favorable attitudes toward placement of students with disabilities in <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> <b>classrooms.</b> Principals with graduate degrees and BA/BS perceived themselves as not having the ability to educate these students in comparison to those with lesser qualifications. The demographic variables of years of experience as a principal and teaching location had no significant effect on the attitudes of principals with regard to placement or educating students with disabilities in <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> <b>classrooms.</b> Department of Special EducationThesis (D.

40|$|All {{areas of}} {{education}} face changes and challenges constantly. Early childhood education is no exception. A recent challenge teachers face {{in early childhood}} education is the advent of inclusion. Implementing inclusion in early childhood classrooms creates more diversity among the children. Inclusion of students with various disabilities has caused concern among parents and teachers. There are some concerns that need special attention when including {{students with disabilities in}} the early childhood classrooms. Reforming public education to accommodate the needs of special education children placed in <b>regular</b> <b>classrooms</b> is a vital issue. For several years there have been arguments concerning the placement of children with disabilities in <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> <b>classrooms.</b> When inclusion children are placed in <b>the</b> <b>regular</b> <b>classrooms</b> <b>the</b> teachers are required to provide individualized instruction for the inclusion children. This may take away the time the teacher have to spend with the other children. The inclusion of children in <b>regular</b> <b>classrooms</b> have been both positive and negative effects. This means, with respect to all stages of the education system, including early childhood, that all children, regardless of their disability, can attend their local educational setting, and have their learning and development needs met through the provision of high-quality care and education For inclusive early childhood education to be successful, early childhood teachers as well as parents and members of the wider community need to embrace and practice inclusion. Parents of children without disabilities may bring with them attitudes and understandings that can lead to social exclusions, restrictions and disadvantages for all children with disabilities and their family in their early childhood setting and neighbourhood community. In this paper, we tried to highlight the attitudes and understandings of some parents of non-disabled children towards the inclusion and teaching of children with disabilities in regular early childhood settings and the consequences that resulted from the exclusionary and inclusionary constructions that these parents took up to define and understand disability and inclusion. We then offer some ideas and strategies for dialogue that may help early childhood teachers appropriately respond to this issue at own capacity...|$|R
