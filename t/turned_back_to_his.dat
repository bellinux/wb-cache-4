500|$|Ceawlin's last {{recorded}} {{victory is}} in 584. [...] The entry reads [...] "Here Ceawlin and Cutha {{fought against the}} Britons at the place which is named Fethan leag, and Cutha was killed; and Ceawlin took many towns and countless war-loot, and in anger he <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> own [...]" [...] There is a wood named [...] "Fethelée" [...] mentioned in a twelfth-century document that relates to Stoke Lyne, in Oxfordshire, and it now is thought that the battle of Fethan leag must have been fought in this area.|$|E
500|$|The phrase [...] "in anger he <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> own" [...] {{probably}} {{indicates that}} this annal {{is drawn from}} saga material, as perhaps are all of the early Wessex annals. [...] It also {{has been used to}} argue that perhaps, Ceawlin did not win the battle and that the chronicler chose not to record the outcome fully – a king does not usually come home [...] "in anger" [...] after taking [...] "many towns and countless war-loot". [...] It may be that Ceawlin's overlordship of the southern Britons came to an end with this battle.|$|E
500|$|Mercator never {{committed}} any of {{his prison}} experiences to paper; all he would say {{was that he had}} suffered an [...] "unjust persecution". For the rest of his time in Leuven his religious thoughts were kept to himself and he <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> work. His brush with the Inquisition did not affect his relationship with the court and Nicholas Perrenot recommended him to the emperor as a maker of superb instruments. The outcome was an Imperial order for globes, compasses, astrolabe and astronomical rings. They were ready in 1545 and the Emperor granted the royal seal of approval to his workshop. Sadly they were soon destroyed {{in the course of the}} Emperor's military ventures and Mercator had to construct a second set, now lost. He also returned to his work on a large up-to-date and highly detailed wall map of Europe which was, he had already claimed on his 1538 world map, very well advanced. It proved to be a vast task and he, perfectionist that he was, seemed unable to cut short his ever-expanding researches and publish: as a result it was to be another ten years before the map appeared.|$|E
