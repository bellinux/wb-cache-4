5|$|After {{emerging}} from a manhole in the showers of the guard living quarters, Riddick uses a guard uniform to blend in {{as he makes his}} way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> port and his chance at escape. Realizing he requires a guard to get through the retinal scanner that locks the doors <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> port, Riddick decides to go after Abbott and take his eyes. He gains access to Abbott's apartment by telling him there is a delivery for him. A fire fight ensues and after that, as Abbott bleeds out on the floor, Riddick moves in for the kill but is stopped by Johns.|$|E

5|$|The day's {{schedule}} {{also included}} the installation and {{alignment of the}} centerline camera in {{the centre of the}} Orbiter Docking System. The camera later assisted Commander Ken Cameron in final piloting tasks as Atlantis moved towards and docked with Mir. At 5:00am CST (11:00UTC) on day 2, Atlantis was about 4,000statute miles behind Mir, and was closing in <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> station {{at a rate of about}} 380statute miles per orbit.|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is <b>to</b> {{introduce}} <b>the</b> <b>spaces</b> csλ, cs 0 λ, and bsλ which are BK-spaces of nonabsolute type. We prove that these spaces are linearly isomorphic <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spaces</b> cs, cs 0, and bs, respectively, and derive some inclusion relations. Additionally, Schauder bases of <b>the</b> <b>spaces</b> csλ and cs 0 λ have been constructed and the α-, β-, and γ-duals of these spaces have been computed. Besides, we characterize some matrix classes from <b>the</b> <b>spaces</b> csλ, cs 0 λ, and bsλ <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>spaces</b> lp, c, and c 0, where 1 ≤p≤∞. Finally, we examine some geometric properties of these spaces as Gurarǐ’s modulus of convexity, property m∞, property (M), property WORTH, nonstrict Opial property, and weak fixed point property...|$|R
5|$|After each flight {{the engines}} would {{be removed from}} the orbiter and {{transferred}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> Shuttle Main Engine Processing Facility (SSMEPF), where they would be inspected and refurbished in preparation for reuse on a subsequent flight. A total of 46 reusable RS-25 engines, each costing around US$40 million, were flown during the Space Shuttle program, with each new or overhauled engine entering the flight inventory requiring flight qualification on one of the test stands at Stennis Space Center prior to flight.|$|E
5|$|Daniela Schwarz {{and colleagues}} (2007) {{concluded}} that the bifurcated neural spines of diplodocids and dicraeosaurids enclosed an air sac, {{which would have been}} connected to the lungs as part of the respiratory system. In Dicraeosaurus, this air sac (the so-called supravertebral diverticulum) would have rested on top of the neural arch and filled the entire space between the spines. In Amargasaurus the upper two-thirds of the spines would have been covered by a sheath of keratin, restricting the air sac <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> between the lower one-third of the spines.|$|E

5|$|Khan lures Enterprise <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> station Regula I, and he {{launches}} a surprise attack that disables Kirk's ship. Kirk tricks Khan {{by using a}} special code to remotely lower Reliants shields, allowing Enterprise to inflict significant damage. Khan is forced to withdraw to make repairs. Using the mind-controlled Terrell and Chekov as spies, Khan captures the Genesis device and leaves Kirk marooned on Regula I. Spock deceives Khan into thinking that Enterprise is crippled, surprising Khan when Enterprise rescues Kirk and escapes to the nearby Mutara Nebula. Goaded into following Kirk, Khan pilots Reliant into the nebula, where shields and sensors are inoperable. Due to Khan's inexperience with three-dimensional space combat, Enterprise defeats Reliant and Khan is severely wounded. Refusing to accept defeat, Khan activates the Genesis device, intent on killing his foe along with himself. Khan quotes Ahab's words of vengeance from Moby Dick as he watches Enterprise try to escape.|$|E
5|$|Launched {{from the}} EUROSEC Space Centre in Portugal in the {{spacecraft}} Phoenix, Ross and Kane spend {{the first half}} of their six-week round trip in stasis. Three weeks after launch, the astronauts are revived in the planet's orbit. Scans for the existence of extraterrestrial life are inconclusive, and Ross and Kane decide to make a surface landing. As the astronauts descend, an electrical storm damages their Dove lander shuttle, which crashes in a mountainous region near Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. When an air-sea rescue unit returns Ross and Kane, the latter critically injured, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> Centre, it appears that the Phoenix mission has returned to Earth.|$|E
5|$|Obama is a {{supporter}} of the Chicago White Sox, and he threw out the first pitch at the 2005 ALCS when he was still a senator. In 2009, he threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the All-Star Game while wearing a White Sox jacket. He is also primarily a Chicago Bears football fan in the NFL, but in his childhood and adolescence was a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers, and rooted for them ahead of their victory in Super Bowl XLIII 12 days after he took office as President. In 2011, Obama invited the 1985 Chicago Bears to the White House; the team had not visited the White House after their Super Bowl win in 1986 due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> Shuttle Challenger disaster.|$|E

Cate travels to a small island located in the Caribbean, where she infiltrates a secret launch facility. Cate discovers that a rocket will be sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> station that afternoon to collect some antidote. Disguised as a H.A.R.M. space agent, Cate boards the rocket and travels to H.A.R.M.'s space station. While she is searching for the antidote, the space station is struck by a meteor shower, causing it to implode. Cate obtains a large antidote sample and uses an escape pod to return to Earth safely.|$|E
5|$|The Isinglass/Rheinberry {{concept was}} {{considered}} to be superior to spy satellites in a number of ways, including rapid turnaround time and quick response capability. As there was little funding to be had from the CIA budget, McDonnell developed the aircraft using its own funds, although technical support gleaned from Oxcart was supplied by the CIA. The McDonnell Isenglass/Rheinberry proposal's shape remains classified, although it has been described as being similar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> Shuttle, albeit much reduced in size. A 1/3 cross-sectional model of the aircraft was constructed to illustrate the principles used in its construction.|$|E
5|$|The United States Air Force {{intended}} to use the Gemini spacecraft to transport astronauts to its proposed space stations, the Manned Orbital Development System and later the Manned Orbital Laboratory (MOL). These stations would have been launched by Titan IIIM rockets, with a Gemini spacecraft atop, {{eliminating the need for}} rendezvous and docking maneuvers. For this purpose, several modifications were made to the Gemini capsule, including the installation of a hatch in the heat shield to allow access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>space</b> station.|$|E

5|$|The {{first group}} of 35, which {{included}} Shepard, assembled at the Pentagon on February 2, 1959. The Navy and Marine Corps officers were welcomed by the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Arleigh Burke, while the United States Air Force officers were addressed by the Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force, General Thomas D. White. Both pledged their support <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> Program, and promised that the careers of volunteers would not be adversely affected. NASA officials then briefed them on Project Mercury. They conceded {{that it would be}} a hazardous undertaking, but emphasized that it was of great national importance. That evening, Shepard discussed the day's events with fellow naval aviators Jim Lovell, Pete Conrad and Wally Schirra, all of whom would eventually become astronauts. They were concerned about their careers, but decided to volunteer.|$|E

It was also noticed that Larson had an unusual reaction to his early prize of a Kauai trip, which was out of his pattern – he initially looked puzzled and upset, but then recovered and celebrated after a pause.|$|E
5|$|Samus {{encounters}} heavy {{resistance from}} the Space Pirates, Phazon-corrupted monstrosities, and her fellow bounty hunters who have been corrupted by Dark Samus. Throughout her mission, which eventually takes her <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Space</b> Pirate homeworld, Samus slowly becomes further Phazon-corrupted. She manages to stop the Space Pirate assault {{with the assistance of}} the Galactic Federation navy. As they gain control of a Leviathan battleship, Samus and the Federation fleet create a wormhole and warp to Phaaze—the source of all Phazon in the galaxy. Samus travels to its core, where she finally defeats Dark Samus and then the corrupted Aurora Unit 313. As a result, Dark Samus is obliterated, and Phaaze explodes, rendering all Phazon in the galaxy inert. The Federation fleet escapes Phaaze's destruction, but loses contact with Samus in the process. Eventually, Samus appears in her gunship, and reports that the mission is accomplished. Samus then takes off for Elysia, where she reflects on her deceased fellow bounty hunters. If the player completes the game with all of the items collected, Samus is seen flying into hyperspace, with Sylux's spaceship following her.|$|E
