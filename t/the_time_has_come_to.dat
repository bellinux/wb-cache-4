Hideki asks why, and Freya explains that Chi discovered there were certain things that humans could do that she could not, leading her to believe that while Hideki would love her, it would make her existence unbearable. Hideki protests that it would not, but Freya tells him that Chi thought otherwise. She then tells Chitose that <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> destroy both of them, and she reluctantly agrees. Against Hideki's protestations, she deactivates Freya. Chi, however, has survived the deactivation and comes {{to the conclusion that}} while life with Hideki may seem painful because of her limitations, it is even more painful without him. She regains control of her body and completes her program, giving every persocom the ability to love then embraces Hideki.|$|E

The model will be built in limited numbers and will be offered in both coupe and convertible versions. The Shelby GT350 was released onto the market in 2011 and since then, has been improved upon every year. In 2011, it only came as a coupe painted in white with blue stripes and for the 2012 model year, Shelby also added a convertible version with three more colors. For the 2013 model year, the GT350 will receive new color options, visual styling cues, and optional performance enhancements.

The text went through seven printings in six months; it was a best-seller. In January 1898, the second part was published, covering the rest of the Old Testament as well as all of the New Testament. It included a Preface written by Stanton in which she acknowledged that [...] "Both friend and foe object to the title." [...] Nevertheless, she praised the Revising Committee for showing [...] "a more worshipful reverence for the great Spirit of All Good than does the Church."

500|$|On 19 October 1988, the Home Secretary, Douglas Hurd, {{issued a}} notice under clause 13(4) of the BBC Licence and Agreement to the BBC and under section 29(3) of the Broadcasting Act 1981 to the Independent Broadcasting Authority prohibiting the {{broadcast}} of direct statements by representatives or supporters of eleven Irish {{political and military}} organisations. The ban prevented the UK news media from broadcasting the voices, though not the words, of ten Irish republican and Ulster loyalist paramilitary groups, as well as Sinn Féin. Among the other groups affected were the Provisional IRA, Irish National Liberation Army, Ulster Defence Association and the Ulster Volunteer Force, although the ban was targeted primarily at Sinn Féin. Addressing the House of Commons on the ban, Hurd said, [...] "the terrorists themselves draw support and sustenance from access to radio and television ... <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> deny this easy platform to those who use it to propagate terrorism", while the Conservative Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, said it would [...] "deny terrorists the oxygen of publicity".|$|E
500|$|In July 2007, the English {{version of}} Kashimashi was Seven Seas Entertainment's best-selling title. The {{first volume of}} the manga was given {{positive}} reviews from such sources as Newtype USA, a popular anime and manga magazine. The first volume was named as Newtype USAs Book of the Month for December 2006, and the review noted Seven Seas Entertainment's [...] "fan-focused" [...] translation, which retained the honorifics {{and much of the}} Japanese wordplay without efforts to localize the humor for the mainstream American market. The review goes on to state that [...] "for fans of more mainstream romantic productions, it's a neat twist on the traditional love-triangle formula, and a charming alternative to boys meeting girls." [...] In a review at Anime News Network (ANN), Carlo Santos commented that [...] "the fast-moving events of this first volume combine to form a story of many moods: a gender-bending comedy, but with sci-fi touches, and most of all, a romance more touching than one might expect. <b>The</b> <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> rethink the love triangle." [...] In a review at IGN, A. E. Sparrow stated [...] "there's plenty to enjoy in the first book, however. Hazumu attempting to buy his first bra is pretty humorous, as are the occasional visits from the aliens who put him in this situation in the first place." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the post-World War II period, {{relations}} between the CIO leadership and communists within its member unions deteriorated. The first sign of a break came in May 1946. CIO President Philip Murray sponsored a denouncing Communist Party interference {{in the affairs of}} the CIO. Gold voted to approve the resolution. When asked why, he allegedly replied, [...] "I have no problem being a loyal American, that's all the resolution asks. We just don't agree on the Truman foreign policy. We'll work with anyone on legitimate union business. We can't worry about Jim Carey and Reuther. They have their axes to grind." [...] But when the CIO established a committee in November 1946 to purge the labor federation of communists and communist influence, Gold denounced the effort and said it would [...] "destroy" [...] the CIO. In May 1947, CIO leaders met to discuss the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers, where locals representing thousands of members had recently disaffiliated due to the communist politics of the international union's leadership. CIO President Philip Murray proposed that the CIO run the international union for a time, but Gold and seven other communists voted against Murray's proposal. An outraged Murray declared, [...] "Any man who goes into a shop ostensibly as the representative of the workers and then devotes his time to furthering the interest of the Communist Party is a goddamn traitor.

2500|$|Bolgia 3 – Simoniacs: Dante now forcefully expresses his {{condemnation}} {{of those who}} committed simony, or the sale of ecclesiastic favors and offices, and therefore made money for themselves out of what belongs to God: [...] "Rapacious ones, who take the things of God, / {{that ought to be}} the brides of Righteousness, / and make them fornicate for gold and silver! / <b>The</b> <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> let the trumpet sound / for you; ...". The sinners are placed head-downwards in round, tube-like holes within the rock (debased mockeries of baptismal fonts), with flames burning the soles of their feet. The heat of the fire is proportioned to their guilt. The simile of baptismal fonts gives Dante an incidental opportunity to clear his name of an accusation of malicious damage to the font at the Baptistery of San Giovanni. Simon Magus, who offered gold in exchange for holy power to Saint Peter and after whom the sin is named, is mentioned here (although Dante does not encounter him). One of the sinners, Pope Nicholas III, must serve in the hellish baptism by fire from his death in 1280 until 1303 – the arrival in Hell of Pope Boniface VIII – who will take his predecessor's place in the stone tube until 1314, when he will in turn be replaced by Pope Clement V, a puppet of King Philip IV of France who moved the Papal See to Avignon, ushering in the Avignon Papacy (1309–77). Dante delivers a denunciation of simoniacal corruption of the Church.|$|E

I'm so lucky to have had such challenging storylines, from the affair with Max and being diagnosed with bipolar to the complete shock of being revealed as Archie's killer during the live 25th Anniversary episode. I'll miss Stacey and everyone in Albert Square very much but <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> try something different." [...] Executive producer Bryan Kirkwood added: [...] "We'll be very sad to see Lacey Turner leave the show. Lacey is one of the best young actresses on TV at the moment and the fact that she's won 28 awards in the last five years is testament to this. It's only right that someone as talented and versatile as Lacey should pursue new challenges and we wish her the very best of luck. In the meantime, viewers can look forward to a typically dramatic Slater family exit when she leaves and the door will be left open for Stacey Branning to return to Albert Square in the future." [...] During an interview on This Morning, Kirkwood revealed that Stacey will take centre stage at Christmas and will depart in a [...] "dramatic plotline" [...] and said [...] "Christmas will be all about [...] " [...] and explained the storyline would be [...] "a suitably dramatic and fitting departure for one of the all-time greats".

2500|$|According to some defence analysts, India should {{increase}} its {{military presence in}} Afghanistan not only to protect Indian projects and nationals there, but also to aid the coalition forces to improve the overall security situation in the war-torn country. Gurmeet Kanwal, head of the Center for Land Warfare Studies, said, [...] "I would say <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> live up to our responsibility. If it involves military intervention, so be it." [...] C. Raja Mohan, an Indian foreign policy analyst, urged India's government to increase military presence in Afghanistan and also added [...] "Afghanistan needs to be stabilised. Pakistan needs to be stabilised. This requires more drastic remedies." [...] In April 2008 Afghanistan's Defense Minister formally requested India's help in counter-insurgency operations {{during his visit to}} New Delhi. India has already provided large-scale military equipment to the Afghan National Army and has also given crucial intelligence inputs to the United States-led coalition forces. Several members of the Afghan army have undergone anti-terrorist training in India and in April 2007, the Indian Army also sent a delegation to set up an army training school in Afghanistan and Uzbekistan. In September 2007, India held a joint military exercise with the United Kingdom to train British forces in counter-insurgency operations, particularly those in Afghanistan. India also has an operational air force command at the Farkhor Air Base in neighbouring Tajikistan. Indian Express said in an editorial, [...] "after the Kabul bombing, India must come to terms with an important question that it has avoided debating so far. New Delhi cannot continue to expand its economic and diplomatic activity in Afghanistan, while avoiding a commensurate increase in its military presence there. For too long, New Delhi has deferred to Pakistani and American sensitivities about raising India's strategic profile in Afghanistan." [...] However, some analysts have feared that if India joins the United States-led coalition forces in Afghanistan, it would harm the soft power it has gradually built in the region {{as a result of the}} widespread popularity of Bollywood films and Indian television soaps among Afghans.|$|E
2500|$|But in the mid-18th century, {{during the}} French Enlightenment, a more ideological {{use of the}} term had come into use. In 1765, the author of an {{anonymous}} article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of [...] "The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing". The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots [...] "philanthropic" [...] and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge (some Christian, some not). After the French Revolution, the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions, attributed by opponents of the Revolution to Enlightenment philosophes such as Rousseau, was violently attacked by influential religious and political conservatives, such as Edmund Burke and Joseph de Maistre, as a deification or idolatry of humanity. Humanism began to acquire a negative sense. The Oxford English Dictionary records {{the use of the word}} [...] "humanism" [...] by an English clergyman in 1812 to indicate those who believe in the [...] "mere humanity" [...] (as opposed to the divine nature) of Christ, i.e., Unitarians and Deists. In this polarised atmosphere, in which established ecclesiastical bodies tended to circle the wagons and reflexively oppose political and social reforms like extending the franchise, universal schooling, and the like, liberal reformers and radicals embraced the idea of Humanism as an alternative religion of humanity. The anarchist Proudhon (best known for declaring that [...] "property is theft") used the word [...] "humanism" [...] to describe a [...] "culte, déification de l’humanité" [...] ("worship, [...] deification of humanity") and Ernest Renan in L’avenir de la science: pensées de 1848 ("The Future of Knowledge: Thoughts on 1848") (1848–49), states: [...] "It is my deep conviction that pure humanism will be the religion of the future, that is, the cult of all that pertains to humanityall of life, sanctified and raised to the level of a moral value." ...|$|E
