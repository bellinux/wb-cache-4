40|$|The {{occurrence}} of sleep paralysis {{in the absence}} of narcolepsy is not uncommon in the population. A good number of normal individuals sometimes report the experience of episodes of profound muscular paralysis on waking from sleep in the morning or during the night. These episodes are very disturbing, especially since the individual is generally unable to breathe deeply or voluntarily. Previous studies have suggested an association between isolated sleep paralysis and adverse psychosocial situations though not with any specific condition. A test of the hypothesis that its prevalence may be affected by stressful life situations is presented in this study using <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>patients</b> (suffering from physical injuries) and patients with multiple somatic complaints (suffering from psychological disorders) as examples of individuals undergoing stressful life experiences. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to find out the prevalence of sleep paralysis in samples of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>patients</b> and patients who presented with multiple somatic complaints and determine if these rates were significantly higher than the rate in healthy individuals. This study also aimed at determining if there was evidence of psychopathology among <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>patients,</b> and if so to find out if there was significant difference in the degree of psychopathology between the <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>patients</b> and patients with multiple somatic complaints. Materials and Methods: Samples of healthy individuals, <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>patients</b> and patients with multiple somatic complaints were asked to fill out a survey that determined the three - month prevalence of isolated sleep paralysis. They were also scored on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS). Results: Isolated sleep paralysis was reported by 28 % of the healthy subjects, 44 % of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>patients</b> and 56 % of the patients with multiple somatic complaints. The degree of psychopathology (as shown by scores on the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale) in the <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>patients</b> was significantly higher than that in the healthy subjects and significantly lower than that reported by the patients with multiple somatic complaints. Conclusion: This study has shown that though isolated sleep paralysis occurs in healthy individuals, it is nevertheless associated with psychopathology...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims: Post-dural {{puncture}} headache (PDPH) is a {{complication of}} spinal anaesthesia, influenced mostly by patient’s age, spinal needle size and design and, possibly, female gender. The {{purpose of this}} prospective observational study was to compare the frequency and clinical significance of PDPH in two patient groups {{at high risk for}} the development of PDPH, namely young parturients and <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>patients,</b> using 26 -G and 27 -G Quincke needles. Patients and Methods: The study included 56 parturients undergoing Caesarean section and 59 <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>patients</b> undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery, who received standard spinal anaesthesia using 26 -G or 27 -G Quincke needles. All patients were less than 40 years of age. The patients were visited on postoperative days 1, 2, and 4 or contacted by telephone and evaluated for the presence, characteristics and severity of headache, backache and other possible complications. Only posture dependent headache was regarded as PDPH with severity graded as mild, moderate and severe. Patient satisfaction was assessed by theirwillingness to have spinal anaesthesia in the future. Results: <b>Orthopaedic</b> <b>patients</b> were predominantly male (81. 4 %) and significantly younger than parturients (27. 8 ± 5. 5 vs. 33. 7 ± 4. 7 years, P< 0. 0001). Both groups had similar use of 26 -G and 27 -G needles, one attempt success rate at dural puncture, and high quality of spinal block. The incidence of PDPH in parturients was 14. 3 % and in <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>patients</b> 13. 6 %, which was not significantly different. Also, the severity of PDPH was similar, with mild headache in four out of eight PDPH patients in each group. The rate was similar with 26 -G and 27 -G needles. No patient required an epidural blood patch. Both <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>patients</b> and parturients expressed high satisfaction rate with spinal anaesthesia (96. 6 % and 94. 6 %, respectively). Conclusion: The rate of PDPH was similar in young <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>patients</b> and parturients but higher than in the literature. Low rate of severe headache, no need for epidural blood patch, and high patient satisfaction with spinal anaesthesia, make 26 -G and 27 -G Quincke needles an acceptable technique where pencil point needles are not available...|$|R

40|$|An {{audit cycle}} of {{post-operative}} pain scores and patient satisfaction of pain control in <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>patients</b> at a Level Two State Hospital in Cape Town. In addition {{as part of}} the information collected during the research process we will audit the following: Intraoperative anaesthetic techniques, post-operative analgesia consumption and analgesic methods as well as any side effects to analgesic medication used in <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>patients</b> peri-operatively at Victoria Hospital Wynberg (VHW) will also be noted. Postoperative pain control is an essential, yet often inadequately managed part of peri-operative patient care. Adequate analgesia is important not only for patient comfort but also for maintaining stable physiology, facilitating recovery from surgery, enabling rehabilitation and to potentially decrease length of hospital stay post-operatively. International audits have previously shown that pain is poorly managed post-operatively in surgical patients. At facilities in the Western Cape, pilot student audits have shown that management of post-operative pain is also potentially inadequate. This means that surgical patients potentially experience severe pain in the first 48 hours following surgery, increasing the risk of chronic pain development as well as post-operative complications thereby placing a greater burden on already limited health care resources. These proposed observational audits will look at a population of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>patients</b> at a Level Two Hospital in Cape Town. The study will be performed at Victoria Hospital Wynberg (VHW). VHW performs a large number of orthopaedic cases each week, giving us access to a potentially large number of patients. The choice of <b>orthopaedic</b> <b>patients</b> {{is due to the fact}} that orthopaedic surgery has been shown in some studies to be associated with a greater degree of post-operative pain as rated by patients when compared to other surgical disciplines. The high levels of pain associated with orthopaedic surgery are thought to be due to the degree of tissue trauma and the nature of tissue involved in the surgery itself...|$|R

40|$|Constipation is a multifactorial {{digestive}} disorder highly prevailing among the hospitalized elderly <b>Orthopaedic</b> <b>patients.</b> Unlike Western countries, laxative therapy {{is used to}} be the first line remedy for constipation in many hospitals of Hong Kong although fiber-rich diet has been proven by numerous studies as the best alternative with low cost and less complications. This dissertation is a translational nursing research which aims at formulating a programme of using fiber-rich food products for relieving constipation in elderly <b>Orthopaedic</b> <b>patients,</b> based on the best available research evidences. It was started with an integrated and systematic review of papers studying the dietary interventions for relieving constipation and reducing laxative consumption in elderly with ADL dependency. Seven relevant studies were identified and critically appraised using the methodology checklist for RCTs designed by Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN). After summarizing and synthesizing the data, three dietary interventions with 1 + level of evidence were concluded as the most effective strategies for eradicating the clinical issue. Following assessment of the implementation potential of the proposed innovation in designated clinical setting in terms of transferability, feasibility and cost-benefit ratio, an evidence-based dietary fiber enrichment programme was developed with recommendations for patient recruitment, intervention and evaluation. Furthermore, to assure a smooth change of practice and to determine the effectiveness of the programme, comprehensive plans of communication with different stakeholders, pilot study and evaluation were also subsequently established. With this evidence-based programme, the prevalence of functional constipation and laxative consumption are hoped to be reduced in elderly <b>Orthopaedic</b> <b>patients.</b> published_or_final_versionNursing StudiesMasterMaster of Nursin...|$|R
