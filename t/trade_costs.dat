40|$|We {{study the}} <b>trading</b> <b>costs</b> {{for a large}} sample of equity mutual funds. Using the actual {{brokerage}} commissions paid in 2002 and estimating the implicit <b>trading</b> <b>costs,</b> we find that fund investors bear substantial portfolio <b>trading</b> <b>costs.</b> Equity funds incur an average annual explicit brokerage commission of 38 basis points and an average annual implicit <b>trading</b> <b>cost</b> of 58 basis points. When measured separately for different mutual fund styles, these costs are highest for small cap funds and lowest for large cap funds. About 46 % of all small cap mutual funds have <b>trading</b> <b>costs</b> that are higher than the annual fees investors pay. We suspect that many mutual fund investors are completely unaware of these <b>trading</b> <b>costs</b> and simply assume that the reported expense ratio includes them.

40|$|Often, a {{relatively}} small group of trades causes the {{major part of the}} <b>trading</b> <b>costs</b> on an investment portfolio. Consequently, reducing the <b>trading</b> <b>costs</b> of comparatively few expensive trades would already result in substantial savings on total <b>trading</b> <b>costs.</b> Since <b>trading</b> <b>costs</b> depend to some extent on steering variables, investors can try to lower <b>trading</b> <b>costs</b> by carefully controlling these factors. As a fi rst step in this direction, this paper focuses on the identifi cation of expensive trades before actual trading takes place. However, forecasting market impact costs appears notoriously diffi cult and traditional methods fail. Therefore, we propose two alternative methods to form expectations about future <b>trading</b> <b>costs.</b> Applied to the equity trades of the world’s second largest pension fund, both methods succeed in fi ltering out a considerable number of trades with high <b>trading</b> <b>costs</b> and substantially outperform no-skill prediction methods.

3000|$|Table  4 shows, {{whether it}} is from the {{perspective}} of “global comparative advantage” or of “local comparative advantage” (Deardorff 2004), the aggregate <b>trade</b> <b>cost</b> has the effect on export structure of manufacturing, 9 which indicates the <b>trade</b> <b>cost</b> is similar with the material capital and human capital, and is also a factor that influences the trade pattern or structure. The increase in Chinese aggregate <b>trade</b> <b>cost</b> significantly reduces the export share of manufacturing. This effect in the industry with higher <b>trade</b> <b>cost</b> sensitivity is more obvious, and thereby affects the structure of trade commodities. Specifically, the <b>trade</b> <b>cost</b> sensitivity of “manufacturing of office, accounting and computing machinery (C 30)” is highest with the value of 0.523639; the <b>trade</b> <b>cost</b> sensitivity of “manufacture of radio, television and communication equipment and apparatus (C 32)” ranks second with the value of 0.464463; the <b>trade</b> <b>cost</b> sensitivity of “manufacture of medical equipment, precision instruments and optical instruments, watches and clocks manufacturing (C 33)” ranks third with the value of 0.464463. The decline of aggregate <b>trade</b> <b>cost</b> contributes to the effect of these industries export ranking the top three. The <b>trade</b> <b>cost</b> sensitivity of “food, beverage and tobacco manufacturing (C 15 T 16)” is lowest with the value of 0.118279. The <b>trade</b> <b>cost</b> sensitivity of “other non metallic mineral products manufacturing (C 26)” is in the reciprocal second with the value of 0.166794.

The decline of aggregate <b>trade</b> <b>cost</b> contributes to the effect of these industries export in the reciprocal three. This paper calculates the average degree of the effect of aggregate <b>trade</b> <b>cost</b> on different industries: for the first column that reflects the “global comparative advantage”, one unit decreasing of standard deviation in the Chinese aggregate <b>trade</b> <b>cost</b> contributes to 0.081 percentages increasing of export average value of the 17 industries; for the second column that reflects the “local comparative advantage” with the developed countries as the sample, one unit decreasing of standard deviation in the Chinese aggregate <b>trade</b> <b>cost</b> contributes to 0.095 percentages increasing of export average value of the 17 industries; for the third or fourth column that reflects the “local comparative advantage” with developing countries and countries along the “Belt and Road” as the sample, respectively, one unit decreasing of standard deviation in the Chinese aggregate <b>trade</b> <b>cost</b> contributes to 0.062 and 0.033 percentages increasing of export average value of the 17 industries, respectively. 10 [...]...|$|R

30|$|Overall, Chinese <b>trade</b> <b>cost</b> shows a {{downward}} trend with 108.4 % in 2000 declining to 0.9089 in 2013, which falls by 16.2 %.

During this period, the <b>trade</b> <b>cost</b> reached 0.973, which ranks fourth. This is due to the declining economic since the global financial crisis, which contributes to the deterioration of external situation. For example, the year of 2009 has the highest number of Chinese trade friction cases and highest amount.
