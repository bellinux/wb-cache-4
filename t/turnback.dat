5|$|Bondi Junction had {{originally}} been intended only as an intermediate <b>turnback</b> station before the extension to Kingsford was abandoned. As part of the Rail Clearways Program, the $77 million Bondi Junction <b>Turnback</b> project saw a new rail crossover was built between the single-track tunnels, enabling 20 trains an hour, up from 14, to use the station. The work was completed {{in time for the}} introduction of a new timetable on 28 May 2006.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} provide enough {{capacity}} for the line, the GG {{would have had to}} be taken off of the Queens Boulevard Line, and a <b>turnback</b> was necessary to provide a new terminal for the line. When the 63rd Street Connection opened in 2001, the Court Square station was rebuilt to provide a <b>turnback</b> facility for the line, which by then was renamed to G.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the opening}} of the Bondi Junction <b>Turnback</b> project in 2006, all trains have stopped at all {{stations}} on the Eastern Suburbs Line.|$|E
50|$|The Chevau-Léger Lanciers wore a red {{coat with}} blue lapels, cuffs and <b>turnbacks.</b> They wore a red piped yellow Polish shako. They had yellow aiguillettes and epaulettes.The {{trumpeters}} {{wore a white}} coat with red lapels, cuffs and <b>turnbacks.</b> They wore a white Polish shako and rode grey horses.|$|R
50|$|The {{regiment}} {{wore the}} standard powder blue coat of the Prussian dragoons with crimson <b>turnbacks</b> and facings.|$|R
50|$|Trumpeters wore {{reversed}} colors, a red {{coat with}} a red collar, silver cuffs edged blue, lapels and <b>turnbacks,</b> silver and blue epaulettes, {{as well as other}} items described above.|$|R
5|$|In 2009 Network Rail {{installed}} a 12-car <b>turnback</b> siding {{just south of}} Tunbridge Wells station between the Grove Hill and Strawberry Hill tunnels to facilitate a more frequent service and to allow restricted types of London trains starting or terminating at Tunbridge Wells to be operated in 12-car formations. Previously such services were 11-car at most.|$|E
5|$|TfL {{has also}} {{suggested}} {{there may be}} potential for the <b>turnback</b> siding adjacent to Milkwood Road to be converted for passenger use. This would require substantial changes to the station {{as there is no}} direct access to the platforms from Milkwood Road and the current subway for accessing the platforms does not extend east of the southbound platform.|$|E
5|$|There {{are flat}} {{junctions}} {{at each end}} of the station: Herne Hill North Junction, where the lines to Loughborough Junction and Brixton diverge; and Herne Hill South Junction, where the lines to West Dulwich and Tulse Hill diverge. Thameslink and Southeastern services cross each other's paths at the junctions, constraining capacity on both routes. The station also has a <b>turnback</b> siding on its eastern side, adjacent to Milkwood Road.|$|E
50|$|On January 12, 2007, Magnolia annexed 2325 acre {{east of the}} city, which {{includes}} approximately 1,100 people, increasing the population to 11,578. The city was expected to receive between $60,000 to $70,000 in state <b>turnbacks</b> per year as a result.|$|R
5000|$|The Cavalry Regiment El Rey in 1780 wore a blue coatee with scarlet cuffs, {{collar and}} lapels, white <b>turnbacks,</b> and yellow piping and had brass buttons, they also wore blue breeches. The troopers {{wore a black}} bi-corn hat with gold hat lace with a red cockade and gold cockade loop. Although during the Spanish War of Independence the unit wore a blue coat with scarlet cuffs, collar, lapels, <b>turnbacks,</b> gold piping and buff breeches.And as with all regiments {{at the start of}} the War of Spanish Idependence, they wore a red plume on their hat, to show their loyalty to the Bourbon monarch: Ferdinand VII of Spain instead of the [...] "hated foreigner": Joseph Bonaparte.|$|R
50|$|The Dragoon Guards wore green coats {{with white}} lapels and red <b>turnbacks.</b> They also wore aurore (light orange) aiguilettes and epaulettes. They wore brass helmets {{with a long}} black mane, a {{simulated}} leopard fur turban and a red plume. They rode chestnut horses.|$|R
5|$|From Kings Cross, {{the line}} {{proceeds}} west towards the Sydney Central Business District on a viaduct that passes over the suburb of Woolloomooloo and the Eastern Distributor. The line then passes into a tunnel underneath the Art Gallery of New South Wales to a station underneath Martin Place. Turning south, the line proceeds through Town Hall, Central and Redfern stations, before emerging behind the Eveleigh Railway Workshops. The line is double track throughout, with <b>turnback</b> sidings at Martin Place and Bondi Junction for citybound trains, and at Central for trains from Bondi Junction.|$|E
5|$|The {{downtown}} transit tunnel {{is expected}} to lose bus service in 2019, due to construction at Convention Place station; the tunnel would become served exclusively by light rail trains after that point. International District/Chinatown station will become the transfer point between the north–south Central Link light rail line and east–west East Link light rail line when the latter opens in 2023, connecting Seattle to Mercer Island, Bellevue, and Redmond. The new line will include {{the construction of a}} <b>turnback</b> track within the station, as well as reconfiguration of other tracks.|$|E
5|$|In 1845 and 1846, a {{line from}} Malden to Salem via Saugus and Lynnfield was {{proposed}} but did not pass the legislature due to bitter objections from the Eastern. Instead, the Saugus Branch Railroad opened from Malden to Lynn Common on February 1, 1853. Affiliated with the Eastern's primary rival, the Boston and Maine Railroad (B), it did not initially have a connection with the Eastern. In 1855, the Eastern acquired the majority stock of the Saugus Branch Railroad to keep {{it away from the}} B The connection to the B at Malden was severed, and it was connected to the Eastern at South Malden (Everett) and West Lynn. Lynn became the primary <b>turnback</b> point for the Saugus Branch after 1855, though a limited number of trains continued to Salem until World War I.|$|E
50|$|The {{uniform of}} the Grenadiers of the Imperial Guard was {{very similar to that}} of the Grenadier of the line : Both were made of a blue coat, red piped white cuffs, white piped red lapels, blue piped red cuff flaps, red epaulettes and brass buttons. The most notable {{difference}} was the headgear : Grenadiers of the Guard wore a tall bearskin cap with a brass plate stamped with the Imperial eagle, with white cords and red plume, and a red patch with a golden grenade on the top of the bearskin. Other differences include the blue collar of the Guard Grenadiers (instead of red pipped white collar for Line grenadiers) and longer red <b>turnbacks</b> with gold grenades (instead of white <b>turnbacks</b> piped red with red grenades).|$|R
5000|$|Australian PM Tony Abbott {{said the}} tragedies were [...] "worsened by Europe's refusal {{to learn from}} its own {{mistakes}} and from the efforts of others who have handled similar problems. Destroying the criminal people-smugglers was the centre of gravity of our border control policies, and judicious boat <b>turnbacks</b> was the key." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{trumpeters}} wore a {{light blue}} tunic with white lappels and crimson <b>turnbacks</b> and collar. The mane on their helmets {{was white and}} the plume was light blue. They wore grey horses. They also had a white uniform for parade, consisting of a white coat with light blue lappels and collar lined with gold.|$|R
5|$|In 1967 {{construction}} again commenced on {{yet another}} variation on Bradfield's design. This involved the earlier route used towards Bondi Junction through Woolloomooloo, then an extension towards Kingsford with five extra stations at Charing Cross, Frenchmans Road, Randwick, University and Kingsford. The New South Wales Government awarded the contract for the civil and structural design to the successful Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority. An official Legislative Assembly inquiry in 1976, however, recommended that costs on the project be cut, and the extension to Kingsford, a proposed station at Woollahra, {{and the expansion of}} concourse areas at Bondi Junction and Martin Place stations did not proceed. Nonetheless, it was resolved to fully integrate the railway with the Illawarra line. The Eastern Suburbs Railway opened between Central station and Bondi Junction on 23 June 1979. Initially trains ran as shuttle services between Central and Bondi Junction; it was not until a year later that work was finished to integrate the lines. A double-track junction with the Illawarra Line at Erskineville south of Illawarra Junction, twin single track tunnels connecting to the Eastern Suburbs Railway platforms at Central, a set of underground platforms at Redfern and a <b>turnback</b> tunnel at Martin Place opened to complete the project on 20 July 1980.|$|E

50|$|The Southern Sydney Freight Line {{passes to}} the east of the station. It opened in January 2013. Around the same time, a new {{platform}} for southbound services was constructed as part of the Rail Clearways Program. Platform 4 opened in January 2014. Previously platform 2 was the main southbound platform with platform 3 used for <b>turnbacks.</b>|$|R
50|$|A new {{timetable}} {{released in}} October 2013 broke the loop {{between the two}} lines. As part of the Rail Clearways Program, new <b>turnbacks</b> were constructed at Lidcombe and Homebush to allow the separation of both lines and increase their reliability and frequency. Services were also changed to operate mostly around the City Circle via Town Hall on weekdays (rather than via Museum).|$|R
30|$|The {{need for}} a moving body to vacate a {{transfer}} point {{before it can be}} used by another: the alighting and boarding of passengers depending on the layout of the vehicle doors; “clearance time” between successive buses at a stop; time taken for a bus to rejoin the traffic flow after stopping in another lane; railway switches; the interaction between switches and <b>turnbacks</b> in a rail terminal.|$|R
25|$|Additional down {{platform}} and <b>turnback</b> facility at Stevenage (part of the ECML Connectivity programme) - now delayed from CP5 to CP6.|$|E
25|$|Line 1 is a {{standard}} gauge double-track tramway. Trams are driven manually under a mix of line-of-sight and signals. <b>Turnback</b> crossovers along the line, including in the street section, have point indicators.|$|E
25|$|During {{the morning}} peak, from 6:00am to 9:00am Monday to Friday, half the trains are turned back at Glencairn Station {{resulting}} in limited service north of that point. The <b>turnback</b> was moved from St. Clair West Station to Glencairn in 2016, and current plans call {{it to be}} moved further to Pioneer Village Station in late 2017 when the York University extension opens.|$|E
50|$|The Gendarmes d'élite wore a blue {{coat with}} red lapels, cuffs and <b>turnbacks.</b> The collar and cuff flaps were red piped blue. They wore buff breeches, {{waistcoat}} and gloves. They had white aiguillettes and clover-shaped epaulettes. They wore a tall bearskin cap with a visor, {{topped by a}} red round cloth patch nicknamed cul-de-singe ("monkey bottom") with a white grenade embroidered on it. They rode black horses.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} two heavy bomb {{groups of}} the Eighth Air Force transferred to North Africa and were replaced in October and November by four new groups of B-17s (the 306th, 91st, 303rd, and 305th groups), and two of B-24 Liberators (44th and 93rd BGs), each of which experimented with its own formations. Their early missions included numerous mechanical <b>turnbacks</b> ("aborts") which hampered development of effective schemes.|$|R
50|$|The Norrköping tramway is a standard-gauge {{electrically}} powered system, operated by Transdev {{on behalf of}} the regional transport authority, ÖstgötaTrafiken. The infrastructure and the tramcars are, however, property of Norrköping Municipality. It has track loops {{at the end of the}} lines and at various other points to allow <b>turnbacks,</b> as most of the trams are unidirectional. The tram depot is located off Östra Promenaden, between the Djäkneparksskolan and Centralbadet stops.|$|R
25|$|From 1981 {{until the}} 1990s, Littleton was the <b>turnback</b> {{point for a}} limited number of trains. Its parking lot was just 40 spaces, {{insufficient}} for demand. In 1995, local officials proposed building a new station on a state highway parcel off Route 2A, as the Foster Street site was considered too rural for a garage. However, at the time, the MBTA was focused on reactivating the Old Colony Lines and was not adding parking to existing stations.|$|E
25|$|The study {{suggested}} an alternative {{station at the}} Division 20 Yard north of 4th Street and Santa Fe Avenue. This station would {{be closer to the}} residential population of the Arts District. As new <b>turnback</b> tracks will need to be built as part of the Purple Line Extension (to allow shorter headways), this Arts District extension could possibly be partially completed as part of the Purple Line Extension project, lowering the incremental cost of the station while increasing its usability.|$|E
25|$|The {{system has}} no triangles {{and only a}} single <b>turnback</b> loop. Therefore, all rolling stock must be bidirectional, with cabs at each end. There are also two non-switch 90-degree {{crossing}}s, between the lines of routes 1 and 21/22, on the crossing of Zonnestraat with Veldstraat as well as Korte Meers street. There are two crossings because the track of route 1 passes over streets in each direction. Along the Korte Meer the tram track goes toward the city center, the Korenmarkt stop, yet returns along the pedestrian/tram-only shopping area along the Veldstraat.|$|E
5000|$|Throughout {{most of the}} 18th {{century the}} regiment's coat was white (originally the grey-white of non-dyed wool), with a blue {{waistcoat}} underneath, without <b>turnbacks</b> or a collar, and with pewter buttons. Facings were red (on the cuffs only). Canadian troops wore the same, except with a red waistcoat. Both fusiliers and grenadiers wore black tricorns laced white. As part of the reorganisations of 1791 the regimental facings were changed to sky-blue ...|$|R
5000|$|The new {{timetable}} {{was designed}} to integrate the projects of the Rail Clearways Program, a 2004 plan to divide the network's fourteen metropolitan rail lines into five independent [...] "clearways" [...] by installing extra tracks, passing loops, turnouts and <b>turnbacks</b> at pinch points around the network. By 2013, the Rail Clearways Program was substantially complete, allowing the timetable to be rewritten. At the same time, the delivery of 78 new Waratah trains was almost complete as well. A substantial change introduced by the new timetable was the abolition of Bankstown loop services and most Liverpool via Regents Park services. These changes were made possible by Rail Clearways projects to construct new <b>turnbacks</b> at Homebush and Lidcombe. This allowed {{the operation of the}} Inner West and Bankstown lines to be separated, freeing up capacity between Lidcombe and Homebush for use by other services. However, the changes attracted criticism due to the increased number of interchanges and increase in travel time for passengers for all stations between Carramar/Berala and Birrong.|$|R
50|$|In 1812, the cut of {{the coat}} was changed into a coatee that {{included}} short tails, a blue crowned N on the <b>turnbacks,</b> and the lapels fastened down to the waist and cut square. The waistcoat was made higher and was therefore not visible. The black gaiters came up to below the knees. The plate on the shako was now a crowned eagle over a semicircle with the regimental number inscribed on it.|$|R
