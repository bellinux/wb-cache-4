40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop an {{efficient}} heuristic for the process selection and part cell assignment problem. The study assumes a production environment where each part has several process plans, each manifested by a required set of tools. These tools can be assigned to different machines based on a tool – machine compatibility matrix. An additional assumption is that all relevant data such as periodic demand, processing time, processing cost, tool magazine capacity, <b>tool</b> <b>changing</b> <b>time,</b> tool life and tool cost are fixed and known. A mixed integer linear program which takes all relevant data into account is developed to minimize the production cost. The suggested solution approach to solve this model makes use of Genetic Algorithms: a class of heuristic search and optimization techniques that imitate the natural selection and evolutionary process. First, the encoding of the solutions into integer strings is presented, as well as the genetic operators used by the algorithm. Next, the efficiency and robustness of the solution procedure is demonstrated through several different examples...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the design and}} build of a multiple position turret used to simultaneously attach six end effectors to a four-degree of freedom Adept robot. The main objective of this thesis {{is to develop a}} prototype tool changer that is different, more cost effective, and offers more features and versatility than any other. Use of the turret allows the robot to quickly change the end effector in use by simply rotating any of the others into the ready position. This reduces the <b>tool</b> <b>changing</b> <b>time</b> in a high-speed assembly process that is normally associated with conventional tool changers disconnecting one end effector and picking up another. Employing the turret concept in a robotic assembly operation will also lengthen the life of the robot because there are fewer moves that have to be made by the robot itself. The turret is approximately 8 inches high, 7 inches wide and its turntable is 6. 25 inches in diameter. This small envelope is a large benefit over the bulky system that would be needed for the more traditional tool changers. The turret 2 ̆ 7 s weight while populated with six small end effectors is approximately 10. 5 pounds. The cost of the turret, not including end effectors, is approximately 5, 500...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{small and}} medium batch series {{manufacturing}} the small <b>tool</b> and workpiece <b>changing</b> <b>time</b> {{is one of}} the main objectives to follow in obtaining high productivity. These auxiliary times are defined as the times consumed with preparing and <b>changing</b> the next <b>tool</b> or workpiece to follow the machining process, times that usually overlap the machining process. For this purpose machining centres are equipped with an automatic tool changer system and an automatic pallet changer system. The palletizing systems imply eliminating the times consumed with the alignment, fixing and clamping of the workpieces, these systems consisting of several mechanisms: the pallet, the automatic pallet changing mechanism, the positioning mechanism and the pallet clamp/unclamp mechanism. In this paper we present an general overview of the automatic pallet changing mechanisms used both in flexible manufacturing systems and machining centres...|$|R
40|$|The Dutch {{institute}} of applied physics of TNO and the Institute of Metals TNO (Apeldoorn) have installed a {{flexible manufacturing system}} (FMS). The main components of this FMS are a turret lathe, a machining centre and a transport system. One of the objectives of this system is to produce a wide variety of parts in small batches. Several interesting (short term) planning and scheduling problems arise from this objective. Among others, (1) which orders should be processed in a certain period, and (2) in what sequence should the selected orders be processed. In solving these problems, one has to take into account due dates, process plans (routing), capacities of the machines and the tool magazines, <b>tool</b> and jaw <b>changing</b> <b>times,</b> limited fixturing capacity, fixturing and clamping times and the limited number of operators and transport devices.

40|$|Six Sigma is a {{philosophy}} based on setting attainable short-term goals while striving for long-term objectives. Six sigma {{is a highly}} disciplined approach used to reduce the process variations {{to the extent that}} the level of defects are drastically reduced to less than 3. 4 per million process, product or service opportunities (DPMO). Six Sigma, in many organizations, simply means a measure of quality that strives for near perfection. Six Sigma is a disciplined, data-driven approach and methodology for eliminating defects (driving towards six standard deviations between the mean and the nearest specification limit) in any process; from manufacturing to transactional and from product to service. The Six Sigma method allows us to draw comparisons to other similar or dissimilar products, services, and processes. In this manner, we can see how far ahead or behind we are. Six Sigma helps us to establish our course and gauge our pace in the race for total customer satisfaction. The work is carried out at Tulja Engineering Aurangabad, a Medium scale manufacturing unit. The project aims to reduce <b>tool</b> <b>changing</b> <b>time</b> at grinding wheel station. This problem was rectified to a great extent using Metrics, why? Why?

We don’t usually manage with one active term (tool) {{in the cause of}} the mechanical machining only but we derive benefits from many different tools in the appropriate operation circle. Therefore the first matter of raising productivity of machine-tools was a necessity to change automatic tools. The main contribution of automatic <b>tools</b> <b>changing</b> that are used by numerical control machines is a possibility of automatic control of whole machining on the one specific machine. An automatic <b>tool</b> <b>changing</b> contributes to reduction of operation time and to reduction of the amount of operation’s intervention during the industrial process.

40|$|This study {{develops}} {{software that}} provides optimum lathe cutting conditions for specific materials and parameters. This {{is accomplished by}} developing a model, based on empirical and analytical relationships, which estimates the optimum cutting conditions, (i. e. spindle speed, feed rate and depth of cut) for a single pass, external turning operation. These parameters are optimized to yield the minimum production cost, while satisfying constraints imposed by workpiece specifications and equipment limitations. The equipment limitations considered include the available machine power, maximum workholding force of the lathe, range of spindle speeds, feed rates for the lathe and tool, {{and the range of}} depth of cut of the tool. The workpiece constraints are the surface finish specification for the part and the maximum allowable deflection of the part at each cross section. The effects of each of these limitations are discussed. The developed analytical model introduces manufacturing economics, along with the above constraints, into a decision making process which heretofore relied primarily on the lathe operator 2 ̆ 7 s experience and standard handbooks. Typically, the determination of the metal cutting conditions is based on the machinist 2 ̆ 7 s experience. This method of specifying cutting conditions tends to emphasize the requirements of the workpiece specifications - i. e. surface finish and dimensional tolerances - excluding economic considerations. On the other hand, a pure rate of production analysis would maximize the ratio of actual cutting time to total machining time without considering workpiece specifications or the implications of operating the equipment at the maximum production rate. While minimizing the production time generally reduces production costs, there is a trade off to be considered. A higher production rate requires an increase in spindle speed or tool feedrate resulting in a decreased tool life. This reduction in tool life adds the associated costs of additional <b>tools</b> and <b>tool</b> <b>changing</b> <b>times</b> to the production cost. Hence, it is necessary to find the operating conditions which will minimize cost while considering all aspects of the manufacturing process. With the increasing usage of CNC lathes which involve large capital expenditures, the use of an economic analysis combined with technical considerations becomes imperative for minimizing the overall production cost. Further, an effective optimization procedure allows low volume runs on many different part numbers with the first part being both cost effective and fit for function. The methodology used to develop the model was based on published literature, experimentation, and several well known and widely accepted equations defining tool-life and tool-workpiece relationships. Through the use of a statistically designed experiment, data was obtained and a set of equations was determined to estimate the cutting forces generated in the turning operation. The data compared favorably with the published equations for calculating cutting forces which were used in this model. The parameters for this experiment, which was conducted on an instrumented lathe at Renesselaer Polytechnic Institute, were feed rate and depth of cut. An additional experiment was conducted to determine the tool life corresponding to the maximum allowable tool flank wear for several feed rates. These values are unique for a tool-workpiece material combination. For the purpose of applying the model, the experimentation was restricted to the use of a carbide coated tool insert and a free machining stainless steel, AISI 416. The work was based on the actual needs and production tooling of a major company. The determination of the empirical constants for other tool-workpiece material combinations would extend the model 2 ̆ 7 s application. The optimization procedure is incorporated into a computer program to calculate the economical machining parameters in a finishing operation...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} aimed {{to find the}} optimum path of CNC turret typing system to reduce the <b>changing</b> <b>tools</b> <b>times</b> and {{optimize}} tool movement routes {{to make up for}} the deficiency of CNC Turret Typing machine production efficiency. An uncertainty polynomial model is raised based on the asymmetric traveling salesman problem. And genetic algorithm (GA) is used to solve the path optimization problem. The optimization of path can minimize the moving tools times. Furthermore, the optimization problem is simplified to shortest distance between points. Fitness function, selection operator, crossover operator, mutation operator and other genetic operations are studied in this paper. In addition, the greedy crossover operator, the elite preservation strategy and the self-adaption strategy are imported in GA, which enhance the ability of finding the optimum and speed the efficiency. Finally, MATLAB simulation testifies that the algorithm is valid. The experiment result shows that the GA can shorten processing time and can reduce the air travel effectively without changing the machine’s hardware through reasonable arrangement of the <b>changing</b> and moving <b>tools</b> path.

40|$|Abstract. Automated <b>tool</b> <b>changing</b> of CNC {{machines}} {{reduces the}} cycle time of operations as most processes require {{a number of}} different tools to complete a task. The machine can be pre-loaded with the required tools and programmed to automatically retrieve the tools as required.
