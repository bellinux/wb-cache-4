500|$|During {{the spring}} and summer of 2014, several journalists {{observed}} that Frozen was unusually catchy in comparison to the vast majority of films, in that many children in both the U.S. and the UK were watching Frozen so many times that they now knew all the songs by heart and kept singing them again and again at every opportunity, to the distress of their hapless parents, teachers, and classmates. Among the celebrities who disclosed they were the parent of a Frozen-obsessed child are former UK prime minister David Cameron, as well as actors Amy Adams, Ben Affleck, Kevin Costner and Vince Vaughn. When <b>Terry</b> <b>Gross</b> brought up this phenomenon with songwriters Lopez and Anderson-Lopez in an April 2014 interview on NPR, they explained there was simply no way they could have known how popular their work on Frozen would become. They were [...] "just trying to tell a story that resonated" [...] and [...] "that didn't suck." ...|$|E
500|$|Avatar {{has been}} called [...] "without a doubt the most epic piece of {{environmental}} advocacy ever captured on celluloid.... The film hits all the important environmental talking-points—virgin rain forests threatened by wanton exploitation, indigenous peoples who have much to teach the developed world, a planet which functions as a collective, interconnected Gaia-istic organism, and evil corporate interests {{that are trying to}} destroy it all." [...] Cameron has spoken extensively with the media about the film's environmental message, saying that he envisioned Avatar as a broader metaphor of how we treat the natural world. [...] He said that he created Pandora as [...] "a fictionalised fantasy version of what our world was like, before we started to pave it and build malls, and shopping centers. [...] So it's really an evocation of the world we used to have." [...] He told Charlie Rose that [...] "we are going to go through a lot of pain and heartache if we don't acknowledge our stewardship responsibilities to nature." [...] Interviewed by <b>Terry</b> <b>Gross</b> of National Public Radio, he called Avatar a satire on the sense of human entitlement: [...] " [...] is saying our attitude about indigenous people and our entitlement about what is rightfully theirs is the same sense of entitlement that lets us bulldoze a forest and not blink an eye. It's just human nature that if we can take it, we will. And sometimes we do it in a very naked and imperialistic way, and other times we do it in a very sophisticated way with lots of rationalization—but it's basically the same thing. A sense of entitlement. And we can't just go on in this unsustainable way, just taking what we want and not giving back." [...] An article in the Belgium paper De Standaard agreed: [...] "It's about the brutality of man, who shamelessly takes what isn't his." ...|$|E

2500|$|Christopher often {{comments}} on {{his inability to}} appreciate some metaphors and similes. He gives as an example a quote that he found in [...] "a proper novel": [...] "I am veined with iron, with silver and with streaks of common mud. I cannot contract into the firm fist which those clench who do not depend on stimulus." [...] Haddon told <b>Terry</b> <b>Gross,</b> [...] "Funnily enough, it's actually a quote from Virginia Woolf. It's Virginia Woolf on an off day, in the middle, I think, of The Waves. An author whom I love actually, but who sometimes got a little too carried away." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{recording}} some demonstration {{songs for}} Sam Phillips at Sun Records that Phillips considered not commercial enough and [...] "too jazzy", {{he was given}} a stack of Jerry Lee Lewis records and told: [...] "Come back when you get that bad." [...] In a September 6, 2010, NPR airing of a 1992 interview with Fresh Air host <b>Terry</b> <b>Gross,</b> Charlie Rich tells the story, himself, of Bill Justis telling Rich's wife those words. In 1958, Rich became a regular session musician for Sun Records, playing on a variety of records by Lewis, Johnny Cash, Bill Justis, Warren Smith, Billy Lee Riley, Carl Mann, and Ray Smith. He also wrote several songs for Lewis, Cash, and others.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Fresh Air host <b>Terry</b> <b>Gross,</b> Ullman revealed {{that when she was}} six, her father, who had been recovering from a heart operation, {{died of a heart attack}} in front of her while the two were alone and as he was reading to her. He was fifty years old. [...] "When that happens to you as a child, you can face anything. You're always waiting for the other shoe to drop. If something great happens, you're like, 'Wow, that's great that happened, because it could have been crap'. The most disappointing thing happened when you were younger [...] You're just braver and if good things happen you're really grateful." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1959, Fender {{recorded}} the blues ballad [...] "Wasted Days and Wasted Nights". The song was a hit, {{but he was}} beset by legal troubles in May 1960 after he and a band member were arrested for possession of marijuana in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. After serving nearly {{three years in the}} Angola prison farm, he was released through the intervention of then-governor Jimmie Davis, also a songwriter and musician. Davis requested that Fender stay away from music while on probation as a condition of his release. However, in a 1990 NPR interview on Fresh Air with <b>Terry</b> <b>Gross</b> (rebroadcast October 17, 2006), Fender said that the condition for parole was to stay away from places that served alcohol.|$|E
2500|$|There was {{competition}} among top news anchors and interviewers {{to get the}} first interviews with Clinton about the book. [...] In the end, Clinton sat down with several of them; the first went to ABC News' Diane Sawyer and aired on June 9. [...] The interviews themselves sometimes made news on topics unrelated to those covered by the book, such as Clinton's description to Sawyer of her and Bill's financial state {{as they left the}} White House ("dead broke") and an exchange with NPR's <b>Terry</b> <b>Gross</b> on Clinton's evolving views on same-sex marriage. [...] A later, unannounced appearance on The Colbert Report earned her some positive notices for a comic touch in her mock exchanges with host Stephen Colbert.|$|E
2500|$|When Ice Cube, {{a father}} of four, was asked in January 2005 on NPR by Fresh Air's <b>Terry</b> <b>Gross</b> whether he allowed his {{children}} {{to listen to his}} music, he responded: [...] "What's worked for me is instilling in my kids a level of self-respect", and helping them to understand the content of not just music but the violence found on the evening news. When asked what he tells his children about profanity, he recalled telling his kids that there are [...] "appropriate times to use any kind of language. ... Adults should never hear you use these words. If you want to use these words around your friends, that's really all on you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Comedian Dan Aykroyd {{described}} himself (in a radio interview with <b>Terry</b> <b>Gross)</b> as having mild Tourette syndrome that was successfully treated with therapy {{when he was}} a preteen, as well as mild Asperger syndrome. [...] The diagnosis of Asperger syndrome was not recognized in the 1960s, when Aykroyd was a preteen. The term was coined in 1981, and became a recognized diagnosis in the 1994 DSM. [...] Tics can be caused by other disorders, including autism spectrum disorders such as Asperger's. It is unclear if Aykroyd received the diagnoses of TS or AS from a medical source, whether he was speaking in his role as a comic, or whether the diagnoses were self-made. It was an audio interview, so the audience could not see Aykroyd's facial expressions, but the interviewer indicated uncertainty about whether Aykroyd was joking.|$|E
2500|$|Haddon added, in the {{conversation}} with <b>Terry</b> <b>Gross,</b> [...] "I have to say honestly that I did more research about the London Underground and the inside of Swindon Railway Station, {{where some of the}} novel takes place, than I did about Asperger's syndrome. I gave him kind of nine or 10 rules that he would live his life by, and then I didn't read any more about Asperger's because I think there is no typical person who has Asperger's syndrome, and they're as large and diverse a group of people as any other group in society. And {{the important thing is that}} I did a lot of imagining, that I did a lot of putting myself into his shoes in trying to make him come alive as a human being rather than getting him right, whatever that might mean." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 5, 2003, Mohler {{appeared}} on NPR's Fresh Air with <b>Terry</b> <b>Gross</b> {{to ponder the}} issue of evangelization of the Iraqis. At issue was whether the coupling of evangelizing with basic human aid relief might be perceived as aggressive or coercive by the Iraqi people, and whether such a perception, if widespread, might place other relief workers in jeopardy. Mohler argued that biblical, evangelical Christianity is not uniquely American, but exists as a movement throughout the world, so that Christian witnessing is not, in his view, to {{be interpreted as a}} move on the part of any single nation against the religion of another. At the same time, however, Mohler acknowledged the need for [...] "sensitivity," [...] and distanced himself from the idea that religion coerced. When pressed, Mohler expressed support for the idea of religious freedom as a theoretical matter of law.|$|E
2500|$|In a June 2003 {{interview}} with NPR's <b>Terry</b> <b>Gross</b> on her program Fresh Air, Haddon said about Christopher, [...] "If he were diagnosed, {{he would be}} diagnosed as having Asperger's syndrome, which {{is a form of}} autism. I suppose you'd call it high-function autism in that he can function on, you know, a day-to-day basis, in a kind of rudimentary way. But he has a serious difficulty with life in that he really doesn't empathize with other human beings. He can't read their faces. He can't put himself in their shoes. And he can't understand anything more than the literal meaning of whatever's said to him, although I'm very careful in the book not to actually use the word 'Asperger's' or 'autism.' ... Because I don't want him to be labelled, and because, as with most people who have a disability, I don't think it's necessarily {{the most important thing about}} him... And as a good friend of mine said after reading the book, a friend who is himself a mathematician, it's not a novel about a boy who has Asperger's syndrome; it's a novel about a young mathematician who has some strange behavioural problems. And I think that's right." ...|$|E
