50|$|Taper tap: The small tap {{illustrated}} at {{the bottom}} of the image is similar to an intermediate tap but has a more pronounced taper to the cutting edges. This feature gives the <b>taper</b> <b>tap</b> a very gradual cutting action that is less aggressive than that of the plug tap. The number of tapered threads typically ranges from 8 to 10. A <b>taper</b> <b>tap</b> is most often used when the material to be tapped is difficult to work (e.g., alloy steel) or the tap is of a very small diameter and thus prone to breakage.|$|E
50|$|With soft or average {{hardness}} materials, such as plastic, aluminum or mild steel, {{the common}} practice {{is to use}} an intermediate (plug) tap to cut the threads. If the threads are to extend {{to the bottom of}} a blind hole, the intermediate (plug) tap will be used to cut threads until the point of the tap reaches bottom, after which a bottoming tap will be used to finish the hole. Frequent ejection of the chips must be made in such an operation to avoid jamming and possibly breaking the tap. With hard materials, the machinist may start with a <b>taper</b> <b>tap,</b> whose less severe diameter transition reduces the amount of torque required to cut the threads. If threads are to be cut to the bottom of a blind hole, the <b>taper</b> <b>tap</b> will be followed by an intermediate (plug) tap and then a bottoming tap to finish the operation.|$|E

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of selected physiological and perceptual measures for monitoring training load and fatigue was studied in 16 male elite rugby sevens players during a 6 -week intense training block (IT) and 2 -week <b>tapering</b> (<b>TAP).</b> Daily training load (TL) and strain (TS) {{as well as}} weekly total score of fatigue (TSF) were quantified respectively by the session-rating of perceived exertion (RPE) method and an 8 -item questionnaire. Also, testing was performed and 24 h urinary cortisol (C), cortisone (Cn), adrenaline (A) and noradrenalin (NA) excretion was measured before (T 0) and after the IT (T 1) and after the TAP (T 2). The TL, TS and TSF increased during the IT and decreased during the TAP, {{in conjunction with a}} significant drop and improvement, respectively, of performance standards during the two periods. At T 1, C and Cn levels increased while A and NA levels decreased, resulting in a higher C/Cn ratio and lower A/NA ratio, respectively. At T 2, both C/Cn and A/NA returned to baseline values. The changes in C/Cn ratio, after the 6 -week IT, were more closely related to mean TL, TS and TSF (r= 0. 75 - 0. 76 vs. r= 0. 48 - 0. 58, p< 0. 01) and to changes in the majority of performance measures than to A/NA ratio. Only the changes in C/Cn ratio after the 2 -week TAP were related to mean TL, TS and TSF (r= 0. 61 - 0. 68, p< 0. 01). The changes in hormone levels, training strain and performance standards reflected the physical and mental stressors of training, with complete recovery, as indicated by physiological homeostasis, achieved after an appropriate tapering period...|$|R
40|$|Carbon Dioxide (CO 2) {{laser beam}} cutting (LBC) process {{involves}} several parameters. These parameters {{need to be}} optimized {{in order to get}} the best quality output. Researchers had applied various types of optimization methods which are used for single or multi-objectives problems. One of the methods is Grey-Taguchi method. However, there is a disadvantage of these methods. This study focuses on improving the Grey-Taguchi method in order to optimize machining parameters for CO 2 LBC. The Variable Weight Grey-Taguchi method is proposed which considering all possible weights to be assigned to the control and noise factors. The considered control factors are stand-off distance, cutting speed and laser power. This study also considers surrounding temperature as noise factor. The superior of these methods is merely depending on the response factors which are Surface Roughness (SR), Kerf <b>Taper</b> Angle (<b>TAP),</b> Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) and Kerf Width (KW). Results from Matlab assisted physical experiment shows there is an effect on weight assigning to the factors. Results also show that the proposed method successfull improved all the response factors. Surface roughness had improved by 49. 4 %, taper 52 %, Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) 9. 3 % and kerf width 46. 2 %. As conclusion, this study had successfully proposed an improved optimization method for LBC process...|$|R
