5|$|His role in The Widowmaker lead to {{him being}} offered and taking many obsessive {{character}} roles; he played {{police officers in}} Black and Blue, Framed, Between the Lines and Out of the Blue, and soldier Andy McNab in The One <b>That</b> <b>Got</b> <b>Away</b> (1996). Morrissey first met screenwriter Peter Bowker when he played Detective Sergeant Jim Llewyn in the second series of Bowker's Out of the Blue. In 1994, he played customs officer Gerry Birch in the first series of The Knock, and Stephen Finney in the six-part ITV series Finney. In Finney, Morrissey assumed the role originated by Sting in Stormy Monday (Mike Figgis, 1988). He was the first choice for the part and {{had to learn to}} play the double bass.|$|E
5|$|The rivalry {{intensified}} {{after the}} 1989 San Marino Grand Prix, {{where the two}} drivers had an agreement that neither would get in each other's way to the first corner (cf. 1982 San Marino Grand Prix). At the start, Senna got away in the lead and Prost followed him through the first corner without getting in Senna's way. Gerhard Berger's crash on lap four stopped the race. At the restart, it was Prost this time <b>that</b> <b>got</b> <b>away</b> the better of the two; but Senna forced his way past Prost in the first corner, breaking the pair's agreement {{at the start of}} the race, leaving the Frenchman furious with Senna. Senna argued it was the restart. Prost himself was angered by McLaren apparently favouring Senna because of Senna's better relationship with engine supplier Honda, so he announced mid-season that he had signed to race for Ferrari the following season.|$|E
25|$|Since 1989, McGann has {{concentrated}} {{primarily on}} television work, including Nice Town and Nature Boy for the BBC, and The One <b>That</b> <b>Got</b> <b>Away</b> {{and the second}} series of Hornblower for ITV. However, he has had small roles {{in a number of}} high-profile American films like The Three Musketeers and Alien 3. His role in Alien 3 was originally larger, but much of it was edited out of the final print. The cut footage {{can be seen in the}} extended version of the film.|$|E

60|$|With <b>that</b> he <b>got</b> <b>away</b> {{and leaving}} the house, he walked briskly up the street, round the corner, and on until he stood once more before Duplay's.|$|R

25|$|In 1957 More had {{announced}} that he would play the lead role of a captain caught up in the Indian Mutiny in Night Runners of Bengal but the film was never made. More turned down an offer from Roy Ward Baker to play a German POW in The One <b>That</b> <b>Got</b> <b>Away</b> (1957), but agreed to play the lead part of Charles Lightoller in the Titanic film for the same director, A Night to Remember (1958). This was the first of a seven-year contract with Rank at a fee of £40,000 a film. It was popular though failed to recoup its large cost; it was one of More's most critically acclaimed films.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} details Stefani's former {{relationship}} with Kanal. The same critic from Classic Rock Review {{agreed that it}} [...] "deal with Gwen Stefani's recent breakup with Kanal". Kenneth Partridge's Billboard review stated that the song's lyrics involved Stefani's feelings towards Kanal, adding that it was [...] "written about the guy <b>that</b> <b>got</b> <b>away</b> – and who was standing {{a few feet away}} with a bass around his neck". Similarly, David Browne of Entertainment Weekly approved of the [...] "taunt" [...] and [...] "savor" [...] lyrics that describe a man who ended a relationship but [...] "wants back in", such as [...] "All by yourself / You have no one else".|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} Quatermass and the Pit finally entered {{production}} Val Guest was occupied on Casino Royale (1967), so directing duties went instead to Roy Ward Baker. Baker's first film had been The October Man (1947) {{and he was}} best known for The One <b>That</b> <b>Got</b> <b>Away</b> (1957) and A Night to Remember (1958). Following the failure of Two Left Feet (1963), he moved into television, directing episodes of The Human Jungle (1963–64), The Saint (1962–69) and The Avengers. Producer Anthony Nelson Keys chose Baker as director because he felt his experience on such films as A Night to Remember gave him the technical expertise to handle the film's significant special effects requirements. Baker, for his part, felt that his background on fact-based dramas such as A Night to Remember and The One <b>That</b> <b>Got</b> <b>Away</b> enabled him to give Quatermass and the Pit the air of realism {{it needed to be}} convincing to audiences. He was impressed by Nigel Kneale's screenplay, feeling the script was [...] "taut, exciting and an intriguing story with excellent narrative drive. It needed no work at all. All one had to do was cast it and shoot it." [...] He was also impressed with Hammer Films’ lean set-up: having been used to working for major studios with thousands of full-time employees, he {{was surprised to find that}} Hammer's core operation consisted of just five people and enjoyed how this made the decision making process fast and simple. Quatermass and the Pit was the first film the director was credited as “Roy Ward Baker”, having previously been credited as “Roy Baker”. The change was made to avoid confusion with another Roy Baker who was a sound editor. Baker later regretted making the change as many people assumed he was a new director.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, I had a {{note from}} him; it is by his means <b>that</b> I <b>got</b> <b>away</b> from Bithoor. He sent me the caustic and acid to burn my face. He told me Mr. Wilson had also escaped, and perhaps some others may have <b>got</b> <b>away,</b> {{though he did not}} seem to know it." ...|$|R
500|$|According to Andrew Pulver of The Guardian, {{the public}} fascination with war films became an [...] "obsession", with over 200 war films {{produced}} in each {{decade of the}} 1950s and 1960s. War film production in the United Kingdom and United States reached its zenith in the mid 1950s. [...] Its popularity in the United Kingdom was {{brought on by the}} critical and commercial success of [...] Charles Frend's The Cruel Sea (1953). Like others of the period, The Cruel Sea was based on a bestselling novel, in this case the former naval commander Nicholas Monsarrat's story of the battle of the Atlantic. Others, like The Dam Busters (1954), with its exciting tale of the inventor Barnes Wallis's unorthodox bouncing bomb and its distinctive theme music, were true stories. The Dam Busters became the most popular film in Britain in 1955, and remained a favourite as of 2015 with a 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes, though, partly because it celebrated an [...] "exclusively British [...] ", it failed to break into the American market. A large number of war films were made in the 1955-58 period in particular. In 1957 alone, Bitter Victory, Count Five and Die, The Enemy Below, Ill Met by Moonlight, Men in War, The One <b>That</b> <b>Got</b> <b>Away</b> and Seven Thunders, and the highly successful, critically acclaimed pictures The Bridge on the River Kwai, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture that year, and Paths of Glory were released. Some, such as Bitter Victory, focused more on the psychological battle between officers and egotism rather than events during the war. The Bridge on the River Kwai brought a new complexity to the war picture, with a sense of moral uncertainty surrounding war. By {{the end of the decade}} the [...] " [...] sense of shared achievement" [...] which had been common in war films [...] "began to evaporate", according to Pulver.|$|E
2500|$|Parkinson {{was once}} {{asked if there}} was anyone that he regretted never having interviewed. He replied, [...] "Sinatra was the one <b>that</b> <b>got</b> <b>away.</b> Otherwise, I've met {{everyone}} I have ever wanted to meet." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{soldiers}} on the hill with the pack-horses began to fire on us. About this time all the Indians had got their horses and guns and bows and arrows and war-clubs and they charged the soldiers {{in the east and}} north on top of the hill. Custer was farther north than these soldiers were then. He was going to attack {{the lower end of the}} village. We drove nearly all <b>that</b> <b>got</b> <b>away</b> from us down the hill along the ridge where another lot of soldiers were trying to make a stand." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The {{conditions}} are two in number. In the first place, if I help you, will you promise, {{in case the}} plan falls through, {{that you will not}} tell Captain Langless what I did, but let him believe <b>that</b> you <b>got</b> <b>away</b> on your own hook?" ...|$|R

2500|$|There {{have been}} few {{recordings}} of the opera. [...] A 1989 recording was made by The Prince Consort. [...] A 1995-hour-long [...] "compressed version" [...] was recorded and presented by Roderic Dunnett (the Opera Now magazine reviewer) for his BBC Radio 3 Britannia at the Opera series. [...] Beyond that, a 1998 CD, Sullivan & Co.: The Operas <b>That</b> <b>Got</b> <b>Away</b> features two songs from the opera, {{and two of the}} soprano arias were recorded by Deborah Riedel with Richard Bonynge and the Opera Australia orchestra on The Power of Love – British Opera Arias (1999, Melba MR 30110).|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, it's {{a case of}} tit for tat, I suppose," [...] said Dunston Porter. [...] "You {{can thank}} your stars <b>that</b> you <b>got</b> <b>away</b> so quickly.

6000|$|... "I don't {{know where}} father is, if he isn't {{down by the}} river. I thought {{he went off to}} look up those hogs <b>that</b> <b>got</b> <b>away</b> last Saturday. In these times, so he says, we can't afford to lose six fat porkers." ...|$|E
