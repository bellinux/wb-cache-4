5|$|After Naylor {{was brought}} home, the mob {{attacked}} the church, damaging a wall with the cannon. A second cannon was {{brought from the}} wharfs and fired at the church, after which the mob pelted the building with rocks and broke in through a side door. The soldiers fired on the men breaking into the church, who promptly retreated. After retreating, the nativists negotiated with the guard, who agreed to withdraw, allowing the nativists <b>to</b> <b>guard</b> the church. Responding to being pelted with rocks as they left, some soldiers fired back on the crowd, which only incited the mob further. The mob forced {{its way into the}} church, causing extensive damage to the interior. After about an hour, a group of twenty men organized themselves <b>to</b> <b>guard</b> St. Philip Neri's, and the mob left the church.|$|E

5|$|All three {{ships of}} the class entered service with the French Navy in 1916. Bretagne and Lorraine were {{assigned}} to the 1st Division of the 1st Battle Squadron, while Provence served as the fleet flagship for the entirety of the First World War. They were deployed <b>to</b> <b>guard</b> {{the southern end of the}} Adriatic Sea, based in Argostoli and Corfu, to block a possible sortie by the Austro-Hungarian fleet. The three ships largely remained in port, though Provence was repeatedly used to intimidate the government of Greece, which favored Germany during the war. In January 1919, after the end of the war, Lorraine was sent to Cattaro <b>to</b> <b>guard</b> the Austro-Hungarian fleet. She joined her sisters in Toulon in June 1919; later that year the ships formed the Eastern Mediterranean Fleet until 1921.|$|E

5|$|When the Persians {{heard that}} the Allied fleet was approaching, they set sail from Samos towards the Ionian mainland. According to Herodotus, this was because they had decided in council {{that they could not}} beat the Allies in a naval battle. They sent the Phoenician ships away (Herodotus does not explain why), and then sailed to the shore near Mount Mycale. Xerxes had left an army there, under the command of Tigranes, <b>to</b> <b>guard</b> Ionia. The Persians beached their ships, built a {{palisade}} around them, and prepared <b>to</b> <b>guard</b> the makeshift fort.|$|E

5|$|With these {{reinforcements}} {{and smaller}} numbers of local volunteers who joined his forces, Washington's forces now totaled about 6,000 troops fit for duty.

Another group was sent to protect supplies at Newtown, Pennsylvania and <b>to</b> <b>guard</b> the sick and wounded who had to remain behind when the army crossed the Delaware River.

5|$|Æthelflæd {{had already}} {{fortified}} an unknown location called Bremesburh in 910 and in 912 she built defences at Bridgnorth {{to cover a}} crossing of the River Severn.

In 914 a Mercian army drawn from Gloucester and Hereford repelled a Viking invasion from Brittany, and the Iron Age Eddisbury hill fort was repaired to protect against invasion from Northumbria or Cheshire, while Warwick was fortified as further protection against the Leicester Danes. In 915 Chirbury was fortified <b>to</b> <b>guard</b> a route from Wales and Runcorn on the River Mersey. Defences were built before 914 at Hereford, and probably Shrewsbury and two other fortresses, at Scergeat and Weardbyrig, which have not been located.|$|E
5|$|After having {{received}} this information while at Rawicz, Charles struck camp on August 8 and marched closer to Warsaw {{in order to}} fully protect the city until the coronation of Leszczyński was completed.

The Alpine breed was also used as a watchdog <b>to</b> <b>guard</b> sheep and cattle of mountainous regions, including the Himalayas.|$|E
5|$|Amompharetus: The {{leader of}} a {{battalion}} of Spartans, he refused to undertake the night-time retreat towards Plataea before the battle, since doing so would be shameful for a Spartan. Herodotus has an angry debate continuing between Pausanias and Amompharetus until dawn, whereupon {{the rest of the}} Spartan army finally began to retreat, leaving Amompharetus' division behind. Not expecting this, Amompharetus eventually led his men after the retreating Spartans. However, another tradition remembers Amompharetus as winning great renown at Plataea, and it has thus been suggested that Amompharetus, far from being insubordinate, had instead volunteered <b>to</b> <b>guard</b> the rear.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 339 BC, the Thebans had seized the town of Nicaea near Thermopylae, which Philip had garrisoned in 346 BC. Philip {{does not appear to have}} treated this as a {{declaration}} of war, but it nevertheless presented him with a significant problem, blocking the main route into Greece. However, a second route into central Greece was available. In 480 BC, during the Battle of Thermopylae, the Persian king Xerxes had sent his army via a mountain track (the Anopea) to outflank the pass. From this track, on the western side of Mount Kallidromon, another road led off and descended in Phocis. In 480 BC, a thousand Phocian troops were stationed above Thermopylae <b>to</b> <b>guard</b> the road and prevent a Persian assault on Phocis (though they notably failed to prevent the Persians using Anopea). However, in 339 BC, the Greeks had either forgotten the existence of this road, or believed that Philip would not use it; the subsequent failure <b>to</b> <b>guard</b> this road allowed Philip to slip into central Greece unhindered.|$|E
5|$|Between 1853 and 1862, {{there were}} a number of uprisings against the Brooke {{government}} but all were successfully contained with the aid of local tribes. <b>To</b> <b>guard</b> against future uprisings, a series of forts were constructed to protect Kuching, including Fort Margherita, completed in 1871.
