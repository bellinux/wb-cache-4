In June, WWE granted Kelly {{a period}} of time off, and she returned on Raw on August 6, defeating Eve in singles match. On September 28, Blank was released from her contract. In a December 2012 interview, Blank stated she needed time off to heal a neck injury, and had plans <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>model.</b>|$|E
5|$|Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were {{determined}} that their eldest son {{should have an}} education that would prepare him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> constitutional monarch. At age seven, Edward embarked on a rigorous educational programme devised by Prince Albert, and supervised by several tutors. Unlike his elder sister Victoria, Edward did not excel in his studies. He tried {{to meet the expectations}} of his parents, but to no avail. Although Edward was not a diligent student—his true talents were those of charm, sociability and tact—Benjamin Disraeli described him as informed, intelligent and of sweet manner. After the completion of his secondary-level studies, his tutor was replaced by a personal governor, Robert Bruce.|$|E
5|$|A Byzantine revival {{style of}} {{architecture}} {{occurred in the}} 19th and 20th centuries. An early example of the revival style in Russia was the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour (1839–84), which {{was approved by the}} Tsar <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> for other churches in the empire. The style's popularity spread through scholarly publications produced after the independence of Greece and the Balkans from the Ottoman Empire. It was used throughout Europe and North America, peaking in popularity between 1890 and 1914. The Greek Orthodox St Sophia's Cathedral (1877–79) and Roman Catholic Westminster Cathedral (begun 1895), both in London, are examples. The throne room of Neuschwanstein Castle (1885–86) was built by King Ludwig II in Bavaria. In the late 19th century, the Hagia Sophia became a widespread model for Greek Orthodox churches. In southeastern Europe, monumental national cathedrals built in the capital cities of formerly Ottoman areas used Neo-Classical or Neo-Byzantine styles. Sofia's Alexander Nevsky Cathedral and Belgrade's Church of Saint Sava are examples, and used Hagia Sophia as a model due to their large sizes. Synagogues in the United States were built in a variety of styles, as they had been in Europe (and often with a mixture of elements from different styles), but the Byzantine Revival style was the most popular in the 1920s. Domed examples include The Temple of Cleveland (1924), the synagogue of KAM Isaiah Israel (1924) in Chicago, based upon San Vitale in Ravenna and Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, and the synagogue of Congregation Emanu-El (1926) in San Francisco.|$|E

30|$|This example {{demonstrates}} {{the suitability of}} the sCMP class {{to serve as an}} exploratory tool for count data modeling. For over-dispersed data examples, the negative binomial distribution <b>is</b> generally expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good <b>model</b> <b>to</b> describe the distribution. The sCMP class of distributions contains the negative binomial (and geometric) distribution as a special case; accordingly, it is not necessarily expected for the sCMP distribution to outperform simpler distributions but rather to demonstrate that the sCMP distribution offers insights regarding model considerations. Indeed, applying the sCMP model to these over-dispersed examples motivated consideration of the geometric distribution, which turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> optimal <b>model.</b> Accordingly, while one may not consider the geometric distribution <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> viable <b>model</b> <b>a</b> priori, the sCMP showed why the geometric model is viable.|$|R

25|$|In 1929, Weissmuller {{signed a}} {{contract}} with BVD <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> and representative. He traveled throughout the country doing swim shows, handing out leaflets promoting that brand of swimwear, signing autographs and going on radio. In that same year, he made his first motion picture appearance as an Adonis, wearing only a fig leaf, in a movie entitled Glorifying the American Girl. He appeared as himself in the first of several Crystal Champions movie shorts featuring Weissmuller and other Olympic champions at Silver Springs, Florida. He co-starred with Esther Williams in Billy Rose's Aquacade during the New York World's Fair 1939–41, pursuing her for two years.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the colonial}} era, South Carolina's {{politicians}} {{had dreamed of}} an inland waterway system that would not only aid commerce, but also control flooding. By the 1930s, Byrnes took up the cause for a massive dam-building project, Santee Cooper, that would not only accomplish those tasks but also electrify the entire state with hydroelectric power. With South Carolina financially strapped by the Great Depression, Senator Byrnes {{managed to get the}} federal government to authorize a loan for the entire project, which was completed and put into operation in February 1942. The loan was later paid back to the federal government with full interest and at no cost to South Carolina taxpayers. Santee Cooper has continued <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> for public-owned electrical utilities worldwide.|$|E

30|$|As {{highlighted}} by [6] {{there are two}} main modeling streams in energy forecasting. In one stream <b>a</b> single big <b>model</b> <b>is</b> fitted <b>to</b> hourly process Y_t and this ‘high-frequency’ time series is forecasted many hours ahead using a recursive forecasting approach. The alternative approach, is based on the consideration of 24 single model equations, for each hour separately. These 24 single models may be interrelated or span <b>a</b> (fully) multivariate <b>model.</b> Here each hour is forecasted separately. We refer the first high-frequent approach <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> univariate <b>modeling</b> framework, and the second one <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> multivariate <b>modeling</b> framework as in [6].|$|R
25|$|Brownson {{had also}} been writing many {{articles}} for the Paulist Fathers Catholic World publication. Brownson now saw Catholicism as the only religion that could restrain the undisciplined American citizens and thus ensure the success of democracy. To him, America was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> to the world, and the ideal model was a Catholic America. He repudiated his earlier Fourierist and Owenite ideas, now criticizing socialism and utopianism as vigorously as he had once promoted them. A staunch Douglas Democrat, Brownson, like Douglas, supported the Union in the Civil War and polemicized against the Confederacy and against Catholic clergy who endorsed secession. He avidly supported emancipation and even made several trips to Washington to discuss the importance and urgency of emancipation with President Lincoln. He also encouraged all Americans, especially Catholics, to be patriots in the country’s time of turmoil.|$|E
25|$|Argentina, {{which had}} been {{considered}} by the IMF <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> country in its compliance to policy proposals by the Bretton Woods institutions, experienced a catastrophic economic crisis in 2001, which some believe to {{have been caused by}} IMF-induced budget restrictions—which undercut the government's ability to sustain national infrastructure even in crucial areas such as health, education, and security—and privatisation of strategically vital national resources. Others attribute the crisis to Argentina's misdesigned fiscal federalism, which caused subnational spending to increase rapidly. The crisis added to widespread hatred of this institution in Argentina and other South American countries, with many blaming the IMF for the region's economic problems. The current—as of early 2006—trend toward moderate left-wing governments in the region and a growing concern with the development of a regional economic policy largely independent of big business pressures has been ascribed to this crisis.|$|E

500|$|The {{commercial}} {{success of the}} series was in part because each painting is considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> of understandable art by the general public.

This understandability made it one extreme {{on the scale of}} artistic complexity when comparing the series to contemporaneous art. [...] It was diametrically opposed to abstract art and far removed from the intrigue of surrealism.|$|E
