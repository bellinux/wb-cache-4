50|$|Coventry Blaze {{were always}} going to be <b>tough,</b> <b>too,</b> so Marple set about signing some big name players himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "True," [...] said Harold; [...] "and {{had that}} tree not grown where it stands, and grown <b>tough,</b> <b>too,</b> I suspect {{he would have}} made short work of Antonio too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{they intend}} to starve me into surrender," [...] he thought; [...] "but they won't succeed so long as my tablets hold out. And if, in time, they should starve me, I'll be <b>too</b> thin and <b>tough</b> to make good eating; so I'll {{get the best of}} them, anyhow." ...|$|R
5|$|As {{leaders in}} the punk rock scene, the Ramones' music has usually been {{identified}} with that label, while some have defined their characteristic style more specifically as pop punk and others as power pop. In the 1980s, the band sometimes veered into hardcore punk territory, as can be heard on <b>Too</b> <b>Tough</b> to Die.|$|E
5|$|<b>Too</b> <b>Tough</b> to Die {{was also}} the first of three studio albums that were {{licensed}} from Sire Records to the independent record label Beggars Banquet Records for release in the UK. The deal saw the group's work promoted better and resulted placings on the UK album and singles charts. The group had not charted in the UK since 1980's End of the Century.|$|E
5|$|Previous Ramones records {{featured}} celebrity record {{producers in}} an attempt to gain some sort of popularity. Since this method did not yield the results which they were expecting, Sire Records contacted the producers of 1978's Road to Ruin: Ed Stasium and ex-band member Tommy Ramone. <b>Too</b> <b>Tough</b> to Die has less production value than previous recordings by the Ramones. Because critics often disapproved of the sound quality on End of the Century and Pleasant Dreams, the band leaned towards a harsher sound.|$|E
5000|$|Selfless in {{character}} and humanitarian at heart, Ponty Chadha thrived on his vision {{to make it}} big {{in the world at}} a mere age of 15 years. Understanding the business of life, he struck a chord with his partners <b>too.</b> He was <b>tough</b> but compassionate, disciplined yet flexible, stubborn still humble ? ...|$|R
5|$|Continuation Bond author Raymond Benson sees Vivienne Michel as {{the best}} {{realised}} female characterisation undertaken by Fleming, partly because {{the story is told}} in the first person narrative. Academic Jeremy Black notes that Michel is the closest Fleming gets to kitchen sink realism in the Bond canon: she has been a victim of life in the past, but is wilful and <b>tough,</b> <b>too.</b>|$|R
50|$|The sisters start feuding, {{and their}} quarrell affects {{the rest of}} the family. Their visiting wealthy uncle Daniel notices. The campaigning gets <b>tougher</b> <b>too,</b> and Jimmy gains a lot of {{popularity}} from Betty's great speeches on his behalf. Freddie finally decides to use his show talent to help him win, and Betty is bought back on the right side with a new sweater.|$|R
5|$|Punk bands such as Screeching Weasel, the Vindictives, the Queers, Parasites, the Mr. T Experience, Boris the Sprinkler, Beatnik Termites, Tip Toppers, Jon Cougar Concentration Camp, McRackins, and Kobanes have {{recorded}} cover versions of entire Ramones albums—Ramones, Leave Home, Rocket to Russia, It's Alive, Road to Ruin, End of the Century, Pleasant Dreams, Subterranean Jungle, {{two versions of}} <b>Too</b> <b>Tough</b> to Die, and Halfway To Sanity respectively. The Huntingtons' File Under Ramones consists of Ramones covers from across the band's history.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes may {{compete with}} striped hyenas on large carcasses. Red foxes may {{give way to}} hyenas on unopened carcasses, as the latter's {{stronger}} jaws can easily tear open flesh that is <b>too</b> <b>tough</b> for foxes. Foxes may harass hyenas, using their smaller size and greater speed to avoid the hyena's attacks. Sometimes, foxes seem to deliberately torment hyenas even {{when there is no}} food at stake. Some foxes may mistime their attacks, and are killed. Fox remains are often found in hyena dens, and hyenas may steal foxes from traps.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} members of its genus, C.cinnabarinum is {{generally}} considered inedible by field guides. Because the fruit bodies begin development underground, they are <b>too</b> <b>tough</b> for consumption {{by the time they}} are visible, and their appearance may be considered unappetizing. A study of the cultural practices of mestizo descendants of the Otomi people in Tenango de Doria, Mexico, reported that immature specimens of C.cinnabarinum, known locally as yemitas, were frequently eaten raw in the past, especially by children. Consumption of the species was no longer commonplace, with only five of the 450 locals interviewed familiar with the practice. The gleba of C.cinnabarinum has been described as having a mild taste and, despite a local recollection to the contrary, is not sweet. C.cinnabarinum has also been used in traditional medicine. A 1986 ethnomycological study of native traditions in Veracruz identified this use of huang noono, which locals roasted, then consumed as a powder with mineral water to treat gastrointestinal distress. Unlike these Mexican traditions, Hunan folk beliefs hold that the mushroom is poisonous on account of its bright color.|$|E
5000|$|Henery piques Foghorn's curiosity {{by trying}} to secure a {{catapult}} with a large pumpkin on it. Foghorn helps Henery by securing the catapult for him, and as he walks away Henery launches the pumpkin at Foghorn, which hits him in the head. Henery tells Foghorn {{that he wants to}} capture him for dinner. Playing along, Foghorn replies that he is <b>too</b> old and <b>tough</b> to be used for dinner.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not much {{to speak}} on," [...] coolly {{answered}} the son, still gazing {{in the direction}} of the woods. [...] "A little stunned, but he's gettin' over it fast, and he's used to sich rubs. Father's desp'rate solid about the head, and can stand as much sledgehammering there, as any man I ever seed. Tobit's <b>tough,</b> <b>too,</b> in that part; and he's need of it, for he's forever getting licks around the forehead and eyes." ...|$|R
6000|$|And oh! that {{quickening}} of the heart, that beat! [...] How much {{it costs}} us! yet each rising throb [...] Is in its cause as its effect so sweet, [...] That Wisdom, ever on the watch to rob [...] Joy of its alchemy, and to repeat [...] Fine truths; even Conscience, <b>too,</b> has a <b>tough</b> job [...] To make us understand each good old maxim, [...] So good--I wonder Castlereagh don't tax 'em.|$|R
5|$|It’s straightforward, heartfelt and classy. Mariah pleads {{with her}} {{departed}} lover – 'When you left I lost {{a part of}} me / It’s still so hard to believe' – and the song’s gentle R roll is perfectly understated, built from a few piano chords and a slowed-down So So Def rhythm. It has a homebody quality, almost like an autumn song would – you can imagine a split-up couple singing it quietly, separately, as the world goes on around them. She’s on a porch with tea; he’s stuck in traffic when he finds Mariah on the radio. It even cleverly references that feel, with Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface songs on her radio just <b>too</b> <b>tough</b> to hear. There’s no tired 'I tried to 2-way you' retorts, no trash-technology love affair 'I was at the grocery store and this guy had the same ring tone as you, and I cried.' No, there’s a classic sensibility to the lyrics and sound of 'We Belong Together' that makes for perfect – and perfectly universal – pop/R songwriting. In other words, it’s the jam. And there’s probably a happy ending, too: Mariah’s triumphant octave shift finale makes the song’s title an emphatic.|$|E
25|$|<b>Too</b> <b>Tough</b> to Care is an 18-minute {{educational}} film produced in 1964 to undermine teenage resistance to anti-smoking education. Unlike other films in its genre, <b>Too</b> <b>Tough</b> to Care used satire and humor {{to illustrate the}} misleading claims of cigarette advertising. The film garnered attention in both the mainstream press as well as academic journals.|$|E

50|$|The authors {{traveled}} to 13 countries to taste insects. The book talks about eating insects {{and how to}} harvest them. The insects in the book include Theraphosa blondi (a bird-eating tarantula), jumil stinkbugs, witchetty grub, and silkworms. Faith recommends {{that people who are}} new to insect eating start with insects that crisp up well when roasted and avoiding things like worms, which are too chewy, or cicadas, which are <b>too</b> fleshy and <b>tough.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} Type 128 prototype {{was based}} on the full-length Kübelwagen chassis with a 240 cm (7.9 ft) wheelbase. Pre-production units of the 128, fitted with custom welded bodytubs, demonstrated that this construction was <b>too</b> weak for <b>tough</b> off-roading, had insufficient torsional rigidity, and easily suffered hull-ruptures at the front cross-member, {{as well as in the}} wheel-wells. This was unacceptable for an amphibious vehicle. The large-scale production models (Type 166) were therefore made smaller, and had a wheel-base of only 200 cm (6.6 ft).|$|R
60|$|And now {{one word}} as to English inns. I {{do not think}} that we Englishmen have any great right to be proud of them. The worst about them is that they {{deteriorate}} from year to year, instead of becoming better. We used to hear much of the comfort of the old English wayside inn, but the old English wayside inn has gone. The railway hotel has taken its place; and the railway hotel is too frequently gloomy, desolate, comfortless, and almost suicidal. In England, too, since the old days are gone, there are wanting the landlord's bow and the kindly smile of his stout wife. Who now knows the landlord of an inn, or cares to inquire whether or no there be a landlady? The old welcome is wanting; and the cheery, warm air, which used to atone for the bad port and tough beef, has passed away--while the port is still bad and the beef <b>too</b> often <b>tough.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Too</b> <b>Tough</b> To Care was {{produced}} by the Marin County Medical Society, funded partly {{by a grant from}} the California Medical Association, and distributed by Sid Davis Productions. The British Film Institute lists the director as Dave Parker, the production company as Lawren Productions, and the sponsor as the American Heart Association.|$|E
25|$|The Qin army led {{a direct}} {{invasion}} into Wei by besieging its capital Daliang but {{soon realized that}} the city walls were <b>too</b> <b>tough</b> to break into. They devised a new strategy in which they utilized {{the power of a}} local river that was linked to the Yellow River. The river was used to flood the city's walls, causing massive devastation to the city. Upon realizing the situation, King Jia of Wei hurriedly came out of the capital and surrendered it to the Qin army in order to avoid further bloodshed of his people.|$|E
25|$|At the 2003 African Junior Championships he won {{a bronze}} medal in the 100 metres and the 200 metres gold medal. In August Saidy competed at his first World Championships, still only 19 years old. The {{competition}} in the 2003 World Championships in Paris proved <b>too</b> <b>tough,</b> as Saidy once again failed to reach the second round. With 21.42 seconds, he finished sixth out of seven in a heat where eventual silver medalist Darvis Patton, among others, ran. Saidy did however have the fastest reaction time in his heat with 0.128 seconds.|$|E
60|$|I looked back. Old Marrow-Bone, deserted and far behind, was tottering silently {{along in}} his {{handicapped}} race with death. Sometimes he almost fell, {{and once he}} did fall; but no more arrows were coming. He scrambled weakly to his feet. Age burdened him heavily, {{but he did not}} want to die. The three Fire-Men, who were now running forward from their forest ambush, could easily have got him, but they did not try. Perhaps he was <b>too</b> old and <b>tough.</b> But they did want the Hairless One and my sister, for as I looked back from the trees I could see the Fire-Men beating in their heads with rocks. One of the Fire-Men was the wizened old hunter who limped.|$|R
50|$|M. {{modiolus}} {{is found}} growing on hard substrates including shells and stones and the byssus threads of other mussels. Survival rates of young individuals are low {{but by the}} time they reach about 4 cm long, at an age of 4 years, individuals are <b>too</b> large and <b>tough</b> to be predated upon by starfish such as Asterias rubens, the whelk Buccinum undatum and crabs. Juveniles growing on byssus threads are more likely to survive than free living individuals and this results in the formation of cold-water reefs of mussels. These mostly occur in locations with fairly strong currents. The species is tolerant of low levels of oxygen and of a diminished quantity of the phytoplankton on which they feed. The boring sponge Cliona celata sometimes damages the shells of older individuals.|$|R
6000|$|Having uttered {{this brief}} but sententious {{account of his}} view of the matter at issue, the chief resumed his seat, {{reasonably}} well satisfied with this, his second attempt to be eloquent that day. His success this time was not as unequivocal as on the former occasion, but it was respectable. Several of the chiefs saw a reasonable, if not a very logical analogy, between a man's name and his mind; and to them it appeared a tolerably fair inference that a man should act up to his name. If his name was tough, he ought to be <b>tough,</b> <b>too.</b> In this it does not strike us that they argued very differently from civilized beings, who are only too apt to do that which their better judgments really condemn, because they think they are acting [...] "in character," [...] as it is termed.|$|R
25|$|In 1996 the Terra {{publishing}} house in Russia started a 30 volume Leskov series, declaring {{the intention to}} include every single work or letter by the author, but by 2007 only 10 volumes of it had come out. The Literaturnoye nasledstvo publishers started the Unpublished Leskov series: book one (fiction) came out in 1991, book two (letters and articles) – in 2000; both were incomplete, and the volume six material, which had been banned a century ago and proved to be <b>too</b> <b>tough</b> for the Soviet censors, was again neglected. All 36 volumes of the 1902 Marks Complete Leskov were re-issued in 2002 and Moshkov's On-line Library gathered {{a significant part of}} Leskov's legacy, including his most controversial novels and essays.|$|E
25|$|The careful {{methods of}} PAVN forces are {{illustrated}} in the successful attack against the US Air Force's TACAN radar navigation facility in Laos (Lima Site 85), in March 1968. Situated on a mountain peak that was considered <b>too</b> <b>tough</b> to assault, the facilities were manned by a small force of USAF technicians on top, and about 1,000 Hmong and Thai irregulars deployed further down the slopes. NVA commandos however successfully climbed the mountain, killing or dispersing most of the guards and US airmen at the peak, while a larger follow-on echelon of NVA and Pathet Lao assaulted {{the rest of the}} mountain slopes below. The outgunned and outnumbered Hmong and Thai irregulars were defeated, and Communist forces held the site despite several days under counterattack by US aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, {{marked the}} first summer Olympics {{featuring}} the independent Croatia, and Petrović {{was the leader of}} the Croatian national basketball team at the Olympic basketball tournament. Losing only to the American Dream Team in group stage, a strong and inspired Croatian team emerged victorious from the Semifinals against the revamped Soviet team, thanks to clutch free throws executed by Petrović, and faced off against the Americans for the gold. Urged on by Petrović's competitiveness and confidence, the Croatians fared well in the first ten minutes of the game, taking a 25–23 lead on a Franjo Arapović dunk and the subsequent free throw. As the game progressed, however, the now-legendary team composed of NBA stars proved <b>too</b> <b>tough</b> for Croatia: the Americans won 117–85, sending Petrović, the game's leading scorer with 24 points, and his teammates, home with silver medals.|$|E
5000|$|... would {{probably}} {{do the most}} to influence {{the events of the}} next decade 1997-2007, not only for Kaupthing but for the whole financial market in Iceland ... his prior experience at Islandsbanki and Danske Bank gave him prestige in the company. His fluent Danish also gave us an advantage later, when we expanded into the Nordic countries ... Short and stockily built, squint-eyed, with an ever-receding hairline, Sigurdur resembled {{nothing so much as a}} young Winston Churchill. He was <b>tough</b> <b>too,</b> but he kept his friends close ... Far from being a micro manager, he tended to give the younger people a lot of freedom and responsibility. Known to exaggerate numbers, he once famously answered the question ‘how many people live in Iceland?’ with ‘less than a million’ - the population was slightly more than 250,000 at the time. This bullish hyper-confidence set him apart from the rest of us - in the beginning, he was the only one of us who really did have a boundless imagination about what we could do.|$|R
5000|$|Benatar's The Second Sexism: Discrimination Against Men and Boys (2012) {{has been}} met with controversy: The philosopher Simon Blackburn writes: [...] "Benatar knows that such {{examples}} {{are likely to}} meet snorts of disbelief or derision, but he is careful to back up his claims with empirical data, and as a philosopher he is especially careful both about the interpretation of evidence {{and the use of}} terms such as [...] "discrimination". ... I do not at all doubt that there is a case to be made for the recognition of a second sexism, nor that Benatar makes it well. And it is not as if he himself is taking sides in these invidious comparisons. He is not a participant in the sex wars but a peacemaker who wants them to wind down. All that he aims to show is that if it is all <b>too</b> often <b>tough</b> being a woman, it is also sometimes tough being a man, and that any failure to recognise this risks distorting what should be everyone's goal, namely universal sympathy as well as social justice for all, regardless of gender." [...] The philosopher Iddo Landau writes: [...] "Benatar suggests that in order to cope with the hitherto ignored second sexism we should not only acknowledge it but also dedicate much more empirical and philosophical research to this under-explored topic and, of course, try to change many attitudes, social norms, and laws. / This is a very well-argued book that presents an unorthodox thesis and defends it ably. It would be a useful text in both undergraduate and graduate courses in philosophy and gender studies, where it is certain to arouse a lot of discussion, much of it excited. ... Most importantly ... it is likely to change our understanding of gender relations." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Mi Chico Latino" [...] {{was directed by}} Doug Nichol and filmed in Sardinia from 5-8 July 1999. Halliwell wanted the video for the song to be very different in style to her previous single [...] "Look At Me", as that one was filmed in Prague in the freezing cold, and she wanted something to connect with her fans. According to her, the video was also pretty easy to get: [...] "a yacht, {{a girl in a}} bikini and some sexy boy dancers to keep both sets of fans [...] happy". After the video was released, the singer got a huge amount of attention from it. [...] "People {{came up to me and}} told me how great and how sexy it was. They also told me I looked really healthy, but how wrong they were. I wasn't healthy because I wasn't eating properly and although I was slim at the time, that was a mirage <b>too</b> because the <b>tough</b> regime of the diet was always going to lead me to binge and put the weight back on", and later, she began taking recovery meetings for bulimia.|$|R
