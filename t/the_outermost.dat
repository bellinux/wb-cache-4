5|$|As a simple, visible surface polyhedron, {{the outward}} {{form of the}} final stellation is {{composed}} of 180 triangular faces, which are <b>the</b> <b>outermost</b> triangular regions in the stellation diagram.

3000|$|... 2 − anions are situated. To {{examine this}} property, we have {{performed}} supplementary geometry optimization calculations of undoped CNT(3, 3), CNT(5, 5), and GR clusters. As the calculations showed, removal of <b>the</b> two <b>outermost</b> carbon rings from both edges of CNT(3, 3) and CNT(5, 5) clusters (or <b>the</b> two <b>outermost</b> carbon “strips” from GR cluster) changes the C-C distances {{in the central}} regions of clusters within 0.3 %. Such slight changes ensure a negligible influence of the cluster edges on the calculated adsorption geometries. Consequently, the selected sizes of clusters were considered optimal, as larger clusters require more CPU time.|$|R
5|$|Histological {{analysis}} of the lines of arrested growth within the tibiae from the various ontogenetic stages of Limusaurus indicates that the animal was skeletally mature at six years in age. In older specimens, <b>the</b> <b>outermost</b> lines of arrested growth are very close together (forming {{what is known as}} the external fundamental system), indicating that rapid growth had ceased in these particular individuals.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius fallax is {{classified}} in the section Plinthogalus of the subgenus Plinthogalus of the genus Lactarius. Species in this section have brown to blackish caps, and a cap cuticle that contains a dissolved brown pigment. The cuticle of most species is of the trichoderm type—where <b>the</b> <b>outermost</b> hyphae emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface.|$|E
5|$|Like other groups, {{the members}} of this family show {{patterns}} in their electron configurations, especially <b>the</b> <b>outermost</b> shells, resulting in trends in chemical behavior. However, lawrencium is an exception, since its last electron is transferred to the 7p1/2 subshell due to relativistic effects.|$|E

Our proof is local and extends to hyper-normalization and weakly orthogonal systems. Based on the new proof, we study basic normalization, i. e., we study normalization if the set of considered starting terms is restricted to basic terms. This allows us to weaken the left-normality restriction. We show that <b>the</b> leftmost <b>outermost</b> strategy is hyper-normalizing for basically left-normal orthogonal rewrite systems. This shift of focus greatly extends {{the applicability of the}} classical result, as evidenced by the experimental data provided...|$|R

5|$|Order Heteronemertea. Comprises about 400 species. The {{majority}} are marine, but three are freshwater. Their body-wall muscles are disposed in four layers, alternately circular and length-wise starting from <b>the</b> <b>outermost</b> layer. The order includes the strongest swimmers. Two genera have branched proboscises.|$|E
5|$|Rhodium {{belongs to}} group 9 of the {{periodic}} table, but {{the configuration of}} electrons in <b>the</b> <b>outermost</b> shells is atypical for the group. This anomaly is also observed in the neighboring elements, niobium (41), ruthenium (44), and palladium (46).|$|E

50|$|Exfoliation {{involves}} {{the removal of}} the oldest dead skin cells on <b>the</b> skin's <b>outermost</b> surface. Exfoliation is involved in the process of all facials, during microdermabrasion or chemical peels. Exfoliation can be achieved through mechanical or chemical means.|$|R
5|$|The mantle edge secretes a shell (secondarily {{absent in}} a number of taxonomic groups, such as the nudibranchs) that {{consists}} of mainly chitin and conchiolin (a protein hardened with calcium carbonate), except <b>the</b> <b>outermost</b> layer in almost all cases is all conchiolin (see periostracum). Molluscs never use phosphate to construct their hard parts, with the questionable exception of Cobcrephora.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>outermost</b> {{layer of}} the body has no cuticle but {{consists}} of a ciliated and glandular epithelium containing rhabdites, which form the mucus in which the cilia glide. Each ciliated cell has many cilia and microvilli. <b>The</b> <b>outermost</b> layer rests on a thickened basement membrane, the dermis. Next to the dermis {{are at least three}} layers of muscles, some circular and some longitudinal. The combinations of muscle types vary between the different classes, but these are not associated with differences in movement. Nemerteans also have dorso-ventral muscles, which flatten the animals, especially in the larger species. Inside the concentric tubes of these layers is mesenchyme, a kind of connective tissue. In pelagic species this tissue is gelatinous and buoyant.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>outermost</b> {{zone of the}} {{adrenal cortex}} is the zona glomerulosa. It lies {{immediately}} under the fibrous capsule of the gland. Cells in this layer form oval groups, separated by thin strands of connective tissue from the fibrous capsule of the gland and carry wide capillaries.|$|E
50|$|Since the two {{stations}} the HH served {{were just}} three blocks apart in distance, it was discontinued on June 1, 1946. Since then, <b>the</b> two <b>outermost</b> tracks and island platforms of Hoyt-Schermerhorn Streets {{have not been}} used in revenue service.|$|R
