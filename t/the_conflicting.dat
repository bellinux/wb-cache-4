40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to pull apart the {{narratives}} used by Yemeni, Saudi and Iranian news agencies concerning <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> in Yemen, {{in order to understand}} how <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> is framed by these agencies. In approaching the research question; How do the contending narratives of Saudi, Iranian, and Yemeni news agencies frame <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> in Yemen between March 2015 and May 2016 ?, this thesis identifies and analyses the narratives each of these agencies use to portray <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> in Yemen, using a theoretical framework built around the concept of framing to analyse how each agency places blame, proposes solutions, and positions their country within <b>the</b> <b>conflict,</b> through <b>the</b> concepts and language they use to create their narratives. The analysis seeks to understand each agency’s stance towards <b>the</b> <b>conflict,</b> and analyse how this is perpetuated by their news coverage in order to further justify their understanding of, and intended outcome for, <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> in Yemen. By outlining the role that the narratives in the media play in shaping the audience’s attitude, this thesis highlights the relevance of identifying and analysing how such narratives are framed. Rather than aiming to uncover facts, or truths, about <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> in Yemen, its relevance lies in the result of highlighting and analysing the claims made by these news agencies, thus identifying points of contention between them and serving as an alternative perspective through which to understand the battle of words and ideas that is taking place surrounding <b>the</b> <b>conflict.</b> An awareness of the framing processes used to shape contending understandings of <b>the</b> <b>conflict,</b> and <b>the</b> solutions they propose, will allow a more critical overview of <b>the</b> <b>conflict</b> as it unfolds.

King states that Gaudapada's main work, Māṇḍukya Kārikā, is infused with philosophical terminology of Buddhism, and uses Buddhist arguments and analogies. King also suggests that there are clear differences between Shankara's writings and the Brahmasutra, and many ideas of Shankara are at odds with those in the Upanishads. Radhakrishnan, on the other hand, suggests that Shankara's views of Advaita were straightforward developments of the Upanishads and the Brahmasutra, and many ideas of Shankara derive from the Upanishads.|$|E

5|$|Animals may avoid {{becoming}} prey {{by living}} {{out of sight of}} predators, whether in caves, underground, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between <b>the</b> <b>conflicting</b> demands.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, Griffiths {{focused on the}} {{inconsistent}} portrayal of Horus and Set as brothers and as uncle and nephew. He argued that, {{in the early stages}} of Egyptian mythology, the struggle between Horus and Set as siblings and equals was originally separate from the murder of Osiris. The two stories were joined into the single Osiris myth sometime before the writing of the Pyramid Texts. With this merging, the genealogy of the deities involved and the characterization of the Horus–Set conflict were altered so that Horus is the son and heir avenging Osiris's death. Traces of the independent traditions remained in <b>the</b> <b>conflicting</b> characterizations of the combatants' relationship and in texts unrelated to the Osiris myth, which make Horus the son of the goddess Nut or the goddess Hathor rather than of Isis and Osiris. Griffiths therefore rejected the possibility that Osiris's murder was rooted in historical events. This hypothesis has been accepted by more recent scholars such as Jan Assmann and George Hart.|$|E
5|$|Senior project {{engineer}} Ralph Hooper at Hawker promptly set about establishing an initial layout for a theoretical aircraft {{to take advantage}} of the Pegasus engine, using data provided by Bristol. This proposed aircraft soon received the internal designation P.1127.

The switch from a single tailpipe meant that the initial tailwheel undercarriage could also be discarded in favour a conventional nose wheel-led undercarriage. The design process extended throughout 1958, being financed entirely by Hawker, while approaches were made to NATO headquarters to better establish the tactical requirements sought, particularly between <b>the</b> <b>conflicting</b> demands for a lightly armed supersonic fighter and a simpler multipurpose subsonic one.|$|E
