Thus was th' applause they meant, [...] Turnd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame [...] Cast on themselves from thir own mouths. There stood [...] A Grove hard by, sprung up with this thir change, [...] His will who reigns above, to aggravate [...] Thir penance, laden with fair Fruit, like that [...] VVhich grew in Paradise, the bait of EVE [...] Us'd by the Tempter: on that prospect strange [...] Thir earnest eyes they fix'd, imagining [...] For one forbidden Tree a multitude [...] Now ris'n, to work them furder woe or shame; [...] Yet parcht with scalding <b>thurst</b> and hunger fierce, [...] Though to delude them sent, could not abstain, [...] But on they rould in heaps, and up the Trees [...] Climbing, sat thicker then the snakie locks [...] That curld MEGAERA: greedily they pluck'd [...] The Frutage fair to sight, like that which grew [...] Neer that bituminous Lake where SODOM flam'd; [...] This more delusive, not the touch, but taste [...] Deceav'd; they fondly thinking to allay [...] Thir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit [...] Chewd bitter Ashes, which th' offended taste [...] VVith spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd, [...] Hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft, [...] VVith hatefullest disrelish writh'd thir jaws [...] VVith foot and cinders fill'd; so oft they fell [...] Into the same illusion, not as Man [...] Whom they triumph'd once lapst.

[...] For still they knew, and ought to have still remember'd [...] The high Injunction not to taste that Fruit, [...] Whoever tempted; which they not obeying, [...] Incurr'd, what could they less, the penaltie, [...] And manifold in sin, deserv'd to fall. [...] Up into Heav'n from Paradise in hast [...] Th' Angelic Guards ascended, mute and sad [...] For Man, for of his state by this they knew, [...] Much wondring how the suttle Fiend had stoln [...] 20 [...] Entrance unseen. Soon as th' unwelcome news [...] From Earth arriv'd at Heaven Gate, displeas'd [...] All were who heard, dim sadness did not spare [...] That time Celestial visages, yet mixt [...] With pitie, violated not thir bliss. [...] About the new-arriv'd, in multitudes [...] Th' ethereal People ran, to hear and know [...] How all befell: they towards the Throne Supream [...] Accountable made haste to make appear [...] With righteous plea, thir utmost vigilance, [...] 30 [...] And easily approv'd; when the most High [...] Eternal Father from his secret Cloud, [...] Amidst in Thunder utter'd thus his voice. [...] Assembl'd Angels, and ye Powers return'd [...] From unsuccessful charge, be not dismaid, [...] Nor troubl'd at these tidings from the Earth, [...] Which your sincerest care could not prevent, [...] Foretold so lately what would come to pass, [...] When first this Tempter cross'd the Gulf from Hell. [...] I told ye then he should prevail and speed [...] 40 [...] On his bad Errand, Man should be seduc't [...] And flatter'd out of all, believing lies [...] Against his Maker; no Decree of mine [...] Concurring to necessitate his Fall, [...] Or touch with lightest moment of impulse [...] His free Will, to her own inclining left [...] In eevn scale. But fall'n he is, and now [...] What rests, but that the mortal Sentence pass [...] On his transgression, Death denounc't that day, [...] Which he presumes already vain and void, [...] 50 [...] Because not yet inflicted, as he fear'd, [...] By some immediate stroak; but soon shall find [...] Forbearance no acquittance ere day end. [...] Justice shall not return as bountie scorn'd. [...] But whom send I to judge them? whom but thee [...] Vicegerent Son, to thee I have transferr'd [...] All Judgement, whether in Heav'n, or Earth; or Hell. [...] Easie it may be seen that I intend [...] Mercie collegue with Justice, sending thee [...] Mans Friend, his Mediator, his design'd [...] 60 [...] Both Ransom and Redeemer voluntarie, [...] And destin'd Man himself to judge Man fall'n. [...] So spake the Father, and unfoulding bright [...] Toward the right hand his Glorie, on the Son [...] Blaz'd forth unclouded Deitie; he full [...] Resplendent all his Father manifest [...] Express'd, and thus divinely answer'd milde. [...] Father Eternal, thine is to decree, [...] Mine both in Heav'n and Earth to do thy will [...] Supream, that thou in mee thy Son belov'd [...] 70 [...] Mayst ever rest well pleas'd. I go to judge [...] On Earth these thy transgressors, but thou knowst, [...] Whoever judg'd, the worst on mee must light, [...] When time shall be, for so I undertook [...] Before thee; and not repenting, this obtaine [...] Of right, that I may mitigate thir doom [...] On me deriv'd, yet I shall temper so [...] Justice with Mercie, as may illustrate most [...] Them fully satisfied, and thee appease. [...] Attendance none shall need, nor Train, where none [...] 80 [...] Are to behold the Judgement, but the judg'd, [...] Those two; the third best absent is condemn'd, [...] Convict by flight, and Rebel to all Law [...] Conviction to the Serpent none belongs. [...] Thus saying, from his radiant Seat he rose [...] Of high collateral glorie: him Thrones and Powers, [...] Princedoms, and Dominations ministrant [...] Accompanied to Heaven Gate, from whence [...] Eden and all the Coast in prospect lay. [...] Down he descended strait; the speed of Gods [...] 90 [...] Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes wing'd. [...] Now was the Sun in Western cadence low [...] From Noon, and gentle Aires due at thir hour [...] To fan the Earth now wak'd, and usher in [...] The Eevning coole when he from wrauth more coole [...] Came the mild Judge and Intercessor both [...] To sentence Man: the voice of God they heard [...] Now walking in the Garden, by soft windes [...] Brought to thir Ears, while day declin'd, they heard [...] And from his presence hid themselves among [...] 100 [...] The thickest Trees, both Man and Wife, till God [...] Approaching, thus to Adam call'd aloud. [...] Where art thou Adam, wont with joy to meet [...] My coming seen far off? I miss thee here, [...] Not pleas'd, thus entertaind with solitude, [...] Where obvious dutie erewhile appear'd unsaught: [...] Or come I less conspicuous, or what change [...] Absents thee, or what chance detains? Come forth. [...] He came, and with him Eve, more loth, though first [...] To offend, discount'nanc't both, and discompos'd; [...] 110 [...] Love was not in thir looks, either to God [...] Or to each other, but apparent guilt, [...] And shame, and perturbation, and despaire, [...] Anger, and obstinacie, and hate, and guile. [...] Whence Adam faultring long, thus answer'd brief. [...] I heard thee in the Garden, and of thy voice [...] Affraid, being naked, hid my self. To whom [...] The gracious Judge without revile repli'd. [...] My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not fear'd, [...] But still rejoyc't, how is it now become [...] 120 [...] So dreadful to thee? that thou art naked, who [...] Hath told thee? hast thou eaten of the Tree [...] Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat? [...] To whom thus Adam sore beset repli'd. [...] O Heav'n! in evil strait this day I stand [...] Before my Judge, either to undergoe [...] My self the total Crime, or to accuse [...] My other self, the partner of my life; [...] Whose failing, while her Faith to me remaines, [...] I should conceal, and not expose to blame [...] 130 [...] By my complaint; but strict necessitie [...] Subdues me, and calamitous constraint, [...] Least on my head both sin and punishment, [...] However insupportable, be all [...] Devolv'd; though should I hold my peace, yet thou [...] Wouldst easily detect what I conceale. [...] This Woman whom thou mad'st to be my help, [...] And gav'st me as thy perfet gift, so good, [...] So fit, so acceptable, so Divine, [...] That from her hand I could suspect no ill, [...] 140 [...] And what she did, whatever in it self, [...] Her doing seem'd to justifie the deed; [...] Shee gave me of the Tree, and I did eate. [...] To whom the sovran Presence thus repli'd. [...] Was shee thy God, that her thou didst obey [...] Before his voice, or was shee made thy guide, [...] Superior, or but equal, that to her [...] Thou did'st resigne thy Manhood, and the Place [...] Wherein God set thee above her made of thee, [...] And for thee, whose perfection farr excell'd [...] 150 [...] Hers in all real dignitie: Adornd [...] She was indeed, and lovely to attract [...] Thy Love, not thy Subjection, and her Gifts [...] Were such as under Government well seem'd, [...] Unseemly to beare rule, which was thy part [...] And person, had'st thou known thy self aright. [...] So having said, he thus to Eve in few: [...] Say Woman, what is this which thou hast done? [...] To whom sad Eve with shame nigh overwhelm'd, [...] Confessing soon, yet not before her Judge [...] 160 [...] Bold or loquacious, thus abasht repli'd. [...] The Serpent me beguil'd and I did eate. [...] Which when the Lord God heard, without delay [...] To Judgement he proceeded on th' accus'd [...] Serpent though brute, unable to transferre [...] The Guilt on him who made him instrument [...] Of mischief, and polluted from the end [...] Of his Creation; justly then accurst, [...] As vitiated in Nature: more to know [...] Concern'd not Man (since he no further knew) [...] 170 [...] Nor alter'd his offence; yet God at last [...] To Satan first in sin his doom apply'd, [...] Though in mysterious terms, judg'd as then best: [...] And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall. [...] Because thou hast done this, thou art accurst [...] Above all Cattel, each Beast of the Field; [...] Upon thy Belly groveling thou shalt goe, [...] And dust shalt eat all the days of thy Life. [...] Between Thee and the Woman I will put [...] Enmitie, and between thine and her Seed; [...] 180 [...] Her Seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel. [...] So spake this Oracle, then verifi'd [...] When Jesus son of Mary second Eve, [...] Saw Satan fall like Lightning down from Heav'n, [...] Prince of the Aire; then rising from his Grave [...] Spoild Principalities and Powers, triumpht [...] In open shew, and with ascention bright [...] Captivity led captive through the Aire, [...] The Realme it self of Satan long usurpt, [...] Whom he shall tread at last under our feet; [...] 190 [...] Eevn hee who now foretold his fatal bruise, [...] And to the Woman thus his Sentence turn'd. [...] Thy sorrow I will greatly multiplie [...] By thy Conception; Children thou shalt bring [...] In sorrow forth, and to thy Husbands will [...] Thine shall submit, hee over thee shall rule. [...] On Adam last thus judgement he pronounc'd. [...] Because thou hast heark'nd {{to the voice of}} thy Wife, [...] And eaten of the Tree concerning which [...] I charg'd thee, saying: Thou shalt not eate thereof, [...] 200 [...] Curs'd is the ground for thy sake, thou in sorrow [...] Shalt eate thereof all the days of thy Life; [...] Thornes also and Thistles it shall bring thee forth [...] Unbid, and thou shalt eate th' Herb of th' Field, [...] In the sweat of thy Face shalt thou eate Bread, [...] Till thou return unto the ground, for thou [...] Out of the ground wast taken, know thy Birth, [...] For dust thou art, and shalt to dust returne. [...] So judg'd he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent, [...] And th' instant stroke of Death denounc't that day [...] 210 [...] Remov'd farr off; then pittying how they stood [...] Before him naked to the aire, that now [...] Must suffer change, disdain'd not to begin [...] Thenceforth the forme of servant to assume, [...] As when he wash'd his servants feet, so now [...] As Father of his Familie he clad [...] Thir nakedness with Skins of Beasts, or slain, [...] Or as the Snake with youthful Coate repaid; [...] And thought not much to cloath his Enemies: [...] Nor hee thir outward onely with the Skins [...] 220 [...] Of Beasts, but inward nakedness, much more [...] Opprobrious, with his Robe of righteousness, [...] Araying cover'd from his Fathers sight. [...] To him with swift ascent he up returnd, [...] Into his blissful bosom reassum'd [...] In glory as of old, to him appeas'd [...] All, though all-knowing, what had past with Man [...] Recounted, mixing intercession sweet. [...] Meanwhile ere thus was sin'd and judg'd on Earth, [...] Within the Gates of Hell sate Sin and Death, [...] 230 [...] In counterview within the Gates, that now [...] Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame [...] Farr into Chaos, since the Fiend pass'd through, [...] Sin opening, who thus now to Death began. [...] O Son, why sit we here each other viewing [...] Idlely, while Satan our great Author thrives [...] In other Worlds, and happier Seat provides [...] For us his ofspring deare? It cannot be [...] But that success attends him; if mishap, [...] Ere this he had return'd, with fury driv'n [...] 240 [...] By his Avenger, since no place like this [...] Can fit his punishment, or their revenge. [...] Methinks I feel new strength within me rise, [...] Wings growing, and Dominion giv'n me large [...] Beyond this Deep; whatever drawes me on, [...] Or sympathie, or som connatural force [...] Powerful at greatest distance to unite [...] With secret amity things of like kinde [...] By secretest conveyance. Thou my Shade [...] Inseparable must with mee along: [...] 250 [...] For Death from Sin no power can separate. [...] But least the difficultie of passing back [...] Stay his returne perhaps over this Gulfe [...] Impassable, impervious, let us try [...] Adventrous work, yet to thy power and mine [...] Not unagreeable, to found a path [...] Over this Maine from Hell to that new World [...] Where Satan now prevailes, a Monument [...] Of merit high to all th' infernal Host, [...] Easing thir passage hence, for intercourse, [...] 260 [...] Or transmigration, as thir lot shall lead. [...] Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn [...] By this new felt attraction and instinct. [...] Whom thus the meager Shadow answerd soon. [...] Goe whither Fate and inclination strong [...] Leads thee, I shall not lag behinde, nor erre [...] The way, thou leading, such a sent I draw [...] Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste [...] The savour of Death from all things there that live: [...] Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest [...] 270 [...] Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid. [...] So saying, with delight he snuff'd the smell [...] Of mortal change on Earth. As when a flock [...] Of ravenous Fowl, though many a League remote, [...] Against the day of Battel, to a Field, [...] Where Armies lie encampt, come flying, lur'd [...] With sent of living Carcasses design'd [...] For death, the following day, in bloodie fight. [...] So sented the grim Feature, and upturn'd [...] His Nostril wide into the murkie Air, [...] 280 [...] Sagacious of his Quarrey from so farr. [...] Then Both from out Hell Gates into the waste [...] Wide Anarchie of Chaos damp and dark [...] Flew divers, & with Power (thir Power was great) [...] Hovering upon the Waters; what they met [...] Solid or slimie, as in raging Sea [...] Tost up and down, together crowded drove [...] From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell. [...] As when two Polar Winds blowing adverse [...] Upon the Cronian Sea, together drive [...] 290 [...] Mountains of Ice, that stop th' imagin'd way [...] Beyond Petsora Eastward, to the rich [...] Cathaian Coast. The aggregated Soyle [...] Death with his Mace petrific, cold and dry, [...] As with a Trident smote, and fix't as firm [...] As Delos floating once; the rest his look [...] Bound with Gorgonian rigor not to move, [...] And with Asphaltic slime; broad as the Gate, [...] Deep to the Roots of Hell the gather'd beach [...] They fasten'd, and the Mole immense wraught on [...] 300 [...] Over the foaming deep high Archt, a Bridge [...] Of length prodigious joyning to the Wall [...] Immoveable of this now fenceless world [...] Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad, [...] Smooth, easie, inoffensive down to Hell. [...] So, if great things to small may be compar'd, [...] Xerxes, the Libertie of Greece to yoke, [...] From Susa his Memnonian Palace high [...] Came to the Sea, and over Hellespont [...] Bridging his way, Europe with Asia joyn'd, [...] 310 [...] And scourg'd with many a stroak th' indignant waves. [...] Now had they brought the work by wondrous Art [...] Pontifical, a ridge of pendent Rock [...] Over the vext Abyss, following the track [...] Of Satan, to the selfsame place where hee [...] First lighted from his Wing, and landed safe [...] From out of Chaos to the outside bare [...] Of this round World: with Pinns of Adamant [...] And Chains they made all fast, too fast they made [...] And durable; and now in little space [...] 320 [...] The Confines met of Empyrean Heav'n [...] And of this World, and on the left hand Hell [...] With long reach interpos'd; three sev'ral wayes [...] In sight, to each of these three places led. [...] And now thir way to Earth they had descri'd, [...] To Paradise first tending, when behold [...] Satan in likeness of an Angel bright [...] Betwixt the Centaure and the Scorpion stearing [...] His Zenith, while the Sun in Aries rose: [...] Disguis'd he came, but those his Children dear [...] 330 [...] Thir Parent soon discern'd, though in disguise. [...] Hee, after Eve seduc't, unminded slunk [...] Into the Wood fast by, and changing shape [...] To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act [...] By Eve, though all unweeting, seconded [...] Upon her Husband, saw thir shame that sought [...] Vain covertures; but when he saw descend [...] The Son of God to judge them, terrifi'd [...] Hee fled, not hoping to escape, but shun [...] The present, fearing guiltie what his wrauth [...] 340 [...] Might suddenly inflict; that past, return'd [...] By Night, and listning where the hapless Paire [...] Sate in thir sad discourse, and various plaint, [...] Thence gatherd his own doom, which understood [...] Not instant, but of future time. With joy [...] And tidings fraught, to Hell he now return'd, [...] And at the brink of Chaos, neer the foot [...] Of this new wondrous Pontifice, unhop't [...] Met who to meet him came, his Ofspring dear. [...] Great joy was at thir meeting, and at sight [...] 350 [...] Of that stupendious Bridge his joy encreas'd. [...] Long hee admiring stood, till Sin, his faire [...] Inchanting Daughter, thus the silence broke. [...] O Parent, these are thy magnific deeds, [...] Thy Trophies, which thou view'st as not thine own, [...] Thou art thir Author and prime Architect: [...] For I no sooner in my Heart divin'd, [...] My Heart, which by a secret harmonie [...] Still moves with thine, joyn'd in connexion sweet, [...] That thou on Earth hadst prosper'd, which thy looks [...] 360 [...] Now also evidence, but straight I felt [...] Though distant from thee Worlds between, yet felt [...] That I must after thee with this thy Son; [...] Such fatal consequence unites us three: [...] Hell could no longer hold us in her bounds, [...] Nor this unvoyageable Gulf obscure [...] Detain from following thy illustrious track. [...] Thou hast atchiev'd our libertie, confin'd [...] Within Hell Gates till now, thou us impow'rd [...] To fortifie thus farr, and overlay [...] 370 [...] With this portentous Bridge the dark Abyss. [...] Thine now is all this World, thy vertue hath won [...] What thy hands builded not, thy Wisdom gain'd [...] With odds what Warr hath lost, and fully aveng'd [...] Our foile in Heav'n; here thou shalt Monarch reign, [...] There didst not; there let him still Victor sway, [...] As Battel hath adjudg'd, from this new World [...] Retiring, by his own doom alienated, [...] And henceforth Monarchie with thee divide [...] Of all things, parted by th' Empyreal bounds, [...] 380 [...] His Quadrature, from thy Orbicular World, [...] Or trie thee now more dang'rous to his Throne. [...] Whom thus the Prince of Darkness answerd glad. [...] Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both, [...] High proof ye now have giv'n to be the Race [...] Of Satan (for I glorie in the name, [...] Antagonist of Heav'ns Almightie King) [...] Amply have merited of me, of all [...] Th' Infernal Empire, that so neer Heav'ns dore [...] Triumphal with triumphal act have met, [...] 390 [...] Mine with this glorious Work, & made one Realm [...] Hell and this World, one Realm, one Continent [...] Of easie thorough-fare. Therefore while I [...] Descend through Darkness, on your Rode with ease [...] To my associate Powers, them to acquaint [...] With these successes, and with them rejoyce, [...] You two this way, among those numerous Orbs [...] All yours, right down to Paradise descend; [...] There dwell & Reign in bliss, thence on the Earth [...] Dominion exercise and in the Aire, [...] 400 [...] Chiefly on Man, sole Lord of all declar'd, [...] Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill. [...] My Substitutes I send ye, and Create [...] Plenipotent on Earth, of matchless might [...] Issuing from mee: on your joynt vigor now [...] My hold of this new Kingdom all depends, [...] Through Sin to Death expos'd by my exploit. [...] If your joynt power prevaile, th' affaires of Hell [...] No detriment need feare, goe and be strong. [...] So saying he dismiss'd them, they with speed [...] 410 [...] Thir course through thickest Constellations held [...] Spreading thir bane; the blasted Starrs lookt wan, [...] And Planets, Planet-strook, real Eclips [...] Then sufferd. Th' other way Satan went down [...] The Causey to Hell Gate; on either side [...] Disparted Chaos over built exclaimd, [...] And with rebounding surge the barrs assaild, [...] That scorn'd his indignation: through the Gate, [...] Wide open and unguarded, Satan pass'd, [...] And all about found desolate; for those [...] 420 [...] Appointed to sit there, had left thir charge, [...] Flown to the upper World; the rest were all [...] Farr to the inland retir'd, about the walls [...] Of Pandemonium, Citie and proud seate [...] Of Lucifer, so by allusion calld, [...] Of that bright Starr to Satan paragond. [...] There kept thir Watch the Legions, while the Grand [...] In Council sate, sollicitous what chance [...] Might intercept thir Emperour sent, so hee [...] Departing gave command, and they observ'd. [...] 430 [...] As when the Tartar from his Russian Foe [...] By Astracan over the Snowie Plaines [...] Retires, or Bactrian Sophi from the hornes [...] Of Turkish Crescent, leaves all waste beyond [...] The Realme of Aladule, in his retreate [...] To Tauris or Casbeen. So these the late [...] Heav'n-banisht Host, left desert utmost Hell [...] Many a dark League, reduc't in careful Watch [...] Round thir Metropolis, and now expecting [...] Each hour their great adventurer from the search [...] 440 [...] Of Forrein Worlds: he through the midst unmarkt, [...] In shew plebeian Angel militant [...] Of lowest order, past; and from the dore [...] Of that Plutonian Hall, invisible [...] Ascended his high Throne, which under state [...] Of richest texture spred, at th' upper end [...] Was plac't in regal lustre. Down a while [...] He sate, and round about him saw unseen: [...] At last as from a Cloud his fulgent head [...] And shape Starr bright appeer'd, or brighter, clad [...] 450 [...] With what permissive glory since his fall [...] Was left him, or false glitter: All amaz'd [...] At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng [...] Bent thir aspect, and whom they wish'd beheld, [...] Thir mighty Chief returnd: loud was th' acclaime: [...] Forth rush'd in haste the great consulting Peers, [...] Rais'd from thir dark Divan, and with like joy [...] Congratulant approach'd him, who with hand [...] Silence, and with these words attention won. [...] Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers, [...] 460 [...] For in possession such, not onely of right, [...] I call ye and declare ye now, returnd [...] Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth [...] Triumphant out of this infernal Pit [...] Abominable, accurst, the house of woe, [...] And Dungeon of our Tyrant: Now possess, [...] As Lords, a spacious World, to our native Heaven [...] Little inferiour, by my adventure hard [...] With peril great atchiev'd. Long were to tell [...] What I have don, what sufferd, with what paine [...] 470 [...] Voyag'd the unreal, vast, unbounded deep [...] Of horrible confusion, over which [...] By Sin and Death a broad way now is pav'd [...] To expedite your glorious march; but I [...] Toild out my uncouth passage, forc't to ride [...] Th' untractable Abysse, plung'd in the womb [...] Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wilde, [...] That jealous of thir secrets fiercely oppos'd [...] My journey strange, with clamorous uproare [...] Protesting Fate supreame; thence how I found [...] 480 [...] The new created World, which fame in Heav'n [...] Long had foretold, a Fabrick wonderful [...] Of absolute perfection, therein Man [...] Plac't in a Paradise, by our exile [...] Made happie: Him by fraud I have seduc'd [...] From his Creator, and the more to increase [...] Your wonder, with an Apple; he thereat [...] Offended, worth your laughter, hath giv'n up [...] Both his beloved Man and all his World, [...] To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us, [...] 490 [...] Without our hazard, labour or allarme, [...] To range in, and to dwell, and over Man [...] To rule, as over all he should have rul'd. [...] True is, mee also he hath judg'd, or rather [...] Mee not, but the brute Serpent in whose shape [...] Man I deceav'd: that which to mee belongs, [...] Is enmity, which he will put between [...] Mee and Mankinde; I am to bruise his heel; [...] His Seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head: [...] A World who would not purchase with a bruise, [...] 500 [...] Or much more grievous pain? Ye have th' account [...] Of my performance: What remaines, ye Gods, [...] But up and enter now into full bliss. [...] So having said, a while he stood, expecting [...] Thir universal shout and high applause [...] To fill his eare, when contrary he hears [...] On all sides, from innumerable tongues [...] A dismal universal hiss, the sound [...] Of public scorn; he wonderd, but not long [...] Had leasure, wondring at himself now more; [...] 510 [...] His Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare, [...] His Armes clung to his Ribs, his Leggs entwining [...] Each other, till supplanted down he fell [...] A monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone, [...] Reluctant, but in vaine, a greater power [...] Now rul'd him, punisht in the shape he sin'd, [...] According to his doom: he would have spoke, [...] But hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue [...] To forked tongue, for now were all transform'd [...] Alike, to Serpents all as accessories [...] 520 [...] To his bold Riot: dreadful was the din [...] Of hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now [...] With complicated monsters, head and taile, [...] Scorpion and Asp, and Amphisbaena dire, [...] Cerastes hornd, Hydrus, and Ellops drear, [...] And Dipsas (Not so thick swarm'd once the Soil [...] Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle [...] Ophiusa) but still greatest hee the midst, [...] Now Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun [...] Ingenderd in the Pythian Vale on slime, [...] 530 [...] Huge Python, and his Power no less he seem'd [...] Above the rest still to retain; they all [...] Him follow'd issuing forth to th' open Field, [...] Where all yet left of that revolted Rout [...] Heav'n-fall'n, in station stood or just array, [...] Sublime with expectation when to see [...] In Triumph issuing forth thir glorious Chief; [...] They saw, but other sight instead, a crowd [...] Of ugly Serpents; horror on them fell, [...] And horrid sympathie; for what they saw, [...] 540 [...] They felt themselvs now changing; down thir arms, [...] Down fell both Spear and Shield, down they as fast, [...] And the dire hiss renew'd, and the dire form [...] Catcht by Contagion, like in punishment, [...] As in thir crime.

I sought it not: [...] Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee [...] That proud excuse? yet him not thy election, [...] But Natural necessity begot. [...] God made thee of choice his own, and of his own [...] To serve him, thy reward was of his grace, [...] Thy punishment then justly is at his Will. [...] Be it so, for I submit, his doom is fair, [...] That dust I am, and shall to dust returne: [...] 770 [...] O welcom hour whenever! why delayes [...] His hand to execute what his Decree [...] Fixd on this day? why do I overlive, [...] Why am I mockt with death, and length'nd out [...] To deathless pain? how gladly would I meet [...] Mortalitie my sentence, and be Earth [...] Insensible, how glad would lay me down [...] As in my Mothers lap? there I should rest [...] And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more [...] Would Thunder in my ears, no fear of worse [...] 780 [...] To mee and to my ofspring would torment me [...] With cruel expectation.

[...] All of me then shall die: let this appease [...] The doubt, since humane reach no further knows.

Why comes not Death, [...] Said hee, with one thrice acceptable stroke [...] To end me? Shall Truth fail to keep her word, [...] Justice Divine not hast'n to be just?

The two LAGEOS satellites {{have been used to}} measure frame dragging (a truly rotational effect predicted by GR) with a 10 % error. A new mission and an optimized, second generation satellite, LARES (I.

This requires a full thermal analysis of the test mass and an accurate knowledge of the asymmetric thermal <b>thursts</b> due to the radiation emitted by the Sun and Earth. A Space Climatic Facility (SCF) has been built at INFN-LNF (Frascati, Italy) to perform this experimental program on LAGEOS and LARES prototypes.

40|$|The {{following}} study {{presents the}} Thrust Controller (TC) design and validation {{for a large}} civil aircraft, the Boeing 747. The TC works with the Automatic Flight Control System (AFCS) and the Flight Management System (FMS) to provide automatic, full-flight-regime energy management with minimum pilot inputs. The controller is to be coupled to the pitch channel of the AFCS to eliminate any altitude variation during <b>thurst</b> manoeuvres and will be available throughout the entire flight envelope. The proposed system is integrated within the Dynamic Test Bed (DTB) developed by CMC Electronics and its partners. In fact, {{in an attempt to}} minimize costs and reduce "in air" testing, CMC wishes to fully develop the concept of a real-time DTB, a simplified aircraft simulator, and to expand it into a comprehensive FMS design and test tool, capable of certified service. The goal of the present study is the design, simulation, integration and qualification of the TC using the DTB as the integration platform.

First the <b>thurst</b> controller was developed using a classic single inputsingle output controller based on the Proportional-Integral-Derivative structure and was validated over the full flight envelope. The controller is coupled to the pitch channel using an altitude variation dependant gain on the speed channel to eliminate altitude variation during speed control manoeuvres using <b>thurst</b> increase and decrease. The second design architecture proposes a modem state-feedback controller that fully couples pitch and speed channels. Feedback gains were chosen for every linearized point using the Eigenvector assignment method for system robustness. A controller was thus designed for every linearized point and the TC system switches between controllers according to flight conditions. Many improvements were then added to both controllers' architectures to add speed and <b>thurst</b> limitations and placards protections prior to nonlinear integration. The integration of the modem controller could not be validated within the nonlinear DTB framework in the scope of the current project due to autopilot and platform limitations. On the other hand, the classical controller proposed is integrated and tested within the nonlinear conditions of the DTB. To qualify the TC as a design and test tool and integrate it in the DTB we sought to ensure its smooth functioning and to reach the performance awaited while respecting the various limits and placards. A set of qualification tests was written and mn for that purpose. The results were judged satisfactory as the aircraft settles within the required limitations while improvements can be made and recommendations are presented...|$|E

The process uses a “family capability ” derived from family {{analysis of the}} embedding system. This analysis allows reuse capability to be designed into the process by exploiting prior knowledge {{of the differences between}} members of an engine family. The process described follows the traditional software lifecycle. However, the nature of the stages is modified to incorporate the use of the family capability, essentially to allow systematic application of both compositional and generational reuse throughout the development process. The process described was evaluated on a trial project to develop, and subsequently modify, a <b>thurst</b> reverser system for a small aero-engine.

40|$|The {{excellent}} {{exposure of}} the Higher Himalayan Crystallines (HHC) in Western Nepal allowed to constrain the tectonic, metamorphic and geochronological evolution of previously unrecognized high-temperature shear zones inside the HHC. A top-to-the SW high-temperature shear zone has been detected (Toijem Shear Zone: TSZ) in the middle portion of the HHC, bracketed between the Main Central <b>Thurst</b> {{to the bottom and}} the South Tibetan Detachment System to the top. In the TSZ mylonites abundant prismatic sillimanite crystals are aligned along the main foliation and wrap garnet and kyanite porphyroblasts. Abundant muscovite overgrows both kyanite and sillimanite crystals. Thermo barometric data indicate prograde metamorphism, in the kyanite field followed by decompression in the sillimanite field. U-Pb monazite ages on micaschists and gneisses, from both the footwall and the hanging wall of the TSZ, span between ca. 43 and 17 Ma, with major peaks at ca. 43, 38 and 33 Ma. The oldest age corresponds to monazite included in garnet in kyanite bearing gneiss, and is possibly recording the earliest stages of deformation and metamorphism of the HHC. Further monazite formation is attributed to continuing metamorphism and/or fluid activity. U-Pb ages from zoned monazites in sillimanite bearing mylonites of the TSZ indicate continuous or multiple metamorphism with a major episode at around 26 Ma. The ca. 43, 38 and 33 Ma monazite formation {{can be attributed to the}} underthrusting event and only later, from 26 Ma, exhumation has been active. The 26 Ma age, has been found only in the monazites on the TSZ mylonites and does not appear in previous geochronological studies of the Himalayan belt. The ca. 26 Ma could be attributed to the beginning of the TSZ activity marking the earliest stage of decompression of the HHC. Geometric, kinematic, geochronological and petrological data indicate that, after the underthrusting phase, the HHC in Dolpo area recorded the activity of a high-temperature shear zone (TSZ) developed during the earlier stages of exhumation of the HHC enhancing the decompression of the upper portion of the HHC before the main extrusion of the HHC by contemporaneous activity of the MCT and STDS constrained at 23 - 17 Ma...|$|E
40|$|This study {{comprises}} {{a survey}} on ecology, morphology and taxonomy of parasitic fungi infecting Pteridophytes and Orchidaceae {{found by the}} author on several field trips to Western Panama {{as part of the}} project plant parasitic micro-fungi of Western Panama (ppMP). In Panama, approximately 9500 species of vascular plants are found. Of these, Orchidaceae are with ca. 1150 (ca. 12 %) species by far the most speciose family. The Pteridophytes in Panama comprise ca. 940 species in 31 families. Most fungal pathogens on Orchidaceae in tropical regions were described from plants in culture or from material intercepted at borders by plant quarantine services and not from their natural habitats. Therefore, little is known about distribution and ecology of these pathogens in their natural range. The author determined and classified several hundred Orchidaceae-species and Pteridophytes at the sites selected {{in the context of the}} project. This work facilitated the identification of many host plants (at least to genus-level) even in sterile condition in the field. About 65 species of Pucciniales are known to infest Orchidaceae and ca. 38 % of them are described from tropical America. All available types of Pucciniales on Orchidaceae in tropical America were studied and compared with 91 specimens of rust fungi on orchids collected by the author in Panama. Several hundred additional specimens housed in the BPI, almost all intercepted from plant quarantine services, were used for comparison. As result of this work, it is suggested to combine Uromyces stenorrhynchi Henn. to Sphenospora and, as this is the oldest epithet, to synonymize S. kevorkianii Linder, S. mera Cumm. and S. saphena Cumm. with it. Further, it could be demonstrated that Uredo aurantiaca Montemartini, U. cyrtopodii Syd. & P. Syd., U. epidendri Henn., U. guacae Mayor, U. gynandrearum Corda, U. lynchii (Berk.) Plowr., U. neopustulata Cumm. (&# 8801;U. pustulata Henn.), U. nigropuncta Henn., U. oncidii Henn., U. ornithidii F. Kern., Cif. & <b>Thurst.,</b> and presumably U. scabies Cke., are anamorphs of this variable species. U. gynandrearum is the oldest anamorph-name for all these taxa. Therefore, it can be established that this rust infects more than 80 species of Orchidaceae in three subfamilies. In total, the anamorph of this species was collected by the author on 17 different species of Orchidaceae in Panama which, apart from one species, are all new hosts to science. The molecular data obtained by the author confirm this view, although more data, especially from material from the whole range of distribution of U. gynandrearum, are necessary. Puccinia spiranthicola Cumm. was found to be a synonym of P. cinnamomea Diet. & Holw. and was found by the author on three different Orchidaceae in two subfamilies. Uredo pleurothallidis Keissl. is now considered a synonym of U. wittmackiana Henn. and the latter as the anamorph of Puccinia oncidii Cumm. In the anamorph genus Uredo, a new species was found infecting at least five different species of Sobralia and Elleanthus (Sobraliinae) at different localities. Molecular data indicate it to be related to the currently polyphyletic Phakopsoraceae. For the rusts with suprastomatal sori on Orchidaceae, now separated from Hemileia and placed in the genus Desmosorus (nom. inval.), the current concept with only one taxon is rejected and the establishment of three subspecies is suggested. The complicated taxonomy is discussed and makes it necessary to validate the genus-name and make a new combination. Another Hemileia-anamorph species was found by the author and is considered to be new to science. This is the first species of this alliance in America on Orchidaceae. Molecular data obtained by the author confirm the separation of Desmosorus from Hemileia and the position of the new species. For rusts on Pteridophytes, a new species of Milesia, (teleomorph: Milesina) and a new anamorphic species of Uredinopsis was found, both on hosts hitherto not known. In Calidion, the presumable anamorph-genus of Uncol, the species C. cf. cenicafeae Salazar & Buriticá was found on several new hosts. Further, the teleomorph was found. Morphologically, this teleomorph did not agree with the description of Uncol by the author of the genus, although the anamorph characteristics left no doubt that it is Calidion. Apparently, the description of Uncol is inadequate, but cannot be improved, as the type is unavailable. Molecular data obtained by the author show this species to be closest to Desmosorus. For Uredo superficialis Speg., the anamorph of Desmella, nine new hosts in eight different fern families were found by the author and the collaborators of the ppMP-project. Ecological data indicate that this species includes different host specific races, which, however could not be distinguished morphologically. For all these rusts, a thorough discussion of the ecology in their habitats is given. In total, 21 LSU rDNA sequences from 6 different rust species on Orchidaceae and Pteridophytes were obtained and analyzed with the Maximum Parsimony and Minimum Evolution method. Here, the position of several groups could be confirmed, and some anamorphs could be assigned to different teleomorphic relationships. Within the Ascomycota and their anamorphs, several hitherto unknown species and species not known from these hosts or not known from Panama were found and analyzed. On Orchidaceae, the following fungi belonging to the Ascomycota are described, illustrated and discussed: In the Phyllachorales, a hitherto not known Phyllachora sp. was found on Oncidium warszewiczii Rchb. f. and was compared with the other species of this order currently known from Orchidaceae. In the Asterinaceae s. l. Lembosia cf. epidendri Meir. Silva & O. R. Pereia was found on Maxillaria crassifolia (Lindl.) Rchb. f., which is a new host and new host alliance for this fungus hitherto only known from Brazil. The fungus is described and compared with all species of Asterinaceae currently known on Orchidaceae. In the Meliolaceae, Meliola orchidacearum Cif. was found on Camaridium biolleyi (Schltr.) Schltr. and an Epidendrum sp. which are new hosts and new host alliances of this fungus which was hitherto only known from the Caribbean Islands. It is described, illustrated and compared with the type. In the Glomerellaceae, Glomerella cingulata and its anamorph Colletotrichum gloeosporioides were found on several hosts. The species is illustrated, described and compared with data from literature. In the anamorphic Mycosphaerellaceae, Pseudocercospora odontoglossii (Prill. & Delacr.) U. Braun, a species currently only known from culture, was found on the new host Pleurothallis imraei Lindl. It is illustrated, described and compared with data from literature. On ferns, the following other fungi are described, illustrated and discussed: A conspicuous undescribed form of Polycyclus was found by the author on Elaphoglossum ciliatum (C. Presl.) T. Moore (Dryopteridaceae) and Serpocaulon loriceum (L.) A. R. Sm. (Polypodiaceae). A conspectus of Parmulariaceae infecting ferns is given and demonstrated that Polycyclina should be synonymized under Polycyclus. Summing up, it can be assessed, especially for the Pucciniales, that the most speciose plant family in Panama carries remarkable few species of specific parasites, and that many of them seem to be distributed over a wide range of species which often are not closely related. One reason amongst others seems to be that parasites need a minimum density of host plants in a habitat to survive. As orchid species often occur with only few (and often small) individual plants at a given locality, the probability for a specific pathogen to infect a plant gets too low, hence high diversity by low abundance of hosts might be an impediment for specific pathogens. In this case, unspecific parasites, or such which are infecting larger alliances, are in advantage. Other reasons could be specific traits of orchids, like succulence and mycotrophy which might hamper fungal infections. In zahlreichen Veröffentlichungen wird auf den Zusammenhang zwischen Diversität von Gefäßpflanzen und Pilzen hingewiesen. Die gegenwärtig am häufigsten zitierten Autoren schwanken in ihren Schätzungen zwischen 712, 000 und 1, 5 Millionen Pilzarten weltweit, was einem Verhältnis von Gefäßpflanzenarten zu Pilzarten von etwa 1 zu 2, 7 bis 1 zu 5, 5 entsprechen würde, wobei von diesen bis zu einem Drittel pflanzenparasitisch sein sollen. In diesem Zusammenhang wird oft angenommen, dass jede Pflanzengattung etwa 50 verschiedene pilzliche Pathogen-Arten beherbergt, von denen die Hälfte spezifisch auf Gattungsniveau sein soll. Panama, das südlichste Land Zentralamerikas, mit einer etwas größeren Fläche als Bayern, beherbergt etwa 9500 Gefäßpflanzenarten, gehört also, relativ zur Landfläche, zu den artenreichsten Gebieten der Erde. Die Orchidaceen sind mit etwa 1150 Arten (ca. 12 %) die mit Abstand vielfältigste Pflanzenfamilie in Panama. An Pilzarten sind für Panama etwa 1900 Arten bekannt, von diesen sind ca. 570 pflanzenparasitisch. Bei den häufig als spezifisch (bestimmte Pflanzengruppen besiedelnden) angesehenen Rostpilzen (Pucciniales) sind gegenwärtig rund 113 Arten für Panama veröffentlicht. Weltweit ist das Verhältnis von Rostarten zu Poaceen-Arten etwa 1 zu 8, während es bei den Orchidaceen nur etwa 1 zu 287 beträgt. Innerhalb des Projektes pflanzenparasitische Mikropilze im Westen Panamas (ppMP) war die Erfassung von Diversität pflanzenparasitischer Pilze ein zentrales Anliegen. Insofern lag es nahe, bei der in Panama diversesten Pflanzengruppe zu schauen, ob dieses Verhältnis durch nicht ausreichende Besammlung und Untersuchung oder durch ein tatsächlich vorliegendes Verbreitungsmuster verursacht wird. Für die Feldforschungen wurden zwölf Standorte ausgewählt, die sich durch Höhenlage, Pflanzengesellschaft, Störungsgrad und Neigung zur Pazifischen oder Karibischen Seite unterschieden. Insgesamt zu vier unterschiedlichen Jahreszeiten sammelten dort für je zwei Stunden drei Mykologen alle erreichbaren pilzlichen Infektionen an Pflanzen. Innerhalb einer Sammlergruppe waren die Sammler auf jeweils bestimmte Pilzgruppen zentriert, so hat der Autor insbesondere auf Rostpilze geachtet. Weitere drei Standorte wurden innerhalb des Projektes nur zweimal aufgesucht. Für die Untersuchung von pflanzenparasitischen Pilzen auf Orchideen erwiesen sich die ppMP-Standorte als ungeeignet, da mit Ausnahme von vier Standorten Orchideen in einer zu geringen Dichte und Diversität vorkamen. Weiter war selbst bei den geeigneten Standorten die räumliche Größe zu gering um erstens die Diversität an Orchidaceen zu erfassen und zweitens ausreichend Individuen einer Art zu untersuchen um eventuelle Parasiten zu finden. Aus diesem Grunde hat der Autor weitere, länger andauernde Exkursionen auch an andere Standorte unternommen. Bisher sind rund zehn Arten pflanzenparasitischer Pilze auf Orchideen aus Panama publiziert. Von diesen sind zwei z. Z. nur von der Typaufsammlung bekannt, die restlichen haben auch in anderen Ländern eine weitere Verbreitung. Sieht man von Schwächeparasiten ab, erwiesen sich im Rahmen der eigenen Forschungen die Rostpilze als die häufigsten Parasiten auf Orchideen. Neben den Feldforschungen wurden im Rahmen der Arbeit Herbarstudien betrieben und es wurde versucht, mit isolierter und amplifizierter DNA Verwandtschaften verschiedener gefundener Roste zu ermitteln. Aufgrund der Ergebnisse schlägt der Autor verschiedene Kombinationen und Neubeschreibungen vor, zudem beleuchtet er anhand der an den Standorten gemachten Beobachtungen die Ökologie verschiedener Pilze, die bisher nur aus Zollbeschlagnahmungen und der Kultur bekannt waren. An den Standorten in Panama konnten Roste auf Orchideen in fünf verschiedenen Allianzen gefunden werden. In jeder dieser Verwandtschaften wurden alle auffindbaren Typen, bzw. authentischen Sammlungen untersucht, beschrieben und gezeichnet. Bei den Rosten mit suprastomatalen Sori fanden sich zwei Verwandtschaften. Eine Art die schon seit etwa 1905 aus der Kultur bekannt war, ist Uredo behnickiana Henn., nach damals herrschender Meinung eine Anamorphe der Gattung Hemileia. Nach Auffassung der letzten Revisoren, die 2004 mit dieser Verwandtschaft gearbeitet haben, sind unter diesem Namen Hemileia americana Mass. und H. oncidii Griff. & Maubl. zu synonymisieren. Beim Typus von H. oncidii hatten diese das Teleutostadium gefunden und darauf die neue Gattung Desmosorus begründet. Die komplexe Taxonomie dieser Gattung wird ausführlich diskutiert und warum dieser Name ungültig ist. In Panama wurde dieser Pilz auf drei verschiedenen Allianzen von Orchideen gefunden, einerseits auf fünf verschiedenen Arten der Laeliinae Epidendreae [Dimerandra emarginata (G. Mey.) Hoehne, Epidendrum microrigidiflorum Hágsater, Prosthechea vespa, Scaphyglottis amparoana (Schltr.) Dressler, S. bifida (Rchb. f.) Schweinf. und S. corallorrhiza (Ames) Ames], weiter auf einer Art der Maxillarieae Cymbidieae [Ornithidium cf. aggregatum (Kunth) Rchb. f. ] und auf einer Art der Unterfamilie Orchidoideae [Erythrodes killipii Ames]. Es erwies sich, dass die Besiedlung unterschiedlicher Verwandtschaftsgruppen von Wirten mit morphologischen Merkmalen der Pilze korreliert ist, dieses wurde durch die Untersuchung der Herbarbelege bestätigt. Aufgrund dessen schlägt der Autor vor, diese Pilze in drei Unterarten aufzuteilen, nämlich Uredo behnickiana ssp. behnickiana, U. b. ssp. americana und jener Form auf E. killipii, für die noch ein Name geschaffen werden muß. Molekular zeigte sich, wie bei der Erstbeschreibung der Gattung Desmosorus schon vermutet, dass diese Allianz nicht in die engere Verwandtschaft von Hemileia gehört. Dieser Pilz gruppiert mit den Farnrosten der Gattungen Uncol/Calidion. Um die Familie der Uncolaceae zu bestätigen, wäre es aber wünschenswert, noch mehr Taxa zu sequenzieren. Die zweite Verwandtschaft mit suprastomatalen Sori fand sich auf Dichaea sp. Hier wurde das Anamorph einer echten Hemileia-Art gefunden. Da diese Form aus Panama verschieden ist von der einzigen Art, U. phaji (Racib.) Ritschel auf mehreren asiatischen Orchideenarten, wird sie vom Autor als noch unbeschrieben erachtet. In den Hochlagen wurde auf Malaxis hercodonta (Rchb. f.) Kunze, Prescottia stachyodes (Sw.) Lindl. und Goodyera ovatilabia Schltr. ein Rost der Gattung Puccinia gefunden. Herbar- und Literaturstudien ergaben, dass diese Art P. cinnamomea Diet. & Holw. ist, und dass P. spiranthicola Cumm. mit dieser zu synonymisieren ist. Die Fundsituation macht es unwahrscheinlich, dass hier verschiedene Arten vorliegen, obwohl die Wirte zwei verschiedenen Unterfamilien entstammen. Herbarstudien ergaben, dass Uredo wittmackiana Henn. und U. pleurothallidis Keissl. Anamorphen von P. oncidii Cumm. sind. Diese Arten wurden bisher nicht in Panama gefunden, kommen aber sehr wahrscheinlich hier vor. Innerhalb der Teleomorph-Gattung Sphenospora wurden bisher S. kevorkianii Linder, S. mera Cumm. und S. saphena Cumm. auf Orchideen beschrieben. Einige Anamorph-Arten, wie Uredo nigropuncta Henn., U. epidendri Henn., U. cyrtopodii Syd. & P. Syd., U. guacae Mayor und U. carnosa Speg. wurden in der Vergangenheit bereits als konspezifisch mit S. kevorkianii angesehen. Gemein ist allen, dass unter diesen Namen Belege, die von Orchideen genommen wurden (die von den Pflanzenschutzämtern bei der Einfuhr in die USA beschlagnahmt wurden), sehr häufig in den Herbarien vertreten sind. Untersuchungen des Autors an allen auffindbaren Typen in dieser Allianz, sowie zahlreichen weiteren Belegen zeigten, dass die verschiedenen Taxa sich nicht trennen lassen, da alle relevanten Merkmale in einem Kontinuum ineinander übergehen. Weitere Taxa, die als ebenso konspezifisch erkannt wurden, sind Uromyces stenorrhynchi Henn., U. gynandrearum Corda, U. lynchii (Berk.) Plowr., U. neopustulata Cumm., U. aurantiaca Montemartini, U. oncidii Henn., U. ornithidii F. Kern, Cif. & <b>Thurst.</b> und U. scabies Cke. Da Uromyces stenorrhynchi der älteste Teleomorph-Name ist, wird er S. kevorkianii ersetzen müssen. In Panama konnte der Autor diese Art auf Dichaea elliptica Dressler & Folsom, D. cf. morrisii Fawc. & Rendl., Epidendrum brachyclinium Hágsater & Garcá-Luz, E. cf. barbeyanum Hágsater, E. exasperatum Rchb. f., E. ramosum Jacq., Maxillaria dendrobioides (Schltr.) L. O. Williams, Oncidium sp., O. panduriforme Ames & C. Schweinf., Prescottia stachyodes (Sw.) Lindl., Scaphyglottis sp., Stelis spp., Trigonidium egertonianum Bateman ex Lindl., Xylobium powellii Schltr. und X. elongatum (Lindl. & Paxton) Hemsl. finden. Obwohl die Wirte zum Teil nur entfernt miteinander verwandt sind, konnten keine trennenden Merkmalsdiskontinuitäten gefunden werden. Es gibt vermutlich verschiedene physiologische Rassen, die sich morphologisch nicht gut unterscheiden lassen. Hier wären Infektionsversuche und molekulare Untersuchungen in einem größeren Rahmen sinnvoll. In der Anamorph-Gattung Uredo konnte der Verfasser eine weitere noch unbeschriebene Art finden, die Elleanthus lancifolius C. Presl., E. tricallosus Ames & Schweinf., Sobralia leucoxantha Rchb. f., S. chrysostoma Dressler und einige weitere Vertreter der Sobraliinae befällt. Molekular gruppierte dieser Rost mit einer Gruppe der polyphyletischen Phakopsoraceae, die gegenwärtig nicht aufgelöst werden kann, da keine Sequenzen der Typusart der Familie vorliegen. Pteridophyten sind weltweit mit etwa 9600 und in Panama mit etwa 940 Arten vertreten. Derzeit sind auf ihnen rund 75 Arten von Rostpilzen bekannt. Aufgrund der Tatsache, dass Farnroste phylogenetisch als basal galten, wurden, anders als bei den Orchideenrosten, zahlreiche Studien zu Infektionsversuchen, Wirtswechsel und Phylogenie veröffentlicht. Mehrere Arten erwiesen sich als morphologisch schwer unterscheidbar, aber durch ihre Wirtswahl eindeutig getrennt. Für Panama sind derzeit drei Gattungen von Rosten publiziert: Desmella anemiae Syd. & P. Syd., mehrere unbestimmte Milesia-Arten und Uredinopsis macrosperma (Cke) Magn. Vom Autor und den Mitgliedern der Arbeitsgruppe wurde das vermutliche anamorph-Stadium von Desmella anemiae Syd. & P. Syd. auf Salpichlaena volubilis (Kaulf.) J. Sm. (Blechnaceae), Hypolepis hostilis (Kunze) C. Presl. (Dennstaedtiaceae), Bolbitis portoricensis (Spreng.) Hennipman (Dryopteridaceae), Campyloneurum sphenodes (Kunze & Klotzsch) Fée, Nephrolepis biserrata (Sw.) Schott (Lomariopsidaceae), Serpocaulon fraxinifolium (Jacq.) A. R. Sm., S. loriceum (L.) a. R. Sm. (Polypodiaceae), Pteris altissima Poir. (Pteridaceae), zwei Arten von Thelypteris (subgen. Meniscium und Steiropteris) (Thelypteridaceae), und Diplazium prominulum Maxon (Woodsiaceae) gefunden. In den aktuellen Veröffentlichungen werden die Anamorphen Caeoma mbatobiensis Speg, C. superficiale Speg., Uredo gymnogrammes Henn., U. aneimiae Henn., U. nephrolepidis Diet. und U. blechnicola Henn. der teleomorph-Art Desmella anemiae Syd. & P. Syd. zugeordnet. Da es nicht gelang, an den gesammelten Belegen das Teleomorph zu finden und damit Zweifel an der Identität mit D. anemiae vollständig auszuräumen, wurde sie hier unter dem ältesten Namen des anamorph-Stadiums Uredo superficialis (Speg.) Sacc. eingeordnet. Bislang wurde dieser Rost auf neun verschiedenen Farnfamilen in zwei Ordnungen und etwa 40 verschiedenen Farnarten gefunden, wovon 11 der Funde aus Panama bislang unbekannte Wirte sind. Alle in Panama gesammelten Belege wurden vermessen, Schnitte angefertigt und gezeichnet. Bezüglich der Basis eines Sorus zeigte sich eine gewisse Variabilität, die jedoch als durch die Blattanatomie des Wirtes verursacht angesehen wird. Die Untersuchung der Wirtsartenzusammensetzung an den verschiedenen Standorten zeigte, dass Wirte, die am einen Standort befallen waren, an anderen Standorten nicht befallen waren, während dort andere Farnarten befallen waren. Dies weist darauf hin, dass es wahrscheinlich morphologisch nicht trennbare Rassen gibt, die unterschiedliche Wirte besiedeln. Obwohl häufig gesammelt, gelang es mit einer Ausnahme nicht, DNA von diesen Farnrosten zu isolieren und Abschnitte zu amplifizieren. Hauptgrund dafür war die nahezu vollständige Infektion fast aller Belege mit Hyperparasiten und dass die Belege meist nur geringste Mengen an Sporen zur Isolation hergaben. Im Falle des einen Beleges gruppierte dieser, allerdings mit schlechter statischer Unterstützung, an einem Ast der Pucciniaceae s. l., bzw. der Pileolariaceae. Zwei weitere Belege, eine Uredinopsis-Anamorphe auf Polypodium rhodopleuron Kunze und eine Milesia auf P. ursipes Moritz ex C. Chr. erwiesen sich als unbeschrieben. Derzeit gibt es keinen Gattungsnamen für die (leicht erkennbaren) Uredinopsis-Anamorphen, und wegen der sich gerade in Bewegung befindlichen Taxonomie von Teleomorphen und Anamorphen allgemein, erscheint es nicht sinnvoll solche zu schaffen. In der Anamorph-Gattung Calidion wurde vom Autor eine Art auf Serpocaulon loriceum (L.) A. R. Sm. (Polypodiaceae) und auf Serpocaulon sp. gefunden. Weiter konnten an einem Beleg Teleutosporen gefunden werden. Diese Belege wurden mit dem Typ von C. anemiae Henn. verglichen und es wurde keine Übereinstimmung festgestellt. Wahrscheinlich ist die gefundene Art mit C. cenicafeae Salazar & Buriticá konspezifisch, einer neu aus Kolumbien beschriebenen Art, von welcher der der Typ nicht ausleihbar ist. Der Zweitautor dieser Art hat vor einigen Jahren, begründet auf in Ketten stehenden Teleutosporen, die neue Gattung Uncol und neue Familie Uncoleae [sic] für das Teleutostadium von Calidion beschrieben. Die vom Autor gefundenen Teleutosporen sind zweizellig, gestielt und nicht in Ketten angeordnet. Wahrscheinlich liegt in der Erstbeschreibung eine Fehlinterpretation vor, leider konnte auch zu dies...|$|E
