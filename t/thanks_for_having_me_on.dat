2500|$|In the post-fight interview, an {{emotional}} Fury said, [...] "This {{is a dream}} come true. We worked so hard for this. I've done it. It's hard to come to foreign countries ‎and get decisions. It just means {{so much to me}} to come here and get the decision." [...] He then took the microphone to thank Klitschko, [...] "I'd like to say to Wladimir, you're a great champion. And <b>thanks</b> very much <b>for</b> <b>having</b> <b>me.</b> It was all fun and games during the buildup." [...] Klitschko failed to throw his well-known right hand, mostly due to Fury's constant movement and mocking. He said, [...] "Tyson was the faster and better man tonight. I felt quite comfortable in the first six rounds, but I was astonished that Tyson was so fast in the second half as well. I couldn't throw my right hand because the advantage was the longer distance he had." [...] Klitschko had a rematch clause in place.|$|R
40|$|Most of all, {{thanks to}} my {{supervisor}} Scott Sanner. I’m rather certain that I won’t {{be able to get}} more support than what I’ve had throughout this year.

Thanks to Scott for guiding me through this wonderful task with vast knowledge and kindness. Thanks to Joel Veness for the friendly conversation on the implementation issue of MCTS based Go engine. Also <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> letting <b>me</b> <b>have</b> access to his code of Goanna, a well formulated MCTS based Go engine with great performance which <b>have</b> helped <b>me</b> a lot in the process of implementing GoYui. Thanks to Hendra and Zhe, my friends of whom I got courage to work through this year.

I would like to express my gratitude to Professor Joachim Speidel for giving me the oppor-tunity to work under his supervision. I owe him special <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> confidence in <b>me</b> and offering me the freedom to develop own ideas. His door was always open for fruit-ful discussions and advice. Furthermore, he sharpened {{my way of thinking}} towards a clear and scientific perspective.

I {{would also like to thank}} Professor Bin Yang for the assessment of this thesis and his valu-able comments. Warm thanks go to all my former colleagues at the INÜ.

To my committee, <b>thanks</b> <b>for</b> <b>having</b> faith in <b>me.</b> You all could <b>have</b> kicked <b>me</b> out after that first candidacy exam, but you saw some potential in me. I don’t think I’ve fully realized the potential and when I do it’s going to be a sight to behold. Vicki, you were a grea...|$|R
