40|$|The {{growth of}} {{transportation}} poses difficult dilemmas {{for social and}} environmental policy. There is broad agreement {{that a variety of}} 'carrot' and 'stick' measures are needed. This article asks whether tax-free travel vouchers for employees could be important as incentives or 'carrots' to encourage the use of public transport. The basic idea of it is like Luncheon Vouchers for public transport. Employers issue the vouchers and claim the tax back from the Government. Potentially, travel vouchers could generate a 'win-win' situation in which transport operators' rising revenues justified new services and these, in turn, encouraged more passengers. The research described here uses survey data and the National Travel Survey to examine acceptability and potential fiscal impact of a rural tax-free <b>travel</b> <b>voucher</b> scheme throughout the UK. These results show that there is sufficient acceptance of the idea of travel vouchers in rural areas to justify the further development of this policy. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{additional}} help document is to clarify the financial aspects Office of Civilian Response (OCR) travel advances. Background The Office of Civilian Response (OCR) was created within USAID/DCHA to coordinate USAID's Agency-wide efforts to "assist foreign states and regions at risk of, in, or in transition from conflict or civil strife. " USAID is one of nine civilian US Government Agencies tasked with providing these services worldwide. OCR both supports and manages these inter-agency deployments around the globe. This support includes both the rapid deployment of the Civilian Response Corps (CRC) as well as logistical and financial management support. Many of these deployments are to regions where direct support from either an existing in-country USAID Mission or U. S. Embassy is limited and where our deployed personnel operate in cash economies where neither credit cards, travelers checks nor banking services are available. In a typical scenario, CRC personnel will be deployed to an area experiencing civil strife or another situation that has undermined host country government operations or effectiveness. Travel authorizations will be created in Washington, and CRC personnel {{will be brought to}} Washington for training and preparation. Upon departure from Washington, these employees are issued a cash travel advance. Subsequent advances may be issued by the supporting Mission, Embassy or M/CFO/CMP. Frequently, cashier support is difficult to provide and does not consistently deliver the required amounts of cash to the deployed personnel. The availability of transportation varies and the employee has to journey long distances, sometimes across international borders, to file a <b>travel</b> <b>voucher</b> and request an advance to replenish their cash. Where personnel are operating under such conditions, the following procedures are being implemented to minimize the amount of time the employee is taken away from the job, to establish safeguards to minimize the risk of loss or theft of the USG funds, and to further the accomplishment of the USAID mission...|$|E
