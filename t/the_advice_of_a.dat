5|$|After leaving Hull, Harries {{moved to}} London {{to work for}} the Southern News Service news agency, writing diary pieces for the Daily Mail and News of the World from 1975 to 1976. On <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> friend, he applied for a {{position}} as a researcher for Granada Television in Manchester. He did not understand the appeal of television production, and as a result he was turned away at two interviews before being hired in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Animal Rights Without Liberation {{is based}} upon Cochrane's {{doctoral}} thesis, completed at the London School of Economics (LSE) {{under the supervision of}} Cécile Fabre, with Paul Kelly acting as an advisor. The thesis was examined by Anne Phillips and Albert Weale, the former of whom suggested the title which was used for the book. The arguments in the book differ from the arguments in the thesis, however, and in preparing the manuscript for publication, Cochrane drew upon <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> number of academics, especially Robert Garner.|$|E
5|$|Following this, Wilfrid {{moved to}} a ranch in the {{emerging}} settlement of Orion, Alberta with his family on <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> neighbor; the farming of wheat was a predominant activity. However, following a major crop failure in 1917, he became the town's bank clerk after employment in a convenience store, but later left for Kronau, Saskatchewan due {{to a combination of}} poor business and boredom; the family ranch was later abandoned in 1923. After skipping several years of high school education through a fast-track course at Regina College, Eggleston enrolled for a Bachelor of Arts program at Queen's University in 1926.|$|E

5|$|Sober {{for four}} years {{by the time he}} began his second tenure with the Flames in 2013, McGrattan had also become a mentor and friend to former Nashville {{teammate}} Jordin Tootoo in his own efforts to overcome similar addictions. McGrattan's experiences led to a desire to help others; he partnered with the NHL substance abuse program to act as a mentor for others who wanted <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fellow player, and plans to spend his off-seasons earning a university degree in addiction counseling. McGrattan is also an advocate for anti-bullying charities and volunteers with Be The Game, a camp that supports underprivileged kids.|$|E
5|$|The king of {{one country}} {{threatened}} by the imminent arrival of the stoor worm sought <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> wise man or spaeman, who suggests that the beast might be appeased if it is fed seven virgins every week.

5|$|Upon {{his return}} from Maranhão, Caxias saw that the {{political}} climate had changed. Francisco de Lima's Liberal Party had pushed through the premature declaration of the Emperor's majority on 23 July 1840. In May 1842, the Liberals rebelled in the provinces of Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and Minas Gerais {{in retaliation for the}} Emperor's decision—on <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Council of State dominated by Reactionaries—to call for new elections, annulling the previous election tainted by widespread fraud by the Liberal Party.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Morrissey {{was greatly}} {{interested}} in film, television and Gene Kelly musicals. After seeing a broadcast of Kes on television, {{he decided to}} become an actor. At his primary school, St Margaret Mary's School, he was encouraged by a teacher named Miss Keller, who cast him as the Scarecrow in a school production adapted from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz when he was 11 years old. Keller left the school soon after, leaving Morrissey without encouragement. His secondary school, De La Salle School, had no drama classes and {{was the sort of}} place where Morrissey thought the fear of bullying dissuaded pupils from participating in lessons. On <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cousin, Morrissey joined the Everyman Youth Theatre. For the first couple of weeks, he was quite shy and did not join in the workshops. When he eventually participated, he appeared in the youth theatre's production of Fighting Chance, a play about the riots in Liverpool. He went to the theatre on Tuesday and Wednesday nights.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the release}} of Pixies' debut mini-album Come On Pilgrim in October 1987, Ivo Watts-Russell, head of 4AD, {{suggested}} they return to the studio to record a full-length album. The original plan was to record new material at Fort Apache Studios, where the band had produced The Purple Tape and Come On Pilgrim. However, due to differences between the band's manager Ken Goes and The Purple Tape producer Gary Smith, Pixies ended up {{looking for a new}} producer and recording studio. On <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 4AD colleague, Watts-Russell looked to hire Steve Albini, ex-frontman of Big Black, as the record's engineer and producer. Having sent a pre-release tape of Come On Pilgrim to Albini, Pixies' manager, Ken Goes, invited him to a Boston dinner party at drummer David Lovering's house a few weeks after Come On Pilgrims release.|$|E
5|$|Henry begins time {{traveling}} {{at the age}} of five, jumping forward and backward relative to his own timeline. When he leaves, where he goes, or how long his trips will last are all beyond his control. His destinations are tied to his subconscious—he most often travels to places and times related to his own history. Certain stimuli such as stress can trigger Henry's time traveling; he often goes jogging to keep calm and remain in the present. He searches out pharmaceuticals in the future that may be able to help control his time traveling. He also seeks <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> geneticist, Dr. Kendrick. Henry cannot take anything with him into the future or the past; he always arrives naked and then struggles to find clothing, shelter, and food. He amasses a number of survival skills including lock-picking, self-defense, and pickpocketing. Much of this he learns from older versions of himself.|$|E

5|$|Lindwall {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} play in the Lancashire League in England during the Australian winter of 1952, joining Nelson Cricket Club for a sum of 600 pounds and bonuses, which did not include the boat fares for him and his wife. Lindwall took 96 wickets at 8.37 during the season and developed an inswinger on <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> local umpire who adamantly refused to give leg before wicket decisions to outswingers. Lindwall returned to Australia with a newborn son who has been born during his stay in Lancashire, and he was greeted by media speculation as to whether his professional sojourn had improved or detracted from his capabilities. Lindwall's form leading into the Tests against South Africa in 1952–53 prompted observers to opine that he was bowling better than ever, reinforced with the inswinger and his trademark Yorker. Lindwall made 70 from a total of 148 on a sticky wicket against South Australia in Adelaide that led Miller to regard it as the best innings he had seen under such conditions. He made the score after being sent in to open the batting in the absence of Sid Barnes.|$|E
5|$|Wetherall {{was one of}} 19 senior first-team {{players to}} be laid off by {{chairman}} Richmond in May 2002, after the club were put into administration and the players unpaid since April. Those players {{went as far as}} taking strike action before a pre-season friendly at Hull City, even though Wetherall, as their Professional Footballers' Association representative, had initially denied they would do so, before the club was saved and players reinstated. Wetherall played in the club's opening game of the season as Bradford drew 0–0 with Wolverhampton Wanderers live on television, but was again ruled out through an injury, this time to his hip. A planned comeback was put off five weeks later, before he sought <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> specialist in Denmark. After sitting out another three months through injury, Wetherall made his return as a substitute against Gillingham in December 2002 but was again injured in a reserve team comeback three days later. He again returned in February 2003 against Coventry City and played 15 games during the final three months of the season.|$|E
5|$|Without {{a steady}} income, his {{financial}} situation began to deteriorate. He began submitting his poems to more prominent literary magazines, including Scribner's Monthly, but {{was informed that}} although he showed promise, his work was still short of the standards required for use in their publications. Locally, he was still dealing with the stigma of the Poe plot. The Indianapolis Journal and other newspapers refused to accept his poetry, leaving Riley desperate for income. In January 1878 on <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> friend, Riley paid an entrance fee to join a traveling lecture circuit where he could give poetry readings. In exchange, he received {{a portion of the}} profit his performances earned. Such circuits were popular at the time, and Riley quickly earned a local reputation for his entertaining readings.|$|E

5|$|However, Nosanchuk {{was still}} not certain that he would attempt to defend Lamb on mental grounds. In Ontario at that time, a {{defendant}} found not guilty under these terms remained imprisoned indefinitely unless an order for his release came from the province's Executive Council, acting on <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Review Board including a Supreme Court Judge. Yaworsky warned Nosanchuk {{that even if he}} used an insanity defence and won, Lamb would probably be committed to an institution for the criminally insane for life. It was still possible for the lawyer to approach the prosecution and propose a plea bargain, offering to plead guilty to non-capital murder, which would result in life imprisonment for Lamb but allow a parole hearing after 10 years. In any case, Nosanchuk could not use the case he had prepared unless he first received unequivocal written instruction from his client to plead insanity. Having been given a week by his counsel to consider the matter, Lamb wrote to Nosanchuk that he wished to attempt a mental disorder defence. The boy made clear his understanding that if he were found not guilty under these terms, the state still had the right to detain him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|On Hutton's {{return to}} England, {{he was made}} an honorary member of the MCC, which changed its rules to allow a current {{professional}} to join the club. The selectors appointed him England captain for the entire forthcoming series against South Africa, a rare indication of confidence. After a poor start to the season, Hutton captained MCC against the tourists, but withdrew from {{the final day of}} the match with lumbago. His uncertain health led him to resign the England captaincy. The selectors made Peter May captain in his place and appointed Hutton as a selector. Hutton played for Yorkshire until the end of June. Against Nottinghamshire, he scored 194 in five hours, his final first-class century. His last 100 runs came in an hour. After the following match, his back was too painful to continue and he did not play again that season. In eleven first-class matches, he scored 537 runs at an average of 29.83. In June, he was knighted for services to cricket. Following <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> specialist, Hutton announced his retirement from first-class cricket in January 1956. He was 39, an early retirement age for the period. He played one further match in 1957 for MCC against Lancashire, and two matches in 1960 for MCC and L. C. Stevens' XI. In all first-class cricket, he scored 40,140 runs at an average of 55.51 with 129 hundreds.|$|E
5|$|Reye's syndrome, a rare but severe illness {{characterized}} by acute encephalopathy and fatty liver, can occur when children or adolescents are given aspirin for a fever or other illness or infection. From 1981 through 1997, 1207 cases of Reye's syndrome in people younger than 18 {{were reported to}} the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of these, 93% reported being ill in the three weeks preceding the onset of Reye's syndrome, most commonly with a respiratory infection, chickenpox, or diarrhea. Salicylates were detectable in 81.9% of children for whom test results were reported. After the association between Reye's syndrome and aspirin was reported, and safety measures to prevent it (including a Surgeon General's warning, and changes to the labeling of aspirin-containing drugs) were implemented, aspirin taken by children declined considerably in the United States, as did the number of reported cases of Reye's syndrome; a similar decline {{was found in the}} United Kingdom after warnings against pediatric aspirin use were issued. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration now recommends aspirin (or aspirin-containing products) should not be given to anyone under the age of 12 who has a fever, and the British Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency recommends children who are under 16 years of age should not take aspirin, unless it is on <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> doctor.|$|E

5|$|The series {{revolves}} around the lives of Jaypaw, Lionpaw and Hollypaw, kits of Brambleclaw and Squirrelflight and grandchildren of the ThunderClan leader Firestar. The three slowly {{come to terms with}} their unique paths in life; Lionpaw worries about his thirst for blood on the battlefield, Hollypaw considers {{what it means to be}} truly loyal to her Clan, and Jaypaw is bitter that he was born blind. One day, Jaypaw unintentionally discovers a prophecy that he believes refers to him and his siblings. The three attempt to understand their new destinies, and realize that Lionpaw has the power to never be harmed in battle, whilst Jaypaw can walk in the dreams and read the minds of other cats. Hollypaw, on the other hand, struggles to determine what her unique power is. Hollypaw and Lionpaw are made warriors, becoming Hollyleaf and Lionblaze respectively, whilst Jaypaw becomes a medicine cat and is later given the name Jayfeather. They seek <b>the</b> <b>advice</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mysterious loner named Sol, who promises to give them the answers to their destinies; however, they eventually realize him to be a deceptive liar, and he is banished from the forest. Although uncertain of their powers, the three cats are always secure in the knowledge that they are deeply loved by their parents. This safe haven is shattered when they are forced into a fire by Ashfur, another ThunderClan warrior. Ashfur wishes to murder the three cats in order to punish their mother, Squirrelflight, for rejecting his love years earlier. However, Squirrelflight admits that the three cats are not her offspring, and Ashfur lets them go. The siblings are deeply distressed by this confession, and attempt to discover who their true parents are. They eventually learn that their mother is Leafpool, the ThunderClan medicine cat, and their father is Crowfeather, a WindClan warrior. Hollyleaf is devastated by this, and murders Ashfur in revenge. Unsatisfied, she then publicly announces to the rest of the Clans the true story of her heritage. When the Clans do not praise her for her honesty, but rather react with shock and confusion, Hollyleaf runs away into a series of collapsing tunnels. Presuming her to be dead, and numb with grief for their sister, Lionblaze and Jayfeather realize that Hollyleaf never had a power in the first place. They instead turn their eyes to two kits newly born in the Clan, one of whom could fulfill the third role in the prophecy.|$|E
