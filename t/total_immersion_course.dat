This research focuses on the spiritual dimension of human transformation through swimming. METHOD: To measure whether the spirituality of the focus group (participants of <b>Total</b> <b>Immersion</b> <b>course)</b> is present and in which quality and quantity was used the method of scale enquiry and the method of free word assosiations and uncompleted clauses. RESULTS: The participants of the TI course tend to experience the spirituality for 75 %. They reveal their own potential through improving swimming skills and they find the fusion with water as a transcendental experience. CONCLUSION: In light of the sport spirituality {{we see that the}} human qualities that are developed in sport activities are identical with these that are typical for spiritual life - discipline, paying attention, enthusiasm and endurance...|$|E

40|$|During {{the past}} decades, little {{research}} has investigated the effects of immersion scheduling on the psychology classroom. Therefore, we sought to compare academic performance of students in 2 -week <b>immersion</b> psychology <b>courses</b> to that of students in traditional 16 -week courses. In Study 1, students who received instruction in a 2 -week <b>immersion</b> <b>course</b> signifi-cantly outperformed their cohorts in a traditional 16 -week course. In order to address potential limitations in the first study, in Study 2, we controlled for individual differences variables (e. g., cumulative grade point average), and results indicated significantly higher academic performance for students in the 2 -week <b>immersion</b> <b>course.</b> In both studies, students in the <b>immersion</b> <b>courses</b> consistently evaluated the courses and their instructors significantly higher than those students in the 16 -week courses. In light of our results and in contrast to critics, <b>immersion</b> <b>courses</b> may be useful and effective when teaching psychology.

40|$|Metadata onlyThe water {{absorption}} (WA) by <b>total</b> <b>immersion</b> and by capillary rise of concrete containing metakaolin (MK) is investigated. Cement was partially replaced {{with up to}} 20 % MK. The {{results show that the}} presence of MK is greatly beneficial in reducing the WA by capillary action. There is a systematic reduction in absorption by capillary action with the increase in MK content in concrete. This reduction is further supported by visual examination of specimens. The absorption by <b>total</b> <b>immersion,</b> however, tends to increase slightly with the increase in MK content. Between 14 and 28 days curing, there is a slight increase in absorption by <b>total</b> <b>immersion</b> and by capillary rise for all MK concretes.

This paper focuses on the experiences of faculty and the responses of students {{who took part in}} several <b>immersion</b> service-learning <b>courses</b> taught between 2005 and 2007 during the Winter term at Elon University in North Carolina. Four major themes were identified as being significant in these immersion service-learning courses: 1) sharing living space impacts the student-faculty relationship, 2) immersion faculty leaders are placed in multiple roles with multiple opportunities for role modeling, 3) immersion faculty experience their own transformative learning, which often further complicates their roles as leaders, and 4) immersion faculty leaders often experience role conflict in maintaining leadership roles and assessing student work in <b>immersion</b> <b>courses.</b> We conclude that while the role conflicts must be negotiated faculty modeling service behavior may have stronger lessons for students and their future civic engagement than other on-campus service learning <b>courses.</b> <b>Immersion</b> service-learning describes <b>courses</b> where students and faculty participate together in a service project {{for an extended period of}} time, workin...|$|R
