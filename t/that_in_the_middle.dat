The US Chevrolet Caprice PPV was different to its Australian and Middle Eastern counterparts in that the lower front bumper {{is based on the}} Commodore Omega Series II front-end, and the interior is also from the Commodore Omega, the low-end trim of the VE Commodore that is used by law enforcement in Australia and New Zealand. The 9C3 Detective version used the same interior as <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Middle</b> Eastern-spec Caprice LS.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the success}} of The 400 Blows, Truffaut {{featured}} disjunctive editing and seemingly random voice-overs in his next film Shoot the Piano Player (1960) starring Charles Aznavour. Truffaut has stated <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of filming, {{he realized that he}} hated gangsters. But since gangsters were a main part of the story, he toned up the comical aspect of the characters and made the movie more attuned to his liking. Even though Shoot the Piano Player was much appreciated by critics, it performed poorly at the box office. While the film focused on two of the French New Wave's favorite elements, American film noir and themselves, Truffaut never again experimented as heavily.|$|E

Hilde relays <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the night she and her siblings were awakened {{by the sound of}} sirens. Her parents and the other tenants of her home were forced to stand for a roll call in which Pesendorfer, the Nazi authority in their house, told the tenants that many Russian convicts had escaped from the nearby concentration camp. He explained that it was their duty to Germany to find and kill each one of these convicts. Hilde, being a young girl, is told to stay at the house. However, she is worried about protecting her brother Hannes, who, like her other brothers, is forced to search for prisoners, and sneaks away to find him.|$|E
25|$|Alienation was {{not always}} possible, and {{sometimes}} {{the permission of the}} lord was required. It is the opinion of Pollock and Maitland <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the 13th century the tenant enjoyed a large power of disposing of his tenement by act inter vivos, though this was subject to some restraints in favor of his lord. Other opinions have been expressed. Coke regarded the English tradition as one of ancient liberty dictated by custom. The tenant had relative freedom to alienate all or part of his estate. Blackstone was of a differing conclusion. The “learning of feuds” started with the inalienability of the fief as a starting point. Pollock and Maitland believe Coke’s opinion to be the more valid one. Both views may have been true. Modern scholars may have given more weight to the written and declared law of the Normans than existed in reality.|$|E

It was evidently a site for Muslim pilgrimage at that time.|$|E

500|$|Ultimately, {{not only}} did Warner end up {{coaching}} at Iowa State before his time at Georgia; but while in Athens, he also received weekly updates from Iowa and sent back telegraphs with detailed advice for the following week. One story recounts <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of September (just before leaving for Georgia), Warner took his team north west for a previously agreed-upon game against the Butte Athletic Club of [...] Butte, Montana. Apparently overconfident, Warner bet the entire sum of his Iowa State wages [...] $150 (Approximately $4,000 in 2016), on his team's victory. At halftime, his team trailed 210 against a clearly superior team. Warner decided to enter the game, filling in at the guard position. Though this had a positive impact, [...] it was not sufficient as his team still lost 1012. In order {{to try and make}} up for losing all of his Iowa State wages, Warner worked out a deal where, for $30 (approximately $800 in 2016), he would stay in contact with Iowa State while at Georgia.|$|E
500|$|Toby Whithouse {{originally}} planned {{to write a}} different episode, but Moffat and Wenger thought it was too similar to other episodes in the series and Whithouse wrote [...] "The Vampires of Venice" [...] instead, while his original episode was pushed to the next series.

Moffat figured <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the series a viewer could [...] "start watching it again" [...] and that it should be [...] "something romantic and funny". For the next episode, Moffat asked comedy writer Simon Nye to write a story that challenged the relationship between Amy and the Doctor. The episode, titled [...] "Amy's Choice", was intended to be Amy's decision between excitement with the Doctor or life with Rory. The scene in which Rory dies in the false reality was intended to be when Amy realised her feelings for him. Nye wanted to stress that Amy really did love Rory and he was not [...] "just a cypher boyfriend or fiancé".|$|E
500|$|The {{origins of}} the church are unclear. The Domesday survey of 1086 records the {{presence}} of a priest at Astbury, but not a church. The discovery nearby of fragments of stone with apparent Saxon decoration, coffin lids, and the lower stages of a cross– all of which might date from before the Norman conquest– suggest that an earlier church may have been on the site. The earliest fabric in the present church is a round-arched doorway. Architectural historian Andor Gomme dates this from about the middle of the 12thcentury and states that at that time the church would have been a simple rectangular building, and mainly timber-framed. [...] Gomme suggests further <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of the 13thcentury the east end of the church would have been rebuilt in stone, with a chancel and sanctuary. Subsequently {{the rest of the body}} of the church was built, consisting of the nave and north and south aisles; the work was completed in the 14thcentury. The tower was built towards the end of the 13thcentury, not in the usual position at the west end of the church but to the north of the west bay of the north aisle, separated from it by a distance of [...] During the 14thcentury the south porch, with its priest's room or treasury in the top storey, was added. It is not known whether the tower's spire was built in the 14th or the 15thcentury.|$|E

500|$|Elgar's best-known {{works were}} {{composed}} within the twenty-one years between 1899 and 1920. Most {{of them are}} orchestral. Reed wrote, [...] "Elgar's genius rose to its greatest height in his orchestral works" [...] and quoted the composer as saying that, even in his oratorios, the orchestral part is the most important. The Enigma Variations made Elgar's name nationally. The variation form was ideal for him {{at this stage of}} his career, when his comprehensive mastery of orchestration was still in contrast to his tendency to write his melodies in short, sometimes rigid, phrases. His next orchestral works, Cockaigne, a concert-overture (1900–1901), the first two Pomp and Circumstance marches (1901), and the gentle Dream Children (1902), are all short: the longest of them, Cockaigne, lasting less than fifteen minutes. In the South (1903–1904), although designated by Elgar as a concert-overture, is, according to Kennedy, really a tone poem and the longest continuous piece of purely orchestral writing Elgar had essayed. He wrote it after setting aside an early attempt to compose a symphony. The work reveals his continuing progress in writing sustained themes and orchestral lines, although some critics, including Kennedy, find <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> part [...] "Elgar's inspiration burns at less than its brightest." [...] In 1905 Elgar completed the Introduction and Allegro for Strings. This work is based, unlike much of Elgar's earlier writing, not on a profusion of themes but on only three. Kennedy called it a [...] "masterly composition, equalled among English works for strings only by Vaughan Williams's Tallis Fantasia." [...] Nevertheless, at {{less than a quarter of}} an hour, it was not by contemporary standards a lengthy composition. Gustav Mahler's Seventh Symphony, composed at the same time, runs for well over an hour.|$|E
