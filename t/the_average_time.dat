40|$|Abstract: In this paper, <b>the</b> <b>average</b> travel <b>time</b> over a link is {{considered}} as a random variable following an identical probability distribution as the arrival process. A new estimation method of <b>the</b> <b>average</b> travel <b>time</b> was proposed by using the cross-correlation analysis of traffic flow measurement data. By using the proposed estimation method, it only requires the traffic flow information, which is available through the measurements of single-loop detectors at the upstream and downstream of one link. Different from the existing maximal cross-correlation analysis method, this paper considers <b>the</b> <b>average</b> travel <b>time</b> as a random variable with its mean value estimated from all significant cross-correlation coefficients rather than only using the maximum cross-correlation coefficient. Therefore, the inherent variability of <b>the</b> <b>average</b> travel <b>time</b> among different vehicles can be considered. Moreover, different from the existing optimization method, the statistical t-test of the significant cross correlation coefficients is used to automatically and adaptively determine the fitting range of the probability density function of <b>the</b> <b>average</b> travel <b>time.</b> Thus, it avoids using the approximated car length factor and has no need to pre-determine the range of <b>the</b> <b>average</b> travel <b>time</b> {{as required by the}} optimization method. In this paper, the details of <b>the</b> <b>average</b> travel <b>time</b> estimation procedures are presented and the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through both simulation study and a case study of real traffic data...|$|R
