Upon a failure of a critical part in a system during the <b>exploitation</b> <b>phase,</b> the failed part is replaced by a ready-for-use part from a spare parts inventory. In an out-of-stock situation, a costly emergency procedure is applied. The reliability levels and spare parts inventory levels of the critical components are the two main factors that determine the downtime and corresponding costs of the sys- tems. We introduce a quantitative model for the joint optimization of these two levels. We formulate the portions of Life Cycle Costs (LCC) which are affected by a compo- nent's reliability and its spare parts inventory level. These costs consist of design costs, production costs, and maintenance and downtime costs in the <b>exploitation</b> <b>phase.</b> We conduct exact analysis and provide an efficient optimization algorithm. In our numer- ical experiment which is based on real-life data, our method leads to significant cost reductions in comparison to a method that ignores costs in the <b>exploitation</b> <b>phase</b> when the reliability level is determined. We also show that the optimal reliability level also strongly depends on the component type (cheap or expensive), the size of installed base, the downtime penalty rate, and the lifetime of the system in our experiment...|$|R

Algorithms in this field aim to find the optimizer of the function by requesting only a few function evaluations at carefully selected lo-cations.

In this paper, we assume the unknown function is Lipschitz continuous. Leveraging the Lipschitz property, we propose an algorithm with a distinct exploration phase followed by an <b>exploitation</b> <b>phase.</b> The exploration phase aims to select samples that shrink the search space as much as possible, while the <b>exploitation</b> <b>phase</b> focuses on the reduced search space and selects samples closest to the optimizer.

40|$|The {{fishing pattern}} of {{individual}} beam trawl vessels comprises alternating searching and <b>exploitation</b> <b>phases</b> during a fishing trip.

The <b>exploitation</b> <b>phase</b> {{is characterized by a}}n above average-catch rate and a small inter-haul distance. During the exploitation of a local concentration of flatfish, the catch rate decreases on average by 10 % over a period of 48 h. The rate of decline {{is a function of the}} engine power. Powerful vessels experience a small or no decline in catch rate, whereas less powerful vessels experience a decline of up to 16 %. It is inferred that the decline in catch rate may be due to interference competition among vessels through a change in the behaviour of flatfish in response to fishing disturbance, although a reduction in local abundance may also have contributed to the decline. Areas with above-average catch rates may change on a weekly basis...|$|R

ABC algorithm {{is one of the most}} popular and youngest member of the family of population based nature inspired meta-heuristic swarm intelligence method. ABC has been proved its superiority over some other Nature Inspired Algorithms (NIA) when applied for both benchmark functions and real world problems. The performance of search process of ABC depends on a random value which tries to balance exploration and <b>exploitation</b> <b>phase.</b> In order to increase the performance it is required to balance the exploration of search space and exploitation of optimal solution of the ABC.

The proposed method is named as Crossover based ABC (CbABC). The CbABC strengthens the <b>exploitation</b> <b>phase</b> of ABC as crossover enhances exploration of search space.

For this purpose the ROI detection has to be fast and reliable. It is used as an efficient data reduction device to speed up subsequent <b>exploitation</b> <b>phases</b> without loss of relevant information. Usually two complementary error classes are distinguished: class alpha (an interesting image domain was not detected) and class beta (an irrelevant image domain (clutter) has been labeled), P errors lead to an increased analysis workload in subsequent <b>exploitation</b> <b>phases.</b> In unfavorable cases much too many image domains are labeled and hence the ROI detection is ineffective. a errors are even more problematic since omissions cannot be compensated in subsequent evaluation. The quality (efficiency and effectiveness) of the MMO detection restricts the ultimate achievable system performance and hence determines the possible application fields (e. g. on-board or ground based ATR). The optimization trade off between a and P demands for application specific solutions...|$|R

30|$|In essence, the <b>exploitation</b> <b>phase</b> {{is similar}} to the {{profiling}} phase in nature. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy during different kinds of attacks and also during the <b>exploitation</b> <b>phase.</b> Gruss et al. [19] demonstrated that Prime+Probe attack incurs a larger number of cache misses for the attacker as well as the victim when compared to Flush+Reload attack. This is because both the attacks are similar in approach. The attacker fills the last-level cache with his data and waits for the victim to use the cache. Prime+Probe operates at a higher granularity of cache sets compared to Flush+Reload which operates on cache addresses. After the prime phase, the victim incurs cache misses since the attacker would have placed his data in the cache. During the probe phase, the attacker would have cache misses if the victim accessed the data in the meantime. The authors also propose a variant of the Flush+Reload attack called Flush+Flush, which relies only on the execution time of the flush instruction. However, this attack can be easily mitigated by fixing the execution time of the instruction without hampering the performance of the system.|$|R
