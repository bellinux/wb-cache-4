In this tank, several chemicals are added to enable sulphide flotation in three Outotec Denver flotation cells, targeting removal of arsenopyrite. The sulphide concentrate (floats) is pumped to the thickener for disposal, and the underflow (roaster feed) is dewatered using a filter belt. In the soft granite the arsenic occurs mainly as scorodite, which cannot be floated.|$|E

The complex consists of the Kemess South open pit mine and a 52, 000 tonnes per day mill. Hypogene, supergene and leach cap ores are processed using conventional crushing, grinding, and flotation techniques to produce gold-copper concentrates with minor by-product silver value. The rougher flotation concentrate is re-ground in closed circuit before being cleaned to final concentrate grade. Historically, gold losses in the cleaner tailings were primarily associated with pyrite, with only minor amounts of free gold. More recently, with the processing of high pyrite ores, the major losses were found to be free gold less than 10 microns in size. The fine grind required for the high pyrite ores resulted in over-grinding of the free gold particles in <b>the</b> <b>regrind</b> circuit, contributing to poor flotation characteristics. It was thought that if this free gold could be recovered by gravity at coarser size in <b>the</b> <b>regrind</b> circulating load, the free gold losses in the cleaner tailings could be reduced...|$|E

It {{was identified}} that potential improvements in recoveries {{were to be}} found in the better use of <b>the</b> <b>regrind</b> stages at a number of Anglo-Platinum concentrators. Historically, these concentrators used to operate in an open circuit configuration, over a relatively short period, the circuits were changed to closed circuit configurations because of the reported benefits of operating in this configuration. The effect of closing the circuit had, however not been quantified in these concentrators. This dissertation looks at quantifying the effects of each configuration with the purpose of drawing meaningful comparisons between them. The circuit configurations studied are open circuit, I-stage and 2 -stage closed circuit configurations. The primary difference between these configurations is the network of hydrocyclones. This study pays special attention to the effect of cyclone performance on <b>the</b> <b>regrind</b> circuit performance. Comparisons were made between the open and the 2 -stage closed circuits in three concentrators, and surprisingly the closed circuit did not show any improvement over the open circuit configuration from a combination efficiency perspective. The cyclones performance was analysed, and it was observed that the cyclones were operating inefficiently, most likely because the cyclones employed were not appropriate for regrind circuits. A further comparison was made between the I-stage and 2 -stage circuit configurations and the I-stage closed circuit configuration proved to be more efficient than the 2 -stage closed circuit configuration. Simulations were conducted to predict the performance of the circuit configurations by using more appropriate cyclones which are smaller in size. These cyclones are currently being used in a similar application in another concentrator. The simulations indicated that significant improvements in comminution performance could be realised with the utilisation of more appropriate cyclones, to achieve the closed circuit configuration...|$|E
40|$|Regrinding rougher {{flotation}} concentrates {{is typically}} used to liberate valuable minerals from gangue {{prior to the}} cleaner separation stage in processing of low grade ores. Compared to the rougher flotation after primary grinding, it is usually more challenging to achieve a satisfactory performance in post-regrind cleaner flotation especially when fine particles are generated. One main factor which results in this reduction in flotation is the unsuitable particle surfaces produced after regrinding. However, this factor is not usually considered when designing and optimizing <b>the</b> <b>regrinding</b> process. Extensive {{studies have demonstrated that}} grinding chemistry can influence mineral floatability. However, earlier studies focused on primary grinding and rougher flotation rather than regrinding and cleaner flotation.

40|$|The final degree {{project for}} a Bachelor of Science in Mining and Mineral Engineering {{has been carried}} out at Boliden Mineral AB between April and June 2013. The report {{describes}} the history and geology of the mines of Boliden, origin and the development of one of the largest metal-mining companies in Europe - Boliden Mineral AB. In the Boliden area there are many important ore fields which contain gold, zinc, copper, silver and lead. The objective of this project was to investigate and provide the guidelines for the improvement of <b>the</b> <b>regrinding</b> in <b>the</b> ball mill in the Concentrator flotation circuit having influence on metal recovery. The report follows the ore flow from the mine, through the Concentrator and finally to the end product, concentrates. The evaluation leads to conclusions which parameters may affect the concentration process negative. It was discovered that there are problems with the ore stockpiles at the mine and the segregation of the fractions in the silos. It is proposed to install a cone {{on the top of the}} silos to reduce segregation of ore fractions. To reduce this problem Boliden should install a mobile conveyor on the way to the silos and to the ore stockpiles in the mine. This method has been successfully installed at the Aitik ore stockpiles near the new Concentrator. The main task of the thesis was to analyze metal distribution in the flotation circuit, especially technical analysis of <b>regrinding</b> effects on <b>the</b> results of flotation. The analysis of the sampled pulp from the flotation process was done in the Mineral Processing Laboratory and in the Process Laboratory in Boliden. The analytical equipment such as X-rays and ICP were used for metal analysis and QEMSCAN was used for mineralogical determinations analyses. Theoretical calculations and results of conducted laboratory experiments suggests that <b>regrinding</b> in <b>the</b> ball mill has a positive effect on the flotation process, but some improvement is required, especially <b>the</b> <b>regrinding</b> of <b>the</b> gangue particles. This process helps to liberate all metal particles and improves results of metal recovery.

40|$|The {{reprocessing}} of injection-molded polycarbonate was {{studied in}} an attempt to understand the physical background for the variation of its performance upon sequential molding cycles. The effect of reprocessing on different properties of the moldings and <b>the</b> <b>regrind</b> is presented and discussed. A quantitative analysis of the Fourier transform IR spectra indicates that phenol and carbon dioxide are released during the initial cycles, probably due to molecular scission near the chain ends. Most of the results obtained agree well with the findings reported elsewhere. Essentially, the molecular weight, the free volume, and the specific volume were found to be critical properties for understanding the global performance of the moldings. Both the free volume and the reciprocal of the molecular weight depend linearly on the number of reprocessing cycles. Based on these properties, it is possible to develop relatively simple relations to estimate the variation of the rheological, optical, and mechanical properties with the number of reprocessing operations...|$|E
40|$|Nchanga copper ore is {{a complex}} mixture of {{sulphide}} and oxide minerals and processing consists of sulphide flotation followed by sulphidisation and an oxide flotation step. The copper oxides have proved difficult to recover. The reason for poor recovery {{has been attributed to}} complex mineralogical characteristics of the ore. Previous laboratory test work carried out on the ore showed an improvement in the flotation recovery of oxide minerals after regrinding the sulphide rougher tails with mild steel media. However, further investigation showed that the increase in recovery was not due to increased liberation. This indicated that the increase was due to some other factors resulting from <b>the</b> <b>regrind,</b> such as change in the chemical environment. The influence of grinding media on the pulp chemical conditions and the resulting flotation performance of Nchanga underground copper ore has been studied to understand how grinding media affect the chemical conditions of the pulp. The media employed were stainless steel and mild steel, which created different chemical conditions in the pulp as measured by dissolved oxygen (DO), oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) and pH. Better overall flotation performance was obtained in pulp ground by stainless steel media than by mild steel media. There was an improvement in the recovery of both sulphide and oxide minerals in the oxide flotation stage after regrinding by mild steel media. Stainless steel regrind did not increase the recovery but improved the grade of the oxide minerals in the oxide flotation stage. However, the flotation recovery of copper obtained after regrind by mild steel media was almost the same as that obtained without regrind by stainless steel media again indicating that the increased recovery obtained was not due to increased liberation. Several interesting observations concerning pulp chemistry measurements are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} data of hydrocyclones in circuits containing a gravity induced mill (hereafter {{referred to as}} a stirred mill) were evaluated to understand their performance in the circuits and the current operational practices. There are many studies conducted to understand and evaluate the hydrocyclone performances in the semi-autogenous mill (SAG) and ball mill circuits. The literature on hydrocyclone operation in stirred milling circuits is still limited. A database consisting of various hydrocyclone sizes, operating conditions, classification duties, and commodities was developed based on extensive circuit surveys. The database was used to evaluate the hydrocyclone performance. Among the key operational issues observed were poor circuit control strategies, improper hydrocyclone sizing and operation in the roping condition. Analysis of long-term operational data indicated that hydrocyclone feed solid density is an essential operating variable that needs to be controlled to maintain the cut size. An increase in hydrocyclone feed density leads to an increase in cut size. Almost 50 % of the hydrocyclones (in the database) were operating in the roping condition. Besides the hydrocyclone feed solid density, high amounts of fine particles (− 25 μm) in the hydrocyclone feed also caused the roping condition. Further research is required to operate the hydrocyclone in a spraying condition when the feed has high solid-density and a high content of fines. Plitt’s cut size model was fitted to the data set to evaluate its capability {{to be used in the}} stirred mill’s hydrocyclone. The analysis shows the Plitt’s model can predict the cut size when the hydrocyclone is in spraying mode. This result indicates that Plitt’s model can be used for <b>the</b> <b>regrind</b> duty hydrocyclones. An empirical model was developed relating the hydrocyclone feed density and the Plitt onset roping hydrocyclone underflow density. This model can be used to predict the roping condition. Finally, the impact of hydrocyclone performance on circuit performance was compared through the size specific energy of the mill. High size specific energy values were observed when the hydrocyclone is operating in the roping condition. These findings are based on the real operating condition, and it shows the importance of operating the hydrocyclone optimally to achieve overall circuit efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{flotation}} tests using {{a bottom}} driven cell are reproduced {{with a high}} level of confidence. These types of laboratory data are used to investigate the effect of reagent and regrinding of coarse particles in an industrial flotation circuit. The addition of collector (BX) has a significant effect on the flotation response of chalcopyrite in the scavenger bank. The reconstructed recovery-time curve (combine products) is greater than that of the rougher tailings (scavenger feed) prior to reagent addition. By adding collector (BX) in the scavenger feed, the ultimate recovery of chalcopyrite increases 20 % which means an increase of 1. 7 % of chalcopyrite recovery in the scavenger feed. Meanwhile, the reagrinding of coarse particles shows a detrimental effect on the collectorless flotation of an initially hydrophobic chalcopyrite sample. Cyclone underflow, 80 % recovery at pH 7. 7, was decreased to 40 % after <b>regrinding</b> at <b>the</b> same range of pH. The chalcopyrite flotation response immediately after regrinding is severely retarded. It is assumed that the centrifugal action of the cyclone is another important factor restoring the chalcopyrite hydrophobic flotation due to the oxygenation of the slurry. Therefore, additional preconditioning time after a regrinding stage should have a positive change in the recovery of chalcopyrite. The overall flotation response before and after <b>the</b> <b>regrinding</b> stage showed that the cyclone underflow response is slightly slower compared with the combine feed in the first four minutes of flotation. This behavior is related to changes on surface chemistry because of <b>the</b> <b>regrinding</b> of coarse particles...|$|R
40|$|At Newcrest 2 ̆ 7 s Telfer gold mine, a {{strategy}} of regrinding pyrite rougher flotation concentrates has been proposed to incr ease gold recovery and reduce cyanide consumption in the CIL circuit. The r egrinding {{will be followed by}} an additional copper/ gold flotation stage, where copper minerals need to be separated from pyrite. However, although the minerals are well liberated, the separation of chalcopyrite from pyrite in the cleaner stage is not always straightforward. The surfaces of the fine particles, produced during regrinding, are more easily oxidised and contaminated than coarse particles, directly influencing the particle floatability. The depression of pyrite is difficult in the cleaner stage as well due to copper activation, a process which is also highly dependent on the grinding environment.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} {{was to determine if}} the preparation of a cattle finishing ration has any effect on its digestibility and feed efficiency. Twenty head of yearling Hereford steers were individually fed for 140 days. The steers were divided into five treatments of four animals each. All rations contained the same ingredients and differed only in the way they were prepared. The five rations were prepared as follows: (1) ground through 1 / 8 inch screen and pelleted, (2) ground through 2 / 8 inch screen and pelleted, (3) ground through 3 / 8 inch screen and pelleted, (4) ground through 3 / 8 inch screen pelleted and reground, (5) ground very course and not pelleted. The rations contained 67 percent No. 2 yellow corn, 25 percent sun cured baled alfalfa hay, 2. 5 percent soybean oil meal, 5 percent molasses and 0. 5 percent dicalcium phosphate. Each steer received as much feed as it could readily consume without wastage. The chromic oxide technique was used in determining the apparent digestibility coefficients. Digestibility of crude fiber was significantly higher in the coarsely ground ration than in <b>the</b> pelleted rations. <b>Regrinding</b> <b>the</b> pelleted ration reduced the digestibility of the other extract in the ration. No significant difference was found in the digestibility of dry matter, crude protein and energy; however, <b>the</b> <b>regrinding</b> of <b>the</b> 3 / 8 inch ground and pelleted ration (Ration 4) resulted in lower digestion coefficients for these nutrients. There {{was no significant difference in}} rate of gain or efficiency of feed utilization between treatments; however, animal variation was great within treatments.

The feed required per 100 pounds of gain was 857, 921, 787, 837, and 794 pounds respectively for Rations 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

Xanthate collectors {{were found to be}} unselective for the flotation of the Rosh Pinah composite sample. It was observed that the recovery of sphalerite increased with both the recovery of galena and the concentrate mass pull. In addition, the recovery of sphalerite increased after activation with Cu(II) ions while that of galena decreased when the composite was dry ground in a mild steel mill with mild steel grinding media. However, the recovery of galena was not affected after wet milling in a stainless steel mill. The recovery of Cu(II) -activated sphalerite was independent of the milling environment (wet or dry) and grinding media. The activation of sphalerite by cuprous cyanide complexes, which are present in the recycled water, was clearly shown in this study. Both batch flotation tests and XPS analysis have confirmed that sphalerite was activated by copper(I) from the cuprous cyanide complexes. The recovery of copper(I) -activated sphalerite increased further when the composite was dry milled as compared to wet milling. Batch flotation tests have shown that the use of cyanide alone is not efficient for the depression of sphalerite due to the mineralogical texture of the Rosh Pinah ore. A large quantity of galena locked and/or attached to sphalerite was observed in the lead concentrate. Their prevalence increased with increasing particle size.

Observation continued during {{the research}} and meant taking part in morning meetings and observing other daily operations. Numerical data showed the efficiency of the current extrusion process. Working in the production made it possible to see the production process from inside. The interviews and the analysis helped to discover the main development issues in the current state. Literature was used for surveying the requirements for the closed-loop system, for the concept of process-orientated thinking, elements of extrusion and for the study of plastics recycling. The literature about Lean-Philosophy was also important for this research. The most important results of the research concern development issues and recommendations of the raw material purchase, inventory and material management, the production process, recycling, information flows and daily management. Main problems were related to the lack of systematic and studied methods. Also <b>the</b> use of <b>regrind</b> requires scientifically studied and tested ratios, because its mechanical and processing properties (for instance MFI and bulk density) change during recycling. It was also noted that the performance of employees affects strongly the performance of the extrusion process due to its manual nature. The first recommendation is to correct issues relating to the sources of scrap because biggest financial benefits are related to it. Also <b>the</b> study on <b>regrind</b> ratios should start as soon as possible. This may require forming a project team due to the extent of the topic. The secondary proposal is to carry out issues that facilitate recycling and help to achieve a closed-loop system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Starch in grains {{represents}} {{the main source}} of dietary energy for monogastric production animals. However, utilization of this energy is not complete due to factors related to grain source and in vivo gastrointestinal conditions. Incomplete starch digestion is a significant economic issue for the pork industry in Australia and prior evidence suggests that there is room for improvement. The general hypothesis of this thesis is that milled grain particle size fractions obtained by sieving posses a significantly different and wide range of functional and compositional properties in relation to digestion and hydrothermal processing. To identify these properties, sorghum and barley grains were milled separately using a 4 mm hammer-mill and then the ground cereals were segregated by size using a series of analytical sieves. Generated different particle sizes were investigated for their properties before and after cooking using extrusion processing. Sorghum was used {{as an example of a}} high starch content grain with low fibre content and barley was used as an example of a grain which contains high levels of fibre. Both grains are widely used as major feed ingredients in Australia, particularly in Queensland. Particle Size Effect on Digestibility The effect of milled uncooked grain particle size on the kinetics of enzymatic starch digestion and starch sources was examined. The in vitro starch digestion for different particle sizes were well fitted by simple first order kinetics for both barley (r 2 range 0. 90 - 0. 99) and sorghum (r 2 range 0. 87 - 0. 99). The digestion rate coefficients for different particle sizes decreased with increasing particle size, and were shown to be well fitted by an inverse square relationship for both barley (r 2 = 0. 99) and sorghum (r 2 = 0. 98). This supports the hypothesis that the rate-determining step in starch digestion is the diffusion of enzyme through the grain fragment. Quantitatively, the estimated (apparent) diffusion coefficient was estimated for both barley and sorghum (1. 7 and 0. 76 x 10 - 7 cm 2 s- 1, respectively). The apparent diffusion coefficient of á- amylase enzyme in grains was lower by an order of magnitude than that obtained in water, thus quantifying the barriers to amylase diffusion caused by grain structure. Particle Size Distribution in Milled Grain The contribution of individual size fractions to the overall hydration, rheological, and enzyme susceptibility properties of milled grain was evaluated. Sieve fractions were obtained from hammer-milled barley and sorghum grains (eight sieves, 0. 125 mm to 2. 8 mm opening size). Different particle size fractions showed a significant effect on digestion and hydrothermal properties. The extent of starch digestibility varied between different particle size up to 10 fold between the smallest and the largest particle size. When the results obtained for the unfractionated milled grain were compared to the weight average values (calculated from fraction yields and property values for each size fraction), water absorption index (WAI), water solubility index (WSI), and starch digestibility values were not significantly different from values obtained for non-fractionated ground grains of both barley and sorghum. Generally, hydration and digestibility results can be attributed to particle size and composition (starch or soluble fibre) of individual fractions. Response to hydrothermal treatment was different between sorghum and barley. In sorghum, viscosity profiles for the fractions were controlled by starch swelling which became increasingly limited as particle sizes increased. However in barley, viscosity profiles for segregated fractions did not show typical starch-based behaviour and were most likely controlled by the soluble fibre component. The results show the possibility of predicting and manipulating hydration and digestibility properties of ground grains simply by indentifying the particle size distribution of ground grains. Extrusion Processing of Milled Grain Extrusion processing was used in attempts to increase the rate and extent of starch digestibility as well as to characterize processing parameters and extrudate properties. Extrusion processing of three levels of particle size after sieve fractionation (fine, medium and coarse fractions) affected processing parameters (torque, specific mechanical energy [SME], die pressure), extrudate properties (WAI, WSI, expansion index, pasting profiles, and the kinetics and extent of starch digestion). The differences in response to processing parameters and extrudate properties was mainly due to the differences in viscosity during extrusion, while extrusion temperature (100 °C versus 140 °C maximum barrel temperature) had a smaller effect. The different particle size fractions of sorghum and barley both before and after extrusion showed a good fit to first-order kinetics of starch digestion, with all r 2 values above 0. 95. Results of the extrusion experiment suggested that the extent of swelling and gelatinisation during the extrusion may have been further improved by incorporating a pre-conditioning stage prior to extrusion. Particle size had a significant effect on the fractional digestion rate for both grains, but extrusion temperature had no effect. Based on fractional digestion rate values, extrusion processing at low temperature (100 °C) could be an alternative method to fine milling for achieving a high rate and extent of starch digestion. Feed Conversion in Pigs A novel processing procedure, based on separating the coarse fraction after hammer milling and then regrinding this fraction, was used in an attempt to improve growth performance in pigs offered barley and sorghum based diets. The pig feeding trial examined the effect of (a) grain type (barley; sorghum), (b) particle size (ground grain; ground grain where the coarse fraction was separated and re-ground then added back to the fine fraction), and (c) diet form (mash, pellet), on feed conversion ratio (FCR), rate of growth (ROG) and average daily intake (ADI). Particle size had the largest effect on FCR in pigs. Feeding pigs a barley or sorghum based diet in the mash form after <b>regrinding</b> <b>the</b> coarse fraction improved FCR in sorghum by 10 % and in barley by 7. 8 % compared to diets prepared without <b>regrinding</b> <b>the</b> coarse fraction. The form of the diet showed a smaller effect on FCR. In the pellet form, pigs fed sorghum or barley based diets after <b>regrinding</b> <b>the</b> coarse fraction improved FCR in sorghum by 5. 1 % and in barley by 4. 8 % compared to diets prepared without <b>regrinding</b> <b>the</b> coarse fraction. Within grain type, effects of particle size or diet form on ROG and ADI in barley were not statistically significant, although their ratio (FCR) did show significance. In sorghum, pigs offered diets in the ground-mash form had the highest ADI. Pigs offered ground-mash form (ground grain where the coarse fraction was separated and re-ground then added back to the fine fraction) had the highest ROG. The results from this investigation suggest that <b>regrinding</b> <b>the</b> coarse fraction after sieve separation can be used to maximise feed conversion ratio (FCR) for both barley and sorghum based diets. In contrast to single stage grinding through a smaller screen size, <b>the</b> <b>regrinding</b> method used in this work did not result in major increases in fractions with sizes below 0. 5 mm and particularly below 0. 25 mm. This is important as these very small particles cause dust problems in handling and on ingestion. Desired hydration properties, chemical composition, response to hydrothermal treatment, and extent of starch digestion could be manipulated by modifying the distribution of particular size fractions of ground grains. Extrusion of medium and coarse size fractions can enhance digestibility with efficient utilization of thermal energy compared to extrusion of ground but unfractionated grains. This could be a good processing strategy as this work has found that the rate and extent of starch digestion is relatively high for uncooked small particle size fractions. Alternatively, <b>regrinding</b> <b>the</b> coarse fraction after separation could be an alternative method to conventional steam pelletizing for increasing starch digestibility and energy delivery to growing pigs...|$|R

These two types of mills present different particle breakage mechanisms and redox environments during grinding. In this study, <b>the</b> effect of <b>regrinding</b> with these two types of mills on the separation of chalcopyrite from pyrite in the cleaner stage was studied.

The mechanism underpinning this phenomenon was investigated by a range of techniques including dissolved oxygen demand measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). It was found that the two mills produced different surface oxidation and pyrite activation by copper ions which determined the separation of chalcopyrite from pyrite.

40|$|As ore {{deposits}} become finer grained <b>the</b> {{requirements for}} <b>regrinding</b> before cleaning or leaching have increased substantially. Despite this increasing need, {{there is no}} standard test to predict grinding energy requirement below 70 microns. The standard Bond Mill test applies for coarser ball milling, but is not appropriate tor stirred milling with fine media grinding to 70 microns. With no industry - standard test, the energy requirement is often {{made on the basis}} of supplier estimates or benchmarking against similar applications. Yet suppliers use vastly different scale-up methods which result in widely different energy estimates. Estimates can differ by 100 - 300 % even for similar mills. This must result in serious errors to install either too much or too little grinding power. This paper explores this by comparing the actual performance of full scale regrind mills against their original design estimate. It confirms that serious scale-up errors have been made, and have then been perpetuated by "benchmarking". The test conditions to achieve accurate power estimation are discussed. The essential test conditions are: continuous (not batch) tests, ensure steady state (no coarse fraction retained in test mill), correctly account for classification, measure energy directly (not inferred), and using the same media size as the full scale installation. Failure to correctly address even one of these factors can bias results by 40 %; failure to address several multiplies the error...|$|R
