40|$|Chocolate bar {{games are}} {{variants}} {{of the game}} of Nim in which {{the goal is to}} leave your opponent with the single bitter part of the chocolate bar. The rectangular chocolate bar game is a thinly disguised form of classical multi-heap Nim. In this work, we investigate the mathematical structure of <b>triangular</b> chocolate <b>bar</b> games in which the <b>triangular</b> chocolate <b>bar</b> can be cut in three directions. In the <b>triangular</b> chocolate <b>bar</b> game, a position is a P-position if and only if x ⊕ y ⊕ z = 0, where the numbers x,y,z stand for the maximum number of times that the chocolate bar can be cut in each direction. Moreover, the Grundy number of a position (x,y,z) is not always equal to x ⊕ y ⊕ z, and a generic formula for Grundy numbers in not known. Therefore, the mathematical structure of <b>triangular</b> chocolate <b>bar</b> game is different from that of classical Nim. Comment: 33 page...|$|R

40|$|Background: Modifications defined to ease bending of the <b>support</b> <b>bar</b> {{and lateral}} {{stabilizer}} placement during minimal invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE) {{have not been}} reported. We herein report our experience with MIRPE including several technical modifications. Methods: A total of 87 patients who underwent MIRPE were evaluated retrospectively. Technical modifications are (1) a template drawn preoperatively according to the anthropometric measurements, (2) more laterally placed thoracal incisions, (3) single existing incision for multiple <b>support</b> <b>bars,</b> (4) to secure lateral stabilizers to <b>support</b> <b>bar</b> in inverted position. Results: The mean patient age was 11. 2 ± 3. 8 years. The mean operating time was 63. 7 ± 18. 7 min. The mean Haller index was 5. 4 ± 2. 1. Eight patients necessitated two <b>support</b> <b>bars.</b> The <b>support</b> <b>bars</b> were removed in 69 patients {{after the completion of}} treatment. <b>Support</b> <b>bars</b> were left in place 26. 8 ± 4. 3 months. Final chest contours of the 56 patients were evaluated as 12 months passed after <b>support</b> <b>bar</b> removal and excellent repair results were determined in 84. 2 %. Conclusion: Preoperative bending of the <b>support</b> <b>bar</b> according to anthropometric measurements and fixation of the lateral stabilizers to the <b>support</b> <b>bar</b> in inverted position facilitates bar shaping and lateral stabilizer placement...|$|R

30|$|This {{category}} signifies a {{case where}} many corporate actors may benefit from the user-driven innovations (often without any acknowledgement, credit or benefit/knowledge sharing). The users also may not {{go out of their}} way to share. Many roadside mechanics routinely modify the features of various automobiles or gadgets which the manufacturer may not have taken note of. For instance, the cycle manufacturers have generally ignored a feature of footrest for children sitting on the horizontal bar. Their legs do not reach the mudguard or the triangular rod. Mechanics add a simple strip which can be horizontal to the <b>triangular</b> <b>bar</b> and, when turned at 90 °, becomes a footrest. The design of the cycle has not changed nor the users have pursued with the manufacturers to bring about this and other features. So much of design inertia can be explained by mutual apathy.|$|R

40|$|The {{cross section}} of main frame {{structure}} is preferable to be a cylinder for plants and animals in order to adapt to their environment. There are some exceptionals. One of those is a hemp palm branch. It has an up side-down isosceles triangular shape. Since the hemp palm branch has unusually large leaves and a relatively slender branch stem as compared with other trees, the branches must be subjected a large twisting moment. A triangular cross section reinfored by a functionally graded distribution of fibers must be a solution for that problem, which can reduce the induced stress. This paper presents a torsional analysis of a <b>triangular</b> <b>bar</b> based on the 2 -layerd model. Deriving an analytic solution using conformal mapping and complex warping function, the stress distributions and torque were computed. The two layerd bar reduced the maximum shear stress {{as compared with the}} one of a homogeneous bar...|$|R

5000|$|For {{dowel bar}} retrofit, dowels, bond breaker, {{expansion}} caps, dowel <b>bar</b> <b>support</b> chairs, foam core insert, caulking filler, non-shrink concrete backfill material and submittals are needed. The dowels {{need to be}} smooth, round, epoxy and made of bond breaker coated steel conforming to requirements. The bond breaker {{is to be applied}} on all surfaces of the dowel bar. The expansion caps belong {{at each end of the}} dowel bar and the dowel <b>bar</b> <b>support</b> chairs are used to firmly hold the dowels centered in the slots during backfill operations. The foam core insert is used to re-establish the joint or crack, which allows the bar within each side of the slot to expand and contract. The caulking filler is used to prevent backfill material from flowing into the joint or crack. Non-shrink concrete backfill material that is tested as rapid set concrete patching materials is recommended for use on DBR projects.|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{suggest a}} custom <b>bar</b> <b>supported</b> overdenture {{treatment}} modality for prosthodontic management {{of patients with}} severe gag reflex. Background: Some patients have a severe gag reflex and cannot tolerate conventional maxillary complete dentures with maximum palatal coverage and extensions of all borders. The condition further gets complicated in patients suffering from respiratory problems along with severe gag reflex. Severe gagging acts {{as a barrier to}} treat such patients with accepted clinical procedures and prevent patients from wearing the prosthesis. By saving some of the remaining natural teeth and fabricating, a horse shoe shape palateless simple tooth or <b>bar</b> <b>supported</b> overdenture can be successfully used for treating such patients. Materials and Methods: The remaining maxillary right and left canines were prepared with the tapered round end diamond bur to receive copings of custom bar after intentional root canal treatment of same teeth. Impression was made with light body and putty of the polyvinyl siloxane elastomer with double step putty wash technique. Impression was poured with die stone. Wax pattern of copings with bar was fabricated with inlay wax which was invested and casted. After retrieving the bar, it was finished and its fit was evaluated. The coping-bar assembly was finally cemented with the glass ionomer cement. Palateless overdenture was fabricated by conventional technique used for the fabrication of complete denture. Conclusion: Palateless custom <b>bar</b> <b>supported</b> overdenture procedure can be successfully used for the management of patients with severe gag reflex with improved denture retention, stability, chewing efficiency and comfort of the patient...|$|R
