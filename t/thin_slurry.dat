The paste is then watered down to a <b>thin</b> <b>slurry</b> and passed through a sieve and into cheesecloth, with which it is {{squeezed}} dry. This produces a fine crumbly paste, which is then mixed with sugar or other sweeteners and often oil to produce a smooth, sweet paste.|$|E

He ground the soft local chalk together with alluvial clay from the Medway estuary and added water in a washmill to produce a <b>thin</b> <b>slurry</b> from which coarse particles could be removed by settling. The fine, homogenous mixture of chalk and clay particles was dried to a stiff plastic consistency before being burned in a kiln. He thus emulated the natural process of sedimentary formation of a marl.|$|E
5000|$|Glaze is a glassy coating on pottery, {{the primary}} {{purposes}} {{of which are}} decoration and protection. One important use of glaze is to render porous pottery vessels impermeable to water and other liquids.

The colour of a glaze {{after it has been}} fired may be significantly different from before firing. To prevent glazed wares sticking to kiln furniture during firing, either {{a small part of the}} object being fired (for example, the foot) is left unglazed or, alternatively, special refractory [...] "spurs" [...] are used as supports.

Use of mechanical agitation generally enhanced mixing performance and the oxygen transfer capability relative to when mechanical agitation was not used; however, the oxygen transfer efficiency was reduced by mechanical agitation. The overall volumetric gas–liquid mass transfer coefficient declined with the increasing concentration of the cellulose fiber solids; however, the mixing time in these strongly shear <b>thinning</b> <b>slurries</b> was independent of the solids contents (0 – 4 % w/v).

5000|$|Modern beveled {{glass is}} machine made. The {{automation}} of this traditionally hand made craft was {{facilitated by the}} development of plastic based metal deburring wheels which provided adequate smoothing of the ground glass face without the difficulties involved with traditional aluminum oxide and natural sandstone smoothing stones. The best natural smoothing stones came from a quarry in Newcastle, England and would be round wheels with a central hole several feet in diameter and 8" [...] thick. The stone's quality was dictated by the consistency of the sandstone, as any imperfection would scratch the glass being smoothed. These large stones would smooth the rough scratches created by the grinding process. The type of grinding and smoothing equipment depended upon whether one was creating straight line, outside or inside curved bevels. Outside curves and straight lines are ground on a flat rotating platter covered in a <b>thin</b> <b>slurry</b> of silicon carbide and water. Inside curves were ground on a silicon carbide grinding wheel of appropriate grit with water running on the wheel. Smoothing the ground face was done using the Newcastle stone for outside curves and straight line bevels and a cone shaped polishing wheel of relatively fine grit aluminum oxide. Despite the advantages of the plastic smoothing wheels, the crispness of the bevel edge is superior on the stone smoothed traditionally beveled pieces and can distinguish hand made beveled glass. The final step was polishing the beveled face using a felt covered wheel with a slurry of water and optical polishing powder. It was not uncommon to have pieces with a combination of outside and inside curve as well as straight line bevels. The objective was to have an even bevel width, even edge thickness with no facets in the bevel face and a crisp bevel edge. In the early 1900s in USA it was not uncommon to see beveled oval door glass 5' in length with 2" [...] wide bevels on 3/8" [...] thick plate glass. Creating such bevels required two craftsmen working as a team.|$|E
50|$|The {{synthesis}} (in this case, of carbon-14-labelled material) {{can be seen}} {{in figure}} 1. In the first step, o-nitroaniline (compound 1) is purified through dissolution in hot water-ethanol mixture in relation 2:1. carbon is added and the result is filtrated for clarifying. The filtrate is chilled while kept in movement to generate crystals, usually at 4 °C, but if needed it can also be cooled to -10 °C. The crystals are then collected, washed and dried. If it is pure enough it is used for the following steps, which take place at 0 till 5 °C. To produce o-Nitrobenzonitrile-14C (compound 2), the first component o-nitroaniline and (concentrated reagent grade) hydrochloric acid are put together with ice and water. Sodium nitride, dissolved in water, is added to this <b>thin</b> <b>slurry.</b> After the formation of a pale-yellow solution, which indicates the completion of the diazotization reaction, the pH should be adjusted to 6. After this, the solution is introduced to a mixture of cuprous cyanide and toluene. At room temperature the toluene layer is removed. The aqueous layer is washed and dried and the purified product is isolated by crystallization. The third product is Anthranilamide-14C (compound 3). It is formed out of o-Nitrobenzonitrile-14C, which is first solved in ethanol and hydrazine hydrate. The solvent is heated subsequently, treated in a well-ventilated hood with small periodic charges, smaller than 10 mg, of Raney nickel. Under nitrogen atmosphere the ethanolic solution is clarified and dried. The next step is to form 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4(3H)-one-14C (compound 4). In water dissolved sodium nitrite is added to anthranilamide and hydrochloric acid in ice water. Because this is a diazotization reaction, the product is pale-yellow again. After this the pH is adjusted to 8,5. This causes the ring closure to form 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4(3H)-one-14C. This results in a sodium salt slurry that can be treated with hydrochloric acid, what lowers the pH down to 2 till 4. The 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4(3H)-one-14C is collected, washed and dried. In the following step 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4-(3-chloromethyl)-one-14C has to be formed. Therefore, 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4(3H)-one-14C and paraformaldehyde are added to ethylene dichloride and heated to 40 °C. Then thionyl chloride is added and the whole solvent is further heated to 65 °C. After four hours of heating the solution is cooled down to room temperature. Water is added and the solution is neutralized. The ethylene dichloride layer is removed and put together with the result of the washed aqueous layer. The solvent was filtered and dried. The last step is the actual synthesis of Azinphos methyl. Ethylene dichloride is added to the compound resulting from the fifth step, 1,2,3-Benzotriazin-4-(3-chloromethyl)-one-14C. This mixture is heated to 50 °C and sodium bicarbonate and O,O-dimethyl phosphorodithioate sodium salt in water are added. The ethylene dichloride layer is removed, reextracted with ethylene dichloride and purified by filtration. The pure filtrate is dried. This product is once again purified by recrystallization from methanol. What is left is pure azinphos-methyl in form of white crystals.|$|E

50|$|It is {{essential}} that large particles (> 150 μm for calcium carbonate and > 45 μm for quartz) should be eliminated from the rawmix, to facilitate chemical combination in the kiln. In the case of slurries, larger particles can be removed by hydrocyclones or sieving devices. These require {{a certain amount of}} energy, supplied by high pressure pumping. This process, and the moving and blending of the slurry, require careful control of the slurry viscosity. Clearly, a <b>thinner</b> <b>slurry</b> is easily obtained by adding more water, but at the expense of high energy consumption for its subsequent removal. In practice, the slurry is therefore made as thick as the plant equipment can handle. Cement rawmix slurries are Bingham plastics which can also exhibit thixotropic or rheopectic behaviour. The energy needed to pump slurry at a desired rate is controlled mainly by the slurry's yield stress, and this in turn varies more or less exponentially with the slurry solids/liquid ratio. In practice, deflocculants are often added in order to maintain pumpability at low moisture contents. Common deflocculants used (at typical dose rates of 0.005-0.03%) are sodium carbonate, sodium silicate, sodium polyphosphates and lignosulfonates. Under favourable circumstances, pumpable slurries with less than 25% water can be obtained.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} constant volume <b>thin</b> film <b>slurries</b> on an incline. Clear fluids in this geometry {{are known}} to have a front position that moves according to a t 1 / 3 scaling law, based on similarity solution analysis [Huppert, Nature, 1982]. We investigate the same dynamics for particle laden flow using a recently proposed lubrication model for the slurry and physical experiments. Our analysis includes the role of a precursor in the model. We conclude that in the lubrication model, the height of the precursor significantly influences the speed of the fluid front, independent of particles settling in the direction of flow. By comparing theory with experiments we conclude that the t 1 / 3 scaling law persists, to leading order, for slurry flows with particle settling. However additional physics is needed in the existing lubrication models to quantitatively explain departures from clear-fluid self-similarity due to particle settling...|$|R

40|$|Two {{commercial}} ammonia (NH 3 ) analysers were customised {{to allow}} continuous measurements of vertical concentration gradients. The gradients {{were used to}} derive ammonia exchange fluxes above a managed grassland site at Oensingen (Switzerland) by application of the aerodynamic gradient method (AGM). The semi-continuous measurements during 1. 5 years covered five complete growth-cut cycles and included six applications of liquid cattle slurry. The average accuracy of the flux measurements during conditions of well established turbulence was 20 % and the detection limit 10 ng NH 3 m&minus; 2 s&minus; 1 , hence sufficient for studying the background exchange of NH 3 . Quantifying emissions after slurry applications required the application of elaborate interpolations because of difficulties capturing the initial emissions during manure spreading {{in some parts of}} the experiments. The emissions were also calculated with a mass balance method (MBM) yielding similar fluxes. NH 3 losses after slurry application expressed as percentage of emitted nitrogen versus applied total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) varied between 4 and 19 %, which is lower than typical values for broadspreading of liquid manure. The comparatively low emission factors appear to be a consequence of the rather <b>thin</b> <b>slurry</b> applied here and soil properties favouring ammonium adsorption...|$|E

40|$|Flowsheet {{testing was}} {{performed}} to develop the nitric-glycolic-formic acid flowsheet (referred to as the glycolic-formic flowsheet {{throughout the rest of}} the report) as an alternative to the nitric/formic flowsheet currently being processed at the DWPF. This new flowsheet has shown that mercury can be removed in the Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) with minimal hydrogen generation. All processing objectives were also met, including greatly reducing the Slurry Mix Evaporator (SME) product yield stress as compared to the baseline nitric/formic flowsheet. Forty-six runs were performed in total, including the baseline run and the melter feed preparation runs. Significant results are summarized. The baseline nitric/formic flowsheet run, using the SB 6 simulant produced by Harrell was extremely difficult to process successfully under existing DWPF acceptance criteria with this simulant at the HM levels of noble metals. While nitrite was destroyed and mercury was removed to near the DWPF limit, the rheology of the SRAT and SME products were well above design basis and hydrogen generation far exceeded the DWPF SRAT limit. In addition, mixing during the SME cycle was very poor. In this sense, the nitric/glycolic/formic acid flowsheet represents a significant upgrade over the current flowsheet. Mercury was successfully removed with almost no hydrogen generation and the SRAT and SME products yield stresses were within process limits or previously processed ranges. The glycolic-formic flowsheet has a very wide processing window. Testing was completed from 100 % to 200 % of acid stoichiometry and using a glycolic-formic mixture from 40 % to 100 % glycolic acid. The testing met all processing requirements throughout these processing windows. This should allow processing at an acid stoichiometry of 100 % and a glycolic-formic mixture of 80 % glycolic acid with minimal hydrogen generation. It should also allow processing endpoints in the SRAT and SME at significantly higher total solids content and may be effective at acid stoichiometries below 100 %, although no testing was performed below 100 % acid stoichiometry. There are several issues related to the development of the glycolic-formic flowsheet. First, the measurement of anions using the new glycolate anion procedure likely needs to be optimized to improve the accuracy of the anions important to DWPF processing and REDOX prediction. Second, the existing REDOX equation with an added term for glycolate did not accurately predict the glass REDOX for the glycolic-formic flowsheet. Improvement of the anion measurement or modification of the REDOX methodology or equation may be necessary to improve the REDOX prediction. Last, the glycolic-formic flowsheet dissolves a number of metals, including iron. This leads to a <b>thinner</b> <b>slurries</b> but also dissolves up a portion of the iron, which is currently used for criticality control. It is recommended that DWPF continue to support development of the glycolic-formic flowsheet. This flowsheet meets or outperforms the baseline flowsheet in off-gas generation, mercury removal, product rheology and general ease of processing. Additional testing is in progress to demonstrate the effectiveness of the nitric-glycolic-formic flowsheet in processing a wide sludge processing window using the matrix sludge simulants...|$|R

Testing was initiated to determine whether the elimination of formic acid from the DWPF&#x 27;s chemical processing flowsheet would eliminate catalytic hydrogen generation.

40|$|Graduation date: 1999 Effects {{of three}} mulches of tree foliage and twigs (red alder, Douglas-fir, and salal) and homogenized, {{partially}} decomposed material (forest floor) on soil macronutrients (Ca, K, Mg, P, NO 3, and NH 4) were evaluated {{in the summer}} of 1997. These effects were measured with buried, coated ion-exchange resin bags at two different times (2 and 12 weeks) and at two different depths (2 and 15 cm) in homogenized soil cores. Over the time of this study various mulches had no significantly different impact on nutrient ions sorbed on the buried resins. The results indicated that {{in the early stages of}} decomposition, chemical differences in the plant material evaluated do not differentially influence soluble nutrients sorbed on buried resins. However, some of this lack of difference may have been due to the preparation of the mulches. The preparation included chopping and shredding, which may have eliminated differences that exist in a more natural setting. The effect of forest floor material was significant on three of six response variables. The interaction of forest floor and mulch was significant for all variables except K. Whether the interaction decreased or increased the mean amount of a given response variable was dependent on the type of mulch material. The exception was NO 3, which in all cases increased in the presence of forest floor in combination with mulch. The results indicate that microbial populations that reside in the forest floor interact differently with the types of plant mulches placed over them. The effect of time was significant for all response variables with K, Ca, and Mg responding in a proportional manner. Nitrate and ammonium concentrations increased exponentially over time, which indicated a rather vigorous biological population involved in decomposition of nitrogen-containing organic compounds. The effect of depth was significant for all variables except for P. More nutrients accumulated at the 15 cm depth than at the 2 cm depth, which was not expected. This possibly indicates high immobilization due to microbes at the surface. The results of P may have been due to the type of resin used and the pH of the soil cores. The results suggest that forest floor material has more influence with above ground additions of soil macro-nutrients than fresh plant material. However, the detected interactions of these two types of materials suggest that ion cycling can be influenced very early in the litter decomposition process. A second study tested the effect of saturated soil coated resin bags versus non-coated bags. The results strongly suggest that the effect of coating resin bags with a <b>thin</b> <b>slurry</b> of saturated soil paste significantly decreases variation in tests of Ca, Mg, NO 3, and NH 4. The minimal amount of work with this procedure suggests that it is advantageous for evaluating most macro-nutrients with resin bags, particularly NO 3 and NH 4...|$|E
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{work performed}} {{during the second}} year of the project ''Modified reverse osmosis system for treatment of produced waters. '' We performed two series of reverse osmosis experiments using very thin bentonite clay membranes compacted to differing degrees. The first series of 10 experiments used NaCl solutions with membranes that ranged between 0. 041 and 0. 064 mm in thickness. Our results showed compaction of such ultra-thin clay membranes to be problematic. The thickness of the membranes was exceeded by the dimensional variation in the machined experimental cell and this is believed to have resulted in local bypassing of the membrane with a resultant decrease in solute rejection efficiency. In two of the experiments, permeate flow was varied {{as a percentage of the}} total flow to investigate results of changing permeate flow on solute rejection. In one experiment, the permeate flow was varied between 2. 4 and 10. 3 % of the total flow with no change in solute rejection. In another experiment, the permeate flow was varied between 24. 6 and 52. 5 % of the total flow. In this experiment, the solute rejection rate decreased as the permeate occupied greater fractions of the total flow. This suggests a maximum solute rejection efficiency for these clay membranes for a permeate flow of between 10. 3 and 24. 6 % of the total; flow. Solute rejection was found to decrease with increasing salt concentration and ranged between 62. 9 % and 19. 7 % for chloride and between 61. 5 and 16. 8 % for sodium. Due to problems with the compaction procedure and potential membrane bypassing, these rejection rates are probably not the upper limit for NaCl rejection by bentonite membranes. The second series of four reverse osmosis experiments was conducted with a 0. 057 mm-thick bentonite membrane and dilutions of a produced water sample with an original TDS of 196, 250 mg/l obtained from a facility near Loco Hill, New Mexico, operated by an independent. These experiments tested the separation efficiency of the bentonite membrane for each of the dilutions. We found that membrane efficiency decreased with increasing solute concentration and with increasing TDS. The rejection of SO{sub 4 }{sup 2 -} was greater than Cl{sup -}. This may be because the SO{sub 4 }{sup 2 -} concentration was much lower than the Cl{sup -} concentration in the waters tested. The cation rejection sequence varied with solute concentration and TDS. The solute rejection sequence for multi-component solutions is difficult to predict for synthetic membranes; it may not be simple for clay membranes either. The permeate flows in our experiments were 4. 1 to 5. 4 % of the total flow. This suggests that very thin clay membranes may be useful for some separations. Work on development of a spiral-wound clay membrane module found that it is difficult to maintain compaction of the membrane if the membrane is rolled and then inserted in the outer tube. A different design was tried using a cylindrical clay membrane and this also proved difficult to assemble with adequate membrane compaction. The next step is to form the membrane in place using hydraulic pressure on a <b>thin</b> <b>slurry</b> of clay in either water or a nonpolar organic solvent such as ethanol.

In the present study, the optimization of the preparation process of A-site deficient perovskite, La 0. 2 Sr 0. 25 Ca 0. 45 TiO 3 (LSCTA-) powders and their characterization for integration into the SOFC anode supports have been focussed. LSCTA- powder was investigated in different yet connected important aspects using high-tech methods like tape casting, microstructure optimization and testing in symmetrical and button cell set ups. The {{major part of the}} present research deals with the process optimization of LSCTA-. modified Pechini method was successfully applied to produce single phase perovskite at 900 oC. The effect of calcination temperature on the phase, morphology and sintering characteristics was studied using XRD, SEM and dilatometry techniques. The optimal calcination temperature of 1000 oC was selected for further studies as the powder calcined at this temperature displayed a similar sintering profile to commercial 8 mol% yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ), the typical choice for electrolyte. LSCTA- showed an n-type conduction nature where conductivity of a dense LSCTA- specimen sintered in air increased by three orders of magnitude after in-situ reduction in 5 % H 2 /Ar. These encouraging characterization results supported the SOFC anode candidateship of LSCTA. In the second part of study, the synthesized powder was processed in aqueous tape casting which is a quick and rapid technique to fabricate <b>thin</b> SOFC anodes. <b>Slurry</b> formulation was optimized for both the dense and porous green tapes. The rectangular bars fabricated from green tapes by lamination were sintered and tested for conductivity measurements using van der Pauw set up. The effect of ceria impregnation on the conductivity of porous LSCTA- bars was studied. The conductivity behaviour of porous bars under redox cycling showed a two-stage process that exhibited strong reversibility. For the reduction process, addition of impregnated ceria reduced the onset delay period and increased the apparent rate constant, k values by 30 - 50 % for both stages. The co-impregnation of Ni further resulted in an increase of conductivity of porous bars. Another aspect of the study was the microstructure optimization of LSCTA- tapes. To introduce the porosity in LSCTA- tapes, commercial pore formers like graphite, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) and glassy carbon (GC) were used. It was observed that pre-sintering the powder helps to get a good microstructure with commercial pore formers. An interesting feature for inducing porosity in LSCTA- tapes was the synthesis of homogeneous and well dispersed carbon micro spheres (CMS) from an optimized hydrothermal method and their further application as pore formers. As a part of the research, the anode performance of LSCTA- was tested in YSZ electrolyte supported symmetrical cells. The effect of impregnates like ceria (CeO 2), gadolinium doped ceria (CGO), with and without Ni, on the performance of symmetrical cells was investigated. It was found that co-impregnation of CeO 2 and CGO with Ni have pronounced effect in decreasing the impedance of bare LSCTA in symmetrical cells. Further, the anode performance was tested in button cells using a three electrode set up. A significant improvement in cell performance could be achieved by optimizing the anode support with various impregnates both qualitatively and quantitatively. Finally, LSCTA was doped at B site with Ni (LSCTN) and Fe (LSCTF). The doped compositions offered higher conductivity values than the parent LSCTA-. Compared to pre-reduced LSCTA having conductivity of 38 S cm- 1, the pre reduced 5 % Ni doped LSCTA- (LSCTN- 5) and 5 % Fe doped LSCTA- (LSCTF- 5) offered conductivity values of 47 S cm- 1 and 66 S cm- 1 at 880 oC, respectively. In conclusion, structurally stable LSCTA- could be a good alternative to state of the art SOFC anode exhibiting good mechanical, morphological and electrical properties.

For completeness of investigation effective segregation of soil grains was achieved through constant agitation. The wet suspension was then passed through a 63 um sieve to separate the coarse fraction from the fines fraction. CBR tests were performed on compacted samples in both unsoaked and soaked conditions. The CBR which is a semi empirical strength test is the ratio of the load that causes a penetration of 2.5 or 5.00  mm of a standard plunger in a sample to the standard load that causes similar penetrations of the same plunger respectively in a 13.24 KN and 19.96 KN California sample. Readings of load taken at penetration intervals of 0.25 – 7.50  mm were plotted to generate a load deformation curve. Soaking of the samples in water was done for 24  h in accordance with the Nigerian general specification (Federal Ministry of Works and Housing 1997) before the determination of the soaked CBR to simulate natural conditions and assess {{the extent to which the}} ingress of water would expand and weaken the soils. Varying quantities of 2, 6, 10, 14 and 20  % of both Rice husk and Coconut husk ash (by weight) separately was added to the shales and mixed thoroughly to allow for intimate mixing. The mixed samples were left for 48  h to cure and subsequently remixed to achieve a homogenous mix prior to compaction at Modified AASHTO level of compaction. The Modified AASHTO compaction was desirable because it is usually achievable with conventional field equipment. Moreover as indicated by Mohamedzein et al. (2005), shale can withstand higher energy level without mechanical instability. Hence compaction at Modified AASHTO was achieved using air dried samples weighing 6  kg mixed thoroughly with 6  kg of water. The material was compacted into a pre-weighed mould in 5 layers with each layer subjected to 55 blows of a 4.5  kg rammer falling through a height of 0.45  m uniformly. The process was repeated for all the five portions and then repeated after the addition of the ashes at 2, 6, 10, 14 and 20  %. In the determination of the UCS all the samples were cured for 7  days and were compacted at OMC to simulate field moisture compaction conditions. The samples compacted at OMC were taken in the form of cylinder which was later reduced to the required size of 76  mm long by 38  mm diameter and then loaded on the triaxial machine. The machine loads the cylindrical sample by moving the piston rod downward at a constant rate, after which the load that corresponds to the deformation were measured and read from a steel proving ring until the sample failed. Stress results were obtained through the applied force divided by cross sectional area of the sample while the strain was obtained through change in the original sample length. Calculations of stress and strain were plotted to determine the UCS. The consistency of the different mixtures was also determined to obtain the influence on plasticity index. Total abundances of the major oxides and several minor elements of the shale samples, rice husk ash (RHA) and coconut husk ash (CHA) were analysed by Induced Coupled Plasma-Emission Spectrometry (ICP-ES). The prepared samples were digested to complete dryness with an acid solution of (2 : 2 : 1 : 1) H 2 O-HF-HClO 4 -HNO 3. 50  % HCl was added to the residue and heated using a mixing hot block. After cooling the solutions were transferred to test-tubes and brought to volume using dilute HCl while sample splits of 0.25  g were analyzed. Furthermore the mineralogical composition of the soils was determined using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) at the Acme Laboratories, Vancouver, Canada. Powdered samples of the soil were pelletized and sieved to 0.074  mm. These were later mixed with acetone to produce a <b>thin</b> <b>slurry</b> and each sample mixture was applied to a glass was scanned through the Siemens D 500 Diffractometer (using MDI Data Scan and JADE 8 softwares) for the determination of XRD.|$|E
