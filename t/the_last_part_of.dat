Oslo–Bergen trains ran via the Randsfjord Line after 1989 and local train services have been terminated. However, the line remains in use for freight trains along the Oslo–Bergen route.|$|E

5|$|By 2005, {{ridership}} {{had increased}} to 2.5 million per year, up 278% from 1991, giving a 7% {{market share in}} the corridor. To further increase capacity and regularity, the Norwegian National Rail Administration decided to rebuild the section from Stavanger to Sandnes to double track. At the same time, a new freight terminal was to be built at Ganddal, meaning that the section would only have to be shared with intercity trains. The upgrade involved closing Hillevåg Station, and building three new stations: Paradis, Jåttåvågen and Gausel. Construction was started in 2006 and {{was estimated to be}} completed by 2009. It was estimated to cost 2.2 billion Norwegian krone. From April to November 2009, the section from Ganddal to Stavanger was closed while <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the upgrade was completed. The new line was opened on 16 November 2009 and from 14 December, the 15-minute headway was introduced between Stavanger and Sandnes.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola and {{his wife}} Alice {{returned}} to their home in Lugano. For {{the duration of the}} war he was unable to drive; the rationing of petrol meant motor racing was unfeasible. The pain in his leg grew worse, and they went back to the clinic in Bologna to consult a specialist. Surgery was recommended, but Caracciola decided against that option, deterred by the minimum three months it would take to recover from the operation. He spent much of <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the war—from 1941 onwards—attempting to gain possession of the two W165s used at the 1939 Tripoli Grand Prix, with a view to maintaining them {{for the duration of the}} hostilities. When they finally arrived in Switzerland in early 1945, they were confiscated as German property by the Swiss authorities.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{was also}} criticized. Reviewers called it poor, clumsy, and unsatisfactory, {{complaining}} that Bloodlines favors melee combat; firearms were weak, unwieldy and slow, even for characters specializing in guns. PC Zone, however, called the first-person shooting entertaining and challenging. Although melee combat was criticized as sluggish and difficult due to enemy attacks interrupting the player's, reviewers considered it overpowered; according to GameSpot, a boss character was killed with melee weapons {{on a first}} attempt after the repeated {{failure to do so}} with a gun. The New York Times found the unavoidable combat in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the game to be so difficult that they had to cheat to succeed. Stealth was criticized, with IGN noting that even with low stealth skill it was possible to sneak around many enemies and feed from a guard without alerting another guard next to them. GameSpot opined that some of the best missions were stealth-based, as combat was more straightforward.|$|E

5|$|Croatia is {{inhabited}} {{mostly by}} Croats (89.6%), while minorities include Serbs (4.5%) and 21 other ethnicities (less than 1% each) recognised by the Constitution of Croatia. The demographic history of Croatia {{is marked by}} significant migrations, including: the Croats' arrival in the area; {{the growth of the}} Hungarian and German speaking population after the personal union of Croatia and Hungary; joining of the Habsburg Empire; migrations set off by the Ottoman conquests; and the growth of the Italian-speaking population in Istria and Dalmatia during the Venetian rule there. After Austria-Hungary's collapse, the Hungarian population declined, while the German-speaking population was forced out or fled during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> and after World War II, and a similar fate was suffered by the Italian population. The late 19th century and the 20th century were marked by large scale economic migrations abroad. The 1940s and the 1950s in Yugoslavia were marked by internal migrations in Yugoslavia, as well as by urbanisation. The most recent significant migrations came {{as a result of the}} Croatian War of Independence when hundreds of thousands were displaced.|$|E
5|$|Darwin's {{barnacle}} studies {{convinced him}} that variation arose constantly {{and not just in}} response to changed circumstances. In 1854, he completed <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> his Beagle-related writing and began working full-time on evolution. He now realised that the branching pattern of evolutionary divergence was explained by natural selection working constantly to improve adaptation. His thinking changed from the view that species formed in isolated populations only, as on islands, to an emphasis on speciation without isolation; that is, he saw increasing specialisation within large stable populations as continuously exploiting new ecological niches. He conducted empirical research focusing on difficulties with his theory. He studied the developmental and anatomical differences between different breeds of many domestic animals, became actively involved in fancy pigeon breeding, and experimented (with the help of his son Francis) on ways that plant seeds and animals might disperse across oceans to colonise distant islands. By 1856, his theory was much more sophisticated, with a mass of supporting evidence.|$|E
5|$|Final Destination 3 was {{originally}} <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> a trilogy {{and had been}} in development since the release of Final Destination 2. Jeffrey Reddick, creator of the franchise {{and one of the}} co-writers of the first two films, did not return for the third installment. According to director James Wong, unlike the second film, which was closely tied to the first, Final Destination 3 was envisioned as a stand-alone sequel featuring new characters from the beginning, stating:e really felt that the idea of Final Destination, or the fact that Death can visit you and you can cheat death, that that could happen to anyone. And so we wanted to divorce from the first film character wise. We didn't want to follow that same thread. Part of the difficulty in that is when a character understands what happened to them before; it's a whole different way in which they react to what's happening now. We felt the franchise could exist with a new group of people, instead of following those older characters all the way through. We wanted to see if this could work.|$|E
