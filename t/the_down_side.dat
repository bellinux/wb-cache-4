25|$|As {{with other}} {{stations}} on the line, Legbourne was provided with staggered platforms situated {{either side of}} the crossing; a signal box lay on the northern side of the crossing and as well as controlling the gates, also regulated access to the two sidings on <b>the</b> <b>down</b> <b>side</b> adjacent to the crossing, which were the station's only goods facilities. The station did not handle livestock. The stationmaster's house is similar in style to that found at other stations on the line and was sited adjacent to the crossing on <b>the</b> <b>down</b> <b>side.</b> The July 1922 timetable saw four up and down weekday services, plus one Sunday service each way, call at Legbourne Road. The station was closed to passengers on 7 December 1953, one of the first such closures on the East Lincolnshire Line, but goods facilities (downgraded to an unstaffed public siding) remained for a further ten-and-a-half years until 15 June 1964.|$|E
25|$|The obvious {{method is}} {{proportional}} control: the motor current {{is set in}} proportion to the existing error. However, this method fails if, for instance, the arm has to lift different weights: a greater weight needs a greater force applied for a same error on <b>the</b> <b>down</b> <b>side,</b> but a smaller force if the error is on the upside. That's where the integral and derivative terms play their part.|$|E
25|$|A {{subsequent}} {{improvement was}} {{the extraction of}} smoke through a flue. Still later, a proper hearth would be added with a stone chimney.

25|$|A {{signal box}} which {{contained}} 25 levers was {{situated on the}} north side of the level crossing and controlled the crossing gates as well as access to the small goods yard with a siding on each side of the line. The siding on <b>the</b> <b>down</b> <b>side</b> ran into a loading dock behind the down platform. Unlike Ludborough, the station had no goods shed. The goods yard closed on 30 December 1963, but the station remained open to passengers until 5 October 1970. In 1956-57, around a dozen passenger trains bound for Grimsby called at the station on weekdays, with the first two being local workings from Louth, save for a Mondays only service which called only to set down passengers. In the other direction, fewer services ran through to , but the up/down passenger workings balanced once services to Louth were taken into account. North Thoresby was the only intermediate station between Grimsby and Louth to remain open until October 1970.After 1970 the down line was removed and only the up line through the station remained. The line finally closed in December 1980.|$|E

500|$|There {{were two}} sidings {{on the line}} which were {{available}} for public use. Churn Siding was located between Paddock Wood and Horsmonden stations.

Although some sources state that Churn Siding was out of use by 1940, photographs show that {{it was still in}} use in 1951 and it was named in the closure notice. Towards the end of the line's existence, Churn Siding was used for storage of wagons. The siding was located {{at the start of the}} 1 in 78 climb to Horsmonden.
