5|$|Lord Lane, then Lord Chief Justice of England, {{dismissed}} the applications on 13 December 1988, arguing of Raghip that <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>had</b> had {{ample opportunity to}} form its own opinion of him. Amnesty International criticised the decision, pointing to the problems with confessions made {{in the absence of}} a lawyer, and was criticized in turn by Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, who said Amnesty had abandoned its impartiality.|$|E
5|$|On November 8, 2010, {{the jury}} {{returned}} with a recommendation that Hayes be executed. The jury recommended a death sentence {{on each of the}} six capital felony counts for which Hayes was convicted.

5|$|When Berkman {{was brought}} to the {{courtroom}} on September19, <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>had</b> already been empaneled. The district attorney had selected the jury without allowing Berkman to examine prospective jurors, and the judge had no objection to the unusual procedure. Berkman was charged with six counts: felonious assault with the intent to kill Frick; felonious assault with the intent to kill Lawrence Leishman, who had been in Frick's office {{at the time of the}} attack; feloniously entering the offices of the Carnegie Steel Company on three occasions; and unlawfully carrying concealed weapons. Berkman pleaded not guilty to all charges.|$|E

5|$|After a 17-month trial, {{the often}} tumultuous {{proceedings}} {{ended with a}} guilty verdict on July 8, 1912. The defendants, including 27 leading Camorra bosses, were sentenced {{to a total of}} 354 years' imprisonment. The main defendants Enrico Alfano and Giovanni Rapi were sentenced to 30 years. The priest Vitozzi received seven years and government witness Abbatemaggio five years. <b>The</b> <b>jury</b> <b>had</b> been held in isolation since March 1911. The reports of the proceedings were about 40,000 pages in 63 volumes. In his last statement before the verdict, a furious Alfano accused the authorities to have killed his brother Ciro, who had died in prison. Another defendant, Gennaro De Marinas, who was sentenced to 30 years as well, slashed his throat with a piece of glass in the Court when the verdict was delivered.|$|E
5|$|Bamber's {{case was}} {{passed to the}} Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) when it was {{established}} in 1997 to review alleged miscarriages of justice. The CCRC referred {{the case to the}} Court of Appeal in March 2001 on the grounds that new DNA testing on the silencer constituted fresh evidence. The appeal was heard from 17 October to 1 November 2002 at the Royal Courts of Justice by Lord Justice Kay, Mr Justice Wright and Mr Justice Henriques, who published their decision on 12 December 2002. The prosecution was represented by Victor Temple QC and Bamber by Michael Turner QC. In a 522-point judgment, the judges said that there was no conduct on the part of investigators that threatened the integrity of the trial, and that the more they examined the case, the more they thought <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>had</b> been right.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Burton {{argued that}} the Eastern District of Missouri was an unconstitutional venue and vicinage (an {{argument}} that the Court had accepted in Burton I). This time, the Court rejected the argument. The Court held that the agreement had occurred in St. Louis (as <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>had</b> been instructed that it was required to find) based on Rialto's acceptance in St. Louis, the telegram, and the letter. The Court bolstered this view by citation to its own and other precedents concerning offer and acceptance in contract law. The Court further cited its earlier precedents holding that the venue provision of Article III {{does not require the}} physical presence of the defendant in the forum state.|$|E

5|$|At the hearing, new {{evidence}} was heard, that heavy rain {{had fallen on}} the ship {{on the second day}} of the killings, but a third batch of slaves was killed after that. This led Mansfield to order another trial, because the rainfall meant that the killing of those slaves, after the water shortage had been eased, could not be justified in terms of the greater necessity of saving the ship and the rest of its human cargo. One of the justices in attendance also said that this evidence invalidated the findings of the jury in the first trial, as <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>had</b> heard testimony that the water shortage resulted from the poor condition of the ship, brought on by unforeseen maritime conditions, rather than from errors committed by its captain. Mansfield concluded that the insurers were not liable for losses resulting from errors committed by Zong crew.|$|E
5|$|John Appleyard had profited {{in terms}} of offices and annuities from his brother-in-law's rise ever since 1559; he was {{nevertheless}} disappointed with what he had got from Robert Dudley, now Earl of Leicester. In 1567 he was approached, apparently {{on behalf of the}} Duke of Norfolk and the Earl of Sussex, to accuse Leicester of the murder of his wife for a reward of £1,000 in cash. He refused to cooperate in the plot, although he had, he said, {{in the last few years}} come to believe that his half-sister was murdered. He had always been convinced of Dudley's innocence but thought it would be an easy matter to find out the real culprits. He said he had repeatedly asked for the Earl's help to this effect, claiming <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>had</b> not yet come up with their verdict; Dudley had always answered that the matter should rest, since a jury had found that there was no murder, by due procedure of law. Now, as Leicester became aware of a plot against him, he summoned Appleyard and sent him away after a furious confrontation.|$|E
5|$|The {{trials were}} delayed {{due to the}} {{difficulties}} in bringing together witnesses, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and interpreters. The proceedings finally began in August 1828, with Judge James Duane Doty presiding. Wau-koo-kau and Man-ne-tah-peh-keh, the two warriors imprisoned for the 1826 murders of the Methode family, were released {{due to a lack}} of witnesses, as were three Ho-Chunks held for the attack on the keelboats. Only two men, Wekau and Chickhonsic, were prosecuted. According to historian Patrick Jung, it became clear during the trial that Red Bird had committed the murders at the Gagnier cabin, and that there was not enough evidence to convict Wekau and Chickhonsic. Despite this, the white and métis jury found them guilty. Judge Doty sentenced them to hang, as he was required to do by law. Their lawyer filed a motion for a new trial, arguing that <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>had</b> ignored the evidence, and so Doty suspended the death sentences.|$|E

25|$|After deliberating {{for nine}} hours, the jury {{returned}} with its verdict. <b>The</b> <b>jury</b> <b>had</b> {{the option of}} finding Cottrell guilty of murder, reckless homicide, or manslaughter.

25|$|Knowing that Orfila's {{testimony}} had {{tipped the}} balance against them, the defence team sought {{to call a}} known opponent of Orfila, François Vincent Raspail, to refute his testimony.

25|$|Finding {{that the}} state of South Carolina {{constituted}} a single judicial district, the Court found it unnecessary to further examine the jurisdiction of the circuit court.

25|$|In {{relation}} to the section 18 offence, which did require proof of specific intent, {{it was pointed out}} that DPP v Majewski had made it clear that a specific intent may be negatived even if the incapacity of mind is self-induced by voluntary taking of drugs or alcohol.

50|$|Properly directed, <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> should {{therefore}} <b>have</b> applied a narrow and strict {{test of a}} man with ordinary powers of self-control rather than the wider test of excusability that was put to them by <b>the</b> judge. <b>The</b> <b>jury</b> <b>having</b> convicted on <b>the</b> basis of the wider test, we cannot see any unsafety in the conviction.

25|$|The jury began {{deliberations}} on July4. On July5, prosecutors stated that, during deliberations, {{they were}} about to give the jury the corrected information with regard to Bradley's software discrepancy; however, the jury reached a verdict before they could do so. One legal analyst stated that if <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>had</b> found Anthony guilty before receiving the exculpatory evidence, the prosecution's failure to fully disclose it could have been grounds for a mistrial.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>had</b> found that two {{aggravating}} factors applied to Coker's crime (his prior convictions {{and the fact}} that the rape was committed during the course of a robbery) did not change the Court's conclusion. The rape may have been committed during the course of another crime and by a hardened criminal, but the rape did not escalate into a killing. Finally, even a deliberate killing does not merit a death sentence under Georgia law without the finding of aggravating factors.|$|E
25|$|On May 7, Judge Perry {{granted a}} motion by defense to discuss Grant's {{conviction}} for possessing {{a gun and}} evading arrest. Perry formally selected the jury on June 8 after attorneys had used their motions. The 12-member jury consisted of eight women and four men; of these jurors, seven were white, four Hispanic, and one Asian. Of the alternates, there were five women and one man, consisting of three Asians, two whites, and one Hispanic. It was alleged that six of <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> <b>had</b> law enforcement connections.|$|E
50|$|The {{prosecution}} may {{not seek}} capital punishment in the retrial if <b>the</b> <b>jury</b> did not impose {{it in the}} original trial.

50|$|<b>Juries</b> <b>have</b> {{also refused}} to convict due to the {{perceived}} injustice of a law in general, or {{of the way the}} law is applied in particular cases.
