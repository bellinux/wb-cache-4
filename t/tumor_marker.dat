CA19-9 (carbohydrate antigen 19.9) is a <b>tumor</b> <b>marker</b> that is frequently elevated in pancreatic cancer. However, it lacks sensitivity and specificity, not least because 5% of people lack the Lewis (a) antigen and cannot produce CA19-9. It has a sensitivity of 80% and specificity of 73% in detecting pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and is used for following known cases rather than diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The <b>tumor</b> <b>marker</b> CA-125 is {{frequently}} elevated in endometrial cancer {{and can be}} used to monitor response to treatment, particularly in serous cell cancer or advanced disease. Periodic MRIs or CT scans may be recommended in advanced disease and women with a history of endometrial cancer should receive more frequent pelvic examinations for the five years following treatment. Examinations conducted every three to four months are recommended for the first two years following treatment, and every six months for the next three years.|$|E

Furthermore, most of the <b>tumor</b> <b>markers</b> are also made by normal cells and their amount is low in the cells: however the expression of <b>tumor</b> <b>markers</b> is increased or decreased in tumor cells thereby their amounts are elevated in blood and body fluids.

25|$|Current {{research}} {{is looking at}} ways to consider <b>tumor</b> <b>marker</b> proteomics {{in combination with other}} indicators of disease (i.e. radiology and/or symptoms) to improve diagnostic accuracy. The challenge in such an approach is that the disparate prevalence of ovarian cancer means that even testing with very high sensitivity and specificity will still lead to a number of false positive results, which in turn may lead to issues such as performing surgical procedures in which cancer is not found intraoperatively. Genomics approaches have not yet been developed for ovarian cancer.|$|E
25|$|A similar {{use of the}} {{thymidine}} kinase makes use of the presence in some tumor cells of substances not present in normal cells (tumor markers). Such tumor markers are, for instance, CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) and AFP (alpha fetoprotein). The genes for these tumor markers {{may be used as}} promoter genes for {{thymidine kinase}}. Thymidine kinase can then be activated in cells expressing the <b>tumor</b> <b>marker</b> but not in normal cells, such that treatment with ganciclovir kills only the tumor cells. Such gene therapy-based approaches are still experimental, however, as problems associated with targeting the gene transfer to the tumor cells have not yet been completely solved.|$|E

25|$|Due to {{the fact}} that HCC most {{commonly}} occurs in the setting of chronic liver disease (e.g. viral hepatitis) and cirrhosis (about 80%), screening by ultrasound (US) is commonly advocated in this population.

These people are screened with ultrasound every 6 months. Additional evaluation may include measurement of blood levels of AFP, which is a <b>tumor</b> <b>marker.</b> Elevated levels of AFP are associated with active HCC disease.

40|$|Background—Plasma tumor {{biomarkers}} {{are widely}} used clinically for monitoring response to therapy and detecting cancer recurrence.

Objective—To review plasma <b>tumor</b> <b>markers</b> used clinically for the early detection of cancer and to provide expert opinion about future directions. Methods—Literature review, as well as our expert opinion, of plasma <b>tumor</b> <b>markers</b> that have been widely accepted for the early detection of cancer.

Both analytical and clinical issues related to the use of these three markers were discussed.

40|$|Background and {{objective}} Among frequently-used <b>tumor</b> <b>markers</b> in lung cancer, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA 125), cytokeratin 19 (CYFRA 21 - 1) and squamous carcinoma antigen (SCC), neuron specific enolase (NSE) and pro-gastrin-releasing peptide (ProGRP) are respectively expressed highly in lung adenocarcinoma, lung squamous carcinoma and small cell lung cancer. By comparing patients with multiple increased <b>tumor</b> <b>markers</b> (group A) and patients with increase of CEA and/or CA 125 (group B), {{this study aims}} to investigate the utility of multiple increased <b>tumor</b> <b>markers</b> in therapeutic evaluation and prediction of disease relapsing in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma. Methods Patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma who receiving the first line chemotherapy in Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences were enrolled and retrospectively analyzed. Clinical characteristic, serum <b>tumor</b> <b>markers</b> before chemotherapy, efficacy evaluation, progression-free survival (PFS) were analyzed. Results Except CEA and CA 125, the highest ratio of increased tumor markersin group A was CYFRA 21 - 1 (93 %), then was NSE (36 %), SCC (13 %) and ProGRP (12 %). Patients with multiple increased <b>tumor</b> <b>markers</b> {{tend to have more}} distant metastasis (P< 0. 001) and shorter PFS (median PFS 5. 3 months vs 7. 3 months, P= 0. 016).

Methods The serum levels of the six <b>tumor</b> <b>markers</b> (NSE、pro-GRP、CYFRA 21 - 1 、SCC、p 53 antibody and CA 199) were detected in 80 healthy adults, 170 patients with lung cancer and 80 patients with respiratory infection by ELISA. Results The levels of the six <b>tumor</b> <b>markers</b> in patients with lung cancer were remarkably higher than those in healthy adults and patients with respiratory infection (P< 0. 01). The levels of the NSE、pro-GRP in patients with small cell lung cancer were significantly higher than those in other subtypes of the lung cancer (P< 0. 01); The levels of the CYFRA 21 - 1 、SCC in patients with squamous carcinoma was remarkably higher than that in other subtypes of the lung cancer (P< 0. 01). The sensitivity of the NSE、pro-GRP in diagnosing small cell lung cancer was remarkably higher than that in other subtypes of the lung cancer (P< 0. 01); The sensitivity of the CYFRA 21 - 1 、SCC in diagnosing squamous carcinoma was remarkably higher than that in other subtypes of the lung cancer (P< 0. 01).

Biopsy samples were randomly taken from patients with prostate tumors. Tissue sections were prepared and stained for histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Out of the 100 patients with prostatic lesions, 25 % had benign prostatic hyperplasia, 42 % and 33 % have a well differentiated and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, respectively.
