40|$|We {{explored}} {{the functions of}} team monitoring and <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> room (undirected <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> relay relevant information or comment {{on the performance of}} real-time self behavior) for effects on team interaction and performance in 27 anesthesia teams in the clinical setting. Immediate reactions to team monitoring and <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> room were investigated by means of lag sequential analysis. As expected, we found that in high performing teams, immediate consequences of team monitoring were speaking-up and providing unsolicited assistance. <b>Talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> room led <b>to</b> further <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> room and substituted explicit coordination. The results highlight the relevance of team monitoring and <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> room for team coordination and performance in dynamic healthcare environments...|$|R

The game relies {{on a number of}} metafictional elements in both its gameplay and story. When players participate in a boss battle on a second playthrough, the dialogue will be altered depending on actions in previous playthroughs.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the {{development}} of the Mk. I to III, various units had been flying the systems in an effort to develop suitable interception techniques. Very early on it was decided to dispense with the full reporting chain of the Dowding system and have the radar operators at the Chain Home (CH) sites <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fighters directly, greatly reducing delays. This improved matters, and on an increasing number of occasions aircraft received direction from the CH stations towards real targets.|$|E

5|$|Attempts by law {{enforcement}} to investigate conditions at Gold Base have been blocked by legal difficulties and the unwillingness {{of those on the}} base to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> police. According to Lawrence Wright, who wrote an account of the Hole in his 2013 book , the Riverside County sheriff's office has never received a complaint from someone at the base about their treatment there, despite the many accounts of mistreatment. Wright attributes this to the fear that many Scientologists have of bringing shame upon Scientology and of being forced to break off contact with their families and friends.|$|E

5|$|In 1935, Italy invaded Ethiopia (Abyssinia), incensing Kenyatta {{and other}} Africans in London; {{he became the}} honorary {{secretary}} of the International African Friends of Abyssinia, a group established by Padmore and C. L. R. James. When Ethiopia's monarch Haile Selassie fled to London in exile, Kenyatta personally welcomed him. This group developed into a wider pan-Africanist organisation, the International African Service Bureau (IASB), which Kenyatta joined. Kenyatta began giving anti-colonial lectures across Britain for groups like the IASB and the Workers' Educational Association. In October 1938, he gave a <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Manchester Fabian Society in which he described British colonial policy as fascism and compared the treatment of indigenous people in East Africa {{to the treatment of}} Jews in Nazi Germany. In response to these activities, the British Colonial Office reopened their file on him, although could not find any evidence that he was engaged in anything sufficiently seditious to warrant prosecution.|$|E
