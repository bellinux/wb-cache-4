5|$|A {{reconnaissance}} {{party of}} 30 men was sent {{out from behind}} the third stone wall to see if the British would try and flank the American position. The party ran into the British, who had continued to advance, and they fell back to the stone wall. The Americans behind the wall fired one volley before Glover gave <b>the</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> retreat. The Americans retreated across a bridge over the Hutchinson stream, their retreat covered by the 150 men of the 14th Continentals who engaged in an artillery duel with the British. Howe camped on a hill {{on the opposite side of}} the stream but made no attempt to cross the stream.|$|E
5|$|A shot rang out. It {{was likely}} a warning shot fired by a panicked, {{exhausted}} British soldier from the 43rd, according to Captain Laurie's report to his commander after the fight. Two other regulars then fired immediately after that, shots splashing in the river, {{and then the}} narrow group up front, possibly thinking <b>the</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> fire had been given, fired a ragged volley before Laurie could stop them.|$|E

5|$|Amtrak ordered 235 Superliner I {{cars from}} Pullman-Standard on April 2, 1975, with {{deliveries}} scheduled for between January 1977 and June 1978. The order then consisted of 120 coaches, 55 sleepers, 34 diners, and 26 lounges. Amtrak soon increased <b>the</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> 284 cars: it added 30 coaches, 15 sleepers, 5 diners, and deleted 1 lounge. The initial order cost $143.6 million; {{with the additional}} cars and other payments the cost rose to $250 million.|$|E
5|$|Before World War One men {{generally}} had longer {{hair and}} beards. However, short hair on men {{was introduced in}} World War One for soldiers. Slaves and defeated armies were often required to shave their heads. The trench warfare in 1914 to 1918 exposed men to flea and lice infestations, which prompted <b>the</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> cut short hair, establishing a military tradition, and it expanded among civilians by imitation.|$|E
5|$|Between late February {{and early}} March 1945, with {{the advance of}} the Allied armies, all {{production}} of notes at Sachsenhausen ceased. The equipment and supplies were packed and transported, with the prisoners, to the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp in Austria, arriving on 12 March. Shortly afterwards Krüger arranged for a further transfer to the Redl-Zipf series of tunnels where they were to restart production. <b>The</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> resume production was soon rescinded, and the prisoners were ordered to destroy the cases of money they had with them. That which was not burnt by the prisoners was loaded onto trucks with the printing equipment and sunk in the Toplitz and Grundlsee lakes.|$|E

5|$|Both fleets were {{at first}} {{hampered}} by light and changeable winds. When a consistent west wind appeared on 20June, Hughes {{lined up for}} battle and awaited Suffren's action. Lining up in a similar formation, Suffren gave <b>the</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> attack, and battle began shortly after four in the afternoon. The action lasted around three hours and resulted in no major damage to ships in either fleet, despite all ships being engaged. The British had 99 men killed and 434 wounded; French casualties amounted to 102 killed and 386 wounded.|$|E
5|$|Cunningham, {{realising}} that an {{air attack}} could weaken the Italians, ordered {{an attack by}} the Formidables Albacore torpedo-bombers. A hit on the Vittorio Veneto slowed her temporarily and Iachino, realising his fleet was vulnerable without air cover, ordered his forces to retire. Cunningham gave <b>the</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> pursue the Italian Fleet.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} {{preceding}} {{the siege of}} Venice, {{it was believed that}} the Ottoman Empire had preparations underway to attack Malta. This suspicion became stronger when a well-groomed man, who had approached <b>the</b> <b>Order</b> <b>to</b> serve as engineer and offer his wealth of knowledge about fortifications, disappeared shortly after having surveyed Malta's fortifications. Consequently, the Order began its preparations to counter any possible attack by the Ottoman army.|$|E

5|$|Eventually <b>the</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> {{withdraw}} {{was given}} from 11th Brigade headquarters. During the subsequent evacuation, two more landing craft ran aground and although one managed to float free, the other remained stuck {{hard on a}} reef. Over {{the course of the}} next couple of days, the men in the landing craft were subjected to heavy Japanese attack and it was not until 11 June that rescue efforts were completed. The battalion lost 23 men killed or missing, presumed dead, while a further 106 were wounded in the operation.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a period}} of patrols and trench raids, the 13th was {{relieved}} by the 5th Battalion on 6 December, and marched back to Ribemont, where Murray was granted leave to England. On 4 January 1917, he was Mentioned in Despatches. The battalion returned to the front in February, relieving the 15th Battalion at Gueudecourt. On 4 February, the battalion's commanding officer received <b>the</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> attack Stormy Trench; {{it was during this}} action that Murray would earn his Victoria Cross.|$|E
5|$|Following the explosion, the {{remaining}} gunmen {{opened fire on}} the dazed band members, who had all been knocked down into the field {{below the level of}} the road from the force of the blast. <b>The</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> shoot was given by the patrol's apparent leader, James McDowell, to eliminate witnesses to the bogus checkpoint and subsequent bombing. Three of the musicians were killed: lead singer Fran O'Toole, trumpeter Brian McCoy, and guitarist Tony Geraghty.|$|E

5|$|Fossil caddisflies {{have been}} found in rocks dating back to the Triassic. The largest numbers of fossilised remains are those of larval cases, which are made of durable {{materials}} that preserve well. Body fossils of caddisflies are extremely rare, the oldest being from the Early and Middle Triassic, some 230 million years ago, and wings are another source of fossils. The evolution of the group to one with fully aquatic larvae seems to have taken place some time during the Triassic. The finding of fossils resembling caddisfly larval cases in marine deposits in Brazil may push back the origins of <b>the</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> the early Permian period.|$|E

5|$|In {{the end the}} Māoris {{remained}} in position until 17 April. Throughout the previous two days the battalion worked hard to repel repeated attempts by elements of the German 2nd Infantry Regiment to infiltrate their lines, before they finally received <b>the</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> fall back. With isolated platoons still {{in contact with the}} Germans and amidst high winds and a heavy downpour of rain, the New Zealanders had difficulty disengaging. Withdrawing over difficult terrain towards the pass, the manoeuvre continued into the night as the Germans continued to harass their rearguard units. The move was carried out with considerable urgency because the intention was to blow a bridge up just after the battalion had withdrawn across it in order to delay the German advance. In the end the battalion only just made it, for the engineers tasked with carrying out the demolition had received <b>the</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> complete their task and were about to detonate when the battalion arrived shortly after 3:00am.|$|E
