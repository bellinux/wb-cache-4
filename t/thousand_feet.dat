5|$|Some places, (for example, the Altiplano in Peru and Bolivia, or {{the plateau}} around Asmara (where the airport is) in Eritrea, and some {{mountain}} passes), are many <b>thousand</b> <b>feet</b> {{above sea level}} and travelling to such places after diving at lower altitude {{should be treated as}} flying at the equivalent altitude after diving.|$|E
5|$|The central {{feature of}} the park, Minnehaha Falls, lies several <b>thousand</b> <b>feet</b> {{upstream}} from its original mouth where it emptied into the Mississippi River 10,000 {{years ago at the}} end of the last Great Ice Age. Erosion below the falls has exposed Minnesota's geologic past from the present day back to over 450 million years ago, when Minnesota was covered with shallow seas.|$|E
5|$|Downcutting and canyon {{widening}} continue {{today as}} the process of erosion continues to try to reduce the topography to sea level. In 1998 a flash flood temporarily increased the Virgin River's flow rate from 200 to 4,500ft³/s (6 to 125m³/s). Geologists estimate that the Virgin River can cut another <b>thousand</b> <b>feet</b> (300m) before it loses the ability to transport sediment to the Colorado River to the south. However, additional uplift will probably increase this figure.|$|E
50|$|Trevor McNevan (born July 17, 1978), {{also known}} as Teerawk, is a Canadian {{musician}} and lead singer/songwriter of <b>Thousand</b> <b>Foot</b> Krutch and pop punk side project FM Static along with Steve Augustine (the third <b>Thousand</b> <b>Foot</b> Krutch drummer). His first band, Oddball, included former <b>Thousand</b> <b>Foot</b> Krutch members Dave Smith (guitar) and Tim Baxter (bass), as well as Three Days Grace drummer Neil Sanderson. Oddball released the 27-song record Shutterbug, in 1995, featuring half hip-hop and half rock songs.|$|R

5|$|In {{the case}} of ASV {{this was not a}} problem; {{aircraft}} would not approach a ship on the surface more closely than its altitude of perhaps a few <b>thousand</b> <b>feet,</b> so a longer pulse width was fine. But in the AI role, the minimum range was pre-defined by the pilot's eyesight, at 300m or less for night interception, which demanded sub-microsecond pulse widths. This proved very difficult to arrange, and ranges under 1,000feet were difficult to produce.|$|E
5|$|The Malibu Coast–Santa Monica Fault {{lies at the}} {{southern}} flank of the Santa Monica Mountains and the Raymond Fault runs {{to the south of}} the Verdugo Mountains and meets the San Gabriel Mountains at Monrovia. The Clamshell–Sawpit Fault lies beneath the San Gabriel Mountains inline with the Raymond Fault. The characteristics of the various faults are difficult to interpret, but they all dip steeply to the north with several <b>thousand</b> <b>feet</b> of displacement.|$|E
5|$|The {{district}} of Faisalabad {{is part of}} the alluvial plains between the Himalayan foothills and the central core of the Indian subcontinent. The alluvial deposits are typically over a <b>thousand</b> <b>feet</b> thick. The interfluves are believed to have been formed during the Late Pleistocene and feature river terraces. These were later identified as old and young floodplains of the Ravi River on the Kamalia and Chenab Plains. The old floodplains consist of Holocene deposits from the Ravi and Chenab rivers.|$|E

5|$|The entire Colorado Plateau {{then started}} to uplift from near sea level to several <b>thousand</b> <b>feet</b> (over a kilometer) in elevation. An {{alternate}} {{theory is that}} the Laramide orogeny uplifted what is today the Basin and Range and the Colorado Plateau and that the tensional forces that formed the Basin and Range caused that region to subside relative to the Colorado Plateau. Whatever the order of events were, the High Plateaus region of the Colorado Plateau were by now nearly complete.|$|E
5|$|The {{entire area}} {{underwent}} uplift during the Laramide orogeny between 70 and 40 {{million years ago}} which was {{also part of the}} Gunnison Uplift. This raised the Precambrian gneiss and schist that makes up the canyon walls. During the Tertiary from 26 to 35 million years ago large episodes of volcanism occurred in the area immediately surrounding the present day Black Canyon. The West Elk Mountains, La Sal Mountains, Henry Mountains, and Abajo Mountains all contributed to burying the area in several <b>thousand</b> <b>feet</b> of volcanic ash and debris.|$|E
5|$|The article {{explains}} {{the sequence of}} events of this August 4 New York City demonstration flight of 1895. When the reporter was all positioned and ready in the sky-cycle he gave word to the ground crew {{to let go of the}} ropes that held the hydrogen balloon back and it immediately lifted the sky-cycle into the air. The airship drifted up slowly at first, going towards the factory roof peaks. The driver-reporter immediately dropped one of the sandbag weights and the sky-cycle airship rose up sharply, avoiding the building roofs. When the airship was about a <b>thousand</b> <b>feet</b> high the attached balloon propeller revolved and the sky-cycle airship flew over the East River. The steamships and tugs that spotted the sky-cycle floating above tooted their whistles.|$|E

5|$|The sky-cycle airship {{continued}} {{to climb to}} about two <b>thousand</b> <b>feet</b> and then traveled north using the East River as a landmark and went to East Sixtieth Street. The reporter then steered the sky-cycle to One Hundred and Twenty-eighth Street. There he crossed the East River again and then hovered over Greenpoint. The reporter flew the sky-cycle until almost dark and landed safely at the property of P. B. Gupther in Yonkers. Gupther helped the reporter deflate the balloon and pack the airship down {{to the size of}} a flat carpet bag. He then drove the reporter with his sky-cycle airship to the railroad station so he could get back to his place of origin.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of air-to-air {{exercises}} and practice the Wing undertook a Circus operation on 3 August 1941. In the evening the Wing crossed out over Manston at 18,000ft and then dropped to 13,000ft over the coast at Gravelines and set course for Saint Omer. Near Ambleteuse five Bf 109Fs were sighted one <b>thousand</b> <b>feet</b> above and in front travelling past the Spitfires. The German fighters shadowed the flight before three detached and dived to attack, curving in from behind. The Spitfires turned into them. Finucane missed with his first burst of fire and chased the leading Bf 109 into cloud while following the Bf 109's condensation trail. Hitting the enemy with another burst from 200 yards the Bf 109 burst into flames. He sighted another formation of 18 Bf 109s above and climbed to attack supported by six Spitfires. Finucane scored hits on the tail unit of one which went down vertically and into a cloud layer at 2,000ft at which point contact was lost. Finucane claimed one destroyed and one probably destroyed. The operation elevated his tally to 7. The day was best remembered in Fighter Command {{for the loss of}} Flight Lieutenant Eric Lock who was shot down by ground-fire in the morning patrol.|$|E
5|$|On 22 November 1958, a B-47B Stratojet crashed {{while taking}} off from Loring, killing all four crewmembers on board. The plane belonged to a unit at McCoy Air Force Base in Orlando, Florida. The plane was {{described}} as having reached {{two-thirds of the way}} down the runway, when it veered sharply to the right, eventually crashing 400 feet north of the runway. On 25 November 1958, a KC-135 Stratotanker of the 42d Air Refueling Squadron crashed on takeoff roughly in the same area as the B-47 three days before. Two crewmembers were thrown to safety by the impact of the crash. The Air Force stated that after a four-hour mission, the crewmembers were practicing taking off and landing on the runway. On 18 November 1960, a KC-135 crashed upon landing at Loring, killing one and injuring sixteen others. The plane landed after a six-and-a-half-hour training mission, veered off {{to the left of the}} runway, and skidded three <b>thousand</b> <b>feet</b> while on fire. Surviving crewmembers were able to use the emergency chutes to evacuate the plane safely. On 9 May 1962, six crewmembers of a KC-135 were killed when their plane crashed during takeoff into a surrounding marsh, about fifteen hundred feet north of the runway. On 4 January 1965, four crewmembers were killed three miles north of Loring when their KC-135 crashed into the ground after takeoff. On 5 September 1969, a B-52 Stratofortress crashed approximately three miles north of the runway after taking off. Seven men were killed, including six crewmembers, during a Minimum Interval Takeoff drill. On 4 October 1989 a KC-135 crash killed all 4 crewmembers. The jet, which crashed about 2.4 miles off the TransCanada Highway in New Brunswick, was attempting to land at Loring.|$|E

25|$|Although {{standing}} {{in the shadow of}} its taller parent, Lingmell is very much a separate entity. In the manner of many fells it displays two contrasting aspects. The southern and western slopes– although steep– are smooth and rounded, while the northern and eastern faces fall as crags directly from the summit. The northern crag drops for a <b>thousand</b> <b>feet</b> toward the valley floor, with a further <b>thousand</b> <b>feet</b> of scree below.|$|E
