5|$|Przecław Lanckoroński, starost of Khmilnyk, {{appears on}} horseback in <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>right</b> of the painting. He is a notable {{military}} commander and his figure personifies the still-respectable military prowess of the Commonwealth.|$|E

5|$|To {{the right}} of the painting, daemons drag terrified women away. The woman in <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>right</b> hand corner turns to see flames {{reflected}} {{in the eyes of the}} daemon who holds her from behind, with a look of horrified guilt on her face. Behind her, other women struggle helplessly with the daemons or are carried away unconscious, having fainted.|$|E
5|$|The {{fuselage}} contained {{two major}} bulkheads, with the cockpit {{at the front}} of the first bulkhead. The nose was fitted with a rotating machine gun mount, offset to allow the pilot a better field of forward vision. The cockpit was fully glazed, with the exception of <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>right</b> section, which acted as a platform for the bombardier-gunner. The commonly-used Lotfernrohr-series bombsight penetrated through the cockpit floor into a protective housing on the external side of the cockpit.|$|E
5|$|The history text Zubdat-al Tawarikh, {{dedicated}} to Sultan Murad III in 1583, narrates {{a story of}} Uzair's grief {{for the destruction of}} Jerusalem. His grief {{is said to have been}} so great that God took his soul and brought him back to life after Jerusalem was reconstructed. In the miniature accompanying the manuscript, the building on <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>right</b> depicts the rebuilt city of Jerusalem in the form a typical sixteenth-century Ottoman building with a dome and an arched portico. The former ruins of Jerusalem are alluded to by the broken arches and columns on the left.|$|E

5|$|The print {{depicts a}} hollowed-out {{compound}} of three octahedra, a polyhedral compound composed of three interlocking regular octahedra, floating in space. Numerous other polyhedra and polyhedral compounds {{float in the}} background; the four largest are, on the upper left, the compound of cube and octahedron; on the upper right, the stella octangula; on the lower left, a compound of two cubes; and on <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>right,</b> a solid {{version of the same}} octahedron 3-compound. The smaller polyhedra visible within the print also include all of the five Platonic solids and the rhombic dodecahedron. In order to depict polyhedra accurately, Escher made models of them from cardboard.|$|E
5|$|In 1916, Pingali Venkayya {{submitted}} thirty new designs, in {{the form}} of a booklet funded by members of the High Court of Madras. These many proposals and recommendations did little more than keep the flag movement alive. The same year, Annie Besant and Bal Gangadhar Tilak adopted a new flag as part of the Home Rule Movement. The flag included the Union Jack in the upper left corner, a star and crescent in the upper right, and seven stars displayed diagonally from <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>right,</b> on a background of five red and four green alternating bands. The flag resulted in the first governmental initiative against any nationalistic flag, as a magistrate in Coimbatore banned its use. The ban was followed by a public debate on the function and importance of a national flag.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, {{the game}} was {{available}} either as a standalone packaged game, {{or as part of}} a special pack, which included one of only 25,000 limited edition, Zelda-themed Game Boy Advance SP. The Triforce SP is matte gold in color, with a Triforce logo stamped on the lid, and the Hyrule royal family crest printed on <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>right</b> face. As a launch promotion, Nintendo Europe also produced seven 24-carat gold plated Game Boy Advance SP consoles, with six given away to people who found a golden ticket inside their Triforce SP package, and a seventh as a magazine promotion. Thirty were autographed by Miyamoto himself {{at the opening of the}} Nintendo World Store in New York.|$|E

5|$|Jim Martin, {{positioned}} in <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>right,</b> gives a coy and perhaps mischievous glance {{back at the}} viewer. He {{is a microcosm of}} the entire scene in which no one appears to be giving thanks in a traditional manner of a Thanksgiving dinner. Solomon finds it a departure from previous depictions of Thanksgiving in that the participants do not lower their heads or raise their hands in the traditional poses of prayer. She sees it as an example of treating American traditions in both sanctified and casual ways. Theologian David Brown sees gratitude as implicit in the painting, while Kenneth Bendiner writes that Rockwell was mindful of the Last Supper and that the painting's perspective echoes its rendition by Tintoretto.|$|E

25|$|The {{production}} version used {{a simplified}} display system that removed the symbols. In their place, the original radar blip was displayed, but surrounded by additional {{data in the}} form of two-digit numbers. The track number remained in the upper left, but the altitude moved to <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>right.</b> In the upper right was the store number, the local set of registers storing this track. This allowed the system to have a global track number across the task force while each receiving CDS could assign it to a different local ID. In <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>right</b> was the category in the first digit and the size (single, small group, large formation; 1, 2, 3) in the second.|$|E

25|$|The four {{panels are}} most {{obviously}} connected by the floor tiling and vanishing point. Shadows {{falling on the}} tiling at <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>right</b> hand corner of each panel can only have been cast by the moulding on the frames, that is from an area outside of the pictorial space.|$|E
25|$|The flag of Juana Díaz is {{rectangular}} in shape, {{formed by}} two triangles whose hypotenuse {{extends from the}} upper left corner to <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>right</b> corner.
