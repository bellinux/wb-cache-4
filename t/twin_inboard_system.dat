5000|$|The H-110 Sarir (Persian: سریر, meaning [...] "Throne") is an Iranian UAV {{which was}} {{unveiled}} {{in a ceremony}} in April 2013 by IRIA. The UAV is optimized for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance roles using electro-optic and infra-red sensors. Iranian state media reports suggest it may be capable of carrying air-to-air weapons; however, independent verification of this has yet to emerge. The aircraft is fitted with <b>twin</b> <b>inboard</b> wing pylons to support stores carriage.|$|R
50|$|The Latécoère 550 had its {{tailplane}} {{mounted on}} top of the fuselage, strut braced from below and bearing <b>twin</b> <b>inboard</b> fins and rudders separately braced {{to the top of the}} fuselage. During flight trials, these vertical surfaces evolved in stages from a rather blunt shape, with extensions below the tailplane to a surface with a smoothly curved trailing edge entirely above the tailplane. The rudders were fitted with trim tabs. Because of the inboard rudders, the elevators had three sections.|$|R
5000|$|Sterndrive {{engines are}} similar to those used in true <b>inboard</b> <b>systems.</b> Historically the most popular in North America were [...] "marinised" [...] {{versions}} of Chevrolet and Ford V-8 automotive engines. In Europe diesel engines are more popular, ranging up to 400 hp in models such as the Volvo Penta D6A-400.|$|R
5000|$|The XB-47, {{which looked}} unlike any {{contemporary}} bomber, {{was described by}} some observers as a [...] "sleek, beautiful outcome that was highly advanced". The 35-degree swept wings were shoulder-mounted, with the <b>twin</b> <b>inboard</b> turbojet engines mounted in neat pods, and the outboard engines tacked under the wings short of the wingtips. With {{the exception of a}} change from the shoulder wing configuration to being under the fuselage and cockpit seating to side-by-side, most future airliners would use a similar configuration, with the engines mounted in underwing pylons. This arrangement would reduce the bending moment at the wing roots, saving structural weight. The mass of the engines also acted as counter-flutter weights.|$|R
50|$|Auxiliary {{power was}} {{provided}} by an outboard motor mounted on the port quarter of the transom, a small well inboard of the transom allowed the motor to be tilted {{out of the water}} when not in use. Although some boats were fitted with a small single or <b>twin</b> cylinder <b>inboard</b> engine by retrofit.|$|R
5000|$|The Squirrel {{name was}} used for Scott {{motorcycles}} since 1921 but {{with the death of}} the founder Alfred Angas Scott in 1923 the unorthodox Scott two-stroke motorcycles began to become more conventional. Development of the three-speed Scott Flying Squirrel began in 1922 as the company was in severe debt and faced receivership. Launched at the 1926 Earls Court motorcycle show, the Flying Squirrel was expensive - nearly twice the cost of a sporting four-stroke motorcycle of the time. [...] The unique water-cooled circulation used a convection method known as the thermosyphon system. The bottom end block was painted either green or red for racing or road respectively and featured a centrally positioned flywheel, <b>twin</b> <b>inboard</b> main bearings, overhung crankpins and doors to enable ease of access to the engine. The redesigned three-speed gearbox, multi-plate clutch and the repositioned magneto were all significant improvements.|$|R

Premises include specified relative plate motions for times prior to 10. 5 Myr ago and after 3 Myr ago, a mid-Tertiary bight in the continental margin, midcrustal detachment faults, rotation of the western Transverse Ranges about an eastern pivot, and specified fault displacement histories. Prior to 18 Myr ago, about 90 percent of the tangential component of Pacific-North America relative motion was accommodated on an offshore dextral fault system near the toe of the continental slope. From 18 to 5. 5 Myr ago, dextral slip was accommodated predominantly on the offshore system but also on a second, <b>inboard</b> <b>system</b> that included the San Andreas fault...|$|R
5000|$|Contra-rotating {{propellers}} have benefits when providing {{thrust for}} boats {{for the same}} reasons. ABB provided an azimuth thruster for ShinNihonkai Ferries in form of the CRP Azipod, claiming efficiency gains from the propeller (about 10% increase) and a simpler hull design. Volvo Penta have launched the IPS (<b>Inboard</b> Performance <b>System),</b> an integrated diesel, transmission and pulling contra-rotating propellers for motor yachts.|$|R
50|$|An <b>inboard</b> braking <b>system</b> is an {{automobile}} technology wherein the disc brakes are {{mounted on the}} chassis of the vehicle, rather than directly on the wheel hubs. The main advantages are twofold: {{a reduction in the}} unsprung weight of the wheel hubs, as this no longer includes the brake discs and calipers; also,braking torque applies directly to the chassis, rather than being taken through the suspension arms.|$|R

50|$|The {{twin engine}} NC.4-10 was an {{all-metal}} aircraft. It had low-set wings with a rectangular centre section, tapering outboard of the engines. The fuselage was flat sided and tapered aft {{to a high}} set tailplane. This carried <b>inboard</b> <b>twin</b> fins, tall and straight tapered, on top of it. The pilots' cabin was above the wing leading edge and the deep nose was largely glazed. There were three machine gun and one Hispano cannon positions. The two long floats were each mounted {{on a pair of}} near vertical faired struts, with further cross bracing.|$|R

40|$|The buffet {{response}} of the flexible twin-tail/delta wing configuration, a multidisciplinary problem, is solved using three sets of equations on a multi-block grid structure. The first set is the unsteady, compressible, full Navier-Stokes equations which are used for obtaining the flow-field vector and the aerodynamic loads on the twin tails. The second set is the coupled aeroelastic equations which are used for obtaining the bending and torsional deflections of the twin tails. The third set is the grid-displacement equations which are used for updating the grid coordinates due to the tail deflections. The computational model {{is similar to the}} one used by Washburn et. al. which consists of a delta wing of aspect ratio one and twin tails with taper ratios of 0. 23. The vortex of the twin tails are located at the wing trailing edge. The configuration is pitched at 30 deg angle of attack, and the freestream Mach number and Reynolds number are 0. 3 and 1. 25 million, respectively. With the twin tails fixed as rigid surfaces, the problem is solved for the initial flow conditions. Next, the problem is solved for the twin tail response for uncoupled bending and torsional vibrations due to the unsteady loads produced by the vortex breakdown flow of the leading-edge vortex cores. The configuration is investigated for three spanwise positions of the <b>twin</b> tails; <b>inboard,</b> midspan and outboard locations. The computational results are validated and are in very good agreement with the experimental data of Washburn, et. al...|$|R
40|$|The Guidance, Navigation, and Control Center (GNCC) at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has {{successfully}} developed high-accuracy autonomous satellite navigation systems using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) space and ground communications {{systems and the}} Global Positioning System (GPS). In addition, an autonomous navigation system that uses celestial object sensor measurements is currently under development and has been successfully tested using real Sun and Earth horizon measurements. The GNCC has developed advanced spacecraft systems that provide autonomous navigation and control of formation flyers in near-Earth, high-Earth, and libration point orbits. To support this effort, the GNCC is assessing the relative navigation accuracy achievable for proposed formations using GPS, intersatellite crosslink, ground-to-satellite Doppler, and celestial object sensor measurements. This paper evaluates the performance of these relative navigation approaches for three proposed missions with two or more vehicles maintaining relatively tight formations. High-fidelity simulations were performed to quantify the absolute and relative navigation accuracy {{as a function of}} navigation algorithm and measurement type. Realistically-simulated measurements were processed using the extended Kalman filter implemented in the GPS Enhanced <b>Inboard</b> Navigation <b>System</b> (GEONS) flight software developed by GSFC GNCC. Solutions obtained by simultaneously estimating all satellites in the formation were compared with the results obtained using a simpler approach based on differencing independently estimated state vectors...|$|R
40|$|After {{more than}} 20 years of {{operation}} and numerous modifications, a substantial modernisation of the <b>inboard</b> pellet injection <b>system</b> on ASDEX Upgrade was carried out. This enhancement {{was necessary to}} meet new functional requirements and to benefit from technical progress as well. New requirements are the integration in Discharge Control System, variation of settings of pellet train parameters during one discharge, temperature control of ice extrusion and overcome process limits caused by out-dated vacuum components. The Programmable Logic Controller system is now fully migrated to S 7 - 300 using High Speed Boolean Processor FM 352 - 5 to replace hard-wired logic elements and enable flexible control of process parameters.

40|$|We present {{full scale}} {{measurements}} on a yacht sailing upwind in moderate head swell * We highlight the unsteadiness of the loads : peaks may be twice the mean value * The dynamic behavior {{differs from the}} steady state : hysteresis loop * Experimental results compare well with an original FSI modelInternational audienceThis work presents a full scale experimental study on the aero-elastic wind/sails/rig interaction in real navigation conditions with the aim to give an experimental validation of unsteady fluid structure interaction (FSI) models applied to yacht sails. An <b>inboard</b> instrumentation <b>system</b> has been developed on a J 80 yacht to simultaneously and dynamically measure the navigation parameters, yacht's motion, and sails flying shape and loads in the standing and running rigging. The first results recorded while sailing upwind in head waves are shown. Variations of the measured parameters are characterized and related to the yacht motion (trim mainly). Correlations between the different parameters are examined. In the system's response to the dynamic forcing (pitching motion) we attempt {{to distinguish between the}} aerodynamic effect of varying apparent wind induced by the motion and the structural effect of varying stresses and strains due to the motion and inertia. The dynamic full scale measurements presented underline the necessity of considering the unsteadiness of phenomena to correctly simulate a yacht's behavior in actual sailing conditions. The simulation results from the FSI model compare very well with the experimental data for steady sailing conditions. For the unsteady conditions obtained in head waves, the first results show a good agreement between measurements and simulation...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} the Master Thesis Project "Single Skin Versus Sandwich: Material Concept of a Patrol Boat in a Life Cycle Cost Perspective" performed at Kockums AB, Karlskrona, and reviewed and graded at the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm. There are {{both economic and}} environmental gains of developing fuel-efficient (light) vessels. Kockums have successfully produced ships in sandwich composite material, which is a light and stiff but expensive material concept. Building a vessel in single skin composite might result in a lower total life cycle cost due to several factors. Kockums wish to acquire more information of the affecting factors thus they have initiated this project. The project includes analyzing the accumulated cost of a concept patrol vessel while changing five variables: class notation ("Patrol" or "Passenger"), operational profile (10 or 35 knots), material concept (sandwich or single skin), material (carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) and {{glass fiber reinforced polymer}} (GFRP)) and choice of propulsion system (controllable pitch propeller (CPP), <b>Inboard</b> Performance <b>System</b> (IPS) or water jet) resulting in 48 versions of the vessel. First, the structural arrangement was adapted to the design loads of each version by iteratively seeking the maximal structural utilization of the elements. This was done by using a computational tool (RSTRUCT) that allows for effective scantling calculation. Then, the material, production and operational cost were determined for each version and the break-even points in terms of years of operation were found. The results gave insights concerning the characteristics of the different material concepts. The single skin versions were found to be both heavier (70 %) and more costly in terms of material and production cost (17 %) in relation to their sandwich equivalents. The break-even points between CFRP versions and GFRP versions were ranging between 4 and 14 years, depending on operational profile. For example, for a very low speed profile passenger vessel the break-even point was 40 years, implying that the GFRP version was the most beneficial choice. Regarding propulsion choices, the IPS system was the best choice for every version due to its high overall propulsive coefficient in a broad speed range...|$|R

Although the Fe-Pb-Cu-(As-Ag) {{mineralization}} at Hornkullen in {{the classic}} Bergslagen ore province has been a subject of economical assessments earlier in addition of being mined intermittently during the last 100 s of years, the metallogenesis of the deposit is poorly constrained. The region enclosing the deposit has experienced a rather complex geological and tectonic evolution; consequently several conceivable processes that could have influenced the mineralization need to be considered. The mineralization, which is situated {{in the western part}} of the Bergslagen province in Sweden, is hosted in ca 1. 90 - 1. 88 Ga Svecofennian metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks. These were deposited in association with an extensional back-arc <b>system</b> <b>inboard</b> an active continental magmatic region (Allen et al. 1996). This succession subsequent underwent deformation and metamorphism during the Svecokarelian orogeny in regional greenschist to amphibolite facies (e. g. Stephens et al. 2008). At the western margin, the area was later intruded by younger granitoid rocks, (referred to as the GSDG intrusive rocks suite (Stephens et al. 2009) or the Trans-scandinavian Igneous Belt (e. g. Högdahl et al. 2004), locally the so-called Filipstad granite, dated at 1783 ± 10 Ma (Jarl & Johansson, 1988). The metasupracrustal rocks in the Hornkullen area are enclosed as an inlier in this intrusive suite. The region has also locally been affected by the ca 1. 0 - 0. 9 Ga Sveconorwegian orogeny (e. g. Stephens et al. 2009), probably in a brittle regime. The present hypothesis is that the mineralization is syngenetic, i. e. formed in conjunction with the Svecofennian volcanic activity. However, as stressed so far, the mineralization has been affected by several thermal and deformational processes following its formation. The aim of this project is therefore to assess whether the deposit comprises of metamorphically overprinted, syn-volcanic assemblages or not. To assess this, comprehensive studies of phase and textural relations on ore minerals were conducted. Additionally, fluid inclusion analysis is planned that would give further constrain on the ore-forming fluid. Tentative results so far suggest overprinting of brittle structures to some extent in the ore mineralogy. Dostępny również w formie drukowanej.
