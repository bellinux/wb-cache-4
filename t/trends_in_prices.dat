We show that revenue sharing is valuable in vertically separated industries in which demand is either stochastic (unpredictable) or variable (e. g., systematically declining), downstream inventory is chosen before demand is realized and downstream firms engage in intrabrand competition. Unlike two-part tariffs, revenue sharing achieves the first best outcome by softening retail price competition without distorting retailers ' inventory decisions.

5000|$|The wedge {{pattern is}} a {{commonly}} found pattern <b>in</b> the <b>price</b> charts of financially traded assets (stocks, bonds, futures, etc.). The pattern {{is characterized by}} a contracting range <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> coupled with an upward <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> (known as a rising wedge) or a downward <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> (known as a falling wedge). [...] __FORCETOC__A wedge pattern {{is considered to be a}} pattern which is forming at the top or bottom of the trend. It is a type of formation in which trading activities are confined within converging straight lines which form a pattern. It should take about 3 to 4 weeks to complete the wedge. This pattern has a rising or falling slant pointing in the same direction. It differs from the triangle in the sense that both boundary lines either slope up or down. Price breaking out point creates another difference from the triangle. Falling and rising wedges are a small part of intermediate or major trend. As they are reserved for minor trends, they are not considered to be major patterns. Once that basic or primary trend resumes itself, the wedge pattern loses its effectiveness as a technical indicator.|$|R
40|$|We use {{data from}} California to {{document}} and offer {{possible explanations for}} the sharp increase <b>in</b> hospital <b>prices</b> charged to private payers after 1999. We find a downward <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>price</b> for private pay patients in the 1990 s and a rapid upward <b>trend</b> beginning <b>in</b> 1999, amounting to an annual average increase of 10. 6 % per year over 1999 - 2005. <b>Prices</b> <b>in</b> 2006 were almost double <b>prices</b> <b>in</b> 1999. By contrast, there was little discernable <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> for Medicare and Medicaid patients, although these prices varied from year-to-year. Surprisingly, the increase <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> is not correlated, geographically, with the change in hospital market concentration. For example, the greatest price rises came from hospitals in monopoly and highly concentrated counties which experienced little or no change over our sample period. Two recent California state hospital regulations, the seismic retrofit mandate and the mandatory nurse staffing ratio affected hospital costs. However, the cost increases due to the nursing staffing regulations are not large enough {{to account for the}} price increase, and the price increase is not substantially correlated with the costs of compliance with the seismic retrofit mandate. Therefore, the source of the near-doubling of California hospital prices remains something of a mystery. ...|$|R

30|$|To {{develop a}} ROA {{framework}} of energy investment decision, this study made several simplifying assumptions leading to various limitations in the analyses. First, the coal prices {{are assumed to}} be stochastic and follow GBM. With the positive drift of coal prices from the ADF unit root test, this assumes that the <b>prices</b> are increasing <b>in</b> the long run. With coal being an exhaustible resource, the current demand path and competition may accelerate the upward <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> with higher volatility and uncertainty. On the other hand, this paper acknowledges that the rapid developments in renewable technologies may eventually reduce the demand for coal and its <b>price.</b> This <b>trend</b> <b>in</b> coal <b>price</b> and demand should be accounted for. Moreover, different models to describe stochastic prices of fossil fuels could also be used for further comparison of results using GBM.|$|R

To that end, we carry out a structural vector autoregression analysis on macroeconomic variables and private-sector expectations variables, using a time-varying parameters estimation technique with stochastic volatility. We show empirical evidence on two points. First, the BOJ's policy commitment regarding the future course of short-term interest rates, associated with only a small reduction in policy interest rates, succeeded in altering private-sector expectations. Second, the BOJ's policy commitment alone, nevertheless, was not sufficient to restore the previous <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> and output.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of the input-output price policy in agriculture on producers and consumers. <b>Trends</b> <b>in</b> <b>prices</b> cause immense resource transfers from agriculture, with adverse consequences for investment, output, employment, and income distribution. To the extent that these transfers accrue to industrialists and the government, the poorest benefit the least. These deleterious effects can be minimised by assured world prices for agriculture and restoration of true competition in agricultural commodity and input markets. In agricultural input markets, elimination of corruption; excessive profiteering and overstaffing should serve as the basis of a cost reduction strategy and removal of input subsidies. In the specific case of irrigation water, equitable distribution, compatibility of water rate assessment and water supply bases, and elimination of overstaffing are the prime issues deserving immediate government attention. ...|$|E

Successful trackers feed into a long term memory pool that can generalise across repeating trend patterns. Tests are performed to examine the algorithm’s ability to successfully identify <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> a small data set. The influence of the long term memory pool is then examined.

40|$|This paper studies these using a nonequilibrium price {{formation}} rule, {{developed in the}} context of trading with market orders. Because this is so much simpler than a standard inter-temporal equilibrium model, it is possible to study multi-period markets analytically. There price dynamics have second order oscillatory terms. Value investing does not necessarily cause prices to track values. Trend following causes short term <b>trends</b> <b>in</b> <b>prices,</b> but also causes longer-term oscillations. When value investing and trend following are combined, even though there is little linear structure, there can be boom-bust cycles, excess and temporally correlated volatility, and fat tails in price fluctuations. The long term evolution of markets can be studied in terms of flows of money. Profits can be decomposed in terms of aggregate pairwise correlations. Under reinvestment of profits this leads to a capital allocation model that is equivalent to a standard model in population biology. An investigation of market efficiency shows that patterns created by trend followers are more resistant to efficiency than those created by value investors, and that profit maximizing behavior slows the progression to efficiency. Order of magnitude estimates suggest that the timescale for efficiency is years to decades...|$|E
