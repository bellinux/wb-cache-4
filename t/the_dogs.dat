Unfortunately ice would form on the longer hair, and seeing that <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> were no longer effective rescue dogs, the monasteries gave them away to people in the surrounding Swiss valleys.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th century, New South Wales {{cattle farmer}} Thomas Hall crossed <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> used by drovers in his parents' home county, Northumberland, with dingoes he had tamed.

They were subsequently developed into two modern breeds: the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog. Robert Kaleski, who wrote the first standard for the breed, was influential in its development.|$|E
5000|$|The {{delivery}} truck shows {{up and the}} delivery man wheels in a large crate containing a loudly-barking dog. As Jerry signs for the crate, Tom is almost too scared to look on as he takes a crowbar to the crate. Jerry whistles for <b>the</b> loud <b>dog</b> to come out....and it is a tiny bulldog even smaller than Jerry is in stature (possibly due to Jerry's surname, [...] "Mouse", making <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> very small, {{about the same size}} as him). Tom is amazed to see <b>the</b> <b>dog's</b> small stature, but Jerry orders <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> to take care of Tom. After it sits around panting and barking, Jerry lifts up <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> and compares <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> to himself (Jerry being bigger than <b>the</b> <b>dog),</b> which causes <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> to snuggle up to him and fall on its head due to <b>the</b> <b>dog's</b> short legs. He lifts up <b>the</b> <b>dog,</b> who then licks him, as Tom comes out to investigate. Jerry takes <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> back into <b>the</b> crate with him, and ends up hanging on the tail when <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> wants to go out and meet Tom. Tom tosses <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> up a few times, pointing and laughing, which causes <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> to buzz saw his right arm hair off. He is still smiling until <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> repeats on <b>the</b> left arm, leading him to frantically try and shake <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> off. With a mouthful of fur, <b>the</b> <b>dog</b> hits <b>the</b> ground, only to buzzsaw on Tom's tail, turning part of it into sausages. Horrified at the state of his tail, he runs into the house screaming in terror. The rest of this short sees Tom without fur covering either of his arms, although he regains that of his tail.|$|R

5|$|Thomas Hall {{crossed his}} Drovers Dogs with dingoes he had tamed, and by 1840 was {{satisfied}} with his resulting progeny. During the next thirty years, the Halls Heelers, as they became known, were used only by the Halls. Given that they were dependent on <b>the</b> <b>dogs,</b> which gave them an advantage over other cattle breeders, {{it is understandable that}} <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> were not distributed beyond the Hall's properties. It was not until after Thomas Hall's death in 1870, when the properties went to auction with the stock on them, that Halls Heelers became freely available.|$|E
5|$|To adapt <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> to the {{confines}} of the tiny cabin of Sputnik 2, they were kept in progressively smaller cages for periods of up to 20 days. The extensive close confinement caused them to stop urinating or defecating, made them restless, and caused their general condition to deteriorate. Laxatives did not improve their condition, and the researchers found that only long periods of training proved effective. <b>The</b> <b>dogs</b> were placed in centrifuges that simulated the acceleration of a rocket launch and were placed in machines that simulated the noises of the spacecraft. This caused their pulses to double and their blood pressure to increase by 30–65 torr. <b>The</b> <b>dogs</b> were trained to eat a special high-nutrition gel that would be their food in space.|$|E
5|$|Western artists often infused Euro-American {{characteristics}} in their depictions of <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> of Polynesia and possibly many actually depicted the pet dogs kept on European ships rather than native breeds.

A few works likely depicting the aboriginal dog breed done by Parkinson, Webber, Alexander Buchan and John Frederick Miller were compiled by American anthropologist Katharine Luomala including the two images above.|$|E

Kenneth asks for someone at TGS to adopt <b>the</b> <b>dogs</b> and Tracy quickly brings them all to Liz's apartment to continue annoying her. Liz and Tracy go to Jack to finally resolve their conflict. Jack decides that, because Liz ruined Tracy's life with her book, Tracy should be given the right to ruin her life, and he orders Liz to sign over her life rights to Tracy. Jack tells Liz a story about an accident he had ice climbing, falling into a crevasse. He broke his leg and was unable to climb upwards to escape, but by going deeper down into the crevasse he found a path out. Liz applies this story to her situation with Tracy and stops resisting him, instead suggesting that Tracy make a pornographic film based on her life. Tracy agrees and moves out of Liz's apartment. In addition, Jenna and Liz resolve their issues when they see two adult stars acting out a scene of Jenna (Caitlin Fowler) and Liz (Savanna Samson) apologizing to one another.|$|E

The composition of the final polar group would be decided by Scott during the journey.
