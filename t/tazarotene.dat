5|$|Although {{the late}} stages of {{pregnancy}} {{are associated with}} an increase in sebaceous gland activity in the skin, pregnancy has not been reliably associated with worsened acne severity. In general, topically applied medications are considered the first-line approach to acne treatment during pregnancy, as they have little systemic absorption and are therefore unlikely to harm a developing fetus. Highly recommended therapies include topically applied benzoyl peroxide (category C) and azelaic acid (category B). Salicylic acid carries a category C safety rating due to higher systemic absorption (9–25%), and an association between the use of anti-inflammatory medications in the third trimester and adverse effects to the developing fetus including too little amniotic fluid in the uterus and early closure of the babies' ductus arteriosus blood vessel. Prolonged use of salicylic acid over significant areas of the skin or under occlusive dressings is not recommended as these methods increase systemic absorption and the potential for fetal harm. Tretinoin (category C) and adapalene (category C) are very poorly absorbed, but certain studies have suggested teratogenic effects in the first trimester. Due to persistent safety concerns, topical retinoids are not recommended for use during pregnancy. In studies examining the effects of topical retinoids during pregnancy, fetal harm has not been seen {{in the second and third}} trimesters. Retinoids contraindicated for use during pregnancy include the topical retinoid <b>tazarotene,</b> and oral retinoids isotretinoin and acitretin (all category X).

Methods: This was a prospective, right-left side intra-individual parallel 8 -week study using calcipotriol 0. 005 &#x 0025; ointment applied twice daily (right side) versus <b>tazarotene</b> (left side) randomized to either 0. 05 &#x 0025; (group I) or 0. 1 &#x 0025; gel (group II) once daily in two groups, each of 10 patients. Efficacy was determined by the assessment of target psoriatic lesions under evaluation by using the severity scale (0 - 3) of erythema, scaling, and infiltration (ESI score). Evaluation was done at baseline (0 week), 4 weeks, and 8 weeks of treatment. At the end of 8 weeks, patients with more than 75 &#x 0025; reduction in ESI score were considered to have marked improvement; 51 &#x 0025; to 75 &#x 0025;, moderate improvement; 26 &#x 0025; to 50 &#x 0025;, minimal improvement; and less than 25 &#x 0025;, non-responders. Results: Seventeen patients (9 in group I, 8 in group II) completed the study. In group I, reduction in ESI score was significantly more at both 4 and 8 weeks on sides treated with calcipotriol, producing moderate-to-marked improvement (P < 0. 05). In group II, improvement was comparable in lesions treated with either calcipotriol or <b>tazarotene</b> (0. 1 &#x 0025;) at the end of 4 and 8 weeks.

Medical treatment modalities offer cost reductions and clinical advantages in selected cases such as low-risk areas, surgically inaccessible sites, patients with multiple neoplasms, and older, infirm or anticoagulated subjects. <b>Tazarotene</b> has been proposed for the treatment of BCC; however, data on its efficacy are lacking. Objectives: To investigate the efficacy of <b>tazarotene</b> in a large series of BCCs, better to define the clinical advantages and the mechanisms of action in vivo. Methods: <b>Tazarotene</b> 0. 1 % gel was applied daily for 24 weeks to 154 small superficial and nodular BBCs. Clinicopathological changes were followed during the therapy by dermoscopic and histo-logical examination. Proliferation, retinoic acid receptors and apoptosis were investigated by immunohistochemistry and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphos-phate-biotin nick-end labelling on biopsies. Results: At 24 weeks of therapy, 70. 8 % of the BCCs showed > 50 % clinical and dermoscopic regression, and 30. 5 % healed without recurrences after 3 years of follow-up. At 12 weeks, biopsies showed that regression was associated with reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis of basaliomatous cells. Most unresponsive tumours displayed a keratotic differentiation.

We herein report two male patients presenting with multiple flat papules on the penis and scrotum. The second patient was HIV-positive. Histopathology showed features of bowenoid papulosis. Both the patients were treated with topical <b>tazarotene</b> gel 0. 05 &#x 0025;. Lesions cleared within 2 weeks in both the patients. Second patient had recurrences that cleared after retreatment with <b>tazarotene...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Tazarotene</b> is a pro-drug of {{the more}} water soluble tazarotenic acid, a receptor-selective acetylenic retinoid which binds to RARβ and RARγ and weakly to RARα. 1 Tazarotenic acid does not interconvert to any other retinoids that could {{potentially}} activate other retinoid receptors. In psoriasis, <b>tazarotene</b> normalizes keratinocyte differentiation, reverses keratinocyte hyperproliferation and has anti-inflammatory effects. In acne vulgaris, the abnormal desquamation of the follicular epithelium is normalized. 2 In October 2001, the US FDA approved Tazorac® cream 0. 1 % (<b>tazarotene,</b> Allergan) {{for the treatment of}} acne vulgaris. Since 1997, Tazorac ® gel (0. 05 % and 0. 1 %) has been available for the treatment of stable plaque psoriasis and the 0. 1 % gel is also indicated for the treatment of mild-to-moderately severe facial acne vulgaris. Tazorac ® cream (0. 05 % and 0. 1 %) was approved by the US FDA in 2000 for the treatment of plaqu...|$|E
40|$|Chronic sun {{exposure}} leads to photodamage, which is characterized clinically by fine and coarse wrinkles, dyspigmentation, telangiectasia, laxity, roughness and a sallow appearance. Many treatments claim {{to reduce the}} signs of photodamage, however evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCT) to support these claims is limited. The use of topical retinoids, particularly tretinoin, isotretinoin and <b>tazarotene,</b> {{has been shown to}} significantly reduce signs of photodamage both clinically and histologically. Over recent years a number of RCTs, have affirmed that topical <b>tazarotene</b> is an effective and safe treatment for photodamaged skin...|$|E
40|$|Basal cell carcinomas are {{the most}} common form of skin cancer. <b>Tazarotene</b> is a retinoic acid {{receptor}} selective retinoid that upregulates a tumor suppressor, tazarotene-induced gene 3 (TIG- 3), in keratinocytes and psoriasis. Expression of TIG- 3 in basal cell carcinomas was studied in an opened-label pilot biomarker study of 22 patients with basal cell carcinomas who applied <b>tazarotene</b> 0. 1 % gel for up to 12 wk prior to excision. Nineteen paired baseline and treated specimens were compared using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Compared to overlying normal epidermis, TIG- 3 protein and mRNA were decreased in 14 and 18 of 19 basal cell carcinomas (74 % and 95 %), respectively (p< 0. 001). <b>Tazarotene</b> treatment was associated with increased TIG- 3 protein and mRNA expression in basal cell carcinomas compared to baseline levels (p≤ 0. 001 and p= 0. 028, respectively). Sixty percent of basal cell carcinomas treated with <b>tazarotene</b> decreased in size by at least 25 %. Ten of 19 lesions improved histologically, including three complete responses. There was a correlation between the increased expression of TIG- 3 protein and histologic improvement (p= 0. 020), suggesting that suppression of TIG- 3 may underlie the development of basal cell carcinomas. This association suggests that reversal of TIG- 3 expression may help to explain the mechanism of retinoid action in epidermal differentiation and chemoprevention...|$|E
