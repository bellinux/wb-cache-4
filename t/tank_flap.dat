50|$|The Rapid {{introduced}} {{some new}} ‘Simply Clever‘ details, i.e. double sided mat in the boot (rubber/textile), warning vest holder under driver's seat, removable waste bin in door panelling and ice scraper on the fuel <b>tank</b> <b>flap.</b>|$|E
50|$|The car had modern {{features}} for 1964: squared-off body with flat roof panel and sharp tailfins, panoramic rear window and semi-panoramic windshield. Deluxe versions had then-fashionable quad headlights and (some series) two-tone paint.Since {{the layout of}} the first prototypes was created {{on the basis of the}} preceding M-407, the rear end design of the pre-facelift models inherited such characteristic features of the previous Moskvitch series as tailfins decorated with chrome trims, narrow taillights, a recognisable trunk handle, and a fuel <b>tank</b> <b>flap</b> in the middle, behind the number plate. The rear part of the car is equipped with two white reversing lights and is similar in appearance to that of many other automobiles of the 1950s-1960s such as the Peugeot 404 or the BMW 700, but has different contours and details.|$|E
40|$|A {{remote sensor}} is {{provided}} on a dispensing device in a filling station {{acting as a}} coarse positioning device which tests {{the distance to the}} body surface of the vehicle and the presence of an open <b>tank</b> <b>flap.</b> In order to initiate the filling process, the driver must enter an identification card in a card reader. With the device, {{it will be able to}} determine the precise location of the filling nozzle for the automatic filling of the vehicle irrespective of the type of vehicle or its dimensions. In order to be able to fill a wide variety of different vehicles automatically, the vehicle has a positioning element which can be scanned by a transmit and receive device. The transmit and receive device is connected to a computer which determines the exact location of the filling nozzle in relation to the dispensing device in conjunction with information provided by a data carrier on the vehicle. The device is suitable for the automatic filling of a wide variety of vehicles...|$|E

500|$|The A330 and A340 {{fuselage}} {{is based}} on that of the Airbus A300-600, with many common parts, and has the same external and cabin width: [...] and [...] Typical seating arrangements are 2–2–2 six-abreast in business class and 2–4–2 eight-abreast in economy class. The fin, rudder, elevators, horizontal tail plane are used as fuel <b>tank,</b> <b>flaps,</b> ailerons and spoilers are made of composite materials, making 10% of the structure weight When necessary, the A330 uses the Honeywell 331–350C auxiliary power unit (APU) to provide pneumatics and electrical power.|$|R
50|$|Modern cars often feature remote {{opening of}} the fuel <b>tank</b> fuel filler <b>flap</b> using an {{electric}} motor or cable release. For both convenience and security, many modern fuel tanks cannot be opened by hand or otherwise from {{the outside of the}} car.|$|R
50|$|The Lim-5M was {{regarded}} {{only as an}} interim variant, and work on a more advanced plane continued, testing many different ideas. In 1961, 40 Lim-6 attack aircraft were built. They introduced new blown flaps, but tests showed problems with the modified Lis-6 jet engine and the aircraft were not given to the Air Force. As a result, {{it was decided to}} redesign the thick wing sections with fuel <b>tanks,</b> blown <b>flaps,</b> double wheels and RATO and return to only slightly modified Lim-5 construction, with increased weapon-carrying capability instead.|$|R
40|$|To get {{a better}} insight in the effect of jets on vortex {{development}} and decay, stereo-PIV measurements were performed in a towing <b>tank</b> behind a <b>flapped</b> aircraft model. The experimental data set yields the wake vortex behavior in a range that extends from the vortex formation stage up to the mid-field (approximately t* = 2 corresponding to 100 wingspans for a = 0 º and 60 wingspans for a= 6 º). Although the jet {{does not affect the}} overall circulation strength, it has a significant effect on the velocity distribution in the wake. A new Double Gaussian vortex model is introduced that perfectly fits the measurement data. Aerospace Engineerin...|$|R

50|$|The {{end of the}} Vampire {{programme}} {{marked the}} beginning of an extended period when no complete aircraft were produced, although there was work for the company in various modification (see DHA-3 Drover) and repair and overhaul programmes, including repairing RAAF DHC-4 Caribous damaged on active service during the Vietnam War and major servicing of the RAAF Caribou fleet. The wings for the CAC CA-25 were built at Bankstown between 1956 and 1959. One design project pursued during this time was for a military jet trainer for the RAAF. HdH offered its P17 indigenous design derived from the Vampire and was also involved in the Government Aircraft Factories (GAF) F2 project, which would have seen HdH undertaking production work on this aircraft with GAF and the Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (CAC). The CAC-built version of the Aermacchi MB-326 was selected for production in 1965 and neither project proceeded. However all was not lost as CAC subcontracted to HdH the manufacture of the wings and wingtip fuel <b>tanks,</b> tailplanes, ailerons, <b>flaps,</b> hydraulic system components and landing gear for the Macchi, as well as parts of the Macchi's Viper engines built by CAC.|$|R
