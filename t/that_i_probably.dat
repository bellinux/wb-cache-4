And it's not just because I went 3-for-4, or had a great game.

[...] Shortly after the video was released, Slash {{said that he was}} [...] "flattered" [...] that Rihanna had impersonated him in the video, saying [...] "The video is way better with her being me than with me being me...all things considered, it brings an element of sexuality to it <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> wouldn't have been capable of. I think it's hot. Everything works out the way it's supposed to." ...|$|E
500|$|Not {{knowing when}} his next billed episode would be, Nimoy {{said in an}} {{interview}} before [...] "Momentum Deferred" [...] aired that he's [...] "waiting to see what these terribly imaginative writers come up with for the future. I’m expecting <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> will be going back to work for them before too much longer. I'm looking forward to what they send me on the page". After shooting the episode, Pinkner said [...] "We want him back as much as he wants to come back". Nimoy's next appearance occurred six episodes later, in [...] "Grey Matters". As a reference to a brief appearance by Nimoy's character William Bell, sound editor Bruce Tanis was instructed to create bells as a recurring motif in the scene when Bell encounters Olivia and gives her vital information about the parallel universe. Tanis explained that because he couldn't put the sound of bells in everything, he [...] "took some dry ice recordings and pitched them down considerably and reverbed them to become ringing tones that I played underneath the whole scene". Tanis also used some [...] "reversed" [...] ship's bells as well as crystal glass rubs in order to make Bell's office sound like multiple layers of glass and bell sounds; he referred to the scene as [...] "a little ominous" [...] but not [...] "too cliche".|$|E

500|$|The {{songs on}} the album were written {{at the same time}} as the songs on Body Talk Pt. 1. In mid-July 2010, music {{magazine}} Billboard reported that the mixing of the songs had been completed. Robyn worked primary with Swedish producer and songwriter Klas Åhlund, who was heavily involved in the production of Body Talk Pt. 1. Unlike the first installment, Body Talk Pt. 2 saw Robyn working with a few producers apart from Åhlund, such as Diplo, Kleerup, Niggaracci and electronic duo Savage Skulls. She also worked with American rapper Snoop Dogg on the song [...] "U Should Know Better". The two originally met when Robyn was asked to sing vocals on a remix of his single [...] "Sexual Eruption" [...] (2007). Six months later, they met up once again to write and record [...] "U Should Know Better." [...] While being interviewed by Billboard, Robyn spoke of the experience of working with the rapper, stating, [...] "It was really cool to be able to be in the studio with him, first because I always was a fan but also because he was really creative and we had so much of an exchange in being there together, both as vocalists. I had an idea and he really got it and got into it, which was awesome." [...] She also worked with Savage Skulls on two {{songs on the}} album; [...] "Love Kills" [...] and the iTunes exclusive [...] "Bad Gal". Robyn spoke of the duo, saying that [...] "these really young guys who are part of a scene <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> would've gotten into if I wasn't away so much when I was younger." ...|$|E

[...] He later recalled, [...] "During the third winter I even realized <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> would never learn to paint." [...] During these times of youthful adventure, Klee spent much time in pubs and had affairs with lower class women and artists' models. He had an illegitimate son in 1900 who died several weeks after birth.|$|E

2500|$|While {{not known}} for being an {{outstanding}} putter, Nicklaus was often {{able to make the}} important putts when he needed them. Nicklaus's putting was highly regarded by his rivals. He was also known as a conservative player at times, going for broke only when it was necessary. This was especially apparent on the green, where he would often choose to be less aggressive and make sure of an easy two-putt. Nicklaus spoke about this in his autobiography. [...] "I was a fine two-putter, but sometimes too defensive—too concerned about three-putting—to go for putts <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> should have gone for." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2015, Abrams ComicArts {{published}} the graphic novel adaptation of Leguizamo's one-man Broadway show, Ghetto Klown. As with the live show, the graphic novel explores the actor/comedian's life and career, beginning with his adolescence in Queens, New York, {{his involvement in}} '80s avant-garde theater, his feature film career, {{and some of the}} colorful characters he encountered throughout his life. Leguizamo describes the work thusly: [...] "Ghetto Klown is the history <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> never should have told anyone but my therapist, but it's a real lesson that even if you suffer a certain amount (a lot) of self-doubt and anxiety, you can still accomplish great things. It’s a lesson I'm really excited to impart to a whole new audience." [...] The comic [...] is illustrated by Christo Cassano.|$|E
2500|$|The race {{restarted}} with 129 laps {{to go and}} a multi-car wreck {{brought out}} the seventh caution of the race. It started when Busch spun out and collected Brad Keselowski.

Busch said afterwards {{that he thought he}} [...] "just missed the bottom groove by a few inches, got loose and the wreck was on. The way that our car was restarting it felt comfortable, it felt good. That inside with the rosin and the VHT, if you don’t hit it exactly right you lose a lot of time. I tried {{to make up for it}} and got loose. I feel really bad for the Monster Energy guys. We had a win in our sights and I just drove the car at 101 percent instead of that 99 <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> needed to be at." [...] Joey Logano assumed the race lead.|$|E

Should the convocation of governors {{of which you}} speak seem desirous to know my views on the present aspect of things, tell them you judge from my speeches that I will be inflexible on the territorial question; but I probably think either the Missouri line extended, or Douglas's and Eli Thayer's popular sovereignty would lose us everything we gain by the election; that filibustering for all south of us and making slave States of it would follow in spite of us, in either case; also <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> think all opposition, real and apparent, to the fugitive slave clause of the Constitution ought to be withdrawn.|$|E

The work, too, is very severe. But I am going on at the same tremendous rate everywhere. The staff, too, has had to be enlarged. Dolby was at Baltimore yesterday, is at Washington to-day, and will come back in the night, and start away again on Friday. We find it absolutely necessary for him to go on ahead. We have not printed or posted a single bill here, and have just sold ninety pounds' worth of paper we had got ready for bills. In such a rush a short newspaper advertisement is all we want. [...] "Doctor Marigold" [...] made a great hit here, and is looked forward to at Boston with especial interest. I go to Boston for another fortnight, on end, the 24th of February. The railway journeys distress me greatly. I get out into the open air (upon the break), and it snows and blows, and the train bumps, and the steam flies at me, until I am driven in again.|$|E
6000|$|In {{this manner}} she rambled on, gravely and communicatively, contradicting herself at times; not talking fast (she never did), but {{dropping}} one simple sentence, with an interval, after the other, {{with a certain}} richness of voice which always {{was part of the}} charm of her presence. She wished to be convinced against herself, and it was a comfort to her to hear herself argue. I was quite willing {{to be part of the}} audience, though I had to confine myself to very superficial remarks; for when I had said the event I feared would kill Miss Bernardstone I had said everything that was open to me. I had nothing to do with Lady Vandeleur's marrying, apart from <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> disappointed her. She had caught a glimpse of the moral beauty of self-sacrifice, of a certain ideal of conduct (I imagine it was rather new to her), and would have been glad to elicit from me, as a person of some experience of life, an assurance that such joys are not insubstantial. I had no wish to wind her up to a spiritual ecstasy from which she would inevitably descend again, and I let her deliver herself according to her humor, without attempting to answer for it that she would find renunciation the road to bliss. I believed that if she should give up Mr. Tester she would suffer accordingly; but I did n't think that a reason for not giving him up. Before I left her she said to me that nothing would induce her to do anything that she did n't think right. [...] "It would be no pleasure to me, don't you see? I should be always thinking that another way would have been better. Nothing would induce me,--nothing, nothing!" ...|$|E
