60|$|I {{have said}} that there was some good {{architectural}} effect in New York, and I alluded chiefly to that of the Fifth Avenue. The Fifth Avenue is the Belgrave Square, the Park Lane, and the Pall Mall of New York. It is certainly a very fine street. The houses in it are magnificent--not having that aristocratic look which some of our detached London residences enjoy, or the palatial appearance of an old-fashioned hotel in Paris, but an air of comfortable luxury and commercial wealth which is not excelled by the best houses of any other town that I know. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>houses,</b> not hotels or palaces; but they are very roomy houses, with every luxury that complete finish can give them. Many of them cover large spaces of the ground, and their rent will sometimes go up as high as 800 pounds and 1000 pounds a year. Generally the best of these houses are owned by those who live in them, and rent is not, therefore, paid. But this is not always the case, and the sums named above may be taken as expressing their value. In England a man should have a very large income indeed who could afford to pay 1000 pounds a year for his house in London. Such a one would {{as a matter of course}} have an establishment in the country, and be an earl, or a duke, or a millionaire. But it is different in New York. The resident there shows his wealth chiefly by his house; and though he may probably have a villa at Newport or a box somewhere up the Hudson, he has no second establishment. Such a house, therefore, will not represent a total expenditure of above 4000 pounds a year.|$|E
6000|$|As to the inns or hotels at Hamburg, I should {{recommend}} you to some German inn. Wordsworth and I {{were at the}} [...] "Der Wilde Man," [...] and dirty as it was, I could not find any inn in Germany very much cleaner, except at Lubec. But {{if you go to}} an English inn, for heaven's sake, avoid the [...] "Shakspeare," [...] at Altona, and the [...] "King of England," [...] at Hamburg. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>houses</b> of plunder rather than entertainment. [...] "The Duke of York" [...] hotel, kept by Seaman, has a better reputation, and thither I would advise you to repair; and I advise you to pay your bill every morning at breakfast time: {{it is the only way}} to escape imposition. What the Hamburg merchants may be I know not, but the tradesmen are knaves. Scoundrels, with yellow-white phizzes, that bring disgrace on the complexion of a bad tallow candle. Now as to carriage, I know scarcely what to advise; only make up your mind to the very worst vehicles, with the very worst horses, drawn by the very worst postillions, over the very worst roads, and halting two hours at each time they change horses, at the very worst inns; and you have a fair, unexaggerated picture of travelling in North Germany. The cheapest way is the best; go by the common post wagons, or stage coaches. What are called extraordinaries, or post-chaises, are little wicker carts, uncovered, with moveable benches or forms in them, execrable in every respect. And if you buy a vehicle at Hamburg, you can get none decent under thirty or forty guineas, and very probably it will break to pieces on the infernal roads. The canal boats are delightful, but the porters everywhere in the United Provinces, are an impudent, abominable, and dishonest race. You must carry as little luggage as you well can with you, in the canal boats, and when you land, get recommended to an inn beforehand, and bargain with the porters first of all, and never lose sight of them, or you may never see your portmanteau or baggage again.|$|E

40|$|Contemporary North American synagogues serve several {{purposes}} for its congregants including: <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>houses</b> of prayer, houses of community, and houses of learning. These {{various aspects of}} the synagogue life bring about different expectations and images regarding the roles, functions and goals of synagogues. ^ Individuals who relate to the synagogue as members or as paid staff experience different images of what synagogues are. The images are based on past experiences and expectations. In this study the dominant images explore synagogues as families, as businesses, workplaces, and community centers. Each one of these images interacts to some degree with aspects of another image, compete with it and influences it. ^ The dissertation reports and analyses data gathered through an in-depth qualitative study of one conservative mid-sized synagogue in a large metropolitan area. The study consisted of observations, interviews and examination of resource materials. The framework for analysis used organizational and social systems theories and theories of family life. ^ The organizational analysis revealed several important elements: Synagogues as organizations that preserve traditions, resist change in many aspects of its life, including financial, social and ritual matters. Like in families, transmission of values and traditions to the younger generation are among the most important elements of contemporary synagogue life. As multigenerational organizations, synagogues have to face transitions of leadership roles between generations, balancing the values that are important to all generations. Like in families, the values of loyalty, love, respect to the older, 2 ̆ 2 parental 2 ̆ 2 generation are very important to synagogues. ^ On the other hand, the administrative work structure of synagogues is a hierarchical, corporate structure. The expectations of love, loyalty, preservation of tradition while attempting to maintain budgets and planning for growth within that work structure bring about complex decision making mechanisms and organizational dynamics. ^ The rabbi especially and other employees as well, experience role conflicts as the 2 ̆ 2 parents 2 ̆ 2, authority figures of the congregants on one hand, yet as 2 ̆ 2 children 2 ̆ 2, supervised and hired by the members in the synagogue family. ...|$|E
