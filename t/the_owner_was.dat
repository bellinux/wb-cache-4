5|$|As {{with other}} sports, vinkensport {{has had its}} {{cheating}} scandals, as well as accusations of artificial enhancement. One finch sang a record 1,278 susk-e-weits in one hour, and <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> <b>was</b> later accused of doping the bird with testosterone. After one contestant sang exactly {{the same number of}} calls in two rounds, the box was opened and a mini CD player was discovered within.|$|E
5|$|Further {{work was}} done on the {{property}} in the early 18th century, providing an additional service room and bedrooms. The Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745 impacted on the hall, which {{was close to the}} Scottish border. In 1715, William Wybergh, <b>the</b> <b>owner,</b> <b>was</b> abducted by Scottish soldiers, and in 1745, shortly before the Clifton Moor Skirmish, it was occupied and looted by the rebel forces.|$|E
5|$|The {{compound}} had no Internet or landline telephone service. Its residents burned their refuse, {{unlike their}} neighbors, who set their garbage out for collection.

Following the American raid and killing of bin Laden, the Pakistani government demolished the compound in February 2012.|$|E

5|$|A {{full-size}} {{reproduction of}} September Morn was {{displayed in a}} window of Jackson and Semmelmeyer, a photography shop in Chicago, Illinois, in March 1913. A passing police officer noticed the print and on grounds that it was indecent, insisted it be taken down. The mayor of the city, Carter Harrison, Jr., agreed with the policeman's decision, and deemed that the image could be sold, but should not be displayed in public as children could see it. Fred Jackson, <b>the</b> <b>owner,</b> <b>was</b> charged with indecency, and at his request the case was brought to trial on March 18.|$|E
5|$|Formerly {{known as}} the Kamloops Aero Club, the Kamloops Flying Club {{operates}} at the airport, which is a club where children receive a flight in an airplane with the pilot and learn about the airplanes themselves. In addition, the flight school Canadian Flight Centre is based on site; the branch based in Boundary Bay, Delta opened a location in Kamloops in May2012 and uses Cessna aircraft for its lessons. Canadian Helicopters operates a training facility for the Kamloops Airport Other related facilities include Astaris Canada, CC Helicopters, Highland Helicopters and WestAir Aviation. Formerly, Flight Discovery operated as a flight school at the airport, but <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> <b>was</b> deemed a fraud artist.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Dull began {{a search}} for a new {{official}} symbol to represent the Institute. He specifically wanted a classic pre-war Ford. Dull's search would entail newspaper ads, radio commercials, and other means to locate this vehicle. The search took him throughout the state and country, but no suitable vehicle was found until the autumn of 1960. Dean Dull spotted a polished 1930 Ford Model A outside of his apartment located in Towers Dormitory. <b>The</b> <b>owner</b> <b>was</b> Captain Ted J.

5|$|As the Browns recaptured {{a hint of}} past {{success in}} 1994, all was not well behind the scenes. Modell was in {{financial}} trouble. The origins of Modell's woes dated to 1973, when he worked out a deal to lease Cleveland Municipal Stadium from the city for a pittance: only enough to service the facility's debt and pay property taxes. Cleveland Browns Stadium Corporation, or Stadium Corp., a company Modell and a business associate created and owned, held the 25-year lease. Stadium Corp. then subleased the stadium to the Browns and the Cleveland Indians, and rented it out for concerts and other events. While the deal worked fine {{for the city and}} Modell early on, <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> <b>was</b> later dogged by excessive borrowing and lawsuits.|$|E
5|$|Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis paired {{up to do}} slapstick comedy for {{the first}} time at the 500 Club on July 25, 1946. While Martin was trying to get gigs as a singer, Lewis {{performed}} as a comedian at the club. One night a different act failed to show up and Lewis suggested to the owner that he hire Martin to do comedy with him. <b>The</b> <b>owner</b> <b>was</b> skeptical, but the two went ahead and tried to devise an act on paper in their hotel room, which did not work. The next night, they went on stage and improvised for three hours, bringing the house down. The comedy duo of Martin and Lewis was popular in nightclubs and in film from 1946 to 1956.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{extension}} of the Metropolitan Railway to Ruislip, and the resulting influx of visitors to the area, Albert Cross built a bungalow from where teas were served to day-trippers. This became a success and Cross had the building expanded, which soon became the Orchard Hotel. Between 1933 and 1971 it became an Ansells licensed bar and well known high class restaurant. It then became a Beefeater steak house, which it remains, and was recently extended with a Premier Inn hotel. During the Battle of Britain, the Orchard was very popular with the pilots of No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron stationed at RAF Northolt, who celebrated many of their successes in battle there. <b>The</b> <b>owner</b> <b>was</b> known to open a bottle of champagne for each German aircraft shot down by the squadron.|$|E

5|$|The Act was unusual, {{as it was}} {{obtained}} without Pyott's consent, and created {{a new group of}} commissioners from local justices and dignitaries. They were empowered to set the rates for tolls, and <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> <b>was</b> obliged to transport all goods at the established rates. If there were not sufficient boats and the owner did not provide more, they could license others to provide carriage services. They could also order that locks, wharves and warehouses should be erected. The size of boats was specified, and were to be capable of carrying between 20 and 30 tons of cargo. The tolls set were quite moderate, and a group of merchants appear to have leased the river from Pyott for a period after 1767, but he eventually took control again.|$|E
5|$|A {{system of}} hiring stallions between districts existed in Scotland, with written records {{dating back to}} 1837. This program {{consisted}} of local agriculture improvement societies holding breed shows to choose the best stallion, whose owner was then awarded a monetary prize. <b>The</b> <b>owner</b> <b>was</b> then required, in return for additional monies, to take the stallion throughout a designated area, breeding to the local mares. Through this system and by purchase, Clydesdale stallions were sent throughout Scotland and into northern England. Through extensive crossbreeding with local mares, these stallions spread the Clydesdale type throughout the areas where they were placed, and by 1840, Scottish draught horses and the Clydesdale were one and the same. In 1877, the Clydesdale Horse Society of Scotland was formed, followed in 1879 by the American Clydesdale Association (later renamed the Clydesdale Breeders of the USA), which served both U.S. and Canadian breed enthusiasts. The first American stud book was published in 1882. In 1883, the short-lived Select Clydesdale Horse Society was founded {{to compete with the}} Clydesdale Horse Society. It was started by two breeders dedicated to improving the breed, who also were responsible in large part for the introduction of Shire blood into the Clydesdale.|$|E
5|$|The Ramblin' Wreck, {{the iconic}} 1930 Ford Model A Sport coupe {{that serves as}} the {{official}} mascot of the student body, was acquired in this era. The Wreck is present at all major sporting events and student body functions, and leads the football team into Bobby Dodd Stadium at Historic Grant Field, a duty it has performed since 1961. Dean of Student Affairs Jim Dull recognized a need for an official Ramblin' Wreck when he observed the student body's fascination with classic cars. Fraternities, in particular, would parade around their House Wrecks as displays of school spirit and enthusiasm. It was considered a rite of passage to own a broken-down vehicle. In 1960, Dull began a search for a new official symbol to represent the Institute. He specifically wanted a classic pre-war Ford. Dull's search employed newspaper ads, radio commercials, and other means to locate this vehicle. The search took him throughout the state and country, but no suitable vehicle was found until the autumn of 1960 when Dull spotted a polished 1930 Ford Model A outside of his apartment located in Towers Dormitory. <b>The</b> <b>owner</b> <b>was</b> Captain Ted J. Johnson, Atlanta's chief Delta Air Lines pilot. When Johnson returned to his car, he found a note from Dull attached to his windshield. Dull's note offered to purchase the car to serve as Georgia Tech's official mascot. Johnson, after great deliberation, agreed to take $1,000; he eventually returned the money in 1984 so that the car would be remembered as an official donation to Georgia Tech and the Alexander-Tharpe Fund. The Ramblin' Wreck was officially transferred to the Athletic Association on May 26, 1961.|$|E

The title was Marvel Science Stories for five issues, then Marvel Tales for two issues, and then Marvel Stories {{for the last two}} issues of the first run. The {{publisher}} for the first series was listed as Postal Publications of Chicago for the first four issues, and as Western Publishing of New York and Chicago; in both cases <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> <b>was</b> Martin and Abraham Goodman. The intended schedule was bimonthly but this was never achieved. The editor was Robert O. Erisman. The second incarnation of the magazine lasted for six issues on a more regular quarterly schedule, starting in November 1950. The price was 25 cents and the page count was 128 pages for all six issues; the first two issues and last issue of this sequence were in pulp format, and the three from May 1951 to November 1951 were in digest format.

25|$|Fields Mill on Broom Hill burnt down in 1875. In Dickens' {{times the}} Miller was a Mr Clark, but <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> <b>was</b> Mr Field.

25|$|According to the Talmud, the {{requirement}} to separate Challah from the dough was imposed on {{the owner of the}} dough, not on the person who kneaded it; hence if <b>the</b> <b>owner</b> <b>was</b> not Jewish, even if the kneader was, Hafrashat Challah was not mandatory. The requirement does not apply to quantities of less than one omer, neither to bread prepared as animal feed nor to dough prepared from a flour derived from other cereal grains, excepting wheat, barley, oat (var. goatgrass), spelt, or rye (var. wild barley), which grains are obligated. Although the Biblical expression when you eat of the bread of the land might be understood as applying only to bread eaten in the Land of Israel, Rabbinic sources interpret that Hafrashat Challah should be observed in the Diaspora as well.|$|E
