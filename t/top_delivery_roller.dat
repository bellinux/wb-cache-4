25|$|Twisting is {{the process}} in which two or more single-spun yarns are united to produce a yarn of greater {{strength}} for use as warp threads in the weaving process and for normal knitting purposes. This is done by rollers delivering the yarns to a revolving spindle which twists or folds the single yarns around one another. The machines used are similar to spinning frames in their method of applying twist, but differ in that they have only one set of <b>delivery</b> <b>rollers</b> {{instead of the usual}} complement of drafting rollers. This machine is an early example of a flyer twisting frame. On the flyer twister, twist imparted to the yarn in a similar manner as on the flyer spinner. A weighted band, running in a groove {{at the base of the}} bobbin, retards the revolving bobbin creating enough tension for the flyer to wind the yarn evenly onto the bobbin.

40|$|Objectives To compare prospectively {{maternal}} {{acceptance of}} fetal and neonatal virtuopsy {{with that of}} conventional autopsy and to determine the confidence with which magnetic resonance (MR) virtuopsy {{can be used to}} diagnose normality/abnormality of various fetal anatomical structures. Methods MR and/or computed tomography virtuopsy and conventional autopsy were offered to 96 women (102 fetuses/neonates) following termination of pregnancy (TOP), intrauterine fetal death (IUFD) or neonatal death. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the effect on maternal acceptance of virtuopsy and/or conventional autopsy of the age of the mother, gestational age at <b>TOP</b> or <b>delivery</b> after IUFD, order of pregnancy, parity, religion, type of caregiver obtaining consent and reason for death. When parents consented to both MR virtuopsy and conventional autopsy of fetuses ≥ 20 weeks of gestation or neonates, the confidence with which MR virtuopsy could be used to diagnose normality/abnormality of various anatomical structures was determined on a scale in which conventional autopsy was considered gold standard. On autopsy we classified fetuses/neonates as having either 'normal' or 'abnormal' anatomical structures; these groups were analyzed separately. At virtuopsy, we indicated confidence of diagnosis of normality/abnormality of every anatomical structure in each of these two groups defined at autopsy, using a scale from 0 (definitely abnormal) to 100 (definitely normal). Results Of the 96 women, 99 % (n = 95) consented to virtuopsy and 61. 5 % (n = 59) to both conventional autopsy and virtuopsy; i. e. 36 (37. 5 %) consented to virtuopsy alone. Maternal acceptance of conventional autopsy was independently positively related to singleton pregnancy, non-Moslem mother, earlier gestation at <b>TOP</b> or <b>delivery</b> afer IUFD and a maternal-fetal medicine specialist obtaining consent. Thirty-three fetuses ≥ 20 weeks of gestation had both conventional autopsy and MR virtuopsy, of which 19 had a full autopsy including the brain. In fetuses with normal anatomical structures at conventional autopsy, MR virtuopsy was associated with high diagnostic confidence (scores > 80) for the brain, skeleton, thoracic organs except the heart, abdominal organs except the pancreas, ureters, bladder and genitals. In fetuses with abnormal anatomical structures at autopsy, MR virtuopsy detected the anomalies with high confidence (scores < 20) for these same anatomical structures. However, in three cases, virtuopsy diagnosed brain anomalies additional to those observed at conventional autopsy. Conclusion MR virtuopsy is accepted by nearly all mothers while conventional autopsy is accepted by about two-thirds of mothers, in whom refusal depends mainly on factors over which we have no control. Although conventional autopsy remains the gold standard, the high acceptance of virtuopsy makes it an acceptable alternative when the former is declined. Copyright © 2012 ISUOG.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{investigate}} whether {{a number of}} variables specific to a vessel, the contracting parties, or market conditions affect the price charged for the ship. Literature in maritime economics {{seems to suggest that}} competitive shipbuilders are price takers, and thus have little influence on the prices they charge ship owners. However, deviations in price for comparable vessels contracted in the same period are observed. Determinants derived from contract information and market conditions make up the covariates of the study, and we are particularly interested in the effects of delivery time, shipyard experience and firm size. The data sample contains contract information on 3, 759 individual ships constructed at 77 shipyards between 1990 and 2014. We perform separate fixed effects regressions on the shipbuilding segments of bulk, container and tanker vessels, in order to incorporate shipyard and ship owner heterogeneity as well as capture segment specific effects. The results suggest that macroeconomic determinants are the most influential covariates, although we also find the microeconomic determinants gross tonnage, <b>top</b> speed, <b>delivery</b> time, as well as ship owner and shipyard heterogeneity affecting prices. The effects from these covariates prove to have different effects in the three segments.

40|$|Traditional {{emergency}} service major incident table top training exercises are presented via ‘low-technology’ means, such as plastic bricks and paper maps, or ‘front-loaded’ via slides presented by an instructor. The {{purpose of this}} research was to develop a new, electronic approach to table <b>top</b> <b>delivery,</b> to address issues with the existing approaches and provide a usable, more useful, streamlined user experience that was acceptable for major incident education. While the benefits of the existing paper-based approaches include their: affordability; reliability; portability; accessibility and acceptability, they do not permit the recording of exercise progress. Presentations by instructors can result in a lack of candidate participation and physical maps can become cluttered and cause a loss of data when disturbed. Additionally, supporting information required by participants during the scenario is presented as an adjunct to the exercise, necessitating supplementary display equipment. To address these issues, low-cost, bespoke, interactive software solutions for major incident training were created. The usability and acceptability of these products were tested within two populations routinely using table top exercises, via an experimentally-led ‘research in the wild’ approach. These were healthcare professionals, attending the international Major Incident Medical Management and Support (MIMMS) courses, and Greater Manchester Police (GMP) Officers. An experimental approach was adopted to attain realistic responses from the target audience regarding table top use. Given the nature of this form of incident response training, we were constrained to conducting experiments in a non-intrusive way, to neither interfere with, nor distract from, the participants’ learning experiences. Three experiments were designed to establish the viability of this development. Two one centre, one sample studies were conducted, followed by a multicentre controlled trial. The one sample studies consisted of a pilot that explored proof of concept, focussing on table top usability by non-computing expert users, and a second study which determined the validity of the pilot’s findings within a larger sample size. The multicentre controlled trial compared paper-based table top with electronic table top cohorts in terms of the participant learning experience and, thereby, fitness for purpose. 6 candidates piloted the prototype MIMMS electronic exercise in February 2011. 114 Police Officers utilised the GMP table top during November and December 2011. The multicentre controlled MIMMS trial enrolled 23 candidates (n= 11 electronic and n= 12 paper-based table top cohorts) from courses held at 3 U. K. centres. Both the healthcare and policing trial participants evaluating the table top respectively rated significant levels of agreement with the software being fit for purpose and usable. Candidate results from the multicentre MIMMS trial indicated positive findings regarding the equivalency of the electronic with the existing, paper-based media. The MIMMS pilot trial was an acceptable proof of concept, justifying the further development of this work. The GMP study affirmed these findings for a larger sample size. The MIMMS multicentre controlled trial demonstrated the comparability of the electronic table top with its paper-based counterpart, in terms of the learning experience provided and affirmed this approach as fit for purpose.

40|$|Mechanical {{properties}} such as load-deflection {{relationship and}} {{modulus of rigidity}} on the twisting of yarn in stationary state have been studied by many researchers. But on the twisting of yarn in rnnning state there are few fundamental studies, experimental or theoretical, except Tobisch 2 ̆ 7 s theory. Tobisch derived his theory {{on the assumption that}} the number of twists of yarn per unit length, or twist density, was uniform everywhere in the twisting field, but this is true only when the delivery velocity is very small or the internal friction of yarn is negligible. The author has made theoretical and experimental studies on the twisting of yarn in running state, considering it as a visco-elastic body made of homogeneous and uniform materials. The studies may be briefly summerized in the following outline. 　(1) A yarn of total length L is fixed at both ends. This yarn is divided into two parts, the length l of it being twisted and the other length L-l free from twisting. If a point fixed between these two parts is suddenly released, twisting will be transmitted to the untwisted part. The theory of this transient transmission of twisting has been treated by solving the following partial differential equation :　p(∂^ 2 θ/∂t^ 2) = G(∂^ 2 θ/∂x^ 2) + η(∂^ 3 θ/∂t∂x^ 2) 　where p = the density of yarn　θ = angle of torsion at x along the yarn　t = time G = modulus of rigidity of yarn. 　η = tangential coefficient of viscosity at the cross section of yarn. 　In the case under consideration, let the angles of torsion along the yarn and at the end of the lenght l be Θ and θ_ 0 respectively. Then the following relation holds : θ=Θ-θ_(0 x) /L. The solution of the above differential equation by the use of this relation and initial and boundary conditions in this case has shown that the twist density of yarn transmitted to the untwisted part is exponentially increased with time and approaches to θ_ 0 /L. 　(2) A high speed camera by which 64 pictures could be taken per second was used in order to confirm the above theory. The results measured coincided satisfactorily with the theory. 　(3) When the yarn was fixed at one end and free at the other and the twisting moment was applied at the free end, the above differential equation was solved under the initial and boundary conditions in this case. The twist density of yarn in this transient case also approaches exponentially to θ_ 0 /L with time. 　(4) In the running yarn, the following transformation of coordinates was used : x=ξ+vt, where v is the velocity of the running yarn, x is a fixed coordinate in yarn and ξ is in space. By solving this transformed equation, it has been shown that the twist density of running yarn with only internal friction is in steady state exponentially decreased from the twisting element, say the aperture of flyer, to the nip point of <b>delivery</b> <b>roller.</b> 　(5) Also by the solution of the above transformed equation, Ball 2 ̆ 7 s distribution diagram of twist in the twisting fields of the ring frame and mule has proved to be the distributed one in a case when the yarn is considered as a visco-elastic body with solid friction. 　(6) In the yarn with plasticity, the twisting field is divied into two Zones : an elastic zone ξ= 0 -ξ_ 1. and a plastic zone ξ=ξ_ 1 -L. The equations of twist density in elastic and plastic zones have been derived under considerations of the boundary conditions. An experiment of twisting rayon yarn with the flyer frame showed that these twe zones occurred and could be explained by substituting appropriate numerical values into the above derived equations. 　(7) When the internal friction of yarn is negligible or the delivery velocity of yarn is very small, Tobisch 2 ̆ 7 s theory is applicable. So, in such a state, the double twisting principle of tyre cord has been analyzed by this theory. 　(8) The re-distribution of twists in the twisting field by the invasion of twisted yarn into the untwisted field or by its regression from the twisting field with the introduction of untwisted yarn is occasionally important in spinning operation, especially in false twisting of worsted spinning and rotating funnel of high draft system in cotton spinning. The state of this re-distribution was experimentally studied by photographing the twisting operation in one twisting field, and the results measured could be qualitatively explained by the above described theorics. 　(9) The permanent deformations of twisted yarn set by steam or initially applied tension were studied by measuring the free rotating angle about the axis of the yarn loaded axially. According to these experiments, the permanent sets are 0 - 28...|$|R

Aim: To provide a systematic overview of studies on gynaecological and obstetrical bleeding problems in women with FXI deficiency. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane library for studies that present original data on the incidence of and treatment options for gynaecological and obstetrical bleeding in FXI-deficient women. Results: We identified 27 studies, including a total of 372 women with FXI deficiency. All studies were observational, no interventional treatment studies were found. Most patients had a mild deficiency (FXI >= 20 IU dL(- 1)). Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) was reported in 7 - 67 %. In 7 / 19 (37 %) women who underwent gynaecological procedures, a bleeding complication occurred, including in 2 / 7 hysterectomies (29 %). About 3 - 20 % of reported pregnancies ended in a miscarriage; of these miscarriages 0 - 25 % (4 / 23 miscarriages) were complicated by bleeding. Terminations of pregnancies (TOP) were complicated by bleeding in 4 out of 11 cases (36 %). In 90 out of 498 (18 %) deliveries a postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) was reported, ranging from 0 to 50 % in individual studies. In 21 % (66 / 321) of deliveries, prophylaxis was given.
