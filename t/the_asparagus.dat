500|$|The long narrow {{geography}} of the South Island ensures that no vineyard is more than [...] from the coast. The cool, maritime climate of the area allows for a long and steady growing season in which the grapes can ripen and develop a natural balance of acids and sugars. This brings out the flavors and intensity that distinguish New Zealand Sauvignon blancs. More recently, Waipara in the South Island and Gisborne and Hawkes Bay in the North Island have been attracting attention for their Sauvignon blanc releases, which often exhibit subtle differences to those from Marlborough. <b>The</b> <b>asparagus,</b> gooseberry and green flavor commonly associated with New Zealand Sauvignon blanc is derived from flavor compounds known as methoxypyrazines that becomes more pronounced and concentrated in wines from cooler climate regions. Riper flavors such as passion fruit, along with other notes such as boxwood, may be driven by thiol concentrations.|$|E

40|$|Asparagus is an {{interesting}} vegetable {{as a part of}} a healthy diet and has been widely studied due to the high nutritional value and potential positive effects on human health. Wild asparagus (Asparagus acutifolius L.) grows along the Adriatic coast and islands, while <b>the</b> cultivated <b>asparagus</b> (A. officinalis L.) is mostly grown in the eastern region of Croatia. The aim of this study was to determine total polyphenol content (measured spectrophotometrically) and antioxidant activity (DPPH) in wild and cultivated asparagus. No significant differences in total polyphenol content were found between wild and cultivated <b>asparagus.</b> <b>The</b> highest content of polyphenols in wild asparagus was 6. 20 [mg GAE/g fresh weight] and 49. 60 [mg GAE/g dry weight], and in cultivated asparagus it was 4. 52 [mg GAE/g fresh weight] and 50. 93 [mg GAE/g dry weight]. Antioxidant activity measured using DPPH (2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl) method showed statistically significant difference. Higher antioxidant activity was measured in cultivated than in wild <b>asparagus.</b> <b>The</b> results also indicate that increased polyphenol content leads to higher antioxidant activity, but more so in <b>the</b> cultivated <b>asparagus.</b> Based on <b>the</b> results, <b>the</b> cultivated <b>asparagus</b> is an excellent alternative to wild asparagus that should be protected from over-harvesting, thus preventing devastation of plant diversity of islands and coast...|$|R
