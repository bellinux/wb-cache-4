The natives of southern Brazil and Paraguay spread the pineapple throughout South America, and it eventually reached the Caribbean, Central America, and Mexico, where it was cultivated by the Mayas and the Aztecs. Columbus encountered the pineapple in 1493 on the leeward island of Guadeloupe. He called it piña de Indes, meaning [...] "pine of the Indians", and brought it back with him to Spain, thus making the pineapple the first bromeliad to be introduced by humans outside of the New World. The Spanish introduced it into the Philippines, Hawaii (introduced in the early 19th century, first commercial plantation 1886), Zimbabwe, and Guam. The fruit is said to have been first introduced in Hawaii when a Spanish ship brought it there in the 1500s. The Portuguese took the fruit from Brazil and introduced it into India by 1550.|$|E

40|$|Solanum mauritianum Scop. (bugweed), {{a serious}} exotic weed in South Africa, {{supports}} a depauperate herbivore fauna relative to indigenous Solanum species. These comprise mainly polyphagous, and some oligophagous, species. The greater diversity of insect herbivores on Solanum hermannii Dun., {{relative to other}} indigenous Solanum species in the eastern Cape, suggests that <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> <b>indigenous</b> and not exotic as has been suggested. Five oligophagous species seasonally caused {{a high incidence of}} damage to S. hermannii and other indigenous Solanum species in the eastern Cape, during the study period. Galls of the flowers, stems and leaves of some indigenous Solanum plants are described and biological data on the gall-formers and their natural enemies presented. The tortoise beetle, (Chrysomelidae), defoliates a Conchyloctenia tigrina wide range of indigenous Olivo Solanum species. The exotic S. mauritianum and S. elaeagnifolium Cav. were unfavourable for growth and survival. S. hermannii proved the most favourable of the indigenous hosts tested, for growth and survival, providing further evidence that it is indigenous. Extensive studies on different field populations of the beetle revealed no evidence of host adaptation (host races). All populations tested displayed greater fitness when reared on S. hermannii. South African Solanum faunas are characterized by a scarcity of endophagous and monophagous herbivores, vacant feeding niches and low numbers of species relative to other plant taxa. This may suggest evolutionary immaturity of the insect-plant associations, although comparative studies of solanums {{from other parts of the}} world are needed for confirmation. Alternatively, these characteristics may simply be a feature of the genus Solanum in general. The depauperate herbivore fauna of S. mauritianum reflects a lack of local herbivores suitably preadapted to overcome its defences. This appears to be accentuated by absence of any close relatives of bugweed in South Africa. The greater diversity of herbivores in its native South America suggests that biological control may be a potentially useful means of control for bugweed. The potential for biological control is, however, threatened by the susceptability of the cultivated eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) to attack by Solanum-feeding insects.

40|$|L. scoparium {{is one of}} New Zealand's most {{important}} weeds of unploughable infertile hill country. <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> an <b>indigenous</b> shrub, characteristic of {{the early stages of}} succession to forest {{in a wide range of}} habitats (Cockayne, 1928). In the eight years prior to 1959 / 60 nearly 40, 000 acres of unimproved grassland reverted to scrub, fern and second growth each year. L. scoparium is one of the {{most important}} components of the scrub, fern and second growth category. By 1959 / 60 the total area of reverted land in New Zealand was 5. 7 million acres of which 3. 65 million were in the North Island. (Rigg, 1962). Control of L. scoparium on unploughable hill country has been limited to pulling, cutting, or cutting and burning, depending on stage of growth. Chemical methods and standing burns have generally proved unsuccessful. Most methods are expensive. Levy (1932, 1940, 1946) postulated that establishment of L. scoparium in pasture could be prevented by good farming techniques. Today there is a growing body of practical evidence to support this hypothesis (Suckling, 1959; New Zealand Farmer 83 (42, 43, 45)). This study was carried out to determine what intrinsic factors favour the establishment of L. scoparium, and the quantitative effect of farm management techniques on this process...|$|R
50|$|While some {{consider}} <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> to <b>be</b> a weed, {{its roots}} are food for bears, who eat it after hibernating as a laxative or cathartic. <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> used by <b>indigenous</b> people as medicine for burns and injuries, and for food {{in times of}} famine, when almost all parts were eaten.

30|$|Like many {{countries}} in the global South, Kenya experienced a wave of interest in jatropha as a fuel source {{in the first decade}} of the twenty-first century—but <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> has a much longer history in the region. <b>The</b> jatropha <b>plant</b> <b>is</b> <b>indigenous</b> to Latin America and was probably introduced to Africa by Portuguese traders before 1810 (Heller 1996). The oil from jatropha seeds has historically been used for soap making and street lighting, while other parts of <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> have <b>been</b> used medicinally as well as to make inks, dyes and pesticides (Heller 1996; Orwa et al. 2009). Recently, interest in jatropha as an energy source has taken hold in parts of Africa, Asia and Latin America. While some common patterns have emerged, including lower than anticipated long-term job creation, disappointing incomes for small-scale growers and widespread project failure (Romijn et al. 2014), the Kenyan experience may be unique in two respects. First, unlike in India, where a national biodiesel policy encouraged private sector investment and widespread jatropha cultivation (Baka 2014; Ariza-Montobbio et al. 2010), in Kenya NGOs were the primary drivers of early jatropha activities—even helping to draft a biofuel policy document. Second, unlike in Zambia (German et al. 2011 a), Madagascar (Neimark 2016), Ghana (Schoneveld et al. 2011), Tanzania (Romijn et al. 2014) and Mozambique (Nicotra 2015), Kenya did not experience major controversies over large-scale plantations until a wide range of projects aimed at small-scale farmers were already underway. This affected the discourses at play in the early stages of jatropha development, with more emphasis on ‘pro-poor’ goals relative to ambitions over national economic development, import substitution and trade.|$|R

A number of historically sewage-amended sites (including experimental, pasture grassland and arable sites) were selected and compared with highly contaminated samples from abandoned heavy metal mines. Many sites had metal concentrations above the limits established by the UK Government, based on those developed by the European Commission (EC) for sludge-amended soils. Acetylene reduction activity (ARA) was used to screen the samples for effective N 2 fixation. When <b>the</b> host <b>plant</b> <b>was</b> <b>indigenous</b> to <b>the</b> sward, rhizobia were found in the nodules and in the soil rhizosphere at all the sites tested.

However, nodulation failed to occur in some cases where T. repens <b>was</b> not <b>indigenous</b> to metal-contaminated soils. This indicated either that an ineffective rhizobial population was present, or that effective cells were absent from the soil. The influence of individual metals on ARA could not be determined conclusively because of the confounding effects of soil physicochemical variability and the presence of different metals at high concentrations together in the soil. However, Cd concentrations appeared to be particularly important in determining the presence of effective ARA in soils with no indigenous clover. In contrast to previous studies, the results presented here suggest that heavy metals may have had a quantitative effect on the free-living population of rhizobia, rather than a genetic effect...|$|R
