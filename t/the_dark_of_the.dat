2500|$|In Odisha, {{the festival}} is known as Deepavali (Odia: ଦୀପାବଳୀ). The festival day starts with drawing rangolis {{in front of the}} house. The rangoli is drawn in the shape of {{sailboat}} on {{the ground in front of}} the house and is filled with items such as cotton, salt, mustard, asparagus root, turmeric and a wild creeper. Prasad is placed in the central chamber, over which a deepa of a jute stem with cloth wick is lit. This marks the beginning of Puja. Tarpanam – the ritual meant to invoke the spirits of the ancestors. Immediately after the dusk, all members of household gather for lighting Kaunria (pith of the jute plant). A lighted lamp is placed inside an earthen pot that is tied to a pole erected in front of the house. All the members then hold a bunch of jute stick in their hands and light them from the fire from the main deepa and raise the bunch towards the sky chanting the following verse. Then, in the presence of every member of the house, a bundle of the Kaunria is lit during the Puja and raised skywards accompanied with the chant: [...] "Badbadua ho andhaara re aasa aalua re jaa" [...] meaning [...] "O' forefathers come in <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evening, we light your way to the heaven". The significance of the ritual is that we show respect to our ancestors who reinforce their absence from the physical world by our presence.|$|E

2500|$|... "It's {{no secret}} that in music, as in life, success and failure are largely {{dependent}} on timing, and so {{with that in mind}} it's hard not to feel just a little bad for Michelle Williams, the Johnny-come-lately third member of Destiny's Child, who has always had a hard time establishing herself inside the group, let alone outside it, and who now finds herself releasing a new record at a time when her efforts will likely be eclipsed by her former group members. And so, after a series of delays, Williams's third solo album, Unexpected, arrives on shelves just as people have begun to buzz about Beyoncé's upcoming album, and when honorary DC sister Solange has made an unexpected critical impact with the oddball surrealism of her recent sophomore effort, Sol-Angel and the Hadley Street Dreams. Considering Unexpected is a fairly decent album and by far the least pretentious, unashamedly pop record to be made by a DC member so far, it's all a bit unfortunate. Anyone who has heard the first single, [...] "We Break the Dawn," [...] already knows that Williams, whose solo work to date has been gospel-oriented, has on this occasion stepped outside of the confines of the church and into <b>the</b> <b>dark</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> clubs, embracing au courant euro-pop sounds, and it's a move that works well for her. [...] "We Break the Dawn," [...] which boasts a chorus wrapped up in some awesome swirling synth-pop majestics, has done relatively well on the dance charts but deserved to cross over. Meanwhile, ignoring some atrocious lyrical hiccups, [...] "Til' the End of the World" [...] is a moody, frostbitten electro lament, and in the lush balladry of [...] "The Greatest," [...] Williams could find the hit she needs." ...|$|E
