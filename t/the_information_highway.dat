The networking idea became politicized during the 1992 Clinton-Gore election campaign, where the rhetoric of <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>highway</b> captured the public imagination. On taking office in 1993, the new administration set in place a range of government initiatives for a National Information Infrastructure aimed at ensuring that all American citizens ultimately {{gain access to the}} new networks.|$|E

The system is designed {{so that all the}} data about the surrounding threat comes in one place, along with analysis about the kind of threat. The system also advises the commanding officer about the kind of weaponry he should use to tackle the threat. Obviously, all this happens in real-time. The Ship is equipped with sophisticated digital networks, such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode based Integrated Ship Data Network (AISDN), Combat [...] Management System (CMS), Automatic Power Management System (APMS) and Auxiliary Control System (ACS). The AISDN is <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>highway</b> on which data from all the sensors and weapon ride. The CMS is used to integrate information from other platforms using indigenous data-link system, to provide Maritime Domain Awareness. The intricate power supply management is done using APMS, and remote control and monitoring of machinery is achieved through the ACS.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} studies which were {{undertaken}} jointly by Telesat and Industry Canada {{to provide an}} estimate of the market opportunities for residential multi-media services in the rural and small urban areas of Canada. This study is part of the Advanced Satcom program, a Ka-band satellite system proposal which is currently in the implementation proposal phase by the government and the Canadian space industry of which Telesat is an active member. Advanced Satcom extends the reach of terrestrial <b>information</b> <b>highways</b> to <b>the</b> remote and sparsely populated parts of the country in a cost-effective manner and thus provides a ubiquitous coverage of <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>highways</b> to all Canadians. Therefore, the rural and small urban markets are believed to be good opportunities for the Advanced Satcom. Although the results are primarily intended for fixed residential applications, they can also be used as input to market opportunity studies for wideband mobile applications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{enormous}} amount of <b>information</b> stored on <b>the</b> web increases {{from one day to}} the next, exposing the web currently faced with the inevitable difficulties of research pertinent information that users really want. The problem today is not limited to expanding the size of <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>highways,</b> but to design a system for intelligent search. The vast majority of this information is stored in relational databases, which in turn represent a backend for managing RDF data of the semantic web. This problem has motivated us to write this paper in order to establish an effective approach to support semantic transformation algorithm for SPARQL queries to SQL queries, more precisely SPARQL SELECT queries; by adopting this method, the relational database can be questioned easily with SPARQL queries maintaining the same performance...|$|R

40|$|Leeds-based artist Lisa Stansbie’s digital art is {{made through}} a process of browsing: {{meandering}} through information, following and forming connections between ideas. Capitalising on the Internet’s potential for absurdity, Stansbie wades through its unedited glut of information, following connective threads that defy logic to create works which tease meaning out of meaninglessness. Often centred around the theme of a journey, her films are narratives braided together from the data generated by search engines like Google. Mapping paths which intersect with <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>highways,</b> Stansbie finds poetry in unexpected associations. In Hackamore, showing on Window Online, Stansbie’s films explore the fragmentary nature of narrative. Dislocated data takes on surreal, dream-like qualities as the familiar and the alien form an unexpected alliance. Like the hackamore, a traditional form of bitless horse bridle formed by braiding rope and rawhide, Stansbie’s work allows for negotiation, a to-and-fro between rider and steed.
