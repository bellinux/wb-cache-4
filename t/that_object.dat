5|$|A {{previous}} {{analysis by}} Carlos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos of commensurabilities among the known ETNOs using Monte Carlo techniques revealed a pattern {{similar to that}} of the Kuiper belt, where accidental commensurabilities occur due to objects in resonances with Neptune. They find that this pattern would be best explained if the ETNOs were in resonance with an additional planetary-sized object beyond Pluto and note that a number of these objects may be in 5:3 and 3:1 resonances if <b>that</b> <b>object</b> had semi-major axis of â‰ˆ700 AU.|$|E
5|$|The {{classical}} formulae for {{the energy}} and momentum of electromagnetic radiation can be re-expressed in terms of photon events. For example, the pressure of electromagnetic radiation on an object derives from the transfer of photon momentum per unit time and unit area to <b>that</b> <b>object,</b> since pressure is force per unit area and force is the change in momentum per unit time.|$|E
50|$|It is {{specifically}} {{mentioned in the}} fifth episode (Weird Sisters) <b>that</b> <b>objects</b> {{do not have any}} magical ability. They just assist the bearer. This does not mean <b>that</b> <b>objects</b> cannot have spells cast on them. For example, the stone from Warwe and Mineer has magic on it.|$|R
50|$|Here is an example: 100 infants {{are shown}} an <b>object</b> <b>that</b> appears to teleport, violating the rule <b>that</b> <b>objects</b> move in {{continuous}} paths. Another 100 similar infants are shown an <b>object</b> <b>that</b> behaves in a nearly identical manner {{to the object}} from group 1, except <b>that</b> this <b>object</b> does not teleport. If this stimulus induces longer looking times than similar stimuli that do not involve teleportation, then, so the argument goes, infants expect <b>that</b> <b>objects</b> obey the continuity rule, and are surprised when they violate this rule. Some researchers have suggested, of some such experiments, that infants have innate knowledge of those rules the violation of which they can perceptually discriminate.|$|R

5|$|The {{discovery}} of Sedna with its peculiar orbit in 2004 {{led to the}} conclusion that something beyond the known eight planets had perturbed Sedna away from the Kuiper belt. <b>That</b> <b>object</b> could have been an unknown planet on a distant orbit, a random star that passed near the Solar System, or a member of the Sun's birth cluster. The announcement in March 2014 of the {{discovery of}} a second sednoid, , which shared some orbital characteristics with Sedna and other extreme trans-Neptunian objects, further raised the possibility of an unseen super-Earth in a large orbit.|$|E
5|$|Clock Tower is a point-and-click {{adventure}} {{game with}} 3D graphics. The player may use a PlayStation controller or mouse {{to move the}} cursor on the screen. The cursor will change shape when placed over certain objects, which the player can click to interact with. Clicking in any location will guide the player character in that direction. Moving the cursor {{to the top of}} the screen will reveal the player's inventory. Clicking an item and then clicking an object on the screen will use the item on <b>that</b> <b>object</b> or in that location. Some items such as keys are used automatically when clicked.|$|E
5|$|If a {{body has}} more or fewer {{electrons}} than {{are required to}} balance the positive charge of the nuclei, then <b>that</b> <b>object</b> has a net electric charge. When there is an excess of electrons, the object {{is said to be}} negatively charged. When there are fewer electrons than the number of protons in nuclei, the object is said to be positively charged. When the number of electrons and the number of protons are equal, their charges cancel each other and the object is said to be electrically neutral. A macroscopic body can develop an electric charge through rubbing, by the triboelectric effect.|$|E

50|$|The {{first stage}} is the mark stage which does a tree {{traversal}} {{of the entire}} 'root set' and marks each <b>object</b> <b>that</b> is pointed to by a root as being 'in-use'. All <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> those <b>objects</b> point to, and so on, are marked as well, so <b>that</b> every <b>object</b> <b>that</b> is reachable via the root set is marked.|$|R
5|$|Observational {{astronomy}} uses lensing {{effects as}} an important tool to infer properties of the lensing object. Even in cases where <b>that</b> <b>object</b> is not directly visible, {{the shape of a}} lensed image provides information about the mass distribution responsible for the light deflection. In particular, gravitational lensing provides one way to measure the distribution of dark matter, which does not give off light and can be observed only by its gravitational effects. One particularly interesting application are large-scale observations, where the lensing masses are spread out over a significant fraction of the observable universe, and can be used to obtain information about the large-scale properties and evolution of our cosmos.|$|E
5|$|Not all early roguelikes were readily {{classified}} as Hack or Moria descendants. Larn (1986), developed by Noah Morgan, borrowed concepts from both Hack (in {{that there are}} persistent and fixed levels) and Moria (in {{the availability of a}} shop level and general difficulty increasing with dungeon level), but while these two games have spiraled in size to take multiple play sessions to complete, Larn was aimed to be completed in a single session. Larn also uses a fixed-time feature, in that the player had only so many turns to complete a goal, though there were ways to jump back in time as to extend play. Omega, developed by the Laurence Brothers in the late 1980s, is credited with introducing an overworld concept to the roguelike genre, prior to the feature's appearance in ADOM. Omega was often remembered for its odd inventory approach in which the player would have to pick up an object, considering it being held, and then moving <b>that</b> <b>object</b> to a bag or an equipment slot. Linley's Dungeon Crawl (1995) was created by Linley Henzell and featured a skill-based character progression system, in which experience points could be used to improve specific skills, such as weapon proficiency or trap detection. One fork of this would form the basis for Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (2006). SSI's Dungeon Hack (1993) offered randomized dungeons and permadeath within AD 2nd Edition rules.|$|E

25|$|Functions as methods: Unlike many {{object-oriented}} languages, {{there is}} no distinction between a function definition and a method definition. Rather, the distinction occurs during function calling; when a function is called {{as a method of}} an object, the function's local this keyword is bound to <b>that</b> <b>object</b> for that invocation.|$|E
25|$|Each {{object is}} {{identified}} by a SHA-1 hash of its contents. Git computes the hash, and uses this {{value for the}} object's name.

25|$|A newly {{allocated}} object {{created with}} alloc or copy has a retain count of one. Sending <b>that</b> <b>object</b> a retain message increments the retain count, while sending it a release message decrements the retain count.

50|$|In {{object-oriented}} programming, association {{defines a}} relationship between classes of <b>objects</b> <b>that</b> allows one <b>object</b> instance to cause another to perform an action on its behalf. This relationship is structural, because it specifies <b>that</b> <b>objects</b> of one kind are connected to objects of another and does not represent behaviour.|$|R
5000|$|Mereological {{nihilism}} (also called compositional nihilism, or rarely simply nihilism) is the mereological position <b>that</b> <b>objects</b> {{with proper}} parts do not exist. Only mereological simples, those basic building blocks without proper parts, exist. Or, more succinctly, [...] "nothing is a proper part of anything". Mereological simples {{can be both}} spatial and temporal. Mereological nihilism also asserts <b>that</b> <b>objects</b> existing in time {{do not have any}} temporal parts.|$|R
25|$|Because of OpenGL's {{use of a}} state system, objects must be mutable. That is, {{the basic}} {{structure}} of an object can change at any time, even if the rendering pipeline is asynchronously using <b>that</b> <b>object.</b> A texture object can be redefined from 2D to 3D. This requires any OpenGL implementations to add a degree of complexity to internal object management.|$|E
25|$|Simmel {{believed}} people created {{value by}} making objects, then separating themselves from <b>that</b> <b>object</b> and {{then trying to}} overcome that distance. He found that things which were too close were not considered valuable and things which were too far for people to get were also not considered valuable. Considered in determining value was the scarcity, time, sacrifice, and difficulties involved in getting the object.|$|E
25|$|To give {{compiler}} vendors greater freedom, the C++ {{standards committee}} {{decided not to}} dictate the implementation of name mangling, exception handling, and other implementation-specific features.

50|$|Singularism asserts <b>that</b> <b>objects</b> of {{interpretation}} always answer {{to one and}} only one ideal interpretation. In contrast, multiplism asserts <b>that</b> <b>objects</b> {{of interpretation}} may answer {{to more than one}} opposed interpretation. Both singularism and multiplism require that competing interpretations address one and the same object of interpretation. Where different interpretations address different objects of interpretation, an innocuous pluralism occurs. Where objects of interpretation cannot be delineated as to number, neither singularism nor multiplism can apply.|$|R
