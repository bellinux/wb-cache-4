25|$|As {{early as}} 1972 Genie scored between the level an 8-year-old and an adult on all right-hemisphere tasks the {{scientists}} tested her on, and showed extraordinarily rapid improvement on them. Her ability {{to piece together}} objects solely from tactile information was exceptionally good, and on spatial awareness tests her scores were reportedly the highest ever recorded. Similarly, on a Mooney Face Test in May 1975 she had {{the highest score in}} medical literature at that time, and on a separate gestalt perception test her extrapolated score was in the 95th percentile for adults. On several other tests involving right-hemisphere tasks, her results were markedly better <b>than</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> in equivalent phases of mental development; in 1977 the scientists measured her capacity for stereognosis at approximately the level of a typical 10-year-old, significantly higher than her estimated mental age. The scientists also noted in 1974 that Genie seemed to be able to recognize the location she was in and was good at getting from one place to another, an ability which primarily involves the right hemisphere.|$|E

[...] His group's findings were part of a broader study that tracked 16,303 people who worked at the Rocky Flats plant between 1952 and 1989.

He synchronised the clocks in his apartment and regularly sent cards to himself to test how well the postal service was working. Elizabeth Wilson's Shostakovich: A Life Remembered (1994 edition) indexes 26 references to his nervousness. Mikhail Druskin remembers that even as a young man the composer was [...] "fragile and nervously agile". [...] Yuri Lyubimov comments, [...] "The fact that he was more vulnerable and receptive <b>than</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> was no doubt an important feature of his genius."

500|$|Tyndall was antisemitic. From earlier fascists like Chesterton, he had {{inherited}} {{a belief that}} there was a global conspiracy of Jews bent on world domination, opining that the Protocols of the Elders of Zion was genuine evidence for this. He believed that Jews were responsible for both communism and international finance capitalism, using both to their own ends, and that they were responsible for undermining the British Empire and the British race. Tyndall also believed that both democratic government and immigration into Europe were parts of a Jewish conspiracy to weaken other races. He had expressed the view that [...] "if Britain were to become Jew-clean she would have no nigger neighbours to worry about... It is the Jews who are our misfortune: T-h-e J-e-w-s. Do you hear me? THE JEWS?" [...] Another of his comments, made in 1963, was that [...] "Jewry is a world pest wherever it is found in the world today. The Jews are more clever and more financially powerful <b>than</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> and have to be eradicated before they destroy the Aryan peoples".|$|E
500|$|While traveling, Applewhite and Nettles {{pondered the}} life of St.Francis of Assisi and read works by authors {{including}} Helena Blavatsky, R.D. Laing, and Richard Bach. They kept a King James Version of the Bible with them and studied several passages from the New Testament, focusing on teachings about Christology, asceticism, and eschatology. Applewhite also read science fiction, including works by Robert A.Heinlein and Arthur C.Clarke. By June 1974, Applewhite and Nettles' beliefs had solidified into a basic outline. They concluded {{that they had been}} chosen to fulfill biblical prophecies, and that they had been given higher-level minds <b>than</b> <b>other</b> <b>people.</b> They wrote a pamphlet that described Jesus' reincarnation as a Texan, a thinly veiled reference to Applewhite. Furthermore, they concluded that they were the two witnesses described in the Book of Revelation and occasionally visited churches or other spiritual groups to speak of their identities, often referring to themselves as [...] "The Two", or [...] "The UFO Two". They believed that they would be killed and then restored to life and, in view of others, transported onto a spaceship. This event, which they referred to as [...] "the Demonstration", was to prove their claims. To their dismay, these ideas were poorly received.|$|E

She was rushed to the hospital, creating the turn of events that led to much of the material in her novel and screenplay, Postcards from the Edge.

2500|$|Acquired {{situational}} narcissism (ASN) {{is a form}} of narcissism {{that develops}} in late adolescence or adulthood, brought on by wealth, fame and the other trappings of celebrity. It was coined by Robert B. Millman, {{professor of psychiatry at the}} Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University. ASN differs from conventional narcissism in that it develops after childhood and is triggered and supported by the celebrity-obsessed society. [...] Fans, assistants and tabloid media all play into the idea that the person really is vastly more important <b>than</b> <b>other</b> <b>people,</b> triggering a narcissistic problem that might have been only a tendency, or latent, and helping it to become a full-blown personality disorder. [...] "Millman says that what happens to celebrities is that they get so used to people looking at them that they stop looking back at other people." [...] In its presentation and symptoms, it is indistinguishable from narcissistic personality disorder, differing only in its late onset and its support by large numbers of others. [...] "The lack of social norms, controls, and of people telling them how life really is, also makes these people believe they're invulnerable," [...] so that the person with ASN may suffer from unstable relationships, substance abuse and erratic behaviour. A famous fictional character with ASN is Norma Desmond, the main character of Sunset Boulevard.|$|E
