6000|$|... "Come, there's life in you yet!" [...] said Dan as he {{assisted}} {{the old man}} into the wheel-chair. [...] "Put your hands--so. And when you want <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round</b> you've only to pull {{with one hand and}} push with--" ...|$|E
60|$|After this, {{you will}} perhaps be {{surprised}} to hear that although Gawaine was at home, the hand of the dial in the courtyard had scarcely cleared the last stroke of three when Arthur returned through the entrance-gates, got down from the panting Rattler, and went into the house to take a hasty luncheon. But I believe there have been men since his day who have ridden a long way to avoid a rencontre, and then galloped hastily back lest they should miss it. It is the favourite stratagem of our passions to sham a retreat, and <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round</b> upon us at the moment we have made up our minds that the day is our own.|$|E
6000|$|... [Edinburgh,] July 6.--Returned {{last night}} with my frozen Muscovites to the Capital, and {{suffered}} as usual from the incursions of the black horse during the night. It was absolute fever. A bunch of letters, but little interesting. Mr. Barry Cornwall[293] writes to condole with me. I think our acquaintance scarce warranted this; but it is well meant and modestly done. I cannot conceive the idea of forcing myself on strangers in distress, and I have half a mind <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round</b> on some of my consolers. Came home from Court. R.P. Gillies called; he is writing a satire. He has a singular talent of aping the measure and tone of Byron, and this poem goes {{to the tune of}} Don Juan, but it is the Champagne after it has stood two days with the cork drawn. Thereafter came Charles K. Sharpe and Will Clerk, as Robinson sayeth, to my exceeding refreshment.[294] And last, not least, Mr. Jollie, one of the triumvirs who manage my poor matters. He consents to going on with the small edition of novels, which he did not before comprehend. All this has consumed the day, but we will make up tide-way presently. I must dress to go to Lord Medwyn[295] to dinner, and it is near time.|$|E
60|$|But {{to prevent}} such triumph {{on the part of}} the enemy Joshua Thoroughbung was {{prepared}} to sacrifice himself. He rode right at the whip, with his own whip raised, and would undoubtedly have ridden over him had not the whip tried <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> his horse <b>sharp</b> <b>round,</b> stumbled and fallen in the struggle, and had not Thoroughbung, with his horse, fallen over him.|$|R
60|$|Mingling {{with the}} crowd, John and his {{followers}} made {{their way through the}} Damascus Gate into Jerusalem, and followed the Damascus Street to the Gate of Ephraim. An air of sombre misery pervaded the whole population. In their hearts the greater portion of the population had, for many months, been longing for the approach of the Romans. Even death would be preferable to the misery which they suffered. There were but few people in the streets; for all remained in their houses, with closed doors, save when necessity drove them out <b>to</b> make purchases. <b>Turning</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round</b> by the wall, the members of the band made their way along by it, until they were met by one or other of those who had gone on in advance, and were conducted to the house which had been hired for them.|$|R
60|$|This {{seemed to}} be the consummation of the barber's hopes, for he <b>turned</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round,</b> and {{actually}} ran away.|$|R
60|$|The result was, {{that with}} one short wild cry of renewed horror, Bumpus and Corrie <b>turned</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round</b> and fled in the {{opposite}} direction.|$|R
6000|$|... "`It may be so, Jemimar,' says I,--Did you speak, sir?" [...] {{said the}} coachman, <b>turning</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round</b> on hearing Will utter an exclamation of surprise.|$|R
60|$|As {{you pass}} up the avenue you <b>turn</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round</b> {{the corner of the}} court house, and on a steep hill before you you see a mediæval castle.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is this so?" [...] {{said the}} king, <b>turning</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round</b> on the twins. [...] "Are ye minded to quit freebooting, and come a crusading against the Turks with me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yambo looked awful blank at this. Then he <b>turned</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round</b> {{and looked}} at me for all the world as if he meant to say `wot d'ee mean by that? eh!' ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{lips and}} eyelids quivered; {{she opened her}} eyes full on his for an instant, like a lovely wild animal timid and {{struggling}} under caresses, and then <b>turned</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round</b> toward home again.|$|R
60|$|Ziffa {{ran like}} a hunted deer, so anxious was she for the {{deliverance}} of her Bible instructor. On <b>turning</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round</b> {{a bend in}} the track, she plunged into the bosom of Ebony.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. But don't {{go for a}} bull, and don't go {{too close}} for fear he <b>turns</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round</b> an' catches you on his horns. You know the bulls are apt to do that sometimes." ...|$|R
60|$|Karlsefin's canoe led the way; hence, on <b>turning</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round</b> a {{point of}} rock that jutted out into the stream, Krake was the first who {{caught sight of the}} smoke that rose above the tree-tops.|$|R
60|$|In a {{short time}} the boat was <b>turned</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round</b> by Baldwin, and run into a cove near a wall in which was a little wooden gate. A flight of {{dilapidated}} steps led to this gate.|$|R
60|$|A {{glance over}} a rising ground sufficed {{to make the}} boy <b>turn</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round</b> and take <b>to</b> his heels. He was remarkably swift of foot. A few minutes {{brought him to the}} cottage door, which he burst open.|$|R
6000|$|A month later, he <b>turned</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round,</b> ere half {{a morning}} walk was completed, and stumped {{back to the}} house. [...] "Put me to bed, Rosa," [...] he muttered. [...] "I've walked my last. The wadding has found me out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{were making}} {{straight}} for my father's camp," [...] continued the lad, bending a stern {{look on the}} trail, [...] "but they <b>turned</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round,</b> like the swallow, on coming to {{the trail of the}} white man Brixton, and followed it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Her visitor <b>turned</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round.</b> [...] "You can?" [...] There was a {{light in}} his strong stare. [...] "You can {{understand}} it's spoiling her temper and making her come down on me? She behaves as if I were of no use to her at all!" ...|$|R
60|$|Mr Auberly <b>turned</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round</b> on Willie, whose gaze {{had gone}} beyond {{the length of}} simple curiosity. In fact, he was awe-struck {{at the sight of}} such a very tall and very dignified man {{standing}} so grimly in the midst of such dreadful devastation.|$|R
6000|$|... 'By your leave, Mr Knag,' {{retorted}} the charwoman, <b>turning</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round.</b> 'I'm {{only too}} glad {{not to speak}} in this house, excepting when and where I'm spoke to, sir; and with regard to being a female, sir, I should wish {{to know what you}} considered yourself?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} that I cry up Brooke on any {{personal}} ground?" [...] said Will Ladislaw, nettled, and <b>turning</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round.</b> For {{the first time he}} felt offended with Lydgate; not the less so, perhaps, because he would have declined any close inquiry into the growth of his relation to Mr. Brooke.|$|R
60|$|Not {{until the}} bear had passed slowly {{out of sight}} behind the {{intervening}} bushes was he disenchanted. Then, indeed, he leaped up like a startled deer, <b>turned</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round,</b> and bounded back {{the way he had}} come, with as much caution and as little noise as was compatible with such vigorous action.|$|R
60|$|Petroff {{admitted}} with ready {{grace that}} I was right, and thrusting {{his fingers through}} the wild clustering curls of his black hair, as if to let the air circle more freely about his head, he <b>turned</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round,</b> and pointed <b>to</b> a cottage which stood at {{a short distance from}} the high-road, {{at the entrance to the}} village.|$|R
60|$|Just {{then the}} ostrich, which had marched {{ahead of the}} party, <b>turned</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round</b> and charged. Poor Squib tripped, by good luck, and fell as the bird passed over him. It kicked down the other two, and sprang on the {{shoulders}} of the stooping Hobson, who fell and gashed his finger as the bird tumbled over him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us {{strike out}} {{straight}} for the horizon now," [...] said Harry, after they had galloped half {{a mile or so}} along the beaten track. [...] "See, here are the tracks of our friends." [...] <b>Turning</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round</b> as he spoke, he leaped his pony over the heap that lined the road, and galloped away through the soft snow.|$|R
6000|$|Descending the cliffs, {{he gained}} the road, and was walking along towards the {{selected}} spot, when {{the sound of}} wheels arrested him. Looking up, he saw the waggonette <b>turn</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round</b> the projecting cliff, and approach him at a walk. He experienced a little depression of spirit, for {{there was no one}} in it, only the groom on the box. Milly would be sorely disappointed! ...|$|R
60|$|This was {{all done}} in a minute's space. In the very instant when Oliver began to run, the old gentleman, putting {{his hand to his}} pocket, and missing his handkerchief, <b>turned</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round.</b> Seeing the boy {{scudding}} away at such a rapid pace, he very naturally concluded him to be the depredator; and shouting 'Stop thief!' with all his might, made off after him, book in hand.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Tom Roker, {{the gentleman}} who had {{accompanied}} Mr. Pickwick into the prison, <b>turned</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round</b> <b>to</b> the right {{when he got to}} the bottom of the little flight of steps, and led the way, through an iron gate which stood open, and up another short flight of steps, into a long narrow gallery, dirty and low, paved with stone, and very dimly lighted by a window at each remote end.|$|R
60|$|It had not escaped Sam's {{attention}} that, {{when this}} person dismounted, a shabby-looking {{man in a}} brown greatcoat shorn of divers buttons, who had been previously slinking about, {{on the opposite side}} of the way, crossed over, and remained stationary close by. Having something more than a suspicion of the object of the gentleman's visit, Sam preceded him to the George and Vulture, and, <b>turning</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round,</b> planted himself in the Centre of the doorway.|$|R
6000|$|Then it {{was decided}} that Mr Beauclerk should speak a word to Lord Alfred. The rich man and the poor man were cousins, and had always been intimate. 'Alfred,' said the chosen mentor at the club one afternoon, 'I wonder whether you couldn't say {{something}} to Melmotte about his manner.' Lord Alfred <b>turned</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round</b> and looked into his companion's face. 'They tell me he is giving offence. Of course he doesn't mean it. Couldn't he draw it a little milder?' ...|$|R
6000|$|On {{which the}} little man <b>turned</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round,</b> walked {{straight}} up to Gluck, and drew himself up to his full height. [...] "I," [...] said {{the little man}}, [...] "am the King of the Golden River." [...] Whereupon he turned about again and took two more turns, some six feet long, {{in order to allow}} time for the consternation which this announcement produced in his auditor to evaporate. After which he again walked up to Gluck and stood still, as if expecting some comment on his communication.|$|R
6000|$|Captain Ogilvy {{returned}} by {{much the same}} route to his sister's cottage, but {{did not attempt to}} conceal his movements. On the contrary, knowing that the sloop must have got clear of the harbour by that time, he went along the streets whistling cheerfully. He had been a noted, not to say noisy, whistler when a boy, and the habit had not forsaken him in his old age. On <b>turning</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round</b> a corner, he ran against two men, one of whom swore at him, but the other cried-- ...|$|R
60|$|Leaving the chapel, {{descending}} to {{the passage}} so frequently alluded to, and crossing the yard before noticed as being allotted to prisoners of a more respectable description than the generality of men confined here, the visitor arrives at a thick iron gate of great size and strength. Having been admitted through it by the turnkey on duty, he <b>turns</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round</b> <b>to</b> the left, and pauses before another gate; and, having passed this last barrier, {{he stands in the}} most terrible part of this gloomy building—the condemned ward.|$|R
6000|$|At {{the moment}} when the {{rencontre}} occurred he chanced to be wandering in spirit among the groves of Pirate Island. On <b>turning</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>round</b> a bend in the track, he found himself {{face to face with the}} tiger, which crouched instantly for a spring. As we have said, the sportsman was instantly petrified. He could not believe his eyes! He must have believed something, however, else he would not have gazed with such dreadful intensity. Yes, there, a few feet before him, crouched the tenant of the menagerie, without the cage--the creature of picture story-books endued with life! ...|$|R
