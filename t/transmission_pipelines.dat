25|$|With {{the main}} {{constraint}} on Canadian oil sands development becoming {{the availability of}} export pipeline capacity, pipeline companies have proposed {{a number of major}} new <b>transmission</b> <b>pipelines.</b> Many of these became stalled in government regulatory processes, both by the Canadian and American governments.

25|$|The {{movement}} {{of crude oil}} by rail is far from new, but {{it is now a}} rapidly growing market for North American railroads. The growth is driven by several factors. One is that the <b>transmission</b> <b>pipelines</b> from Alberta are operating at or near capacity and companies who cannot get pipeline space have to move oil by rail instead. Another is that many refineries on the east, west, and Gulf coasts of North America are under-served by pipelines since they assumed that they would obtain their oil by ocean tanker. Producers of new oil in Alberta, North Dakota, and West Texas are now shipping oil by rail to coastal refiners who are having difficulty obtaining international oil at prices competitive with those in the interior of North America. In addition, crude bitumen can be loaded directly into tank cars equipped with steam heating coils, avoiding the need for blending it with expensive condensate in order to ship it to market. Tank cars can also be built to transport condensate on the back-haul from refineries to the oil sands to make additional revenue rather than returning empty.|$|E
