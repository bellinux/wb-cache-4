5|$|Immunology {{made a great}} advance {{towards the}} end of the 19th century, through rapid developments, in the study of humoral {{immunity}} and cellular immunity. Particularly important was the work of Paul Ehrlich, who proposed the side-chain theory to explain <b>the</b> <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> the antigen-antibody reaction; his contributions to the understanding of humoral immunity were recognized by the award of a Nobel Prize in 1908, which was jointly awarded to the founder of cellular immunology, Elie Metchnikoff.|$|E
5|$|The {{dominant}} {{producers of}} iodine today are Chile and Japan. Iodine {{and its compounds}} are primarily used in nutrition. Due to its high atomic number and ease of attachment to organic compounds, it has also found favour as a non-toxic radiocontrast material. Because of <b>the</b> <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> its uptake by the human body, radioactive isotopes of iodine {{can also be used}} to treat thyroid cancer. Iodine is also used as a catalyst in the industrial production of acetic acid and some polymers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the {{psychiatrist}} Kurt Schneider listed {{the forms of}} psychotic symptoms that he thought distinguished schizophrenia from other psychotic disorders. These are called first-rank symptoms or Schneider's first-rank symptoms. They include delusions of being controlled by an external force, the belief that thoughts are being inserted into or withdrawn from one's conscious mind, the belief that one's thoughts are being broadcast to other people, and hearing hallucinatory voices that comment on one's thoughts or actions or that {{have a conversation with}} other hallucinated voices. Although they have significantly contributed to the current diagnostic criteria, <b>the</b> <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> first-rank symptoms has been questioned. A review of the diagnostic studies conducted between 1970 and 2005 found that they allow neither a reconfirmation nor a rejection of Schneider's claims, and suggested that first-rank symptoms should be de-emphasized in future revisions of diagnostic systems. The absence of first-rank symptoms should raise suspicion of a medical disorder, however.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> RSTs for the {{presence}} of GAS is at least 95%, with some studies finding close to 100% specificity. Therefore, if the test result is positive, {{the presence}} of GAS is highly likely. However, 5% to 20% of individuals carry GAS in their throats without symptomatic infection, so the presence of GAS in an individual with pharyngitis does not prove that this organism is responsible for the infection. The sensitivity of lateral flow RSTs is somewhat lower at 65% to 80%. Therefore, a negative result from such a test cannot be used to rule out GAS pharyngitis, a considerable disadvantage compared with microbial culture, which has a sensitivity of 90% to 95%. However, newer optical immunoassay RSTs have been found to have a much higher sensitivity of 94%.|$|E
5|$|Two {{chains of}} DNA twist {{around each other}} to form a DNA double helix with the phosphate-sugar {{backbone}} spiralling around the outside, and the bases pointing inwards with adenine base pairing to thymine and guanine to cytosine. <b>The</b> <b>specificity</b> <b>of</b> base pairing occurs because adenine and thymine align to form two hydrogen bonds, whereas cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds. The two strands in a double helix must therefore be complementary, with their sequence of bases matching such that the adenines of one strand are paired with the thymines of the other strand, and so on.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the end of}} the 20 th century, a {{qualitative}} "revolution" has been going on in the social and human sciences. Prompted by the need to attain deeper knowledge of new human and social phenomena, several researchers abandoned positivism and embraced qualitative methodologies. The field of qualitative research has become so vast that a discussion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>specificities</b> <b>of</b> any particular method requires the identification of the similarities and differences that exist between such method and the various other methods in the field.
