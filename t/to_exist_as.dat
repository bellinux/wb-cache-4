However, the Gulf brand name {{and a number of}} the constituent business divisions of GOC survived.

5|$|It {{is unclear}} when the Qedarites ceased <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> <b>as</b> a {{separately}} defined confederation or people. Allies with the Nabataeans, {{it is likely}} that they were absorbed into the Nabataean state around the 2nd century CE. In Islam, Isma'il is considered to be the ancestral forefather of the Arab people, and in traditional Islamic historiography, Muslim historians have assigned great importance in their accounts to his first two sons (Nebaioth and Qedar), with the genealogy of Muhammad, the Messenger of God in Islam, alternately assigned to one or the other son, depending on the scholar.|$|E

5|$|Some {{evidence}} suggests that Lithuanians began combining their forces {{at the dawn of}} the 13th century. For example, in 1207, soldiers were recruited across Lithuania to fight the German religious orders, and in 1212, Daugirutis' treaty with Novgorod shows that he exerted some degree of influence over a vast area. During the first twenty years of the 13th century, Lithuanians organized some thirty military expeditions to Livonia, Russia, and Poland. Historian Tomas Baranauskas argues that a Lithuanian state could be said <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> <b>as</b> early as 1183.|$|E
5|$|The {{convention}} {{decided not}} to establish a formal association, but <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> <b>as</b> an annual convention with a standing committee to arrange its meetings, publish its proceedings, and execute adopted plans of action. Stone {{was appointed to the}} Central Committee of nine women and nine men. The following spring, she became secretary of the committee and, except for one year, retained that position until 1858. As secretary, Stone took a leading part in organizing and setting the agenda for the national conventions throughout the decade.|$|E

The gunfight and its aftermath stand for the change overcoming America as the Western frontier ceased <b>to</b> <b>exist,</b> <b>as</b> a nation that was rapidly industrializing pushed out what had been a largely agrarian economy.|$|E

Another segment of the Qara Khitai, from a dynasty founded by Buraq Hajib, survived in Kirman as vassals of the Mongols, but ceased <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> <b>as</b> an entity {{during the reign of}} the Mongol Ilkhanid ruler Öljaitü. The Mongols now had a firm outpost in Central Asia {{directly}} bordering the Khwarazm Empire. Relations with the Khwarazms would quickly break down, leading to the Mongol invasion of that territory.|$|E
5|$|From May until August 1910, {{the forest}} reserve supervisor, Fremont Nathan Haines, managed the park's {{resources}} {{as the first}} acting superintendent. In August 1910, William Logan was appointed the park's first superintendent. While the designation of the forest reserve confirmed the traditional usage rights of the Blackfeet, the enabling legislation of the national park does not mention the guarantees to the Native Americans. It is {{the position of the}} United States government that with the special designation as a National Park the mountains ceded their multi-purpose public land status and the former rights ceased <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> <b>as</b> it was confirmed by the Court of Claims in 1935. Some Blackfeet held that their traditional usage rights still exist de jure. In the 1890s, armed standoffs were avoided narrowly several times.|$|E
5|$|Gaelic {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> <b>as</b> a {{spoken language}} in the southern Hebrides throughout the Norse settlement period, but place-name evidence suggests it had a lowly status. The obliteration of pre-Norse names is almost total. There is little continuity of style between Pictish pottery {{in the north and}} that of the early Viking period. The similarities that do exist suggests the later pots may have been made by Norse who had settled in Ireland, or by Irish slaves. In the Firth of Clyde, Norse burials have been found on Arran, although not on Bute, and place-name evidence suggests a settlement pattern that was much less well-developed than in the Hebrides. There are numerous Manx Runestones and place names of Norse origin on the Isle of Man.|$|E

On the same day, the German-installed interim Croatian government called on all Croats to stop fighting, and in the evening, LI Infantry Corps entered Zagreb and relieved the 14th Panzer Division. In the face of the assault by the 14th Panzer Division, the 4th Army quickly ceased <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> <b>as</b> an operational formation. The disintegration of the 4th Army was caused largely by fifth column activity, as it was involved in little fighting.|$|E
5|$|In 567 {{the allies}} made their final move against Cunimund, with Alboin invading the Gepids' lands from the {{northwest}} while Bayan attacked from the northeast. Cunimund attempted to prevent the two armies joining up by moving against the Lombards and clashing with Alboin somewhere between the Tibiscus and Danube rivers. The Gepids were defeated in the ensuing battle, their king slain by Alboin, and Cunimund's daughter Rosamund taken captive, according to references in the Origo. The full destruction of the Gepid kingdom was completed by the Avars, who overcame the Gepids in the east. As a result, the Gepids ceased <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> <b>as</b> an independent people, and were partly absorbed by the Lombards and the Avars. Some time before 568, Alboin's first wife Chlothsind died, and after his victory against Cunimund Alboin married Rosamund, to establish a bond with the remaining Gepids. The war also marked a watershed in the geo-political history of the region, as together with the Lombard migration the following year, it signalled the end of six centuries of Germanic dominance in the Pannonian Basin.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} with the constituent colleges, the colleges of Knox, Massey, Regis, St. Michael's, Trinity, Victoria and Wycliffe continue <b>to</b> <b>exist</b> <b>as</b> legally distinct entities, each possessing a separate financial endowment. While St. Michael's, Trinity and Victoria continue to recognize their religious affiliations and heritage, they have since adopted secular policies of enrolment and teaching in non-divinity subjects. Some colleges have, or once had, collegiate structures of their own: Emmanuel College is a college of Victoria and St. Hilda's College is part of Trinity; St. Joseph’s College had existed as a college within St. Michael's until it was dissolved in 2006. Ewart College existed as an affiliated college until 1991, when it was merged into Knox College. Postgraduate theology degrees are conferred by the colleges of Knox, Regis and Wycliffe, along with the divinity faculties within Emmanuel, St. Michael's and Trinity, including joint degrees with the university through the Toronto School of Theology.|$|E
