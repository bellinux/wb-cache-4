5|$|The highway {{continues}} {{parallel to}} the state line from the Marensico area through <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>forest</b> toward Watersmeet. That unincorporated community {{is the home of}} the Watersmeet High School Nimrods, the basketball team featured on a series of ESPN commercials and a documentary series on the Sundance Channel. The area is also where the waters meet; the rolling hills drain to Lake Superior via the Ontonagon River, to Lake Michigan via the Brule and Menominee rivers, or to the Gulf of Mexico via the Wisconsin and Mississippi rivers. Also located in the area are the Sylvania Wilderness, and the Lac Vieux Desert Indian Reservation, which includes the Lac Vieux Desert Casino and Resort. The highway travels southeasterly from Watersmeet around the many lakes and streams in the area and crosses into rural Iron County. US2 intersects Federal Forest Highway 16 (FFH16) near Golden Lake in Stambaugh Township in the middle of <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>forest.</b> The trunkline then runs along the Iron River as it approaches the city of the same name and meets M‑73.

5|$|The {{history of}} <b>the</b> <b>National</b> <b>Forest</b> System is very complicated.

5|$|A Republican, Harrison {{was elected}} to the {{presidency}} in 1888, defeating the Democratic incumbent, Grover Cleveland. Hallmarks of Harrison's administration included unprecedented economic legislation, including the McKinley Tariff, which imposed historic protective trade rates, and the Sherman Antitrust Act. Harrison also facilitated the creation of <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>forest</b> reserves through an amendment to the Land Revision Act of 1891. During his administration six western states were admitted to the Union. In addition, Harrison substantially strengthened and modernized the U.S. Navy and conducted an active foreign policy, but his proposals to secure federal education funding as well as voting rights enforcement for African Americans were unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|By 1907 President Theodore Roosevelt {{more than}} doubled the forest reserve acreage, and Congress responded by {{limiting}} the President’s ability to proclaim new reserves. <b>The</b> <b>National</b> <b>Forest</b> System underwent a major reorganization in 1908, and in 1911 Congress authorized new additions to the system {{under the authority of}} the Weeks Act. The management goals provided by the Organic Act were expanded upon by the Multiple-Use Sustained-Yield Act of 1960 to include “outdoor recreation, range, timber, watershed, and wildlife and fish purposes” {{as well as for the}} establishment of wilderness areas.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, logging {{began in}} the Pinkham area. After almost total {{deforestation}} of the White Mountain region, the White Mountain National Forest was created in 1911, and the Mount Washington area was added to <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>forest</b> in 1914. With {{the preservation of the}} area, emphasis shifted from logging to recreation. The Appalachian Mountain Club converted a logging camp near the height-of-land into what is now the Pinkham Notch Visitor Center in 1921. The Appalachian Trail was built through the visitor center, making it an important trailhead for ascents of Mount Washington. Meanwhile, ski trails began to be constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps on Wildcat Mountain, and the ski resort was opened in 1958.|$|E

5|$|At Merriweather, M-64 turns easterly again, {{this time}} merging with M-28 and {{becoming}} {{a part of the}} Lake Superior Circle Tour. The two highways run together along the northern end of Lake Gogebic to Bergland. Turning north once again, M-64 crosses a branch line of the Canadian National Railway. The highway runs through more dense forests parallel to the Big Iron River on this north–south leg. The trunkline leaves <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>forest</b> as it passes into the community of White Pine, and the road runs near a former copper mine in the area. M-64 approaches the shores of Lake Superior at Silver City. There, it meets the eastern terminus of the former M-107, a highway designation that ran west into the Porcupine Mountains along the current 107th Engineers Memorial Highway. M-64 turns east along Lake Superior following the shoreline to the outskirts of Ontonagon. The highway crosses the Ontonagon River and terminates on the eastern shore.

5|$|North of this freeway interchange, M-18 is {{also the}} route of Business Loop I-75 (BL I-75). The {{combined}} BL I-75/M-18 runs north near the Roscommon Conservation Airport and turns northeasterly into town. In the middle of Roscommon, BL I-75 turns northwest along Old 76 Road, and M-18 continues northeasterly across a line of the Lake State Railway. The highway continues independently to the northwest over the South Branch of the Au Sable River and out of town. It then turns due east along the Roscommon–Crawford county line. This section of the county line also forms the southern boundary of the Huron National Forest. M-18 curves to the northeast off the county line into <b>the</b> <b>national</b> <b>forest</b> territory where it meets F-97 for a second time.
