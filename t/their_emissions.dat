5|$|The {{proposed}} scheme covered all six greenhouse gases {{specified in the}} Kyoto Protocol and was intended to progressively apply to all {{sectors of the economy}} including agriculture. 'Participants' (who would account for <b>their</b> <b>emissions)</b> were to be few, and high in the production chain of each sector. Their compliance obligation would have been to surrender one New Zealand unit (NZU) or one internationally tradable Kyoto-compliant unit for each tonne of emissions.|$|E

25|$|There are {{examples}} of individuals and organisations purchasing tradable emission permits and 'retiring' (cancelling) them so they cannot be used by emitters to authorise <b>their</b> <b>emissions.</b> This makes the emissions 'cap' lower and therefore further reduces emissions.

25|$|World Bank (2010) {{commented on}} how the Kyoto Protocol had only had a slight effect on curbing global {{emissions}} growth. The treaty was negotiated in 1997, but in 2006, energy-related carbon dioxide emissions had grown by 24%.

25|$|Carbon {{retirement}} involves retiring allowances from emission trading schemes as {{a method}} for offsetting carbon emissions. Under schemes such as the European Union Emission Trading Scheme, EU Emission Allowances (EUAs), which represent the right to release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, are issued to all the largest polluters. The theory is that by buying these allowances and permanently removing them, the price of EUAs increases and provides an incentive for industrial companies to reduce <b>their</b> <b>emissions.</b>|$|E
25|$|In this {{regulatory}} scheme, every current polluting {{facility is}} given or may purchase {{on an open}} market an emissions allowance for each unit of a designated pollutant it emits. Operators can then install pollution control equipment, and sell portions of <b>their</b> <b>emissions</b> allowances they no longer need for their own operations, thereby recovering some of the capital cost of their investment in such equipment. The intention is to give operators economic incentives to install pollution controls.|$|E
25|$|The global {{carbon market}} is {{dominated}} by the European Union, where companies that emit greenhouse gases are required to cut <b>their</b> <b>emissions</b> or buy pollution allowances or carbon credits from the market, under the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS). Europe, which has seen volatile carbon prices due to fluctuations in energy prices and supply and demand, will continue to dominate the global carbon market for another few years, as the U.S. and China—the world's top polluters—have yet to establish mandatory emission-reduction policies.|$|E

25|$|Features of {{companies}} that voluntarily offset emissions : Companies that voluntarily offset their own emissions tend to be of relatively low carbon intensity, as they can offset {{a significant proportion of}} <b>their</b> <b>emissions</b> at relatively low cost. Voluntary offsetting is particularly common in the financial sector. 61 per cent of financial companies in the FTSE 100 offset at least a portion of their 2009 emissions. Twenty-two per cent of financial companies in the FTSE 100 considered their entire 2009 operations to be carbon neutral.|$|E
25|$|In December 2007, after {{a two-year}} debate on a {{proposal}} from Papua New Guinea and Costa Rica, state parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) agreed to explore ways of reducing emissions from deforestation and to enhance forest carbon stocks in developing nations. The underlying idea is that developing nations should be financially compensated if they succeed in reducing their levels of deforestation (through valuing the carbon that is stored in forests); a concept termed 'avoided deforestation (AD) or, REDD if broadened to include reducing forest degradation (see Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation). Under the free market model advocated by the countries who have formed the Coalition of Rainforest Nations, developing nations with rainforests would sell carbon sink credits under a free market system to Kyoto Protocol Annex I states who have exceeded <b>their</b> <b>emissions</b> allowance. Brazil (the state with the largest area of tropical rainforest) however, opposes including avoided deforestation in a carbon trading mechanism and instead favors creation of a multilateral development assistance fund created from donations by developed states. For REDD to be successful science and regulatory infrastructure related to forests will need to increase so nations may inventory all their forest carbon, show that they can control land use {{at the local level}} and prove that <b>their</b> <b>emissions</b> are declining.|$|E
25|$|Emissions trading gives polluters an {{incentive}} to reduce <b>their</b> <b>emissions.</b> However, there are possible perverse incentives that can exist in emissions trading. Allocating permits {{on the basis of}} past emissions ("grandfathering") can result in firms having {{an incentive}} to maintain emissions. For example, a firm that reduced its emissions would receive fewer permits in the future (IMF, 2008, pp.25–26). This problem can also be criticized on ethical grounds, since the polluter is being paid to reduce emissions (Goldemberg et al.., 1996, p.38). On the other hand, a permit system where permits are auctioned rather than given away, provides the government with revenues. These revenues might be used to improve the efficiency of overall climate policy, e.g., by funding reductions in distortionary taxes (Fisher et al.., 1996, p.417).|$|E

25|$|The Conservatives made a {{detailed}} and revised plan on April 25, 2007, after leaks {{of a speech}} {{which was supposed to}} be made by John Baird on April 26 were discovered after some Liberal MPs received a fax of the speech. The new plan seeks to stop the increase of greenhouse gas emissions before 2012 and reduce the amount as much as 20% by 2020. Targets would be imposed to industries before 2015, while home appliances would need to be more energy efficient. There were also rewards for companies that reduced the amount of emissions since 2006. On the next day, Baird announced additional measures including one that would force industries to reduce greenhouse emissions by 18 percent by 2010 while auto industries would have a mandatory fuel-efficient standard by 2011. Later in 2007, Baird revealed other plans and deadlines that industries must meet. The plan mentioned that over 700 big-polluter companies, including oil and gas, pulp and paper, electricity and iron and steel companies, will have to reduce green-house emissions by six percent from 2008 to 2010 and will have to report data on <b>their</b> <b>emissions</b> on every May 31.|$|E
25|$|An {{active galactic nucleus}} (AGN) is {{a compact}} region {{at the center of}} a galaxy that has a higher than normal {{luminosity}} over portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. A galaxy having an active nucleus is called an active galaxy. Active galactic nuclei are the most luminous sources of electromagnetic radiation in the Universe, and their evolution puts constraints on cosmological models. Depending on the type, their luminosity varies over a timescale from a few hours to a few years. The two largest subclasses of active galaxies are quasars and Seyfert galaxies, the main difference between the two being the amount of radiation they emit. In a typical Seyfert galaxy, the nuclear source emits at visible wavelengths an amount of radiation comparable to that of the whole galaxy's constituent stars, while in a quasar, the nuclear source is brighter than the constituent stars by at least a factor of 100. Seyfert galaxies have extremely bright nuclei, with luminosities ranging between 108 and 1011 solar luminosities. Only about 5% of them are radio bright; <b>their</b> <b>emissions</b> are moderate in gamma rays and bright in X-rays. Their visible and infrared spectra shows very bright emission lines of hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, and oxygen. These emission lines exhibit strong Doppler broadening, which implies velocities from , and are believed to originate near an accretion disc surrounding the central black hole.|$|E
