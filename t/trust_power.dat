This excellent person did lately publish, at his own expense, a pamphlet printed in England by authority, to justify the bill for a general excise or inland duty, in order to introduce that blessed scheme among us. What a tender care must such an English patriot for Ireland have of our interest, if he should condescend to sit in our Parliament! I will bridle my indignation. However, methinks I long to see that mortal, who would with pleasure blow us all up at a blast: but he duly receives his thousand pounds a year; makes his progresses like a king; is received in pomp at every town and village where he travels,[187] and shines in the English newspapers.|$|E

How low an opinion I had of human wisdom and integrity, when I was truly informed of the springs and motives of great enterprises and revolutions in the world, and of the contemptible accidents to which they owed their success.|$|E

The participants grapple with issues like economic inequality, justice, diversity, <b>trust,</b> <b>power</b> dynamics, and leadership as they negotiate their way through labor-management relations, political turmoil, and natural disasters. To be successful, players must utilize basic social processes from cooperation and reward to threat and punishment.

40|$|In recent years, the {{formerly}} oligopolistic Enterprise Application Software (EAS) industry began to disintegrate into focal inter-firm networks with one huge, powerful, and multi-national plat-form vendor as the center, surrounded by hundreds or {{even thousands of}} small, niche players that act as complementors. From a theoretical point of view, these platform ecosystems may be governed by two organizing principles - <b>trust</b> and <b>power.</b> However, it is neither from a practical nor from a theoretical perspective clear, how <b>trust</b> and <b>power</b> relate to each other, i. e. whether they act as complements or substitutes. This study tries to elaborate {{our understanding of the}} relationship of <b>trust</b> and <b>power</b> by exploring their interplay using multi-dimensional conceptual-izations of <b>trust</b> and <b>power,</b> and by investigating potential dynamics in this interplay {{over the course of a}} partnership. Based on an exploratory multiple-case study of seven dyadic partner-ships between four platform vendors, and seven complementors, we find six different patterns of how <b>trust</b> and <b>power</b> interact over time. These patterns bear important implications for the suc-cessful management of partnerships between platform vendors and complementors, and clarify the theoretical debate surrounding the relationship of <b>trust</b> and <b>power...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} <b>trust</b> and <b>power</b> as {{means of}} co-ordinating trans-organizational relationships. It is argued that, {{depending on the}} institutional environment, there are two distinct patterns of controlling relationships, where <b>trust</b> and <b>power</b> are interrelated in quite different ways. First, both mechanisms are generated at the inter-personal level and either <b>trust</b> or <b>power</b> dominates the relationship. Second, power occurs {{at the level of}} the structural framework of relationships and is highly conducive to developing trust between individual organizations. Thus, specific forms of <b>trust</b> and <b>power</b> are identified and the institutional environment is viewed as playing a crucial role in shaping the quality of trans-organizational relations. The theoretical background of the paper mainly draws on conceptual ideas of Systems Theory, Structuration Theory and New Institutionalism...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} institutional thinness on hybrid organization and accounting in the UK. The paper argues that hybrids are coordinated {{on the basis of}} combinations of <b>trust</b> and <b>power.</b> <b>Trust</b> and <b>power</b> may be sub-divided into individual trust, system <b>trust,</b> personal <b>power</b> and system power. The availability of system properties further depends on the thickness of institutional resources such as accounting and legal regulations. Where the institutional support is thin such as in UK manufacturing and retailing, private regulation based on symbiotic business relations co-ordinates supply chains. Where institutional support is thicker, such as in the UK construction industry, strategic partnerships based on trusting relations are more likely to develop. Case study evidence is presented that compares inter-firm regulatory systems in different industries...|$|R
