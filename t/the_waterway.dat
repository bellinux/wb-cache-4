5|$|In 1911, a Mr Bowker from Shawford {{successfully}} {{applied for}} the towpath to be diverted, but this was overturned when Rev. J H Du Boulay appealed against the decision. The diversion was sanctioned in 1914, {{although there have been}} doubts about the legality of the action, and subsequently two further diversions were made, at Chickenhall, near the southern end and at Hockley, near the northern end. No maintenance was carried out on <b>the</b> <b>waterway</b> until the formation of Catchment Boards. Thus responsibility for <b>the</b> <b>waterway</b> as a drainage channel passed to the Hampshire Catchment Board in 1942, and some work was carried out to maintain the integrity of <b>the</b> <b>waterway.</b> These responsibilities later passed to the Southern Water Authority, and now reside with the Environment Agency.|$|E
5|$|The Kennet and Avon Canal is a {{waterway}} {{in southern}} England {{with an overall}} length of , made up of two lengths of navigable river linked by a canal. The name is commonly {{used to refer to}} {{the entire length of the}} navigation rather than solely to the central canal section. From Bristol to Bath <b>the</b> <b>waterway</b> follows the natural course of the River Avon before the canal links it to the River Kennet at Newbury, and from there to Reading on the River Thames. In all, <b>the</b> <b>waterway</b> incorporates 105 locks.|$|E

50|$|The {{museum was}} founded in the 1970s as the North West Museum of Inland Navigation, later The Boat Museum and then <b>the</b> National <b>Waterways</b> Museum at Ellesmere Port until 2012. In <b>the</b> 1990s <b>The</b> <b>Waterways</b> Trust took on the {{management}} of <b>the</b> National <b>Waterways</b> Museum.

5|$|Since 2000, {{attempts}} have been made to clarify the legal status and organisational responsibilities for the maintenance of the river and explore issues involving the sustainability and safe use of <b>the</b> <b>waterway</b> for a public trip boat and recreational craft. The work has identified economic and social benefits from the development of the Parrett navigation.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{accidents}} {{took place at}} the bridge over the years, with vessels colliding with the piers due to the hazardous nature of <b>the</b> <b>waterway.</b> In 1960, two river barges hit one of the piers on the bridge, causing two spans to collapse into the river. Repair work was under consideration when a similar collision occurred the following year, after which it was decided that it would be uneconomical to repair the bridge. It was demolished between 1967 and 1970, with few traces remaining.|$|E
5|$|After {{years of}} piping raw sewage {{directly}} into <b>the</b> <b>waterway,</b> Portland built its first {{sewage treatment plant}} next to the lower slough in 1952. The Columbia Boulevard Wastewater Treatment Plant handled a combination of raw sewage and storm runoff that flowed into the sanitary sewer system {{from all over the}} city and piped the treated water into the Columbia River. When runoff exceeded the plant's capacity during heavy rains, sewage still entered the slough from combined sewer overflows (CSO)s at 13outfalls.|$|E

5|$|As the United States {{developed}} the Southwest, the Colorado River {{was seen as}} a potential source of irrigation water. An initial attempt at diverting the river for irrigation purposes occurred in the late 1890s, when land speculator William Beatty built the Alamo Canal just north of the Mexican border; the canal dipped into Mexico before running to a desolate area Beatty named the Imperial Valley. Though water from the Imperial Canal allowed for the widespread settlement of the valley, the canal proved expensive to maintain. After a catastrophic breach that caused the Colorado River to fill the Salton Sea, the Southern Pacific Railroad spent $3million in 1906–07 to stabilize <b>the</b> <b>waterway,</b> an amount it hoped vainly would be reimbursed by the Federal Government. Even after <b>the</b> <b>waterway</b> was stabilized, it proved unsatisfactory because of constant disputes with landowners on the Mexican side of the border.|$|E

5|$|Just {{across the}} county line, NY10 {{passes through the}} village of Ames, a small {{community}} situated south of Canajoharie Creek at the junction of NY10, CR88 and CR89. NY10 crosses over the creek shortly afterward and follows <b>the</b> <b>waterway</b> downhill. Upon entering the village of Canajoharie, NY10 uses Reed Street, Walnut Street, and Rock Street which form a switchback to ease the descent before entering a valley containing the conjoined Mohawk River and Erie Canal and the New York State Thruway (I-90).|$|E
50|$|Through its {{charitable}} arm <b>The</b> <b>Waterways</b> Trust, British Waterways {{maintained a}} museum of its history at <b>the</b> National <b>Waterways</b> Museum's three sites at Gloucester Docks, Stoke Bruerne and Ellesmere Port. Since {{the transfer of the}} assets and responsibilities of British <b>Waterways</b> to <b>the</b> Canal & River Trust <b>the</b> <b>Waterways</b> Trust in England and Wales has merged with the Canal & River Trust. It continues, however, as an independent charity in Scotland.|$|R
50|$|When {{the swift}} boats began making forays up <b>the</b> <b>waterways</b> into <b>the</b> {{interior}} of the delta, they initially took the carriers by surprise, causing them to drop their materials and run off into the overgrowth. Occasionally a short firefight would break out. As {{it became clear that}} control for <b>the</b> <b>waterways</b> was being contested the Viet Cong developed a number of tactics to challenge the US Navy. They set up ambushes, built obstructions in the canals to create choke points, and began to place mines in <b>the</b> <b>waterways.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Petitcodiac {{river valley}} at Moncton is broad and {{relatively}} flat, bounded {{by a long}} ridge to the north (Lutes Mountain) and by the rugged Caledonia Highlands to the south. Moncton lies at the original head of navigation on the river, however a causeway to Riverview (constructed in 1968) resulted in extensive sedimentation of the river channel downstream and rendered the Moncton area of <b>the</b> <b>waterway</b> unnavigable. On 14 April 2010, the causeway gates were opened {{in an effort to}} restore the silt-laden river.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Portland began {{efforts in}} 1997 {{to reduce the}} flow of {{aircraft}} deicing chemicals from the airport into <b>the</b> <b>waterway,</b> though it still diverted concentrated chemicals (mostly glycol) directly into the slough during rare times of reservoir overflow. By 2012, the Port had completed work on an enhanced system that collects, stores, and treats the chemicals, and {{is more likely to}} direct runoff to the Columbia River than the slough.|$|E
5|$|The route {{continued}} past Redbird {{into the}} town of Stockton, where it left Cassadaga Creek and headed uphill as it curved to the west. In Centralia, NY380 met CR54 and CR57 at a four-way intersection. Here, NY380 {{turned back to the}} north and descended into another valley surrounding the Bear Lake Outlet. The route crossed the outlet and followed <b>the</b> <b>waterway</b> into the hamlet of Stockton, centered on the intersection between NY380 and NY424 (now part of CR58).|$|E

5|$|Another storm {{appeared}} {{east of the}} Philippines on May26, located {{south of}} Yap. Initially, the system moved west-northwestward, passing over Palau, where 80% of houses were destroyed; damage was estimated at ¥400,000. The storm turned to the north-northwest, then later curved back to the west-northwest, reaching the Balintang Channel north of Luzon on June2. That day, the town of Basco, Batanes in <b>the</b> <b>waterway</b> recorded a pressure of 973mbar (28.73inHg). On June3, the storm crossed over Taiwan and recurved to the northeast. It was last noted on June6 {{just south of the}} Japanese island of Kyushu.|$|E
5|$|As the {{northern}} tribal lands gradually opened to white settlement, Indiana's population rapidly increased {{and the center}} of population shifted continually northward. Indianapolis was selected to be the site of the new state capital in 1820 because of its central position within the state. The city founders assumed the White River would serve as a major transportation artery; however, <b>the</b> <b>waterway</b> was too sandy for navigation. In 1825, Indianapolis replaced Corydon as the seat of government. The government became established in the Marion County Courthouse as the second state capital building.|$|E
5|$|At {{the eastern}} edge of the island, the highway reaches Swift Creek, another channel {{separating}} Meadow Island from Jones Island. The parkway crosses <b>the</b> <b>waterway</b> and immediately enters a trumpet interchange with the Meadowbrook State Parkway. The right-of-way of the Loop Parkway connects to and from the northbound direction of the Meadowbrook Parkway while two other ramps provide access to the southbound Meadowbrook Parkway. The Loop Parkway handled an average of 30,520 vehicles per day in 2011 according to estimates made by NYSDOT. Traffic along the highway has steadily increased since 2003, when the department recorded a daily average of 24,740 vehicles.|$|E

5|$|East of {{the airport}} {{in the town of}} Massena, NY37 begins to {{parallel}} the north bank of the Raquette River as it intersects NY37C near a hamlet named for <b>the</b> <b>waterway.</b> NY37 and the river continue northeast to the vicinity of the hamlet of Rooseveltown, where NY37 formerly connected to a large traffic circle linking NY37 to the Three Nations Crossing as well as County Route45 (CR45). The traffic circle has since been replaced with a T-intersection and traffic light because of the expansion of the American Customs facility. Upon crossing into Franklin County and the St. Regis Mohawk Reservation a short distance to the east, the road narrows back to a two-lane undivided highway and crosses over the Raquette River.|$|E
5|$|However, his {{re-instatement}} {{was short}} lived, as the navigation ceased {{to operate in}} January 1869, the last month in which tolls were collected. Mortgages of £19,708 were outstanding, of which £2,607 dated from the original construction by Pyott. A plan to buy <b>the</b> <b>waterway</b> by J. R. Stebbings of Southampton in 1871 fell through. A further attempt to buy the navigation was made in 1909 by Patrick O'Carroll, an estate agent from Southsea. He created a company called the Itchen Navigation Ltd, with a capital of £20,000, but {{they were unable to}} establish who owned it, and so the company never traded.|$|E
5|$|I-87 {{begins in}} the Bronx at the {{northern}} approach to the Triborough Bridge, where it connects to the Bruckner Expressway (I-278) at a directional T interchange. The route heads west from the interchange, paralleling loosely with the Harlem River through Mott Haven. After , the highway makes a turn to the north, mirroring {{a change in the}} nearby river's course. It passes by Yankee Stadium on its way to Highbridge, where the Deegan connects to the Cross Bronx Expressway (I-95 and U.S. Route1 or US1) at the eastern approach to the Alexander Hamilton Bridge. The Deegan remains in close proximity to the Harlem River until <b>the</b> <b>waterway</b> turns westward at Kingsbridge to form the northern edge of Manhattan.|$|E
