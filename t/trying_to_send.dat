5|$|The {{story of}} Doom 3 is {{conveyed}} through in-game dialogue and cut scenes, {{as well as}} e-mails, audio logs and video files found throughout the game. The game opens with UAC board member Elliott Swann and his bodyguard Jack Campbell arriving at Mars City, the main access to the UAC's Mars base, disembarking from an Earth transport, with the player's anonymous marine just behind them. Swann and Campbell, here to investigate multiple incidents, have a heated conference meeting with {{the man in charge}} of the Mars laboratories, Dr. Malcolm Betruger while the marine heads to Master Sergeant Thomas Kelly for orders. Kelly gives the marine instructions to find a scientist from the Delta Labs who has gone missing. The marine finds the scientist in a nearby decommissioned communications facility, where he is frantically <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> a warning to the UAC on Earth about Betruger's teleportation experiments. However, as he tries to explain the situation to the marine, another teleportation test takes place and loses containment, at which point the entire Mars base is swept with an unnatural shockwave. This transforms most of the base's personnel into zombies as the forces of Hell invade through the teleporter's portal.|$|E

25|$|Count Roger I of Sicily (1071–1101) {{is known}} to have {{maintained}} men in Mahdia to collect export duties, while Roger II (count from 1105, king 1130–54) twice sent forces against African towns when their rulers defaulted on payments for grain imports. In 1117, when Rafi, governor of Gabès, challenged the trading monopoly of his overlod, Ali ibn Yahyā, emir of Mahdia, he asked Roger for assistance. Rafi was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> out a merchant ship from his own port, and Roger responded by sending a small flotilla, which fled when confronted by Mahdian forces. Ali then arrested the Sicilian agents in his town and requested help from his allies, the Almoravids, and Roger pleaded with him to return relations to normal. A low-level naval war of raids and counter-raids ensued between the Normans and the Almoravids into the 1120s. The most serious raid took place against Nicotera in 1122, when women and children were taken captive.|$|E

500|$|The {{album was}} {{intended}} to be released as a mixtape; with tracks linked through interludes and turntable effects, but was then changed to be set up like a film. Dr. Dre stated, [...] "Everything you hear is planned. It's a movie, with different varieties of situations. So you've got buildups, touching moments, aggressive moments. You've even got a 'Pause for Porno.' It's got everything that a movie needs." [...] Speaking of how he did not record the album for club or radio play and that he planned the album simply for entertainment with comical aspects throughout, he commented [...] "I'm not <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> out any messages or anything with this record. I just basically do hard-core hip-hop and try to add a touch of dark comedy here and there. A lot of times the media just takes this and tries to make it into something else when it's all entertainment first. You shouldn't take it too seriously." ...|$|E

2500|$|The first {{historical}} {{reference to}} Wang Lin's military activities was in 549, when Xiao Yi, then {{governor of the}} important Jing Province (荊州, modern western Hubei), <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> food supplies to the provincial armies trying to lift the siege on the capital Jiankang by the rebel general Hou Jing, ordered Wang to escort a large supply of rice to Jiankang's vicinity. [...] Before Wang could arrive at Jiankang, however, he heard news that Jiankang had fallen and the provincial armies had disbanded. [...] Fearful that the supply would be seized by Hou, Wang dumped the rice into the Yangtze River and returned to Jing Province. [...] Xiao Yi soon made him a commandery governor and created him the Marquess of Jianning. [...] In fall 550, Xiao Yi promoted the status of Yichang Commandery to Yi Province, and made Wang its governor.|$|E

2500|$|In late 2001, Zhang was {{transferred}} to the eastern coastal province of Shandong to become governor. He began serving as provincial party chief, the first-in-charge of the province, beginning in 2002. In Shandong, Zhang told a gathering of assembled local officials, [...] "whether it is my relatives, children, friends; if they go to where you are, please do not go out of your way to receive them, do not curry favour with them, and do not offer to do things for them." [...] This was seen as Zhang <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> a signal that he intended to distance himself from a political culture rife with corruption and complex rules around guanxi. In Shandong, Zhang was known to conduct 'undercover visits' to survey the lives of ordinary people. When Zhang left office, Shandong's GDP had exceeded 2 trillion yuan (~$300 billion), ranking second among provinces in the country.|$|E
2500|$|A {{wireless}} network {{can be seen}} as a collection of (information theoretic) channels sharing space and some common frequency band. Each channel consists of a set of transmitters <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> data to a set of receivers. The simplest channel is the point-to-point channel which involves a single transmitter aiming at sending data to a single receiver. The broadcast channel, in information theory terminology, [...] is the one-to-many situation with a single transmitter aiming at sending different data to different receivers and it arises in, for example, the downlink of a cellular network. The multiple access channel is the converse, with several transmitters aiming at sending different data to a single receiver. This many-to-one situation arises in, for example, the uplink of cellular networks. Other channel types exist such as the [...] many-to-many situation. These (information theoretic) channels are also referred to as network links, many of which will be simultaneously active at any given time.|$|E

She then repeated her performance for the broadcast audience, launching a series of some 500 appearances in programmes designed to entertain the troops. In addition to radio work, Clark frequently toured the United Kingdom with fellow child performer Julie Andrews. Nicknamed the [...] "Singing Sweetheart", she performed for George VI, Winston Churchill and Bernard Montgomery. Clark also became known as [...] "Britain's Shirley Temple" [...] and was considered a mascot by the British Army, whose troops plastered her photos on their tanks for good luck as they advanced into battle.|$|E

Lynsey becomes [...] "determined to find the evidence" [...] she needs to expose Silas, entering into a game of cat-and-mouse with the murderer who begins <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> her mad so no one will listen to her claims.

Silas attempts to kill Lynsey again but mistakenly kills his daughter, Heidi Costello (Kim Tiddy) leading to his arrest. The character also had brief relationships with Malachy Fisher (Glen Wallace), Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan) and Riley Costello (Rob Norbury). Lynsey's exit plot saw the character murdered in a whodunit storyline, with the character clashing with several characters In the run up to her exit to give them motive to kill her. Lynsey's murderer was revealed to be Dr. Paul Browning (Joseph Thompson), who had killed her to prevent her revealing that Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe) had stabbed herself. The character has been described by Hassan who said she is the [...] "typical girl next door" [...] who sees the best in people. During Lynsey's feud with Silas the character was played to show a stronger and more determined side.

6000|$|After all, it was {{not found}} {{necessary}} to have an office competing with another office, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>send</b> out pinker postage-stamps or more picturesque postmen. It was not necessary to efficiency that the postmistress should buy a penny stamp for a halfpenny and sell it for twopence; or that she should haggle and beat customers down {{about the price of}} a postal order; or that she should always take tenders for telegrams. There was obviously nothing actually impossible about the State management of national needs; and the Post Office was at least tolerably managed. Though {{it was not}} always a model employer, by any means, it might be made so by similar methods. It was not impossible that equitable pay, and even equal pay, could be given to the Postmaster-General and the postman. We had only to extend this rule of public responsibility, and we should escape from all the terror of insecurity and torture of compassion, which hag-rides humanity in the insane extremes of economic inequality and injustice.
