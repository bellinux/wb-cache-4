Hudson was convicted of assault with intent to kill and sentenced to four years imprisonment. He appealed to <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court and was granted bail. Parker refused to release Hudson on the grounds that statute law did not provide <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court the authority to demand Hudson's release.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Supreme</b> Council is the {{governing}} {{body of the}} Order and is composed of elected representatives from each jurisdiction.

5|$|A note {{published}} in The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology supported {{the decision on}} procedural grounds, noting that using age in the custody analysis was not a precedent established by <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court.

Instead, the note supported the state court who had applied the law as <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court had in the past.|$|E

However, Breyer is also recognized to be deferential to the interests of law enforcement and to legislative judgments in <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court's First Amendment rulings. Breyer has also demonstrated a consistent pattern of deference to Congress, voting to overturn congressional legislation at a lower rate than any other Supreme Court justice since 1994.|$|E

5|$|Section 1254(1) {{represents}} {{the far more}} common route: certiorari, the source of nearly all <b>the</b> <b>Supreme</b> Court's current docket.
