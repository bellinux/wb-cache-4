5|$|The first {{industrial}} canal in Wales {{was built}} in 1768 to convey coal from the Gwendraeth Valley to the coast, and the following year, the earliest <b>tramroad</b> bridge was on the <b>tramroad</b> built alongside the canal. During the Napoleonic Wars (1799–1815) there was increased demand for coal, iron and agricultural goods, and the county prospered. The landscape changed as much woodland was cleared {{to make way for}} more food production, and mills, power stations, mines and factories sprang up between Llanelli and Pembrey. Carmarthenshire was at the centre of the Rebecca Riots around 1840, when local farmers and agricultural workers dressed as women and rebelled against higher taxes and tolls.|$|E
5|$|The first {{rail lines}} in Preston {{were those of}} the Lancaster Canal <b>Tramroad,</b> a horse-drawn line {{connecting}} {{two parts of the}} Lancaster Canal. It opened in 1805, but never carried passengers and never converted to steam. It ceased operating in Preston in 1862.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{withdrawal}} of London Transport services the Metropolitan Railway's lease was voided and at midnight on 1 December 1935 the railway and stations reverted to {{the control of the}} Oxford & Aylesbury <b>Tramroad</b> Company. The O Board by now had only three members: the 5th Earl Temple, the Earl's agent Robert White, and the former Brill hay-loader manufacturer W.E. Fenemore.|$|E
5|$|On 5 January 1937, {{the board}} of the Oxford & Aylesbury <b>Tramroad</b> met for the last time. On 5 February 1937 a winding up {{petition}} was presented to the High Court, and on 24 March 1937 Mr W.E.Fisher was appointed liquidator. On 11 November 1940 Fisher was formally discharged, and the O officially ceased to exist.|$|E
5|$|The Duke died in 1889, and in 1894 the {{trustees}} of his estate {{set up the}} Oxford & Aylesbury <b>Tramroad</b> Company (O) {{with the intention of}} extending the line from Brill to Oxford. Rail services from London to Oxford were very poor at this time; despite being an extremely roundabout route, had the connection from Quainton Road to Oxford been built {{it would have been the}} shortest route between Oxford and the City of London. The Metropolitan Railway leased the Brill Tramway from 1December 1899, and from then on the MR (the Metropolitan line of the London Underground from July 1933) operated all services on the line. Throughout the operation of the Brill Tramway the track and stations remained in the ownership of the Oxford & Aylesbury <b>Tramroad</b> Company; the MR had an option to purchase the line outright, but it was never taken up.|$|E

50|$|By {{the late}} 1820s {{he had built}} up a {{considerable}} empire, which included both iron and coal mines, and shares in the <b>tramroads</b> which connected them. He was also on the committee of the Severn and Wye Railway and Canal Company and used his position to stifle the expansion of steam railways into the Forest; which threatened the monopoly of his <b>tramroads.</b>|$|R
5|$|Access to {{the canal}} {{brought about a}} rapid {{development}} in coal mining on the Manchester Coalfield west of Worsley. Chaddock pits in the east of Tyldesley were connected to an underground level from Worsley. In 1820, to ease congestion at the Delph in Worsley, Chaddock Pit {{was connected to the}} canal at Boothstown basin by an underground canal, the Chaddock Level which ran in a north west direction from the canal at Boothstown to the pit. Sometime after 1840 Samuel Jackson built a narrow gauge <b>tramroad</b> worked by horses from his Gin Pit Colliery to Marsland Green where he installed cranes and tipplers to load barges at a wharf. The <b>tramroad</b> was later worked by locomotives. In 1867 the Fletchers built a private railway line and the Bedford Basin with facilities for loading coal from Howe Bridge onto barges. Astley Green Colliery began winding coal on the north bank of the canal in 1912. In the 1940s and '50s coal was sent to Barton Power Station and Runcorn Gas Works.|$|E
5|$|In 1883, the Duke of Buckingham {{planned to}} upgrade the route to main line {{standards}} and extend the line to Oxford, creating the shortest route between Aylesbury and Oxford. Despite {{the backing of the}} wealthy Ferdinand de Rothschild, investors were deterred by costly tunnelling. In 1888 a cheaper scheme was proposed in which the line would be built to a lower standard and avoid tunnelling. In anticipation, the line was named the Oxford & Aylesbury <b>Tramroad.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1889 the Duke of Buckingham died, and in 1894 the {{trustees}} of his estate {{set up the}} Oxford & Aylesbury <b>Tramroad</b> Company (O) {{with the intention of}} extending the line from Brill to Oxford, but the extension beyond Brill was never built.

50|$|A {{powerful}} storm breached {{the main}} line near Sandy in 1846, and the low traffic volume was not considered to justify the expenditure of reinstatement. From then onwards the line from Burry Port ended at a colliery and brickworks at Pwll. The company also had two short branch canals which were extended by <b>tramroads</b> to the collieries at Trimsaran and Carway. The <b>tramroads</b> were owned by the respective collieries.|$|R
5|$|On 28 March 1902 the 4th Earl Temple died aged 55, {{succeeded by}} Algernon William Stephen Temple-Gore-Langton, 5th Earl Temple of Stowe. The Oxford & Aylesbury <b>Tramroad</b> Company, which by now did nothing except collect £600 annual rent from the MR, pay the Winwood Charity Trust rent for their land near Quainton Road crossed by the rails, and pay Earl Temple an annual {{dividend}} of £400, remained independent {{under the control}} of the 4th Earl's trustees.|$|E

5|$|From 1872 to 1894 Westcott {{station was}} served by two {{passenger}} trains {{per day in}} each direction, and from 1895 to 1899 the number was increased to three per day. Following the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway, the station was served by four trains per day in each direction until closure in 1935. Improvements to the line carried out {{at the time of}} the transfer to the Oxford & Aylesbury <b>Tramroad</b> reduced journey times from Westcott to Quainton Road and Brill to 13 minutes and 28 minutes respectively.|$|E

5|$|In 1895 two new {{passenger}} carriages, each accommodating 40 passengers, {{were bought}} by the Oxford & Aylesbury <b>Tramroad</b> Company from the Bristol Wagon & Carriage Works {{as part of the}} programme of improvements in anticipation of the extension to Oxford. On 4 October 1899 the MR loaned the O an eight-wheeled 70seat passenger carriage. Following the takeover of the O by the MR, goods services were operated by a fleet of five eight-wheeled carriages built in 1865–66. Two cattle wagons were added to the line's stock in the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|On the {{northern}} side of canal was the terminus for the <b>tramroad</b> which served Old Grove, Prior's, Tyning and Hayeswood pits, with a branch line to Amesbury and Mearns pits. Parts of this line {{were still in}} use in 1873, probably carrying horse-drawn wagons of coal. The southern side of the canal basin {{was connected to the}} pits at Brittens, Littlebrook, Paulton Ham, Paulton Hill, Simons Hill by a tramway which terminated at Salisbury Colliery. In addition the Paulton Foundry used this line. The entire line was disused by 1871 as were the collieries it served.|$|E
5|$|The Monmouthshire Railway and Canal Company was {{incorporated}} on 31 July 1845 and, having acquired the Blaenavon <b>Tramroad</b> {{in the same}} year, it rebuilt and extended the line, which re-opened from Pontypool to Blaenavon (North) on 2 October 1854. Two short and steep branches to Cwmfrwdoer and Cwmnantddu were opened in 1870, with a third to Abersychan and Talywain in 1879. A 99-year lease of the line was granted to the Great Western Railway from 1 August 1875 and the railway company acquired the line on 1 August 1880.|$|E
50|$|The {{industries}} {{of the area}} necessitated good transport links. A network of <b>tramroads</b> was established throughout the Pontypool area to connect sites of extraction to the centres of the production and subsequently to export and market routes. The construction of the Monmouthshire Canal during the 1790s connected Pontnewynydd to Newport and later connected with the Brecknock and Abergavenny Canal at Pontymoile in 1812. <b>Tramroads</b> leading from industrial areas within an eight-mile radius of the canal converged at either Pontnewynydd or Pontymoile.|$|R
5|$|On the {{northern}} side of Timsbury basin was the terminus for the <b>tramroads</b> which served Old Grove, Prior's, Tyning and Hayeswood pits, with a branch line to Amesbury and Mearns pits. Parts of this line {{were still in}} use in 1873, probably all carrying horse-drawn wagons of coal. <b>Tramroads</b> on the southern side of the Paulton basin served Brittens, Littleborrok, Paulton Ham, Paulton Hill, Simons Hill terminating at Salisbury Colliery. In addition the Paulton Foundry used this line. The entire line was disused by 1871 as were the collieries it served.|$|R
50|$|Many {{industrialists}} {{supported the}} works {{as it would}} considerably enhance their business, and the canal was opened in 1796, by which time many of the connecting <b>tramroads</b> had already been completed.|$|R
5|$|The {{new company}} {{was unable to}} raise {{sufficient}} investment to begin construction of the Oxford extension, and had been given only five years by Parliament to build it. On 7 August 1888, {{less than two weeks}} before the authorisation was due to expire, the directors of the Oxford, Aylesbury and Metropolitan Junction Railway Company received the Royal Assent for a revised and much cheaper version. To be called the Oxford & Aylesbury <b>Tramroad</b> (O), this envisaged the extension being built to the same light specifications as the existing Tramway.|$|E
5|$|By 1894 two Manning Wardle {{locomotives}} were in use: Huddersfield, works number 616, built 1876, and Earl Temple, works number 1249, built 1894. Huddersfield {{was bought}} second-hand and {{had originally been}} named Prestwich. Earl Temple, later renamed Brill No.1, was identical to Huddersfield other than having a covered cab, and was bought new. The Oxford & Aylesbury <b>Tramroad</b> could not afford the price, and thus Earl Temple was owned directly by the Earl and rented to the O Wotton No. 2, works number 1415, built 1899, was bought on 7 February 1899 to replace Huddersfield. All three were 0-6-0ST with inside cylinders. The decrepit Huddersfield was sold in 1901, {{and the other two}} Manning Wardle locomotives were sold in 1909.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{cash from}} Rothschild, {{the company could}} not raise {{sufficient}} investment to begin construction of the Oxford extension, and had only been given a five-year window by Parliament in which to build it. On 7 August 1888, {{less than two weeks}} before the authorisation was to expire, the directors of the Oxford, Aylesbury and Metropolitan Junction Railway Company received Royal Assent for a revised and cheaper version. To be called the Oxford & Aylesbury <b>Tramroad</b> (O), the new scheme envisaged the extension's being built to the same light specifications as the existing tramway. To avoid expensive earthworks and tunnelling, the line would parallel a road out of Brill, despite the considerable gradients involved. The entire route would be single track, other than passing places, and the Oxford terminus was to be in George Street, nearer the edge of the city. Jones was sceptical and felt that it unlikely to recoup its construction costs.|$|E
50|$|The {{greater part}} {{of the length of}} the {{northern}} escarpment is scarred by limestone quarries which operated for much of the ninenteenth century. The rock was removed by means of a series of <b>tramroads</b> or tramways which linked north via steep inclines to a wharf on the Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal at Llangattock and south to Brynmawr and the ironworks at Nant-y-glo by two <b>tramroads</b> which contoured the eastern end of the hill. The upper tramway which dates {{from the start of the}} nineteenth century, runs south from Pant y Gilwern and Daren Disgwylfa and then west around the head of Cwm Clydach. It is now a grassy footpath providing easy walking through otherwise rough terrain. The lower tramway was constructed in 1828-30 and has since been converted to a public road. Both <b>tramroads</b> had several branches to serve individual quarries along the escarpment. Both the Twrch Sandstone and Farewell Rock have been quarried on a small scale in the past alongside the B4560 Beaufort Road with larger quarries in the latter once operating near the hill's southwestern corner.|$|R
