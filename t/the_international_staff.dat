Each delegation {{is under the}} responsibility of a Head of delegation who is the official representative of the ICRC in the country. Of its 2,000 professional employees, roughly 800 work in its Geneva headquarters and 1,200 expatriates work in the field. About half of the field workers serve as delegates managing ICRC operations in the different countries, while the other half are specialists like doctors, agronomists, engineers, or interpreters. In the delegations, <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>staff</b> are assisted by some 13,000 national employees, bringing the total staff {{under the authority of}} the ICRC to roughly 15,000. Delegations also often work closely with the National Red Cross Societies of the countries where they are based, and thus can call on the volunteers of the National Red Cross to assist in some of the ICRC operations.|$|E

40|$|<b>International</b> <b>staffing</b> is {{relatively}} unexplored for service firms {{as much of}} the literature focuses on manufacturing firms. We draw on the knowledge-based perspective to analyze three key issues related to venture capital firms' international staffing: composition of <b>the</b> <b>international</b> <b>staffing</b> pool; reasons for the deployment of expatriates; and the process through which <b>staff</b> co-ordinate <b>international</b> decision-making, respectively. These research questions are investigated in an exploratory study combining a survey and qualitative interviews. The results suggest that the recruitment of local executives is significantly more important than the deployment of expatriates, and expatriation is significantly more important for transferring knowledge than for other motives suggested in the literature. In VC firms, investment committees {{play a key role in}} international decision-making, which allows them to manage challenges that otherwise would require deployment of expatriates. Implications of these results for future IHRM research and for the management of venture capital firms are discussed...|$|R
