5|$|Chemically, scandium, yttrium and {{lutetium}} (and presumably lawrencium) {{behave like}} trivalent {{versions of the}} group 1–2 metals. On the other hand, trends going down the group for properties such as melting point, electronegativity and ionic radius, {{are similar to those}} found among their group 4–8 counterparts. In this variant, the number of f electrons in the gaseous forms of the f-block atoms usually matches <b>their</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> f-block. For example, the f-electron counts for the first five f-block elements are La 0, Ce 1, Pr 3, Nd 4 and Pm 5.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} {{chemical}} behaviour, and trends going down group 3 for properties such as melting point, electronegativity and ionic radius, scandium, yttrium, lanthanum and actinium {{are similar to}} their group 1–2 counterparts.

For example, the f-electron counts for the trivalent ions {{of the first three}} f-block elements are Ce 1, Pr 2 and Nd 3.|$|E
5|$|On 16 February, {{two weeks}} {{following}} {{the arrival of}} Charlie Davies in camp, the club made local and national headlines when they announced that they successfully acquired Davies on a 12-month loan deal from Sochaux.

5|$|Senior safety Junior Rosegreen, {{freshman}} end Stanley McClover {{and junior}} nose guard Tommy Jackson were first-team all-SEC picks, signifying {{they were the}} best players at <b>their</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> conference. Rosegreen had fiveinterceptions during the regular season, including four in Auburn's game against Tennessee. That single-game performance tied the SEC record and set the Auburn record for the most interceptions in one game. Jackson finished the regular season with 49tackles, six tackles for loss, and one sack.|$|E
5|$|Teams {{qualified}} for the Champions League group stage, either directly or through three preliminary rounds, based on both <b>their</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> preceding domestic league {{and the strength of}} that league. Both Arsenal and Barcelona entered the competition in the group stages: Arsenal by finishing second in the 2004–05 FA Premier League, and Barcelona by winning La Liga. The group stages were contested as eight double round robin groups of four teams, with the top two qualifying for the knockout stages. Knockout matches were decided based on home and away matches, with the away goals rule, extra time and penalty shootouts as tiebreakers if needed.|$|E
5|$|The La and Ac variant {{remains the}} most common in the literature, despite some calls for a change to the Lu and Lr variant.

5|$|The Stockport County Supporters Co-Operative (Formerly The Stockport County Supporters Trust) is {{the other}} active supporters' group {{where there is a}} £12 annual {{membership}} fee. The Supporters Co-Operative's aim is to give the club's greatest asset – the fans – a voice; as well as a stake in the football club through its Guardian Account. The Supporters Co-Op also assists in running the Stockport County Appearance Number (SCAN) Scheme where every player who has played a senior professional game is recognised with a unique framed certificate and a number which show <b>their</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> list of players to make their debut for the club.|$|E
5|$|The {{appointment}} of Tom Watson as the club's manager in 1896 {{led to the}} club's first period of sustained success. Liverpool consolidated <b>their</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Football League following promotion to the First Division, and won their first League championship in 1901. A further championship followed in 1906, and in 1914 the club reached their first FA Cup final, losing to Burnley. Watson died suddenly in 1915 of pneumonia after {{the outbreak of the}} First World War. The club won two further championships in 1922 and 1923 when football resumed after the war.|$|E

China topped the medal table for the sixth consecutive time in the Asian Games, with 150 gold medals. Athletes from China won the most silver medals (84) and the most medals overall (308). Competitors from the South Korea led the bronze medal count with 84. South Korea also won 96 gold medals, 80 silver medals {{and a total of}} 260 medals, finishing second on the medal table.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the €23.4million and €19.8million earned respectively by the two clubs as prize money, Manchester United and Chelsea received money from the UEFA market pool share. The market pool share had a total value of €277million, shared between the 32 clubs that qualified for the group stage. The pool was split in proportion to each national association's strength in the television market, with the Premier League clubs receiving around €60million in total from the pool. The money was then split between the four teams who qualified for the Champions League from the 2006–07 FA Premier League based on <b>their</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> league {{and the number of}} matches played in the 2007–08 Champions League. This meant that Manchester United, having won the 2006–07 Premier League, received around €19.5million, and Chelsea, as runners-up, received around €16.5million.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} afternoon, Rybka ordered his forces to {{withdraw}} {{to the area}} of the cemetery where he formed a defensive perimeter. During the withdrawal, at least one group of troops was cut off and killed. At about 18:00, Rybka was wounded by a grenade blast and was later evacuated with other casualties in the light aircraft intended to carry away Tito after his capture. Roughly at the same time, his Partisan counterpart in Drvar, Milan Šijan, the commander of the 3rd Lika Proletarian Brigade, was also wounded by German machine gun fire. By 21:30, the Germans had consolidated <b>their</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cemetery, although they were completely surrounded by the Partisans. During the night, the 3rd Lika Proletarian Brigade attacked the cemetery, with the 1st Battalion of the 3rd Brigade of the 9th Dalmatian Division reinforcing the assault. At 03:30 on 26 May, the final Partisan attack was launched against the cemetery, breaching the walls in several places, but the paratroopers held on.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese convoy was {{a result}} of a Japanese Imperial General Headquarters {{decision}} in December 1942 to reinforce <b>their</b> <b>position</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> South West Pacific. A plan was devised to move some 6,900 troops from Rabaul directly to Lae. The plan was understood to be risky, because Allied air power in the area was strong, but it was decided to proceed because otherwise the troops would have to be landed a considerable distance away and march through inhospitable swamp, mountain and jungle terrain without roads before reaching their destination. On 28 February 1943, the convoy – comprising eight destroyers and eight troop transports with an escort of approximately 100 fighters – set out from Simpson Harbour in Rabaul.|$|E
