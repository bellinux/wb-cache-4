50|$|Before Java 6, {{allocation}} of registers was very primitive in the client virtual machine (they {{did not live}} across blocks), which was a problem in CPU designs which had fewer processor registers available, as in x86s. If {{there are no more}} registers available for an operation, the compiler must copy from register to memory (or memory to register), which takes <b>time</b> (<b>registers</b> are significantly faster to access). However, the server virtual machine used a color-graph allocator and did not have this problem.|$|E
50|$|During {{the interim}} mayoral {{election}} in Fót, held on November 24, Liberals' candidate Nóra Mária Vargha received the 13 {{percent of the}} votes and came to the fifth place. According to Fodor, this result showed that liberal voters require an own party, and lack of cooperation of opposition parties is favorable to the ruling party Fidesz. Later a Budapest court decided the annulment of election results because of a violation of campaign silence rules. On 20 December 2013, Századvég's poll for the first <b>time</b> <b>registers</b> support for the Hungarian Liberal Party, which receives 1% of the vote.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Boxed Ambients (BA) replace Mobile Ambients’open {{capability}} with communication primitives acting across ambient boundaries. Expressiveness {{is achieved}} {{at the price}} of communication interferences on message reception whose resolution requires synchronisation of activities at multiple, distributed locations. We study a variant of BA aimed at controlling communication interferences aswell as mobility ones. Our calculus draws inspiration from Safe Ambients (SA) (with passwords) and modifies the communication mechanism of BA. Expressiveness is maintained through a new form of co-capability that at the same <b>time</b> <b>registers</b> incoming agents with the receiver ambient and performs access control...|$|E

40|$|A {{new type}} of shared object, called <b>timed</b> <b>register,</b> is {{proposed}} and used {{for the design of}} indulgent timing-based algorithms. A <b>timed</b> <b>register</b> generalizes the notion of an atomic register as follows: if a process invokes two consecutive operations on the same <b>timed</b> <b>register</b> which are a read followed by a write, then the write operation is executed only if it is invoked at most d time units after the read operation, where d is defined as part of the read operation. In this context, a timing-based algorithm is an algorithm whose correctness relies on the existence of a bound ∆ such that any pair of consecutive constrained read and write operations issued by the same process on the same <b>timed</b> <b>register</b> are separated by at most ∆ time units. An indulgent algorithm is an algorithm that always guarantees the safety properties, and ensures the liveness property as soon as the timing assumptions are satisfied. The usefulness of this {{new type of}} shared object is demonstrated by presenting simple and elegant indulgent timing-based algorithms that solve the mutual exclusion, ℓ-exclusion, adaptive renaming, test&set, and consensus problems. Interestingly, <b>timed</b> <b>registers</b> are universal objects in systems with process crashes and transient timing failures (i. e., they allow building any concurrent object with a sequential specification). The paper also suggests connections with schedulers and contention managers. Categories ands Subject Descriptor...|$|R

40|$|September 9, shows {{great concern}} {{about the danger of}} war with Iraq, and at the same <b>time</b> <b>registers</b> strong disapproval of the new {{military}} technologies which are being developed in the United States. The Transport and General Workers ’ Union has tabled a motion calling upon Britain {{to take the lead in}} eliminating the world’s nuclear arsenals. This policy was agreed in the Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, but no action has been taken by the Permanent Member States of the Security Council which possess nuclear weapons to implement it. This failure also causes strong concern to the Vatican (see the report below from the United Nations). The Transport and General Workers ’ Union calls upon the British Government to refuse co-operation with President Bush’s ‘Son of Star Wars ’ programme of missile ‘defence’. The Transport and Salaried Staffs Association, which organises clerical workers in the railway industry and further afield, has tabled an amendment to this motion, committing the Labour Movement and calling on the Labour Government to ‘firmly oppose any attack on Iraq’: ‘to reduce international tensions and promote peace, Congress opposes the proposed military attack by the USA on Iraq…and urges the British Government to withhold support for such an attack which it considers is contrary to international law and would inevitably destabilise the Middle East. ’ Other trade union leaders have registered strong {{concern about the}}se issues, and pledged support for the initiative of the transport workers. Billy Hayes of the Communications Workers Union said ‘I think the TUC should come out against the war. I do not believe that this would be unpopular.

In this paper, we examine the ITRMs introduced by {{the third and fourth}} author (Koepke and Miller in Logic and Theory of Algorithms LNCS, pp. 306 – 315, 2008), where a register content at a limit time is set to the lim inf of previous register contents if that limit is finite; otherwise the register is reset to 0. The theory of these machines has several similarities to the infinite time Turing machines (ITTMs) of Hamkins and Lewis. The machines can decide all 11 sets, yet are strictly weaker than ITTMs. As in the ITTM situation, we introduce a notion of ITRM-clockable ordinals corresponding to the running times of computations. These form a transitive initial segment of the ordinals. Furthermore we prove a Lost Melody theorem: there is a real r such that there is a program P that halt...|$|R
