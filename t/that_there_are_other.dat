25|$|The U.S. federal {{government}} document Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010 recommends consumption of three glasses of fat-free or low-fat milk {{for adults and}} children 9 and older (less for younger children) per day. This recommendation is disputed by some health researchers who call for more study of the issue, given <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> sources for calcium and vitamin D. The researchers also claim that the recommendations have been unduly influenced by the American dairy industry, and that whole milk may be better for health due to its increased ability to satiate hunger.|$|E
25|$|In {{the study}} How Choice Affects and Reflects Preferences: Revisiting the Free-choice Paradigm (2010) the {{researchers}} criticized the free-choice paradigm as invalid, because the rank-choice-rank method is inaccurate {{for the study}} of cognitive dissonance. That the designing of research-models relies upon the assumption that, if the experimental subject rates options differently in the second survey, then the attitudes of the subject towards the options have changed. <b>That</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> reasons why an experimental subject might achieve different rankings in the second survey; perhaps the subjects were indifferent between choices.|$|E

With the recent arrest of a Gulf Cartel representative in Colombia, the drug business could be disrupted even further. One clear benefactor of the fall of the Gulf Cartel is its rival group, Los Zetas. It is also possible that the several within the Gulf Cartel may decide to join the Sinaloa Cartel or Los Zetas, although the latter seems unlikely given the bitter sentiment both groups have planted.|$|E

25|$|Although Vishnu was a Vedic solar deity, he is {{mentioned}} less often compared to Agni, Indra and other Vedic deities, thereby {{suggesting that he}} had a minor position in the Vedic religion. Other scholars state <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> Vedic deities, such as water deity Nara (also mentioned as Narayana-Purusha in the Brahmanas layer of the Vedas), who together form the historical roots of Vaishnavism. In the late-Vedic texts (~1000 to 500 BCE), the concept of a metaphysical Brahman grows in prominence, and the Vaishnavism tradition considered Vishnu to be identical to Brahman, just like Shaivism and Shaktism consider Shiva and Devi to be Brahman respectively.|$|E
25|$|Psychological {{formalism}} {{is defined}} as the science of mind and corresponds to the behavior of animal objects. Human psychology {{is considered to be a}} unique subset of psychological formalism that deals with human behavior at the level of the individual. Because human behavior is immersed in the larger socio-cultural context (level four in the ToK System), human psychology is considered a hybrid discipline that merges the pure science of psychology with the social sciences. It is important to point out <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> disciplines the ToK System would classify as “hybrids.” Molecular genetics, for example, is a hybrid between chemistry and biology and neuroscience is a hybrid between biology and psychology. As with Henriques' proposed conception of human psychology, both of these disciplines adopt an object level perspective (molecular and cellular, respectively) on phenomena that simultaneously exist as part of meta-level system processes (life and mind, respectively).|$|E
25|$|The main {{causes of}} human {{trafficking}} in Southeast Asia are universal {{factors such as}} poverty and globalization. According to Betz, poverty is not the root of human trafficking and <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> {{factors such as the}} desire to have access to upward mobility and knowledge on the wealth that can be gained from working in urban cities, that ultimately attracts impoverished individuals to human traffickers. Betz claims the industrialization of the region in the mid 20th century led to a clear division between growing economies and stagnant ones. This industrialization of booming economies, like that of Thailand and Singapore created a draw for poor migrants seeking upward mobility and individuals wanting to leave war torn countries. These migrants were an untapped resource in growing economies that had already exhausted the cheap labor from within its borders. A high supply of migrant workers seeking employment and high demand from an economy seeking cheap labor creates a perfect combination for human traffickers to thrive. Still in the new millennium the market for forced labor is profitable; class-divisions and the economies' need for unskilled labor keep traffickers in the market.|$|E

500|$|It is {{uncertain}} {{how much of}} the Brothers Poem is lost. [...] An overlap between P. Oxy. 2289 and P. Sapph. Obbink, the apparent alphabetic arrangement of the poems of Sappho in the Alexandrian edition of her works, and the implausibility of a poem beginning with the word αλλα (meaning [...] "but" [...] or [...] "and yet") all suggest that at least one stanza is missing {{from the beginning of the}} poem. [...] Bär has argued against this position, noting that the overlap between the Oxyrhynchus and Obbink papyri is sufficiently small (only six characters) as to not be conclusive; <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> known exceptions to the alphabetical ordering of Sappho's poems in Book I of the Alexandrian edition, and thematic reasons why the Brothers Poem might have been placed out of order to follow closely after fragment 5; and that there are parallels elsewhere in Greek literature for an inceptive αλλα.|$|E

500|$|In 1978 {{the working}} title James Bond of the Secret Service {{was being used}} and Connery was in the frame once again, {{potentially}} going head-to-head with the next Eon Bond film, Moonraker. By 1980, with legal issues again causing the project to founder, Connery thought himself unlikely to play the role, as he stated {{in an interview in}} the Sunday Express: [...] "when I first worked on the script with Len I had no thought of actually being in the film". When producer Jack Schwartzman became involved, he asked Connery to play Bond; Connery agreed, asking (and getting) a fee of $3 million, ($ million in [...] dollars) a percentage of the profits, as well as casting and script approval. Subsequent to Connery reprising the role, the script has several references to Bond's advancing years – playing on Connery being 52 at the time of filming – and academic Jeremy Black has pointed out <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> aspects of age and disillusionment in the film, such as the Shrubland's porter referring to Bond's car ("They don't make them like that anymore."), the new M having no use for the 00 section and Q with his reduced budgets.|$|E

[...] The torpedos are fired and, although the experiment seems initially to work, the effect is short-lived and the star explodes. [...] The Enterprise returns to Kaelon II. [...] Timicin is crushed, and after some questioning by Lwaxana, he [...] reveals <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> things troubling him. Timicin tells Lwaxana [...] that he is about to turn 60, and on Kaelon II, everyone who reaches that age performs the [...] "Resolution", [...] a ritual act of voluntary euthanasia. Lwaxana is outraged to learn of this and brings it to the attention of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). [...] Picard makes it clear to Lwaxana that due to the Prime Directive, he will not interfere in the planet's local affairs. Lwaxana tries to beam herself down to the planet to halt the process herself but she is thwarted by Deanna who comforts her.|$|E
500|$|Other apologetic {{arguments}} do {{not deny}} {{the meaning of the}} papyri as determined by Egyptologists, but in addition propose that the hieroglyphic text has some hidden meaning. Some apologists argue <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> messages and meanings embedded in the text along with the Egyptologist's translations that are unknown to us. For many years, Hugh Nibley, for instance, preferred the argument that the Sensen text has two meanings: one that can be determined by standard translation, and another than can only be divined with something like the Urim and Thummim, or a seer stone. Similarly, Richley Crapo and John Tvedtnes proposed that the Sensen text may have merely been a mnemonic device, used [...] "to bring to mind 'a set number of memorized phrases relating to Abraham's account of his life.'" [...] Crapo and Tvedtnes argued that, were one to compare the literal meaning of the hieroglyphic characters found in the Sensen text with the Book of Abraham, certain parallels could be found; for instance, the first hieroglyph found the in Sensen text means [...] "this", and Crapo and Tvedtnes pointed out that the opening of [...] reads, [...] "Now this priest had offered..." [...] This argument was popular within LDS circles, but Klaus Baer criticized it because the supposed parallels offered were [...] "related by no visible principle" [...] and instead seemed to have been made ad hoc.|$|E

500|$|The {{authors of}} the 1955 The Record Guide, Edward Sackville-West and Desmond Shawe-Taylor write that Saint-Saëns's {{brilliant}} musicianship was [...] "instrumental in drawing the attention of French musicians {{to the fact that}} <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> forms of music besides opera." [...] In the 2001 edition of Grove's Dictionary, Ratner and Daniel Fallon, analysing Saint-Saëns's orchestral music rate the unnumbered Symphony in A (c.1850) as the most ambitious of the composer's juvenilia. Of the works of his maturity, the First Symphony (1853) is a serious and large-scale work, in which the influence of Schumann is detectable. The [...] "Urbs Roma" [...] Symphony (1856) in some ways represents a backward step, being less deftly orchestrated, and [...] "thick and heavy" [...] in its effect. Ratner and Fallon praise the Second Symphony (1859) as a fine example of orchestral economy and structural cohesion, with passages that show the composer's mastery of fugal writing. The best known of the symphonies is the Third (1886) which, unusually, has prominent parts for piano and organ. It opens in C minor and ends in C major with a stately chorale tune. The four movements are clearly divided into two pairs, a practice Saint-Saëns used elsewhere, notably in the Fourth Piano Concerto (1875) and the First Violin Sonata (1885). The work is dedicated to the memory of Liszt, and uses a recurring motif treated in a Lisztian style of thematic transformation.|$|E
500|$|The Man-Eating Myth was {{reviewed}} by Ivan Brady for the American Anthropologist journal. He {{noted that the}} framework for Arens' scepticism was not coherent and was never spelled out explicitly in the text, even {{if it could be}} deduced from reading the entirety of the work. Brady sees this framework as an [...] "unsophisticated" [...] version of positivism and naturalism, an approach that he laments was becoming increasingly popular in anthropology. Casting a critical eye over Arens' scepticism, he admits to being perplexed as to why only [...] "direct observation" [...] will do as evidence, pondering whether Arens would accept anything short of affidavits by practicing cannibals as evidence for the practice. Brady notes <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>other</b> activities in the world that surely go on [...] such as masturbation in monasteries and homosexual activity in the armed forces [...] but that these would be hidden by a veil of secrecy and therefore difficult to observe directly, suggesting that the same may be true for cannibalism. Moving on, Brady attacks Arens' criticism of anthropology, believing that he has constructed a straw man argument by comparing the early accounts of travellers to the later, 20th-century accounts of anthropologists, and lambasts him for portraying himself as an objective figure in the debate. He argues that in cases such as that of the Carib people, the evidence for cannibalism is [...] "indeterminate", rather than negative, as Arens believes. Concluding his review, Brady admits that he agrees with Arens' premise that socially accepted cannibalism is not as globally widespread as some anthropologists have suggested, but disagreed that anthropologists have been as [...] "reckless" [...] in their claims as Arens charges them with, and furthermore disagrees with Arens' suggestion that the cause can be blamed on poor observation standards.|$|E
