5|$|MAGIC, JAL's {{in-flight}} entertainment system, {{supported by}} the JAL Entertainment Network (now renamed as JAL Mooove!), features the latest hit movies and videos, games and audio programs. There are six generations of the MAGIC system: MAGIC-I, MAGIC-II, MAGIC-III, MAGIC-IV, MAGIC-V and the new MAGIC-VI". Introduced on 1 December 2007, the MAGIC-III system provides Audio/Video On Demand (AVOD) entertainment to all passengers. The number of movie, music, video and game channels on MAGIC-III was doubled from 57 to 130 by 2008; and it is installed on all seats on Boeing 767-300ER, 777-200ER and 777-300ER aircraft. Aircraft with MAGIC-I and MAGIC-II have movies that automatically start when the AVOD system is turned on—once the aircraft reaches cruise level—and economy class passengers can <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> watch the movie in progress; and all movies restart upon completion. Executive and First Class passengers have full AVOD control. MAGIC systems also have JAL's duty-free shopping catalogue, including flight crew recommendations and a video of specials available on the flight. MAGIC-V will feature mostly the same entertainment as MAGIC-III, but with a touch screen controller, along with a handset. There will be USB ports for iPod connectivity, and an easier to control handset. (introduced on selected Boeing 767-300ER routes).|$|E

500|$|Pauline's exit in December 2006 was {{described}} by The Times critic, Tim Teeman, as a landmark episode and a [...] "significant sayonara". He described scenes between Pauline and Dot as [...] "the most moving in a soap this year" [...] and added that [...] "it was a delight to finally alight on an episode... that was so satisfying." [...] Conversely, Pauline's exit {{was described}} as a [...] "mess" [...] by Kevin O'Sullivan, critic of the Sunday Mirror newspaper. He branded the character's final scene unconvincing and badly acted, commenting: [...] "the appropriately feeble scene brought down the curtain on 20 terrible years of Wendy Richard's low-quality performances. We shall not see her like again. If we're lucky! ... I'm certain millions didn't <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> say farewell to sour- faced Pauline. No, they were just checking to make sure she was really dead." ...|$|E
500|$|Mark Wright of The Stage commented overall {{that the}} episode was [...] "about as deliciously old-fashioned as new Who gets," [...] {{stating that the}} script was [...] "a deftly simple premise that makes you wonder why you didn't think of it yourself", and that Tate's {{character}} {{moved away from the}} caricature in [...] "The Runaway Bride". Wright also praised Agyeman for [...] "effortlessly" [...] portraying Martha and her evil cloned counterpart. A fan of the Sontarans, Wright reacted positively to their return and redesign. Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy rated the episode four stars out of five. Rawson-Jones felt the narrative was well plotted and paced, and felt Helen Raynor's writing had improved from [...] "Daleks in Manhattan". Rawson-Jones also praised the reintroductions of UNIT, Martha, Donna's family and the Sontarans, the interaction between Donna and Martha, and Christopher Ryan's portrayal of Staal, but felt Skorr's voice was [...] "distinctly lacklustre." [...] The episode's direction by Douglas Mackinnon also received criticism, particularly the scenes in the clone room. In the end, Rawson-Jones felt that the first part's effectiveness lies on how much the viewers wish to <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> see [...] "The Poison Sky".|$|E
500|$|In June 2014, Clark Gregg stated he {{believed}} the season would be shown in a block of 10 episodes, then breaking for Agent Carter, before airing the remaining 12. Explaining this decision, Bell said, One of our challenges last year was to produce 22 episodes that aired over, what, 40 weeks? 36 weeks? Something like that. And the age of re-runs is dead. Re-runs are death, and so you're trying to commit to the habit of the show and [...] <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> something else or a re-run and they'll get pissed off. They'll go away. What this allows us to do is minimize repeats. We're showing ten episodes, and {{there has to be}} a gap or two because it's physically impossible to produce ten shows and get through post production in time, we can't do that so there's going to be a Marvel special at some point. But pretty much every week you're showing up and we're there, and then instead of a repeat showing up mid-run and losing momentum, Agent Carter comes in and has its own cool stuff, and they're running eight weeks in a row, then we can come back and run twelve in a row with no interruptions. We're still producing our show every week but it just gives us time, barely, to finish 22 on schedule. It takes out the need for repeats in the back half.|$|E

500|$|The seventh-season {{premiere of}} the series, which aired on May 20, 2012 in its earlier timeslot, {{continued}} to deliver high ratings attracting almost three million total viewers which exceeded the {{premiere of the}} previous season by 16%. Kim Kardashian has explained {{the success of the}} show by saying that people <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> watch the series because they can relate themselves {{to the members of the}} family; in an interview with the V magazine she said: [...] "You can see that soap operas aren't on the air as much anymore. I think reality shows are taking over that genre, but I think the draw to our show is that we are relatable." [...] The eighth season debuted to 3 million viewers, up 6% from the previous season, while the subsequent ninth season's premiere was down by 20%. The ninth season averaged 3.3 million total viewers and almost 2.2 million in the 1849 years adult demographic, the most sought after by advertisers. It was the highest rated cable show in its timeslot. The series finished as the most-social ad-supported cable program and, as of March 2015, Keeping Up with the Kardashians is the most-watched show on E! network. The first episode of the tenth season averaged 2.5 million viewers, slightly less than the premiere of the ninth season.

The New York Times Alessandra Stanley praised FX {{for choosing}} another series that [...] "keep the light {{focused on the}} dark side of its main characters". Stanley wrote that [...] "Damages is yet another show that requires viewers to <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> every episode to follow the plot, but it is the most grown-up thriller in the pack [...]" [...] Tim Goodman of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that, in the episode, [...] "All the drama is in the writing and the acting." [...] He complimented the [...] "strong cast", stating that [...] "it's Close who makes Damages a series to contend with". Writing for The Age, Robin Oliver called the pilot [...] "terrific-going-on-sensational". She praised Close and Byrne's performances, but also highlighted Danson's role as [...] "a particularly fine piece of casting". Oliver's Age colleague Melinda Houston called Close [...] "delicious – and convincing" [...] as Patty and thought that the script was [...] "fabulous". S. P. Miskowski of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer remarked, [...] "For my money, this is what a 'thriller' is all about." [...] TV Squad's Jonathan Toomey enjoyed the episode's flashbacks, saying that the style of the show [...] "works and it works well". Matt Mitovich claimed in a TV Guide recap of the episode, [...] "What a pilot it was!" [...] He praised the acting from Close, Danson and Byrne, while he felt that [...] "the supporting cast is excellent as well". Stuart Levine, writing for Variety, called the pilot his favorite episode of the first season.|$|E

Steven's games were uncovered, {{and during the}} confrontation that followed, Steven threatened to kill himself, but accidentally shot Ian's wife Jane (Laurie Brett) and a resulting emergency hysterectomy meant that Jane could no longer have children of her own. The storyline {{has been described by}} The Guardian journalist, Stephen Armstrong, as having [...] "a whiff of Brontë about it", which producer Diederick Santer agreed with. Santer added, [...] "It's a classic madwoman in the attic story, but I hate those articles where someone who works in popular television says what they do is like Dickens. It's about the balance. That story works because it has an old character whom the audience love - Ian Beale - as well as new characters who have an appeal for teenagers fresh to the show. Soap audiences like continuity. They dip in and out and if they haven't watched for a few weeks, then <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> find no one they recognise, it can be disconcerting." ...|$|E

2500|$|Co-creator of EastEnders, Julia Smith, {{has been}} quoted as saying, [...] "Our EastEnd setting {{was chosen for}} the {{diversity}} of its past — the strong culture it has and the multi-racial community that has developed." [...] However, the way that EastEnders treated their black characters during the 1980s has been criticized. Stephen Bourne, author of Black in the British Frame: The Black Experience in British Film and Television has commented that [...] " [...] black characters have rarely been as interesting as their white counterparts, or been given storylines of any substance...Viewers {{were more likely to}} <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> watch the antics of Dirty Den, his wife Angie and bad boy Nick Cotton, than [...] the Carpenter family and Carmel." [...] In Robert Clyde Allen's book, To be Continued--: Soap Operas Around the World, Christine Geraghty has added [...] "none of the black families [...] rivaled the Fowler/Beale [...] position {{at the heart of the}} programme's structure, and black characters were pushed to the margins of the story-lines. Carmel and [...] Darren clearly had an extended family along the lines of the Fowler/Beale nexus but its other members were rarely seen." ...|$|E
2500|$|Holland and Smith {{wanted the}} {{character}} to be feisty and emotionally strong. They {{had been introduced}} to the young actress Susan Tully when they attended an open evening at the Anna Scher Theatre School [...] in North London. They were extremely impressed with her [...] "natural and unaffected" [...] acting abilities and felt she displayed hidden depths of emotion. Despite their interest, both Holland and Smith were hesitant about casting {{her because she was}} already widely known for playing the student Suzanne Ross in the children's television show Grange Hill. Nevertheless, she was asked to audition for the role of Michelle and was informed of the intention to make the character a pregnant schoolgirl. Tully liked the story and liked the fact that the character was going to keep the baby, but what interested her most was the opportunity to allow the character to grow up on screen, something she was unable to do with her Grange Hill character. Although Julia Smith initially feared that Tully was too well-known to play the part, they eventually decided to use this fact to their advantage. Tully had a huge following from Grange Hill, and they felt that those fans would be likely to <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> EastEnders, so she was offered the part.|$|E
2500|$|As {{part of the}} Delivering Quality First {{proposals}} {{submitted by}} the BBC in October 2011 {{and approved by the}} BBC Trust in May 2012, all children's programming on BBC One and Two would be moved permanently to the CBBC and CBeebies channels following the digital switchover. It was found that the majority of child viewers watched the programmes on these channels already and that only 7% of these children watched CBBC programmes on BBC One and Two only, it was made clear [...] "Children's programmes are absolutely fundamental to the BBC and that is why we have protected investment in them in the light of cuts elsewhere." [...] Children's programming on BBC One ended on 21 December 2012. The move was criticised by Teletubbies co-creator Anne Wood, who described the changes as [...] "ghettoising children's programmes" [...] and believe it was merely a cost-cutting measure. Wood said [...] "On the one hand it is inevitable. But it is dismissive of children. There {{is a certain amount of}} overlooking of the fact that children's programmes do get a wider audience than people are aware of... I have frequently had letters from older people who have enjoyed my programmes as much as children do. A lot of the reason older people like to watch children's programming is because it is life-enhancing." [...] Head of BBC Children's, Joe Godwin said: [...] "Our young viewers are our priority and the vast majority of children in the UK already <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> CBeebies and CBBC to find their favourite BBC children's programmes. Far from being a 'cynical' move, we're just following where our audience has already gone." ...|$|E

2500|$|On July 8, 1972, {{inspired}} by the visit of President Richard Nixon to China a few months earlier, Parker announced {{that there would be}} a worldwide satellite broadcast from Hawaii to allow the whole world the chance to see a Presley concert, [...] "since it is impossible for us to play in every major city." [...] (During Presley's career, except for a few concerts in Canada in 1957, he never performed outside the United States). Parker held another press conference on September 4, 1972 in Las Vegas to confirm that the concert, now titled Aloha From Hawaii, would be broadcast on January 14, 1973. The press were told that an audience of 1 billion was expected to <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> see the [...] "first entertainment special to be broadcast live around the world," [...] although Parker had not taken into account the fact that many countries, including parts of Europe and America, would not see the concert live due to the time of the broadcast. Two weeks after the Las Vegas press conference Parker received a letter from Honolulu Advertiser columnist Eddie Sherman. Sherman had read in news accounts that there was to be no charge for admittance to the concerts, a donation to charity being required instead. He suggested to Parker that, as Presley had recorded and was still performing the song [...] "I'll Remember You" [...] written by Kui Lee, the donations could go to the Kui Lee Cancer Fund that had been set up following the death of the songwriter in 1966. Seeing the chance to publicize Presley's charitable nature once again, Parker eagerly agreed. The album was released simultaneously around the world, and went to number 1 on the US charts, the first Presley album to do so since the Roustabout soundtrack, in 1964.|$|E
