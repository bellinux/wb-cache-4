40|$|An {{on-going}} {{question in}} the field of surge protection study is how to predict incipient failure of power electronics {{in the event of a}} short time, high voltage, and high energy transient surge propagation. The work presented in this thesis addresses the above question by investigating how a high voltage transient surge, whose duration is in the microseconds range, will propagate through the two-level <b>transient</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>suppressor</b> system that is intended to protect sophisticated electronics situated close to the service entrance of a building. In this work the energy patterns relevant to the individual components of the system are evaluated using numerical methods and some of the results are also compared with those obtained using SPICE simulations. Although several mathematical models for surge protection components are discussed in the literature and some device specific ones are provided by manufacturers, there is no evidence to show that a complete analysis, using any such model, has been performed to predict the energy absorptions and associated time lags between the components in a TVSS. Numerical simulation techniques using MATLAB are used to estimate the energy absorption and associated time delays in relation to the propagated transient surge, in individual components of a transient voltage surge suppressor. This study develops mathematical models for particular nonlinear transient surge absorbing elements, specifically for the metal oxide varistor and <b>transient</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>suppressor</b> diode, formulates the state equations which are used to numerically simulate several instances of the transient voltage surge suppressor system, and presents simulation results. All results are validated experimentally using a lightning surge simulator. The outcomes established using the two approaches indicate that the theoretical energy calculations are within 10 % of the experimental validations for the metal oxide varistor, which is the main energy absorbing element in the system. The remaining energy distributions in the line-filter components and the <b>transient</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>suppressor</b> diode, which are at least 10 times smaller, are all within 20 % of the experimental results.

Why do failures occur on startup or two weeks after an electrical storm? Most of {{the answers to these}} questions can be found from an analysis of tra-ditional grounding techniques and consideration of how electrical insulation fails. ESPs are predominantly operated on ungrounded power, which can lead to arcing faults and residual charge. Fre-quently the wellhead is not even used as a ground. At other times cathodic protection installers insist on no other connections to the wellhead. Some ground wire connections can actually exacerbate the electrical damage done by lightning. Three-wire power systems are still quite prevalent in the oil field. Ferroresonance and lack of third-harmonic magnetizing current can produce very distorted waveforms.

However, these improvements involve an increase in their sensitivity to external perturbations such as fluctuations in the electricity network, capacitive coupling or electrostatic discharge (ESD). Although there is a wide range of electronic devices designed to protect ICs from such disturbances avoiding destruction (Zener diodes, thyristors, etc.), The continuous reduction of voltage operation and increasing the frequency of work has required a major research effort to adapt the protective devices to the new conditions of operation. The main features that should satisfy any device designed to protect an electronic system are: fast response, low parasitic capacity, driving in low resistance, high absorption capacity of current, low leakage current in reverse, minimum size, low cost, should not interfere in the normal mode of operation of the system that protects and must maintain unchanged its electrical characteristics over time. In high voltage applications, Zener diodes and thyristors are the most used, both in format as a discreet way to the monolithic IC, for protection against ESD phenomena. However, new generations of ICs for mobile applications (portable computers, telecommunications, remote control systems, etc.) Require devices capable of working at low voltage and low energy consumption (in order to maximize the life of batteries). Under these conditions, the protection of traditional elements are not optimal, so that further protection devices with low voltage and low shooting leakage current in his block state. In this situation, the use of new protective structures based on a process of rupture by emptying (punch-through) improves the characteristics of those based on a break by avalanche (base of the traditional components). Thus, this study aims to analyze, optimize, design and produce new elements of protection by breaking with punch-through, known as <b>Transient</b> <b>Voltage</b> <b>Suppressors</b> (TVS), which improve the performance of Zener diodes in applications from low tension (less than 3 V). Thus, Chapter 1 describes the main electric perturbation and sources that originated, along with a description of its effect on the CIs. It also provides a description of the different existing devices suppressors, with special emphasis on TVS, the main topic for this work. In Chapter 2 presents a study of the vertical TVS based in the punch-through effect, which analyzes the electrical characteristics of its two configurations (TVS 3 layers, TVS 4 layers). It also presents the theoretical model of rupture developed for this type of structures as well as the verification of it through numerical simulations and experimental data. Chapter 3 deals with the design, fabrication and characterization of vertical TVS. We show the technological processes done and the improvements are detailed, demonstrating the superiority of TVS 4 layers respect to the TVS 3 layers and Zener diodes.
