40|$|Dead-time {{effect is}} one of the {{dominant}} sources of output current and voltage distortion for pulse width modulated (PWM) amplifiers. Practical switching devices have finite <b>turnon</b> and turn-off time. To avoid short circuit a blanking time is added between turn-off and turn-on of the complementary working switches in a switching-leg. The blanking time, also referred to as dead-time, results in a nonlinear voltage error of the PWM output stage. Especially high-precision applications that require accurate input current for positioning systems suffer from the dead-time effect. Extensive studies have been done on the analysis and elimination, minimization and compensation of dead-time in PWM converters. Most of these techniques rely on the detection of the polarity of the output current of the converter. By using only the polarity of the output current, the inductor current ripple is neglected, which is not sufficient for high-precision applications. In this paper nonlinear feedforward of the current setpoint is used to compensate the dead-time effect. This simple feedforward technique leads to significant improvement of the current tracking during zero crossings over a high output current frequency range, as demonstrated by measurement results...|$|E

When Rayleigh number is low, we got steady-state concentration contours describing a Rayleigh-Bénard type of convection. Moreover, when the Rayleigh number was selected to be big enough, we observe that the system is less stable and a convective fingering is initiated. This instability is caused by a higher density difference between the brine and the sequestrated CO 2. Note here that the turbulence is not taken into account in the study.

40|$|Abstract—To provide {{satisfactory}} customer experience, modern server clusters like Amazon usually set Service Level Agreement (SLA) as guaranteeing {{a certain}} percentile (i. e. 99 %) {{of the customer}} requests to have a response time within a threshold (i. e. 1 s). One way to meet the SLA constraint is to serve the customer requests with sufficient computing capacity based on the worstcase workload estimation in the server cluster. However, this may cause unnecessary power consumption in the server cluster due to over-provision of the computing capacity especially when the workload is highly dynamic. In this paper, we propose an adaptive computing capacity allocation scheme referred to as TailCon. TailCon aims at minimizing the power consumption in the server cluster while satisfying the SLA constraint by adjusting the number of active servers and the CPU frequencies of the <b>turnon</b> machines online. In TailCon, we analyze {{the distribution of the}} request response time dynamically and leverage the measured request response time to estimate the workload intensity in the server cluster, which is used as a continuous feedback to find the proper provision of the computing capacity online based on optimization techniques. We conduct both the emulation using the real-word HTTP traces and the experiments to evaluate the performance of TailCon. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TailCon scheme in enforcing the SLA constraint while saving the power consumption. I...|$|E

Published positions for both the SGR and GRS sources do not preclude spatial coincidence for the two sources, or the GRS transient {{may be associated with}} another SGR source. We outline a model for SGR sources as due to thermal instabilities in spherical accretion onto black holes in giant molecular clouds. We show that the SIGMA position for the GRS 1915 source is consistent with it being in a giant molecular cloud and compare this possible identification with that suggested for the ` 1 E' source in the Galactic center region. Our model would predict a strong concentration of SGR sources toward the Galactic plane (consistent with both SGR 1900 + 14 and SGR 1806 - 20) and so would require the only other known 'SGR,' the GRB 790305 superburst source apparently in the Large Magellanic Cloud, to be fundamentally different.

40|$|Designers of {{electric}} circuits are often {{interested in the}} behaviour of the designed circuits after turn-on effects have damped out. The traditional way to compute this long-term behaviour is by simulating the electric circuit over a large time interval. However, when the turn-on effects damp out slowly, the computational costs may become prohibitive. Many circuits have a periodic oscillating behaviour after <b>turnon</b> effects have damped out. Typical examples of such circuits are radio-frequent (RF) circuits. Such a periodic oscillating solution, {{also known as the}} Periodic Steady State (PSS), can be computed efficiently by using two-point boundary value problem techniques. An extra complication arises because the oscillation period might be unknown a priori. In this thesis, algorithms will be discussed for finding the PSS in the non-autonomous case (where the period is known a priori) and the autonomous case (where the period is an additional unknown). The methods will be compared both from a theoretical and an experimental viewpoint.
