25|$|In large studies, women taking bisphosphonates for {{osteoporosis}} {{have had}} unusual fractures ("bisphosphonate fractures") in the femur (thigh bone) in the shaft (diaphysis or sub-trochanteric region) of the bone, {{rather than at}} the femoral neck, which is the most common site of fracture. However, these unusual fractures are extremely rare (12 in 14,195 women) compared to the common hip fractures (272 in 14,195 women), and the overall reduction in hip fractures caused by bisphosphonate far outweighed the unusual shaft fractures. There are concerns that long-term bisphosphonate use can result in over-suppression of bone turnover. It is hypothesized that micro-cracks in the bone are unable to heal and eventually unite and propagate, resulting in atypical fractures. Such fractures tend to heal poorly and often require some form of bone stimulation, for example bone grafting as a secondary procedure. This complication is not common, and the benefit of overall fracture reduction still holds. In cases where there is concern of such fractures occurring, <b>teriparatide</b> is potentially a good alternative because it does not cause as much damage as a bisphosphonate does by suppressing bone turnover.|$|E
500|$|Roma's {{new coach}} for the 2005–06 season, Luciano Spalletti, went with a 4–2–3–1 formation, {{deploying}} Totti in a newer, more offensive role as a lone striker. Despite his new attacking role, Totti usually dropped deep {{to pick up the}} ball in midfield rather than operating in the penalty area, thus creating space for the attacking midfielders and wingers to making offensive runs; the resulting system was later described as a 4–6–0, while Totti's particular attacking role was dubbed the [...] "false-9". In this new position, Totti continued to score frequently, managing 15 goals in 24 league matches. In the spring of 2005, he renewed his contract until 2010, with an annual salary of €5.4million. On 19 February 2006, he suffered a fracture of his left fibula and ligament damage during a match against Empoli after being fouled by Richard Vanigli. Totti was at risk of missing the 2006 World Cup, but returned to the side on 11 May 2006 as a substitute in Roma's 3–1 Coppa Italia final defeat to Inter. A metal plate had been attached to his ankle during surgery, but doctors decided not to operate again and remove it following Totti's return, concurring that the plate would not affect his game. He was given off-label treatments of <b>teriparatide</b> to speed-up his fracture recovery.|$|E
2500|$|In {{osteoporosis}} and Paget's, {{the most}} popular first-line bisphosphonate drugs are alendronate and risedronate. If these are ineffective or if the person develops digestive tract problems, intravenous pamidronate may be used. Strontium ranelate or <b>teriparatide</b> are used for refractory disease. The use of strontium ranelate is restricted [...] because of increased risk of venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism and serious cardiovascular disorders, including myocardial infarction. In postmenopausal women, the selective estrogen receptor modulator raloxifene is occasionally administered instead of bisphosphonates. [...] Bisphosphonates are beneficial in {{reducing the risk of}} vertebral fracture in steroid induced osteoporosis.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Teriparatide</b> ( [...] a {{recombinant}} {{parathyroid hormone}} [...] ) {{has been shown}} to be effective in treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. Some evidence also indicates strontium ranelate is effective in decreasing the risk of vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Hormone replacement therapy, while effective for osteoporosis, is only recommended in women who also have menopausal symptoms. It is not recommended for osteoporosis by itself. Raloxifene, while effective in decreasing vertebral fractures, does not affect the risk of nonvertebral fracture. And while it reduces the risk of breast cancer, it increases the risk of blood clots and strokes. Denosumab is also effective for preventing osteoporotic fractures but not in males. In hypogonadal men, testosterone {{has been shown to}} improve bone quantity and quality, but, as of 2008, no studies evaluated its effect on fracture risk or in men with a normal testosterone levels. Calcitonin while once recommended is no longer due to the associated risk of cancer and questionable effect on fracture risk.|$|E
50|$|One {{randomized}} {{trial of}} postmenopausal {{women who had}} already fractured vertebra compared <b>teriparatide</b> at either 20 or 40 micrograms per day with placebo. After about 19 months, 14% of the women taking placebo had new vertebral fractures, as compared with 5% of the women taking 20 micrograms of <b>teriparatide</b> and 4% of the women taking 40 micrograms. There were also a statistically significant lower number of non-vertebral fractures in the <b>teriparatide</b> treated group. 20 micrograms of <b>teriparatide</b> increased spine and hip bone mineral density.|$|E
50|$|<b>Teriparatide</b> is {{administered}} by injection once {{a day in the}} thigh or abdomen.|$|E
50|$|<b>Teriparatide</b> is {{the first}} FDA {{approved}} agent {{for the treatment of}} osteoporosis that stimulates new bone formation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Teriparatide</b> is a {{recombinant}} form of {{parathyroid hormone}} {{consisting of the}} first (N-terminus) 34 amino acids, which is the bioactive portion of the hormone. It is an effective anabolic (i.e., bone growing) agent used {{in the treatment of}} some forms of osteoporosis. It is also occasionally used off-label to speed fracture healing. <b>Teriparatide</b> is identical to a portion of human parathyroid hormone (PTH) and intermittent use activates osteoblasts more than osteoclasts, which leads to an overall increase in bone.|$|E
50|$|Indicated in {{patients}} who have evidence of exposed bone but no evidence of infection. It may not necessarily eliminate all the lesions, but it may provide patients with a long term relief. This approach involves a combination of antiseptic mouthwashes and analgesics {{and the use of}} <b>teriparatide.</b> However, note that the <b>teriparatide</b> treatment should not be used in cancer patients, or patients with a history of skeletal radiation or active bone metastases. Splints may be used to protect sites of exposed necrotic bone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Teriparatide</b> is sold by Eli Lilly and Company {{under the}} brand name Forteo. In the United States as of 2015 each dose costs between 579 and 967 USD.|$|E
50|$|<b>Teriparatide</b> is {{a portion}} of human {{parathyroid}} hormone (PTH), amino acid sequence 1 through 34, of the complete molecule (containing 84 amino acids). Endogenous PTH is the primary regulator of calcium and phosphate metabolism in bone and kidney. PTH increases serum calcium, partially accomplishing this by increasing bone resorption. Thus, chronically elevated PTH will deplete bone stores. However, intermittent exposure to PTH will activate osteoblasts more than osteoclasts. Thus, once-daily injections of <b>teriparatide</b> have a net effect of stimulating new bone formation leading to increased bone mineral density.|$|E
5000|$|Abaloparatide is a {{parathyroid}} hormone-related protein (PTHrP) analog drug used {{to treat}} osteoporosis. Like the related drug <b>teriparatide,</b> and unlike bisphosphonates, it is an anabolic (i.e., bone growing) agent.|$|E
50|$|<b>Teriparatide</b> is {{the only}} {{anabolic}} (i.e., bone growing) agent indicated for use in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at a high risk for fracture or {{with a history of}} osteoporotic fracture, patients with multiple risk factors for fracture, and for patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. It has been FDA-approved since 2002. It is effective in growing bone (e.g., 8% increase in bone density in the spine after one year) and reducing the risk of fragility fractures. Osteoporosis medications are generally safe, but some side effects of <b>teriparatide</b> include headache, nausea, dizziness, and limb pain.|$|E
50|$|Combined <b>teriparatide</b> and {{denosumab}} increased BMD {{more than}} either agent alone {{and more than}} has been reported with approved therapies. Combination treatment might, therefore, be useful to treat patients {{at high risk of}} fracture.|$|E
50|$|When {{medical therapy}} is pursued, {{treatment}} includes medications {{with a range}} of actions. Commonly used drugs are bisphosphonates including alendronate, risedronate, and ibandronate; selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as raloxifene; estrogen; calcitonin; and <b>teriparatide.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Teriparatide</b> {{is used as}} off-label {{therapy to}} speed {{fracture}} repair and treat fracture nonunions. It {{has been reported to}} have been successfully used to heal fracture nonunions. Generally, due to HIPAA regulations, it is not publicized when American athletes receive this treatment to improve fracture recovery. But an Italian soccer player, Francesco Totti, was given <b>teriparatide</b> after a tibia/fibula fracture, and he unexpectedly recovered in time for the 2006 World Cup. It has been reported that Mark Mulder used it to recover from a hip fracture Oakland A's for the 2003 MLB playoffs and Terrell Owens to recover from an ankle fracture before the 2005 Super Bowl.|$|E
50|$|<b>Teriparatide</b> {{should not}} be {{prescribed}} {{for people who are}} at increased risks for osteosarcoma. This includes those with Paget's Disease of bone or unexplained elevations of serum alkaline phosphate, open epiphysis, or prior radiation therapy involving the skeleton.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} drug {{remedies}} currently used or proposed for osteoporosis may work for spaceflight, including hormone therapy (estrogen and/or progestin), selective estrogen receptor modulators, bisphosphonates, <b>teriparatide,</b> and others. Whether {{they can provide}} the same benefits for spaceflight as they do for osteoporosis is not yet known.|$|E
50|$|Chemical {{castration}} {{seems to}} have a greater effect on bone density than physical castration. Since the development of <b>teriparatide,</b> this severe bone loss has been able to be reversed in nearly every case. At this time there is a limitation on the use of this medication to 24 months until the long-term use is better evaluated.|$|E
50|$|<b>Teriparatide</b> was {{approved}} by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on 26 November 2002, for the treatment of osteoporosis in men and postmenopausal women who are at high risk for having a fracture. The drug is also approved to increase bone mass in men with primary or hypogonadal osteoporosis who are at high risk for fracture.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of rare but well-described genetic {{conditions}} affecting parathyroid hormone metabolism, including pseudohypoparathyroidism, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia, and autosomal dominant hypercalciuric hypocalcemia. Of note, PTH is unchanged in pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism. In osteoporotic women, administration of an exogenous parathyroid hormone analogue (<b>teriparatide,</b> by daily injection) superimposed on estrogen therapy produced increases in bone mass and reduced vertebral and nonvertebral fractures by 45 to 65%.|$|E
50|$|As osteocalcin is {{produced}} by osteoblasts, it is often used as a marker for the bone formation process. It has been observed that higher serum-osteocalcin levels are relatively well correlated with increases in bone mineral density (BMD) during treatment with anabolic bone formation drugs for osteoporosis, such as <b>Teriparatide.</b> In many studies, osteocalcin {{is used as a}} preliminary biomarker on the effectiveness of a given drug on bone formation. For instance, one study which aimed to study the effectiveness of a glycoprotein called lactoferrin on bone formation used osteocalcin as a measure of osteoblast activity.|$|E
50|$|In {{osteoporosis}} and Paget's, {{the most}} popular first-line bisphosphonate drugs are alendronate and risedronate. If these are ineffective or if the person develops digestive tract problems, intravenous pamidronate may be used. Strontium ranelate or <b>teriparatide</b> are used for refractory disease.

5000|$|<b>Teriparatide</b> has a {{theoretical}} risk of osteosarcoma, which {{was found in}} rat studies but not confirmed in humans. This may be because unlike humans, rat bones grow for their entire life. The tumors found in the rat studies were located {{on the end of}} the bones which grew after the injections began. After nine years on the market, there were only two cases of osteosarcoma reported. This risk was considered by the FDA as [...] "extremely rare" [...] (1 in 100,000 people) and is only slightly more than the incidence in the population over 60 years old (0.4 in 100,000).|$|E
50|$|Hypoparathyroidism is {{decreased}} {{function of the}} parathyroid glands with underproduction of parathyroid hormone. This can lead to low levels of calcium in the blood, often causing cramping and twitching of muscles or tetany (involuntary muscle contraction), and several other symptoms. The condition can be inherited, {{but it is also}} encountered after thyroid or parathyroid gland surgery, and it can be caused by immune system-related damage {{as well as a number}} of rarer causes. The diagnosis is made with blood tests, and other investigations such as genetic testing depending on the results. The treatment of hypoparathyroidism is limited by the fact that there is no exact form of the hormone that can be administered as replacement. However <b>teriparatide,</b> brand name Forteo, a biosimilar peptide to parathyroid hormone, may be given by injection. Calcium replacement or vitamin D can ameliorate the symptoms but can increase the risk of kidney stones and chronic kidney disease.|$|E

50|$|An {{antibody}} for sclerostin {{is being}} developed because of the protein’s specificity to bone. Its use has increased bone growth in preclinical trials in osteoporotic rats and monkeys. In a Phase I study, a single dose of anti-sclerostin antibody from Amgen (Romosozumab) increased bone density in the hip and spine in healthy men and postmenopausal women and the drug was well tolerated. In a Phase II trial, one year of the antibody treatment in osteoporotic women increased bone density more than bisphosphonate and <b>teriparatide</b> treatment; it had mild injection side effects. A Phase II trial of a monoclonal human antibody to sclerostin from Eli Lilly had positive effects on post-menopausal women. Monthly treatments of the antibody for one year increased the bone mineral density of the spine and hip by 18 percent and 6 percent, respectively, compared to the placebo group. In a Phase III trial, one year of Romosozumab treatment in post-menopausal women reduced the risk of vertebral fractures compared to the placebo group. It also increased the bone mineral density in the lumbar spine (13.3% versus 0.0%), femoral neck (5.2% versus -0.7%) and total hip (6.8% versus 0.0%) compared to the placebo group. Adverse events were balanced between the groups.|$|E

40|$|<b>Teriparatide,</b> a {{recombinant}} PTH, is an anabolic {{treatment for}} osteoporosis that increases bone density. Transient hypercalcemia is a reported {{side effect of}} <b>teriparatide</b> that is seen few hours following administration of <b>teriparatide</b> and resolves usually within 16 hours of drug administration. Persistent hypercalcemia, although not observed in clinical trials, is rarely reported. The current case describes a rare complication of <b>teriparatide</b> induced delayed persistent hypercalcemia...|$|E
40|$|Patients {{treated with}} <b>teriparatide</b> after prior and ongoing alendronate therapy {{experience}} spine BMD increases; however, some {{continue to be}} {{at high risk for}} fracture, based on persistently low BMD and/or fracture history. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether a second discrete retreatment course with <b>teriparatide</b> could produce similar biochemical and BMD changes as seen during the first <b>teriparatide</b> course. In the original treatment study, 126 women on alendronate for ≥ 1 yr were randomized to continue alendronate and receive daily <b>teriparatide,</b> cyclic <b>teriparatide</b> (3 -mo cycles), or alendronate alone for 15 mo. Of the 72 patients who completed either original <b>teriparatide</b> regimen, 49 completed a 12 -mo follow-up on continued alendronate alone. At that time, 32 patients, who remained at high risk of future fracture, were recruited into the retreatment protocol and 27 completed another course of <b>teriparatide</b> administered daily for 15 mo (including 15 from the original daily treatment group and 12 from the original cyclic treatment group). Bone formation indices (propeptide of type I procollagen and osteocalcin) increased during both <b>teriparatide</b> courses with median 3 -mo increments of 120 % and 72 % above baseline during the original course and 60 % and 40 % above baseline during retreatment, respectively. Mean spine BMD increments were 6. 2 % after the first daily course and 4. 7 % after retreatment and 4. 1 % after the first course of cyclic <b>teriparatide</b> and 4. 9 % after retreatment. We conclude that retreatment with <b>teriparatide</b> stimulates bone formation and increases spine BMD to a similar extent as seen during the original <b>teriparatide</b> course. Retreatment with <b>teriparatide</b> may be a viable option for some patients with severe osteoporosis who have received prior <b>teriparatide</b> therapy...|$|E
40|$|Osteoanabolic {{therapy is}} an {{attractive}} therapeutic option for men with osteoporosis because it directly stimulates bone formation, an action not shared by any antiresorptive drug. <b>Teriparatide</b> (recombinant human PTH(1 - 34)) and PTH(1 - 84) are available in many countries but PTH(1 - 84) is not available in the United States. Only <b>teriparatide</b> is approved {{for the treatment of}} osteoporosis in men. It is also indicated in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis. <b>Teriparatide</b> is associated with major gains in bone density at the lumbar spine and, to a lesser extent, in the hip regions. Vertebral and nonvertebral fractures are reduced in postmenopausal women treated with <b>teriparatide.</b> Fracture reduction data in men are less secure because the number of study subjects is small and the studies have not been powered to document this endpoint.

40|$|<b>Teriparatide</b> (rDNA origin) {{injection}} [recombinant human PTH (1 - 34) ] stimulates bone formation, increases {{bone mineral}} density (BMD), and restores bone architecture and integrity.

We compared {{the effects of}} <b>teriparatide</b> and alendronate sodium on BMD, nonvertebral fracture incidence, and bone turnover in 146 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Women were randomized to either once-daily sc injections of <b>teriparatide</b> 40 micro g plus oral placebo (n = 73) or oral alendronate 10 mg plus placebo injection (n = 73). Median duration of treatment was 14 months. At 3 months, <b>teriparatide</b> increased lumbar spine BMD significantly more than did alendronate (P < 0. 001). Lumbar spine-BMD increased by 12. 2 % in the <b>teriparatide</b> group and 5. 6 % in the alendronate group (P < 0. 001 <b>teriparatide</b> vs. alendronate). <b>Teriparatide</b> increased femoral neck BMD and total body bone mineral significantly more than did alendronate, but BMD at the one third distal radius decreased, compared with alendronate (P < or = 0. 05). Nonvertebral fracture incidence was significantly lower in the <b>teriparatide</b> group than in the alendronate group (P < 0. 05). Both treatments were well tolerated despite transient mild asymptomatic hypercalcemia with <b>teriparatide</b> treatment.
