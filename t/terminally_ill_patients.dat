25|$|Dame Cicely Saunders was a British {{registered}} nurse whose chronic health problems had {{forced her to}} pursue a career in medical social work. The relationship she developed with a dying Polish refugee helped solidify her ideas that <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>patients</b> needed compassionate care to help address their fears and concerns as well as palliative comfort for physical symptoms. After the refugee's death, Saunders began volunteering at St Luke's Home for the Dying Poor, where a physician told her that she could best influence the treatment of the terminally ill as a physician. Saunders entered medical school while continuing her volunteer work at St. Joseph's. When she achieved her degree in 1957, she took a position there.|$|E

25|$|Her husband {{left his}} {{engineering}} firm and enrolled at Columbia University in 1971 {{with a major}} in hospital planning. It was his master's degree thesis that provided the framework for the Connecticut Hospice. Wald conducted a two-year research program studying how <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>patients</b> fared {{at home or in}} a healthcare facility, and tracked how patients and their families felt throughout the process. After returning to the United States, she organized a team of doctors, clergy and nurses to investigate the needs of dying patients. In 1974, she, along with two pediatricians and a Yale medical center chaplain, founded the first hospice in the United States at the Connecticut Hospice, located in Branford, Connecticut. Initially the program provided home care, and had its first inpatient location in 1980, a 44-bed facility in Branford. Disagreements had been brewing within the board about her vision for the hospice program, and she was forced to resign shortly after its opening.|$|E
40|$|In Western Australia, {{in-patient}} hospice/palliative care {{units are}} caring for {{increasing numbers of}} <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> cancer <b>patients.</b> Hospice philosophy {{is based on the}} belief that the <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>patient</b> in individual needs are of paramount importance. The needs of advanced cancer patients have been researched in the home, for patients continuing or having completed curative treatment, and for patients receiving palliative care. However, there is a lack of literature about the needs of <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> cancer <b>patients</b> in in-patient hospices. Using a descriptive approach, this study investigated the needs of six <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> cancer <b>patients</b> in a 26 bed in-patient hospice unit. Semi-structured interviews based on Henderson 2 ̆ 7 s (1964) 14 fundamental needs were used to elicit information about these patients needs’. Data was analysed using thematic analysis to determine common categories of need. Findings suggest that <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> cancer <b>patients</b> in an in-patient hospice unit have seven common need categories. These are physiological, psychological, sociological, spiritual, informational, financial and environmental categories of need. Three overriding needs are described as the need to feel safe, to maintain family contact and to reduce the impact of visitors. Implications of the findings for nurses are discussed...|$|R

25|$|The {{birthday}} effect (sometimes {{called the}} birthday blues, especially when referring specifically to suicide) is a statistical phenomenon where an individual's likelihood of death appears to increase on {{or close to}} their birthday. The birthday effect has been seen in studies of general populations in England and Wales, Switzerland, Ukraine, and the United States, {{as well as in}} smaller populations such as Major League Baseball players. Studies do not consistently show this effect; some studies find that men's and women's mortality rates diverge {{in the run-up to the}} birthday, while others find no significant gender effect. Suggested mechanisms for the effect include alcohol consumption, psychological stress relating to the birthday, increased suicide risk, <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>patients</b> attempting to hold on until their birthday, an increased mortality salience, or a physiological cycle that causes the body to weaken annually. It has also been suggested that it may be a statistical artifact, perhaps as a result of anomalies in reporting, but the birthday effect has also been seen in studies that control for known reporting anomalies.|$|E
25|$|In Adams’ case, {{the court}} did not ignore the {{suggestion}} that he had hastened death and, as Devlin makes clear, he needed to clarify for the jury, and incidentally the medical profession, {{the extent to which the}} law allowed the orthodox doctor to go in easing the passing of the dying. Mahar regards Adam’s statements to Hannam on Mrs Morrell as less about his guilt or innocence than a disconnection between the medical and legal views on assisted dying: Adams never denied giving his patients large doses of opiates, but denied it was murder. This was not simply Adams' idiosyncratic view, as appears from the evidence of Dr. Douthwaite for the prosecution, who accepted that a physician might knowingly give fatal doses of pain relieving drugs to a <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>patients,</b> adding it was not his business to say whether it was murder. Devlin’s directions to the jury confirmed that it was a medical issue, not a legal or moral one, whether Adam’s treatment was designed to promote comfort. Devlin’s view was that Adams may have been guilty of mercy killing or even perhaps finishing off a troublesome patient, but was one who cared for his patients to the best of his ability. Adams eased the passing of Mrs Morrell, but his greed brought his motives into question. Mahar notes an editorial in a medical journal following the case suggested that the publicity it caused might hamper medical discretion, but claimed the use of opiates in terminal cases was essential. Adams may be seen as an extreme case in their use, but other doctors also used them to ease the passing.|$|E
