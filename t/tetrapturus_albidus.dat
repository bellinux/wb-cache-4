40|$|Historically, stock {{assessments}} of Atlantic blue marlin (Makaira nigricans) and white marlin (<b>Tetrapturus</b> <b>albidus),</b> conducted {{under the auspices}} of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), have been restricted to production modeling approaches. Pro-duction models are used due to the unique fisheries and biological as-pects of the species which result in a paucity of detailed information on the size or age structure of the catch. These analyses have evolved from single index equilibrium, to multiple index non-equilibrium models, as the ICCAT Enhanced Research Program for Billfish improved the Atlantic-wide data and new non-equilibrium multifishery production models be-came available. Analyses of these fisheries data have been conducted over the last two decades through a series of intersessional billfish workshops held by ICCAT, under various stock structure hypotheses, to provide esti-mates of historical relative biomass, fishing mortalities, and maximum sustainable yield. Among the difficulties in modeling stock biomass, there have been conflicting indices of abundance for several fisheries, difficul-ties in modeling the dynamics of precipitous drops in CPUE through non– age structured approaches, and typically flat solution surfaces which cause difficulty in searches for optimal, unconstrained model solutions.

40|$|The long {{historical}} data on sport fishing activities at Playa Grande Yachting Club (PGYC), lo-cated {{in the central}} Venezuelan coast near La Guaira, has served as an index to identify mayor trends in billfish abundance within the North Atlantic Ocean. In 1990, the Venezuelan Govern-ment issued a regulation restricting the landing and commercialization of billfish in a 50 -mile zone around La Guaira, {{in an effort to}} protect billfish populations in this area where sport fishing is particularly intense. The regulation induced misreporting of billfish catches by the sport fishers in PGYC, which lowered the quality of information in the {{historical data}}base after 1990. In this paper, a comparison is made between the trends in billfish abundance observed in PGYC and alternative information on billfish sport fishing tournaments performed in the same fishing ground (Placer de La Guaira), for the periods 1984 - 90 and 1991 - 99. Pearson correlation coefficients between the CPUE-PGYC and CPUE-tournament series were highly significant for blue marlin (Makaira nigricans) but only marginally significant for sailfish (Istiophorus platypterus) using the 1984 - 90 CPUE series; the correlation was non-significant for white marlin (<b>Tetrapturus</b> <b>albidus).</b> The correlations for the three species are non-significant when the 1984 - 99 CPUE series ar...|$|E
40|$|The roundscale spearfish, Tetrapturus georgii Lowe, 1840, {{is known}} only from four {{specimens}} from the Mediterranean and eastern North Atlantic. Additional specimens {{have not been}} identified since 1961, making the validity and distribution of this species unclear. Analysis of 16 billfish specimens from the western North Atlantic {{on the basis of}} scale morphology, anus position, and mitochondrial DNA confirms the validity of this species and extends its distribution. Mid-lateral scales are soft, notably rounded anteriorly, and bear 2 – 3 points distinct from those of the sympatric longbill spearfish (Tetrapturus pfluegeri Robins and de Sylva, 1963) and white marlin (<b>Tetrapturus</b> <b>albidus</b> Poey, 1860). Position of anus relative to first anal fin and a related morphometric ratio (distance from anus to first anal fin origin: height of first anal fin) are intermediate between T. pfluegeri and T. albidus. These characteristics match those described by Robins (1974) from the four eastern North Atlantic specimens of T. georgii. The mitochondrial ND 4 L, ND 4, and cyt b gene sequences strongly support reciprocal monophyly of the western North Atlantic specimens relative to other Atlantic istiophorids. The difficulty in distinguishing between morphologically similar T. georgii and T. albidus in the field and the previously unrecognized presence of T. georgii in the western North Atlantic has implications for stock assessments of T. albidus, a species that is severely overfished...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —Throughout the Atlantic, {{the white}} marlin Kajika albida (formerly <b>Tetrapturus</b> <b>albidus)</b> is overfished but remains a major target species for {{offshore}} recreational anglers. The {{vast majority of}} white marlin taken in the U. S. fishery are caught on natural baits and subsequently released. A previous study demonstrated {{that the use of}} circle hooks with natural baits resulted in a highly significant increase in white marlin postrelease survival relative to the use of straight-shank (J-type) hooks with natural baits. However, several models of circle hooks, which vary in shape {{and the degree to which}} the point is offset from the shaft, are available to anglers. Survival estimates determined from experiments conducted using one model may not be transferable to other models. We evaluated postrelease survival of white marlin caught on three circle hook models commonly used in the recreational fishery. High-resolution pop-up satellite archival tags that were programmed to release from the fish after 10 d were deployed to follow the fates of 20 white marlin caught on each type of circle hook. Only one mortality was inferred from the 59 tags that provided useful data. No significant differences in the incidence of deep (internal) hooking, hook-induced trauma, or postrelease survival were found among fish caught on the different circle hook models. Incidences of white marlin deep hooking, hook-induced trauma, and postrelease mortality were significantly lower for the three circle hook models (combined) than for J hooks evaluated in a previous study.

40|$|Abstract. —U. S. law {{requires}} that overfished fish populations be rebuilt within 10 years when biologically possible, and otherwise within the time {{it would take to}} rebuild in the absence of fishing plus one mean generation time (MGT). Most overfished populations can recover in less than 10 years; the exceptions are populations with very low productivity and some that are severely depleted. A range of harvest control policies, including constant fishing mortalities and variable harvest rate control rules, were compared in terms of their ability to rebuild overfished populations of five species within the required times. The North Atlantic swordfish Xiphias gladius and Gulf of Mexico red snapper Lutjanus campechanus populations were able to rebuild in 10 years, but the white marlin <b>Tetrapturus</b> <b>albidus,</b> sandbar shark Carcharhinus plumbeus, and darkblotched rockfish Sebastes crameri populations were not. The harvest policy that resulted in populations being rebuilt most rapidly was either a control rule that reduced fishing mortality with decreasing biomass or a constant harvest rate designed to meet the current rebuilding time requirement. The control rules we analyzed restricted catches {{at the beginning of the}} rebuilding period but allowed catches to increase rapidly as the population was rebuilt. Thus, there was a trade-off between relatively high catches early in the rebuilding period and high catches later in the rebuilding period when the population had been rebuilt and could sustain high catches. Whether the population was rebuilt more rapidly under a fixed rebuilding-time requirement or...|$|E
40|$|The {{white marlin}} <b>Tetrapturus</b> <b>albidus</b> (Istiophoridae) is {{considered}} to be among the most overexploited species under international management jurisdiction in the Atlantic Ocean, resulting in diverse stakeholder concerns. Efforts have been made to add it to the US Endangered Species List. Its population status has become uncertain with the realization that: (1) longstanding misidentifications of white marlin have occurred with the recently recognized, morphologically similar and sympatric roundscale spearfish T. georgii; and (2) the 2 species have unknowingly been assessed and managed as a species group. We show that roundscale spearfish currently constitute a substantial proportion (~ 27 %) of the overall ‘white marlin’ catch in the western North Atlantic, with high spatial variation within this region. Consequently, the accuracy of current biological knowledge on white marlin, some of which has formed the input for past population status modeling, is compromised by ‘contamination’ due to misidentification. Population assessment simulations in the western North Atlantic incorporating the proportion of roundscale spearfish (27 %) were run; these indicated that historical changes in the ratio of the 2 species, as well as differences in the population growth rates between T. albidus and T. georgii, affect simulation results. Our findings suggest misidentifications between the species may have affected the accuracy of past T. albidus population assessments in the western North Atlantic, which therefore need re-visiting to permit improved management and recovery of this species. New collection of life history data for T. albidus and T. georgii is also recommended to corroborate the results of historical studies...|$|E
40|$|This {{contribution}} is aimed to {{the identification of}} reproductive patterns of billfishes, which is in turn a key issue supporting management and conservation policies. Information {{reported in the literature}} on features of reproductive processes of billfishes was examined with a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to identify groups of species with similar reproductive strategies. PCA was applied based in a correlation matrix and the significances (p< 0. 05) of the factors and loadings of the variables were used as criteria for the identification of reproductive patterns. In general, four groups were found. The first group consists of <b>Tetrapturus</b> <b>albidus</b> and T. audax, which are characterised by rapid growth, an early age at first maturity with respect to maximum age (T/Tmax) and high values of reproductive variables (e. g., Spawning Duration (Sd), Spawning Frequency (Sf), Annual Fecundity (AF) and Relative Fecundity (RF). A second group consists of T. belone, T. georgii and T. pfluegeri, which present rapid growth, high Tm/Tmax ratios and Batch Fecundity (BF) values and low Sd values. Another group consists of the genera Makaira and Xiphias, which present low Lm/Lmax ratios and high values for AF, RF, Sf and BF. The last group consists of species of the genus Istiophorus, which present the lowest AF values and the highest RF and BF values. In billfishes, the reproductive pattern is strongly influenced by the growth process and the age at which a species reaches sexual maturity relative to its maximum age. The observed differences in reproductive variables result from adaptive mechanisms that allow species greater reproductive success in the epipelagic environment...|$|E

This is the only record of M. purdyi, the first fossil record of the genus Tetrapturus (specifically T. albidus), the second fossil record of I. platypterus and M. indica, and the first record of I. platypterus, M. indica, M. nigricans, and T. albidus from fossil deposits bordering the Atlantic Ocean. Identification was accomplished by converting length and width measurements of individual fossil elements to ratios (proportions), treating them as variables, and comparing them to ratios computed from a large series ofbones from extant istiophorid species. Ratios of a fossil specimen that fell outside the range of ratios computed for extant species, or that were equivocal as to genus or species, were identified {{as one of the}} following: Istiophoridae, genus and species indeterminate; Istiophorus cf. I. platypterus; Makaira cf. M. indica; M. cf. M. nigricans; M. purdyi; cf. Makaira sp.; or Tetrapturus cf. T. albidus.

40|$|With a {{focus on}} white marlin (<b>Tetrapturus</b> <b>albidus),</b> a {{concurrent}} electronic tagging and larval sampling effort was conducted {{in the vicinity of}} Mona Passage (off southeast Hispaniola), Dominican Republic, during April and May 2003. Objectives were 1) to characterize the horizontal and vertical movement of adults captured from the area by using pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs); and 2) by means of larval sampling, to investigate whether fish were reproducing. Trolling from a sportfishing vessel yielded eight adult white marlin and one blue marlin (Makaira nigricans); PSAT tags were deployed on all but one of these individuals. The exception was a female white marlin that was unsuitable for tagging because of injury; the reproductive state of its ovaries was examined histologically. Seven of the PSATs reported data summaries for water depth, temperature, and light levels measured every minute for periods ranging from 28 to 40 days. Displacement of marlin from the location of release to the point of tag pop-up ranged from 3 l. 6 to 267. 7 nautical miles (nmi) and a mean displacement was 3. 4 nmi per day for white marlin. White and blue marlin mean daily displacements appeared constrained compared to the results of other marlin PSAT tagging studies. White marlin ovarian sections contained postovulatory follicles and final maturation-stage oocytes, which indicated recent and imminent spawning. Neuston tows (n= 23) yielded 18 istiophorid larvae: eight were white marlin, four were blue marlin, and six could not be identified to species. We speculate that the constrained movement patterns of adults may be linked to reproductive activity for both marlin species, and, if true, these movement patterns may have several implications for management. Protection of the potentially important white marlin spawning ground near Mona Passage seems warranted, at least until further studies can be conducted on the temporal and spatial extent of reproduction and associated adult movement...|$|E

The {{number of families}} ranged from six, in the diet of shelf predators, to 27 families in those from upper slope and adjacent oceanic waters.
