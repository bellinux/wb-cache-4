40|$|Abstract. Collaborative <b>tagging</b> <b>systems</b> (like Flickr, del. icio. us, citeulike, etc.) are {{becoming}} more popular with passage of time. Users share their resources on <b>tagging</b> <b>systems,</b> and add keywords (called tags) to these resources. Users can search resources using these tags. But as the user gives more tags for search, he might not get sufficient search results, because the resources might not be tagged with all the related tags. We introduce the method Triple Play, which smoothes the tag space by user space for improved retrieval of resources. As a part of Triple Play, we also propose two new vector space models for collaborative <b>tagging</b> <b>systems,</b> SmoothVSM Dense and SmoothVSM Sparse. These vector space models exploit the user-tag co-occurrence relationship to overcome the problem of missing information in <b>tagging</b> <b>systems.</b> Finally we apply Latent Semantic Analysis to different vector space models and analyze the results. Initial experimentation show that using additional information available in <b>tagging</b> <b>systems</b> helps in improving search in <b>tagging</b> <b>systems.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Tag</b> <b>systems</b> {{were invented}} by Emil Leon Post and proven recursively {{unsolvable}} by Marvin Minsky. These production systems have shown very useful in constructing small universal (Turing complete) systems for several different classes of computational systems, including Turing machines, {{and are thus}} important instruments for studying limits or boundaries of solvability and unsolvability. Although there are some results on <b>tag</b> <b>systems</b> and their limits of solvability and unsolvability, there are hardly any that consider both the shift number v, {{as well as the}} number of symbols µ. This paper aims to contribute to research on limits of solvability and unsolvability for <b>tag</b> <b>systems,</b> taking into account these two parameters. The main result is the reduction of the 3 n + 1 -problem to a surprisingly small <b>tag</b> <b>system.</b> It indicates that the present unsolvability line – defined in terms of µ and v – for <b>tag</b> <b>systems</b> might be significantly decreased.

There are two main approaches to tackle this and other related questions. One can take on a theoretical approach or else start from a more experimental study {{of the behavior of}} such systems {{with the help of a}} computer. In this paper, the experimental approach is applied to <b>tag</b> <b>systems</b> with a very small program size. After a discussion of some of the main theoretical results on <b>tag</b> <b>systems,</b> several results from a computer-assisted and experimental study on <b>tag</b> <b>systems</b> are analyzed. Special attention is given to the well-known example studied by Post with only 2 symbols and a deletion number v = 3.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has shown that different tagging motivation and user behavior can effect the overall usefulness of social <b>tagging</b> <b>systems</b> for certain tasks. In this paper, we provide further evidence for this observation by demonstrating that tagging data obtained from certain types of users- so-called Categorizers- outperforms data from other users on a social classification task. We show that segmenting users based on their tagging behavior has significant impact on the performance of automated classification of tagged data by using (i) tagging data from two different social <b>tagging</b> <b>systems,</b> (ii) a Support Vector Machine as a classification mechanism and (iii) existing classification systems such as the Library of Congress Classification System as ground truth.
