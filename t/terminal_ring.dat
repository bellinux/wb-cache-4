50|$|Production of spectinabilin occurs {{through a}} type one polyketide synthase, and is {{regulated}} differently in S. spectabilis and Streptomyces orinoci despite being nearly identical gene clusters. The biosynthesis of Spectinabillin initially requires 4 open reading frames (ORF) {{for the production}} of the starter unit, p-nitrobenzoic acid (pNBA) from chorismate. pNBA is then loaded onto the polyketide synthase, and undergoes 6 rounds of elongation and reduction. Briefly, pNBA is loaded onto the PKA and elongated by methyl malonyl-coa (mmCoA), which is then reduced twice to afford the enone. This elongation and subsequent reduction is then repeated three additional times with another unit of mmCoA. The final mmCoA loaded in the sequence is completely reduced to saturation. Malonyl CoA (mCoA) is then loaded, followed by two additional units of mmCoA. Then, the previously loaded mCoA cyclizes with the most recently loaded mmCoA {{as a result of the}} terminal thioesterase(TE) domain to form a 6 membered <b>terminal</b> <b>ring</b> of the spectinabillin intermediate. The alcohol of the ring is then methylated. A furan is then formed via oxidation and subsequent cyclization catalyzed by a Cyt p-450 monoxygenase to afford spectinabillin.|$|E

Both compounds inhibited production of lipid peroxides, astaxanthin being about 2 -fold more effective than β-carotene. The difference in the modes of destruction of the conjugated polyene chain between β-carotene and astaxanthin suggested that the conjugated polyene moiety and <b>terminal</b> <b>ring</b> moieties of the more potent astaxanthin trapped radicals in the membrane and both at the membrane surface and in the membrane, respectively, whereas only the conjugated polyene chain of β-carotene was responsible for radical trapping near the membrane surface and {{in the interior of}} the membrane.

40|$|Excited state ultrafast {{conformational}} reorganization {{is recognized}} as an important phenomenon that facilitates light-induced functions of many molecular systems. This report describes the femtosecond and picosecond conformational relaxation dynamics of middle-ring and <b>terminal</b> <b>ring</b> twisted conformers of the acetylene pi-conjugated system bis(phenylethynyl) benzene, a model system for molecular wires. Through excitation wavelength dependent, femtosecond-transient absorption measurements, {{we found that the}} middle-ring and <b>terminal</b> <b>ring</b> twisted conformers relax at femtosecond (400600 fs) and picosecond (2024 ps) time scales, respectively. Actinic pumping into the red flank of the absorption spectrum leads to excitation of primarily planar conformers, and results in very different excited state dynamics. In addition, ultrafast Raman loss spectroscopic studies revealed the vibrational mode dependent relaxation dynamics for different excitation wavelengths. To corroborate our experimental findings, DFT and time-dependent DFT calculations were carried out. The FranckCondon simulation indicated that the vibronic structure observed in the electronic absorption and the fluorescence spectra are due to progressions and combinations of several vibrational modes corresponding to the phenyl ring and the acetylenic groups. Furthermore, the middle ring torsional rotation matches the room-temperature electronic absorption, {{in stark contrast to the}} <b>terminal</b> <b>ring</b> torsional rotation. Finally, we show that the middle-ring twisted conformer undergoes femtosecond torsional planarization dynamic, whereas the terminal rings relax on a few tens of picosecond time scale...|$|E

40|$|Rhinoviruses are a {{frequent}} {{cause of the}} common cold. A series of antirhinoviral compounds have been developed that bind into a hydrophobic pocket in the viral capsid, stabilizing the capsid and interfering with cell attachment. The structures {{of a variety of}} such compounds, complexed with rhinovirus serotypes 14, 16, 1 A, and 3, previously have been examined. Three chemically similar compounds, closely related to a drug that is undergoing phase III clinical trials, were chosen to determine the structural impact of the heteroatoms in one of the three rings. The compounds were found to have binding modes that depend on their electronic distribution. In the compound with the lowest efficacy, the <b>terminal</b> <b>ring</b> is displaced by 1 Å and rotated by 180 ° relative to the structure of the other two. The greater polarity of the <b>terminal</b> <b>ring</b> in one of the three compounds leads to a small displacement of its position relative to the other compounds in the hydrophobic end of the antiviral compound binding pocket to a site where it makes fewer interactions.
