40|$|The diploma thesis {{attempts}} {{to provide an}} overview of legal regulation in field of <b>trade</b> <b>name</b> and its protection. It focuses especially on relatively complex issues connected with legal nature of the <b>trade</b> <b>name</b> as a subject-matter of legal relationship and nature of entrepreneur's right to it. Only little attention is paid to these problems in scientific literature and the conclusions are not unanimous. That is the reason why I chose this topic for my research. The present text is divided into five parts, namely introduction, three chapters and conclusion. The introduction highlights goals of the thesis, it's structure and research methods that will be used in order to reach the defined ends. Chapter One deals with history of the <b>trade</b> <b>name</b> since {{the second half of the}} 19 th century until the recent regulation came into effect in 2001. The main purpose of this part is to familiarize the reader with inspiring pre-World War II era regulation.

The chapter consists of six subchapters, each of which examines different issues related to <b>trade</b> <b>name.</b> The first subchapter {{attempts to}} define essential traits of the <b>trade</b> <b>name</b> as a legal concept and to find borders between the <b>trade</b> <b>name</b> and other similar [...] ...|$|R

40|$|After the {{identification}} of the slug species, experiments were done in the laboratory and greenhouses to assess the effects of pesticides. The reduction of flower damage (protection of the flower) and the number of killed slugs were observed. In this report greenhouse experiments are described. The slug pellets metaldehyde (<b>trade</b> <b>name</b> Caragoal) and iron-III-phosphate (<b>trade</b> <b>name</b> Ferramol) and the slug parasatic nematodes (<b>trade</b> <b>name</b> Nemaslug) are the most effective ones to control the slug Lehmannia valentiana. The adviced dosages of 25 kg/ha Ferramol and 7 kg/ha Caragoal offer good protection of the flowers. The slug pellets cause almost no killing. Nemaslug® inoculated on the pot offers successful protection of the flowers and decreases the number of living slugs in the pot. The combination of Nemaslug® and Caragoal offers the possibility of slug control. The pesticides methiocarb (<b>trade</b> <b>name</b> Mesurol 500 SC) and methomyl (<b>trade</b> <b>name</b> Akomyl 20 LS) used by a fogging system had no effect on the slugs...|$|R
