500|$|Puzzling {{features}} of the present instrument include the placing of the handle, which when turned is likely to obstruct a player of the keyboard. Ord-Hume, using the 1835 account, concludes that originally the handle (which is a nineteenth-century British replacement, probably of a French original) only operated the grunt and wail, while the organ was operated by pulling a string or cord to work the original bellows, now replaced. The keyboard, which is largely original, is [...] "unique in construction", with [...] "square ivory buttons" [...] with round lathe-turned tops instead of conventional keys. Though the mechanical functioning of each button is [...] "practical and convenient" [...] they are spaced such that [...] "it {{is almost impossible to}} stretch the hand to play an octave". The buttons are marked with small black spots, differently placed but forming no apparent pattern in relation to the notes produced and corresponding to no known system of marking keys. The two stop control knobs for the organ are located, [...] "rather confusingly", a little below the tiger's testicles. The instrument is now rarely played, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>V</b> video of a recent performance.|$|E

Parallel and a little further south there is a scarp which suggests that the 7 metre ditch may have been cut from an earlier and wider ditch that silted up. The evidence suggests that a fortified enclosure existed on the site that was large for a manorial enclosure in the area. Close to a ford in the River Ribble the site is of strategic significance. The fortifications have not been dated. Some moated enclosures around halls in Lancashire served a decorative rather than protective purpose.|$|E

5000|$|The Evans balance {{measures}} susceptibility indirectly {{by referring}} to a calibration standard of known susceptibility. The most convenient compound for this purpose is mercury cobalt thiocyanate, HgCo(NCS)4, which has a susceptibility of 16.44×10−6 (±0.5%) CGS at 20 °C. Another common calibration standard is Ni(en)SO which has a susceptibility of 1.104 x 10−5 erg G−2 cm−3. Three readings of the meter are needed, of an empty tube, R0 of the tube filled with calibrant and of the tube filled with the sample, Rs. Some balances have an auto-tare feature that {{eliminates the need for}} the R0 measurement. Accuracy depends somewhat on homogenous packing of the sample. The first two provide a calibration constant, C. The mass susceptibility in grams is calculated aswhere L is the length of the sample, C is the calibration constant (usually 1 if it has been calibrated), and m is its mass in grams. The reading for the empty tube is needed because the tube glass is diamagnetic. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>V</b> term multiplied by an A term in the most general form of the equation. These two terms (V∗A) are colletively added to the numerator in the above equation. The V term is the volume susceptibility of air (0.029 x 10−6 erg G−2 [...] cm−3) and A is the cross-sectional area of the sample. These two terms can be ignored for solid samples, yielding the original equation written above.|$|E

We show that such safe separators are a very powerful tool for preprocessing graphs when we want to compute their treewidth. We give several sufficient conditions for separators to be safe, allowing such separators, if existing, {{to be found in}} polynomial time.
