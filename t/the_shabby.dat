From Swan Tavern, Jouett rode with General Stevens {{as he made his}} escape, but the wounded Stevens could not ride quickly enough to keep the British from catching up. Fortunately, Jouett had the eccentric habit of dressing in ornate military costume with a scarlet coat and a plumed hat and Stevens was dressed in shoddy clothing. British cavalry assumed that Jouett must be a high military officer, so they ignored <b>the</b> <b>shabby</b> general, and pursued Jouett, who successfully eluded them.|$|E
25|$|During {{the period}} of 5–11 December, the student demonstrators also built a {{temporary}} mausoleum for Thant {{on the grounds of}} the RUSU and gave anti-government speeches. In the early morning hours of 12 December 1974, government troops stormed the campus, killed some of the students guarding the makeshift mausoleum, removed Thant's coffin, and reburied in Kandawmin Garden Mausolea near the Shwedagon Pagoda, where it has continued to lie. Upon hearing of the storming of the Rangoon University campus and the forcible removal of Thant's coffin, many people rioted in the streets of Rangoon. Martial law was declared in Rangoon and the surrounding metropolitan areas. What has come to be known as the U Thant crisis—the student-led protests over <b>the</b> <b>shabby</b> treatment of Thant by the Ne Win government—was crushed by the Burmese government.|$|E
25|$|Columbo's {{wardrobe}} {{was personally}} provided by Peter Falk; {{they were his}} own clothes, including the high-topped shoes and <b>the</b> <b>shabby</b> raincoat, which made its first appearance in Prescription: Murder. Falk would often ad lib his character's idiosyncrasies (fumbling through his pockets {{for a piece of}} evidence and discovering a grocery list, asking to borrow a pencil, becoming distracted by something irrelevant in the room at a dramatic point in a conversation with a suspect, etc.), inserting these into his performance as a way to keep his fellow actors off-balance. He felt it helped to make their confused and impatient reactions to Columbo's antics more genuine. Some of the episodes established that Columbo carried a Colt snub-nosed revolver in his raincoat, which he pulled in rare episodes, and would occasionally remark that his wife, 'the Mrs.', would not allow him to buy a new car because it 'wasn't necessary', portraying the detective throughout the series as permanently driving an aged and battered 1959 Peugeot 403 Cabriolet.|$|E

500|$|Though Jackson {{considered}} the ending [...] "overwrought", {{he felt that}} it [...] "pulled the rug"; [...] "turning on a sixpence, the screams of 'Kathy' turned truly horrifying; the tackiness suddenly real and disturbing". Mellor {{considered the}} ending [...] "a terrific twist {{as long as you}} didn’t look at it too closely", arguing that the interviewer's patience and the crew's collusion were unlikely. However, she suggested, there is little to be gained by criticising these aspects of the episode. For Baylis, the ending was unexpected, revealing [...] "darkness of <b>the</b> <b>shabby</b> human kind". In the closing seconds of the episode, he said, [...] "we suddenly saw it all, without seeing anything".|$|E
500|$|Cousy was well-known, {{both on and}} off the court, for {{his public}} stance against racism, a result of his {{upbringing}} in a multicultural environment. In 1950, the Celtics played a game in the then-segregated city of Charlotte, North Carolina, and teammate Chuck Cooper—the first African-American in NBA history to be drafted—would have been denied a hotel room. Instead of taking the hotel room, Cousy insisted on travelling with Cooper on an uncomfortable overnight train. He described their visit to a segregated men's toilet—Cooper was prohibited from using the clean [...] "for whites" [...] bathroom and had to use <b>the</b> <b>shabby</b> [...] "for colored" [...] facility—as one of the most shameful experiences of his life. He also sympathized with the plight of black Celtics star Bill Russell, who was frequently a victim of racism.|$|E
500|$|Dostoyevsky's Petersburg is {{the city}} of unrelieved poverty; [...] "magnificence {{has no place in}} it, because magnificence is external, formal abstract, cold". Dostoyevsky connects the city's {{problems}} to Raskolnikov's thoughts and subsequent actions. The crowded streets and squares, <b>the</b> <b>shabby</b> houses and taverns, the noise and stench, all are transformed by Dostoyevsky into a rich store of metaphors for states of mind. Donald Fanger asserts that [...] "the real city ... rendered with a striking concreteness, is also a city of the mind in the way that its atmosphere answers Raskolnikov's state and almost symbolizes it. It is crowded, stifling, and parched." [...] The inner turmoil suffered by Raskolnikov can also be perceived as a Shakespearean pathetic fallacy. For example, the great storm in Shakespeare's King Lear reflects the state of the titular character's mind, much like the chaos, disorder and noise of St. Petersburg reflects the state of Raskolnikov's mind.|$|E

500|$|At {{the start}} of the novel, Balzac {{declares}} (in English): [...] "All is true". Although the characters and situations are fictions, the details employed– and their reflection of the realities of life in Paris at the time– faithfully render the world of the Maison Vauquer. The rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève (where the house is located) presents [...] "a grim look about the houses, a suggestion of a jail about those high garden walls". The interiors of the house are painstakingly described, from <b>the</b> <b>shabby</b> sitting room ("Nothing can be more depressing") to the coverings on the walls depicting a feast ("papers that a little suburban tavern would have disdained")– an ironic decoration in a house known for its wretched food. Balzac owed the former detail to the expertise of his friend Hyacinthe de Latouche, who was trained in the practice of hanging wallpaper. The house is even defined by its repulsive smell, unique to the poor boardinghouse.|$|E
500|$|Balzac's {{trademark}} realism {{begins on}} the first page of the novel, wherein Crevel is described wearing a National Guard uniform, complete with the Légion d'honneur. Details from the 1830s also appear in the novel's geographic locations. The Hulot family home, for example, is found in the aristocratic area of Paris known as the Faubourg Saint-Germain. Bette's residence is on {{the opposite end of the}} social spectrum, in the impoverished residential area which surrounded the Louvre: [...] "Les ténèbres, le silence, l'air glacial, la profondeur caverneuse du sol concourent à faire de ces maisons des espèces de cryptes, des tombeaux vivants." [...] ("Darkness, silence, an icy chill, and the cavernous depth of the soil combine to make these houses a kind of crypt, tombs of the living.") Descriptions of her meager quarters are– as usual in Balzac's work– an acute reflection of her personality. The same is true of the Marneffe home at the outset: it contains [...] "les trompeuses apparences de ce faux luxe" [...] ("the illusory appearance of sham luxury"), from <b>the</b> <b>shabby</b> chairs in the drawing-room to the dust-coated bedroom.|$|E
500|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{comes into}} the office, wearing shabby clothing, and walks {{straight}} into manager Nellie Bertram's (Catherine Tate) office and pleads for a job. She eventually caves and makes him janitor for the day. Later, Andy says in a talking head interview that he has actually convinced former CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) to buy Dunder Mifflin from Sabre and then make him the regional manager yet again; Andy is wearing <b>the</b> <b>shabby</b> clothing and making himself smell of alcohol {{in order to make}} everyone believe that he is doing poorly. [...] Andy becomes very dependent on David arriving at the office until Andy calls him to say that he cannot make it until the next Friday. Andy then announces the plan and upon hearing this everyone assumes that Andy's conversations with David are hallucinations because none of them have seen Andy talking with David. However, David surprisingly shows up to the office and assures everyone that he is indeed buying Dunder Mifflin from Sabre with the $20 million that he got from selling a toy-vacuum invention to the United States Military. He also reveals that Jo Bennett is planning on liquidating the rest of Sabre. Upon hearing this news, Sabre CEO Robert California (James Spader) approaches David in an oddly excitable tone, introducing himself as [...] "Bob Kazamakis" [...] and takes him to the conference room to negotiate. Meanwhile, when Andy is reinstated as manager, Nellie begs him by reciting Shakespeare's quality of mercy quote from The Merchant of Venice. Out of pity, Andy gives Nellie a new job as special projects manager. Robert later tells the office that he will be leaving {{for the next three years}} and going to [...] "help" [...] undereducated Eastern European high school gymnasts with matching funds of one million dollars, which he convinces David to donate, disgusting the rest of the office. He then exits the office once and for all by giving Andy a kiss, possibly as a symbol of his power being regained, puts his arm around Andy and says to the office, [...] "It's been a great year." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{striking}} {{depiction of}} Malmö (in the 1930s) {{was made by}} Bo Widerberg in his debut film Kvarteret Korpen (Raven's End) (1963), largely shot in <b>the</b> <b>shabby</b> Korpen working-class district in Malmö. With humour and tenderness it depicts the tensions between classes and generations. [...] The movie was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1965. [...] The 2005 documentary [...] "Utan gränser – en film om idrott och integration" [...] (Without Borders – A Film About Sports and Integration) was filmed by journalist Paul Jackson for the sports club IFK Malmö and was described by Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet as [...] "a documentary on how to succeed with integration" [...] of migrants into Swedish society.

The show starred Hancock as [...] "Anthony Aloysius St John Hancock", living in <b>the</b> <b>shabby</b> [...] "23 Railway Cuttings" [...] in East Cheam. Most episodes portrayed his everyday life as a struggling comedian with aspirations toward straight acting. Some episodes, however, changed this to show him as being a successful actor and/or comedian, or occasionally as having a different career completely, such as a struggling (and incompetent) barrister. Radio episodes were prone to more surreal storylines, {{which would have been}} impractical on television, such as Hancock buying a puppy that grows to be as tall as himself.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the academic year, Yale held its annual [...] "tap-day" [...] custom in which juniors were selected for the school's three senior societies -- Skull and Bones, Scroll and Key, and Wolf's Head. [...] By tradition, the captain of Yale's football team was tapped to join Skull and Bones. [...] However, in May 1905, Shevlin was snubbed by all three societies, resulting in a public furor. [...] After the public snubbing, Shevlin reportedly [...] "left the campus and whirled away in his automobile." [...] One newspaper speculated that Shevlin's automobile was the reason for the snub:"Can it be true that Tom Shevlin, Jr. ... missed being 'tapped' for one of the senior societies merely because he had just become the possessor of a fine, new automobile and was putting on a good deal of style with it? [...] It is true that he was not 'tapped;' equally true that he whirled up to the 'tapping' place in a splendid automobile, but why should the possession of a 40-horse power horseless wagon militate against a student who desires to be 'tapped' and is entitled to the distinction? ... Evidently because he had made himself unpopular and in some way the cause of the unpopularity was the splendid touring car. [...] Other automobiles there are at Yale, but the Minnesota boy had the best machine in the bunch. [...] Envy may {{have had something to do}} with <b>the</b> <b>shabby</b> treatment handed out to young Shevlin."There were also suggestions that it was the reckless manner in which Shevlin drove his car that led to his being snubbed. [...] Shevlin had also drawn attention in 1904 when traveling to England as part of the Harvard-Yale track team; his decision to stay at a different hotel than the team reportedly [...] "cost him considerable of his rather meager popularity." [...] According to another story, Shevlin had placed a $100 bet that he would be tapped by Skull and Bones, and when word of the bet reached the group, they declined to have him.|$|E

Rove writes that before his third {{appearance before the}} grand jury, Robert Luskin went back and looked through all of Rove's saved emails from April through September 2003. Luskin, according to Rove, uncovered an email Rove had written to Steve Hadley in which Rove discussed a conversation he had had with Matt Cooper concerning Wilson's op-ed. Rove writes that while the [...] "email didn't jog any better recollection of the call", he immediately told Fitzgerald, after being sworn in, {{that he wanted to}} [...] "set the record straight." [...] After presenting the email to Fitzgerald, Rove writes that [...] "it was as if I'd detonated a bomb in <b>the</b> <b>shabby</b> little room." [...] Rove writes that before his fourth appearance before the grand jury he received a [...] "target warning" [...] by Fitzgerald. Rove describes his fourth appearance as [...] "brutal from the first moment", and that the grand jury [...] "hung on Fitzgerald's every word." [...] After Rove's testimony, Fitzgerald told Luskin [...] "All things being equal, we are inclined to indict your client." [...] According to Rove, Luskin and Fitzgerald meet for hours in Chicago on October 20 to discuss the matter. At some point during the meeting, [...] "Fitzgerald turned to what was really bothering him: my conversation with Matt Cooper. Was I lying {{about not being able to}} recall my phone conversation with him the morning of July 11, 2003?" [...] Specifically, Rove writes, Fitzgerald wanted to know why [...] "in December 2003 or January 2004 did I ask my aides...to find any evidence of contact with Matt Cooper." [...] It was at this moment, according to Rove, that Luskin revealed his conversation with Viveca Novak in which Luskin learned that Cooper [...] "had insisted around Times Washington bureau that he had talked to [...]" [...] Luskin then revealed to Fitzgerald that it was he who instructed Rove to have his aides find any records of that contact. According to Rove, Fitzgerald was [...] "stunned", and stated to Luskin, [...] "You rocked my world." [...] Rove writes that it [...] "was clear Fitzgerald had originally intended to indict Libby and me on the same day."
