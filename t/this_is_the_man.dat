5|$|Millennium Group member Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) {{travels with}} his wife Catherine (Megan Gallagher) and {{daughter}} Jordan (Brittany Tiplady) to visit Catherine's parents in Arlington County, Virginia. Also present are Catherine's sister Dawn (Barbara Williams and her husband Gil. In Maryland, Henry Dion (Mike Starr) follows a woman home and murders her; he is later visited by a strange man hiding his face behind dark glasses—it becomes apparent that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> who has been sending Black threatening polaroid pictures. Dion thanks the man (Paul Raskin) for finding the victim for him, but is chided for not committing the murder while Black was in the area. Dion takes the corpse into the woods to bury it, all the while speaking to it as though in conversation.|$|E
500|$|Newspaper {{reaction}} to the result was generally along partisan lines. [...] The Cincinnati Commercial Tribune, a Republican paper, stated of Hanna, [...] "And <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> against whom has been waged a war than which political history furnishes none more venomous, vicious, and relentlessly vituperative. It is a disgraceful story, known of all men." [...] The Blade, another Republican paper, agreed, writing, [...] "The fight against Mr. Hanna was the most malignantly traitorous contest ever waged in the political annals of Ohio." [...] The Cincinnati Enquirer, a Silver Democratic paper, argued, [...] "The Republican contingent which stuck to the last against Hanna has made a record which the victorious faction might well envy... Their fight was... against {{the chairman of the}} national committee and all its forces and resources; against the president of the United States, with his tremendous party influence and more influential patronage. Against all this they have cut down the man who a year ago was, next to the president, the leading Republican of the United States, to a pitiful majority of one in his ambition to be elected to the Senate, and that obtained under circumstances not creditable to him. They chased him so hard that he dare not stop to have the gravest charges investigated." [...] Hearst's New York Journal noted, [...] "And so it is to be 'Senator Hanna' for seven years. Well, the senatorship can add nothing to its holder's power for evil. As long as Hanna has his money he can control senatorships, whether he occupies them or not. Perhaps it is best to have him in the open." ...|$|E

Cowles wrote the book to convey her belief that America should enter World War II. She included in it her telling account of claustrophobia at a Nuremberg Rally, and her experience of Hitler's diminishment as he left the stand:”his small figure suddenly became drab and unimpressive.

25|$|Robert Stone (29 January 1749 – June 1820) was an English {{first-class}} cricketer with amateur status.

According to CricketArchive, Stone resurrected his career with two further matches in the 1790 season, but it cannot be said with certainty that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> same <b>man,</b> especially as he seems to have moved from Surrey to Kent.|$|R
