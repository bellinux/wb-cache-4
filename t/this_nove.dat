40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a novel sonoelastographic {{technique}} for estimating local shear velocities from propagating shear wave interference patterns (termed crawling waves) is introduced. A {{relationship between the}} local crawling wave spatial phase derivatives and local shear wave velocity is derived with phase derivatives estimated using an autocorrelation technique. Results from homogeneous phantoms demonstrate the ability of sonoelastographic shear velocity imaging to quantify the true underlying shear velocity distributions as verified using time-of-flight measurements. Heterogeneous phantom results reveal the capacity for lesion detection and shear velocity quantification as validated from mechanical measurements on phantom samples. Experimental results obtained from a prostate specimen illustrated feasibility for shear velocity imaging in tissue. More importantly, high-contrast visualization of focal carcinomas was demonstrated introducing the clinical potential of <b>this</b> <b>nove...</b>|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION High-speed {{commercial}} aircraft require a surface treatment for titanium (Ti) alloy {{that is both}} environmentally safe and durable under the conditions of supersonic flight. A number of pretreatment procedures for Ti alloy requiring multi-stages {{have been developed to}} produce a stable surface. Among the stages are, degreasing, mechanical abrasion, chemical etching, and electrochemical anodizing. These treatments exhibit significant variations in their long-term stability, and the benefits of each step in these processes still remain unclear. In addition, chromium compounds are often used in many chemical treatments and these materials are detrimental to the environment. Recently, a chromium-free surface treatment for Ti alloy has been reported [1], though not designed for high temperature applications. In the present study, a simple surface treatment process developed at NASA/LaRC [2] is reported, offering a high performance surface for a variety of applications. <b>This</b> <b>nove...</b>|$|E

His first match in charge was on 6 February during the 2016 Six Nations Championship against Italy at the Stade de France. Novès bled 6 uncapped players in that match day team, defeating Italy 23-21. A week later, Novès led France {{to their first}} victory over Ireland since August 2011, running out 10-9 victors. Guy Novès' first defeat came on 26 February against Wales, losing 19-10, before going onto lose to Scotland, 29-18, {{for the first time}} since 2006. In the final match of the Championship, England had already secured the title, a win for France would only stop the grand slam. However, in a match that France failed to score any tries, England were the victors 31-21. In June 2016, France toured Argentina for a two-test series. Unfortunately for Novès, due to the 2015 Rugby World Cup, Top 14 organizers did not schedule any games during the pool phase of the tournament, which meant it will end at a later date than normal. Therefore, the semi-finals and final of the 2015-16 season will concede with the June international window, clashing with the French games on the 19 and 25 June. Due to <b>this,</b> <b>Novès</b> named 12 uncapped players in his touring squad, and 7 players who had played less than 10 tests for their country. The first test was lost 30-19, in a match that had 10 new players capped for the first time. However, a week later, France defeated Argentina 27-0, the first time Argentina has failed to score any points in a test match since they lost 16-0 against Ireland in 2007. It is the first time they have failed to score any points against France since their first ever meeting in 1949. During the 2016 end of year tests, Novès led France to a sole victory, beating Samoa 52-8 in the opening week of their November series. The following two tests saw France lose narrowly to Australia 25-23 and New Zealand 24-19.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} a two-way relaying system with two sources A, B and one relay R, {{where the two}} sources desire to exchange information through the relay. The transmission consists of two states: multiple access (MAC) stage, where A and B transmit the channel-coded signals to R simultaneously, and broadcast (BC) stage, where R transmits towards both A and B. One critical process at R is to decode the superimposed signal from A and B {{in such a way}} that A and B could decode the information from each other reliably at the BC stage. Instead of decoding the individual information belonging to A and B separately, R aims to decode the superimposed signal to the network-coded combination of the two source information, i. e., the binary XOR of the two source information. We refer this decoding process as the joint channel decoding and physical network encoding (JCNC). In <b>this</b> paper, a <b>nove...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} concept of a Morphing Upper Torso, an inno-vative pressure suit design that incorporates robotic elements to enable a resizable, highly mobile and easy to don/doff spacesuit. The torso is modeled as a system of interconnected, pressure-constrained, reduced-DOF, wire-actuated parallel ma-nipulators, that enable the dimensions of the suit to be reconfigured to match the wearer. The kinematics, dynamics and control of wire-actuated manipulators are de-rived and simulated, along with the Jacobian transforms, which relate the total twist vector of the system to the vector of actuator velocities. Tools are developed that allow calculation of the workspace for both single and interconnected reduced-DOF robots of this type, using knowledge of the link lengths. The forward kinematics and statics equations are combined and solved to produce the pose of the platforms along with the link tensions. These tools allow analysis of the full Morphing Upper Torso design, in which the back hatch of a rear-entry torso is interconnected with the waist ring, helmet ring and two scye bearings.

40|$|Collective motion {{phenomena}} in {{large groups of}} social organisms have long fascinated the observer, especially in cases, such as bird flocks or fish schools, where large-scale highly coordinated actions emerge {{in the absence of}} obvious leaders. However, the mechanisms involved in this self-organized behavior are still poorly understood, because the individual-level interactions underlying them remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate the power of a bottom-up methodology to build models for animal group motion from data gathered at the individual scale. Using video tracks of fish shoal in a tank, we show how a careful, incremental analysis at the local scale allows for the determination of the stimulus/response function governing an individual’s moving decisions. We find in particular that both positional and orientational effects are present, act upon the fish turning speed, and depend on the swimming speed, yielding a novel schooling model whose parameters are all estimated from data. Our approach also leads to identify a density-dependent effect that results in a behavioral change for the largest groups considered. This suggests that, in confined environment, the behavioral state of fish and their reaction patterns change with group size. We debate the applicability, beyond the particular case studied here, of <b>this</b> <b>nove...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Purpose: Despite recent improvements, {{resistance}} to traditional immunotherapy or chemotherapy is still common {{in patients with}} bladder cancer. We constructed an oncolytic virus from herpes simplex virus type II (HSV- 2), which selectively targets tumor cells with an activated Ras signaling pathway. We evaluated the antitumor effect of this oncolytic HSV- 2 (FusOn-H 2) against bladder cancer, and {{compared with that of}} a first generation oncolytic virus derived from HSV- 1 (Baco- 1). Materials and methods: We established bladder tumor at the orthotopic site in C 3 H/He mice using the MBT- 2 cells. Baco- 1 or FusOn-H 2 was instilled into the bladder through the urethra respectively. Tumor volume and weight were recorded {{by the end of the}} experiment. Animal spleens were also collected to determine if any anti-tumor immunity was elicited during virotherapy in this syngeneic bladder cancer model. Results: Two instillations of the oncolytic HSVs into bladder of tumor-bearing mice almost completely eradicated the tumor in majority of tumor bearing mice. The results of tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity assay showed that tumor destruction by oncolytic viruses in vivo, especially by the FusOn-H 2, induced potent anti-tumor immune responses. Conclusion: Oncolytic virus derived from HSV- 2 has potent anti-tumor activity against bladder cancer. Oncolytic effect of this virus in vivo induces tumor specific cellular immunity that further enhances the overall anti-tumor activity. Translating <b>this</b> <b>nove...</b>|$|E

40|$|This master thesis {{describes}} a supervised approach to recognize human actions in video sequences. With human action {{we can understand}} human action classification and human action localization. In human action classification, {{the goal is to}} issue an action class label to sequences with pre-defined temporal extent. In human action localization, the objective is to localize human actions in space (the 2 D image region) and in time (temporal extent). In this thesis, we are interested in action classification and localization tasks. The type of video data used are controlled and uncontrolled (realistic) video sequences. In realistic type of video data, human action recognition is especially difficult due to variations in motion, view-point, illumination, camera ego-motion, and partial occlusion of humans. In addition to that, action classes are subject to large intra-class variabilities due to the anthropometric differences across humans. In the case of action localization, the search is computationally expensive due to the large volume of video data. Recently, global representations have shown impressive results for action localization in realistic videos. Nevertheless, these representations have not been applied to repetitive actions, such as running, walking etc. In fact, they even seem not appropriate for this type of actions.

40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) {{caused by}} Mycobacterium {{tuberculosis}} (Mtb) {{is one of}} the leading infectious disease causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Though current antibiotic regimens can cure the disease, treatment requires at least six months of drug therapy. One reason for the long duration of therapy is that the currently available TB drugs were selected for their ability to kill replicating organisms and are less effective against subpopulations of non-replicating persistent bacilli. Evidence from in vitro models of Mtb growth and mouse infection studies suggests that host immunity may provide some of the environmental cues that drive Mtb towards non-replicating persistence. We hypothesized that selective modulation of the host immune response to modify the environmental pressure on the bacilli may result in better bacterial clearance during TB treatment. For this proof of principal study, we compared bacillary clearance from the lungs of Mtb-infected mice treated with the anti-TB drug isoniazid (INH) in the presence and absence of an immunomodulatory phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor (PDE 4 i), CC- 3052. The effects of CC- 3052 on host global gene expression, induction of cytokines, and T cell activation in the lungs of infected mice were evaluated. We show that CC- 3052 modulates the innate immune response without causing generalized immune suppression. Immune modulation combined with INH treatment improved bacillary clearance and resulted in smaller granulomas and less lung pathology, compared to treatment with INH alone. <b>This</b> <b>nove...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: Exposure {{to traffic}} is an {{established}} {{risk factor for}} the triggering of myocardial infarction (MI). Particulate matter, mainly emitted by diesel vehicles, {{appears to be the}} most important stressor. However, the possible influence of benzene from gasoline-fueled cars has not been explored so far. Methods and Results: We conducted a case-crossover study from 2, 134 MI cases recorded by the local Coronary Heart Disease Registry (2000 – 2007) in the Strasbourg Metropolitan Area (France). Available individual data were age, gender, previous history of ischemic heart disease and address of residence at the time of the event. Nitrogen dioxide, particles of median aerodynamic diameter, 10 mm (PM 10), ozone, carbon monoxide and benzene air concentrations were modeled on an hourly basis at the census block level over the study period using the deterministic ADMS-Urban air dispersion model. Model input data were emissions inventories, background pollution measurements, and meteorological data. We have found a positive, statistically significant association between concentrations of benzene and the onset of MI: per cent increase in risk for a 1 mg/m 3 increase in benzene concentration in the previous 0, 0 – 1 and 1 day was 10. 4 (95 % confidence interval 3 – 18. 2), 10. 7 (2. 7 – 19. 2) and 7. 2 (0. 3 – 14. 5), respectively. The associations between the other pollutants and outcome were much lower and in accordance with the literature.

The purpose of current {{study was to determine}} the role of T cells and IFN-c in retina dysfunction and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death using this model. RGC function was measured by pattern electroretinograms (ERGs) in response to contrast reversal of patterned visual stimuli. RGCs were visualized by fluorogold retrograde-labeling. Expression of CD 3, IFN-c, GFAP, and caspases was measured by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting. All functional and structural changes were measured in 12 -month-old h 3 T-A 2 mice and compared with age-matched HLA-A 2 wild-type mice. Both pattern-ERGs (42 %, p = 0. 03) and RGC numbers (37 %, p = 0. 0001) were reduced in h 3 T-A 2 mice when compared with wild-type mice. The level of CD 3 expression was increased in h 3 T-A 2 mice (h 3 T-A 2 : 174627 % vs. HLA-A 2 : 100 %; p = 0. 04). The levels of effector cytokine IFN-c were also increased significantly in h 3 T-A 2 mice (h 3 T-A 2 : 189611 % vs. HLA-A 2 : 100 %; p = 0. 023). Both CD 3 and IFN-c immunostaining were increased in nerve fiber (NF) and RGC layers of h 3 T-A 2 mice. In addition, we have seen a robust increase in GFAP staining in h 3 T-A 2 mice (mainly localized to NF layer), which was substantially reduced in IFN-c (-/-) knockout h 3 T-A 2 mice. We also have seen an up-regulation of caspase- 3 and- 9 in h 3 T-A 2 mice. Based on our data we conclude that h 3 T-A 2 transgenic mice exhibit visual defects that are mostly associated with the inner retinal layers and RGC function. <b>This</b> <b>nove...</b>|$|E

Pretende-se mostrar os traços que marcaram as diferentes etapas do desenvolvimento do gênero e que ainda se mantêm no romance contemporâneo. Para tanto buscou-se entender a arquinarrativa da escritura do corpus analisado e decifrar de que tipo de enigma se trata e que problemática enfrentam suas personagens. Todas estas questões se colocam previamente como fundamento para a hipótese do trabalho que é a análise ecogênica da escritura do texto. A pesquisa do processo de produção da escritura leva em conta os artifícios usados por Bernardo Carvalho, que tomamos como artifício de propagação de eco, como artifícios amplificadores. Artifícios esses que entendemos funcionar como um sistema espelhado repetindo a mesma função. Outro assunto abordado nesta pesquisa é o papel e a posição das vozes, sua interação. Ressaltamos o fato de que os artifícios usados pelo autor seguem todos a mesma diretriz, o mesmo objetivo e que embora já tenham sido usados em separado, anteriormente, eles representam a {{literatura}} egótica contemporânea. Para dar suporte conceitual ao núcleo teórico-crítico deste estudo fundamentamo-nos em: Mikhail Bakhtin, Clement Rosset, Otto Rank, Lucien Dallenbach, Tzvetan Todorov, Michel de Certeau e Merleau Ponty, dentre outros. No desenvolvimento dos três capítulos colocamos as teorias e os temas propostos em diálogo com o romance de Bernardo Carvalho que analisamos, e demonstramos como a duplicação, a exotopia e o mise en abyme (artifícios ecogênicos) se propagam pela voz e pela palavra por toda escritura, desenhando uma imagem realista neste romance contemporâneoThis {{academic research}} {{clings to the}} analysis of the novel O Sol Se Põe Em São Paulo, by Bernardo Carvalho as a representative sample of the Brazilian contemporary novel. In this paper we intend to show the features that define the different phases of the genre and the features which are still being used in the contemporary novel. For that we tried to understand the architectural-narrative of the corpus s text, decode what kind of conundrum the novel deals with and what kind of issues have the characters faced. All these issues are previously established as a basis to a hypothesis namely, the echogenic analysis of the text. We studied the process of the text production taking into consideration the wiles used by Bernardo Carvalho and that he took as stratagem to echo reflection, as an art craft amplifier. We acknowledge that these art crafts work as a mirrored system repeating the same function. Another subject analyzed in this paper is the role and the function of the voices, its interaction. We tried to pinpoint the fact that all the wiles used by the author follow the same stratagem, the same objective and that although these wiles had being used before, separately, they represent the idea that contemporary literature speaks of: that is an egotic literature. To sustain the critical-theorical foundation upon which this thesis is structured we chose some authors: Mikhail Bakhtin, Clement Rosset, Otto Rank, Lucien Dallenbach, Tzvetan Todorov, Michel de Certeau, and Merleau Ponty, among others. Along these three chapters we developed a cohesive text in which we could put up with the proposed theories and themes in accordance with the Bernardo Carvalho`s novel we analized.

40|$|The aminocoumarin {{antibiotics}} novobiocin, clorobiocin and coumermycin A 1 {{are produced}} in different Streptomyces strains and are potent inhibitors of DNA gyrase. Cloning and sequencing of the corresponding biosynthetic gene clusters allowed detailed investigations of their biosynthetic pathways {{as well as}} the generation of novel antibiotics by metabolic engineering, chemo-enzymatic synthesis and precursor-directed biosynthesis. On the other hand, only limited knowledge is available about the regulation of the biosynthesis of the aminocoumarin antibiotics. The biosynthetic gene cluster of novobiocin, clorobiocin and coumermycin A 1 each contains two putative regulatory genes with high similarity in between the clusters, i. e. novG/cloG/couG and novE/cloE/couE. The function of NovG as a DNA binding protein and positive regulator of novobiocin biosynthesis has been established previously. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, functional proof for the role of novE as a positive regulator of novobiocin biosynthesis is provided. Overexpression of novE, using a replicative shuttle vector in S. coelicolor strains carrying the intact novobiocin cluster has been shown to lead to almost two-fold overproduction of novobiocin, suggesting that novobiocin production is limited by the availability of NovE protein. In contrast, a novE-defective mutant, generated by an in-frame deletion in this study, produced only 0. 7 % of the novobiocin amount formed by an S. coelicolor strain harboring the intact novobiocin cluster. Novobiocin production in <b>this</b> Delta <b>novE</b> mutant could be restored by introduction of an intact copy of novE, but also by overexpression of the regulatory gene novG. NovE was expressed in E. coli and purified. However, in contrast to NovG, no DNA binding properties could be shown for NovE. The following RT-PCR experiments showed that at least some novG transcription can occur in the absence of NovE, and that novE transcription can occur in the absence of NovG. Correspondingly, overexpression of novG under control of its own promoter stimulated novobiocin production even in a novE-defective mutant. Another part of this thesis focuses on the determination of promoter regions within the novobiocin biosynthetic gene cluster. For this purpose Omega interposons, i. e. DNA fragments containing an antibiotic resistance marker flanked by short inverted repeats containing termination signals for transcription, were introduced into genes downstream of putative promoter regions, i. e. into novE, novF, novG, novH, novO, novP, novQ and novS, resulting in termination of mRNA synthesis at the place of insertion. Transcription is re-initiated at the next active promoter-sequence downstream of the Omega insertion. RT-PCR analysis of the generated mutants showed that the novobiocin biosynthetic gene cluster contains, in addition to previously identified promoter regions upstream of novE and gyrBR, six further promoter regions situated upstream of novF, novG, novH, novO, novP and novQ. In order to confirm the importance of the promoter regions identified upstream of novO, novP and novQ, quantitative RT-PCR experiments were carried out to quantify transcription of novH, novP and novQ in the Omega novH mutant in comparison to S. coelicolor strains containing the intact novobiocin cluster. The results of these investigations clearly showed that the Omega insertion into novH resulted not only in an almost complete loss of novH transcription ( 18. 000 nt, resulting in a two-fold overproduction of novobiocin in comparison to strains containing the unmodified novobiocin gene cluster. Therefore, regulation of novobiocin production by tcp 830 has been confirmed as a strategy to uncouple novobiocin production from its natural regulation and notably as a further, newly discovered tool to enhance antibiotic production. Die Aminocoumarin-Antibiotika Novobiocin, Clorobiocin und Coumermycin A 1 werden von unterschiedlichen Streptomyces-Stämmen gebildet und sind potente Gyrasehemmstoffe. Klonierung und Sequenzierung der Biosynthesegencluster dieser Antibiotika ermöglichten detaillierte Untersuchungen der Biosynthesewege und die Herstellung neuer Antibiotika durch metabolisches Engineering, chemo-enzymatische Synthese und Vorstufen-gerichtete Biosynthese. Das Wissen über die Regulation der Aminocoumarin-Biosynthese ist jedoch begrenzt. Die Biosynthese-Gencluster von Novobiocin, Clorobiocin und Coumermycin A 1 enthalten jeweils zwei putative Regulatorgene, novG/cloG/couG und novE/cloE/couE, mit starker Ähnlichkeit zwischen diesen Clustern. Die Funktion von NovG als DNA-bindendes Protein und positiver Regulator in der Novobiocinproduktion wurde bereits vor Beginn dieser Arbeit nachgewiesen. Im ersten Teil dieser Arbeit wurde der Funktionsnachweis für novE als positiver Regulator der Novobiocinproduktion erbracht. Die Überexpression von novE mit Hilfe eines replikativen Shuttle-Vektors in Streptomyces coelicolor-Stämmen mit intaktem Novobiocin-Biosynthesegencluster führte zu einer nahezu zweifachen Überproduktion von Novobiocin, was darauf hindeutet, dass die Novobiocinproduktion durch die Verfügbarkeit von NovE-Protein begrenzt wird. Im Gegensatz dazu produzierte die in dieser Arbeit durch „in-frame“ Deletion hergestellte novE-Defektmutante lediglich 0. 7 % der Novobiocinmenge, die von Streptomyces coelicolor Stämmen mit intaktem Novobiocincluster produziert wird. Die Novobiocinproduktion in dieser novE-Defektmutante konnte nicht nur durch das Einbringen einer intakten Kopie von novE, sondern auch durch Überexpression von novG wiederhergestellt werden. NovE wurde in Escherichia coli exprimiert und aufgereinigt. Im Gegensatz zu Experimenten mit NovG konnte für NovE jedoch keine DNA-bindende Eigenschaft nachgewiesen werden. Die folgenden RT-PCR Untersuchungen zeigten, dass zumindestens etwas novG-Transkription in Abwesenheit von NovE, und novE-Transkription in Abwesenheit von NovG stattfindet. In Übereinstimmung damit stimulierte die Überexpression von novG unter Kontrolle des eigenen Promotors die Novobiocinproduktion auch in der novE-Defektmutante. Der folgende Teil dieser Arbeit zielte auf die Identifizierung der Promotorregionen innerhalb des Novobiocin-Biosynthesegenclusters. Zu diesem Zweck wurden Omega Interposons, das heißt DNA-Fragmente, die einen Antibiotika-Resistenzmarker beidseitig flankiert durch Sequenzen, die Terminationssignale für die Transkription beinhalten, in Gene downstream von putativen Promotorregionen eingebracht, das heißt in novE, novF, novG, novH, novO, novP, novQ und novS. Dies führte zu einer Termination der mRNA-Synthese. Die Wiederaufnahme der Transkription erfolgt von der nächsten aktiven Promotor-Sequenz downstream der Omega-Insertion. RT-PCR Untersuchungen der generierten Mutanten zeigten, dass im Novobiocin-Biosynthesegencluster, zusätzlich zu den bereits identifizierten Promotorregionen upstream von novE und gyrBR, sechs weitere Promotorregionen enthalten sind, die sich upstream von novF, novG, novH, novO, novP und novQ befinden. Zur Bestätigung der Rolle der Promotorregionen upstream von novO, novP und novQ, wurden quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) Experimente durchgeführt um die Transkription von novH, novP und novQ in der Omega novH-Mutanten im Vergleich zu Streptomyces coelicolor-Stämmen mit intaktem Novobiocincluster zu quantifizieren. Die Ergebnisse dieser Untersuchungen zeigten eindeutig, dass die Omega-Insertion in novH nicht nur zu einem nahezu vollständigen Ausfall der novH-Transkription (< 1 %), sondern auch zu einer sehr starken Reduktion der Transkription von novP und novQ (< 3 %) führt. Diese Ergebnisse machen wahrscheinlich, dass die Transkription von novO, novP und novQ sowie der downstream davon liegenden Gene hauptsächlich über den novH-Promotor kontrolliert wird, von dem ein mindestens 18 kb großes Transkript, das heißt von novH bis novW, gebildet wird. Außerdem wurde mittels qRT-PCR das Zusammenspiel der beiden positiven Regulatoren novE und novG, sowie deren Einfluss auf die Novobiocin-Biosynthesegene untersucht. In diesen Untersuchungen wurden novE und novG als Transkriptionsaktivatoren der Novobiocinproduktion bestätigt, welche in einer Regulationskaskade die Transkription vom novH-Promotor aus initiieren. Offenbar aktiviert novE die Transkription von novG und NovG reguliert über den novH-Promotor die Transkription aller Gene durch Bindung an eine definierte Sequenz im intergenischen Bereich zwischen novG und novH. Basierend auf den oben präsentierten Ergebnissen beschäftigte sich der letzte Teil dieser Arbeit mit der Entkopplung der Novobiocinproduktion von deren natürlichem Regelkreis durch Austausch der gesamten novEFG-Region, einschließlich der Promotorregion upstream von novH, gegen einen starken Promotor. Hierzu wurde der Tetracyclin-induzierbare Promotor 830 (tcp 830) verwendet, für den mit den Luciferase-kodierenden Genen luxAB als Reporter-System Induktionsfaktoren von bis zu 270 beschrieben wurden. Die HPLC-Analyse der Novobiocinproduktion in den generierten Mutanten zeigte, dass der tcp 830 -Promotor erfolgreich eingesetzt werden kann, um eine 18 kb umfassende Region von novH bis novW zu transkribieren, was zu einer zweifachen Überproduktion von Novobiocin führte. Die Regulation der Novobiocinproduktion über tcp 830 wurde dadurch nicht nur als eine Strategie zur Entkopplung der Novobiocinproduktion von deren natürlichem Regulationskreis, sondern auch als ein weiteres, neue entdecktes Werkzeug zur Erhöhung der Antibiotikaproduktion bestätigt...|$|R
40|$|Literature is an {{important}} component of a total language art. From Literature, readers can meet some different characters and different traditions. Readers can improve their skills because the discussions of literature bring out reasoning related to sequence; cause and effect; character motivation; predictions; visualization of actions, characters, and settings; critical analysis of the story; and creative responses. The writer chooses literature as an interesting topic for her study because she knows that literature is a part of real life that is showed by words. The writer can learn to face the problem in her real life from reading literature. This thesis focuses on the internal conflict of the main character in the novel. The internal conflict from this novel is about Lizzy’s decisions to marry a man because of love not because of his wealth. Yet, Lizzy realizes that she needs money to support her future life and her mother forces her to marry a man who becomes the heirs of her estate. This thesis is a qualitative study in the form of descriptive analysis. The analysis theory is based on the Abrams’ theory. Objective theory according to Abrams believes that there is no influence of the reader for the work itself. From this theory, there is no chance from the people who do not know the nature of the author to have an agreement. The objective theory forces the observer to see the work itself that is by analyzing the intrinsic elements in the work itself. The intrinsic elements of novels are setting, characters, plot, and theme. Lizzy does not want to marry Mr. Collins because she does not love him. There are three suggestions, for the readers of the novel, for teaching literature, and for further study. The writer expects that the readers of the novel can understand more about internal conflict. The writer gives suggestion for teaching literature {{that it would be better}} if the lecturer gives the students direction to analyze intrinsic elements not only looking for the climax and the conclusion of the story. The last, the writer suggests for the further study to analyze external conflict and the society in <b>this</b> <b>nove...</b>|$|E
