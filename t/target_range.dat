5|$|The Parallax Correctors {{were needed}} because the turrets were located {{hundreds}} of feet from the director. There was one for each turret, and each had the turret/director distance manually set in. They automatically received Relative Target Bearing (bearing from own ship's bow), and <b>Target</b> <b>Range.</b> They corrected the bearing order for each turret so that all rounds fired in a salvo converged on the same point.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{collimated}} image {{produced by}} the sight is only truly parallax free at infinity, the sight has an error circle equal to {{the diameter of the}} collimating optics for any target at a finite distance. Depending on the eye position behind the sight and the closeness of the target this induces some aiming error. For larger targets at a distance (given the non-magnifying, quick target acquisitions nature of the sight) this aiming error is considered trivial. On small arms aimed at close targets this is compensated for by keeping the reticle {{in the middle of the}} optical window (sighting down its optical axis). Some manufacturers of small arms sights also make models with the optical collimator set at a finite distance. This gives the sight parallax due to eye movement the size of the optical window at close range which diminishes to a minimal size at the set distance (somewhere around a desired <b>target</b> <b>range</b> of 25-50 yards).|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we examine how <b>target</b> <b>ranges</b> {{work in the}} context of a Barro-Gordon (1983) type model, in which the time-inconsistency problem stems from {{political}} pressures from the government. We show that <b>target</b> <b>ranges</b> turn out to be an excellent way to cope with the time-inconsistency problem, and achieve many of the benefits that arise under practically less attractive solutions such as the conservative central banker and optimal inflation contracts. Our theoretical model also shows how an inflation <b>targeting</b> <b>range</b> should be set and how it should respond to changes in the nature of shocks to the economy. ...|$|R
5|$|As {{proposed}} by the Admiralty, Moore's plans for the new attack on Kaafjord involved the Home Fleet's aircraft attacking the region over several days. While the fighter aircraft involved in the previous raids had used only their machine guns to strafe German defences {{in order to reduce}} the threat they posed to the Barracudas, it was decided to use some of these aircraft as dive bombers during Operation Goodwood. In preparation, the two squadrons of Corsairs and single squadron of Grumman F6F Hellcats selected to participate in the attack received training in dive-bombing tactics during the period between Operations Mascot and Goodwood. Another new element of the plans was a decision to use Fleet Air Arm aircraft to drop mines near Tirpitz and the entrance to Kaafjord. The mines dropped near the battleship were to be fitted with time-delay fuses, and it was hoped that the explosions of these devices would cause Tirpitzs captain to try to move the warship into safer waters and pass through the minefield at the fjord's entrance. During the period before Operation Goodwood, the Home Fleet's flying squadrons conducted training exercises using a <b>target</b> <b>range</b> at Loch Eriboll in northern Scotland; the terrain in this area is comparable to that around Kaafjord, and the loch had also been used for this purpose as part of the preparations for Operation Tungsten.|$|E

25|$|The {{reference}} range for prothrombin time {{depends on the}} analytical method used, but is usually around 12–13 seconds (results should always be interpreted using the {{reference range}} from the laboratory that performed the test), and the INR in absence of anticoagulation therapy is 0.8-1.2. The <b>target</b> <b>range</b> for INR in anticoagulant use (e.g. warfarin) is 2 to 3. In some cases, if more intense anticoagulation {{is thought to be}} required, the <b>target</b> <b>range</b> may be as high as 2.5-3.5 depending on the indication for anticoagulation.

25|$|Under {{inflation}} targeting, {{open market}} operations target a specific short-term interest rate in the debt markets.

The Secretary of War granted the state a revocable license for the camp, which was accepted by Governor Thomas C. McRae on December 22, 1922. The camp {{was turned over to}} the Camp Pike Honorary Commission which liquidated surplus Federal government property left at the Camp, raising approximately $250,000. These funds were utilized to new buildings and to provide for maintenance and up keep of the facilities. The commission also built a water tank and established a <b>target</b> <b>range</b> with funds from the sale. The Camp would eventually be renamed in honor of Arkansas Senator Joseph T. Robinson.|$|E
40|$|A {{wideband}} imaging architecture {{based on}} subbanding and Doppler filter bank using FFT is developed and its performance is analyzed in detail. The theoretical analysis shows that owing to Doppler dispersion, the <b>target’s</b> <b>range</b> profile will produce distortion {{with the increase}} in target velocity. The distortion includes range shift and amplitude deformation. At the same time, two related theoretical formulas are deduced for the calculation of the range shift value and evaluation of the amplitude deformation extent of a moving <b>target's</b> <b>range</b> profile formed by the proposed imaging architecture and thereby the maximum critical velocity is derived. When target velocity is less than the maximum critical velocity, a moving <b>target’s</b> <b>range</b> profile with acceptable distortion can be obtained.

Eighteen rebels captured in the Civil Hospital were immediately executed in the Moncada small-arms <b>target</b> <b>range</b> within two hours after the attack.

A handful of rebels, including Fidel Castro, escaped into the nearby countryside but were apprehended shortly thereafter.|$|E
25|$|In August 1996, Banco de México {{initiated}} {{a mechanism to}} acquire foreign reserves when the peso is strong, without giving the market signals about a <b>target</b> <b>range</b> for the exchange rate. The resulting high levels of reserves, mostly from petroleum revenues, have helped to improve the terms and conditions on debt Mexico places on foreign markets. However, there is concern that the government relies too heavily on oil income {{in order to build}} a healthy base of reserves. According to the central bank, international reserves stood at US $75.8billion in 2007. In May 2003, Banco de México launched a program that sells U.S. dollars via a monthly auction, with the goal of maintaining a stable, but moderate, level of reserves.|$|E
25|$|Beatty did {{not take}} {{advantage}} of the time available to him between sighting the enemy and the start of fighting to position his battlecruisers to most effectively attack the enemy. At the point the German ships opened fire with accurately determined ranges for their guns, Beatty's ships were still manoeuvring, some could not see the enemy because of their own smoke, and hardly any had the opportunity of a period of steady course as they approached to properly determine <b>target</b> <b>range.</b> As a result, the German ships had a significant advantage in early hits, with obvious benefit. During this time he also lost the potential advantage of the larger guns on his ships: they could commence firing at a longer range than the German ships.|$|E

25|$|Guidance is {{performed}} by the target tracking radar, it constantly relays <b>target</b> <b>range,</b> elevation and bearing to the fire-control computer, and {{on the basis of}} this data the computer generates the laying commands for the guns or the trajectory corrections for the missiles. A back-up tracking method can be used by the gunner, who uses the 8× magnification (8 degree field of view) 1A29 stabilized sight of the Tunguska to track the target in elevation and azimuth, the altitude or range of the target being set manually. The gunner is initially cued towards the target by the system's search radar. Once the missile is steered to within 5 m of the target, an active laser or radio fuse (9M311-M1) is triggered. A contact fuse is also fitted. The warhead weighs about 9kg, and is a continuous-rod system, consisting of 600mm long, 6 to 9mm diameter rods with a flower-like cross section. The cross section ensures the rods break into fragments weighing 2–3grams. The rods form a complete ring about 5 m from the missile. Outside the rods is a fragmentation layer of steel cubes weighing 2–3grams. The 9K22 is reported to have a kill probability of 0.6 with missiles (9M311).|$|E
