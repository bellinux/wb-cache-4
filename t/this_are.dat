Amongst the series of explanatory pamphlets doing <b>this</b> <b>are</b> An Explanation of a Late Pamphlet, Entituled, The Shortest Way… (1703) and A Dialogue Between a Dissenter and the Observator (1703).

5|$|Fossil {{sperm whales}} differ from modern sperm whales in tooth count {{and the shape}} of the face and jaws. For example, Scaldicetus had a tapered rostrum.

Acrophyseter, from the late Miocene, also had teeth in both the upper and lower jaws as well as a short rostrum and an upward curving mandible (lower jaw). These anatomical differences suggest that fossil species may not have necessarily been deep-sea squid eaters like the modern sperm whale, but that some genera mainly ate fish. Zygophyseter, dated from the middle to late Miocene and found in southern Italy, had teeth in both jaws and appears to have been adapted to feed on large prey, rather like the modern Orca (Killer Whale).
