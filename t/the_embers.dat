5|$|This species {{lives in}} many habitats, {{including}} deserts, forests, woodland and urban areas. They nest underground below logs, stones, twigs, and shrubs, or in decayed wooden stumps, and are sometimes found living in termite mounds. They {{are among the}} first insects {{to be found in}} burnt-off areas after <b>the</b> <b>embers</b> have stopped smouldering. Rain presents no threat to colonies {{as long as it is}} a light shower in continuous sunshine. The green-head ant is diurnal, active throughout the day, preying on arthropods and small insects or collecting sweet substances such as honeydew from sap-sucking insects. They play an important role in seed dispersal, scattering and consuming seeds from a variety of species. Predators include the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) and a number of bird species.|$|E
5|$|According to legend, Sherwood's sons put {{her body}} near the fireplace, and a wind {{came down the}} chimney. Her body {{disappeared}} amid <b>the</b> <b>embers,</b> with the only clue being a cloven hoofprint. Sherwood lies in an unmarked grave under some trees in a field near the intersection of Pungo Ferry Road and Princess Anne Road in Virginia Beach. Stories about the Devil taking her body, unnatural storms, and loitering black cats quickly arose after her death, and local men killed every feline they could find; this widespread killing of cats might have caused the infestation of rats and mice recorded in Princess Anne County in 1743. Her home on Muddy Creek stood for over 200 years. After being burned {{several times in the}} 20th century by vandals, all that was left in 2002 were the brick chimneys, which were bulldozed in November 2002. All that remains are a few bricks and part of the foundation, which is overgrown. The property is now owned by the Federal Government as part of Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ember</b> days {{began on}} the Wednesday {{immediately}} following those days. This meant, for instance, that if September 14 were a Tuesday, <b>the</b> <b>ember</b> days would occur on September 15, 17, and 18. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>ember</b> days in September could fall after either {{the second or third}} Sunday in September. This, however, was always the liturgical Third Week of September, since the First Sunday of September was the Sunday closest to September 1 (August 29 to September 4). As a simplification of the liturgical calendar, Pope John XXIII modified this so that the Third Sunday was the third Sunday actually within the calendar month. Thus if September 14 were a Sunday, September 24, 26 and 27 would be <b>ember</b> days, <b>the</b> latest dates possible; with September 14 as a Saturday, however, <b>the</b> <b>ember</b> days would occur on September 18, 20 and 21 - the earliest possible dates.|$|R

25|$|Another account {{involves}} a 9th-century Ethiopian goat-herder, Kaldi, who, noticing the energizing effects when his flock nibbled {{on the bright}} red berries of a certain bush, chewed on the fruit himself. His exhilaration prompted him to bring the berries to a monk in a nearby monastery. But the monk disapproved of their use and threw them into the fire, from which an enticing aroma billowed, causing other monks to come and investigate. The roasted beans were quickly raked from <b>the</b> <b>embers,</b> ground up, and dissolved in hot water, yielding the world's first cup of coffee. Since this story is not known to have appeared in writing before 1671, 800 {{years after it was}} supposed to have taken place, it is highly likely to be apocryphal.|$|E

2500|$|The drill {{offers an}} ancient method of {{starting}} fire without matches or a lighter, {{a method that}} applies friction to generate heat.

Once <b>the</b> <b>ember</b> is formed it is carefully placed into a [...] "tinder bundle" [...] (a bird's type nest of stringy, fluffy, and combustible material). Once <b>the</b> <b>ember</b> is in <b>the</b> tinder bundle it is then carefully nurtured and coaxed into flame.

Invariably, the third time the father lies in wait, trying to discover the identity of their benefactor. In one version the father confronts the saint, only to have Nicholas say it is not him he should thank, but God alone. In another version, Nicholas learns of the poor man's plan and drops the third bag down the chimney instead; a variant holds that the daughter had washed her stockings that evening and hung them over <b>the</b> <b>embers</b> to dry, and that the bag of gold fell into the stocking.|$|E
25|$|Faced {{with the}} {{stripping}} of their powers, Wu Sangui, later joined by Geng Zhongming and by Shang Kexi's son Shang Zhixin, {{felt they had}} no choice but to revolt. The ensuing Revolt of the Three Feudatories lasted for eight years. Wu attempted, ultimately in vain, to fire <b>the</b> <b>embers</b> of south China Ming loyalty by restoring Ming customs, ordering that the resented queues be cut, and declaring himself emperor of a new dynasty. At the peak of the rebels' fortunes, they extended their control as far north as the Yangtze River, nearly establishing a divided China. Wu then hesitated to go further north, not being able to coordinate strategy with his allies, and Kangxi was able to unify his forces for a counterattack led by a new generation of Manchu generals. By 1681, the Qing government had established control over a ravaged southern China which took several decades to recover.|$|E
25|$|Wood-burners emit large {{quantities}} of flying sparks which necessitate an efficient spark-arresting device generally housed in the smokestack. Many different types were fitted, the most common early type being the Bonnet stack that incorporated a cone-shaped deflector placed before {{the mouth of the}} chimney pipe, and a wire screen covering the wide stack exit. A more-efficient design was the Radley and Hunter centrifugal stack patented in 1850 (commonly known as the diamond stack), incorporating baffles so oriented as to induce a swirl effect in the chamber that encouraged <b>the</b> <b>embers</b> to burn out and fall to the bottom as ash. In the self-cleaning smokebox the opposite effect was achieved: by allowing the flue gasses to strike a series of deflector plates, angled {{in such a way that}} the blast was not impaired, the larger particles were broken into small pieces that would be ejected with the blast, rather than settle in the bottom of the smokebox to be removed by hand at the end of the run. As with the arrestor, a screen was incorporated to retain any large embers.|$|E

25|$|The term darb-e mehr is {{also common}} in India, albeit with a {{slightly}} different meaning. Until the 17th century the fire (now) at Udvada was the only continuously burning one on the Indian subcontinent. Each of the other settlements had a small building in which rituals were performed, and the fire of which the priests would relight whenever necessary from <b>the</b> <b>embers</b> carried from their own hearth fires (Kotwal, 1974:665). The Parsis called such an unconsecrated building either dar-be mehr or agiary. The latter is the Gujarati language word for 'house of fire' (Kotwal, 1974:665) and thus a literal translation of atashkada. In recent years, the term dar-be mehr has come {{to refer to a}} secondary sacred fire (the dadgah) for daily ritual use that is present at the more prestigious fire temples. Overseas, in particular in North America, Zoroastrians use the term dar-be mehr for both temples that have an eternally burning fire as well as for sites where the fire is only kindled occasionally. This is largely due to the financial support of such places by one Arbab Rustam Guiv, who preferred the dialectic Iranian form.|$|E

500|$|... "It was {{the custom}} to burn a basket, barrel, or sack full of live cats, which was {{hung from a}} tall mast {{in the midst of}} the bonfire; {{sometimes}} a fox was burned. The people collected <b>the</b> <b>embers</b> and ashes of the fire and took them home, believing that they brought good luck. The French kings often witnessed these spectacles and even lit the bonfire with their own hands. In 1648 Louis XIV, crowned with a wreath of roses and carrying a bunch of roses in his hand, kindled the fire, danced at it and partook of the banquet afterwards in the town hall. But this was the last occasion when a monarch presided at the midsummer bonfire in Paris. At Metz midsummer fires were lighted with great pomp on the esplanade, and a dozen cats, enclosed in wicker cages, were burned alive in them, to the amusement of the people. Similarly at Gap, in the department of the Hautes-Alpes, cats used to be roasted over the midsummer bonfire." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrianjaka was {{the second}} son of Ralambo, ruler of the Kingdom of Imerina in the central {{highlands}} of Madagascar. As a young man, Andrianjaka married Ravadifo, a daughter of Prince Andriampanarivomanjaka. The marriage produced one daughter and one son, Andriantsitakatrandriana, who would rule after his father from 1630 to 1650. Andrianjaka was also actively involved in providing support to his father's military campaigns to expand and defend Ralambo's realm. Oral history describes an incident wherein Andrianjaka and Ralambo were engaged {{in the defense of}} Ralambo's capital at Ambohidrabiby, which was threatened by the advance of Antsihanaka warriors. Andrianjaka reportedly suggested an innovative defensive tactic to annihilate the enemy by filling the town's hadivory (defensive trenches) with cow dung and rice husks, lighting it on fire, and covering the smoldering embers with burnt rice stalks so that the area resembled a patch of land recently re-cleared for planting through tavy (slash and burn agriculture).

500|$|The {{habitat of}} the green-head ant varies, ranging from desert, heath, open forests, urban areas and woodland. These ants mainly live in {{moderate}} wooded or open areas, {{but they are}} abundant in lawns and gardens in cities. Nests {{have been found in}} dry and wet sclerophyll woodland, mallee, savannah woodland, on roadsides, and in native vegetation. Green-head ants are mostly found at altitudes of between [...] above sea level. The workers construct small and loosely integrated nests underground or in decaying wooden stumps. They may also nest in the termite mounds of Amitermes laurensis. These nests are commonly found beneath grass roots or under logs, stones, twigs, or at the base of shrubs. Green-head ants can nest in disturbed areas, and, as a result, colonies of these ants are rather common in urban areas. They are among the first insects to be seen foraging for food in areas where bushfires have occurred, and in some cases they return right after <b>the</b> <b>embers</b> have stopped smouldering. Rain also presents no threat to green-head ants {{as long as it is}} a light shower in continuous sunshine.|$|E
