5|$|A {{historical}} plaque {{awarded to}} Avery indicates <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> oldest house in Ledyard and states its date from 1720, but evidence suggests {{it to be}} older. This plaque {{was part of a}} statewide funded campaign by the State of Connecticut for the 350th anniversary of the state's founding. Disagreements over the program were widespread due to the difficulty in dating the homes by craftsmanship and the lack of documentation to prove it. Ledyard recognized the Avery Homestead because of the documentation possessed by Amos G. Avery.|$|E
5|$|ASL is {{sometimes}} incorrectly {{cited as the}} third- or fourth-most-spoken language in the United States. These figures misquote Schein and Delk (1974), who actually concluded that ASL speakers constituted the third-largest population requiring an interpreter in court. Although this would make ASL the third-most used language among monolinguals other than English, it does not imply <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> fourth-most-spoken language in the United States, since speakers of other languages may also speak English.|$|E

One skeleton of Repenomamus robustus, a large triconodont mammal, is preserved with {{the remains of}} a juvenile Psittacosaurus in its abdominal cavity. Several of the juvenile's bones are still articulated, indicating that the carnivorous mammal swallowed its prey in large chunks. This specimen is notable in <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> first known example of Mesozoic mammals preying on live dinosaurs. Heavy predation on juvenile Psittacosaurus may have resulted in R-selection, the production of more numerous offspring to counteract this loss.|$|E

5|$|Hermann von Helmholtz in 1847 {{published}} his important work on {{conservation of energy}} in part of which he used those principles {{to explain why the}} oscillation dies away, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> resistance of the circuit which dissipates the energy of the oscillation on each successive cycle. Helmholtz also noted that there was evidence of oscillation from the electrolysis experiments of William Hyde Wollaston. Wollaston was attempting to decompose water by electric shock but found that both hydrogen and oxygen were present at both electrodes. In normal electrolysis they would separate, one to each electrode.|$|E

The conclusion is drawn that di- and trisyllabic words with a short first syllable are stressed on the second syllable.
