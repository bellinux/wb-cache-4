5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, a British gun team {{consisted}} of five gunners to aim it, clean the bore {{with a damp}} sponge to quench any remaining embers before a fresh charge was introduced, and another to load the gun {{with a bag of}} powder and then the projectile. The fourth gunner pressed his <b>thumb</b> <b>on</b> the vent hole, to prevent a draught that might fan a flame. The charge loaded, the fourth would prick the bagged charge through the vent hole, and fill the vent with powder. On command, the fifth gunner would fire the piece with a slowmatch.|$|E
5|$|Finucane {{moved on}} to the Hawker Fury on 21 March 1939. On 23 June, he was classed as average again, but with low marks—2,010 out of 3,400—just 59 percent. Pilot ability was {{assessed}} as 400 out of 750; officer qualities 450 of 750; and in the written exams 837 of 1,300. Examined in navigation, meteorology, engine mechanics and armament, he achieved marks of 77, 54, 50 and 65 percent. At this time, he flew radio-controlled aircraft for the Targeting Section. On 10 July, he crashed a Queen bee on a transport flight to Gosport in bad weather, which did not improve his standing as a pilot. He escaped with a cut <b>thumb.</b> <b>On</b> 29 August, he was re-graded as a pilot officer (on probation), with the service number 41276.|$|E

5|$|One of Parcells first {{decisions}} as coach was to replace Simms {{as the starting}} quarterback with Brunner. Simms asked to be traded after the benching, but his request was ignored. During the sixth game of the Giants' 1983 Season, Simms came in to replace the struggling Brunner against the Philadelphia Eagles. On his second drive, Simms suffered a season-ending injury when the <b>thumb</b> <b>on</b> his throwing hand hit a player's helmet on his follow-through. The injury was reported as a dislocation, {{but according to the}} book, Simms to McConkey, written by Phil McConkey, Simms, and Dick Schaap, the injury was much more severe, with the thumb literally hanging off after impact, and the bone sticking out through the skin.|$|E
5|$|Delaware {{kicked off}} {{to start the}} game, and wide {{receiver}} Torrey Smith returned the ball 23yards to the Maryland 32-yard line. Quarterback Jordan Steffy then led a Maryland drive, but the series ended when placekicker Obi Egekeze missed a 48-yard field goal attempt. On the next Maryland possession, Egekeze missed another field goal attempt, this time of 45yards. The teams then exchanged several punts before Maryland took over on the Delaware 48-yard line. Steffy completed a 36-yard pass to Darrius Heyward-Bey, which set up a 12-yard touchdown rush also by Heyward-Bey. Delaware drove 44yards, but then missed their own 46-yard field goal attempt. With 3:33 left in the half, Steffy engineered a 47-yard drive {{to set up a}} 41-yard field goal attempt, which Egekeze missed for the third time. On the first play of the second half, Delaware quarterback Rob Schoenhoft threw an interception to cornerback Kevin Barnes, who returned it 10yards to the Delaware 46-yard line. On the next play, Steffy threw an interception to Erik Johnson, who returned it to the Maryland 49-yard line. The Terrapins' next possession ended when, fourth and 18, Steffy threw another interception at the Delaware one-yard line. Incidentally, this put the Blue Hens in worse field position than if the Terrapins had turned over on downs. Soon after, Delaware punted the ball away. Running back Da'Rel Scott then rushed for a 30-yard gain, which set up a 14-yard touchdown run by running back Davin Meggett. Chris Turner took over as Maryland's quarterback on the second series of the fourth quarter after Steffy fractured his right <b>thumb.</b> <b>On</b> Delaware's subsequent possession, Schoenhoft engineered an 80-yard drive, which culminated with a one-yard touchdown rush by running back Johnathan Smith. With 3:20 on the clock, Schoenhoft threw an interception to safety Terrell Skinner. Turner then scrambled for a first down, and Scott converted for a second first down, which allowed Maryland to run out the game clock. Maryland won, with a final score of 14–7.|$|E

50|$|The Roger Rabbit {{became a}} popular dance {{move in the}} early 1990s. It was named after the floppy {{movements}} of the Roger Rabbit cartoon character.

25|$|The shaft skin {{can also}} be slid {{back and forth with}} just the index finger and thumb wrapped around the penis. A {{variation}} on this is to place the fingers and <b>thumb</b> <b>on</b> the penis as if playing a flute, and then shuttle them back and forth. Lying face down on a comfortable surface such as a mattress or pillow, the penis can be rubbed against it. This technique may include the use of a simulacrum, or artificial vagina.|$|E

25|$|Symptoms of Bennett {{fracture}} are {{instability of}} the CMC joint of the thumb, accompanied by pain and {{weakness of the}} pinch grasp. Characteristic signs include pain, swelling, and ecchymosis {{around the base of}} the thumb and thenar eminence, and especially over the CMC joint of the thumb. Physical examination demonstrates instability of the CMC joint of the thumb. The patient will often manifest a weakened ability to grasp objects or perform such tasks as tying shoes and tearing a piece of paper. Other complaints include intense pain experienced upon catching the <b>thumb</b> <b>on</b> an object, such as when reaching into a pants pocket.|$|E

25|$|Rape upon Rape was a five-act comedic {{play that}} was written early 1730. It was advertised to start on 15 June 1730, but, after a delay, it first ran on 23 June 1730 at the Little Theatre for eight nights until 21 July 1730. It was {{originally}} shown at the Haymarket theatre without a companion play. However, it was later shown with Tom <b>Thumb</b> <b>on</b> 1 July 1730 and with Jack the Giant Killer on 10 July 1730. The play was shown four more times at the Lincoln's Inn Fields theatre during that December under a new title, The Coffee-House Politician. The first printing of the play coincided with its opening night, 23 June 1730.|$|E
25|$|Even more {{extraordinary}} {{was the way}} Owen {{ignored the}} genuine scientific content of Mantell's work. For example, despite the paucity of finds Mantell had worked out that some dinosaurs were bipedal, including Iguanodon. This remarkable insight was totally ignored by Owen, whose instructions for the Crystal Palace models by Waterhouse Hawkins portrayed Iguanodon as grossly overweight and quadrupedal, with its misidentified <b>thumb</b> <b>on</b> its nose. Mantell did not live to witness the discovery in 1878 of articulated skeletons in a Belgium coal-mine that showed Iguanodon was mostly bipedal (and in that stance could use its thumb for defence). Owen made no comment or retraction; he never did on any errors he made. Moreover, since the earliest known dinosaurs were bipedal, Mantell's idea was indeed insightful.|$|E
25|$|The {{conventional}} reel or trolling reel {{is similar}} to the baitcasting reel. There are two types of trolling reels, star drag reels and lever drag reels. Star drag reels are like baitcasters, but you move a little lever to put it into free spool. They have a star drag and you have to keep your <b>thumb</b> <b>on</b> them to keep off backlash. The lever drag reel uses the drag to put itself into free spool. It is very difficult to cast a conventional reel, most oven line is dropped behind a boat and left to drift. Conventional reels are for really big fish and are usually used offshore. They are designed for trolling but can also be used for butterfly jigging and Deep-sea fishing ("deep drop"). They are mounted on short rods.|$|E

25|$|Early in {{the fourth}} quarter, Starr was knocked {{out of the game}} when he jammed the <b>thumb</b> <b>on</b> his {{throwing}} hand on a sack by Davidson. (Starr was replaced by Zeke Bratkowski, who would be sacked on his only pass attempt.) But later in the period, the Packers put the game completely out of reach when defensive back Herb Adderley intercepted a pass intended for Fred Biletnikoff and returned it 60 yards for a touchdown, making the score 33–7. Oakland did manage to score on their next drive after the turnover with a second 23-yard touchdown pass from Lamonica to Miller, set up by Pete Banaszak's 41-yard reception on the previous play. But all the Raiders' second touchdown did was make the final score look remotely more respectable, 33–14.|$|E
25|$|The {{salmon is}} an {{important}} creature in several strands of Celtic mythology and poetry, which often associated them with wisdom and venerability. In Irish mythology, a creature called the Salmon of Knowledge plays {{key role in the}} tale The Boyhood Deeds of Fionn. In the tale, the Salmon will grant powers of knowledge to whoever eats it, and is sought by poet Finn Eces for seven years. Finally Finn Eces catches the fish and gives it to his young pupil, Fionn mac Cumhaill, to prepare it for him. However, Fionn burns his <b>thumb</b> <b>on</b> the salmon's juices, and he instinctively puts it in his mouth. In so doing, he inadvertently gains the Salmon's wisdom. Elsewhere in Irish mythology, the salmon {{is also one of the}} incarnations of both Tuan mac Cairill and Fintan mac Bóchra.|$|E
25|$|It {{appears from}} {{the imagery of}} the Swedish runestones that the most popular Norse legend in the area was that of Sigurd the dragon slayer. He is {{depicted}} on several runestones, but {{the most famous of}} them is the Ramsund inscription. The inscription itself is of a common kind that tells of the building of a bridge, but the ornamentation shows Sigurd sitting in a pit thrusting his sword, forged by Regin, through the body of the dragon, which also forms the runic band in which the runes are engraved. In the left part of the inscription lies Regin, who is beheaded with all his smithying tools around him. To the right of Regin, Sigurd is sitting and he has just burnt his <b>thumb</b> <b>on</b> the dragon's heart that he is roasting. He is putting the thumb in his mouth and begins to understand the language of the marsh-tits that are sitting in the tree. They warn him of Regin's schemes. Sigurd's horse Grani is also shown tethered to the tree.|$|E
50|$|Common {{treatments}} involve {{placing the}} reptile in a lukewarm bath and gently rubbing the area under the impaction {{to help the}} passing of the consumed substance, place both <b>thumbs</b> <b>on</b> the back at the middle, put the first two fingers under the belly and rub gently in a circular way until the beaded dragon puffs up, when the lizard puffs up it will go the loo. If this fails, the animal must have an enema.|$|R

500|$|In early 1973, Sylvester and The Hot Band {{were signed}} by Bob Krasnow to Blue <b>Thumb.</b> <b>On</b> this label, they {{produced}} their first album, {{in which they}} switched their sound from blues to the more commercially viable rock, while the Pointer Sisters were employed as backing singers. Sylvester named this first album Scratch My Flower due to a gardenia-shaped scratch-and-sniff sticker adhered to the cover, although it was instead released under the title of Sylvester and his Hot Band. The album consisted primarily of covers of songs by artists such as James Taylor, Ray Charles, Neil Young, and Leiber and Stoller. Described by one of Sylvester's biographers as lacking in [...] "the fire and focus of the live shows", it sold poorly on release.|$|E
500|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, a British gun team {{consisted}} of 5 numbered gunners - fewer crew than {{needed in the}} previous century. The No.1 was the gun commander, and a sergeant, who aimed the gun. The No.2 was the [...] "spongeman" [...] who cleaned the bore with the sponge dampened with water between shots; the intention being to quench any remaining embers before a fresh charge was introduced. The No.3, the loader, inserted the bag of powder and then the projectile. The No.2 then used a rammer, or the sponge reversed, to drive it in. At the same time, the No.4 ("ventsman") pressed his <b>thumb</b> <b>on</b> the vent hole to prevent a draught that might fan a flame. The charge loaded, the No.4 pricked the bagged charge through the vent hole and filled the vent with powder. At the No.1s command the No.5 would fire the piece with his slowmatch.|$|E
500|$|The Saints, having {{achieved}} their first winning record in team history, clinched their first-ever playoff spot by defeating the Buccaneers 44–34. The Saints led {{the game for}} good after two early Vinny Testaverde fumbles deep in Buccaneer territory. Testaverde was given the starting job over Steve DeBerg, a change that was not revealed until gametime. [...] "(Perkins) didn't {{want to give the}} Saints time to prepare for anything new", said Testaverde. In the second half, Testaverde made the Saints nervous by rallying the Buccaneers to score on four consecutive possessions. Mark Carrier's 212yards on eight receptions set a team record, and Bruce Hill contributed 73yards on five receptions. The rally lifted team spirits. [...] "There's definitely some {{light at the end of}} the tunnel, and it's not a train", said Perkins. The rally came after a turbulent halftime, in which Ron Heller urged his teammates not to quit. Ray Perkins, hearing only the word [...] "quit", punched Heller in the head, breaking his <b>thumb</b> <b>on</b> Heller's helmet. The Saints' first playoff-clinching win came on the tenth anniversary of the Buccaneers' first victory in franchise history, also a road game against the Saints.|$|E
