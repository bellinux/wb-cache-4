In that capacity, he urged the modernization and expansion of the Army, with a focus on militias and mobility rather than on coastal fortifications, which he considered outdated.|$|E

Hatfield died in Portland on August 7, 2011, after a long illness.|$|E
5|$|Mallory {{was placed}} on <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Committee</b> on Naval Affairs. His {{assignment}} became significant when President Millard Fillmore in his Message to Congress of December 13, 1851, recommended Congressional action on two issues. First was the problem {{of what to do}} with ineffective officers in the Navy. At the time, promotion was based solely on seniority, and no policy existed for removing officers who could not or would not fulfill their duties. Second was the issue of discipline in the enlisted rates. The practice of flogging had been outlawed in the previous Congress, and many of the old captains believed discipline on their warships was deteriorating; they wanted a return to the old ways, or at least a reasonable substitute that would enable them to exert their authority.|$|E
50|$|In <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> he was <b>the</b> first {{chairman}} of <b>the</b> U.S. <b>Senate</b> <b>Committee</b> on Appropriations.

5|$|Slaughter was re-elected to {{the state}} House in 1800, and from 1801 to 1808 {{he served in the}} Kentucky Senate. In 1801, he was chosen as one of three commissioners from Mercer County charged with selling stock shares in the Kentucky River Company, which was {{chartered}} to clear obstructions in the Kentucky River from its mouth to the mouth of its south fork. In 1804, he was a candidate for President Pro Tempore of the Kentucky Senate following the death of the Senate's presiding officer, Lieutenant Governor John Caldwell. Ultimately, however, Thomas Posey proved the more popular choice. From 1807 to 1808, he served as chair of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Committee</b> of Propositions and Grievances.|$|E
5|$|In July 1944, {{before the}} Interim Committee was formed, Bush, Conant and Irvin Stewart had {{produced}} {{a proposal for}} legislation to control nuclear energy. Conant submitted the proposals to the Interim Committee at its meeting on July 9, 1945. Harrison brought in two experienced lawyers, Kenneth Royall and William L. Marbury {{to take up the}} job of drafting the legislation. Their draft bill would have created a nine-man commission consisting of five civilian and four military members. It granted the commission broad powers to acquire property, to operate facilities, to conduct research and to regulate all forms of nuclear energy. The Royall-Marbury bill was reviewed by the Interim Committee at its July 19 meeting and revised in line with their suggestions. The bill was forwarded to the President in August. The Interim Committee met again on September 28 to discuss legislative strategy. The Royall-Marbury bill was introduced into the United States Congress by the chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, Andrew J. May, and the ranking member of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Committee</b> on Military Affairs, Senator Edwin C. Johnson on October 3. It then became known as the May-Johnson bill.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, April 22, 1920, the House reported {{its passage}} of the bill to the Senate. The bill was referred to <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> <b>Committee</b> on Banking and Currency; on April 28, Connecticut's George P. McLean reported it back with a recommendation it pass. On May 3, McLean asked that the three coin bills (Maine, Alabama and Pilgrim) be considered by the Senate immediately, rather than awaiting their turns, but Utah Senator Reed Smoot objected: Smoot's attempt to bring up an anti-dumping trade bill had just been objected to by Charles S. Thomas of Colorado. Smoot, however, stated if the bills had not been considered by about 2:00 pm, there would probably not be any objection. When McLean tried again to advance the coin bills, Kansas' Charles Curtis {{asked if there was}} any urgency. McLean replied that as the three coin bills were to mark ongoing anniversaries, there was a need to have them authorized and get the production process started. All three bills passed the Senate without opposition and the Pilgrim bill was enacted with the signature of President Woodrow Wilson on May 12, 1920.|$|E
