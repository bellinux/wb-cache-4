5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1945 several hundred {{veterans}} of the battle were detached from operations in Norway and returned to Arnhem {{to take part in}} filming for the war movie <b>Theirs</b> <b>Is</b> the Glory. While there they attended the first commemorative event at the cemetery. This event continued every year, and was attended by veterans, local residents and over 1000 school children who laid flowers on the graves of the dead. After the 25th anniversary in 1969, the Parachute Regiment approached Dutch organisers to suggest ending the ceremony, believing the battle to have passed sufficiently into history. The Dutch were vehemently and emotionally opposed to the idea and thus the ceremony continues to be held annually.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the arrival}} of other units from Force 134, {{as well as the}} Headquarters of Allied Forces, Norway, Major General Urquhart and his {{headquarters}} staff had complete control over all Norwegian activities. This meant that it was Urquhart who welcomed Crown Prince Olaf of Norway and three ministers representing the Norwegian Government when they arrived on a Royal Navy cruiser, and the division also took part in the celebrations when King Haakon VII of Norway returned to his country from exile. Other duties for the division included rounding up war criminals, ensuring that German troops were confined to their camps and reservations and, with Royal Engineer assistance, clearing buildings of mines and other boobytraps. They were also given the responsibility of assisting Allied personnel who had, until the German surrender, been prisoners of war in Norway, a large number of whom were Russian. There were more than 80,000 Russian ex-prisoners of war, and many needed medical treatment because of the inhumane conditions of the camps in which they had been imprisoned. When a parade was held in late June to celebrate the Allied liberation, many of the Russians participated, wearing uniforms with Red Star badges they had made themselves. During the division's time in Norway, some 400 paratroopers under the command of Major Frederick Gough were temporarily transferred to the Netherlands, where they helped take part in <b>Theirs</b> <b>Is</b> the Glory, a documentary about the Battle of Arnhem.|$|E

25|$|That Susan was Kane's {{wife and}} Marion was Hearst's {{mistress}} {{is a difference}} more important than might be guessed in today's changed climate of opinion. The wife was a puppet and a prisoner; the mistress was never less than a princess. Hearst built more than one castle, and Marion was the hostess in all of them: they were pleasure domes indeed, and the Beautiful People of the day fought for invitations. Xanadu was a lonely fortress, and Susan was quite right to escape from it. The mistress was never one of Hearst's possessions: he was always her suitor, {{and she was the}} precious treasure of his heart for more than 30 years, until his last breath of life. <b>Theirs</b> <b>is</b> truly a love story.

Jackson wrote that Vasilisa and Lukerya are the story's true heroes, since [...] "in the most essential terms of human experience they have kept the faith: <b>theirs</b> <b>is</b> {{the light of the}} biblical 'burning bush,' and they have kept the fires burning".|$|E

500|$|Nevertheless, John Big Tree, a Seneca, {{claimed to}} be a model for Fraser's coin, and made many public {{appearances}} as the [...] "nickel Indian" [...] until his 1967 death at the age of 92 (though he sometimes alleged he was over 100years of age). Big Tree was identified as the model for the nickel in wire service reports about his death, and he had appeared in that capacity at the Texas Numismatic Association convention in 1966. [...] After Big Tree's death, the Mint stated that he most likely was not one of the models for the nickel. There have been other claimants: in 1964, Montana Senator Mike Mansfield wrote to Mint Director Eva B. Adams, enquiring if Sam Resurrection, a Choctaw was a model for the nickel. Adams wrote in reply, [...] "According to our records, the portrait is a composite. There have been many claimants for this honor, all of whom are undoubtedly sincere in the belief that <b>theirs</b> <b>is</b> the one that adorns the nickel." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} did {{not endorse}} some fans' readings, {{according to a}} study on the subject: [...] "Not content to allow Shippers to perceive what they wish, Carter has consistently reassured NoRomos [...] that <b>theirs</b> <b>is</b> the preferred reading. This allows him the plausible deniability to credit the show's success to his original plan even though many watched in anticipation of a romance, thanks, in part, to his strategic polysemy. He can deny that these fans had reason to do so, however, since he has repeatedly stated that a romance was not and would never be." [...] The Scully-obsessed writer in Carter's 1999 episode [...] "Milagro" [...] was read by some as his alter ego, realizing that by this point [...] "she has fallen for Mulder despite his authorial intent". The writers sometimes paid tribute to the more visible fans by naming minor characters after them. The best example is Leyla Harrison. Played by Jolie Jenkins and introduced in the eighth-season episode [...] "Alone", Harrison, was created and named in memory of an Internet fan and prolific writer of fan fiction of the same name, who died of cancer on February 10, 2001.|$|E

Scully, still skeptical about Big Blue being the killer, thinks that a boat propeller was responsible. A photographer named Ansel is also attacked just as he was frantically taking pictures of the creature. After falling into the lake and feeling something in the water, the Sheriff orders the lake closed. While Mulder looks at Ansel's photographs later that night, Scully takes Queequeg for a walk; the dog, sensing something in the nearby woods, ends up running off and disappearing (yelping is heard), becoming the latest victim of the attacks and leaving Scully saddened. Mulder realizes that the Big Blue sightings have been occurring closer and closer to shore.|$|E

500|$|... "Praising Cordelia" [...] {{argues that}} both Buffy and Cordelia are {{representations}} of assertive and competitive young women, who [...] "represent {{two kinds of}} aggressive adolescent girls". The article focuses on the competitive relationship between the characters. Buffy's initial friendship with Cordelia is compromised once Cordelia sees the attractive, socially competent Buffy {{as a threat to}} her. Even after Cordelia joins the Scooby Gang and becomes Buffy's friend, <b>theirs</b> <b>is</b> not a friendship of [...] "mutual support, warmth and intimacy" [...] but rather one of [...] "mutual antipathy". The authors opine that Cordelia, unlike Buffy, is a [...] "representation of the archetypal 'feminine type'", one who conforms to the [...] "pervasive stereotypes of femininity while, at the same time, dominating the other girls in the school" [...] and commanding the attention of the boys. Describing her character arc in Buffy, Mary Alice Money views Cordelia as one of many transformed or redeemed Buffy characters, one who [...] "reveals a previously unexpected vulnerability that nullifies some of their less attractive traits." [...] Jowett argues that Cordelia's assimilation within the main group is due largely to her relationship with main character Xander, and she is rendered sympathetic to the audience once they witness her rebuff the peer pressure from her old friends. She is further endeared to the viewer when Xander betrays her, because the scenes showing her pain are shown only to the viewer. After Cordelia is cheated on by Xander with Willow she chooses not to go back to him, and instead retains her autonomy.|$|E
500|$|Avatar {{has been}} called [...] "without a doubt the most epic piece of {{environmental}} advocacy ever captured on celluloid.... The film hits all the important environmental talking-points—virgin rain forests threatened by wanton exploitation, indigenous peoples who have much to teach the developed world, a planet which functions as a collective, interconnected Gaia-istic organism, and evil corporate interests {{that are trying to}} destroy it all." [...] Cameron has spoken extensively with the media about the film's environmental message, saying that he envisioned Avatar as a broader metaphor of how we treat the natural world. [...] He said that he created Pandora as [...] "a fictionalised fantasy version of what our world was like, before we started to pave it and build malls, and shopping centers. [...] So it's really an evocation of the world we used to have." [...] He told Charlie Rose that [...] "we are going to go through a lot of pain and heartache if we don't acknowledge our stewardship responsibilities to nature." [...] Interviewed by Terry Gross of National Public Radio, he called Avatar a satire on the sense of human entitlement: [...] " [...] is saying our attitude about indigenous people and our entitlement about what is rightfully <b>theirs</b> <b>is</b> the same sense of entitlement that lets us bulldoze a forest and not blink an eye. It's just human nature that if we can take it, we will. And sometimes we do it in a very naked and imperialistic way, and other times we do it in a very sophisticated way with lots of rationalization—but it's basically the same thing. A sense of entitlement. And we can't just go on in this unsustainable way, just taking what we want and not giving back."

And the ongoing shift of M, as played by Judi Dench, to front and centre: the Bond girls fade into insignificance as she becomes his moral counterpoint and <b>theirs</b> <b>is</b> {{the only real}} relationship on screen." [...] The review continues, [...] "Bond is, as has been previously noted, practically the Martin Scorsese of the BAFTAs: 22 films later, with grosses probably close to the GDP {{of one of the}} small nations it depicts, it's still waiting for that Alexander Korda award. The best Casino Royale could achieve was a gong for sound. Will this be the year that changes its fortunes?" [...] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times, who praised the previous film, disliked Quantum of Solace. He wrote that the plot was mediocre, characters weak and that Bond lacked his usual personality, despite his praise for Craig's interpretation of the role. Throughout his review, he emphasised that [...] "James Bond is not an action hero." [...] Kate Muir wrote in The Times that [...] "The Bond franchise is 50 years old this year, and the scriptless mess of Quantum of Solace may be considered its mid-life crisis", before she went on to praise the film's successor Skyfall as a [...] "resurrection". Some writers criticised the choice of Quantum of Solace as a title.
