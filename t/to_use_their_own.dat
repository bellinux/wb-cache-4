5|$|With {{the end of}} the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, many of its dukes and princes {{joined the}} Confederation of the Rhine, a {{confederation}} of Napoleonic client states. These states preferred <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> flags. The confederation had no flag of its own; instead it used the blue-white-red flag of France and the Imperial Standard of its protector, Napoleon.|$|E
5|$|At Khe Sanh, the U.S. Marines {{held the}} high ground, and their {{artillery}} forced the North Vietnamese <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> artillery from {{a much greater}} distance. By contrast, at Điện Biên Phủ, the French artillery (six 105mm batteries and one battery of four 155mm howitzers and mortars) was only sporadically effective;Furthermore, by 1968, the American military presence in Vietnam dwarfed that of the French, and included numerous technological advances such as effective helicopters.|$|E

By using geothermal sources of energy present generations of humans will not endanger the capability of future generations <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> resources to the same amount that those energy sources are presently used. Further, due to its low emissions geothermal energy is considered to have excellent potential for mitigation of global warming.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before the}} Wall Street Crash of 1929, investors {{including}} William Henry Crocker bought adjoining parcels {{of land in}} Oakland {{for the purpose of}} erecting a movie palace to rival the nearby Fox Orpheum, intending that Miller and Pflueger build it. One of the largest studio and theater chains in the country, Paramount Publix, showed great interest, but wanted <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> East Coast architect instead. Pflueger went to New York and convinced Paramount Publix to use his firm by demonstrating that past projects of his had stayed within budget, a concern of increasing importance in the cautious financial climate of early 1930.|$|E

5|$|The Confederate {{trousers}} {{were very}} {{similar to those of the}} Union forces. Early on, the trousers were sky blue in color. They were most often made of wool, and were easily worn during long marches. If trousers did not arrive for the troops the soldiers would have <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> pants to wear. Regimental and company officers wore the colors of their respective branch on the outer seam of their pants on one and one-quarter inch stripes. Generals wore two and five-eighths inch stripes on each pant leg. While the quartermasters, commissary, and engineer officers wore a single magenta, one and one-quarter inch outer-seam stripe. Non-commissioned officers were to wear on their outer seams a one and one-quarter inch cotton stripe or braid of colors appropriate to their army branch.|$|E
5|$|However it was {{considered}} the low-level sight's chief advantages would be demonstrated under operational conditions. The sight {{was considered}} a great advancement on any previous method of low-level bombing, either by eye or with a bombsight. The best figures from No. 59 Squadron's trials were 6yd range error with release from 800ft, and 5yd error when approaching at 100ft, but releasing from 400ft with the aircraft's nose slightly up. Some academics in the ORS stated a 20yd error range existed but maintained the Mark III was promising. Some crews did not trust the device, which was the case when asked to use equipment of which they had little experience. Instead, many continued relying on their own trusted eyesight. A continued lack of resources meant there was no widespread use of the sights. In later months, the aircrew changed tactics and with new weapons, they decided {{that it would take}} too long to zero-in on a target using the device. Pilots and crew often opted <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> judgement by direct sighting with considerable success.|$|E
5|$|In a draw made {{prior to}} the quarter-finals, it was {{determined}} that the winner of the match between Cardiff and Toulouse would have home country advantage, meaning that they could choose any venue in their own country for the semi-finals, provided it was not their designated home ground. The winner of the match between Leicester and Bath was drawn against them as the away team. Cardiff elected to stage the game at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, which is located adjacent to their usual Cardiff Arms Park ground and has a much larger capacity of 74,500, compared to the 12,500 capacity of the Arms Park. Cardiff had already moved their quarter-final game against Toulouse to the Millennium Stadium, despite being able <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> ground at that stage of the competition, {{to take advantage of the}} increased capacity.|$|E

At first, Boyd had copied several drawings from a sex education book that Einziger's mother had given them, {{but he decided}} <b>to</b> stop <b>using</b> it after several prospective fans had been confused by their fliers ("What kind of band is this?"). So the band had to retreat back <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> artwork. He is known for having some guitar parts during live performances. Boyd is also known for bringing interesting instruments into his songs, such as the didgeridoo and djembe.|$|R

5|$|There was {{a gradual}} {{reduction}} in the number of locations allowed to mint coins in England; under HenryII, only 30 boroughs were still able <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> moneyers, and the tightening of controls continued throughout the 13th century. By the reign of EdwardI there were only nine mints outside London and the king created a new official called the Master of the Mint to oversee these and the thirty furnaces operating in London to meet the demand for new coins. The amount of money in circulation hugely increased in this period; before the Norman invasion there had been around £50,000 in circulation as coin, but by 1311 this had risen to more than £1million. At any particular point in time, though, much of this currency might be being stored prior to being used to support military campaigns or to be sent overseas to meet payments, resulting in bursts of temporary deflation as coins ceased to circulate within the English economy. One physical consequence of the growth in the coinage was that coins had to be manufactured in large numbers, being moved in barrels and sacks to be stored in local treasuries for royal use as the king travelled.|$|E
5|$|All four {{ships were}} laid down on 16 June 1909, {{but this was}} just a {{ceremonial}} event as actual work did not begin until September–October. One major complication was that the design for the turrets and their magazines was not completed when construction began so their weights and dimensions had to be estimated. The machinery for these ships was built by either the Baltic Works or the Franco-Russian Works as the New Admiralty Shipyard lacked its own engine shop. Construction was initially very slow because the Duma did not allocate any money for these ships until May 1911. Initial funding was taken from other budget items or the emperor's discretionary fund and the shipyards had <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> money to keep the work going. They were enormously expensive with their cost estimated at 29.4 million rubles each, including armament. By way of comparison the preceding class of pre-dreadnoughts had only cost 11 million rubles each. Once the Duma provided the funding the pace of work accelerated and the ships were launched later that year, although delays in the delivery of engines and turrets hindered their completion. All of the ships completed abbreviated trials by the end of 1914 and reached the fleet in December 1914 – January 1915.|$|E
5|$|Dominican missionaries {{were active}} in Verapaz and the {{southern}} Petén from the late 16th century through the 17th century, attempting non-violent conversion with limited success. In the 17th century the Franciscans {{came to the conclusion}} that the pacification and Christian conversion of the Maya would not be possible as long as the Itza held out at Lake Petén Itzá. The constant flow of escapees fleeing the Spanish-held territories to find refuge with the Itza was a drain on the encomiendas. Fray Bartolomé de Fuensalida visited Nojpetén in 1618 and 1619. The Franciscan missionaries attempted <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>their</b> <b>own</b> reinterpretation of the k'atun prophecies when they visited Nojpetén at this time, to convince the current Aj Kan Ek' and his Maya priesthood that the time for conversion had come. But the Itza priesthood interpreted the prophecies differently, and the missionaries were fortunate to escape with their lives. In 1695 the colonial authorities decided to connect the province of Guatemala with Yucatán, and Guatemalan soldiers conquered a number of Ch'ol communities, the most important being Sakb'ajlan on the Lacantún River in eastern Chiapas, now in Mexico, which was renamed as Nuestra Señora de Dolores, or Dolores del Lakandon. The Franciscan friar Andrés de Avendaño oversaw a second attempt to overcome the Itza in 1695, convincing the Itza king that the K'atun 8 Ajaw, a twenty-year Maya calendrical cycle beginning in 1696 or 1697, was the right time for the Itza to finally embrace Christianity and to accept the king of Spain as overlord. However the Itza had local Maya enemies who resisted this conversion, and in 1696 Avendaño was fortunate to escape with his life. The Itza's continued resistance had become a major embarrassment for the Spanish colonial authorities, and soldiers were despatched from Campeche to take Nojpetén once and for all.|$|E
