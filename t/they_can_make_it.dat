25|$|The army is decimated, {{leaving a}} {{demoralized}} Connacht planning {{to return to}} Gower. However, he is prevented by Damas and Myrdred, who suggests they find Mazzarin. Legend claims Bahl'al killed Mazzarin centuries ago, but Myrdred believes him to be still living. The trio {{set out to find}} him, accompanied by Ravanna, a Myrmidon warrior. Entering his crypt, Mazzarin is initially uninterested in helping them. However, impressed by Connacht, he transfers his knowledge of the Total Codex, a book that tells of future events, into Connacht's mind. In Llancarfan, Connacht speaks to the dwarven Smiths of Muirthemne about creating a magical device that could imprison infinite enemies. Forgemaster Traval says <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>it,</b> but they need their tome of building from Myrgard, which is currently under siege by Ghôls. Connacht leads an army to lift the siege, annihilating the Ghôls. The Dwarves form an alliance with humanity, and give Connacht the tome. In Llancarfan, the Smiths build Connacht a Tain; a small magical device containing a pocket universe of limitless capacity, capable of sweeping an infinite number of enemies inside it. With the Tain in hand, Connacht and a small contingent of men head to the Dire Marsh, and wipe out the Myrkirida.|$|E

60|$|The clergy ought {{especially}} {{to lead the}} way in this reformation. They have erred grievously in perverting history to their own purposes. What was a sin in others was in them a blasphemy, because they professed to acknowledge God as the Ruler of the world, and hereby they showed that they valued their own conclusions above the facts which reveal His order. They owe, therefore, a great amende to their country, and they should consider seriously how <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> most effectually.

If you won't mind my giving you a bit of advice, I should say don't try to push yourself forward. Sometimes young fellows spoil their chances by doing so. Some of the old non-commissioned officers feel a bit jealous when they see a youngster likely to make his way up, and you know <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> very hot for a fellow if they like.

Lady Vavasour describes one of these wagons in the following graphic manner:--"The perch is moveable, and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> any length they please; it is of so simple a construction that every farmer can repair his own, and make anything of it. If he has a perch, a pole, and four wheels, that is enough; with a little ingenuity, he makes it carry stones, hay, earth, or anything he wants, by putting a plank at each side. When he wants a carriage for pleasure, he fits it up for that purpose; his moveable perch allows him to make it anything. I counted seventeen grown persons sitting side by side, looking most happy, in one of them, drawn only by a pair of small horses, and in this hilly country." ...|$|E

Introduction: Recent fluctuations in the unemployment rate, as measured by the Household Labour Force Survey (HLFS), have provoked commentator concern about the robustness of this official measure. Debate over job losses, job creation, employment rates and other indicators of the condition of the labour market often creates more confusion than it sheds light on the situation.

60|$|I {{have now}} {{finished}} laying before the House the constitutional settlement, and I {{should like to}} say that our proposals are interdependent. They must be considered as a whole; they must be accepted or rejected as a whole. I say this in no spirit of disrespect to the Committee, because evidently it is a matter which the Executive Government should decide on its own responsibility; and if the policy which we declare were changed, new men would have to be found to carry out another plan. We are prepared to make this settlement {{in the name of the}} Liberal Party. That is sufficient authority for us; but there is a higher authority which we should earnestly desire to obtain. I make no appeal, but I address myself particularly to the right hon. gentlemen who sit opposite, who are long versed in public affairs, and who will not be able all their lives to escape from a heavy South African responsibility. They are the accepted guides of a Party which, though in a minority in this House, nevertheless embodies nearly half the nation. I will ask them seriously whether they will not pause before they commit themselves to violent or rash denunciations of this great arrangement. I will ask them, further, whether they cannot join with us to invest the grant of a free Constitution to the Transvaal with something of a national sanction. With all our majority we can only make it the gift of a Party; <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> the gift of England. And if that were so, I am quite sure that all those inestimable blessings which we confidently hope will flow from this decision, will be gained more surely and much more speedily; and the first real step will have been taken to withdraw South African affairs from the arena of British party politics, in which they have inflicted injury on both political parties and in which they have suffered grievous injury themselves. I ask that that may be considered; but in any case we are prepared to go forward alone, and Letters Patent will be issued in strict conformity with the settlement I have explained this afternoon if we should continue to enjoy the support of a Parliamentary majority.|$|E
6000|$|Others have a {{complete}} mastery over their mental images. They can call up {{the figure of a}} friend and make it sit on a chair or stand up at will; <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> turn round and attitudinise in any way, as by mounting it on a bicycle or compelling it to perform gymnastic feats on a trapeze. They are able to build up elaborate geometric structures bit by bit in their mind's eye, and add, subtract, or alter at will and at leisure. This free action of a vivid visualising faculty is of much importance in connection with the higher processes of generalised thought, though it is commonly put to no such purpose, as may be easily explained by an example. Suppose a person suddenly to accost another with the following words:-- [...] "I {{want to tell you about}} a boat." [...] What is the idea that the word [...] "boat" [...] would be likely to call up? I tried the experiment with this result. One person, a young lady, said that she immediately saw the image of a rather large boat pushing off from the shore, and that it was full of ladies and gentlemen, the ladies being dressed in white and blue. It is obvious that a tendency to give so specific an interpretation to a general word is absolutely opposed to philosophic thought. Another person, who was accustomed to philosophise, said that the word [...] "boat" [...] had aroused no definite image, because he had purposely held his mind in suspense. He had exerted himself not to lapse into any one of the special ideas that he felt the word boat was ready to call up, such as a skiff, wherry, barge, launch, punt, or dingy. Much more did he refuse to think of any one of these with any particular freight or from any particular point of view. A habit of suppressing mental imagery must therefore characterise men who deal much with abstract ideas; and as the power of dealing easily and firmly with these ideas is the surest criterion of a high order of intellect, we should expect that the visualising faculty would be starved by disuse among philosophers, and this is precisely what I found on inquiry to be the case.|$|E
