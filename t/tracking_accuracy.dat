40|$|When {{tracking}} {{a target}} particle that is interacting with nearest neighbors in a known way, positional {{data of the}} neighbors {{can be used to}} improve the state estimate. Effects of the accuracy of such positional data on the target <b>track</b> <b>accuracy</b> are investigated in this paper, in the context of dusty plasmas. In kinematic simulations, notable improvement in the target <b>track</b> <b>accuracy</b> was found when including all nearest neighbors in the state estimation filter and tracking algorithm, whereas the <b>track</b> <b>accuracy</b> was not significantly improved by higher-accuracy measurement techniques. The state estimation algorithm, involving an extended Kalman filter, was shown to either remove or significantly reduce errors due to "pixel locking". It is concluded that the significant extra complexity and computational expense to achieve these relatively small improvements are likely to be unwarranted for many situations. For the purposes of determining the precise particle locations, it is concluded that the simplified state estimation algorithm can be a viable alternative to using more computationally-intensive measurement techniques.

40|$|Exploitation of {{external}} knowledge through constrained filtering guarantees improved performance. In this paper we show how multiscan processing of such information further enhances the <b>track</b> <b>accuracy.</b> This {{can be achieved}} using a Fixed- Lag Smoothing procedure, and a proof of improvement is given in terms of entropy reduction. Such multiscan algorithm, i. e. named KB-Smoother [1], can be implemented {{by means of a}} SIR-PF. In practice, the SIRPF suffers from depletion problems, which are further amplified by the Smoothing technique. Sequential MCMC methods represent an efficient alternative to the standard SIR-PF approach. Furthermore, by borrowing techniques from genetic algorithms, a fully parallelizable multitarget tracker can be defined. Such approach, i. e. named Interacting Population (IP) -MCMC-PF, was first introduced in [2]. In this paper, we propose and analyze a combination of the KB-Smoother along with the IP-MCMC-PF. As will be shown, the combination of the two methods yields an improved <b>track</b> <b>accuracy</b> while mitigating the loss of particles diversity.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedProliferation of theater ballistic missile technologies to potential U. S. adversaries necessitates that the U. S. employ a defensive system to counter this threat. The {{system that is}} being developed is called the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) "System of Systems". The SBIRS Low component of the SBIRS "System of Systems" will track strategic and theater ballistic missiles from launch to reentry and relay necessary cueing data to missile interceptors before the missiles reach friendly forces or countries whose safety is a vital interest to the U. S. SBIRS Low {{has a number of}} critical system requirements that for any given satellite are mutually exclusive for the length of time needed to complete the specified tasking. This limitation implies a system capacity on the total number of ballistic objects the SBIRS Low system can track at any given time. Applying exploratory model analysis, the SBIRS Low model uses the Monte Carlo method to explore large regions of the model space to identify key factors in the system and to provide insight into different tasking schemes for individual satellites. The exploratory model analysis, which consisted of 13, 760, 000 missiles being tracked in the analysis of the CSS- 2 and M- 9 missiles, yielded the following significant results: (a) defining the "best" satellite is nontrivial, (b) the SBIRS Low system was unable to initiate a booster track for an unacceptably large percentage of M- 9 missiles launched near the equator, (c) if the system anticipates a long delay in revisiting a track, a stereo view should be scheduled immediately {{prior to the start of}} the delay, (d) mono viewing alone does not provide the required <b>track</b> <b>accuracy,</b> (e) <b>track</b> <b>accuracy</b> is a function of missile classification, and (f) the instantaneous <b>track</b> <b>accuracy</b> versus sensor revisit rate does not fit an well-known probability distribution[URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we present methods for {{measuring}} hindered Brownian motion in the confinement of complex 3 D geometries using digital video microscopy. Here we discuss essential features of automated 3 D particle tracking as well as diffusion data analysis. By introducing local mean squared displacement-vs-time curves, {{we are able to}} simultaneously measure the spatial dependence of diffusion coefficients, <b>tracking</b> <b>accuracies</b> and drift velocities. Such local measurements allow a more detailed and appropriate description of strongly heterogeneous systems as opposed to global measurements. Finite size effects of the tracking region on measuring mean squared displacements are also discussed. The use of these methods was crucial for the measurement of the diffusive behavior of spherical polystyrene particles (505 nm diameter) in a microfluidic chip. The particles explored an array of parallel channels with different cross sections as well as the bulk reservoirs. For this experiment we present the measurement of local <b>tracking</b> <b>accuracies</b> in all three axial directions as well as the diffusivity parallel to the channel axis while we observed no significant flow but purely Brownian motion.
