30|$|It is {{also noticed}} that {{cracking}} damage is unavoidable for the conventional RC <b>CASE</b> <b>pile</b> under daily service loads. Moreover to prevent possible energy leakage, relative {{high degree of}} the hoop reinforcement ratio (2.5 –[*] 3.5 %) is required, which might cause congestion of the reinforcement inside the pile foundation. Therefore, alternative solutions can be further explored for the <b>CASE</b> <b>pile</b> to prevent the service level cracking including (1) adopting ultra high performance concrete (Bektimirova et al. 2017); and (2) using double-tube steel pile with concrete infills (Agibayeva et al. 2018).|$|R
