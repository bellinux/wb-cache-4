50|$|In the International Court of Justice case Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v. Italy), {{the court}} {{ruled in favor of}} state immunity.

The decision was criticized by some commentators for not embracing a nascent development <b>to</b> <b>waive</b> <b>immunity</b> in cases of human rights violations. However, others pointed out that the decision reflected the consensus of actual international custom and practice.|$|E

50|$|It is {{possible}} for the official's home country to waive immunity; this tends to happen only when the individual has committed a serious crime, unconnected with their diplomatic role (as opposed to, say, allegations of spying), or has witnessed such a crime. However, many countries refuse <b>to</b> <b>waive</b> <b>immunity</b> {{as a matter of}} course; individuals have no authority to waive their own immunity (except perhaps in cases of defection). Alternatively, the home country may prosecute the individual. If immunity is waived by a government so that a diplomat (or their family members) can be prosecuted, it must be because there is a case to answer and it is in the public interest to prosecute them. For instance, in 2002, a Colombian diplomat in London was prosecuted for manslaughter, once diplomatic immunity was waived by the Colombian government.|$|E

5000|$|Different {{kinds of}} {{immunity}} {{can provide an}} absolute defence.

50|$|The Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal ruled 3:2 {{that the}} Congo {{government}} had not waived its immunity in the Hong Kong courts, {{and that as}} a Special Administrative Region of China, Hong Kong could not have policies on state immunity that was inconsistent with China’s. Therefore, the doctrine of sovereign immunity applied in Hong Kong should be absolute, and may be invoked when jurisdiction is sought in the foreign court in relation to an application to enforce a foreign judgment or arbitral award, or when execution is sought against assets in the foreign state. This means that sovereign states are absolutely immune to the jurisdiction in Hong Kong courts, including in commercial claims, unless the state waives its immunity. In order <b>to</b> <b>waive</b> <b>immunity,</b> there must be express, unequivocal submission to {{the jurisdiction of the}} Hong Kong courts “in the face of the court. Claimants should establish that the state party has waived their entitlement to immunity at the relevant stage, before proceedings can occur in court.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, the Diplomatic Relations Act of 1978 ( [...] et seq.) {{follows the}} {{principles}} {{introduced by the}} Vienna Conventions. The United States tends to be generous when granting diplomatic immunity to visiting diplomats, because {{a large number of}} U.S. diplomats work in host countries less protective of individual rights. If the United States were to punish a visiting diplomat without sufficient grounds, U.S. representatives in other countries could receive harsher treatment. If a person with immunity is alleged to have committed a crime or faces a civil lawsuit, the State Department asks the home country <b>to</b> <b>waive</b> <b>immunity</b> of the alleged offender so that the complaint can be moved to the courts. If immunity is not waived, prosecution cannot be undertaken. However, the State Department still has the right to expel the diplomat. In many such cases, the diplomat's visas are canceled, and he and his family may be barred from returning to the United States. Crimes committed by members of a diplomat's family can also result in dismissal.|$|E
50|$|On 9 May 2014, Rizalman {{was arrested}} by the New Zealand Police after {{following}} a 21-year old Wellington woman home and allegedly assaulting her. The following day, he appeared in the Wellington District Court and was charged with burglary and intent to rape, which carry a ten-year prison sentence. Rizalman claimed diplomatic immunity and was {{allowed to return to}} Malaysia on 22 May 2014. While the New Zealand Government has asserted that it wanted Rizalman to remain in the country to face trial, miscommunication between Malaysian and New Zealand officials led the Malaysian Government to believe that the New Zealand Government would not object to repatriating Rizalman and trying him before a Malaysian military court. According to the Malaysian Foreign Minister Anifah Aman, the Malaysian Government was always willing <b>to</b> <b>waive</b> <b>immunity</b> and to allow Rizalman to be tried in New Zealand. Details of the case were not divulged to the general public until early July 2014. Following his return to Malaysia, Rizalman was checked into a Malaysian military hospital for psychiatric evaluation. He was also scheduled to face a military board of inquiry and potentially a court martial.|$|E

5000|$|The law of {{sovereign}} immunity connotes that a state, unless it chooses <b>to</b> <b>waive</b> its <b>immunity,</b> is {{immune to the}} jurisdiction of foreign courts and the enforcement of court orders.

5000|$|For this purpose, the Act {{goes on to}} {{prescribe}} the test of allowable claims, which is, [...] "The United States shall be liable [...] [...] [...] {{in the same manner}} and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances[...] [...]," [...] with certain exceptions not material here. [...] It will be seen {{that this is not the}} creation of new causes of action but acceptance of liability under circumstances that would bring private liability into existence. This, we think, embodies the same idea that its English equivalent enacted in 1947 [...] expressed, [...] "Where any person has a claim against the Crown after the commencement of this Act, and, if this Act had not been passed, the claim might have been enforced, subject to the grant [...] [...] [...]" [...] of consent to be sued, the claim may now be enforced without specific consent. One obvious shortcoming in these claims is that plaintiffs can point to no liability of a [...] "private individual" [...] even remotely analogous to that which they are asserting against the United States. We know of no American law which ever has permitted a soldier to recover for negligence, against either his superior officers or the Government he is serving. Nor is there any liability [...] "under like circumstances," [...] for no private individual has power to conscript or mobilize a private army with such authorities over persons as the Government vests in echelons of command. The nearest parallel, even if we were to treat [...] "private individual" [...] as including a state, would be the relationship between the states and their militia. But if we indulge plaintiffs the benefit of this comparison, claimants cite us no state, and we know of none, which has permitted members of its militia to maintain tort actions for injuries suffered in the service, and in at least one state the contrary has been held to be the case. It is true that if we consider relevant only a part of the circumstances and ignore the status of both the wronged and the wrongdoer in these cases we find analogous private liability. In the usual civilian doctor and patient relationship, there is of course a liability for malpractice. And a landlord would undoubtedly be held liable if an injury occurred to a tenant as the result of a negligently maintained heating plant. But the liability assumed by the Government here is that created by [...] "all the circumstances," [...] not that which a few of the circumstances might create. We find no parallel liability before, and we think no new one has been created by, this Act. Its effect is <b>to</b> <b>waive</b> <b>immunity</b> from recognized causes of action and was not to visit the Government with novel and unprecedented liabilities. The relationship between the Government and members of its armed forces is [...] "distinctively federal in character," [...] as this Court recognized in United States v. Standard Oil Co., [...] wherein the Government unsuccessfully sought to recover for losses incurred by virtue of injuries to a soldier.|$|E
40|$|The U. S. Supreme Court's recent {{revival of}} state {{sovereign}} immunity is usually {{cited as a}} significant development in modern U. S. federalism. These decisions giving states a powerful defense against lawsuits lead to the question: How will the states react to the Court's rulings? How likely is it that states will consent to be sued? This article discusses {{the consequences of the}} Court's sovereign immunity rulings specifically concerning state legislative debates over immunity waiver bills. It explains why some states have been willing <b>to</b> <b>waive</b> <b>immunity,</b> despite the Court majority's fears of a flood of lawsuits if states did not enjoy immunity.

40|$|In 2006, three {{disagreements}} {{about the}} scope of immunity for governmental entities were considered by the U. S. Supreme Court. Governmental entities were seeking to avoid liability for their actions, claiming the defense of sovereign immunity. Other lawsuits involving governmental immunity under state constitutional and statutory provisions disclose controversies concerning the responsibilities of governments to injured persons. The complicated jurisprudence governing immunity for governmental entities shows two alternatives for legislatures. They {{have the ability to}} increase liability by waiving immunity or to add defenses that defeat liability. The trend seems to be <b>to</b> <b>waive</b> <b>immunity</b> for governmental entities while adding statutory defenses that are available to both the private sector and governmental entities.

25|$|Justice Douglas {{asserted}} {{that there should}} be no distinction made between prospective relief and retrospective relief, as the drain on the state's treasury is the same in either case. He also strongly contended that Illinois had <b>waived</b> its <b>immunity</b> by entering the federal program, because the Court had recently found other states <b>to</b> have <b>waived</b> <b>immunity</b> by joining similar programs. Therefore, Douglas reasoned that Illinois had to have been aware of the possibility that entering the program would <b>waive</b> its own <b>immunity,</b> and its decision to participate in light of that danger showed a willingness to be held liable.|$|R

40|$|Professor Epstein {{has long}} {{promoted}} replacing tort-based malpractice law {{with a new}} regime based on contracts. In Mortal Peril, he grounded his normative {{arguments in favor of}} such a shift in the positive, doctrinal history of charitable immunity law. In this essay, in three parts, I critique Professor Epstein’s suggestion that a faulty set of interpretations in charitable immunity law led to our current reliance on tort for malpractice claims. First, I offer an alternative interpretation to Professor Epstein’s claim that one group of 19 th and early 20 th century cases demonstrates a misguided effort to protect donor wishes. Rather, I maintain that these cases make more sense when understood in the context of trust law. Second, I argue that another group of cases — cases based on indigent patients’ implied waivers of tort rights in exchange for charitable services — is not best understood as being based on implied contracts, as Professor Epstein claims. Rather, these cases are better understood as enforcing tort privileges that arise from the charitable status of the defendant. Finally, I critique Professor Epstein’s contention that a charity’s ability <b>to</b> <b>waive</b> <b>immunity</b> for some or all plaintiffs reveals that immunity doctrine more comfortably fits with contract theories than tort theories...|$|E

2500|$|The {{government}} had argued, {{and the majority}} had agreed, that the tax was not burdensome.

While the federal government has the right <b>to</b> <b>waive</b> its <b>immunity,</b> this did not mean that all taxes on the federal government were automatically valid until the government asserted its immunity, McReynolds said.

40|$|The Supreme Court’s 1950 Feres v. United States {{decision}} {{held that}} when it enacted the Federal Tort Claims Act Congress did not intend <b>to</b> <b>waive</b> sovereign <b>immunity</b> for injuries {{to members of the}} military arising out of activity incident to their service. The Court’s decision was influenced by the long history of efforts to enact a general tort claims bill that would free Congress from the burden of processing claims against the government, as well as the case law, statutes, and procedures pertaining to service-members’ injuries prior to enactment of the Federal Tort Claims Act. This Article examines those influences and the early cases that analyzed the incident to service issue under the Act, including the Court’s Brooks decision that allowed service-member suits for injuries that did not arise incident to service. The Article reviews the lower courts’ decisions in the three cases that were consolidated in Feres and the parties’ briefing in the Supreme Court. The Article addresses arguments that have been raised against Feres’ reasoning, arguments that independently attack its holding, and various characterizations of the opinion. Because of the language of the Federal Tort Claims Act, the historical backdrop to the Court’s decision, and the absence of any indication that Congress intended <b>to</b> <b>waive</b> sovereign <b>immunity</b> for injuries suffered incident to service, Feres correctly decided that the Federal Tort Claims Act did not encompass such injuries...|$|R
