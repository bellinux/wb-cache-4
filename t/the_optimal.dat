25|$|In {{optimization}} problems, heuristic algorithms {{can be used}} to find {{a solution}} close to <b>the</b> <b>optimal</b> solution in cases where finding <b>the</b> <b>optimal</b> solution is impractical. These algorithms work by getting closer and closer to <b>the</b> <b>optimal</b> solution as they progress. In principle, if run for an infinite amount of time, they will find <b>the</b> <b>optimal</b> solution. Their merit is that they can find a solution very close to <b>the</b> <b>optimal</b> solution in a relatively short time. Such algorithms include local search, tabu search, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms. Some of them, like simulated annealing, are non-deterministic algorithms while others, like tabu search, are deterministic.

Assume that the investor adopts the mean-variance criterion and trades continuously {{in a market}} consisting of one risk-free asset and one risky asset; {{and the price of}} the risky asset and the value of the exogenous liability are governed by geometric Brownian motions. An extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is derived, and the analytical expressions of <b>the</b> time-consistent <b>optimal</b> portfolio strategy and the mean-variance efficient frontier are obtained. A numerical example is provided to show the results. Our main findings are: (1) introducing an exogenous liability makes <b>the</b> time-consistent <b>optimal</b> portfolio strategy be a stochastic process; (2) the efficient frontier under <b>the</b> time-consistent <b>optimal</b> strategy for asset-liability management is below both the one under <b>the</b> time-consistent <b>optimal</b> strategy in <b>the</b> case of no liability and the one under <b>the</b> pre-commitment <b>optimal</b> strategy for asset-liability management...|$|R
