40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation on micromilling of fully sintered Zirconia ceramics {{by means of}} advanced cutting tools, including cBN and diamond coated mills. Zirconium oxide is selected because of its high hardness, resistance to wear, heat and chemicals. <b>Two-flute</b> <b>end</b> <b>mills</b> of nominal diameter 1 mm and negative rake angle were used. The effect of the coating and tool material, along with the cutting parameters, were investigated {{by means of a}} one-factor variation experimental design; and the responses of interest, including tool wear and sample surface quality, were monitored over the machining time. The worn tools and the machined surfaces were also analyzed on a SEM to investigate the type of material removal mechanisms (MRM). The diamond coated tools provide the best performance in terms of life time, however delamination of the diamond coating followed by wear of the underlying hardmetal is identified as the prevailing tool wear mechanism. A ductile type of material removal mechanism could be observed, inducing an achievable surface roughness below 60 nm. On the contrary, cBN tools exhibited fast breakage. A combined ductile-brittle material removal mechanism occurs, resulting in a surface roughness around 300 nm...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of this work is to compare the performance of uncoated micro <b>end</b> <b>mills</b> with micro <b>end</b> <b>mills</b> coated using various pretreatments and diamond coatings. Testing is conducted with 300 -um-diameter, <b>two-flute,</b> carbide <b>end</b> <b>mills</b> cutting full-width slots in 6061 -T 6 aluminum. The comparison of these tools is conducted with a robustness test where the feed rate of the tool is increased every 5 mm of linear travel until catastrophic tool failure occurs. The outcomes from these tests are the maximum chipload, therefore material removal rate, and the maximum force experienced by the tool. It has been determined that tools pre- treated with an acid etch have a statistically lower maximum chipload than as-received tools. However, all other pretreatments and as-received tools had statistically equivalent maximum chiploads. Further improvements in the robustness testing method are needed to reduce data scatter and better test for differences in the tool coating methods...|$|R

The effect of dynamic response of the <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> tool is studied with and without the application of MR damper. Metal cutting operation involves interaction of cutting forces of the tool with the regenerative forces of the material of work piece during metal cutting. To control the <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> tool vibration and suppress the chatter, the method incorporates the unique features of a magnetic-rheological fluid, utilizes the damper input current to modify the magnetic field inside the coil of the damper and increase the variable stiffness and produce damping effect. In this work, the identification of chatter is done by means of the Bingham number of the magnetic-rheological fluid. The different metal cutting parameters are considered in experimental work and results are compared with and without the application of magnetic-rheological damping effect. The results show the enhancement of quality of the machined surface, reduction of deflection of the <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> tool and decrease in the chatter marks on work piece by producing magnetic-rheological damping to the <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> tool.

Micro nozzle is one of key parts of the micro thruster. The surface roughness of its inner surface significantly influences the thrust performance of the thruster. In this paper, a residual surface model is developed for micro-nozzle obtained by micro machining using a ball <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> and a taper <b>end</b> <b>mill.</b> The residual surface model is then used to investigate {{the relationship between the}} surface quality and nozzle thrust performance in nozzle flow field. A thrust measuring apparatus is designed and manufactured to inspect the thrust performance of the machined micro nozzles. Both simulation and experiment results indicate that good machined surface quality is obtained with taper <b>end</b> <b>mill.</b> The nozzle machined with the taper <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> has better thrust performance than that with the ball <b>end</b> <b>mill</b> under the same inlet pressure...|$|R

An {{integrated}} system of geometric modeling and machining simulation of <b>end</b> <b>mills</b> is presented for supporting <b>end</b> <b>mill’s</b> cutting analysis, structural optimization and digital manufacturing. In {{order to obtain}} accurate structural models, the main elements and detail features of <b>end</b> <b>mills</b> are modeled precisely, based on modular design and parametric design methodology. Through integrates 2 D tool path and 3 D virtual machining simulation seamlessly, a comprehensive simulation platform is constructed. To ensure the accuracy of manufacturing simulation model, the machining simulation model is compared to ideal design model. The results verify the correctness and rationality of the geometric modeling and machining simulation. NC codes generated by machining simulation can be output to tool grinder, supporting digital manufacturing of <b>end</b> <b>mills...</b>|$|R

The surface roughness of the work piece and tool wear was analyzed in this. The design of experiments (DOE) approach using Response surface methodology was implemented to optimize the cutting parameters of a computer numerical control (CNC) <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> machine. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) was adapted to identify the most influential factors on the CNC <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> process. The mathematical predictive model developed for surface roughness and tool wear in terms of cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut. The cutting speed {{is found to be}} the most significant factor affecting the surface roughness of work piece and tool wear in <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> process...|$|R
