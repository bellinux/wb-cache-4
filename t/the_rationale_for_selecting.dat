40|$|Purpose: This paper aims to {{identify}} different organisation modes for international property investments and analyse <b>the</b> <b>rationales</b> <b>for</b> <b>selecting</b> each mode. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reports {{the findings of}} an interview study conducted among international investors in the Finnish property market. Findings: The study identifies four main organisation modes for international property investments, the selection of each mode being dependent of the investors’ perception of the informational barriers and local nature of the property market. Most of the interviewed investors also apply the same strategy in other markets they invest in, and thus {{the selection of the}} organisation mode seems not to be very dependent on the characteristics of the investment market. Research limitations/implications: The paper analyses the organisation modes and their selection criteria only in the Finnish market. Practical implications: The study indicates that informational barriers are still of major concern for the investors entering foreign markets. Thus, activities contributing to lowering these barriers would be beneficial for those markets wanting to attract international property investments. Originality/value: The study is the first to analyse the organisation modes of international property investors. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{energy system}} {{planning}} (UESP) {{is a topic}} of growing concern for cities in deregulated energy markets, which plan to decrease energy demand, reduce their dependency on fossil fuels, and increase the share of renewable energy sources. UESP being a highly multisectoral and multi-actor task, multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) methods are frequently used in the decision processes. These methods may provide support in organizing and identifying solutions to problems with conflicting objectives. However, knowing which method to use is generally not straightforward, as the appropriateness of a method or combination of methods depends on the decision problem’s context. Therefore, this article reviewed scientific papers to characterize and analyze MCDA problems and methods {{in the context of}} UESP. The review systematically explores issues such as the scope of the problems, the alternatives and criteria considered, the expected decision outcomes, the decision analysis methods and <b>the</b> <b>rationales</b> <b>for</b> <b>selecting</b> and combining them, and the role of values in driving the decision problems.

40|$|Our great {{reliance}} on software-based systems and services nowadays requires software {{products of the}} highest quality. An essential prerequisite for developing software of guaranteed quality in a predictable way {{is the ability to}} model and objectively assess its quality throughout the project lifecycle. A potential approach must handle the abstract and multidimensional character of quality. Analogies between software quality assessment (SQA) and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) motivated us to investigate how MCDA methods can support SQA. Thus we (1) identified the most relevant requirements for an SQA method, (2) reviewed existing SQA methods regarding potential benefits from using MCDA methods, and (3) assessed some popular MCDA methods regarding their applicability for SQA. We found that although a number of SQA methods proposed in recent years already adapt MCDA methods, <b>the</b> exact <b>rationales</b> <b>for</b> <b>selecting</b> a particular method are usually unclear or arbitrary. Usually, neither the goals nor the constraints of SQA are explicitly considered. Existing SQA methods do not meet the relevant requirements and mostly share the same weaknesses independent of whether they employ MCDA or not. In many cases, popular MCDA techniques are unsuitable for SQA because they do not meet its basic constraints, such as handling situations where data are scarce. We discuss the gaps identified in MCDA. The results led us to the conclusion that future research should focus on resolving the deficits of the existing SQA methods or of the most promising MCDA techniques rather than on inventing new methods from scratch...|$|R
40|$|CEA can be {{aided by}} the use of an {{expanded}} set of methods. Four examples include conceptual models, modified interaction matrices, networks, and adaptive management (AM) processes. Conceptual models range from summarized scientific knowledge to graphical depictions of environmental resources, their interrelationships, and potential changes resulting from multiple actions and stressors. Modified matrices and networks can be used to address connections between proposed actions, other actions and identified VECs. Step-wise approaches for developing modified matrices and networks are also described. The AM process, which can be used to reduce uncertainties and inform the science of CEA, is thoroughly described in a corollary paper. Accordingly, and based upon concepts and case studies involving conceptual models, matrices, and networks, it can be noted that there are numerous examples of these three types of methods being used in CEA studies. The examples could be directly used in other studies or appropriately modified to meet specific site and study needs. Documentation of <b>the</b> <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> methods, as well as their assumptions and key features, can facilitate the aggregation of best practices approaches. The included case studies, and their usage of these three types of methods, represent extensions of the use of similar tools for addressing the direct and indirect effects of singular proposed actions via the EIA process.

We also highlight how, as elite labour market intermediaries, headhunters are important, yet understudied, actors within the (re) production of a ‘softer’, ‘knowledgeable’ capitalism.

Here we review <b>the</b> background and <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> <b>selecting</b> neurocognitive tasks as endophenotypic measures in genetic studies. Criteria are outlined {{for the potential}} of measures as endophenotypic vulnerability markers. These include association with illness, state independence (ie, adequate test-retest stability, adequate between-site reliability, impairments in patients not due to medications, impairments observed regardless of illness state), heritability, findings of higher rates in relatives of probands than in the general population, and cosegregation within families. The COGS required that, in addition, the measures be “neurocognitive” and thus linked to neurobiology and that they be feasible in multisite studies. The COGS neurocognitive assessment includes measures of attention, verbal memory, working memory, and a computerized neurocognitive battery that also includes facial processing tasks. Here we describe data demonstrating that these neurobehavioral measures meet criteria for endophenotypic candidacy. We conclude that quantitative neurocognitive endophenotypes need further evidence for efficacy in identifying genetic effects but have the potential of providing unprecedented insight into gene-environment interaction related to dimensions of brain and behavior in health and disease...|$|R

40|$|Successful aging, {{the ability}} to resist age-associated {{illnesses}} and functional disability, is of increasing importance as the population ages. Studies have shown that exceptionally long-lived individuals fit the successful aging paradigm by compressing disability {{toward the end of}} life. This study investigated whether there is evidence of successful cognitive aging in a familial longevity cohort, the Long Life Family Study (LLFS). Part 1 describes the feasibility of conducting a 2. 5 hour neuropsychological battery emphasizing episodic memory and executive function, cognitive domains that elicit signs of cognitive dysfunction in relation to normal aging and dementia. <b>The</b> <b>rationale</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>selected</b> tests is discussed within the context of minimizing effects from sensory impairments in an aged cohort and optimizing qualitative and quantitative data. In Part 2, the testing of 70 proband generation and 100 offspring generation LLFS participants and 140 generation-matched referent participants without familial longevity is described. Comparison of LLFS proband generation participants with their referent cohort revealed no significant differences in test scores. However, the referent cohort also had more years of education (an important exposure which is discussed in Part 3). LLFS offspring generation participants had borderline significant better performance on a test of executive function (Clock Drawing Test) and attention (Digits Forward) compared with referents. These findings suggest that familial longevity is associated with better cognitive function even at relatively young ages. Continuing to follow these cohorts to older ages may reveal differences in rate of change in cognitive function. Part 3 examines the role of indicators of cognitive reserve. In the proband generation education and participation in mid- and late-life cognitively stimulating activities were found to be higher in the referent cohort. This suggests that people without familial longevity may be more reliant on higher cognitive reserve in order to achieve similar cognitive performance to those from long-lived families. Implications of preserved cognitive function in long-lived families and the effect of cognitive reserve in those without familial longevity are discussed in terms of compression of disability and successful cognitive aging...|$|R
