5|$|The Catholic Church {{sees the}} sacrament of {{confirmation}} as required to complete the grace given in baptism. When adults are baptised, confirmation is normally given immediately afterwards, a practice followed even with newly baptised infants in the Eastern Catholic Churches. In the West confirmation of children is delayed until they {{are old enough to}} understand or at the bishop's discretion. In Western Christianity, particularly Catholicism, the sacrament is called confirmation, because it confirms and strengthens the grace of baptism; in the Eastern Churches, it is called chrismation, because the essential rite is the anointing of the person with chrism, a mixture of olive oil and some perfumed substance, usually balsam, blessed by a bishop. Those who receive confirmation must be in a state of grace, which for those who have reached the age of reason means that they should first be cleansed spiritually by {{the sacrament of}} Penance; they should also have the intention of receiving the sacrament, and be prepared to show in <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>that</b> they are Christians.|$|E

25|$|His book, Fast Times at Ridgemont High: A True Story, {{came out}} in 1981. Crowe focused on six main characters: a tough guy, a nerd, a surfer dude, a sexual sophisticate, and a middle-class brother and sister. He chronicled their {{activities}} in typical teenage settings—at school, at the beach, and at the mall, where many of them held afterschool jobs—and focused on details of <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>that</b> probed {{into the heart of}} adolescence. This included scenes about homecoming and graduation as well as social cliques and sexual encounters.|$|E

25|$|Refugee {{children}} come {{from many different}} backgrounds, and their reasons for resettlement are even more diverse. The number of refugee children has continued to increase as conflicts interrupt communities at a global scale. In 2014 alone, there were approximately 32 armed conflicts in 26 countries around the world, and this period saw {{the highest number of}} refugees ever recorded Refugee children experience traumatic events in <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>that</b> can affect their learning capabilities, even after they have resettled in first or second settlement countries. Educators such as teachers, counselors, and school staff, along with the school environment, are key in facilitating socialization and acculturation of recently arrived refugee and immigrant children in their new schools.|$|E
25|$|In August 2005, elderly Daisy Fuller {{is on her}} deathbed in a New Orleans {{hospital}} as Hurricane Katrina approaches. She starts rambling to her daughter, Caroline, about a train station built in 1918 and Mr. Gateau, the best clockmaker {{in all of the}} South, who was hired to make a clock for it. Mr. Gateau was blind, and lost his son in World War I, which crushed him, but he continued to labor over his clock. When it was unveiled at the station, the public was surprised to see that the clock ran backwards, to which Mr. Gateau says he made it that way so that the boys they lost in the war could come back again and live <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>that</b> were ended too soon. After that, Mr. Gateau was never seen again, and people speculated he died of a broken heart or went out to sea.|$|E

25|$|On 24 May 1964, Peru hosted Argentina in the Estadio Nacional {{before a}} crowd of 47,157 for a {{qualifying}} match pertaining to the 1964 Olympic Games that were to be hosted in Tokyo. Argentina led the match 1–0 {{during the second half}} and in the final minutes Peru equalized; however the Uruguayan referee Ángel Eduardo Pazos disallowed the goal. The spectators were infuriated by the decision and this led to a pitch invasion. The police used tear gas and brutal force to quell the disturbances. The stadium's exits were closed which trapped the spectators inside the stadium. The players and referees had to be escorted off the field by the police. A riot ensued outside the stadium and led the President Fernando Belaúnde Terry to declare a state of emergency which would last for a month. Unfortunately, more than 300 people lost <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>that</b> day and left at least 4,000 injured. The tragedy led to the reduction of the stadium's capacity from 53,000 to 45,000.|$|E

What {{do you do if}} the couple think they're in love? It's less easy if the girl consents. ... The judges cannot do very much by themselves.

These statements, known as positive confessions, (distinct from confessions of sin) are said to miraculously change aspects of people's lives if spoken with faith. Prosperity churches also encourage people to [...] "live without limits" [...] and cultivate optimism about their lives. T. D. Jakes, pastor of The Potter's House non-denominational mega-church, has argued in favor of prosperity, rejecting {{what he sees as}} the demonization of success. He views poverty as a barrier to living a Christian life, suggesting that it is easier to make a positive impact on society when one is affluent.|$|E
500|$|One Day in History was {{launched}} {{as a part}} of History Matters, a campaign led by several heritage organisations such as the National Trust, English Heritage and the Historic Houses Association, in order to draw attention towards the importance of history in everyday life. Its aim was to record for posterity what day-to-day life was like in the UK during 2006. British people were invited to write a blog of what they did on 17 October 2006, and to submit it {{to become a part of}} a large online diary. The project was open to all UK citizens and individuals of British origin, and was inspired by Mass Observation, a similar social research project founded in 1937. The date was chosen to be 17 October by History Matters in the hope that it would be [...] "an ordinary day much like any other of no particular national significance", and would therefore reflect the everyday life of its participants. Historian Dan Snow explained that the project was intended to be [...] "a detailed account of people's normal lives when they're doing nothing out of the ordinary. ... It's those mundane details, those boring details that will seem extraordinary to people hundreds of years in the future." [...] The organisers hoped that the contributors could also discuss the impact of history or heritage on <b>their</b> <b>lives</b> <b>that</b> day in their submissions.|$|E

You know, I came to office as prime minister in 1997, focusing on domestic policy and ended up in four conflicts – Sierra Leone, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq. And it does change you, and so it should." [...] BBC political correspondent Norman Smith said Blair's severest critics would see the donation as [...] "guilt money" [...] for taking the UK to war against Iraq in 2003. The father of a soldier killed there decried the donation as [...] "blood money", while the father of another serviceman who died said Blair had a [...] "guilty conscience." [...] A spokesperson for the Stop the War Coalition supported with the donation, but added, [...] "No proportion of Tony Blair's massive and ill-gotten fortune can buy him innocence or forgiveness. He took this country to war on a series of lies against the best legal advice and in defiance of majority opinion." [...] A spokesman for Blair said that it had long been his intention to give the money to a charity; he added aiding soldiers undergoing rehabilitation at the Battle Back Challenge Centre was [...] "his way of honouring their courage and sacrifice." [...] The announcement was welcomed by Chris Simpkins, director general of The Royal British Legion, who said, [...] "Mr Blair's generosity is much appreciated and will help us to make a real and lasting difference to the lives of hundreds of injured personnel." ...|$|E
