5|$|In {{addition}} to accessories {{such as the}} Power Base Converter, the Sega Genesis supports two add-ons that each support their own game libraries. The first is the Sega CD (known as the Mega-CD in all regions except for North America), a compact disc-based peripheral that can play its library of games in CD-ROM format. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Sega 32X, a 32-bit peripheral which uses ROM cartridges {{and serves as a}} pass-through for Genesis games. Sega produced a custom power strip to fit the peripherals' large AC adapters. Both add-ons were officially discontinued in 1996.|$|E
5|$|In the lower-left {{corner of}} the {{painting}} holding a document bearing the royal seal, stands Bartolommeo Berrecci, architect who rebuilt Royal Wawel Castle. Next to him is Seweryn Boner, an important burgher and banker. His face {{is one of the}} two self-portraits of Jan Matejko. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> face of the royal jester Stańczyk. As Berrecci, Matejko portrayed himself as a gray eminence, dominating the scene, with a royal scepter in his hand.|$|E
5|$|Range {{queries are}} also straightforward. Once {{the ranks of}} the two values are known, the number of {{elements}} {{greater than or equal to}} the first value and less than <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> difference of the two ranks. This count can be adjusted up or down by one according to whether the endpoints of the range should be considered to be part of the range and whether the array contains keys matching those endpoints.|$|E

5|$|APOA5 mainly {{functions}} to influence plasma triglyceride levels. The first suggested mechanism supposes that APOA5 functions as an activator of lipoprotein lipase (which {{is a key}} enzyme in triglyceride catabolism) and, through this process, enhances the metabolism of TG-rich particles. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> possible effect of APOA5 on the secretion of VLDL particles, since APOA5 reduces hepatic production by inhibiting VLDL-particle production and assembly by binding to cellular membranes and lipids. Finally, the third possibility relates to the acceleration of the hepatic uptake of lipoprotein remnants {{and it has been}} shown that APOA5 binds to different members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family. In addition to its TG-lowering effect, APOA5 also plays a significant role in modulating HDL maturation and cholesterol metabolism. Increased APOA5 levels were associated with skewed cholesterol distribution from VLDL to large HDL particles. APOA5 mRNA is upregulated during liver regeneration and this suggests that APOA5 serves a function in hepatocyte proliferation. It’s also reported that APOA5 could enhance insulin secretion in beta-cells and the cell surface midkine could be involved in APOA5 endocytosis.|$|E
5|$|Swami Gnanapragasar {{believes}} that the first Ariyacakravarti also called Cinkaiariyan (Ariyan from Cinkainakar) was Kalinga Magha himself. Three main arguments are adduced to support the claim that these kings were of Eastern Ganga descent. The first is the similar device on their coins; the bull couchant and the crescent surmounting it were struck on coins issued by the Eastern Gangas and Ariyacakravartis. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> traditions of their origins are almost identical. The last is the assumption of titles Kangkainaadan (From the country of Ganges) and Kangkaiariyan (Ariyan from the Ganga dynasty). According to S. Pathmanathan's history of the Jaffna kingdom, these only establish similarity, but not any conclusive direct connections. Pathmanathan {{believes that}} we cannot categorically link the Aryacakravarti dynasty with Eastern Gangas and can explain most of the similarities based on influence, even Western Ganga Dynasty descendants who had moved into Tamil lands after their defeat by the Chola Empire around the year 1000 and interpret them simply as reflecting a claim of origin from the Hindu holy city of Varanasi {{on the banks of}} the holiest river Ganges.|$|E
5|$|The Roman army battled first {{against its}} tribal {{neighbours}} and Etruscan towns within Italy, and later came {{to dominate the}} Mediterranean and at its height the provinces of Britannia and Asia Minor. As with most ancient civilizations, Rome's military served the triple purpose of securing its borders, exploiting peripheral areas through measures such as imposing tribute on conquered peoples, and maintaining internal order. From the outset, Rome's military typified this pattern, {{and the majority of}} Rome's campaigns were characterised by one of two types. The first is the territorial expansionist campaign, normally begun as a counter-offensive, in which each victory brought subjugation of large areas of territory and allowed Rome to grow from a small town to a population of 55 million in the early empire when expansion was halted. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> civil war, which plagued Rome from its foundation to its eventual demise.|$|E
50|$|A {{couple of}} karts <b>were</b> sold under <b>the</b> Evans brand. <b>The</b> first <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Evans Special (or SPL). <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Evans Flyweight. <b>The</b> karts <b>were</b> {{known for their}} handling.|$|R

50|$|Charles Henry (1797-1877), Royal Navy officer; {{he married}} Jane Henrietta, {{daughter}} of George Ashburnham, 3rd Earl of Ashburnham, {{and they had}} six children, of whom <b>the</b> <b>second</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> poet Algernon Charles Swinburne.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{circular}} bodied plucked lute, the yueqin. Percussion instruments {{include the}} daluo, xiaoluo, and naobo. The {{player of the}} gu and ban, a small high pitch drum and clapper, is the conductor of the entire ensemble. The two main musical styles of Peking opera, Xipi and Erhuang, originally differed in subtle ways. In the Xipi style, the strings of the jinghu are tuned to the keys of A and D. The melodies in this style are very disjointed, possibly reflecting the style's derivation from the high and loud melodies of the Qinqiang opera of northwestern China. It is commonly used to tell joyous stories. In Erhuang, on the other hand, the strings are tuned to the keys of C and G. This reflects the low, soft, and despondent folk tunes of south-central Hubei province, the style's place of origin. As a result, it is used for lyrical stories. Both musical styles have a standard meter of two beats per bar. The two musical styles share six different tempos, including manban (a slow tempo), yuanban (a standard, medium-fast tempo), kuai sanyan ("leading beat"), daoban ("leading beat"), sanban ("rubato beat"), and yaoban ("shaking beat"). The xipi style also uses several unique tempos, including erliu ("two-six"), and kuaiban (a fast tempo). Of these tempos, yuanban, manban, and kuaiban are most commonly seen. The tempo {{at any given time}} is controlled by a percussion player who acts as director. Erhuang has been seen as more improvisational, and Xipi as more tranquil. The lack of defined standards among performance troupes and the passage of time may have made the two styles more similar to each other today.|$|E
