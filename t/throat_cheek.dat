40|$|On 8 May 1998 I {{observed}} a Red-throated Loon at Lake McConaughy in Keith County, Nebraska. I was scanning Arthur Bay when I spotted a small loon swimming with several Western Grebes. I immediately recognized the bird as a Red-throated Loon in basic plumage. I studied and photographed the bird from 2 : 25 to 3 : 13 p. m. The bird was slightly larger and shorter-necked than a Western Grebe. The plumage was quite plain. The <b>throat,</b> <b>cheek,</b> foreneck, and underparts were white. The forehead, crown, nape, mantle, and wings were dark gray {{with a few}} pale spots on the mantle. The bill was very short and thin and the lower mandible was angled upward, giving the bill an upturned appearance. The area surrounding the eye was white. The bird also held its head tilted slightly upward. The distinction between dark gray and white {{on the head and}} neck was less clearcut than on a Pacific Loon. I concluded that the bird was probably an adult in basic plumage because of the dark-backed appearance, although it is possible the bird was molting from first-basic to first-alternate plumage...|$|E

50|$|Juvenile birds {{often have}} a dark, brownish-grey nape which may look darker than the pale-edged black feathers. They have a dark grey to black head, neck, and upperparts, with white <b>throat,</b> <b>cheeks,</b> and underparts.

5000|$|Caruncles are carnosities, {{often of}} bright colors such as red, blue, yellow or white.

50|$|The female is {{slightly}} {{smaller than the}} male. Its contour plumage is cloudy silt in colouration. The mantle and breast are a dark sepia in coloration. The retrices are essentially {{similar to those of}} the male, exhibiting marked adumbrations and stunning ocelli. Throughout, their plumage is earthen and difficult to distinguish from the substrate and branches. While it has similar proportions of the tail to the male, its markings are not as visually arresting. Like the male, the female has a short crest and is whitish on the <b>throat,</b> <b>cheeks</b> and eyebrows.|$|R

5|$|Because Sitta przewalskii {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as a subspecies of the white-cheeked nuthatch, its description has often been made in comparison with it. Though both species lack the black eyestripe typical of other nuthatches, their coloring is distinct, with S. leucopsis being white- or creamy-buff on its <b>throat,</b> <b>cheeks,</b> breast, flanks and belly, where S. przewalskii has varying shades and concentrations of cinnamon. S. przewalskii is also the smaller of the two, and its bill is markedly thinner. Males and females of the species are nearly identical in appearance, except for the male's brighter cinnamon coloring.|$|R

50|$|Red-tailed amazons weigh around 425 g and are {{approximately}} 35 cm long. As expected from its common name, {{it has a}} broad red band on its tail, but as it largely {{is limited to the}} inner webs of the feathers, it is mainly visible from below or when the tail is spread open. Additionally, the tail has a broad yellow tip, and the outer rectrices are dark purplish-blue at the base. The remaining plumage is green, while the <b>throat,</b> <b>cheeks</b> and auriculars are purple-blue, the forecrown is red, and the retrices are broadly tipped dark blue. It has a yellowish bill with a blackish tip to the upper mandible, a pale gray eye ring, and orange irises. Juveniles have a duller plumage and a brown irises.|$|R

50|$|The eastern {{indigo snake}} has even blue-black dorsal and lateral scales, with some {{specimens}} having a reddish-orange to tan {{color on the}} <b>throat,</b> <b>cheeks,</b> and chin. This snake received its common name from the glossy iridescent ventral scales which {{can be seen as}} blackish-purple in bright light. This smooth-scaled snake is considered to be the longest native snake species in the United States. The longest recorded specimen measured 2.8 m. Unlike many snakes, mature male indigo snakes are slightly larger than females. A typical mature male measures 1.2 - 2.36 m, with a reported average of 1.58 m, and weighs 0.72 - 4.5 kg, reportedly averaging 2.2 kg. Meanwhile, a mature female typically measures around 1.1 - 2 m in length, averaging 1.38 m, and weighs 0.55 - 2.7 kg, averaging 1.5 kg. In specimens over 2.6 m, these snakes can weigh up to 5 kg. Although the indigo snake is similar in average body mass, extremely large specimens of the bulky, co-occurring venomous eastern diamondback rattlesnake can outweigh them.|$|R
50|$|The pelage (fur) is {{so dense}} {{that it can}} clog {{electric}} clippers. The ventral (chest) coat and throat are white or cream. The dorsal (back) coat varies from gray to rosy-brown, sometimes with a brown pygal patch around the tail region, where the fur grades to pale gray or grayish brown. The dorsal coloration is slightly darker around the neck and crown. The hair on the <b>throat,</b> <b>cheeks,</b> and ears is white or off-white and also less dense, allowing the dark skin underneath to show through. The muzzle is dark grayish and the nose is black, and the eyes are encompassed by black triangular patches. Facial vibrissae (whiskers) are developed and found above the lips (mystacal), on the cheeks (genal), and on the eyebrow (superciliary). Vibrissae are also found slightly above the wrist {{on the underside of}} the forearm. The ears are relatively large compared to other lemurs and are covered in hair, which has only small tufts if any. Although slight pattern variations in the facial region may be seen between individuals, there are no obvious differences between the sexes.|$|R

50|$|The horns have a {{transversal}} segmentation pattern due to seasonal growth (winter-summer). The head, <b>throat</b> and <b>cheeks</b> are a light cinnamon colour {{with a dark}} mask design that crosses the big eyes (Figure 1). The back, chest, legs and flanks are dark brown, while the shoulders and hindquarters are pale brown. In winter, the back and belly become paler in colour and the flanks darker, giving a more contrasting colour pattern (Figure 4). Juveniles exhibit a less contrasting colour pattern.|$|R
5000|$|The myrtle can be {{distinguished}} from Audubon's warbler by its whitish eyestripe, white (not yellow) <b>throat,</b> and contrasting <b>cheek</b> patch.

5000|$|The {{third stage}} is the paralytic stage and {{is caused by}} damage to motor neurons. Incoordination is seen due to rear limb {{paralysis}} and drooling and difficulty swallowing is caused by paralysis of facial and throat muscles. This disables the victim's ability to swallow, which causes saliva to pour from the mouth also the reason bites are the most clear way for the infection to spread is because the virus is most concentrated in the <b>throat</b> and <b>cheeks</b> causing major contamination to saliva. Death is usually caused by respiratory arrest.|$|R

50|$|Both sexes reach sexual {{maturity}} {{when they are}} two years old. Mating occurs throughout the year, but peaks between February and May. During mating season, young males bend their horns {{to the ground as}} if to poke the earth. Males fight in the water, their heads submerging in horn-to-horn combat, for dominance. These contests are usually short and violent. As in many other animals, the dominant male copulates with the female. A unique form of marking is seen with the start of mating. The male bends his head to the ground and urinates on his <b>throat</b> and <b>cheek</b> hair. He then rubs his dripping beard on the female's forehead and rump.|$|R
