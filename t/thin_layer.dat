5|$|Anatomically, {{the human}} {{cerebellum}} has {{the appearance of}} a separate structure attached {{to the bottom of the}} brain, tucked underneath the cerebral hemispheres. Its cortical surface is covered with finely spaced parallel grooves, in striking contrast to the broad irregular convolutions of the cerebral cortex. These parallel grooves conceal the fact that the cerebellar cortex is actually a continuous <b>thin</b> <b>layer</b> of tissue tightly folded in the style of an accordion. Within this <b>thin</b> <b>layer</b> are several types of neurons with a highly regular arrangement, the most important being Purkinje cells and granule cells. This complex neural organization gives rise to a massive signal-processing capability, but almost all of the output from the cerebellar cortex passes through a set of small deep nuclei lying in the white matter interior of the cerebellum.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, it {{is clear}} that <b>thin</b> <b>layers</b> play a {{fundamental}} {{role in the development of}} a new generation of SOFC (solid oxide fuel cell) and more specifically when operating at lower temperatures ≤ 700 °C. According to the role and specification of the <b>thin</b> <b>layers,</b> different deposition techniques can be adopted. A relatively sophisticated technique, Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) and a cheaper one, Chemical Bath Deposition (CBD), are presented and compared in the specific case of <b>thin</b> <b>layers</b> of yttria-doped ceria (YDC) which can play the role of electrolyte, interfacial layer or catalyst in SOFC devices.

Several million years later a <b>thin</b> <b>layer</b> of hypervelocity impact ejecta from the Sudbury impact event was deposited on the older, underlying, Gunflint Iron Formation, and the Rove was then deposited {{on top of}} the ejecta; it is estimated that at ground zero the earthquake generated by the meteor impact would have registered 10.2 on the Richter scale.|$|E

5|$|Microbial mats {{are areas}} of {{sediment}} stabilised {{by the presence}} of colonies of microbes that secrete sticky fluids or otherwise bind the sediment particles. They appear to migrate upwards when covered by a <b>thin</b> <b>layer</b> of sediment but this is an illusion caused by the colony's growth; individuals do not, themselves, move. If too thick a layer of sediment is deposited before they can grow or reproduce through it, parts of the colony will die leaving behind fossils with a characteristically wrinkled ("elephant skin") and tubercular texture.|$|E

The <b>thin</b> <b>layers,</b> which have a thickness of 300 to 700 nm, give rise to brilliant colors in refl ection.

40|$|We derive a {{model for}} the {{conduction}} in an -periodic structure containing highly conductive <b>thin</b> <b>layers.</b> The case of plane <b>thin</b> <b>layers</b> is first considered. It is shown that the resulting model displays an increased conductivity along the directions of the layers planes. The more involved case of tubular layers yields a similar result with an increase of the conductivity along the direction of the tubes, while the presence of highly conductive <b>thin</b> <b>layers</b> confined between spheres of -order radii does not increase the macroscopic conductivity in any direction. It seems that the presence of -periodic highly conductive <b>thin</b> <b>layers</b> determines an increase of the macroscopic conductivity in a certain direction only if these layers cover entirely segment lines of unity order having this direction...|$|R

In addition, there are also described methods of optical properties measurements (optical and interference microscopy and ellipsometry). The combination of interference microscope with digital camera was used for determination of refractive index.

5|$|The design used a <b>thin</b> <b>layer</b> of {{aluminum}} {{to protect the}} uranium from corrosion by the cooling water.

Once the radioactivity subsided, the slugs would be taken away and the plutonium extracted. After reviewing the two designs, the DuPont engineers chose the water-cooled one. In 1959 a patent for the reactor design would be issued in the name of Creutz, Ohlinger, Weinberg, Wigner, and Young.|$|E
