The accuracy, rapidity and generality are difficult to achieve in the E-test. This paper proposes a test method based on the characteristics of the E-test workstation of test handler for semiconductor, in which the whole test procedure is divided into two terminals: the control and the <b>test</b> <b>terminal.</b> The control terminal is integrated into the control system of test handler, while the <b>test</b> <b>terminal</b> is independently designed with generality for different semiconductor products. To achieve an ideal performance, the parallel work trait of E-test in this method is discussed.

40|$|A rising {{question}} {{today is}} whether or not wireless networks and terminals are at the border of being able to compete with the cellular phone service. A variety of terminals are available and citywide wireless networks are either already deployed or under deployment in many cities worldwide. Although voice over wireless networks already is up and running in many office buildings and hospitals, few have experimented with and tested the use of voice over IP in public wireless networks. In this thesis, a series of field experiments are conducted in ''Wireless Trondheim'', a city-sized wireless network. Through tests gathering information on voice quality, network capacity and other metrics critical for a voice service, differences between terminals and the state of the technology is presented. Using the network analysis tool IxChariot a selection of Wi-Fi enabled mobile terminals from Qtek and HTC are tested under different conditions and network loads. The tests unveil vast differences among the <b>tested</b> <b>terminals.</b> While some terminals are capable of handling multiple conversations at once (e. g. call waiting and teleconference functionality) others have trouble keeping the quality of a single conversation good enough for it to be of any value. Allover, the achieved voice quality for the <b>tested</b> <b>terminals</b> in the Wireless Trondheim network lies well below the quality of the GSM service. The radios on the mobile Wi-Fi terminals are strongly affected by interference in a densely populated outdoor environment, which makes it difficult to maintain good voice quality. The results obtained in the thesis indicate that the <b>tested</b> mobile <b>terminals</b> are not yet ready to deliver telephony over a shared outdoor wireless network with sufficient voice quality. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{immediate}} {{environment of}} the transmit (TX) and receive (RX) antennas, including the antenna casings and the users holding the antennas, has a strong impact on the propagation channel and thus on wireless systems. In this paper we experimentally evaluate a method that synthetically combines double-directional measurements of the propagation channel (without the user influence) with measured antenna patterns of antennas-plus-users, by comparing obtained sample results with direct measurements in the same environment. The measurements are done for a static microcell 8 X 4 MIMO scenario at 2. 6 GHz. A realistic user phantom was used together with a <b>test</b> <b>terminal</b> prototype with four antenna elements, {{and a number of}} different configurations and orientations of the phantom were tested. In average over all test cases, the mean signal power deviation between composite channel method and measurements was well within 1 dB. The composite method shows 6 % higher terminal antenna correlation but similar statistical distributions are the measured. The differences between the model and measurements for the strongest eigenvalue (relevant for MRC combining) was found to be within 1 dB above 10 % outage level. Relative deviations in the ergodic MIMO capacity were smaller than 10 %...|$|E
40|$|In der Hefezelle Saccharomyces cerevisiae werden die intrazellulären Ca 2 +-Konzentrationen durch Ca 2 +-Kanäle und ATPasen reguliert. Pmr 1, die Ca 2 +-ATPase des Golgi-Apparates, bildet einen Eckpfeiler der Ca 2 +-Homöostase. So erfolgt nach einem raschen Anstieg der freien zytosolischen Ca 2 +-Konzentration, z. B. durch das Öffnen von Mid 1 /Cch 1 Ca 2 +- Kanälen in der Plasmamembran ein aktives Entfernen von Ca 2 + aus dem Zytosol. Pmr 1 transportiert sowohl Ca 2 + als auch Mn 2 + aus dem Zytosol in den Golgi-Apparat. Künstlich erzeugte Funktionsstörungen dieser Transporter haben für eine Zelle weitreichende Konsequenzen. Eine pmr 1 -Mutation ist nicht letal, aber sie verursacht einen schnellen Verlust der Lebensfähigkeit in stationärer Phase. In dieser Arbeit wurde gezeigt, dass diese Zellen typische Merkmale der Apoptose aufweisen. Der Apoptoseprozess ist morphologisch durch die Aufhebung der asymmetrischen Verteilung der Phospholipide der Plasmamembran, die Kondensation des Chromatins an der Kernhülle und die Zellfragmentierung in so genannte apoptotische Körper gekennzeichnet. Da Pmr 1 für die korrekte Physiologie des Golgi-Apparates benötigt wird und somit eine zentrale Komponente der Sekretionsmaschine ist, wurde bei weiteren Sekretionsmutanten nach apoptosetypischen Merkmalen gesucht. Die meisten sec-Mutationen sind letal. Bei konditionellen ts sec-Mutanten konnte unter restriktiver Temperatur Chromatinkondensation durch Anfärben mit Diaminophenylindol, einem selektiven, blau fluoreszierenden und in DNA interkalierenden Farbstoff, gezeigt werden. Um die Degradation der DNA nachzuweisen wurde der TUNEL <b>Test</b> (<b>terminal</b> deoxynucleotidyl {{transferase}} mediated dUTP nick end labeling) angewandt. Der Zustand der Plasmamembran wurde mit Annexin V aufgezeigt. In diesem Zusammenhang konnte auch gezeigt werden, dass eine Mutation in dem Ca 2 +-Transporter des Golgi-Apparates Pmr 1 zu drastischen Veränderungen in der Zellwand führen. Eine starke Reduktion der totalen Zellwandmasse und eine Verschiebung der zuckerhaltigen Zellwandkomponenten Glukose, Mannose und N-Acetylglucosamin liegen vor. In pmr 1 -Mutanten ist auch die Konzentration der katalytischen Untereinheit der &# 946;- 1, 3 Glukansynthase, einem Schlüsselenzym der Zellwandsynthese, stark erhöht. Diese Änderung des pmr 1 -Expressionsmusters wurde mit Hilfe eines Fks 2 /LacZ-Reporters detektiert. Weiterführend wurde eine genetische Methode entwickelt, um in Verbindung mit pmr 1 synthetisch letale Mutationskombinationen zu identifizieren. Als genetische Interaktionspartner von Pmr 1 wurden dadurch die proteinglycosylierende Golgi-Apyrase Ynd 1 und eine Komponente des Mannosylpolymerase 1 Komplexes Van 1 gefunden. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{controls the}} intracellular Ca 2 +-concentrations via Ca 2 +-cannels and ATPases. Pmr 1 is the Ca 2 +-ATPase mainly localized in the golgi constituting one {{player of the}} Ca 2 +-homeostasis. After a rapid increase in the cytosolic Ca 2 +-concentration through the Mid 1 /Cch 1 PM channel follows the active removal of Ca 2 +-ions from the cytosol. Beside Ca 2 +-Ions Pmr 1 transports also Mn 2 +-Ions from the cytosol into the golgi lumen. Artificial loss of functions of these transporters result in {{a wide spread of}} consequences. A pmr 1 -mutation is not lethal but induces a rapid viability loss of stationary cells. It is shown in this work, that those dying cells show typical markers of apoptotic cell death like phosphatidylserine externalisation, chromatin condensation and fragmentation into so called apoptotic bodies. Pmr 1 is essential for the correct morphology of the golgi, the central organell of the secretory pathway. We therefore looked for the apoptotic markers in conditional secretion mutants. We found chromatin condensation (DAPI) and fragmentation of the DNA (TUNEL-test) in sec-mutants under restricive conditions. The altered state of the PM was shown by Annexin V staining. In this context we recognized that the pmr 1 -mutation leads to dramatic changes in the cell wall. A strong reduction of the total cell wall content and an adjustment of the carbohydrate contents glucose, mannose and glucosamine are present in pmr 1 -mutants. Also the expression level of Fks 2 (catalytic subunit of &# 946;- 1. 3 glukan synthase), the key enzyme of the cell wall integrity pathway, is strongly increased in pmr 1 -mutants. Continuative a genetic method was developed to recognize synthetic lethal mutations in combination with pmr 1 -mutations. This work identified 5 interaction partners genetic with Pmr 1.
