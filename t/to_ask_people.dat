2500|$|That February 4, President Lyndon Johnson {{made his}} first public {{statement}} {{in support of the}} Selma campaign. At midday, Judge Thomas, at the Justice Department's urging, issued an injunction that suspended Alabama’s current literacy test, ordered Selma to take at least 100 applications per registration day, and guaranteed that all applications received by June 1 would be processed before July. In response to Thomas' favorable ruling, and in alarm at Malcolm X's visit, Andrew Young, who was not in charge of the Selma movement, said he would suspend demonstrations. James Bevel, however, continued <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>people</b> to line up at the voter's registration office as they had been doing, and Dr. King called Young from jail, telling him the demonstrations would continue. They did so the next day, and more than 500 protesters were arrested. On February 5, King bailed himself and Abernathy out of jail. On February 6, the White House announced that it would urge Congress to enact a voting rights bill during the current session, and that the Vice-President and Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach would meet with King in the following week.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the last}} decade the field of process mining gained {{attention}} from research and practice. There is, however, not much known about the use and the appreciation of the involved techniques and tools, {{many of which are}} integrated into the well-known ProM framework. Therefore a questionnaire was sent out <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>people’s</b> opinions about process mining and the ProM framework. This paper reports on the answers and tries to link them to existing knowledge from academic literature and popular articles. It must be seen as a first, exploratory attempt to reveal the adoption of process mining and the actual use of the ProM framework...|$|R

His Club was closed for cleaning; his Boards in recess; there was nothing, therefore, to take him into the City.

60|$|When she {{had left}} him at any rate, the day she came with Basil Dashwood, and still more on a later occasion, that of his turning back to his work after putting her into her carriage, and {{otherwise}} bare-headedly manifesting, the last time, for that year apparently, {{that he was to}} see her--when {{she had left}} him it occurred to him in the light of her quick distinction that there were deep differences in the famous artistic life. Miriam was already in a glow of glory--which, moreover, was probably but a faint spark in relation to the blaze to come; and as he closed the door on her and took up his palette to rub it with a dirty cloth the little room in which his own battle was practically to be fought looked woefully cold and grey and mean. It was lonely and {{yet at the same time}} was peopled with unfriendly shadows--so thick he foresaw them gather in winter twilights to come--the duller conditions, the longer patiences, the less immediate and less personal joys. His late beginning was there and his wasted youth, the mistakes that would still bring forth children after their image, the sedentary solitude, the grey mediocrity, the poor explanations, the effect of foolishness he dreaded even from afar of in having <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>people</b> to wait, and wait longer, and wait again, for a fruition which to their sense at least might well prove a grotesque anti-climax. He yearned enough over it, however it should figure, to feel that this possible pertinacity might enter into comparison even with such a productive force as Miriam's. That was after all in his bare studio the most collective dim presence, the one that kept him company best as he sat there and that made it the right place, however wrong--the sense that it was to the thing in itself he was attached. This was Miriam's case too, but the sharp contrast, which she showed him she also felt, was in the number of other things she got with the thing in itself.|$|E
