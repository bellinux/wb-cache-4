25|$|In the 1970s, the {{financial}} collapse of two companies, Gemini Chit Fund Corporation and Stallion Corporation, led to criminal charges being brought against their executives.

The allotment was determined by lot or by auction. Following their collapse, {{it was estimated that}} 40,000 investors had lost about S$50 million. Under Tan's leadership of the Attorney-General's Chambers, Gemini's managing director Abdul Gaffar Mohamed Ibrahim pleaded guilty to criminal breach of trust of $3.2 million and was sentenced to life imprisonment, and its chairman V.K.S.

Stallion's executive director Martin Ler Cheng Seng pleaded guilty to authorising his firm to unlawfully bid at a Stallion chit fund sale, and was jailed for a year.|$|E
25|$|The green pale in {{the flag}} symbolises Irish republicanism {{dating back to}} the Society of United Irishmen in the 1790s. The orange {{represents}} the minority who were supporters of King William III, who was of the House of Orange and originally the Stadtholder of the Netherlands, who had defeated King James II and his predominantly Irish Catholic army at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. His title came from the Principality of Orange in the south of France that had been a Protestant bastion from the 16th century. It was included in the Irish flag in an attempt to reconcile the Orange Order in Ireland with the Irish independence movement. The white in the centre signifies a lasting truce between the two cultures and a living together in peace. The flag, as a whole, is intended to symbolise the inclusion and hoped-for union of the people of different traditions on the island of Ireland, which is expressed in the Constitution as <b>the</b> <b>entitlement</b> of every person born in Ireland {{to be part of the}} independent Irish nation, regardless of ethnic origin, religion or political conviction.|$|E

25|$|The rabbis {{in ancient}} times insisted on the {{marriage}} couple entering into the ketubah as a protection for the wife. It acted as a replacement of the biblical mohar – the price paid by the groom to the bride, or her parents, for the marriage (i.e., the bride price). The ketubah became a mechanism whereby the amount due to the wife (the bride-price) came to be paid {{in the event of}} the cessation of marriage, either by the death of the husband or divorce. It may be noted that the biblical mohar created a major social problem: many young prospective husbands could not raise the mohar at the time when they would normally be expected to marry. So, to enable these young men to marry, the rabbis, in effect, delayed the time that the amount would be payable, when they {{would be more likely to}} have the sum. The mechanism adopted was to provide for the mohar to be a part of the ketubah. It may also be noted that both the mohar and the ketubah amounts served the same purpose: the protection for the wife should her support (either by death or divorce) cease. The only difference between the two systems was the timing of the payment. A modern secular equivalent would be <b>the</b> <b>entitlement</b> to alimony in the event of divorce. Another function performed by the ketubah amount was to provide a disincentive for the husband contemplating divorcing his wife: he would need to have the amount to be able to pay to the wife.|$|E

500|$|Clement (died 1258) was a 13th-century Dominican friar who was [...] {{the first}} {{member of the}} Dominican Order in Britain and Ireland to become a bishop. In 1233, he was {{selected}} to lead the ailing diocese of Dunblane in Scotland, and faced a struggle to bring the bishopric of Dunblane (or [...] "bishopric of Strathearn") to financial viability. This involved many negotiations with the powerful religious institutions and secular authorities which had acquired control of the revenue that would normally have been <b>the</b> <b>entitlement</b> of Clement's bishopric. The negotiations proved difficult, forcing Clement to visit the papal court in Rome. While not achieving all of his aims, Clement succeeded in saving the bishopric from relocation to Inchaffray Abbey. He also regained enough revenue to begin work on the new Dunblane Cathedral.|$|E
5000|$|The {{market for}} {{residential}} condominium conversions typically arises {{when the price}} of single family homes increases {{beyond the reach of the}} first time buyer. There are multiple types of investors involved when there is a hot conversion market.

Alternatively, a mom and pop have owned a 20 unit apartment building for 20 years and want to sell it. Rather than selling it outright as an apartment building, they hire a consultant to process <b>the</b> <b>entitlements</b> and sell <b>the</b> building instead at a condo premium to a developer who finishes the job.|$|R

500|$|On 16 May 1915, {{while the}} Armenian Genocide was underway, a secret {{directive}} was promulgated entitled [...] "administrative instruction regarding {{movable and immovable}} property abandoned by Armenians deported {{as a result of}} the war and unusual political circumstances." [...] Once enacted, the directive established special commissions, known as the [...] "Abandoned Property Commissions" [...] (Turkish: Emvâl-i Metrûke İdare Komisyonları) and the [...] "Liquidation Commissions" [...] (Turkish: Tasfiye Komisyonu), which were tasked with providing detailed information and appraising the value of assets [...] "abandoned" [...] by deportees under the guise of [...] "safeguarding" [...] them. The number of these commissions rose to 33 by January 1916. After the departure of the deportees, goods and livestock that were deemed [...] "perishable" [...] were prioritized as the first items that must be sold using public auctions, while the profits from these auctions were to be safeguarded under <b>the</b> <b>entitlement</b> of the owners. After providing documentation of the property (copies provided to the owners and the Ottoman Treasury), the directive specified that muhajirs (Turkish refugees mainly from the Balkan wars) were to be settled in the vacant lands and properties belonging to the deportees. Once settled, the refugees had to register the land and houses, while other assets that were affixed to the property, such as olive groves and vineyards, were to be allocated amongst them. Unwanted items and assets were to be sold in public auctions. According to historian Dickran Kouymjian, the settlement of muhajirs into the lands and properties of deported Armenians implies that local authorities had firsthand knowledge that the deportees were to never return.|$|E
