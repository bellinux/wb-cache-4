500|$|The British {{squadron}} out-gunned the German 7th Half Flotilla. HMS Undaunted—an Arethusa-class light cruiser—was {{armed with}} two BL 6 inch Mk XII naval guns and seven QF 4 inch Mk V naval guns, in single mounts (most without gun shields) and eight torpedo tubes. Undaunted was experimentally {{armed with a}} pair of 2-pounder anti-aircraft guns, something most of her class lacked and at best speed could make [...] The four Laforey-class destroyers were armed with four torpedo tubes in two twin mounts, three 4-inch guns and a 2-pounder gun. The destroyers were slightly faster than the cruiser and could make about [...] at full power. The German vessels were inferior to the British in other areas, the 7th Half Flotilla was composed of ageing Großes Torpedoboot 1898 class boats and had been completed in 1904. The German boats were nearly equal in speed to the British at [...] Each of the German vessels was armed with three [...] guns, that were of shorter range and <b>throw-weight</b> than the British guns. The biggest danger to the British squadron was the five [...] torpedoes carried by each German boat.|$|E
2500|$|The later {{versions}} (the A-2, A-3, and B-3) were larger, weighed more, and had longer ranges {{than the}} A-1. The range increase was most important: The A-2 range was , the A-3 , and the B-3 [...] The A-3 featured multiple re-entry vehicles (MRVs) which spread the warheads about a common target, and the B-3 {{was to have}} penetration aids to counter Soviet Anti-Ballistic Missile defenses. The B-3 missile evolved into the C-3 Poseidon missile, which abandoned the decoy concept in favor of using the C3's greater <b>throw-weight</b> for larger numbers (10–14) of new hardened high-re-entry-speed reentry vehicles that could overwhelm Soviet defenses by sheer weight of numbers, and its high speed after re-entry. The abandoned decoy system for the B-3 (Antelope) was known to the UK where it was adopted and evolved into Super Antelope, KH.793 and later re-labeled Chevaline.|$|E
2500|$|This {{development}} {{left the}} British {{in a particularly}} bad position. Although the Polaris was fairly immune to direct attack in the submerged ballistic missile submarines, this meant little if the warheads could not {{make it through the}} Soviet defences [...] especially if the Soviets were convinced of this. The Polaris did not have the physical size or <b>throw-weight</b> needed to enlarge its current three-warhead payload, making the US's [...] "overwhelm" [...] solution difficult to implement even if they were willing to invest in producing additional warheads. The three warheads from each missile remained fairly close together during atmospheric entry, and could theoretically all be attacked by a single ABM with a large warhead. A single [...] with 16 missiles would throw a total of 48 warheads, and against ABMs this could no longer guarantee the success of the deterrent's objective - to threaten Soviet state power.|$|E
2500|$|However, a 1984 US Interagency Intelligence Assessment {{expresses a}} far more skeptical and {{cautious}} approach, stating that as the hypothesis is not scientifically convincing. The report predicted that Soviet nuclear policy would be to maintain their strategic nuclear posture, such as their fielding of the high <b>throw-weight</b> SS-18 missile and they would merely attempt to exploit the hypothesis for propaganda purposes, such as directing scrutiny on the US portion of the nuclear arms race. Moreover, {{it goes on to}} express the belief that if Soviet officials did begin to take nuclear winter seriously, it would probably make them demand exceptionally high standards of scientific proof for the hypothesis, as the implications of it would undermine their military doctrine—a level of scientific proof which perhaps could not be met without field experimentation. The un-redacted portion of the document ends with the suggestion that substantial increases in Soviet Civil defense food stockpiles might be an early indicator that Nuclear Winter was beginning to influence Soviet upper [...] thinking.|$|E
50|$|<b>Throw-weight</b> is {{a measure}} of the {{effective}} weight of ballistic missile payloads. It is measured in kilograms or tonnes. <b>Throw-weight</b> equals the total weight of a missile's warheads, reentry vehicles, self-contained dispensing mechanisms, penetration aids, and missile guidance systems—generally all components except for the launch rocket booster and launch fuel. While <b>throw-weight</b> may refer to any type of warhead, in normal modern usage it almost exclusively refers to nuclear or thermonuclear payloads. It was once also a consideration in the design of naval ships and the number/size of guns they carried.|$|E
50|$|<b>Throw-weight</b> {{was used}} as a {{criterion}} in classifying different types of missiles during Strategic Arms Limitation Talks between the Soviet Union and the United States. The term became politically controversial during debates over the arms-control accord, as critics of the treaty alleged that Soviet missiles were able to carry larger payloads and therefore enabled the Soviets to maintain higher <b>throw-weight</b> than an American force with a roughly comparable number of lower-payload missiles.|$|E
50|$|<b>Throw-weight</b> is {{normally}} calculated using an optimal ballistic trajectory from one {{point on the}} surface of the Earth to another. An optimal trajectory maximizes the total payload (<b>throw-weight)</b> using the available impulse of the missile. By reducing the payload weight, different trajectories can be selected which either extends the nominal range, or decreases the total time in flight. A depressed trajectory is a non-optimal, lower and flatter trajectory which takes less time between launch and impact, but with a lower <b>throw-weight.</b> The primary reasons to choose a depressed trajectory are either to evade anti-ballistic missile systems by reducing the time available to shoot down the attacking vehicle (especially during the vulnerable burn-phase against space-based ABM systems), or in a nuclear first-strike scenario. An alternate, non-military, purpose for a depressed trajectory is in conjunction with the space plane concept with use of air-breathing engines, which requires the ballistic missile to remain sufficiently low inside the atmosphere for air-breathing engines to function.|$|E
50|$|Culturally, {{being able}} to discuss <b>throw-weight</b> was often used as {{shorthand}} {{to suggest that a}} politician was capable of understanding a serious and high-profile but arcane and supposedly mathematically complex public policy issue.|$|E
50|$|For a rocket, the payload {{can be a}} satellite, space probe, or {{spacecraft}} carrying humans, animals, or cargo. For a ballistic missile, the payload is one or more warheads {{and related}} systems; the total weight of these systems {{is referred to as}} the <b>throw-weight.</b>|$|E
5000|$|LGM-118 Peacekeeper. Similar in {{capability}} to the SS-18 Satan, the Peacekeeper had a <b>throw-weight</b> of 4,000 kg, and could carry only 10 MIRVed warheads of 300 kt each, {{as well as}} a CEP of 120 meters. Deployed in the mid-1980s. Decommissioned; however, guidance systems and re-entry vehicles moved to Minuteman III missiles.|$|E
5000|$|R-36M (SS-18 Satan). Deployed in 1976, this {{counterforce}} MIRV ICBM had single (20 Mt) or 10 MIRV (550-750 kt each) warheads, CEP 250 m. Targeted against Minuteman III silos {{as well as}} CONUS command, control, {{and communications}} facilities. Has sufficient <b>throw-weight</b> to carry up to 10 RVs and 40 penaids. Still in service.|$|E
50|$|Telemetry {{intelligence}} (TELINT) is a subdiscipline of FISINT {{which is}} concerned with missiles and other remotely monitored devices sending back continuous streams of data about their location, speed, engine status and other metrics. This data can provide information {{on the performance of}} the missile and especially its <b>throw-weight,</b> i.e. the potential size of its warhead\s.|$|E
50|$|The UR-500 was {{designed}} to be a very large ICBM, with the <b>throw-weight</b> necessary to deliver the 100 megaton Tsar Bomba warhead. The programme was cancelled after two flights, but {{with the addition of a}} third stage, the rocket was re-used as the Proton carrier rocket, which is still in service as of 2017.|$|E
50|$|Heavy ICBM is a {{term that}} {{was created in the}} 1970s to {{describe}} a class of Soviet ICBMs (intercontinental ballistic missiles). They were characterized by a heavy <b>throw-weight</b> of 5 to 9 metric tons, several times that of an LGM-30 Minuteman, and a length of over 35 meters, and were thus capable of delivering a large number of warheads in a single MIRV missile.|$|E
5000|$|SS-18 [...] "Satan" [...] NATO designation, MIRV. Believed to be a first-strike weapon by {{some in the}} West, due to high {{accuracy}} of 220 m CEP, and high <b>throw-weight</b> of 8,800 kg; could deploy 40 penetration aids and deliver at least 10 warheads of at least 500 kt through independent, separate targets. Each warhead could probably take out even hardened nuclear silos, such as those used by the Minuteman III. Deployed in 1976, aimed at CONUS. Still in service.|$|E
50|$|The DF-5 {{was first}} flight tested in 1971, with final tests into the Pacific Ocean in May 1980. Two silo-based {{missiles}} {{were put into}} 'trial operational deployment' in 1981. It had a range of 10,000 to 12,000 km which allowed it to threaten the western portions of the United States. Beginning in 1986 the Chinese started developing the improved DF-5A, with range increased to over 15,000 km and a more accurate guidance system. The DF-5A upgrade increased the <b>throw-weight</b> of the system from 3,000 kg to 3,200 kg.|$|E
5000|$|The RSM-56 Bulava (Булава, lit. [...] "mace", NATO {{reporting}} name SS-NX-30 or SS-N-32 , GRAU index 3M30) is a submarine-launched {{ballistic missile}} (SLBM) {{developed for the}} Russian Navy and deployed in 2013 on the new [...] of ballistic missile nuclear submarines. It is intended as the future cornerstone of Russia's nuclear triad, and {{is the most expensive}} weapons project in the country. [...] The weapon takes its name from bulava, a Russian word for mace. Bulava has 25% greater range and a 30 percent lower <b>throw-weight</b> than the 1979 American Trident C4 missile.|$|E
5000|$|UGM-133 Trident II. Deployed in 1990, this intercontinental-range SLBM carries 8 RVs with CEP of 80-120 m and {{yield of}} 100/475 kt. Main purpose is second strike countervalue retaliation, but the {{excellent}} CEP and much shorter flight-time due to submarine launch (reducing {{the possibility of}} launch on warning) makes it an excellent first-strike weapon. However, that any nuclear power {{would be willing to}} place its nuclear submarines close to enemy shores during times of strategic tension is highly questionable. Has sufficient <b>throw-weight</b> to deploy up to 12 warheads, but 8 are deployed in current practice.|$|E
5000|$|TELINT {{is one of}} the [...] "national {{means of}} {{technical}} verification" [...] mentioned, but not detailed, in This data can provide valuable information on the actual performance of the missile and especially its <b>throw-weight,</b> i.e. the potential size of its nuclear warheads. The [...] treaty language [...] "the agreements include provisions that are important steps to strengthen assurance against violations: both sides undertake not to interfere with national technical means of verification. In addition, both countries agree not to use deliberate concealment measures to impede verification." [...] refers to, in part, a technical agreement not to encrypt strategic test telemetry and thus impede verification by TELINT.|$|E
50|$|However, {{this simple}} {{examination}} ignores several important issues. For one, the new stage weighs {{considerably less than}} the older one, {{which means that the}} lower stages below it will leave the new upper stage at a higher velocity. This alone will make up for much of the difference in performance. More importantly, the comparison assumes that the stage would otherwise remain the same design overall. This is a bad assumption; one generally makes the upper stages as large as they can be given the <b>throw-weight</b> of the stages below them. In this case one would not make a drop-in version of the S-IVB, but a larger stage whose overall weight was the same as the S-IVB.|$|E
50|$|The R-36M (SS-18) {{is similar}} to the R-36 in design, but has the {{capacity}} to mount a MIRV payload of 10 warheads, each with a 550-750 kt yield, or a single warhead of up to 20 Mt. <b>Throw-weight</b> of the missile is 8,800 kg. This makes the Soviet R-36 the world's heaviest ICBM; for comparison, the heaviest US ICBM (the retired LGM-118 Peacekeeper, that carried 10 warheads of 300 kt each) had less than a half of this at 4,000 kg. The R-36M has two stages. The first is a 460,000 kgf (4.5 MN) thrust motor with four combustion chambers and nozzles. The second stage is a single-chamber 77,000 kgf (755 kN) thrust motor.|$|E
50|$|The former {{problem was}} {{becoming}} increasingly apparent beginning in approximately 1957. Missiles designed {{to carry a}} specific warhead began having increasing levels of excess <b>throw-weight</b> as warhead physics improved missile design, resulting in smaller and lighter warheads. Even {{a small amount of}} excess capacity could be used to carry radar decoys or chaff, which is very light weight, and would create additional radar returns that would make it difficult to pick out the warhead. As long as the decoys spread out or the chaff blocked an area larger than the lethal radius of the 5 Megaton (Mt) interceptor (much smaller in space than in the atmosphere), several interceptors would have to be launched to guarantee the warhead would be hit. Adding more decoys was extremely inexpensive, requiring very expensive ABMs to be added in response.|$|E
50|$|The RT-2 is a road mobile 3-stage, single warhead ICBM. Its 29.5 meter {{length and}} 1.7 meter {{diameter}} are {{approximately the same}} size and shape as the U.S. Minuteman ICBM. It has a <b>throw-weight</b> of 1000 kg and carries a single warhead with a yield of 800 kt and accuracy (CEP) of 200m. Its road mobile capability gave the RT-2PM Topol an extremely high probability of survival. It can fire from field deployment sites or through sliding roof garage bases. The RT-2PM Topol joined operational Soviet SRF regiments in 1985. A total area of approximately 190,000 square kilometers could be required to deploy a force consisting of 500 road-mobile Topol ICBMs. Mobile units require a much higher number of personnel for maintenance and operation than fixed systems. Consequently, the RT-2PM Topol was significantly more costly to maintain and operate than silo launched systems.|$|E
50|$|The later {{versions}} (the A-2, A-3, and B-3) were larger, weighed more, and had longer ranges {{than the}} A-1. The range increase was most important: The A-2 range was 1500 nmi km, the A-3 2500 nmi km, and the B-3 2000 nmi km. The A-3 featured multiple re-entry vehicles (MRVs) which spread the warheads about a common target, and the B-3 {{was to have}} penetration aids to counter Soviet Anti-Ballistic Missile defenses. The B-3 missile evolved into the C-3 Poseidon missile, which abandoned the decoy concept in favor of using the C3's greater <b>throw-weight</b> for larger numbers (10-14) of new hardened high-re-entry-speed reentry vehicles that could overwhelm Soviet defences by sheer weight of numbers, and its high speed after re-entry. The abandoned decoy system for the B-3 (Antelope) was known to the UK where it was adopted and evolved into Super Antelope, KH.793 and later re-labeled Chevaline.|$|E
50|$|Provisions of the SALT II {{agreement}} {{prohibited the}} deployment {{of more than one}} new missile (which became RT-23UTTh), it was officially declared by the Soviet Union that the RT-2PM Topol was developed to upgrade the silo based RT-2. The US government disputed this view, contending that the missile was clearly more than 5% larger and had twice the <b>throw-weight</b> as the RT-2 and therefore constituted a new missile system. Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov, Soviet Chief of General Staff cancelled the September 1, 1983 test flight of the RT-2PM Topol which was to be launched from Plesetsk (the launch site in northwest Russia used for test firing of solid fuel propellant ICBMs)- 24 minutes later to land in the Klyuchi target area on the Kamchatka Peninsula. The night of the scheduled launch was the night that Korean Air Lines Flight 007 was shot down after accidentally intruding Soviet airspace over Kamchatka.|$|E

50|$|Ballistic missile {{submarines}} {{have been}} of great strategic importance for the USA, Russia, and other nuclear powers since they entered service in the Cold War, as they can hide from reconnaissance satellites and fire their nuclear weapons with virtual impunity. This makes them immune to a first strike directed against nuclear forces, allowing each side to maintain the capability to launch a devastating retaliatory strike, even if all land-based missiles have been destroyed. This relieves {{each side of the}} necessity to adopt a launch on warning posture, with its grave attendant risk of accidental nuclear war. Additionally, the deployment of highly accurate missiles on ultra-quiet submarines allows an attacker to sneak up close to the enemy coast and launch a missile on a depressed trajectory (a non-optimal ballistic trajectory which trades off reduced <b>throw-weight</b> for a faster and lower path, effectively reducing the time between launch and impact), thus opening the possibility of a decapitation strike.|$|E

5000|$|The R-36 (Р-36) is {{a family}} of {{intercontinental}} ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and space launch vehicles (Tsyklon) designed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The original R-36 was deployed under the GRAU index 8K67 and was given the NATO reporting name SS-9 Scarp. It was able to carry three warheads {{and was the first}} Soviet MIRV (multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle) missile. [...] The later version, the R-36M was produced under the GRAU designations 15A14 and 15A18 and was given the NATO reporting name SS-18 Satan. This missile was viewed by certain U.S. analysts as giving the Soviet Union first strike advantage over the U.S., particularly because of its rapid silo-reload ability, very heavy throw weight and extremely large number of re-entry vehicles. Some versions of the R-36M were deployed with 10 warheads and up to 40 penetration aids and the missile's high <b>throw-weight</b> made it theoretically capable of carrying more warheads or penetration aids. Contemporary U.S. missiles, such as the Minuteman III, carried up to three warheads at most.|$|E
50|$|The British {{squadron}} out-gunned the German 7th Half Flotilla, the Undaunted (Captain Cecil Fox, squadron commander)—an Arethusa-class light cruiser—was {{armed with}} two BL 6 inch Mk XII naval guns and seven QF 4 inch Mk V naval guns, in single mounts (most without gun shields) and eight torpedo tubes. Undaunted was experimentally {{armed with a}} pair of 2-pounder anti-aircraft guns, something most of her class lacked and at best speed could make 28.5 kn. The four Laforey-class destroyers were armed with four torpedo tubes in two twin mounts, three 4-inch guns and a 2-pounder gun. The destroyers were slightly faster than the cruiser and could make about 29 kn at full power. The German vessels were inferior to the British in other areas, the 7th Half Flotilla was composed of ageing Großes Torpedoboot 1898 class boats and had been completed in 1904. The German boats were nearly equal in speed to the British at 28 kn. Each of the German vessels was armed with three 50 mm guns, that were of shorter range and <b>throw-weight</b> than the British guns. The biggest danger to the British squadron was the five 450 mm torpedoes carried by each German boat.|$|E
50|$|Missiles of the R-36M/SS-18 {{family have}} never been {{deployed}} with more than ten warheads, but given their large <b>throw-weight</b> (8.8 tonnes as specified in START), they {{have the capacity to}} carry considerably more detonation power. Among the projects that the Soviet Union considered in the mid-1970s was that of a 15A17 missile—a follow-on to the R-36MUTTH (15A18). The missile would have had an even greater throw-weight—9.5 tonnes—and would be able to carry {{a very large number of}} warheads. Five different versions of the missile were considered. Three of these versions would carry regular warheads — 38 × 250 kt yield, 24 × 500 kt yield, or 15-17 × 1 Mt yield. Two modifications were supposed to carry guided warheads ("upravlyaemaya golovnaya chast") — 28 × 250 kt or 19 × 500 kt. However, none of these upgraded models were ever developed. The SALT II Treaty, signed in 1979, prohibited increasing the number of warheads ICBMs could carry. Equally, from a strategic point of view, concentrating so many warheads on silo-based missiles was not seen as desirable, since it would have made a large proportion of the USSR's warheads vulnerable to a counterforce strike.|$|E
50|$|MIRV {{land-based}} ICBMs {{were considered}} destabilizing because {{they tended to}} put a premium on striking first. The world's first MIRV—US Minuteman III missile of 1970—threatened to rapidly increase the US's deployable nuclear arsenal and thus {{the possibility that it}} would have enough bombs to destroy virtually all of the Soviet Union's nuclear weapons and negate any significant retaliation. Later on the US feared the Soviet's MIRVs because Soviet missiles had a greater <b>throw-weight</b> and could thus put more warheads on each missile than the US could. For example, the US MIRVs might have increased their warhead per missile count by a factor of 6 while the Soviets increased theirs by a factor of 10. Furthermore, the US had a much smaller proportion of its nuclear arsenal in ICBMs than the Soviets. Bombers could not be outfitted with MIRVs so their capacity would not be multiplied. Thus the US did not seem to have as much potential for MIRV usage as the Soviets. However, the US had a larger number of Submarine-launched ballistic missiles, which could be outfitted with MIRVs, and helped offset the ICBM disadvantage. It is because of their first-strike capability that land-based MIRVs were banned under the START II agreement. START II was ratified by the Russian Duma on 14 April 2000, but Russia withdrew from the treaty in 2002 after the US withdrew from the ABM treaty.|$|E
40|$|Many {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} over the years on the relationship between spacecraft design, mission utility, cost/complexity, and the Aerospace community’s ability to “commoditize” spacecraft designs and/or missions. During the Fifties and Sixties, spacecraft were limited by launch vehicle <b>throw-weight</b> and technical performance limitations, particularly computer processing speeds. During the Seventies and into the Eighties the personal computer revolution enabled more and more processing capability to be utilized in spacecraft bus and mission designs. This resulted in industry developed, large, “Capital” assets that took years to design, develop, integrate, test, and eventually operate. These systems, due to the very nature of their multi-mission capabilities, became critical to our nation. These systems had to function, and function reliably, therefore requiring extensive support infrastructures to assure mission success. As the Cold War ended, commercial space began to prosper. In recent years, the advanced technologies that enabled increased Capital Asset performance have also enabled small satellites to reach performance levels {{that could be used for}} operational missions. This, coupled with new mission types that are now feasible, have lead to a renewed and significant interest in small satellites. This paper investigates the changing dynamics of the market and technologies that have placed small satellites and Capital Assets at a crossroads...|$|E
