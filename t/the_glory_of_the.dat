5|$|Although {{the founders}} of the Tang related to <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earlier Han dynasty (3rd century–3rd century), the basis for much of their {{administrative}} organization was very similar to the previous Northern and Southern dynasties. The Northern Zhou (6th century) fubing system of divisional militia was continued by the Tang, along with farmer-soldiers serving in rotation from the capital or frontier in order to receive appropriated farmland. The equal-field system of the Northern Wei (4th–6th centuries) was also kept, although there were a few modifications.|$|E
5|$|After the Suez Crisis and the Six-Day War, {{the army}} came to arm the most {{important}} place. For technical reasons (distance of communication with bases) and because new places of historical interest were accessible, the top brass debated whether to transfer the postings of new recruits at Massada to a more appropriate place. It was Latrun that was finally chosen. In the 1980s, a commemorative site and a museum {{was built on the}} old police site. The complex has a wall listing all the names of the fallen soldiers since the War Of Independence, and a monument to <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heroes and another for reverence. The museum has nearly 200 tanks and other armoured vehicles of many kinds.|$|E

5|$|Christodorus of Coptus, an Egyptian {{poet and}} writer wrote a lengthy (416 lines long) hexameter piece of poetry {{inspired}} by <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> statues housed within {{the halls of}} the Baths of Zeuxippus. This poem actually consisted of a number of short epigrams (six in total), each focusing on one or a small group of statues within the Baths, designed to combine to form one work. While {{it has been suggested that}} the epigrams of Christodorus of Coptus may actually have been inscribed on the (bases) of the statues themselves, this is unlikely because of his use of the ekphrastic medium, and the presence of the past tense in the text.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí also practiced landscaping, {{often in}} urban settings. He aimed to place his {{works in the}} most {{appropriate}} natural and architectural surroundings by studying the location of his constructions thoroughly and trying to naturally integrate them into those surroundings. For this purpose, he often used the material that was most common in the nearby environment, such as the slate of Bellesguard and the grey Bierzo granite in the Episcopal Palace, Astorga. Many of his projects were gardens, such as the Güell Park and the Can Artigas Gardens, or incorporated gardens, as in the Casa Vicens or the Güell Pavilions. Gaudí's harmonious approach to landscaping is exemplified at the First Mystery of <b>the</b> <b>Glory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rosary at Montserrat, where the architectural framework is nature itself—here the Montserrat rock—nature encircles the group of sculptures that adorned {{the path to the}} Holy Cave.|$|E
5|$|Larger scale state-generating {{processes}} {{developed in}} Slavic {{areas in the}} 9th century. Great Moravia, the most prominent Slavic state of the era, became established in the early 9th century south of modern Poland. The original lands of Great Moravia included what is now Moravia and western Slovakia, plus parts of Bohemia, Pannonia and southern regions of Lesser Poland. <b>The</b> <b>glory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Great Moravian empire became fully apparent in light of archeological discoveries; lavishly equipped burials are especially spectacular. Such finds do not extend to the lands that now constitute southern Poland, however. The great territorial expansion of Great Moravia {{took place during the}} reign of Svatopluk I {{at the end of the}} 9th century. The Moravian state collapsed quite suddenly; in 906, weakened by an internal crisis and Magyar invasions, it ceased to exist entirely.|$|E

5|$|Rather than {{holding on}} to his {{possessions}} in Asia Minor, Michael chose to expand the Empire, gaining only short-term success. To avoid another sacking of the capital by the Latins, he forced the Church to submit to Rome, again a temporary solution for which the peasantry hated Michael and Constantinople. The efforts of Andronikos II and later his grandson Andronikos III marked Byzantium's last genuine attempts in restoring <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Empire. However, the use of mercenaries by Andronikos II would often backfire, with the Catalan Company ravaging the countryside and increasing resentment towards Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|The {{worship of}} the lingam {{originated}} from the famous hymn in the Atharva-Veda Samhitâ sung in praise of the Yupa-Stambha, the sacrificial post. In that hymn, a description is found of the beginningless and endless Stambha or Skambha, and it is shown that the said Skambha is put {{in place of the}} eternal Brahman. Just as the Yajna (sacrificial) fire, its smoke, ashes, and flames, the Soma plant, and the ox that used to carry on its back the wood for the Vedic sacrifice gave place to the conceptions of the brightness of Shiva's body, his tawny matted hair, his blue throat, and the riding on the bull of the Shiva, the Yupa-Skambha gave place in time to the Shiva-Linga. In the text Linga Purana, the same hymn is expanded in the shape of stories, meant to establish <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great Stambha and the superiority of Shiva as Mahadeva.|$|E
5|$|After Heraclius' victory, {{he marched}} towards Caucasian Albania and wintered there. Shahrbaraz, along with Shahin and Shahraplakan were later {{sent by the}} orders of Khosrow II to trap the forces of Heraclius. Shahin managed to rout the Byzantine army. Due to jealousy between the Sasanian commanders, Shahrbaraz hurried with his army {{to take part in}} <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> victory. Heraclius met them at Tigranakert and routed the forces of Shahraplakan and Shahin one after the other. After this victory, Heraclius crossed the Araxes and camped in the plains on the other side. Shahin, with the {{remnants}} of both his and Shahraplakan's armies joined Shahrbaraz in the pursuit of Heraclius, but marshes slowed them down. At Aliovit, Shahrbaraz split his forces, sending some 6,000 troops to ambush Heraclius while the remainder of the troops stayed at Aliovit. Heraclius launched a surprise night attack on the Sasanian main camp in February 625, destroying it. Shahrbaraz only barely escaped, naked and alone, having lost his harem, baggage, and men.|$|E
50|$|Afterwards, <b>the</b> theme <b>of</b> {{decoration}} changed, {{probably due}} to the arrival in <b>the</b> house <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first noble titles of Lorenzo de' Medici, Duke of Urbino and Giuliano de' Medici, Duke of Nemours, and became <b>the</b> illustrations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>glories</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Medici family, to which they clearly mentions <b>the</b> official themes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> paintings, that is, <b>the</b> Stories <b>of</b> Roman History.|$|R
2500|$|Watts (1674–1748), {{whose father}} was an Elder of a {{dissenter}} congregation, complained at age 16, that when allowed only psalms to sing, the faithful could not even sing about their Lord, Christ Jesus.

5|$|Two {{soldiers}} who feigned desertion {{were sent to}} Shahrbaraz, claiming that the Byzantines were fleeing before Shahin. Due to jealousy between the Persian commanders, Shahrbaraz hurried with his army {{to take part in}} <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> victory. Heraclius met them at Tigranakert and routed the forces of Shahraplakan and Shahin one after the other. Shahin lost his baggage train, and Shahraplakan (according to one source) was killed, though he re-appears later. After this victory, Heraclius crossed the Araxes and camped in the plains on the other side. Shahin, with the remnants of both his and Shahraplakan's armies joined Shahrbaraz in the pursuit of Heraclius, but marshes slowed them down. At Aliovit, Shahrbaraz split his forces, sending some 6,000 troops to ambush Heraclius while the remainder of the troops stayed at Aliovit. Heraclius instead launched a surprise night attack on the Persian main camp in February 625, destroying it.

25|$|Examples {{of modern}} {{buildings}} that stick more faithfully {{to the ancient}} rectangular temple form are only found from the 18th century onwards.

25|$|In their {{impatient}} but unfruitful {{struggle to}} reclaim <b>the</b> <b>glory</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 1960s, Brann {{over the years}} gained a reputation for inept leadership, unfounded enthusiasm or optimism and almost continuous internal unrest, deservedly or not.
