The Bat and Ball Inn had been requisitioned as a munitions dump by the military, and Windmill Down provided as an alternative. However, after a couple of seasons playing on the steep sloping and highly exposed new ground the club agitated for a move to a more suitable location and Ridge Meadow was purchased as a permanent replacement. Ridge Meadow is still the home of Hambledon C.C. today.|$|E

25|$|The Great Siege of Gibraltar was an {{unsuccessful}} attempt by Spain and France to capture Gibraltar from the British. It lasted {{three years and}} seven months from 1779 to 1783 and caused great damage to the town. The old shrine was no exception, and this eventually led to its demolition. A replica of the statue {{had been made to}} replace the original, held in Algeciras. The copy was kept at the Cathedral of St. Mary the Crowned and St. Bernard, but when the church came under bombardment it relocated <b>to</b> <b>Windmill</b> Hill.

500|$|After work at Elsinore {{finished}} in July, the sessions moved <b>to</b> <b>Windmill</b> Lane Studios where Eno, Flood, Lanois, and previous U2 producer Steve Lillywhite mixed the tracks. Each producer created his own mixes of the songs, {{and the band}} either picked the version they preferred or requested that certain aspects of each be combined. Additional recording and mixing continued at a frenetic pace until the 21September deadline, including last-minute changes to [...] "The Fly", [...] "One", and [...] "Mysterious Ways". The Edge estimated {{that half of the}} sessions' work was done in the last three weeks to finalise songs. The final night was spent devising a running order for the record. The following day, the Edge travelled to Los Angeles with the album's tapes for mastering.|$|E
500|$|A second {{windmill}} stood {{nearby and}} has been confused with Vine's Mill in some sources. [...] It is missed off most maps {{and has been}} called [...] "something of an enigma". It was a fan-tailed post mill, larger than Vine's Mill and of a more modern design—although one historian stated that it existed in 1780. It did not receive an official name until the mid-19th century, by which time it had been moved <b>to</b> <b>Windmill</b> Street on Albion Hill in the Carlton Hill area of Brighton: because it had stood where the private gardens of Clifton Terrace were later built, it {{became known as the}} Clifton Gardens Mill. The Windmill Inn on Upper North Street, licensed in 1828, is close to the site of both mills; sources disagree on which one it was named after.|$|E

500|$|Over 13 {{seasons with}} the White Sox, Pierce was the ace of the {{pitching}} staff, leading the team in wins nine times and in strikeouts eight times. He was Chicago's Opening Day starter seven times (1951–52, 1954, 1956–59), and started the home opener in 1953 and 1961. He had an outstanding fastball and an excellent curveball, and in 1951 added the slider (for which he used his motion for the curve rather than the fastball) as a third strong pitch, {{as well as a}} changeup. He worked quickly with an over-the-top motion, dropping his back shoulder in a style similar to that later used by Sandy Koufax. In 1957, Paul Richards noted of Pierce's early style: [...] "He had a tendency <b>to</b> <b>windmill</b> in his delivery, which makes the ball spin too much and takes the life out of it. He flashed his curve-the Yankees always knew when he was throwing a curve. But mainly Bill didn't want to throw anything but fast balls in the old days. He laughed at the change-of-pace and the slider, so most of the strong right-hand hitters were laying back for him, waiting for a fast ball down the middle." [...] After Pierce finally tried the slider against the Yankees, to great effect, Richards noted, [...] "Then, for a while there, he began throwing nothing but sliders. He finally learned about that, too. Even today Pierce will pitch a whole ball game and almost never throw anything but fast balls. But only on certain days." [...] Yankees star Joe DiMaggio was among those praising Pierce's ability, reportedly remarking, [...] "That little so-and-so is a marvel. So little – and all that speed. And I mean speed! He got me out of there on a fastball in the ninth that I'd have needed a telescope to see." [...] Richards became Chicago's manager in 1951, and worked with Pierce to develop his two new pitches and slow down his pace, as well as significantly improve his control; Pierce later recalled, [...] "I learned to control my fastball better [...] Developing the slider helped me tremendously because it gave me a third out pitch. I threw it almost as hard as my fastball, but I could throw it for strikes better than the fast ball or good curve ... Richards made me work on it, and it took me about two years before it was consistent." [...] After issuing 249 walks in 391 innings in 1949–1950, Pierce gave up only 73 walks in 240 innings in 1951, and averaged more than 3 walks per 9 innings in three seasons afterward. His 1951 ERA of 3.03 was fourth best in the league, and he ranked sixth in 1952 with a mark of 2.57. On September 21, 1952 he broke Doc White's 1907 club record of 141 strikeouts by a left-hander, ending the season with 144.|$|E

2500|$|Broadhalfpenny Down {{continued}} in regular use by Hambledon/Hampshire teams until 1781. At {{the end of}} that season, the Hambledon Club moved <b>to</b> <b>Windmill</b> Down, which is closer to the village. According to John Nyren, Windmill was [...] "one of the finest places for playing on I ever saw". A key difference was that Windmill was under the club's control as they rented it from a farmer at ten guineas a year, whereas Broadhalfpenny was common land in use as sheep pasture, for fairs and other gatherings. It could be said that Broadhalfpenny belonged to the community and Windmill to the club, whose members may not have been happy about the [...] "raucous, boisterous crowds that gathered (on the Down)". The move was done {{at the behest of the}} Duke of Dorset, chief among club members, and David Underdown saw it as the first step in a process which removed professional cricket from a truly rural setting and ultimately concentrated it in an urban environment, for it was Dorset's successors George Finch, 9th Earl of Winchilsea and Colonel Charles Lennox who were the key players in the establishment of the White Conduit Club in Islington and subsequently Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's.|$|E

2500|$|Producer Daniel Lanois {{says that}} the most {{progress}} on [...] "Bullet the Blue Sky" [...] was made at Melbeach, the Edge's newly purchased home in seaside Monkstown. According to Lanois, the song's performance came from a 20-minute jam that he dedicated an extensive {{amount of time to}} editing into a final arrangement, [...] "for a song that was never a song, that was only ever a jam." [...] He said, [...] "It was one of those songs that was born partially by surgery – the editing of the structure was a really big part of it." [...] Recording engineer Dave Meegan helped develop the song with a mix that he made at Melbeach. Wanting it to sound like Led Zeppelin, Meegan adjusted a monitor mix to make it [...] "really heavy sounding." [...] Lanois was inspired by what he heard, as the song up to that point was being treated softly. He quickly summoned the band, who went with the primary engineer Flood <b>to</b> <b>Windmill</b> Lane Studios. There, in a warehouse next door, the crew used a public address system to play an acoustic recording of Mullen's drums, which was then re-recorded inside the warehouse. Lanois called it a [...] "really elaborate kind of rock and roll chamber". The result, according to Meegan, [...] "made [...] sound like John Bonham", while Lanois said they sounded [...] "tankier". He added, [...] "it introduced a mid-range that the high-hat seemed to like. This new sonic emphasis on the high-hat made every hit more relevant... The inherent low-frequency punch of the PA also added a level of excitement to the bass drum. The overall sensation was a chestier one." ...|$|E
