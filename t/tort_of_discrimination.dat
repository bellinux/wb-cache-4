40|$|Is {{indirect}} discrimination liability {{more like an}} affirmative action programme or like the <b>tort</b> <b>of</b> negligence? Is it a redistributive measure or a corrective one? Is it best characterized as ‘public law’ or law ‘private law’? Does it seek to protect groups or individuals? In this paper, we will argue that liability for {{indirect discrimination}} occupies a middle ground between these supposedly settled legal categories, combining features of both items in each dichotomy. It is this seemingly unstable and somewhat unfamiliar middle position that partially explains the persisting doubts expressed regarding the legitimacy <b>of</b> indirect <b>discrimination</b> liability. In section I, we will identify the two distinct duties — one general and the other particular — that underpin indirect discrimination. In section II, we will provide a conceptual restatement <b>of</b> British indirect <b>discrimination</b> law and identify the general and particular dimensions of this liability. This section will outline how the particular duty in indirect discrimination diverges from traditional causation-demanding private law liability for the <b>tort</b> <b>of</b> negligence, and how these divergences are justified given social realities and the general/distributive dimension <b>of</b> indirect <b>discrimination</b> liability. Section III will show that despite the indirect discrimination liability being technically strict, it is to some degree avoidable, and at any rate, not unfair. </p...|$|R
50|$|Seneca College v Bhadauria, 1981 2 S.C.R. 181 is {{a leading}} {{decision}} of the Supreme Court of Canada on civil rights and tort law. The Court ruled {{that there can be}} no common law <b>tort</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination.</b>|$|E

40|$|It is an {{integral}} part of rights protection that "adequate" remedies exist. This thesis examines the present functioning of human rights legislations in Canada and articulates fundamental problems with the current Canadian regimes in the enforcement of rights against private actors. The possibility of using tort action as an alternative in the protection of human rights in Canada is then discussed, with particular attention given to the potential for increased damage awards and for wider grounds of prohibition of discriminatory practices. The thesis revisits the Supreme Court of Canada decision in Bhadauria v. Seneca College and anaylzes the basis on which human rights legislation was seen as a creating barrier to a collateral tort action. In contrast with the decision in Bhadauria, the thesis concludes that the present state of tort law is capable of handling this new category of compensable damage. It is further suggested that the realities of human rights protection require reconsideration of alternatives to the present schemes in order to give effect to "adequate" remedies. Drawing on the philosophy of A. J. M. Milne, the thesis addresses the role of judiciary as actively protecting the rights rather than simply enforcing what already exists. Referring specifically to a nominate <b>tort</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination,</b> the thesis provides a framework for the consideration of such a tort, relying on a standard of care equivalent to "negligence" in which the private actor has failed to live up to a universal or "community" standard of reasonable behaviour. In part, because any group can narrowly focus and prioritize issues and concerns that are of primary importance to them as a group, this "community" can not be a localized body. A well functioning "community", instead, is characterized as utilizing and applying universal standards and principles such the principle to fair treatment. This principle entails that there be a "sufficient connection" between the ground of distinction and and the treatment involved. These become the standard by which the private actor is to be judged...|$|E

40|$|Tort {{law does}} not appear to have been a {{particular}} area of interest for Bertha Wilson during her years as a law student or in legal practice. But after she was appointed to the bench, some of her best-known judgments both at the Ontario Court of Appeal and at the Supreme Court of Canada were tort decisions (for example, Bhadauria v. Seneca College and Kamloops v. Neilsen), and the y, along with a number of other decisions authored by her, remain staples of the tort law curriculum. Clearly Justice Wilson made an impact on Canadian tort law. This paper focuses squarely on her tort decisions, analyzing the m as a body with a view to determining whether a coherent tort the ory or philosophy underpins the m. at first glance, a thread to connect this body of decisions is elusive; indeed, on the surface, a number of the m appear to contradict one another. For example, based on her Bhadauria judgment in which she boldly created a new <b>tort</b> <b>of</b> <b>discrimination,</b> we might regard Justice Wilson as a tort expansionist. Yet elsewhere, we see her protecting other areas of law from incursion by tort (contract law in Dominion Chain v. Eastern Construction and family law in Frame v. Smith). and in other decisions, she positions herself somewhere between these poles, championing an incremental expansion of tort law where precedent allows and justice demands (for example, in Kamloops and Crocker v. Sundance). But digging deeper into Justice Wilson’s tort decisions, common the mes emerge which link the m to one another and ground the m firmly in the broader context of her judicial work as a whole. In tort as in other areas of law, we find Justice Wilson striving to make decisions that are respectful of the constraints within which she operates as an appellate judge, true to her liberal principles, and responsive to the practical concerns of the parties appearing before her...|$|E
