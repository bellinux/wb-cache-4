5000|$|Dental bonding is {{a dental}} {{procedure}} {{in which a}} dentist applies a tooth-colored resin material (a durable plastic material) and cures it with visible, blue light. This ultimately [...] "bonds" [...] the material to the <b>tooth</b> and improves the overall appearance of <b>teeth.</b> <b>Tooth</b> <b>bonding</b> techniques have various clinical applications including operative dentistry and preventive dentistry as well as cosmetic and pediatric dentistry, prosthodontics, and orthodontics.|$|R
40|$|This article {{reports the}} cases of two young {{children}} aged 4 and 5 years, in whom biological restorations using <b>tooth</b> fragments were placed in primary molars with severely damaged crowns due to extensive carious lesions. After radiographic and clinical evaluation, <b>tooth</b> fragments obtained from extracted <b>teeth</b> in stock were autoclaved, adjusted to the prepared cavity and <b>bonded</b> to the remaining <b>tooth</b> structure with either adhesive system (Case 1) or dual-cure resin-based cement (Case 2) over a calcium hydroxide layer and a glass ionomer cement base. Occlusal adjustment was performed and topical sodium fluoride was applied to <b>tooth</b> surface. Periodical clinical and radiographic controls were carried out and the restored <b>teeth</b> were followed up for 4 and 3 years, respectively, until exfoliation. In these two reports, the technical aspects are described and the benefits and disadvantages of biological restorations as an alternative treatment for rehabilitation of severely destroyed primary molars are discussed.

Forty-two human third molars were flattened until the dentin was exposed and were randomly distributed into three groups of self-etching adhesive systems: Clearfil ™ SE Bond containing 5 % QAMP (experimental group), Clearfil ™ Protect Bond (positive control) and Clearfil ™ SE Bond (negative control). After light curing, three 1 mm-increments of composite resin were bonded to each dentin surface. A total of thirty of these <b>bonded</b> <b>teeth</b> (10 <b>teeth</b> per group) was sectioned to obtain stick-shaped specimens and tested under tensile stress immediately, and after 6 and 12 months of storage in distilled water.

40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the effect of various dental restoration materials on dose distribution in radiotherapy of head and neck cancer with 6 MV photon beam of a medical linac. Setting and Design: The dental restorations include <b>tooth,</b> <b>tooth</b> with amalgam, <b>tooth</b> with Ni-Cr alloy, and <b>tooth</b> with Ceramco. Dose perturbation due to the dental restorations on 6 MV beam of Siemens Primus linac was calculated by MCNPX Monte Carlo code. These dental materials were separately simulated in a cubic water phantom. Materials and Methods: Photon percentage dose change in the presence of <b>tooth,</b> <b>tooth</b> with amalgam, <b>tooth</b> with Ni-Cr alloy, and <b>tooth</b> with Ceramco was calculated at various depths on the central axis of the beam relative to the dose in water. In another evaluation, the absolute dose (cGy) for water, <b>tooth,</b> <b>tooth</b> with amalgam, <b>tooth</b> with Ni-Cr alloy, and <b>tooth</b> with Ceramco was obtained by calculating 100 cGy dose at 0. 75 cm depth in the water phantom. Results: Based on the calculations performed, maximum percentage dose change due to backscattering was 11 %, 8 %, 6 %, and 4 % for amalgam, Ni-Cr alloy, Ceramco and <b>tooth</b> at depth of 0. 75 cm, respectively. The maximum dose perturbation by amalgam is due to its higher mass density and atomic number. Conclusion: Ignoring the effect of dental restoration compositions on dose distribution causes discrepancy in clinical treatment planning system calculations...|$|R

40|$|Supernumerary <b>teeth</b> are dental abnormalies in the {{permanent}} dentition {{and the primary}} dentition. The etiol-ogy is unclear, but it may occur due to dichotomy of the <b>tooth</b> bud or hyperactivity of dental lamina. They occur more in {{the permanent}} dentition than in the primary dentition, with the most common site being the premaxil-lary area. Supernumerary <b>teeth</b> can be classified by morphology and position. Supplemental <b>tooth</b> refers to nor-mal shape <b>tooth.</b> The treatment of supernumerary <b>teeth</b> depends on its shape, position, effect on dentition, and child's physiological condition.
