The evaluation was based on the Altman Z-score of financial health and <b>the</b> weighted <b>average</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital (WACC). Data presented in 2007 - 2010 financial reports compiled by selected companies were also employed. Using the signed-rank test the hypothesis the impact of the financial crisis on the financial health of selected companies was examined. The same test was applied to <b>the</b> weighted <b>average</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital. Furthermore, dependencies between financial health and <b>the</b> weighted <b>average</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital during individual years in concern were investigated. This dependency was tested by means of Spearman coefficient, determination index a correlation coefficient. According to the tests of statistical hypotheses the companies were not affected by a lower Altman Z-score during the crisis; i. e. Their performance was not worse than before the crisis. The impact of the crisis on <b>the</b> weighted <b>average</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital was not proven either. Dependency between both indicators (the Altman Z-score and <b>the</b> weighted <b>average</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital) was not established. The aim of this Article was to evaluate the impact of the financial crisis and to find possible dependency between stability (represented by the Altman Z-score) and <b>the</b> weighted <b>average</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital. It was ascertained that the financial crisis did not have any significant influence on the financial performance of the selected companies.

5|$|As more middle-class and {{affluent}} people {{fled the}} city to the relative quiet and open spaces of the suburbs, the urban centers deteriorated and lost population. At the same time that cities were experiencing a lower tax base due to the flight of higher income earners, pressures from The New Deal forced them to offer pensions and other benefits, increasing <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> benefits per employee by 1,629percent. This was in addition to hiring an average of 20percent more employees to serve the ever shrinking cities. More Americans were driving cars and fewer were using public transportation, and it was not practical to extend to the suburbs. At the same time, the number of surface roads exploded to serve the ever-increasing numbers of individually owned cars, further burdening city and country resources. During this time, the perception of using public transportation turned more negative. In what is arguably the most extreme example, Detroit, the fifth largest city in the United States in 1950 with 1,849,568 residents, had shrunk to 706,585 by 2010, a reduction of 62 percent.|$|E

Since the hip protectors were not effective in preventing hip fractures in our study, the main objective became to examine whether the use of hip protectors results in lower <b>average</b> <b>costs</b> per participant in the hip protector group as compared with the control group. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>average</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> a hip fracture and subsequent rehabilitation in frail, institutionalized elderly were calculated. Residents from apartment houses for the elderly, homes for the elderly and nursing homes with a high risk for hip fractures were randomized to the hip protector group (n = 276) or control group (n = 285). Costs were calculated for the hip fracture and subsequent rehabilitation until 1 year after the fracture. Six months after each hip fracture, a nurse was interviewed and after 12 months, a questionnaire was sent to the general practitioner or nursing home physician to determine the utilization of health care resources. Differences in costs between the groups were analyzed using non-parametric bootstrapping. Eighteen hip fractures occurred in the intervention group and 20 hip fractures (in 19 persons) in the control group (log rank P-value = 0. 86). <b>The</b> <b>average</b> <b>costs</b> per participant, including the <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> the intervention, were € 913 in the intervention group and 502 in the control group (<b>cost</b> difference <b>of</b> €- 411; 95 % confidence interval: - 723; 57). <b>The</b> <b>average</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> a hip fracture and subsequent rehabilitation were € 8100 (95 % CI: 6716 - 10, 010).
