25|$|There is some {{indication}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> administration may be pursuing {{a new approach}} to development, one moving away from military-led development projects and toward a more independent USAID that will include in its new strategy an effort to reduce poor governance.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Obama</b> administration’s {{decision}} not to place missile defense systems in Poland and the Czech Republic provides an interesting view into the work in progress <b>that</b> is <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> administration’s foreign policy regarding Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.

25|$|In {{his victory}} {{speech on the}} night of his election, President Obama {{repeated}} his promise to Sasha and Malia to get a puppy to take with them to the White House. The selection was slow because Malia is allergic to animal dander; the president subsequently said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> choice had been narrowed down to either a labradoodle or a Portuguese Water Dog, and that they hoped to find a shelter animal. On April 12, 2009, it was reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Obamas</b> had adopted a six-month-old Portuguese Water Dog given to them as a gift by Senator Ted Kennedy; Malia and Sasha named the dog Bo.

25|$|On September 4, Attorney General Eric Holder, as {{required}} by law, notified Speaker of the House John Boehner <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> administration had determined {{that it should not}} enforce the federal statutes that define spouse in a way that excludes same-sex spouses. He cited Windsor and the decision in Cooper-Harris the previous week as well as BLAG's withdrawal from litigation challenging the statutes in question. Advocates for same-sex spouses of veterans welcomed the announcement, but noted that the question of the rights of such spouses remained uncertain if they live in states that do not recognize their marriage.|$|E
25|$|There is also {{tension between}} India and Pakistan who both possess nuclear weapons. This {{conflict}} has been ongoing since August 1947 after the Partition of India.

2500|$|The Black Panther {{case had}} been {{receiving}} more coverage from conservative media outlets than from other ones. A Newsweek op-ed implied {{that this is}} because the case was not newsworthy, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> conservative media is attempting to stage [...] "an effective piece of political theater <b>that</b> hurts <b>the</b> <b>Obama</b> administration". According to conservative radio host Scott Hennen and co-author Jim Denney, writing in 2011, the case was [...] "practically ignored by the mainstream media".|$|R

5000|$|Gas {{atomization}} {{technology was}} used to make titanium powder with processes that are 10 times more efficient than traditional powder-making methods, which significantly lowers the cost of titanium powder to manufacturers.
