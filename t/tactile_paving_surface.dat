40|$|AbstractIn {{recent years}} {{increased}} the research {{interest in the}} development of different approaches to support the mobility of the visually impaired. The automatic detection of <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> <b>surface</b> is one important topic of research, not only to help the mobility of visually impaired persons, but also for use in the displacement of autonomous robots, providing a safely route and warnings. In this paper we propose an approach for <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> <b>surface</b> detection in real-time with the purpose to assist visually impaired persons. It uses computer vision algorithms combined with decision tree to eliminate some possible false alarms. We assume the visually impaired persons holds a smartphone, which is used to obtain images, as well as to assist him by audio feedback to keep it on the <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> <b>surface.</b> This problem is very challenging, mainly due to illumination changes, occlusion, image noise and resolution, as well as different possible colors of the tactile paving surfaces. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach works well in low resolution images, effectively detecting the tactile paving surfaces in real test scenarios...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tactile</b> <b>paving</b> {{has been}} {{designed}} {{in response to the}} needs of vision-impaired pedestrians to be independent, mobile, confident and safe when using the external environment. <b>Tactile</b> <b>paving</b> is not without its critics because it can adversely affect other pedestrians particularly older people, and those with mobility impairments. Interviews were conducted at eight selected road crossing sites in Edinburgh to determine older people’s experiences of using specific road crossings, in particular their views and experiences of using <b>tactile</b> <b>paving.</b> Two hundred participants were interviewed who were aged 65 years and older, and who appeared not to have a significant health issue or disability that was affecting their mobility. In addition, eight pedestrians who had significant mobility issues and 30 pedestrians who had moderate to severe vision impairment were interviewed. Findings demonstrate the importance of training in <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> for pedestrians with a vision impairment; the need for a review of the guidance on <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> such that greater emphasis is placed on detectability and tonal contrast, and tonal contrast; a consideration as to whether seven types of <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> is too many; and the need to minimise the effects of topography, particularly slope at road crossings...|$|R
50|$|Where {{installation}} of <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> of a specified color e.g. red blister paving at a controlled crossing, {{would result in}} the <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> being of a similar color to the surrounding paving a contrast strip of at least 150mm should be installed to clearly demarcate the tactile area.|$|R
5000|$|The Department of Transport {{guidance}} on the installation {{and use of}} <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> places a heavy emphasis {{on the role of}} contrast. The guidance repeatedly states that <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> should be chosen to provide strong color contrast with the surrounding paving material as studies have shown that this aids partially sighted individuals. Most <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> is available in a range of colors and materials making good color contrast easy to achieve with appropriate choice of tactile paving.There are only two cases where the color of a tactile has a specific meaning: ...|$|R

50|$|The {{profile of}} the {{corduroy}} tactile surface comprises rounded bars running transversely across the direction of pedestrian travel. The bars are 6mm (±0.5) high, 20mm wide and spaced 50mm from the centre of one bar to {{the centre of the}} next. The <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> units can be manufactured in any suitable <b>paving</b> material. The <b>surface</b> is usually buff coloured, but can be any colour, other than red, that provides a good contrast with the surrounding area to assist partially sighted people.|$|R

50|$|In the {{metropolitan}} cities of Mumbai and Delhi, warning and directional blocks, resembling those in Japan, have been installed in sidewalks leading to, and inside metro stations. Delhi Metro {{is the most}} accessible public transport infrastructure in the country. It has <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> from entry to exit. Such tiles can also be located on pavements near shopping plazas, and particularly around the Delhi University campus. These tiles come in yellow. Although, the tiles within the metro stations are continually cared-for, the maintenance of those set over the sidewalks is generally neglected. The Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi also has <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> on its walkways.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> {{was developed}} by Seiichi Miyake in 1965. The paving was first introduced in a street in Okayama city, Japan, in 1967. Its use gradually spread in Japan and then around the world.|$|R
50|$|The {{usage of}} <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> in many {{circumstances}} {{will be required}} in the United States {{as part of the}} Americans with Disabilities Act. Adoption of truncated dome-mats has been controversial in some areas including Sacramento, CA.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tactile</b> <b>paving</b> (also called {{truncated}} domes, detectable warnings, Tactile Ground Surface Indicators, detectable warning surfaces) is {{a system}} of textured ground surface indicator found on footpaths, stairs and train station platforms to assist pedestrians who are visually impaired.|$|R
40|$|In {{a globalized}} society, {{movement}} of people and goods {{play a key role}} foreconomy and wealth. In order to avoid discrimination, segregation andalienation each and every individual citizen {{needs to be able to}} participate inthe globalization. This increases the number of times that people have to travel. For a large number of groups of individuals, i. e. blind persons and persons withvisual impairment, this is a large challenge which might be hard to tackle bythemselves. <b>Tactile</b> <b>paving</b> is one of many ways to increase the accessibility andindependency for this group of people. These plates are used to form guidancesurfaces were natural guidance doesn´t exists, for example on platforms whichlack wall or other edges. When the <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> are used on platforms theysuffer great wear due to the maintenance caused by the outside weatherconditions. Maintaining the <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> during the winter is necessary in order tokeep any of its function. Therefore this project has aimed to find the socioeconomicrelation between maintenance cost, life time and construction costs fortactile pavers and the economic gain from increased accessibility. The work has been characterized by information gathering but astocktaking of the railway stations in the region has also been a part of theproject. The region includes the counties of Norr- and Västerbotten in Sweden,which also forms the geographical limitations of this project. This work has shown that today the maintenance of the <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> onstation platforms are surrounded by huge difficulties. The task of keeping thepaving's full functionality during the winter is considered hard for theindividual worker. The problem seems to be slightly unknown to managementwith the responsibility no longer are theirs. This lack of power of action may beseen as the core to the issue concerning tactile pavers today. When the question of the existence of <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> on platforms is broughtup with the visually disabled community, it seems like this issue is such a smallpart of their lives that they don't have any strict opinion about it. The socio-economic analysis that has been conducted during the projectreveals that a large number of daily passengers are required to justify tactilepaving. Due to problems of finding exact values for the analysis manyassumptions have been made. Therefore the result of 330 passengers per dayshould be seen as maximum threshold value. Station with a greater number ofpassengers should have <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> from a socio-economic perspective. This project is a part of a field where few earlier studies have been made,probably due to that winter maintenance of <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> is a rather newphenomena. The lack of preview work has made it to come to certainconclusions. The absence of knowledge also stretches to people who are workingwithin the field and this might lead to low communication among professionalswhich might be the core issue to why platforms do not provide the amount ofaccessibility today as they meant to.

40|$|In {{light of}} our ageing {{population}} {{it is important}} that the urban environment is easily accessible and hence supports older adults’ independence. <b>Tactile</b> ‘blister’ <b>paving</b> was originally designed to provide guidance for visually impaired people at pedestrian crossings. However, as research links irregular surfaces to falls in older adults, such paving may have an adverse effect on older people. We investigated the effects of <b>tactile</b> <b>paving</b> on older adults’ gait in a scenario closely resembling “crossing the street”. Gait analysis of 32 healthy older adults showed that tactile, as compared to smooth, paving increases the variability in timing of foot placement by 20 %, thereby indicating a disturbance of the rhythmic gait pattern. Moreover, toe-clearance during the swing phase increased by 7 % on <b>tactile</b> <b>paving,</b> and the ability to stop upon cue from the traffic light was compromised. These results need to be viewed under consideration of the limitations associated with laboratory studies and real world analysis is needed to fully understand their implications for urban design...|$|R

40|$|To {{estimate}} {{the impact of}} light-colored surfaces (roofs and pavements) and urban vegetation (trees, grass, shrubs) on meteorology and air quality of a city, {{it is essential to}} accurately {{estimate the}} fraction of various urban surfaces. In this report, we estimate the fabric of Sacramento by analyzing high-resolution (0. 30 -m) aerial color photographs of about 65 square km of the urban area. The analysis show that in downtown Sacramento, vegetation as seen from above the canopy covers 30 % of the area, whereas roofs cover 23 % and <b>paved</b> <b>surface</b> 41 %. Under-the-canopy fabric consists of 52 % <b>paved</b> <b>surfaces,</b> 26 % roofs, and 12 % grass. In the industrial areas, vegetation covers 8 - 14 % of the area, roofs cover 19 - 23 %, and <b>paved</b> <b>surfaces</b> cover 29 - 44 %. The surface-type percentages in the office areas are 21 % trees, 16 % roofs, and 49 % <b>paved</b> <b>surfaces.</b> In commercial areas,vegetation covers 5 - 20 %, roofs 19 - 20 %, <b>paved</b> <b>surfaces</b> 44 - 68 %. Residential areas exhibit a wide range of percentages of surface-types. On average, vegetation covers about 36 % of the area, roofs cover about 20 %, and <b>paved</b> <b>surfaces</b> about 28 %. Trees mostly shade streets, parking lots, grass, and sidewalks. Under the canopy the percentage of <b>paved</b> <b>surfaces</b> is significantly higher. In most non-residential areas, <b>paved</b> <b>surfaces</b> cover 50 - 70 % of the area. In residential areas, on average, <b>paved</b> <b>surfaces</b> cover about 35 % of the area. For an area of roughly 800 sq. km, defining most of metropolitan Sacramento, about half is residential. The total roof area is about 150 sq. km and the total <b>paved</b> <b>surfaces</b> (roads, parking areas, sidewalks) is about 310 sq. km. The total vegetated area is about 230 sq. km...|$|R
50|$|Tactile {{surfacing}} patterns (or tactile pavings) may be laid flush {{within the}} adjacent footways (US: sidewalks), so that visually impaired pedestrians can locate the control box and cone device and {{know when they}} have reached the other side.
