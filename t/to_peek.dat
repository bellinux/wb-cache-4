500|$|Act II {{begins with}} Midas enamored {{with his new}} power of turning things to gold. However, his courtiers {{complain}} of being forced to wear heavy golden clothing. Midas rebukes them, saying [...] "I am a God!". But Midas himself begins to experience the problems of turning everything he touches to gold: he cannot eat, for example. He starts to regret his wish, saying [...] "Oh! fool! to wish to change all things to gold! / Blind Ideot that I was!". Midas prays to Bacchus to take away his power, begging [...] "Make me a hind, clothe me in ragged skins— / And let my food be bread, unsavoury roots, / But take from me the frightful curse of gold". Midas has his courtiers sacrifice to the gods {{to see if he}} can be relieved of his curse; Bacchus relents and tells him to bathe in the river. The courtiers find it strange that he does not remove his crown while he swims; one of them resolves <b>to</b> <b>peek</b> under his crown while he is sleeping. Returning from his swim, Midas celebrates nature, saying gold [...] "is a sordid, base and dirty thing;— / Look at the grass, the sky, the trees, the flowers, / These are Joves treasures & they are not gold".|$|E

500|$|In {{the third}} quarter Roy Upchurch fumbled the ball at the Tech nine after a long run, [...] negating the lone scoring {{opportunity}} for either team in {{the third quarter}}. Still down by {{a point in the}} fourth quarter, McElroy hit Marquis Maze for a 48-yard completion to the Virginia Tech six-yard line, and Ingram scored a touchdown on the next play. A successful two-point conversion pass from McElroy to Colin Peek gave Alabama a 24–17 lead. On the ensuing kickoff, Davon Morgan fumbled and Chris Rogers recovered for the Tide at the Tech 21. The following Alabama drive stalled at the 3, but Tiffin's fourth field goal made the score 27–17. Poor kickoff coverage and penalties set up a 32-yard Williams that run cut the lead to 27–24 late in the fourth quarter. Alabama quickly struck back as Ingram rushed for 39 yards, McElroy completed a 19-yard pass <b>to</b> <b>Peek,</b> and then threw to Ingram for an 18-yard touchdown and a 34–24 lead. The Hokies never threatened to score again and Alabama won its opener, 34–24. Ingram led the Tide with 150 yards rushing on 26 carries and a pair of touchdowns, and he was named the SEC Offensive Player of the Week. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Hokies to 11–1.|$|E
500|$|Another summertime {{birthday}} celebration in the Netherlands {{was that of}} Wilhelmina's mother, Queen-Regent Emma, who after Wilhelmina attained adulthood generally spent her own birthday, 2 August, at Soestdijk Palace in Baarn. [...] Until her death in 1934, Emma received an annual floral tribute from the townsfolk on her birthday. [...] In 1937 Wilhelmina's daughter and heiress, Princess Juliana, took up residence at Soestdijk Palace following her marriage, and the townsfolk made their floral presentation to her, moving the date to Juliana's birthday, 30 April. In September 1948 Juliana ascended to the Dutch throne and from 1949 onwards Koninginnedag was on her birthday. [...] The change in date attracted immediate approval from Dutch children, who gained an extra day of holiday. [...] The first observance of the holiday on the new date included a huge circus at the Amsterdam Olympic Stadium—one not attended by the royal family, who remained at Soestdijk Palace. [...] Queen Juliana retained the floral tribute, staying each year on Koninginnedag at Soestdijk Palace to receive it. [...] The parade became televised in the 1950s, and Koninginnedag increasingly became a national holiday, with workers given the day off. Juliana {{had a reputation as}} a [...] "queen of the people", and according <b>to</b> <b>Peek,</b> [...] "it felt as if she invited her subjects to the royal home".|$|E

[...] He honored her memory with a 1979 semi-autobiographical novel, eponymously titled Mira. A new volume of his memoirs saw print in Honolulu in 1980, as Praful de pe tobă ("The Dust on the Drum"). It was taped by Virgil Ierunca and serialized by Radio Free Europe (RFE), which broadcast clandestinely into Romania.|$|E

2500|$|Notable {{critics of}} the {{experiments}} include psychologists Dr. David Marks and Dr. Richard Kammann, who published a description of how Geller could have cheated in an informal test of his so-called psychic powers in 1977. Their 1978 article in Nature and 1980 book The Psychology of the Psychic (2nd ed. 2000) described how a normal explanation was possible for Geller's alleged psychic powers. Marks and Kammann found evidence that while at SRI, Geller was allowed <b>to</b> <b>peek</b> {{through a hole in}} the laboratory wall separating Geller from the drawings he was being invited to reproduce. The drawings he was asked to reproduce were placed on a wall opposite the peep hole which the investigators Targ and Puthoff had stuffed with cotton gauze. In addition to this error, the investigators had also allowed Geller access to a two-way intercom enabling Geller to listen to the investigators' conversation during the times when they were choosing and/or displaying the target drawings. These basic errors indicate the high importance of ensuring that psychologists, magicians or other people with an in-depth knowledge of perception, who are trained in methods for blocking sensory cues, be present during the testing of psychics. Marks, after evaluating the experiments, wrote that none of Geller's paranormal claims had been demonstrated in scientifically controlled conditions, concluding that [...] "Geller has no psychic ability whatsoever. However, I believe him to be a very clever, well-practiced magician." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{synthetic}} thermoplastic polymer polyetheretherketone (PEEK) {{is becoming}} a popular component of clinical orthopedic and spinal applications, but its practical use suffers from several limitations. Although PEEK is biocompatible, chemically stable, radiolucent and has an elastic modulus {{similar to that of}} normal human bone, it is biologically inert, preventing good integration with adjacent bone tissues upon implantation. Recent efforts have focused on increasing the bioactivity of <b>PEEK</b> <b>to</b> improve the bone-implant interface. Two main strategies have been used to overcome the inert character of PEEK. One approach is surface modification <b>to</b> activate <b>PEEK</b> through surface treatment alone or in combination with a surface coating. Another strategy is <b>to</b> prepare bioactive <b>PEEK</b> composites by impregnating bioactive materials into PEEK substrate. Researchers believe that modified bioactive PEEK will have a wide range of orthopedic applications...|$|R
