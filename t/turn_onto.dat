5|$|Route 41 and County Route 573 {{continue}} {{north on}} Highland Avenue and cross into Haddonfield, {{where the road}} becomes Chews Landing Road. The two routes meet County Route 551 Spur (Kings Highway), and they bear to the right onto Kings Highway, heading northeast. They pass over New Jersey Transit’s Atlantic City Line and the PATCO Speedline and then intersect County Route 561 (Haddon Avenue) Past CR 561, the road crosses the Cooper River into Cherry Hill Township. Route 41 and County Route 573 make a right <b>turn</b> <b>onto</b> a four-lane divided highway and intersect Route 154 (Brace Road). At this point, County Route 573 ends and Route 41 makes a left <b>turn</b> <b>onto</b> a six-lane divided highway, becoming state-maintained again and forming a concurrency with Route 154.|$|E
5|$|After {{one block}} of Main Street, NY32 and NY212 <b>turn</b> <b>onto</b> Market Street, then east onto Ulster Avenue after another block. As it crosses the {{railroad}} tracks and leaves the village, the road widens and becomes a commercial highway just before reaching a Thruway exit. This, the fourth time NY32 has crossed the Thruway, {{is the first time}} it does so at an exit. Beyond the overpass, the concurrency ends when NY32 turns and heads north once again. A tight nearby on-ramp provides access to the southbound Thruway. NY32 does not enter the Catskills but provides access to them along this stretch.|$|E

5|$|The plane {{took off}} {{normally}} from runway 17 (today's runway 18) at 12:55am Central Time on Tuesday, February 3. Dwyer, {{the owner of}} the flight service company, witnessed the take-off from a platform outside the control tower. He was able to see clearly the aircraft's tail light for most of the brief flight, which started with an initial left <b>turn</b> <b>onto</b> a northwesterly heading and a climb to 800ft. The tail light was then observed gradually descending until it disappeared out of view. Around 1:00am, when Peterson failed to make the expected radio contact, repeated attempts to establish communication were made, at Dwyer's request, by the radio operator, but they were all unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|PA 222 {{begins at}} an {{interchange}} with I-78/PA 309 {{in the community}} of Dorneyville in South Whitehall Township in Lehigh County, where the road continues southwest as US 222 towards Reading. From this interchange, PA 222 heads northeast on four-lane divided Hamilton Boulevard, passing between Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom to the north and businesses to the south. Direct access to Dorney Park is limited to PA 222 southbound, as northbound traffic must make a left <b>turn</b> <b>onto</b> Lincoln Avenue to access the park. After passing the amusement park, the route splits into two carriageways, with PA 222 north remaining on Hamilton Boulevard and PA 222 south following the newer Hamilton Boulevard Bypass to the north. A short distance to the east, the road intersects Cedar Crest Boulevard, a major northsouth arterial in the Allentown metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|The race's {{fourth stage}} saw very rainy {{conditions}} throughout, which caused the roads to turn muddy and streams nearby the roads to overflow. The thirty riders that began the stage took the wrong <b>turn</b> <b>onto</b> Sabina rode for over , {{once they had}} reached Civita Castellana, before realizing their errors. This, when combined with the weather and road conditions, caused the riders to protest to the race jury and get the stage cancelled. The riders then road a train to Rome {{for the start of}} the next stage. At the finish in Rome there were over 20,000 paying spectators waiting to see the finish of the stage. When news broke of the stage's cancelling, the spectators grew angry and the organizers refunded their tickets they had purchased to view the race. The route of the added ninth stage came from the route of the Giro di Lombardia, despite the initial protest of the Italian Velocopie Union. The prize money for the stage was split among the fourteen riders that noticed the mistake.|$|E

Heading north along the crest of the Point Loma peninsula, it passed through Fort Rosecrans Military Reservation and Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery before exiting the former through a gate and entering the Wooded Area neighborhood of Point Loma as Catalina Boulevard. SR209 passed through this residential neighborhood and provided access to Point Loma Nazarene University. The SR209 designation then made a right <b>turn</b> <b>onto</b> Cañon Street, curved to the southeast, and went downhill to the bayside location of the old La Playa Trail. At the intersection with Rosecrans Street, the designation made a turn to the northeast at a right angle onto Rosecrans.|$|E

25|$|Construction of {{the line}} started in December 1928 During construction, the Ekeberg Line past Jomfrubråten was moved. Instead of {{following}} Kongsveien, it was moved further up.

The Simensbråten Line would thus cross under the Ekebergn Line and then through a curve <b>turn</b> <b>onto</b> its right-of-way. The Simensbråten Line was completed in mid-1931 and It was officially opened on 30 September 1931. The line was never profitable, and needed municipal grants to operate.|$|E
