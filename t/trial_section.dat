60|$|This, as the {{proximate}} cause of our railway system, {{has changed the}} face of the country, the course of trade, and the habits of the people. Consider, first, the complicated sets of changes that precede the making of every railway--the provisional arrangements, the meetings, the registration, the <b>trial</b> <b>section,</b> the parliamentary survey, the lithographed plans, the books of reference, the local deposits and notices, the application to Parliament, the passing Standing-Orders Committee, the first, second, and third readings: each of which brief heads indicates a multiplicity of transactions, and the development of sundry occupations--as those of engineers, surveyors, lithographers, parliamentary agents, share-brokers; and the creation of sundry others--as those of traffic-takers, reference-takers. Consider, next, the yet more marked changes implied in railway construction--the cuttings, embankings, tunnellings, diversions of roads; the building of bridges, and stations; the laying down of ballast, sleepers, and rails; the making of engines, tenders, carriages, and waggons: which processes, acting upon numerous trades, increase the importation of timber, the quarrying of stone, the manufacture of iron, the mining of coal, the burning of bricks: institute a variety of special manufactures weekly advertised in the Railway Times; and, finally, open the way to sundry new occupations, as those of drivers, stokers, cleaners, plate-layers, etc., etc. And then consider the changes, more numerous and involved still, which railways in action produce on the community at large. The organisation of every business is more or less modified: ease of communication makes it better to do directly what was before done by proxy; agencies are established where previously they would not have paid; goods are obtained from remote wholesale houses instead of near retail ones; and commodities are used which distance once rendered inaccessible. Again, the rapidity and small cost of carriage tend to specialise more than ever the industries of different districts--to confine each manufacture to the parts in which, from local advantages, it can be best carried on. Further, the diminished cost of carriage, facilitating distribution, equalises prices, and also, on the average, lowers prices: thus bringing divers articles within the means of those before unable to buy them, and so increasing their comforts and improving their habits. At the same time the practice of travelling is immensely extended. Classes who never before thought of it, take annual trips to the sea; visit their distant relations; make tours; and so we are benefited in body, feelings, and intellect. Moreover, the more prompt transmission of letters and of news produces further changes--makes the pulse of the nation faster. Yet more, there arises a wide dissemination of cheap literature through railway book-stalls, and of advertisements in railway carriages: both of them aiding ulterior progress.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn Lithuania {{more than}} third (33. 9 %) of state roads are gravel roads. Maintenance of these roads needs large budget and {{operation}} of them results in social discomfort. The best method to improve driving conditions and avoid social discomfort for the inhabitants living close to gravel roads is to reduce dustiness using suppressants or even construct asphalt pavement. But, dust suppressants are not enough efficient due to wet and rainy climate in Lithuania. Also, the performance of conventional asphalt pavement used for low-volume roads was unsatisfactory, due to thin frost resistance layer or weak subgrade. And those additional works significantly increase road construction costs up to 25 %. As alternative solution the use of soft asphalt and Otta Seal technologies were proposed. Therefore, in 2012 the <b>trial</b> <b>sections</b> were constructed in order to clarify the effectiveness and functionality of soft asphalt and Otta Seal technologies under current traffic and climate conditions. Measurements of roughness and condition of soft asphalt pavement and Otta Seal were carried out in spring, summer (only condition of soft asphalt pavement) and autumn every year. The average roughness of all the <b>trial</b> <b>sections</b> with soft asphalt pavement {{or most of the}} <b>trial</b> <b>sections</b> with double Otta Seal complies with the requirements (≤ 3. 5 m/km) to the roads of regional significance. Besides, the roughness of the <b>trial</b> <b>sections</b> with soft asphalt {{is similar to that of}} the sections with asphalt base course-pavement. <b>Trial</b> road <b>sections</b> with soft asphalt pavement are in good condition after 30 – 32 months of operation, and longitudinal cracks were observed as the main defect, which tends to heal in summer period. The Otta Seal also represented the ability to self-heal under high pavement temperature. However, the condition of <b>trial</b> <b>sections</b> with Otta Seal were not as good as soft asphalt pavement. The formation of the most defects were identified as causes of inappropriate amount of binder, insufficient maintenance in summer period and unqualified procedure of applying Otta Seal. Based on the results of this research the conclusions and recommendations were made for further application of soft asphalt and Otta Seal in Lithuania...|$|R

The rehabilitation of a structural layer on the EN 14 (Portuguese national highway 14) using high modulus asphalt concrete (HMAC) has been studied. The project workplan involved the laboratory design of the mixture by undertaking performance tests and constructing <b>trial</b> <b>sections</b> to observe the effectiveness of the mixture. Prismatic specimens were extracted from these <b>trial</b> <b>sections</b> and similar specimens have been produced in the laboratory. Fundamental tests, namely, repetitive four-point bending, were performed on both specimens for several temperatures and loading conditions. This made it possible to determine their mechanical properties, stiffness modulus and phase angle.

60|$|Space permitting, {{we might}} {{show how the}} {{localization}} o£ special industries in special parts of a kingdom, {{as well as the}} minute subdivision of labour in the making of each commodity, are similarly determined. Or, turning to a somewhat different order of illustrations, we might dwell on the multitudinous changes--material, intellectual, moral,--caused by printing; or the further extensive series of changes wrought by gunpowder. But leaving the intermediate phases of social development, let us take a few illustrations from its most recent and its passing phases. To trace the effects of steam-power, in its manifold applications to mining, navigation, and manufactures of all kinds, would carry us into unmanageable detail. Let us confine ourselves to the latest embodiment of steam power--the locomotive engine. This, as the proximate cause of our railway system, has changed the face of the country, the course of trade, and the habits of the people. Consider, first, the complicated sets of changes that precede the making of every railway--the provisional arrangements, the meetings, the registration, the <b>trial</b> <b>section,</b> the parliamentary survey, the lithographed plans, the books of reference, the local deposits and notices, the application to Parliament, the passing Standing Orders Committee, the first, second, and third readings: each of which brief heads indicates a multiplicity of transactions, and the extra development of sundry occupations--as those of engineers, surveyors, lithographers, parliamentary agents, share-brokers; and the creation of sundry others--as those of traffic-takers, reference-takers. Consider, next, the yet more marked changes implied in railway construction--the cuttings, embankings, tunnellings, diversions of roads; the building of bridges and stations, the laying down of ballast, sleepers, and rails; the making of engines, tenders, carriages, and waggons: which processes, acting on numerous trades, increase the importation of timber, the quarrying of stone, the manufacture of iron, the mining of coal, the burning of bricks; institute a variety of special manufactures weekly advertised in the Railway Times; and, finally, open the way to sundry new occupations, as those of drivers, stokers, cleaners, plate-layers, &c., &c. And then consider the changes, still more numerous and involved, which railways in action produce on the community at large. Business agencies are established where previously they would not have paid; goods are obtained from remote wholesale houses instead of near retail ones; and commodities are used which distance once rendered inaccessible. Again, the diminished cost of carriage tends to specialize more than ever the industries of different districts--to confine each manufacture to the parts in which, from local advantages, it can be best carried on. Further, the fall in freights, facilitating distribution, equalizes prices, and also, on the average, lowers prices: thus bringing divers articles within the means of those before unable to buy them, and so increasing their comforts and improving their habits. At the same time the practice of travelling is immensely extended. People who never before dreamed of it, take trips to the sea; visit their distant relations; make tours; and so we are benefited in body, feelings, and ideas. The more prompt transmission of letters and of news produces other marked changes--makes the pulse of the nation faster. Once more, there arises a wide dissemination of cheap literature through railway book-stalls, and of advertisements in railway carriages: both of them aiding ulterior progress. And the countless changes here briefly indicated are consequent on the invention of the locomotive engine. The social organism has been rendered more heterogeneous in virtue of the many new occupations introduced, and the many old ones further specialized; prices of nearly all things in every place have been altered; each trader has modified his way of doing business; and every person has been affected in his actions, thoughts, emotions.|$|E
