A conventional single <b>token</b> <b>access</b> protocol was employed at the lowest layer, with fixed packet sizes for voice and variable for data.

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a {{multicast}} protocol for a multihop, mobile wireless network with cluster based routing and <b>token</b> <b>access</b> protocol within each cluster. The multicast protocol uses a shared tree which is dynamically updated {{to adjust to}} changes in topology and membership #i. e. dynamic joins and quits#. Two options for tree maintenance have been simulated and evaluated: "hard state" #i. e. each connection must be explicitly cleared# and "soft state" #each connection is automatically timed out and must be refreshed#. For the soft state policy, the performance of di#erentchoices of timeout and refresh timers is #rst analyzed {{for a range of}} node mobilityvalues. Next, soft state and hard state policies are compared based on throughput, join delay, and control overhead criteria.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{multicast}} protocol which builds upon a cluster based wireless network infrastructure. First, we introduce the network infrastructure which includes several innovative features such as: minimum change cluster formation; dynamic priority <b>token</b> <b>access</b> protocol, and; distributed hierarchical routing. Then, for this infrastructure we propose a multicast protocol which is inspired by the Core Based Tree approach developed for the internet. We show that the multicast protocol is robust to mobility, has low bandwidth overhead and latency, scales well with membership group size, and can be generalized to other wireless infrastructure. I.

40|$|The fiber {{distributed}} {{data interface}} (FDDI) is an ANSI draft proposed standard for a 100 Mbit/s fiber-optic token ring. The FDDI timed <b>token</b> <b>access</b> protocol provides dynamic adjustment {{of the load}} offered to the ring, with the goal of maintaining a specified token rotation time and of providing a guaranteed upper bound on time between successive arrivals of the token at a station. FDDI also provides automatic recovery when errors occur. The bound on time between successive token arrivals is guaranteed only if the token rotates quickly enough to satisfy timer requirements in each station when all ring resources are functioning properly. Otherwise, recovery would be initiated unnecessarily. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to prove that FDDI timing requirements are satisfied, i. e., the token rotates quickly enough to prevent initiation of recovery unless there is failure of a physical resource or unless the network management entity within a station initiates the recovery process...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} development of a new system whereby the Public Switch Telephone Network (PSTN), which is not secure, can perform like a private network. Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) forms a technical platform for other communication technologies, such as frame relay and Switched Megabit Data Service (SMDS). This is an original and innovative hardware and software design which can be embedded into the ISDN Customer Premises Equipment (CPE) to privatize the public ISDN without the need to upgrade the existing switching equipment. This research incorporates original design and development of the following hardware and software modules to provide real-time encryption and decryption of images and data in the ISDN medium: 1. ISDN Communications Module with customized Caller-ID access. 2. <b>Token</b> <b>Access</b> Control module for secure log-in. 3. A Hybrid Cryptographic Module, public key for key management and authentication, and private key for privacy.

To invite new users, smaller fractions of these tokens can be transferred. If the token is indivisible and scarce, it will limit the amount of users others are able to invite.

40|$|Problem statement: The {{communications}} domain has {{utilized the}} implementation of protocols for {{a wide spectrum of}} applications. This encompasses Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols. MAC protocols have been extensively researched from several angles. This encompasses the implementation in the area of Wave Division Multiplexing (WDM) networks and Mobile Adhoc Networks (MANET). The relevance of intelligence in sustaining the pre-requisites for dynamic reconfiguration has gained an integral attention in MANET. Approach: The implementation of Token Ring in MANET can be correlated to its complementary implementation in IP networks. In this paper, the limitation of Token Ring algorithm for IP networks in the context of intelligent processing has been researched extensively. An enhanced Token Ring protocol governed by intelligent processing has been implemented in this paper. The core of the new protocol is based on the circulation mechanism of the token. As opposed to the traditional circulatory mechanism, a software agent is designed to become an intelligent circulatory agent is this research. The developed software agent is utilized to implement prioritized <b>token</b> <b>access</b> subject to the traffic type. Each station is coupled with a software agent who cohesively collaborates to assign the token. Results: The proposed agent and the enhanced Token Ring implementation have been extensively verified through simulation experiments. A complete circulation of the ring is defined upon all nodes being visited at least once. Discrete-event simulation models were developed and deployed for the purpose of performance analysis. The results acquired validated the improved results of the new software agent based implementation. The performance metrics studied were average delay and average buffer utilization. Conclusion: The proposed algorithm has enabled to derive an ideal balance between the complexity of intelligent processing and the versatility of managing the token ring...|$|E
