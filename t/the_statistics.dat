40|$|Context. Commonly used {{methods of}} decomposing E- and B-modes in cosmic shear, namely the {{aperture}} mass dispersion and the E/B-mode shear correlation function, suffer from incomplete {{knowledge of the}} two-point correlation function (2 PCF) on very small and/or very large scales. <b>The</b> ring <b>statistics,</b> <b>the</b> most recently developed cosmic shear measure, improves on this issue {{and is able to}} decompose E- and B-modes using a 2 PCF measured on a finite interval. Aims. First, we improve on the ring statistics’ filter function over the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). Second, we examine the ability of <b>the</b> ring <b>statistics</b> to constrain cosmology and compare the results to cosmological constraints obtained with the aperture mass dispersion. Third, we use <b>the</b> ring <b>statistics</b> to measure a cosmic shear signal from CFHTLS (Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey) data. Methods. We consider a scale-dependent filter function for <b>the</b> ring <b>statistics,</b> which improves its S/N. To examine the information content of <b>the</b> ring <b>statistics,</b> we employed ray-tracing simulations and developed an expression of the ring statistics’ covariance in terms of a 2 PCF covariance. We performed a likelihood analysis with simulated data for <b>the</b> ring <b>statistics</b> in <b>the</b> Ω_(m-σ 8) parameter space and compared the information content of ring statistics and aperture mass dispersion. Regarding our third aim, we used the 2 PCF of the latest CFHTLS analysis to calculate <b>the</b> ring <b>statistics</b> and its error bars. Results. Although the scale-dependent filter function improves the S/N of <b>the</b> ring <b>statistics,</b> <b>the</b> S/N of the aperture mass dispersion is higher. In addition, we show that filter functions exist that decompose E- and B-modes using a finite range of 2 PCFs (EB-statistics) and have higher S/N than <b>the</b> ring <b>statistics.</b> However, we find that data points of the latter are significantly less correlated than data points of the aperture mass dispersion and the EB-statistics. As a consequence <b>the</b> ring <b>statistics</b> is an ideal tool for identifying remaining systematics accurately as a function of angular scale. We use <b>the</b> ring <b>statistics</b> to measure a E- and B-mode shear signal from CFHTLS data...|$|R
