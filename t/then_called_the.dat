5|$|Construction on the White House (<b>then</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> President's House) {{was begun}} in 1792. Washington laid the {{cornerstone}} for the United States Capitol (<b>then</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Congress House) on September 18, 1793. John Adams, Washington's successor, {{moved into the}} White House in November 1800; that same month, Congress held its first session in the Capitol. The following February, Congress approved the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801, which officially organized the District of Columbia, and, {{in accordance with the}} Constitution, named Congress as its exclusive governing authority.|$|E
5|$|The {{business}} school was founded thereafter in 1898 {{and the law}} school was founded in 1902. Harper died in 1906 {{and was replaced by}} a succession of three presidents whose tenures lasted until 1929. During this period, the Oriental Institute was founded to support and interpret archeological work in what was <b>then</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Near East.|$|E

5|$|Alvarez {{had access}} to the nuclear chemists at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and was able to work with Frank Asaro and Helen Michel, who used the {{technique}} of neutron activation analysis. In 1980, Alvarez, Alvarez, Asaro, and Michel published a seminal paper proposing an extraterrestrial cause for the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction (<b>then</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction). In the years following the publication of their article, the clay was also found to contain soot, glassy spherules, shocked quartz crystals, microscopic diamonds, and rare minerals formed only under conditions of great temperature and pressure.|$|E
5|$|During the Livonian War, Estonia {{became part}} of the Lutheran Swedish kingdom. The Catholic Dome Church became a church with a Lutheran {{congregation}} and was <b>then</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Castle Church. In 1625, the Swedish King Gustav II Adolf sold the town of Haapsalu, the castle and the nearby land property to Count Jacob De la Gardie, who planned to turn the dilapidated stronghold into a modern castle. Arent Passer, a well-known sculptor and master builder, was invited as a consultant.|$|E
5|$|Eddy copyrighted her book, <b>then</b> <b>called</b> <b>The</b> Science of Life, in July 1874. Three of her students, George Barry, Elizabeth Newhall and Daniel Spofford, paid a Boston printer, W. F. Brown and Company, $2,200 {{to produce}} the first edition. The printer began work in September 1874, but stopped {{whenever}} the advance payment ran out, so progress was slow. The book—Science and Health by Mary Baker Glover, with eight chapters and 456 pages—finally appeared on October 30, 1875, published {{in the name of}} the Christian Science Publishing Company.|$|E

5|$|In 1886 Bell {{became the}} 10th {{president}} of the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers. He was awarded the George Stephenson Medal from the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1890, and the Telford Medal (<b>then</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Telford Premium) from the same institution, both for papers that he presented there. In 1895 Bell was awarded the Albert Medal of the Royal Society of Arts, {{in recognition of the}} services he has rendered to Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, by his metallurgical researches and the resulting development of the iron and steel industries.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, Brittain {{accepted}} {{the position of}} president of the Georgia Institute of Technology, <b>then</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Georgia School of Technology, an office he would hold {{until his retirement in}} 1944. During his 22-year tenure at Georgia Tech, Brittain was credited with doubling student enrollment, establishing what is now the second largest aerospace engineering faculty in the United States, and playing an influential role in securing Georgia Tech's position as a leading technical institute and research university. After his retirement, Brittain wrote The Story of Georgia Tech (1948), a history of the Institute published shortly before his death in 1953.|$|E
5|$|She {{attended}} Oberlin College {{and graduated}} from Radcliffe College, <b>then</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Society for the Collegiate Instruction of Women, with a bachelor's degree in 1892. She studied a broad curriculum including classical Greek, fine arts, philosophy, analytic geometry, and calculus. It wasn't until her fourth year of college that Leavitt took a course in astronomy, in which she earned an Andash&. She then traveled in America and in Europe, during which time she lost her hearing.|$|E

5|$|The Parliament {{gained more}} powers from {{successive}} treaties, namely through {{the extension of}} the ordinary legislative procedure (<b>then</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> codecision procedure), and in 1999, the Parliament forced the resignation of the Santer Commission. The Parliament had refused to approve the Community budget over allegations of fraud and mis-management in the Commission. The two main parties took on a government-opposition dynamic for the first time during the crisis which ended in the Commission resigning en masse, the first of any forced resignation, {{in the face of an}} impending censure from the Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The botik (small boat) was constructed, {{either in}} England or by Danes in Russia using an English design, in the 1640s, and was <b>then</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> St. Nicholas. The boat {{originally}} belonged to Peter the Great's grandfather; an earlier theory {{held that the}} boat {{was a gift from}} Queen Elizabeth to Ivan the Terrible in the 1580s. It is the last remnant of the fleet of wooden boats maintained by Peter's father, Alexis; the rest rotted from neglect or were destroyed during the rebellion of Stenka Razin.|$|E
5|$|The {{bridge was}} the final link in what was <b>then</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Pacific Highway (later known as U.S. Route 99), which ran from Canada to Mexico. The bridge crosses the Lake Union section of the Lake Washington Ship Canal and, unlike earlier bridges across the canal, {{the height of the}} Aurora Bridge {{eliminated}} the need for a drawbridge. The Seattle City Council voted to build connecting portions of the highway through the Woodland Park Zoo, a decision which generated considerable controversy at the time.|$|E

5|$|A new {{application}} {{for the same}} route was made on 16 April 1907, this time from Solicitor H. M. Helliesen, Wholesaler A. Thune-Larsen, and Works Manager T. Poppe of Kristiania Sporveisselskab (KSS), the company which operated one the city tramways. This time the plans were slightly changed, with the route proposed built with a tramway {{rather than as a}} railway. In particular, the line was to connect to the Gamleby Line (<b>then</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Oslo Line) of KSS's network and run up Ekeberg to an intersection between Ekeberveien and Kirkeveien. The plans called for a regular street tram with regular city tram vehicles. At the time, the city limits of Oslo went at Sjømannskolen. The application for the part within Oslo was sent to the city, while for the section outside the city, the application was sent to the Ministry of Labour. Within Oslo, a new line would only have to be built from Oslo Hospital to Sjømannskolen, while from Oslo Hospital to the city center, the line would follow the Gamleby Line.|$|E
5|$|Also {{close to}} the 35thparallel was the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. Its opening in the early 1880s led to the {{founding}} of towns like Holbrook and Adamana. Visitors could stop at the Adamana train station, book a hotel room, and take a tour of what was <b>then</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Chalcedony Forest. Over the years, the line changed hands, becoming the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, and then the BNSF. More than 60 BNSF trains, mostly carrying freight, pass through the park every day. U.S. Route66, a former transcontinental auto highway developed in 1926 from part of the National Old Trails Road, ran parallel to the railroad tracks until it was decommissioned in 1985. The park has preserved within its boundaries a small grassy section of the road. Interstate40, which crosses the park, replaced the older highway.|$|E
5|$|Global News {{reporter}} Jennifer Tryon {{attempted to}} file a Freedom of Information request for documents on June 29, but was refused; an employee came out {{from the back of}} the offices, and turned the City Clerk's chair around, so that they couldn't respond. City officials <b>then</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> OPP. After the request, the city issued a two line statement that documents are now part of investigations. OPP noted that the documents are still available through Freedom of Information requests, and that the situation likely didn't warrant an emergency call to police. The reporter was provided a FOI application on police arrival, and told to ignore instructions from their superiors on calling police. Tryon, producer Kieron O'Dea and cameraman Trevor Owens would later receive a Canadian Screen Award nomination for Breaking National News Reportage at the 1st Canadian Screen Awards.|$|E
50|$|Marlowe <b>then</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> police, {{telling them}} that Mars {{is the one who}} killed Regan. In the process, he tells them that Vivian helped him with Eddie Mars, {{exempting}} her from criminal prosecution, and tells Vivian that her sister Carmen needs psychiatric care.|$|R
50|$|Procedure calls {{inside a}} shared library are {{typically}} made through small procedure linkage table stubs, which <b>then</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> definitive function. This notably allows a shared library to inherit certain function calls from previously loaded libraries {{rather than using}} its own versions.|$|R
50|$|Some {{implementations}} of trampolines cause {{a loss of}} No Execute Stacks (NX Stack). In particular, GCC's nested function {{builds a}} trampoline on the stack at runtime, and <b>then</b> <b>calls</b> <b>the</b> nested function through the data on stack. The trampoline requires the stack to be executable.|$|R
5|$|In 1967, the United States Embassy in London chose Thatcher to {{take part}} in the International Visitor Leadership Program (<b>then</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Foreign Leader Program), a {{professional}} exchange programme that gave her the opportunity to spend about six weeks visiting various US cities and political figures as well as institutions such as the International Monetary Fund. Although she was not yet a Cabinet or Shadow Cabinet member, the embassy reportedly described her to the State Department as a possible future Prime Minister. The description helped Thatcher meet with many prominent people during a busy itinerary focused on economic issues, including Paul Samuelson, Walt Rostow, Pierre-Paul Schweitzer and Nelson Rockefeller. In 1967, Heath appointed Thatcher to the Shadow Cabinet as Fuel and Power spokesman. Prior to the 1970 general election, she was promoted to Shadow Transport spokesman and later to Education.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the wild population at Chittenango Falls State Park, efforts to establish captive populations began in 1990. A captive Novisuccinea chittenangoensis colony was being maintained at the Rosamond Gifford Zoo in Syracuse, New York, however, the last remaining snails died in November 2002. Other unsuccessful breeding programs were tried in the 1990s: at ESF at Syracuse; at the Wildlife Conservation Park/Bronx Zoo; an early effort at the Rosamond Gifford Zoo (<b>then</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Burnet Park Zoo); at the Seneca Park Zoo (Rochester, New York); and at the Buffalo Zoo. Further experiments are {{necessary in order to}} determine what the proper conditions are for maintaining a healthy captive population of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis.|$|E

After {{climbing}} the chart {{in that country}} for several weeks, it reached its peak position at number 18 on March 26; overall, it spent nine consecutive weeks {{in the ranks of}} the Billboard Hot 100. It also entered the Hot R/Hip-Hop Songs chart (<b>then</b> <b>called</b> <b>the</b> Black Singles chart) in the United States, where it peaked at number 5 and became the group's fifth consecutive top ten entry. On Canada's official singles chart, compiled by RPM, the single debuted at number 66 for the week ending March 21, 1966. The following week on March 28, the single peaked at number 52.|$|E
