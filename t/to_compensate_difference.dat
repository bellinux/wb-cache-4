40|$|Introduction. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{fabricate}} a complete upper acrylic denture and a partial lower acrylic denture and provide occlusal rehabilitation with added benefit of correcting the position of altered condyle in a dysfunctional stomatognathic system. Case Report. Procedures for fabrication of acrylic dentures are thoroughly described. Specific scheme of occlusion was applied in the treatment of this patent. Occlusal contacts were established as tripod minor contacts on the side where the part of upper edentulous ridge was intensively reduced (on the right side) with divergent tracing of the condyle due to dysfunction. Tripod contacts were established on occlusal surfaces of opposing teeth as well. Contacts on the left side were formed as circumferential surfaces. Specially distributed occlusal contacts favorably influenced reduction of occlusal stresses on supporting tissues in the mouth of the patient. Tooth contacts arranged in such particular order were established to redistribute loading as well as to prevent excessive propulsion and latero-protrusive movements of the lower jaw. Conclusion. Occlusal pattern of tripod and single-point contacts was used <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> <b>differences</b> in condylar movements of this patient with stomatognathic dysfunction, intending to diminish loads on reduced surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Fermi-surface {{deformations}} in strongly correlated metals, {{in comparison}} to results from band-structure calculations, are investigated. We show that correlation-induced interband charge transfers in multi-orbital systems may give rise to substantial modifications of the actual Fermi surface. Depending in particular on the relative strength of the crystal-field splitting and of the Hund’s exchange coupling, correlations may either reinforce orbital polarization or tend <b>to</b> <b>compensate</b> <b>differences</b> in orbital occupancies, as demonstrated by investigating a 2 -band Hubbard model {{in the framework of}} dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). The physical implications of such interorbital charge transfers are then explored in two case studies: BaVS 3 and NaxCoO 2. By means of the DMFT in combination with the local density approximation (LDA) to density functional theory (DFT), new insights in the underlying mechanism of the metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) of BaVS 3 are obtained. A strong charge redistribution {{in comparison to}} LDA calculations, i. e., a depletion of the broader A 1 g band in favor of the narrower Eg bands just above the MIT is found. In addition, the intriguing problem of determining the Fermi surface in the strongly correlated cobaltate system NaxCoO 2 is discussed...|$|R
