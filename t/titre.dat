5|$|Investigation of shipwrecks in {{vicinity}} of Pedra Branca. Singapore had duties to investigate hazards to navigational safety and to publish information about such hazards in its capacity as a lighthouse operator, {{and under the}} United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the Convention on the Safety of Life at Sea. Therefore, by investigating and reporting on shipwrecks and maritime hazards within Pedra Branca's territorial waters Singapore had acted in accordance with best practice and not à <b>titre</b> de souverain. The circumstances of the particular investigations also meant that Singapore's ability to carry them out was not based on its sovereignty over the island.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{regarded}} as conduct à <b>titre</b> de souverain Singapore's investigation of six shipwrecks {{in the vicinity}} of Pedra Branca between 1920 and 1993, its exclusive control over visits to the island, the installation of the military rebroadcast station on the island in 1977, and the proposed reclamation of land around it. Malaysia was correct in asserting that the flying of an ensign was not normally a manifestation of sovereignty, and that the difference in size between Pulau Pisang and Pedra Branca had to be recognised. Nonetheless, some weight could be given to the fact that Malaysia had not requested for the Singapore ensign flying at Horsburgh Lighthouse to be taken down. The fact that Malaysia had referred to the lighthouse as a Singapore station in the 1959 and 1966 meteorological reports and had omitted it from the 1967 Malaysian report favoured Singapore's case.|$|E

It held that although Pedra Branca {{had originally been}} under the sovereignty of Johor, the conduct of Singapore and its predecessors à <b>titre</b> de souverain (with {{the title of a}} sovereign) and the failure of Malaysia and its predecessors to respond to such conduct showed that by 1980, when the dispute between the parties arose, sovereignty over the island had passed to Singapore. The relevant conduct on the part of Singapore and its predecessors included investigating marine accidents {{in the vicinity of the}} island, planning land reclamation works, installing naval communications equipment, and requiring Malaysian officials wishing to visit the island to obtain permits. In contrast, Johor and its successors had taken no action with respect to the island from June 1850 for a century or more. In 1953 the Acting Secretary of the State of Johor had stated that Johor did not claim ownership of Pedra Branca. All visits made to the island had been with Singapore's express permission, and maps published by Malaysia in the 1960s and 1970s indicated that it recognised Singapore's sovereignty over Pedra Branca.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY. Sequential serum samples {{obtained}} from 50 rheumatic fever subjects and from control individuals matched for time, age and geographical location were tested for antibodies against the M-asso-ciated protein antigens, MAP I and MAP 11.

Anti-MAP I <b>titres</b> in excess of 40 were significantly more common in rheumatic fever subjects than in matched controls (p<O.

In the present prospective study correlations were sought between serum <b>titres</b> of IgG C 1 qAb and clinical as well as laboratory parameters of disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). METHODS [...] <b>Titres</b> of IgG C 1 qAb in the serum of 68 SLE patients were measured serially during a three year period. At the same time clinical and laboratory parameters of disease activity were assessed. RESULTS [...] Increased <b>titres</b> of IgG C 1 qAb were found in the serum of 56 % of SLE patients during the study. Significant correlations were found between increased <b>titres</b> of IgG C 1 qAb and renal involvement. Clinical signs of renal involvement were found to be associated with significant increases of serum <b>titres</b> of IgG C 1 qAb in the six months preceding this appearance. Fifty per cent of the increases in serum <b>titres</b> of IgG C 1 qAb were followed by the development of renal involvement. Elevated serum <b>titres</b> of IgG C 1 qAb were especially related to proliferative forms of glomerulonephritis. Furthermore, significant correlations were found between serum <b>titres</b> of IgG C 1 qAb and serum levels of immune complexes, levels of complement components, and <b>titres</b> of antibodies to DNA.

25|$|The ANA test detects the autoantibodies {{present in}} an individual's blood serum. The common tests used for {{detecting}} and quantifying ANAs are indirect immunofluorescence and {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA). In immunofluorescence, the level of autoantibodies is reported as a <b>titre.</b> This is the highest dilution of the serum at which autoantibodies are still detectable.

Positive titres of less than 1:160 are present in up to 20% of the healthy population, especially the elderly.

Autoantibody screening is useful in the diagnosis of autoimmune disorders and monitoring levels helps to predict the progression of disease. A positive ANA test is seldom useful if other clinical or laboratory data supporting a diagnosis are not present.|$|E

25|$|Indirect {{immunofluorescence}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonly used tests for ANAs. Typically, HEp-2 cells are used as a substrate to detect the antibodies in human serum. Microscope slides are coated with HEp-2 cells and the serum is incubated with the cells. If antibodies are present then they will bind to the antigens on the cells; in the case of ANAs, the antibodies will bind to the nucleus. These can be visualised by adding a fluorescent tagged (usually FITC or rhodopsin B) anti-human antibody that binds to the antibodies. The molecule will fluoresce when a specific wavelength of light shines on it, which can be seen under the microscope. Depending on the antibody present in the human serum and the localisation of the antigen in the cell, distinct patterns of fluorescence will be seen on the HEp-2 cells. Levels of antibodies are analysed by performing dilutions on blood serum. An ANA test is considered positive if fluorescence is seen at a <b>titre</b> of 1:40/1:80. Higher titres are more clinically significant as low positives (≤1:160) are found in up to 20% of healthy individuals, especially the elderly.
