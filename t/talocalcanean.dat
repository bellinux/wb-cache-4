5000|$|At the 2000 Sparkassen Cup, Lindemann {{injured his}} knee {{when he fell}} on a triple Axel in the short program. He tore a {{ligament}} {{in his right knee}} and pulled a muscle in his <b>talocalcanean</b> joint.|$|E
40|$|The upper <b>talocalcanean</b> join (articulatio talocruralis) 1 is the join of the shin bone (tibia) and {{the ankle}} bone (talus). The tibia and the ankle bone are in contact at the facies articularis {{inferior}} tibiae 2 and the facies articularis superior trochleae tali 3. In {{order to build}} protheses that simulate {{the motion of the}} UTJ we study the geometry of the two surfaces FAIT and FAST, respectively. We are looking for kinematic surfaces that approximate FAIT and FASTT best. For that we use line geometric methods to fit best approximating linear line complexes and compute the axis of the thus determined helical motion. Further we registrate FAIT and FASTT in order to find configurations such that they are in contact. Measuring deviations of the registered surfaces helps to decide if FAIT and FASTT can be in line contact. The detection of possible contact curves will be a topic of future research...|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} work {{investigated the}} influence of the repetitive lumbosacral magnetic stimulation on the spastic pes equinus. The treating method was utilized within a group of 56 patients with a spasticity of different genesis, occurrence, duration and character. The stimulation during the experimental series consists of 10 series Ã  10 seconds with a frequency of 20 Hz (2000 pulses per treated body side) and a 1, 2 fold intensity of the motoric threshold. The evaluation comprised the intensity of the spasticity, the functionality of the affected extremity, a self-evaluation of each proband and his parents, as well as electro-physiological parameters. During the whole clinical trial the probands did not sense any pain. As a major result of this investigation, a 20 Hz repetitive lumobosacral magnetic stimulation with a 1, 2 fold motoric threshold could reduce the tonus of the spastic pes equinus much beyond the moment of stimulation, independently from the genesis, the occurrence, the duration or the character of the spasticity. The study showed on the one hand a positive effect on the muscle resistance against passive distension {{and on the other hand}} an extended degree of motion. Patients who had a voluntary motor function in the affected <b>talocalcanean</b> joint right before the investigation had a better motor function after the application of the stimulus. It can be concluded that the repetitive peripheral magnetic stimulation is besides the transcranial stimulation the beginning of a new, for now limited, diagnostic and therapeutic field of application, with the potential of rapid further development. The presented results accent the potential of the lumbosacral magnetic stimulation as a therapeutic option in the treatment of the spasticity of the lower extremity. The analgesia, only a few knock-out criteria, the risks and the small expenditure of time makes this therapy interesting for a large group of patients. The collected data show a clinical efficiency up to one week, which makes a weekly treatment reasonable. As a therapeutic method it still has to be rated as a non evidence based experimental technique. Therefore further clinical trials are necessary to establish the repetitive magnetic stimulation as a therapy in the clinical neurology...|$|E
