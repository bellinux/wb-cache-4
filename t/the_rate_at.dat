5|$|Two {{groups of}} {{relatively}} large insects, the Ephemeroptera (mayflies) and the Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) have the flight muscles attached directly to their wings; the wings can beat no faster than <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> <b>at</b> which nerves can send impulses {{to command the}} muscles to beat. All other living winged insects fly using a different mechanism, involving indirect flight muscles which cause the thorax to vibrate; the wings can beat faster than <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> <b>at</b> which the muscles receive nerve impulses. This mechanism evolved once, and is the defining feature (synapomorphy) for the infraclass Neoptera.|$|E

40|$|In raw sludges and in mesophilically and thermophilically digested {{anaerobic}} sludges, large {{variations in}} numbers of viruses occurred over narrow ranges of numbers of fecal coliforms, total coliforms, and fecal streptococci, demonstrating that the bacteria were poor quantitative reflectors {{of the numbers}} of the viruses detected.

5|$|Different {{estimates}} exist of {{the amounts}} of indium contained within the ores of other metals.
