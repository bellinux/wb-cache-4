5|$|For complex numbers w and z with , <b>the</b> <b>notation</b> w'z is {{ambiguous}} {{in the same}} sense that log w is.|$|E
5|$|This {{choice of}} basis, and <b>the</b> <b>notation,</b> is {{standard}} in the mathematical literature.|$|E
5|$|The latter {{notation}} generalizes {{to yield}} <b>the</b> <b>notation</b> f for the nth derivative of f – this notation is most useful when {{we wish to}} talk about the derivative as being a function itself, as in this case the Leibniz notation can become cumbersome.|$|E
40|$|This report compares two {{notation}} {{systems for}} requirements modeling, <b>the</b> <b>notations</b> used in <b>the</b> Shlaer-Mellor method for object-oriented analysis and <b>the</b> <b>notations</b> uses in TCM (Toolkit for Conceptual Modeling). <b>The</b> <b>notations</b> used in <b>the</b> Shlaer-Mellor method are semi-formal, i. e. they consist of diagrams annotated by natural language text. <b>The</b> <b>notations</b> used in TCM are semi-formal, as in <b>the</b> Shlaer-Mellor <b>notation,</b> {{but there is}} also a formal part. The formal part of a TCM specification is written down in LCM (Language for Conceptual Modeling), a language based on order-sorted dynamic logic. The formal and semi-formal parts of a TCM specification supplement each other and each can be used without using the other. Because the semi-formal and formal notations in TCM are precisely related, <b>the</b> semi-formal <b>notations</b> have unambiguous definitions, and <b>the</b> formal <b>notations</b> have simple and clear diagram representations. The report analyzes <b>the</b> <b>notations</b> used for information model, state model, process model and communication model used in the Shlaer-Mellor method and shows how these relate to <b>the</b> <b>notations</b> used for <b>the</b> class model, life cycle model and communication model in TCM. It is shown that <b>the</b> <b>notations</b> of <b>the</b> Shlaer-Mellor method contain ambiguities and redundancies, that are resolved when we transform these notations into TCM notations. However, some of these redundancies provide useful information and TCM is extended with a simplified form of some of <b>the</b> Shlaer-Mellor <b>notations.</b> (orig.)

5|$|The older {{writing was}} first noticed by Pierre Allix, a Protestant pastor. Jean Boivin, {{supervisor}} of the Royal Library, made the first extracts of various readings of the codex (under <b>the</b> <b>notation</b> of Paris 9) to Ludolph Küster, who published Mill's New Testament in 1710. In 1834–1835 potassium ferricyanide was used to bring out faded or eradicated ink, which {{had the effect of}} defacing the vellum from green and blue to black and brown.|$|E
5|$|The court {{rejected}} the defendant's other arguments: (1) {{that women were}} improperly excluded from the grand jury under Illinois law (as incorporated by federal jury selection law at the time); (2) that the indictment was not returned in open court because <b>the</b> <b>notation</b> indicating that the indictment was returned in open court was added after the fact; (3) that the indictment was insufficiently definite; (4) that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the conviction; (5) that the admission of certain evidence was prejudicial; and (6) that the trial judge's own questioning of certain witnesses and limitations on cross-examination were prejudicial.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, the Bolshoi Ballet {{utilized}} <b>the</b> <b>notation</b> {{to stage}} Petipa's Grand Pas classique, Pas de trois and Mazurka des enfants from Paquita. <b>The</b> <b>notation,</b> however, was merely {{used as a}} starting point for a completely new staging.|$|E
5000|$|Reinforcement {{is usually}} {{tabulated}} in a [...] "reinforcement schedule" [...] on construction drawings.

25|$|Generally, <b>the</b> multiplicative <b>notation</b> is <b>the</b> usual <b>notation</b> for groups, while <b>the</b> {{additive}} <b>notation</b> is <b>the</b> usual <b>notation</b> for modules and rings. <b>The</b> additive <b>notation</b> {{may also}} be used to emphasize that a particular group is abelian, whenever both abelian and non-abelian groups are considered, some notable exceptions being near-rings and partially ordered groups, where an operation is written additively even when non-abelian.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>notation</b> C/E bass {{indicates}} a C major chord, {{but with an}} E in the bass. Likewise <b>the</b> <b>notation</b> C/G bass indicates that a C major chord is played with a G in the bass. In a jazz quartet with a bass player, the bass player will play the indicated bass note.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{shows how}} to define an {{operational}} semantics of those graphical notations {{that are used}} during requirements analysis and design. An abstract syntax using syntax graphs is given to describe <b>the</b> <b>notations</b> uniformly, followed by the formal description of a possible semantics by semantic bases. Finally, a calculus of operations is proposed to integrate the definition of different notations. By describing these semi-formal notations in a formal manner <b>the</b> <b>notations</b> become more precise. Furthermore it is made possible to write tools to interpret <b>the</b> <b>notations</b> operationally...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} keep the simpleness of <b>the</b> <b>notations,</b> here and here after we usually omit “dP-a.s.” and make random {{processes}} β (ω,t) and μ (ω,t) abbreviated as β (t) and μ (t) or β _t and μ _t. <b>The</b> <b>notations</b> of <b>the</b> other processes are similar.|$|R

25|$|In 1963, Herbert Hellerman, {{working at}} the IBM Systems Research Institute, {{implemented}} a part of <b>the</b> <b>notation</b> on an IBM 1620 computer, and it was used by students in a special high school course on calculating transcendental functions by series summation.

25|$|When <b>the</b> <b>notation</b> lognbsp&z appears {{without any}} {{particular}} logarithm having been specified, {{it is generally}} best {{to assume that the}} principal value is intended.

The capitalization in <b>the</b> <b>notation</b> Log is used by some authors to distinguish the principal value from other logarithms of z.|$|E
