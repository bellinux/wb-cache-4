5|$|<b>The</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>family</b> {{structure}} in the United States is considered a family support system involving two married individuals providing care and stability for their biological offspring. However, this two-parent, nuclear family has become less prevalent, and alternative family forms have become more common. The family is created at birth and establishes ties across generations. Those generations, the extended family of aunts, uncles, grandparents, and cousins, can hold significant emotional and economic roles for the nuclear family.|$|E
5|$|Gia Long promulgated a {{new legal}} code {{to replace the}} system that had existed since the Hong Duc era of Lê Thánh Tông in the 15th century. Work started in 1811 under a group of {{scholars}} led by Nguyễn Văn Thành, and in 1815, the Bộ luật Gia Long (Gia Long Code) was issued. Although Gia Long claimed that his new system {{was a mixture of}} the Le code and Qing Dynasty system of China, most scholars regard it as being a near complete copy of the Qing code. The code was later translated into French by Paul-Louis-Félix Philastre. It focused on strengthening the power and authority of the emperor, his mandarins, and <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>family</b> unit. In cases of serious crimes, particularly those against the state, collective punishment was meted out to the family of the convict, including the death penalty.|$|E

Two weeks after this protest, coinciding with Gay Pride Day, FELGT (Federación Estatal de Lesbianas, Gays, Transexuales y Bisexuales — the Spanish Lesbian, Gay, and Transgender Organization) estimated two million people marched in favour of the new law; police sources counted 97,000. Both marches took place in Madrid, at the time governed by the conservative People's Party.|$|E

5|$|Sexual Politics {{originated}} as Millett's PhD dissertation and {{was published}} in 1970, {{the same year that}} she was awarded her doctorate from Columbia University. The bestselling book, a critique of patriarchy in Western society and literature, addressed the sexism and heterosexism of the modern novelists D. H. Lawrence, Henry Miller, and Norman Mailer and contrasted their perspectives with the dissenting viewpoint of the homosexual author Jean Genet. Millett questioned the origins of patriarchy, argued that sex-based oppression was both political and cultural, and posited that undoing <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>family</b> was the key to true sexual revolution. In its first year on the market, the book sold 80,000 copies and went through seven printings and is considered to be the movement's manifesto.|$|E

25|$|Historians {{have paid}} special {{attention}} to the efforts by Nazi Germany to reverse the gains women made before 1933, especially in the relatively liberal Weimar Republic. It appears {{the role of women in}} Nazi Germany changed according to circumstances.

25|$|The strong mother/weak or distant father {{parenting}} style {{typically associated with}} early psychoanalytic attempts to explain homosexuality was also used to further discredit Zinzendorf.

25|$|Inequality {{may exist}} {{between members of}} {{different}} generations within a family. Assimilation into American society may create changes in <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>family</b> structure, particularly among immigrants who come from cultures in which age is a strong determinant of status and power.

The high importance placed on self-determination in American culture may go against the traditional values of cultures in which children are expected to obey and respect the wishes of their parents in all facets of their lives. The migration process is often stressful and can lead to conflicts between family members, particularly those of different generations.|$|E
25|$|More {{women are}} living in poverty due to changes in <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>family</b> structure. The {{increase}} in divorce rates and single parenthood are two major contributing factors {{to change in the}} family structure. Female-headed families have the poorest economic outcomes, with economic well-being dependent on the mother’s marital status and race/ethnicity. White women generally have access to other income, through marriage or relationships with the highest income earners: white men. Whereas black women, in comparison to white women, are less likely to have white men as partners, and tend to have partners who earn less than white males, even when equally employed. The absence of second income-earning adults is what, in some cases,impedes the well-being of minority women and children.|$|E
25|$|LGBT {{movements}} are opposed {{by a variety}} of individuals and organizations. Some social conservatives believe that all sexual relationships with people other than an opposite-sex spouse undermine <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>family</b> and that children should be reared in homes with both a father and a mother. Some opponents of gay rights say that such rights may conflict with individuals' freedom of speech, religious freedoms in the workplace, the ability to run churches, charitable organizations and other religious organizations in accordance with one's religious views, and that the acceptance of homosexual relationships by religious organizations might be forced through threatening to remove the tax-exempt status of churches whose views do not align with those of the government. Some critics charge that political correctness has led to the association of sex between males and HIV being downplayed.|$|E

25|$|When men {{left their}} factory jobs to fight overseas, women {{stepped up to}} fill their {{positions}} in mass. These jobs became essential during the war when munitions supplies became vital to the war effort. Women excelled in these historically male-dominated roles. Some conservative protesters, rallied against women leaving the home as they argued this would hurt <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>family</b> ideals. This was especially true in Quebec, where the strong-arm of the Catholic Church kept many women from working outside the home. The government supported this new essential workforce by creating the first government run daycares. Though women shined in these positions and were even recruited in industrial communities, the jobs remained extremely gendered and women were expected to leave the factories when veterans returned home. Women’s work in factory during the second war {{is the most important}} role played by women on the home front.|$|E
25|$|Women's {{suffrage}} in Canada {{took off}} during the First World War. As many men were overseas in the trenches, women entered the workforces and gained new responsibilities on the home front. As well, wealthy highly educated and Canadian-born white women began to question why poor, illiterate immigrant men could vote when they could not. The suffrage movement met opposition by men and the Catholic Church (Quebec), who believed that women were ill-suited for politics and that women leaving the home would break up <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>family.</b> This opposition was most prominent in Quebec, where the Catholic Church had a stronghold on society. The church vigorously opposed women’s right to vote as they believed that women leaving the home would lead to poorly raised children. Women in Quebec were not granted {{the right to vote}} provincially until 1940, 15 years after the second-last province to grant women voting rights. The right to vote in provincial elections was granted between 1916 and 1940 (see below for statistics).|$|E

Neither McGinn nor Farrell were members of <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>family</b> dynasties at Celtic: Farrell was a partner in the Shaughnessy law firm that had long standing connections with Celtic, and was invited to become a director at the club in 1964; McGinn was responsible for the setting up of the club newspaper The Celtic View in the 1960s and later became the club's commercial manager. He was given a seat on the board and became Chairman in 1986. In May 1990 former Lord Provost of Glasgow, Michael Kelly, and property developer Brian Dempsey were invited to join the Celtic board. Dempsey did not last long however, a dispute about a proposed relocation from Parkhead to Robroyston resulted in him being voted off the board five months later.|$|E

After Hitler came to power in 1933, the activist women were replaced by bureaucratic women who emphasized feminine virtues, marriage, and childbirth. As Germany prepared for war, large numbers were incorporated into the public sector and with the need for full mobilization of factories by 1943, all women were required to register with the employment office. Women's wages remained unequal and women were denied positions of leadership or control.|$|E

500|$|Pre-industrialisation, {{the family}} worked {{together}} as a unit and was self-sufficient. When affection-based marriages emerged in the 1830s, parents began devoting more attention to children and family relationships became more open. Beginning with the Industrial Revolution, large-scale production replaced home manufacturing; this shift, coupled with prevailing norms governing sex or gender roles, dictated that the father become the breadwinner and the mother the caregiver. [...] Beginning during World War II, many women entered the workforce out of necessity; women resumed the caregiver position after the war, but their new-found sense of independence changed <b>the</b> <b>traditional</b> <b>family</b> structure together with cultural shifts leading to the feminist movement and advances in birth control.

Noteworthy results included: (1) monophyly of <b>the</b> tyrant-flycatchers (<b>traditional</b> <b>family</b> Tyrannidae), but only if the tityrines (see below) are excluded; (2) monophyly of the pipromorphine flycatchers (Pipromorphinae of Sibley and Ahlquist, 1990) as one of two primary divisions of a monophyletic restricted Tyrannidae; (3) monophyly of the tityrines, consisting of the genus Tityra plus all sampled species of the Schiffornis group (Prum and Lanyon, 1989), as sister group to <b>the</b> manakins (<b>traditional</b> <b>family</b> Pipridae); (4) paraphyly of <b>the</b> ovenbirds (<b>traditional</b> <b>family</b> Furnariidae), if woodcreepers (<b>traditional</b> <b>family</b> Dendrocolaptidae) are excluded; and (5) polyphyly of <b>the</b> antbirds (<b>traditional</b> <b>family</b> Formi-cariidae) and paraphyly of the ground antbirds (Formicariidae sensu stricto).
