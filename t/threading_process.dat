50|$|The {{black and}} white cotton warp threads first need to be wound onto the loom. This is done in 64m lengths, and the threads are wound onto the back beam of the loom. The warp has 60 threads per inch and is {{approximately}} 20 inches wide, each thread needs to be threaded through a heddle {{in the middle of}} the loom, and then through the reed at the front of the loom. This <b>threading</b> <b>process</b> is done by hand using a threading hook. Once the machine is threaded up, the warp threads are secured at the front of the loom onto the front beam. The loom then needs to be calibrated to advance the warp threads at the correct speed to weave 84 threads per inch.|$|E

40|$|The "Möbius strip approach" for the {{synthesis}} of catenanes requires that a ladder shaped molecule (doubly functionalized at both ends) twists twice prior to bimacrocyclization. A successful application of this strategy was claimed in the 1960 's. However, the catenanes {{were believed to be}} formed via a Möbius strip mechanism since, at that time, a metal coordinated all carbon cyclobutane was assumed to be an intermediate in the olefin metathesis. Although the incompatibility of the Möbius strip mechanism and the (later proposed) actual metathesis mechanism has been pointed out, the original claim keeps being cited as a successful one even in the recent literature.

40|$|Recently, translocations of {{polyelectrolyte}} molecules through {{membrane channel}} protein pores or solid-state nanopores have been actively studied. Although the polymer translocation researches emerged mainly due to technological demands {{in terms of}} genome sequencing, the detailed physics of the single molecule transport through a narrow channel remains fully understood. To obtain further understanding of common features of the translocation process, this thesis focuses {{on the effects of}} salt concentration, pore-polymer electrostatic interactions, and externally applied electric field on the voltage-driven polymer translocations. The study is carried out by performing a series of systematically designed experiments using alpha-hemolysin (αHL) protein pore to investigate the salt concentration effects on the frequency of polymer capture by the pore and those on the subsequent polymer translocation process under various externally applied electric fields and pH. First, we demonstrate that the polymer-pore electrostatic interactions are important in dictating the rate of polymer capture by the αHL pore, controlled by the salt concentration in the donor (cis) compartment through charge screening effects. Upon the presence of a salt concentration asymmetry between the donor and the recipient (trans) compartments, the polymer capture rate is observed to be governed by coupling between the polymer-pore electrostatic interactions and additional enhancement in the electric field arising from the salt concentration asymmetry. Next, we study salt concentration effects on dynamics of polymer <b>threading</b> <b>process,</b> by measuring durations of successful translocations in various salt concentrations in cis and trans under different pH. We find that salt concentrations in cis and trans influence the polymer <b>threading</b> <b>process</b> differently, depending on pH. A theoretical model is employed to demonstrate that the charge density of the polymer chain inside the pore is a critical factor in controlling the translocation process upon varying the salt concentrations. Lastly, a new methodology to evaluate molecular weight distributions of polyelectrolyte solutions is proposed using the polymer translocation technique is proposed. The experimental results demonstrate that the translocation technique can be a competitive method for estimating the broad molecular weight distributions of polyelectrolytes in comparison with conventional mass spectroscopy techniques...|$|E
