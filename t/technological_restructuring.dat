Joel Mokyr [...] puts a timeframe of 1870-1914 on this [...] "Second Industrial Revolution", the concept introduced by Patrick Geddes in his work Cities in Evolution.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an international}} trade model where firms in a duopoly for strategic reasons may diversify their technologies. Both firms {{are located in}} the home country, but export to a foreign country. The firms are ex ante identical, but choose between different technologies based on a trade-off between marginal costs and fixed costs. For some configurations of variable and fixed production costs and trade costs a mixed technology appears, i. e. one of the firms chooses a technology with low variable costs while the other goes for a technology with low fixed costs, and in such cases both firm size and export orientation differ. Market integration, i. e. a decrease of variable trade costs, may induce a <b>technological</b> <b>restructuring</b> and/or a change of the market structure in the foreign market with implications for welfare in both countries.

40|$|The {{controversy}} between optimists and pessimists {{that followed}} and keeps dividing the economists {{is the result}} of the absence in the dominating economic theory of an analytical framework able to deal properly with out-of-equilibrium processes as is the one through which a <b>technological</b> <b>restructuring</b> of production takes place. This theory looks in fact at capital as a stock of physical goods into which free capital has been already embodied, and which is divided into fixed capital goods (structures and machinery) and working capital (which includes wage goods). The Neo-Austrian representation of the process of production introduced by Hicks puts into the shade the argument of fixed vs. circulating capital that has characterized the controversy, to shift the focus on the real issue at stake in the <b>technological</b> <b>restructuring</b> process, that is, ‘that investment at cost is not the same as investment of output capacity’. It allows re-establishing the classic analysis of the wage fund as the economic beginning of a production process. Focusing on the coordination problems involved in phase of restructuring, the paper confirms the Ricardo’s intuition as well as the analytical advance by Hicks, and shows that the so called technological unemployment is not a temporary mechanical problem due to the characteristics of technology but a more general problem due to market behaviours and policies...|$|E

40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{presents a}} study of the behavior of unemployment, {{within the context of the}} industrial <b>technological</b> <b>restructure,</b> which marked the 1990 s in three sectors of the Brazilian Economy: food industry, civil construction and steel industry. It assumes as hypothesis that the restructure of the productive system aggravated the phenomenon of unemployment in all sectors of the Brazilian economy, as it culminated in the aggravation of the structural unemployment in the three sectors that were studied, besides highlighting the heterogeneous aspect in the world within this period. The dissertation follows the following logical explanation: contextualization of the contemporary society after the restructure of the productive system, based on the studies of David Harvey, the behavior of unemployment in Brazil and in the world, after globalization, as well as the effects of the change in the management system, based on Márcio Pochmann; the explanation of the three theories concerning unemployment, based on Enric Sanchis; the qualitative data search and its analysis, based on the researches that were done by DIEESE and IBGE; among others sources that give support to the object of study. A dissertação apresenta um estudo do comportamento do desemprego, no contexto da reestruturação tecnológica industrial, que marcou a década de 1990 em três setores da economia brasileira: supermercadista, construção civil e indústria siderúrgica.

A number of factors underpin a society's ability to foster continuous technological change, {{one of which is}} necessarily the conditions for appropriability. These have become increasingly important since the location of technological change remains largely in the hands of organised research centres housed in large corporations. This paper examines a selection of the issues that interface between innovation and appropriability in the case of plant breeding.

40|$|Abstract. We {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} whether gradual privatization {{with a soft}} credit constraint to enterprises with state ownership (ESOs) implies slow restructuring. The transition economics literature does not study restructuring and financial constraints to investment jointly. We provide such an analysis using a panel of Latvian firms in the years 1993 - 1997. We find that firms have been downsizing their inputs while their productivity has not been improving. ESOs started up with a below-average productivity that deteriorated over time. The availability of external and internal finance did not increase investment to physical capital in the whole sample. Nevertheless, ESOs had better access to credit than did privatized firms. We conclude that there was virtually no <b>technological</b> <b>restructuring</b> and external finance for investment was scarce.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the <b>restructuring</b> of <b>technological</b> capabilities following M&A-based {{growth in}} large industrial firms with a substantial technological knowledge base. In particular, {{we focus on}} the <b>restructuring</b> of those <b>technological</b> capabilities that are of a general purpose kind (namely ICT) or related to the core capabilities of a firm. We develop and test a conceptual framework grounded on a co-evolutionary view, that relates the motivations and environment for corporate expansion to the firm-specific pattern of restructuring in the composition of corporate technological capabilities. We find that distinct patterns of <b>technological</b> capability <b>restructuring</b> are associated with each combination of the motivations and environment for firm growth. In particular, inter-industry contexts reduce technological relatedness in market motivated expansions, while relatedness has also declined in more recent technology-motivated growth in general. The acquisition of ICT is common as well to both technology-motivated inter-industry deals and more recent market-motivated deals. However, we speculate that any similarities in the outcomes of these alternative motives for firm growth arise for quite different purposes. ...|$|R

Moreover, the size of the efficient structures is determined exclusively by their information workload and the current state of information-processing technology. <b>Technological</b> changes, organizational <b>restructuring,</b> hierarchy, decision-making, information-processing...|$|R

The implications of this examination have demonstrated that this shift has not been the result of mechanical technologies alone, but the science-based management philosophies and communicative nature of technologies as well. This project has verified that more importantly than the advancing technological shift itself the danger for professional nursing has been in what these systems are actively replacing. Namely, prescriptive technologies work to establish a managerial or 'expert' presence and authority within the practice of nursing serving to change professional understandings for nurses as well as to decrease value in the judgement and holistic care skills of registered nurses...|$|E
