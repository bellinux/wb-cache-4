5|$|Lithic peaks: a {{far smaller}} {{proportion}} of lithics (3,000 vs. 6,000 grains per gram) is observed in H3 and H6, which means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> the continents in providing sediments to the oceans was relatively lower.|$|E
5|$|Adler {{wrote in}} his memoir that the passion of his future wife Sonya Oberlander (and of her family) for theater, and their vision of what Yiddish theater could become, kept him in the {{profession}} despite his uncle's view. When she was cast by Rosenberg opposite Jacob Spivakovsky {{in the title role}} of Abraham Goldfaden's darkly comic operetta Breindele Cossack, she pulled strings so <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> Guberman would be reassigned to Adler.|$|E

5|$|Predicted serpin {{genes are}} {{sporadically}} distributed in prokaryotes. In vitro studies {{on some of}} these molecules have revealed that they are able to inhibit proteases, and it is suggested that they function as inhibitors in vivo. Several prokaryote serpins are found in extremophiles. Accordingly, and in contrast to mammalian serpins, these molecules possess elevated resistance to heat denaturation. The precise role of most bacterial serpins remains obscure, although Clostridium thermocellum serpin localises to the cellulosome. It is suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> cellulosome-associated serpins may be to prevent unwanted protease activity against the cellulosome.|$|E
5|$|From {{the first}} article, {{cataloguing}} {{the rights of}} man, Mason derived the following articles, which make clear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> government is to secure and protect those rights, and if it fails to do so, the {{people have a right}} to amend or abolish it. Property could not be taken for public use without the owner's consent, and a citizen could only be bound by a law accepted by that person or by elected representatives. If accused, a person had the right to a speedy and local trial, based on an accusation made known to him, with the right to call for evidence and witnesses in his favor.|$|E

5|$|Hyperbaric oxygen is {{also used}} in the {{treatment}} of carbon monoxide poisoning, as it may hasten dissociation of CO from carboxyhemoglobin and cytochrome oxidase {{to a greater extent than}} normal oxygen. Hyperbaric oxygen at three times atmospheric pressure reduces the half life of carbon monoxide to 23 (~80/3 minutes) minutes, compared to 80 minutes for oxygen at regular atmospheric pressure. It may also enhance oxygen transport to the tissues by plasma, partially bypassing the normal transfer through hemoglobin. However, it is controversial whether hyperbaric oxygen actually offers any extra benefits over normal high flow oxygen, in terms of increased survival or improved long-term outcomes. There have been randomized controlled trials in which the two treatment options have been compared; of the six performed, four found hyperbaric oxygen improved outcome and two found no benefit for hyperbaric oxygen. Some of these trials have been criticized for apparent flaws in their implementation. A review of all the literature on carbon monoxide poisoning treatment concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>role</b> <b>of</b> hyperbaric oxygen is unclear and the available evidence neither confirms nor denies a medically meaningful benefit. The authors suggested a large, well designed, externally audited, multicentre trial to compare normal oxygen with hyperbaric oxygen.|$|E
