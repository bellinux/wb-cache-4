40|$|Much of Iowa is {{characterized}} by relatively flat, poorly-drained areas which with extensive subsurface drainage, have became {{some of the most}} valuable, productive land in the State. However, this drained land has also become a source of significant NO 3 loss because of the changes in land-use and hydrology brought about by tile drainage. While surface runoff is decreased with subsurface drainage (resulting in decreased losses of sediment, ammoniumnitrogen, phosphorus, pesticides and micro-organisms), subsurface flow and leaching losses of NO 3 are increased. This is due mostly to an increase in volume and the “short-circuiting” of subsurface flow, but also in part to the increased aeration of organic-rich soils with potentially increased mineralization and formation of NO 3 (and less denitrification) in the soil profile. The problem of excess nutrient loads can probably be ameliorated by a combination of in field and off site practices, but the limitations and appropriateness of alternative practices must be understood and outcomes must be measurable. Promising in field practices include nutrient management, drainage management, and alternative cropping systems.

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 The {{extent of}} {{agricultural}} drainage has created concern for its potential undesirable effects on surface water quality. Land applications of liquid manure on <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> fields {{have the potential}} to transport solutes and bacteria to the drains following precipitation or irrigation events and many times are directly sent to a surface water body, and have been documented as a source of contamination of surface waters. This study determined the potential for and magnitude of E. coli and solute migration to tile drains through the soil profile. Water from subsurface drains was analyzed for chemical and bacterial composition following tracer applications. Two sites were selected for the study to determine transport at large (field) and small (plot) scales. At the large-scale site, both tracers, bacteria (E. coli and Total Coliform) and Amino-G (a conservative tracer), were used to monitor the speed of transport from the surface to the <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> following liquid manure applications, tracer applications and additionally precipitation events. The concentrations of E. coli were monitored every hour for 76 days during the spring. Both tracers, bacteria and Amino-G, were detected in the tile drainage shortly after precipitation events. The peak concentration of E. coli was observed to be 1. 2 x 10 ⁶ CFU/l 00 mL. These elevated concentrations of E. coli might be attributed to the characteristics of the soil, high organic matter and well-structured clay soils. Both the rapid breakthrough of tracer to the <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> and the peaks of tile water temperature during precipitation events provided evidence of macropore flow. Antecedent soil moisture and warmer temperatures appeared to provide ideal conditions for bacteria growth. The small-scale study site was selected for a more focused study. The purpose of this site was to quantify more accurately the percent mass of surface applied tracer that was transported to the <b>tile</b> <b>drain,</b> allowing mass balance calculations. Experiments were conducted during the summer to control the rate and total amount of irrigation. Amino-G readings were taken every 10 seconds for 125 hours of continuous irrigation.

Cultivated areas often expanded at the expense of grassland and wetlands located in lowland areas (de Groot et al., 2002). Therefore, large modifications were made to the agricultural landscapes: stream redesign, land consolidation, removal of hedges, and installation of tile drainage networks to drain the hydromorphic soils. These changes modified sediment processes and resulted in large morphological alterations (e. g. channel bed incision, deposition of fine sediment, channel bank erosion). Accordingly, these alterations threaten water quality and prevent to meet the requirements of the European directives. Improving water quality requires a clear understanding of the hydrosedimentary dynamics in these lowland cultivated catchments. However, few studies were conducted in drained environments. To fill this research gap, a pilot study was started in cultivated catchment of the Loire River basin, France, where <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> densities are very high (> 1. 5 km/km²). Six hydro-sedimentary monitoring stations were installed in the Louroux catchment (24 km²). One of them was specifically dedicated to measuring water/sediment fluxes from tile drains.

Samples were measured for particle size distribution, and sediment tracing studies are currently being developed to quantify the contribution of potential sources (e. g. surface vs subsurface, lithologies) to river sediment.

These data demonstrated that NO 3 −–δ 15 N values often exceeded the maximum δ 15 N source of approximately + 12. 5 ‰ that was associated with hog manure in the watershed. The δ 15 N values and NO 3 − concentrations during such periods were consistent with a pattern of denitrification between precipitation events within the watershed, with values repeatedly exceeding + 15 ‰ in <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> and stream samples during extended periods with little rainfall. <b>Tile</b> <b>drain</b> NO 3 − concentrations were consistently elevated (4 – 38 mg l− 1 N) relative to streamside soil and shallow groundwater exiting the same field (0. 013 – 0. 812 mg l− 1 N). These data suggest that NO 3 −–N stable isotopes cannot be used a...|$|E
40|$|The {{agricultural}} landscape has four {{major sources of}} non-point source (NPS) pollutants. These are: 1) surface and subsurface runoff which carry sediment and agricultural chemicals to streams; 2) eroding streambanks which can contribute more than {{fifty percent of the}} sediment load to the stream; 3) field <b>tile</b> <b>drain</b> 8 which contribute the highest concentrations of soluble agricultural chemicals to streams; and 4) livestock grazing of streamside or riparian areas which contribute to bank instability and add animal waste and pathogens to the water...|$|E
50|$|A French <b>drain</b> or weeping <b>tile</b> (also blind <b>drain,</b> rubble drain, rock <b>drain,</b> <b>drain</b> <b>tile,</b> {{perimeter}} <b>drain,</b> land drain, French ditch, sub-surface drain, sub-soil drain or agricultural drain) is {{a trench}} filled with gravel or rock or containing a perforated pipe that redirects surface water and groundwater {{away from an}} area. A French drain can have perforated hollow pipes along the bottom (see images) to quickly vent water that seeps down through the upper gravel or rock.|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{in southwestern}} Ontario, liquid manure from a tank under a pig barn entered <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> located under {{the tank and}} {{contaminated}} surface water nearby. While {{this may have been}} an isolated instance, it focused attention on the ways that liquid manure storages are built on farms. It raised questions about the potential for similar spills to occur on livestock farms where liquid manure is stored. In the particular case mentioned, it appeared that there was a failure to eliminate and/or redirect the drains away from the construction project. How the manure leaked from the manure system and traveled to the <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> was unclear. This report is an attempt to establish risks involved in this and similar manure handling and storage systems, through a survey of related literature. It appears that the main issues in this discussion are: a) Field drains near farm buildings and manure storage tanks b) Integrity of manure storages c) Manure transfer systems- from barn to long-term storage Environmental Problems with Manure Storages In Ontario, the environmental track record of liquid manure storages has been fairly good...|$|R
25|$|For {{salinity}} {{control in}} such a case, annually an amount of drainage water is to be discharged from the aquifer {{by means of a}} subsurface drainage system and disposed of through a safe outlet. The drainage system may be horizontal (i.e. using pipes, <b>tile</b> <b>drains</b> or ditches) or vertical (drainage by wells). To estimate the drainage requirement, the use of a groundwater model with an agro-hydro-salinity component may be instrumental, e.g. SahysMod.|$|R
