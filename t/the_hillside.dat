5|$|On 10 August 1941 a RAF Consolidated B-24 Liberator LB-30A AM261 {{was flying}} from RAF Heathfield in Ayrshire to Gander International Airport in Canada. However, the B-24 crashed into <b>the</b> <b>hillside</b> of Mullach Buidhe north of Goat Fell where all 22 {{passengers}} and crew died.|$|E
5|$|The {{expressway}} curves eastward into {{a cut in}} <b>the</b> <b>hillside</b> as {{it passes}} the 'Half-mile' railway bridge. Immediately to the north, it meets the Bayview Avenue–Bloor Street interchange. The long off-ramp to these roads was the original southern terminus of the parkway in 1961.|$|E
5|$|The railway {{provides}} the suburb's most important industry, through <b>the</b> <b>Hillside</b> Railway Workshops, which {{are located in}} the southeast of the suburb and in the adjoining suburb of South Dunedin. Despite this, there are no longer any public railway stations or halts in Caversham, the last station having closed in 1962.|$|E
5000|$|The {{terracing}} and {{the irrigation}} of <b>the</b> <b>hillsides</b> (<b>the</b> [...] "Alta Alpujarra") {{was the work}} of Berbers, who inhabited this area after the Moorish invasion of 711 AD. They also created villages on <b>the</b> <b>hillsides</b> in <b>the</b> style to which they were accustomed in the mountains of North Africa: narrow, winding streets and small flat-roofed houses.|$|R
50|$|Vaynor lies {{north of}} the A465 road and Merthyr Tydfil town. There are many {{limestone}} quarries {{in the area and}} the remains are still visible along the trails and on <b>the</b> <b>hillsides.</b> <b>The</b> limestone quarried there has been used for centuries for buildings and bridges and also to burn and make lime for agricultural use. Ruins of limekilns are scattered around <b>the</b> <b>hillsides.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, archaeologists {{discovered}} {{the first evidence}} of possible Roman terracing on <b>the</b> <b>hillsides</b> of <b>the</b> Moselle valley: Land consolidation and the laying out of new farm tracks in vineyards on the Middle Moselle and the upper Lower Moselle exposed the foundations of ancient Celtic houses {{at the foot of}} <b>the</b> <b>hillsides.</b> <b>The</b> archaeological sites on <b>the</b> steep <b>hillsides</b> still being managed today could therefore be viewed as evidence of Roman terracing on these slopes in the 3rd century AD.|$|R
5|$|A {{temporary}} wooden {{building was}} constructed each year, called Dover Castle, from which gunfire salutes were sounded during the competitions. Competitors were summoned to <b>the</b> <b>hillside</b> {{by the sound}} of a hunting horn, to take part in various sports. Mounted cannons were fired to begin the events, which included horse-racing, coursing with hounds, running, jumping, dancing, sledgehammer throwing, fighting with swords and cudgels, quarterstaff, and wrestling. Prizes included silver trophies for the mounted sports, and perhaps also money for the other events.|$|E
5|$|Because of the hilly terrain, {{the station}} was built in a deep cutting {{excavated}} from Highgate Hill adjacent to Archway Road. Tunnels penetrated <b>the</b> <b>hillside</b> {{at each end of}} the station, leading towards East Finchley to the north and Crouch End to the south. When built, the station had two side platforms, with three tracks between them, and a station building on the south side. A footbridge linked the two platforms.|$|E
5|$|Beyond Polperro lies Talland Bay and Portnadler Bay, {{with the}} bird reserve of Looe Island (also known as St George's island) off shore. The path now enters Looe, passing through Hannafore, West Looe then, after {{crossing}} the River Looe on a seven-span bridge. The path continues {{up onto the}} cliff then heads towards Millendreath then along more cliffs, running past a 60-ft sevenfold labyrinth carved into the turf of <b>the</b> <b>hillside</b> to Seaton, Downderry, and Portwrinkle.|$|E

5|$|By noon, Knyphausen and his Hessians {{restarted}} their advance. As soon as {{the tide}} was high enough, Mathew and his troops, accompanied by Howe, were ferried across the Harlem River. They landed under heavy fire from the American artillery on the Manhattan shore. The British troops charged up <b>the</b> <b>hillside</b> and dispersed the Americans until they reached a redoubt defended by some Pennsylvania Volunteer companies. After brief fighting, the Americans turned and ran towards the fort.|$|E
5|$|Eldora Speedway, {{which opened}} in 1954, is {{considered}} to be one of 14 intermediate tracks on the Truck Series schedule, the others being Charlotte, Chicagoland, Dover, Homestead-Miami, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Las Vegas, Michigan, Phoenix, Pocono, Rockingham and Texas. The track is a 0.5 mile (0.80km) oval with turns at a 24 degree banking, while the straightaways are 8 degrees. The track's grandstands can fit 17,782 spectators, and <b>the</b> <b>hillside</b> seating can fit an unlimited number of fans.|$|E
5|$|Honiara {{has three}} main stadiums, {{the largest of}} which is Lawson Tama Stadium, {{considered}} to be the national stadium of Solomon Islands. The stadium, funded by FIFA, is built into <b>the</b> <b>hillside</b> and can hold roughly 10,000 people. The stadium hosted the 2012 OFC Nations Cup. The most recent and most prolific winners of the Telekom S-League, Koloale FC and Solomon Warriors FC, respectively, are both based out of the city.|$|E
50|$|Herds of goats, {{sheep and}} cows freely roam <b>the</b> <b>hillsides</b> around Skala. Multi {{coloured}} beehives {{can be seen}} dotted around <b>the</b> fields and <b>hillsides,</b> producing Cephalonia's thyme flavoured honey.|$|R
50|$|The village {{population}} is 216 scattered amongst farms, cottages and other housing over <b>the</b> <b>hillsides.</b>|$|R

5|$|Little {{can be seen}} of {{the levels}} now for the entrances were {{destroyed}} when the mine closed, but several spoil heaps remain, one covering the gill, along with the old miners’ path which zigzags up <b>the</b> <b>hillside,</b> a self-acting incline to lower ore to the dressing floor, and the old winding-drum house. The narrow leat which once diverted water from Brownrigg Well into the gill beside the mine may also be seen, much higher up the fellside.|$|E
5|$|Mount Osmond {{contains}} {{a number of}} historical attractions; notably in the former mines and mining infrastructure that remains on <b>the</b> <b>hillside</b> {{as a reminder of}} its past. The mines continue up throughout the hills from Glen Osmond. While Wheal Gawler and Wheal Watkins are former open-cut mines (located in Glen Osmond), Mount Osmond contains more mineshafts which are up to sixty metres deep.|$|E
5|$|Several {{memorial}} {{services have}} been held to commemorate anniversaries of the incident. As of 2006, the most recent of these was on the 25th anniversary in January 2004. Relatives of the victims joined with local residents in a special service held at St Finbarr's Church in Bantry. A memorial sculpture, incorporating the ship's bell, which was recovered from the wreck, has been erected in <b>the</b> <b>hillside</b> graveyard overlooking the harbour. The bodies of two unidentified casualties from the incident are interred nearby.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} springs {{originated}} by <b>the</b> <b>hillsides</b> {{that make up}} the Desierto de los Leones.|$|R

5|$|The church's {{community}} building, a non-contributing structure {{within the}} historic boundary, is {{southwest of the}} church. The building is a venue for Sunday school classes and community gatherings. The front gable building, completed in 1961, is sheathed in brickwork. Similar to the church, the building is built into a gently sloping bank with its one-story elevation at grade facing west toward WV 259. Its two-story eastern elevation is {{at the foot of}} <b>the</b> <b>hillside.</b>|$|E
5|$|The north {{promontory}} {{is anchored}} by a circular grass area, {{which serves as}} a heliport in case of emergencies, and the south promontory is anchored by a succulent plant and cactus garden. The complex is also encircled by access roads that lead to loading docks and staff parking garages on both the west and east sides of the buildings. <b>The</b> <b>hillside</b> around the complex has been planted with California Live Oak (Quercus agrifolia) trees.|$|E
5|$|The {{phylloxera}} {{epidemic in}} the 19th century severely affected the Languedoc wine industry, killing off {{many of the}} higher quality Vitis vinifera that were susceptible to the louse. American rootstock that was naturally resistant to phylloxera did not take well to the limestone soil on <b>the</b> <b>hillside.</b> In place of these vines, acres of the lower quality Aramon, Alicante Bouschet and Carignan were planted.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>hillsides</b> {{are well}} suited for wines and fruit orchards, and the south is suited for cereal crops.|$|R

50|$|Today you {{can find}} the first trace of humans by <b>the</b> <b>hillsides</b> that was once beaches in an archipelago.|$|R
5|$|The {{stadium is}} divided into five all-seater stands, the JCT600 Stand, the Kop, the Midland Road Stand, the North West Corner and the TL Dallas Stand. All five stands are covered except for {{a small part of}} the main stand, and all but the Midland Road Stand being two-tiered. Most of the stands are {{cantilever}} structures, and because of the ground's location on <b>the</b> <b>hillside,</b> the Midland Road Stand overhangs the road.|$|E
5|$|There {{were few}} {{industrial}} buildings pre-1850; those of note include the 17th-century blast furnace at Pontygwaith {{which gave the}} village its name and the fulling mill established by Harri David in 1738, which in turn gave its name to Tonypandy. Corn mills existed sparsely throughout the valleys as did early coal pits, with two early pits recorded as being opened in 1612 at Rhigos and Cwmparc; though these would have mined from exposed rock in <b>the</b> <b>hillside</b> and not deep mined.|$|E
5|$|Whatever its origin, {{the giant}} {{has become an}} {{important}} part of the culture and folklore of Dorset. Some folk stories indicate that the image is an outline of the corpse of a real giant. One story says the giant came from Denmark leading an invasion of the coast, and was beheaded by the people of Cerne Abbas while he slept on <b>the</b> <b>hillside.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{engineers}} {{finally decided}} which route through <b>the</b> <b>hillsides</b> to take by connecting and widening the Manomet and Scusset Rivers.|$|R
50|$|Puno is {{situated}} between {{the shores of}} Lake Titicaca and the mountains surrounding the city. There is less than two miles of flat land between the shores and the foothills, which has caused the growing city to continue to expand upwards onto <b>the</b> <b>hillsides.</b> As a result, the town's less developed and poorest areas, which are high on <b>the</b> <b>hillsides,</b> often have very steep streets, which are generally unpaved and cannot be accessed by automobile.|$|R
50|$|Once {{the large}} timbers were cut from <b>the</b> <b>hillsides</b> and <b>the</b> valley, this made way for dairies and small crops farming.|$|R
