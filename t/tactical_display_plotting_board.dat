25|$|When {{the battery}} was given orders {{to attack a}} target, the alert status lamp changed from blue to red. When the TTR and MTR radars were locked, the {{computer}} had a firing solution and the missile reported active, the LA lamp changed from amber to green, indicating the ability to fire. At this time the target information and the intercept point were <b>displayed</b> on the <b>plotting</b> <b>boards</b> and the BCO selected {{the right time to}} manually fire.|$|R
2500|$|Prior to launch, the Missile Tracking Radar (MTR) {{locked on}} to the {{transponder}} in the selected missile. Like the Ajax, the Hercules used a transponder in the missile. A short period after launch the actual location, i.e. azimuth, elevation and range of the missile were <b>displayed</b> on the <b>plotting</b> <b>boards.</b> The firing or launch command was given manually by the Battery Control Officer based on orders or Rules of Engagements. To ensure the MTR could see and track the missile during its initial rapid assent as it launched, the IFC was normally located about [...] from the [...] "Launching Area" [...] (LA). In the case of Hercules, all of the radars were typically mounted on (concrete) elevated platforms to improve their line-of-sight.|$|R

50|$|A <b>plotting</b> <b>board</b> was a {{mechanical}} device {{used by the}} U.S. Coast Artillery to track the observed course of a target (typically a moving ship), project its future position, and derive the uncorrected data on azimuth (or direction) and range needed to direct the fire of the guns of a battery to hit that target. <b>Plotting</b> <b>boards</b> of this sort were first employed by the Coast Artillery around 1905, and were the primary means of calculating firing data until WW2.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimitedThis thesis investigates {{the utility of}} figurative symbology for tacticai situation displays. The purpose {{was to determine if}} n ore descriptive symbology — figurative symbology or use of more lifelike images to represent targets—would enhance evaluation of a <b>tactical</b> situation <b>display,</b> i. e., enable the user to more rapidly assimilate and evaluate a <b>tactical</b> situation <b>display.</b> Basis for comparison was the Navy <b>Tactical</b> <b>Display</b> System (NTDS). Specifically, experiments used in our research included comparisons of monochromatic NTDS, color NTDS, and color figurative symbclcgies. The analysis of the data obtained from the experiments suggests color symbology is significantly better than monochromatic symbology and figurative is better than NTDS symbology. Specifically, color f igurative(green/red } was determined to be best, followed in order by, color figurative(blue/orange), color NTDS, then monochromatic NTDS.
