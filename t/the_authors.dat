5|$|<b>The</b> <b>authors</b> {{have named}} several other authors {{as sources of}} {{inspiration}} when writing the novels. In an online author chat, Cherith Baldry listed <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> that inspire her as including Tolkien, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Shakespeare. In the same chat, Victoria Holmes stated that Jacqueline Wilson, Kathy Reichs, and J. K. Rowling are some of <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> that inspire her. According to the official website, other authors who have inspired the writers include Enid Blyton, Lucy Daniels, Ellis Peters, Tess Gerritsen, Kate Ellis, Lisa Gardiner, and Meg Cabot. <b>The</b> <b>authors</b> have also mentioned several other sources of inspiration. The New Forest in southern England was the base for the forest where the original series took place. Other influential locations include Loch Lomond, {{as well as the}} Scottish Highlands. Nicholas Culpeper, a physician who used materials occurring in the natural world as medicine, also had an influence on the Warriors series. His book, Culpeper's Herbal, is used as a source by <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> for the herbal remedies that the cats use in the books. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> suggested that they may use some fan-created names in future books. Also mentioned as a source of inspiration was the film series Rambo.|$|E
5|$|Grown on agar plates, the mycelia of A.serialiformis and A.serialis have {{identical}} chemical reactivity, and {{are rather}} similar in appearance, although <b>the</b> <b>authors</b> {{note that the}} former's was more cottony than the latter's. <b>The</b> <b>authors</b> mated several combinations of North American collections using vegetative compatibility tests, and confirmed the presence of different mating alleles—indicating {{that all of the}} North American collections represented a single species. Similar pairings performed between North American and European collections showed the species to be incompatible, and therefore distinct.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, morphological, {{ecological}} and molecular traits of all putative tiger subspecies were analysed in a combined approach. Results support distinction {{of the two}} evolutionary groups continental and Sunda tigers. <b>The</b> <b>authors</b> proposed recognition of only two subspecies, namely Panthera tigris tigris comprising the Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese, South Chinese, Siberian and Caspian tiger populations, and Panthera tigris sondaica comprising the Javan, Bali and Sumatran tiger populations. <b>The</b> <b>authors</b> also noted that this reclassification will affect tiger conservation management.|$|E

Then <b>the</b> <b>author</b> characterizes world wheat production for the period 2003 - 2013. <b>The</b> <b>author</b> gives an example that shows the volatility of the wheat market (CBOT). <b>The</b> <b>author</b> explains why he uses quotations of forward contracts, {{and not in the}} spot market. <b>The</b> <b>author</b> scrutinizes <b>the</b> quotations of CBOT wheat futures contracts in <b>the</b> paper. <b>The</b> <b>author</b> substantiates <b>the</b> need for an econometric model in the research process of futures CBOT wheat prices. <b>The</b> <b>author</b> justifies <b>the</b> chosen scientific approach that defines the methods of research and research model. <b>The</b> <b>author</b> uses econometric approach in <b>the</b> paper. <b>The</b> <b>author</b> uses linear regression as a method of <b>the</b> research. <b>The</b> <b>author</b> creates <b>the</b> equation of linear regression using <b>the</b> software. <b>The</b> <b>author</b> makes a conclusion that there is a certain linear relationship between the price of the futures contract CBOT wheat and the level of unemployment in the United States during <b>the</b> period. <b>The</b> <b>author</b> verifies <b>the</b> effect of Phillips curve.
