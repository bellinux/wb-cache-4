40|$|Abstract—Matrix-addressed {{capacitive}} sensing is popularly {{employed in}} advanced multi-touch panels. While {{the number of}} simultaneous touch points of a passively addressed matrix is limited, the simultaneous touch points of an actively addressed matrix are constrained only {{by the size of}} the matrix and can be more densely packed. Since the touch panel is typically inserted between a display panel and the user, it would be the best if the transistors in an active-matrix touch panel are <b>transparent.</b> <b>Reported</b> presently is such a panel realized using a fluorinated zinc oxide transparent thin-film transistor technology. The technology can be applied to construct panels requiring high touch resolution, such as precision stylus pen-based writing, fingerprint sensing and sensing of the area of the touch, etc. Index Terms—Multi-touch, thin-film transistor, transparen...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This paper aims {{to explore}} the {{relationship}} between corporate social responsibility (CSR) disclosures and earnings quality proxied by earnings accruals. Specifically, we examine whether CSR disclosures are context-specific, that is, whether companies dominated by powerful stakeholders are obliged to behave in a responsible manner to constrain earnings management, thereby reporting higher-quality earnings to investors. Design/methodology/approach – This paper explores the relationship between CSR disclosures and earnings quality proxied by earnings accruals. Specifically, we examine whether CSR disclosures are context-specific, that is, whether companies dominated by powerful stakeholders are obliged to behave in a responsible manner to constrain earnings management, thereby reporting higher-quality earnings to investors. Findings – Results show that managers in an emerging economy manage earnings when they provide more CSR disclosures. Such earnings management is achieved through income increasing discretionary accruals. Furthermore, companies from export-oriented industries dominated by powerful stakeholders (international buyers) disclosing more CSR activities, provide <b>transparent</b> financial <b>reports</b> through constraining earnings management. Originality/value – The {{findings of this study}} are significant for both investors and policymakers. Investors should not take for granted that firms engage in CSR activities, behave ethically and provide <b>transparent</b> financial <b>reports.</b> As we document that firms might manipulate earnings through discretionary accruals and provide less <b>transparent</b> financial <b>reports</b> to shareholders, the credibility of firms’ CSR policies should be assessed with caution. Policies directing at promoting socially responsible practices instead of motivating the desired behaviour, may provide managers with additional incentives to utilise CSR for opportunistic behaviour. Thus, policymakers need to be cautious about this opportunistic behaviour and enhance monitoring to enforce social compliance. Possibly, some guidelines can be introduced to confirm that CSR disclosures are based on actual practice and not just a “green wash” statement to deceive stakeholders...|$|R

5000|$|An {{example of}} an {{organization}} seeking a triple bottom line would be a social enterprise run as a non-profit, but earning income by offering opportunities for handicapped {{people who have been}} labelled [...] "unemployable", to earn a living by recycling. The organization earns a profit, which is controlled by a volunteer Board, and ploughed back into the community. The social benefit is the meaningful employment of disadvantaged citizens, and the reduction in the society's welfare or disability costs. The environmental benefit comes from the recycling accomplished. In the private sector, a commitment to corporate social responsibility (CSR) implies a commitment to <b>transparent</b> <b>reporting</b> about the business' material impact for good on the environment and people. Triple bottom line is one framework for reporting this material impact. This is distinct from the more limited changes required to deal only with ecological issues. The triple bottom line has also been extended to encompass four pillars, known as the quadruple bottom line (QBL). The fourth pillar denotes a future-oriented approach (future generations, intergenerational equity, etc.). It is a long-term outlook that sets sustainable development and sustainability concerns apart from previous social, environmental, and economic considerations.|$|E
