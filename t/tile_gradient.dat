Econometric methods of structural estimation general 1 y assume linearity of the model in both variables and parameters. On the other hand, many contemporary models of economic behavior are both nonlinear and simultaneous. Modern demand analysis. for example, starts from a rich specification of individual tastes for a variety of goods and deals with the structural relation it implies among prices. quantities, and income. This relation is nonlinear in both variables and parameters in al 1 but the simplest cases. Similariy, models of production with many factors are invariably nonlinear in their variables, and are frequently nonlinear in thei...|$|E
40|$|An {{alternative}} to traditional cleaning methods of heavy metals {{in the water}} environment is phytoremediation. They efficiency depends on used technological process conditions as well as plant species. One {{of the most dangerous}} metallic elements mercury plays a particular role, which is a trace element and a physiologically foreign in living organisms. Mercury has a high degree of toxicity with strong affinity to thiol groups. This may cause an adverse effect on the enzymatic processes and consequently inhibiting the physiological functions. Because of high risk for human health, water environment treatment from mercury is essential proecological action. Mercury removal studies were conducted using Salvinia natans pleustofit, sampled from its natural water environment. In the first step, epiphytic bacteria, which was resistant to high concentrations of mercury (0, 6 mgHg/l), was isolated from the plant and than selected by the <b>tiles</b> <b>gradient</b> mthod. In the next step, the identification using molecular biology methods was made. In the following step plant Salvinia natans was exposure to high levels of mercury {{in the presence of the}} three isolated Pseudomonas strains with exceptional resistance characteristics to environmental factors. Has been found a positive bacteria effect on the plant condition because the selected strains belong to Pseudomonas species producing materials supporting plant growth. The use of microbial stimulation to phytoremediation by hyperaccumulator Salvinia natans can multiply the effectiveness of the process...|$|R

Every Actor's drawing style was controlled by a Renderer, which aided the GUI building process. For instance, the BevelRenderer could be used bevel the edges around an Actor, producing an effect like Windows 3.x controls or the title bar in NeXTSTEP. Other renderers included color and image fills, <b>gradients,</b> <b>tiles</b> and blends. Although {{there was no difference}} in programming terms, basic objects like rectangles were classified [...] "geometry actors" [...] while more traditional GUI elements like buttons were known as [...] "interface actors".|$|R
40|$|The {{so-called}} micromosaico (minute mosaic) is {{a singular}} form of urban representation, that has comtributed, {{since the end}} of XVIII century to spread throughout Europe, by production of jewelry and precious articles, the image of monuments and cities of Italy such as destinations of the Grand Tour. This technique obtained the citizenship in Vatican by the establishment in 1587 of the mosaic school of the Reverenda Fabbrica di San Pietro, with the task of decorating the interior of the basilica and replaying in a non-perishable form the pictorial heritage. The objective of imitating painting had requested a specific technical research, aimed at obtaining an almost infinite chromatic range of enamels, able to simulate the results of chromatic modulation obtained by brush. Despite this great technical skill, at the end of XVIII century the completion of the works of reproduction threatened to leave unemployed the mosaicists of the school, transformed by institution of the Studio del Mosaico Vaticano. It happened, however, that two of the most skilled and renowned of them, Cesare Aguatti and Giacomo Raffaelli, devised the so-called technique of "spun enamel", consisting in spinning of the vitreous enamel surface of the mosaic tiles, so as to obtain thin bars (1 millimeter in cross section). These could be segmented into tiles to compose tiny mosaics for inserting in wide range of items to serve as Italienreise souvenir: furnishings, such as coffee tables or fireplace coatings, or much smaller articles, such as snuff-boxes or jewelry. The ichonografic themes, which initially consisted mainly of classical antiquities, have gradually expanded to include depictions of the most popular urban places of Rome and then, since XIX century, even of other cities - Milan, Naples, Venice – where, in the Napoleon’s Era, they tried to export the know-how of the Roman Studio and, in parallel, developing their chromatic experimentation. The beginning phase of the micromosaic, coinciding with the last quarter of XVIII century, is dominated by the Giacomo Raffaelli’s personality, whose palette already included 872 different shades from 18 basic colors, among which predominates quantitatively the flesh-colored (over 800 bars) and the green color, with 77 different shades. The second phase, has been caracterized by the Antonio Aguatti’s invention of the so-called malmischiato, <b>gradient</b> <b>tiles</b> obtained by spinning of bars in variegated colors, that brings the art of micromosaic to its full maturity. The third phase started from the Michelangelo Barberi’s invention of the colori a soffio (colours by blowing), obtained by using in the spinning a weld lamp used by goldsmiths. These bars show colours with a particular vividness and a chromatic spectrum much broader than that obtained in furnace. So, if throug time the production of engravings and urban views has provided to mosacists a rich iconographic base for inspiration, we must not believe that this has been a mere work of reproduction or virtuosity of craftsmanship, because the transition from the incision in black and white to the composition mosaic, introduces the color - which, in the extremely small size of the final image, is fully in charge of the perspective composition - an absolutely original factor, wich can now boast a range of 28, 000 different color variations, the so-called munizioni (ammunitions) still in the possession of the Studio del Mosaico Vaticano...|$|R
