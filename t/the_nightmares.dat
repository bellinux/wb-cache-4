25|$|After {{failing to}} catch on in Texas and leaving the AWA, the Fabulous Ones {{returned}} ”home” to Memphis and were immediately thrust into the tag team title chase. On October 8 the Fabs defeated first <b>the</b> <b>Nightmares</b> then the Dirty White Boys before losing to Rick Rude and King Kong Bundy in a one night tournament to crown new Southern Tag Team Champions. Keirn and Lane soon got their revenge by winning their 8th Southern Tag Team title from Bundy and Rude on October 22. The team {{held on to the}} gold for a little over 6 weeks before losing it to the team of Don Bass and Roger Smith, also known as the Interns. On February 17, 1985 the Fabulous Ones regained the Southern Tag-Team championship from the Interns before launching into a feud with the PYT Express (Koko Ware and Norvell Austin), a team that like the Fabulous Ones played on the “Pretty Boy” gimmick. On April 15 the PYT Express won the gold through underhanded means and continued to fend off the Fabulous Ones through various “shady” tactics until they were stripped of the gold in June. After the PYT Express left the area Keirn and Lane easily won the Southern Tag Team Title once more defeating Ron Sexton and Billy Travis in a tournament final.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} type of ghosts, {{referred}} to as ghosts or the dead, are the hun or higher souls of mortals who have refused to pass into Lethe and reincarnation due to their attachment to their mortal lives. These ghosts are much weaker than Exalted, and they can only respire Essence in the Underworld and Shadowlands. Hungry ghosts generally come into existence due to betrayal, vengeance or a traumatic death. Initially, a hungry ghost includes both the higher soul and the po, or lower soul, but the hun soon moves on, leaving the hungry ghost largely mindless. Unlike other ghosts, hungry ghosts are naturally material in Creation at night. Nephwracks are ghosts who have been corrupted by the Neverborn. Unlike uncorrupted ghosts, they are capable of using necromancy. The Deathlords are thirteen ghosts of powerful Solar Exalted who have been empowered by the Neverborn, and although they are not technically Exalted, they have access to Abyssal Charms. Spectres, also known as plasmics, are bizarre creatures spawned by <b>the</b> <b>nightmares</b> of the Neverborn. The category of Hekatonkhire includes the ghosts of demons, devas and Primordial behemoths, as well as the manifested nightmares of the Neverborn. The Neverborn are the ghosts of slain Primordials. Immensely powerful, they are difficult to rouse from their slumber, and their power seems largely constrained to the Labyrinth. Only mundane ghosts and Hekatonkhire can be summoned through necromancy, and only mundane ghosts can be summoned through sorcery.|$|E

Silcott {{said he had been}} asleep in a police cell when it was taken; he said he was woken up, held in a corridor with his arms pinned against a wall and photographed, and that {{the expression on his face}} was one of fear. Its publication constituted [...] "the most gross contempt," [...] according to the trial judge, Sir Derek Hodgson (1917–2002), speaking to David Rose in 1992. No action was taken against the newspaper.|$|E
500|$|Similarly to Wasserman's {{unfinished}} commission, 1968's The Alphabet {{was composed}} of both live action and animation. The abstract 16mm movie was inspired by an experience related by Lynch's wife Peggy, who had once seen her niece reciting the alphabet in her sleep while suffering from a nightmare. Peggy was the sole live action actor in the film, which depicted in animation <b>the</b> <b>nightmares</b> [...] of a young girl. The film displays several elements that would continue throughout Lynch's oeuvre, {{including the use of}} meticulous sound design to convey unease. The sound of his infant daughter crying was recorded on a faulty cassette recorder and included in the film's soundtrack; the malfunctioning of the recorder not only lent the sound a desirably distorted quality but allowed Lynch to return it to where he had purchased it from upon finishing the film.|$|E

The series' story centers around its playable character, Kratos, a Spartan warrior tricked into killing his wife and daughter by his former master, the God of War Ares. Kratos kills Ares {{at the behest of the}} goddess Athena and takes his place as the new God of War, but is still haunted by <b>the</b> <b>nightmares</b> of his past.

500|$|The plot of {{the game}} was {{generally}} well received by reviewers, who praised it as horrifying, compelling, and [...] "dark". 1UP.com praised the titular room as constantly maintaining a sense of unease for the player. Game Revolution enjoyed the relatively normal appearance of the environment outside Henry's room at the game's beginning, writing: [...] "Are these strange otherworlds real, or are they just <b>the</b> <b>nightmares</b> of some lunatic shut-in who chained up his own door? It effectively blurs the line between reality and delusion, leading to a singularly creepy game." [...] In contrast, IGN's Douglass C. Perry felt that the familiarity of the story {{as compared with the}} other Silent Hill storylines detracted from its horror appeal, although he cared about its characters more than in previous games. Critics were, for the most part, pleased with the voice acting in the game, although it did receive criticism for the characters' calmness.

500|$|Mahoney says {{language}} {{serves as}} [...] "a vehicle for corruption", as Dussander tells Bowden horrific {{stories of his}} service at the fictional Death Camp of Patin. Bowden, in listening to the stories, becomes [...] "a vampiric extension of the evil" [...] that Dussander exhibits. The sharing of stories lead both Dussander and Bowden to have nightmares, and for Bowden, <b>the</b> <b>nightmares</b> are [...] "a past that is becoming ever more present". One of the key motifs {{of the film is}} that [...] "a door was opened that could not be shut", referring to Dussander's confession about following orders and being unable to hold back. The motif is also conveyed in the scene in which Bowden forces Dussander to put on a Schutzstaffel uniform and to march to Bowden's commands. Dussander continues marching despite Bowden's insistences to stop, emulating the premise of the poem The Sorcerer's Apprentice in which the untrained apprentice uses magic to enchant brooms and lacks the skill to stop them. The scene is [...] "the figurative and literal turning point in the film".|$|E
500|$|Tom Phillips of Metro {{stated that}} [...] "Amy and Canton's sojourn to the orphanage {{was not just}} a high-mark for sheer skin-crawling horror on recent {{mainstream}} telly— that image of The Silence nesting on the ceiling like cadaverous bat-people will live on in <b>the</b> <b>nightmares</b> of many, many children— but also genuinely, properly weird." [...] Dave Golder from SFX thought that although the series was [...] "shaping up to be like no other before it, as the show moves even further away from its traditional series of sequential standalone stories format and more towards Lost style storytelling", that the episode [...] "is no mere exercise in delayed gratification. You want fun? You want creepy? You want action? You've got it– all not-so-neatly tied up with a neat bow tie." [...] Golder went on to state that [...] "once again we're treated to some outstanding direction, glorious performances, near flawless FX and gorgeous locations ... "Day Of The Moon" [...] is huge fun, effortlessly entertaining, beguilingly bat's-arse [...] and blessed with a cliffhanger so jawdroppingly unexpected it's bound to keep viewers hooked".

500|$|The Eye of Ra {{could also}} be invoked to defend {{ordinary}} people. Some apotropaic amulets {{in the shape of}} the Eye of Horus bear the figure of a goddess on one side. These amulets are most likely an allusion to the connection between the Eye of Horus and the Eye of Ra, invoking their power for personal protection. In addition, certain magical spells from the New Kingdom involve the placement of clay model uraei around a house or a room, invoking the protection of the solar uraeus as in the temple rituals. These uraei are intended to ward off evil spirits and <b>the</b> <b>nightmares</b> that they were believed to cause, or other enemies of the house's occupant. The spell says the models have [...] "fire in their mouths". Models like those in the spells have been found in the remains of ancient Egyptian towns, and they include bowls in front of their mouths where fuel could be burnt, although the known examples do not show signs of burning. Whether literal or metaphorical, the fire in the cobras' mouths, like the flames spat by the Eye of Ra, was meant to dispel the nocturnal darkness and burn the dangerous beings that move within it.|$|E
