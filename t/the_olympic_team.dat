After this disappointing {{defeat at}} his first appearance at a world championships, Ohno returned home to Seattle. He did not train from April to August 1997, so he gained weight and was ill-prepared for the 1998 Nagano Winter Olympics. As a result, he finished last in the Olympic trials and did not qualify for <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>team.</b> Because of his losses at the World Championships and his failure to qualify for <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>team,</b> Ohno recommitted himself to the sport and returned to junior-level skating at Lake Placid, rather than at Colorado Springs.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, protest against South Africa's {{apartheid}} regime reached {{the stage of}} seeking to exclude the nation from international sport. In 1956, government rules requiring separate events for whites and non-whites in South Africa were issued; non-whites received poorer facilities. Brundage initially opposed taking any action. The run-up to the 1960 Rome Olympics had seen tumult in South Africa, including the Sharpeville massacre and a crackdown on the African National Congress. Activists attempted to persuade Brundage that South Africa should be excluded from the Games. Brundage initially took the word of South African sport leaders that all citizens were able to compete for a place on <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> <b>team,</b> and that non-white South Africans simply were not good enough.|$|E

5|$|Built in 1900 for the German Far East mail routes, SS Kiautschou {{traveled}} between Hamburg and Far East ports {{for most}} of her Hamburg America Line career. In 1904, she was traded to competitor North German Lloyd for five freighters, and renamed SS Princess Alice. She sailed both transatlantic and Far East mail routes until the outbreak of World War I, when she was interned in the neutral port of Cebu in the Philippines. Seized by the U.S. in 1917, the newly renamed USS Princess Matoika carried over 50,000U.S. troops to and from France in U.S. Navy service from 1918 to 1919. As an Army transport after that, she continued to return troops and repatriated the remains of Americans killed overseas in the war.
