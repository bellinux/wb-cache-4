40|$|Tagetes species {{belonging}} to family Asteraceae, are {{most common in}} plant kingdom, which is used in different areas like cosmetic preparation, medicines {{as well as it}} is most widely used as ornamentals. It is found in different colors and different fragrance. Yellow color is most common. Flowers are mainly used for the all these purposes by the extraction process. Lutein is an oxycarotenoid, or xanthophyll, containing 2 cyclic end groups (one beta and one alpha-ionone ring) and the basic C- 40 isoprenoid structure common to all carotenoids. It {{is one of the major}} constituents and the main pigment of Tagetes erecta. It has a strongly aromatic essential oil (<b>Tagetes</b> <b>oil),</b> quercetagetin, a glucoside of quercetagetin, phenolics, syringic acid, methyl- 3, 5 -dihydroxy- 4 - methoxy benzoate, quercetin, thienyl and ethyl gallate, terpines, and other important phytochemical constituents from the different part of the plant. The leaves are reported to be effective against piles, kidney troubles, muscularpain, ulcers, and wounds. The flower is useful in fevers, epileptic fits (Ayurveda), astringent, carminative, stomachic, scabies and liver complaints and is also employed in diseases of the eyes. It shows different pharmacological activities like Anti-bacterial Activity, Anti-microbial Activity, hepatoprotective activity, Insecticidal activity, Mosquitocidal activity, Nematicidal activity, Wound healing activity, Anti oxidant and Analgesic activity Larvicidal activity,Sub acute toxicity studies also studies Tagetes species for Nematode Management in details...|$|E

The <b>Tagetes</b> extracts and <b>oils</b> {{should not be used}} as ingredients of sunscreen products. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc...|$|R

The toxicity of z-β-ocimene and dihydrotagetone (isolated from the <b>oil</b> of <b>Tagetes</b> minuta) to eggs and juveniles of Meloidogyne incognita was investigated in vitro. <b>Tagetes</b> minuta <b>oil</b> at 4 %, 3 %, 2 % and 1 % was strongly toxic to eggs and juveniles of M. incognita. Further studies revealed that dihydrotagetone and z-β-ocimene isolated from the oil showed strong nematicidal activity against M. incognita, with dihydrotagetone showing a higher level of toxicity than z-β-ocimene. The {{results of this study suggest}} that dihydrotagetone and z-β-ocimene isolated from T. minuta oil are potential sources of botanicals for control of the root-knot nematode M. incognita...|$|R
30|$|Major {{constituents}} {{from the}} <b>Tagetes</b> patella essential <b>oil</b> such as limonene, β-ocimene, and β-caryophyllene possessed potent larvicidal activity (Rana & Rana, 2012). Similar compound such as limonene and β-caryophyllene present in L. aspera {{may be responsible}} for the potent larvicidal activity; these phytocompounds {{may be responsible for}} ecdysal failure and mortality (Hemalatha, Elumalai, Vignesh, Murugesan, & Kaleena, 2014). Besides toxic and repellent properties, essential oils have been shown to have a pronounced effect on the developmental period, growth, adult emergence, fecundity, fertility, and egg hatching of insects (Elango, Rahuman, Kamaraj, Zahir, & Bagavan, 2010).|$|R
