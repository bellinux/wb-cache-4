The coloured version of the rings—blue, yellow, black, green, and red—over a white field forms <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> flag. These colours were chosen because every nation had {{at least one of them}} on its national flag. The flag was adopted in 1914 but flown for the first time only at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. It has since been hoisted during each celebration of the Games.|$|E

5|$|However, Ohno would {{struggle}} at the 1997 World Championships in Nagano, Japan, finishing 19th overall. After this disappointing {{defeat at}} his first appearance at a world championships, Ohno returned home to Seattle.

As a result, he finished last in <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> trials and did not qualify for <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> team.

5|$|In October and November 2004, the IOC {{established}} an Olympic Programme Commission, which was tasked with reviewing the sports on <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> programme and all non-Olympic recognised sports. The {{goal was to}} apply a systematic approach to establishing <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> programme for each celebration of the Games. The commission formulated seven criteria to judge whether a sport should be included on <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> programme. These criteria are history and tradition of the sport, universality, popularity of the sport, image, athletes' health, development of the International Federation that governs the sport, and costs of holding the sport. From this study five recognised sports emerged as candidates for inclusion at the 2012 Summer Olympics: golf, karate, rugby union, roller sports and squash. These sports were reviewed by the IOC Executive Board and then referred to the General Session in Singapore in July 2005. Of the five sports recommended for inclusion only two were selected as finalists: karate and squash. Neither sport attained the required two-thirds vote and consequently they were not promoted to <b>the</b> <b>Olympic</b> programme. In October 2009 the IOC voted to instate golf and rugby union as Olympic sports for the 2016 and 2020 Summer Olympic Games.|$|E
