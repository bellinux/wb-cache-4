5|$|After Player Piano, Vonnegut {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>short</b> {{stories to}} various magazines. In 1954 {{the couple had}} a third child, Nanette. With a growing family and no financially successful novels yet, Vonnegut's short stories sustained the family. In 1958, his sister, Alice, died of cancer two days after her husband, James Carmalt Adams, {{was killed in a}} train accident. Vonnegut adopted Alice's three young sons—James, Steven, and Kurt, aged 14, 11, and 9 respectively.|$|E
25|$|In limited circumstances, certain {{convertible}} bonds {{can be sold}} short, thus depressing the market value for a stock, and allowing the debt-holder to claim more stock with which <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>short.</b> This is known as death spiral financing.|$|E
500|$|The {{financial}} security and social prosperity that the Vonneguts once enjoyed were destroyed {{in a matter}} of years. The Liebers's brewery was closed in 1921 after the advent of Prohibition in the United States. When the Great Depression hit, few people could afford to build, causing clients at Kurt Sr.'s architectural firm to become scarce. Vonnegut's brother and sister had finished their primary and secondary educations in private schools, but Vonnegut was placed in a public school, called Public School No. 43, now known as the James Whitcomb Riley School. He was not bothered by this, but both his parents were affected deeply by their economic misfortune. His father withdrew from normal life and became what Vonnegut called a [...] "dreamy artist". His mother became depressed, withdrawn, bitter, and abusive. She labored to regain the family's wealth and status, and Vonnegut said she expressed hatred [...] "as corrosive as hydrochloric acid" [...] for her husband. Edith Vonnegut forayed into writing and tried <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>short</b> stories to magazines like Collier's and The Saturday Evening Post with no success.|$|E
5000|$|Bond funds {{usually have}} a target length, such as five to ten years. Thus over time, they need <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>shorter</b> bonds and buy longer bonds to stay in range.

40|$|The SEC has plenary {{authority}} over the <b>short</b> <b>selling</b> of exchangeregistered securities. In the past it has altered the regulatory framework for <b>short</b> <b>selling</b> only occasionally, relying primarily on no-action letters to guide evolving practices and issues. Since early 2008, the SEC promulgated, either on a proposing, final, interim-final, or emergency basis, a raft of rules related <b>to</b> <b>short</b> <b>selling,</b> all of which generally restrict the ability of investors <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> stocks <b>short.</b> Much of this rulemaking reverses a course of policy set out by the SEC to carefully balance efficiency and market quality issues. This paper considers various reasons the SEC may have struck out on such a divergent course. In particular, it highlights the role of external influences on the SEC as it relates <b>to</b> <b>short</b> <b>selling</b> policy...|$|R
2500|$|Keep also {{invested}} heavily in the New York Central Railroad. Beginning in 1865, Cornelius Vanderbilt began to wage a long and bitter war {{for control of the}} Central. The Central was governed by a clique of men known as the [...] "Albany Regency", and controlled most of the rail traffic outside of New York City. [...] But Vanderbilt's Hudson River Railroad not only had the only direct link between Albany, New York, and New York City but also had the only rail line into lower Manhattan. Vanderbilt won an agreement with the Central to transfer freight to his line. The contract also required the Central to pay the Hudson River Railroad $100,000 a year ($ in [...] dollars) for keeping extra rolling stock on hand in the summer to handle the increased traffic moving north. Keep, LeGrand Lockwood, and American Express and Wells Fargo founder William Fargo decided to seek control of the Central. They quickly amassed almost two-thirds of the company's stock, and ousted the [...] "Albany Regency". Keep, elected president of the Central on December 12, 1866, immediately revoked the yearly payment. An outraged Vanderbilt stopped carrying all Central freight. Steamboats could not move the Central's cargoes because the Hudson River was frozen due to a harsh winter. Freight backed up in Albany, and New York City was effectively cut off by rail. The Central's stock price fell. In an attempt to make money off the situation, Keep borrowed a significant number of shares <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>short.</b> Flooding the market with shares only drove the price further downward, and Vanderbilt and his allies quickly purchased these shares. [...] This forced Keep to pay his lenders out of his own pocket, hurting him financially, and allowed the Vanderbilt group to gain control of the Central. Keep resigned, and Horace Henry Baxter was named president of the Central in December 1866.|$|E

50|$|Pump {{and dump}} stock scams are {{prevalent}} in spam, accounting for about 15% of spam e-mail messages.

A study by Böhme and Holz shows a similar effect. Stocks targeted by spam are almost always penny stocks, selling for less than $5 per share, not traded on major exchanges, are thinly traded, and are difficult or impossible <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>short.</b> Spammers acquire stock before sending the messages, and sell the day the message is sent.|$|E
50|$|Many small {{companies}} rely on selling convertible debt to large private investors (see private investment in public equity) to fund their operations and growth. This convertible debt, often convertible preferred stock or convertible debentures, {{can be converted}} to the common stock of the issuing company often at steep discounts to the market value of the common stock. Under the typical “death spiral” scenario, the holder of the convertible debt initially shorts the issuer’s common stock, which often causes the stock price to decline, at which time the debt holder converts some of the convertible debt to common shares with which he then covers the debt holder's short position. The debt holder continues <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>short</b> and cover with converted stock, which, along with selling by other shareholders alarmed by the falling price, continually weakens the share price, making the shares unattractive to new investors and possibly severely limiting the company’s ability to obtain new financing if necessary.|$|E
5000|$|Swarthout {{also began}} <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>short</b> stories to {{national}} publications like Cosmopolitan and The Saturday Evening Post. He was paid $2500 in 1955 {{for one of}} these stories, [...] "A Horse for Mrs. Custer," [...] which became a Randolph Scott low-budget Western for Columbia Pictures in 1956, under the title 7th Cavalry. The day after he finished his last doctoral examination he started writing a novel called They Came To Cordura. Its setting was Mexico of 1916 during the Pershing Expedition to capture Pancho Villa, and some of its fictional cavalry troopers had been nominated for Medals of Honor for their valor during the actual last mounted cavalry charge the U. S. Army ever conducted. The book was quickly sold to Random House and then to Columbia Pictures in 1958, becoming one of their major motion pictures starring Gary Cooper and Rita Hayworth a year later. This NY Times bestseller and the movie money enabled Swarthout to become a professional writer at last. He was 39 years old.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the recent regulatory developments with regard <b>to</b> <b>short</b> <b>selling.</b> <b>Short</b> <b>selling</b> regulation {{is an important factor}} in firm governance because it affects the way in which firms are subject to market discipline. As the financial crisis has attracted regulators’ notice <b>to</b> <b>short</b> <b>selling</b> once again, it is important to understand the fundamental legal and economic arguments regarding <b>short</b> <b>selling.</b> These arguments have at their core the question of whether there exists a market failure. The available evidence on balance suggests that <b>short</b> <b>selling</b> restrictions hamper the price discovery process. Also, while regulations against market abuse are required, it is often an ineffective detour to pursue the goal of fair markets through the regulation of <b>short</b> <b>selling.</b> On the basis of these arguments, the article evaluates the approaches taken by the US and UK regulators, who play a leading part in the current movement towards more comprehensive <b>short</b> <b>selling</b> regulation. The US Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC's) recently adopted rules do not seem to bring much added value and will presumably affect market efficiency in the negative. First principles suggest a somewhat more positive stance on the SEC's proposal for a circuit breaker rule and the UK. Financial Services Authority's proposed disclosure approach, though both are subject to caveats. We also highlight some central questions for future research...|$|R

A brief fling with some American boys, the sons of a US Navy serviceman, led nowhere. The girls committed a number of crimes including arson, which led to their being admitted to Broadmoor Hospital, a high-security mental health hospital. There they remained for 14 years. June later blamed this lengthy sentence to their selective muteness: [...] "'Juvenile delinquents get two years in prison... We got 12 years of hell because we didn't speak... We lost hope, really. I {{wrote a letter to}} the Queen, asking her to get us out. But we were trapped." [...] Placed on high doses of antipsychotic medications, they found themselves unable to concentrate; Jennifer apparently developed tardive dyskinesia (a neurological disorder resulting in involuntary, repetitive movements). Their medications were apparently adjusted sufficiently to allow them to continue the copious diaries they had begun in 1980, and they were able to join the hospital choir, but they lost most of their interest in creative writing.|$|E
5000|$|In {{securities}} lending, securities {{are classified}} by their availability to be borrowed. Highly liquid securities are considered [...] "easy"; {{these products are}} easily found on the market should someone decide to borrow them {{for the purpose of}} selling them short. Securities that are illiquid in the market are classified as [...] "hard". Due to various regulations, a short sale transaction in the United States and some other countries must be preceded by locating the security and quantity that one {{would like to be able}} <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>short</b> in order to avoid naked shorting. However, the lending broker can create a list of securities that do not require such a locate. This list is referred to as an easy-to-borrow (abbreviated as ETB) list, and is also known as blanket assurances. Such a list is generated by broker-dealers based on [...] "reasonable assurance" [...] that the securities on the list are readily available upon customer request. However, if a security on the list cannot be delivered as promised (a [...] "failure to deliver" [...] would occur), the assumption of reasonable grounds no longer applies. In order to provide better grounding for such assumptions, the ETB list must be at most 24 hours old.|$|E
