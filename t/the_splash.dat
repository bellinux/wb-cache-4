40|$|AbstractIn fire scene, {{the reasons}} for <b>the</b> {{formation}} of <b>splashing</b> melted beads are confirmed difficultly for investigators. The paper is studying density distribution characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>splashing</b> melted beads in fire scene. <b>The</b> <b>splashing</b> PSCMB and SSCMB are gotten from experimental lab. After meaturing density of <b>the</b> <b>splashing</b> PSCMB and SSCMB, SPSS analysis software {{was used for the}} analyzing density data of <b>the</b> <b>splashing</b> PSCMB and <b>the</b> <b>splashing</b> SSCMB. This results showed that the density value of splashing PSCMB and splashing SSCMB have a little degree of overlapping. The overlapping scope is 6. 7 - 6. 9. So within the scope, there are 3 PSCMB and there are 2 SSCMB. The ratio is respectively 10 % and 6. 67 %. it is a good discrimination. The results could be used for helping fire investigators distinguishing the shaping reasons of splashing melted beads from fire scenes. This method can be the supplement for the existing appraisal method (ep. Metallographic analysis). And it is practical and effective for distinguishing from <b>the</b> <b>splashing</b> PSCMB and SSCMB...|$|R
40|$|We {{experimentally}} investigate <b>the</b> <b>splashing</b> {{mechanism of}} a millimeter-sized ethanol drop impinging on a structured solid surface, composed of micropillars, through side-view and top-view high-speed imaging. By increasing the impact velocity, we can tune the impact outcome from a gentle deposition to a violent splash, at which tiny droplets are emitted as the liquid sheet spreads laterally. We measure <b>the</b> <b>splashing</b> threshold for different micropatterns {{and find that}} {{the arrangement of the}} pillars significantly affects <b>the</b> <b>splashing</b> outcome. In particular, directional <b>splashing</b> in <b>the</b> direction in which air flows through the pattern is possible. Our top-view observations of impact dynamics reveal that entrapped air is responsible for <b>the</b> <b>splashing.</b> Indeed, by lowering the pressure of the surrounding air we show that we can suppress <b>the</b> <b>splashing</b> in <b>the</b> explored parameter regime. ...|$|R

5|$|Many {{species can}} roll {{themselves}} into a ball, a behaviour used in defence that also conserves moisture. Members of the families Ligiidae and Tylidae, commonly known as rock lice or sea slaters, are the least specialised of the woodlice for life on land.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of drop impact on solid surfaces {{can be changed}} significantly by tuning the elasticity of the solid. Most prominently, the substrate deformation causes an increase in <b>the</b> <b>splashing</b> threshold as compared to impact onto perfectly rigid surfaces, and can thus lead to splash suppression. Here, we experimentally determine <b>the</b> <b>splashing</b> threshold for impact on thin membranes {{as a function of}} the tension in the membrane and its elastic properties. The drop dynamics is correlated to the membrane deformation, which is simultaneously measured using a laser profilometry technique. The experimental results enable us to adapt current models for splashing, showing quantitatively how substrate deformation alters <b>the</b> <b>splashing</b> threshold. Comment: 6 figure...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the impact velocity beyond which the ejection of smaller droplets from <b>the</b> main droplet (<b>splashing)</b> occurs for droplets impacting a smooth surface. We examine {{its dependence on}} the surface wetting properties and droplet surface tension. We show that <b>the</b> <b>splashing</b> velocity is independent of the wetting properties of the surface, but increases roughly linearly with increasing surface tension of the liquid. A preexisting splashing model is considered that predicts <b>the</b> <b>splashing</b> velocity by incorporating the air viscosity. The model is consistent with our data, but the calculation is complex. To address this issue, we propose a simplification, assuming atmospheric conditions and low viscosities, and show that the simplification gives an equally good prediction of <b>the</b> <b>splashing</b> velocity from a simple analytical formula.

5|$|Before its {{purchase}} by the Amon Carter Museum of American Art, The Swimming Hole {{appears to}} have undergone seven different conservatory treatments. It may have been restored prior to its inclusion in Eakins' memorial exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1917. A photograph from that time reveals cracks in the glazes and a drip mark, possibly caused by <b>the</b> <b>splash</b> of a caustic liquid. After the painting was acquired by the Fort Worth Art Association, it was often lent out for exhibitions and was damaged as a result. In 1937 it was relined by a private gallery in New York City and the drip was painted out. In 1944 it was relined and restored and in 1947 it was restored again, both times by a private New York dealer. The Brooklyn Museum performed two minor restorations in 1954 and 1957. Although it continued to travel frequently, The Swimming Hole received no comprehensive treatment until 1993.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{inhabit the}} tropics, {{as well as}} {{temperate}} and boreal waters. A number of species can survive and even flourish in extreme conditions. They are abundant in the Arctic, about 140 species being known from that zone. The Antarctic scallop, Adamussium colbecki, lives under the sea ice {{at the other end}} of the globe, where the subzero temperatures mean that growth rates are very slow. The giant mussel, Bathymodiolus thermophilus, and the giant white clam, Calyptogena magnifica, both live clustered around hydrothermal vents at abyssal depths in the Pacific Ocean. They have chemosymbiotic bacteria in their gills that oxidise hydrogen sulphide, and the molluscs absorb nutrients synthesized by these bacteria. The saddle oyster, Enigmonia aenigmatica, is a marine species that could be considered amphibious. It lives above the high tide mark in the tropical Indo-Pacific on the underside of mangrove leaves, on mangrove branches, and on sea walls in <b>the</b> <b>splash</b> zone.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} few months after the WDWRR opened to the public, Main Street, U.S.A. Station at the Magic Kingdom park's entrance, modeled after the former Victorian-style Saratoga Springs station in Saratoga Springs, New York, was the only stop for {{passengers}} along its route, making only complete round trips possible. On May 1, 1972, the first Frontierland Station opened just northwest of Pecos Bill Tall Tale Inn and Café in the Frontierland section on the park's western edge. It {{was one of the last}} changes made to the WDWRR prior to the retirement of Roger Broggie on October 1, 1973. Frontierland Station was demolished in November 1990 to make way for the new Splash Mountain attraction and was replaced by the current Frontierland Station, which opened in December 1991 just north of the original station site. During construction of <b>the</b> <b>Splash</b> Mountain attraction and the current Frontierland Station, the WDWRR was temporarily renamed Backtrack Express and operated a single train, which only traveled back and forth along the section of track between the Main Street, U.S.A. section and the Mickey's Starland section. Between 1976 and 1977, the Auto-Train Corporation sponsored the WDWRR.|$|E
5|$|The economy {{continued}} in muted form. The three main establishment families on the island, the Moodys, the Sealys, and Kempners, had essentially unrivalled {{control of the}} island. <b>The</b> <b>Splash</b> Day celebrations restarted, drawing tourists to the coast. Many hotels, banks, and some insurance companies remained as did the medical and nursing schools, {{as well as the}} hospitals. Efforts at historical preservation (notably including those of George P. Mitchell) gradually helped to re-establish the island's tourism industry, though in a very different form from the past. Nonbinding referenda were put forward in the 1980s regarding legalization of casinos in the city but were defeated by the voters each time, demonstrating the changes in the city since the bygone era. However informal polls in 2008 and 2010 indicate this sentiment may be changing. Indeed gambling aboard cruise ships leaving from Galveston is now commonplace.|$|E
5|$|They {{held their}} first London gigs {{in support of}} the EP, under the advice of George and The Pooh Sticks lead singer Huw Williams. After warm up gigs in Cardiff and Birmingham, the London {{performance}} took place at the Samuel Beckett pub in Stoke Newington on 13 November 1993 alongside Anrehfn and Margi Clarke. Further Welsh radio and television appearances followed, as did an interview for NME. When George arrived for the interview, Matthews asked if he'd be interested in becoming the band's manager. He politely declined, saying that he didn't have the experience. On the 19 and 20 February 1994, the band's follow-up EP, Hooked was recorded in Llandwrog, Gwynedd, and produced by Ken Nelson who they had met on Radio Wales. A performance was set up at the Falcon <b>the</b> <b>Splash</b> Club in London where several music executives were to be present. The band drove down from Cardiff in a Ford Transit with their equipment and then spent the afternoon drinking. Just prior to going out on stage, they began taking cocaine, the result of which was a terrible performance later lamented by Roberts. The trip became a sobering experience, as they made no money from it and were only paid £50 for a gig at Kingston University a day later. Matthews later recalled that they'd needed to borrow money from a fan to pay the toll on the Severn Bridge {{on the way back to}} Cardiff.|$|E
