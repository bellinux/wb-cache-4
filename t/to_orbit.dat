5|$|The Hollow Moon hypothesis, or Spaceship Moon hypothesis, {{proposes that}} Earth's Moon is either wholly hollow or {{otherwise}} contains a substantial interior space.

5|$|The Moon is in {{synchronous}} rotation: it rotates {{about its}} axis {{in about the}} same time it takes <b>to</b> <b>orbit</b> Earth. This results in it always keeping nearly the same face turned towards Earth. However, due to the effect of libration, about 59% of the Moon's surface can actually be seen from Earth.|$|E
5|$|There are 69 known moons of Jupiter. This gives Jupiter {{the largest}} number of moons with {{reasonably}} stable orbits of any planet in the Solar System. The most massive of the moons are the four Galilean moons, which were independently discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius and were the first objects found <b>to</b> <b>orbit</b> a body that was neither Earth nor the Sun. From the end of the 19th century, dozens of much smaller Jovian moons have been discovered and have received the names of lovers or daughters of the Roman god Jupiter or his Greek equivalent Zeus. The Galilean moons are by far the largest and most massive objects <b>to</b> <b>orbit</b> Jupiter, with the remaining 65 moons and its rings together comprising just 0.003% of the total orbiting mass.|$|E
50|$|As used in {{the space}} program, this refers not <b>to</b> the <b>orbit</b> of the Moon about the Earth, but <b>to</b> <b>orbits</b> by various manned or {{unmanned}} spacecraft around the Moon. The altitude at apoapsis (point farthest from the surface) for a lunar orbit is known as apolune, apocynthion or aposelene, while the periapsis (point closest to the surface) is known as perilune, pericynthion or periselene, from names or epithets of the moon goddess.|$|R

5|$|There are exoplanets {{that are}} much closer to their parent star than any planet in the Solar System is to the Sun, {{and there are also}} exoplanets {{that are much}} farther from their star. Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun at 0.4 AU, takes 88-days for an orbit, but the {{shortest}} known orbits for exoplanets take only a few hours, e.g. Kepler-70b. The Kepler-11 system has five of its planets in shorter orbits than Mercury's, all of them much more massive than Mercury. Neptune is 30 AU from the Sun and takes 165 years <b>to</b> <b>orbit,</b> but there are exoplanets that are hundreds of AU from their star and take more than a thousand years <b>to</b> <b>orbit,</b> e.g. 1RXS1609 b.|$|E
5|$|Adrastea {{is one of}} the few moons in the Solar System known <b>to</b> <b>orbit</b> its {{planet in}} less than the length of that planet's day. It orbits at the edge of Jupiter's Main Ring and is thought to be the main {{contributor}} of material to the Rings of Jupiter. Despite observations made in the 1990s by the Galileo spacecraft, very little is known about the moon's physical characteristics other than its size and the fact that it is tidally locked to Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Adrastea is the {{smallest}} and second-closest member of the inner Jovian satellite family. It orbits Jupiter at a radius of about 129,000km (1.806Jupiter radii) at the exterior edge of the planet's Main Ring. Adrastea {{is one of only}} three moons in the Solar System known <b>to</b> <b>orbit</b> its planet in less than the length of that planet's day—the other two being Jupiter's innermost moon Metis, and Mars' moon Phobos. The orbit has very small eccentricity and inclination—around 0.0015 and 0.03°, respectively. Inclination is relative to the equator of Jupiter.|$|E

40|$|An {{analytical}} method for studying characteristics of frozen orbits using mean orbital elements is presented. By removing {{some of the}} approximations of Brouwer and Kosai (1959) and using the method of integration by parts, an analytic solution is obtained accurate to the second order {{in the sense of}} expansion of the perturbing potential of an aspherical approximation. The solution applies <b>to</b> <b>orbits</b> at and near the critical inclination as well as <b>to</b> frozen <b>orbits</b> and, of course, <b>to</b> unfrozen <b>orbits.</b> The analysis reveals that a frozen orbit can be interpreted as an orbit in which movements of the long-periodic part of the rate of change of periapsis cancels the secular part exactly at any time...|$|R
5|$|Another {{possible}} {{mechanism for}} the formation of planetesimals is the streaming instability in which the drag felt by particles orbiting through gas creates a feedback effect causing the growth of local concentrations. These local concentration push back on the gas creating a region where the headwind felt by the particles is smaller. The concentration is thus able <b>to</b> <b>orbit</b> faster and undergoes less radial drift. Isolated particles join these concentrations as they are overtaken or as they drift inward causing it to grow in mass. Eventually these concentrations form massive filaments which fragment and undergo gravitational collapse forming planetesimals the size of the larger asteroids.|$|E
5|$|Capella A {{consists}} of two yellow evolved stars that have been calculated <b>to</b> <b>orbit</b> each other every 104 days with a separation of around 100 million km. The pair is a non-eclipsing binary—that is, as seen from Earth, neither star passes {{in front of the}} other. The orbit is known extremely accurately and can be used to derive an orbital parallax with far better precision than the one measured directly. The stars are not near enough to each other for the Roche lobe of either star to have been filled and any significant mass transfer to have taken place, even during the red giant stage of the primary star.|$|E
5|$|For {{a stable}} orbit the ratio between the moon's orbital period Ps around its primary {{and that of}} the primary around its star Pp must be < 1/9, e.g. if a planet takes 90 days <b>to</b> <b>orbit</b> its star, the maximum stable orbit for a moon of that planet is less than 10 days. Simulations suggest that a moon with an orbital period less than about 45 to 60 days will remain safely bound to a massive giant planet or brown dwarf that orbits 1 AU from a Sun-like star. In the case of Gliese 876 b, the orbital period would have to be no greater than a week (7 days) {{in order to have a}} stable orbit.|$|E
