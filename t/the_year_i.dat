It was ratified by public referendum, but normal legal processes were suspended before it could take effect.|$|E

But so far I have been dead wrong. Even if prices should rise, moreover, the terrible timing of my purchase has cost Berkshire several billion dollars.|$|E

500|$|The {{accepted}} cover, {{designed by}} Aimee Macauley, features {{a photo of}} Nas as a child superimposed over a backdrop of a New York city block, taken by Danny Clinch. In a 1994 interview, Nas discussed the concept behind the photo of him at age 7, stating [...] "That was <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>I</b> started to acknowledge everything [...] That's the year everything set off. That's <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>I</b> started seeing the future for myself and doing what was right. The ghetto makes you think. The world is ours. I used to think I couldn't leave my projects. I used to think if I left, if anything happened to me, I {{thought it would be}} no justice or I would be just a dead slave or something. The projects used to be my world until I educated myself to see there's more out there." [...] As yet, Nas has not pointed to any outside influence for the artwork of his album cover. Yet according to Ego Trip, the cover of Illmatic is [...] "reputedly" [...] believed to have been inspired by a jazz album, Howard Hanger Trio's A Child Is Born (1974) [...] whose cover also features a photograph of a child, superimposed on an urban landscape.|$|E
500|$|Del Potro's {{first half}} of the season was {{hampered}} by injuries and a change of coach, starting with a first-round loss in Adelaide, where he was the seventh seed. He then made it to {{the second round of the}} Australian Open in January, only to retire against David Ferrer due to an injury. Del Potro returned to the circuit in March, winning his first match against Jesse Levine at the Sony Ericsson Open, before losing in the second round to López. Struggling with injuries, his ranking fell as low as no. 81 in April. [...] "At the start of <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> <b>I</b> was playing good, but I had many injuries, many problems with my body, with my physique", said del Potro. [...] "I changed my coach, changed my physical trainer, I changed everything." ...|$|E

He was defeated by Tomáš Berdych in the final. At the Madrid Masters, he lost in the quarterfinals in straight sets to Roger Federer. He reached the semifinals of his next tournament, the Davidoff Swiss Indoors, before losing to countryman Nalbandian. He was beaten by Nalbandian again in his next tournament, {{this time it was}} {{in the second round of}} the Paris Masters. Del Potro blamed fatigue for his defeat, [...] "It's difficult to play the last tournament of <b>the</b> <b>year.</b> <b>I</b> was tired, my mind was in Argentina [...] ". This left del Potro's qualification for the 2008 Tennis Masters Cup out of his hands; fortunately for him, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga beat James Blake in the semifinals, which was enough to ensure his place at the year-end event.|$|E

500|$|In March 2016, some users also {{alleged that}} their Windows 7 and 8.1 devices had {{automatically}} begun upgrading to 10 without their consent. In June 2016, the GWX dialog's behavior changed to make closing the window imply a consent to a scheduled upgrade. Despite this, an Infoworld editor disputed the claims that upgrades had begun without any consent at all; testing {{showed that the}} upgrade to Windows10 would only begin once the user accepts the end-user license agreement (EULA) presented by its installer, and that not doing so would eventually cause Windows Update to time out with an error, thus halting the installation attempt. It was concluded that these users may have unknowingly clicked the [...] "Accept" [...] prompt without full knowledge that this would begin the upgrade. In December 2016, Microsoft chief marketing officer Chris Capossela admitted {{that the company had}} [...] "gone too far", by using this tactic, stating that [...] "we know we want people to be running Windows 10 from a security perspective, but finding the right balance where you’re not stepping over the line of being too aggressive is something we tried and for a lot of <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>I</b> think we got it right." ...|$|E

He's one of the nicest persons in the world. And I tell him, 'Hey, I thought your lyrics, Van Dyke, were brilliant, except who the fuck knows what you're talking about!' That's exactly how I talk to him (laughs). And he and I joke about it." [...] He considers that [...] "a lot of people don't understand I {{have a sense of humor}} that's kind of wack, or different, or sometimes bratty, so I get labeled with that and there goes my image, right down the toilet." ...|$|E
500|$|Kahn {{said that}} the entire idea for the video was Brown's: [...] "It's an {{interesting}} video for me, because it's so rare that music videos ever try to achieve anything emotional. Chris just basically {{told me a story}} of what he felt this video was going to be, with his heart glowing and how he's, like, cold. It is a very personal story. But it's told in such a graphic manner that I {{fell in love with the}} idea. It's Chris' story. Period. I am the pencil that put it down on the paper." [...] When comparing the song's video to that of [...] "I Can Transform Ya", the director said, [...] "'Crawl' is my favorite one, because — gosh, I'm going to let you in on this — 'cause it's probably his most personal thing he's ever done." [...] He went on to say, [...] "I mean, everything that's happened to him in <b>the</b> <b>year,</b> <b>I</b> think this is going to be his big statement, in terms of what he's feeling and what he's living through right now." [...] When talking about the ideas and concepts of the video, Kahn {{said that the}} video, his first ballad with Brown, should speak for itself through the ideas that he had and the [...] "genesis" [...] of what that idea was.|$|E

2500|$|The Feast of Neyrouz {{marks the}} first day of the Coptic year. Ignorant of the Persian {{language}} for the most part, the Arabs confused the Egyptian new year's celebrations, which the Egyptians called the feast of Ni-Yarouou (the feast of the rivers), with the Persian feast of Nowruz. The misnomer remains today, and the celebrations of the Egyptian new year on {{the first day of}} the month of Thout are known as the Neyrouz. Its celebration falls on the 1st day of the month of Thout, the first month of the Egyptian year, which for 1901 to 2098 usually coincides with 11 September, except before a Gregorian leap year when it is 12 September. Coptic years are counted from 284, the year Diocletian became Roman Emperor, whose reign was marked by tortures and mass executions of Christians, especially in Egypt. Hence, the Coptic year is identified by the abbreviation A.M. (for Anno Martyrum or [...] "Year of the Martyrs"). The first day of <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>I</b> of the Coptic era was 29 August 284 in the Julian calendar. Note that A.M. abbreviation is also used for unrelated calendar eras (such as the Byzantine and Jewish calendar epochs) which start at the putative creation of the world; it then stands for Anno Mundi.|$|E

Only his brother Mahmoud, who was a thirty years old single and worker at the ministry of Justice, decided to invest in his brother's education. Thanks to his support and aid, Bourguiba enrolled in Lycée Carnot of Tunis. Bourguiba stated in 1973 the reasons his brother supported him: [...] "As for [...] "si" [...] Mahmoud, I had forgotten to tell you that <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>I</b> passed my certificat d'études primaires and lost my mother, he had just left Sadiki where he was an intern. He was in classe de seconde. I lived, myself in Tourbet El Bey. Every Friday and Sunday of every week, he came home to teach me. But he used, during his task, an unpreceeded brutality and savagery. He was in such a furry that he beat me like plaster. I was still not ten and my fear was so intense that I could not even focus or understand tasks that he asked me. Each time, panicked, the cleaning woman rushed to the window and cried for help. I was severely traumatized and I still wonder today how such a scandalous treatment has not finally overcame my intelligence and thirst for knowledge [...] He had indeed redeemed himself".|$|E
