5|$|In {{an attempt}} to halt <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> assault, Luat ordered two squadrons of M-113 {{armoured}} personnel carriers to confront the enemy at Nga Sau, but {{they were forced to}} turn back by tanks from <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> 3rd Tank Battalion, 273rd Armoured Regiment. At around 5:30pm, a South Vietnamese ranger battalion was forced to abandon the nearby installation at Dac Lac after continuous assaults from the 95B Regiment. In the northeast, the South Vietnamese 9th Ranger Battalion held off <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> 95B Regiment until they abandoned their positions on the next day. In the western outskirts of Ban Me Thuot, eight A-37 Dragonfly bombers from the South Vietnamese 6th Air Force Division inflicted light casualties on <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> 24th Regiment, but failed to stop their enemies’ momentum. In the southwest, Quang tried to retake Mai Hac De by mobilising his reserve units with tactical air support. Meanwhile, in the south-eastern end of Ban Me Thuot, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> 149th Regiment defeated the South Vietnamese 53rd Infantry Regiment, after they sustained heavy casualties from repeated air attacks from A-37 bombers.|$|E
5|$|While the Republic of Vietnam Air Force was {{transporting}} the 23rd Infantry Division to the battlefield, their airbase at Cu Hanh {{was subjected}} to artillery bombardment from <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> 968th Infantry Division. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> Central Highlands Front had anticipated the South Vietnamese military's movements, so they built up their forces in and around Ban Me Thuot {{to prepare for a}} South Vietnamese counter-attack. On March 13, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> 24th and 28th Regiments received two companies of armoured vehicles and one artillery battalion, which had begun raining artillery shells on Phuoc An. At 7:07am on March 14, even before the ARVN 44th and 45th Infantry Regiments began their combat operations, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> 24th Regiment opened fire and attacked the South Vietnamese, with support from the 273rd Armoured Regiment.|$|E
5|$|By {{the evening}} of March 25, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> had secured all major points {{surrounding}} Huế, and South Vietnamese units that failed to escape were completely surrounded. Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> claimed to have captured large numbers of South Vietnamese prisoners and military hardware. In all, a total of 58,722 South Vietnamese soldiers became prisoners of war, with one colonel and 18 lieutenant-colonels amongst the ranks, as well as about 14,000 South Vietnamese government officials and employees, who reported to <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> military authorities.

During several hours of fighting the outnumbered South Koreans defeated their enemies who left {{more than one hundred}} bodies on the battlefield. Meanwhile, USAF jet fighters opened fire on a pair of South Vietnamese villages, which they mistakenly believed were Vietcong camps. The resulting attack left 63 people dead and at least 100 more wounded.|$|R
5|$|Earlier in the day, {{at about}} 2:30pm, South Vietnamese Colonel Trinh Tieu, Chief of the ARVN 2nd Brigade in II Corps, {{discovered}} that <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> 316th Infantry Division {{had moved into}} positions south of Ban Me Thuot from their base in Laos. To stop them from advancing any further, Phu ordered his soldiers to destroy every bridge connected to Highway 14. By the time Phu’s order was carried out, elements of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> 316th Infantry Division had engaged in clashes with the South Vietnamese for more than 10 hours. By 5pm <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> 8th Battalion, 149th Regiment, {{in combination with the}} 198th Special Forces Regiment, tried but failed to capture Hoa Binh airfield, which was defended by one South Vietnamese ranger battalion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} phase of their operation, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> and Viet Cong would cut off Da Nang from the {{surrounding}} regions which made up I Corps Tactical Zone, and prevent reinforcements from retaking the city. Then, depending on the situation, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> would organize an attack to capture the major South Vietnamese army, navy and air force installations in Da Nang.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} option, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> could avoid the {{outlying}} South Vietnamese installations and strike directly at their primary target of Ban Me Thuot. For the first option to be successful, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> had to secure Highways 14, 19, and 21 to isolate Ban Me Thuot, and stop potential South Vietnamese reinforcements. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> favoured the first option, {{because it would}} give the ARVN 23rd Infantry Division and other support units little or no time to respond. At the same time, the first option would have enabled a quick victory without inflicting large-scale damage on the civilian population of Ban Me Thuot.|$|E

5|$|Sabo {{then began}} redistributing {{ammunition}} to {{other members of}} the platoon, including stripping ammunition from wounded and dead comrades. As night fell <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> refocused their efforts from wiping out the American force to harassing the helicopters that were carrying more than two dozen wounded soldiers. As that was occurring, the remaining platoon from Bravo Company broke through <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> lines and relieved the other two platoons while the first medical helicopter arrived and loaded two wounded soldiers under heavy fire. Sabo again stepped out into the open and provided covering fire for the helicopter until his ammunition was exhausted. He received several serious wounds under heavy fire by <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> while trying to reload. Although mortally wounded, Sabo crawled forward toward the enemy emplacement, pulled the pin of a grenade, and threw it at the last possible second toward an enemy bunker. The resulting explosion silenced the enemy bunker at the cost of Sabo's life. In all, seven {{other members of the}} platoon were killed in this ambush and another 28 were wounded. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> forces lost 49.|$|E
5|$|Stung by that devastating defeat, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> Air Force {{grounded}} their fighter force {{several times}} between June and August 1967, {{in order to}} work on their training and tactics.

5|$|A second regimental-sized {{attack against}} 3 RAR at Balmoral was {{launched}} by <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> at 02:30 on 28 May, with a two-battalion assault preceded by 60mm and 80mm mortar {{fire from the}} south. Meanwhile, FSB Coral was also attacked by indirect fire from 02:45. Similar to the attack two nights before, it began with another feint from the south as <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> sappers blew up the wire in front of A Company, but was successfully broken up before it reached the wire by the Australian defenders with claymore mines and small-arms fire from their M60 machine-guns, L1A1 Self Loading Rifles and M16 assault rifles. The main assault began at 03:10 from the north-east, with the brunt again being borne by Phillips' D Company. The Australian infantrymen were once again supported by tanks firing canister shot and machine-guns, while artillery and mortars provided continuous close indirect fires, with the combined effect of this firepower stopping <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> on the wire before they could penetrate the position. Although the assault was well co-ordinated, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> had lost the element of surprise, with the preparatory fire once more alerting the defenders. The assault was subsequently called off after 30 minutes, while at 03:40 a small probe developed from the east but quickly dissipated. Sporadic mortar and rocket fire continued to fall as helicopter light-fire teams and C-47 Spooky gunships engaged <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese,</b> directed by forward air control aircraft. From 05:00 until first light artillery from FSB Coral provided continuous battlefield illumination to stymie North Vietnamese attempts to clear their dead and wounded, and they finally withdrew by 05:30.|$|E

5|$|At 2am on March 10, 1975, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> army {{began their}} assault on South Vietnamese forces at Ban Me Thuot. <b>The</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> 198th Special Forces Regiment spearheaded the attack by hitting the Hoa Binh Airfield, the {{district}} of Mai Hac De, and {{the headquarters of the}} ARVN 53rd Infantry Regiment. The initial North Vietnamese attack, which was marked by heavy artillery bombardment and actions initiated by the 198th Special Forces Regiment, had shocked ARVN Colonels Nguyen Trong Luat and Vu The Quang, both subordinates of Major General Pham Van Phu. Despite the strength of the initial assault, Quang believed <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> only wanted to cause disruption and would withdraw their forces by daybreak. By 3:30am, the 4th Battalion, 198th Special Forces Regiment, had successfully secured Phan Chu Trinh Road and the southern part of Hoa Binh airport, and they waited there for the regular infantry and tank units to arrive.|$|E
5|$|At {{positions}} west of Hill 881 South {{and north}} of Co Roc Ridge, {{across the border in}} Laos, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> established artillery, rocket, and mortar positions from which to launch attacks by fire on the base and to support its ground operations. The NVA 130mm and 152mm artillery pieces, and 122mm rockets, had a longer range than the Marine artillery support which consisted of 105mm and 155mm howitzers. This range overmatch was used by <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> to avoid counter-battery fire. They were assisted in their emplacement efforts by the continuing bad weather of the winter monsoon.|$|E
5|$|At the {{opposite}} end of the camp, three North Vietnamese PT-76 tanks rolled through the barbed-wire barrier in front of Company 102 and 103. From point blank, North Vietnamese tank crews destroyed several bunkers with their guns, forcing the soldiers of Company 102 and 103 to abandon their positions. Those who survived the onslaught either retreated to the reconnaissance positions, or along Highway 9, toward Khe Sanh in the east. About 800 meters to the west, Sergeant First Class Charles W. Lindewald, an adviser to the Mobile Strike Force, also reported back to Willoughby that the early warning outpost was in danger of being overrun. To save it, Lindewald directed artillery strikes on <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> troops moving up towards his outpost, but he later died from a gunshot wound to the stomach as <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> overran the outpost. At about 01:30, Shungel and his hastily organized tank-killer teams were busy engaging <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> tanks that were roaming the Company 104 area; on many occasions the M-72 rockets fired by the Americans either missed completely, jammed, misfired, or simply failed to knock out the enemy tanks. By 02:30, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> had broken through the inner perimeter of the camp, and began harassing the soldiers trapped inside the tactical operations center, which included Willoughby along with seven other Americans, three South Vietnamese special forces, and 26 CIDG soldiers.|$|E

5|$|Following their {{defeat at}} the hands of <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> Air Force, Colonel Robin Olds learned that Seventh Air Force {{intelligence}} had watched North Vietnamese MiG fighters practicing their new tactics for ten days prior to the battle of 23 August, but had not passed that information on to the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing and other units. Thus, it soon became clear to U.S commanders that the reason <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> repeatedly stood down their fighter force was because they were working on their new tactic. In the first half of 1967, <b>the</b> <b>North</b> <b>Vietnamese</b> had realized they could not directly confront U.S. fighters in air-to-air combat, so they changed their procedures for the deployment of their numerically inferior MiG units.
