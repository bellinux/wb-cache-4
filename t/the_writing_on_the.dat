25|$|O'Connor's own {{politics}} were liberal.

Although Bunker was famous for his malapropisms of the English language, O'Connor was highly educated and cultured and was an English professor before he turned to acting.|$|E
25|$|Reviewers {{have pointed}} out that the show {{effectively}} utilizes a number of cinematic techniques common in horror film.

In it, author Hannes Artens portrays a global depression {{as a result of}} the oil price shooting past $140 per barrel and depicts the falsity of thinking that limited aerial strikes on Iran will end the problem. The story shows them eventually leading to a ground invasion and a military draft in the United States. The book ends with the Iran war escalating into a conflagration seizing the entire Middle East and ultimately culminates in a nuclear showdown between Pakistan and India after an Islamist coup in Pakistan.|$|E
25|$|Mandy, Whitworth's step-mother, {{reported}} the Police knocking {{on her door}} to inform her they had found Daniel's body. She says she was led to believe Daniel had overdosed on drugs, despite no investigation having taken place. Police didn't treat the death as suspicious, despite bruising found under Daniel's arms, {{which led to a}} coroner reporting that third-party involvement could not be ruled out. The Police took the fake suicide note left by Port with Daniel's body at face-value. They sent a small fragment of the letter to Mandy and Daniel's father, Adam, asking them to verify if it was Daniel's penmanship. They looked at <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> note and compared it with Daniel's writing from Birthday cards and other mementos. They reported back to the Police saying they were unsure if it was Daniel's writing, as they didn't often see his handwriting and they couldn't say for certain. Mandy reported that Dagenham Police had told her they had experts who can analyse the writing and determine whether it is Daniel's or not, and Mandy assumed this is what the Police would do. It is later shown at trial that Dagenham Police documented that Mandy and Adam had confirmed the handwriting was Daniel's, despite them telling the Police they were unsure. It came to light that handwriting professionals had not investigated the note, but that untrained Police Officers had 'taken a look' at the note themselves. Mandy maintains that if specialists had looked further into this note, they could have found Port earlier.|$|E
