500|$|... the indie {{rock band}} Guillemots have {{recorded}} more than 80 songs for their four studio albums and other official releases. The band {{was formed in}} November 2004, with their first official material being I Saw Such <b>Things</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Sleep, an extended play (EP) released in September 2005. The EP contained four songs, including [...] "Made-Up Lovesong #43", a track that would also feature on their first studio album, Through the Windowpane. The release of I Saw Such <b>Things</b> <b>in</b> <b>My</b> Sleep was followed three months later by Guillemots' debut single, [...] "Trains to Brazil". Like [...] "Made-Up Lovesong #43", it was also included on Through the Windowpane, which was released in July 2006. The album's songs were well received by critics: review aggregator Metacritic gave the record a score of 81 out of 100, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". Craig McLean of The Observer described them as [...] "gorgeous tunes that are lithe enough {{to cope with the}} little bursts of sonic madness". Two additional tracks were released as singles from the album: [...] "We're Here" [...] and [...] "Annie, Let's Not Wait".|$|E
500|$|After Howe's {{first year}} in Halifax, {{engineering}} instruction of upperclassmen was taken away from Dalhousie and other universities in the province, {{and placed in a}} separate technical institute in which Howe had no role. Howe later stated that he liked Dalhousie, and had this change not occurred, he might have remained there as a professor. In 1913, however, a former colleague at Dalhousie, Robert Magill, who had recently been appointed chairman of the Board of Grain Commissioners, offered Howe the post of chief engineer, with responsibility for supervising the construction of grain elevators. Howe stated, [...] "I've never seen one of those <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life, but I'll take the job." [...] The same year, he applied to become a British subject, as Canadians then were.|$|E
500|$|In {{the fall}} of 2009, Meissner moved back to Maryland. Chris Conte became her coach and also choreographed ice show {{programs}} for her. Meissner {{had been assigned to}} the 2009 Rostelecom Cup and the 2009 NHK Trophy for the Grand Prix season. She announced her withdrawal from both events on October 8, 2009 due to an injury to her right knee. Due to this, she did not receive a bye to the 2010 U.S. Championships and was too late to register to compete at the regional championships, thereby ending her season. She did not return to amateur competition. Commenting in July 2016, she said, [...] "The injury wasn't devastating, but <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> personal life all happened at the same time." ...|$|E

500|$|Cisneros says of this moment: So to me {{it began}} there, and that's when I {{intentionally}} started writing about all the <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> culture that were different from them—the poems that are these city voices—the first part of Wicked Wicked Ways—and the stories in House on Mango Street. I think it's ironic {{that at the moment}} when I was practically leaving an institution of learning, I began realizing in which ways institutions had failed me. Drawing on Mexican and Southwestern popular culture and conversations in the city streets, Cisneros wrote to convey the lives of people she identified with. Literary critic Jacqueline Doyle has described Cisneros's passion for hearing the personal stories that people tell and her commitment to expressing the voices of marginalized people through her work, such as the [...] "thousands of silent women" [...] whose struggles are portrayed in The House on Mango Street.|$|E
500|$|Tyler next {{appeared}} in Armageddon (1998), where {{she played the}} daughter of Bruce Willis' character and love interest of Ben Affleck's character. The film generated mixed reviews, {{but it was a}} box office success, earning $553million worldwide. The movie included the songs [...] "I Don't Want to Miss a Thing" [...] and [...] "What Kind of Love Are You On" [...] by Aerosmith. In a 2001 interview with The Guardian, she said that she initially turned down the role in Armageddon; [...] "I really didn't want to do it at first and I turned it down a couple of times, but the biggest reason I changed my mind was because I was scared of it. I wanted to try it for that very reason. I mean, I'm not really in this to do amazing <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> career – I just want it to be special when I make a movie." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)" [...] is an {{alternative}} rock song that lasts for three minutes and 41 seconds. According to the digital music sheet published at Musicnotes.com, the song is composed in the key of G minor and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute, while Lohan's vocal range spans from F3 to D5. When asked about the lyrical content of the song, Lohan revealed, [...] "A lot of people go through family issues, abuse {{and that kind of}} thing. I think it's important to show that other people go through it. [...] I hope [...] see what I say in the song is, 'I love you,' so many times, that I need him and the crazy <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life. I hope he sees the positive side of the video rather than the negative. The video is kind of offensive, but it is very raw. He's my father. I need someone to walk me down the aisle when I get married." [...] The single's b-side, [...] "My Innocence", features a similar message to Lohan's father.|$|E

500|$|The German {{invasion}} of Norway in 1940 led to Andersen's life once more taking a turn into illegal activities. His furniture workshop {{was used as}} a weapons depot by the Norwegian resistance movement, and he took part in looting German military stores. He was first arrested by the Germans after he had responded to rumours that he was a Nazi by writing the Norwegian national socialist party Nasjonal Samling's official publication Fritt Folk and stating that [...] "although I have done many wrong <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life, a Nazi I am not. Yours sincerely Johs. S. Andersen". The letter was published unedited by the newspaper, although Andersen was later arrested by the occupying authorities and sentenced to one year in prison, after spending half a year in detention. Using techniques he had learned during his earlier criminal career, Andersen managed to be transferred to prison hospital during his time in detention. While there he acquired false x-ray images and tuberculosis germs to fake illnesses in other captured resistance men who {{were on their way to}} interrogation. He also infected a German interrogator with malaria by contaminating his insulin. At night, he would sneak out of the hospital and operate in Oslo, amongst other activities breaking into Nasjonal Samling offices and stealing documents, copying them and having them shipped to the United Kingdom together with evidence of torture in Nazi-run prisons. He served the last part of his sentence in Fuhlsbüttel near Hamburg, Germany. [...] His wife was also active in resistance work, dealing with propaganda and espionage. Author Egil Ulateig doubts the veracity of Andersen's prison exploits, which are based mostly on Andersen's own testimony.|$|E

I split the flesh on my wrist with a box opener, {{painting}} the floor of my bedroom with blood I shouldn't have spilt. After sitting there for what seemed like hours (which apparently was only minutes), I had the revelation that this was not the path. It was my dicision (sic) to seek medical treatment, as on the other hand I could have chose to sit there until enough blood drained from my downward lascerations on my wrists to die." ...|$|E
2500|$|Martin co-produced Blonde with Montreal's Howard Bilerman, {{known for}} his {{previous}} work with Arcade Fire and Basia Bulat, and recorded {{all but one of}} the album's songs in his Montreal studio, Hotel2Tango. She chose to work with Bilerman based on his experience with folk music, and though her album [...] "didn't turn out that way" [...] she praised him for [...] " [...] <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> songs that other people don’t see". In addition, Martin worked with Edmonton singer-songwriter Michael Rault in order to achieve a more [...] "sixties sound". The album production was praised for [...] "hold back" [...] on arrangements and not going [...] "over-the-top orchestral" [...] on the tracks [...] "Cap-Diamant" [...] and [...] "Place de la République".|$|E

2500|$|... "Drumchapel is {{a housing}} estate just outside Glasgow. Well, it's in Glasgow, but just outside civilisation," [...] he has joked. [...] "To be quite honest, I quite liked it when I lived there. When I moved to Drumchapel, I was {{fourteen}} {{and there was}} a bluebell wood there, and it was in great condition then— I don't think it's in quite so good condition now— but it was lovely then. We had rabbits and pheasants, and I really quite liked it. I just started to dislike it when I got older, into my teens and <b>things.</b> <b>In</b> <b>my</b> late teens, when I was stuck out there, it cost me {{a lot of money to}} go anyplace. It was a kind of cowboy town, but I liked that aspect of it, buying stuff out of vans, a ragman coming in a wee green van." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 1984, {{at least}} two informers {{reported}} to authorities on the first abortive plot to bomb Air India Flight 182, which flew out of Montreal's Mirabel International Airport at that time. In August 1984, the known criminal Gerry Boudreault claimed that Talwinder Parmar showed him a suitcase stuffed with $200,000, payment to plant a bomb. He decided, [...] "I had done some bad <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> time, done my time in jail, but putting a bomb on a plane ... not me. I went to the police." [...] In September, {{in an attempt to}} get his sentence for theft and fraud reduced, Harmail Singh Grewal of Vancouver told the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) of the plot to bomb the flight from Montreal. Both reports were dismissed as unreliable.|$|E
2500|$|Although Norwood {{received}} a sole writing credit on album cut [...] "Finally" [...] only, she noted Afrodisiac the most honest effort {{of her career}} yet based on its deeply autobiographical content, commenting: [...] "Everything I do {{has something to do}} with what I've gone through in my life [...] I definitely wanted to incorporate that in my art. It makes it more real when you add what's been going on in your life in your music. I've grown and I've gone through some <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life, and I celebrate that, I honor that." [...] Soundwise, her collaboration with Timbaland, recent motherhood, life experiences, and growing affinity toward alternative music such as Coldplay, caused Norwood to shift toward a more matured outlook and raw nature with the album, a venture into the organic sounds of soul blues, ambient music, and the nostalgic street-wise sound of 1990’s hip-hop.|$|E

2500|$|Sebastian {{wrote about}} his time {{recording}} in Memphis {{in a series}} of blogs in Australian newspapers. [...] "I started recording four days ago with the band members from Booker T and the MGs. And in the four days, we cut 15 tracks. It's been such a great experience to watch these guys work. [...] I would show them which song I wanted to record. After listening to any changes I had, we would all go into the live room. Everyone would hop to their instruments I'd hop in the vocal booth. We would just hit record button without a rehearsal and everyone would nail it nearly every time." [...] Cropper later spoke on AllMemphisMusic about working with Sebastian. [...] "Needless to say I've done a lot of <b>things</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> career, had a lot of fun, but we had more fun working with this young guy who just sings the rings around everything. [...] this kid came into Memphis, and just blew everybody's socks off. He had the grit and the grime and the soul of Otis Redding, and he had the sweet soul of Al Green, he had the wonderful sweet church sound of Sam Cooke, and he just took us by storm." ...|$|E
