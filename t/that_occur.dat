30|$|The {{incipient}} droughts <b>that</b> <b>occurred</b> {{during the}} wintering {{period of the}} winter wheat growth helped to increase the winter wheat yield, while the mild droughts <b>that</b> <b>occurred</b> during the maturity stage of winter wheat resulted in a reduction of yield. The mild droughts <b>that</b> <b>occurred</b> during the filling and maturity period {{had a significant effect}} on the yield of winter wheat. The moderate droughts <b>that</b> <b>occurred</b> during the flowering, filling, and maturity periods of the winter wheat growth {{had a significant impact on}} yield. In addition, the water shortage due to droughts <b>that</b> <b>occurred</b> during the seeding period in autumn also affected the production of winter wheat, and that is particularly true for the severe and extreme droughts <b>that</b> <b>occurred</b> during the seeding period. With some exception of the occurrence of droughts of certain intensities during some specific growth stages of winter wheat, droughts of higher intensities had greater impacts on winter wheat yield during the critical growth stages.|$|R
5|$|The {{risks and}} {{complications}} related to implant therapy divide into those <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> during surgery (such as excessive bleeding or nerve injury), those <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> {{in the first}} six months (such as infection and failure to osseointegrate) and those <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> long-term (such as peri-implantitis and mechanical failures). In the presence of healthy tissues, a well-integrated implant with appropriate biomechanical loads can have 5-year plus survival rates from 93 to 98 percent and 10 to 15 year lifespans for the prosthetic teeth. Long-term studies show a 16- to 20-year success (implants surviving without complications or revisions) between 52% and 76%, with complications occurring up to 48% of the time.|$|E

5|$|Discontinuation of benzodiazepines or abrupt {{reduction}} of the dose, even after a relatively short course of treatment (three to four weeks), may result in two groups of symptoms—rebound and withdrawal.

Withdrawal symptoms are the new symptoms <b>that</b> <b>occur</b> when the benzodiazepine is stopped. They are the main sign of physical dependence.|$|E
50|$|In {{his early}} {{statistics}} textbooks, Smith cited a study claiming that famous people can postpone death {{until after the}} celebration of their birthdays.

5|$|Mucinous, clear {{secretions}} may collect {{within these}} cysts to form either spherical masses or fusiform swellings, rarely larger than 2 to 3cm in diameter.
