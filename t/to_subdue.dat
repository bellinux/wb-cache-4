5|$|During {{the mating}} season rival males may compete by wrestling, not by biting. Opponents attempt <b>to</b> <b>subdue</b> {{each other by}} intertwining their bodies and raising their heads high off the ground. Observers have on {{occasion}} mistaken such wrestling for mating.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to epitheliomuscular, nerve and interstitial cells, the inward-facing gastroderm ("stomach skin") contains gland cells that secrete digestive enzymes.

5|$|It {{was clear}} that Edward now {{regarded}} the struggle not as a war between two nations, but as the suppression of a rebellion of disloyal subjects. This brutality, though, rather than helping <b>to</b> <b>subdue</b> the Scots, had the opposite effect, and rallied growing support for Bruce.|$|E
5|$|The British naval command was {{continually}} {{frustrated by}} the use of Machias as a staging point for militia actions in Nova Scotia. Samuel Graves ordered Sir George Collier to destroy Machias in 1777. Graves attempted <b>to</b> <b>subdue</b> Machias multiple times, but had no success.|$|E
5|$|Atrocities {{continued}} {{during the}} German retreat from Southern France as German soldiers plundered and burned down towns. French civilians were brought before ad-hoc military courts {{and sentenced to}} death because of alleged partisan activities. These atrocities did not help <b>to</b> <b>subdue</b> the French uprising. Instead, the German reprisals had the opposite effect and encouraged the French population to engage in partisan fighting.|$|E

Compared <b>to</b> <b>subdued</b> Brazilian telenovelas, Mexican soaps are considered tacky and exaggerated.|$|R

5|$|Despite Ravana's faults, Mandodari {{loves him}} and {{is proud of}} his strength. She is aware of Ravana's {{weakness}} towards women. A righteous woman, Mandodari tries to lead Ravana to righteousness, but Ravana always ignores her advice. She advises him to not <b>to</b> <b>subdue</b> the Navagraha, the nine celestial beings that govern one's destiny, and not to seduce Vedavati, who would be reborn as Sita and cause the destruction of Ravana.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the rapid}} secessions of Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas, Congress began {{preparing}} {{the nation for}} war, including by strengthening the army and navy and raising funds for the treasury. Burnett attempted to circumvent these measures by proposing an amendment stipulating {{that none of these}} new appropriations could be used <b>to</b> <b>subdue</b> or make war against any of the southern states, but the amendment was defeated.|$|E
5|$|From time to {{time the}} Spanish {{launched}} punitive military expeditions against the Lakandons to try to stabilise the northern frontier of the Guatemalan colony; the largest expeditions took place in 1685 and 1695. Repeated expeditions into the Lacandon Forest succeeded in destroying some villages but did not manage <b>to</b> <b>subdue</b> {{the inhabitants of the}} region, nor bring it within the Spanish Empire. This successful resistance against Spanish attempts at domination served to attract ever more Indians fleeing colonial rule.|$|E

6000|$|Truly the boy {{who entered}} {{was a picture of}} sturdy English vigour, stout-limbed, rosy-faced, clear eyed, open, and straight-forward looking, perhaps a little clumsy with the clumsiness of sixteen, {{especially}} when conscience required tearing spirits <b>to</b> be <b>subdued</b> <b>to</b> the endurance of the feeble. It was, however, a bright congratulating look that met him from the trio. The little girl started up, 'Your sovereign's come, Felix!' ...|$|R
5|$|Godoy's attempt <b>to</b> <b>subdue</b> the Maya around Champoton was {{unsuccessful}} and {{the local}} Kowoj Maya resisted his attempts to assert Spanish dominance of the region. This resistance was sufficiently tenacious that Montejo the Younger sent his cousin from Tabasco to Champoton to take command. His diplomatic overtures to the Champoton Kowoj were successful and they submitted to Spanish rule. Champoton was the last Spanish outpost in the Yucatán Peninsula; it was increasingly isolated and the situation there became difficult.|$|E
5|$|Having {{secured the}} area around Fort Niagara, the British {{launched}} two military expeditions into the west. The first expedition, led by Colonel John Bradstreet, was to travel by boat across Lake Erie and reinforce Detroit. Bradstreet was <b>to</b> <b>subdue</b> the Native Americans around Detroit before marching south into the Ohio Country. The second expedition, commanded by Colonel Bouquet, was to march west from Fort Pitt and form a second front in the Ohio Country.|$|E

5|$|On January 8, 1861 Helm chaired {{a meeting}} in Louisville that {{advocated}} for Kentucky's neutrality in the Civil War. Helm was an outspoken opponent of secession, but also denounced the election of Abraham Lincoln and his {{use of military force}} <b>to</b> <b>subdue</b> the southern states. Because Helm did not condemn his son, Benjamin, for joining the Confederate Army, federal authorities classified him as a southern sympathizer.|$|E
5|$|Only {{two years}} later, the French Revolution began, which embraced {{many of the}} {{political}} ideas that the Patriots had espoused in their own revolt. The Patriots enthusiastically supported the Revolution, and when the French revolutionary armies started to spread that revolution, the Patriots joined in, hoping to liberate their own country from its authoritarian yoke. The Stadtholder joined the ill-fated First Coalition of countries in their attempt <b>to</b> <b>subdue</b> the suddenly anti-Austrian French First Republic.|$|E
5|$|Strafford {{had become}} the {{principal}} target of the Parliamentarians, particularly John Pym, {{and he went on}} trial for high treason on 22 March 1641. However, the key allegation by Sir Henry Vane that Strafford had threatened to use the Irish army <b>to</b> <b>subdue</b> England was not corroborated and on 10 April Pym's case collapsed. Pym and his allies immediately launched a bill of attainder, which simply declared Strafford guilty and pronounced the sentence of death.|$|E
60|$|Jim {{spoke in}} a soft, drawling voice, and his almost expressionless tone seemed to {{indicate}} pleasant indifference; still, {{no one could have}} been misled by it, for the long, steady gaze he gave the men and his cool presence that held the room quiet meant something vastly different. No reply was offered. Bud and Bill sat down, evidently to resume their card-playing. The uneasy silence broke to a laugh, then <b>to</b> <b>subdued</b> voices, and finally the clatter and hum began again. Dick led me outside, where we were soon joined by Jim.|$|R

5|$|Although the {{operation}} may have commenced under Septimius Zabbai, Zabdas' second-in-command, {{the invasion of}} Asia Minor did not fully begin until Zabdas' arrival {{in the spring of}} 271. The Palmyrenes annexed Galatia and, according to Zosimus, reached Ancyra. Bithynia and the Cyzicus mint remained beyond Zenobia's control, and her attempts <b>to</b> <b>subdue</b> Chalcedon failed. The Asia Minor campaign is poorly documented, but {{the western part of the}} region did not become part of the queen's authority; no coins with Zenobia or Vaballathus' portraits were minted in Asia Minor, and no royal Palmyrene inscriptions have been found. By August 271 Zabdas was back in Palmyra, with the Palmyrene empire at its zenith.|$|E
