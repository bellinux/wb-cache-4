5|$|A notable venue {{not found}} at the 1956 Games was an Olympic Village, where the athletes would be housed. The town of Cortina d'Ampezzo had a {{population}} of less than 7,000 people in 1956. Local hotels were concerned that after the Olympics an Olympic Village would so significantly increase the hotel capacity it would put many of <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business.</b> Athletes were billeted by local families or stayed in hotels during the Games.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} {{in favour of}} West Ham's bid was unanimous, although controversial as local rivals Tottenham Hotspur had also been bidding for the venue. Hopes of moving to the stadium, however, were since placed under doubt following a legal challenge by Tottenham and Leyton Orient, with Leyton Orient fearful that having West Ham playing {{less than a mile}} away from their Brisbane Road ground could steal support from the club and put <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business.</b> Both clubs' appeal for a judicial review, however, were rejected on 23 June 2011. On 3 March 2011, West Ham's proposed move to the Olympic Stadium was formally approved by the British government and Mayor of London Boris Johnson.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of Stanley's {{election}} to the House, the American Tobacco Company had eliminated all its substantial competitors either by acquisition or by driving <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business.</b> The company worked with British tobacco manufacturers to set tobacco prices worldwide. Congressman Stanley came {{to the defense of}} the tobacco farmers of his district, making him virtually unbeatable as a congressional candidate. In the first of his five consecutive terms, he authored a bill that would remove an oppressive national tobacco tax, hoping this would help raise prices for unprocessed tobacco. The bill was defeated by extensive lobbying efforts by the American Tobacco Company. In 1904, he convinced the Ways and Means Committee to hold public hearings on the American Tobacco Company's monopolistic actions, but the hearings did not convince legislators to repeal the tax nor take action against the American Tobacco Company.|$|E

5|$|In May 1773, the British Parliament {{passed the}} Tea Act, a tax law {{to help the}} {{struggling}} East India Company, one of Great Britain's most important commercial institutions. Britons could buy smuggled Dutch tea more cheaply than the East India Company's tea because of the heavy taxes imposed on tea imported into Great Britain, and so the company amassed a huge surplus of tea {{that it could not}} sell. The British government's solution to the problem was to sell the surplus in the colonies. The Tea Act permitted the East India Company to export tea directly to the colonies for the first time, bypassing most of the merchants who had previously acted as middlemen. This measure was a threat to the American colonial economy because it granted the Tea Company a significant cost advantage over local tea merchants and even local tea smugglers, driving <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business.</b> The act also reduced the taxes on tea paid by the company in Britain, but kept the controversial Townshend duty on tea imported in the colonies. A few merchants in New York, Philadelphia, Boston, and Charlestown were selected to receive the company's tea for resale. In late 1773, seven ships were sent to the colonies carrying East India Company tea, including four bound for Boston.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, {{professional}} wrestling {{had lost its}} high ratings, and producers, realizing that they had overexposed it, soon dropped most wrestling shows from their lineups. The remaining televised wrestling promoters had small, local syndicated shows, which network producers placed as late-night fillers rather than signature programming. Promoters used localized television as a weapon for eliminating the competition by purchasing airtime from rival territories, effectively putting <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business.</b>|$|E

In addition, the company had credible midcard stars such as Chris Jericho, Eddie Guerrero, Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko, and Raven, as well as an exciting cruiserweight division featuring high-flying international competition from Mexico and Japan, where the high-flying style of wrestling was popularized.

For inspiration, the two writers studied {{the work of}} Walt Disney and Warner Bros. Cartoons from the Golden Age of American animation, especially Tex Avery and Bob Clampett cartoons. The Cloverleaf streetcar subplot was inspired by Chinatown. Price and Seaman said that [...] "the Red Car plot, suburb expansion, urban and political corruption really did happen," [...] Price stated. [...] "In Los Angeles, during the 1940s, car and tire companies teamed up against the Pacific Electric Railway system and bought <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business.</b> Where the freeway runs in Los Angeles is where the Red Car used to be."

Knowing the game would be fixed, Jude and the others liquidate all of their assets and bet all of their earnings on the boxing match. The underdog on which they placed the bet won.

2500|$|The Society of Revolutionary Republican Women, {{a militant}} {{group on the}} far left, demanded a law in 1793 that would compel all women to wear the tricolour cockade to {{demonstrate}} their loyalty to the Republic. They also demanded vigorous price controls to keep bread – the major food of the poor people – from becoming too expensive. After the Convention passage law in September 1793, the Revolutionary Republican Women demanded vigorous enforcement, but were counted by market women, former servants, and religious women who adamantly opposed price controls (which would drive <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business</b> [...] ) and resented attacks on the aristocracy and on religion.

2500|$|In the United States, Bostonians such as Frank Weston started {{importing}} bicycles in 1877 and 1878, and Albert Augustus Pope started {{production of}} his [...] "Columbia" [...] high-wheelers in 1878, and {{gained control of}} nearly all applicable patents, starting with Lallement's 1866 patent. Pope lowered the royalty (licensing fee) previous patent owners charged, and took his competitors to court over the patents. The courts supported him, and competitors either paid royalties ($10 per bicycle), or he forced <b>them</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>business.</b> There {{seems to have been}} no patent issue in France, where English bicycles still dominated the market. By 1884 high-wheelers and tricycles were relatively popular among a small group of upper-middle-class people in all three countries, the largest group being in England.

2500|$|Muckraker {{journalists and}} other {{investigators}} began to publicize instances of death, drug addiction, and other hazards from the compounds. This took some small courage {{on behalf of}} the publishing industry that circulated these claims, since the typical newspaper of the period relied heavily on the patent medicines. In 1905, Samuel Hopkins Adams published an exposé entitled [...] "The Great American Fraud" [...] in Collier's Weekly that led to the passage of the first Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906. This statute did not ban the alcohol, narcotics, and stimulants in the medicines; it required them to be labeled as such, and curbed some of the more misleading, overstated, or fraudulent claims that appeared on the labels. [...] In 1936 the statute was revised to ban them, and the United States entered a long period of ever more drastic reductions in the medications available unmediated by physicians and prescriptions.
