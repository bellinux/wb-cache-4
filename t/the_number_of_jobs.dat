5|$|Mitch caused such {{massive and}} {{widespread}} damage that Honduran President Carlos Roberto Flores claimed it destroyed {{fifty years of}} progress in the country. Honduras, the country most affected by the hurricane, received significant aid for the millions impacted by the hurricane. Mexico quickly gave help, sending 700tons of food, 11tons of medicine, four rescue planes, rescue personnel, and trained search dogs. Cuba also volunteered, sending a contingent of physicians to the country. The U.S. administration offered at first troops stationed in Honduras, and then withdrew them {{a few days after}} the storm. They also at first offered only $2million (1998USD) in aid, which came as a shock to residents, and president Carlos Roberto Flores alike. The U.S. later increased their offer to $70million (1998USD). The Honduran government distributed food, water, and medical services to the hurricane victims, including the more than 4million without water. In addition, the country initially experienced a sharp increase in the unemployment rate, largely due to the destruction of crop lands. However, rebuilding provided jobs in the following years. In Costa Rica, reconstruction after the hurricane increased <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> by 5.9%, lowering the unemployment rate slightly.|$|E

25|$|The Depression {{was a major}} blow to cigar manufacturers. Worldwide demand {{plummeted}} {{as consumers}} sought to cut costs by switching to less-expensive cigarettes, and factories responded by laying off workers or shutting down. This trend continued throughout the 1930s as the remaining cigar factories gradually switched from traditional hand-rolled manufacturing to cheaper mechanized methods, further reducing <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> and the salaries paid to workers.|$|E
25|$|Infrastructure was {{severely}} affected. The {{number of people}} with potable water went from six million to 90,000. as 6,500 meters of primary and secondary water and drainage pipes suffered breaks in 163 places, cutting off water and contaminating it. 516,000m2 of asphalt was damaged, and 137 schools collapsed. <b>The</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> lost due to the event was estimated at 200,000.

25|$|Another of Ybor’s {{modifications}} to the company town model was that his community was not a one-(or even two-) company town. To increase <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> (and thus the pool of available workers), Ybor encouraged other cigar manufacturers to move to his new colony by offering cheap land and a free factory building if they agreed to meet certain job-creation quotas. Even with these inducements, cigar workers and other cigar manufacturers were slow in coming to what was still a primitive settlement - few {{were willing to take}} the risk of moving to and buying a home in a new place that might not last.|$|E

25|$|Norway {{adopted a}} policy of {{neutrality}} from 1905; during World War I the Norwegian merchant marine was largely used {{in support of the}} British, resulting in Norway being classified as The Neutral Ally. Half the Norwegian fleet was sunk and 2,000 seamen were killed by the German Atlantic U-boat Campaign. Some merchants made huge profits from trade and shipping during the war, resulting in an increased division between the classes. The interwar period was dominated by economic instability caused among other by strikes, lock-outs and the monetary policy causing deflation to compensate for too much money having been issued during the war and thus hindering investments. Especially fishermen were hit hard in the period, while farmers retained market prices through organizing regulations. Unemployment peaked at ten percent between 1931 and 1933. Although industrial production increased by eighty percent from 1915 to 1939, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> remained stable. The Norwegian School of Economics was established in 1936.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy had}} hit bottom in March 1933 {{and then started}} to expand. Economic {{indicators}} show the economy reached nadir {{in the first days}} of March, then began a steady, sharp upward recovery. Thus the Federal Reserve Index of Industrial Production sank to its lowest point of 52.8 in July 1932 (with 1935–39 = 100) and was practically unchanged at 54.3 in March 1933; however by July 1933, it reached 85.5, a dramatic rebound of 57% in four months. Recovery was steady and strong until 1937. Except for employment, the economy by 1937 surpassed the levels of the late 1920s. The Recession of 1937 was a temporary downturn. Private sector employment, especially in manufacturing, recovered {{to the level of the}} 1920s but failed to advance further until the war. The U.S. population was 124,840,471 in 1932 and 128,824,829 in 1937, an increase of 3,984,468. The ratio of these numbers, times <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> in 1932, means there was a need for 938,000 more 1937 jobs to maintain the same employment level.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, anesthesiologists are {{physicians}} (MD or DO) {{who have}} chosen to specialize in anesthesiology and are extensively trained medical care providers in the United States. Anesthesiologists in the United States must have completed an undergraduate college program (that includes pre-medical requirements) and four years of medical school training. Anesthesiology residency programs in the United States require successful completion of four years of residency training for board certification eligibility in the specialty of anesthesiology. An anesthesiology residency requires a one-year medicine or surgery internship followed by three years of anesthesiology training. Anesthesiology residents face multiple examinations during their residency, including exams encompassing physiology, pathophysiology, pharmacology, and other medical sciences addressed in medical school, along with multiple anesthesia knowledge tests which assess progress during residency. Successful completion of a board exam after completion of residency is required for board certification. The average salary for a full-time anesthesiologists is roughly $258,100, according to US News. <b>The</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> are rounding to about 170,400 according to statistics in 2014.|$|E
30|$|The second way {{in which}} a gap has emerged is at the {{aggregate}} level.

This analysis has shown a large fall since 1986 in <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> held by people with no qualifications, reflecting the expansion of the education system; but <b>the</b> <b>numbers</b> <b>of</b> <b>jobs</b> which require no qualifications fell much more slowly. Similarly, at the other end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spectrum, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> graduates in <b>the</b> labour force has begun, especially in recent years, to outpace <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> graduate <b>jobs.</b> This is why, increasingly, some graduates are finding themselves in lower-ranking jobs.|$|R

Much of the taxes are spent on public sector employees, {{many of which are}} jobs-for-life and amount to 124,000 state employees and 430,000 municipal employees. That is 113 per 1000 residents (over a quarter of workforce) compared to 74 in the US, 70 in Germany, and 42 in Japan (8% of workforce). The Economist Intelligence Unit's ranking for Finland's e-readiness is high at 13th, compared to 1st for United States, 3rd for Sweden, 5th for Denmark, and 14th for Germany. Also, early and generous retirement schemes have contributed to high pension costs. Social spending such as health or education is around OECD median. Social transfers are also around OECD median. In 2001 Finland's outsourced proportion of spending was below Sweden's and above most other Western European countries. Finland's health care is more bureaucrat-managed than in most Western European countries, though many use private insurance or cash to enjoy private clinics. Some reforms toward more equal marketplace have been made in 2007-2008. In education, child nurseries, and elderly nurseries private competition is bottom-ranking compared to Sweden and most other Western countries. Some public monopolies such Alko remain, and are sometimes challenged by the European Union.
