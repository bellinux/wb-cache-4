5|$|By 1930, the {{violence}} between the Nazis and communists led to local SA troop leader Horst Wessel being shot by {{two members of}} the Communist Party of Germany. He later died in hospital. Exploiting Wessel's death, Goebbels <b>turned</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> martyr for the Nazi movement. He officially declared Wessel's march Die Fahne hoch (Raise the flag), renamed as the Horst-Wessel-Lied, to be the NSDAP anthem.|$|E
5|$|Bonifácio was {{dismissed}} {{from his position}} in December 1833 and replaced by another guardian. PedroII spent his days studying, with only two hours set aside for amusements. Intelligent, {{he was able to}} acquire knowledge with great ease. However, the hours of study were strenuous and the preparation for his role as monarch was demanding. He had few friends of his age and limited contact with his sisters. All that coupled with the sudden loss of his parents gave PedroII an unhappy and lonely upbringing. The environment in which he was raised <b>turned</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> shy and needy person who saw books as a refuge and retreat from the real world.|$|E
5|$|The artist {{emerged in}} 1489 {{as part of}} the {{cultural}} world of Milan, beginning a successful career that <b>turned</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> leading exponent of Renaissance sculpture in Brescia, distinguishing himself with works of cultural import such as his cycle of the Caesars for the Loggia palace in Brescia, as well as the Martinengo mausoleum. He introduced a powerful and highly expressive classical taste, as opposed to the hitherto existing refined decorativeness. During {{the first decade of the}} sixteenth century, Gasparo was able to win over public and private clients who sought to translate into stone their pride in their supposed historical descent from ancient Rome.|$|E

5|$|During {{the next}} few weeks, the pair began a losing streak, mainly caused by Hurricane's {{on-screen}} injuries. During the October 17 episode of Raw, The Hurricane was assaulted by Kurt Angle {{at the request of}} Vince McMahon. After the beating, footage was shown of The Hurricane ripping off his mask and striking Rosey because he did not help him fend off Angle. The next week, The Hurricane no-showed a World Tag Team Title match, leaving Rosey to face the champions alone. During the match, The Hurricane (out of costume) appeared {{at the top of the}} entrance ramp, reverting to his real name, Gregory Helms, and watched as Rosey was double teamed and defeated. After the match, Helms announced that he was fed up with being funny for the crowd, and that he was sick of carrying Rosey as a tag team partner. This <b>turned</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> heel in the process. On the November 7 episode of Raw, Helms and Rosey faced off in a singles match, which Helms won. Subsequently, Helms wrestled mostly on Raws sister show, Heat. On the January 2, 2006 episode of Raw Helms confronted Jerry Lawler over jokes that Lawler had been making at Helms' expense, and Lawler said that when Helms was The Hurricane, he was entertaining and called Helms a joke. Helms responded by slapping Lawler, who hit Helms back. This confrontation led to Lawler defeating Helms in a match at New Year's Revolution.|$|E
5|$|Alucard {{appears in}} , {{a chapter of}} the Lords of Shadow reboot series. It is {{revealed}} that this version of Alucard was originally Trevor Belmont, the son of Gabriel and Marie Belmont, conceived before Gabriel {{was turned into a}} vampire and became the dark lord Dracula. Trevor grew up not knowing of his true origin until the Brotherhood of Light reveals to him who his parents were. Believing that his father Gabriel murdered his mother in cold blood, he decides to pursue him in the hopes of destroying him and bringing peace to the land. After infiltrating the castle, Trevor successfully fights his way to the throne room, where he confronts Dracula without letting on that he is his son, or telling Dracula his name. Although Trevor puts up a valiant effort, in the end he is defeated and stabbed in the heart with his own Combat Cross. Dying and gazing at the Mirror of Fate he finally realizes the truth of what really happened to Gabriel and feels sorry for him, calling him his father. Dracula, confused, gazes at the mirror as well and learns who Trevor was all along. Remorseful and horrified for killing his own son who had been unknown to him the entire time, Dracula desperately tries to bring him back to life by giving him his blood, which seems to be in vain. Dracula mourns over his loss, and places Trevor in a coffin with the name Alucard, since he never learned his son's real name. Many years later Alucard awakens, with pale white skin, white hair, and glowing orange eyes. He meets up with Dracula and his own son, Simon. Alucard tries to finish what he started, angry that his father <b>turned</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> vampire. Dracula asks Alucard to join him in remaking the world and destroying the brotherhood, but Alucard refuses. Dracula proceeds to attack Simon for being a Belmont, wishing to end the Belmont bloodline due to his hatred of his past life. Alucard and Simon manage to defeat Dracula, and part ways as Dracula's castle crumbles.|$|E

During his studies in Germany he met his future British wife Elodie Lawton (1825–1908), previously a dedicated abolitionist in Boston, who influenced him significantly, and <b>turned</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> devoted Anglophile. She was the first English-speaking female historian in Serbia and she published The History of Modern Serbia in 1872.

25|$|In Greek mythology, Tithonus was a Trojan by birth, {{the son of}} King Laomedon of Troy by a water nymph named Strymo ("harsh"). Eos, the Greek {{goddess of}} the dawn, {{abducted}} Ganymede and Tithonus from the royal house of Troy to be her consorts. When Zeus stole Ganymede from her to be his cup-bearer, as a repayment, Eos asked for Tithonus to be made immortal, but forgot to ask for eternal youth. Tithonus indeed lived forever but grew ever older. In later tellings, Eos eventually <b>turned</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> cricket to relieve him of such an existence. In the poem however, it is Eos, and not Zeus, who grants Tithonus immortality.|$|E
25|$|Another {{campaign}} Barrientos took up {{with the}} king was the prosecution of Enrique de Villena, whom he charge with witchcraft and necromancy.

Although John II was himself a man of innovative ideas and one of the more cultured people of his age, like many of the era, he distrusted intellectuals, and, in response to Barrientos' suit, condemned Enrique de Villena to prison. These events are well attested in unpublished works authored by Barrientos, which still exist in Salamanca, such as his Tratado de caso e fortuna (Treatise on Prophesies).|$|E

25|$|After a brief terror-raid into Ottoman-held Bosnia, {{culminating}} in the sack of Sarajevo, Eugene returned to Vienna in November to a triumphal reception. His victory at Zenta had <b>turned</b> <b>him</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> European hero, and with victory came reward. Land in Hungary, given him by the Emperor, yielded a good income, enabling the Prince to cultivate his newly acquired tastes in art and architecture (see below); but for all his new-found wealth and property, he was, nevertheless, without personal ties or family commitments. Of his four brothers, only one was still alive at this time. His fourth brother, Emmanuel, had died aged 14 in 1676; his third, Louis Julius (already mentioned) had died on active service in 1683, and his second brother, Philippe, died of smallpox in 1693. Eugene's remaining brother, Louis Thomas—ostracised for incurring the displeasure of Louis XIV—travelled Europe {{in search of a}} career, before arriving in Vienna in 1699. With Eugene's help, Louis found employment in the Imperial army, only to be killed in action against the French in 1702. Of Eugene's sisters, the youngest had died in childhood. The other two, Marie Jeanne-Baptiste and Louise Philiberte, led dissolute lives. Expelled from France, Marie joined her mother in Brussels, before eloping with a renegade priest to Geneva, living with him unhappily until her premature death in 1705. Of Louise, little is known after her early salacious life in Paris, but in due course, she lived for a time in a convent in Savoy before her death in 1726.|$|E
