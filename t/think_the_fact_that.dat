500|$|Kevin Sacre, whose {{character}} was {{directly involved in}} the storyline, voiced his support for the plot stating: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it's {{the sort of thing that}} happens in real life means it's something that should be addressed. Anyone who buries their head in the sand is a bit naïve. And I think soap is a medium where you can explore issues of real life." ...|$|E
500|$|At the Coroner's Inquest {{into the}} death of the Princess, on 13 February 2008, {{speaking}} by video-link from France, Tomlinson conceded that, after the interval of 16 or 17 years, he [...] "could not remember specifically" [...] whether the document he had seen during 1992 had in fact proposed the use of a strobe light to cause a traffic accident as a means of assassinating Milošević, although use of lights for this purpose had been covered in his MI6 training. On being told that no MI6 file on Henri Paul had been found, Tomlinson said that it [...] "would be absurd after 17 years to say I can positively disagree with it, but... I do not <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> they did not manage to find a file rules out anything either". He said he believed MI6 had an informant at the Paris Ritz but he could not be certain that this person was necessarily Henri Paul.|$|E

500|$|The {{tour of the}} United States faced various troubles. Ament {{said that}} the band and its crew had to [...] " [...] shows from the ground up, a venue {{everywhere}} we went." [...] In June 1995, the band was scheduled to play at San Francisco, California's Golden Gate Park in front of 50,000 people. Before the concert Vedder was forced to stay at a hospital after suffering {{from the effects of}} food poisoning. Vedder left the hospital to play the show, however {{he was not able to}} finish and ended up performing just seven out of twenty-one songs with the band. Neil Young filled in for Vedder for the rest of the show that day. Vedder said, [...] "That whole [...] thing was a blur based on some bad food. It was really, really bad. Looking back at it, it doesn't seem as intense as it was, but it was horrible. I just felt not human and looking back I should have got through that show somehow, and I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Neil [...] was there made me feel like I could get off the hook in some way and I did go out for a few songs." [...] Because of Vedder's health the band was forced to cancel the remaining dates of its tour of the United States. Some dates were reinstated while the rest were rescheduled for the fall. About canceling the dates, Vedder said, [...] "I think we all agreed that it had gotten insane, that it was no longer about the music." [...] Ament later said, [...] "We were so hardheaded about the 1995 tour. Had to prove we could tour on our own, and it pretty much killed us, killed our career." ...|$|E

"The war cannot {{have had}} much effect to your prejudice, as grain {{of all sorts}} bore a high price; and I should <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> large armies were near by, to consume {{everything}} you had to sell, and that at high prices, more than compensated for any disadvantage it might have induced.

5000|$|In 2012, the Guinness Book of World Records {{recognized}} Frank and Louie as the world's oldest living janus cat.

40|$|Leadership! Books {{have been}} written about it, yet we still seem to want more {{accounts}} of it. In large part, the desire for ever more examples and models of leadership derives, I <b>think,</b> from <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> leadership occurs in context, and particular contexts seem to call for particular kinds of leadership qualities. In this brief paper, I will discuss leadership for school improvement and two core principles that can help explicate it: power and insight...|$|R

In the nick of time, his fellow GIA agents arrive, {{shooting}} both the creature and Plannetta, thus saving Spain's life. However, Spain can only <b>think</b> of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Invisible menace is everywhere....|$|R
5000|$|The Fool Circle {{is notable}} for a reggae sound {{on many of}} the songs. In an {{interview}} bassist Pete Agnew commented:"'Fool Circle' was the nearest we came to making a concept album, trying to inject a bit of humour into a pretty heavy subject.

You <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> {{everything}} suddenly makes such good sense at the end is almost accidental. And then you read it a few more times, simultaneously finding out more about writing yourself, and you realize what an absolute tour de force it was, making something as beautifully honed as that appear so casual." ...|$|E
5000|$|Speaking to The Blog That Celebrates Itself in 2009 {{about the}} EP, singer Steve Waterhouse said: [...] "We were only just finding our feet as a {{recording}} band {{during that time}} - something we've become a lot better at, which I think will show on the next record. I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it was recorded live comes through and that’s something we’re all really pleased about. There's a looseness that you can only get from playing live." ...|$|E
5000|$|He goes on {{to explain}} in the same {{interview}} {{that he was not}} put off by the fans: [...] "When I look back on it, I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> that song was a hit gives me some confidence in pop music because the song is completely honest, what it is, it's crafted well, it's relaxed, it's recorded in a way that we'd never recorded a song before, which was absolutely live, three or four microphones in a bedroom. The song cannot have more integrity than it had." ...|$|R

[...] "Oh, a new religion," [...] said Flambeau, laughing; [...] "one of those new {{religions}} that forgive your sins by saying you never had any. Rather like Christian Science, I should <b>think.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> is <b>that</b> a fellow calling himself Kalon (I don't know what his name is, except that it can't be that) has taken the flat just above me. I have two lady typewriters underneath me, and this enthusiastic old humbug on top. He calls himself the New Priest of Apollo, and he worships the sun." ...|$|R
5000|$|Blocking reduces variability. Its {{principle}} lies in <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> a variability that {{cannot be}} overcome (e.g. needing two batches of raw material to produce 1 container of a chemical) is confounded or aliased with a(n) (higher/highest order) interaction to eliminate {{its influence on}} the end product. High order interactions are usually of <b>the</b> least importance (<b>think</b> of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> temperature of a reactor or the batch of raw materials {{is more important than}} the combination of the two - this is especially true when more (3, 4, ...) factors are present) thus it is preferable to confound this variability with the higher interaction.|$|R
5000|$|In 1983, Bono {{said of the}} song, [...] "It {{would be}} stupid to start drawing up battle lines, but I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> 'New Year's Day' made the Top Ten {{indicated}} a disillusionment among record buyers. I don't think 'New Year's Day' was a pop single, certainly {{not in the way}} that Mickie Most might define a pop single as something that lasts three minutes and three weeks in the chart. I don't think we could have written that kind of song." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2012, Wu debuted on the {{big screen}} with a three part-film series, The Four, {{starring}} Ronald Cheng, Anthony Wong, Deng Chao, and Liu Yifei. In February 2013, she was cast in the Korean reality show, We Got Married with Ok Taecyeon, of South Korean boy band 2PM, as her virtual husband. Regarding this experience, she has commented, [...] "I feel thankful that you found me. I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> I was able to do this show was a gift from the up above." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2008, Bakewell criticised {{the absence}} of older women on British television. She said: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> people are phased out, people like Moira Stuart and Selina Scott - {{out of the public}} eye - when they become a certain age is a real {{disadvantage}} to serious broadcasting. There's a whole segment of the British population that does not see its equivalent in serious broadcasting and that is women over 55. Now, that is not healthy for a broadcasting organisation's relationship with its audience. The public should be represented on the screen in various colours, forms, sexualities, whatever." ...|$|E
5000|$|His {{other works}} are {{normally}} {{not related to}} disabilities. However, Matthew Higgs argues in his commentary about Gander's work, that his disability actually contributes to Gander's unique way of seeing: [...] "The first thing I ever noticed about Ryan was that he uses a wheelchair. I mention this not in passing, nor as a gratuitous aside. Whilst I accept that some people might argue that this information is irrelevant, I would like to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Ryan uses a wheelchair does - at least - have some bearing on my subsequent understanding of his work." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{necessity}} {{for having the}} officers in the same dress as the men, was apparent to all who watched the operations. The conspicuous figure which a British officer in his helmet presented {{in contrast to the}} native soldiers in their turbans, drew a well-aimed fire in his direction. Of course, in British regiments, the difference is not nearly so marked. Nevertheless, at close quarters the keen-eyed tribesmen always made an especial mark of the officers, distinguishing them chiefly, I <b>think,</b> by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> they do not carry rifles. The following story may show how evident this was:-- ...|$|R
5000|$|In Maryse Condé's novel, Heremakhonon, <b>the</b> protagonist, Veronica <b>thinks</b> about <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> she {{has never}} had a sexual {{relationship}} with a black man, but protests in her internal monologue that [...] "is no Mayotte Capécia. No!" [...] On the other hand, Eileen Ketchum McEwan considers Veronica and Mayotte to be the same type of protagonist, because they are both engaged in a [...] "narcissistic quest" [...] {{to fall in love with}} men that reflect the self-image they would like to have of themselves. McEwan sees both as descendants of the titular character in Madame de La Fayette's Princess of Cleves.|$|R
