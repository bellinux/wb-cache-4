5|$|Deviations {{can occur}} for small {{droplets}} and during different rainfall conditions. The distribution tends <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> averaged rainfall, while instantaneous size spectra often deviate {{and have been}} modeled as gamma distributions.

5|$|Laudes A and B (transposed <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> in a D major composition) were {{combined}} with a movement of a cantate by Graun (probably Carl Heinrich Graun) to form a Christmas motet, Kündlich groß ist das gottselige Geheimnis, BWV Anh. 161.|$|E
60|$|In the larger, non-Russian view, {{what should}} make Turgenev {{sympathetic}} {{and welcome to}} the English-speaking world, is his essential humanity. All his creations, fortunate and unfortunate, oppressed and oppressors, are human beings, not strange beasts in a menagerie or damned souls knocking themselves to pieces in the stuffy darkness of mystical contradictions. They are human beings, <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> live, <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> suffer, <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> struggle, <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> win, <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> lose, in the endless and inspiring game of pursuing from day to day the ever-receding future.|$|R

5|$|The XF6U {{was a small}} {{aircraft}} with tricycle {{landing gear}} and with straight wings and tail surfaces. The wings were short enough {{that they did not}} need to fold. In order <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> more aircraft into crowded hangars, the nose gear could be retracted and the aircraft's weight would rest on a small wheel attached by the ground crew. This raised the tail up so that it could overlap the nose of the aircraft behind it, allowing more aircraft <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> into available hangar space. The turbojet engine was mounted {{in the rear of the}} fuselage and was fed by ducts in each wing root.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} built in the Unity game engine, which enabled faster {{prototyping}} across multiple smartphone platforms. It was also designed first <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> on the iPhone's smaller screen—a lesson learned from Hitman Go, which had been designed for tablets. The Square Enix team collaborated with Tomb Raider brand owners Crystal Dynamics <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> the series license. The player-character outfits, in particular, were informed by this exchange.|$|E

40|$|Orientation: The {{influence}} of the fit components of job embeddedness (<b>fit</b> <b>to</b> job, <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> organization and <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> community) on job performance has not been extensively researched and the relationship is largely unknown. Research purpose: This study investigated the {{influence of}} the fit components of job embeddedness (employee <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> job, <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> organization and <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> community) on employees’ job performance. Motivation for the study: There is a dearth of studies on the fit components of job embeddedness and the relationship with job performance in developing countries especially in Southern Africa. Research design, approach and method: This cross-sectional study made use of a quantitative survey design. The target population comprised employees working in Zimbabwe’s manufacturing sector (n = 452). Main findings: The results revealed that employee <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> job, <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> organization and <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> community positively influences employees’ job performance. Practical/managerial implications: The findings have implications for human resource managers in Zimbabwe’s manufacturing sector, who are encouraged to consider the three fit factors of job embeddedness during the job applicants interviewing process as they have a significant potential to influence job performance. Contribution/value-addition: The research is one of the primary research papers to investigate the direct effects of the fit components of job embeddedness on employee job performance within the Zimbabwean context. It provides a rich platform for further studies and replication in other industry sectors especially within the African context...|$|R

5|$|The trend had {{substantial}} {{implications for}} many early skyscrapers. Some were redesigned <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> new tastes. Much of the ornate detail {{was removed from}} the Metropolitan Life Tower in the 1960s, for example, <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> contemporary, plainer fashions. Many older skyscrapers could not be adapted, however, as they lacked the physical depth to build larger modern offices or the space for new service facilities. Some were demolished to make way for new, larger structures. Amongst these was the Singer Tower, demolished in 1968 and replaced by the international style United States Steel Building. In the 21st century, buildings such as 90 West Street have been renovated as upmarket housing, partially because of their extensive windows and access to sunlight.|$|E
5|$|A Herdwick's grey fleece is {{not easily}} dyed, and is coarse, and so is best suited to use as carpet wool. The wool is also an {{excellent}} natural insulator; {{it is possible to}} buy sheets of fireproofed wool <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> as loft insulation. Herdwick lamb and mutton has a very distinct taste, and was even eaten at Queen Elizabeth II's 1953 coronation banquet. Herdwick ewes also commonly produce desirable market lambs and mules by cross-breeding with Suffolk, Cheviot, Charollais and Texel sheep.|$|E

Wilson put on 25lbs. {{to play the}} overweight Dreiberg. He compared Dreiberg to a soldier who returns from war unable <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> into society. Both Joaquin Phoenix and John Cusack (another fan of the novel) were involved in previous attempts at making the film.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} {{solution was}} <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> twin balanced rudders behind each inner shaft, {{in contrast to}} the single central rudder used on earlier ships. This greatly increased the effectiveness of the rudder and substantially decreased the turning circle of the Invincibles in comparison to earlier ships of their size.|$|E

5|$|Current {{practice}} {{involves a}} celebrity turning {{the lights on}} in mid- to late-November, and they remain lit until 6 January (Twelfth Night). The festivities were postponed in 1963 due to the assassination of John F. Kennedy and in 1989 <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> Kylie Minogue's touring commitments. In 2015, the lights were switched on earlier, on Sunday 1 November, resulting in an unusual closure of the street to all traffic.|$|E
5|$|Day of the Tentacle {{was one of}} {{the first}} games {{concurrently}} released on CD-ROM and floppy disk. A floppy disk version was created to accommodate consumers that had yet to purchase CD-ROM drives. The CD-ROM format afforded the addition of audible dialog. The capacity difference between the two formats necessitated alterations to the floppy disk version. Grossman spent several weeks reducing files sizes and removing files such as the audio dialog <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> the game onto six diskettes.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the launch}} ceremony, the {{builders}} {{had planned to}} have Great Britain towed to the Thames for her final fitting out. Unfortunately, the harbour authorities had failed {{to carry out the}} necessary modifications to their facilities in a timely manner. Exacerbating the problem, the ship had been widened beyond the original plans to accommodate the propeller engines, and her designers had made a belated decision <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> the engines prior to launch, which resulted in a deeper draught.|$|E
5|$|Four F-111C {{aircraft}} were {{modified to}} RF-111C reconnaissance configuration. These aircraft met the RAAF's requirement for aircraft to reinstate its photographic reconnaissance capacity. While the original order for F-111s specified that 18 would be strike variants and six reconnaissance variants, the RAAF later agreed to accept all 24 as strike aircraft and later retrofit six with reconnaissance pallets. In 1971 the USAF dropped plans <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> {{some of its}} F-111s as reconnaissance aircraft, but sold {{the design of the}} reconnaissance pallet to Australia for $3 million. At this time the RAAF decided <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> the pallet to four rather than six aircraft. The reconnaissance pallet contains four cameras and an infrared linescanner unit and is fitted in the F-111's weapons bay. The RF-111Cs retained their strike capability.|$|E
5|$|From 1943 on, Hergé {{with the}} help of Edgar P. Jacobs started {{redrawing}} and colouring the early Tintin adventures, while also collaborating in the production of new stories.

Jacobs eventually ended the collaboration in 1947 when Hergé refused to share the credit with him. They remained friends regardless of the fact.|$|E
