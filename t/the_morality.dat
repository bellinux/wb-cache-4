5|$|A typical Robinsonade– a {{genre of}} fiction {{inspired}} by Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe– {{and one of}} the most popular of its type, the book first went on sale in late 1857 and has never been out of print. Among the novel's major themes are the civilising effect of Christianity, 19th-century British imperialism in the South Pacific, and the importance of hierarchy and leadership. It was the inspiration for William Golding's dystopian novel Lord of the Flies (1954), which inverted <b>the</b> <b>morality</b> of The Coral Island; in Ballantyne's story the children encounter evil, but in Lord of the Flies evil is within them.|$|E
5|$|Finding Konrad's {{executed}} command team, Walker uses a small {{radio to}} communicate with who he believes to be Konrad himself, who challenges <b>the</b> <b>morality</b> of his actions throughout the story. Konrad then manipulates Walker into executing an Emirati survivor or a 33rd soldier, who both committed serious crimes. Delta subsequently meet CIA agent Jeff Riggs, who is leading a raid on the city's last water supply. Delta aids Riggs {{with the aim of}} crippling the 33rd's operations, but Riggs destroys the supply instead, admitting he wanted to wipe out the remaining population of Dubai to cover up the atrocities of the 33rd.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} some reflections {{referred to}} the alleged advantage of <b>the</b> atheistic <b>morality</b> over <b>the</b> theistic <b>morality.</b> It refers especially to the philosophy of religion and morality developed by Paul Henri-Holbach.

5|$|Martin's inspirations {{included}} the Wars of the Roses and the French historical novels The Accursed Kings by Maurice Druon. A Song of Ice and Fire received praise for its diverse portrayal {{of women and}} religion, {{as well as its}} realism. An assortment of disparate and subjective points of view confronts the reader, and the success or survival of point of view characters is never assured. Within the often morally ambiguous world of A Song of Ice and Fire, questions concerning loyalty, pride, human sexuality, piety, and <b>the</b> <b>morality</b> of violence frequently arise.|$|E
5|$|The Allied bombing {{campaign}} {{was one of}} the main factors which influenced the Japanese government's decision to surrender in mid-August 1945. However, there has been a long-running debate over <b>the</b> <b>morality</b> of the attacks on Japanese cities, and the use of atomic weapons is particularly controversial. The most commonly cited estimate of Japanese casualties from the raids is 333,000 killed and 473,000 wounded. There are a number of other estimates of total fatalities, however, which range from 241,000 to 900,000. In addition to the loss of mostly civilian life, the raids contributed to a large decline in industrial production.|$|E
5|$|The Amazing Jeckel Brothers is {{the fifth}} studio album by American hip hop group Insane Clown Posse, {{released}} on May 25, 1999, by Island Records, in association with Psychopathic Records. Recording sessions for the album took place from 1998 to 1999. The album {{is the fifth}} Joker's Card in the group's Dark Carnival mythology. The album's lyrics focus on the 9 circles of hell, and <b>the</b> <b>morality</b> of man as he is torn between righteousness and evil. The album's titular Jeckel Brothers are spirits who juggle balls of fire, representing the sins committed during the mortal life of the dead.|$|E

2500|$|As {{with the}} {{original}} game, the notion of alternate moral pathways was of paramount importance to the gameplay of Ties That Bind. In the first game, <b>the</b> player's <b>morality</b> not only determined how the game ended, it also determined Torque's past, insofar as the player's actions during the game dictated whether or not Torque had killed his family. So too in Ties That Bind, <b>the</b> player's <b>morality</b> determines both <b>the</b> end of the game, and the events which precede the game, specifically the role Blackmore had {{in the death of}} Torque's family. However, whereas in the first game, <b>the</b> player's <b>morality</b> was manifested primarily in the ending they received, in Ties That Bind, <b>morality</b> determines <b>the</b> beginning, the end, and creates what Rouse refers to as a [...] "ripple effect" [...] throughout the entire game. For example, during the scene where Torque meets Killjoy at the theatre, depending on <b>the</b> player's <b>morality,</b> <b>the</b> cutscene can feature Carmen, Cory or Jordan. Additionally, <b>the</b> player's <b>morality</b> determines whether they fight Creeper or Copperfield.|$|R
5|$|The {{conventional}} {{level of}} moral reasoning {{is typical of}} adolescents and adults. To reason in a conventional way is to judge <b>the</b> <b>morality</b> of actions by comparing them to society's views and expectations. The conventional level consists of {{the third and fourth}} stages of moral development. Conventional morality is characterized by an acceptance of society's conventions concerning right and wrong. At this level an individual obeys rules and follows society's norms even when there are no consequences for obedience or disobedience. Adherence to rules and conventions is somewhat rigid, however, and a rule's appropriateness or fairness is seldom questioned.|$|E
5|$|The one {{exception}} to the general rule of concealment and obfuscation was that of border guards who died on duty. Most were killed either deliberately or accidentally by escapees or escape helpers. The dead guards were hailed by East German government propaganda as heroes, but West German public opinion was divided about <b>the</b> <b>morality</b> of killing border guards. Some took the view that escapees were entitled to use force {{in the course of}} crossing the border, but (as in one case tried in a West Berlin court) others saw the guard's life as taking priority over an escapee's freedom.|$|E
5|$|The pre-conventional {{level of}} moral {{reasoning}} is especially common in children, although adults can also exhibit {{this level of}} reasoning. Reasoners at this level judge <b>the</b> <b>morality</b> of an action by its direct consequences. The pre-conventional level consists {{of the first and}} second stages of moral development and is solely concerned with the self in an egocentric manner. A child with pre-conventional morality has not yet adopted or internalized society's conventions regarding what is right or wrong but instead focuses largely on external consequences that certain actions may bring.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to show in the first place that, owing to the theme of death, The Pride of Life and Eyeryman differ from other <b>moralities.</b> <b>The</b> allegory off life and death in The Pride of Life, and that of death in Everyman have been {{integrated}} with the moral one based on psychomachia. Thus <b>the</b> stereotyped <b>morality</b> machinery with <b>the</b> personifications of virtues and vices appearing in <b>the</b> fifteenth century <b>moralities</b> is absent here. Other characters and a different imagery have been used, though they also serve a moral purpose. Both moralities are indebted to the medieval motif of the Dance of Death# and, in connection with it, satire and both the grotesque and realistic or naturalistic presentation of the motif of death in <b>the</b> respective <b>moralities</b> have been discussed. The theme of the passing away of life, which is integrally connected with that of death, is partly dramatized in Everyman and two other <b>moralities,</b> <b>The</b> Castle ol Perseverance and Mundus et Inf ans. It is dealt with in a different way in The Sun's Darling, a seventeenth-century masque or mnsque-like play recalling <b>the</b> <b>moralities.</b> <b>The</b> medieval vision of death expressed through the grotesque (macabre) image of Death in <b>the</b> <b>moralities</b> (plastic arts) has been modified in The Suns's Darling by another formula and imagery strictly associated with plastic arts. The personifications of time and seasons dramatize the theme of mutability. The attribute of Time (whip), similarly as the scythe oh the Death, signifies his moral function.

5|$|There {{has been}} debate over <b>the</b> <b>morality</b> {{of the air}} {{campaign}} against Japan since World WarII. During the war the American public approved of the bombing of Germany and Japan, and {{the few people who}} criticized the raids were seen as unrealistic or even traitors. Some United States government and military personnel believed that the bombing campaign was morally ambiguous, however, but rarely voiced their views publicly.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{struggle}} {{began in}} India when the Government of India Act 1919 failed to satisfy demand for independence. Concerns over communist and foreign plots following the Ghadar Conspiracy ensured that war-time strictures were renewed by the Rowlatt Acts. This led to tension, {{particularly in the}} Punjab region, where repressive measures culminated in the Amritsar Massacre. In Britain public opinion was divided over <b>the</b> <b>morality</b> of the massacre, between those who saw it as having saved India from anarchy, and those who viewed it with revulsion. The subsequent Non-Co-Operation movement was called off in March 1922 following the Chauri Chaura incident, and discontent continued to simmer for the next 25 years.|$|E
5|$|After {{multiple}} {{years and}} failed petitions, Mother 3 was reannounced for the Game Boy Advance in 2003 within a Japanese television commercial for Mother 1+2, a port of Mother and Mother 2 to the Advance. The game kept its original story {{and received a}} graphical overhaul in a pixelated style similar to Mother 2. The game's themes included human physiology, renewal, and fungibility on <b>the</b> <b>morality</b> spectrum. Its music was composed by Shogo Sakai, and retained the quirky style of series composers Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka. Mother 3 was released on April 20, 2006 in Japan, whereupon it became a bestseller. It has not been released outside Japan.|$|E

5|$|French-speaking naturalists {{in several}} {{countries}} showed appreciation of the much modified French translation by Clémence Royer, but Darwin's ideas had little impact in France, where any scientists supporting evolutionary ideas opted for a form of Lamarckism. The intelligentsia in Russia had accepted the general phenomenon of evolution for several years before Darwin had published his theory, and scientists were quick to take it into account, although the Malthusian aspects were felt to be relatively unimportant. The political economy of struggle was criticised as a British stereotype by Karl Marx and by Leo Tolstoy, who had the character Levin in his novel Anna Karenina voice sharp criticism of <b>the</b> <b>morality</b> of Darwin's views.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, {{the first}} Polish talkies premiered, using sound-on-disc systems: Moralność pani Dulskiej (<b>The</b> <b>Morality</b> of Mrs. Dulska) in March and the all-talking Niebezpieczny romans (Dangerous Love Affair) in October. In Italy, whose once vibrant film {{industry}} had become moribund {{by the late}} 1920s, the first talkie, La Canzone dell'amore (The Song of Love), also came out in October; within two years, Italian cinema would be enjoying a revival. The first movie spoken in Czech debuted in 1930 as well, Tonka Šibenice (Tonka of the Gallows). Several European nations with minor positions in the field also produced their first talking pictures—Belgium (in French), Denmark, Greece, and Romania. The Soviet Union's robust film industry came out with its first sound features in December 1930: Dziga Vertov's nonfiction Entuziazm had an experimental, dialogueless soundtrack; Abram Room's documentary Plan velikikh rabot (The Plan of the Great Works) had music and spoken voiceovers. Both were made with locally developed sound-on-film systems, two of the two hundred or so movie sound systems then available somewhere in the world. In June 1931, the Nikolai Ekk drama Putevka v zhizn (The Road to Life or A Start in Life), premiered as the Soviet Union's first true talking picture.|$|E

5|$|During the 1880s, Moore {{began work}} {{on a series of}} novels in a realist style. His first novel, A Modern Lover (1883) was a three-volume work, as {{preferred}} by the circulating libraries, and deals with the art scene of the 1870s and 1880s in which many characters are identifiably real. The circulating libraries in England banned the book because of its explicit portrayal of the amorous pursuits of its hero. At this time the British circulating libraries, such as Mudie's Select Library, controlled the market for fiction and the public, who paid fees to borrow their books, expected them to guarantee <b>the</b> <b>morality</b> of the novels available. His next book, a novel in the realist style, A Mummers Wife (1885) was also regarded as unsuitable by Mudie's and W H Smith refused to stock it on their news-stalls. Despite this, during its first year of publication the book was in its fourteenth edition mainly due to the publicity stirred up by its opponents. The French newspaper Le Voltaire published it in serial form as La Femme du cabotin in July–October 1886. His next novel A Drama in Muslin was banned by Mudie's and Smith's. In response Moore declared war on the circulating libraries by publishing two provocative pamphlets; Literature at Nurse and Circulating Morals. In these, he complained that the libraries profit from salacious popular fiction while refusing to stock serious literary fiction.|$|E
