5|$|Due {{to their}} {{frequent}} relocation, Kaif and her siblings were home-schooled {{by a series}} of tutors. Although she is thought to have grown up in London, she lived there for only three years before moving to India. According to Kaif, she then changed her surname to her father's because she <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> easier to pronounce.|$|E
5|$|Hines <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{easier to}} enter the North from Canada and {{traveled}} there during the winter. Hines led the Northwest Conspiracy from Canada {{in the fall of}} 1864. Colonel Benjamin Anderson was involved in the plot, along with other Confederate soldiers. It was hoped that Hines and his men would be able to free the Confederate prisoners held at Camp Douglas in Chicago, Illinois.|$|E
5|$|Dodd married Alice Davis in 1933, {{and they}} had two children, Linda Dodd Thompson and Robert Lee Dodd Jr., who played quarterback for the University of Florida from 1960–61. Dodd Jr. had wanted to play for Georgia Tech, but Dodd <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> best if he played for another college. On October 1, 1960, Dodd Jr. contributed to Florida's 18-17 upset of the Yellow Jackets at Florida Field with Ray Graves, Dodd's former assistant, as Gator head coach.|$|E

5|$|The Toy Story {{films and}} {{characters}} will always hold {{a very special}} place in our hearts and we're so excited to be bringing this landmark film back for audiences to enjoy {{in a whole new}} way thanks to the latest in 3-D technology. With Toy Story 3 shaping up to be another great adventure for Buzz, Woody and the gang from Andy's room, we <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> great to let audiences experience the first two films all over again and in a brand new way.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by George Meyer and {{directed}} by David Silverman. Executive producer Sam Simon and writers Al Jean and Mike Reiss {{came up with the}} idea for the episode. A co-worker had recently needed a blood transfusion and the writers <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> funny if Mr. Burns had one. Although Meyer was credited with writing the episode, Jean and Reiss re-wrote and polished the script. The episode includes the debut of the Olmec head Xtapolapocetl, which would become a common background prop in the Simpson home.|$|E
5|$|The {{episode was}} written by Richard Appel and {{directed}} by Dominic Polcino. Appel was looking for new locales to put Bart and <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> funny to have him work at a burlesque house. The problem {{was to find a}} way to put such a house in Springfield, which was solved with the bit with the toy airplane. There were a dozen different possible names for the Burlesque house, some of which were raunchy.|$|E

5|$|The {{producers}} also <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{interesting for}} there to be more to Shannon and Boone's relationship than just Boone's possessive brotherly interest. According to Cuse, the plot twist had become a Lost characteristic so they wanted to surprise the audience by having the Shannon-Boone relationship be sexual in nature. The idea for the two came from an observation that their bickering resembled an older married couple; to support this, they made the characters step-siblings as it had not yet been established what their sibling bond exactly was.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} reasons for showing Oscar's head and {{shoulders}} within the frame during the flashback scenes, rather than letting the camera be the character's eyes. The first was {{that this is the}} way Noé usually sees himself in dreams and when recalling past events. He also <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> easier for the viewer to care about a character who is visible, as many point-of-view films, in his opinion, look unintentionally funny.|$|E
5|$|While {{playing for}} the local youth team of San Vendemiano, Del Piero used to feature as a goalkeeper, {{in order to gain}} more playing time. His mother <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> better for him to play in this role as he would not sweat, and the {{possibility}} of him getting injured was less likely. His brother Stefano commented to their mother that, due to his skill, Alessandro was more suited to playing in a more offensive position, and Del Piero switched to a forward role.|$|E
60|$|I assented, and as I did so I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> {{difficult}} {{to give a}} bad twist to any part of this slenderly framed young creature.|$|R

40|$|Toilet {{dreams are}} quite common {{but have been}} very rarely studied systematically. Many authors assume that the urge to urinate is the basic trigger for these dreams. Analyzing the {{frequency}} and characteristics of toilet dreams in a long dream series supports the idea that these dream topics are related to waking-life memories – especially waking-life <b>thoughts.</b> <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> very interesting to study whether intraindividual night-to-night fluctuations regarding the urge to urinate and/or interindividual differences {{are related to the}} frequency of toilet dreams...|$|R
5|$|According to the story, {{unaware of}} the nature of the gift, Norton saved the cigar, keeping it on display in his college's museum. Years later, when the school was {{shutting}} its doors for good, the alumni <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a fitting gesture to smoke the cigar at the college's annual reunion. The honor was given to Winstead Norton, Horace's grandson. During the sober speech he was presenting, Winstead lit the cigar, and after two puffs, it exploded. A 1952 news report contradicts one detail, holding that the explosion ultimately occurred at a family reunion rather than the alumni affair noted.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Dalton felt {{jealous of}} boys {{for the freedom}} they enjoyed. They could travel alone without {{worrying}} about their reputation and were often bribed to attend school, while girls were, in her opinion, educated reluctantly. One of her teachers <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> wasteful for her to study algebra, as she already had sufficient education for a housewife. As a young woman, she felt that women lived on a higher moral level than men. She saw polygamy {{as a way to}} allow more women to marry the few good men, arguing that it gave more women the opportunity to marry. She also considered it ironic that prostitution was tolerated but polygamy was considered depraved.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} year, Coca-Cola wanted Selena {{to become one}} of their spokespeople in Texas. The jingle used in her first two {{commercials}} for the company were composed by A.B. and Chris Pérez—the latter of whom had joined Selena y Los Dinos several months earlier as the band's new guitarist. Pérez began having romantic feelings for Selena, despite having a girlfriend in San Antonio. After a trip down to Mexico with the band, Pérez <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> best for them both to distance himself from her, but he found that impossible and chose to try to build a relationship with her. They expressed their feelings for each other at a Pizza Hut restaurant, and shortly afterwards became a couple. Pérez and Selena hid their relationship, fearing Quintanilla, Jr. would try to break it up.|$|E

5|$|The {{first look}} of The Dirty Picture {{and a short}} teaser were {{launched}} online on 26 August 2011. The enthusiastic response even prompted its producers to consider a sequel. The film's trailer on YouTube got over 500,000 hits in one day and one million hits in two days. Meanwhile, the theatrical trailer was launched on 30 August at a single screen cinema in Bandra. The space was especially decorated to recreate the retro era. Since the film {{is set in the}} 1980s, a time when multiplexes did not exist, the producers <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> fitting to show the première on a single screen. The lead stars created publicity by organising a promotional campaign in the festival of Mithibai College on 30 November.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} this episode came from Mike Reiss, who <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> funny if the plant went on strike. The {{writers of the}} episode, Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky, would later add the dental plan aspect of the plot. In several scenes, Mr. Burns is portrayed as the Devil who is tempting Homer and showing him what he could have. During the {{production}} of this episode, an ABC camera crew was allowed into the rewrite room, which Al Jean says he regrets because {{they were working on}} stage direction, and they came off as not being very funny.|$|E
5|$|While filming Diamonds Are Forever, Live and Let Die {{was chosen}} as the next Ian Fleming novel to be adapted because screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> daring to use black villains, as the Black Panthers and other racial {{movements}} were active at this time. Guy Hamilton was again chosen to direct, and since he was a jazz fan, Mankiewicz suggested he film in New Orleans. Hamilton did not want to use Mardi Gras since Thunderball featured Junkanoo, a similar festivity, so after more discussions with the writer and location scouting with helicopters, he decided to use two well-known features of the city, the jazz funerals and the canals.|$|E

5|$|Christian Tuxen Falbe, a Danish marine officer, was in Paris in January 1839 {{on behalf}} of Crown Prince Frederik when Louis Daguerre {{revealed}} the art of daguerreotyping. Falbe informed the Crown Prince of a visit to Daguerre where he had {{seen some of the}} very earliest daguerreotypes, explaining how impressed he had been by the new process and how important he <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> for art and science in Denmark. Shortly afterwards, he returned to Copenhagen with a camera and a couple of his own daguerreotypes for the Crown Prince who, believing them to be of scientific importance, deposited them with Hans Christian Ørsted, one of Denmark's most prominent scientists. As a result of Ørsted's own interest in photography, the new art took on rapidly: the daguerreotypist Mads Alstrup (1809–76) opened Copenhagen's first photographic studio in 1842; and by 1850 there were over a hundred studios in Copenhagen and many more in the provinces.|$|E
5|$|John Appleyard had profited {{in terms}} of offices and annuities from his brother-in-law's rise ever since 1559; he was {{nevertheless}} disappointed with what he had got from Robert Dudley, now Earl of Leicester. In 1567 he was approached, apparently {{on behalf of the}} Duke of Norfolk and the Earl of Sussex, to accuse Leicester of the murder of his wife for a reward of £1,000 in cash. He refused to cooperate in the plot, although he had, he said, {{in the last few years}} come to believe that his half-sister was murdered. He had always been convinced of Dudley's innocence but <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> an easy matter to find out the real culprits. He said he had repeatedly asked for the Earl's help to this effect, claiming the jury had not yet come up with their verdict; Dudley had always answered that the matter should rest, since a jury had found that there was no murder, by due procedure of law. Now, as Leicester became aware of a plot against him, he summoned Appleyard and sent him away after a furious confrontation.|$|E
5|$|Takumi {{felt that}} the best way to write a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues, and then pull them {{together}} into one conclusion, and not have multiple possible endings. He said that the biggest challenge with that was to make the gameplay and story work together; the goal was to make the player feel like they have driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear. He only spent little time on writing a backstory for Phoenix before writing the first game's story, and instead made up dialogue and developed Phoenix's personality as he went along. He came up with the partner character Maya because he <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more fun for players to have another character with them, giving them advice, than investigating on their own.|$|E
50|$|The {{idea for}} the series was {{rejected}} {{by many in the}} industry, who <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> only <b>be</b> suitable for children, but the series was finally accepted for development and first broadcast in 1984.|$|R
