60|$|The Psychologist {{recovered}} from his stupor, and suddenly looked under the table. At that the Time Traveller laughed cheerfully. 'Well?' he said, with a reminiscence of the Psychologist. Then, getting up, {{he went to}} the <b>tobacco</b> <b>jar</b> on the mantel, and with his back to us began to fill his pipe.|$|E

60|$|The Professor {{had done}} what he could {{in the short time}} at his disposal. Pens and ink had been placed upon the deal table, and the chairs had been ranged along it instead of around the fire. The <b>tobacco</b> <b>jar</b> and pipes were there, however, and some suspicious-looking jugs; and the hasty current of fresh air, caused by the {{withdrawal}} of a sheet of brown paper from the upper window frame, was altogether powerless to cope with the close beer-house smell which hung about the place.|$|E
60|$|He began {{setting in}} order the litter {{scattered}} about {{him on the}} cabin table and on the floor. But {{it seemed as if}} fate had decided that his friend's personal possessions should fall into his hands that morning, employ them where he might. One among the first objects which he took up was Allan's <b>tobacco</b> <b>jar,</b> with the stopper missing, and with a letter (which appeared by the bulk of it to contain inclosures) crumpled into the mouth of the jar in the stopper's place.|$|E
60|$|With his loud boyish laugh--echoed by Midwinter, {{who caught}} the {{infection}} of his gayety--he swept {{a heap of}} miscellaneous incumbrances off the cabin sofa, and made room for his friend and himself to take their places. In the high flow of youthful spirits, the two sat down to their trifling consultation over a letter lost in a <b>tobacco</b> <b>jar.</b> It was a memorable moment to both of them, lightly as they thought {{of it at the}} time. Before they had risen again from their places, they had taken the first irrevocable step together on the dark and tortuous road of their future lives.|$|E
50|$|From 1884 to 1901, Brandram {{created the}} {{principal}} contralto roles in every Sullivan opera at the Savoy, the only principal {{to achieve that}} distinction. The first of these was Lady Blanche in Princess Ida (1884). In the first London revival of The Sorcerer (1884) she played Lady Sangazure. She next originated the roles of Katisha in The Mikado (1885-87) and Dame Hannah in Ruddigore (1887). She played Little Buttercup, Ruth and Katisha, respectively, in the first London revivals of Pinafore (1887), Pirates and The Mikado (both in 1888). She next created the roles of Dame Carruthers in The Yeomen of the Guard (1888) and the Duchess of Plaza-Toro in The Gondoliers (1889). Also in 1889, she appeared in one-off performances of two new operettas: in May she was in Newport by Robert Goldbeck, with Sybil Grey {{and other members of}} the Savoy company, and in June she starred with Courtice Pounds in a single performance of <b>Tobacco</b> <b>Jars,</b> by Lady Monckton and Harriet Young. She toured as the Duchess briefly in 1890 before returning to the Savoy to complete the run of The Gondoliers.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{this success}} she created {{a number of}} sculptures {{depicting}} working class children from the Lower East Side, depicting them at play and work. These represented [...] "the vitality of the city's immigrant population". Eberle explored similar themes of young immigrant children playing in other works like, Dance of the Ghetto Children (1914). Some of her works even called for more political action like Ragpicker (1911) and Old Woman Picking Up Coal (1906), a work that depicts a poor Italian woman rummaging the streets for bits of coal to heat her stove. Later in Eberle’s career she set up her studio right in New York’s Lower East Side after fearing her work was losing its proletarian character. Eberle found a new place {{to work on the}} top floor of a tenement, she set up her studio with a playroom. Eberle used stories and toys to bring children to her studio where she would work directly from them for her sculpture. In 1911 there was suffrage parade contingent of women sculptors, which Eberle took part in. Eberle’s investment in the suffrage movement never ceases, though it took courage in the early 1900’s. Eberle’s interest in trying to end the injustices of class difference in the country were amplified by the writings of Jane Addams, and she was also very committed to the feminist movement.  From 1907 until 1913 she Eberle showed at Macbeth Gallery in Manhattan. Unfortunately her work often did not pull in the money from collectors and she sold bronze <b>tobacco</b> <b>jars</b> and bookends to get by.|$|R

These were typical examples of Martinware [...] - [...] salt-glazed stoneware which was produced by the Martin Brothers in their pottery; first in Fulham and then in Southall.|$|E
50|$|Still Life and Street is a woodcut print by the Dutch artist M. C. Escher {{which was}} first printed in March, 1937. It {{was his first}} print of an {{impossible}} reality. In this artwork there are two quite distinctly recognizable realities bound together in a natural, {{and yet at the}} same time a completely impossible, way. Looked at from the window, the houses make book-rests between which tiny dolls are set up. Looked at from the street, the books stand yards high and a gigantic <b>tobacco</b> <b>jar</b> stands at the crossroads.|$|E

5000|$|Lanyon's art {{has been}} {{characterized}} as Surrealist or Magical Realist. She sometimes uses the word [...] "dreamscape" [...] to describe her works. Lanyon's early works (late 1950s to the 1960s) included portraits of relatives and the rooms they inhabited. Later she focused more on depicting objects from her collection of curios, {{many of which were}} inherited from relatives, such as a <b>tobacco</b> <b>jar</b> which once belonged to her grandfather. The jar, which is shaped like a toad wearing a red waistcoat, appears in several of her works, as do many other reptiles, insects, and birds. In 1976, Lanyon received a commission from the Department of the Interior to work in the Everglades, which, she says [...] "awakened her to the environmental crisis" [...] and led to more art with a heavy focus on flora and fauna. She has had over seventy-five solo exhibitions, eleven museum exhibitions including three major traveling retrospectives. Her work is in the collections of the Art Institute and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, the Brooklyn Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Museum of American Art, the National Museum of Women in the Arts, the Walker Art Center, the Milwaukee Museum of Art, and the Wadsworth Atheneum, among others. Lanyon has also taught art at several institutions including the Art Institute of Chicago, the Cooper Union and the School of Visual Arts. Her mural, Nine Notable Women, is featured on the Boston Women's Heritage Trail.|$|E
