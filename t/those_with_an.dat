5|$|Anticoagulation, which {{prevents}} further coagulation, {{but does not}} act directly on existing clots, is the standard treatment for DVT. Balancing risk vs. benefit is important in determining the duration of anticoagulation, and three months is generally the standard length of treatment. In <b>those</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> annual risk of VTE in excess of 9%, as after an unprovoked episode, extended anticoagulation is a possibility. Those who finish VKA treatment after idiopathic VTE with an elevated D-dimer level show {{an increased risk of}} recurrent VTE (about 9% vs about 4% for normal results), and this result might be used in clinical decision-making. Thrombophilia test results rarely {{play a role in the}} length of treatment.|$|E

The first series was delivered with a deeper blue color {{than has been}} tradition with Oslo Sporveier trams, but all have since been repainted to match the standard livery. Prior to the delivery of the second series, a single tram was painted deep red to match the buses and the T1000 trains used on the Oslo Metro. Due to negative feedback from the riders, the historic color was kept.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, laws {{regulating}} physician licenses {{are governed}} by the states. Between 1901 and 1989, osteopathic physicians lobbied state legislatures to pass laws giving those with a D.O. degree the same legal privilege to practice medicine as <b>those</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> M.D. degree. In many states, the debate was long and protracted. Both the AOA and the AMA were heavily involved in influencing the legislative process. The first state to pass such a law was California in 1901, the last was Nebraska in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Instead of anticoagulation, a {{follow-up}} imaging test (typically ultrasound) about one-week post-diagnosis {{is an option}} for <b>those</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> acute isolated distal DVT without a high risk for extension; if the clot does not grow, the ACCP does not recommend anticoagulation. This technique can benefit those at a high risk for bleeding. Patients may choose anticoagulation over serial imaging, however, to avoid the inconvenience of another scan if concerns {{about the risk of}} bleeding are insignificant. When applied to symptomatic patients with a negative initial ultrasound result, serial testing is inefficient and not cost effective.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of DKA is with intravenous fluids and insulin. Depending on the severity, insulin {{may be given}} intravenously or by injection under the skin. Usually potassium is also needed to prevent the development of low blood potassium. Throughout treatment blood sugar and potassium levels should be regularly checked. Antibiotics may be required in <b>those</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> underlying infection. In those with severely low blood pH, sodium bicarbonate may be given; however, its use is of unclear benefit and typically not recommended.|$|E

5|$|They {{were built}} in two series, the first of 25 units {{delivered}} in 1982–84, and the second of 15 units delivered in 1989–90. The first 10 units were built by Duewag, while the last 30 {{were built in}} Norway by Strømmen. They were numbered 101 through 140. The two series vary slightly in specifications. The trams were ordered in 1979 after the 1977 decision to not close the tramway, after the SM53 were finished delivered in 1958. The SL79 mainly serves on lines 11, 12 and 19. Except <b>those</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> advertising livery, the trams are painted a light blue.|$|E
5|$|Because higher league {{placement}} {{results in}} {{a greater share of}} television rights, success on the field generates greater income for the club. Since the inception of the Premier League, Manchester United has received the largest share of the revenue generated from the BSkyB broadcasting deal. Manchester United has also consistently enjoyed the highest commercial income of any English club; in 2005–06, the club's commercial arm generated £51million, compared to £42.5million at Chelsea, £39.3million at Liverpool, £34million at Arsenal and £27.9million at Newcastle United. A key sponsorship relationship was with sportswear company Nike, who managed the club's merchandising operation as part of a £303million 13-year partnership between 2002 and 2015. Through Manchester United Finance and the club's membership scheme, One United, <b>those</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> affinity for the club can purchase a range of branded goods and services. Additionally, Manchester United-branded media services – such as the club's dedicated television channel, MUTV – have allowed the club to expand its fan base to those beyond the reach of its Old Trafford stadium.|$|E
5|$|Construction on the Texas Governor's Mansion in Austin {{had been}} {{completed}} three years earlier and first occupied by Governor Elisha M. Pease, whose wife played hostess to anyone who stopped by for a visit. The Houston family and their retinue of slaves moved into the mansion during a political climate that grew increasingly hostile over the secession debate. The family furniture had been moved from Independence by Joshua, since the state government had no budget for staffing, furnishing or maintaining the governor's residence. That financial burden fell {{on the shoulders of}} the incumbent, and the state partially defaulted on Houston's salary. Margaret feared for the family's safety, as her husband worked towards defeating passage of the state's Ordinance of Secession. There had been a botched assassination attempt on Houston, and she saw throngs of angry malcontents gathering in the city. Margaret closed the mansion doors to all but <b>those</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> invitation from the Houstons.|$|E

5|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} {{occurs in}} 4.6–8.0 per 1000 {{people with diabetes}} annually. Rates among those with type 1 diabetes are higher with about 4% in United Kingdom developing DKA a year while in Malaysia the condition affects about 25% a year. In the United States, 135,000 hospital admissions occur annually {{as a result of}} DKA, at an estimated cost of $2.4 billion or a quarter to a half the total cost of caring for people with type 1 diabetes. There has been a documented increasing trend to hospital admissions. The risk is increased in <b>those</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> ongoing risk factor, such as an eating disorder, and those who cannot afford insulin. About 30% of children with type 1 diabetes receive their diagnosis after an episode of DKA.|$|E
5|$|In adults, {{widespread}} {{screening of}} the general population is a matter of debate. Some organizations (such as the United States Preventive Services Task Force) state that evidence is insufficient to support routine screening, while others (such as the American Thyroid Association) recommend either intermittent testing above a certain age in both sexes or only in women. Targeted screening may be appropriate in a number of situations where hypothyroidism is common: other autoimmune diseases, a strong family history of thyroid disease, those who have received radioiodine or other radiation therapy to the neck, those who have previously undergone thyroid surgery, <b>those</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> abnormal thyroid examination, those with psychiatric disorders, people taking amiodarone or lithium, and those with a number of health conditions (such as certain heart and skin conditions). Yearly thyroid function tests are recommended in people with Down syndrome, as they are at higher risk of thyroid disease.|$|E

25|$|According to the American Enterprise Institute, {{research}} has shown that income and intelligence are related. In a 1998 study, Charles Murray compared the earnings of 733 full sibling pairs with differing intelligence quotients (IQs). He referred to the sample as utopian in that the sampled pairs were raised in families with virtually no illegitimacy, divorce or poverty. The average earnings of sampled individuals with an IQ of under 75 was $11,000, compared to $16,000 for <b>those</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> IQ between 75 and 90, $23,000 for <b>those</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> IQ between 90 and 110, $27,000 for <b>those</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> IQ between 110 and 125, and $38,000 for <b>those</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> IQ above 125.
