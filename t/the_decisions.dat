40|$|Abstract — Multiobjective {{evolutionary}} {{method is}} a way to overcome the limitation of the classical methods, by finding multiple solutions within a single run of the solution procedure. The aim of having a solution method for multiobjective optimization problem is to help <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> maker in getting the best solution. Usually <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> maker is not interested in a diverse set of Pareto optimal points. So, it is necessary to incorporate <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> maker’s preference so that the algorithm gives out alternative solutions around <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> maker’s preference. <b>The</b> problem in incorporating <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> maker’s preference is that <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> maker may not have a solid guide line in comparing tradeoffs of objectives. However, it is easy for <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> maker to compare in a fuzzy way. This paper discusses on incorporating a fuzzy tradeoffs in the evolutionary algorithm to zoom out the region where <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> maker’s preference lies. By using test functions it has shown {{that it is possible to}} give points in the region on the Pareto front where <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> maker’s interest lies...|$|R

30|$|The {{concept of}} {{rationality}} {{to be used}} here is that of Savage (1954). That means that each <b>decision</b> maker satisfies <b>the</b> Savage axioms of rational behavior. Then, <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> maker’s preferences can be represented via a utility function such that <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> maker is maximizing his utility. Furthermore, the Savage axioms conceptualize <b>the</b> uncertainty <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> maker is facing such {{that it is the}} personal beliefs that are taken into account when decisions are made. Given the independence axioms <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> maker’s preferences can be represented as an expected utility. To keep the analysis simple, it is always assumed that <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> maker has utility for the payment he gets from working for the firm and the effort variable describes the discrepancy of the utility of <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> maker compared to the firm. The simple interpretation of the effort variable is a personal cost that <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> maker incurs to implement <b>the</b> chosen <b>decision.</b> More fundamentally it catches the fundamental difference in goals of <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> maker compared to the goals of the firm.|$|R
