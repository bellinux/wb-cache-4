5000|$|The facts {{varied between}} the {{individual}} appeals, but the common theme in each of them was that an Event of Default (as defined) had occurred under an ISDA Master Agreement, but <b>the</b> <b>Defaulting</b> Party (as defined) was [...] "in the money", {{in the sense that}} if the open positions were all to be terminated, the non-Defaulting Party would have had to pay over considerable sums to <b>the</b> <b>Defaulting</b> Party to close out the various positions. However, in each case the relevant Master Agreements had not provided for automatic early termination upon an Event of Default.

40|$|Sovereign <b>defaults</b> enable <b>the</b> <b>defaulting</b> {{countries}} to eliminate its debt, {{which raises the}} question why sovereign debt can exist, given that lenders fear losing their money. Thus, a cost burden must exist for a country in order to achieve the government paying its debt. Historically, sovereign defaults mostly occur in times of low GDP growth rates. This makes it impossible to isolate <b>the</b> <b>defaults</b> impact on macroeconomic fundamentals since the vice-versa causality cannot be ruled out when a traditional regression analysis is applied. With this, it is not conceivable to quantify <b>the</b> <b>defaults</b> idiosyncratic costs. An instrument variable for a sovereign default has not been found and it is likely that such an instrument does not exist at all. This paper applies a natural experiment approach to circumvent the above mentioned causality problem. Odious debt cases, as well as scenarios where the government leaders have argued that the government debt is illegitimate, are applied to quantify <b>the</b> sovereign <b>default</b> s impact on macroeconomic fundamentals. Since only few of these cases are available, a panel analysis is conducted, using the Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) and Abadie et al. (2010) synthetic control method for comparative case studies, in order to generate synthetic counterfactual countries that have the same macroeconomic fundamentals in the pre-default period. In addition to that, the creditors behavior towards <b>the</b> <b>defaulting</b> country is analyzed, giving hints that the GDP, FDI s, private lending as well as development aid may decline after <b>the</b> non-necessary <b>default</b> is announced...|$|R

In the same way, applying <b>the</b> second <b>default</b> we obtain that Nixon is a pacifist, thus making <b>the</b> first <b>default</b> not applicable.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} agreed that <b>the</b> credit <b>defaults</b> are correlated. However, {{the structure and}} magnitude of such dependence is not yet fully understood.

Assuming that the industries provides <b>the</b> basis of <b>defaults</b> comovement it provides empirical evidence as to how such comovements can be modeled using correlated industry shocks. Generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) with correlated random effects is used to model <b>the</b> <b>defaults</b> comovement. It is also demonstrated as to how a GLMM with complex correlation structure can be estimated through a very simple way. Empirical evidences are drawn through analyzing quarterly individual borrower level credit history data obtained from two major Swedish banks between the period 1994 and 2000. The results show that, conditional on the borrower level accounting data and macro business cycle variables, <b>the</b> <b>defaults</b> are correlated both within and between industries but not over time (quarters). A discussion has also been presented as to how a GLMM for defaults correlation can be explained. Mr Alam is also affiliated to Dalarna University, SE 781 88 Borlange, Sweden</p...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} the {{existence}} of a cross-monitoring effect between bank debt and public debt by exploring the effects that loan <b>defaults</b> have on <b>the</b> lead arranger’s perceived monitoring ability in the public debt markets. Generating a sample of major loan defaults among U.

We show that the abnormal returns of these “affected firms ” are negative and statistically significant. Moreover, these abnormal returns are economically significant – with a mean about- 1 % when measured over an eleven day window surrounding the announcement of <b>the</b> <b>defaulting</b> loan. Interestingly, we find that these results are even stronger if <b>the</b> <b>defaulting</b> firm had a strong and/or long-standing relationship with its lead lender. We also find that the negative bond market effect is particularly strong if <b>the</b> <b>defaulting</b> loan is an important deal to the lender, if it is a recently originated loan, and if the borrower has better governance, higher profitability and higher firm value in the loan origination year. In contrast, the negative bond market effect is weakened if the affected firms have more intensive analyst coverage and higher firm values.
