5000|$|Token bus is {{a network}} {{implementing}} the token ring protocol over a [...] "virtual ring" [...] on a coaxial cable. A <b>token</b> is <b>passed</b> around the network nodes {{and only the}} node possessing the token may transmit. If a node doesn't have anything to send, the <b>token</b> is <b>passed</b> {{on to the next}} node on the virtual ring. Each node must know the address of its neighbour in the ring, so a special protocol is needed to notify the other nodes of connections to, and disconnections from, the ring.|$|R
50|$|In multiple-access networks, {{where several}} {{terminals}} {{are connected to}} a shared physical medium, round-robin scheduling may be provided by <b>token</b> <b>passing</b> channel access schemes such as token ring, or by polling or resource reservation from a central control station.|$|E

50|$|Another {{significant}} {{difference is that}} ARCNET provides the sender with a concrete acknowledgment (or not) of successful delivery at the receiving end before the <b>token</b> <b>passes</b> {{on to the next}} node, permitting much faster fault recovery within the higher level protocols (rather than having to wait for a timeout on the expected replies). ARCnet also doesn't waste network time transmitting to a node not ready to receive the message, since an initial inquiry (done at hardware level) establishes that the recipient is able and ready to receive the larger message before it is sent across the bus.|$|R

Emissaries and secret <b>tokens</b> <b>passed</b> back and forth between them as indications of certain love.

50|$|There {{are several}} {{software}} implementations of additional protocols that essentially implement a polling or <b>token</b> <b>passing</b> strategy. Then, a master (typically the access point) dynamically polls clients for data. Clients {{are not allowed}} to send data without the master's invitation. This eliminates the hidden node problem at the cost of increased latency and less maximum throughput.|$|E
5000|$|Token Ring {{local area}} network (LAN) {{technology}} is a communications protocol for {{local area network}}s.It uses a special three-byte frame called a [...] "token" [...] that travels around a logical [...] "ring" [...] of workstations or servers. This <b>token</b> <b>passing</b> is a channel access method providing fair access for all stations, and eliminating the collisions of contention-based access methods.|$|E
50|$|The RDM {{standard}} addresses {{this problem}} by ensuring that in all cases (except discovery) only one device is authorized to be transmitting {{at any given time}} (somewhat similar to the <b>token</b> <b>passing</b> approach). Only the controller (of which there can be only one) can start an RDM exchange. Responders can speak only if spoken to. The controller will always initiate all RDM communication.|$|E
50|$|Players {{start the}} game by getting two tiles, showing them their {{follower}} color and the island section they wish to protect. The follower houses are randomly placed around the board by the players and they each shuffle and draw seven cards from their decks. The game is played over 8 rounds with 3 turns in each round. Each turn, players lay a card they wish to play that turn face-down. The start player for the turn reveals and plays their card and the other players do the same, drawing back to seven cards after playing. Once all have played their cards, the start player <b>token</b> <b>passes</b> and the next turn begins.|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} communication, for data {{aggregation}} to complete, {{we note that}} each node has to at least transmit its own data once. Thus, O(N) is an absolute lower bound in terms of communication messages for data aggregation. We have thus shown that EZ-AG achieves this lower bound of O(N) for data aggregation and therefore is indeed quite efficient in terms of communication. Moreover, we also show that the random walk phase terminates in exactly N <b>token</b> <b>passes.</b> Also during each transfer of the token, the number of requests for the token remain fairly constant and low (See Fig.  12). Thus, {{it is not the}} case that the constants of proportionality are high either.|$|R

It is true that there are no collisions on an IBM Token Ring, but this is because of the layer 2 Media Access Control method, not the physical topology (which again is a star, not a ring.) <b>Token</b> <b>passing,</b> not rings, prevent collisions.|$|E
50|$|Stations on a {{token ring}} LAN are logically {{organized}} {{in a ring}} topology with data being transmitted sequentially from one ring station to the next with a control token circulating around the ring controlling access. Similar <b>token</b> <b>passing</b> mechanisms are used by ARCNET, token bus, 100VG-AnyLAN (802.12) and FDDI, and they have theoretical advantages over the CSMA/CD of early Ethernet.|$|E

50|$|On weekdays between 5:15 AM and 11:45 AM, commuters can buy {{a ticket}} to ride the train inside the station's ticket office, but on {{weekends}} and weekday afternoons, tickets must be purchased from the train conductor upon departure of Willow Grove station. Passengers buying their ticket on board the train may only pay for their ticket with cash, <b>tokens,</b> or SEPTA <b>passes</b> because the trains {{do not have a}} terminal for credit card payments on board. However, tickets purchased in advance (inside the ticket office) can be paid for with a credit card or form of payment other than cash, <b>tokens,</b> or <b>passes.</b> Tickets purchased in advance also cost less than tickets purchased from the conductor on board the train.|$|R
40|$|To form a {{cooperative}} multiagent team, autonomous agents {{are required to}} harmonize activities and make {{the best use of}} exclusive resources to achieve their common goal. In addition, to handle uncertainty and quickly respond to external environmental events, they should share knowledge and sensor in formation. Unlike small team coordination, agents in scalable team must limit the amount of their communications while maximizing team performance. Communication decisions are critical to scalable-team coordination because agents should target their communications, but these decisions cannot be supported by a precise model or by complete team knowledge. The hypothesis of my thesis is: local routing of tokens encapsulating discrete elements of control, based only on decentralized local probability decision models, will lead to efficient scalable coordination with several hundreds of agents. In my research, coordination controls including all domain knowledge, tasks and exclusive resources are encapsulated into <b>tokens.</b> By <b>passing</b> <b>tokens</b> around, agents transfer team controls encapsulated in the tokens. The team benefits when a <b>token</b> is <b>passed</b> to an agent who can make use of it, but communications incur costs. Hence, no single agent has sole responsible over any shared decision. The key problem lies in how agents make the correct decisions to target communications and <b>pass</b> <b>tokens</b> so that they will potentially benefit the team most when considering communication costs. My research on token-based coordination algorithm starts from the investigation of random walk of token movement. I found a little increase of the probabilities that agents make the right decision to <b>pass</b> a <b>token,</b> the overall efficiency of the token movement could be greatly enhanced. Moreover, if token movements are modeled as a Markov chain, I found that the efficiency of <b>passing</b> <b>tokens</b> could be significantly varied based on different network topologies. My token-based algorithm starts at the investigation of each single decision theoretic agents. Although under the uncertainties that exist in large multiagent teams, agents cannot act optimal, it is still feasible to build a probability model for each agents to rationally <b>pass</b> <b>tokens.</b> Specifically, this decision only allow agent to <b>pass</b> <b>tokens</b> over an associate network where only a few of team members are considered as token receiver. My proposed algorithm will build each agent's individual decision model based on all of its previously received tokens. This model will not require the complete knowledge of the team. The key idea is that I will make use of the domain relationships between pairs of coordination controls. Previously received tokens will help the receiver to infer whether the sender could benefit the team if a related token is received. Therefore, each token is used to improve the routing of other tokens, leading to a dramatic performance improvement when more tokens are added. By exploring the relationships between different types of coordination controls, an integrated coordination algorithm will be built, and an improvement of one aspect of coordination will enhance the performance of the others...|$|R
