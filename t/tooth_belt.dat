40|$|A {{centralized}} robust {{position control}} for an electrical driven <b>tooth</b> <b>belt</b> drive is designed in this doctoral thesis. Both a cascaded control structure and a PID based position controller are discussed. The {{performance and the}} limitations of the system are analyzed and design principles for the mechanical structure and the control design are given. These design principles are also suitable for most of the motion control applications, where mechanical resonance frequencies and control loop delays are present. One of the major challenges in the design of a controller for machinery applications is that the values of the parameters in the system model (parameter uncertainty) or the system model it self (non-parametric uncertainty) are seldom known accurately in advance. In this thesis a systematic analysis of the parameter uncertainty of the linear tooth beltdrive model is presented and the effect of the variation of a single parameter on the performance of the total system is shown. The total variation of the model parameters is taken into account in the control design phase using a Quantitative Feedback Theory (QFT). The thesis also introduces a new method to analyze reference feedforward controllers applying the QFT. The performance of the designed controllers is verified by experimentalmeasurements. The measurements confirm the control design principles that are given in this thesis...|$|E
40|$|This thesis shows {{a control}} {{algorithm}} {{for coping with}} a ball batting task for an entertainment robot. The robot is a three jointed robot with a redundant degree of freedom and its name is 2 ̆ 2 Doggy 2 ̆ 2. Doggy because of its dog-like costume. Design, mechanics and electronics were developed by us. DC-motors control the <b>tooth</b> <b>belt</b> driven joints, resulting in elasticities between the motor and link. Redundancy and elasticity {{have to be taken}} into account by our developed controller and are demanding control tasks. In this thesis we show the structure of the ball playing robot and how this structure can be described as a model. We distinguish two models: One model that includes a flexible bearing, the other does not. Both models are calibrated using the toolkit Sparse Least Squares on Manifolds (SLOM) - i. e. the parameters for the model are determined. Both calibrated models are compared to measurements of the real system. The model with the flexible bearing is used to implement a state estimator - based on a Kalman filter - on a microcontroller. This ensures real time estimation of the robot states. The estimated states are also compared with the measurements and are assessed. The estimated states represent the measurements well. In the core of this work we develop a Task Level Optimal Controller (TLOC), a model-predictive optimal controller based on the principles of a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). We aim to play a ball back to an opponent precisely. We show how this task of playing a ball at a desired time with a desired velocity at a desired position can be embedded into the LQR principle. We use cost functions for the task description. In simulations, we show the functionality of the control concept, which consists of a linear part (on a microcontroller) and a nonlinear part (PC software). The linear part uses feedback gains which are calculated by the nonlinear part. The concept of the ball batting controller with precalculated feedback gains is evaluated on the robot. This shows successful batting motions. The entertainment aspect has been tested on the Open Campus Day at the University of Bremen and is summarized here shortly. Likewise, a jointly developed audience interaction by recognition of distinctive sounds is summarized herein. In this thesis we answer the question, if it is possible to define a rebound task for our robot within a controller and show the necessary steps for this...|$|E

The fairing of a velomobile tends to limit both the amount and the kinds of grit landing on the drivetrain. Some cycles use tooth-belt drive, which is less affected by grit, is quieter than a chain, and may be lighter. However, belts are only available in pre-selected sizes.

40|$|In all {{expressions}} for {{calculating the}} conveying ability of belts {{there are two}} variables: the number of rotations and the kinematic diameter of the steering pulley. From this it is concluded that the nominal conveying is a two-variable function. Through planar diagrams {{it is possible to}} express the conveying ability {{as a function of the}} number of rotations for the constant value of the kynematic diameter of the steering pulley and vice-versa. Spatial diagrams have precedence over planar diagrams because the the conveying ability can be expressed simultaneously by treating as variables both the number of rotations and the kinematic diameter of the steering pulley. Therefore, we have the spatial function Pn 1 = f(n,dw). Contoural diagrams are derived if this function is cut in equidistant plateaus Pn 1 = const., and are of unique contribution for optimizing the nominal conveying ability.

40|$|Abstract: The work {{described}} {{here has been}} carried out to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} tooth root cracking failure mode of timing belts. Previous work has demonstrated the close dependence of this on the tooth deflections of fully meshed teeth, generated by torque transmission, but has not considered the additional distortions generated in the partially meshed conditions at entry to and exit from a pulley groove. Approximate compatibility and constitutive equations are combined with a rigorous consideration of tooth equilibrium in partial meshing to show how bending moments are generated at both exit from a driven pulley and entry to a driving pulley. Experimentally determined belt lives correlate very well with a combined measure of fully meshed tooth strain and strain due to bending at entry or exit. The analysis also shows that this strain measure reduces with increasing <b>belt</b> <b>tooth</b> stiffness, confirming the importance of a high tooth stiffness for a long <b>belt</b> life. <b>Tooth</b> force variations through the partial meshing cycle have also been predicted and compared with measurements obtained from a special strain gauge instrumented pulley.

30|$|The {{system as}} {{described}} here will support upgrades to improve RepRap 3 -D printer size, speed and accuracy. First, the power requirements do not change if the RepRap build volume is enhanced by increasing the z-height with greater vertical lengths of the smooth guide rods, the support structure/frame and the belts. Similarly the x–y area can be expanded by changing {{the size of the}} base plate, the tie rods and the linking boards without impacting the power system. These approaches can be combined to increase the build volume as needed. Secondly, the power system provided here can support faster print speeds as the print speed is not limited in this case by the power system. The MOST delta can be accelerated further by adjusting the slicing settings. As the print speed increases, however, there are materials deposition limitations and {{depending on the type of}} filament there is a maximum speed for a given quality/resolution of print obtainable. This limitation can be offset in part by increasing the nozzle size of the hot end, which allows more material to be deposited in each layer. Although the positional accuracy remains the same, both the line width and the roundness of corners increase to the size of the nozzle. This is a fundamental limitation of FFF 3 -D printing and can only be further increased by increasing the number of print heads and either chain ganging vertically or horizontally to increase throughput of identical parts. Finally, the power system can support improved accuracy by changing the nozzle size, which provides tighter corners and smaller line widths, but comes at the penalty of increasing print time. In addition, resolution can be improved by using a smaller drive gear or using a geared drive, which although requiring redesigning the extruder drive body could be printed on the MOST delta itself, thus enabling self-upgrading. This improvement again would be accommodated by the power system described here. The print resolution in the x–y plane is complex for a delta as it improves when closer to an apex for that apex. So, for example, when moving toward the W apex (positive y direction), the resolution in x (controlled by U and V) degrades, but resolution in y improves. For the optimal resolution for both x–y dimensions, the optimal print location is the center of the print bed. If the object has high-resolution bottom features, printing on a raft can help preserve the dimensionality of those features and only has a small penalty in energy consumption for the first layer raft printing. The z resolution is equivalent to the resolution of moving the carriages and is independent of the location. The MOST Delta (12 <b>tooth</b> T 5 <b>belt),</b> which operates at 53.33 steps/mm, provides a z-precision of about 19  μm. This can be improved to 10  μm by changing to a 16 <b>tooth</b> GT 2 <b>belt,</b> which operates at 100 steps/mm.|$|R
