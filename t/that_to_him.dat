He mentioned CAMERA's campaign against the Middle East reporting of National Public Radio, in which he says CAMERA had attempted to influence NPR's supporters to withhold funds.|$|E
25|$|Throughout Beckjord's {{career as}} a photographer, paranormal investigator, and cryto-researcher, he {{collected}} photographs, castings, and other memorabilia <b>that,</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> represented evidence {{of the existence of}} UFOs and alien life, the Loch Ness Monster, as well as Bigfoot. He appeared on several nationwide radio and television shows, including Coast to Coast AM, The Tonight Show, and Late Night with David Letterman. In reference to his explorations, Beckjord compared himself to Galileo, Louis Pasteur, and the Wright brothers.|$|E
500|$|Al-Jamri's first {{memories}} in Bahrain were {{during a visit}} with father {{during the month of}} Ramadan. Although he was mocked by other kids due to his partly Iraqi accent, al-Jamri said he was very happy with the visit as he found his village Bani Jamra much more [...] "open" [...] than Najaf. In 1973, al-Jamri returned to Bahrain with his family, spending 11 years of his life in Iraq. He said his father's decision to return to Bahrain was the [...] "best news I have ever received" [...] and <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> Bahrain represented [...] "freedom and eternal joy".|$|E

500|$|Pujols began 2008 by {{reaching}} base in 42 straight games, the longest streak {{to open a}} season since Derek Jeter reached base in the first 53 games of 1999. On June 11, he {{was placed on the}} DL with a strained left calf muscle. Although he was expected to miss three weeks, he was activated from the DL on June 26. Pujols hit his 300th home run against Bob Howry on July 4 in a 2–1 loss to the Cubs. He said after the game <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> it was [...] "just another homer that goes out of the park. I'm happy to do it in front of our fans—they were waiting for it." ...|$|E
500|$|Author Santiago Fouz-Hernández commented in {{his book}} Madonna's Drowned Worlds <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> the song felt like a trepiditation of Madonna's {{thoughts}} about what might be termed [...] "girlhood" [...] and on a broadscale, on [...] "feminity". Christopher P. Andersen, author of Madonna: Unauthorized, described [...] "Dear Jessie" [...] as [...] "a wistfully psychedelic confection of carousels and pink elephants", adding that [...] "the song harkens back to the lullabies your mother must have sang to you". Robin Anne Reid, author of Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy: Overviews, complimented the fact that [...] "although the sort of fantasies that [...] conjures might trend towards the kinky and sexual, she can also delve {{into a world of}} mermaids, fountains of youth, leprechauns and magic lanterns as is evident by 'Dear Jessie'." ...|$|E
500|$|In Doctor Who Magazine, Graham Kibble-White {{gave it a}} {{positive}} review, describing it as [...] "zestful and exciting Doctor Who." [...] He complimented the fact that [...] "the action sequences are played at a fury and the current anything's-possible flourishes continue unabated". He noted that [...] "there's something pointless but pleasing in having Clara's charge, Artie, reading Summer Falls–a book written by Amelia Williams". Additionally, he described the Spoonheads as [...] "a very effective threat, albeit written {{as one of the}} foot soldiers of the Doctor Who world, with only the verbal facility to paraphrase back what's been said," [...] and stated that [...] "the revelation of the concave absence {{at the back of the}} skull is horrific." [...] However, he complained <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> Clara's guess that the TARDIS was a [...] "snogging booth" [...] seemed like [...] "something a 13-year-old boy would conjure, not a 24-year-old woman".|$|E

500|$|I {{have not}} a word {{to say in the}} {{disparagement}} of the intellectual ability of Ely S. Parker, their head chief, and cheerfully unite with [...] "W.H.P." [...] in awarding him the credit for making valuable suggestions to his counsel on the argument of the case in the Supreme Court of the United States [...] Indeed, I am inclined to the belief, <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> is due the credit of originating and suggesting to his counsel the only available point in the case, and the one on which it was there decided, for the case had been ten years in the Courts of this State, and this point was never before made, nor was it made in the Supreme Court of the United States, in the original brief of counsel for the Indians, filed pursuant to the rules of the Court. [...] It was first made in a supplementary brief printed after the opening argument of counsel on the other side had been commenced, and not handed in until the second day, just previous to its conclusion.|$|E
500|$|He finds a {{different}} signal for Sulu, {{but when he}} appears on the transporter padd, he is visibly older (Takei) and dressed as a barbarian. Sulu attacks the crew with a sword, but is disabled by Commander Spock (Jeffery Quinn) using a Vulcan nerve pinch. Sulu explains <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> 30 years have passed, with Chandris dying 15 years prior on a planet they named Caliban. Scotty manages to get a lock on another signal, but cannot re-materialize it without additional equipment. As Sulu explains that he cannot remember the information needed to release the Enterprise, Scotty manages to partly materialize Sulu's daughter Alana (Christina Moses) within a science lab but she remains trapped between universes. Attempting to retrieve the Romulan information, Spock attempts to mind meld with Sulu but the traumatic memories {{of the death of}} Chandris nearly kills them both. Spock is subsequently ordered to find {{a different}} means to exit the anomaly. As McCoy attempts to aid Sulu's memories with drugs, Kirk and Alana flirt with each other. Following further scans by Spock, they realise that she is tied to the anomaly and may return to the other universe once the Enterprise exits. Kirk initiates Spock's backup plan to implode the rift, but it damages the ship and knocks Alana unconscious.|$|E

[...] King wrote that Gurdjieff did not state it as clearly and specifically as this, but was quick to add <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> nothing Gurdjieff said was specific or clear.|$|E

2500|$|Justice Scalia penned a {{separate}} concurrence for four justices in Freytag.

2500|$|This {{record of}} Hodge's {{literary}} life is suggestive {{of the great}} influence that he exerted.

As a teacher he had few equals; and if he did not display popular gifts in the pulpit, he revealed homiletic powers of a high order in the [...] "conferences" [...] on Sabbath afternoons, where he spoke with his accustomed clearness and logical precision, but with great spontaneity and amazing tenderness and unction.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the main}} {{challenges}} of making the film was to convey the smells {{and the world of}} scents that Grenouille experiences. Tykwer said <b>that</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> Perfume [...] "was much more a film about the importance of smell in our life than a film that tries to be smelly." [...] The filmmakers strived to convey smell visually without the use of colors or special effects, Griebe says [...] "people see the fish market full of raw, bloody fish, and they know it stinks; they see a field of lavender and know it smells wonderful. We show Grenouille taking in smells by cupping his nose, and by doing close shots of his nose, and that's it!" ...|$|E
