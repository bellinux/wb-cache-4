5|$|Argon is {{used for}} thermal {{insulation}} in energy-efficient windows. Argon is also used in technical scuba diving <b>to</b> <b>inflate</b> a dry suit because it is inert and has low thermal conductivity.|$|E
5|$|I'll {{say that}} the Ukrainian people treated me well. I recall warmly the years I spent there. This was a period full of responsibilities, but {{pleasant}} because it brought satisfaction... But far be it from me <b>to</b> <b>inflate</b> my significance. The entire Ukrainian people was exerting great efforts... I attribute Ukraine's successes to the Ukrainian people as a whole. I won't elaborate further on this theme, but in principle it's very easy to demonstrate. I'm Russian myself, and I don't want to offend the Russians.|$|E
50|$|The second-system effect (also {{known as}} second-system syndrome) is the {{tendency}} of small, elegant, and successful systems, to be succeeded by over-engineered, bloated systems, due <b>to</b> <b>inflated</b> expectations and overconfidence.|$|R
50|$|Other notable {{factors were}} cited as {{contributing}} <b>to</b> <b>inflating</b> prices, the main ones being: a continuing lack of supply. Record-low borrowing costs; economic recovery; and, particularly in London, demand from foreign investors.|$|R
5000|$|Shloenbachiidae can be {{recognized}} by their usually keel bearing, irregularly ribbed and tuberculate shells that vary from evolute to rather involute and compressed <b>to</b> <b>inflated.</b> Tubercles are concentrated on the umbilical and ventrolateral shoulders.|$|R
5|$|Approximately 19 {{percent of}} all paralytic polio cases have both bulbar and spinal symptoms; this subtype is called {{respiratory}} or bulbospinal polio. Here, the virus affects {{the upper part of}} the cervical spinal cord (cervical vertebrae C3 through C5), and paralysis of the diaphragm occurs. The critical nerves affected are the phrenic nerve (which drives the diaphragm <b>to</b> <b>inflate</b> the lungs) and those that drive the muscles needed for swallowing. By destroying these nerves, this form of polio affects breathing, making it difficult or impossible for the patient to breathe without the support of a ventilator. It can lead to paralysis of the arms and legs and may also affect swallowing and heart functions.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, 'A' Force (the Cairo-based {{department}} responsible for deception operations in the North Africa) had begun an operation, codenamed Cascade, <b>to</b> <b>inflate</b> {{the number of troops}} in the region by creating fictional divisions. By 1943 the use of notional formations had proved a useful part of deception operations, such as Operation Rayon, and the practice formed the basis for key parts of Bodyguard. The Allies invaded Italy in September 1943 {{and by the end of}} the year had occupied most of the south of the country. Thirty-eight divisions were deployed across the Mediterranean theatre, mostly in Italy with some in North Africa.|$|E
5|$|Many of Bond's adversaries {{meet their}} deaths {{at the hands}} of Bond who often uses his {{environment}} or equipment to kill his opponent. Mr. Big was killed when Bond force-fed him a pellet of compressed gas, causing him <b>to</b> <b>inflate</b> and explode whilst Hugo Drax was ejected into outer space. Very few villains actually survive the course of Bond's assignment, and their deaths often come in the final scenes of the film. Lindner has noted that a number of the villains or henchmen have met their deaths through Bond using the technology of the villains against themselves and these include Alec Trevelyan being speared by part of the communications dish, Elliot Carver impaled by his sea-drill and Renard skewered by a nuclear fuel rod.|$|E
50|$|The Tripteroceratidae is {{a family}} of depressed, {{straight}} to slightly curved nautiloid cephalopods from {{the middle and upper}} Ordovician with generally flattened venters and empty siphuncles with straight <b>to</b> <b>inflated</b> sedments included in the Oncocerida (Sweet, 1964).|$|R
50|$|However, the government's {{policies}} (lower taxes, increased spending) {{meant the}} government had trouble with its finances and had <b>to</b> resort <b>to</b> <b>inflating</b> the currency {{in order to pay}} its debts. Runaway inflation might have doomed the Republic entirely on its own, but it also faced military threats.|$|R
50|$|The {{most ancient}} {{examples}} of primitive life jackets {{can be traced}} back <b>to</b> <b>inflated</b> bladders of animal skins or hollow, sealed gourds, for support when crossing deep streams and rivers. Purpose-designed buoyant safety devices consisting of simple blocks of wood or cork were used by Norwegian seamen.|$|R
5|$|The {{aquaculture}} {{potential for}} sand whiting was first investigated {{in the late}} 1980s, {{with a number of}} reports detailing both successful trials and also a number of problems with such trials. A 1988 study showed that sand whiting were more likely to grow in captivity than other whiting species, but the mortality rate of over 50% was unacceptable for use in an economic setting. A number of problems with diseases such as ulcerative dermatitis and the failure of the swim-bladder <b>to</b> <b>inflate</b> properly were also documented, however many of these initial problems have been overcome, and some facilities are breeding around 2000 larvae with a 95% survival rate. Some of these fingerlings are used to restock depleted estuaries, while others form the basis of commercial fish crops.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland's {{enduring}} {{reputation as}} chief executive and his recent pronouncements on the monetary issues made him a leading contender for the Democratic nomination. His leading opponent was David B. Hill, a Senator for New York. Hill united the anti-Cleveland elements of the Democratic party—silverites, protectionists, and Tammany Hall—but was unable to create a coalition large enough to deny Cleveland the nomination. Despite some desperate maneuvering by Hill, Cleveland was nominated on the first ballot at the convention in Chicago. For vice president, the Democrats chose to balance the ticket with Adlai E. Stevenson of Illinois, a silverite. Although the Cleveland forces preferred Isaac P. Gray of Indiana for vice president, they accepted the convention favorite. As a supporter of greenbacks and Free Silver <b>to</b> <b>inflate</b> the currency and alleviate economic distress in the rural districts, Stevenson balanced the otherwise hard-money, gold-standard ticket headed by Cleveland.|$|E
5|$|The {{couple had}} still been in debt {{at the time of}} Blanchard's death, so to {{minimise}} her expenses Sophie was as frugal as possible in her choice of balloon. She used a hydrogen-filled gas balloon (or Charlière), as it allowed her to ascend in a basket little bigger than a chair, and there was no requirement for the volume of material necessary for a hot air balloon. A hydrogen balloon also freed her from having to tend a fire to keep the craft airborne. Because she was small and light, she was able to cut back on the amount of gas used <b>to</b> <b>inflate</b> the balloon. Sophie had used, or at least owned, a hot air balloon; Colonel Francis Maceroni recorded in his memoirs that she sold it to him in 1811 for £40.|$|E
50|$|Although Solheim {{concludes that}} his {{reconstruction}} is 'largely hypothetical', his overstatement {{of the results}} of Gorman's excavation has led <b>to</b> <b>inflated</b> claims of Hoabinhian agriculture. These claims have detracted from the significance of Spirit Cave as a site with well-preserved evidence of human subsistence and palaeoenvironmental conditions during the Hoabinhian.|$|R
50|$|An {{inflatable}} {{air cushion}} is {{a bag of}} fabric or plastic that can be <b>inflated</b> <b>to</b> provide cushioning. Unlike Bubble Wrap, inflatable air cushions have a check valve to allow the cushion <b>to</b> be <b>inflated</b> or sometimes deflated.|$|R
50|$|Cephalon: Opisthoparian facial sutures. Early forms {{tend to have}} tapering, conical {{glabella}} with furrows extending far backwards {{while later}} forms with glabella expanding forwards <b>to</b> <b>inflated</b> frontal lobe. The hypostome is conterminant (e.g., Redlichia) or natant (e.g., Dolerolenus). The rostral plate is narrower than in suborder Olenellina, bound by rostral and connective sutures.|$|R
5|$|For example, (using {{the first}} formula (1) for {{absolute}} maximum breathing time), a diver {{at a depth}} of 15 meters in water with an average density of 1020kg/m³ (typical seawater), who breathes at a rate of 20 litres per minute, using a dive cylinder of 18 litres pressurized at 200 bars, can breathe for a period of 72 minutes before the cylinder pressure falls so low as to prevent inhalation. In some open circuit scuba systems this can happen quite suddenly, from a normal breath to the next abnormal breath, a breath which may not be fully drawn. (There is never any difficulty exhaling). The suddenness of this effect depends on the design of the regulator and the internal volume of the cylinder. In such circumstances there remains air under pressure in the cylinder, but the diver is unable to breathe it. Some of it can be breathed if the diver ascends, as the ambient pressure is reduced, and even without ascent, in some systems a bit of air from the cylinder is available <b>to</b> <b>inflate</b> buoyancy compensator devices (BCDs) even after it no longer has pressure enough to open the demand valve.|$|E
5|$|The Sideling Hill Tunnel's {{original}} plans {{date back}} to the year 1881, when surveying for the South Pennsylvania Railroad began. Construction began that year, with the plans for nine brand-new tunnels, most of which were drilled by 1885. The Sideling Hill Tunnel was built before December 1884 by John O'Brien, an engineer from Rhinebeck, New York. On July 6, 1885, a blast occurred {{at the end of the}} Sideling Hill Tunnel. The blast, which was caused by dynamite, claimed the lives of three people, including O'Brien. Several other people were injured in the blast. Just sixteen days later, another blast occurred in the tunnel, taking the lives of a Hungarian worker, along with two African-Americans, two Italians, and one Irishman. The bodies were so cut by the rocks during the blast, that the people were almost unidentifiable. Unfortunately William H. Vanderbilt, who had started the plans for the railroad, noticed that expenses began <b>to</b> <b>inflate,</b> and he began to look for a second way to work things out. The construction was abandoned and never finished. In 1938, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission took over the entire grade of the abandoned railway.|$|E

5000|$|In 2000, Kruger and Dunning {{were awarded}} an Ig Nobel Prize, in satirical {{recognition}} of the scientific work recorded in [...] "their modest report", [...] "Unskilled and Unaware of It: How Difficulties in Recognizing One's Own Incompetence Lead <b>to</b> <b>Inflated</b> Self-Assessments", about the cognitive bias of competence by way of illusory superiority.|$|R
40|$|Failure {{to account}} for family {{structure}} within populations or in complex mating designs via uninformed applications of permutation testing will lead <b>to</b> <b>inflated</b> type I error rates. Careful consideration of the design factors is essential since some situations allow several valid permutation strategies, and the choice that maximizes statistical power will not always be intuitive...|$|R

50|$|At {{this time}} the African slave trade to Hispaniola and Cuba was just beginning, in order to supply labor for the mines and for sugar production. Bishop Ramírez did not oppose this slave trade, which was {{considered}} necessary at the time. He did oppose monopolies in the slave trade that led <b>to</b> <b>inflated</b> prices.|$|R
25|$|Despite federal {{cost-cutting}} regulations, Pruitt–Igoe initially cost $36 million, 60% above {{national average}} for public housing. Conservatives attributed cost overruns <b>to</b> <b>inflated</b> unionized labor wages and the steamfitters union influence {{that led to}} installation of an expensive heating system; overruns on the heating system caused a chain of arbitrary cost cuts in other vital parts of the building.|$|R
50|$|Maytas was {{promoted}} by the family of Ramalinga Raju. In 2009, Raju sensationally confessed <b>to</b> <b>inflating</b> profits and revenue at his company was jailed. Thursday’s announcement concludes the government's nearly two-year-long search to find another owner for all the three companies and stabilise their operations. Thursday's order strips the Raju family of control in the firm.|$|R
