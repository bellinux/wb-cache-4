25|$|The 1841 census {{showed a}} {{population}} of just over eight million. Two-thirds of those depended on agriculture for their survival, but they rarely received a working wage.

This was the system which forced Ireland and its peasantry into monoculture, since only the potato could be grown in sufficient quantity.

25|$|Flags are {{particularly}} important at sea, where they can mean <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>life</b> and death, and consequently where {{the rules and regulations}} for the flying of flags are strictly enforced. A national flag flown at sea is known as an ensign. A courteous, peaceable merchant ship or yacht customarily flies its ensign (in the usual ensign position), together with the flag of whatever nation it is currently visiting at the mast (known as a courtesy flag). To fly one's ensign alone in foreign waters, a foreign port or {{in the face of a}} foreign warship traditionally indicates a willingness to fight, with cannon, for the right to do so.

25|$|The combatants {{were very}} close together, but never close enough for grappling, {{probably}} because Captain Jones knew of the extra men hidden below decks on Drake. As well as the great guns, both sides were firing small arms at each other, and here, too, Drake was at a disadvantage. The ship's magazine lacked cartridge paper; and when the musketeers ran out of cartridges, they had to laboriously load their guns by pouring in {{the right amount of}} powder, then putting in the shot. Musket balls were passed round in the armourer's hat, and two powder horns were shared between all the men on duty. With the other side much better organised, such inefficiency meant <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>life</b> and death. Drake killed just one of Jones's crew, Lieutenant Samuel Wallingford, by musket fire; another two—who were firing from positions in the mast tops—died as the by-product of a broadside. Five of Drake crew were killed, including, just under an hour into the fight, Captain Burdon himself, struck in the head by a musket ball. With both the captain and lieutenant out of action, command of Drake passed to the master, John Walsh.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{the charge}} of {{vandalism}} in climbing is more often a disagreement about the appropriateness of drilling and placing permanent bolts and other anchors. Although new fixed anchors are rarely placed by climbers, their dependency on the existing fixed anchors results in <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>life</b> and death. But the existing anchors remain on the climbing structure {{for long periods of}} time, changing the dynamic of the structure itself. Due to the permanent impact of the fixed anchors in wilderness areas, it was prohibited by the Wilderness Act. However, in 1990, there was a movement by the Forest Service and the Task Group to change the regulations to where fixed anchors would be allowed but still regulated in wilderness areas. These improvements lead to protection for both the climbers and the Wilderness Act. Typically in the USA, the first ascensionists decide where to place protection on a new route and later climbers are supposed to live with these choices. This can cause friction and retro-bolting when the route is perceived to be dangerous to climbers who actually lead at the grade of the climb, since the first ascensionists often lead at a higher grade and therefore don't require as much protection. Failing to properly design a new route at its grade is considered arrogant and very poor form. Even in strongholds of rock-climbing tradition like Yosemite National Park, many routes are being gradually upgraded to safer standards of protection.|$|E

Living in a partnership strengthens the loss in identity utility of men, but weakens that of women. Unemployment of a person's partner reduces the identity loss of unemployed men, but raises it for women. These results suggest that the unemployed's feeling of identity is affected by traditional gender roles, while this {{does not seem to be}} the case for the affective part of their subjective well-being...|$|R

Wright says that Tonio shows more deliberate control in his manipulation of the other characters in order to obtain his revenge upon Nedda, after she has rejected him, and is more aware of the demarcation between life and art. By contrast, Canio is unaware of the behind-the-scenes manipulations and surrenders control of his perception of <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> <b>life</b> and art as the opera proceeds.|$|E

Using mortality models and historical data for Sweden, we examine the effect of mortality changes over time. Our results indicate that the widening of the gap <b>between</b> the two <b>life</b> expectancies is primarily a consequence of the dramatic mortality decline at older ages that occurred during the twentieth century. These results imply that the divergence between the two measures is likely to become even greater in the future as reductions in deaths are concentrated at older ages. age-specific decomposition, cohort life expectancy, gap and lag, life expectancy, mortality models, period life expectancy...|$|R
