5|$|One of the {{original}} slogans of the Whopper advertised by Burger King was There are 1024 ways to have a Whopper; the claim {{is based on an}} exponential function of whether the sandwich has <b>the</b> <b>ingredient</b> or not, represented by a binary number of 0 or 1, raised to the power of number of possible ingredients at the time, ten, thus 210 =1,024. This claim was later expanded to There are 221,184 possible ways for a customer to order a Whopper sandwich. Other slogans include It takes two hands to handle a Whopper and Burger King: Home of the Whopper.|$|E
5|$|Then, as they {{approached}} their target, the MiG-21 pilots would make a supersonic diving pass against trailing or isolated flights, so they could position themselves for a missile kill. The action of 23 August demonstrated that the North Vietnamese Air Force had successfully executed their new procedure, which was helped by more skilful ground controllers who directed the MiG fighter towards their targets. Indeed, the new procedure gave North Vietnamese MiG pilots <b>the</b> <b>ingredient</b> they needed to achieve a kill over their U.S. opponents; between August 1967 and February 1968, the North Vietnamese Air Force achieved a kill ratio of 1.1:1 against the USAF, {{with the loss of}} 20 aircraft for 22 victories. In the same period of time, Operation Rolling Thunder had cost the United States approximately $900million ($5,640million at 2010 prices) with the loss of more than 700 aircraft. The bombing campaign continued until 31 October 1968, when it was abandoned by the U.S. Government.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> active <b>ingredient</b> in a {{formulation}} {{represents a}} very {{small portion of the}} overall tablet, then the challenge is to ensure that each tablet has the same amount of active <b>ingredient.</b> Sometimes, blending <b>the</b> <b>ingredients</b> is not enough. <b>The</b> active <b>ingredient</b> may segregate from <b>the</b> other <b>ingredients</b> in <b>the</b> blending process. <b>The</b> <b>ingredients</b> may be incompatible because of particle size, particle density, flow characteristics, compressibility, and moisture content. These incompatibilities can cause problems such as segregation during blending or during transfer of the product to the press as well as separation of the active on the tablet press.

In 2010, according to the FDA, the average American consumed 5.8grams of trans fat per day (2.6% of energy intake). Monoglycerides and diglycerides are not considered fats by the FDA, despite their nearly equal calorie per weight contribution during actual ingestion.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>ingredient</b> or monomer is {{ethylene}} (IUPAC name ethene), a {{gaseous hydrocarbon}} with the formula C2H4, {{which can be}} viewed as a pair of methylene groups (––) connected to each other. Because the compound is highly reactive, the ethylene must be of high purity. Typical specifications are <5 ppm for water, oxygen, and other alkenes. Acceptable contaminants include N2, ethane (common precursor to ethylene), and methane. Ethylene is usually produced from petrochemical sources, but also is generated by dehydration of ethanol.|$|E

25|$|The name {{polyethylene}} {{comes from}} <b>the</b> <b>ingredient</b> {{and not the}} resulting chemical compound, which contains no double bonds. The scientific name polyethene is systematically derived from the scientific name of the monomer. The alkene monomer converts to a long, sometimes very long, alkane in the polymerization process. In certain circumstances {{it is useful to}} use a structure-based nomenclature; in such cases IUPAC recommends poly(methylene) (poly(methanediyl) is a non-preferred alternative). The difference in names between the two systems is due to the opening up of the monomer's double bond upon polymerization. The name is abbreviated to PE. In a similar manner polypropylene and polystyrene are shortened to PP and PS, respectively. In the United Kingdom the polymer is commonly called polythene, from the ICI trade name, although this is not recognized scientifically.|$|E
