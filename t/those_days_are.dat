500|$|Critics of The Wild Bunch {{noted the}} theme {{of the end of the}} outlaw gunfighter era. Pike Bishop says, [...] "We've got to start {{thinking}} beyond our guns. <b>Those</b> <b>days</b> <b>are</b> closing fast." [...] The Bunch live by an anachronistic code of honor without a place in 20th-century society. When they inspect Gen. Mapache's new automobile, they perceive it marks the end of horse travel, a symbol also in Peckinpah's Ride the High Country (1962) and The Ballad of Cable Hogue (1970).|$|E
500|$|Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly {{awarded the}} album a [...] "B-" [...] grade, opining that, [...] "the peaks on Neighborhoods — their first disc {{in eight years}} — {{do little more than}} recall past triumphs. Outside of some latent goth leanings ('This Is Home') and a gauzy detour ('Ghost on the Dance Floor'), it's mostly twitch-crunch-whine-repeat." [...] Michael Brown of Drowned in Sound gave a mixed review, {{awarding}} the album a lukewarm five out of ten. He critiqued that, [...] "Blink have the potential for much more than their past reputation may convey, but Neighborhoods is reminiscent of that first awkward conversation after a heated argument, as no-one's quite sure where to go next." [...] Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone gave the album three stars out of five, noting elements of sophistication, introspection, and darkness in the music and lyrics and commenting that [...] "Some Clinton-era pants-dropping might've been a fun nostalgia move. But <b>those</b> <b>days</b> <b>are</b> gone; it's their early-2010s nightmare as much as anyone else's." [...] Kyle Ryan of The A.V. Club was critical of DeLonge's vocals, saying that he [...] "sounds flat as ever, and has a fondness for clunky lyrics", concluding that [...] "Although Blink-182 has long since left its past as a bare-bones punk band behind, overwrought rock isn't its forte, either. Neighborhoods finds a nice balance between the two, but it could still use a little less fussiness." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine considered it uninspired: [...] "When they try to add relatively ambitious elements to the things they actually do well, Blink-182 is more successful. [...] It's admirable that Blink-182 tries to challenge themselves over the course of Neighborhoods, but their growing pains don't make for a particularly good album or a welcome comeback." [...] Scott McLennan of The Boston Globe considered the album a step forward, summarizing, [...] "Blink-182 again delivers a record with nothing outright awful and enough dynamite songs to pack a punch at future tours." [...] Mikael Wood of Spin called the album [...] "surprisingly and refreshingly low-key," [...] but its self-examination [...] "comparatively adrift" [...] with the sound of their past.|$|E

2500|$|Smash Hits {{gave the}} album a rare 10 out of 10 rating, saying that [...] " [...] are {{overshadowed by the}} new {{material}} which demonstrates surprising versatility. [...] "Are You Ready" [...] and [...] "Twentieth Century Hero" [...] are obvious future hits, although one of the ballads [...] "Now <b>Those</b> <b>Days</b> <b>Are</b> Gone" [...] could easily combine a new credibility with chart success. Almost the perfect pop album". Album track [...] "Twentieth Century Hero" [...] was listed by another staff writer as the best song of the month. Record Mirrors Daniella Soave, who had reviewed their debut album less than favourably {{said that this was}} a big improvement. She complimented both the group on outstanding vocal performances and Andy Hill for production values. Both [...] "Love Dies Hard" [...] and [...] "Now <b>Those</b> <b>Days</b> <b>Are</b> Gone" [...] got favourable mentions, while [...] "Easy Love" [...] was [...] "a surprise" [...] and [...] "Breaking and Entering was [...] "tremendous and inventive". [...] Reviewing the album in The Daily Express, writer David Wigg said [...] " [...] Andy Hill can take a common everyday phrase and turn it into an infectious tune, dressed up with breathy harmonies and expansive production. The driving [...] "Another Night" [...] or [...] "Are You Ready" [...] are perfect examples of this technique. Nothing is spared to give the production zest". Continuing to give most credit to Hill, The Sunday Times said [...] "Andy Hill's catchy arrangements and slick production have produced a very fine album... {{there are quite a few}} more excellent tracks, especially [...] "Another Night" [...] and [...] "20th Century Hero", while [...] "Now <b>Those</b> <b>Days</b> <b>Are</b> Gone" [...] suggests that the group's vocal talent is a lot stronger than many of us imagined". Ireland's RTÉ Guide said of the album; [...] "Some [...] would never survive as singles but one or two are pretty excellent tracks – [...] "Twentieth Century Hero" [...] is a case in point" [...] and summed the album up as [...] "Good, straightforward pop music". In the US and Canada, eight tracks from this album were issued on their debut self-titled album in September 1982, including the single [...] "The Land of Make Believe". The Montreal Gazette praised the album highly in a review titled [...] "Bucks Fizz album gets top marks", commending the group on their vocal abilities and calling it [...] "high grade British pop".|$|E

2500|$|A third single, [...] "Now <b>Those</b> <b>Days</b> <b>Are</b> Gone" [...] was {{released}} from the album a month later.

2500|$|Bucks Fizz are a British pop {{group that}} {{achieved}} {{success in the}} 1980s, most notably for winning the 1981 Eurovision Song Contest with the song [...] "Making Your Mind Up". The group was formed in January 1981 specifically for the contest and comprised four vocalists: Bobby G, Cheryl Baker, Mike Nolan and Jay Aston. They achieved instant attention with the dance routine which accompanied the song, involving a skirt-rip. The group went on to have a successful career around the world (albeit ignored in the United States), while the UK remained their biggest market, where they had three No.1 singles with [...] "Making Your Mind Up" [...] (1981), [...] "The Land of Make Believe" [...] (1981) and [...] "My Camera Never Lies" [...] (1982) {{and became one of}} the top-selling groups of the 1980s.

2500|$|Early in 1982 {{the group}} were awarded 'best group' at the Daily Mirror Rock and Pop awards {{ceremony}} {{and received a}} nomination at the Brit awards. In March they released their fifth single. [...] "My Camera Never Lies" [...] swiftly rose up the charts and became their third number one single. With this they became the first British group of the 1980s to score three number ones within a year. Further success followed in May with the group's second studio album Are You Ready which went Gold and became their first top ten album. This album received particularly good reviews including a 10 out of 10 rating in Smash Hits. Attempting diversity, an (almost) a cappella ballad was released as the next single. [...] "Now <b>Those</b> <b>Days</b> <b>Are</b> Gone" [...] gave the group another top ten hit, reaching number eight in the UK charts. Soon after this they were invited {{to appear before the}} Queen and Queen Mother in the annual Royal Variety Performance, performing an old show tune, [...] "You'll Never Walk Alone". Chart success continued with the release of the hit singles, [...] "If You Can't Stand the Heat" [...] and [...] "Run for Your Life". Bucks Fizz's third studio album Hand Cut was released in March 1983, becoming another top twenty hit and certified silver by the BPI. By this stage, although Bucks Fizz faced harsh criticism in the media for their lightweight pop image, the music press were acknowledging the group's highly polished performances and sturdy productions, gaining favourable mentions in the NME and Record Mirror. With an eye to harden their sound, the group's next single [...] "When We Were Young" [...] featured a heavy production and doom-laden lyrics. With a rock-style lead vocal by member Jay Aston, the single became one of the group's biggest hits, featuring in the top 20 of many European countries, including top ten in the UK and top five in France. Towards the end of 1983 however, it seemed that the group's success was beginning to dim as singles [...] "London Town" [...] and [...] "Rules of the Game" [...] failed to reach the top twenty— their first singles to miss. Along with these came the group's Greatest Hits album, which, whilst it reached the top thirty and remained on the charts for three months, fell short of expectations.|$|E
