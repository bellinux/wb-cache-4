25|$|On August 13, 1997, 50 protesters staged at {{a sit-in}} at Guam Airport, {{saying that the}} {{recovery}} of the dead was taking too long; <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> blankets and sheets of paper at the Korean Air counter.|$|E
25|$|Meshuchrarim, a {{group of}} freed slaves and their {{descendants}} brought by the Sepahardim, they had no communal rights and no synagogue of their own. <b>They</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> the floor or on the steps outside. In {{the first half of}} the 20th century, Abraham Barak Salem, a meshuchrar, successfully campaigned against this discrimination.|$|E
25|$|Instead {{of using}} furniture, <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> the floor, which {{was covered with}} two layers of mats, one of rush, the other of a water plant with long sword shaped leaves (Iris pseudacorus); and for beds they spread planks, hanging mats around them on poles, and {{employing}} skins for coverlets. The men used chopsticks when eating; the women had wooden spoons. Ainu cuisine is not commonly eaten outside Ainu communities; {{there are only a}} few Ainu-run restaurants in Japan, all located in Tokyo or Hokkaido, serving primarily Japanese fare.|$|E

25|$|As a consequence, certain traditions {{stated that}} popes {{throughout}} the medieval period {{were required to}} undergo a procedure wherein <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> a special chair {{with a hole in}} the seat. A cardinal would have the task of putting his hand up the hole to check whether the pope had testicles, or doing a visual examination. This procedure is not taken seriously by most historians, and there is no documented instance. It is probably a scurrilous legend based on the existence of two ancient stone chairs with holes in the seats that probably dated from Roman times and may have been used because of their ancient imperial origins. Their original purpose is obscure.|$|E
25|$|On December 30, 1909, while {{stationed}} in Chinatown, then Sergeant Coughlin and two partolman {{were ordered to}} keep Chinese comedian Ah Hoon under protective custody. Ah Hoon, {{a member of the}} On Leong Tong, had been threatened by the rival Hip Sings and Four Brothers for his refusal to ridicule the tong's during his performances. Coughlin and the other two officers accompanied Ah Hoon to the Chinese Theater where <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> stage throughout Ah Hoon's act and then escorted the comedian through an underground passageway back to his home in Chatham Square. Despite their precautions, Ah Hoon was found dead in his room the following morning becoming the first victim to fall during of the Tong wars.|$|E
25|$|On 2 August 1990, Saddam {{launched}} a military invasion onto neighboring Kuwait, reportedly {{due to its}} vast oil reserves, which would have helped him pay off the debts he owed to other countries during the Iran–Iraq War (see Gulf War). Within 24 hours, the Emir of Kuwait had fled. However, subsequently, an international coalition force consisting of American, British, Saudi and other troops liberated the country in 1991 and Iraqi troops were forced out of Kuwait (see Operation Desert Storm). Subsequently, {{one month after the}} Gulf War in February 1991, United States President George H. W. Bush called on the Iraqi people to stage an uprising against Saddam Hussein. This was followed by a series of rebellions {{in many parts of the}} country, such as the south by Shi'ite groups such as SCIRI and the Islamic Da'awa Party. Meanwhile, the Kurds in the north staged their own uprising for autonomy, under the leadership of Massoud Barzani, leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party, and Jalal Talabani, leader of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. The Peshmerga were trained into hardened guerrillas, who managed to infiltrate the Jash, a Saddam-orientated Kurdish militia (see Jash (term) and National Defense Battalions (Iraq)). The rebels soon managed to capture the town of Ranya, Sulaimaniya and ultimately the oil center of Kirkuk. Saddam retaliated swiftly, battering Kirkuk with artillery and targeting hospitals in particular. Geographically the towns captured by the Kurdish rebels were difficult to defend as <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> plains below mountains. The rebels were forced to retreat in the mountains, where reportedly the Iraqi helicopters threw flour of them (which was believed to be a grim legacy of the reputed powdery chemical weapons which were used by the Iraqi administration during the Al-Anfal Campaign).|$|E

500|$|The scene between Mark and Leslie at the pit was {{mirrored}} {{in the second}} season finale [...] "Freddy Spaghetti", which aired in May 2010 and was Mark's final appearance as a regular cast member. During that scene, the two overlook {{what was once the}} pit, but was now a filled-in lot, and Mark gives her construction plans for a park before kissing her goodbye on the cheek and leaving. Schur said of the scene, [...] "It's great because Leslie and Mark, it was such a disastrous moment last time (at the pit) and he didn't really respect her, and a lot's happened in a year." [...] Goor said of using that setting, [...] "I liked the symmetry of having it play a critical, and opposite role in this finale. Last year, <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> the bench and kissed, and it seemed like they might be getting back together. This year, <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> the bench and Mark kissed Leslie goodbye." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] was {{the final}} episode to include Paul Schneider in any {{capacity}} after his two seasons as regular cast member as Mark Brendanawicz. Schneider left the series, and though Schur claimed that both the producers and Schneider were interested in having him return for guest appearances in future episodes, Schneider stated {{that he was not}} interested in returning and had never been contacted about it. The final scene between Leslie and Mark in [...] "Freddy Spaghetti", in which the two sit together at Lot 48, mirrors their scenes together in the first season finale, [...] "Rock Show", in which the two shared a kiss while overlooking the lot while it was still a construction pit. Schur said of the scene, [...] "It's great because Leslie and Mark, it was such a disastrous moment last time (at the pit) and he didn't really respect her, and a lot's happened in a year." [...] Goor said of using that setting, [...] "I liked the symmetry of having it play a critical, and opposite role in this finale. Last year, <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> the bench and kissed, and it seemed like they might be getting back together. This year, <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> the bench and Mark kissed Leslie goodbye." [...] The bench they sit in during that scene is the same one <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> during their kiss scene in [...] "Rock Show". Throughout the second season, that bench was in Leslie's office. Schur said, [...] "We decided that in the reality of the show she brought it to the lot for this moment. It's {{a little bit of a}} stretch, but, you know." ...|$|E
500|$|In the past, {{when the}} {{cardinals}} were voting during the conclave, <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> canopied thrones symbolizing the cardinals' collective governance {{of the church}} {{during the period of}} sede vacante. Upon the acceptance by the new pope of his election, all other cardinals in attendance would each pull a cord and lower the canopies above their respective thrones signifying an end to the period of collective governance and only the newly elected pope's canopy remained unlowered. [...] The last time canopied thrones were used was during the 1963 conclave. Beginning with the 1978 August conclave canopied thrones were no longer used {{due to the lack of}} space resulting from the large increase in the number of cardinal electors.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hilda and I were {{considering}} {{a matter of}} which we will make thee judge," [...] said Erling, as <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>on</b> the bank together.|$|R

2500|$|In mid-June 1880, [...] "Buckskin" [...] Frank Leslie {{who had an}} eye for the ladies, escorted Mary Killen, the Commercial Hotel's housekeeper, to a dance. Accounts differ as {{to whether}} she was {{separated}} from her husband or still married to him. After the dance, <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> {{the porch of the}} Cosmopolitan Hotel and were spotted by her drunken husband. Killen appeared out of the dark street and shot at Leslie, barely missing him. Leslie fired back and shot Mike Killen twice. Mike Killen died five days later and was buried in Tombstone's Boot Hill cemetery on June 22, 1880. Buckskin Frank Leslie had fired in self-defense and wasn't arrested.|$|E
2500|$|More {{renovation}} – and a {{round of}} controversy – came after the 1938 season when Mack sought to install light towers for night play, which local residents were against. They objected in general to the light, noise and traffic that night games would bring to the neighborhood, and objected specifically to the danger of home run balls hitting them as <b>they</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> their porches and {{to the ability of}} fans in the upper decks to peer into their bedrooms at night. The matter went to court, and Mack hired a young Philadelphia lawyer to plead his case. The presentation of young Richardson Dilworth, future mayor of the city, carried the day: the A's won the case and the light towers went up in time for the 1939 season. The first night game in the AL was at Shibe Park on May 16, 1939: the Indians beat the A's, 8–3.|$|E
2500|$|A Shaker {{village was}} divided into groups or [...] "families." [...] The leading group in each village was the Church Family, and it was {{surrounded}} by satellite families that were often named for points on the compass rose. Each village was governed by a leadership team consisting of two men (Elders) and two women (Eldresses). [...] Shakers lived together as brothers and sisters. Each house was divided so {{that men and women}} did most things separately. They used different staircases and doors. <b>They</b> <b>sat</b> <b>on</b> opposite sides of the room in worship, at meals, and in [...] "union meetings" [...] held to provide supervised socialization between the sexes. However, the daily business of a Shaker village required the brethren and sisters to interact. Though there was a division of labor between men and women, they also cooperated in carrying out many tasks, such as harvesting apples, food production, laundry, and gathering firewood.|$|E
