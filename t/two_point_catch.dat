50|$|The {{setting was}} the first K-1 WGP {{qualifier}} event in Auckland, New Zealand. During the fight the smaller Aerts took the fight to the mighty Schilt and looked to actually cause the defending champion some problems. Yet what gave Schilts a bigger problem was the “no clinch” rule as he was warned numerous times about clinching with Aerts and ultimately lost <b>two</b> <b>points.</b> The <b>catch</b> was that during the fight Schilt was not clinching {{nearly as much as}} his opponent Aerts, yet it seemed the referee would ignore Aerts violation of the rule and continuously cite Schilts. In the end the fight went to a decision and it came to a majority ruling in favor of Peter Aerts (with one of the judges ruling it a draw and two of the judges giving Aerts a slight advantage of 29-28). In the end those <b>two</b> <b>points</b> that Schilt’s lost would have made a BIG difference in the outcome, possible even giving Schilts the win. This would not be the first controversial ruling of the year but definitely one of the big ones.|$|R
50|$|Edge of Doom - In {{the first}} round, one player must shoot 15 foam darts using a special falcon {{catapult}} on a floating platform {{in the water}} into a goal that is {{near the edge of}} the waterfall, while the other player defends the goal with a fishing net used to catch the darts. The player shooting gets one point if they get a dart in the net, and the defender gets <b>two</b> <b>points</b> if they <b>catch</b> a dart with the net. After one player has used up all their darts, they swap places. The player with the most points wins. In the second round, one team of four contestants use the falcon shooter with 25 foam darts, while a player from the other team is being pulled from the edge of the water by three other teammates. The team with the most points wins.|$|R
5000|$|The {{second type}} of derail is the [...] "split rail" [...] type. These are {{basically}} a complete or partial railroad switch which directs the errant rolling stock away from the main line. This form is common throughout the UK, where it is called trap <b>points</b> or <b>catch</b> <b>points.</b>|$|R
50|$|The use of <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> became {{widespread}} in the United Kingdom after the Abergele rail disaster (1868), where runaway wagons containing paraffin oil (kerosene) collided with an express train. <b>Catch</b> <b>points</b> continued {{to be used in}} the UK until the mid-20th century. At this time, continuous automatic brakes, which automatically stop any vehicles separated from their train, were widely adopted, making <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> largely obsolete.|$|R

50|$|At a {{small number}} of {{locations}} on single track lines in Britain, interlaced loops had been provided where sprung <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> were required because of the steep gradient.

Trains running uphill were routed via the loop incorporating the sprung <b>catch</b> <b>point.</b> Trains running downhill used the opposite loop, bypassing the <b>catch</b> <b>point.</b>|$|R

50|$|It is {{not unusual}} for hunters to utilize both bay and catch dogs in the same hunt. Bay dogs are used to find the boar, {{initiate}} the chase, and pursue the quarry. Sometimes the boar will run from the bay dogs at first, but {{at some point during the}} chase either stop to fight or become cornered. At this <b>point</b> <b>catch</b> dogs are released to keep the boar stationary for the hunter.|$|R

Introduction A planar set is called a <b>two</b> <b>point</b> set if every line intersects the set in exactly <b>two</b> <b>points</b> and a partial <b>two</b> <b>point</b> set if every line intersects the set in at most <b>two</b> <b>points.</b> We call a partial <b>two</b> <b>point</b> set extendable {{if it is a}} subset of some <b>two</b> <b>point</b> set. The existence of <b>two</b> <b>point</b> sets is due to Mazurkiewicz [7]. His proof shows that every partial <b>two</b> <b>point</b> set with cardinality less than c is extendable.

50|$|Run-off {{points are}} used to protect main lines from stray or runaway {{railroad}} cars or from trains passing signals set at danger. In these cases, vehicles would otherwise roll onto and obstruct a main line (sometimes known as fouling) and cause an accident. Depending {{on the situation in}} which they are used, run-off points are referred to either as trap <b>points</b> or <b>catch</b> <b>points.</b> Derailers are another device used for the same purpose.|$|R

5000|$|Why is 2PD {{unreliable}} as {{a measure}} of tactile spatial acuity? It has long been recognized that, if not pressed precisely simultaneously, <b>two</b> <b>points</b> may evoke temporally distinguishable neural activations; <b>two</b> <b>points</b> may be distinguished from one, then, not because <b>two</b> <b>points</b> are perceived spatially, but because two contacts are perceived temporally. Furthermore, neurophysiological recordings have shown that <b>two</b> <b>points</b> evoke a different number of action potentials in the receptor population than one <b>point</b> does; <b>two</b> <b>points</b> may be distinguished from one, then, not because <b>two</b> <b>points</b> are actually perceived, but merely because the two-point configuration produces a different overall response magnitude. [...] In summary, the two-point task can present both a non-spatial temporal cue and a non-spatial magnitude cue. To an observant participant, these unintended non-spatial cues could signal the presence of <b>two</b> <b>points</b> compared to one, even when the points are placed closer together than the participant's spatial resolution.|$|R

50|$|Because <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> {{are rarely}} needed, {{it is not}} always clear whether they will in fact derail a runaway train {{effectively}} and as safely as possible. For example, use of Castle Cary <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> would result in the train being directed into a footbridge. Use of <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> to derail a train that had passed a signal at danger at London Paddington station in June 2016 resulted in the empty train, a British Rail Class 165, hitting and severely damaging an overhead line electrification stanchion, causing all services to and from the station to be halted for hours.|$|R
50|$|<b>Catch</b> <b>points</b> are {{installed}} on the running line itself, where the railway climbs at a steep gradient. They are used to prevent runaway vehicles colliding with another train further down the slope. In some cases, <b>catch</b> <b>points</b> lead into a sand drag to safely stop the runaway vehicle, which may be travelling at some speed. <b>Catch</b> <b>points</b> are usually held in the 'derail' position by a spring. They can be set to allow a train to pass safely in the downhill direction using a lever or other mechanism to override the spring for a short time.|$|R
