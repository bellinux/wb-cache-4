When Flanders discovers that Homer {{is the one who}} has been duping him into committing murder (by way of a Bible-shaped receiver), Homer argues that God does not exist and starts burning Ned's bible, only to be stopped and strangled to death by God Himself. Marge begs God to reverse everything that has happened, but God tells her that Satan is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> running the world. When Flanders thinks that this scenario cannot get any worse, it is revealed that Satan is sleeping with Ned's deceased wife, Maude.|$|E

50|$|Well, {{nothing is}} as it seems. A happy marriage, {{a husband and wife}} that love each other, a mother and father {{protective}} of their children. No doubts, no lies and a trusting relationship. There are three types of women: <b>The</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> married to their Home, <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> married to their children, and <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> married to their husband.

25|$|Rousseau {{turns to}} the topic of love, which, he says, is in the realm of women. Women {{naturally}} have power over men via resistance in the area of relationships and this power can be extended to the play, where women can have the same control over the audience. This extension of the empire of women is against natural order. Rousseau refers to ancient Sparta, where the most virtuous and appreciated women were those who were modest and generally not spoken about. In the decadence of France, Rousseau claims the most esteemed woman is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> most social, most talked about, judgmental and authoritative.|$|E

As it looks like a wedding will take place and that Serena is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> getting married, Blair and Georgina tell the truth about who Serena is, ruining the wedding of two men; Serena was only a maid of honor.

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, some {{branches}} of Christianity oppose cremation, including some minority Protestant groups and Orthodox. Most notably, the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches forbid cremation, as a custom, but not dogmatically. Exceptions {{are made for}} circumstances where {{it may not be}} avoided (when civil authority demands it, or epidemics) or if it may be sought for good cause, but when a cremation is willfully chosen for no good cause by <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> deceased, he or she is not permitted a funeral in the church and may also be permanently excluded from liturgical prayers for the departed. In Orthodoxy, cremation is perceived by some a rejection of the dogma of the general resurrection.|$|E

25|$|Dexter invents the Rude Removal System, {{a machine}} {{to remove the}} rudeness from his sister Dee Dee. However, Dee Dee thinks Dexter is <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> rude. They start {{fighting}} and both {{wind up in the}} machine. Inadvertently, the Rude Removal System is activated, splitting the pair into well-behaved and rude halves. The rude pair use profanity or coarse language and harbor destructive tendencies. They proceed to insult their mother and destroy the house and Dexter's lab. Dexter and Dee Dee trick their rude halves back into the Rude Removal System and reverse the process, combining the rude and polite halves and resolving the problem. The segment ends with Dexter and Dee Dee's mother holding a bar of soap, poised to wash the filthy words from their mouths.|$|E
25|$|This runestone is {{also called}} the Bro Runestone after the church by which it is located. It is raised by the same aristocratic family as the Ramsund carving and the Kjula Runestone, which allows {{scholars}} to study {{the family of the}} Hakon Jarl who is mentioned on this runestone. He is considered to have been Swedish and his son Özurr may have been responsible for organizing the local defense organization against raiders on the shores of lake Mälaren. However, the only recorded organization of such a defence is from England and consequently both this Hakon Jarl and his son Özurr may have been active in England in the Þingalið instead. Omeljan Pritsak argues that this Hakon is the same as <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> mentioned on the Södra Betby Runestone and whose son Ulf was in the west, i.e. in England. This Swedish Hakon Jarl would then actually be the Norwegian Hákon Eiríksson.|$|E

25|$|The word waswās in waswāsi l-ḫannās {{means the}} one who whispers {{over and over again}}, and waswasa means to whisper into someone's heart an evil {{suggestion}} {{over and over again in}} such a way or ways that <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> being inspired may not feel that the whisperer is whispering an evil suggestion into his heart. Waswasa by itself suggests repetition just as zalzala contains the meaning of repetitive movement. Since man is not tempted by just one attempt but effort has to be made over and over again to seduce and tempt him, such an attempt is called waswasa and the tempter waswās. As for the word ḫannās, it is derived from ḫunus, which means to hide after appearing and to retreat after coming into view. Since ḫannās is the intensive form, it would imply {{the one who}} behaves thus very frequently. Thus when once he fails in his attempt to whisper evil, he withdraws, then he again returns to make the second and the third and the next attempt over and over again.|$|E
