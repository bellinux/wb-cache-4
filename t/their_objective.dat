5|$|Scheduled {{to land at}} 11:00 on Jig, the 56th Infantry Brigade was re-routed King, {{because the}} gun battery at Le Hamel was still operational. They {{proceeded}} towards <b>their</b> <b>objective</b> of Bayeux. 151st Brigade arrived {{at the same time}} and after meeting fierce resistance, they achieved <b>their</b> <b>objective</b> of controlling the road and railway between Bayeux and Caen. 56th Brigade made slow progress and had to dig in for the night some distance from Bayeux. 69th Brigade secured the eastern flank and by nightfall made contact with the Canadian forces on Juno.|$|E

Here the {{division}} halted until early in September, when they returned to England to prepare for further airborne operations later in the war.|$|E

5|$|A regimental {{group of}} the 7th SS Division was to advance west from the area of Mrkonjić Grad, break through Partisan {{resistance}} east of the Sana and then advance on a wide front to block escape routes east out of Drvar. Part of this group was to advance from Jajce along the rail line and roads through Savici to reach <b>their</b> <b>objective,</b> the area around Mliniste power station.|$|E
5|$|All {{but one of}} the ten gliders {{carrying}} the airborne troops assigned to Group Iron were able to land next to <b>their</b> <b>objective,</b> the bridge at Kanne. Due to a navigation error by the pilots of the transport aircraft towing the gliders, one of the gliders was dropped in the wrong area. The other nine gliders were towed through heavy anti-aircraft fire and released at 05:35. As the gliders began to descend towards <b>their</b> <b>objective,</b> the bridge was destroyed by several demolition explosions set off by the Belgian garrison. Unlike the garrisons of the other two bridges, the Belgian defenders at Kanne had been forewarned, as the German mechanized column heading for the bridge to reinforce Group Iron arrived twenty minutes ahead of schedule. Its appearance ruined any chance of a surprise assault and gave the defenders sufficient time to destroy the bridge. As the gliders came in to land, one was hit by anti-aircraft fire and crashed into the ground killing most of the occupants. The remaining eight landed successfully, and the airborne troops stormed the Belgian positions and eliminated the defenders.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the first}} day's {{landings}} on 17September were successful, over {{the night of}} 17–18September, divisional commander Major-General Roy Urquhart was reported missing so Brigadier Philip Hicks of 1st Airlanding Brigade assumed command of the division on September18. Subsequent problems in Arnhem forced Hicks to change the divisional plan. Only the 2nd Parachute Battalion had reached the road bridge as strong German defences had stopped the other battalions. Hicks decided that the 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment and 11 Para would link up with the 1st Parachute Brigade {{in an attempt to}} reach <b>their</b> <b>objective.</b>|$|E

5|$|Due to {{his having}} overtly {{undermined}} the king, Armansperg was dismissed from his duties by King Otto immediately {{upon his return}} from Germany. However, despite high hopes {{on the part of}} the Greeks, the Bavarian Rudhart was appointed chief minister, and the granting of a constitution was again postponed. The attempts of Otto to conciliate Greek sentiment through efforts to enlarge the frontiers of his kingdom, for example, by the suggested acquisition of Crete in 1841, failed in <b>their</b> <b>objective,</b> and only succeeded in embroiling him in conflict with the Great Powers.|$|E
5|$|During {{the day the}} Fusiliers again {{assaulted}} Hill 217 {{from the}} south, and attempted {{to work their way}} around the eastern and western flanks of the feature. Despite preparation by the divisional artillery and the 3 RAR Machine Gun Platoon firing their Vickers medium machine-guns in support from Maryang San, the Fusiliers were unable to make progress due to Chinese machine-guns located in bunkers at the top of <b>their</b> <b>objective.</b> Meanwhile, their flanking movements were also blocked by Chinese small arms and grenades. 1 RNF had now taken over 100 casualties during two days of fighting and by the afternoon they were a spent force. Sensing the Fusiliers' weakness, the Chinese then launched their own assault, forcing them to withdraw in contact. Previous plans for an assault on the Hinge had not occurred due to issues with resupply and the dangerous approach march that would have been required. Again, despite their efforts, the Fusiliers had failed to capture <b>their</b> <b>objective.</b> It seemed {{that the only way to}} finally secure Hill 217 was along the ridge from Hill 317, via the Hinge, and as such the Australians would be tasked with capturing the Hinge the following day. B Company was subsequently allocated the attack. In preparation, they ascended Hill 317 late in the afternoon of 6 October, finally securing the crest, and at last light joined 9 Platoon on the knoll northwest of the summit where they would form up the next day to conduct the assault.|$|E
5|$|On 23 December, Lieutenant-General Dempsey's XIII Corps {{launched}} a new attack to push back the German line from Orsogna. In the afternoon, the British 5th Infantry Division attacked on {{the right wing of}} the Corps front toward the Arielli stream. <b>Their</b> <b>objective</b> was to secure the flank of the 2nd New Zealand Division, which was in turn to attack northwest and west from the salient in order to roll up the Orsogna defences from the north.|$|E

That night they moved back across the Jordan, having suffered three dead and eleven wounded.|$|E

On 10 September 2013, Balotelli scored the winning goal in a World Cup {{qualifying}} match against the Czech Republic in Turin, which allowed Italy to clinch {{the first place}} spot in their qualifying group, and ultimately achieve <b>their</b> <b>objective</b> of qualifying for the 2014 World Cup. Balotelli finished the 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign as Italy's top scorer, with 5 goals, {{and he was also}} the top scorer of his qualifying group, helping Italy to win their group undefeated and qualify for the upcoming World Cup.|$|E
5|$|Operation Biting, {{also known}} as the Bruneval Raid, was the codename for a raid by Combined Operations in 1942. <b>Their</b> <b>objective</b> was a German Würzburg radar {{installation}} at Bruneval in France. Due to the extensive coastal defences erected by the Germans to protect the array, it was thought a commando raid from the sea would incur heavy losses, and give the garrison sufficient time for the radar equipment to be destroyed. It was therefore decided that an airborne assault followed by sea-borne evacuation would be the ideal way to surprise the garrison and seize the technology intact.|$|E

5|$|Operation Fustain, the division's second {{mission in}} Sicily, {{was carried out}} by the 1st Parachute Brigade. <b>Their</b> <b>objective</b> was the Primosole Bridge across the Simeto River. The {{intention}} was for the parachute brigade, with glider-borne forces in support, to land {{on both sides of the}} river. While one battalion seized the bridge, the other two battalions would establish defensive positions to the north and south. They would then hold the bridge until relieved by the advance of XIII Corps, part of the Eighth Army which had landed on the south eastern coast three days previously.|$|E
5|$|Operation Ladbroke was a glider {{assault by}} the 1st Airlanding Brigade near Syracuse, that began on 9July1943 {{as part of}} the {{invasion}} of Sicily. The brigade were equipped with 144 Waco and six Horsa gliders. <b>Their</b> <b>objective</b> was to land near the town of Syracuse, secure the Ponte Grande Bridge, and ultimately take control of the city itself with its strategically important docks.|$|E
5|$|Rome's {{preoccupation with}} its war with Carthage {{provided}} an opportunity for Philip V {{of the kingdom of}} Macedonia, located in the north of the Greek peninsula, to attempt to extend his power westward. Philip sent ambassadors to Hannibal's camp in Italy, to negotiate an alliance as common enemies of Rome. However, Rome discovered the agreement when Philip's emissaries were captured by a Roman fleet. The First Macedonian War saw the Romans involved directly in only limited land operations, but they ultimately achieved <b>their</b> <b>objective</b> of pre-occupying Philip and preventing him from aiding Hannibal.|$|E

5|$|The Allies {{considered}} Zeppelin to {{have achieved}} its main objective of tying down German {{forces in the}} region until after the invasion of Normandy, although it {{did not appear to}} convince German high command that major Allied landings would occur in the Mediterranean. Instead, Zeppelin helped the Allies achieve <b>their</b> <b>objective</b> by convincing the Germans of the threat of small invasions, stopping them from removing the defensive forces. According to Jacob Field, the operation successfully detained 25 divisions in defensive positions in the region.|$|E
