50|$|<b>Exterior</b> <b>cleaning</b> is {{the process}} of <b>cleaning</b> a building's <b>exterior,</b> {{including}} the restoration of good hygiene or removal of litter or dirt. Not to be confused with interior cleaning (e.g., office <b>cleaning),</b> <b>exterior</b> <b>cleaning</b> draws on aspects of environmental care, architecture preservation, and psychological well-being, in addition to traditional cleaning. In some jurisdictions, exterior cleaners must be licensed to practice, e.g. window cleaners require a license to operate in Scotland.|$|R

40|$|Montréal’s Henry Foss Hall Building, erected between 1964 and 1966, is a {{major element}} of today’s Concordia University campus and a rare example in Canada of a {{high-rise}} building to hold originally an entire university. For over forty years {{it has been an}} eye-catcher, a giant white block visible from quite a distance. In 1994 it went through an <b>exterior</b> <b>cleaning</b> procedure and in 2003 renovations were begun to rejuvenate the interior. Although for many years it was the focus of the university’s downtown campus, its architecture never attracted attention among the general public. By 2008, the seventh, eighth, eleventh, and twelfth floors had been reorganized and modernized. The other floors of the twelve storey building are to be renovated in the next few years...|$|R

The design solution was produced: 1) specifically for the Aichi Expo 2005 to show the possibilities of the new technologies and, subsequently, 2) to go into service in the local area. LINIMO {{is one of only}} two trains in the world developed and commercially operating that uses the linear motor magnetic levitation <b>train</b> technology. The <b>exterior</b> design development for the train required the design and engineering processes to progress simultaneously. The front and the back of the train unit was glass panelled from ceiling to the floor making this an original and novel design solution in the world of train design.

40|$|Obesity is {{epidemic}} in the U. S, {{and there is}} an imperative need to identify policy tools that may help fight this epidemic. A recent paper in the economics literature finds an inverse relationship between gasoline prices and obesity-risk [...] - suggesting that increased gasoline prices via higher gasoline taxes may have the effect of reducing obesity prevalence. This study builds upon that paper. It utilizes cross-sectional time-series data from the American Time Use Survey over 2003 - 2008, utilizes the increases that occurred in gasoline prices in this period due to Hurricane Katrina and to the global spike in gasoline prices as a ‘natural experiment’, and explores how time spent by Americans on different forms of physical activity is associated with gasoline price levels. 	Economic theory suggests that higher gasoline prices may alter individual behavior both via a ‘substitution effect’ whereby people seek alternatives to motorized transportation, and an ‘income effect’ whereby the effect of higher gasoline prices on the disposable family budget lead people to make various adjustments to what they spend money on. The latter may lead to some increase in physical activity (for example, doing one’s own yard work instead of hiring help), but may also lead to decreases in other physical activities that involve expenses, such as team sports or work-outs at the gym. Thus, ultimately, the relationship between gasoline prices and physical activity must be empirically determined. 	Results from multivariate regression models with state and time fixed-effects indicate that higher gasoline prices are associated with an overall increase of physical activity that is at least moderately energy intensive. The increases are most pronounced in periods where gasoline prices fluctuate more sharply. These results appear robust to a number of model specifications. One of the major components of this increase appear to be an increase in housework that is at least moderately energy intensive – such as interior and <b>exterior</b> <b>cleaning,</b> garden and yard work, etc. This tentatively suggests that there is an ‘income effect’ of higher gasoline prices. However, the increases in physical activity associated with increased gasoline prices are weaker among minorities and low socioeconomic status (SES) individuals. Hence, while a policy which increases gasoline prices via raised gasoline taxes may have benefits in terms of increasing overall physical activity levels in the U. S., one concern is that these benefits may not accrue to low SES individuals to the same extent as to their higher SES counterparts. ...|$|R

50|$|On average, about 51 train units depart {{and arrive}} at the station from {{different}} parts of the country everyday. Of the 102 trains, a 12 are sent during the day and another 7 at night to the Basin Bridge Train Care Centre for primary maintenance, which involves complete <b>exterior</b> and interior <b>cleaning</b> and total mechanical and electrical overhaul. The rest of the trains go through secondary maintenance or 'other-end attention' at the depot or 'turn back train attention' at Chennai Central itself. Secondary maintenance includes filling water, while the third is the 'other-end attention', in which the train, especially the toilets, is cleaned. The fourth category of trains, such as Sapthagiri Express and Pallavan Express, are turn-back trains, which arrive and leave in a short time from Chennai Central after toilet-cleaning and water-filling is done right at the terminus platform.|$|R
