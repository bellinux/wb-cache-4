40|$|Peer {{relations}} across 2 contexts (in {{school and}} after school) were examined for 577 participants, approximately 12 years old, from 3 middle schools in Milan, Italy. The primary research questions were: Do peer networks from different contexts uniquely contribute <b>to</b> <b>explaining</b> variance in individual behavior? Do measures of peer preference and peer network inclusion across contexts uniquely contribute <b>to</b> <b>explaining</b> individual depressive symptoms? Structural equation models showed {{that both the}} in-school and the after-school peer networks uniquely contributed <b>to</b> <b>explaining</b> variance in 2 types of individual problem behavior (in-school problem behavior, after-school delinquency), and that similarity with the 2 peer networks varied according to behaviors specific to each context and across gender. Finally, both in-school and after-school peer network inclusion contributed <b>to</b> <b>explaining</b> variance in depressive symptoms, after controlling for classroom peer preference...|$|R

5|$|It is {{probably}} worth noting, {{if only to}} avoid confusion, that such claims (much like those made by spiritualists that conjurors were unable <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> the phenomena) were often unfounded. For example, spiritualists claimed that Robert-Houdin had been unable <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> what happened at a Home seance, and critics claimed that Home had refused an invitation to perform in front of Robert-Houdin. There is, however, not a shred of evidence for either of these claims.|$|E
