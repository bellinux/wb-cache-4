5|$|Also, whilst {{productivity}} {{figures have}} improved, median incomes and stock market prices, {{and thus the}} returns to capital and labor, have not improved. Furthermore, government consumption (government activity excluding transfer payments) represents between 15–20% of GDP, but since the sector is measured at cost it becomes less and less productive as it grows larger. Thus, the more government consumption <b>there</b> <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> more published GDP figures tend to overestimate growth in living standards.|$|E

5|$|From {{the time}} of the ancient world, at least, plants have been {{classified}} in two ways. On the one hand <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> detached academic, philosophical or scientific interest in plants themselves: this groups plants by their relationship to one another according to their similarities and differences in structure and function. Then <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> practical, utilitarian or anthropocentric interest which groups plants according to their human use. Cultivated plant taxonomy is concerned with the special classification categories needed for the plants of agriculture, horticulture and forestry as regulated by the Cultivated Plant Code. This Code serves not only the scientific interests of formal nomenclature, it also caters for the special utilitarian needs of people dealing with the plants of commerce. Those cultigens given names governed by the Cultivated Plant Code fulfill three criteria: they have special features considered of sufficient importance to warrant a name; the special features are the result of deliberate human breeding or selection and are not found in wild populations (except in rare cases where the special features represent desirable part of natural variation found in wild populations that is not covered by a scientific name); it is possible to perpetuate the desirable features by propagation in cultivation.|$|E
5|$|Over the years, botanical gardens, as {{cultural}} and scientific organisations, {{have responded to}} the interests of botany and horticulture.
