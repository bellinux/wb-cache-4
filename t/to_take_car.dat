40|$|Recycling is not {{a luxury}} or a fashion but a {{necessity}} {{that comes from a}} very simple fact: we live in a limited world. Contrary to what we have believed for a long time, our human activity is not infinitely expandable but limited in terms of energy, natural resources, space or simply adaptation capacity of nature. From this finding and that awareness must result a behavior that essentially is based on the respect we have for ourselves and therefore for nature (<b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>car</b> and not to convert). Recycling, reuse, re-use, regeneration or recovery are behaviors that aim to minimize the energy used, to take maximum advantage of the material and {{to reduce the risk of}} pollution during the manufacture, use or disposal of these materials. In general, this means that it is desired to delay as much as possible when an object becomes waste. This requires a vision of the life of material or object (Life Cycle Assessment), in which a balance sheet is prepared at every stage of life - from raw material extraction, manufacturing, processing, recycling and elimination. Additionally to materials known as "natural" or “bio-based”, the construction industry increasingly incorporates these alternative materials, even if not without some psychological, normative and technical reservations. As a significant source of pollution (CO 2, solid waste, [...] .), construction is a major reservoir for recovery of waste and industrial by-products: alongside the traditional production process of construction materials and the resurgence of bio-based materials, recycled materials also contribute to the development of materials for future...|$|E
