60|$|<b>They</b> <b>both</b> <b>looked</b> across {{towards the}} ballroom, {{where she was}} dancing with Chalmers.|$|E
60|$|She broke off. <b>They</b> <b>both</b> <b>looked</b> at her, perplexed. Philip {{shook his}} head good-naturedly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, and <b>they</b> <b>both</b> <b>look</b> like strong fellows," [...] {{returned}} the young auctioneer, as {{he surveyed the}} pair. [...] "If they get ugly when we claim the turn-out {{we may have a}} lively time with them." ...|$|R
6000|$|AMY. 'No; I {{thought of}} that. But she couldn't, you know, {{even though she}} was held up. Mother couldn't help {{thinking}} the scene was a good omen, though.' <b>They</b> <b>both</b> <b>look</b> at the ceiling again. 'How still they are.' ...|$|R
6000|$|ALBERTO. In a minute, my darling. There, there, poor Lucrezia. (He puts an arm round her, {{kisses her}} hair and neck. LUCREZIA leans her bowed head against his chest. The sound of {{footsteps}} is heard. <b>They</b> <b>both</b> <b>look</b> up with scared, wide-open eyes.) ...|$|R
60|$|When he {{returned}} Mr. Manning {{was with his}} father, and <b>they</b> <b>both</b> <b>looked</b> grave.|$|E

50|$|After {{testing the}} saltpetre, {{they find that}} instead of sodium nitrate, the can {{contains}} sodium nitrite. This minor difference is almost unnoticeable, as <b>they</b> <b>both</b> <b>look</b> and taste just like table salt. Both are used to preserve meat, but the levels present in food are closely monitored. However, sodium nitrite is extremely toxic.|$|R

60|$|She had {{smoothed}} {{her hair and}} was carrying a tea-tray. <b>They</b> <b>both</b> <b>looked</b> at her as though fascinated.|$|E
50|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was directed, {{produced}} and edited by Jeffrey Abelson.

60|$|<b>They</b> <b>both</b> <b>looked</b> at her, {{very much}} as the cats had looked at them, a little while before.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>both</b> <b>looked</b> at him--Sophy politely curious, Louise {{more deeply}} interested. He {{answered}} the inquiry in her eyes.|$|E
60|$|Just at {{this moment}} the door opened, and Ralph and Percy entered hastily. <b>They</b> <b>both</b> <b>looked</b> excited, but serious.|$|E
50|$|In New York, Pug has rescued Kildare, and <b>they</b> are <b>both</b> <b>looking</b> {{for some}} answers. We are also {{introduced}} to Childe Roland, a half-elf street artist.|$|R
6000|$|<b>They</b> were <b>both</b> <b>looking</b> at me; {{but though}} my face may have turned a trifle paler, {{my voice was}} as steady as ever as I answered-- ...|$|R
50|$|Two years later, William, having {{contacted}} Julia, meets {{her for a}} late {{lunch in}} a restaurant favored by Sarah and gives her additional information about his mother that the Dafaures had.

6000|$|He stopped short. He looked {{towards the}} gangway, <b>they</b> <b>both</b> <b>looked.</b> The magic word [...] "Breakfast" [...] came {{simultaneously}} from them.|$|E
60|$|Leaning on Red Eve's {{shoulder}} Sir Andrew limped to {{the side}} of the grave. <b>They</b> <b>both</b> <b>looked</b> down on that which lay therein.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>both</b> <b>looked</b> up. Brand {{himself had}} entered the coupé. There was a slight frown upon his forehead, and his tone was curt.|$|E
5000|$|Orland {{decides to}} stay with his new dwarf friends and his puppy. He sees Slater chasing after the other two and starts running and yelling for Anderson and Harmony. <b>They</b> <b>both</b> <b>look</b> back to see what's wrong and {{discover}} Slater is still chasing them.

6000|$|I {{took this}} for an {{encouragement}} to join them. <b>They</b> were <b>both</b> <b>looking</b> at me. Doña Rita added, “Mr. Mills and I are friends from old times, you know.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Isn't it {{an amazing}} thing,' cried Gudrun, 'how strong the temptation is, not to!' <b>They</b> <b>both</b> laughed, <b>looking</b> at each other. In their hearts they were frightened.|$|R
60|$|She {{offered her}} hand to him. He had just raised it to his lips--when the drawing-room door was roughly opened. <b>They</b> <b>both</b> <b>looked</b> round.|$|E

50|$|Following the victory, Charlie embraces Orion and spots Bombay who has {{attended}} the game. <b>They</b> <b>both</b> <b>look</b> {{across to the}} Warriors emblem, which is suddenly replaced by an unrolling banner with the Ducks' logo and changing into Eden Hall Mighty Ducks since JV won the bet. Varsity exits the ice humiliated and defeated by the Ducks. Upon seeing this, Linda kisses Charlie. Bombay then departs the rink, amid a sea of cheering fans, with a smile, knowing his protege has matured.|$|R
50|$|No longer {{conscious}} of being observed, O starts off again, knocking over a trestle and stumbling over a railway sleeper—anything {{to stay as}} close as possible to the wall.

They have been consulting a newspaper, which the woman keeps hold of. <b>They</b> <b>both</b> <b>look</b> appalled at what has happened.|$|R
