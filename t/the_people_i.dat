25|$|We'd see Basie in town, and I was {{impressed}} by Harry Edison and Buck Clayton, being a trumpet player. And I would say I {{was impressed}} by Dizzy Gillespie {{when he was with}} Cab Calloway. I {{was impressed by}} those three trumpet players of <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>I</b> saw in person... I thought Harry Edison and Dizzy Gillespie were the most unique of the trumpet players I heard.|$|E
25|$|I {{believe that}} it is one of my strong collaborations. It already has me worried about the future. This is my best moment now, as far as the match I have musically with Sakis. Without wanting to put down all <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>I</b> have collaborated with I adore them like, ex, Giorgos Mazonakis. The people who go to see Sakis musically are very close to me, in {{relation}} to those who go to see a laïko artist. The track was recorded sometime in late November at Kontopoulos' studio, coinciding with the artists' busy rehearsal schedule for The S Club. Before its release, Tamta had not heard the final result as Kontopoulos and Rouvas were in the studio up until the song's release working on the finishing touches.|$|E
25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's just, you know, I started playing very young and from early on, <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>I</b> was {{listening}} to had some element of finger style. Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then I listened to a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. I use a pick occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio when {{you want to get a}} certain tone. But it's just the way I came up. I wasn't taught. I just sort of figured things out on my own terms. I guess that was one of the ways that I became comfortable and it just kind of set in.|$|E

[...] She was {{similarly}} unrepentant about her subsequent expatriation, saying [...] "I wasn't a pariah because I was a drug-addicted, alcoholic, rotten person and not a good mother.
