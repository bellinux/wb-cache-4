He scored Bordeaux's 4th and final goal in the team's 4–0 triumph over Vannes in the Coupe de la Ligue final. Gourcuff also provided the assist on the third goal. He scored two goals in Bordeaux's Champions League campaign against Roma and CFR Cluj.

Upon receiving <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>from</b> teammate Matthieu Chalmé, just outside the box, Gourcuff performed a swift Marseille turn, eluding PSG defender Sylvain Armand, followed by quickly shifting <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>from</b> his right foot to his left causing Sammy Traoré to lose balance, before bringing the ball back to his right foot and blasting it past Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Mickaël Landreau with the outside of his right foot.|$|E

He scored his first goal after beating two players and curling <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>from</b> outside the area into the bottom-right corner. His second was scored with a half volley from a tight angle, assisted by Demetrio Albertini with a lobbed ball.|$|E
5|$|Baggio scored another match-winning {{goal in the}} quarter-finals {{to defeat}} Spain 2–1 with three minutes remaining.

5|$|After {{a safety}} is scored, {{the ball is}} put into play by a free kick.

He became Jared Sullinger's best friend in fourth grade, but when his mother was transferred to Atlanta in sixth grade they were separated. The reassignment only lasted one year, however.

5|$|Celestine Babayaro, who {{had been}} {{struggling}} with an injury, played no further part in the final and was substituted before the second half commenced. Terry came on in his place to partner Desailly, which meant Gallas moved to left-back. Arsenal resumed play and a shot by Henry was kept out by Cudicini. The scare brought Chelsea to life and resulted in the team enjoying their best spell of the match. Guðjohnsen's effort in the 57th minute forced a save from Seaman, who tipped the ball over the bar. Jesper Grønkjær then roamed forward and played the ball to Le Saux, but the defender's shot went well over. Chelsea continued to pile pressure on Arsenal; Grønkjær's pass intended for Hasselbaink in the 61st minute was intercepted just in time by Adams and Melchiot's header unsettled Seaman in goal. Wiltord then collected <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>from</b> midfield and played a one-two with Henry, but directed his shot wide from the left flank. Chelsea made their second change in the 67th minute, bringing on Zola for Hasselbaink. The substitution {{did not have the}} desired effect as Arsenal went a goal ahead. Adams cleared the Chelsea danger and Wiltord's reverse pass found Parlour with acres of space to manoeuvre. The midfielder advanced as the Chelsea defence backed off and looked up before curling <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>from</b> 25 yards. His effort went over a diving Cudicini, into the top right-hand corner of the Chelsea goal.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea, {{also of the}} Premier League, {{were the}} {{opposition}} in the semi-final. The match was held at a neutral venue Old Trafford, the home ground of Manchester United. Liverpool {{took the lead in}} the first half. Chelsea defender John Terry committed a foul on Luis García, which resulted in a Liverpool free kick, from which Riise scored. They extended their lead soon after the start of the second half, when a goal by García from , after he received <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>from</b> a William Gallas header, gave them a 2–0 lead. Chelsea scored late in the half through striker Didier Drogba, but they were unable to achieve an equaliser and Liverpool won the match 2–1 to progress to the final.|$|E
5|$|Following their exit in the Champions League in midweek, Arsenal beat Everton 4–1 on 21 April 2001. They moved {{four points}} clear in second with a further win, this time away at Derby County.

Arsenal ended their league campaign against Southampton, in the final match played at The Dell.

The risk is that if <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is not stripped or intercepted, then <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> carrier on offense {{has a better chance}} of gaining more yards or scoring; the reward is that the offensive drive is stopped without a score more often, frequently giving good field position.|$|R

5|$|In {{the bronze}} medal match against England, Baggio {{returned}} to the starting line-up, playing behind Schillaci.

David Platt momentarily equalised, but with five minutes left on the clock, Baggio set up Schillaci, who was fouled inside the area by Paul Parker. Although Baggio was the regularly designated penalty taker for his national team, he stepped aside to allow Schillaci to score and capture the Golden Shoe, a gesture which was praised by the Italian media. Baggio assisted a goal by Nicola Berti in the dying minutes of the match, but it was incorrectly ruled offside. Italy won the match 2–1, capturing the third place medal.|$|E

Washington brought out their placekicker, Leonard Ziel, to kick a 32-yard field goal, which would have won them the game. Ziel kicked the ball about a yard short of the right upright, giving the ball back to Navy with the game still tied. A few plays later the game ended in a 1414 tie.|$|E
