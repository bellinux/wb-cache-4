These position papers are usually written by the Doctrinal Purity Commission, a standing committee of <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Council,</b> which reviews and responds to issues referred to it by the Executive Presbytery. Position papers are not official positions of the Assemblies of God unless recommended by the Executive Presbytery and approved by <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Council.</b> Position statements touch on biblical, theological, and social concerns.|$|E
5|$|The Pennsylvania Ministerium {{remained}} a constituent church of <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Council</b> from 18671918. In 1918, following {{the celebration of}} the 400th anniversary of the Reformation, the three Lutheran church bodies of Eastern America (The General Synod, the General SynodSouth, and <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Council)</b> reunited to form the United Lutheran Church in America. This event, while marking a watershed of unity among American Lutherans, also marked the end of the Pennsylvania Ministerium. The ULCA would later join with other American Lutherans, in 1962 in the Lutheran Church in America, and in 1988 in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (which continues to be an active church body and is a direct descendant of the Pennsylvania Ministerium).|$|E

50|$|In the Basque Provinces, {{the first}} call ever to the Spanish {{military}} draft was met with frontal opposition of <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>councils</b> by November 1877. Tension mounted again between <b>the</b> Basque <b>general</b> (chartered) <b>councils</b> and <b>the</b> Spanish government. Canovas demanded the immediate execution of the order. Provincial councils were then appointed by the Spanish government, all of them answerable to the Spanish governmental deputy in each district (the gobernador civil). In Biscay, the most upfront district to reject {{the abolition of the}} fueros, Canovas ordered an immediate dissolution of <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>councils</b> (diputaciones generales). Álava and Gipuzkoa followed suit.|$|R

Although <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Council</b> {{admitted that the}} existing discrimination against homosexuals could not be condoned, it was quite critical about extending marriage toward same-sex couples (including collateral adoption). It argued that the extension was not demanded by the Constitution, and that ending discrimination could be achieved through other legal means, such as the extension of civil unions.|$|E
5|$|General Council enacts legislation, {{credentials}} ministers, {{oversees the}} national and worldwide missions programs, and directs the church’s colleges and seminary. <b>The</b> <b>General</b> <b>Council</b> also elects the general superintendent—the {{chief executive officer of}} the national organization—and other officers, such as the assistant general superintendent, general secretary, general treasurer, and the directors of U.S. and world missions. These manage the AG's day-to-day operations and work together as the Executive Leadership Team.|$|E
5|$|In 1864, {{unhappy with}} the {{direction}} of the General Synod and its seminary at Gettysburg, the Ministerium established a new seminary in Philadelphia, and asked Charles Porterfield Krauth to head the seminary (now known as the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Philadelphia). This was followed, in 1867, with the Ministerium being joined by thirteen other church bodies in a more conservative and confessional organization known as <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Council.</b>|$|E

5|$|After her defeat, Bondfield {{returned}} to her NUGMW post.

5|$|Among the Fundamental Truths was a {{statement}} regarding speaking in tongues as the initial physical evidence of Spirit baptism. Its inclusion was challenged by F.F. Bosworth, an executive presbyter, who argued that while for many speaking in tongues was an evidence of the baptism {{it was not the}} only evidence. The issue was decided at <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Council</b> of September 1918 where Bosworth, who two months earlier had resigned so as not to damage the fellowship, was present and invited to address the council. Following debate two resolutions were passed which assured that initial evidence would remain an official teaching of the fellowship.|$|E
5|$|At {{the top of}} this {{organizational}} {{framework is}} the biennial General Council, the highest governing body of the Assemblies of God. All ordained and licensed ministers and one delegate per Assembly of God church are entitled to attend and participate at <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Council.</b> The size of General Council is not static but fluctuating, changing from year to year as there is no requirement that pastors attend or that churches send delegates.

5|$|The {{reaction}} against the king at <b>the</b> <b>general</b> <b>council</b> had shown Atholl that James {{was not only}} on the back-foot but his political standing had received a huge set-back and may have convinced the earl that James's death was now a viable course of action. Atholl had seen how assertive action by two of his brothers at different times had allowed them {{to take control of the}} kingdom and that as James's nearest adult relative, the earl must have considered that decisive intervention on his part at this time could prove to be equally successful.|$|E

5|$|A {{primary reason}} <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Council</b> {{was formed in}} 1914 was to create {{cooperation}} in Pentecostal missionary work.

Missionary work outside of the United States is overseen by Assemblies of God World Missions. As of December 2009, AG World Missions was reporting 2,719 personnel worldwide.

5|$|Gray's Inn and {{the other}} three Inns of Court remain the only bodies legally allowed to call a {{barrister}} to the Bar, allowing him or her to practise in England and Wales. Although the Inn was previously a disciplinary and teaching body, these functions are now shared between the four Inns, with the Bar Standards Board (a division of <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Council</b> of the Bar) acting as a disciplinary body and the Inns of Court and Bar Educational Trust providing education. The Inn remains a collegiate self-governing, unincorporated association of its members, providing within its precincts library, dining, residential and office accommodation (chambers), along with a chapel. Members of the Bar from other Inns may use these facilities to some extent.|$|E
5|$|From {{the early}} 1450s, {{a great deal}} of the {{legislative}} business of the Scottish parliament was usually carried out by a parliamentary committee known as the 'Lords of the Articles', chosen by the three estates to draft legislation that was then presented to the full assembly to be confirmed. Before the sixteenth century, parliamentary business was also carried out by 'sister' institutions, including <b>the</b> <b>General</b> <b>Council</b> and the Convention of Estates. These bodies could deal with taxation, legislation and policy-making, but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament. In the fifteenth century, parliament was being called on an almost annual basis, more often than its English counterpart, and was willing to offer occasional resistance or criticism to the policies of the crown, particular in the unpopular reign of James III. However, from about 1494, after his success against the Stewarts and Douglases and over rebels in 1482 and 1488, James IV managed largely to dispense with the institution, and it might have declined, like many other systems of Estates in continental Europe, had it not been for his death in 1513 and another long minority.|$|E
