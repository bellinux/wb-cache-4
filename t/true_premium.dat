40|$|We {{address the}} {{question}} of how the strength of protection for geographical indications (GIs) affects the GI industry 2 ̆ 7 s promotion incentives, equilibrium market outcomes, and the distribution of welfare. Geographical indication producers engage in informative advertising by associating their <b>true</b> quality <b>premium</b> (relative to a substitute product) with a specific label emphasizing the GI 2 ̆ 7 s geographic origin. The extent to which the names/words of the GI label can be used and/or imitated by competing products—which depends on the strength of GI protection—determines how informative the GI promotion messages can be. Consumers’ heterogeneous preferences (vis-à-vis the GI quality premium) are modeled in a vertically differentiated framework. Both the GI industry and the substitute product industry are assumed to be competitive (with free entry). The model is calibrated and solved for alternative parameter values. Results show that producers of the GI and of the lower-quality substitute good have divergent interests: GI producers are better off with full protection, whereas the substitute good 2 ̆ 7 s producers prefer intermediate levels of protection (but they never prefer zero protection because they benefit indirectly if the GI producers’ incentives to promote are preserved). For consumers and aggregate welfare, the preferred level of protection depends on the model 2 ̆ 7 s parameters, with an intermediate level of protection being optimal in many circumstances...|$|R

They {{show that the}} conditional equity premium is a linear function of conditional consumption and market return volatilities, which can be estimated handily by various Generalized Autoregressive Conditonal Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) and Stochastic Volatility (SV) models. We find that conditional consumption and market volatilities are capable of explaining cross-sectional return differences. The Exponential GARCH (EGARCH) volatility can explain up to 55 % variation of return and the EGARCH model augmented with cay^ — a cointegrating factor of consumption, labor income and asset wealth growth — greatly enhances model performance. We proceed to test another hypothesis: if Bansal and Yaron estimator is an unbiased estimator of <b>true</b> conditional equity <b>premium,</b> then the instrumental variables for estimating conditional equity premium should no longer be significant. We demonstrate that once the theoretical conditional risk premium {{is added to the}} model, it renders all instrumental variables redundant.

40|$|Restrictions on {{insurance}} risk classification {{can lead to}} troublesome adverse selection. A simple version of the usual argument is as follows. If insurers cannot charge risk-differentiated premiums, more insurance is bought by higher risks and less insurance is bought by lower risks. This raises the equilibrium pooled price of insurance above a population-weighted average of <b>true</b> risk <b>premiums.</b> Also, since the number of higher risks is usually smaller {{than the number of}} lower risks, the total number of risks insured usually falls. This combination of a rise in price and fall in demand is usually portrayed as a bad outcome, both for insurers and for society. However, some restrictions {{on insurance}} risk classification are common in practice. For example, since 2012 insurers in the European Union has been barred from using gender in underwriting; and many countries have placed some limits on insurers' use of genetic test results. We can observe that policy-makers often appear to perceive some merit in such restrictions. This observation motivates a careful re-examination of the usual adverse selection argument. In this talk, we study the implications of insurers not being allowed to use risk-differentiated premiums. First, we provide a micro-foundation in variations across individuals' utility of wealth to obtain an aggregate insurance demand function. Then, within this framework, we formulate the concept of loss coverage, defined as expected losses compensated by insurance, as a metric for evaluating different insurance risk classification schemes. Finally, we reconcile loss coverage to a utilitarian concept of social welfare, defined as the sum of individuals' expected utilities over the entire population. Specifically, we show that if insurance premiums are small relative to wealth, maximising loss coverage maximises social welfare. From a policy perspective, this may be a useful result because maximising loss coverage does not require knowledge of individuals' (unobservable) utility functions; loss coverage is based solely on observable quantities...|$|R

The classic rule for making capital budgeting decisions is to take projects with positive Net Present Value (NPV). Consider a project that generates an annual, real cash flow of 100, 000 forever, starting one year from now. The initial investment is 1, 600, 000. To decide whether to invest in this project or not, we discount all future cash flows and subtract the initial investment to get the NPV.

In this talk, we study the implications of insurers not being allowed to use risk-differentiated premiums. We model the insurance purchasing behaviour of individuals based on their degrees of risk aversion and utility of wealth. We assume that an equilibrium has been reached, where insurers break even by charging the same `pooled' premium to both high and low risks. We characterise this equilibrium by two quantities: adverse selection, defined as the correlation of insurance coverage and losses; and `loss coverage', defined as the expected losses compensated by insurance. We find that adverse selection is always higher under pooling than under risk-differentiated premiums, as expected. However, loss coverage can be higher or lower under pooling than under risk-differentiated premiums. Loss coverage is higher under pooling if the shift in coverage towards higher risks more than compensates for the fall in number of risks insured. In other words, loss coverage is higher under pooling if adverse selection at the equilibrium is modest, but lower under pooling if adverse selection at the equilibrium is severe. Loss coverage represents the expected losses compensated by insurance for the whole population. We argue that this is a good metric for the social efficacy of insurance, and hence one which public policymakers may reasonably wish to maximise. If this argument is accepted, modest adverse selection under pooling can be a good thing, because it leads to higher loss coverage than risk-differentiated premiums...|$|R
40|$|Deposited {{with the}} {{permission}} of the author. © 2000 Dr. Raphael Henry ArndtOver the last decade there has been an increasing trend by governments in Australia and throughout the world to use the skills and expertise of the private sector in developing and implementing infrastructure projects. The agreement for these projects must allocate responsibility for dealing with the risks which may arise to either the government directly, or on behalf of consumers, or to the private sponsor. This thesis investigates risk allocation in the private provision of infrastructure, particularly in build-own-operate (BOO) and build-own-operate-transfer (BOOT) projects. Its primary objective is to identify a framework for efficient risk allocation so that decision makers can assess the efficiency of the risk allocation in past projects and can attempt to increase the efficiency of the risk allocation in future projects. This thesis defines an efficient situation as one where the risk allocation cannot be varied without the total risk premium for the entire project being increased, and approach based on Pareto optimality. As {{it is almost impossible to}} determine the <b>true</b> risk <b>premium</b> charged by parties for risk bearing, risks should be allocated to the party best able to control and manage them. This is explained to mean the party which is best able to control or manage the likelihood of the risk occurring or the size of its consequences if it does occur. It also means the party with the best access to reasonable mitigation techniques and the party which is least risk averse. Those exogenous risks which are not easily allocated in this way should be shared so that both parties, the sponsor and the government, have an incentive to manage them. Some of the options for sharing these risks are examined. The application of the theory of efficient risk allocation is simplified by using a categorical risk framework. This approach is then tested on seven case studies of recent Australian projects spanning several industry sectors. Finally, the theoretical hypotheses and assumptions are tested in a survey of key participants in the Australian private infrastructure industry. This survey not only confirms that the basic theory for efficient risk allocation is valid but also identifies the key areas of concern to the private sector when it considers project risk allocation. Risks of concern are identified and possible options for risk sharing are investigated. This thesis concludes that it is possible to achieve efficient risk allocations in practice, and that by achieving this outcome transaction costs can be reduced, allowing cheaper infrastructure services to be supplied to the community. However, several hurdles to achieving this outcome are identified. These include the peculiar characteristics of banks and their position in projects funded using non-recourse project finance, and the fact that most private firms fail to value potential upside risks as highly as they fear potential losses due to downside risks. More work is needed to understand and overcome these hurdles if efficient risk allocation is to be achieved in the real world. It is only then that governments can be sure that they are providing private sector infrastructure services to the community at the lowest overall cost. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|In their seminal paper "The Equity Premium: A Puzzle" (1985), Mehra and Prescott {{attempted}} {{to test whether}} neo-classical economics could rationalise the observed equity risk premium and risk free rate. They ensured consistency with neo-classical economics by taking the Arrow-Debreu assumptions. For example, all participants have complete structural knowledge, and each participant has a Debreu compliant utility function, known to all participants, that does not change. They also {{made a number of}} additional, unrealistic assumptions not required by neo-classical economics. This allowed them to construct a relatively simple and elegant model of the economy, in which the equity risk premium is the logical product of only four key parameters. Remarkably, the model calculates the equity risk premium to be 0 % to 2 %, {{a long way from the}} observed risk premium suggesting 6 % to 8 %,. causing Mehra and Prescott to argue that a neo-classical model could not rationalise the historical data. I built an Arrow-Debreu (neo-classical) economic model, that avoided Mehra and Prescott 's following assumptions: the income growth process does not change from year to year; the parameters of the consumption growth process are objectively inferable from historical consumption growth data; consumption will equal income every year; the capital price/income ratio will not change from year to year; stock equity as a proportion of total capital does not change from year to year; and dividends are always equal to actual income less 90 % of expected income and this does not change from year to year. These assumptions are unrealistic and are not required by neo-classical economics. Avoiding these assumptions makes the model more realistic, yet, in contrast to other proposed equity risk premium models, maintains its neo-classical basis. It requires more difficult mathematics (I was forced to resort to numerical analysis), and the model is more complex,. requiring 13 parameters. For example, without the assumption that the capital price/income ratio and the stock equity to total capital ratio is constant, I needed to consider the volatility of these ratios. I had to accept that expected future consumption growth may reasonably be higher or lower than the past 80 years' historical average. My model should not be thought of as having 13 parameters that can hold any value: each of the parameters is a real world quantity (even if difficult to measure). I made a conscientious effort to ensure parameters did not take unrealistic values. My model implies an enormous range for the <b>true</b> equity risk <b>premium.</b> Neoclassical economics (without additional unrealistic restrictions) doesn't give the clear answers that one would like. It is consistent with such a huge range of historically observed equity risk premiums that it is virtually unfalsifiable. But at the same time, this means that the model now can rationalise the historical data - Mehra and Prescott's claim is untrue. The inconsistency should not have been blamed on neo-classical assumptions, when it results from their additional, unnecessary and unrealistic assumptions. Financial economics should be quicker to question the impact of its simplifying assumptions, rather than being blinded by elegance.
