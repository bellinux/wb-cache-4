One survey of over 400 adults showed approximately 15% morning people, 25% evening people, and 60% intermediates.|$|R

25|$|Excavations {{of prehistoric}} sites suggest that early humans {{were living in}} what is now Afghanistan at least 50,000 years ago. Since the 2nd {{millennium}} BC, cities in the region now inhabited by Pashtuns have seen invasions and migrations, including by Ancient Indian peoples, Ancient Iranian peoples, the Medes, Persians and Ancient Macedonians in antiquity, Kushans, Hephthalites, Arabs, Turks, Mongols, and others.

25|$|In anatomy, the scapula (plural scapulae or scapulas) a.k.a. {{shoulder}} blade or wing bone, is the bone {{that connects the}} humerus (upper arm bone) with the clavicle (collar bone). Like their connected bones the scapulae are paired, with the scapula {{on either side of}} the body being roughly a mirror image of the other. In early Roman <b>times,</b> <b>people</b> thought the bone resembled a trowel, a small shovel. The {{shoulder blade}} is also called omo in Latin medical terminology.|$|E

25|$|The {{preposition}} von ("of") {{was used}} to distinguish Nobility; for example, if someone was baron of the village of Veltheim, his family name would be von Veltheim. In modern <b>times,</b> <b>people</b> who were elevated to nobility often had a 'von' added to their name. For example, Johann Wolfgang Goethe had his name changed to Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. This practice ended with {{the abolition of the}} monarchy in Germany and Austria in 1919. Sometimes von is also used in geographical names that are not noble, as in von Däniken.|$|E
25|$|When {{academics}} {{talk about}} coordination failure, most cases are that subjects achieve risk dominance rather than payoff dominance. Even when payoffs are better when players coordinate on one equilibrium, many <b>times</b> <b>people</b> will choose the less risky option {{where they are}} guaranteed some payoff and end up at an equilibrium that has sub-optimal payoff. Players {{are more likely to}} fail to coordinate on a riskier option when the difference between taking the risk or the safe option is smaller. The laboratory results suggest that coordination failure is a common phenomenon in the setting of order-statistic games and stag-hunt games.|$|E
25|$|St Paul's {{charges for}} the {{admission}} {{of those people who}} are sightseers, rather than worshippers; the charge is £18 (£16 when purchased online). Outside service <b>times,</b> <b>people</b> seeking a quiet place to pray or worship are admitted to St Dunstan's Chapel free of charge. On Sundays people are admitted only for services and concerts and there is no sightseeing. The charge to sightseers is made because St Paul's receives little regular or significant funding from the Crown, the Church of England or the state and relies on the income generated by tourism to allow the building to continue to function as a centre for Christian worship, as well as to cover general maintenance and repair work.|$|E

25|$|Ren goes {{before the}} city council and reads several Bible verses {{given to him by}} Ariel, that {{describe}} how in ancient <b>times</b> <b>people</b> would dance to rejoice, exercise, celebrate, and/or worship. Ren also teaches Willard how to dance. The city council votes against him. Undaunted, Ren convinces the cotton mill owner to let them have a prom there; the mill is just outside city limits. Ren goes to see Moore, knowing that Moore still has enough influence to pressure the parents not to let their teenagers come. Ren tells Moore that even though they denied the motion to dismiss the law, they cannot stop the dance. He then asks him respectfully if he can take Ariel.|$|E
25|$|Since ancient <b>times,</b> <b>people</b> {{have opened}} the rainforest, altered the ecosystem, shaped the landscapes and created rice paddy and {{terraces}} to support the growing population. Javan rice terraces have existed {{for more than a}} millennium, and had supported ancient agricultural kingdoms. The growing human population has put severe pressure on Java's wildlife, as rainforests were diminished and confined to highland slopes or isolated peninsulas. Some of Java's endemic species are now critically endangered, with some already extinct; Java used to have Javan tigers and Javan elephants, but both have been rendered extinct. Today, several national parks exist in Java that protect the remnants of its fragile wildlife, such as Ujung Kulon, Mount Halimun-Salak, Gede Pangrango, Baluran, Meru Betiri and Alas Purwo.|$|E

Sundar resolved {{to kill himself}} by throwing himself upon a railroad track. He asked that whosoever is the 'True God' would appear before him, or else he would kill himself; that very night he had an enlightening vision of Jesus who opened Sundar's soul to the truth. Sundar announced to his father, Sher Singh, that henceforth he would get converted into the missionary work of Christ. His father denounced him, and his brother Rajender Singh attempted to poison him. He was not poisoned just once {{but a number of}} <b>times.</b> <b>People</b> of that area threw snakes in his house.

25|$|On Changing Rooms {{he quickly}} gained {{something}} of a reputation for clutter; {{in many ways the}} decluttering trend was a reaction against his style of design. Many <b>times</b> <b>people</b> were filmed in tears of sadness after having seen what he had done to their drawing room: frequently people {{said they were going to}} repaint the room with white paint.This reaction made him use darker colours for the walls which could not be painted over as easily. So infamous was his reputation that some people visibly winced when they realised they had got him as their designer. On 13 April 2009 he presented a documentary on BBC One in the West region in which he went In Search of England's Green & Pleasant Land. The programme explored the threats to the rural way of life from urban creep and the loss of local services.|$|E
25|$|The text {{generally}} {{consists of}} two side-by-side pages: one of the Aramaic/Hebrew Vilna Edition text, and the corresponding page consists of an English translation. The English translation has a bolded literal translation of the Talmud's text, but also includes un-bolded text clarifying the literal translation. (The original Talmud's text is often very unclear, referring to places, <b>times,</b> <b>people,</b> and laws {{that it does not}} explain. The un-bolded text attempts to explain these situations. The text of the Talmud also contains few prepositions, articles, etc. The un-bolded text takes the liberty of inserting these parts of speech.) The result is an English text that reads in full sentences with full explanations, while allowing the reader to distinguish between direct translation and a more liberal approach to the translation. (This also results in one page of the Vilna Talmud requiring several pages of English translation.) Below the English translation appear extensive notes including diagrams.|$|E
25|$|DSPD {{was first}} {{formally}} described in 1981 by Elliot D. Weitzman {{and others at}} Montefiore Medical Center. It is responsible for 7–10% of patient complaints of chronic insomnia. However, since many doctors are unfamiliar with the condition, it often goes untreated or is treated inappropriately; DSPD is often misdiagnosed as primary insomnia or as a psychiatric condition. DSPD can be treated or helped in some cases by careful daily sleep practices, morning light therapy, evening dark therapy, earlier exercise and meal times, and medications such as melatonin and modafinil; the former is a natural neurohormone {{partly responsible for the}} human body clock. At its most severe and inflexible, DSPD is a disability. A chief difficulty of treating DSPD is in maintaining an earlier schedule after it has been established, as the patient's body has a strong tendency to reset the sleeping schedule to its intrinsic late <b>times.</b> <b>People</b> with DSPD may improve their quality of life by choosing careers that allow late sleeping times, rather than forcing themselves to follow a conventional 9-to-5 work schedule.|$|E
