Gekko {{tells him that}} KZI's collapse started when Bretton spread rumors of KZI having <b>toxic</b> <b>debt.</b> Jacob and Gekko arrange a trade: Jacob will try to reconcile Winnie's and Gekko's relationship, and Gekko will gather information to destroy Bretton for his actions against KZI and for providing evidence against Gekko years ago. In revenge, Jake illegally manipulates the market by spreading rumors about the nationalization of a foreign oil field which Church has invested in. The company loses $120 million, but Bretton gives Jake a job, impressed by his initiative. Jake further impresses Bretton when he convinces Chinese investors {{to invest in the}} fusion project through Church.|$|E

5000|$|He {{writes that}} the {{response}} of U.S. and European governments to the financial crisis, by saving some banks and not others, created an aura of regulatory uncertainty that made things worse. He describes a potential free market solution of simply shuffling severely affected banks through organized bankruptcies to write off <b>toxic</b> <b>debts.</b> Although praising U.S. and European efforts to avoid protectionism post-crisis, he asserts that his recommended approach [...] "could have brought a more severe recession, but a shorter one, followed by a quicker rebound." ...|$|R
40|$|A {{previously}} unattributed {{factor that}} contributed towards {{the most recent}} financial crisis is financial crime. However, {{it is important to}} note and accept that financial crime was not the sole and only cause of the financial crisis. For example, it has been asserted by economists, the International Monetary Fund, the United States Department of Treasury, HM Treasury, official enquiries and academic commentators that the foundations of the financial crisis were laid as a result of the collapse of the United States subprime mortgage market. Others have argued that the foundations of the financial crisis were placed by the continued use of low interest rates by the Federal Reserve. Additional factors, which are beyond the scope of the article, include high levels of consumer <b>debt,</b> <b>toxic</b> <b>debts,</b> securitisation, deregulation of banking legislation, ineffective macroeconomic policies, weak credit regulation, deregulation of consumer credit legislation, the self-regulation of credit rating agencies, the culture of some banking practices and weak banking regulation. Initially, the link between the financial crisis and financial crime was difficult to quantify. There is no ‘super villain’ that has become the face of financial crime during the financial crisis. However, research has concluded that several different types of financial crime have interacted with the traditional variables, as outlined above, that contributed towards the financial crisis. It is my contention that this includes the relationship between subprime mortgages and mortgage fraud, predatory lending, Ponzi fraud schemes, market misconduct and market manipulation. It is not the purpose of this article to review each of these in detail, but to critically consider the response in the United Kingdom by the financial regulator towards financial crime during and after the financial crisis...|$|R
40|$|Ireland’s {{economic}} and financial crisis has required the passage of several increasingly austere budgets, starting in 2008, and also the legislation to create the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) to consolidate <b>toxic</b> bank <b>debts.</b> Debates over these pieces of legislation reveals strong differences in political preferences both within parties and between parties that can be estimated by scaling the text of their legislative speeches in each debate. Moreover, because {{we can assume that}} preferences remain stable across budgets, we can use the separate debates to validate the ability of textscaling methodologies to recover latent positions through text. Our analysis estimates legislator positions through quantitative text scaling of the budget debates of 2008 - 2010 plus the NAMA legislation, finding evidence of significant intra-party differences that can be explained by a variety of political and constituency-level variables...|$|R
50|$|He was {{nominated}} as Attorney-General by Taoiseach Bertie Ahern on 14 June 2007 and renominated by Brian Cowen on 6 May 2008. He {{was said to}} be in the office from 7am until 7pm, taking a 15-minute lunch-break. Gallagher was among those present in 2008 when the Irish government decided to guarantee the liabilities of the six largest banks in an (ultimately disastrous) effort to bolster confidence in the banking system; he was also among the negotiating team that subsequently sought emergency funding from the EU and IMF. After his period in office, he acted as legal representative for Anglo-Irish bank, the extent of whose (at first not fully apprehended) exposure to <b>toxic</b> <b>debt</b> {{was one of the main}} reasons for the failure of the bank guarantee.|$|E
5000|$|Michael Schlachter, the {{managing}} director of an investment consulting firm in Santa Monica, California called it [...] "absolutely ridiculous" [...] that banks may profit from speculating on <b>toxic</b> <b>debt,</b> when their pursuit of it caused the financial crisis. Schlachter said, “Some of them created this mess, and they are making a killing undoing it.” The prices {{for some of the}} securities that PPIP was to buy almost doubled between March 2009 {{and the end of the}} year, a rally that was in part caused by traders jumping in before the PPIP funds were available, according to one trader. The director of research at an investment consulting firm said that banks increased their debt holdings following the announcement of PPIP was hardly surprising. “Any time the government says, ‘We’re going to buy something in the securities market,’ they’re putting out a sign that says, ‘Free money, come and get it’,” he said.|$|E
5000|$|On October 15, 2010, Hicks lost {{ownership}} of Liverpool. Despite numerous attempts to prevent it, {{the club was}} sold to New England Sports Ventures (NESV), for a fee believed to be around £300 million, which was far below Hicks' valuation of [...] "between £600M and £1 billion(B)", by the club's board of directors in a 3-2 vote. Hicks is pursuing a (max.) £1 billion suit against NESV and Kop Holdings for damages, claiming that, [...] "This outcome... devalues the club..." [...] and suggesting {{that he had been}} the victim of an [...] "epic swindle". From the time the club had been put up for sale, however, it had been widely reported that the fee that Hicks and Gillett were asking for was unlikely to be achieved. The Wall Street Journal pointed out that the asking price of £600-800 million took no account of the fact that a new owner would have to spend £375 million building the new stadium which Hicks and Gillett had promised and failed to deliver. The Daily Telegraph suggested that Hicks and Gillett were unlikely to achieve their estimated price because everyone knew that there was huge debt at the club and that these debts were due to be called in very shortly, meaning that the bankers would subsequently put the club into administration and then sell off the club at a bargain price anyway. The likelihood of the club being placed in administration increased once, on September 7, 2010, the Royal Bank of Scotland, Hicks's main creditor, placed the Texan's indebtedness in the <b>toxic</b> <b>debt</b> category as he was considered unable to find refinancing or to pay off the debt. In the end, none of the offers made were anywhere close to Hicks and Gillett's valuation and with the threat of administration looming the club was sold for £300 million. This meant that the sale in 2010 fetched £80 million more than Hicks and Gillett had paid for the club in 2007, but because more than £200 million worth of debt had been piled on to the club, resulting in huge interest rates and penalty payments, the outgoing owners ended up losing an estimated £144 million on their investment.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{examine the}} toxic loans sold by {{investment}} banks to local governments. Using proprietary data, {{we show that}} politicians strategically use these products to increase chances of being re-elected. Consistent with greater incentives to hide <b>debt,</b> <b>toxic</b> loans are utilized significantly more frequently within highly indebted local governments. Incumbent politicians from politically contested areas {{are also more likely}} to turn to toxic loans. Using a differencein-differences methodology, we show that politicians time the election cycle by implementing more transactions immediately before an election than after. Politicians also exhibit herding behavior. Our findings demonstrate how financial innovation can foster strategic behaviors...|$|R
40|$|One cannot {{pick up a}} {{financial}} publication or newspaper without noticing articles alleging, {{or at the very}} least insinuating, a relationship between the housing bubble burst and the most severe recession in the U. S. and other parts of the world since the great depression of the 1930 ’s. However, empirical studies statistically confirming such a relationship are a challenge to find. This study examines a relationship between the prices of houses and the United States GDP before, during, and after the period known as the “ 2007 global financial meltdown. ” The study also expands into the global environment through its literature review. Tracking a housing price index and the U. S. GDP numbers over the last five years, data was retrieved from different sources but aligned in equal time and periods, reviewed, subjected to Regression Analysis, and tested for significance. The results indicate that there exists a relationship between the two variables such that a quarterly change in the housing price index may yield a quarterly change in Real GDP. The hypothesis test rejects the null hypothesis, thus supporting the notion that they are linked. However, the specific elements or combination of causal factors including the <b>toxic</b> mortgage <b>debt</b> that may have triggered the economic slowdown may continue to be debated far into the future. Many factors and forces created the perfect storm for the global financial crisis. However, it appears that the subprime mortgage lending disaster, whose center was the price bubble of the housing market, was the spark that started it all...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple {{model of the}} kind of program pro-posed by the administration in its public private partnership to get <b>toxic</b> <b>debt</b> o ¤ the balance sheets of the Banks. It considers an en-vironment where the quality of the debt (which is measured by the probability of default) is not observable to the buyer, but is known to the seller. IIt is shown that {{in the absence of any}} subsidies, there is no price at which Banks are willing to sell their toxic assets and agents are willing to purchase them. This occurs due to the classic Akerlof lemonsproblem. A public private partnership of the type proposed by the administration is shown to allow the market to reappear if the leverage o¤ered to private equity is large enough. However, even in the best case scenario, namely one with no market power and no costs of operation on the part of private equity, there is no advantage to this way of organizing the sale of assets as cost of doing so in this best case scenario cannot be less than just setting a price at which all assets that are o¤ered will be purchased. I would like to thank, without implicating, all the bloggers whose writngs inspired these notes. ...|$|E
