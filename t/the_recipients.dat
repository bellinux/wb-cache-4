5|$|The Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross (German: Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes) and its {{variants}} {{were the}} highest awards in the military of the Third Reich. Recipients are grouped by grades of the Knight's Cross. Within each grade <b>the</b> <b>recipients</b> are ordered chronologically. An exception is the lowest grade, here <b>the</b> <b>recipients</b> are ordered alphabetically by last name. The rank listed is the recipient's rank {{at the time the}} Knight's Cross was awarded. Broken out into sub lists are <b>the</b> <b>recipients</b> of the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves, one list for every year between 1940 and 1945 the award was presented.

25|$|The auditor must {{understand}} <b>the</b> <b>recipient’s</b> internal control system {{to determine if}} <b>the</b> <b>recipient</b> has proper safeguards that help manage federal assistance responsibly. After obtaining sufficient knowledge of that system, the auditor must perform audit procedures to verify <b>the</b> <b>recipient’s</b> internal control system works properly, and <b>the</b> <b>recipient’s</b> federal program operations comply with laws and regulations (e.g., the compliance audit portion of the Single Audit).|$|R
50|$|Transfusion-associated {{graft-versus-host disease}} (TA-GvHD) {{is a rare}} {{complication}} of blood transfusion, in which the donor T lymphocytes mount an immune response against <b>the</b> <b>recipient's</b> lymphoid tissue. Donor lymphocytes are usually identified as foreign and destroyed by <b>the</b> <b>recipient's</b> immune system. However, in situations where <b>the</b> <b>recipient</b> is immunocompromised (inborn immunodeficiency, acquired immunodeficiency, malignancy), or when the donor is homozygous and <b>the</b> <b>recipient</b> is heterozygous for an HLA haplotype (as can occur in directed donations from first-degree relatives), <b>the</b> <b>recipient's</b> immune system {{is not able to}} destroy the donor lymphocytes. This can result in graft-versus-host disease.|$|R
50|$|Sharing {{this kind}} of data is safer both for the {{identity}} provider and <b>the</b> <b>recipient.</b> <b>The</b> provider doesn’t need to overshare, and <b>the</b> <b>recipient</b> doesn’t need to store unnecessarily sensitive data - for example, if <b>the</b> <b>recipient</b> gets hacked, they are only storing “Over 18” flags, not dates of birth.|$|R

5000|$|The {{analogy with}} free/busy tone on PSTN is inexact, as the [...] "on-hook" [...] {{telephone}} status reflects {{the ability of}} the network to reach <b>the</b> <b>recipient</b> after <b>the</b> requester has initiated the conversation. The requester must commit to the connection method before discovering <b>the</b> <b>recipient's</b> availability state. Conversely, Presence shows the availability state before a conversation is initiated. A similar comparison might be the requester needing to know if <b>the</b> <b>recipient</b> is at work. The most straightforward way of checking if <b>the</b> <b>recipient</b> is available is to walk to the desk, which requires the commitment of the walk regardless of the outcome and usually requires some interaction if <b>the</b> <b>recipient</b> is at <b>the</b> desk. The requester can call first to save the walk, but now must commit to an interaction via phone. Presence gives the state of <b>the</b> <b>recipient</b> to <b>the</b> requester and the requester has the choice to interact with <b>the</b> <b>recipient</b> or use that information for non-interactive purposes (such as taking roll).|$|R

5|$|Xenotransplantation {{research}} involves transplanting tissues or organs {{from one}} species to another, {{as a way}} to overcome the shortage of human organs for use in organ transplants. Current research involves using primates as <b>the</b> <b>recipients</b> of organs from pigs that have been genetically modified to reduce the primates' immune response against the pig tissue. Although transplant rejection remains a problem, recent clinical trials that involved implanting pig insulin-secreting cells into diabetics did reduce these people's need for insulin.|$|E
