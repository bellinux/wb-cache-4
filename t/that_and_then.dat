500|$|Arcade Fire {{also contributed}} to the movie's {{original}} score, The Hunger Games: Original Motion Picture Score. The group composed the grand, fascistic-inspired, ominous Panem national anthem, entitled [...] "Horn of Plenty", an important and signature leitmotif appearing throughout the film. [...] "We were interested in making music that would be more integral in the movie, just as a mental exercise," [...] Butler, who co-wrote the song with Chassagne, explained. [...] "And there’s an anthem that runs throughout the books, the national anthem of the fascist Capitol. So as a thought experiment, we tried to write what that might sound like. It’s like the Capitol’s idea of itself, basically." [...] He further added that [...] "it's not a pop song or anything. More of an anthem that could be playing at a big sporting event like the [...] Games. So we did a structure for <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> James Newton Howard made a movie-score version of it that happens in several places in the film." [...] Arcade Fire's Panem national anthem has received strong reviews. According to Spin Mobile, [...] "'Horn of Plenty' sounds both exactly like Arcade Fire and exactly like a futuristic anthem." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the final}} twelve episodes of the season, Marvel once again ran the [...] "Art of..." [...] initiative, {{in which a}} {{different}} image was released each Thursday before a new episode, depicting a first look at a key event from the upcoming episode, with the season's title being [...] "The Art of Evolution". The different artists were once again chosen to create the teaser posters, based on their previous work and how it connected to the themes and emotion of the intended episode. On how what is shown on each poster is chosen, Bell said, [...] "maybe we'll show [...] the script or let them watch the episode and let them respond to it emotionally and see what's interesting to them. And {{then we have a}} conversation with them about how we'd like to portray <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> we try to lean into the strengths that they have. Some are more graphic, some are more character based, some are more composite, and some are cleaner. And that's one of the things [...] really look forward to each week, getting the initial sketches back from the artists and seeing their interpretation." [...] The art once again appeared as variant covers to select titles published by Marvel Comics in June 2015.|$|E

[...] Critic Mary Jane Lupton has explained that when Angelou spoke about her life, she did so eloquently but informally and [...] "with no time chart in front of her". [...] For example, she was married at least twice, but never clarified {{the number of times}} she had been married, [...] "for fear of sounding frivolous"; according to her autobiographies and to Gillespie, she married Tosh Angelos in 1951 and Paul du Feu in 1974, and began her relationship with Vusumzi Make in 1961, but never formally married him. [...] Angelou held many jobs, including some in the sex trade, working as a prostitute and madame for lesbians, as she described in her second autobiography, Gather Together in My Name. [...] In a 1995 interview, Angelou said, [...] "I wrote about my experiences because I thought too many people tell young folks, 'I never did anything wrong. Who, Moi? – never I. I have no skeletons in my closet. In fact, I have no closet.' They lie like <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> young people find themselves in situations and they think, 'Damn I must be a pretty bad guy. My mom or dad never did anything wrong.'

500|$|Some tracks used {{elements}} from Public Enemy's previous material, which Pete Watrous of The New York Times {{interpreted as a}} dual reference to hip hop tradition {{and the history of}} the group. Watrous described the music as [...] "the sound of urban alienation, where silence doesn't exist and sensory stimulation is oppressive and predatory", and writes that its dense textures [...] "envelop Chuck D's voice and make his rapping sound as if it is under duress, as if he were fighting against a background intent on taking him over ... Layer after layer of sounds are placed {{on top of each other}} until the music becomes nearly tactile". Chuck D called Fear of a Black Planet a record entirely of [...] "found sounds ... probably the most elaborate smorgasbord of sound that we did ... When we put together our music, we try to put together layers that complement each other, and then the voice tries to complement that, and the theme tries to complement <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> the song itself tries to complement the album as a whole, fitting into the overall context." [...] In his essay on hip hop aesthetics, Richard Schur interpreted such layering as a motif in hip hop and as [...] "the process by which ... new meanings are created and communicated, primarily to an equally knowledgeable audience", concluding that [...] "Public Enemy probably took the ideal of layering to its farthest point".|$|E
500|$|Victor {{was noted}} for his {{controversial}} relationship {{with both of}} his sons' ex-wife, Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), with whom he initially had a [...] father-daughter relationship. In 2003, Victor and Sharon shared a kiss, causing issues in her marriage to Nicholas; she left town to [...] "find herself". Victor supported Sharon throughout her legal problems, and paid her bail at first when she was wrongly convicted of murder in 2011. Case stated that she thinks Sharon thinks of Victor [...] "in a way like a father figure, but not quite. When she was younger she saw him as <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> when she grew up she saw him less as a father {{and more like a}} hero", also stating that Victor is Sharon's [...] "security blanket". The dynamic of their relationship changed when Victor proposed a platonic marriage to Sharon in December 2011, and while they end up marrying, but it is annulled shortly after. However, months after the annulment, they begin a genuine romance. Joshua Morrow, who portrays Nicholas, told Soaps In Depth that he was [...] "always kind of surprised that Nick just accepted this from his dad", and that [...] "there were never any scenes showing legitimate anger". Braeden didn't agree with the pairing either, stating that, [...] "We all have gone through periods of playing something we didn't really like to play so much, but you do it." ...|$|E
500|$|The MPAA {{questioned}} elements including Smith's character {{drinking in}} front of a 7-year-old and the character flying under the influence of alcohol. Scenes that were removed to receive a PG-13 rating from the MPAA included a scene of statutory rape, two of three uses of the word [...] "fuck" [...] (the MPAA only permitted one use for the PG-13 rating), and intense shots of needles going into arms. The MPAA allowed scenes of Hancock shoving a prisoner's head up another's behind and of Hancock having explosive ejaculation during sexual intercourse, though Berg chose to save the latter scene for the DVD, explaining, [...] "It just wasn't that funny. Never was. You'd put it {{in front of}} an audience and there'd be two, maybe three people laughing. There was no way to do <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> regain even a modicum of emotional integrity." [...] The director kept the scene with the prisoners since a Las Vegas test screening was overwhelmingly successful: [...] "At the end of the day, I couldn't ignore an audience when they're laughing that hard." [...] With such elements, studio executives only became comfortable with Hancock when the marketing approach focused on action and humor. Berg noted, [...] "The ad campaign for this movie is much friendlier than the film." [...] The MPAA ultimately gave the film a PG-13 rating, citing [...] "some intense sequences of sci-fi action and violence and language".|$|E

Mylod stated that he did extensive research {{in order to create}} the foot chase, saying [...] "I devoured every foot chase in the history of cinema, but trying to take from that something that would fit into the blueprint of the Game of Thrones visual style, which is not necessarily the same kind of kinetic, handheld feel that you find in many contemporary thrillers. It's a much more classic frame." [...] He continued, [...] "Everything hinged from finding this very lovely, steep stairwell and thinking 'Wouldn't it be great if she leapt off <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> tumbled down the stairs?' I had this image in my head that I wanted lots of oranges rolling down, not quite sure where that comes from, but it looked pretty." [...] Mylod also stated in a separate interview that it was a conscious decision not to show the final fight between Arya and the Waif, given that it took place in the dark, noting [...] "when the character dies in the dark, unless we switch on night-vision goggles, we're {{not going to be able}} to see that, and we're not going to stick around to hear a scream in the dark anyway. It was actually a conscious choice in the writing and I think, for me, a very elegant storytelling beat as to get that reveal a few seconds later." ...|$|E

2500|$|Before Anderson {{became a}} filmmaker, {{one of the}} jobs he had was as an {{assistant}} for a television game show, Quiz Kid Challenge, an experience he incorporated into the script for Magnolia. He also claimed in interviews that the film is structured somewhat like [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] by The Beatles, and [...] "it kind of builds up, note by note, then drops or recedes, then builds again". The production designers looked at films with close, tight color palettes, films that were warm and analyzed why they did <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> applied it to Magnolia.

Adam Lind commented: [...] "The thing is, a lot of people can teach you how to hit, but not a lot of people can teach you how to hit in the big leagues", referring to the major league experience of Gaston and Tenace.Blue Jays' former center fielder Vernon Wells has said he likes the approach to hitting that Tenace teaches: [...] "One thing Gene talks about is having that approach mentally when you go up there, in your mind you already guarantee yourself that one run on third, but you want to do more than that.

So, basically, I made — well, my manager made — a public statement [...] Simple as <b>that.</b> <b>And</b> <b>then</b> suddenly it was in every headline: 'Madonna is against Napster.' I mean ...

At the same time, I think, to a certain extent, the trading of information is inevitable. And, on the other hand, Napster could be a great way for people to hear your music who wouldn't have the chance to hear it on the radio. So that's what I have to say about that.
