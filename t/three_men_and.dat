Four athletes (<b>three</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> one woman) competed across three sports (Pierre de Windt in track and field, Davy Bisslik and Roshendra Vrolijk in swimming, and Isnardo Faro weightlifting). None of the track or swimming athletes advanced past the first round in their events, and as of Athens, no Arubans had medaled in any events.

Brutus carried his country's flag at the ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|In May 1909, at the {{launching}} ceremony for Danton, socialist activists prevented the ship from leaving the stocks. The ship was eventually launched on 4 July 1909. A week {{after she was}} completed, she {{was sent to the}} United Kingdom in honour of the Coronation of George V in 1911. Upon her return to France, Danton was assigned to the 1st Battle Squadron, along with her sister ships and the two powerful dreadnoughts Courbet and Jean Bart. In 1913, while off Hyères in the Mediterranean, Danton suffered an explosion in one of her gun turrets, which killed <b>three</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> injured several others.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Ark Royal, the Swordfish loaded torpedoes equipped with contact detonators. The second attack comprised fifteen aircraft and was launched at 19:10. At 20:47, the torpedo bombers began their attack descent through the clouds. As the Swordfish approached, Bismarck fired her main battery at Sheffield, straddling the cruiser with her second salvo. Shell fragments rained down on Sheffield, killing <b>three</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> wounding several others. Sheffield quickly retreated {{under cover of}} a smoke screen. The Swordfish then attacked; Bismarck began to turn violently as her anti-aircraft batteries engaged the bombers. One torpedo hit amidships on the port side, just below the bottom edge of the main armour belt. The force of the explosion was largely contained by the underwater protection system and the belt armour but some structural damage caused minor flooding.|$|E
5|$|Four Tanzanian athletes, <b>three</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> one woman, {{qualified}} for the Olympics, all in marathon events. The lone woman was Sara Ramadhani, whose three-year suspension from international competition for testing positive for banned substances at the 2014 Commonwealth Games ended in early 2016. She finished 121st out of 157 participants in the women's marathon. Of the three men, Fabiano Joseph Naasi {{was the only one}} with previous Olympic experience, having taken part in the 5000 and 10,000 m events at the 2004 Games and the 10,000 m in 2008. He had also won a bronze medal in the 10,000 m competition at the 2006 Commonwealth Games and was the World Half Marathon Champion in 2005. In Rio he was 112th out of 155 athletes in the men's marathon. Saidi Makula, who had competed in only two full marathons prior to the Olympics, fared better in 43rd place. Alphonce Felix Simbu, who had been 12th in the marathon at the 2015 World Championships in Athletics, placed fifth, one minute and ten seconds behind Galen Rupp of the United States, the bronze medalist, and 2 minutes, 31 seconds behind winner Eliud Kipchoge of Kenya.|$|E
5|$|The Federated States of Micronesia is a {{collection}} of some 6,000 islands in the South Pacific ocean that includes approximately 100,000 people. The nation is composed of several states that each embody a prominent ethnic group amongst the island group, and lies approximately three-quarters of the way between Hawaii and Indonesia. After World War II, the Micronesian island chain became a United Nations trust territory administered by the United States. The Federated States of Micronesia became an independent country on 1986, but freely associates with the United States, which handles matters of defense. The Federated States of Micronesia sent its first delegation to participate in the Olympics approximately 14 years after it became a sovereign entity, sending <b>three</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> two women to the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Between then and Beijing in 2008, three male and two female Micronesian athletes participating across three sports have appeared at the Olympics at every instance. Prior to Beijing, there had been no medalists from the Federated States of Micronesia; no medals were won by Micronesian athletes at the Beijing games either. Up to and including the Beijing Olympics, weightlifter Manuel Minginfel had been the flagbearer for Micronesia at every opening ceremony.|$|E

5|$|As {{the gang}} exited the {{property}} and made to escape up the cul-de-sac, other police intervened. Sergeant Charles Tucker from Bishopsgate police station was hit twice, once in the hip and once in the heart by Peters: he died instantly. Choate grabbed Gardstein and wrestled for his gun, but the Russian managed to shoot him in the leg. Other members of the gang ran to Gardstein's assistance, shooting Choate twelve times in the process, but Gardstein was also wounded; as the policeman collapsed, Gardstein was carried away by his accomplices, who included Peters. As these men, aided by an unknown woman, made their escape with Gardstein they were accosted by Isaac Levy, a passer-by, whom they threatened at pistol-point. He was the only witness to the escape {{who was able to}} provide firm details; other witnesses confirmed they saw a group of <b>three</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> a woman, and thought one of the men was drunk as he was being helped by his friends. The group, which included Peters, went to Svaars' and Peter the Painter's lodgings at 59 Grove Street (now Goldring Street), off Commercial Road, where Gardstein was tended by two of the gang's associates, Luba Milstein (Svaars' mistress) and Sara Trassjonsky. As they left Gardstein on the bed, Peters left his Dreyse pistol under the mattress, either to make it seem the wounded man {{was the one who had}} killed Tucker, or to enable him to defend himself against a possible arrest.|$|E
5|$|Six Egyptian {{table tennis}} players, <b>three</b> <b>men</b> <b>and</b> three women, {{qualified}} for the Olympics, four for the singles and an additional two for the team events. The four singles competitors, Omar Assar, El-sayed Lashin, Nadeen El-Dawlatly, and Dina Meshref, all qualified based on their achievements at the 2011 All-Africa Games. At this tournament, Assar won the singles event, {{was part of the}} victorious Egyptian team, finished second in the doubles with Emad Moselhy, and placed third in the mixed doubles alongside Meshref. He also won silver in the singles and gold in the team event at the 2011 Pan Arab Games. In London he defeated Yaroslav Zhmudenko of Ukraine in the opening round, but lost to Greece's Panagiotis Gionis in round two. Lashin was the runner-up in the singles at the 2011 All-Africa Games, as well as the winner of the doubles (with Ahmed Saleh), a bronze medalist in the mixed doubles (alongside El-Dawlatly), {{and a member of the}} gold medal-earning Egyptian team. His list of international medals stretched back to the 1996 African Championships, where he won a gold medal in the team event, and he had previously appeared in the Olympic Games in 2000 and 2008. In London he defeated Pär Gerell of Sweden and Zoran Primorac of Croatia before losing to Japan's Jun Mizutani in the third round. For the team event, Assar and Lashin were joined by Saleh, a 2008 Olympic veteran whose victories went as far back at the doubles event at the 1996 Arab Championships, but they were eliminated in the opening round.|$|E
