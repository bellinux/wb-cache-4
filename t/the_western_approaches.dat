5|$|After {{a lengthy}} refit in Canada from October 1944 to February 1945, Kootenay {{returned}} to the UK and was assigned to <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Approaches</b> Command {{until the end of}} the war. She then transported returning troops in Canada until paid off in October. She was sold for scrap in 1946. Duncan was paid off in May and sold in July although she was not completely broken up until 1949.|$|E
5|$|Bellerophon {{returned}} to England in June, before departing to patrol <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Approaches</b> until September. She entered Portsmouth Dockyard again in October and underwent a refit costing £8,103. She resumed patrol and blockade duty in <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Approaches</b> in January 1796, at first under Cranstoun, but from April effectively under the acting-captaincy of Lieutenant John Loring. Cranstoun's replacement, Captain Henry D'Esterre Darby, arrived to take command in September. Blockade duty continued until early January 1797, when news reached the fleet that a French expedition had appeared off Ireland. Caught off guard, the Admiralty ordered Bellerophon {{and a number}} of other ships to patrol off Bantry Bay. By then the French expedition had been dispersed by bad weather, and after three weeks on patrol, Bellerophon put into Cork where she rendezvoused with the Irish squadron under Admiral Robert Kingsmill. Shortly after her return to Spithead in early March, Bellerophon was given new orders by the Admiralty. She sailed on 17 March, bound for Cadiz to join Sir John Jervis's Mediterranean Fleet blockading the port.|$|E
5|$|Bellerophon {{returned}} with the fleet to England after the battle, where the wounded Pasley left the ship. Bellerophon was taken into Portsmouth Dockyard for repairs, and then resumed her patrols in <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Approaches</b> with the Channel Fleet. Captain Hope was superseded in late November, and on 1 December 1794 Bellerophon received a new commander, Captain James Cranstoun, 8th Lord Cranstoun.|$|E

5|$|HMS Harvester was an H-class {{destroyer}} originally {{ordered by}} the Brazilian Navy with the name Jurua in the late 1930s, but bought by the Royal Navy after the beginning of World War II in September 1939. Almost immediately after being commissioned, in May 1940, the ship began evacuating Allied troops from Dunkirk and other locations in France. Afterwards she was assigned to <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Approaches</b> Command for convoy escort duties. Harvester and another destroyer sank a German submarine in October. She was briefly assigned to Force H in May 1941, but her anti-aircraft armament was deemed too weak and she {{was transferred to the}} Newfoundland Escort Force in June 1941 for escort duties in the North Atlantic. The ship was returned to <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Approaches</b> Command in October 1941 and was converted to an escort destroyer in early 1942. Harvester was torpedoed and sunk in March 1943 by a German submarine after having rammed and sunk another submarine the previous day while escorting Convoy HX 228.|$|E
5|$|In the Royal Navy, dazzle paint schemes reappeared in January 1940. These were unofficial, and {{competitions}} {{were often}} held between ships {{for the best}} camouflage patterns. The Royal Navy's Camouflage Department {{came up with a}} scheme devised by a young naval officer, Peter Scott, a wildlife artist, which were developed into <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Approaches</b> Schemes. In 1942 the Admiralty Intermediate Disruptive Pattern came into use, followed in 1944 by the Admiralty Standard Schemes.|$|E
5|$|Later in June, {{the ship}} rejoined the 9th Destroyer Flotilla and {{spent most of}} the next two years escorting convoys. Late in 1940 the Flotilla was redesignated as the 9th Escort Group. Havelock was {{attached}} to Force H in Gibraltar to reinforce the escort during Operations Tiger in May 1941. The ship returned to <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Approaches</b> command afterwards as her anti-aircraft capability was believed by Admiral James Somerville to be too weak for operations in the Mediterranean.|$|E

5|$|April 1794 was a {{month of}} fevered {{activity}} {{on both sides of}} the English Channel as Villaret and Howe made their final preparations for the coming campaign. The slow French convoy had departed American waters on 2 April, and British convoys destined for the Empire had sailed from Portsmouth on 2 May. Howe used his whole force to provide them with protection as far as <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Approaches,</b> and on 5 May sent the frigates HMS Latona and HMS Phaeton close in to Brest to ascertain the status of the French—they reported that Villaret's battlefleet was still in harbour.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} the ship was in poor shape and {{required}} an extensive refit; the work last from 12 November to 17 May 1944 at the North Woolwich, London shipyard of Harland and Wolff. After working up, she {{was assigned to the}} 14th Escort Group for anti-submarine operations in <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Approaches.</b> Duncan conducted convoy escort and anti-submarine operations with the group through April 1945 when she was assigned to the Greenock Coastal Escort Pool. The ship was placed in reserve on 13 May and was transferred to Barrow on 9 June. She approved for immediate disposal on 8 July as she was leaking five tons of water a day. Duncan was turned over to BISCO for scrapping immediately afterwards, but demolition was not completed until 1949.|$|E

5|$|Duncan was {{assigned}} to Escort Group B-7 in the North Atlantic after her conversion was complete in May 1943. She escorted a number of convoys before she required a lengthy refit from November to May 1944. She helped to sink two German submarines in October 1943. The ship {{was assigned}} to anti-submarine duties in <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Approaches</b> after her refit was finished in May 1944, and Duncan remained there until April 1945. At that time she was transferred to coastal anti-submarine patrols to counter any last-gasp effort by the Kriegsmarine {{to interfere with the}} Allied supply lines to the Continent. Placed in reserve the following month, Duncan was in bad shape and was sold for scrap later that year. The demolition, however, was not completed until 1949.|$|E

In November 1811 she sailed to Portsmouth where she was laid up in ordinary. Fitted out as a receiving ship in 1822, she was eventually broken up in January 1836.|$|E
5|$|Foxhound was {{converted}} to an escort destroyer from August 1943 {{and she was}} transferred to Canada on completion on 8 February 1944. The ship was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy that same day as HMCS Qu'Appelle. After working up at the Anti-Submarine Training School at Tobermory on the Isle of Mull, she was assigned to <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Approaches</b> Command. Initially Qu'Appelle {{was a part of}} the 6th Escort Group based at Londonderry Port, but she was transferred to the 12th Escort Group in May where she later patrolled the western entrance to the English Channel after the Normandy landings to protect shipping from German attacks.|$|E

5|$|Grafton {{and three}} of her sisters were {{transferred}} to <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Approaches</b> Command at Plymouth in October. The following month, however, the ship was reassigned {{at the end of}} the month to the 22nd Destroyer Flotilla in Harwich of the Nore Command for patrol and escort duties. On 10 January 1940, she was transferred to the reconstituted 1st Destroyer Flotilla, also based at Harwich, where Grafton inspected ships travelling between German and Dutch ports for contraband. Between 26 March and 14 April the ship was given a brief overhaul in Hull in the shipyard of Brigham and Cowan. As the Norwegian Campaign had begun while Grafton was refitting, she was reassigned to the Home Fleet where she escorted convoys to Norway until 11 May.|$|E
5|$|HMS Encounter was an E-class {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the early 1930s. Although assigned to the Home Fleet upon completion, the ship {{was attached to the}} Mediterranean Fleet in 1935–36 during the Abyssinia Crisis. During the Spanish Civil War of 1936–39, she spent considerable time in Spanish waters, enforcing the arms blockade imposed by Britain and France {{on both sides of the}} conflict. Encounter was assigned to convoy escort and anti-submarine patrol duties in <b>the</b> <b>Western</b> <b>Approaches,</b> when World War II began in September 1939. She participated in the Norwegian Campaign before joining Force H in mid-1940 and was present during the Battles of Dakar and Cape Spartivento later that year. The ship was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in 1941 where she escorted convoys to Malta.|$|E
5|$|HMS Exmouth was an E-class {{destroyer}} flotilla leader {{built for}} the Royal Navy in the early 1930s.
