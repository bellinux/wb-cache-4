40|$|The paper {{reports the}} {{detection}} by the Rosat satellite of a nebula {{associated with the}} nearby pulsar PSR 1929 + 10, which is of a type different from the pulsar-wind nebulae produced by direct interaction of the relativistic wind from older pulsars with the interstellar medium (ISM) (Blandorf et al., 1973). The PSR 1929 + 10 nebula appears as a linear diffuse X-ray feature in the direction opposite to the pulsar's proper motion, with the pulsar wind confined by the ram-pressure arising from the high velocity of the pulsar through the ISM. This results in a <b>trail</b> <b>of</b> relativistic <b>electrons</b> with enhanced emissions of synchrotron radiation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We are {{carrying}} out an R&D project {{to search for}} radar echoes from cosmic ray induced extensive air showers, called TA RAdar (TARA). To test and develop this technique, we have used the Electron Light Source (ELS) electron beams at the Telescope Array site as artificial air showers. A radio transmitter and receivers have been constructed and placed them 140 m from the accelerator beam to search for radar echoes from the <b>trail</b> <b>of</b> the <b>electron</b> beam. In September and December 2012, we have have tried to detect radio signals from ELS <b>electron</b> beams <b>of</b> 40 MeV, 109 electrons with two different beam duration. We have not found any radio echo signals, but we have observed a radio emission from the electron beam. The properties of this emission have also been studied...|$|R
40|$|In {{previous}} work {{we have shown}} that positive streamers in pure nitrogen can be guided by a laser-induced <b>trail</b> <b>of</b> low <b>electron</b> density. Here we show more detailed results from such measurements. We show the sensitivity of this laser-guiding on pressure p {{and found that the}} maximum delay between the laser pulse and voltage pulse for guiding scales with something between $ 1 /p$ and $ 1 /p^{ 2 }$. We also show that when we use a narrower laser beam the laser guiding occurs less frequent and that when we move the laser beam away from the symmetry axis, guiding hardly is observed. Finally we show that laser guiding can also occur in pure argon.

50|$|The DMTPC {{detector}} {{consists of}} a TPC filled with low pressure CF4 gas. Charged particles incident on the gas are slowed and eventually stopped, leaving a <b>trail</b> <b>of</b> free <b>electrons</b> and ionized molecules. The electrons are drifted by an electric field toward an amplification region. Instead of using MWPC endplates for amplification and event readout, as in the traditional TPC design, the DMTPC amplification region {{consists of a}} metal wire mesh separated from a copper anode with a high electric field between them. This creates a more uniform electric field {{in order to preserve}} the shape of the original track during amplification. The avalanche <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> also creates a great deal of scintillation light, which passes through the wire mesh. Some of this light is collected by a CCD camera located outside the main detector volume. This results in a two dimensional image of the ionization signal of the track as it appeared on the amplification plane. Information about the charged particle, including its direction of motion within the detector, can be reconstructed from the CCD readout. Additional track information is obtained from readout of the charge signal on the anode plane.The largest existing prototype detectors each have a total of 20 L of CF4 gas within the drift region, where measurable events will occur. The group also plans to eventually construct a detector with a volume of 1 m3.|$|R
40|$|International audienceHigh-efficiency {{acceleration}} of charged particle beams at high gradients of energy gain {{per unit length}} is necessary to achieve an affordable and compact high-energy collider. The plasma wakefield accelerator is one concept (1 – 3) being developed for this purpose. In plasma wakefield acceleration, a charge-density wake with high accelerating fields {{is driven by the}} passage of an ultra-relativistic bunch of charged particles (the drive bunch) through a plasma (4 – 6). If a second bunch <b>of</b> relativistic <b>electrons</b> (the <b>trailing</b> bunch) with sufficient charge follows {{in the wake of the}} drive bunch at an appropriate distance, it can be efficiently accelerated to high energy. Previous experiments using just a single 42 -gigaelectronvolt drive bunch have accelerated electrons with a continuous energy spectrum and a maximum energy of up to 85 gigaelectronvolts from the tail of the same bunch in less than a metre of plasma (7). However, the total charge <b>of</b> these accelerated <b>electrons</b> was insufficient to extract a substantial amount of energy from the wake. Here we report high-efficiency acceleration <b>of</b> a discrete <b>trailing</b> bunch <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> that contains sufficient charge to extract a substantial amount of energy from the high-gradient, non-linear plasma wakefield accelerator. Specifically, we show the {{acceleration of}} about 74 picocoulombs of charge contained in the core <b>of</b> the <b>trailing</b> bunch in an accelerating gradient of about 4. 4 gigavolts per metre. These core particles gain about 1. 6 gigaelectronvolts of energy per particle, with a final energy spread as low as 0. 7 per cent (2. 0 per cent on average), and an energy-transfer efficiency from the wake to the bunch that can exceed 30 per cent (17. 7 per cent on average). This acceleration of a distinct bunch <b>of</b> <b>electrons</b> containing a substantial charge and having a small energy spread with both a high accelerating gradient and a high energy-transfer efficiency represents a milestone in the development of plasma wakefield acceleration into a compact and affordable accelerator technology...|$|R
