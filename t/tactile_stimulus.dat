2500|$|Behavioral neurobiologists in {{the field}} of neuroethology have {{researched}} this behavior extensively for over fifty years in the crayfish species Procambarus clarkii. Based on studies of P. clarkii it was discovered that the tail- flip mechanism is characterized by a decisive, all-or-nothing quality that inhibits [...] all unnecessary behaviors while generating a fixed action pattern for escape swimming. The type of escape response depends on the region of the crayfish that is stimulated but all forms require abdominal contractions. When a strong, unpleasant <b>tactile</b> <b>stimulus</b> is presented, such as a burst of water or the prod of a probe, a stereotyped behavior occurs in which the muscular tail and wide tail fan region of the telson are used like a paddle to propel the crustacean away from harm using a powerful abdominal flexions. [...] The entire process occurs in {{a fraction of a second}} as movements are generated within two hundredths of a second (20 milliseconds) from the original trigger stimulus and the period of latency after a flexion is a hundredth of a second (10 milliseconds). Finally, the caridoid escape reflex requires that neurons be able to complete the arduous task of synchronizing the flexion of several abdominal segments. [...] The speed, coordination, and decisiveness of the process seem to be the main attributes to its success.|$|E

The direction of gaze (and presumably of visual attention) to space regions near to or far from the site of tactile stimulation had no effect on tactile RT. However, RT to single or dual <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli</b> was fastest when observers could see the sites of tactile stimulation on their hands both directly and through a mirror at the same time.

Double <b>stimuli</b> were unimodal (<b>tactile</b> or visual) or cross-modal (tactile and visual) and could be delivered simultaneously or sequentially at three possible intervals (65, 125, 305 ms). In sequential double trials, left-sided stimuli preceded or followed right-sided stimuli. Subjects were asked to verbally report number (1 or 2), side (left or right) and modality (tactile, visual, visuo-tactile). Control subjects were highly accurate in detecting single and double stimuli. RBD patients detected all right-sided stimuli and left single visual or <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli</b> with high accuracy; however, they omitted left-sided <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli</b> in a high proportion of double trials due to the presence of tactile extinction. Omissions of left-sided <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli</b> were minimal at the longest SOA. Moreover, at 0 and 65 ms SOA omissions were significantly higher in unimodal than in cross-modal combinations. This figure indicates that detection of contralesional <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli</b> is modulated over time both uni- and cross-modally. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

This {{defensive}} withdrawal, known as the Aplysia gill and siphon withdrawal reflex, {{has been the subject of}} much study on learning behaviour. Generally, these studies have involved only weak, tactile stimulation and are therefore more relevant to the question of whether invertebrates can experience nociception, however, some studies have used electric shocks to examine this response (See sections on [...] "Electrical stimulation" [...] and [...] "Operant conditioning").|$|E
50|$|Another {{method for}} testing the proper {{function}} of a nerve is Quantitative sensory testing (QST). QST relies on analysis of a patient's response to external stimuli of controlled intensity. A stimulus {{is applied to the}} skin of the nerve area being tested in ascending and descending orders of magnitude. Clinicians can quantify the mechanical sensitivity of the <b>tactile</b> <b>stimulus</b> using von Frey hairs or Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments. Also, weighted needles can be used to measure pin-prick sensation, and an electronic vibrameter is used to measure vibration sensitivity. Thermal stimuli are quantified by using a probe that operates on the Peltier principle.|$|E
50|$|Rather than {{a simple}} {{withdrawal}} reflex, the flatworm, Notoplana aticola, displays a locomotory escape behaviour following pin pricks to the posterior end. Touching the larvae of fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, with a probe causes them to pause and {{move away from the}} stimulus, however, stronger mechanical stimulation evokes a more complex corkscrew-like rolling behaviour, i.e. the response is plastic. When a weak <b>tactile</b> <b>stimulus</b> is applied to the siphon of the sea-hare Aplysia californica, the animal rapidly withdraws the siphon between the parapodia. It is sometimes claimed this response is an involuntary reflex (e.g. see Aplysia gill and siphon withdrawal reflex), however, the complex learning associated with this response (see 'Learned Avoidance' below) suggests this view might be overly simplistic.|$|E
40|$|Observers made {{temporal}} order judgements (TOJs) regarding {{which of}} two <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli</b> presented to either hand (at stimulus onset asynchronies {{of up to}} 200 ms) occurred first. When the observers' hands were placed in an uncrossed posture (i. e., each hand in its own hemispace), performance was accurate, with a just noticeable difference (JND; the smallest interval which produces 75 % correct performance) of 34 ms. By contrast, when the hands were crossed over the midline, performance declined such that 124 ms was needed for accurate performance. In a second experiment, we presented visual instead of <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli</b> to evaluate the relative contribution of motor and perceptual confusions to the effect. While performance with crossed hands was significantly worse than with uncrossed hands (JND= 36 vs. 31 ms, respectively), this difference was negligible compared to that with <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli.</b> In a third experiment, experienced observers showed a robust crossed-hands deficit which was not improved by using different fingers on either hand. We argue that the decline in tactile discrimination performance when the hands are crossed reflects a failure to represent appropriately near simultaneous bimanual <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli,</b> and stands {{in marked contrast to}} many recent observations of efficient remapping of singly-presented <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli...</b>|$|R

An experiment is reported {{that was designed to}} assess whether the subjective perception of <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli</b> on the torso changes as people turn their heads in different directions. Our participants used a scale presented on a computer monitor to indicate {{the perceived}} position of vibrotactile stimuli presented to one of eight different positions around the frontal side of their waist while they either looked straight ahead, turned their head to the left, or else turned their head to the right. The results showed that the perceived location of <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli</b> was systematically influenced by head orientation. In particular, the perceived location of the <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli</b> shifted away from their actual position in the direction opposite to the direction of the participant's head turn. Our results also revealed a systematic decline in the accuracy of tactile localization {{as a function of the}} physical distance of the <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli</b> from the participant's navel. These results echo related findings in the auditory domain where it has been shown that changes in eye position affect auditory lateralization.

Kandel had realized that simple forms of learning such as habituation, sensitization, classical conditioning, and operant conditioning could readily be studied with ganglia isolated from Aplysia. [...] "While recording the behavior of a single cell in a ganglion, one nerve axon pathway to the ganglion could be stimulated weakly electrically as a conditioned <b>tactile</b> <b>stimulus,</b> while another pathway was stimulated as an unconditioned pain stimulus, following the exact protocol used for classical conditioning with natural stimuli in intact animals." [...] Electrophysiological changes resulting from the combined stimuli could then be traced to specific synapses. In 1965 Kandel published his initial results, including a form of presynaptic potentiation that seemed to correspond to a simple form of learning.|$|E
50|$|Patients with tactile {{extinction}} {{are aware}} of being touched on a contralesional limb, but seem unaware of similar contralesional touch if touched simultaneously on their ipsilesional limb. In the tactile, extinction occurs in the domains of {{at the level of}} the hands, the face-neck, the arms-legs, both in case of symmetrical and asymmetrical stimulations, or between the two sides of a single body-part. Extinguished <b>tactile</b> <b>stimulus</b> does not access consciousness but it may interfere with perception of the ipsilesional one. Considerable processing can still take place prior to the level at which loss of awareness arises. The extinction can also rise in bilateral conditions. In a patient study, bilateral trials with extinction still revealed residual early components over the right hemisphere in response to the extinguished left touches. When somatosensory neural activity in the right hemisphere was reduced in amplitude when compared to the one by right hand stimulation on the left hemisphere. So it can be concluded that tactile extinction is defined in conditions of bilateral stimulation and perhaps unilateral stimulation as well. Extinction arises at a high level of tactile input processing.|$|E

40|$|Crossing {{the hands}} over the midline impairs the ability to {{correctly}} judge {{the order of a}} pair of <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli,</b> delivered in rapid succession, one to each hand. This impairment, termed crossed-hands deficit, has been attributed to a mismatch between the somatotopic and body-centred frames of reference, onto which somatosensory stimuli are automatically mapped. Whether or not such crossed-hands deficit occurs also when delivering nociceptive stimuli has not been previously investigated. In this study, participants performed a temporal order judgement (TOJ) task in which pairs of either nociceptive or <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli</b> were delivered, one to each hand, while their arms were either crossed over the body midline or uncrossed. We observed that crossing the {{hands over the}} midline significantly decreases the ability to determine the stimulus order when a pair of nociceptive stimuli is delivered to the hands, and that this crossed-hands deficit has a temporal profile similar to that observed for <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli.</b> These findings suggest that similar mechanisms for integrating somatotopic and body-centred frames of reference underlie the ability to localise both nociceptive and <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli</b> in space...|$|R

Here, we investigated whether crossmodal spatial effects (i. e. stronger crossmodal interactions for spatially congruent compared to incongruent visual and <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli)</b> are also present when visual stimuli presented near the body are indirectly viewed in a mirror, thus appearing in far space. Participants had to attend {{to one of their}} hands throughout a block of stimuli in order to detect infrequent <b>tactile</b> target <b>stimuli</b> at that hand while ignoring tactile targets at the unattended hand, all <b>tactile</b> non-target <b>stimuli,</b> and any visual stimuli. Visual stimuli were presented simultaneously with <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli,</b> in the same (congruent) or opposite (incongruent) hemispace with respect to the <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli.</b> In one group of participants the visual stimuli were delivered near the participants’ hands and were observed as indirect mirror reflections (‘mirror’ condition), while in the other group these were presented at a distance from the hands (‘far’ condition). The main finding was that crossmodal spatial modulations of ERPs recorded over and close to somatosensory cortex were present in the ‘mirror’ condition but not the ‘far’ condition. That is, ERPs were enhanced in response to <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli</b> coupled with spatially congruent versus incongruent visual stimuli when the latter were viewed through a mirror. These effects emerged around 190 ms after stimuli onset, and were modulated by the focus of spatial attention. These results provide evidence that visual stimuli observed in far space via a mirror are coded as near-thebody stimuli according to their known rather than to their perceived location. This suggests that crossmodal interactions between vision and touch may be modulated by previous knowledge of reflecting surfaces (i. e. top-down processing) ...|$|R
50|$|Research has {{occurred}} to designate a specific neural correlate of imagery; however, studies show {{a multitude of}} results. Most studies published before 2001 suggest neural correlates of visual imagery occur in brodmann area 17. Auditory performance imagery have been observed in the premotor areas, precunes, and medial brodmann area 40. Auditory imagery in general occurs across participants in the temporal voice area (TVA), which allows top-down imaging manipulations, processing, and storage of audition functions. Olfactory imagery research shows activation in the anterior piriform cortex and the posterior piriform cortex; experts in olfactory imagery have larger gray matter associated to olfactory areas. Tactile imagery is found {{to occur in the}} dorsolateral prefrontal area, inferior frontal gyrus, frontal gyrus, insula, precentral gyrus, and the medial frontal gyrus with basil ganglia activation in the ventral posteriomedial nucleus and putamen (hemisphere activation corresponds to the location of the imagined <b>tactile</b> <b>stimulus).</b> Research in gustatory imagery reveals activation in the anterior insular cortex, frontal operculum, and prefrontal cortex. Novices of a specific form of mental imagery show less gray matter than experts of mental imagery congruent to that form. A meta-analysis of neuroimagery studies revealed significant activation of the bilateral dorsal parietal, interior insula, and left inferior frontal regions of the brain.|$|E
5000|$|Tactile Hallucinations are {{the result}} of a {{dysfunctional}} somatosensory and a dysfunctional awareness regions of the brain. Tactile sensory input is produced and conducted through the spinal cord and thalamus and it is received at the primary somatosensory cortex. Once it has reached the primary somatosensory cortex, it is distributed across the brain and it will not be processed unless it is important and one pays close attention to the information based on a specific context. Consciousness to these specific tactile sensations is generated only through multiple feedback loops passing through higher cortical areas such as secondary somatosensory area, parietal, insular cortex and premotor areas. The intensity of the <b>tactile</b> <b>stimulus</b> is directly proportional to the area of the primary somatosensory region activated. [...] A feedback mechanism from different cortical areas results in the awareness of touch. Even with complete sensory deprivation, discrete tactile memories can trigger spontaneous firing of impaired neurons. Therefore, individuals with various psychiatric disorders are more prone to tactile hallucinations than normal individuals.Tactile hallucinations are especially possible due to faulty sensory integration of neuronal signals in the primary and secondary somatosensory system with neuronal signals in the parietal cortex, insular cortex and premotor cortex. Moreover, the posterior insula is responsible for mental body schema representation and can produce tactile hallucination if defected. Additionally, {{it is interesting to note}} that the regions of the brain involved in tactile hallucinations are similar to the regions of the brain involved in pain.|$|E

Perceptual threshold values for auditory-tactile asynchrony were measured using a broadband noise for the auditory stimulus (presented to the subjects via headphones) and a sinusoidal wave for the <b>tactile</b> <b>stimulus</b> (presented {{at the tip of}} the index finger via a shaker). In the first experiment, subjects were asked to make a three-alternative forced-choice judgment whether the audio stimulus and the <b>tactile</b> <b>stimulus</b> were synchronous, the audio stimulus preceded the <b>tactile</b> <b>stimulus,</b> or the <b>tactile</b> <b>stimulus</b> preceded the audio stimulus. Stimuli with audio delays in the range of – 26 to 51 ms were judged synchronous. In the second experiment, the judgement was whether the auditory stimulus and the <b>tactile</b> <b>stimulus</b> were synchronous or asynchronous. The results showed that stimuli with audio delays in the range of – 24 to 50 ms were judged synchronous.

The {{aim of this study}} was to demonstrate the occurrence of SR in spinal and cortical evoked field potentials (EFPs) elicited by periodic <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli</b> in the anesthetized cat. The electrodes were positioned in spinal and cortical somatosensory regions in which the largest negative EFPs were detected. The periodic <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli</b> consisted of local skin displacements on the central pad of the hindpaw. Two series of experiments were performed. First, periodic <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli</b> and the noisy <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli</b> were applied with the same indenter. Second, noisy <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli</b> were applied with an additional indenter placed on the glabrous skin of the third hindpaw digit. This last protocol ensured that the signal and noise were mixed not in the skin but in the somatosensory regions of the CNS. All cats showed distinct SR behavior at the spinal and cortical stages of the sensory encoding. Such SR was abolished in the cortical but not in the spinal recording after sectioning of the dorsal columns and the ipsilateral dorsolateral funiculus. This suggests that the spinal neurons may also contribute to the SR observed at the cortical level. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented evidence that such a remarkable phenomenon embodies electrical processes of the spinocortical somatosensory system itself.

40|$|Processing of <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli</b> {{requires}} both localising {{the stimuli}} {{on the body}} surface and combining this information with {{a representation of the}} current posture. When <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli</b> are applied to crossed hands, the system first assumes a prototypical (e. g. uncrossed) positioning of the limbs. Remapping to include the crossed posture occurs within about 300 ms. Since fingers have been suggested to be represented in a mainly somatotopic reference frame we were interested in how the processing of <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli</b> applied to the fingers would be affected by an unusual posture of the fingers. We asked participants to report the direction of movement of two <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli,</b> applied successively to the crossed or uncrossed index and middle fingers of one hand at different inter-stimulus intervals (15 to 700 ms). Participants almost consistently reported perceiving the stimulus direction as opposite to what it was in the fingers crossed condition, even with SOAs of 700 ms, suggesting that on average they did not incorporate the unusual relative finger positions. Therefore our results are in agreement with the idea that, by default, the processing of <b>tactile</b> <b>stimuli</b> assumes a prototypical positioning of body parts. However, in contrast to what is generally found with tactile perception with crossed hands, performance did not improve with SOAs as long as 700 ms.
