5|$|All of the German gun <b>turrets</b> {{initially}} {{allowed for}} elevation to 13.5degrees, although {{after the battle}} of Jutland, they were modified to allow elevation to 16degrees. The centerline <b>turrets</b> on the warships could train 150degrees in either direction, though the wing <b>turrets</b> on the Helgoland and Kaiser classes were limited to an arc of 80degrees in either direction.|$|E
5|$|The Bismarcks' use of four twin <b>turrets</b> (the 4 × 2 configuration) was {{a design}} {{practice}} that hearkened {{back to the}} First World War. Almost all other post-1921 capital ships had triple or even quadruple <b>turrets,</b> which allowed for additional heavy caliber guns, while {{reducing the number of}} <b>turrets.</b> Fewer <b>turrets</b> reduced the length of the battleship's armored citadel (particularly magazine length and the armor needed to protect it) and shortened the vessel itself. Although triple <b>turrets</b> were considered for the Bismarcks, there were concerns that the extra barrel would lower the overall rate of fire in each turret, along with fears that a single well-aimed hit could disable a larger proportion of the ship's firepower. It was also felt that four twin <b>turrets</b> allowed for a better field of fire and a more effective sequence of salvoes.|$|E
5|$|The {{suggestion}} that her building had been sped up by using guns and/or <b>turrets</b> originally {{designed for the}} s which preceded her is not borne out as the guns and <b>turrets</b> were not ordered until July 1905. It seems more likely that Dreadnoughts <b>turrets</b> and guns merely received higher priority {{than those of the}} earlier ships.|$|E
50|$|The Panther II was to {{be fitted}} with a new <b>turret,</b> the Schmalturm <b>turret.</b> This <b>turret</b> had a {{stereoscopic}} rangefinder with lenses {{on either side of}} the <b>turret,</b> located in spherical bulges. The <b>turret</b> design maximised protection by minimising the frontal surface.|$|R
25|$|As of March 1895 it {{was noted}} the design had {{considerable}} acceptance with nine ships afloat; <b>Turret,</b> <b>Turret</b> Age, <b>Turret</b> Bay, Bencliff, <b>Turret</b> Bell, Progressist, Royalist, Hopedale and Forest Abbey, with five more under construction.|$|R
50|$|The Schmalturm <b>turret</b> was a tank <b>turret</b> {{designed}} for use on the Panzer V Ausf. B Panther II medium tank, Panther A and G medium tank, Panzer IV Ausf. J medium tank and the VK 30.02 DB (a medium tank prototype). The <b>turret's</b> shape resembled the Soviet T-34 tank <b>turret.</b> It featured a narrow front to maximize protection while minimizing weight. It was both lighter and easier-to-manufacture than the standard Panther <b>turret.</b> The <b>turret</b> had a stereoscopic rangefinder with lenses {{on either side of}} the <b>turret,</b> located in spherical bulges. No Schmalturms entered series production.|$|R
5|$|The <b>turrets</b> {{aboard the}} Nagato-class ships were {{replaced}} in the mid-1930s, using the <b>turrets</b> stored from the unfinished s. While in storage the <b>turrets</b> were modified {{to increase their}} range of elevation to –3°/+43°, which gave them a maximum range of , and their firing cycle was reduced to 21.5 seconds.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} work stopped, Normandies hull was 65percent complete, her engines were 70percent complete, and her boilers were {{delivered}} but were instead installed in new destroyers. The <b>turrets</b> were 40percent assembled. Languedoc had 49percent of her hull and 73percent of her engines constructed; her boilers were 96percent complete and only 26percent of her <b>turrets</b> were built. The hulls of Flandre and Gascogne were 65 and 60percent complete, respectively, and their engines were 60 and 44percent assembled. Both of their sets of boilers {{were used for}} destroyers. The two ships' <b>turrets</b> were 51 and 75percent complete. Work on Béarn had not significantly progressed by the time war broke out: her hull was only 8–10percent complete and her engines were only 25percent finished. Her boilers were 17percent assembled, and her <b>turrets</b> were at 20percent.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the battle, two of Von der Tanns main <b>turrets</b> were knocked out by British gunfire, while her other two <b>turrets</b> {{suffered}} mechanical failures. The ship was firing so fast that several of the main guns in the amidships <b>turrets</b> became overheated and jammed in their recoil slides, and could not be returned to working order. Von der Tann was without her main battery for 11hours, although three <b>turrets</b> were restored to working order {{before the end of the}} battle; Dturret only after much cutting away of bent metal with oxyacetylene torches—afterwards the guns could be worked only by hand. Her casualties amounted to 11 dead and 35 wounded. During the battle Von der Tann fired 170 heavy shells and 98 secondary caliber shells.|$|E
50|$|<b>Turret</b> Two {{was trained}} forward {{with its own}} {{mechanism}} after the explosion, and superficial repairs were conducted. All the related repair pieces were stored inside the <b>turret</b> and the <b>turret</b> was sealed shut. The <b>turret</b> was never put back into operation.|$|R
25|$|The cast <b>turret</b> has a ring {{diameter}} of 85inches (the {{same as the}} M48). The frontal <b>turret</b> armor is 178mm, and the sides are 78mm. The shape of the <b>turret</b> is elongated compared to the M48. The gunner’s seat is situated {{to the right of}} the main gun in the front of the <b>turret.</b> The commander’s seat is also in the <b>turret</b> with a built-in 12.7 mm M2 machine gun, with an M28 periscopic sight for aiming. For 360-degree vision, 5 armored viewports are installed in the <b>turret.</b> Primary shells are stored in the lower section of the <b>turret,</b> beneath the ring.|$|R
50|$|According to Thompson, Iowas <b>Turret</b> Two {{was trained}} forward after the {{explosion}} to its stowed position and superficial repairs were conducted.

5|$|Malta's fortifications are {{featured}} {{a number of}} times on the islands' heraldry. The coat of arms of Malta contains a mural crown in gold with a sally port and eight <b>turrets</b> (five of which are visible), which represents the fortifications as well as Malta's status as a city-state. The coats of arms of the five regions of Malta have a similar crown but with five <b>turrets,</b> all of which are visible. A mural crown with four visible <b>turrets</b> can be seen on the coats of arms of Valletta, Mdina and Birgu, indicating their status as capital city or former capitals. Another version with four <b>turrets</b> (three visible) can be seen on the coats of arms of Cospicua, Senglea, Qormi, Siġġiewi, Żabbar, Żebbuġ, Żejtun and Victoria, indicating the status of a city.|$|E
5|$|T-26 model 1931: twin-turreted version {{armed with}} two DT tank machine guns. The first {{series-produced}} {{variant of the}} T-26 that was equipped with <b>turrets</b> differing from the initial Vickers design (Soviet <b>turrets</b> were higher and had an observation window). Tanks produced from 1931 to March 1932 had a riveted hull and <b>turrets,</b> a silencer affixed with two clamps, and lacked any cover over the air outlet window. About 1,177 T-26 mod. 1931 tanks armed with machine guns were accepted by the Red Army, which had 1,015 such twin-turreted tanks on 1 April 1933.|$|E
5|$|The Fire Control Switchboard {{configured}} the battery. With it, the Gunnery Officer could mix {{and match}} the three <b>turrets</b> to the two GFCSs. He could have the <b>turrets</b> all controlled by the forward system, all controlled by the aft system, or split the battery to shoot at two targets.|$|E
50|$|The cast <b>turret</b> has a ring {{diameter}} of 85 inches (the {{same as the}} M48). The frontal <b>turret</b> armor is 178 mm, and the sides are 78 mm.

50|$|This was the {{justification}} for the first oscillating <b>turret,</b> that of the French AMX-50 medium or heavy tank in the 50 tonnes class. This used first a 90 mm, then 100 mm, gun in an oscillating <b>turret,</b> primarily to save weight. The final 120 mm version first reverted to a conventional <b>turret,</b> but then used another oscillating design, the Tourelle D. However the need to elevate the gun still requires room for the breech to be lowered into the lower <b>turret.</b> This has tended to produce oscillating <b>turret</b> designs with a high gun axis relative to a conventional <b>turret,</b> even where the <b>turret</b> height is otherwise shallow.|$|R
50|$|A Sperry ball <b>turret</b> and a Bendix chin <b>turret</b> were acquired, renovated and re-installed in the aircraft. A top <b>turret</b> dome {{has been}} fitted along with cheek {{guns in the}} nose compartment. A {{replacement}} Cheyenne tail <b>turret</b> was obtained and restored to its World War II configuration.|$|R
5|$|The Russians did {{not believe}} that super firing <b>turrets</b> offered any {{advantage}} as they discounted the value of axial fire, believed that broadside fire was much more important and also believed that super firing <b>turrets</b> could not fire while over the lower turret because of muzzle blast interfering with the open sighting hoods in the lower turret's roof. They therefore designed the ships with a 'linear' arrangement (lineinoe raspolozhenie) of <b>turrets</b> distributed over the length of the ship. This arrangement had several advantages because it reduced the stress on the ends of the ship since the <b>turrets</b> were not concentrated {{at the end of the}} ship, increased stability because the lack of elevated <b>turrets</b> and their barbettes, improved the survivability of the ship because the magazines were separated from each other and gave a lower silhouette. Disadvantages were that the magazines had to be put in the middle of all the machinery, which required steam pipes to be run through or around them and the lack of deck space free from blast. This greatly complicated the placement of the anti-torpedo boat guns which ultimately had to be mounted in the hull, closer to the water than was desirable.|$|E
5|$|The St Vincent {{class was}} {{equipped}} with ten breech-loading (BL) 12-inch (305mm) Mk XI guns in five twin-gun <b>turrets,</b> three along the centreline and the remaining two as wing <b>turrets.</b> The secondary, or anti-torpedo boat, armament comprised twenty BL 4-inch (102mm) Mk VII guns. Two of these guns were each installed on the roofs of the fore and aft centreline <b>turrets</b> and the wing <b>turrets</b> in unshielded mounts, and the other ten were positioned in the superstructure. All guns were in single mounts. The ships were also fitted with three 18-inch (450mm) torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and the third in the stern.|$|E
5|$|The {{design for}} the ships was drawn up between 1910 and 1912. Consideration was given to {{equipping}} the new ships with triple <b>turrets</b> mounting the 30.5cm (12in) guns of the preceding s, but after examining the gun <b>turrets</b> of the Austro-Hungarian dreadnoughts of the , {{it was determined that}} the triple gun <b>turrets</b> still had too many problems. Among these deficiencies were increased weight, reduced ammunition supply and rate of fire, and loss of fighting capability if one of the <b>turrets</b> was disabled. It was therefore decided to arm the new vessels with eight 38cm guns instead of twelve 30.5cm guns.|$|E
50|$|An {{oscillating}} <b>turret</b> {{is a form}} of <b>turret</b> for armoured fighting vehicles, both {{tanks and}} armoured cars. The <b>turret</b> is unusual in being made of two hinged parts. Elevation of the gun relies on {{the upper part of the}} <b>turret</b> moving relative to the lower part.|$|R
50|$|A ball <b>turret</b> was a spherical-shaped, {{altazimuth}} mount gun <b>turret,</b> {{fitted to}} some American-built aircraft during World War II. The name {{arose from the}} <b>turret's</b> spherical housing.|$|R

5|$|The primary {{armament}} of the Kongō class {{consisted of}} eight 45-calibre 14-inch guns, mounted in four superfiring twin-gun <b>turrets.</b> The <b>turrets</b> had an elevation capability of 5/+20 degrees except in Kongō whose <b>turrets</b> had a maximum elevation capability of +25 degrees. The shells could be loaded at any angle and the guns had a firing cycle of 30–40 seconds. These guns and their <b>turrets</b> underwent multiple modernizations throughout the ships' careers. During the first {{reconstruction of the}} class during the 1920s, the elevation of the main guns was increased {{to a maximum of}} +33 degrees. The recoil mechanism of the guns was also changed from a hydraulic to pneumatic system, which allowed for a faster firing cycle of the main guns.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} fitted with flying-off {{platforms}} {{mounted on the}} roofs of 'B' and 'X' <b>turrets</b> in 1918, from which fighters and reconnaissance aircraft could launch. In 1934 the platforms {{were removed from the}} <b>turrets</b> and a catapult was installed on the roof of 'X' turret, along with a crane to recover a seaplane.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{carried a}} {{secondary}} battery of twelve 15cm SK C/28 L/55 quick-firing guns. The guns were mounted in four Drh L. C/34 twin <b>turrets</b> and four MPL/35 pedestal mounts. Both the <b>turrets</b> and pedestal mounts enabled barrel depression to −10°; the <b>turrets</b> allowed elevation to 40° while the pedestals limited it to 35°. These guns fired 45.3kg (99.87lb) shells {{at a rate}} of 6–8 per minute. They were expected to fire 1,100rounds before barrel wear made repair or replacement necessary. The guns in pedestals had a range of 22,000m (24,060yd), while those in the <b>turrets,</b> capable of 5more degrees of elevation, had a slightly longer range, at 23,000m (25,153yd). They were supplied with between 1,600–1,800shells, or 133–150 shells per gun.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Turret</b> 49A (TW) (...) was {{constructed}} when the turf wall was built. The <b>turret</b> was demolished when the Birdoswald fort was built.

2500|$|<b>Turret</b> 7B (Denton Hall <b>Turret</b> or Denton <b>Turret)</b> is {{the most}} easterly extant <b>turret.</b> It stands up to six courses high and is made from sandstone. The <b>turret</b> was placed under English Heritage {{guardianship}} by 1971. It, and the attached wall, are maintained as a single property by English Heritage (known as [...] "Denton Hall Turret"). The organisation operates the property as an open access site with no entrance fees.|$|R
5|$|It {{was found}} that the A-43 <b>turret</b> was very tight for two crewmembers; it had {{insufficient}} observation field; there was no <b>turret</b> ventilation, which made continuous gunfire difficult; {{and it was hard to}} rotate the <b>turret</b> manually. At the beginning of 1933, a new 76mm KT tank gun mod. 1927/32 with reduced (from 900mm to 500mm) recoil length was installed into the A-43 <b>turret.</b> The <b>turret</b> was still a very tight place for crew members. The ammunition stowage for 54 rounds was unsuccessful, and the military refused the A-43 <b>turret.</b>|$|R
5|$|Chesma {{was named}} after the Russian victory at the Battle of Chesma in 1770. She was built by the Russian Steam Navigation Company (RoPIT) at Sevastopol. She was laid down in late June 1883, {{launched}} on 18 May 1886, and completed on 29 May 1889. She served with the Black Sea Fleet until 1907. She was inactive in 1895, probably for mechanical problems. Chesma conducted trials in 1902 with towing spherical observation balloons and she was re-boilered the following year. Plans were made for a radical reconstruction to be done while her boilers were being replaced. The rebuilding involved cutting her down by one deck and replacing her armament with two twin-gun <b>turrets</b> equipped with 12-inch 40-caliber guns and ten 6-inch 45-caliber guns between the <b>turrets</b> in an armoured citadel that used Krupp armor. This proved to be too expensive and it was cancelled, but not before the armor and <b>turrets</b> had been ordered. Her <b>turrets</b> were used to equip the pre-dreadnought , then under construction.|$|E
5|$|Each gun rested {{within an}} armored turret, {{but only the}} top of the turret {{protruded}} above the main deck. The turret extended either four decks (<b>Turrets</b> 1 and 3) or five decks (Turret 2) down. The lower spaces contained the equipment required to rotate the turret and to elevate the guns attached to each turret. At the bottom of the turret were rooms which were used for handling the projectiles and storing the powder bags used to fire them. All of the compartments within the <b>turrets</b> were separated by flameproof bulkheads to prevent any flame or lethal gas from spreading throughout the turret. Each turret required a crew of 7794 men to operate. The <b>turrets</b> were not actually attached to the ship, but sat on rollers, which meant that if the ship were to capsize the <b>turrets</b> would fall out. Each turret cost US $1.4 million, but this number did not include the cost of the guns themselves.|$|E
5|$|Fragile Allegiance has {{a simplistic}} combat {{system with the}} player having no direct control over units when a fleet enters combat. Enemy asteroids can be {{attacked}} using ships, missiles and agents. During a battle, laser beams criss-cross the screen and buildings catch fire before being destroyed.
