40|$|In 2007, the {{collapse}} of the housing market and the developing trend of state court filings of class actions alleging violations of <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act culminated into a new type of securities litigation: state court filings of class actions alleging violations of <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act with respect to non-publicly traded securities in general and mortgage-backed securities in particular. Thus, it became important for defendants to remove these claims to federal court. Permitting removal of such claims appears to conflict with <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act, which broadly prohibits removal of claims arising under <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act. But prohibiting removal is in tension with the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, which generally permits removal of class actions. This article considers whether <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act bars removal of class actions alleging violations of <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act with respect to non-publicly traded securities. Part I of this article provides a background on the issue and explains the general framework of removal and the conflicting provisions of <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act and <b>the</b> Class Action Fairness Act. Next, Part II discusses the Ninth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s holding in Luther v. Countrywide that <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act bars removal of a class action alleging violations of <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act with respect to mortgage-backed securities. Part III analyzes the Seventh Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Katz v. Gerardi, in which the court disagreed with Luther and held that <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act does not bar removal of class actions that allege violations of <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act with respect to non-publicly traded securities. Finally, Part IV analyzes and expands on the reasoning of the Luther and Katz courts, concluding that the Seventh Circuit decided correctly that <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act does not bar removal of class actions alleging violations of <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act with respect to non-publicly traded securities...|$|R
5|$|In 1956, over 9,000 socialist and populist {{politicians}} were released from prison. A few Jewish functionaries of <b>the</b> <b>security</b> forces {{were brought to}} court {{in the process of}} de-Stalinization. According to Heather Laskey, it was not a coincidence that the high ranking Stalinist security officers put on trial by Gomułka were Jews. Władysław Gomułka was captured by Światło, imprisoned by Romkowski in 1951 and interrogated by both, him and Fejgin. Gomułka escaped physical torture only as a close associate of Joseph Stalin, and was released three years later. According to some sources, the categorization of <b>the</b> <b>security</b> forces as a Jewish institution—as disseminated in the post-war anticommunist press at various times—was rooted in Żydokomuna: the belief that the secret police was predominantly Jewish became one of the factors contributing to the post-war view of Jews as agents of <b>the</b> <b>security</b> forces.|$|E
