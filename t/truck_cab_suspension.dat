Based on this model the LQG optimization control was selected for the active control of a 1 / 2 heavy <b>truck</b> <b>cab</b> <b>suspension</b> system. The road disturbance is integral white noise stochastic signal. By the example simulation in Matlab/Simulink, the results show that the cab active suspension with LQG control strategy can decrease the vertical accelerations, the roll angle and roll angle acceleration of the truck cab, the active suspension can improve both the ride comfort and driving safety. ...|$|E

This method is specifically intended {{for measuring the}} inertia properties of irregular rigid bodies, {{and it has the}} potential to be applied to the measurement of the inertia properties of vehicle bodies, such as the cab, engine, and gearbox. This article, based on CATARC moment of inertia measurement system test rig, develops an accurate measuring method to identify inertia parameters of heavy <b>truck</b> <b>cab.</b> First, corresponding tests are carried out, and the lever principle and moments of inertia parallel theorem are employed to calculate and analyse the test results, which leads to the accurate value of inertia parameters.

40|$|Truck driving {{can be a}} {{hazardous}} occupation. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2009 truck drivers experienced 16. 8 % of all transportation-related fatalities and 2. 04 % of the nonfatal injuries requiring days away from work, even though they only made up 1. 0 % of the U. S. workforce. Truck drivers spend long hours behind the wheel, working an average of 41. 5 hours per week. Therefore, a well-designed <b>truck</b> <b>cab</b> can make {{a significant difference in}} the working conditions for a <b>truck</b> driver. <b>Truck</b> <b>cab</b> design impacts comfort, but more importantly impacts the safety of truck drivers and other road users. For example, if the design of the <b>truck</b> <b>cab</b> is poorly fitted to the size and dimensions of the driver, the road may be less visible, driving controls may be more difficult to reach, and seatbelts may be less comfortable and less likely to be used - all of which increase the risk of injury to the driver and other road users. Truck manufacturers consider the body dimensions of truck drivers as they design <b>truck</b> <b>cabs.</b> However, until recently the most current body measurement data for truck drivers dated from the early 1980 s. The composition of the trucker workforce has changed dramatically in the past 30 years, with an increase in the diversity of ethnic groups and the percentage of women working in this profession. As the truck manufacturing industry moves forward to design the next generation of <b>truck</b> <b>cabs,</b> there is a pressing need for up-to-date information on the body dimensions of U. S. truck drivers. " - NIOSHTIC- 2 "August 2011 " - [URL] back: Logo for the Research to Practice at NIOSH initiative (r 2 p).

40|$|Agricultural {{machinery}} {{drivers are}} exposed to low-frequency vibrations during their work. The terrain profile, the long operating times, the forward speed of the agricultural machine and the sitting position are the key factors {{that lead to the}} suffering {{of the back of the}} agricultural machinery drivers. Suspensions systems are produced in order to reduce the health risks and the discomfort to the driver and to enable the driver to work at a faster pace. The suspension systems isolate the driver from the machine vibrations as much as possible. Modelling the motions of the suspension systems is useful to acquire insight in the dynamic characteristics of these suspensions and for design purposes. In this paper, a linear model of a <b>cab</b> <b>suspension</b> of a self-propelled agricultural machine with six degrees of freedom is developed, based on Lagrange's equation. The model takes into account the kinetic energy of the suspension and the virtual work executed on the <b>cab</b> <b>suspension.</b> The model of the <b>cab</b> <b>suspension</b> is validated by comparing the behaviour of the model with the behaviour of an experimental test rig for different vibration signals.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of the work was to study the {{possibilities}} of using the <b>cab</b> <b>suspension</b> technique to improve the driver’s environment on an agricultural tractor. Two simulation models describing the frame-suspension-cab system were developed: A nonlinear model for studying the characteristics for suspensions with only small constrictions on the geometry and on the working principles of the elements, and a linear model which is a simplified description of the same system including more constraints, but more applicable when designing and studying performance particularly for active suspensions. The simulation models were validated against measurements made on a full-scale <b>cab</b> <b>suspension.</b> The influence of different passive suspension parameters on vibration damping capacity and the requirement for free space in the construction were investigated. Panicular {{emphasis was placed on}} the effects of passive non•linear suspension elements and varying locations of the elements. An optimization model, based on an evolution algorithm, was developed and used to optimize parameters in a passive suspension with different types of generally defined constraints. The development and analysis of LQG based active <b>cab</b> <b>suspensions</b> are described. The vibration damping characteristics of the suspensions are studied. The change in characteristics when the suspension’s configuration or design variables are changed is also studied. The results show that an active <b>cab</b> <b>suspension</b> based on linear state feedback must have time variant adaptive characteristics to be really useful. An adaptive active suspension controller based on LQG technique has been developed and studied. The principle for the adaptation is based on the parameters in the penalty matrices being varied so that the resulting controller always strives to make optimum use of the available travel space...|$|R
