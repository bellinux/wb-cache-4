There are numerous illustrations in our vast Puranic and epic literature to show how well and wonderfully the ancient Indians conquered the air. To glibly characterized everything found in this literature as imaginary and summarily dismiss it as unreal has been the practice of both Western and Eastern scholars until very recently. The very idea indeed was ridiculed and people {{went so far as}} to assert that it was physically impossible for man to use flying machines. But today what with balloons, aeroplanes and other flying machines, a great change has come over our ideas on the subjectâ€¦the flying vimana of Rama or Ravana was set down as but a dream of the mythographer till aeroplanes and zeppelins of the present century saw the light of day. The mohanastra or the [...] "arrow of unconsciousness" [...] of old was until very recently a creature of legend till we heard the other day of bombs discharging Poisonous gases. We owe much to the energetic scientists and researchers who plod persistently and carry their <b>torches</b> <b>deep</b> down into the caves and excavations of old and dig out valid testimonials pointing to the misty antiquity of the wonderful creations of humanity.|$|R

In this work, TiC particulates were incorporated by melting single tracks in powder preplaced onto AISI 4340 {{low alloy steel}} surfaces using a Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) torch {{with a range of}} processing conditions. The effects of energy input and powder content on the melt geometry, microstructure and hardness were investigated. The highest energy input (1680 J/mm) under the TIG <b>torch</b> produced <b>deeper</b> (1. 0 mm) and wider melt pools, associated with increased dilution, compared to that processed at the lowest energy (1008 J/mm). The melt microstructure contained partially melted TiC particulates associated with dendritic, cubic and globular type carbides precipitated upon solidification of TiC dissolved in the melt; TiC accumulated more near to the melt-matrix interface and at the track edges. Addition of 0. 4, 0. 5 and 1. 0 mg/mm 2 TiC gave hardness values in the resolidified melt pools between 750 to over 1100 Hv, against a base hardness of 300 Hv; hardness values are higher in tracks processed with a grcater TiC addition and reduced energy input...|$|R
