40|$|A {{total of}} 49 dynamic sled tests were {{performed}} with the Hybrid III 10 YO to examine issues relating to child belt fit. The goals of these tests were to evaluate ATD response to realistic belt geometries and belt fit, develop methods for accurate, repeatable evaluation of restraint conditions for older children, identify dependent measures that differentiate between good and poor restraint performance, and relate ATD performance to static belt fit with children. The first series of tests {{examined the effects of}} lap belt <b>tension,</b> <b>belt</b> configuration, and seating procedure on dynamic responses of the ATD. The second series of tests examined how different designs of booster seat lap belt guides and shoulder belt guides affect performance. In addition, the ATD’s response to different shoulder belt and lap belt geometries was evaluated. With regard to test procedures, use of a lap/shoulder belt with a sliding latchplate produced similar results to using a lap/shoulder belt with fixed anchorages. Use of a production retractor reduced shoulder belt load, as well as head, neck, and chest measures. Reducing lap belt tension to a more realistic 2 lb (rather than 15 lb) did not have a pronounced effect on ATD kinematics with two different booster seats. The UMTRI seating procedure, which produces ATD postures closer to those measured in real children, also prevents the lap belt from being trapped in the gap between the pelvis and the thigh. Use of the UMTRI seating procedure produces more reclined initial postures and more pronounced chin-to-chest contact. A well-designed booster lap belt guide can maintain good belt position dynamically, even with poor lap belt geometry. Shoulder belt guide designs affect ATD kinematics. However, preventing the shoulder belt from coming out of the shoulder belt guide does not necessarily produce better restraint performance, because the belt can still come off of the ATD shoulder during the event, and stiffening booster seats does not necessarily produce better routing of the shoulder belt dynamically. Shoulder belt scores less than 70 mm produce good torso kinematics with the 10 YO ATD, but use of HIC as an injury criterion tends to discourage booster seat designs that produce good belt fit on the 10 YO ATD. Lap belt angle affects torso kinematics, with shallower lap belt angles leading to submarining and more vertical lap belt angles leading to rollout. Wider spacing of lap belt anchorages leads to submarining, while narrowing spacing leads to rollout. Both upper and lower belt anchorage locations have a strong effect on ATD kinematics. Although good booster designs can mitigate the consequences of poor vehicle lap belt geometry, boosters cannot always overcome poor shoulder belt geometry to keep the belt on the ATD shoulder dynamically, even when they are able to create good static belt fit. This finding suggests that more attention should be focused on the effects of the wide variability in vehicle upper anchorage locations on belt restraint performance for children. Also, because HIC scores are decreased when the torso belt fit is degraded, use of HIC as an injury criterion for booster testing may lead to worse rather than better booster designs...|$|E

5000|$|Active {{seat-belt}} buckle with Pre-Safe {{function for}} rear occupants: the active seat-belt buckle is fully integrated in the vehicle's PRE-SAFE® system. Whenever PRE-SAFE® becomes active in critical driving situations {{or when the}} system detects the vehicle approaching other objects at a critical speed, reversible <b>belt</b> <b>tensioning</b> is also performed in the rear via the active seat-belt buckle function. The restraint system and the passengers are thus better prepared for a possible accident system. In contrast to its extended position to facilitate fastening of the seat belt, the belt buckle is retracted by approx. 40 millimetres instead. This reversible function increases the <b>belt</b> <b>tensioning</b> on the occupant by up to 80 millimetres. In addition, the belt buckle branches off at a lower point at the occupant's hip. This {{reduces the risk of}} the pelvis submarining under the belt. Securing the occupants more effectively in this way can reduce the strain to which they are exposed {{in the event of an}} accident. The active seat-belt buckle complements the pyrotechnic <b>belt</b> <b>tensioning</b> which has featured as standard in Mercedes-Benz vehicles for many years now, and is triggered in the event of an actual impact.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Monitoring of the {{electrocardiogram}} (ECG) in premature {{infants with}} conventional adhesive-backed electrodes can harm their sensitive skin. Use of an electrode belt prevents skin irritation, {{but the effect}} of belt pressure on respiratory function is unknown. A strain gauge sensor is described which measures applied <b>belt</b> <b>tension.</b> Method The device frame was comprised of an aluminum housing and slide to minimize the device weight. Velcro tabs connected housing and slide to opposite tabs located at the electrode belt ends. The slide was connected to a leaf spring, to which were bonded two piezoresistive transducers in a half-bridge circuit configuration. The device was tested for linearity and calibrated. The effect on infant respiratory function of constant <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> in the normal range (30 g– 90 g) was determined. Results The mechanical response to a step input was second order (f n = 401 Hz, ζ = 0. 08). The relationship between applied tension and output voltage was linear in the range 25 – 225 gm of applied tension (r 2 = 0. 99). Measured device sensitivity was 2. 18 mV/gm tension using a 5 V bridge excitation voltage. When <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> was increased in the normal range from 30 gm to 90 gm, {{there was no significant}} change in heart rate and most respiratory functions during monitoring. At an intermediate level of tension of 50 gm, pulmonary resistance and work of breathing significantly decreased. Conclusion The mechanical and electrical design of a device for monitoring electrocardiogram electrode <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> is described. Within the typical range of application tension, cardiovascular and respiratory function are not substantially negatively affected by electrode belt force. </p...|$|R
50|$|A {{belt drive}} for a bicycle was {{patented}} in the United States on April 8, 1890 by Charles D. Rice, Patent # 425,390. No {{evidence has been}} found that it was ever used, but some motorcycles used leather belts in the early 1900s. The Bridgestone Picnica belt-drive bicycle was introduced in the early 1980s. It used a tooth-belt drive like auto timing belts and Harley-Davidson drive belts, along with a novel two-part chainring that increased <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> with increasing load. The Picnica was a folding bicycle, and part of the appeal of the belt drive was cleanliness. The Picnica was a small-wheel bicycle, so <b>belt</b> <b>tension</b> may have been less than on a bicycle with standard-size wheels. It was apparently successful, but was offered mainly in Japan.|$|R
