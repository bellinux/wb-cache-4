25|$|As {{a result}} of Beethoven's hearing loss, his {{conversation}} books are an unusually rich written resource. Used primarily {{in the last ten}} or so years of his life, his friends wrote in these books so that he could know what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying,</b> and he then responded either orally or in the book. The books contain discussions about music and other matters, and give insights into Beethoven's thinking; they are a source for investigations into how he intended his music should be performed, and also his perception of his relationship to art. Out of a total of 400 conversation books, {{it has been suggested that}} 264 were destroyed (and others were altered) after Beethoven's death by his secretary Anton Schindler, who wished only an idealised biography of the composer to survive. However, Theodore Albrecht contests the verity of Schindler's destruction of a large number of conversation books.|$|E

500|$|The {{story was}} {{originally}} {{to have the}} player {{play the role of}} a nephew who had inherited a fortune from his aunt, to be spent only on the world's largest and most profitable theme park. The graphics were drawn and modelled using 3D Studio. Molyneux stated that each person takes about 200 bytes of memory, enough for them to have their own personality. The team travelled the world visiting theme parks and taking [...] notes, and sound effects were sampled from real parks. Molyneux explained that they were going for as much realism as possible. There was to be a feature where a microphone is placed on a visitor and so the player could hear what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying,</b> and multiplayer support was dropped two weeks prior to release because of a deadline. Multiplayer mode would have let players send thugs to other parks.|$|E
500|$|The Vidiians' {{debut in}} [...] "Phage" [...] {{received}} primarily positive responses from Voyagers cast and crew. Kate Mulgrew praised {{the moment in}} which Janeway {{had to choose between}} [...] "sacrificing Neelix's lungs or allowing another species to continue to survive". She viewed Janeway's initial difficulty with approaching the Vidiians about the subject of ethics as showcasing a level of [...] "poignancy". While discussing the alien species introduced in the early seasons of Voyager, Westmore said that he found the Vidiians to have the most compelling design. He described them as [...] "the most interesting ones that we've run into as far as a new concept and look, and something totally different", highlighting their use of horror conventions. Taylor praised Westmore's work representing the Vidiians as [...] "truly grisly-looking people" [...] without turning them into flat or static characters. Skye Dent had a more critical opinion of the episode, saying that alterations made to her first draft of the script weakened the effectiveness of the alien species as antagonists. She felt that they [...] "just seemed very wimpy to me, even though <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> the same dialogue I had written".|$|E

500|$|In the World Rally Championship, Mouton {{made her}} driver debut in 1974, {{finishing}} 12th in the Tour de Corse in an Alpine A110. It was rumoured her good performances {{were the result}} of a special engine, however her car passed inspection by WRC scrutineers. At the end of the year, Mouton was crowned both French and European ladies' champion. Re-entering the Tour de Corse the following season, she took seventh place. Mouton successfully defended her ladies' titles, and also competed in circuit racing: In an all-female team with Christine Dacremont and Marianne Hoepfner, she won the two-litre prototype category of the 1975 24 Hours of Le Mans. Recalling the race in 2008, Mouton said: [...] "It started to rain I remember, and I started to pass everybody. I was running on slicks. In the pits <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> 'Michele you must stop', but I did not want to because I was passing everyone." [...] Her results attracted a major sponsor {{in the form of the}} French oil company Elf. In 1976, Mouton drove the A110 to 11th place in Monte Carlo and retired at the Rallye Sanremo. At the Tour de Corse, her debut in the newer A310 also ended in retirement.|$|E

Channel 4 was found to have breached the Ofcom code of conduct. Statutory sanctions were imposed on Channel 4, obliging them to broadcast statements of Ofcom's findings on three separate occasions {{at the start of the}} new series of Big Brother in May. It was also reported that footage of an alleged racist limerick about Shilpa, devised by her antagonisers, did exist, despite previous denials by Endemol.

2500|$|In {{the second}} year of famine, Joseph's half {{brothers}} were sent to Egypt to buy goods. When they came to Egypt, they stood before the Vizier but did not recognize him as their brother Joseph, who was now in his late 30s; but Joseph did recognize them and did not speak at all to them in his native tongue of Hebrew. After questioning them, he accused them of being spies. After they mentioned a younger brother at home, the Vizier (Joseph) demanded that he be brought to Egypt as a demonstration of their veracity. This was Joseph's full brother, Benjamin. Joseph placed his brothers in prison for three days. On the third day, he brought them out of prison to reiterate that he wanted their youngest brother brought to Egypt to demonstrate their veracity. The brothers conferred amongst themselves speaking in Hebrew, reflecting on the wrong they had done to Joseph. Joseph understood what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> and removed himself from their presence because he was caught in emotion. When he returned, the Vizier took Simeon and bound him as a hostage. Then he had their donkeys prepared with grain and sent the other brothers back to Canaan. Unbeknownst to them, Joseph had also returned their money to their money sacks. (...) ...|$|E

2500|$|Commentators {{have noted}} how Dir en Grey have gained a {{significant}} international fanbase with vocals in Japanese. Kaoru said [...] "when I was growing up, I listened to American bands. They were all singing in English and I {{had no idea}} what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying.</b> But I still remember the excitement that I experienced. I know as a listener that our fans can connect to our music in the same way — even with the language barrier." [...] When asked why they almost always use Japanese instead of English, which would give them more broad international appeal, he said that [...] "We consider our music [...] a piece of art. [...] The language is part of that artwork." [...] The guitarist explained that Kyo, who writes all of the lyrics, prefers [...] "the sensitivities that Japanese language offers. There are expressions and nuances that can only be conveyed in Japanese; he values that." [...] However, he noted that likewise there are some expressions that are only able to be shown in English, and they will use it if they feel the need. The lyrics deal with subjects such as society and mass media, as well as sexual obsessions and love, usually with negative implications. The vocabulary varies from subtle to explicit (though the use of profanity has greatly decreased as the band matured, last featuring on Uroboros), and several songs rely heavily on double entendres and other wordplay, often involving the multiple meanings of a kanji character.|$|E
2500|$|In 1975, Privitera {{was convicted}} of {{conspiracy}} to possess and distribute laetrile for telling patients where to obtain it -apricot seeds-(yes, the fruit.) The case led to a Supreme Court of California decision in 1979. Citing Roe v. Wade, Privitera's lawyers contended {{that the right to}} obtain laetrile is a fundamental right of privacy. The California Court of Appeal overturned the conviction citing a compelling interest, and the state appealed. The Supreme Court of California ruled 5 to 2 that the right to obtain drugs of unproven efficacy is not encompassed by the right of privacy embodied in either the State or Federal Constitutions. The majority wrote that [...] "the lesson of Roe v. Wade for our case is that a requirement that a drug be certified effective for its intended use is a reasonable means to 'insure maximum safety for the patient.'" [...] (So basically <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> fruit should be illegal, yes the seeds from apricots.) The outcome was vitamin B-17 [...] "Amygdalin" [...] and apricot seeds were made legal to possess and sell and are widely available and consumed and purchased today. The term used [...] "laetrile" [...] is actually incorrect because that's referring to the injectable pharmaceutical form of Amygdalin, not the extract from the apricot seed. Privitera was soon pardoned by California governor Jerry Brown after the governor received more than 10,000 letters from citizens asking him to Pardon him.|$|E
