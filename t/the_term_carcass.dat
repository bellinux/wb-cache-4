5000|$|The {{concept and}} {{symptoms}} of death, and varying degrees of delicacy used in discussion in public forums, have generated numerous scientific, legal, and socially acceptable terms or euphemisms for death. When a person has died, it is also said they have passed away, passed on, expired, or are gone, among numerous other socially accepted, religiously specific, slang, and irreverent terms. Bereft of life, the dead person is then a corpse, cadaver, a body, a set of remains, and when all flesh has rotted away, a skeleton. <b>The</b> <b>terms</b> carrion and <b>carcass</b> can also be used, though these more often connote the remains of non-human animals. As a polite reference to a dead person, it has become common practice to use the participle form of [...] "decease", as in the deceased; another noun form is decedent. The ashes left after a cremation are sometimes referred to by the neologism cremains, a portmanteau of [...] "cremation" [...] and [...] "remains".|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{empirical evidence}} on the information in <b>the</b> <b>term</b> structure for longer maturities about both future inflation and <b>the</b> <b>term</b> structure of real interest rates. The evidence indicates that there is substantial information in <b>the</b> longer maturity <b>term</b> structure about future inflation: the slope of <b>the</b> <b>term</b> structure does {{have a great deal}} of predictive power for future changes in inflation. On the other hand, at the longer maturities, <b>the</b> <b>term</b> structure of nominal interest rates contains very little information about <b>the</b> <b>term</b> structure of real interest rates. These results are strikingly different from those found for very short-term maturities, six months or less, in previous work. For maturities of six months or less, <b>the</b> <b>term</b> structure contains no information about the future path of inflation, but it does contain a great deal of information about <b>the</b> <b>term</b> structure of real interest rates. The evidence in this paper does indicate that, at longer maturities, <b>the</b> <b>term</b> structure of interest rates can be used to help assess future inflationary pressures: when the slope of <b>the</b> <b>term</b> structure steepens, it is an indication that the inflation rate will rise in the future and when the slope falls, it is an indication that the inflation rate will fall. However, we must still remain cautious about using the evidence presented here to advocate that the Federal Reserve should target on <b>the</b> <b>term</b> structure in conducting monetary policy. A change in Federal Reserve operating procedures which focuses on <b>the</b> <b>term</b> structure may well cause the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>term</b> structure and future inflation to shift, with the result that <b>the</b> <b>term</b> structure no longer remains an accurate guide to the path of future inflation. If this were to occur, Federal Reserve monetary policy could go far astray by focusing on <b>the</b> <b>term</b> structure of interest rates. ...|$|R
