40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} solve the poor {{adaptability}} problem with the traditional reentry guidance, A new evolved Acceleration Guidance Logic for Entry (EAGLE) is studied for the Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) here. According to <b>the</b> guidance, <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> drag acceleration <b>profile</b> is updated every period based on the predictive range-to-go. In the lateral profile, basing on <b>the</b> generated <b>reference</b> drag <b>profile,</b> two reversal times are got successively through numerical predictive method. The technique of feedback linearization is used to track <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> drag acceleration <b>profile.</b> <b>The</b> algorithms of updating <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> drag <b>profile</b> and searching reversal times are both the method of golden-section search, so the EAGLE method can be performed onboard.

40|$|The {{cellular}} {{composition of}} heterogeneous samples can be predicted using an expression deconvolution algorithm to decompose their gene expression profiles based on pre-defined, <b>reference</b> gene expression <b>profiles</b> of the constituent populations in these samples. However, the expression {{profiles of the}} actual constituent populations are often perturbed from those of <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> <b>profiles</b> due to gene expression changes in cells associated with microenvironmental or developmental effects. Existing deconvolution algorithms do not account for these changes and give incorrect results when benchmarked against those measured by well-established flow cytometry, even after batch correction was applied. We introduce PERT, a new probabilistic expression deconvolution method that detects and accounts for a shared, multiplicative perturbation in <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> <b>profiles</b> when performing expression deconvolution. We applied PERT and three other state-of-the-art expression deconvolution methods to predict cell frequencies within heterogeneous human blood samples that were collected under several conditions (uncultured mono-nucleated and lineage-depleted cells, and culture-derived lineage-depleted cells). Only PERT’s predicted proportions of the constituent populations matched those assigned by flow cytometry.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} one of {{the entry}} guidance concepts that is currently being tested as part of Marshall Space Flight Center's Advance Guidance and Control Project. The algorithm is of <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> <b>profile</b> tracking type. <b>The</b> <b>reference</b> <b>profile</b> consists of the reference states, range-to-go, altitude, and flight path angle, and reference controls, bank angle and angle of attack, versus energy. A linear control law using state feedback is used with energy-scheduled gains. The gains are obtained offline using Matlab's steady state linear quadratic regulator function. Lateral trajectory control is effected by performing periodic bank sign reversals based on a heading error corridor. A description and results of the AG&C test cases on which it has been tested are given. Although it is not anticipated that the algorithm will be quite as robust as algorithms with onboard trajectory re-generation capability, the results nevertheless show it to be very robust with respect to varying initial conditions and works satisfactorily even for entries from widely different orbits than that of <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> <b>profile.</b> Moreover, the commanded bank and angle of attack histories are very smooth, {{making it easier for}} the attitude control system to implement the guidance commands. Finally, results indicate that the guidance gains are more or less trajectory-independent which is a potentially useful property...|$|E

40|$|Background. We {{wanted to}} {{quantify}} the impact that polyparasite infections, including multiple concurrent low-intensity infections, have on anemia. Methods. Three stool samples were collected and read in duplicate by the Kato-Katz method in a cross-sectional sample of 507 children from Leyte, The Philippines. The number of eggs per gram of stool was used to define 3 infection intensity categories—uninfected, low, and moderate/high (M+) —for 3 geohelminth species and Schis-tosomiasis japonicum. Four polyparasite infection profiles were defined {{in addition to a}} reference profile that con-sisted of either no infections or low-intensity infection with only 1 parasite. Logistic regression models were used {{to quantify the}} effect that polyparasitism has on anemia (hemoglobin level! 11 g/dL). Results.

When the attenuation map was shifted, {{it is clear}} that the main changes in quantitation were located at the edges of the phantom along the shifting direction. The changes were small for 201 Tl, 99 mTc and 111 In imaging (≤ 5 %), while for 125 I it was larger (≤ 10 %).

40|$|The {{formation}} of sombric horizons (dark horizons in the subsoil) {{is still not}} understood. In order to improve {{our understanding of the}} {{formation of}} sombric horizons we studied these soils in southern Brazil from various perspectives. The lateral configuration and grain size distribution excluded the possibility that the sombric horizon is a paleosol covered by an eolian deposit or colluvium. Micromorphology showed intense biological activity, indicating strong bioturbation. The absence of clay and OM coatings indicates that the sombric horizon in the study area was not formed by illuviation. Considering changes with depth, phytoliths and δ 13 C isotopes clearly showed that the OM from the sombric horizon had a larger contribution from grasses, while a larger contribution from black carbon (BC) was evidenced by the molecular composition. A larger contribution from grasses and BC both correspond to drier climatic conditions. However, similar depth trends for δ 13 C and PAHs were found in <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> <b>profile</b> (without sombric horizon), in agreement with climatic change but not explaining the different morphology. The molecular composition and C/N ratio showed that the profiles differed in degree of decomposition, with the OM in the soils that contained a sombric horizon being more decomposed than that in <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> <b>profile.</b> The sombric horizon is thus a remnant of an earlier phase of soil formation under a drier climate, which is made visible by differences in decomposition of OM related to subsequent more humid conditions. Stronger decomposition in the profiles with a sombric horizon may be related to better drainage, explaining their occurrence in the highest positions within the landscape and suggesting a topographic control...|$|E

40|$|The program CRYSIZ is {{designed}} to take the powder diffraction line profiles for a well-crystallized sample, called a reference pattern, and for {{a sample of the}} same substance, called a broadened pattern, to produce measures of the mean crystallite size, the distribution of crystallite sizes, and the root mean square residual microstrain in the broadened sample. The data required are the two powder patterns and a series of directives to signal the calculations and plots to be done during the execution of the program. The program loads files containing the background corrected powder diffraction intensity data for both the reference and broadened patterns. Preliminary calculations find the centroids, full width at half maximums, integral breadths, spans over sum, and second moments. Two methods of deconvoluting the profile to calculate size and strain are allowed. Either the direct or the Stokes Fourier coefficient method of deconvolution may be chosen. In the direct method the profiles are extracted by numerical fitting. This method is slower but produces unfolded profiles free of ringing and the ``hook effect``. In this case the Fourier coefficients required for Warren-Averbach analysis are produced from the deconvoluted profile. In the Stokes method the diffraction pattern of each reference and broadened profile is Fourier transformed to produce a set of Fourier coefficients. The Fourier coefficients of the broadened profiles are divided by those of the reference pattern. The resulting coefficients are the Stokes coefficients. The Stokes coefficients are smoothed by a least- squares procedure in order to remove noise and quell ringing and hooking, then used as input to a reverse Fourier transform. This transform produces an ``unfolded powder line,`` which is a best estimate of the broadened profile with <b>the</b> <b>reference</b> <b>profile</b> and noise removed.
