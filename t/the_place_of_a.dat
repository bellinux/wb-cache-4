5|$|Atomic {{exchange}} involves {{exchange between}} an adatom and an adjacent atom within the surface lattice. As {{shown in figure}} 4, after an atomic exchange event the adatom has taken <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> surface atom and the surface atom has been displaced and has now become an adatom. This process may take place in both heterodiffusion (e.g. Pt adatoms on Ni) and self-diffusion (e.g. Pt adatoms on Pt). It is still unclear from a theoretical point of view why the atomic exchange mechanism is more predominant in some systems than in others. Current theory points towards multiple possibilities, including tensile surface stresses, surface relaxation about the adatom, and increased stability of the intermediate {{due to the fact}} that both atoms involved maintain high levels of coordination throughout the process.|$|E
5|$|Beurre Maître d'Hôtel {{is usually}} served cold as sliced disks atop various foods, and {{sometimes}} {{as a side}} condiment. It is used on grilled meats such as steak and fish, and also on eggs, vegetables, potatoes and breads. Some variations exist, including a few sweet versions that include sugar, which may be used on dishes such as pancakes. When used as a topping, it is typically added just before the dish is served. It has also been served melted atop dishes, whereby it is placed atop foods {{during the last few}} minutes of cooking. It may be used in <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sauce, and a small amount can significantly add to a dish's overall flavor.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} extreme {{examples}} of colonial behavior in rodents are the eusocial naked mole rat and Damaraland mole rat. The naked mole rat lives completely underground and can form colonies of up to 80 individuals. Only one female and up to three males in the colony reproduce, {{while the rest of}} the members are smaller and sterile, and function as workers. Some individuals are of intermediate size. They help with the rearing of the young and can take <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reproductive if one dies. The Damaraland mole rat is characterized by having a single reproductively active male and female in a colony where the remaining animals are not truly sterile, but become fertile only if they establish a colony of their own.|$|E

5|$|Scaramanga then {{proposes a}} pistol duel with Bond on the beach; {{the two men}} stand back to back and are officiated by Nick Nack to take twenty paces, but when Bond turns and fires, Scaramanga has vanished. Nick Nack leads Bond into Scaramanga's Funhouse where Bond stands in <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{mannequin}} of himself; when Scaramanga walks by, Bond outwits and kills him. Goodnight kills Scaramanga's security chief Kra, sending his body {{into one of the}} temperature control vats. His body heat raises the helium of the solar plant, which begins to spiral out of control. Bond retrieves the Solex unit just before the island is destroyed, and they escape unharmed in Scaramanga's Chinese junk. Bond then fends off a final attack by Nick Nack, who smuggled himself aboard, placing Nick Nack in a wicker basket on the mainmast of the ship. Bond and Goodnight celebrate their mission by romancing each other.|$|E
5|$|The Book of est is {{a fictional}} {{account of the}} {{training}} created by Werner Erhard, (est), or Erhard Seminars Training, first published in 1976 by Holt, Rinehart and Winston. The book was written by est graduate Luke Rhinehart. Rhinehart is the pen name of writer George Cockcroft. The book was endorsed by Erhard, and includes a foreword by him. Its contents attempts to replicate {{the experience of the}} est training, with the reader being put in <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> participant in the course.

25|$|Two of {{the five}} living species of monotreme occur in Australia: the platypus and the short-beaked echidna. The {{monotremes}} differ from other mammals in their methods of reproduction; in particular, they lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young. The platypusa venomous, egg-laying, duck-billed amphibious mammalis considered {{to be one of}} the strangest creatures in the animal kingdom. When it was first presented by Joseph Banks to English naturalists it was thought to be so strange that it was a cleverly created hoax. The short-beaked echidna is similarly strange, covered in hairy spikes with a tubular snout in <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mouth, and a tongue that can move in and out of the snout about 100 times a minute to capture termites.|$|E
25|$|An {{adjustable}} wood bit, {{also known}} as an expansive wood bit, has a small center pilot bit with an adjustable, sliding cutting edge mounted above it, usually containing a single sharp point at the outside, with a set screw to lock the cutter in position. When the cutting edge is centered on the bit, the hole drilled will be small, and when the cutting edge is slid outwards, a larger hole is drilled. This allows a single drill bit to drill {{a wide variety of}} holes, and can take <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large, heavy set of different size bits, as well as providing uncommon bit sizes. A ruler or vernier scale is usually provided to allow precise adjustment of the bit size.|$|E

25|$|Northrop's Chief Test Pilot Vance Breese {{flew the}} N-1M on its maiden flight, {{unexpectedly}} bouncing {{into the air}} during a planned high-speed taxi run. He reported that the aircraft could fly no higher than five feet off the ground. Flight could only be sustained by maintaining a precise angle of attack, but Theodore von Kármán solved the problem by making adjustments to the trailing edges of the elevons. Control of the aircraft was achieved {{through the use of}} a system of elevons and wingtip rudders. The elevons served in tailless type aircraft both as elevators and ailerons, while split flaps on the downward angled wingtips took <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> conventional rudder; they were later straightened after that angle proved unnecessary during flight testing.|$|E
25|$|Research using {{mathematical}} modelling is indeed demonstrating that predation can indeed stabilize lumps of very similar species. Willow warbler and chiffchaff and other very similar warblers {{can serve as}} an example. The idea {{is that it is}} also a good strategy to be very similar to a successful species or have enough dissimilarity. Also trees in the rain forest can serve as an example of all high canopy species basically following the same strategy. Other examples of nearly identical species clusters occupying the same niche were water beetles, prairie birds and algae.The basic idea is that there can be clusters of very similar species all applying the same successful strategy and between them open spaces. Here the species cluster takes <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single species in the classical ecological models.|$|E
25|$|In 1723, the Immaculata statue {{was erected}} in <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> former gallows at Hlavná ulica (Main Street) commemorating the plague from the years 1710–1711. This {{was one of}} the centers of the Hungarian {{language}} regenerate movement which published the first Hungarian language periodical called the Magyar Museum in Hungary in 1788. The city's walls were demolished step by step from the early 19th century to 1856; only the Executioner's Bastion remained with few parts of the wall. The city became the seat of its own bishopric in 1802. The city's surroundings became a theater of war again during the Revolutions of 1848, when the Imperial cavalry general Franz Schlik defeated the Hungarian army on 8 December 1848 and 4 January 1849. The city was captured by the Hungarian army on 15 February 1849, but the Russian troops drove them back on 24 June 1849.|$|E
