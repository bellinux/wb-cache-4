5|$|Discerning {{dynamical}} families {{within the}} Jupiter trojan population {{is more difficult}} <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> in the asteroid belt, because the Jupiter trojans are locked within a far narrower range of possible positions. This means that clusters tend to overlap and merge with the overall swarm. By 2003 roughly a dozen dynamical families were identified. Jupiter-trojan families are much smaller in size than families in the asteroid belt; the largest identified family, the Menelaus group, consists of only eight members.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, it was {{suggested}} that the brolga, sarus crane (Antigone antigone) and white-naped crane (Antigone vipio) formed a natural group on the basis of similarities in their calls. This was further confirmed by molecular studies of their DNA. These also showed that the brolga is more closely related to the white-naped crane <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to the morphologically more similar sarus crane.|$|E
5|$|In Predynastic and Early Dynastic times, the Egyptian climate {{was much}} less arid <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> today. Large regions of Egypt were covered in treed savanna and traversed by herds of grazing ungulates. Foliage and fauna were far more {{prolific}} in all environs and the Nile region supported large populations of waterfowl. Hunting would have been common for Egyptians, and {{this is also the}} period when many animals were first domesticated.|$|E
5|$|Mecoptera {{have special}} {{importance}} {{in the evolution of}} the insects. Two of the most important insect orders, Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) and Diptera (true flies), along with Trichoptera (caddisflies), probably evolved from ancestors belonging to, or strictly related to, the Mecoptera. Evidence includes anatomical and biochemical similarities as well as transitional fossils, such as Permotanyderus and Choristotanyderus, which lie between the Mecoptera and Diptera. The group was once much more widespread and diverse <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> now, with four suborders during the Mesozoic.|$|E

5|$|Stuffed {{chicken in}} Israel is usually stuffed with rice, meat (lamb or beef), parsley, dried fruits like dates, {{apricots}} or raisins, spices like cinnamon, nutmeg or allspice; sometimes herbs like thyme and oregano (not the dried ones) are added {{on the top}} of the chicken to give it a flavor and <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> baked in the oven.|$|E
5|$|The {{heads of}} the workers and queens are as long as broad with convexed sides. The mandibles are long with {{thirteen}} known teeth. The first and third segments of the funiculus are equally long. The thorax is longer than broad by two to three-fourths its width, and the mesonotum is longer <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> broad in workers; the mesonotum is broader <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> long in queens. The node (a segment between the mesosoma and gaster) is {{as long as it}} is broad, and the postpetiole is one-sixth broader than long. The first segment of the gaster is broader than its length. M.regularis shares a similar appearance to M.forficata, but there are several morphological differences that separate the two. Owing to the rugose sculpture of the head and thorax, M.regularis is noticeably smaller than M.forficata. The mandibles of M.regularis are much narrower, the posterior corners of the head are more round and the petiolar peduncle is longer. The mandibles appear to be deep red, and some areas, such as the gastric segments, are golden brown.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} Foucault replaces the {{cogwheel}} by a rotating mirror. Because the mirror keeps rotating while the light {{travels to the}} distant mirror and back, the light is reflected from the rotating mirror at a different angle on its way out <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> on its way back. From this difference in angle, the known speed of rotation and {{the distance to the}} distant mirror the speed of light may be calculated.|$|E

5|$|The p-adic {{numbers are}} an {{alternative}} number system {{of interest in}} number theory. Like the real numbers, the p-adic numbers can be built from the rational numbers via Cauchy sequences; the construction uses a different metric in which 0 is closer to p, and much closer to pn, <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to 1. The p-adic numbers form a field for prime p and a ring for other p, including 10. So arithmetic can be performed in the p-adics, {{and there are no}} infinitesimals.|$|E
5|$|The planets were {{originally}} {{thought to have}} formed in or near their current orbits. However, this view underwent radical change during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Currently, {{it is thought that}} the Solar System looked very different after its initial formation: several objects at least as massive as Mercury were present in the inner Solar System, the outer Solar System was much more compact <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> now, and the Kuiper belt was much closer to the Sun.|$|E

Access to Utila may have involved over-water dispersal during hurricanes, as is known for Iguana iguana in the Lesser Antilles or a land bridge to the mainland lost during the close of the last ice age.|$|E

5|$|Though clearly {{related to}} the giant whales of the genus Balaenoptera, the {{humpback}} is the sole member of its genus.

5|$|At {{times during}} the last interglacial period (130,000–70,000 BCE) Europe had a climate warmer <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> today, and early humans may have {{made their way to}} Scotland, though archaeologists have found no traces of this. Glaciers then scoured their way across most of Britain, and only after the ice retreated did Scotland again become habitable, around 9600 BCE. Mesolithic {{hunter-gatherer}} encampments formed the first known settlements, and archaeologists have dated an encampment near Biggar to around 8500 BCE. Numerous other sites found around Scotland build up a picture of highly mobile boat-using people making tools from bone, stone and antlers. The oldest house for which there is evidence in Britain is the oval structure of wooden posts found at South Queensferry near the Firth of Forth, dating from the Mesolithic period, about 8240 BCE.|$|E
5|$|Buffer {{solutions}} {{also play}} a key role in analytical chemistry. They are used whenever there is a need to fix the pH of a solution at a particular value. Compared with an aqueous solution, the pH of a buffer solution is relatively insensitive to the addition of a small amount of strong acid or strong base. The buffer capacity of a simple buffer solution is largest when pH=pKa. In acid–base extraction, the efficiency of extraction of a compound into an organic phase, such as an ether, can be optimised by adjusting the pH of the aqueous phase using an appropriate buffer. At the optimum pH, the concentration of the electrically neutral species is maximised; such a species is more soluble in organic solvents having a low dielectric constant <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> in water. This technique is used for the purification of weak acids and bases.|$|E
5|$|Common {{starlings}} {{are both}} monogamous and polygamous; although broods are generally {{brought up by}} one male and one female, occasionally the pair may have an extra helper. Pairs {{may be part of}} a colony, in which case several other nests may occupy the same or nearby trees. Males may mate with a second female while the first is still on the nest. The reproductive success of the bird is poorer in the second nest <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> in the primary nest and is better when the male remains monogamous.|$|E
