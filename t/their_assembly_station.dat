40|$|The {{economical}} {{production of}} mass customised and high variety goods {{is a challenge}} facing modern manufacturers. This challenge is being addressed, in part, by the on-going development of technologies that facilitate the manufacturing of these goods. Existing technologies require either excessive inbuilt flexibility or frequent changes to the machine set up to provide the manufacturing functions required for the customisation process. This paper presents design principles for automated <b>assembly</b> <b>stations</b> {{within the scope of}} mass customisation. Design principles are presented that minimise the hardware and operating complexities of <b>assembly</b> <b>stations,</b> allowing stations to be easily automated for concurrent mixed model assembly with a First In First Out (FIFO) scheduling policy. A reconfigurable <b>assembly</b> <b>station</b> is developed to demonstrate how the proposed design methods simplify the creation and operation of an <b>assembly</b> <b>station</b> for a product family of flashlights...|$|R

To successfully achieve this transition, a fully-functional fuel cell automatic stack <b>assembly</b> robotic <b>station</b> is being developed. This document outlines both iterations of the robotic fuel cell <b>assembly</b> <b>stations,</b> other work to date, DFM and DFA lessons learned, and the anticipated future progression of automatic fuel cell stack <b>assembly</b> <b>stations.</b> Two individual robotic fuel cell <b>assembly</b> <b>stations</b> were constructed, including custom-built end effectors and parts feeders. The second station incorporated numerous improvements, including overlapping work envelopes, elimination of a shuttle cart, software synchronization, fewer axes, and a better end effector. Consequentially, the second workcell achieved a four-fold improvement in cycle time over the previous iteration. Future improvements will focus in part upon improving the reliability of the overall system. As the stack assembly workcell continues to improve, research will focus upon the ramifications and interplay of tolerances, stack failure modes, sealing, reliability, and the potential for component redesign specifically to optimize fuel cell manufacturing throughput...|$|R

40|$|Aim of the {{assembly}} line balancing problem (ALBP) is the efficient and effective assignment of <b>assembly</b> tasks to <b>stations</b> in one-piece-flow production systems. Although this problem has been studied for decades, few contributions consider the component picking at <b>assembly</b> <b>station</b> level. Yet, this activity has relevant and practical implications for ALBPs in the industrial context. This paper proposes an innovative multi-objective optimization model for the ALBP to assign the <b>assembly</b> tasks to <b>stations</b> by distinguishing {{the assembly}} activities involved in task execution and component picking. Thus, a function is proposed to relate the time required for component picking with the component storage location at <b>assembly</b> <b>station</b> level and the component features, namely dimensions, weight and handiness. The aim of the developed model for the ALBP is the simultaneous minimization {{of the assembly}} line takt time and ergonomic risk, both determined by the task execution and component picking activities. Furthermore, the proposed model not only defines the optimal task assignment to stations, but it also determines the optimal storage location of each component between the locations available at the different <b>assembly</b> <b>stations.</b> The multi-objective optimization model is validated with an industrial case study dealing with a kitchen appliance assembly line. The final assembly line balancing configuration proposed is distinguished by remarkable performance for both takt time and ergonomic risk objective functions. Such a balancing leads to 36 % ergonomic risk reduction with just 2 % takt time increase compared to the correspondent single-objective configurations. These outstanding results are determined by a proper component disposition in the different station storage locations defined by the model...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a {{branch and bound}} algorithm which can solve assembly line balancing probems with nine modifications to the originally formulated problem of minimizing the required number of <b>assembly</b> <b>stations,</b> given a cycle time, a set of tasks with given deterministic performance times, and between-task precedence relationships. The first two formulation modifications are those of permitting planned imbalance in the total of task performance times at each <b>assembly</b> <b>station,</b> and allowing specific tasks to be assigned to specific types of <b>assembly</b> <b>stations.</b> Seven further problem modifications can be solved by the proposed algorithm, or by any algorithm or heuristic that can solve problems containing these first two modifications. They are: treatment of stochastic task performance times on unpaced lines; requirement of particular tasks to be assigned to particular stations; requirement of task groupings according to task skill levels; requirement of particular tasks to be assigned to only a left-of-line or right-of line station; required task separations; some mixed model situations; and where paralleling of a specified task into two (or more stations) is permitted. The algorithm is presented in both conceptual and detailed form.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine and {{evaluate}} an <b>assembly</b> <b>station</b> at Kalmar Industries in respect to ergonomics. The study was to result in an improved <b>assembly</b> <b>station</b> with lower risk of work- related injuries. It was the study group’s expectation that the measures taken at the <b>assembly</b> <b>station</b> can function as guidance and an inspiration for other ergonomic improvements at the company. Several goals related to the purpose were established as guidance for the study. The mechanic’s work situation was mapped through a series of methods. With inquiry and interviews the study group got information of the mechanics own thoughts, ideas and understanding about the working situation. Application of participating and non-participating observation, photographing and video filming gave the project members the possibility to document the reality and compare it with gathered information from the mechanics. At the same time, literature and earlier studies was studied to gather current information and ideas. All data was analyzed and parallel to this several solutions could be developed by the study group with the help of innovation techniques and benchmarking. The solutions are composed of recommendations on purchases and new product development for improvements in respect to the ergonomic situation...|$|R
40|$|A Masters Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Master of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Productivity requirements in high volume manufacturing industry necessitate {{the widespread use of}} machine-based <b>assembly</b> <b>stations.</b> Although high production volumes can be achieved by a small number of workers (operators) the resulting fatigue on these operators is often overlooked {{in the design of the}} <b>assembly</b> <b>station.</b> Fatigue mitigation is then required via job rotation on the shop floor but this is both unsatisfactory and a partial solution only. The aims of this thesis are: to develop an approach to the design of operator-centric <b>assembly</b> <b>stations</b> to evaluate this approach in real life case study applications to produce an evaluative tool which embodies "best practice" for use by designers enabling them to aim to avoid or mitigate musculoskeletal disorder problems for operators. The thesis reviews current approaches to the design of ergonomic- and process-driven <b>assembly</b> <b>stations</b> using literature available in the public domain which includes guidelines, regulations, and legislative requirements for health and safety. Also reported is work undertaken by the author, at H R Adcock Ltd, on two <b>assembly</b> <b>stations</b> which have been comprehensively re-designed in response to unacceptable health risks for the workforce, poor quality products and a low production rate. The original design and operation of the two stations will be analysed along with the techniques used for their improvement. The core of this thesis is to demonstrate a 'best practice' design approach to the re-design and to evaluate the outcome. It became clear during the compilation of this thesis that if it were possible to incorporate some simple checking procedures which would identify all potential hazards and evaluate risks early in the design process then this would eliminate or reduce the need for costly downstream design changes. The system developed is RIMAN - an acronym for Risk MANagement procedure. RIMAN incorporates the following: Development of design criteria Co-operation between disciplines to facilitate the development of the design criteria Risk identification Evaluation of identified risks and assessment of how to eliminate or reduce them to an achievable level Utilisation of RIMAN as a recording/auditing tool and as a technical folder which would outline the regulations and standards used in the design criteria and specify the risk levels identified by risk evaluation. RIMAN was successfully evaluated, retrospectively, against the <b>assembly</b> <b>station</b> case study already mentioned. It demonstrated how particular risks were identified and dealt with early in the design process. It is proposed that further work is undertaken on a RIMAN version 2 and that the tool be actively incorporated into the working practices of H. R. Adcock Ltd., or any company, on a live design project...|$|R

40|$|One of the {{significant}} challenges in operating a mix-model assembly system is the feeding of parts to the productive units. In order to avoid production loss, assembly systems require uninterrupted availability of components to feed workstations. On the other hand, the feeding of assembly components has to be performed {{in a way that}} minimises the related costs. In the past, the feeding system most widely used was so-called 'line storage' in which the components were stored along the <b>assembly</b> <b>stations</b> in large quantities and were periodically refilled by the central warehouse. Following just-in-time principles, nowadays, assembly system feeding is undertaken by supermarkets, as in decentralised storage areas close to the assembly lines. From such kinds of warehousing, a growing number of manufacturers are adopting two other feeding strategies: the kanban system, which continuously refills the <b>assembly</b> <b>stations</b> through the pull kanban system, or the kitting system, in which kits of components are prepared and delivered following the product through the <b>assembly</b> <b>stations.</b> This paper aims to quantitatively analyse and compare these two recent feeding strategies, considering the production mix variation and the assembled models variety influence. Moreover, kanban-kitting feeding policy and the related optimization issues are considered as hybrid. The findings from an industrial case study and a simulation analysis are also reported. Finally, a decision-making tool that defines a series of 'convenience areas' for the different feeding policies is provide...|$|R

40|$|The {{fabrication}} of precision laser targets requires {{a wide variety}} of specialized mesoscale manufacturing techniques. The diamond wire saw developed in this study provides the capability to precisely section meso-scale workpieces mounted on the <b>assembly</b> <b>stations</b> used by the Target Fabrication Group. This new capability greatly simplifies the {{fabrication of}} many types of targets and reduces the time and cost required to build the targets. A variety of materials are used to fabricate targets, including metals, plastics with custom designed chemical formulas, and aerogels of various densities. The materials are usually provided in the form of small pieces or cast rods that must be machined to the required shape. Many of these materials, such as metals and some plastics, can be trimmed using a parting tool on a diamond turning machine. However, other materials, such as aerogels and brittle materials, cannot be adequately cut with a parting tool. In addition, the geometry of the parts often requires that the workpieces be held in a special <b>assembly</b> <b>station,</b> which excludes the use of a parting tool. In the past, these materials were sectioned using a small, handheld coping saw that used a diamond-impregnated wire as a blade. This miniature coping saw was effective, but it required several hours to cut through certain materials. Furthermore, the saw was guided by hand and often caused significant damage to fragile aerogels. To solve these problems, the diamond wire saw shown in Figure 1 was developed. The diamond wire saw is designed to machine through materials that are mounted in the Target Fabrication Group's benchtop <b>assembly</b> <b>stations.</b> These <b>assembly</b> <b>stations</b> are the primary means of aligning and assembling target components, and there is often a need to machine materials while they are mounted in the <b>assembly</b> <b>stations.</b> Unfortunately, commercially available saws are designed for very different applications and are far too large to be used with the <b>assembly</b> <b>stations.</b> Therefore, a custom diamond wire saw was designed and constructed. The diamond wire saw cuts through workpieces using a continuous loop of diamond-impregnated wire of length 840 mm. The wire loop runs around several idler pulleys and is driven by a simple geared DC motor that rotates at 17 rpm. The linear speed of the wire is 107 inches/minute. The saw is oriented at an angle of 20 {sup o} from horizontal, so the operator can view the wire through the cutout at {{the front end of the}} saw. When looking through a microscope or camera with a horizontal line of sight, the operator can clearly see the wire as it cuts through the workpiece, as shown in the right side of Figure 1. The saw is mounted on a two-axis stage that allows the operator to align the wire with the workpiece. To cut through the workpiece, the operator drives the wire through the workpiece by turning the feed micrometer. An image of the interior of the diamond wire saw appears in Figure 2. This picture was taken after removing the protective cover plate from the saw...|$|R

40|$|Nowadays {{in mixed}} model {{assembly}} systems the parts feeding {{is more and}} more undertaken by supermarkets.

40|$|This paper proposes the {{application}} of computer simulation methods in order to analyse the availability of resources, buffers {{and the impact of}} the allocation of workers on the throughput and work-in-progress of a manufacturing system. The simulation model of the production system is based on an existing example of a manufacturing company in the automotive industry. The manufacturing system includes both machining and assembly operations. Simulation experiments were conducted vis-à-vis the availability of the different manufacturing resources, the various allocations of buffer capacities and the number of employees. The production system consists of three manufacturing cells – each cell including two CNC machines – and two <b>assembly</b> <b>stations.</b> The parts produced by the manufacturing cells are stored in buffers and transferred to the <b>assembly</b> <b>stations.</b> Workers are allocated to the manufacturing cells and <b>assembly</b> <b>stations,</b> but the number of workers may be less than number of workplaces and are thus termed ‘multi-workstations’. Using computer simulation methods, the impact of the availability of resources, the number of employees and of the allocation of buffer capacity on the throughput and work-in-progress of the manufacturing system is analysed. The results of the research are used to improve the effectiveness of manufacturing systems using a decision support system and the proper control of resources. Literature analysis shows that the study of the impact of buffer capacities, availability of resources and the number of employees on assembly manufacturing system performance have not been carried out so far...|$|R
