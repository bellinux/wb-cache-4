5|$|Murrell used witch bottles {{as part of}} his magical practices, and, {{during the}} 1950s, the folklorist Eric Maple {{encountered}} claims that Murrell was able to summon anyone he wished using them, including individuals who had gone overseas. Murrell experimented {{with the use of a}} witch bottle constructed out of iron; he had two such devices created by a local smith, Stephen Choppen, and had the plug at the mouth soldered up before the bottle was placed in a fire as part of an anti-bewitchment spell. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>behind</b> <b>this</b> was that the bottle itself would not explode under the heat, and that thus it could be reused on other occasions. According to folklore collected by Maple, the smith's attempts, which were initially unsuccessful, succeeded only after Murrell had recited a charm.|$|E
5|$|The new European Norm EN144-3:2003 {{introduced}} {{a new type of}} valve, similar to existing 232 bar or 300 bar DIN valves, however, with a metric M26×2 fitting on both the cylinder and the regulator. These are intended to be used for breathing gas with oxygen content above that normally found in natural air in the Earth's atmosphere (i.e. 22–100%). From August 2008, these were required in the European Union for all diving equipment used with nitrox or pure oxygen. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>behind</b> <b>this</b> new standard is to prevent a rich mixture being filled to a cylinder that is not oxygen clean. However even with use of the new system there still remains nothing except human procedural care to ensure that a cylinder with a new valve remains oxygen-clean - which is exactly how the previous system worked.|$|E

However, if A may hold as well as ¬A, then the argument for the inference is weakened.|$|E

25|$|In 1975, YWAM's founder Loren Cunningham, {{along with}} Bill Bright of Campus Crusade {{spoke of the}} {{importance}} of influencing seven main segments or spheres of society and culture (Family, Celebration, Religion, Government, Education, Science, Media).

25|$|Storyboard artist Rebecca Sugar {{noted that}} <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>behind</b> <b>this</b> episode {{had been in}} {{development}} for a long time. Originally, it had been planned to make the episode during the first season because McHale and Ward were actively playing immersive, worldbuilding games. However, it took until the fourth season for the episode to be made. Nate Cash served as the episode's creative director. He messaged both Youn—who, at the time, was in South Korea—and Ward via Facebook to inform the two that he enjoyed the episode so much.

Earlier GAs did not contain local search (i. e. hill climbing) mechanisms, which led to optimization difficulties, especially in higher dimensions.

25|$|Using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, the Tutte {{polynomial}} can be arbitrarily well approximated {{along the}} positive branch of , equivalently, the partition {{function of the}} ferromagnetic Ising model. This exploits the close connection between the Ising model {{and the problem of}} counting matchings in a graph. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>behind</b> <b>this</b> celebrated result of Jerrum and Sinclair is to set up a Markov chain whose states are the matchings of the input graph. The transitions are defined by choosing edges at random and modifying the matching accordingly. The resulting Markov chain is rapidly mixing and leads to “sufficiently random” matchings, which can be used to recover the partition function using random sampling. The resulting algorithm is a fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme (fpras).|$|E
25|$|While Nehru {{exempted}} Muslim {{law from}} legislation and they remained unreformed, he did pass the Special Marriage Act in 1954. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>behind</b> <b>this</b> act {{was to give}} everyone in India the ability to marry outside the personal law under a civil marriage. As usual the law applied to all of India, except Jammu and Kashmir (again leading to accusations of selective secularism). In many respects, the act was almost identical to the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955, which gives some idea as to how secularised the law regarding Hindus had become. The Special Marriage Act allowed Muslims to marry under it and thereby retain the protections, generally beneficial to Muslim women, {{that could not be}} found in the personal law. Under the act polygamy was illegal, and inheritance and succession would be governed by the Indian Succession Act, rather than the respective Muslim Personal Law. Divorce also would be governed by the secular law, and maintenance of a divorced wife would be along the lines set down in the civil law.|$|E
25|$|After the Emperor's death, Prime Minister Li Si, who {{accompanied}} him, became extremely {{worried that the}} news of his death could trigger a general uprising in the Empire.

Most of the Imperial entourage accompanying the Emperor were left ignorant of the Emperor's death; only a younger son, Ying Huhai, who was travelling with his father, the eunuch Zhao Gao, Li Si, and five or six favourite eunuchs knew of the death. Li Si also ordered that two carts containing rotten fish be carried immediately before and after the wagon of the Emperor. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>behind</b> <b>this</b> was to prevent people from noticing the foul smell emanating from the wagon of the Emperor, where his body was starting to decompose severely as it was summertime. They also pulled down the shade so no one could see his face, changed his clothes daily, brought food and when he had to have important conversations, they would act {{as if he wanted to}} send them a message.|$|E
