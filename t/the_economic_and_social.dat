5|$|However, the {{aftermath}} of the Cold War is not always easily erased, as many of <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> tensions that were exploited to fuel Cold War competition in parts of the Third World remain acute.

In Central and Eastern Europe, the end of the Cold War has ushered in an era of economic growth and an increase in the number of liberal democracies, while in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, independence was accompanied by state failure.|$|E

5|$|In England, {{prior to}} the nineteenth century, common law {{considered}} children to be the property of their father. However, <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> changes {{that occurred during the}} nineteenth century lead to a shift in ideas about the dynamics of the family. Industrialization separated the home and the workplace, keeping fathers away from their children in order to earn wages and provide for their family. Conversely, mothers were expected to stay in the home and care for the household and the children. Important social changes such as women's suffrage and child development theories allowed for ideas surrounding the importance of maternal care.|$|E
5|$|The Consultative Committee (similar to <b>the</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Social</b> Committee) had between 30 and 50 members equally {{divided between}} producers, workers, {{consumers}} and dealers {{in the coal}} and steel sector. Again, there were no national quotas, and the treaty required representatives of European associations to organise their own democratic procedures. They were to establish rules to make their membership fully representative for democratic organised civil society. Membership were appointed {{for two years and}} were not bound by any mandate or instruction of the organisations which appointed them. The Committee had a plenary assembly, bureau and president. Again, the required democratic procedures were not introduced and nomination of these members remained in the hands of national ministers. The High Authority was obliged to consult the Committee in certain cases where it was appropriate and to keep it informed. The Consultative Committee remained separate (despite the merger of the other institutions) until 2002, when the Treaty expired and its duties were taken over by <b>the</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Social</b> Committee (ESC). Despite its independence, the Committee did cooperate with the ESC when they were consulted on the same issue.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>Social</b> Council (ECOSOC) assists the General Assembly in {{promoting}} international {{economic and social}} co-operation and development. ECOSOC has 54 members, which are elected by the General Assembly for a three-year term. The president is elected for a one-year term and chosen amongst the small or middle powers represented on ECOSOC. The council has one annual meeting in July, held in either New York or Geneva. Viewed as separate from the specialized bodies it co-ordinates, ECOSOC's functions include information gathering, advising member nations, and making recommendations. Owing to its broad mandate of co-ordinating many agencies, ECOSOC has at times been criticized as unfocused or irrelevant.|$|E

5|$|Author Jeremy Rifkin had {{previously}} written several books that, like The Empathic Civilization, {{have attempted to}} extrapolate trends in the economy, technology, and society. For example, his 1995 book The End of Work concerns the changes that tele-commuting {{would have on the}} workplace, his 1998 book The Biotech Century concerns the expected impacts of genetic engineering, and his 2002 book The Hydrogen Economy concerns <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> effects that will result from the expected replacement of fossil fuels with hydrogen as an energy storage medium. His last book before writing The Empathic Civilization was The European Dream, published in 2004, comparing the American Dream with the values expressed by Europeans in the post-industrial economy. At the time of publication, the 64-year-old Rifkin was working as an advisor to the European Union concerning issues relating to the economy, climate change, and energy security, as well as president of the American non-profit organization the Foundation on Economic Trends.|$|E
5|$|Hand {{had voted}} for Hoover in 1928, {{and he did}} so again in 1932; but in 1936, he voted for the Democrats and Franklin D. Roosevelt, as a {{reaction}} to <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> turmoil that followed the Wall Street Crash of 1929. With the Great Depression setting in, Hand favored a policy of interventionist central government. He came to accept Frankfurter's view that redistribution of wealth was essential for economic recovery. Hoover resisted this approach, favoring individualism and free enterprise. Roosevelt, on the other hand, promised the voters a New Deal. They elected him on a platform of strong executive leadership and radical economic reform. Hand voted for Roosevelt again in 1940 and 1944, but he remained vigilant on the constitutional dangers of big government. Like others, including Walter Lippmann, he sensed the dictatorial potential of New Deal policies. He had no hesitation in condemning Roosevelt's 1937 bill to expand the Supreme Court and pack it with New Dealers.|$|E

5|$|In 1931, Stojanović was {{contracted}} to the Prijedor {{branch of the}} state railway company to provide healthcare for its employees. In 1936, he was {{contracted to}} an iron ore mining company in Ljubija, a town near Prijedor, and would visit the mining company clinic twice a week. He also taught hygiene at the gymnasium in Prijedor. Together with other intellectuals from the town, he gave lectures to the miners at their club in Ljubija. His lectures were usually about medical issues, but he also described <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> position of workers in more advanced countries. He socialised with the miners and treated their family members for free. He was very active socially, and also participated in sports. In 1932, he founded the tennis club of Prijedor, which continues to bear his name. Stojanović once bought new kit for {{all members of the}} Rudar Ljubija football club. His contracts with the railway company and the mining company were both terminated in 1939. The railway employees protested in Prijedor, and Stojanović's contract with that company was subsequently renewed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seventeenth}} century the pursuit of {{witchcraft}} was largely {{taken over by the}} kirk sessions and was often used to attack superstitious and Catholic practices in Scottish society. Most of the accused, some 75 per cent, were women, with over 1,500 executed, and the witch hunt in Scotland has been seen as a means of controlling women. The most intense witch hunt was in 1661–62, which involved some 664 named witches in four counties. From this point prosecutions began to decline as trials were more tightly controlled by the judiciary and government, torture was more sparingly used and standards of evidence were raised. B. P. Levack suggests that there may also have been a growing scepticism and with relative peace and stability <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> tensions that contributed to accusation may have reduced. There were occasional local outbreaks like that in East Lothian in 1678 and 1697 at Paisley. The last recorded executions were in 1706 and the last trial in 1727. The British parliament repealed the 1563 Act in 1736.|$|E
5|$|Prosecutions {{began to}} decline as trials were more tightly {{controlled}} by the judiciary and government, torture was more sparingly used and standards of evidence were raised. The exposure of prickers as frauds in 1662 removed a major form of evidence. The Lord Advocate George Mackenzie made efforts to make prosecutions ineffective. There {{may also have been}} a growing popular scepticism, and, with relative peace and stability, <b>the</b> <b>economic</b> <b>and</b> <b>social</b> tensions that may have contributed to accusations were reduced, although there were occasional local outbreaks, like those in East Lothian in 1678 and in Paisley in 1697. The last executions in the records of the central courts were in 1706. The last trial was held in the court of a sheriff-depute at Dornoch in 1727, and was of questionable legality. The British parliament repealed the 1563 Act in 1736, making the legal pursuit of witches impossible. Nevertheless, basic magical beliefs persisted, particularly in the Highlands and Islands.|$|E
