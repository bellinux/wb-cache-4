50|$|The levator palpebrae superioris {{originates}} on {{the lesser}} {{wing of the}} sphenoid bone, just above the optic foramen. It broadens and decreases in thickness (becomes thinner) and becomes the levator aponeurosis. This portion inserts on {{the skin of the}} upper eyelid, as well as the superior <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate.</b> It is a skeletal muscle. The superior tarsal muscle, a smooth muscle, is attached to the levator palpebrae superioris, and inserts on the superior <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate</b> as well.|$|E
50|$|In {{the upper}} eyelid, the orbital septum blends with the tendon of the levator palpebrae superioris, {{and in the}} lower eyelid with the <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate.</b>|$|E
50|$|The eyelid {{is made up}} {{of several}} layers; from {{superficial}} to deep, these are: skin, subcutaneous tissue, orbicularis oculi, orbital septum and <b>tarsal</b> <b>plates,</b> and palpebral conjunctiva. The meibomian glands lie within the eyelid and secrete the lipid part of the tear film.|$|R
5000|$|The tarsi (<b>tarsal</b> <b>plates)</b> are two {{comparatively}} thick, {{elongated plates}} of dense connective tissue, about 2.5 cm in length; one {{is found in}} each eyelid, and contributes to its form and support. They are located directly above the lid margins. [...] The tarsus has a lower and upper part making up the palpebrae.|$|R
5|$|Meibomian glands, in the eyelids, secrete {{a form of}} sebum called meibum {{onto the}} eye, that slows the {{evaporation}} of tears. It also serves to create an airtight seal when the eyes are closed and its lipid quality also prevents the eyelids from sticking together. The meibomian glands are also known as tarsal glands, Zeis glands and palpebral glands. They attach directly to the follicles of the eyelashes, which are arranged vertically within the <b>tarsal</b> <b>plates</b> of the eyelids.|$|R
50|$|The {{inferior}} tarsus (tarsus inferior; inferior <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate)</b> is smaller, is thin, is elliptical in form, and has {{a vertical}} diameter of about 5 mm. The free or ciliary margins of these plates are thick and straight.|$|E
5000|$|The {{superior}} tarsus (tarsus superior; superior <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate),</b> the larger, is of a [...] form, about 10 mm in breadth at the center, {{and gradually}} narrowing toward its extremities. It is adjoined by the superior tarsal muscle ...|$|E

40|$|THE first convincing {{isolation}} of the trachoma virus was made by T'ang, Chang, Huang, and Wang (1957) using embryonate eggs: their findings were confirmed by Collier and Sowa (1958), who also showed that clinical trachoma followed inoculation of a human volunteer with isolated virus. Isolation of the virus from patients with trachoma in Australia has not previously been reported although the disease is common amongst the aborigines.

40|$|Purpose: To {{analyze the}} {{distribution}} of tarsal elastic fibers, with special emphasis on the meibomian duct area. Methods: Nine postmortem orbits (5 right, 4 left) of 7 Asian cadavers (mean age at death: 82 years, age range: 73 – 94 years), fixed in 10 % buffered formalin, were used. Full-thickness sagittal sections of the upper eyelid specimens were dehydrated and embedded in paraffin and cut in 7 -µm-thick sagittal sections. Sliced sections were stained with elastica van Gieson. Results: Elastic fibers were demonstrated in all <b>tarsal</b> <b>plates.</b> They were mostly distributed around the meibomian ducts and much less around the acini or in the tarsal stroma. These elastic fibers were also seen {{in the area of}} the muscle of Riolan. The outer part of the meibomian acini was less surrounded by elastic fibers. Conclusions: Tarsal elastic fibers are distributed mainly around the meibomian ducts, and much less around the acini or in the tarsal stroma. The fibers were also shown to extend to the area of the muscle of Riolan. These anatomical findings may help clarify the mechanisms involved in meibomian secretion.

50|$|As well as {{inactive}} {{control from}} the orbicularis oculi, the levator superior aponeurosis actively contributes to size of aperture. It {{starts at the}} apex of the orbit (eye socket) as a thin tendon, and broadens until it reaches the eyelids, between the <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate</b> and the skin. Since it is connected with other muscles that move the eye proper the eye tends to move up with the upper eyelid.|$|E
50|$|The Meibomian glands (often {{written with}} a small m, and also called tarsal glands) are {{a special kind of}} sebaceous gland at the rim of the eyelids inside the <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate,</b> {{responsible}} for the supply of meibum, an oily substance that prevents evaporation of the eye's tear film. Meibum prevents tear spillage onto the cheek, trapping tears between the oiled edge and the eyeball, and makes the closed lids airtight. There are approximately 50 glands on the upper eyelids and 25 glands on the lower eyelids.|$|E
50|$|Transpalpebral {{tonometry}} {{refers to}} methods of measuring intraocular pressure through the eyelid. The Diaton non-corneal tonometer calculates pressure {{by measuring the}} response of a free-falling rod, as it rebounds against the <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate</b> of the eyelid through the sclera. The patient is positioned so that {{the tip of the}} device and lid are overlying sclera. Non-corneal and transpalpebral tonometry does not involve contact with the cornea and does not require topical anesthetic during routine use. Transpalpebral tonometry may be useful for measuring postsurgery IOP after myopic LASIK ablation because this technique is not influenced by the treatment. The Diaton tonometer still requires further evaluation and is not a substitute or alternative for more established methods. The Diaton tonometer has a large margin of error compared with commonly used tonometers (e.g., GAT) in most patients (including those with ocular hypertension, glaucoma, and glaucoma tube shunts).|$|E

Original articlePurpose To {{examine the}} {{anatomic}} {{relationships between the}} preaponeurotic fat pad, orbital septum, and the distal end of the anterior layer of the levator aponeurosis (DEALLA) {{in relation to the}} superior <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate</b> border. Design Prospective, clinical case series and experimental anatomic study. Participants Twenty-two upper eyelids in 11 Asian patients (average age, 76. 5 years) and 10 postmortem upper eyelid specimens of 7 Asians (average age, 81 years). Methods The relationships between the orbital septum, DEALLA, preaponeurotic fat pad, and the superior <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate</b> border were examined in vivo, during upper blepharoplasty. In cadavers, the orbital septum was exposed and excised from the DEALLA, and the distance from the superior <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate</b> border to the DEALLA was measured at 3 points: the center of the palpebral width, and 2 points located 7 mm medial and lateral to the center. Main Outcome Measures The anatomic relationships of the orbital septum, DEALLA, and the preaponeurotic fat pad with the superior <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate</b> border. Results In vivo, the DEALLA was always located above the superior <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate</b> border, and the lower margin of the preaponeurotic fat was always positioned below the DEALLA and around the superior <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate</b> border. The lateral preaponeurotic fat in 4 eyelids showed extension beyond the superior tarsal border. In cadavers, the average distance from the superior <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate</b> border to the DEALLA was 3. 7 mm centrally, 3. 0 mm medially, and 0. 9 mm laterally. In 3 specimens, the confluent part of the orbital septum and the levator aponeurosis reached the tarsus in the lateral area. Conclusions Orbital septum attachment on the levator aponeurosis in Asians seems to be situated above the superior <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate</b> border in vivo, but the preaponeurotic fat extends beyond the DEALLA, sometimes reaching the <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate.</b> In some cadavers, the confluent part was found to be situated on the tarsus laterally.

40|$|Purpose The aim of {{this work}} {{is to develop a}} more {{complete}} understanding of the in vivo histology of the human palpebral conjunctiva and <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate.</b> Methods. The upper eyelids of 11 healthy human volunteer subjects were everted, and laser scanning confocal microscopy was used to examine the various tissue layers of the palpebral conjunctiva and <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate.</b> Results The superficial and basal epithelial layers are composed of cells with gray cytoplasm and thick, light gray borders. Nuclei can not be seen. The stroma has a varied appearance; fibrous tissue is sometimes observed, interspersed with dark,amorphous lacunae, and crevases. Numerous single white or gray cells populate this tissue, and fine blood vessels are seen traversing the field. Occasional conjunctival microcysts and Langerhans cells are observed. The <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate</b> is dark and amorphous, and meibomian gland acini with convoluted borders are clearly observed. Acini are composed of an outer lining of large cuboidal cells, and differentiated secretory cells can be seen within the acini lumen. Conclusions Laser scanning confocal microscopy is capable of studying the human palpebral conjunctiva, <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate,</b> and acini of meibomian glands in vivo.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{characterize}} the microscopic {{anatomy of the}} lacrimal punctum and canaliculi {{in relation to the}} <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate,</b> muscle of Riolan, and Horner muscle; and to report a novel technique to excise the horizontal canaliculus in severe dry eye patients. DESIGN: Observational anatomic study and a retrospective case series. METHODS: The microscopic anatomy was studied in 86 eyelids of 25 cadavers (age range: 45 - 96 years, mean: 79. 5 years). Surgery was performed on 18 canaliculi of 7 patients with dry eyes (age range: 37 - 69 years, mean: 59. 9 years). In the microscopic study, 32 eyelids were incised sagittally, 38 eyelids were incised horizontally (1 mm from the eyelid margin), and 16 eyelids were incised parallel to the <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate.</b> All specimens were stained with Masson trichrome. In the surgical group, probe-guided horizontal canalicular excision with incision of the Horner muscle to the lateral edge of the lacrimal caruncle was performed. Both canalicular stumps were cauterized. RESULTS: In the microscopic anatomic study, the punctum and the vertical canaliculus were part of the <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate</b> with the muscle of Riolan, whereas the horizontal canaliculus was surrounded by the Horner muscle. In the surgical group, all the operated canaliculi were completely occluded without recanalization 12 months postoperatively. No complications were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: Based on microscopic anatomic findings that the lacrimal punctum and the vertical canaliculus are part of the <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate,</b> and that the horizontal canaliculus is surrounded by the Horner muscle, excision of the horizontal canaliculus may be an effective technique to treat patients with severe dry eyes.

40|$|Abstract. The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to compare the efficiency of three methods for repairing tarsal defects (glycerine-preserved, alcohol-preserved and cryopreserved <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate</b> and palpebral conjunctival transplantation) based on histopathological changes and apoptosis, and to evaluate the clinical effects of repairing tarsal defects by liquid nitrogen-cryopreserved <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate</b> and palpebral conjunctival transplantation. Forty-eight rabbit eyes with tarsal defects were equally divided into three groups and transplanted with tarsal plates and palpebral conjunctivae under the following conditions: Group 1, liquid nitrogen cryopreservation; Group 2, glycerine preservation; and Group 3, alcohol pres-ervation. Histopathological changes in the transplants were observed by light microscopy 1 week, 1 month and 3 months postoperatively. Apoptosis was assessed by terminal deoxy-nucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Clinically, transplantations of liquid nitrogen-cryopreserved tarsal plates and palpebral conjunctivae were performed in 30 eyes (29 cases) to repair tarsal defects caused by the excision of neoplasms. The postoperative inflamma-tory reaction and number of apoptotic cells in Group 1 were lower compared with those in Groups 2 and 3. Clinically, of the 30 eyes operated on, 14 were cured, 15 improved and 1 failed between 6 and 90 months of follow-up. Liquid nitrogen-cryopreserved <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate</b> and palpebral conjunctival transplantation is an easy, feasible and convenient procedure. Its effects are fairly favorable, with only a small rejection rate postoperatively. Therefore, it is an ideal method for repairing tarsal defects...|$|E
40|$|Eyelids {{from ten}} cynomolgus monkeys were {{sectioned}} {{in a variety}} of orientations and the conjunctival layer examined by light and electron microscopy. An elastic lamina composed of a mesh of mature elastic fibres was present in the palpebral conjunctival stroma adjacent to the epithelium covering the area of the <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate</b> and extending to the lid margin. Mesh fibres orientated at or close to right angles to the lid margin were thicker and denser than the transverse and oblique fibres linking them. The elastic lamina was most substantial in the marginal conjunctiva bridging the interval between the <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate</b> and the mucocutaneous junction where it terminated abruptly. In this position the area occupied by the elastic mesh exceeded that of the mesh spaces. Dense collagen bundles enclosed the lamina, infiltrating the mesh spaces and attaching the lamina firmly to the <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate.</b> In the marginal zone thick elastic fibres branched forward from the lamina in a brush-like fashion penetrating the relatively soft marginal eyelid tissue obliquely between tarsal gland ducts, while other finer, more numerous fibrils passed backwards attaching the lamina to the basement membrane of the epithelium. The organisation of the elastic lamina suggests that the tension generated would act to pull the lid margins towards the surface of the eye. Production of a regular thin tear film during lid retraction following a blink is facilitated by this action...|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2009 American Academy of Ophthalmology Published by Elsevier Inc. PURPOSE: To {{report the}} {{surgical}} outcome {{with a new}} modification of the Hotz procedure for cilial entropion repair. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-nine lower eyelids of 29 patients (22 female, 7 male; average age 8. 4 years, range 2 - 27 years). METHODS: The study included all patients diagnosed with cilial entropion and significant ocular irritation causing epiphora, photophobia, and ocular discharge, with or without keratitis. Surgery is based on dividing the anterior layer of the lower eyelid retractors from the anterior <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate</b> surface, definite identification of the inferior <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate</b> border, and reinforcement of the skin to the <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate</b> and lower eyelid retractors. Surgical outcome was defined as "good" or "fair" {{when there was no}} contact between the eyelashes and the globe or when less than 5 asymptomatic eyelashes had direct contact with the globe, respectively. A "poor" outcome was defined as either the majority of eyelashes remained in contact with the globe or persistence of irritation/keratitis in the presence of residual in-turned eyelashes. A successful outcome ("good" or "fair") required no additional surgical intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Surgical outcome ("good," "fair," or "poor"), postoperative complications, recurrence. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up period of 27. 4 months (range, 3 - 50 months), 40 eyelids (82 %) were judged postoperatively as "good," 7 eyelids (14 %) were judged as "fair," and 2 eyelids (4 %) were judged as "poor. " The 2 eyelids with a poor outcome were reoperated successfully using the same technique. No postoperative complications were recorded. There were no cases of recurrence, except the 2 eyelids with a "poor" outcome, during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: Our modification of the Hotz procedure is based on identifying and dividing the anterior layer of the lower eyelid retractors and reinforcing the skin to the lower border of the inferior <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate</b> and lower eyelid retractors. This is a useful and predictive technique for cilial entropion repair and results in a high success rate. Hirohiko Kakizaki, Dinesh Selva and Igal Leibovitc...|$|E

40|$|AIMS [...] The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} different surgical options for the repair of the ocular surface, using various extensions of the procedure of limbal stem cell allotransplantation. METHODS/RESULTS [...] Straightforward lamellar limbal transplantation was performed in one patient with contact lens induced limbal stem cell failure. A second patient with a neoplastic corneal lesion underwent limbal allotransplantation, followed later by a second procedure in which 360 degrees of limbus and the entire ocular surface was transplanted. A third patient who had suffered extensive chemical burns was treated by penetrating keratoplasty to restore central corneal clarity, followed later by a lamellar allograft comprising a 360 degrees annulus of peripheral cornea to repair the ocular surface. A fourth patient with long standing, chronic trachomatous eye disease underwent allotransplantation of the upper lid <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate</b> and conjunctiva, with reconstruction of the fornix. Finally, a child with Goldenhar's syndrome underwent reconstruction of the medial fornix with autologous buccal mucosa, followed by a lamellar corneal and conjunctival allograft.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Two {{surgical}} procedures for ectropion correction are compared: the widespread “lateral tarsal strip” {{and the more}} recently introduced “tarsal belt” techniques. A retrospective interventional patient series of 40 patients with mono or bilateral ectropion are investigated. Distances of lower lid margin from interpupillary line before surgery and after 1, 6, 12, and 24 months in tarsal belt and lateral tarsal strip surgical procedure are compared. The postoperative distance is reduced in both the groups of patients, but as regard the tarsal belt the amount of correction is greater and more stable over time and this difference is statistically significant. The ideal surgical technique for ectropionʼs correction must be focused simultaneously on the lid and on the canthal region because it is mandatory to tight and elevate the lower lid, rotate the <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate,</b> lift the lateral canthal ligament fixing it in a sure fashion. The tarsal strip technique {{can result in a}} more vulnerability to relapse. In fact, all the lower eyelid is maintained through the little strip that is assured with a single stitch to the orbital rim periosteum. The tarsal belt technique allows a more uniform distribution of the tissue excess. The suture, with its multiple intratarsal stitches, produces a real reinforcement of the eyelid. The double passage is an added value because it is the element that assures a precise regulation of the <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate</b> rotation. Thus, the tarsal belt technique guarantees a better result over time...|$|E

40|$|The {{superior}} tarsus is a {{plate of}} tissue that stiffens the upper eyelid, gives it support and determines its form. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to relate the composition of its extracellular matrix to its function and to report regional differences that may influence the activity of its Meibomian glands. Fourteen methanol-fixed specimens were cryosectioned for immunohistochemistry and labelled with a panel of monoclonal antibodies against a wide range of collagens, glycosaminoglycans and proteoglycans. Labelling was detected with avidin–biotin–peroxidase. A further six specimens were formalin-fixed for routine histology. The <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate</b> immunolabelled strongly for types I, III and VI collagen and for aggrecan, versican, tenascin, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) together with a variety of glycosaminoglycans (notably chondroitin 6 sulphate). A region of strong labelling for aggrecan, dermatan sulphate and chondroitin 6 sulphate immediately surrounded the Meibomian glands. The site of labelling corresponded to a layer of acellular and amorphous matrix seen histologically that we have termed the ‘territorial matrix’. The results suggested that the <b>tarsal</b> <b>plate</b> is a specialized connective tissue that is neither purely fibrous nor cartilaginous, yet has an aggrecan content that probably contributes to its stiffness. Its unique character highlights the challenge in choosing an ideal mechanical substitute. As patients with rheumatoid arthritis often have problems relating to tear film deficiency, the ability of aggrecan or COMP to act as autoantigens may be significant. An immune reaction directed against these molecules could alter tarsal gland function by interfering with the interaction between the glands and their territorial matrix...|$|E
