5|$|A {{short time}} later Brock {{received}} a report from Fort George {{that some of the}} garrison were planning to imprison <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> flee to the U.S. Immediately he boarded the schooner that had brought the message and proceeded to Fort George, under the command of then-Lieutenant-Colonel Roger Hale Sheaffe. A hastily assembled honour guard formed to greet Brock's unexpected arrival. Alone on entering the fort, Brock ordered the sergeant of the guard to disarm and had him confined.|$|E

5|$|Aware of Cal and Ruth's disapproval, Rose rebuffs Jack's advances, but {{realizes she}} prefers him over Cal. After rendezvousing {{on the bow}} at sunset, Rose takes Jack to her state room; at her request, Jack {{sketches}} Rose posing nude wearing Cal's engagement present, the Heart of the Ocean necklace. They evade Cal's bodyguard, Mr. Lovejoy, and have sex in an automobile inside the cargo hold.

5|$|By {{the end of}} October 1943, Howe and King George V had {{returned}} to Britain. At the end of year, Howe underwent a long overhaul at Devonport, where a number of alterations were made. Her anti-aircraft armament was increased, changes were made to her radar, and her watertight integrity in the stern was improved. Modifications were accomplished in <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> crew quarters for operations in tropical climates; these included changes in insulation, and the extensive use of air-conditioning equipment.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the {{division}} had completed its training, it was still about one third below its designated strength in both officers and NCOs, and its officer corps remained almost entirely German.

5|$|In the Convict Establishment of 1855, the {{day began}} with the wakeup bell at 4:30 am, and <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> prisoners {{assembled}} in the parade ground at 5:25 am. Prisoners were sent to work before and after breakfast (in their cells), before assembling for muster at midday. This was followed by dinner in the exercise yard or the work site, and more work throughout the afternoon, until supper at 6:00 pm in the cells. Night officers took over at 7:15 pm.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1871, U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant had named Hall as overall {{commander}} of the expedition, and he was being referred to as Captain. Though Hall had abundant Arctic experience, he had no sailing experience, and so the title was purely honorary. In selecting <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> seamen, Hall relied heavily on whalers with experience in the Arctic. This was markedly different from the polar expeditions of the British Admiralty, which tended to use naval officers and highly disciplined crews.|$|E

50|$|Mediation is {{an option}} for certain {{complaints}} provided <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> {{does not have an}} extensive CCRB history, there was no arrest made and severe force or abuse of authority were not involved. In mediation, <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>and</b> civilian both voluntarily bypass the investigative process and meet each other one-on-one with a third party mediator to discuss the incident and resolve it. This results in no disciplinary action being taken against <b>the</b> <b>officer</b> <b>and</b> often results in a more satisfied civilian as an outcome.|$|R
5|$|On the column's inglorious {{return to}} Bulawayo on 18 December 1893, Forbes was {{received}} in muted disgrace. <b>The</b> <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> men stood on parade for Cecil Rhodes, and the Company chief passed the major without a word. Raaff, {{on the other}} hand, was publicly commended by Rhodes, and thanked for ensuring the column's safe return.|$|E
5|$|One madame {{described}} as 'the great bawd of the seamen' by Samuel Pepys was Damaris Page. Born in Stepney in approximately 1610, {{she had moved}} from prostitution to running brothels, including one on the Highway that catered for ordinary seaman and a further establishment nearby that catered for the more expensive tastes amongst <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> gentry. She died wealthy, in 1669, in {{a house on the}} Highway, despite charges being brought against her and time spent in Newgate Prison.|$|E
5|$|Several of <b>the</b> <b>{{officers}}</b> <b>and</b> petty {{officers in}} charge of the main gun turret crews believed that Skelley's and Costigan's proposed experiments were dangerous, especially because of the age of the guns and the turrets, in addition to their numerous maintenance problems. Meyer complained to Commander Robert John Kissinger, Iowas chief weapons officer, about the proposed experiments, but Kissinger refused to convey the concerns to Captain Moosally or halt the experiments.|$|E

5|$|The rest of <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> {{scientific}} {{staff were}} Americans (first mate Hubbard Chester, second mate William Morton, and astronomer and chaplain R.W.D. Bryan) and Germans (chief scientist and surgeon Emil Bessels and meteorologist Frederick Meyer). The seamen were mostly German, as was chief engineer Emil Schumann. In {{addition to the}} 25officers, crew, and scientific staff, Hall brought Inuit interpreter and hunter Ebierbing, his wife Tookoolito, and their child. A Greenlandic aboriginal named Hans Hendrik, his wife Merkut and three children also joined the expedition.|$|E
5|$|After the Romanian Communist Party seized {{political}} power, the sovietization of {{the army}} commenced, {{under the supervision of}} the new Minister of Defence, Emil Bodnăraş. Thirty per cent of <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> noncommissioned officers (mostly experienced soldiers, and a potential source of opposition) were purged from the military. This involved copying the Soviet model of military and political organisation, and changing the military doctrine of combat and defence, also in the context of Romania's integration in the strategic system of the Soviets, at the beginning of the Cold War.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{immediately}} {{effort was}} focused upon selecting and identifying <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> NCOs. To this end volunteers were called for amongst units {{that had already}} formed {{as part of the}} 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF) and from new recruits. At the end of November, 146 trainees reported to the Army School at Trentham, where even serving officers and NCOs were required to prove their suitability for positions in the new battalion. Concurrently, recruiting of men to fill the other ranks positions began in early October and within three weeks nearly 900 men had enlisted. The process was carried out by recruiting officers who worked closely with tribal authorities, and the recruits were restricted to single men aged between 21 and 35, although later married men were allowed to join, but only if they did not have more than two children of similar ages.|$|E
5|$|Desertion was {{a problem}} for the 24th Infantry; the 25th Infantry Division had to detain 116 deserters from the 24th Infantry during August, {{compared}} to 15 from the 27th Infantry and 12 from the 35th Infantry. In late August, Kean began investigating the unit's behavior, including its poor performance at the battle of Sangju several weeks earlier, and found its performance was affecting other units of the division. After the 24th's performance at the battles of Battle Mountain and Haman, Kean suggested to Walker that the regiment be disbanded and its troops be used as replacements for other units in the field. Virtually all of <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> enlisted men in the regiment were supportive of this idea, but Walker declined, feeling he could not afford to lose a regiment. Even if his other units were reinforced, he did not feel they could be extended to cover the entire line.|$|E
5|$|Hotham and Osborn {{discussed}} {{the situation and}} determined to destroy the wreck to deny it to the French. To this end, three cutters were gathered and a boarding party under Lieutenant Edward Grey sent in to attack Preneuse at 20:00. This party came under fire from the batteries but was able to successfully access the battered French frigate at 21:00, finding that only <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>and</b> a handful of sailors remained, the others having been {{given the opportunity to}} escape to the shore in boats rather than become prisoners of war. Among the captives was Lhermitte, who was permitted to bring his personal baggage with him before he was brought to the British squadron as a prisoner. Grey then set the wrecked ship alight before returning to Adamant, having executed his orders without losing a single man.|$|E
