50|$|Bombs {{operating}} by {{the former}} method of fixation to {{the underside of the}} car more often than not make use of a device called a <b>tilt</b> <b>fuse.</b> A small tube designed of glass or plastic, the <b>tilt</b> <b>fuse</b> is not dissimilar to a mercury switch or medical tablet tube. One end of the fuse will be filled with mercury, while the other open end is wired with the ends of an open circuit to an electrical firing system. Naturally, when the <b>tilt</b> <b>fuse</b> moves or is jerked, the supply of mercury will flow {{to the top of the}} tube and close the circuit. Thus, as the vehicle goes through the regular bumping and dipping that comes with driving over a terrain, the circuit is completed and the bomb or explosive is allowed to function.|$|E
50|$|Three {{variants}} {{of the mine}} exist: one with a magnetic fuse which detonates upon magnetic influence, one with a self-extending <b>tilt</b> rod <b>fuse,</b> and another with a contact baffle. In addition, the magnetic fuse mine has an anti-handling device.|$|R
50|$|The PDM-2 has a spherical case. The mine {{has a large}} base plate, {{which it}} is fixed to by a pole, and four {{suspension}} wires. It uses a VPDM-2 <b>tilt</b> rod <b>fuse,</b> {{and can be used}} in water from 2.4 to 3.8 meters deep.|$|R
50|$|The PDM-1 has a {{hemispherical}} steel case, {{which is}} anchored to a heavy steel base. It is normally deployed in water {{one or two}} meters deep, and has a central fixing point for a tilt rod. Two men can lay a single mine in 10 to 20 minutes. The mine uses a VPDM-1M <b>tilt</b> rod <b>fuse</b> with an MD-10 detonator.|$|R
50|$|A <b>tilt</b> fuze or <b>fuse</b> is {{a device}} usually {{used in the}} {{operation}} of car bombs and other such detonators, relying on the force of a jerk or similar movement for the triggering of the desired explosion.|$|R
40|$|The photodetachment {{cross section}} of H− was {{measured}} using the animated-crossed-beam technique in the 700 - to 1064 -nm range. The laser beam was repeatedly swept across the ion beam by <b>tilting</b> a <b>fused</b> silica plate in order to {{eliminate the need for}} beam profile measurements. After integration of the signal, the cross section was expressed in terms of easily measurable quantities, e. g., the laser power and the ion beam current. The present results are in excellent agreement with previous experiments and compelling theoretical works...|$|R
50|$|The fossorially {{specialized}} family Spalacidae shows peculiarities in {{the condition}} of the zygomatic plate. In Tachyoryctes and the Rhizomyinae, it is <b>tilted</b> upward and <b>fused</b> to the sides of the snout (rostrum). In the Spalacinae and Myospalacinae, on the other hand, the plate is tilted downward into an almost horizontal position.|$|R
40|$|Filopodia that {{protrude}} {{forward from}} the lamellipodium, located {{at the leading edge}} of a neuronal growth cone, are needed to guide the extension of a nerve cell. At the core of each filopodium an actin bundle forms and grows into the lamellipodium. By using kymographs of time-lapse polarized light images we examined the relationship between the behavior of the filopodia, the actin bundles immediately proximal to the filopodia, and the shapes and composition of actin bundles in the whole lamellipodium. We find that the shapes of actin bundles, such as <b>tilt,</b> fork, and <b>fused</b> zones, originate at the leading edge and are surprisingly well preserved during retrograde transport of the actin cytoskeleton in the whole lamellipodium. The number of filaments that make up the radial actin bundles, as displayed by their birefringence retardation, also is preserved during retrograde flow over a distance of 4 - 8 microm from the leading edge into the lamellipodium. Thus, the disposition of the actin bundles in the lamellipodium frozen at any time point preserves and portrays a history of the past behavior of actin bundles proximal to the filopodia and the behavior of the filopodia themselves. These findings suggest that the arrangement of actin bundles in static image records, such as electron or fluorescence micrographs of fixed and stained specimens, can in fact reveal the sequence of the past history of filopodial behavior and the generation, density, fusion, etc. of the filaments in the actin bundles...|$|R
40|$|AbstractParkinson's disease-associated α-synuclein is an amyloidogenic protein {{not only}} {{expressed}} in the cytoplasm of neurons, but also secreted in the extracellular space and internalized into glial cells through a lipid raft-dependent process. We previously showed that α-synuclein interacts with raft glycosphingolipids through a structural motif common to various viral and amyloidogenic proteins. Here we report that α-synuclein also interacts with cholesterol, as assessed by surface pressure measurements of cholesterol-containing monolayers. Using a panel of recombinant fragments and synthetic peptides, we identified two distinct cholesterol-binding domains in α-synuclein. One of these domains, which corresponds to the tilted peptide of α-synuclein (67 – 78), bound cholesterol with high affinity and was toxic for cultured astrocytes. Molecular modeling suggested that cholesterol binds to this peptide with a tilt angle of 46 °. α-synuclein also contains a cholesterol recognition consensus motif, which had a lower affinity for cholesterol and was devoid of toxicity. This motif is encased in the glycosphingolipid-binding domain (34 – 45) of α-synuclein. In raft-like model membranes containing both cholesterol and glycosphingolipids, the head groups of glycosphingolipids prevented the accessibility of cholesterol to exogenous ligands. Nevertheless, cholesterol appeared to ‘signal’ its presence by tuning glycosphingolipid conformation, thereby facilitating α-synuclein binding to raft-like membranes. We propose that the association of α-synuclein with lipid rafts involves both the binding of α-synuclein (34 – 45) to glycosphingolipids, and {{the interaction of the}} fusogenic tilted peptide (67 – 78) with cholesterol. Coincidentally, a similar mechanism is used by viruses (HIV- 1, HTLV-I, Ebola) which display a <b>tilted</b> peptide and <b>fuse</b> with host cell membranes through a sphingolipid/cholesterol-dependent process...|$|R
