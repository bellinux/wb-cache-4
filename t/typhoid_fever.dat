5|$|On 9 December, one of Albert's doctors, William Jenner, {{diagnosed}} <b>typhoid</b> <b>fever.</b> Albert died at 10:50p.m. on 14 December 1861 in the Blue Room at Windsor Castle, in {{the presence}} of the Queen and five of their nine children. The contemporary diagnosis was <b>typhoid</b> <b>fever,</b> but modern writers have pointed out that Albert was ill for at least two years before his death, which may indicate that a chronic disease, such as Crohn's disease, renal failure, or abdominal cancer, was the cause of death.|$|E
5|$|Several {{natural causes}} (diseases) have been suggested, {{including}} malaria and <b>typhoid</b> <b>fever.</b> A 1998 {{article in the}} New England Journal of Medicine attributed his death to <b>typhoid</b> <b>fever</b> complicated by bowel perforation and ascending paralysis. Another recent analysis suggested pyogenic (infectious) spondylitis or meningitis. Other illnesses fit the symptoms, including acute pancreatitis and West Nile virus. Natural-cause theories also tend to emphasize that Alexander's health {{may have been in}} general decline after years of heavy drinking and severe wounds. The anguish that Alexander felt after Hephaestion's death may also have contributed to his declining health.|$|E
5000|$|Zymotic {{diseases}} (from the Greek word ζυμοῦν zumoûn [...] "to ferment") is a 19th-century medical {{term for}} acute infectious diseases, especially [...] "chief fevers and contagious diseases (e.g. typhus and <b>typhoid</b> <b>fevers,</b> smallpox, scarlet fever, measles, erysipelas, cholera, whooping-cough, diphtheria, &c.)".|$|R
50|$|Dam House {{was sold}} in November 1889 and {{remained}} empty until 1893 when it was sold to the Leigh Council {{for use as a}} sanatorium for treating infectious diseases. Four isolation wards were built to house patients with scarlet and <b>typhoid</b> <b>fevers</b> and the house was used as offices and a nurses' home.|$|R

5|$|On September 27, 1891, at 19:00, Clayton's {{wife died}} at their {{residence}} in Keyser {{as a result}} of contracting <b>typhoid</b> <b>fever.</b> She was buried at Indian Mound Cemetery in Romney.|$|E
5|$|According to some sources, Lincoln's first romantic {{interest}} was Ann Rutledge, {{whom he met}} when he first moved to New Salem; these sources indicate that by 1835, {{they were in a}} relationship but not formally engaged. She {{died at the age of}} 22 on August 25, 1835, most likely of <b>typhoid</b> <b>fever.</b> In the early 1830s, he met Mary Owens from Kentucky when she was visiting her sister.|$|E
5|$|During the Civil War, the {{infrastructure}} of St. Louis suffered from neglect; another cholera epidemic struck in 1866, and <b>typhoid</b> <b>fever</b> raged. In response, St. Louis improved its water system and established a Board of Health to regulate polluting industries. St. Louis's park system was expanded during the 1860s and 1870s, {{with the creation of}} Tower Grove Park and Forest Park.|$|E
50|$|From {{the time}} of the Black Death in the mid-14th century until {{the second half of the}} 19th century, Oxford was {{regularly}} visited by plague, cholera, smallpox and <b>typhoid</b> <b>fevers.</b> In 1348, the Black Death reduced the city's population to such an extent that Gloucester College (from which Gloucester Green derives its name) was forced to close. In 1571, Oxford University had to postpone the start of term because of an outbreak of plague, and the 'gaol fever' six years later may have been part of the same epidemic, being considered more worthy of note because its victims included the Lord Chief Baron and the Lord High Sheriff.|$|R

5|$|Prior to abandoning Bowling Green, Governor Johnson {{requested}} that Richard Hawes {{come to the}} city and help with the administration of the government, but Hawes was delayed due to a bout with <b>typhoid</b> <b>fever.</b> Following Johnson's death, the provisional government elected Hawes, who was still recovering from his illness, as governor. Following his recovery, Hawes joined the government in Corinth, Mississippi, and took the oath of office on May 31.|$|E
5|$|On June 24, 1898, Morrow enlisted as {{a private}} in the 4th Kentucky Infantry Regiment for service in the Spanish–American War. He was first {{stationed}} at Lexington, Kentucky, and later trained at Anniston, Alabama. Due to a bout with <b>typhoid</b> <b>fever,</b> he never saw active duty, and mustered out as a second lieutenant on February 12, 1899. In 1900, he matriculated for the fall semester at the University of Cincinnati Law School. He graduated with a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1902.|$|E
5|$|The {{diagnosis}} {{should be}} considered in anyone who develops a fever within two weeks of being in the tropics or subtropics. It can be difficult to distinguish dengue fever and chikungunya, a similar viral infection that shares many symptoms and occurs in similar parts of the world to dengue. Often, investigations are performed to exclude other conditions that cause similar symptoms, such as malaria, leptospirosis, viral hemorrhagic fever, <b>typhoid</b> <b>fever,</b> meningococcal disease, measles, and influenza. Zika fever also has similar symptoms as dengue.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{his time}} in the General Assembly, Breckinridge had battled with <b>typhoid</b> <b>fever.</b> In an 1828 letter to his wife, who was visiting {{relatives}} in Virginia, he recounted that he had been bedridden and near death for two months. Finally, in February 1829, the illness subsided. Only then could he be told about the death of his daughter, Louisiana, which had occurred a month earlier. The illness, combined with the news of the death of his daughter, caused Breckinridge to turn to religion.|$|E
5|$|After the storm, New Jersey {{state health}} {{department}} investigators from Trenton were dispatched to study the possibility {{for an increase in}} <b>typhoid</b> <b>fever</b> in flooded areas. In Woodbury, where the city pumping station was flooded, water was rationed. Gas service was also limited in Woodbury, Pedricktown, Penns Grove. As a result of a gas plant becoming inundated in Glassboro, electricity was rationalized in Hammonton, forcing residents to eat uncooked food. Police were forced to transport residents of Mount Holly to work via boat due to the high floodwaters.|$|E
5|$|Crosby {{was invited}} in 1892 {{to serve as}} {{head coach of the}} United States Naval Academy {{football}} program. He accepted the position, and, using unusually rigorous practicing strategies, led the team to a 5–2 record, culminating in an upset victory over rival Army in the Army–Navy Game. He received commendation for the victory, including a gift of a personalized trophy. Following the season's conclusion, Crosby returned to New York to continue his studies, but he was hospitalized after an illness he contracted while coaching worsened shortly after his arrival. He died from <b>typhoid</b> <b>fever</b> in late December, at the age of 24.|$|E

The United States' Center for Disease Control publish recommended medical guidelines, the Yellow Book,as a reference for physicians treating international travelers.Immunizations recommended for international travel normally include Chicken Pox, Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, <b>Typhoid,</b> Yellow <b>Fever</b> and Japanese Encephalitis.|$|R
5|$|If {{bacteria}} form a parasitic {{association with}} other organisms, they are classed as pathogens. Pathogenic bacteria {{are a major}} cause of human death and disease and cause infections such as tetanus, <b>typhoid</b> <b>fever,</b> diphtheria, syphilis, cholera, foodborne illness, leprosy and tuberculosis. A pathogenic cause for a known medical disease may only be discovered many years after, {{as was the case with}} Helicobacter pylori and peptic ulcer disease. Bacterial diseases are also important in agriculture, with bacteria causing leaf spot, fire blight and wilts in plants, as well as Johne's disease, mastitis, salmonella and anthrax in farm animals.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the typhoon's tremendous impact, the Japanese military was deployed to Osaka before nightfall on September21 and water was being trucked in. Officials in Osaka Prefecture released an immediate ¥10million in relief funds. Baron Kischizaemon Sumitomo donated ¥1million (US$300,000) to relief funds, the largest such private donation in the nation's {{history at the}} time. The Cabinet of Japan held a special meeting to discuss emergency operations. Three destroyers from the Kure Naval District, loaded with medical equipment and other essentials, were deployed to assist in relief work. Outbreaks of <b>typhoid</b> <b>fever,</b> dysentery, and scarlet fever plagued survivors in the storm's aftermath.|$|E
5|$|In November 1861, the self-appointed {{members of}} the Confederate state {{sovereignty}} convention in Russellville, Kentucky appointed Hawes state auditor of the Commonwealth's Confederate government, but he declined {{in order to continue}} his military service. However, he wrote President Davis on January 25, 1862 to inform him that he was traveling to Bowling Green, Kentucky at Confederate Governor George W. Johnson's request in order to assist Johnson in administering the state government. He resigned his military commission two days later, but his departure for Bowling Green was delayed when he was stricken with <b>typhoid</b> <b>fever.</b>|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to forecast epidemic peaks of <b>typhoid</b> and paratyphoid <b>fever</b> in China using the grey disaster model, to evaluate its feasibility of predicting the epidemic tendency of notifiable diseases. Methods: According to epidemiological features, the GM(1, 1) model and DGM model were used to build the grey disaster model based on the incidence data of <b>typhoid</b> and paratyphoid <b>fever</b> collected from the China Health Statistical Yearbook. Model fitting accuracy test was used to evaluate the performance of these two models. Then, the next catastrophe date was predicted by the better model. Results: The simulation results showed that DGM model was better than GM(1, 1) model in our data set. Using the DGM model, we predicted the next epidemic peak time will occur between 2023 to 2025. Conclusion: The grey disaster model can predict the <b>typhoid</b> and paratyphoid <b>fever</b> epidemic time precisely, which may provide valuable information for disease prevention and control...|$|R
25|$|Though the fluoroquinolones are {{sometimes}} {{used to treat}} <b>typhoid</b> and paratyphoid <b>fever,</b> {{it should be noted}} here that norfloxacin had more clinical failures than the other fluoroquinolones (417 participants, 5 trials).|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The paper {{describes}} the first reported case of multifocal choroiditis following simultaneous hepatitis-A, <b>typhoid,</b> and yellow <b>fever</b> vaccinations. A 33 -year-old male developed sudden onset of flashing lights and floaters {{in his right}} eye 3 weeks following hepatitis A, <b>typhoid,</b> and yellow <b>fever</b> vaccinations. Fundus examination and angiography confirmed the presence of multiple peripheral chorioretinal lesions. These lesions demonstrated characteristic morphologic changes {{over a period of}} 8 weeks which were consistent with a diagnosis of self-resolving multifocal choroiditis. Vaccine-induced intraocular inflammation has been described infrequently. We demonstrate the first case of self-resolving multifocal choroiditis following simultaneous administration of hepatitis A, yellow <b>fever,</b> and <b>typhoid</b> immunizations...|$|R
5|$|Some {{survivors}} of Hurricane Liza {{complained that they}} had only received one ration {{of food and water}} within 3 days of the passage of Liza. Subsequently, armed troops guarded gangs of looters that damaged additional homes. An effort was made to cure people who were suffering from sickness, but by midday on October3, after treating more than 5,000persons, the effort had been halted {{due to a lack of}} sterile cotton vital for administrating the shots. Medical workers attempted to vaccinate all survivors for <b>typhoid</b> <b>fever</b> and tetanus, but the supply of syringes ran short. A large memorial service was held on October2 in a nearby church.|$|E

This discovery leads to more light. From it may be learned that either human faith or the divine Mind is the healer and that there is no efficacy in a drug.|$|E
5|$|The {{hospital}} {{cared for}} more than 4,500 patients (most of them Jews) from 20 countries, suffering from starvation, alimentary dystrophy, gangrene, necrosis, internal haemorrhaging, and <b>typhoid</b> <b>fever.</b> At least 500 patients died. Assistance was provided by volunteers from Oświęcim and Brzeszcze, who donated money and food, cleaned hospital rooms, delivered water, washed patients, cooked meals, buried the dead, and transported the sick in horse-drawn carts between locations. Securing enough food for thousands of former prisoners was a constant challenge. The hospital director personally went from village to village to collect milk.|$|E
