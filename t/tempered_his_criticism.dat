500|$|Oblivion {{features}} {{the voices of}} Patrick Stewart, Lynda Carter, Sean Bean, Terence Stamp, Ralph Cosham, and Wes Johnson, with celebrity acquisition and voice production being handled by Blindlight. The voice acting received mixed reviews in the gaming press. While many publications praised it as excellent, others found fault with its repetitiveness. The issue has been blamed on {{the small number of}} voice actors and the blandness of the dialogue itself. Lead designer Ken Rolston found the plan to fully voice the game [...] "less flexible, less apt for user projection of his own tone, more constrained for branching, and more trouble for production and disk real estate" [...] than Morrowinds partially recorded dialogue. Rolston <b>tempered</b> <b>his</b> <b>criticism</b> with the suggestion that voice acting [...] "can be a powerful expressive tool" [...] and can contribute significantly to the charm and ambience of the game. He stated [...] "I prefer Morrowinds partially recorded dialogue, for many reasons. But I'm told that voiced dialogue is what the kids want".|$|E

Comparatively, Julius <b>tempered</b> <b>his</b> harsh <b>criticism</b> {{by claiming that}} Eliot's anti-Semitism does not detract from the poetry and that it offers a creative force showing rare imaginative power to Eliot's art. [...] Literary critic and professor Christopher Ricks agreed, citing the wit and commentary of Eliot's depictions of Jews; he asserts that Eliot was at his most brilliant in his prejudice.|$|R

5000|$|The Buccaneers {{faced the}} Vikings {{in the first}} regular-season game played in the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome The Buccaneers {{outperformed}} the Vikings {{in the early stages}} of the game, but were not able to establish a significant lead. Players reported being surprised by the Vikings' heretofore-unseen emphasis on the running game. McKay singled out the offensive line as performing very poorly, a performance he attributed to a lack of enthusiasm. He stated that guard Sean Farrell played like a rookie, but <b>tempered</b> <b>his</b> <b>criticism</b> by pointing out that Farrell was playing while injured. The constant Viking pass rush required the Buccaneers to resort to quarterback rollout plays. Guard Ray Snell suffered a knee injury that would sideline him for several weeks. Players complained of difficulty breathing due to the lack of adequate air conditioning in the Metrodome. By McKay's count, the team made 12 major errors, ruining their chances against a Vikings team who was also considered not to have played a good game. Citing league rules, McKay would not comment on complaints about the officiating, though others alleged that specifics were that: audibles could not be called due to the crowd noise, Lee Roy Selmon was repeatedly held, and that Hugh Green and Mark Cotney were not guilty of called penalties that extended a Minnesota drive that eventually led to a touchdown. Several Buccaneers protested that Cotney's roughing the kicker penalty was the result of punter Greg Coleman tripping Cotney, and then pretending to have been hit. Coleman was later awarded a mock Oscar by Minnesota newspapers. Opposing coach Bud Grant described the officiating errors as [...] "enough to make a grown man cry". A pair of out-of-bounds calls, including one which negated a Buccaneer fumble recovery, were also considered to be questionable. The Buccaneers attempted a late rally, inspired by the taunting of Vikings quarterback Tommy Kramer, who claimed to have been spit on by Neal Colzie. The team's only touchdown came in the fourth quarter on a Doug Williams pass to Jimmie Giles. A potential game-tying drive ended when Matt Blair tipped a Williams pass that went to Willie Teal for an interception. Williams was intercepted three times in all. It was Tampa Bay's first season-opening loss since 1978. Giles' touchdown was his 20th, which moved him past Ricky Bell to become the Buccaneers' all-time touchdown leader. Williams had a single 12-yard carry that moved him into 4th place all-time in team rushing.|$|E
