50|$|World War II {{temporarily}} stopped this innovation until 1952. By this point, most breweries {{were using}} flat top cans instead. From the 1950s to the 1960s, all beer can were composed from {{three pieces of}} metal. <b>Two-piece</b> <b>cans</b> hit the market in 1974. Throughout the years, innovative ideas and development slowly changed the beer can in{{to what it is}} today. According to Ball Corporation, beer cans weighed 83 grams in 1951, and was then reduced to 38 grams by 1974, to what it is now today at only 21 grams.|$|R
50|$|As the 1970s continued, Metal Box's {{packaging}} subsidiaries faced {{increased competition}} at both home and overseas. The company then opened itself up to further competition when in 1978 it abandoned the licensing deal it had with Continental Can, who would instantly began {{an attempt to}} remain in the market by building a <b>two-piece</b> aluminium <b>can</b> plant in Wales.|$|R

50|$|Coors was {{respected}} {{in the industry}} for his ability in packaging, bottling, and engineering. He is credited with pioneering the recyclable <b>two-piece</b> aluminum <b>can,</b> which is now standard throughout the industry. In the 1950s, Coors requested $250,000 from his father, CEO Adolph Coors, Jr., to build an experimental line of aluminum cans. By the early 1960s, can recycling was viable, and the company offered customers a one-cent deposit on returned cans.|$|R
50|$|In 1959, Coors {{became the}} first American brewer to use an all-aluminum <b>two-piece</b> {{beverage}} <b>can.</b> Also in 1959, the company abandoned pasteurization and began to use sterile filtration to stabilize its beer. Coors currently operates the largest aluminum can producing plant in the world, known as the Rocky Mountain Metal Container (RMMC), in Golden. RMMC is {{a joint venture between}} Ball Metal and Coors, having been founded in 2003.|$|R
50|$|Women wear {{one-piece}} suits {{with different}} backs for competition, though <b>two-piece</b> suits <b>can</b> also be worn. Backs vary mainly in strap thickness and geometric design. Most common styles include: racerback, axel back, corset, diamondback, and butterfly-back/Fly-Back. There are also different style lengths: three-quarter length (reaches the knees), regular length (shoulders to hips), and bikini style (two-piece). Also as of January 1, 2010, in competition, women are only allowed to wear suits {{that do not}} go past the knees or shoulders.|$|R
5000|$|Drawing is a {{forming process}} in which the metal is {{stretched}} over a form or die. [...] In deep drawing the depth of the part being made is more than half its diameter. Deep drawing is used for making automotive fuel tanks, kitchen sinks, <b>two-piece</b> aluminum <b>cans,</b> etc. Deep drawing is generally done in multiple steps called draw reductions. The greater the depth the more reductions are required. Deep drawing may also be accomplished with fewer reductions by heating the workpiece, for example in sink manufacture.|$|R

Options for dates include either a dinner {{out on the town}} or a relaxing day at the beach. An incorrect combination of clothing will force Barbie to skip the date sequence and work her way towards the next objective while a correct combination will allow players to see Barbie and her date in a photograph of the event.|$|R
5000|$|Pattern Is Movement (often stylized as Pattern is Movement) is an American indie {{rock band}} from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that {{established}} in 2001. They have been categorized by some reviewers as a math rock group and compared to {{groups such as}} Don Caballero, Sunny Day Real Estate and Pinback. However, as the band moved from a five piece to a two piece, their sound {{moved away from the}} angular sound of previous records and closer to a more melodic heavy composition structure with sing-a-long choruses. The current <b>two-piece</b> sound <b>can</b> be attributed to influences such as Dirty Projectors, Beirut and Grizzly Bear. In an interview with Baeble Music, Ward coined the band with the term [...] "indie cabaret".|$|R

40|$|Unused {{food and}} {{beverage}} cans were supplied by manufacturers together with two typical samples of press lubricants used to facilitate stamping of can ends. The lubricants were based on mineral hydrocarbon fractions. The cans were of aluminium two-piece construction (two sizes) and tin-plate steel three-piece construction (two sizes) and of four representative types. Gas chromatographic {{analysis was used to}} distinguish the two press lubricants from one another by their n-alkane profiles. Analysis of solvent extracts of the cans indicated that one of the two press lubricants had been used in the manufacture of the three-piece cans and the other lubricant for the <b>two-piece</b> <b>cans.</b> Residual levels of hydrocarbons were between 0. 05 and 1. 1 mg per can. Based on the capacity of the cans and assuming all the mineral hydrocarbon transferred to the contents, maximum levels in foods and beverages could be between 0. 1 and 4. 4 mg/kg. A limited number of retail products were also analysed. For the 35 samples covering 18 retail brands of canned foods and beverages, press lubricants were considered to be present in 50 % of the products at levels ranging from 0. 05 to 1. 0 mg per can, equivalent to 0. 1 to 3. 6 mg/kg of food. Additionally mineral oil of unknown origin was detected in 10 of the retail products at levels of 0. 1 to 4. 7 mg/kg. Analysis of a sparkling apple juice packed in a glass bottle showed mineral oil at 0. 3 mg/kg compared with 0. 7 mg/kg for the same canned product, indicating that although mineral oils may be used in can manufacture they may also be derived {{from other parts of the}} food processing chain. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R
40|$|We study {{scattering}} from potentials {{that rise}} monotonically on one side; this is generally avoided. We report that resonant states are absent in such potentials {{when they are}} smooth and single-piece having less than three real turning points (like {{in the cases of}} Morse oscillator, exponential and linear potentials). But when these potentials are made <b>two-piece,</b> resonances <b>can</b> occur. We further show that rising potentials next to a well/step/barrier are rich models of multiple resonances (Gamow's decaying states) in one- dimension. We use linear, parabolic and exponential profiles as rising part and find complex-energy poles, E_n=E_n-iΓ_n/ 2 (Γ_n > 0), in the reflection amplitude (s-matrix). The appearance of peaks in Wigner's (reflection) time-delay at E=ϵ_n (close to E_n) and spatial catastrophe in the eigenfunction confirm the existence of resonances and meta-stable states in these systems.

40|$|This {{summarizing}} report {{discusses the}} materials and application prospects for higher purity in steels, which will make possible further advances in materials behaviour and workability. Improvements in purity and homogeneity permit in particular more rational production of thin foils and wire, one-piece shaping of complicated bodywork components and the drawing, wall-ironing and flanging of <b>two-piece</b> beverage <b>cans.</b> Welded designs in plant and mechanical engineering can be fabricated with less effort and less weight. Difficult component geometries and shaping processes can be more easily mastered. Steels with optimized fracture toughness can be exposed to more extreme loads at even lower temperatures : applications worthy of mention include offshore engineering and large-diameter linepipes for use in arctic regions and at great underwater depths. Liquefied-gas transport vessels can be made more resistant to brittle rupture. The bending fatigue strength and service-life of valve-spring and rolling-bearing steels can be significantly increased. High-purity surfaces on piston rods and cylinders guarantee reliability in hydraulic systems, and high-purity calendering rolls permit defect-free embossing of paper surfaces...|$|R

40|$|Mesh {{generation}} and adjustment methods {{for creating a}} halftone image on a deep-drawn cap Yih-Ping Huang and Jeng-Wen Lin It is desirable for deep-drawn bottle caps to have counterfeit-proof characteristics {{in addition to a}} delicate figurative design. This article presents mesh {{generation and}} adjustment methods to produce a delicate halftone image on a deep-drawn cap, so as to create a counterfeit-proof seal that solves the problem of the occurrence fake products in the cap industry. Because cap images are very sensitive, any defects in the image processing are easily noticeable to the naked eye. An image generation process used for drawn and redrawn <b>two-piece</b> food <b>cans</b> is introduced that creates a distorted image for printing onto a plane blank metal sheet. Along with the can formation and drawing process, the printed distorted image is deformed in order to result in the desired finished form. Using a similar but relatively difficult technique, the process for creating an image on a deep-drawn cap is discussed, whereby the mesh generation methods and the associated adjustment techniques are utilized. A benchmark is provided to verify the applicability of this study and to demonstrate that the proposed methods can achieve the required aesthetic and counterfeit-proof purposes...|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, one Marx product line showed a greater sophistication in toy offerings. The [...] "Fix All" [...] series was introduced, whose main {{attraction}} was larger plastic vehicles (about 14 inches long) {{that could be}} taken apart and put back together with included tools and equipment. A 1953 Pontiac convertible (erroneously identified on packaging as a sedan), and a 1953 Mercury Monterey station wagon which featured an articulated drive-line. Everything from the pistons to the crankshaft to the rear axle gears were visible through clear plastic, and wood-trim decals for the sides finished off this marvelous model. A very large 1953 Chrysler convertible, a 1953 Jaguar XK120 roadster, a WWII-era Willys Jeep, a Dodge-ish utility truck, a tow truck, a tractor, a larger scale motorcycle, a helicopter, {{and a couple of}} airplanes were all part of the Fix All series. The cars' boxes boasted features like [...] "Over 50 parts" [...] and [...] "For a real mechanic!" [...] As an example, the tow truck came with cast metal box and open wrenches, an adjustable end wrench, a <b>two-piece</b> jack, gas <b>can,</b> hammer, screwdriver, and fire extinguisher. The Jeep came with a star wrench, a screw jack and working lights.|$|R
