5|$|The Norwegian <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Administration</b> {{established}} a coast radio station, Svalbard Radio, at Finneset in 1911, which {{was moved to}} Longyearbyen in 1930. The town's tourist industry started in 1935, when SS Lyngen started calling regularly during the summer season. In 1937, SNSK established Sverdrupbyen to house workers for Mine 1b and operation of the mine started in 1939. In 1938, Longyearbyen's first road was completed, between the town center and Sverdrupbyen. Operations at Mine 2b, a different entrance to Mine 2a, started in 1939.|$|E
5|$|The {{air traffic}} control at Værnes was {{established}} in 1946, after the air force had sent personnel to the United Kingdom for training. The <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Administration</b> took over {{the responsibility for the}} radio installations, and the responsibility for the meteorological services became the responsibility of the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. Trondheim Air Traffic Control Center was also established to monitor all air space over Central Norway. In 1955, a glass dome was built on top of the control tower, giving a much better view of the air field.|$|E
5|$|The {{facility}} had a Simulation for Automatic Machinery computer {{built by}} FFI which allowed for real-time operations with the data. Telecommunications systems were {{operated by the}} Norwegian <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Administration,</b> which established a two-way radio station at Ny-Ålesund. Communication from the satellites was relayed by radio to Ski and onwards with a leased line to the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany. Return information was relayed via a radio station at Jeløy. Magnetic tapes were sent to Darmstadt every other week, first via aircraft to Longyearbyen and then onwards to Germany. NTNF hired a nurse and had the Amundsen House refitted as a clinic {{for the duration of}} the telemetry station's operation.|$|E

5|$|For NTNF, the {{establishment}} brought by an organizational change. While it had previously also conducted space research, {{the operations of}} installations had been placed with FFI. As FFI was {{a branch of the}} military, this structure could not be used in Svalbard. Thus NTNF had to organize an operative branch for the ground station. The responsibility for operating the telecommunications facilities was awarded to the Norwegian <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Administration.</b> The ground station needed a computer. FFI offered to deliver a Simulation for Automatic Machinery, while the alternative was to purchase a PDP-8 computer from Digital Equipment Corporation. As NTNF was responsible for the country's technological development, they chose to award the contract to FFI on the condition that they pay for a PDP-8 if they were not able to deliver a computer themselves.|$|E
25|$|The {{establishment}} of relayed VHF stations proved {{the reliability of}} unmanned stations, and the <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Administration</b> started a process to unman the least trafficked coast radio stations. Proposals of remote controlling stations often resulted in a heated local debate, in part caused by the press claiming that the stations would be closed instead of simply moving the employees. One {{of the advantages of}} remote controlling was that instead of having one person on duty, there would be two, of which one person would be a dedicated emergency transmission listener and one would handle other correspondence. In smaller stations there was only one employee for both tasks. An often-used argument against unmanning was that the operators had local knowledge. Operators were often {{from other parts of the}} country and typically did not have sufficient local knowledge for their section of the coastline for it to make a difference. Search and rescue operations would always be coordinated by the police and not the coast station.|$|E
25|$|The {{addition}} of regional offices {{and resulted in}} the microwave radio relay being upgraded in the 1970s. The <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Administration</b> insisted on continuing using analog transmission, while NRK instead wanted to implement a digital transmission. NRK got its way, and a transistor-based system with a capacity corresponding to 960 telephone lines was installed. The resulting system had two radio channels, one for transmitting radio from Oslo to the regional offices and one for transmission between the regional offices. The FM transmitters were fed their programs from the regional offices. The system had a two-way television channel, which could feed the television programs to the transmitters and allow for transfer of program content from the regional offices to Oslo. The sound transfer system had four 2-megabit channels; the one was used for 30 telephone lines {{and the other was}} used for 5 program channels. These had a sampling rate of 32kHz and a 14-bit bit rate, which was reduced to 11 through compression. No other available systems could produce this quality of audio.|$|E

500|$|Planning {{started in}} 1966 and {{construction}} commenced the following year. Brønnøysund Airport cost NOK2.7 million plus costs for expropriation and navigational aids. NOK1.9 million {{was covered by}} the state, while the rest was covered by Brønnøy Municipality. The runway was originally [...] and was the only asphalted area in Brønnøysund. The airport was originally operated by the municipality, except the tower, which was operated by the Norwegian <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Administration.</b> Brønnøysund was one of very few regional airport to receive a restaurant. The airport opened on 30 May 1968, along with Mo i Rana Airport, Røssvoll, Namsos Airport, Høknesøra and Sandnessjøen Airport, Stokka. Widerøe commenced flights to Bodø and Trondheim with their de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters the following day.|$|E
500|$|The {{domain name}} {{registry}} responsibility for [...] was in 1983 awarded to Pål Spilling at the Norwegian Telecommunications Administration's Research Institute. The actual registration work {{was carried out by}} Jens Thomassen. The first registered domains were [...] (the Norwegian <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Administration)</b> and [...] (the Department of Informatics at the University of Oslo). Initially the workload of domain registration was light, but after a few years the workload had become unmanageable as a side project for an individual. Policy-makers also indicated a need for the domain registration to be managed by a non-commercial organization. The responsibility was therefore transferred to the publicly owned Uninett, a supplier of information and communications technology to Norwegian public universities, colleges and research institutions on 17 March 1987. The oldest archived zone file dates from 1989 and includes 19 domains. In 1991 and 1992, all state university colleges were connected to the Internet and issued domain names, causing a boom of registrations. The 1000th domain was registered in 1995.|$|E
