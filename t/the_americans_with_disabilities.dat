5|$|Among {{the first}} pieces of {{legislation}} passed by the new Congress under Gingrich was the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, which subjected members of Congress to the same laws that apply to businesses and their employees, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>with</b> <b>Disabilities</b> Act of 1990. As a provision of the Contract with America, the law was symbolic of the new Republican majority's goal to {{remove some of the}} entitlements enjoyed by Congress. The bill received near universal acceptance from the House and Senate and was signed into law on January 23, 1995.|$|E

City officials hoped to maintain {{the character of the}} original structure despite changes and upgrades. The total cost for renovations as of opening were $2.4 million, with the city paying for 60% of those costs. Some financing for the center came from selling bricks to the public that were then used on exterior spaces.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>with</b> <b>Disabilities</b> Act of 1990 {{mandated}} that all new construction on transit stations including making the stations handicapped accessible. Because the 1885 depot {{is very close}} to the tracks, such upgrades at the old station location would have been difficult. New platforms, with mini-high platforms on their west ends for level boarding, were built just west of the former station. A footbridge with two elevators was built to allow passengers to reach the outbound platform without crossing the tracks, which carry slow-moving CSX freight service as well as MBTA and Amtrak trains. The new station was built in 2000 and opened in early 2001.|$|E
5|$|When {{started in}} 1990, Shore Line East was {{intended}} to be a temporary service. Except at Old Saybrook and New Haven, which were already served by Amtrak, the state constructed new stations – consisting of little more than bare wooden decks – for minimal cost. Since the service was started two months before <b>the</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>with</b> <b>Disabilities</b> Act was signed, the platforms were not built to be handicapped accessible. After a decade of service, with Shore Line East established as part of Connecticut's transportation system, the state began to upgrade the service. The basic stations have been rebuilt with high-level platforms to provide handicapped access and level boarding, parking lots have been expanded, and more trains {{have been added to the}} schedule.|$|E
5|$|From the {{introduction}} of Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) funding in 1965 until the mid-2000s, Wedgemere station remained essentially static. <b>The</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>with</b> <b>Disabilities</b> Act of 1990 required transit agencies to make certain stations handicapped accessible. A number of high-ridership stations on the MBTA Commuter Rail system were upgraded, but due to its relatively low ridership — less than 600 riders per day as of 2009 — Wedgemere was not chosen as a key station for upgrades. Wedgemere had older low-level platforms, and access from the street was via stairs only. Beginning in 2008, a local family lobbied the MBTA to make the station accessible; in July 2009, the Federal Transit Administration granted the MBTA permission to build mini-high platforms. (Full-length high level platforms {{would not have been}} possible because the Lowell Line is a designated freight corridor; full-length platforms cause operational difficulties with freight trains. Wedgemere does not have room for a dedicated freight passing track like Anderson RTC.) In February 2010, the MBTA announced that $2 million in federal stimulus funds had been allotted to the project, part of a grant that also funded construction of the John W. Olver Transit Center and repairs to the Red Line tunnels between Harvard and Alewife. The work was then intended to be finished by the end of 2010.|$|E
