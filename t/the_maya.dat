5|$|Bone, {{both human}} and animal, was also sculpted; human bones may have been trophies, or relics of ancestors. <b>The</b> <b>Maya</b> valued Spondylus shells, and worked them to remove the white {{exterior}} and spines, to reveal the fine orange interior. Around the 10th century AD, metallurgy arrived in Mesoamerica from South America, and <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> began to make small objects in gold, silver and copper. <b>The</b> <b>Maya</b> generally hammered sheet metal into objects such as beads, bells, and discs.

5|$|As {{with any}} non-repeating calendar, <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> {{measured}} time from a fixed start point. <b>The</b> <b>Maya</b> set {{the beginning of}} their calendar as the end of a previous cycle of bak'tuns, equivalent to a day in 3114 BC. This was believed by <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> to be the day of the creation of the world in its current form. <b>The</b> <b>Maya</b> used the Long Count Calendar to fix any given day of the Calendar Round within their current great Piktun cycle consisting of either 20 bak'tuns. There was some variation in the calendar, specifically texts in Palenque demonstrate that the piktun cycle that ended in 3114 BC had only 13 bak'tuns, and other inscriptions seem to have used an exceptional cycle of 13 + 20 bak'tun in the current piktun. Additionally, there may have been some regional variation in how these exceptional cycles were managed.|$|E
5|$|Dynastic rulership {{among the}} lowland Maya is most deeply rooted at Tikal. According to later hieroglyphic records, the dynasty {{was founded by}} Yax Ehb Xook, perhaps in the 1st century AD.

5|$|Maya art is {{essentially}} {{the art of the}} royal court. It is almost exclusively concerned with <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> elite and their world. Maya art was crafted from both perishable and non-perishable materials, and served to link <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> to their ancestors. Although surviving Maya art represents only a small proportion of the art that <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> created, it represents a wider variety of subjects than any other art tradition in the Americas. Maya art has many regional styles, and is unique in the ancient Americas in bearing narrative text. The finest surviving Maya art dates to the Late Classic period.|$|E
5|$|Maya cities {{tended to}} expand haphazardly, {{and the city}} centre would be {{occupied}} by ceremonial and administrative complexes, surrounded by an irregular sprawl of residential districts. Different parts of a city would often be linked by causeways. The principal architecture of the city consisted of palaces, pyramid-temples, ceremonial ballcourts, and structures aligned for astronomical observation. <b>The</b> <b>Maya</b> elite were literate, and developed a complex system of hieroglyphic writing {{that was the most}} advanced in the pre-Columbian Americas. <b>The</b> <b>Maya</b> recorded their history and ritual knowledge in screenfold books, of which only three uncontested examples remain, the rest having been destroyed by the Spanish. There are also a great many examples of Maya text found on stelae and ceramics. <b>The</b> <b>Maya</b> developed a highly complex series of interlocking ritual calendars, and employed mathematics that included one of the earliest instances of the explicit zero in the world. As a part of their religion, <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> practised human sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|Maya stelae (singular stela) are monuments {{that were}} {{fashioned}} by <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> civilization of ancient Mesoamerica. They consist of tall, sculpted stone shafts {{and are often}} associated with low circular stones referred to as altars, although their actual function is uncertain. Many stelae were sculpted in low relief, although plain monuments are found throughout <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> region. The sculpting of these monuments spread throughout <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> area during the Classic Period (250–900 AD), and these pairings of sculpted stelae and circular altars are considered a hallmark of Classic Maya civilization. The earliest dated stela to {{have been found in}} situ in <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> lowlands was recovered from the great city of Tikal in Guatemala. During the Classic Period almost every Maya kingdom in the southern lowlands raised stelae in its ceremonial centre.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Maya</b> calendrical system, {{in common}} with other Mesoamerican calendars, had its origins in the Preclassic period. However, it was <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> that {{developed}} the calendar to its maximum sophistication, recording lunar and solar cycles, eclipses and movements of planets with great accuracy. In some cases, <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> calculations were more accurate than equivalent calculations in the Old World; for example, <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> solar year was calculated to greater accuracy than the Julian year. <b>The</b> <b>Maya</b> calendar was intrinsically tied to Maya ritual, and it was central to Maya religious practices. The calendar combined a non-repeating Long Count with three interlocking cycles, each measuring a progressively larger period. These were the 260-day tzolk'in, the 365-day haab', and the 52-year Calendar Round, resulting from {{the combination of the}} tzolk'in with the haab. There were also additional calendric cycles, such as an 819-day cycle associated with the four quadrants of Maya cosmology, governed by four different aspects of the god K'awiil.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Maya</b> {{engaged in}} long {{distance}} trade across <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> region, and across greater Mesoamerica and beyond. Within Mesoamerica beyond <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> area, trade routes particularly focused on central Mexico and the Gulf coast. In the Early Classic, Chichen Itza {{was at the}} hub of an extensive trade network that imported gold discs from Colombia and Panama, and turquoise from Los Cerrillos, New Mexico. Long distance trade of both luxury and utilitarian goods was probably controlled by the royal family. Prestige goods obtained by trade were used both for consumption by the city's ruler, and as luxury gifts to consolidate the loyalty of vassals and allies. An Early Classic Maya merchant quarter has been identified at the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan, in central Mexico.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Maya</b> leader {{returned}} {{the following day}} with twelve canoes, as promised. The Spanish could see from afar that the shore was packed with natives. The conquistadors put ashore in the brigantine and the ships' boats; {{a few of the}} more daring Spaniards boarded the native canoes. The Spanish named the headland Cape Catoche, after some words spoken by <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> leader, which sounded to the Spanish like cones catoche. Once ashore, the Spaniards clustered loosely together and advanced towards the city along a path among low, scrub-covered hillocks. At this point <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> leader gave a shout and the Spanish party was ambushed by Maya warriors armed with spears, bows and arrows, and stones. Thirteen Spaniards were injured by arrows in the first assault, but the conquistadors regrouped and repulsed <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> attack. They advanced to a small plaza bordered by temples upon the outskirts of the city. When the Spaniards ransacked the temples they found a number of low-grade gold items, which filled them with enthusiasm. The expedition captured two Mayas to be used as interpreters and retreated to the ships. Over the following days the Spanish discovered that although <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> arrows had struck with little force, the flint arrowheads tended to shatter on impact, causing infected wounds and a slow death; two of the wounded Spaniards died from the arrow-wounds inflicted in the ambush.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Maya</b> {{world was}} {{populated}} {{by a great}} variety of deities, supernatural entities and sacred forces. <b>The</b> <b>Maya</b> had such a broad interpretation of what was sacred that identifying distinct deities with specific functions is inaccurate. <b>The</b> <b>Maya</b> interpretation of deities was intrinsically tied to the calendar, astronomy, and their cosmovision. The importance of a deity, its characteristics, and its associations varied according to the movement of celestial bodies. The priestly interpretation of astronomical records and books was therefore crucial, since the priest would understand which deity required ritual propitiation, when the correct ceremonies should be performed, and what would be an appropriate offering. Each deity had four manifestations, associated with the cardinal directions, each identified with a different colour. They also had a dual day-night/life-death aspect.|$|E
25|$|Mayanism {{has gained}} renewed vigor due to pseudoscientific nonfiction by authors such as Erich von Däniken, Zecharia Sitchin, and Graham Hancock, whose {{theories}} range from invoking ancient astronauts and other extraterrestrials {{from outer space}} to revivals {{of the idea that}} ancient peoples from lost lands brought wisdom and technology to <b>the</b> <b>Mayas.</b> <b>The</b> implication of this is that <b>the</b> <b>Mayas</b> had access to aspects of ancient knowledge, spiritualism, philosophy, and religion that are useful for coping with the modern world, whether by avoiding Armageddon, embracing a mystical Apocalypse, or constructing a future Utopia.|$|R

5|$|The {{agents of}} the Catholic Church wrote {{detailed}} accounts of <b>the</b> <b>Maya,</b> in support of their efforts at evangelization, and absorption of <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> into the Spanish Empire. This was followed by various Spanish priests and colonial officials who left descriptions of ruins they visited in Yucatán and Central America. In 1839, American traveller and writer John Lloyd Stephens set out to visit a number of Maya sites with English architect and draftsman Frederick Catherwood. Their illustrated accounts of the ruins sparked strong popular interest, and brought <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> {{to the attention of}} the world. The later 19th century saw the recording and recovery of ethnohistoric accounts of <b>the</b> <b>Maya,</b> and the first steps in deciphering Maya hieroglyphs.|$|E
5|$|The {{final two}} decades of the 19th century saw the birth of modern {{scientific}} archaeology in <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> region, with the meticulous work of Alfred Maudslay and Teoberto Maler. By the early 20th century, the Peabody Museum was sponsoring excavations at Copán and in the Yucatán Peninsula. In the first {{two decades of}} the 20th century, advances were made in deciphering <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> calendar, and identifying deities, dates, and religious concepts. Since the 1930s, archaeological exploration increased dramatically, with large-scale excavations across <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> region.|$|E
5|$|The {{territory}} of <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> covered {{a third of}} Mesoamerica, and <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> {{were engaged in a}} dynamic relationship with neighbouring cultures that included the Olmecs, Mixtecs, Teotihuacan, the Aztecs, and others. During the Early Classic period, <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> cities of Tikal and Kaminaljuyu were key Maya foci in a network that extended beyond <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> area into the highlands of central Mexico. At around the same time, there was a strong Maya presence at the Tetitla compound of Teotihuacan. Centuries later, during the 9th century AD, murals at Cacaxtla, another site in the central Mexican highlands, were painted in a Maya style. This may have been either an effort to align itself with the still-powerful Maya area after the collapse of Teotihuacan and ensuing political fragmentation in the Mexican Highlands, or an attempt to express a distant Maya origin of the inhabitants. <b>The</b> <b>Maya</b> city of Chichen Itza and the distant Toltec capital of Tula had an especially close relationship.|$|E

5|$|A single soldier {{arriving}} in Mexico in 1520 was carrying smallpox and initiated the devastating plagues that {{swept through the}} native populations of the Americas. Modern estimates of native population decline vary from 75% to 90% mortality. Maya written histories suggest that smallpox was rapidly transmitted throughout <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> area {{the same year that}} it arrived in central Mexico. Among the most deadly diseases were the aforementioned smallpox, influenza, measles and a number of pulmonary diseases, including tuberculosis. Modern knowledge of the impact of these diseases on populations with no prior exposure suggests that 33–50% of the population of <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> highlands perished.|$|E
5|$|Although much reduced, a {{significant}} Maya presence remained into the Postclassic period after {{the abandonment of}} the major Classic period cities; the population was particularly concentrated near permanent water sources. Unlike during previous cycles of contraction in <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> region, abandoned lands were not quickly resettled in the Postclassic. Activity shifted to the northern lowlands and <b>the</b> <b>Maya</b> Highlands; this may have involved migration from the southern lowlands, because many Postclassic Maya groups had migration myths. Chichen Itza and its Puuc neighbours declined dramatically in the 11th century, and this may represent the final episode of Classic Period collapse.
