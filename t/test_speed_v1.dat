40|$|The {{fracture}} {{behavior of}} polycarbonate was studied {{as a function}} of temperature (- 80 °C to + 80 °C) and <b>test</b> <b>speed</b> (10 - 5 to 10 m/s) using an instrumented, singleedged, notched tensile test (SENT). SENT tests give information on the fracture stress, fracture displacements, and fracture energies of polycarbonate, and from these data the average crack speeds were calculated and the brittle-ductile transitions were determined. The fracture stress and the fracture energies of ductile fracturing samples increased with increasing <b>test</b> <b>speed.</b> The fracture surfaces were studied by scanning electron analysis, and sometimes a mixed mode fracture, part ductile and part brittle, could be seen.

25|$|A turbine-powered aircraft's takeoff {{procedure}} is designed around ensuring that an engine failure will not endanger the flight. This {{is done by}} planning the takeoff around three critical V <b>speeds,</b> <b>V1,</b> VR and V2. V1 is the critical engine failure recognition speed, {{the speed at which}} a takeoff can be continued with an engine failure, and the speed at which stopping distance is no longer guaranteed {{in the event of a}} rejected takeoff. VR is the speed at which the nose is lifted off the runway, a process known as rotation. V2 is the single-engine safety speed, the single engine climb speed. The use of these speeds ensure that either sufficient thrust to continue the takeoff, or sufficient stopping distance to reject it will be available at all times.|$|R
