For example, because the information is not currently readily available, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) directed the 49 agencies that were required to submit inventories to defer the collection of three statutorily required data elements for each contract [...] the role the services played in achieving agency objectives, the <b>total</b> dollar <b>amount</b> <b>invoiced</b> for services under the contracts, and the number and work locations of contractor and subcontractor personnel. Progress, however, is being made to collect this information for future inventories. OMB directed agencies to start collecting information on the role services play in achieving agency objectives for new contracts awarded on or after March 1, 2012. A proposed Federal Acquisition Regulation rule was published in April 2011 to start collecting the remaining two data elements directly from contractors. We also found several instances where agencies significantly underreported obligations in their inventories, either because they misinterpreted or did not follow OMB guidance. For example, the General Services Administration underreported obligations by approximately $ 6. 4 billion. Without complete and accurate service contract inventories, OMB and Congress cannot meaningfully compare service contract obligations among agencies, or develop spending trends for agencies, thus limiting the overall utility of the inventories. ...|$|R

There were significant differences in the <b>total</b> <b>amounts</b> of K, Si and soluble sugars in culms and leaf sheaths among the tested rice varieties. The difference in the <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of Si was greater than that of K or soluble sugars. The physical strength and maximum bearing capacity of culm continuously decreased from heading to ripening, with a rapid decrease at the dough stage. However, the contents and <b>total</b> <b>amounts</b> of K and Si in culms and the Si content in leaf sheaths gradually increased and an accumulation of K and Si in culms was exhibited, whereas the content and <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of K and the <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of Si in leaf sheaths gradually decreased and an exportation of K and Si in leaf sheaths was presented. The physical strength was positively and significantly correlated with the <b>total</b> <b>amounts</b> of K and Si in culms during grain filling except that at the heading stage, the <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of soluble sugars in culms at the heading and milky stages, the <b>total</b> <b>amounts</b> of Si and soluble sugars in leaf sheaths at the heading stage, the <b>total</b> <b>amount</b> of K in leaf sheaths at the heading and milky stages, and the maximum bearing capacity during grain filling.
