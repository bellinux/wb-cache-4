"And so, sir, in the lonelier {{and perhaps}} even more disheartening moments which come to any {{national}} leader, I hope {{there will be a}} corner of your mind and heart which takes cheer from <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> an admiring friend, a staunch friend that will be all the way with LBJ." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 1966, new Prime Minister Harold Holt {{expressed}} his government's {{support for the}} US {{and its role in}} Vietnam in particular. [...] "I don't know where people would choose to look for the security of this country {{were it not for the}} friendship and strength of the United States." [...] While on a visit in the same year to the US, Holt assured President Lyndon B. Johnson [...] "...I hope there is corner of your mind and heart which takes cheer from <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> an admiring friend, a staunch friend, [...] that will be all the way with LBJ." ...|$|E
60|$|PATRICIA. I mean to {{draw your}} {{attention}} to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> recently made an offer, I accept it.|$|E
5000|$|Peter Lord commented, [...] "With Pirates!, I {{must say}} that the new {{technology}} has made Pirates! really liberating to make, easy to make because <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can shoot a lot of green screen stuff, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can easily extend the sets with CG, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can put <b>the</b> sea in there and a beautiful wooden boat that, frankly, would never sail in a million years, <b>you</b> can take <b>that</b> {{and put it into}} a beautiful CG scene and believe it." ...|$|R
50|$|Position One: To deny <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are a victim.|$|R
5000|$|Stutter {{openly and}} {{do not try to}} hide <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are a stutterer.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{come here}} and stand in Cynthia's way. You trade on <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> known us all this time to monopolize her attention. You spoil her chances. You--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Larry quietly, [...] "she will be Mrs. Grant to-morrow if {{you will}} lend me a horse and not mention <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> seen us when Torrance's boys come round. Where is your father?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle Dick, why don't you {{pretend to}} be terribly put out over <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> lost your {{interest}} in the claim?" [...] cried Andy. [...] "That will throw them completely off the track. Let them imagine that {{you think there is}} a lot of oil to be found there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly! The {{thing which}} appeals to {{our sense of}} humour is <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> and la petite Pellissier were dining together." ...|$|R
50|$|Position Three: To {{acknowledge}} <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are {{a victim}} but {{to refuse to}} accept {{the assumption that the}} role is inevitable.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mon ami, {{have you}} ever, when writing a letter, been arrested by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{did not know}} how to spell a certain word?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O Charlie! how can {{you talk}} of it?" [...] said Mrs Brooke, with a distressed look. [...] "I have {{scarcely}} had time to realise <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> come home, and to thank God for it, {{when you begin to}} talk of leaving me again--perhaps for years, as before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is not {{my belief}} in their reports," [...] replied Mr Durant, [...] "that creates {{suspicion}} in me, but I couple these reports with <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> again and again deceived me {{in regard to the}} repayment of the loans which you have already received at various times from me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course!" [...] said Mrs. Devine, with {{a little}} smile. [...] "Still, I really don't think you need be so anxious to hide <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> taken some pains to provide these little dainties for us. It would have been {{apparent}} in any case. We know how men live in the bush." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] he said, [...] "if there's {{anything}} {{significant in}} <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> gave me <b>that</b> reason last. He failed {{you in some}} way?" ...|$|R
50|$|SIA: Given <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> exist, {{you should}} (other things equal) favor {{hypotheses}} {{according to which}} many observers exist over hypotheses on which few observers exist.|$|R
50|$|Their {{library is}} {{available}} at any time, especially for pensioners and students. It must be mentioned <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> must need a membership to visit it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, no, your majesty," [...] {{replied the}} old servitor; [...] "it but makes {{assurance}} doubly sure as to your true identity, for <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not the ring is positive proof {{that you are}} king {{and that they have}} sought to hide the fact by removing the insignia of your divine right to rule in Lutha." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'There is one thing, Margaret. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> somehow {{felt when}} I {{was in trouble}} should cheer you, when I am away, for if mere danger should so affect you, surely you will know should death befall me; {{and as long as}} you do not feel that, you may be sure that I shall return safe and sound to you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|St. John {{caught at}} the hope which {{the form of}} words suggested. [...] "If {{anything}} can bring it up, it will be <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> bought it. Such a thing would give the lie to that ridiculous story, as nothing else could. Every one will see that a house can't be very badly haunted, if the man that the ghost appeared to is willing to buy it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have no wish," [...] he said, [...] "to {{altogether}} ignore <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are my wife's sister, {{and have}} therefore a certain claim upon me." ...|$|R
50|$|Position Two: To {{acknowledge}} <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are {{a victim}} (but attribute it to {{a powerful force}} beyond human control such as fate, history, God, or biology.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{but there}} is a difference." [...] Don Diego sat up to argue the matter. [...] "It lies in <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> boast {{yourself}} a humane man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have quite}} made up your mind, then, {{to put the}} Tredowen {{property}} on the market," [...] he remarked. [...] "You will excuse my reminding you of <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> large accumulated funds in hand, and nearly a hundred thousand pounds worth of easily realizable securities. Tredowen has been in your mother's family for a good many years, and I should doubt {{whether it will be}} easily disposed of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are a queer man, Mr. Merrick," [...] he said, quietly. [...] "I {{can only}} excuse your insults {{on the grounds}} of ignorance, or <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been misinformed. Here is the {{newspaper}} report of the Almaquo fire, which I showed my friends the night of Captain Wegg's sudden death." [...] He took a clipping from a drawer of the desk and handed it to Uncle John, who read it carefully.|$|E
6000|$|... "These we will peruse and {{consider}} at our leisure," [...] the queen said, [...] "and I shall, I hope, {{see you at}} my levee this evening. In the meantime I {{thank you for your}} service in having brought the despatches so speedily here, and am well aware that <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been chosen as the messengers of the commander-in-chief is in itself a proof that your share in the battle was in the highest degree honourable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know. But <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> signed such a contract, under compulsion, {{would not}} prevent the court from {{awarding}} damages, if you sustained them while on duty." ...|$|R
40|$|Suppose {{you intend}} now to φ at some future time t. However, when t has {{come you do}} not φ. Something has gone wrong. This failing {{is not just a}} causal but also a {{normative}} failing. This raises the question how to characterize this failing. I discuss three alternative views. On the first view, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> do not execute your intention to φ is blameworthy only if the balance of reasons pointed to φ-ing. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> intended to u does not add to the reasons for φ-ing at t. On the second view, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> do not execute your intention to φ is blameworthy because you violate a requirement of rationality. Both these views have in common that they deny that intending to φ at t creates a reason to φ at t. The third alternative, the one I defend, claims <b>that</b> <b>you</b> often create reasons to φ by intending to φ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes"--and Leland made {{a little}} gesture--"I think it would with you. Still, <b>you</b> see, <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> made <b>that</b> promise was in one way an {{astonishing}} thing to me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “This must be taken, señor,” {{the officer}} said, “to relieve you from any {{suspicion}} of having come {{here from the}} insurgent provinces. At {{the same time there}} remains <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> entered Brazil without passports or other necessary papers, a matter which will have to be considered by the authorities. At the same time, pending their decision there will be no occasion for you to confine yourself to the hotel, as the offence can hardly be considered a very serious one.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I know,' {{continued}} Knight, with an indescribable drag of {{manner and}} intonation,--'I know I am absurdly scrupulous about you--that I want you too exclusively mine. In your past before you knew me--from your very cradle--I {{wanted to think}} you had been mine. I would make you mine by main force. Elfride,' he went on vehemently, 'I can't help this jealousy over you! It is my nature, and must be so, and I HATE <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been caressed before: yes hate it!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Although you may {{continue}} to insist that you are to blame, this does not alter <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> saved our lives. Is there any way in which I can be useful to you? Are you discontent with your state? For, in truth, you look as if Nature had intended you for a gallant soldier rather than a city craftsman. Earl Talbot, who is my uncle, would, I am sure, receive you into his following should you so choose it, and I would gladly pay for the cancelling of your indentures." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{congratulate you}} on your escape. The Portuguese are not very particular, and might, as likely as not, have paid small regard to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were in uniform." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{makes you}} so careless, Bob? Even if they did hear you when you fell, {{there is no reason}} why <b>you</b> should {{advertise}} <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are making cartridges." ...|$|R
5000|$|But... if {{you spend}} your life {{mourning}} <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> didn't get to Italy, you may never be free to enjoy the very special, the very lovely things ... about Holland.|$|R
