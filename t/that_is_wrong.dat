He argued for representing truth in language, and honesty was of paramount importance. Even in facial expression, truth must always be represented. Confucius believed that if a ruler is to lead correctly, by action, that orders would be unnecessary in that others will follow the proper actions of their ruler. In discussing {{the relationship between a}} king and his subject (or a father and his son), he underlined the need to give due respect to superiors.

500|$|Malicious rumours {{concerning}} Wenger's {{private life}} surfaced during November 1996, {{to the extent}} the City of London reported that his exit from Arsenal was imminent. Having returned {{from a trip to}} Strasbourg to visit his parents, Wenger attended a press meeting and strongly refuted the claims: [...] "If something comes out <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong,</b> I will attack. It is a serious matter if you can just create things that are not right." [...] Arsenal's press officer Clare Tomlinson, who was present at the news conference, recalled Wenger phoning the next day and demanding why he could not take action against the press for printing the story. The culprit responsible for spreading gossip in the City later apologised to Wenger. During this, Arsenal had led the Premier League, but poor form in February 1997 caused Wenger to rule out his team's chances of winning the title. They finished third in his first season, missing out on UEFA Champions League qualification to Newcastle United on goal difference – the tiebreaker used to determine the ranking between teams equal on points.|$|E

2500|$|Weather, {{inspired}} by her experiences on Iceland, has {{played an important}} role in Roni Horn's work. She has created several public artworks, including You Are the Weather—Munich (1996–97), a permanent installation for the Deutscher Wetterdienst bureau in Munich. You in You (1997), a rubber-tiled walkway in Basel’s east train station, mimics an unusual basalt formation of Iceland. Some Thames (2000), a permanent installation at the University of Akureyri in Iceland, consists of 80 photographs of water dispersed throughout the university’s public spaces, echoing the ebb and flow of students and learning over time at the university. In 2007 she undertook Artangel’s first international commission, creating Vatnasafn / Library of Water, a long-term installation in the town of Stykkishólmur, Iceland. The installation is made up of water collected from Icelandic glaciers. [...] “Weather,” observes Roni Horn, “is the key paradox of our time. Weather that is nice is often weather <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong.</b> The nice is occurring in the immediate and individual, and the wrong is occurring systemwide.” ...|$|E

[...] On the subject, he said, [...] "I just feel that the reason of going in {{for weapons of mass}} destruction, the ability of the Iraqis to make a nuclear weapon, that's all been proven that it was never there." [...] He added that his change of opinion came about from {{attending}} the funeral of a sergeant killed in Iraq, when his last letter to his family was being read out. On June 16, 2005, he joined with three other members of Congress (Neil Abercrombie, Dennis Kucinich and Ron Paul) in introducing a resolution calling for the start of a withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq to begin by October 2006. Jones covered the hallway outside his office with photographs of soldiers who had died in Iraq.

2500|$|Munch also {{received}} his father's ire for {{his relationship with}} Hans Jæger, the local nihilist who lived by the code [...] "a passion to destroy is also a creative passion" [...] and who advocated suicide as the ultimate way to freedom. Munch came under his malevolent, anti-establishment spell. [...] "My ideas developed {{under the influence of}} the bohemians or rather under Hans Jæger. Many people have mistakenly claimed that my ideas were formed under the influence of Strindberg and the Germans…but <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong.</b> They had already been formed by then." [...] At that time, contrary to many of the other bohemians, Munch was still respectful of women, as well as reserved and well-mannered, but he began to give in to the binge drinking and brawling of his circle. He was unsettled by the sexual revolution going on at the time and by the independent women around him. He later turned cynical concerning sexual matters, expressed not only in his behavior and his art, but in his writings as well, an example being a long poem called The City of Free Love. Still dependent on his family for many of his meals, Munch's relationship with his father remained tense over concerns about his bohemian life.|$|E
2500|$|Later in {{the same}} book, an essay from Shakespeare critic Garret A. Sullivan Jr. {{describes}} {{the relationship between the}} speaker and the young man which is seen in sonnet four, saying [...] "The young man of the procreation sonnets, then, is the object of admonition; the poet (speaker) urgently seeks to make him change his ways, and, as we shall see does so in the intertwined names of beauty and memory and in the face of oblivion". Sonnet Four follows these very themes with the speaker praising his friend, the young man, for his beauty, he moves on to say that his friend not having children would be inexcusable, when he says [...] "Then how when nature calls thee to be gone: What acceptable audit canst though leave?" [...] (lines 11–12) Here the speaker is using the unpredictability of nature to try to convince his friend to hurry up and have children. He also tries to appeal to his friend's emotions by saying, [...] "For having traffic with thyself alone, / Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive" [...] (lines 9-10). The speaker is saying <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> and deceives the friend's own self if he decides to remain single and childless. Line 11 also contains a sexually suggestive play on words when the speaker says [...] "having traffic with thyself alone". The idea of being alone is used by the speaker as being the pathetic alternative to marrying and having a family.|$|E

2500|$|Further {{ramifications of}} the scandal came in summer 2009, when {{leadership}} of Cotidianul newspaper {{was taken over by}} Cornel Nistorescu, whose change in editorial line prompted a wave of resignations among the newspaper panelists, who identified the new policies as an unmitigated anti-Băsescu bias, and complained that Nistorescu was imposing censorship on independent contributors. In subsequent statements, Nistorescu alleged that his adversaries represented a pro-Băsescu [...] "pack" [...] led by Tismăneanu himself. Journalist Mădălina Șchiopu reacted against this perspective and other accusations aimed by Nistorescu toward his former colleagues, arguing that they amounted to [...] "a story with little green men and flying saucers" [...] which served to cover the [...] "fundamental incompatibility between [...] decisions and the notion of decency." [...] She viewed [...] "the idea that the source for all <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> with the Romanian press can be found somewhere in Tismăneanu's entourage" [...] as equivalent to declaring that Tismăneanu [...] "turns into a vârcolac under the fool moon and eats the newly born". In one of his other editorials, the new Cotidianul editor revisited Tismăneanu's past, quoting statements from the 1980s which, he wrote, made Tismăneanu [...] "a devoted communist activist" [...] incompatible with his later appointments: [...] "The chairman of the Presidential Commission could do anything, except condemning that which he has supported." [...] The events also prompted an article by Tismăneanu's friend, novelist Mircea Cărtărescu. It sarcastically included Nistorescu, alongside Vadim Tudor, Roșca-Stănescu, Voiculescu, Geoană and businessman Dinu Patriciu, all of them adverse to Băsescu, among the [...] "champions of democracy", noting that himself, Tismăneanu and other public figures who did not abandon Băsescu's cause [...] "despite his human flaws", were being negatively portrayed as [...] "ass-kissers" [...] and [...] "blind people".|$|E
2500|$|The President of the Massachusetts Senate {{controls}} the calling {{of a constitutional}} convention and its agenda. Senate President Tom Birmingham, an opponent of the amendment, called a joint meeting of the legislature as a constitutional convention for June 19, 2002, and immediately adjourned it for a month saying legislators needed for time to consider the agenda items. When the constitutional convention met again on July 17, the amendment's opponents knew that proponents had the 50 votes needed for passage. Birmingham, who was presiding, moved for adjournment without considering the amendment, and his motion passed 137 to 53. He called the amendment [...] "wrong-hearted and wrong-headed" [...] and defended the procedure: [...] "Everybody recognizes a vote to adjourn was a vote up or down" [...] on the amendment. [...] "I did gavel the last constitutional convention to a recess because I felt the members needed more time to assess.... Today we saw democracy in action. They may not like it, but they lost two to one." [...] A representative of the Catholic Action League, which supported the amendment, said: [...] "Everything <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> with Massachusetts state government was apparent today {{for all the world}} to see". One legislator who voted to adjourn said: [...] "For those of us who believe in an open democratic process, this was not a comfortable vote". State Senator Cheryl A. Jacques, an opponent of the amendment and a lesbian, said: [...] "I'm proud to have done anything possible to defeat this hate-filled, discriminatory measure. I'll take a victory on this any way I can get it." [...] Arlene Isaacson of the Massachusetts Gay and Lesbian Political Caucus later explained it was a critical moment because same-sex marriage had no chance of winning a popular vote at the time: [...] "Not that we would lose by a little, because that wasn't an issue.

2500|$|Rawat's {{affluent}} lifestyle was {{a source}} of controversy in the early 1970s. Some media reports said that Rawat [...] "lived more like a king than a Messiah". Critics said that his lifestyle was supported by the donations of followers and that the movement appeared to exist only to support Rawat's [...] "opulent existence"."The major focus of Maharaji is on stillness, peace, and contentment within the individual, and his 'Knowledge' consists of the techniques to obtain them. Knowledge, roughly translated, means the happiness of the true self-understanding. Each individual should seek to comprehend his or her true self. In turn, this brings a sense of well-being, joy, and harmony as one comes in contact with one's [...] "own nature." [...] The Knowledge includes four meditation procedures: Light, Music, Nectar and Word. The process of reaching the true self within can only be achieved by the individual, but with the guidance and help of a teacher. Hence, the movement seems to embrace aspects of world-rejection and world-affirmation. The tens of thousands of followers in the West do not see themselves as members of a religion, but the adherents of a system of teachings that extol the goal of enjoying life to the full." [...] Supporters said there is no conflict between worldly and spiritual riches, and that Rawat did not advise anyone to [...] "abandon the material world", but said it is our attachment to it <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong.</b> Press reports listed expensive automobiles such as Rolls-Royces, Mercedes-Benz limousines and sports cars, some of them gifts. Rawat said, [...] "I have something far more precious to give them than money and material things – I give peace". [...] "Maharaj Ji's luxuries are gifts from a Western culture whose fruits are watches and Cadillacs," [...] a spokesman said. Some premies said {{that he did not want}} the gifts, but that people gave them out of their love for him. They saw Rawat's lifestyle as an example of a lila, or divine play, which held a mirror to the [...] "money-crazed and contraption-collecting society" [...] of the West.|$|E

The result is dire." [...] Andrew Sarris in his July 18, 1977, review for The Village Voice summarized the film as [...] "a visual and aural textbook on everything <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> with current movies," [...] as well as stating that the movie reset Friedkin's status to the beginning of his career, and compared him unfavourably to Clouzot, John Huston and David Lean, declaring that [...] "he has not come close to matching their craftsmanship." [...] Robert C. Cumbow in the September 1977 issue of Movietone News also panned the film, criticizing camera placement as [...] "faulty", which in his opinion led to substandard exposition. Moreover, he also deemed the film's editing [...] "ridiculous" [...] and thought Sorcerer lacked character involvement. John Marlowe of The Miami News assessed the movie's dialogues unfavourably, stating that [...] "Sorcerer's dialog is kept to such a minimum that not only you don't feel for these four losers, but you never really get to know them." [...] He also considered the film's mixture of realist and surrealist moments as [...] "pain in the mind". Peter Biskind described the film as [...] "self-consciously arty and pretentious [...] fatally trapped between America and Europe, commerce and art," [...] claiming the end result represented [...] "the worst of both worlds", as well as noting that the audience of the time was strikingly different from the one that adored The French Connection. Films Illustrated summarized Sorcerer as an inferior sequel, [...] "below the usual par", in spite of the involvement of reputable lead actor Scheider and a [...] "topnotch director", Friedkin. In the August 1997 issue of The Progressive, Kenneth Turan praised the movie's narrative set-up; however, he thought that in spite of it, it was impossible to attach oneself to the characters. He concluded the review by saying that with [...] "films like this, feeling is everything."
