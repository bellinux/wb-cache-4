5|$|<b>The</b> <b>crossing</b> {{had always}} been tolled, and from 1 April 2003 this became a charge, though since 2008 it has been free from 10 pm to 6 am.

5|$|There {{is a red}} marble step to the chancel end of <b>the</b> <b>crossing.</b> <b>The</b> <b>crossing</b> has a {{chamfered}} north east angle for a tower stair, with a door at the foot.

The corner panels have fan vaulting on corbels, the other outer panels slope and the centre has a moulded roundel. There is a small plug in the centre, which, when removed, allows observers in the bell ringing chamber to view <b>the</b> <b>crossing.</b> The massive arches, supporting the equally monumental tower, is apparently early thirteenth century.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{frequently}} found charges in heraldry, if not the most, is <b>the</b> <b>cross,</b> which has developed into, some say, 400 varieties.

The most commonly found crosses in heraldry include <b>the</b> <b>cross</b> botonny, <b>the</b> <b>cross</b> flory, <b>the</b> <b>cross</b> moline, <b>the</b> <b>cross</b> potent, <b>the</b> <b>cross</b> patée or formée, <b>the</b> <b>cross</b> patonce and <b>the</b> <b>cross</b> crosslet.|$|R

In the 14th century, the central piers of <b>the</b> <b>crossing</b> were found to be sinking under the weight of <b>the</b> <b>crossing</b> tower which had been damaged by an earthquake in the previous century. Strainer arches, sometimes described as scissor arches, were inserted by master mason William Joy to brace and stabilise the piers as a unit.|$|E

5|$|Contrary to {{the common}} understanding, <b>the</b> <b>crossing</b> of the Andes {{was not the first}} time that a {{military}} expedition crossed the mountain range. The difference from previous operations was the size of the army, and that it had to be ready for combat right after <b>the</b> <b>crossing.</b> The army was divided in six columns, each taking a different path. Colonel Francisco Zelada in La Rioja took the Come-Caballos pass towards Copiapó. Juan Manuel Cabot, in San Juan, moved to Coquimbo. Ramón Freire and José León Lemos led two columns in the south. The bulk of the armies left from Mendoza. San Martín, O'Higgins and Soler led a column across the Los Patos pass, and Juan Gregorio de Las Heras another one across the Uspallata Pass.|$|E

60|$|And {{therefore}} it is, {{that from the}} earliest times <b>the</b> <b>cross</b> has been <b>the</b> special sign of Christians. We keep it up still, when we make the sign of <b>the</b> <b>cross</b> on children's foreheads in baptism: but we have given up using the sign of <b>the</b> <b>cross</b> commonly, because it was perverted, in old times, into a superstitious charm. Men worshipped <b>the</b> <b>cross</b> like an idol, or bits of wood which they fancied were pieces of <b>the</b> actual <b>cross,</b> while they were forgetting what <b>the</b> <b>cross</b> meant.
