5|$|A third species, L. consors, was {{established}} by Marsh in 1894 for YPM 1882, which consists of most of one articulated skeleton and part {{of at least one}} other individual. The skull was only partially preserved, {{and the fact that the}} vertebrae were represented only by centra suggests a partially grown individual. Galton (1983) notes <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the current mounted skeleton was restored in plaster, or had paint applied.|$|E
5|$|Bacliff, like San Leon, and Bayview, {{originated}} as {{a fishing}} community. In 2012 T.J.

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1968, the {{prospective}} purchases from the six countries amounted to 1,500 aircraft. Canada and Belgium had departed before any long-term commitments {{had been made to}} the programme; Canada had found the project politically unpalatable; there was a perception in political circles <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the manufacturing and specifications were focused on Western Europe. France had made a favourable offer to Belgium on the Dassault Mirage 5, which created doubt as to whether the MRCA would be worthwhile from Belgium's operational perspective.|$|E
5|$|Chesma (Russian: Чесма, {{sometimes}} transliterated as Tchesma) was {{the second}} ship of the s built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the 1880s. When the ship was completed she proved to be very overweight which meant <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> her waterline armor belt was submerged. Russian companies could not produce the most advanced armour and machinery desired by the Naval General Staff, so they were imported from the United Kingdom and Belgium. Chesma spent her career {{as part of the}} Black Sea Fleet.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War, Liverpool's {{importance}} {{as a major}} port saw it become a target for the Luftwaffe and during the May Blitz of 1941, a heavy bomb exploded in the basement, {{on the eastern side}} of the building. The damage from the explosion was significant with the eastern wing being seriously damaged by fire. Nonetheless the building's structural integrity meant <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the building could be re-occupied with only temporary repairs. In the aftermath of the war the building was fully restored; the cost of restoration exceeding the original construction costs.|$|E

5|$|Goldfaden's father {{wrote him}} to solicit the troupe {{to come to}} Odessa in Ukraine, which was then part of Imperial Russia.

5|$|In Hamden, Connecticut, the National Guard {{was called}} in to aid in cleanup and keep order, as some looting was {{reported}} in the devastated area. President George H. W.

5|$|It {{is likely}} <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> Morris's {{preference}} for medieval textiles was formed– or crystallised– during his brief apprenticeship with G. E. Street.

5|$|Jonathan Riley-Smith {{considers}} <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> {{the popular}} {{understanding of the}} Crusades derives from the novels of Walter Scott and the French histories by Joseph François Michaud.

5|$|On 10 May 1947, {{immediately}} after a Great Britain versus Rest of Europe match in Glasgow (Britain won 6–1), {{he made the}} move for £11,500, {{at the age of}} 32. The match itself raised £30,000 for the four Home Nations Football Associations, and since the eleven British players received £14 each, Matthews questioned where exactly this money ended up – he doubted <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> it ended up as funding for grass-roots football.|$|E
5|$|Resistance to the {{operation}} by the chosen units meant <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the preparation was not completed.

Despite its limited impact, the operation gave the LCS experience in planning deceptions, and laid the groundwork for future exploitation of Hitler's belief that Northern Europe was strategically important.|$|E

5|$|The {{airfield}} is very {{isolated in}} northwest Utah, {{sitting in the}} middle of a vast wasteland miles away from any major population center.

Still-extant facilities include the vast runway system, numerous ramps, taxiways, dispersal pads, and most of the original hangars (including the Enola Gay B-29 hangar). Most of the hospital complex and many barracks remain, as does a chow hall, chapel, swimming pool and many other World War II-era buildings.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{earthworks}} {{were built}} up from local chalk; the ditches dug around the fortification {{would not have}} provided enough for the mound itself, and local tradition suggests <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the earth was quarried instead from the nearby Gallows Pits in the town. The castle was constructed by hand, using workers digging with wooden shovels, and probably without pickaxes. It is estimated that the motte would have taken around 24,000 man days of effort to build.|$|E
