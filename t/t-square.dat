At first he rented a shop and parlour at 3 Great Turnstile, Holborn, and began the business with £100 capital. He invented a new <b>T-square</b> which improved the standard one and became universally used. A cousin, Henry Robinson, joined him with a capital of £150, but died in 1859. Stanley stopped using the name Robinson and changed his signature {{as a consequence of}} being robbed of his cheque book during the early days of his business.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian shadow clocks divided daytime into 12 {{parts with}} each part further divided into more precise parts. One type of shadow clock {{consisted}} of a long stem with five variable marks and an elevated crossbar which cast a shadow over those marks. It was positioned eastward in the morning, and was turned west at noon. Obelisks functioned {{in much the same}} manner: the shadow cast on the markers around it allowed the Egyptians to calculate the time. The obelisk also indicated whether it was morning or afternoon, as well as the summer and winter solstices. A third shadow clock, developed c. 1500, was similar in shape to a bent <b>T-square.</b> It measured the passage of time by the shadow cast by its crossbar on a non-linear rule. The T was oriented eastward in the mornings, and turned around at noon, so that it could cast its shadow in the opposite direction.|$|E

The new gridiron plans were spectacular in their inefficiency and waste. By usually failing to discriminate sufficiently between main arteries and residential streets, the first were not made wide enough while the second were usually too wide for purely neighborhood functions... as for its contribution to the permanent social functions of the city, the anonymous gridiron plan proved empty." ...|$|E

40|$|This study {{compared}} the permutation method for Hotelling <b>T-squared</b> and the randomization method for RV coefficient {{in terms of}} relative efficiency of the test statistic value. The source of data employed was simulation form distributions such as Cauchy distribution and Normal distribution. Also, secondary data {{was used to evaluate}} the methods. The findings of this study revealed that the randomization method for RV coefficient performed better than the permutation method for Hotelling <b>T-squared</b> test in terms of relative efficiency of the test statistic value for both Cauchy distribution and Normally distributed data since the standard deviation of the test statistic measure for the randomization test for RV coefficient (Standard deviation= 0. 22 and 0. 16 respectively) is lesser than that of the permutation method for Hotelling <b>T-squared</b> test (standard deviation = 1. 09 and 0. 39 respectively). This result implies that the variation on the test statistic value for the randomization method for RV coefficient is smaller than that of the permutation method for Hotelling <b>T-squared</b> test; hence the randomization method for RV coefficient was concluded to be the most relatively efficient method between the two methods under observation. The result of applying the permutation method for Hotelling <b>T-squared</b> analysis for measuring the equality in weight of two groups of broiler birds showed that the reference value of th...|$|R

2500|$|As {{seen from}} the vilification in Moore's and James' {{comments}} quoted above, the Commissioners came in for as much criticism as the grid itself.

2500|$|The {{design of}} the PSFS Building {{elicited}} both early criticism and praise. In the March 1931 issue of <b>T-Square</b> Club Journal Elbert Conover said, [...] "The day will come when even in America, we will become skillful enough to meet economic pressure without forcing upon the community such ugliness and illogical designing." [...] The PSFS Building {{was one of only}} two U.S. skyscrapers included in the 1932 International style exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art. Run by Henry-Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson, the exhibition was where the term International style was coined. The PSFS Building was praised for its cantilevering facade and the building's organization of shops on the first floor, the banking hall on the second floor, offices above and the service tower in the back. Unlike the PSFS Building, the {{design of the}} other skyscraper—New York City's McGraw-Hill Building—was more due to necessity of publishing operations and zoning restrictions than following an architectural movement. Hitchcock and Johnson were critical of both building's use of ornamental signage at the top. However, Lescaze and Howe's design was not featured at the 1932 Architectural League of New York Annual Exhibition after the skyscraper was deemed as having an ugly and illogical design. Howe responded by saying [...] "Like all institutions which have become traditional, it tends to resent change." ...|$|E

By means of a strip of lead called a leaden tape, which he pressed around and into the fillets and hollows with his finger and thumb, he transferred the exact contour of each moulding to his drawing, that lay on a sketching-stool a few feet distant; where were also a sketching-block, a small <b>T-square,</b> a bow-pencil, and other mathematical instruments.

On the port side of the room, near the bookshelves, is a sofa with its back to the windows. It is a sturdy mahogany article, oddly upholstered in sailcloth, including the bolster, with a couple of blankets hanging over the back. Between the sofa and the drawing-table is a big wicker chair, with broad arms and a low sloping back, with its back to the light. A small but stout table of teak, with a round top and gate legs, stands against the port wall between the door and the bookcase. It is the only article in the room that suggests (not at all convincingly) a woman's hand in the furnishing. The uncarpeted floor of narrow boards is caulked and holystoned like a deck.|$|E

6000|$|It was by one {{of those}} {{accidents}} which are the best fortunes of travel that I visited the Villa Papa Giulio, when I thought I was merely going to the Piazza del Popolo, to which one cannot go too often. A chance look at my guide-book beguiled me {{with the notion that}} the villa was just outside the gate; but it was a deceit which I should be glad to have practised on me every February 17th of my life. If the villa was farther off than I thought, the way to it lay for a while through a tramwayed suburban street delightfully encumbered with wide-horned oxen drawing heavy wagon-loads of grain, donkeys pulling carts laden with vegetables, and children and hens and dogs playing their several parts in a perspective through which one would like to continue indefinitely. But after awhile a dim, cool, curving lane leaves this street and irresistibly invites your cab to follow it; and sooner than you could ask you get to the villa gate. There a gatekeeper tacitly wonders at your arriving before he is well awake, and will keep you a good five minutes while he parleys with another custodian before he can bring himself to sell you a ticket and let you into the beautiful, old, orange-gray cloistered court, where there is a young architect with the <b>T-square</b> of his calling sketching some point of it, and a gardener gently hacking off from the parent stems such palm-leaves as have survived their usefulness. Beyond is the famous fountained court, and a classic temple to the right, and other structures responsive to the impulses of the good Pope Julius III., who was never tired of adding to this pleasure palace of his. It was his favorite resort, with all his court, from the Vatican, and his favorite amusement in it was the somewhat academic diversion of proverbs, which Ranke says sometimes [...] "mingled blushes with the smiles of his guests." ...|$|E
