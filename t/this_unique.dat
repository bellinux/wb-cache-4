5|$|A katipo bite {{produces}} the toxic syndrome latrodectism; symptoms include extreme pain and, potentially, hypertension, seizure, or coma. Bites are rare, an antivenom is available, and no deaths {{have been reported}} since 1901. The katipo is particularly notable in New Zealand as the nation is almost entirely devoid of dangerous native wildlife; <b>this</b> <b>unique</b> status means the spider is well known, despite being rarely seen.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} symbol {{among the}} Nri religion was the omu, a tender palm frond, used to sacralize and restrain. It {{was used as}} protection for traveling delegations or safeguarding certain objects; a person or object carrying an omu twig was considered protected. The influence of these symbols and institutions extended well beyond Nri, and <b>this</b> <b>unique</b> Igbo socio-political system proved capable of controlling areas wider than villages or towns.|$|E
5|$|It does so by {{preventing}} {{the formation of}} the initiation complex, composed of the 30S and 50S subunits of the ribosome, tRNA, and mRNA. Linezolid binds to the 23S portion of the 50S subunit (the center of peptidyl transferase activity), close to the binding sites of chloramphenicol, lincomycin, and other antibiotics. Due to <b>this</b> <b>unique</b> mechanism of action, cross-resistance between linezolid and other protein synthesis inhibitors is highly infrequent or nonexistent.|$|E

5|$|On William Cubitt's advice the two {{stations}} in the cemetery were built as temporary structures, in the expectation that {{they would need to}} be rebuilt once the railway was operational and the issues with operating a railway of <b>this</b> <b>unique</b> nature became clearer. Both were designed by Sydney Smirke, who presented his designs to the LNC in March 1854.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{thylakoid}} membranes {{have the}} largest lipid component of a non-bilayer forming monogalactosyl diglyceride (MGDG), and little phospholipids; despite <b>this</b> <b>unique</b> lipid composition, chloroplast thylakoid membranes {{have been shown to}} contain a dynamic lipid-bilayer matrix as revealed by magnetic resonance and electron microscope studies.|$|E

5|$|Severely {{threatened}} by the 2001 outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in England and Wales, the breed has survived due to the intent to preserve <b>this</b> <b>unique</b> animal as {{a crucial part of}} traditional Lakeland agriculture. Still far fewer in number than most commercial breeds, Herdwicks survive largely due to farming subsidies and the aid of the British National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{beginning}} of this country's history, most American Indian tribes have been subject to federal authority and jurisdiction. In Maine, however, indigenous populations lived on reservations that were exclusively and completely administered by the state. <b>This</b> <b>unique</b> arrangement shaped tribal life in Maine, and proved to be a crucial issue in the development and resolution of the tribe's land claim.|$|E
5|$|The Eskayan {{writing system}} {{takes the form}} of a syllabary of over 1,000 characters, all modeled on parts of the human body {{including}} internal organs. <b>This</b> <b>unique</b> script has been compared variously to Phoenician, Etruscan, Hebrew, and even the undeciphered script of the Butuan paleograph. While there are no mother-tongue speakers of Eskayan, it is taught to both adults and children in volunteer-run cultural schools. The Eskayan language and script has been the object of ongoing controversy.|$|E

5|$|Based {{upon the}} {{structure}} of the bill, {{it has been suggested that}} <b>this</b> <b>unique</b> bill was used as a pincer, with the tips of both mandibles touching. The hookbill could have used this movement to pluck fruits or flowers for consumption, or it may have been used to extract snails from their shells. It is also possible that the bird could have crushed a snail shell between its mandibles and then used its tongue to ingest the meat and expel the shell out of the open sides of the beak.|$|E
5|$|Galveston Bay {{is mostly}} shallow {{with an average}} depth of 7–9feet. It is fed by the Trinity River and the San Jacinto River, {{numerous}} local bayous and incoming tides from the Gulf of Mexico. <b>This</b> <b>unique</b> and complex mixing of waters from different sources supports many types of marine life including crabs, shrimp, oysters, and many varieties of fish thereby supporting a substantial fishing industry. Additionally the system of bayous, rivers, and marshes that ring the Bay support their own ecosystems allowing for diverse wildlife and enabling freshwater farming of crawfish. The areas near the bay shore in fact have a higher diversity of habitats than the nearby Gulf coast.|$|E

The city offers a cosmopolitan and diverse lifestyle with a variety of food, entertainment, and night life, available in a form and abundance comparable to that in other world capitals. Mumbai's history as a major trading centre has led to a diverse range of cultures, religions, and cuisines coexisting in the city. <b>This</b> <b>unique</b> blend of cultures is due to the migration of people from all over India since the British period.|$|E
5|$|Numerous factors {{led to the}} {{evacuation}} of St Kilda. The islands' inhabitants had existed for centuries in relative isolation until tourism {{and the presence of}} the military during the First World War led the islanders to seek alternatives to privations they routinely suffered. The changes made to the island by visitors in the nineteenth century disconnected the islanders from the way of life that had allowed their forebears to survive in <b>this</b> <b>unique</b> environment. Despite construction of a small jetty in 1902, the islands remained at the weather's mercy.|$|E
5|$|The Gaussian {{integers}} {{are complex}} {{numbers of the}} form α=u+vi, where u and v are ordinary integers and i is the square root of negative one. By defining an analog of the Euclidean algorithm, Gaussian integers can {{be shown to be}} uniquely factorizable, by the argument above. <b>This</b> <b>unique</b> factorization is helpful in many applications, such as deriving all Pythagorean triples or proving Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares. In general, the Euclidean algorithm is convenient in such applications, but not essential; for example, the theorems can often be proven by other arguments.|$|E

Since then, modifications have been made to the original design, resulting {{in one of the most}} efficient and powerful steam locomotives ever to run in Britain. As a result, the Duke of Gloucester can frequently be seen on the mainline around Britain.|$|E
5|$|Thus {{while other}} European sovereigns were {{building}} luxurious, modern Renaissance and Baroque palaces, politics {{and common sense}} demanded that the palace of the Monegasque rulers be fortified. <b>This</b> <b>unique</b> requirement, at such a late stage in history, has made the palace at Monaco {{one of the most}} unusual in Europe. Indeed, when its fortifications were finally relaxed during the late 18th century, it was seized by the French and stripped of its treasures, and fell into decline, while the Grimaldi were exiled for over 20 years.|$|E
5|$|Between 11 March (Commonwealth Day) and 10 August 2002, {{as part of}} the {{preparations}} for the upcoming Commonwealth Games and to celebrate Her Majesty the Queen's Golden Jubilee, a national Spirit of Friendship Festival was organised. On 9 July, {{a few weeks before the}} Games began, a sculpture outside the new national headquarters of the English Institute of Sport at SportCity was unveiled by the middle-distance runner, Steve Cram MBE. This sculpture, commissioned in late 2001, was created in a little over eight weeks by Altrincham-based artist, Colin Spofforth, who had submitted to Manchester City Council his idea for a heroic-sized sculpture of a sprinter as a means of celebrating the beauty, power and determination of the competing athletes. Reaching thirty feet high, weighing seven tonnes, and titled The Runner, <b>this</b> <b>unique</b> larger-than-life bronze statue of a male sprinter surmounting a bronze globe was, at the time, the United Kingdom's largest sporting sculpture. It depicts the very moment the runner leaves the blocks once the starter's gun has fired.|$|E
