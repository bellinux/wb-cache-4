40|$|Features of the {{intertidal}} zonation on {{the rocky}} shores of the Galapagos Islands are described and discussed in relation to environmental factors, in particular temperature - which varies with regional hydrology and climatology. Owing to the thermal properties of the coastal waters and {{to the nature of}} the substrate (mainly basalt), intertidal organisms are exposed to a wide range of temperatures, which fluctuate with <b>tide,</b> <b>day,</b> and season. As a result, life is mostly restricted to the lowest levels of the shore; the middle- and upper-level populations are sparse. Local variations (biofacies) resulting from water agitation are described. Biota consist of tropical, subtropical, and warm-temperate components. Tropical species dominate in sheltered areas and in middle and upper shores. © 1974 Springer-Verlag. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
2500|$|The {{times and}} {{amplitude}} of tides {{at any given}} locale {{are influenced by the}} alignment of the Sun and Moon, by the pattern of tides in the deep ocean, by the amphidromic systems of the oceans, and the shape of the coastline and near-shore bathymetry (see Timing). Some shorelines experience a semi-diurnal tide—two nearly equal high and low <b>tides</b> each <b>day.</b> Other locations experience a diurnal tide—only one high and low <b>tide</b> each <b>day.</b> A [...] "mixed tide"—two uneven <b>tides</b> a <b>day,</b> or one high and one low—is also possible.|$|R
50|$|The Northumberland Strait {{varies in}} depth between 17 and 65 metres, with the deepest waters at either end. The tidal {{patterns}} are complex; {{the eastern end}} has the usual two <b>tides</b> per <b>day,</b> with a tidal range of 1.2 to 1.8 metres, while the western end effectively has only one <b>tide</b> per <b>day.</b>|$|R
50|$|Juveniles {{are seldom}} seen and {{therefore}} {{little is known}} about their ecology. The adults feed on small organic particles (detritus) and seagrasses that are brought in with the tide. Their habitat is a gently sloping intertidal zone with two high and two low <b>tides</b> each <b>day.</b> There are large differences in the duration of flooding and sea level between the two high <b>tides</b> each <b>day,</b> between seasons and between places nearer to or further from the shoreline.|$|R

50|$|Analog tide clocks {{are most}} {{accurate}} {{for use on}} the Atlantic coasts of America and Europe. This is because along the Atlantic coastline the moon controls the tides predictably, ebbing and flowing on a regular (12- to 13-hour) schedule. However, {{in other parts of}} the world such as along the Pacific Coast, tides can be irregular. The Pacific Ocean is so vast that the moon cannot control the entire ocean at once. The result is that parts of the Pacific Coast can have 3 high <b>tides</b> a <b>day.</b> Similarly, there are areas in the world like the Gulf of Mexico or the South China Sea that have only one high <b>tide</b> a <b>day.</b> Mechanical <b>tide</b> clocks used on the Pacific Coast must be adjusted frequently, often as much as weekly, and are not useful in diurnal areas (those with one <b>tide</b> per <b>day).</b>|$|R
30|$|Local {{climate is}} {{influenced}} by two monsoons determining wet (September to December) and dry seasons (January to August). The tidal regime of NT Bay is irregular diurnal with a spring tide/neap tide cycle of 14 days {{and a range of}} 1.5 to 2.0 m. Monthly, there are around 18 to 22 <b>days</b> of diurnal <b>tide</b> and the rest are of mix-semidiurnal. During neap <b>tide</b> <b>days,</b> there is daily additional small high tide. During neap tide, the amplitude is about 0.5 m (Lan et al. 2012).|$|R
25|$|When {{there are}} two high <b>tides</b> each <b>day</b> with {{different}} heights (and two low tides also of different heights), the pattern is called a mixed semi-diurnal tide.|$|R
50|$|Bacht‘s aim as {{an artist}} is the {{visualisation}} of dialectical processes between artistic material and aesthetic design principles that always unfold as respectful mimeses of cyclic laws of nature. „The wave“, writes Hans Gercke, „fascinates him in its polarity of height and depth, light and shade, concave and convex movement, serenity and dynamic“. Such elementary experiences, the rhythm that all organic life depends on, the pulse of our bloodstream, the <b>tides,</b> <b>day</b> and night, the seasons, the law of tension and release, are objectified in all work groups and lend aesthetic unity to Bacht’s work.|$|R

50|$|The {{cycle of}} tides is {{dependent}} on the phase of the moon, with the highest tides spring tides occurring near full moon and new moon. As the lunar cycle is about 29.5 <b>days,</b> successive <b>tides</b> are approximately 24/29th of an hour later each day or about 50 minutes but many other observations and considerations are required to develop accurate tide tables. On the Atlantic coast of northwest Europe, the interval between each low and high tide averages about 6 hours and 10 minutes, giving two high tides and two low <b>tides</b> each <b>day,</b> with the highest <b>tides</b> about 2 <b>days</b> after full moon.|$|R

2500|$|During {{the scoring}} of The Last Samurai in early 2003, Zimmer was {{approached}} by the producer Jerry Bruckheimer, {{with whom he had}} worked previously on Crimson <b>Tide,</b> <b>Days</b> of Thunder, The Rock, and Pearl Harbor. Bruckheimer had finished shooting [...] but was unhappy with the music composed for the film by Alan Silvestri and wanted a replacement score. Bruckheimer wanted Zimmer to rescore the film, but due to his commitments on The Last Samurai, the task of composing and supervising music for Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was given to Klaus Badelt, one of Zimmer's colleagues at Media Ventures. Zimmer provided some themes that were used in the film, although he is not credited on screen. Zimmer was hired as the composer for the three subsequent films in the series, [...] (2006), [...] (2007), and [...] (2011), collaborating with Rodrigo y Gabriela for the last.|$|R

50|$|The {{majority}} of Botum Sakor’s area comprise gently sloping lowland covered by evergreen wood and grasslands, emerging in coastal flood plains with mangrove and swamp forests. The climate {{is characterized by}} a tropical monsoon and the area has two high <b>tides</b> per <b>day,</b> with a range of approximately 1.5 m. The human population of Botum Sakor National Park is unknown.|$|R
40|$|Trophic relay is an {{ecological}} model {{that involves the}} movement of biomass and energy from vegetation, such as saltmarshes, within estuaries to the open sea via a series of predator-prey relationships. Any potential for trophic relay is therefore affected by water movements within an estuary and by {{the ability of a}} predator to "switch" prey in response to fluctuating abundances of those prey. Saltmarsh-dwelling grapsid crabs, which feed on saltmarsh-derived detritus and microphytobenthos, release zoeae into ebbing tides that inundate saltmarshes during spring-tide cycles within tidally-dominated estuaries, such as Brisbane Water Estuary, therefore providing an opportunity to examine whether prey-switching and/or trophic relay may occur in fish that feed on those zoeae (such as the highly abundant estuarine ambassid, Ambassis jacksoniensis). This model was examined by sampling A. jacksoniensis near saltmarshes in a large, temperate south-eastern Australian estuary during flood and ebb <b>tides</b> on <b>days</b> of saltmarsh inundation and non-inundation over four spring-tide events in 2012. Stomach fullnesses of A. jacksoniensis were generally highest during ebb <b>tides</b> on <b>days</b> of saltmarsh inundation, implying that feeding was most marked at these times. Caridean decapods dominated diets during flood <b>tides</b> and on <b>days</b> of no saltmarsh inundation, while crab zoeae dominated diets during ebb <b>tides</b> and on <b>days</b> of inundation, suggesting that, when saltmarsh-derived zoeae became abundant, A. jacksoniensis switched to feeding on those prey. Three potential zooplankton prey (calanoid copepods, caridean decapods and crab zoeae) did not differ calorimetrically, indicating that switching of prey by A. jacksoniensis is not directly related to their preying on energetically greater prey, but reflects opportunistic feeding on more abundant and/or less elusive prey. As A. jacksoniensis is able to switch prey from estuarine caridean decapods to saltmarsh-derived crab zoeae, this very abundant ambassid would be well-placed to promote any trophic relay, via further water movements or other predator-prey relationships, to the adjacent marine environment...|$|R
50|$|The {{north coast}} {{is unusual in}} having four high <b>tides</b> each <b>day,</b> with a double high tide every twelve and a half hours. This arises because the western Solent is {{narrower}} than the eastern; the initial tide of water flowing from the west starts to ebb before the stronger flow around {{the south of the}} island returns through the eastern Solent to create a second high water.|$|R

60|$|But she did not. She {{turned away}} in disdain {{and left the}} room; and since that time there is one episode in our life which we never refer to. Hence the <b>tide</b> of our <b>days</b> flows by in deep and untroubled serenity.|$|R
50|$|Today, {{very little}} {{remains of the}} J. Marhoffer. The 12 ft {{diameter}} boiler can still be seen {{at the bottom of}} the bay at low tide. During extreme low <b>tides,</b> on calm <b>days,</b> it is possible for visitors to walk down to the boiler.|$|R

25|$|Because {{the moon}} is moving in its orbit around the earth {{and in the same}} sense as the Earth's rotation, a point on the earth must rotate {{slightly}} further to catch up so that the time between semidiurnal tides is not twelve but 12.4206 hours—a bit over twenty-five minutes extra. The two peaks are not equal. The two high <b>tides</b> a <b>day</b> alternate in maximum heights: lower high (just under three feet), higher high (just over three feet), and again lower high. Likewise for the low tides.|$|R
25|$|Isaac Newton's {{theory of}} {{gravitation}} first enabled {{an explanation of}} why there were generally two <b>tides</b> a <b>day,</b> not one, and offered hope for a detailed understanding of tidal forces and behavior. Although it may seem that tides could be predicted via a sufficiently detailed knowledge of instantaneous astronomical forcings, the actual tide at a given location is determined by astronomical forces accumulated over many days. In addition, precise results require detailed knowledge of the shape of all the ocean basins—their bathymetry, and coastline shape.|$|R
