5|$|In the comitatus, {{there is}} {{consensus}} that vexillationes were c. 500 and legiones c. 1,000 strong. The greatest uncertainty concerns {{the size of}} the crack auxilia palatina infantry regiments, originally formed by Constantine. <b>The</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> contradictory, suggesting that these units could have been either c. 500 or c. 1,000 strong, or somewhere in between. If the higher figure were true, then there would be little to distinguish auxilia from legiones, which is the strongest argument in favour of c. 500.|$|E
5|$|Neville was a royal {{clerk to}} King John {{in the spring}} of 1207, and in December of that year was at Marlborough Castle on royal business. Earlier {{references}} to a Ralph Neville who in 1207 delivered items to Hugh de Neville, or the Ralph Neville who was the same Hugh de Neville's chaplain, may be to the future bishop, but <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> inconclusive. Hugh de Neville and Neville subsequently worked together, and corresponded on both business and personal affairs. Both men claimed the other as a kinsman.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> that {{units of}} the comitatenses were {{believed}} to be higher quality than of the limitanei. But the difference should not be exaggerated. Suggestions have been made that the limitanei were a part-time militia of local farmers, of poor combat capability. This view is rejected by many modern scholars. <b>The</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> that limitanei were full-time professionals. They were charged with combating the incessant small-scale barbarian raids that were the empire's enduring security problem. It is therefore likely that their combat readiness and experience were high. This was demonstrated at the siege of Amida (359) where the besieged frontier legions resisted the Persians with great skill and tenacity. Elton suggests that the lack of mention in the sources of barbarian incursions less than 400-strong implies that such were routinely dealt with by the border forces without the need of assistance from the comitatus. Limitanei regiments often joined the comitatus for specific campaigns, and were sometimes retained by the comitatus long-term with the title of pseudocomitatenses, implying adequate combat capability.|$|E

5|$|Writer/artist Alison Bechdel's book Fun Home, {{a memoir}} in comics format, was {{published}} in 2006 to critical acclaim. Its subject is Alison Bechdel's coming of age, with particular emphasis on her relationship to her father, Bruce Bechdel. Alison's coming out as a lesbian {{is complicated by the}} revelation that Bruce was a closeted homosexual whose extra-marital affairs included underage men. Four months after Alison comes out to her parents, Bruce is killed by an oncoming truck; although <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> equivocal, Alison concludes that he committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, more recent work has {{suggested}} that the regular army of the 2nd century was considerably larger than the c. 300,000 traditionally assumed. This is because the 2nd-century auxilia were not just equal in numbers to the legions as in the early 1st century, but some 50% larger. The army of the Principate probably reached a peak of nearly 450,000 (excluding fleets and foederati) {{at the end of the}} 2nd century. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> that the actual strength of 2nd-century units was typically much closer to official (c. 85%) than 4th century units.|$|E
5|$|Bottomley {{was born}} on 23 March 1860, at 16 Saint Peter's Street, Bethnal Green in London, the second child and only son of William Bottomley, a tailor's cutter, and Elizabeth, née Holyoake. William Bottomley's {{background}} is obscure, but Elizabeth belonged to a family of well-known radical agitators—her brother George Jacob Holyoake was {{a founder of the}} Secularist movement and in later life a leading figure in the growth of Co-operative societies. Among Holyoake's close associates was Charles Bradlaugh, who founded the National Republican League and became a controversial Member of Parliament. A longstanding friendship between Bradlaugh and Elizabeth Holyoake led to rumours that he, not William Bottomley, was Horatio's biological father—a suggestion that Bottomley, in later life, was prone to encourage. <b>The</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> circumstantial, mainly based on the marked facial resemblance between Bradlaugh and Bottomley.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, {{thousands}} of inhabitants of Seveso, Italy {{were exposed to}} TCDD after an accidental release of several kilograms of TCDD from a pressure tank. A number of animals died, and high concentrations of TCDD, up to 56,000 pg/g of fat, were noted especially in children playing outside and eating local food. The acute effects were limited to about 200 cases of chloracne. Long-term effects seem to include a slight excess of multiple myeloma and myeloid leukaemia, {{as well as some}} developmental effects such as disturbed development of teeth and excess of girls born to fathers who were exposed as children. Several other long-term effects have been suspected, but <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> not very strong.|$|E
5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the book, the memoir exhibits Bruce Bechdel's obsession with restoring the family's Victorian home. His obsessive need to restore the house is connected to his emotional distance from his family, which he expressed in coldness and occasional bouts of abusive rage. This emotional distance, in turn, is connected with his being a closeted homosexual. Bruce Bechdel had homosexual relationships in the military and with his high school students; some of those students were also family friends and babysitters. At the age of 44, two weeks after his wife requested a divorce, he stepped into the path of an oncoming Sunbeam Bread truck and was killed. Although <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> equivocal, Alison Bechdel concludes that her father committed suicide.|$|E
5|$|Northumbria's {{southern}} frontier with Mercia {{ran across}} England, from the Humber in the east, following the River Ouse and the River Don, to the Mersey in the west. Some archaeological evidence, the Roman Rig dyke, near modern Sheffield, appears {{to show that}} it was a defended border, with large earthworks set back from the frontier. The Nico Ditch, to the south of modern Manchester, has been cited in this context, though it has also been argued that it was simply a boundary marker without fortifications. In the far north, <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> less clear, and it appears that authority lay with sub-kings, perhaps including native British rulers.

5|$|Some {{aspects of}} the mysteries of Isis and of other mystery cults, {{particularly}} their connection with the afterlife, resemble important elements of Christianity. The {{question of whether the}} mysteries influenced Christianity is controversial and <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> unclear; some scholars today attribute the similarities to a shared cultural background rather than direct influence. In contrast, Apuleius's account has had direct effects in modern times. Through his description of them, the mysteries of Isis have influenced many works of fiction and modern fraternal organizations, as well as a widespread, though false, belief that the ancient Egyptians themselves had an elaborate system of mystery initiations.|$|E
5|$|The emperor's {{blessing of}} Palmyrene {{authority}} has been debated; Aurelian's acceptance of Palmyrene rule in Egypt may {{be inferred from}} the Oxyrhynchus papyri, which are dated by the regnal years of the emperor and Vaballathus. No proof of a formal agreement exists, and <b>the</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> {{based solely on the}} joint coinage- and papyri-dating. It is unlikely that Aurelian would have accepted such power-sharing, but he was unable to act in 271 due to crises in the West. His apparent condoning of Zenobia's actions may have been a ruse to give her {{a false sense of security}} while he prepared for war. Another reason for Aurelian's tolerance may have been his desire to ensure a constant supply of Egyptian grain to Rome; it is not recorded that the supply was cut, and the ships sailed to Rome in 270 as usual. Some modern scholars, such as , suggest that Cladius Gothicus had concluded a formal agreement with Zenobia which Aurelian ignored.|$|E
5|$|The role of cavalry in {{the late}} army {{does not appear to}} have been greatly {{enhanced}} as compared with the army of the Principate. <b>The</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>is</b> that cavalry was much the same proportion of overall army numbers as in the 2ndcentury and that its tactical role and prestige remained similar. However, the cavalry of the Late Roman army was endowed with greater numbers of specialised units, such as extra-heavy shock cavalry (cataphractii and clibanarii) and mounted archers. During the later 4thcentury, the cavalry acquired a reputation for incompetence and cowardice for their role in three major battles. In contrast, the infantry retained its traditional reputation for excellence.|$|E
