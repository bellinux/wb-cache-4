500|$|The Chicago Sun-Times said, [...] "Valene Ewing Gibson {{would be}} the first to admit that the past seven years have been no day at the beach. She lost her first husband to a sultry siren who applies eyeliner with a trowel. She opened her heart and her home to a nagging mother who could drive Mother Teresa to slit her wrists. She {{discovered}} a long-lost brother who just happened to be a psychotic <b>TV</b> <b>evangelist.</b> She even had a nervous breakdown that left her convinced her name was Verna, and was an 'I do' away from tying the knot with a scheming sleazeball who was well aware of her family ties to the Ewings of Dallas even if she had forgotten." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following Project Alpha, Randi {{went on to}} use {{variations}} of the technique on several other occasions. Perhaps the most famous example led to the downfall of <b>TV</b> <b>evangelist</b> and faith healer Peter Popoff, when Randi had a man pose as a woman with uterine cancer, which Popoff happily [...] "cured". In another example, Randi worked with performance artist José Alvarez, who posed as a channeller known as [...] "Carlos", who was presented on Australian TV and soon had a wide following. After this hoax was exposed, the artist was constantly approached by people who believed him to be genuine, even if he told them directly {{that he was an}} actor.

5000|$|Taylor {{followed}} that release with On the Fritz, produced by Foreigner's Ian McDonald. Fritz was Taylor's first album {{to use all}} studio musicians instead of his usual backing group. Some of the musicians who played on this album were George Small, Tony DaVilio, Hugh McCracken, Carmine Rojas, Larry Fast and Allen Childs. Fritz, keeping with Taylor tradition, took aim once again at religious leaders, such as Bill Gothard ("I Manipulate"), greedy <b>TV</b> <b>evangelists</b> (again) ("You Don't Owe Me Nothing"), politicians using religion or avoiding questions of morality {{in order to get}} votes ("It's a Personal Thing"), and public schools teaching [...] "values clarification" [...] to children, asking them to determine who should be thrown overboard in an overcrowded lifeboat ("Lifeboat").|$|R
5000|$|However, not all {{reviews of}} Ashes and Snow have been favorable. A review in The New York Times {{described}} it as [...] "an exercise in conspicuous narcissism that is off the charts, even by today's standards," [...] criticizing its colonialism-tinged portrayals of non-Western subjects and its [...] "derivative" [...] imagery. KCRW's art critic Edward Goldman referred to the exhibition as [...] "snake oil from a travelling art salesman," [...] declaring that the imagery was likely to appeal to those who [...] "are inclined to open their hearts and wallets to the rhetoric of <b>TV</b> <b>evangelists</b> like Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell." [...] Author and critic Amardeep Singh was [...] "deeply annoyed by the strong current of exoticism and artificiality," [...] finding fault with the [...] "manipulative environment of the gallery," [...] which [...] "plays up a 'spiritual' and 'exotic' atmosphere that nullifies any objective quality the photographs themselves might have." ...|$|R

The album included one complex instrumental, [...] "Theme from the 3rd Movement of Sinister Footwear", but focused mainly on rock songs with Zappa's sardonic social commentary—satirical lyrics targeted at teenagers, the media, and religious and political hypocrisy. [...] "Dumb All Over" [...] is a tirade on religion, as is [...] "Heavenly Bank Account", wherein Zappa rails against <b>TV</b> <b>evangelists</b> such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson for their purported influence on the U.S. administration {{as well as their}} use of religion as a means of raising money. Songs like [...] "Society Pages" [...] and [...] "I'm a Beautiful Guy" [...] show Zappa's dismay with the Reagan era and its [...] "obscene pursuit of wealth and happiness".|$|R

5000|$|According to Hebrew Roots: [...] "The main {{question}} of the so-called Jerusalem Council was not 'How Should Gentiles Behave?' The question was 'What Do Gentiles Need To Do In Order To Be Saved'". At {{the time of the}} Jerusalem Council, the New Testament was not yet written. Paul instructs Timothy (II Tim 2:15 and 3:15-16) to study the Word of Scripture. The only Scripture available at that time was the Old Testament. Are we to “conclude that it is permissible for Gentile believers to covet, steal, dishonor their parents, and dabble in the occult, for none of the commandments forbidding these things are specified here. Acts 15. And to say that commandments against coveting, stealing, etc. appear on other pages of the New Testament is just evading the issue, for there was no [...] "New Testament" [...] book yet in existence to instruct these believers. … Obviously James' words cannot mean that none of the Torah's commands are valid except for these four things, for the writers of the New Testament epistles, when writing years later, constantly quoted from the Torah to instruct Gentile believers. The confusion begins to clear up when the rest of James' statement is read: [...] "For Moses of old time has in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogue every Sabbath day." [...] (Acts 15:21). [...] In other words, this is similar to what one hears from <b>TV</b> <b>evangelists</b> today (paraphrased): “Go to a Bible believing church to hear the Word of God after one accepts Jesus Christ as Savior”.|$|R

50|$|For many years, <b>TV</b> <b>evangelist</b> preacher Robert Tilton {{maintained}} his {{church on the}} northeast corner of the I-35E and I-635 interchange. The scandal that ABC News uncovered in the 1990s regarding thousands of prayer requests found in the dumpster, plus the divorce of Tilton and his then second wife and fellow preacher, Leigh Valentine, caused Tilton to leave the Dallas area and his land was given to the city for re-use. During the time that Tilton's Word of Faith congregation used the church building on this site, a K-12 school named Lexington Academy provided education on the church campus.|$|E
5000|$|In November 1979 Cabaret Voltaire {{toured the}} United States, and became {{strongly}} {{interested in the}} rise of the Christian right and its use of television, especially the fund-raising broadcasts of <b>TV</b> <b>evangelist</b> Eugene Scott. They compared this to the rise of Islamism, devoting a side to each strand of religious politics on their 1980 mini-album Three Mantras. Red Mecca was a culmination of this interest. According to Richard H. Kirk: [...] "The whole Afghanistan situation was kicking off, Iran had the American hostages ... we were taking notice ... it's not called Red Mecca by coincidence. We weren't referencing the fucking Mecca Ballroom in Nottingham!" ...|$|E
50|$|Rose is {{at first}} {{suspicious}} about Terry, but Terry proves himself by slyly intimidating two drug dealers into leaving the center's area and helping {{out as much}} as he can, and Rose gradually falls in love with him. The center itself, however, is in financial difficulties, since its backer George Bealeman (Parley Baer), while claiming himself to be a faithful Christian, refuses to provide any more funds. Since he has no angel's powers, Terry uses his technical know-how to convince Bealeman otherwise: by recording and re-editing a segment from <b>TV</b> <b>evangelist</b> Rev. Barton's (Ben Slack) telecast (which Bealeman watches reverently), and fitting the cross at the rooftop of the center's church with lighting effects, triggered by his universal remote.|$|E

In The Last <b>TV</b> <b>Evangelist,</b> Cooke argued that scandals and a shift in media {{consumption}} has spelled the end for what has been known as [...] "traditional" [...] Christian media. In 2012, [...] "Branding Faith" [...] was expanded and updated and became a new book Unique: Telling Your Story {{in the age of}} Brands and Social Media.

That's the biggest backstabbing version of God I've ever...Anton LaVey's got nothing over this guy. That's pure Satanism to me. He's backstabbing God so bad it's not even funny. People are paying money for that, and believe in that. How the hell are they believing it? This guy's playing God. To me, it's pure blasphemy." ...|$|E

5000|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "For You (Intro)", which {{features}} a '50s-style intro taken from Chris Isaak's original [...] "Wicked Game". The main riff of the song is also taken from the song [...] "Bloody Hammer" [...] by Roky Erickson. [...] "For You", along with [...] "Our Diabolikal Rapture", {{are the only two}} HIM-songs to date to be co-written by guitarist Mikko [...] "Linde" [...] Lindström. The latter of the two came to be after Valo heard Lindström playing a riff, which was then modified to be more [...] "stonery". This eventually evolved into [...] "Our Diabolikal Rapture", which Valo described as [...] "progressive, yet catchy". [...] "Your Sweet Six Six Six" [...] is a love song about how [...] "when another person does you harm, but still it's so fucking hard to let go. You're not even sure if you want to let go". The title was inspired by the alleged backmasking featured on Led Zeppelin's [...] "Stairway to Heaven", where <b>TV</b> <b>evangelist</b> Paul Crouch claimed that, when played backwards, satanic messages can be heard in the song, including the phrase [...] "Here's to my sweet Satan". The use of the number 666 was seen by the band as purely [...] "symbolic" [...] and [...] "traditionally rock 'n' roll", not indicative of satanism.|$|E
