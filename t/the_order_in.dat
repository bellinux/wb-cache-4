After the investiture ceremony at Windsor is concluded, a state luncheon is held in the Banqueting Room. This is attended by the royal family, by all the Companions of the Order and their spouses, and by the Officers of the Order.

40|$|This paper {{intends to}} {{highlight}} the interaction of factors that affect <b>the</b> word <b>order</b> <b>in</b> Slovene and Italian. <b>The</b> basic word <b>order</b> is <b>the</b> same <b>in</b> both languages; subject-verb-object (SVO). However, Slovene and Italian differ in one being an analytical {{and the other a}} synthetic language, and being Romance and Slavic, respectively. <b>The</b> word <b>order</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> language pair differs in the degree of freedom one has to form different sentence variations. I will try to verify the hypothesis that pragmatic and semantic factors have a greater impact on <b>the</b> Slovenian word <b>order</b> than <b>the</b> grammatical ones, while grammatical factors have more influence on <b>the</b> word <b>order</b> <b>in</b> Italian. <b>The</b> analysis examines <b>the</b> word <b>order</b> <b>in</b> sentences with three elements, S, V and O as well as <b>the</b> word <b>order</b> <b>in</b> sentences with two elements, i. e. S and V or O and V. The VS/SV or VO/OV patterns are, again, the result of an in- terplay between pragmatic and semantic factors...|$|R
