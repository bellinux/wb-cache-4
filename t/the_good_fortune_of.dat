5|$|Despite {{giving up}} a game-winning home run in his 1988 opening day Fenway Park debut, Smith posted his best ERA in five years. The Red Sox had <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>fortune</b> <b>of</b> being in the American League's Eastern division; in September, they caught the Detroit Tigers and held off every other team to clinch Smith's second and last trip to the postseason. In Game 2 of the 1988 ALCS against the Oakland Athletics, Smith gave up three singles, {{including}} Walt Weiss' game-winning RBI single, {{in the ninth inning}} of a tied game. Boston had a 0–2 series deficit going to Oakland. After Boston lost Game 3, Smith surrendered two insurance runs after entering Game 4 with the score 2–1 to complete the four-game sweep.|$|E
25|$|Through Sir Spencer Ponsonby-Fane Brympton d'Evercy {{became a}} meeting place of cricket lovers. It had its own cricket pitch where large house parties played against local and visiting teams. A houseparty devoted to cricket took place each year, a {{tradition}} which survived long after Sir Spencer's death and into the 1950s. As treasurer of the MCC Sir Spencer laid the foundation stone for the pavilion at Lord's. He founded the Old Stagers club of Canterbury, and most eccentrically the team known as I Zingari, a wandering cricket club of assorted aristocrats and Victorian and Edwardian notables. Throughout Sir Spencer's ownership of Brympton the house and estate were maintained, but survived only through <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>fortune</b> <b>of</b> low taxation and agricultural rents. This branch of the Fane family had never been wealthy, and World War I was to bring sweeping changes to not just Brympton d'Evercy but country houses all over Britain.|$|E
25|$|The study Cognitive Neuroscience of Social Emotions and Implications for Psychopathology: Examining Embarrassment, Guilt, Envy, and Schadenfreude (2014) {{identified}} neural correlations {{to specific}} social emotions (e.g. envy and embarrassment) {{as a measure}} of cognitive dissonance. The neural activity for the emotion of Envy (the feeling of displeasure at <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>fortune</b> <b>of</b> another person) was found to draw neural activity from the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. That such increased activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex occurred either when a person’s self-concept was threatened or when the person suffered embarrassment (social pain) caused by salient, upward social-comparison, by social-class snobbery. That social emotions, such as embarrassment, guilt, envy, and Schadenfreude (joy at the misfortune of another person) are correlated to reduced activity in the insular lobe, and with increased activity in the striate nucleus; those neural activities are associated with a reduced sense of empathy (social responsibility) and an increased propensity towards antisocial behavior (delinquency).|$|E

2500|$|Collins {{was born}} the eldest of five {{siblings}} in Seattle, Washington, where she spent the first ten years of her life. Her father, a blind singer, pianist and radio show host, took a job in Denver, Colorado, in 1949, and the family moved there. Collins studied classical piano with Antonia Brico, making her public debut at age 13, performing Mozart's Concerto for Two Pianos. Brico took a dim view, both then and later, of Collins' developing interest in folk music, which {{led her to the}} difficult decision to discontinue her piano lessons. Years later, after she became known internationally, she invited Brico to one of her concerts in Denver. When they met after the performance, Brico took both of Collins' hands in hers, looked wistfully at her fingers and said, [...] "Little Judy—you really could have gone places." [...] Still later, Collins discovered that Brico herself had made a living when she was younger playing jazz and ragtime piano (Singing Lessons, pp.71–72). In her early life, Collins had <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>fortune</b> <b>of</b> meeting many professional musicians through her father.|$|E
2500|$|As one {{historian}} explained: [...] "It was <b>the</b> <b>good</b> <b>fortune</b> <b>of</b> the Republicans to have {{within their}} ranks {{a number of}} highly gifted political manipulators and propagandists. Some of them had the ability... to not only see and analyze the problem at hand but to present it in a succinct fashion; in short, to fabricate the apt phrase, to coin the compelling slogan and appeal to the electorate on any given issue in language it could understand". Outstanding propagandists included editor William Duane (1760–1835) and party leaders Albert Gallatin, Thomas Cooper and Jefferson himself. Just as important was effective party organization {{of the sort that}} John J. Beckley pioneered. In 1796, he managed the Jefferson campaign in Pennsylvania, blanketing the state with agents who passed out 30,000 hand-written tickets, naming all 15 electors (printed tickets were not allowed). Beckley told one agent: [...] "In a few days a select republican friend from the City will call upon you with a parcel of tickets to be distributed in your County. Any assistance and advice you can furnish him with, as to suitable districts & characters, will I am sure be rendered". Beckley was the first American professional campaign manager and his techniques were quickly adopted in other states.|$|E

50|$|In the {{following}} centuries, several battles {{took place in}} this frontier area. In 1048, Adalbert, Duke of Lorraine was killed at the Battle of Thuin by Godfrey III, Duke of Lower Lorraine. Many more battles followed between the County of Hainaut and the Bishopric of Liège, with Thuin caught in between. Despite the stronger defensive walls that {{were built in the}} 12th century and in the 15th century, Thuin was besieged several times. The Aulne Abbey, which had been given to Saint Bernard of Clairvaux in 1147 fared better and was even expanded several times in the 16th and 18th century. In 1654, the Spanish army under the Prince of Condé tried in vain to take Thuin. <b>The</b> <b>good</b> <b>fortunes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city were attributed to the intercession of Saint Roch, who is still commemorated in the annual St-Roch procession.
