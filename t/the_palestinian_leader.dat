As the years progressed however, Gaddafi's {{relationship}} with Arafat became strained, with Gaddafi considering him too moderate {{and calling for}} more violent action. Instead he supported militias like the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine – General Command, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, As-Sa'iqa, the Palestinian Popular Struggle Front, and the Abu Nidal Organization. He funded the Black September Organization whose members perpetrated the 1972 Munich massacre of Israeli athletes in West Germany, and had the killed militants' bodies flown to Libya for a hero's funeral.|$|E

The spokesman for the Institut de Radiophysique in Lausanne, Switzerland, where those items were analyzed, stressed that the [...] "clinical symptoms described in Arafat's medical reports were not consistent with polonium-210 and that conclusions could not be drawn as to whether <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leader</b> was poisoned or not", and that [...] "the only way to confirm the findings would be to exhume Arafat's body to test it for polonium-210." [...] On 27 November 2012 Arafat's body was exhumed, and samples were taken for separate analysis by experts from France, Switzerland and Russia. On 12 October 2013, The Lancet published the group's finding that high levels of the element were found in Arafat's blood, urine, and in saliva stains on his clothes and toothbrush. The French tests later found some polonium but stated it was from [...] "natural environmental origin".

[...] Some Israeli supporters said that Clinton never should have kissed the wife of <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leader,</b> especially after such inflammatory remarks. The following day, Clinton denounced Suha Arafat's allegations, and said that Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat had told her Suha Arafat had been referring to 'tear gas' and not 'poison gas'. The kiss became a campaign issue, especially with Jewish voters. [...] Clinton said it as a formality akin to a handshake, saying that to not have done so would have caused a diplomatic incident. [...] Clinton later wrote that the live Arabic-to-English translation had failed to convey the accurate nature of her remarks: [...] "Had I been aware of her hateful words, I would have denounced them on the spot." ...|$|E

The Israeli prime minister reportedly offered <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leader</b> approximately 95% of the West Bank {{and the entire}} Gaza Strip if 69 Jewish settlements (which comprise 85% of the West Bank's Jewish settlers) be ceded to Israel.

[...] The issue of the Palestinian right of return would be solved through significant monetary reparations. According to Palestinian sources, the remaining area would be under Palestinian control. Depending on how the security roads would be configured, these Israeli roads might impede free travel by Palestinians throughout their proposed nation and reduce the ability to absorb Palestinian refugees. Borders, airspace, and water resources of the Palestinian state would have been left in Israeli hands.|$|E

25|$|According to Khalidi {{before the}} mid-1930s the notables {{from both the}} al-Husayni and the al-Nashashibi factions acted as though by simply {{continuing}} {{to negotiate with the}} British they could convince them to grant <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> their political rights.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to explore the {{relationship}} between the secret negotiations and the public rhetoric of <b>Palestinian</b> and Israeli <b>leaders</b> leading up to the Oslo I Accords.

We hypothesized that <b>the</b> <b>Palestinian</b> <b>leaders,</b> as nonstate actors, would engage in outbidding by showing a more aggressive, backward-looking orientation in public. Israeli leaders, as state actors, would engage in frontstage-backstage behavior and display a more balanced public rhetoric. The results showed that <b>the</b> <b>Palestinians</b> focused on justice issues framed as mistrust and backward looking. This public framing was associated with retreat in the private talks. In contrast, the Israelis switched between positively and negatively framed rhetoric with forward-looking and affiliative statements correlated with lack of progress and backward-looking and mistrust rhetoric associated with progress in the talks. 27 page(s...|$|R
