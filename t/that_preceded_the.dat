5|$|As {{a result}} of their {{increasing}} isolation from the majority of anti-war anarchists, George Woodcock notes that Kropotkin and anarchists who supported his position drew closer together in the months <b>that</b> <b>preceded</b> <b>the</b> Manifestos creation.

5|$|Australia {{traditionally}} fielded its first-choice team in {{the tour}} opener, which was customarily against Worcestershire. Ring was omitted from this match, despite having replaced Colin McCool to make his Test debut in the fifth and final match against India in Australia during the 1947–48 season <b>that</b> <b>preceded</b> <b>the</b> tour of England; Ring had taken six wickets for 120 runs (6/120). Fellow leg spinner McCool and off spinner Ian Johnsonwho had been regular Test players since World War IIwere the two slow bowlers picked as Australia started their campaign with an innings victory.|$|E
5|$|During the {{artillery}} barrage <b>that</b> <b>preceded</b> <b>the</b> infantry assault, Longstreet began to agonize over an assault {{that was going}} to cost dearly. He attempted to pass the responsibility for launching Pickett's division to his artillery chief, Col. Edward Porter Alexander. When the time came to actually order Pickett forward, Longstreet could only nod in assent, unable to verbalize the order. The assault, known as Pickett's Charge, suffered the heavy casualties that Longstreet anticipated. It was the decisive point in the Confederate loss at Gettysburg and Lee ordered a retreat back to Virginia the following day.|$|E
5|$|Fillmore {{was active}} in the discussions of presidential {{candidates}} <b>that</b> <b>preceded</b> <b>the</b> Whig National Convention for the 1840 race. He initially supported General Winfield Scott, but really wanted to defeat Kentucky Senator Henry Clay, a slaveholder he felt could not carry New York state. Fillmore did not attend the convention, but was gratified when it nominated General William Henry Harrison for president, with former Virginia senator John Tyler his running mate. Fillmore organized Western New York for the Harrison campaign, and the national ticket was elected, while Fillmore easily gained a fourth term in the House.|$|E

5|$|For decades afterward, Jennings {{repeatedly}} {{admitted that}} he felt responsible for the crash that killed Buddy Holly. This sense of guilt precipitated bouts of substance abuse through much of Jennings' career. The day of the flight was later known as the Day the Music Died. Jennings sang The Stage, {{a tribute to the}} Day the Music Died. He recreated the concert performers on February 2, 1959, in order at the Surf Ballroom, starting with Eddie Cochran, then Ritchie Valens, the Big Bopper and, finally, Buddy Holly. This was the concert <b>that</b> <b>preceded</b> <b>the</b> infamous plane crash. The Stage {{can be found on the}} Surf Ballroom Winter Dance Party CD.|$|E
5|$|Heavy rains <b>that</b> <b>preceded</b> <b>the</b> storm forced {{thousands}} of gamblers along the Las Vegas Strip {{to be evacuated}} and left two people missing. The remnants of the storm later moved into the region, bringing additional flooding. Many parking lots in the resort town of Laughlin were flooded. Furthermore, the villages of Searchlight and Blue Diamond were isolated due to flooding. Several major streets in Paradise were closed because of flooding and sandbag barriers were erected alongside Caesars Palace to prevent further flood damage. In addition, record river levels were measured along the Amargosa River near Death Valley.|$|E
5|$|Henry II succeeded to {{the throne}} {{at the end of}} the Anarchy but during the revolt of 1173–74 he faced a {{significant}} uprising led by his son, Henry, backed by the French crown. The conflict spread across England and Kenilworth was garrisoned by Henry II's forces; Geoffrey II de Clinton died in this period and the castle was taken fully into royal possession, a sign of its military importance. The Clintons themselves moved on to Buckinghamshire. By this point Kenilworth Castle consisted of the great keep, the inner bailey wall, a basic causeway across the smaller lake <b>that</b> <b>preceded</b> <b>the</b> creation of the Great Mere, and the local chase for hunting.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, {{with the}} {{introduction}} of the Rbk Edge jersey, the Flames updated their look once again, replacing the horizontal striping with vertical striping down the sides. To honour the team's heritage, the Flames added the flags of Alberta and Canada as shoulder patches. In celebration of their 30th season in Calgary, the Flames wore their original jersey design for five games in 2009–10, each against a Canadian opponent. The 2009-10 version of the jersey was produced in the traditional style <b>that</b> <b>preceded</b> <b>the</b> Edge redesign; for the following season, the throwback design was adapted to the Edge format as the Flames' new regular third jersey.|$|E
5|$|Otis Ray Redding Jr. (September 9, 1941 – December 10, 1967) was an American singer, songwriter, record producer, arranger, {{and talent}} scout. He is {{considered}} one of the greatest singers in the history of American popular music and a seminal artist in soul music and rhythm and blues. Redding's style of singing gained inspiration from the gospel music <b>that</b> <b>preceded</b> <b>the</b> genre. His singing style influenced many other soul artists of the 1960s, such as James Carr and Freddie Jackson. (Woodstra and Elewine) During his lifetime, his recordings were produced by Stax Records, based in Memphis, Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} decade, Yancey {{operated}} between west coast ports and advanced {{bases in the}} Western Pacific (WestPac), including ports in Japan, Korea, and the Philippines. During that period, she also supported United Nations (UN) actions in Korea, operating {{in support of the}} initial attempts to fight the North Korean advance; in the first UN counteroffensives in early 1951; and in the final phases of activity <b>that</b> <b>preceded</b> <b>the</b> armistice in the summer of 1953. Yancey was awarded three battle stars for her Korean War service.|$|E

5|$|Smyth {{writes that}} as a result of Husky, Hitler {{suspended}} the Kursk offensive on 13July. This was partly because of the performance of the Soviet army, but partly because he still assumed that the Allied landing on Sicily was a feint <b>that</b> <b>preceded</b> <b>the</b> invasion in the Balkans, and he wanted to have troops available for fast deployment to meet them. Smyth observes that once Hitler gave up the initiative to the Soviets, he never regained it.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{terms for}} classifying individuals of low intelligence were medical or legal terms <b>that</b> <b>preceded</b> <b>the</b> development of IQ testing. The legal system recognized {{a concept of}} some individuals being so cognitively impaired {{that they were not}} responsible for criminal behavior. Medical doctors sometimes encountered adult patients who could not live independently, being unable {{to take care of their}} own daily living needs. Various terms were used to attempt to classify individuals with varying degrees of intellectual disability. Many of the earliest terms are now considered very offensive.|$|E
5|$|Development {{continued}} {{with a more}} experimental ethos until the company began {{to run out of}} capital. The Canadian government loan that had funded Polytron's prototyping phase was not renewed for their production phase. They also lost funding from the organization <b>that</b> <b>preceded</b> <b>the</b> Indie Fund as Polytron's producer left the company. Fish borrowed money from friends and family for three months to keep the company open. In dire straits, he considered canceling the project. In March 2011, the nearby Québécois developer-publisher Trapdoor offered to help Polytron, having just signed a deal with Electronic Arts to publish their own game, Warp. Trapdoor assisted with Polytron's finances and operations and offered to treat them as part of their company and let them keep their intellectual property rights in exchange for a portion of Fez earnings. Fish felt that partnership rescued the game.|$|E

5|$|Fast {{participated in}} the Rangers' {{training}} camp <b>that</b> <b>preceded</b> <b>the</b> 2013–14 season, during which he impressed New York's head coach Alain Vigneault, and head European scout Anders Hedberg. Although {{it was his first}} North American professional training camp, Fast made the Rangers roster, partially because the team needed a right-handed shot to replace the injured captain Ryan Callahan. Fast made his NHL debut on October 3 against the Phoenix Coyotes, taking one shot on goal in 10:13 of ice time. Fast played in eight of the Rangers' first 10 games of the season, playing on the fourth line and recording no points and a -5 plus-minus, before returning to the AHL to make room for Carl Hagelin's return from a shoulder injury. Observers said Fast needed to adjust to the smaller North American ice surface, and did not get sufficient minutes to do so quickly enough to remain in the NHL.|$|E
5|$|Hardenbergh's {{design was}} {{described}} as employing both Gothic elements and classical forms <b>that</b> <b>preceded</b> <b>the</b> extreme eclecticism that was to mark a later Victorian Gothic Revival period. The original plans called for the building to be constructed out of red brick, but the final execution was mostly in sandstone quarried in Connecticut, with some examples of stone from Newark. Geology Hall, built {{on the south side}} of Old Queens, was the second of three projects that Hardenberg designed for the college, following an addition to a building (now Alexander Johnston Hall) that housed the college's grammar school (now Rutgers Preparatory School) the year before. The third project, Kirkpatrick Chapel (1873), was designed to complement the simple Gothic Revival style of Geology Hall and was erected on the north side of Old Queens.|$|E
5|$|Judith Arndt, the German rider who {{finished}} second at the 2004 Summer Olympics, {{was a strong}} favourite. Arndt had recently finished first at the 2008 Coupe du Monde Cycliste Féminine de Montréal, and her form in the months <b>that</b> <b>preceded</b> <b>the</b> race was excellent. Among other contenders were UCI Women's Road standings leader, Marianne Vos of the Netherlands; Briton Nicole Cooke, who said she had greater confidence in her team on this occasion than in 2004, when she finished fifth; and Noemi Cantele of Italy. The Australian team was considered strong: it included Sara Carrigan (the defending champion), Oenone Wood (winner of the 2008 Australian Road Race), and Katherine Bates, all of whom could work on each other's behalf. Because the final leg of the course involved steep ramps, riders considered to be climbing experts (including Cooke, Vos, and Susanne Ljungskog) were favoured.|$|E
