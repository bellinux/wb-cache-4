5|$|Cold shock {{response}} is the physiological response of organisms to sudden cold, especially cold water, {{and is a}} common cause of death from immersion in very cold water, such as by falling through thin ice. The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning. The cold water can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction; the heart has <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> pump the same volume of blood throughout the body, and for people with heart disease, this additional workload can cause the heart to go into arrest. A person who survives the initial minute after falling into cold water can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they do not drown. The ability to stay afloat declines substantially after about ten minutes as the chilled muscles lose strength and co-ordination.|$|E

25|$|The {{fluid in}} the {{internal}} compartments where corals grow their exoskeleton is also extremely important for calcification growth. When the saturation rate of aragonite in the external seawater is at ambient levels, the corals will grow their aragonite crystals rapidly in their internal compartments, hence their exoskeleton grows rapidly. If the level of aragonite in the external seawater {{is lower than the}} ambient level, the corals have <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> maintain the right balance {{in the internal}} compartment. When that happens, the process of growing the crystals slows down, and this slows down the rate of how much their exoskeleton is growing. Depending on how much aragonite is in the surrounding water, the corals may even stop growing because the levels of aragonite are too low to pump into the internal compartment. They could even dissolve faster than they can make the crystals to their skeleton, depending on the aragonite levels in the surrounding water.|$|E

500|$|Bear McCreary {{confirmed}} {{that he would}} compose music for the series in July 2013. Unlike on some of his previous scores, ABC and Marvel allowed McCreary {{to work with a}} full symphonic orchestra, typically featuring 50 or 70 players, with over 90 for [...] "important" [...] episodes. Complex synthesizer programming was also used, to give the score [...] "a modern edge". Since Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. was the first MCU television series, McCreary felt there was [...] "a sense that it had to connect" [...] to the consistent orchestra sound of the films, but viewed through a television lens. McCreary composes on average 30 minutes of music per episode. Creating the main theme for the series, which McCreary also saw as Coulson's theme, was a process which took a lot of collaboration with the executive producers, who wanted a specific sound—"something big, that...belonged in the Marvel Cinematic Universe" [...] but also [...] "intimate because these aren't superheroes, these are regular people." [...] McCreary had <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> make the theme heard, given that the show does not have a traditional title sequence. By the third and fourth seasons, McCreary noted [...] "the score became a little more intense and more electronically driven... lectronics really moved to the forefront as we got into more stories about Inhumans and the digital world our characters inhabit. But the orchestra is always our foundation." ...|$|E

[...] An average length back still allows a horse to perform ambling gaits, though a very short-coupled horse usually can only perform the trot. A well-laid back {{shoulder}} and somewhat horizontal hip angle favor a longer length of stride and is helpful in horses that fox trot, while a steeper shoulder angle combined with more sloping croup produce a stride more desirable in some lateral gaits such as the running walk.|$|E

2500|$|The {{emergence}} of the new organizational strategies {{can be seen in}} the politics of Connecticut around 1806, which have been well documented by Cunningham. The Federalists dominated Connecticut, so the Republicans had <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> win. In 1806, the state leadership sent town leaders instructions for the forthcoming elections. Every town manager was told by state leaders [...] "to appoint a district manager in each district or section of his town, obtaining from each an assurance that he will faithfully do his duty". Then the town manager was instructed to compile lists and total the number of taxpayers and the number of eligible voters, find out how many favored the Republicans and how many the Federalists and to count the number of supporters of each party who were not eligible to vote but who might qualify (by age or taxes) at the next election. These highly detailed returns were to be sent to the county manager and in turn were compiled and sent to the state manager. Using these lists of potential voters, the managers were told to get all eligible people to town meetings and help the young men qualify to vote. The state manager was responsible for supplying party newspapers to each town for distribution by town and district managers. This highly coordinated [...] "get-out-the-vote" [...] drive would be familiar to modern political campaigners, but was the first of its kind in world history.|$|E
2500|$|As {{early as}} 1600 BCE, Maya civilizations were using cacao beans to produce beer, {{long before it}} was used to make the non-alcoholic cocoa common now. Though actual {{production}} methods are unknown, Friar Landa described the process of preparing beverages as involving grinding maize and cacao to a paste before adding liquids and spices. Agriculture was within man's realm in the Mayan world, but food preparation belonged to women and on an ancient ceramic vase, chocolate preparation shows a woman pouring the substance between two vessels to create the highly desired foam favored by the Maya. Pre-Columbian Andean women chewed maize (occasionally using cassava or quinoa) to break down the starch and then spit it out to began fermentation. The resulting drink chicha, is still widely available in Latin America. In the Wari Empire, archaeological evidence has indicated that elite women ran the breweries and that tradition carried forward into Incan society. Throughout the Andean region and Mesoamerica, women were the chief producers of alcoholic beverages. During the 15th century in Peru, women's lives among the Xauxa people of the Upper Mantaro Valley were changed by process of producing chicha. After the Xauxa were conquered by the Inca, women were forced <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> produce more alcohol. In Mexico, a female deity, [...] "Mayahuel" [...] was revered among the Aztec for having discovered how to extract agave sap for the manufacture of pulque. After the Spanish invasion, women in Brazil and Mexico, as well as throughout Andean territories became not only producers of alcoholic beverages, but also its main market vendors.|$|E

2500|$|Jason Matthews of Legacy Effects, {{successor}} to Stan Winston Studios, {{was hired to}} turn production designer Tom Meyer's robot designs into practical animatronic props. He said, [...] "We have 26-and-a-half total live-action robots that were made for this film. They all have hydraulic neck controls. Atom has RC [...] hands as well." [...] According to Jackman, executive producer Spielberg [...] "actually said to Shawn, 'You should really have real elements where you can.' ... Basically if they're not walking or fighting, that's a real robot." [...] Levy added that Spielberg gave the example of Jurassic Park, where Winston's animatronic dinosaurs [...] "got a better performance from the actors, as they were seeing something real, and gave the visual effects team {{an idea of what}} it would look like." [...] As Real Steel was not based on a toy, Meyer said that [...] "there was no guideline" [...] for the robots, and each was designed from scratch, with an attempt to put [...] "different personality and aesthetics," [...] according to Levy. In Atom's case, it tried to have a more humanizing design to be an [...] "everyman" [...] who could attract the audience's sympathy and serve as a proxy to the viewer, with a fencing mask that Meyer explained served to show [...] "his identity was a bit hidden, so you have <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> get to see him." [...] Executive producer Robert Zemeckis added that the mask [...] "became a screen so we can project what we want on Atom's face." [...] Damage was added to the robots' decoration to show how they were machines worn out by intense battles.|$|E
2500|$|Pittacus said, [...] "The {{measure of}} a human is what he/she does with power." [...] As an {{organization}} is developed, power has to be expressed {{to be able to}} hold the structure of the organization together and has the ability to influence others. As influence takes over, tasks will be accomplished in the organization. The types of power that are expressed will determine the type of leadership styles, traits, function, and relations used. Since there has been the description of democratic leadership throughout, {{there are two types of}} power that would fit with democratic leadership: reward and referent. Reward power gives followers something to work for and accomplish in the organization. To get followers to work for the reward it needs to have some attractive desires. The desire will create motivation in the followers <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> obtain the reward. Using the reward will create discussion in the organization and the positive feedback will have followers work harder. This allows for efficiency and time management to be used because the followers want to be the best of the best. The second type of power that could be used is referent power. This is having someone followers look up to that has the ability to influence their behavior. The use of referent power has a high follower task satisfaction and task performance [...] Using referent power shows trust is built with the leader because the leader is relational with the followers. Once leaders build trust followers will help in any way. This power can be related to relational leadership because of the idea of relationships being built in the organization. As a close relationship is built with followers, more information is exchanged in a two-way flow and it creates an established organization.|$|E
