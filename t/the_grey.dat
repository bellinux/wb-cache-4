5|$|Carl Linnaeus {{described}} <b>the</b> <b>grey</b> jay as Corvus canadensis in the 12th {{edition of}} his Systema Naturae in 1766. William John Swainson named it Dysornithia brachyrhncha in 1831. French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte assigned <b>the</b> <b>grey</b> jay to the genus Perisoreus in 1838 in A geographical and comparative list of the birds of Europe and North America, along with the Siberian jay, P. infaustus. <b>The</b> <b>grey</b> jay belongs to the crow and jay family Corvidae. However, it {{and the other members}} of its genus are not closely related to other birds known as jays; they are instead close to the genus Cyanopica, which contains the azure-winged magpie. Its relatives are native to Eurasia, and ancestors of <b>the</b> <b>grey</b> jay are thought to have diverged from their Old World relatives and crossed Beringia into North America.|$|E

50|$|He {{played in}} 7 Grey Cup games, winning 4: <b>the</b> 51st <b>Grey</b> Cup of 1963, <b>the</b> 53rd <b>Grey</b> Cup of 1965 (the {{so-called}} Wind Bowl), <b>the</b> 55th <b>Grey</b> Cup of 1967 when Saskatchewan was mashed 24-1, and <b>the</b> 60th <b>Grey</b> Cup of 1972, losing 3: <b>the</b> 49th <b>Grey</b> Cup of 1961, <b>the</b> 50th <b>Grey</b> Cup of 1962, and <b>the</b> 52nd <b>Grey</b> Cup of 1964.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Greys</b> {{had another}} {{affiliation}} with the Kincardine Bulldogs of the Western Junior C Hockey League. This affiliation ended when <b>the</b> <b>Greys</b> took {{a leave of absence}} in 2009.|$|R
50|$|The game {{begins in}} the far off future in space. The player {{controls}} a force of seedlings, and take more asteroids for the growers, mythical beings which spawned the seedlings. The mothertree hopes that by taking enough colonies for the growers, they can make them return. Early in the game, the player encounter an enemy, <b>the</b> <b>greys,</b> which has brutally attacked one of their colonies. Soon the mothertree learns that <b>the</b> <b>greys</b> have been driven mad by a disease, which forces them to attack. They also learn that another empire is attacking their empire and so the player is sent {{beyond the borders of}} the empire to find out why <b>the</b> <b>greys</b> are attacking, and deal with them. The player continues, gaining new technologies and rescuing allies along the way, to find that their enemies produced <b>the</b> <b>greys,</b> despite <b>the</b> danger that <b>the</b> <b>greys</b> would destroy them too. Eventually, the home asteroid of <b>the</b> <b>greys</b> was found. After conquering them, the mothertree analysed their remains, and found that all the enemy seedlings had the same DNA as the Euflorian's seedlings.|$|R
5|$|In older literature, the {{scientific}} {{name of this}} species was often given as C. menisorrah. The blacktail reef shark (C. wheeleri), native to the western Indian Ocean, is now regarded as the same species as <b>the</b> <b>grey</b> reef shark by most authors. It was originally distinguished from <b>the</b> <b>grey</b> reef shark by a white tip on the first dorsal fin, a shorter snout, and one fewer upper tooth row on each side. Based on morphological characters, vertebral counts, and tooth shapes, Garrick (1982) concluded <b>the</b> <b>grey</b> reef shark is most {{closely related to the}} silvertip shark (C. albimarginatus). This interpretation was supported by a 1992 allozyme phylogenetic analysis by Lavery.|$|E

5|$|The black hood helps {{distinguish}} the pied butcherbird from other butcherbirds, the Australian magpie and much smaller magpie-lark, {{the latter of}} which also has a much smaller beak. It has a higher-pitched call than <b>the</b> <b>grey</b> butcherbird and inhabits more open habitat. The juvenile pied butcherbird resembles <b>the</b> <b>grey</b> butcherbird: it has a buff upper throat and dark brown instead of black plumage.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> English <b>Grey</b> {{variety is}} very similar in {{appearance}} to <b>the</b> Dominant <b>Grey.</b> <b>The</b> original reports described <b>the</b> English <b>Grey</b> in <b>the</b> Blue series as being slate grey with a dark grey to black rump, a white mask carrying black or almost black spots and dark grey, bordering on black, cheek patches, black and white wings and an intense black tail. [...] When compared {{side by side with}} <b>the</b> Dominant <b>Grey</b> <b>the</b> English <b>Grey</b> was seen to be generally darker, with the cheek patches being particularly so. Both Dominant and English Greys were produced in the three shades of Dark, with a noticeable though slight difference in shade. <b>The</b> English <b>Grey</b> Skyblue was stated to be darker than <b>the</b> Australian <b>Grey</b> Mauve.|$|R
50|$|Anna is Strength - {{impulsive}} and violent.

50|$|This was <b>the</b> first <b>Grey</b> Cup {{and only}} one of three games to go into overtime, the others being <b>the</b> 2005 <b>Grey</b> Cup and <b>the</b> 2016 <b>Grey</b> Cup.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>grey</b> jay (Perisoreus canadensis), also gray jay, Canada jay, or whisky jack, is a {{passerine}} bird of {{the family}} Corvidae. It is found in boreal forests of North America north to the tree line, and in the Rocky Mountains subalpine zone south to New Mexico and Arizona. A fairly large songbird, <b>the</b> <b>grey</b> jay has pale grey underparts, darker grey upperparts, and a grey-white head with a darker grey nape. It {{is one of three}} members of the genus Perisoreus, a small genus more closely related to the Cyanopica genus of magpies than to other birds known as jays. <b>The</b> <b>grey</b> jay itself has nine recognized subspecies.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>grey</b> jay's range spans across {{northern}} North America, {{from northern}} Alaska east to Newfoundland and Labrador, and south to northern California, Idaho, Utah, east-central Arizona, north-central New Mexico, central Colorado, and southwestern South Dakota. It {{is also found}} in the northern reaches of the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, New York, and New England. <b>The</b> <b>grey</b> jay may wander north of the breeding range. In winter it travels irregularly to northwestern Nebraska, central Minnesota, southeastern Wisconsin, central Michigan, southern Pennsylvania, central New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. Fossil evidence indicates <b>the</b> <b>grey</b> jay was found as far south as Tennessee during the last ice age.|$|E
5|$|The theatre {{itself is}} said to be haunted by several ghosts {{including}} <b>the</b> <b>Grey</b> Lady, who was an actress centuries ago. She has been seen watching productions in <b>the</b> <b>Grey</b> Lady Box, and she leaves the distinctive scent of jasmine. She has purportedly been seen and scented in recent years.|$|E
25|$|This time <b>the</b> <b>Greys</b> {{were able}} to use a final {{appearance}} as a bit of a stepping stone. In 2000-01 they earned a first-place finish {{for the first time since}} 1987 and blew past the Guelph Dominators in the quarter-finals, earning a rematch with Cambridge. The Winterhawks had finished four places and 17 points behind <b>the</b> <b>Greys.</b> That didn't stop them from dumping Owen Sound 4-2, a bitter disappointment for <b>the</b> favoured <b>Greys.</b>|$|R

5|$|A 1947 fire {{destroyed}} the clubhouse of the Toronto Argonaut Rowing Club and damaged <b>the</b> <b>Grey</b> Cup. Many other trophies and artifacts {{in the clubhouse}} melted or were damaged beyond repair but <b>the</b> <b>Grey</b> Cup survived by catching onto a nail when the shelf upon which it sat collapsed. The trophy has been broken on six other occasions: in 1978, when it was dropped by celebrating Edmonton Eskimos players; in 1987, when an Eskimos' player sat on it; in 1993, when Edmonton's Blake Dermott head-butted it; in 2006, when the trophy broke away from its base as the BC Lions celebrated their victory; in 2012 {{when one of the}} handles broke off as the Toronto Argonauts celebrated; and finally in 2014 when trophy broke from its base again by the Calgary Stampeders after their win. The CFL commissioned a replica of the trophy in 2008.|$|E
5|$|After {{the player}} {{successfully}} obtains {{the assistance of}} each of the primary factions, a Landsmeet is called among the nobles of Ferelden. There, the player confronts Loghain, ultimately either executing him or sparing and initiating him into <b>the</b> <b>Grey</b> Wardens (causing Alistair to resign). The player also settles who will lead Ferelden against the Blight (Alistair and/or Anora) and rallies the rest of the kingdom against the Darkspawn. At this point, the player learns that due to the Taint, only a Grey Warden can slay the Archdemon. Killing it will release a demonic essence within it, which is drawn to the Taint in <b>the</b> <b>Grey</b> Warden and effectively kills them; if anyone else slays it, the essence will survive and find a new host in the nearest Darkspawn, making the monster effectively immortal.|$|E
5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>Grey</b> Cup level, the Argonauts {{have faced}} an {{assortment}} of teams in recent decades rather than any one team regularly. The Edmonton Eskimos, for years a dominant team in the league, became a rival. The two teams' five Grey Cup match-ups include an epic 38â36 Toronto loss in 1987 and most recently, the Snow Bowl victory in 1996 led by the arm of Doug Flutie. In the pre-CFL days, the Argos had a Grey Cup rivalry with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers and a cross-town rivalry with the University of Toronto {{in the first years}} of <b>the</b> <b>Grey</b> Cup championship, including the Argonauts' first win in 1914.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{anterior}} <b>grey</b> column (also {{called the}} anterior cornu, anterior horn of spinal cord or ventral horn) is the front column of <b>grey</b> matter in <b>the</b> spinal cord. It {{is one of}} <b>the</b> three <b>grey</b> columns. <b>The</b> anterior <b>grey</b> column contains motor neurons that affect the skeletal muscles while <b>the</b> posterior <b>grey</b> column receives information regarding touch and sensation. <b>The</b> anterior <b>grey</b> column is <b>the</b> column where the cell bodies of alpha motor neurons are located.|$|R
5|$|Common names include black currawong, sooty currawong, black bell-magpie, {{black or}} {{mountain}} magpie, black or sooty crow-shrike, and muttonbird. Black jay {{is a local}} name applied to the species within Tasmania. The species is often confused with the local dark-plumaged subspecies of <b>the</b> <b>grey</b> currawong (S.versicolor), known as the clinking currawong or hill magpie.|$|E
5|$|Eschrichtiids {{have one}} living member: <b>the</b> <b>grey</b> whale. They are bottom feeders, mainly eating {{crustaceans}} and benthic invertebrates. They feed by turning {{on their sides}} and taking in water mixed with sediment, which is then expelled through the baleen, leaving their prey trapped inside. This is an efficient method of hunting, in which the whale has no major competitors.|$|E
5|$|In November 2010, {{the rights}} to the Vanier Cup were {{purchased}} by sports marketing company MRX.

5000|$|It was <b>the</b> 48th <b>Grey</b> Cup game {{to be held}} in Toronto, {{the most}} recent being <b>the</b> 100th <b>Grey</b> Cup in 2012. Although it was <b>the</b> first <b>Grey</b> Cup at BMO Field, which had {{undergone}} a $120 million renovation in order to accommodate the CFL franchise, it was not the first to be held at the site - the stadium that previously stood where BMO Field was built (Exhibition Stadium) hosted twelve CFL championship games, the last being <b>the</b> 70th <b>Grey</b> Cup in 1982. It was <b>the</b> first <b>Grey</b> Cup game to be played on a natural grass surface since <b>the</b> 90th <b>Grey</b> Cup at Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton.|$|R
