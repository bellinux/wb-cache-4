In his 1986 version of the authoritative monograph The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy, Singer included the species in the subsection Latiporini of genus Suillus, an infrageneric grouping (below the <b>taxonomic</b> <b>level</b> of genus) characterized by a cinnamon-colored spore print without an olive tinge, and wide pores, typically greater than 1mm when mature.|$|E

The first sub-genus comprises the land tortoises; their zoology is summed up in a paragraph, which observes that they have a domed carapace, with a solid bony support (the term being [...] "charpente", commonly used of the structure of wooden beams that support a roof). He records that the legs are thick, with short digits joined for most of their length, five toenails on the forelegs, four on the hind legs.|$|E
500|$|Panellus stipticus is {{the type}} species of the genus Panellus, and, in Rolf Singer's {{authoritative}} 1986 classification of the Agaricales, {{it is also the}} type species of subgenus Panellus, an infrageneric (below the <b>taxonomic</b> <b>level</b> of genus) grouping of Panellus species characterized by the absence of cystidia {{on the sides of the}} gills. More recently, phylogenetic analyses of the sequences of their ribosomal large subunit genes have concluded that Panellus stipticus is closely related to the poroid mushroom Dictyopanus pusillus. The molecular analysis supports a previous assessment by mycologists Harold Bursdall and Orson K. Miller, who in 1975 suggested merging Dictyopanus into Panellus based on similarities in spore shape, stem structure, and the ability of dried fruit bodies to revive when moistened. Formerly grouped in the Tricholomataceae family, a wastebasket taxon of gilled mushrooms with white spores, P.stipticus is now classified in the Mycenaceae, after a large-scale phylogenetic analysis revealed [...] "a previously unsuspected relationship between Mycena and Panellus (including Dictyopanus)".|$|E

5000|$|Another {{discussion}} {{has been the}} <b>taxonomic</b> <b>level</b> at which the genus is recognized.

5000|$|Quantum {{evolution}} {{differed from}} these styles {{of change in}} that it involved a drastic shift in the adaptive zones of certain classes of animals.

50|$|Taxonomic units between {{subgenus}} {{and species}} are not currently recognised as official zoological names. In practice, {{a number of}} <b>taxonomic</b> <b>levels</b> have been introduced.

Below subgroup but above species level is the species complex. <b>Taxonomic</b> <b>levels</b> above species complex can be distinguished on morphological grounds. Species within a species complex are either morphologically identical or extremely similar and can only be reliably separated by microscopic examination of the chromosomes or DNA sequencing. The classification continues to be revised.|$|R

40|$|Within the {{ecological}} assessment of running waters based on benthic macroinvertebrates different <b>levels</b> of <b>taxonomic</b> resolution (species, genus, family and higher) are in use. Although assessment systems are often developed with detailed data on species level, water managers and other end-users could {{like to use}} data on higher <b>taxonomic</b> <b>levels</b> to assess {{the ecological}} quality of a water body because of limited human or money resources. The question that arises is, if an assessment system built with species level data is also applicable using data with a higher taxonomic resolution. Within the AQEM project a multimetric assessment system was developed to evaluate the ecological quality classes (from bad (1) to high (5) ecological quality) of different stream types throughout Europe. The present study focuses on the question whether the resulting water quality class changes using the AQEM Assessment Software (AAS) with different taxonomic resolutions and if yes, how large the deviations of ecological quality classes from the original classes are and if the deviations are unidirectional. For analyses data from four Austrian and two Dutch stream types were used. It is demonstrated that the assignment of a site to an ecological quality class may change if different <b>taxonomic</b> <b>levels</b> are used. Deviations in both directions (higher/lower ecological quality class) were observed. In most cases the divergence was only one ecological quality class, but also larger deviations occasionally occurred. The causes {{of changes in the}} assessment were investigated by separately looking into the underlying metrics of the multimetric system. Some of the evaluated metrics rely on autecological information on species level and are simply not applicable on higher <b>taxonomic</b> <b>levels.</b> Other metrics worked on higher <b>taxonomic</b> <b>levels</b> as well and showed more or less good distinctions between ecological quality classes. It is concluded that the AQEM Assessment Software is not applicable if data on higher <b>taxonomic</b> <b>levels</b> are used. As the deviations were not unidirectional and ranged from one to three ecological quality classes, {{it is not possible to}} include a correction factor for using the software with higher taxonomic resolution data...|$|R

5000|$|SOrt-ITEMS (Monzoorul et al., 2009) [...] is an alignment-based binning {{algorithm}} {{developed by}} Innovations Labs of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) Ltd., India.

The generated blastx output is then taken as input by the SOrt-ITEMS program. The method uses a range of BLAST alignment parameter thresholds to first identify an appropriate <b>taxonomic</b> <b>level</b> (or rank) where the read can be assigned.

50|$|Over 48,000 {{species of}} mites are described, and an {{estimated}} half million more are yet to be discovered. Acarines parasitic on livestock animals are classified to family level in the list below. The taxonomy of the Acari is complex, several versions exist, and their phylogeny {{is considered to be}} paraphyletic (originating from several ancestral lines). This preceding modern textbook considers the Acari to be a subclass of the class Arachnida. Within the Acari are two superorders: the Acariformes and the Parasitiformes. The list below (Outline classification) is simplified for this veterinary article by omitting the superorders, orders, and suborders; this emphasizes the pragmatic <b>taxonomic</b> <b>level</b> of families, together with vernacular names. Within this list, the Parasitiformes include the blood-sucking mites of birds, the hard ticks, and the soft ticks, whilst the Acariformes include the psoroptic and sarcoptic mites, the trombiculids, and the demodectic mites.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how {{the use of}} various <b>taxonomic</b> <b>levels</b> and morphological functional groups influences the interpretation of multivariate analyses when comparing macroalgal assemblages in different regions in the Northeast Pacific. We found that for intertidal assemblages, within-site variation was high at the species level and regions only became discernable from the genus level to the order level. Above order level, regions were less well distinguished. Differentiating assemblages at the genus level were similar to results from functional group analyses. This implies that various levels and morphological functional groups {{can be used to}} distinguish intertidal assemblages among regions. Intertidal strata differences could be discerned at all <b>taxonomic</b> <b>levels</b> and using functional groups. In contrast to the intertidal, only a few regions were significantly different for subtidal assemblages, independent of taxonomic resolution used. Functional grouping in subtidal assemblages yielded the same resolution as <b>taxonomic</b> <b>levels.</b> Conversely to the intertidal assemblages, strata differences in the subtidal were found at the species and genus levels and with functional groups but not at the family and higher levels. Overall, these results demonstrate differences in regional and strata comparisons in intertidal and subtidal assemblage analyses and that typically species-level analyses are not required...|$|R
