5|$|By 1963 McNamara had {{convinced}} Kennedy that the Zeus {{was simply not}} worth deploying.

In its place they decided to continue work on Nike-X. Nike-X development was based in the existing Nike Zeus Project Office until their name was changed to Nike-X on 1 February 1964.|$|E

5|$|A ten-man tag team {{match was}} {{supposed}} to take place next, but it was canceled due to time constraints. The kayfabe reason given was that the heel team (Irwin R. Schyster, The Headshrinkers, Rick Martel and Jeff Jarrett) could not agree on who would be the team's captain for the match. Their opponents were scheduled to be the face team of the 1–2–3 Kid, Sparky Plugg, Tatanka and The Smoking Gunns. Bob Holly ("Sparky Plugg"), stated in his 2013 autobiography The Hardcore Truth that the timekeeper backstage repeatedly told the referee over his earpiece to end the ladder match, but Michaels and Ramon ignored him, and kept wrestling until officials were forced <b>to</b> <b>cancel</b> <b>the</b> tag team match.|$|E
5|$|Although {{late and}} over-budget the {{decision}} <b>to</b> <b>cancel</b> <b>the</b> MRA4 was controversial as the remaining airframes {{had all been}} near completion. It {{has been reported that}} following the retirement of the Nimrod MR2 (in March 2010.), Russian submarines have been able to travel past the UK in international waters, but they could not be tracked {{because of the lack of}} suitable aircraft. In November and early December 2014 four maritime patrol aircraft operated by France, Canada and the United States were based at RAF Lossiemouth to attempt to locate a Russian submarine which had been spotted in British territorial waters off west Scotland.|$|E
5|$|At its {{congress}} {{in the summer of}} 1978, the International Ice Hockey Federation approved proposals to hold the second and third Canada Cup tournaments in 1979 and 1982. However, tensions between Canada's rival governing bodies, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) and Hockey Canada, increased after the latter body accused the CAHA of reneging on promises it had made regarding Hockey Canada's control of international events involving professional players. Hockey Canada's chief negotiator for international events, Alan Eagleson, accused the CAHA of attempting to sabotage the Canada Cup and threatened <b>to</b> <b>cancel</b> <b>the</b> tournament if the CAHA refused to compromise with his body.|$|E
50|$|On April 6, 2009, President Barack Obama's Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates {{announced}} plans to cut FCS spending {{as part of a}} shift toward spending more on counter-terrorism and less to prepare for conventional warfare against large states like China and Russia.

50|$|The Supreme Court had now decided Hartford-Empire Co. v. United States, and the {{government}} now argued that the court has power to require royalty-free licensing.

Instead, the court ordered mandatory, reasonable-royalty licensing.|$|R

5|$|At {{the same}} time, two new {{aircraft}} carriers were planned. The {{requirements for the}} intended force of four carriers meant that five squadrons of Phantoms would be needed. However, in its 1966 Defence White Paper, the Government decided <b>to</b> <b>cancel</b> <b>the</b> two new carriers, which led to reductions in the total order for the Royal Navy's Phantoms. Initially 143 were ordered, which was cut to 110, and finally just 50, with options for another seven. The intention was to form a pair of front-line squadrons, each of twelve aircraft, that would operate from the two remaining, heavily modernised fleet carriers. The rest of the aircraft would be a reserve and for training.|$|E
5|$|By around 1981 in the UK, {{the future}} for Concorde looked bleak. The British {{government}} had lost money operating Concorde every year, and moves were afoot <b>to</b> <b>cancel</b> <b>the</b> service entirely. A cost projection came back with greatly reduced metallurgical testing costs because the test rig for the wings had built up enough data to last for 30 years and could be shut down. Despite this, the government was not keen to continue. In 1983, BA's managing director, Sir John King, convinced the government to sell the aircraft outright to the then state-owned British Airways for £16.5million plus the first year's profits. British Airways was subsequently privatized in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Dresden was {{commissioned}} into service with the High Seas Fleet eight {{months before the}} end of World War I; as a result, her service career was limited and she did not see action. She participated in a fleet operation to Norway to attack British convoys to Scandinavia, but they failed to locate any convoys and returned to port. Dresden was to have participated in a climactic sortie {{in the final days of}} the war, but a revolt in the fleet forced Admirals Reinhard Scheer and Franz von Hipper <b>to</b> <b>cancel</b> <b>the</b> operation. The ship was interned in Scapa Flow after the end of the war and scuttled with the fleet there on 21 June 1919, under orders from the fleet commander Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter.|$|E

The dispute escalated {{to the point}} where Dixon threatened {{to pull out of the}} All Blacks' remaining Welsh fixtures. The WRU responded by threatening <b>to</b> <b>cancel</b> <b>the</b> fixtures if their referee choices were rejected. The dispute was resolved when the chairman of the RFU, Rowland Hill, got the WRU to accept Gil Evans (a Welshman from Birmingham) as referee for the final three matches. Gil Evans had refereed the All Blacks versus England Test and was well respected by the New Zealanders.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 for the PlayStation Vita in 2012, Marvel's new parent company, The Walt Disney Company, which {{acquired}} Marvel in 2009, chose not to renew Capcom's license with the Marvel characters, instead opting {{to put them in}} its own self-published Disney Infinity series. As a result, Capcom had to pull both Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3 and Marvel vs. Capcom 2 off their online platforms in 2013. However, in 2016, Disney announced its decision <b>to</b> <b>cancel</b> <b>the</b> Disney Infinity series, discontinue self-publishing efforts, and switch to a licensing-only model, allowing them to license their characters to third-party game developers, including Capcom. Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite was revealed in December 2016, and then released in September 2017.|$|E

During this time 20th Century Fox allowed the option to expire, so Disney began {{negotiations}} in order to acquire the rights. In 1999, the negotiations failed to work out so Marvel set the project up with Columbia Pictures. During this time, Chris Columbus and Carlo Carlei co-wrote a script together, before Mark Steven Johnson got signed to write the screenplay. By 2000, Sony decided <b>to</b> <b>cancel</b> <b>the</b> project, as the two companies reportedly could not {{come to an agreement}} over Internet rights.|$|E
