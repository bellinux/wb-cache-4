5|$|On June 13, 2011, {{officials}} in Turkey arrested 32 individuals that were allegedly involved in DDoS attacks on Turkish government websites. These members of Anonymous were captured in different cities of Turkey including Istanbul and Ankara. According to PC Magazine, <b>these</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>were</b> arrested after they attacked these websites {{as a response}} to the Turkish government demand to ISPs to implement a system of filters that many have perceived as censorship.|$|E
5|$|Imported operettas and {{domestic}} productions by both whites like Cohan and blacks like Cook, Europe and Johnson {{all had a}} formative influence on Broadway. Composers like Gershwin, Porter and Kern made comedic musical theater into a national pastime, with a feel that was distinctly American and not dependent on European models. Most of <b>these</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>were</b> Jewish, with Cole Porter the only major exception; they were the descendants of 19th century immigrants fleeing persecution in the Russian Empire, settled most influentially in various neighborhoods in New York City. Many of the early musicals were influenced by black music, showing elements of early jazz, such as In Dahomey; the Jewish composers of these works may have seen connections between the traditional African American blue notes and their own folk Jewish music.|$|E
5|$|The {{skeletal}} remains {{of more than}} 100 individuals have been excavated at Iximche, {{some of which were}} very well preserved. Unfortunately the bones became mixed when warehoused near the site after excavation and their original locations are no longer clear. Thirty-six skulls were analysed by archaeologists, of these 25 show evidence of decapitation, a sacrificial practice commonly represented in Maya art from the Classic Period. Thirteen of these sacrifices were male, seven were female and five were of indeterminate gender. Most of the sacrifices were of young adults, ten were aged between 15 and 21 years old and eleven were aged little more than 21 years old, based on skull development. It is likely that these sacrificed individuals were not Kaqchikels but were captives taken from enemy states. Less than 3% of the analysed skulls showed evidence of iron deficiency anemia, a very low percentage compared with remains recovered from Copán and Altar de Sacrificios (64% and 88% respectively). This low percentage indicates that <b>these</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>were</b> not exposed to particular dietary stress and were likely to belong to the elite class. 31% of the skulls had evidence of infection, about half of which were active infections at the time of death, although none were serious. Half of these infections left evidence in the maxillary sinus, this suggests a fairly high level of airborne pathogens in the environment. Tooth enamel analysis was carried out on 19 individuals and revealed hypoplasia in the teeth of 89% of these, indicating a high level of poor health in the first 7 years of childhood.|$|E

25|$|When ingested, these {{compounds}} {{did not always}} result in the desired outcome. Many individuals died or had psychological difficulties after taking certain elixirs. However, {{the loss of life}} may not have seemed a large risk, when compared with the promise of the afterlife. Although these elixirs were lethal or dangerous, there is some contention that <b>these</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>were</b> not ignorant of the fatality of some of the materials they were ingesting.|$|E

25|$|In a pit {{excavated}} next {{to these}} four men were placed {{the bodies of}} {{a large group of}} young women. This mass grave contained the remains of 53 females ranging in age between 15–30 years of age, arranged in two layers separated by matting. The young women show evidence of having been strangled before being arranged in neat rows in the pit. Analysis of bones and dental traits of these women have led archaeologists to believe <b>these</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>were</b> not from the same social class and ethnic group as other individuals interred in the mound. Non-metric dental traits have suggested that <b>these</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>were</b> not from the Cahokia area and were possibly immigrants new to the area. Analysis of specific carbon isotope and nitrogen isotope ratios left by maize consumption in the bones and cartilage of the women as well as pathologies indicative of poor health and nutritional stress; have led researchers to also conclude they were of a lower social status than elite burials in the mound, consuming more maize and less animal protein than elite individuals.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in September 1983, {{several young}} men {{confessed to the}} murders, {{although}} <b>these</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>were</b> often intellectually disabled youths who admitted to the crimes only under prolonged and often brutal interrogation.

As a result of the investigation into the killings, more than 1000 unrelated crimes, including 95 murders and 245 rapes, were solved.|$|E

50|$|The anatomy changes after a laryngectomy. After a total laryngectomy, the <b>individual</b> <b>is</b> {{breathing}} {{through the}} stoma where the tracheostomy opens in the neck. There {{is no longer}} a connection between the trachea and the mouth and nose. <b>These</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> termed total neck breathers. After a partial laryngectomy, the individual breathes mainly through the stoma, but a connection still exists between the trachea and upper airways; <b>these</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>are</b> able to breathe air through the mouth and nose. They are therefore termed partial neck breathers. The extent of breathing through the upper airways in <b>these</b> <b>individuals</b> varies and a tracheostomy tube is present in many of them. Ventilation and resuscitation of total and partial neck breathers is through their stoma; however, in <b>these</b> <b>individuals</b> the mouth should be kept closed and the nose sealed to prevent air escape.|$|R
25|$|U.S.-led Coalition troops {{promptly}} {{began searching}} for the key members of Saddam Hussein's government. <b>These</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>were</b> identified {{by a variety of}} means, most famously through sets of most-wanted Iraqi playing cards. Later during the military occupation period after the invasion, on 22 July 2003 during a raid by the U.S. 101st Airborne Division and men from Task Force 20, Saddam Hussein's sons Uday and Qusay, and one of his grandsons were killed in a massive fire-fight.

25|$|Narnia is {{inhabited}} by Marsh-wiggles (creatures of Lewis' own invention), and Dufflepuds (adapted from Pliny's Monopods) {{live on a}} distant island. There are also many singular beings who frequent or inhabit Narnia and its surrounding countries including: the River god, Bacchus, Father Christmas, Father Time, Pomona, Silenus, and Tash. It {{should also be noted}} that the Stars themselves are sentient beings within Narnia. Coriakin, the Magician, who rules over the Dufflepud/Monopods, and Ramandu, whose daughter marries Caspian X, are both stars who, for various reasons, are earth-bound. Both of <b>these</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>were</b> encountered in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} two decades {{following}} the ratification of the Second Amendment, public opposition to standing armies, among Anti-Federalists and Federalists alike, persisted and manifested itself locally as a general reluctance to create a professional armed police force, instead relying on county sheriffs, constables and night watchmen to enforce local ordinances. Though sometimes compensated, often these positions were unpaid – held {{as a matter of}} civic duty. In these early decades, law enforcement officers were rarely armed with firearms, using billy clubs as their sole defensive weapons. In serious emergencies, a posse comitatus, militia company, or group of vigilantes assumed law enforcement duties; <b>these</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>were</b> more likely than the local sheriff to be armed with firearms.|$|E

25|$|War criminals prosecuted by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East were {{initially}} excluded from enshrinement after the war. Government authorities began considering their enshrinement, along with providing veterans' benefits to their survivors, following {{the signature of}} the Treaty of San Francisco in 1951, and in 1954 directed some local memorial shrines to accept the enshrinement of war criminals from their area. No convicted war criminals were enshrined at Yasukuni until after the parole of the last remaining incarcerated war criminals in 1958. The Health and Welfare Ministry began forwarding information on Class B and Class C war criminals (those {{not involved in the}} planning, preparation, initiation, or waging of the war) to Yasukuni Shrine in 1959, and <b>these</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>were</b> gradually enshrined between 1959 and 1967, often without permission from surviving family members.|$|E
25|$|After the {{invasion}} of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939, Lwów initially came under Soviet occupation. During this period Weigl's institute continued to function, although Poles, particularly those escaping from the German-controlled areas, were banned from being employed there. The Soviet authorities deported ethnic Poles from the seized territories, sending them to Kazakhstan, Siberia and other areas deep within the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, despite the official prohibition on employment, Weigl used his prestige and influence (during this time Nikita Khrushchev visited the institute) to secure the release of several Polish would-be deportees {{and in some cases}} managed to obtain permission for those who had already been exiled to return. <b>These</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>were</b> then given work in the institute as either nurses, interpreters (Weigl himself did not speak Russian) or as some of the first lice feeders; people who were given the job as a means of protecting them from persecution by the Soviet authorities.|$|E
25|$|Two taped episodes {{had to be}} {{replaced}} as a contestant was related to a CBS employee and therefore ineligible {{to be on the}} show. The other contestants who appeared on that episode were awarded their prizes, but the episode was never aired and cannot be shown because of policies imposed by Barker over prizes on the show. There have been similar instances over the years of ineligible contestants appearing on stage, but <b>these</b> <b>individuals</b> <b>were</b> not edited out of the final broadcast since it was discovered in post-production. Usually, these episodes air with a disclaimer from the announcer added in post-production that one of the contestants was found ineligible (not specifying which one). Standards and Practices guidelines for game shows state that if an ineligible contestant wins a One-Bid and the other contestants on Contestants' Row at the time do not win a subsequent One-Bid, they are not considered to have made an appearance on the show and are immediately eligible again once the error has been discovered.|$|E
