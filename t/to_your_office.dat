40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the substance of}} our briefing today <b>to</b> <b>your</b> <b>offices</b> in response <b>to</b> <b>your</b> request that we provide information on various issues relating to identity fraud. Generally, identity fraud involves "stealing" another person's personal identifying information, e. g., Social Security number (SSN), date of birth, and mother's maiden name. Criminals use such information to fraudulently establish credit, run up debt, or to take over existing financial accounts. The methods used to obtain personal identifying information can range from basic street theft to sophisticated, organized crime schemes involving the use of computerized databases or the bribing of employees with access to personal information on customer or personnel records. As agreed with <b>your</b> <b>offices,</b> this document provides information on (1) law enforcement's responsibilities for investigating identity fraud and the difficulties in tracking such crime; (2) statistics or other data showing the prevalence of identity fraud; (3) the costs of identity fraud; an...|$|R
