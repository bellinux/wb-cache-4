2500|$|Lindemulder {{attempted}} to branch out into mainstream films {{early in her}} career. Her first role came in the 1988 Italian film titled Bersaglio sull'autostrada. Known as Moving Target in English-speaking countries, she was credited as Janine Linde; the film also starred Linda Blair of The Exorcist fame. She went on to act in other lower-tier mainstream films, including Spring Break USA and Caged Fury. [...] Both films achieved minimal success. Her appearance in Penthouse led to a role in a video released by that company, titled Penthouse Satin & Lace, that featured various models from the magazine. This feature opened <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> eventual debut in pornographic films.|$|E
60|$|He gladly {{accepted}} the invitation. Mrs. Callender stopped {{him as he}} opened <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|Tom humbly held <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> and she marched out as {{grim and}} erect as a grenadier.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing. I haven't done you {{any legal}} service. Almost any man you showed those papers to {{could have told}} {{you as much as}} I have." [...] She tried to gasp out some {{acknowledgments}} and protests as he opened <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> At <b>the</b> outer threshold he said, [...] "Why, you're alone!" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{laughed and}} shook her head as I opened <b>the</b> chart-house <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to pass.|$|R
60|$|Mercy opened <b>the</b> library <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> {{closed it}} again, {{and walked slowly}} to and fro alone in the room, thinking.|$|R
60|$|Capes flashed to an {{understanding}} of her intention, sprang to his feet, and opened <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> retreat.|$|E
60|$|Having spoken, {{she rose}} to retire. He opened <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> seeing {{that she needed}} rest in her own room.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, do;' and {{he opened}} <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> exclaiming, almost before she was fairly gone, 'There! you want no more explanation.' ...|$|E
60|$|The {{old woman}} made no answer, {{and left the}} stable, but the prince was at <b>the</b> <b>door</b> waiting <b>for</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|The man {{followed}} the Marquise across the bare floor, their steps resounding as they went, {{and he held}} <b>the</b> outer <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{took off}} her cloak, and Bilson, with an {{understanding}} look, did not even open <b>the</b> drawing-room <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> but ran downstairs.|$|R
60|$|And then {{he opened}} <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> and she passed on, bowing to him, and muttering some word of {{farewell}} that was inaudible.|$|E
60|$|One adorable smile {{she gave}} him, {{and before he}} could advance to hold <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> she had opened it and passed out.|$|E
6000|$|Another {{minute and}} I was {{automatically}} opening <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> As she passed {{she paused to}} do something to her dress and whispered, ...|$|E
60|$|And {{before our}} staring eyes could blink she had {{passed out of}} the room, Basil holding <b>the</b> <b>door</b> open <b>for</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1832, {{they were}} able to return to Caracas through a license granted to the family by the {{government}} of Venezuela, but it conditioned her husband to not intervene in the politics of the country. The family moved to Santa Ana de Coro, where a revolt erupted against the government, which opened <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> husband to get involved in politics once again. He was eventually able to retain a position as a senator for a few years.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, nay!" [...] she wailed in an {{extremity}} of terror. Yet {{she rose}} and went towards <b>the</b> <b>door</b> sideways, <b>for</b> <b>her</b> hands were outstretched in supplication to him.|$|R
6000|$|As Barbara {{went out}} {{she whispered to}} Alan, who opened <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> [...] "Meet me at half-past ten in the kitchen garden." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Loneliness {{is not a}} {{complaint}} from which I ever expect to suffer, dear," [...] he said, as he rose and opened <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|The hostess was all ears, {{struck by}} the respectful manner in which this very evidently noble lady {{addressed}} a Fool. I opened <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... [ENID, suppressing a retort, goes out. UNDERWOOD opens <b>the</b> <b>door</b> [...] <b>for</b> <b>her</b> and follows. ROBERTS, {{going to}} the fire, holds out his [...] hands to the dying glow.] ...|$|R
50|$|She faced {{a similar}} problem while working in another film titled Honhaar. She was cast {{opposite}} Shahu Modak as a heroine and was supposed to hug and embrace him, which she again refused steadfastly. Since the company was legally in a weak position, they couldn’t turn {{her out of the}} film, which proved to be a blessing in disguise <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> She was offered Modak’s mother’s role in the film and it clicked instantly. This opened <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to play mother roles at the young age of 18.|$|R
60|$|The {{next time}} that Mrs. Woodford heard that Major Oakshott was at <b>the</b> <b>door</b> inquiring <b>for</b> <b>her</b> health, she begged as a favour {{that he would}} come and see her.|$|R
6000|$|MRS. CLANDON. No, dear. I {{want to be}} alone. (She goes out, evidently still a {{good deal}} troubled. Valentine opens <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> and follows her out.) ...|$|E
6000|$|CATHERINE (putting {{down her}} embroidery). I daresay I had better. You will only {{splutter}} at them. (She goes out, Petkoff holding <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> and following her.) ...|$|E
6000|$|It was warm, {{and none}} of them {{connected}} her withdrawal with the reminiscences of the dairyman. He went forward and opened <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> saying with tender raillery-- ...|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>door</b> was not locked. He {{lifted the}} latch silently, and held <b>the</b> <b>door</b> open <b>for</b> <b>her</b> to pass in. Then he closed it again, {{and turned to}} the two men who {{followed}} them.|$|R
50|$|Between March and August 1868, the Duchess {{traveled}} {{in the north}} of Italy and stopped in Rome. In cure at Cauterets, in the Pyrenees, she crossed the border and traveled to Spain, where she was caught in an insurrection. Despite the dangers of this situation, she remained to Madrid where she worked with her friends, the painters Henri Regnault and Georges Clairin. She met the revolutionary General Milans del Bosch, and she modeled his bust. Letters of recommendation from Prosper Mérimée, opened <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> of <b>the</b> Prado Museum. She admired, among others, the works of Diego Velasquez.|$|R
5000|$|In 1990, {{after graduating}} from Lane Tech, Machado moved to New York City. The {{experience}} which she had gained as a performer with the Latino Chicago Theater Company helped open <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>for</b> <b>her</b> in that city. Soon, she was offered {{a job as a}} professional actress in Los Angeles, California. Machado moved to Los Angeles and in 1996, she landed her first two acting roles. She was cast as [...] "Elsa" [...] in the TV series NYPD Blue episode #311, and she was also cast as [...] "Val Cho" [...] in the movie made for television No One Would Tell.|$|R
6000|$|... "The obvious {{derivation}} of {{the word}} stunning," [...] said Mother Carey, as she rose to meet her guests in the drawing-room, and Cecil to hold <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{left the}} room, waving back Lessingham's attempt to open <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> He {{stood for a}} moment looking at the place where she had vanished. Then he turned round.|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot tell you," [...] he said, with {{a little}} sigh of relief, as he held open <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> [...] "how thankful I am that I {{happened}} to find you alone." ...|$|E
60|$|I saw my Margaret again, {{so fragile}} now, so thin the wrists, her hair turned grey. No nearer could I go, but stopped at <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> grieving <b>for</b> <b>her,</b> {{and at last}} saying her name aloud.|$|R
60|$|Freddie escorted Nelly {{through the}} hall and opened <b>the</b> front <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b> <b>The</b> night was cool and cloudy {{and there was still}} in the air that odd, rejuvenating {{suggestion}} of Spring. A wet fragrance came from the dripping trees.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{will like}} that; and now I can {{go if you}} don't mind my old gown and hat,--I have no other clothes," [...] she said, as the cow began to eat, and the footman opened <b>the</b> {{carriage}} <b>door</b> <b>for</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
