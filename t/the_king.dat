5|$|According to {{the authors}} of the 2011 genetic study, the close {{relation}} between <b>the</b> <b>King</b> Island and mainland emus indicates that the former population was isolated from the latter relatively recently, due to sea level changes in the Bass Strait, as opposed to a founding emu lineage that diverged from the mainland emu far earlier and had subsequently gone extinct on the mainland. Models of sea level change indicate that Tasmania, including King Island, was isolated from the Australian mainland around 14,000 years ago. Up to several thousand years later King Island was then separated from Tasmania. This scenario would suggest that a population ancestral to both <b>the</b> <b>King</b> Island and Tasmanian emu was initially isolated from the mainland taxon, after which <b>the</b> <b>King</b> Island and Tasmanian populations were separated. This in turn indicates that the likewise extinct Tasmanian emu is probably as closely related to the mainland emu as is <b>the</b> <b>King</b> Island emu, with both <b>the</b> <b>King</b> Island and Tasmanian emu being more closely related to each other. Fossil emu taxa show an average size between that of <b>the</b> <b>King</b> Island emu and mainland emu. Hence, mainland emus can be regarded as a large or gigantic form.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the veto}} {{question}} became central, the ministers were {{not out of}} the spotlight. Since the ministers were inferior to <b>the</b> <b>King</b> within the executive branch, <b>the</b> <b>King</b> was responsible for all actions conducted by this branch; however, the ministers were responsible for the advice given to <b>the</b> <b>King</b> when they were assembled in the Council of State. If any ministers were to dissent, according to the Constitution, they had to state this explicitly in the meeting protocol, lest they be considered in agreement and thus co-responsible. <b>The</b> <b>King</b> was above the law, but the Prime Minister and his cabinet could be tried for Impeachment for advising <b>the</b> <b>King</b> to act out an unconstitutional veto. The Impeachment Court consisted of Supreme Court Justices and elected politicians from the Lagting, and as the latter group held a two-thirds majority, an Impeachment trial with a fairly certain outcome could start as soon as the liberals won control over the Lagting seats through general elections.|$|E

5|$|During the {{fighting}} in May 1940, the Pierlot government came into conflict with King Leopold III who had taken personal command of the Belgian Army.

Contact between <b>the</b> <b>King</b> and the government became sporadic while the government feared that <b>the</b> <b>King</b> was acting beyond his constitutional powers. Like his father, Leopold was subject to Article 64 of the constitution which specified that no act of <b>the</b> <b>King</b> was valid unless counter-signed by a government minister, yet also given supreme power in military matters under Article 68. The two clauses appeared to contradict each other and gave all the king's acts in military-political matters an unclear constitutional footing.|$|E
