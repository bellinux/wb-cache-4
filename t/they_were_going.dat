5|$|Although {{many of the}} band's albums {{have been}} {{underground}} hits, they never found larger commercial success. The band were released from their recording contract with Warner Bros. Records when Warner's imprint Elektra Records folded. The release was reportedly due to poor record sales, and since then Stereolab's self-owned label, Duophonic Records, has signed a distribution deal with Too Pure. Duophonic holds the copyrights to the band's recordings, and on this label the band has released many limited-edition records. In 2009, Stereolab announced via their website that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> on indefinite hiatus.|$|E

5|$|Certain scenes, {{such as the}} {{argument}} between Giles and Buffy in the library, and Buffy's first meeting with Angel, were re-shot {{eight months after the}} first episode was recorded with both Whedon and Gellar feeling that Buffy was too angry in the original takes. Whedon subsequently teased Gellar that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to reshoot the scenes a third time. The high school used for external and some internal scenes in the series is Torrance High, the same school used for the series Beverly Hills, 90210.|$|E
5|$|Hitler's {{motivation}} for authorising Himmler's speeches was {{to ensure that}} all party leaders were made aware of these plans and actions. Thus, it would be impossible for them to later deny knowledge of the killings. Because the Allies had indicated that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to pursue criminal charges for German war crimes, Hitler tried to gain the loyalty and silence of his subordinates by making them all parties to the planned genocide.|$|E

5|$|According to the Bureau of Immigration, 54,057 Armenians {{entered the}} US between 1899 and 1917. The top listed {{countries}} of origin were Turkey (46,474), Russia (3,034), Canada (1,577), Great Britain (914) and Egypt (894). Immigrants {{were asked to indicate}} which state <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to settle in; for Armenians, the most popular answers were New York (17,391), Massachusetts (14,192), Rhode Island (4,923), Illinois (3,313), California (2,564), New Jersey (2,115), Pennsylvania (2,002), Michigan (1,371). The largest Armenian American communities at that time were located in New York City; Fresno; Worcester, Massachusetts; Boston; Philadelphia; Chicago; Jersey City; Detroit; Los Angeles; Troy, New York; and Cleveland.|$|E
5|$|After the Roman {{victory at}} Mount Olympus, the Tectosagi begged {{them not to}} attack them and asked to meet him for a conference halfway between their camp and Ancyra. The main aim of the conference was for the Tectosagi to delay the Roman attack {{so that they could}} allow the women and {{children}} to retreat across the Halys River. Their other aim was to assassinate Manlius while he was at the conference. While <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to the conference the Romans saw the Galatian cavalry charging at them. In the skirmish that followed the Galatians overpowered Manlius' bodyguard due to their numbers but were driven back when the escort that had been accompanying the Roman foragers arrived and forced the Galatians to retreat.|$|E

5|$|Custine's {{leadership}} and character, although impugned by the Tribunal, proved fundamentally {{sound in the}} field. As an admirer of the Prussian style of drill and discipline, he was a strict disciplinarian, but his soldiers actually liked him, and felt inspired by him. Custine liked to make speeches and reportedly knew the names of his soldiers. He visited men in the hospital, demonstrated blunt good humor, and was the master of repartee. His ready wit was quoted throughout his command. He did not tolerate disorder or insubordination however; when encountering a troop of volunteers in 1792, who bragged that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to teach the army the right step (make it Republican), he ordered his cavalry to surround and disarm them.|$|E
5|$|Dustin Kensrue and Teppei Teranishi {{knew each}} other from school and had played in a band called Chapter 11. Teppei {{recruited}} his skate park friend Eddie Breckenridge to play bass, who then brought his brother Riley on as a drummer. In 1998, before their first show, they realized they needed a name. Hard-pressed for time, they decided {{to go with the}} name 'Thrice' out of desperation. Thrice was initially an inside joke between the band members, and <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to use it only temporarily for their first show. However, they began to gain fans with the name, and people started to associate them with it, so they were forced to keep it.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Fightstar {{announced}} that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> on hiatus {{to focus on}} separate projects. Westaway and Haigh worked on Gunship, a synthwave group devoted to film music, and completed production of the score to Grzegorz Jonkajtys and Bastiaan Koch's short film, The 3rd Letter, with Audrey Riley. The film received several awards from film festivals worldwide. Simpson began work on solo material. In December 2010 he released an EP entitled When We Were Lions through PledgeMusic, an organisation which helps artists raise money to record music from fans. His debut album, Young Pilgrim, was released in August 2011. Simpson's solo work differed from his previous efforts, featuring a sound described as closer to folk music than to rock or pop.|$|E

5|$|Lawrence {{claimed that}} she {{received}} threats of harm against herself and her family {{if she did not}} proceed with the plan to import heroin into Australia; she gave evidence in the Denpasar District Court, that she was ordered to book a flight to Bali. She claimed she did not know why she was ordered to travel and her colleague Stephens claims he was also ordered with threats to travel to Bali by Chan, who showed him some photographs of his family, as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> about their daily lives, saying that they would be killed if he did not co-operate.|$|E
5|$|On 30 April the men {{informed}} their landlord that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to Bristol for a {{week and}} then returning to Iraq, stated that they would no longer require the flat, and arranged for their belongings to be sent to Iraq. They left the building at 09:30 (BST) on 30 April. Their initial destination is unknown, but en route to the Iranian Embassy they collected firearms (including pistols and submachine guns), ammunition and hand grenades. The weapons, predominantly Soviet-made, are believed to have been smuggled into the United Kingdom in a diplomatic bag belonging to Iraq. Shortly before 11:30, and almost two hours after vacating the nearby flat in Lexham Gardens in South Kensington, the six men arrived outside the embassy.|$|E
5|$|On 6 January 1966, Nell {{was driving}} the family car with Harry as a passenger; <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to the south coast of Queensland for a holiday.

He had {{suffered}} heart trouble for some time, and {{the shock of the}} accident is believed to have caused his death the following day. Murray was interred at Mount Thompson Crematorium with full military honours after a funeral service at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church, Brisbane.|$|E

5|$|On March 20, Parker sent a {{chartered}} Greyhound bus {{to transport}} Presley {{and his entourage}} from Memphis, Tennessee to Nashville. The session personnel consisted of guitarist Scotty Moore, drummer D.J. Fontana, pianist Floyd Cramer, guitarist Hank Garland, bassist Bobby Moore, percussionist Buddy Harman and the backing group The Jordanaires. Presley's original bassist Bill Black declined to join the sessions as he was enjoying success with the Bill Black Combo. To prevent possible disruption by fans, the musicians were initially told <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to play on a Jim Reeves session. RCA executives Sholes and Bill Bullock were joined in the control booth by Parker, his assistant Tom Diskin, A head Chet Atkins, engineer Bill Porter and Hill and Range's Bienstock.|$|E
5|$|The 5th Light Infantry {{had arrived}} in Singapore from Madras in October 1914. They {{had been sent to}} replace the Yorkshire Light Infantry, which had been ordered to France. The 5th Light Infantry {{consisted}} of roughly equal numbers of Punjabi Muslims and Pathans serving in separate companies. Their morale was constantly low, being affected by poor communication, slack discipline and a weak leadership. The regiment had been employed to guard the captured crew from the German ship, SMS Emden and reportedly attempts were made to fan the discontent amongst the sepoys. The regiment was under orders to embark for further garrison duty in Hong Kong, however rumours started that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to be sent to fight in the Middle East against fellow Muslims from the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Admiral de Grasse had {{the option}} to attack British forces in either New York or Virginia; he opted for Virginia, {{arriving}} at the Chesapeake {{at the end of}} August. Admiral Graves learned that de Grasse had sailed from the West Indies for North America and that French Admiral de Barras had also sailed from Newport, Rhode Island, and he concluded that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to join forces at the Chesapeake. He sailed south from New York with 19 ships of the line and arrived {{at the mouth of the}} Chesapeake early on 5 September to see de Grasse's fleet at anchor in the bay. De Grasse hastily prepared most of his fleet for battle—24 ships of the line—and sailed out to meet him, and the two-hour engagement took place after hours of maneuvering. The lines of the two fleets did not completely meet; only the forward and center sections fully engaged. The battle was consequently fairly evenly matched, although the British suffered more casualties and ship damage, and it broke off when the sun set. The British tactics have been a subject of debate ever since.|$|E
