No interactions were seen between the coal and biomass during co-pyrolysis. The pyrolytic characteristics of the blends followed those of the parent fuels in an additive manner.

The process has been studied under different operating conditions: nitrogen and air atmospheres, and isothermal and dynamic runs with three different heating rates from 5 K/min to 20 K/min. The experimental data were satisfactorily correlated to a n-order model with zero process order and the same apparent activation energy for all runs, but the exponential factors of the different runs depended on the initial mass and the heating rate.

40|$|Biomass is {{currently}} a promising renewable and potentially neutral raw material in relation to global warming. Grey alder (Alnus incana (L.) Moench) wood was chosen for research. Carbonization (slow pyrolysis) of the granulated modified grey alder wood is a standard pre-treatment method for physical activation to obtain valuable high-quality granular activated carbon for cleaning of gaseous emissions. Relative ratios of the main carbonization products of lignocellulosic materials (charcoal, liquid condensate and uncondensable gases) are strongly influenced by the physical and chemical characteristics of the raw materials. It {{is very important to}} achieve high charcoal yields and retain the mechanical properties of the obtained carbonized and activated modified wood granules. Recently, extensive research has been carried out in the field of the biomass thermal decomposition behavior during pyrolysis. Hydrothermally treated grey alder wood has not been investigated {{from this point of view}} until now. Therefore, the purpose of the investigation is to examine the effect of the hydrothermal treatment time of grey alder wood on the thermal stability of granulated modified grey alder wood carried out in a thermogravimetric/mass spectroscopic (TG-MS) system and a <b>thermogravimetric</b> analysis <b>apparatus</b> (TGA). The behaviour of hydrothermally treated wood during pyrolysis is completely different from that of the initial grey alder wood. By modification of grey alder wood, the cellulose and lignin content increases due to decreasing of the hemicellulose content. A comparison between the hydrothermally treated and initial grey alder wood shows that, at first, decomposition starts at higher temperatures (228 and 214 oC, respectively), the maximum of thermal decomposition is reached at a higher temperature (347 and 336 oC, respectively), the hemicellulose shoulder in the TGA peak disappears, and the yields of char are more than twice higher (35 and 12 %, respectively). The initial and modified (treatment time 1 h and 2 h) grey alder wood was studied also by simultaneous TG-MS in an inert argon atmosphere at a heating rate of 20 oC min- 1. It is found that gaseous emissions such as H 2 O, CO 2 and CO are the main products formed during pyrolysis for all samples. The differences in the gas formation were found to be due to their differences in the composition of hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin. The major part of those emissions is formed during the thermal decomposition of cellulose at a temperature of 350 - 450 oC. The formation of C 2 H 2 + and C 2 H 3 + shows that crosslinking by recombination and polycondensation reactions (formation of the so-called “pseudolignin”) occurs between cellulose and lignin during pyrolysis. The temperature intervals of the formation of these organic compound fragments are similar to those for the CH 4 forming temperature, which means that the highest charcoal yields are obtained from modified wood with the highest cellulose and lignin content comparing to the case of the initial grey alder wood. It is demonstrated by thermogravimetric and mass spectroscopic analysis that the grey alder wood after hydrothermal treatment is thermally more stable than the initial material, and the charcoal yield increases with increasing treatment time. The pellets after carbonization retain their mechanical properties and are an excellent raw material for production of high-density granular activated carbon...|$|R

40|$|Zirconium {{tetrachloride}} (ZrF 4) is extensively used in {{the manufacturing}} of zirconium metal. The concept of producing zirconium tetrafluoride from dissociated zircon and ammonium bifluoride is well established at the South African Nuclear Energy Corporation (Necsa) State Owned Company (SOC) Limited. Zirconium and hafnium are always found in the same minerals. In nuclear application zirconium is used for structural construction and as a cladding material for fuel, because of the low thermal neutron absorption, while hafnium is used as control rod in nuclear reactor, {{because of the high}} thermal neutron absorption. The methods of separating hafnium from zirconium prefer the use of ZrCl 4 than ZrF 4. This is because of the high solubility in both aqueous solutions and organic solvents and low sublimation temperature of ZrCl 4, while ZrF 4 is almost insoluble in organic solvent and has a high sublimation temperature. Thermodynamic evaluations showed that chlorinating ZrF 4 with either CaCl 2, KCl, LiCl or NaCl respectively was not favourable, while chlorinating ZrF 4 with either BeCl 2 or MgCl 2 was favourable. But due to cost consideration chlorinating ZrF 4 with BeCl 2 was not investigated. A <b>thermogravimetric</b> <b>apparatus</b> was used to investigate the isothermal and the non-isothermal kinetics of chlorinating analytical grade ZrF 4 with MgCl 2. The <b>thermogravimetric</b> <b>apparatus</b> revealed that chlorination of ZrF 4 commence at temperature above 350 °C. Isothermal kinetics of chlorinating analytical grade ZrF 4 with MgCl 2 was investigated at temperatures of 400, 450, 480, 500 °C. The reaction progressed towards completion prematurely before the isothermal temperatures were reached, due to a low heating rate of 20 °C/minutes was used to heat up the reaction mixture to the desired isothermal temperatures. As a result, the isothermal kinetics could not be determined. Heating rates of 5, 10, 15 and 20 °C/minutes were used to investigate the non-isothermal kinetics. The apparent activation energy of chlorinating ZrF 4 with MgCl 2 varied significantly when the non-isothermal kinetics was investigated. The variation was due to changes in the reaction mechanism. As a result, rate law of chlorinating ZrF 4 with MgCl 2 could not be determined due to variation of the apparent activation energy. Crude ZrF 4 prepared at Necsa SOC ltd. was chlorinated with MgCl 2, a mixture of MgCl 2 and KCl, a mixture of MgCl 2 and LiCl, and a mixture of MgCl 2 and NaCl respectively. Chlorination of the crude ZrF 4 was conducted at temperatures of 400, 450 and 500 °C respectively. The aim of chlorinating the crude ZrF 4 was to investigating the effect of the chlorinating on the purity of the produced ZrCl 4. A batch reactor was used in this study. The reactor was divided into two sections, namely the reaction zone and the condensation zone. The diameter of the condensation zone was larger than that of the reaction zone. Reactants were placed into the reaction zone and the products were collected at the reaction zone and the condensation zone. Samples were collected from these products and analysed using for X-Ray Diffraction analysis (XRD) and Inductive Coupled Plasma Optical Emissions Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). XRD was used to identify the compounds that were present in the products and ICP-OES was used to determine the concentration of the elements that were present in the products. The analysis of the results obtained showed that the highest recovery of zirconium in the products collected from the condensation zone, the sublimed products, was achieved by chlorinating ZrF 4 with MgCl 2 at 500 °C. About 80 % was recovered. About 96 % of the concentration of the impurities in the sublimed products was reduced when ZrF 4 was chlorinated with a mixture of MgCl 2 and LiCl at 450 °C.

Manganese minerals were also tested during 35 – 54 h in a fluidized-bed reactor to evaluate the evolution of reactivity to H 2, CO, and CH 4 as well as their attrition rate and mechanical strength. The reactivity of the materials decreased in the first 10 cycles with CH 4 and then became quite stable {{for the rest of the}} cycles performed with CH 4, CO, and H 2. In comparison to previously tested Fe-based minerals, lower reactivity with CH 4 was found for the manganese minerals. However, in terms of CO and H 2 combustion, their reactivity was adequately high. During the tests, agglomeration and defluidization were never found for any material. Mechanical crushing strength of the particles decreased with cycles, which led to the increase of attrition rate of some materials above acceptable levels. Nevertheless, materials with adequate crushing strength and low attrition were identified. Combining the reactivity and attrition resistance, the manganese minerals MnSA and MnGBHNE from South Africa and Gabon, respectively, can be suggested as promising materials for CLC with coal.

40|$|Namen magistrskega dela je bil sintetizirati superparamagnetne nanodelce sestave Cu 32, 5 Ni 67, 5 v matrici silike z ozko porazdelitvijo velikosti s pomočjo sol-gel metode. Za dodatno homogenizacijo in redukcijo oksidov smo sintetiziran vzorec znane sestave segrevali v cevni peči pri temperaturi 850 °C in času 12 ur v redukcijski atmosferi Ar/H 2. Nanodelci imajo zadovoljivo Curiejevo temperaturo, ki je primerna za uporabo v samoregulativni magnetni hipertermiji. Želeli smo združiti dva terapevtska pristopa, in sicer magnetno hipertermijo in farmakoterapevtsko zdravljenje. Glavni cilj je bil sintetizirane nanodelce napolniti z zdravilnimi učinkovinami (ZU). ZU (paracetamol, bupivakain hidroklorid in pentoksifilin) smo uspešno vgradili v pore nanodelcev v matrici silike. S pomočjo UV/Vis spektrofotometra smo spremljali sproščanje ZU iz superparamagnetnih nanodelcev. Vsak vzorec smo sproščali v vsaj dveh paralelkah po 180 minut. Pomerjene {{absorbance}} smo preračunali v koncentracije oziroma deleže sproščenih ZU po določenih časovnih intervalih. Sintetizirane nanodelce sestave Cu 32, 5 Ni 67, 5 smo okarakterizirali s pomočjo rentgenske praškovne difrakcije (RTG), termogravimetrične analize (TGA/SDTA), Fourier transformirane infrardeče spektroskopije (FTIR), transmisijske elektronske mikroskopije (TEM) in magnetnih meritev. Površino, volumen in velikost por smo določili z BET analizo. Curiejevo temperaturo smo določili s pomočjo termogravimetrične aparature (TGA/SDTA), ki smo jo opremili s permanentnim magnetom. Superparamagnetni nanodelci so uporabni na področju magnetne hipertermije, kot tudi na področju aktivnega farmakoterapevtskega zdravljenja. The {{aim of this}} master 2 ̆ 7 s thesis was {{to synthesize}} superparamagnetic nanoparticles with the composition Cu 32, 5 N 67, 5 in a silica matrix with narrow size distribution by sol-gel method. Following additional homogenization and oxidation-reduction, the synthesized specimen of known composition was heated in a tube furnace at 850 °C for 12 hours in an Ar/H 2 reduction atmosphere. The nanoparticles possess a satisfactory Curie temperature, suitable for use in self-regulatory magnetic hyperthermia. We wanted to combine two therapeutic approaches: magnetic hyperthermia and pharmaco-therapeutic therapy. The main objective was to charge nanoparticles with active substances. Furthermore, these active substances (paracetamol, bupivacaine hydrochloride and pentoxifylline) were successfully introduced into pores of nanoparticles in silica matrix. We closely followed the release of active substances from superparamagnetic nanoparticles using a UV/Vis spectrophotometer. Every specimen was released {{in at least two}} replicates 180 minutes each. Measured absorbance values were converted into concentrations and proportions of released active substances after specified time intervals, respectively. Synthesized nanoparticles with the composition Cu 32, 5 N 67, 5 were characterized using the X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA/SDTA), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and magnetic measurements. The surface, volume and size of pores were defined with the BET analysis. Furthermore, the Curie temperature was determined with the <b>thermogravimetric</b> <b>apparatus</b> (TGA/SDTA), equipped with a permanent magnet. Superparamagnetic nanoparticles are applicable in the field of magnetic hyperthermia, {{as well as in the}} field of active pharmaco-therapeutic therapy...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Pressure {{is one of}} {{the less}} studied {{parameters}} in respect to its effect on the pyrolysis of biomass. Most of the understanding of this effect is qualitative in nature. Very little insight has been reported in the literature, into the intrinsic physical and chemical processes governing the effect of pressure on the pyrolytic behaviour of biomass and its main structural components (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin). The lack of a well scrutinised mechanistic model, able to account for the effect of pressure during biomass pyrolysis, reflects the present state of art in the field. This has hindered the development of suitable biomass thermal-converter unit operations functioning under optimised pressure, temperature and residence time, able to produce desirable products. These outputs may include the attainment of a specific phase partition (char, bio-oil and gases) and manipulation of the composition of these phases. Aiming to fill this important gap in knowledge, the primary objective of the present research was to investigate the effect of pressure and vapour-phase residence time on the pyrolysis characteristics of biomass. In pursuing this objective, we have designed and assembled a flexible fixed-bed high pressure experimental rig. Subsequently, we have deployed the rig to perform experiments on wood chips of biomass samples of eucalypt (Eucalyptus acmenoides) sapwood and heartwood, camphor (Cinnamomum camphora) heartwood, pine (Pine radiata) sapwood, and sugar cane bagasse (Saccharum officinanum). We have also undertaken experiments on commercial and experimentally extracted components of biomass (cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin). Our experiments comprised a thermal treatment which included a heating rate of 5 °C/min and Tmax of 450 °C, under an inert purge gas atmosphere of N 2. We have executed parameterised experiments varying pressure (from 0. 1 to 1. 0 MPa) and vapour-phase residence time (0. 6, 1. 5, and 15 min). We have also carried out experiments on a high-pressure thermo-gravimetric apparatus, under operating conditions similar to those deployed in the experimental rig. The analytical instrumentation consisted of a micro gas chromatograph, allowing on-line analysis and quantification of the gaseous species, and a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer to perform qualitative and quantitative analysis of the tarry fraction. Proximate and ultimate analyses of samples and pyrolysis products were performed using standard analytical techniques. From this set of experiments, we were able to demonstrate a dependence of product phase yields (char, tar and gases), their composition, and their quality on the structural composition of woody biomass. We have found that lignin contributes the most, and cellulose the least to the formation of char. We have also demonstrated that high pressures and long vapour-phase residence times act concomitantly to produce a high yield of char and gases, as a consequence of a reduction in the yield of tar. Cellulose responded to increasing pressure, by enlarging the yield of char, as a result of secondary decomposition of levoglucosan. Levoglucosan forms during the thermal decomposition of cellulose and, at high temperature and under mass transport limitation (high pressure, and high residence time, for instance), easily decomposes to secondary char and gases. We then concluded that, from a technological perspective, biomass materials of large lignin content submitted to high pressure and elevated vapour phase residence timeoffer promising potential for production of high yield and high quality char. We have demonstrated that high pressure and long residence times act by altering the overall gas and tar compositions, as well as the char quality. In regard to the gas phase, we have concluded that, high pressure and long residence times promote the formation of CO 2 (mainly from the carbohydrate fraction) in comparison to the formation of CH 4 and CO. With respect to the condensed phase, we have established that Class I compounds in wood tar (cellulose and hemicellulose-derived compounds) experienced a drastic reduction in their yield at elevated pressure and prolonged residence time. In contrast, species comprising Class III (aromatic and polycyclic compounds) increased their abundances. The char quality, represented by the content of fixed carbon, rose at elevated pressures. We have also demonstrated experimentally that, biomass materials characterised by high lignin content tend to produce higher yields of primary char, which contains a relatively high percentage of fixed carbon. We have developed of a novel Arrhenius-type expression describing the rate of formation of secondary char and gases, based on a microscopic mass balance of the species produced in the pyrolysis of cellulose. The model is based on an extended Broido-Shafizadeh semi-global mechanistic approach that incorporates the secondary decomposition of vapour tar into secondary char and gases. The model accounts for the interplay between the kinetics and mass transfer during the pyrolysis of cellulose at high pressures. We have applied a similar approach, based on the Koufopanos et al. semi-global mechanism, to the remaining two structural components of biomass (hemicelluloses and lignin). The kinetic rate parameters (and the mass transport coefficient) for the extended stage 3, the thermal decomposition of vapour tar into secondary char and gases, were then determined for all three biomass structural components. Our result constitutes one of few attempts to describe quantitatively the effect of pressure on the decomposition of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin, contributing to progress in the field. Based on the observation that decomposition of individual components of biomass is well described by individual models, we have succeeded to develop a kinetic model that accounts for the thermal decomposition of the entire woody biomass. Relying on the evidence gathered from the experiments carried out both on our experimental rig and on the high-pressure <b>thermogravimetric</b> <b>apparatus,</b> we have concluded that the superposition principle satisfactorily describes the pyrolysis of biomass, both at low and high pressure. This salient conclusion underpinned the development of a complete pressure-dependent kinetic model for the pyrolysis of woody biomass that requires as inputs only the biomass composition, in terms of cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin content. The model fits well experimental measurements for hardwood and softwood biomass species, confirming the validity of the superposition principle...|$|E
