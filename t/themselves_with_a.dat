5|$|Beauchamp {{was convicted}} of the murder and sentenced to hang. The morning of the execution, {{he and his wife}} {{attempted}} a double suicide by stabbing <b>themselves</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> knife she had smuggled into prison. She was successful; he was not. Beauchamp was rushed to the gallows before he could bleed to death, and was hanged on July 7, 1826. The bodies of Jereboam and Anna Beauchamp were arranged in an embrace and buried in a single coffin, as they had requested. The Beauchamp–Sharp Tragedy inspired fictional works such as Edgar Allan Poe's unfinished play, Politian, and Robert Penn Warren's World Enough and Time (1950).|$|E
5|$|Magnetic fields {{have been}} {{detected}} in the space around just about every class of celestial object. Star formation in spiral galaxies can generate small-scale dynamos, generating turbulent magnetic field strengths of around 5–10μG. The Davis–Greenstein effect causes elongated dust grains to align <b>themselves</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> galaxy's magnetic field, resulting in weak optical polarization. This {{has been used to}} show ordered magnetic fields exist in several nearby galaxies. Magneto-hydrodynamic processes in active elliptical galaxies produce their characteristic jets and radio lobes. Non-thermal radio sources {{have been detected}} even among the most distant, high-z sources, indicating the presence of magnetic fields.|$|E
5|$|Most millipedes are slow-moving detritivores, eating {{decaying}} {{leaves and}} other dead plant matter. Some eat fungi or suck plant fluids, {{and a small}} minority are predatory. Millipedes are generally harmless to humans, although some can become household or garden pests, especially in greenhouses where they can cause severe damage to emergent seedlings. Most millipedes defend <b>themselves</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> variety of chemicals secreted from pores along the body, although the tiny bristle millipedes are covered with tufts of detachable bristles. Reproduction in most species is carried out by modified male legs called gonopods, which transfer packets of sperm to females.|$|E

5|$|The Tolostobogii {{occupied}} Mount Olympus, {{while the}} Tectosagi and the Trocmi went to another mountain. On Mount Olympus, the Galatians had fortified <b>themselves</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> ditch and other defensive works. For {{the first two}} days, the Romans scouted the mountains. On the third day, the Romans attacked the Galatian position with their skirmishers. At first the battle was evenly matched but when the fighting came to close range, the superior Roman weapons and armour won them the battle. The battle turned to a massacre for the Galatians when the Romans stormed their camp. The Galatians lost some 10,000 men and had around 40,000 captured during the aftermath.|$|E
5|$|An {{investigation}} soon revealed Beauchamp as the killer, {{and he was}} apprehended at {{his home}} in Glasgow, four days after the murder. He was tried, convicted, and sentenced to death by hanging. He was granted a stay of execution to allow him to write a justification of his actions. Anna Cooke-Beauchamp was tried for complicity in the murder, but was acquitted for lack of evidence. Her devotion to Beauchamp prompted her to stay in his cell with him, where the two attempted a double suicide by drinking laudanum shortly before the execution. This attempt failed. On the morning of the execution, the couple again attempted suicide, this time by stabbing <b>themselves</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> knife Anna had smuggled into the cell. When the guards discovered them, Beauchamp was rushed to the gallows, where he was hanged before he could die of his stab wound. He was the first person legally executed in the state of Kentucky. Anna Cooke-Beauchamp died from her wounds shortly before her husband was hanged. In accordance with their wishes, the couple's bodies were positioned in an embrace when buried in the same coffin.|$|E

5|$|In July 1799, Baranov {{returned}} to Sitka Sound on the brig Oryol and established {{the settlement of}} Arkhangelsk, also known as Fort Archangel Gabriel. In June 1802, Tlingit warriors attacked the settlement and killed or captured most of the 150 Russians and Aleuts living there. Baranov led an armed expedition to retake Sitka by force in June 1804. The Russian warship Neva joined Baranov at Sitka. A new Russian fort was established while the Tlingit prepared to defend <b>themselves</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> well-armed fort of their own. Tension rapidly escalated into skirmishes and negotiations broke down. In early October, the Russians attacked the Tlingit fort with cannon from the Neva and from a land party. The Tlingit responded with powerful gun and cannon fire of their own. The Battle of Sitka continued for several days until the Tlingit abandoned their fort and left the area. Tlingit accounts of the battle refuse to admit defeat or give the Russians credit for taking the Tlingit fort. The Russians destroyed the abandoned Tlingit fort and named the new Russian fort Novo-Arkhangelsk (New Archangel), also known as Fort Archangel Michael and Fort Saint Michael. The confrontations at Sitka in 1802 and 1804 {{played a significant role}} in subsequent Tlingit-Russian relations for generations.|$|E
5|$|Observations of the Rodrigues {{solitaire}} in life {{indicate that}} they were highly territorial. They presumably settled disputes by striking each other with their wings; to aid this purpose, they used the knobs on their wrists. Fractures in their wing bones also {{indicate that they}} were used in combat. It has also been suggested that these fractures {{may have been the}} result of a hereditary bone disease rather than battle-injuries. But in all extant birds where carpal spurs and knobs are present, these are used as weapons without exceptions. Though some dodo bones have been found with healed fractures, it had weak pectoral muscles and more reduced wings in comparison with the Rodrigues solitaire. Since Rodrigues receives less rainfall and has more seasonal variation than Mauritius, which would have affected the availability of resources on the island, the Rodrigues solitaire would have more reason to evolve aggressive territorial behaviour. Several accounts state that they also defended <b>themselves</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> powerful bite.|$|E
5|$|The bridge {{has had a}} long {{association}} with French monarchs seeking to associate <b>themselves</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> symbol of Roman imperial power. King Charles IX of France visited in 1564 during his Grand Tour of France and was greeted with a grand entertainment laid on by the Duc d'Uzès. Twelve young girls dressed as nymphs came out of a cave by the riverside near the aqueduct and presented the king with pastry and preserved fruits. A century later, Louis XIV and his court visited the Pont du Gard during a visit to Nîmes in January 1660 shortly after the signature of the Treaty of the Pyrenees. In 1786 his great-great-great-grandson Louis XVI commissioned the artist Hubert Robert to produce a set of paintings of Roman ruins of southern France to hang in the king's new dining room at the Palace of Fontainebleau, including a picture depicting the Pont du Gard in an idealised landscape. The commission was meant to reassert the ties between the French monarchy and the imperial past. Napoleon III, in the mid-19th century, consciously identified with Augustus and accorded great respect to Roman antiquities; his patronage of the bridge's restoration in the 1850s was essential to its survival.|$|E

5|$|With Piper's departure, Paul McDermott, who {{performed}} {{at one of}} DAAS's regular clubs, was invited to join. He accepted, {{although he did not}} like their material, which he considered too sweet. Fidler says McDermott changed the group's dynamic; he wrote the majority of their songs and prompted a darker tone. After winning the Pick of the Fringe award at the 1986 Adelaide Fringe Festival, the group relocated from Canberra to Melbourne, where they based <b>themselves</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> regular gig at the Prince Patrick Hotel in Collingwood, in an effort to save enough money to travel to the Edinburgh Fringe. Initially DAAS found that Melbourne audiences did not respond to their act and to provoke a reaction they became more aggressive, with McDermott and Ferguson adopting more abusive personas and often picking on Fidler's naturally happy but stupid character. They made their first overseas performance at the Edinburgh Fringe in 1987, to sold out crowds.|$|E
