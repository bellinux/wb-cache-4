5|$|Various Taliban {{supplies}} were seized by coalition forces following the battle. On 13 December, British and Afghan army units located bomb factories and weapons caches {{as they moved}} further into the outskirts of Musa Qala and searched Taliban positions. At the same time, the first civilians started {{to return to the}} area, some with reports of Taliban punishments and claims of active Pakistani and Arab jihadis. A new orientation of British strategy in Helmand is <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> to curb the influence of local drug barons, whose trade supports the insurgents. On 16 December, British troops burned an estimated £150 to £200 million worth of heroin that had been found in a drug factory and other buildings in Musa Qala.|$|E

5|$|After resigning, Aqil left Galilee for Tell el-Hesi in {{the region}} of Gaza. Around this time, Aqil married off a {{daughter}} of his to the leading Bedouin sheikh of the area, Rabbah al-Wahaidi. Bedouin raiding, now with the participation of the smaller tribes of Galilee, resumed not long after Aqil's resignation and concerns by the local merchants and European consuls were voiced to Kapuli Pasha due to the incoming harvest season for cotton and grain from Galilee and Hauran. Hasan Effendi sought to stem the tide of looting by attempting to play one Bedouin tribe off of the other. Kapuli Pasha was doubtful of this policy's effectiveness and strove <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> instead. He personally led a contingent of troops in Galilee and ensured a peaceful harvest through the end of 1863. However, Kapuli Pasha determined that he could not keep a large, permanent military contingent in Galilee and decided to reinstate Aqil to his former position after lobbying from the British consul of Haifa.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{faced the}} most {{important}} decision of his career: to prevent reinforcement at Fort Sumter or to let it take place. He and his cabinet decided to demand that the Federal garrison surrender and, if this was refused, <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> to prevent reinforcement before the fleet arrived. Major Anderson did not surrender. With Jefferson Davis's endorsement, Beauregard began the bombarding of the fort in the early dawn of April 12. The Confederates continued their artillery attack on Fort Sumter until it surrendered on April 14. No one {{was killed in the}} artillery duel, but the attack on the U.S. fortress meant the fighting had started. President Lincoln called up state militia to march south to recapture Federal property. In the North and South, massive rallies were held to demand immediate war. The Civil War had begun.|$|E
5|$|In 269, while Claudius Gothicus (Gallienus' successor) was {{defending}} {{the borders of}} Italy and the Balkans against Germanic invasions, Zenobia was cementing her authority; Roman officials in the East were caught between loyalty to the emperor and Zenobia's increasing demands for allegiance. The timing and rationale of the queen's decision <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> to strengthen her authority in the East is unclear; scholar Gary K. Young suggested that Roman officials refused to recognize Palmyrene authority, and Zenobia's expeditions were intended to maintain Palmyrene dominance. Another factor {{may have been the}} weakness of Roman central authority and its corresponding inability to protect the provinces, which probably convinced Zenobia {{that the only way to}} maintain stability in the East was to control the region directly. Historian Jacques Schwartz tied Zenobia's actions to her desire to protect Palmyra's economic interests, which were threatened by Rome's failure to protect the provinces. Also, according to Schwartz, the economic interests conflicted; Bostra and Egypt received trade which would have otherwise passed through Palmyra. The Tanukhids near Bostra and the merchants of Alexandria probably attempted to rid themselves of Palmyrene domination, triggering a military response from Zenobia.|$|E
5000|$|The bayonet {{has become}} a symbol of {{military}} power. The term [...] "at the point of a bayonet" [...] refers <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> or action <b>to</b> accomplish, maintain, or defend something (cf. Bayonet Constitution). Undertaking a task [...] "with fixed bayonets" [...] has this connotation of no room for compromise and is a phrase used particularly in politics.|$|R
40|$|Civil-military {{relations}} {{are vital to}} the coherence and effectiveness of post-conflict peacebuilding, but have often been problematic. This article argues that civil-military issues vary systematically {{in relation to the}} particular civil and military actors in peacebuilding, and that the coercive content of the external military's mission creates special challenges in each of these sets of relationships. Given the significance of the military footprint, the article presents trade-offs for policymakers intending <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> make peace...|$|R
50|$|On the {{following}} day, October 21, 1803, the Senate authorized Jefferson to {{take possession of}} the territory and establish a temporary military government. In legislation enacted on October 31, Congress made temporary provisions for local civil government to continue as it had under French and Spanish rule and authorized the President <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>forces</b> <b>to</b> maintain order. Plans were also set forth for several missions to explore and chart the territory, the most famous being the Lewis and Clark Expedition.|$|R

25|$|As {{a direct}} result of the Crisis and in order to prevent further Soviet {{expansion}} in the region, Eisenhower asked Congress on 5 January 1957 for authorization <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> if requested by any Middle Eastern nation to check aggression and, second, to set aside $200million to help Middle Eastern countries that desired aid from the United States. Congress granted both requests and this policy became known as the Eisenhower Doctrine.|$|E
25|$|Bush's four {{reasons for}} the {{invasion}} provided sufficient justification to establish bipartisan Congressional approval {{and support for the}} invasion. However, the secrecy before initiation, the speed and success of the invasion itself, and U.S. public support for it (80% public approval) did not allow Democrats to object to Bush's decision <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>force.</b> One contemporary study suggests that Bush decided to invade for domestic political reasons, citing scarce strategic reasoning for the U.S. to invade and immediately withdraw without establishing the structure to enforce the interests that Bush used to justify the invasion.|$|E
50|$|Sir Robert Peel came up {{with nine}} {{principles}} to modern law enforcement in 1829, known as the Peelian Principles. Peel's principles explain {{that there is an}} alternative <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>military</b> <b>force,</b> in that police are there to prevent crimes. Police need to gain willing cooperation from the public and will lose public cooperation proportionately to the amount of force used in situations. The police need to maintain relationships with the public and keep their respect. These principles provide a basis for community policing in the current U.S. law enforcement.|$|R
5000|$|Left-wing critics {{insisted that}} the party's stubbornness about keeping the {{settlements}} was an [...] "obstacle to peace", while right-wing critics said the NRP did not pressure the Israeli government enough <b>to</b> <b>use</b> more <b>military</b> <b>force</b> against Palestinian terrorism.|$|R
2500|$|While France lost {{political}} control of Acadia in 1713, the Mí'kmaq did not concede {{land to the}} British. [...] Along with some Acadians, the Mi'kmaq from time <b>to</b> time <b>used</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> <b>to</b> resist the British. [...] This was particularly evident in the early 1720s during Dummer's War but hostilities were brought to a close by a treaty signed in 1726.|$|R
25|$|In foreign policy, Johnson {{escalated}} American {{involvement in}} the Vietnam War. In 1964, Congress passed the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, which granted Johnson the power <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> in Southeast Asia without having to ask for an official declaration of war. The number of American military personnel in Vietnam increased dramatically, from 16,000 advisors in non-combat roles in 1963 to 525,000 in 1967, many in combat roles. American casualties soared and the peace process bogged down. Growing unease with the war stimulated a large, angry antiwar movement based especially on university campuses.|$|E
25|$|By 1985, when Aspin became {{chairman}} of the Armed Services Committee, he was recognized as a leading defense authority. His chairmanship caused controversy among some House Democrats, particularly because he supported the Reagan administration's policies on the MX missile and aid to the Nicaraguan Contras. Although temporarily removed from his committee chair by his Democratic colleagues in January 1987, Aspin weathered the crisis and regained the chairmanship three weeks later. He again broke with many Democrats in January 1991 when he issued a paper supporting the Bush administration's intention <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> to drive the Iraqis from Kuwait. The accuracy of his prediction that the United States could win a quick military victory with light casualties added to {{his reputation as a}} military expert.|$|E
25|$|Some foreign {{observers}} thought traditionalism was {{no longer}} a strong force in Saudi Arabia. This idea was disproved when at least 500 dissidents invaded and seized the Grand Mosque in Mecca on 20 November 1979. When the first news of the attack in Mecca reached Riyadh, the initial reaction of King Khalid was to consult the ulama, in order to get permission <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> to eject the attackers. The ulama hesitated and refrained from a definite answer. Only after the assault had been underway for 36 hours did some ulama allow the use of force. At the time of the event, Crown Prince Fahd was in Tunisia for a meeting of the Arab Summit and then commander of National Guard Prince Abdullah was in Morocco for an official visit. Therefore, King Khalid assigned the responsibility to Prince Sultan, then minister of defense and Prince Nayef, then minister of interior, to deal with the incident.|$|E
40|$|We test {{traditional}} {{assumptions about}} the volatility of mass opinion in times of national crises using data about views of terrorism from national surveys of the United States general public in 1995 and 1997, findings from a national survey immediately following {{the terrorist attacks of}} September 11, 2001 (9 / 11), and panel data from a follow-up survey in 2002. We compare public assessments of the threat of terrorism, willingness to restrict speech to prevent terrorism, support for employing conventional <b>military</b> <b>force</b> against countries that support terrorism, and levels of certainty about culpability required prior <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>military</b> <b>force.</b> Results show stable and measured public views prior to 9 / 11, immediately following the events of that date, and in the subsequent year. Our findings support democratic and modernist theories of public capacities while challenging long-standing traditional precepts about widespread volatility of mass public opinion.

25|$|On July 14, 1832, before Calhoun had {{resigned}} the Vice Presidency {{in order to}} run for the Senate where he could more effectively defend nullification, Jackson signed into law the Tariff of 1832. This compromise tariff received the support of most northerners and half of the southerners in Congress. The reductions were too little for South Carolina, and on November 24, 1832, a state convention adopted the Ordinance of Nullification, which declared that the Tariffs of 1828 and 1832 were unconstitutional and unenforceable in South Carolina after February 1, 1833. Military preparations to resist anticipated federal enforcement were initiated by the state. On March 1, 1833, Congress passed both the Force Bill—authorizing the President <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>forces</b> against South Carolina—and a new negotiated tariff, the Compromise Tariff of 1833, which was satisfactory to South Carolina. The South Carolina convention reconvened and repealed its Nullification Ordinance on March 15, 1833, but three days later nullified the Force Bill as a symbolic gesture to maintain its principles.|$|R
500|$|United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld {{attempted}} to meet Tshombe for negotiations in Northern Rhodesia, {{but on the}} night of 17 September his plane crashed, killing all aboard. Hammarskjöld's untimely death, combined with an overall rise in tensions, helped rally international support for a more robust peacekeeping approach. His replacement, U Thant, was less averse <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> in the Congo and believed that the UN should intervene in internal Congolese affairs. Thant promptly requested that the Security Council grant ONUC a stronger mandate. This {{came in the form of}} a resolution on 24 November, which maintained the goals of previous ONUC resolutions and cleared up any remaining ambiguities surrounding the role and nature of the UN's intervention. It reaffirmed ONUC's ability to detain and deport foreign military personnel and mercenaries with force, described Katanga's secessionist activities as illegal, and declared the UN's support for the central government of the Congo in its efforts to [...] "maintain law and order and national integrity".|$|R
25|$|The VOC traded {{throughout}} Asia. Ships {{coming into}} Batavia from the Netherlands carried supplies for VOC settlements in Asia. Silver and copper from Japan {{were used to}} trade with India and China for silk, cotton, porcelain, and textiles. These products were either traded within Asia for the coveted spices or brought back to Europe. The VOC was also instrumental in introducing European ideas and technology to Asia. The Company supported Christian missionaries and traded modern technology with China and Japan. A more peaceful VOC trade post on Dejima, an artificial {{island off the coast}} of Nagasaki, was for more than two hundred years the only place where Europeans were permitted to trade with Japan. When the VOC tried <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> to make Ming dynasty China open up to Dutch trade, the Chinese defeated the Dutch in a war over the Penghu islands from 1623–24, forcing the VOC to abandon Penghu for Taiwan. The Chinese defeated the VOC again at the Battle of Liaoluo Bay in 1633.|$|E
500|$|On 21 February 1961 the UN Security Council {{passed a}} {{resolution}} permitting ONUC <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> to prevent civil war, make arrests, halt military operations, arrange ceasefires, and deport foreign military personnel. Under the authorisation of this resolution, UN forces launched Operation Rumpunch and Operation Morthor (sometimes referred to as [...] "Round One" [...] of UN-Katangese conflict) {{with the aim of}} securing their own positions in Katanga and eliminating the presence of mercenaries. The former, though limited in scope, was largely successful, but the latter failed to achieve its objectives. As Morthor was underway, Special Representative Conor Cruise O'Brien announced, [...] "The secession of Katanga has ended." [...] This statement was quickly realised to be premature; Katanga fought the offensive to a stalemate.|$|E
500|$|Ryan was a [...] "reliable {{supporter}} of the [...] administration's foreign policy priorities". Ryan voted for the 2002 Iraq Resolution, authorizing President George W.

[...] In May 2012, he voted for H.R. 4310, which increased defense spending by $8 billion, including spending for the War in Afghanistan and for weapon systems. In 2012, Ryan explained his support for defense spending sequestration {{in the hope that}} this would open common ground with the Democrats on deficit reduction. His comments led defense industry leaders to pin their final hopes on the chance that Congress would at least allow the Pentagon to direct the coming cuts.|$|E
2500|$|Richard N. Haass, {{president}} of the Council on Foreign Relations, argues that {{on the eve of}} U.S. intervention in 2003, Iraq represented, at best, a gathering threat and not an imminent one. In hindsight he notes that Iraq did not even represent a gathering threat. [...] "The decision to attack Iraq in March 2003 was discretionary: it was a war of choice. There was no vital American interests in imminent danger and there were alternatives <b>to</b> <b>using</b> <b>military</b> <b>force,</b> such as strengthening existing sanctions." [...] However, Haass argues that U.S. intervention in Afghanistan in 2001 began as a war of necessity—vital interests were at stake—but morphed [...] "into something else and it crossed a line in March 2009, when President Barack Obama` decided to sharply increase American troop levels and declared that it was U.S. policy to 'take the fight to the Taliban in the south and east' of the country."

500|$|Gibraltar's post-war {{relationship}} with Spain {{was marred by}} an intensification of the long-running dispute over the territory's sovereignty. Although Spain had not attempted <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> to regain Gibraltar since 1783, the question of sovereignty was still present. Disputes over smuggling and the sea frontier between Gibraltar and Spain had repeatedly caused diplomatic tensions during the 19th century. The neutral zone between Spain and Gibraltar had also been a cause of disputes during the 19th and 20th centuries. This originally had been an undemarcated strip of sand on the isthmus between the British and Spanish lines of fortifications, about [...] wide– the distance of a cannon shot in 1704. Over the years, however, Britain took control {{of most of the}} neutral zone, much of which is now occupied by Gibraltar's airport. This expansion provoked repeated protests from Spain.|$|E
500|$|After the November 4, 1872 election, Louisiana was a split state. In a {{controversial}} election, two candidates were claiming victory as governor. [...] Violence {{was used to}} intimidate black Republicans. The fusionist party of Liberal Republicans and Democrats claimed John McEnery as the victor, while the Republicans claimed U.S. Senator William P. Kellogg. Two months later each candidate {{was sworn in as}} governor on January 13, 1873. A federal judge ruled that Kellogg was the rightful winner of the election and ordered him and the Republican-based majority to be seated. The White League supported McEnry and prepared <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> to remove Kellogg from office. Grant ordered troops to enforce the court order and protect Kellogg. On March 4, Federal troops under a flag of truce and Kellogg's state militia defeated McEnry's fusionist party's insurrection.|$|E
500|$|Prior {{to taking}} power in 1917, he was {{concerned}} that ethnic and national minorities would make the Soviet state ungovernable with their calls for independence; according to the historian Simon Sebag Montefiore, Lenin thus encouraged Stalin to develop [...] "a theory that offered the ideal of autonomy {{and the right of}} secession without necessarily having to grant either". On taking power, Lenin called for the dismantling of the bonds that had forced minority ethnic groups to remain in the Russian Empire and espoused their right to secede; however, he also expected them to reunite immediately in the spirit of proletariat internationalism. He was willing <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>military</b> <b>force</b> to ensure this unity, resulting in armed incursions into the independent states that formed in Ukraine, Georgia, Poland, Finland, and the Baltic states.
