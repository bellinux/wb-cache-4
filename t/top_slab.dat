30|$|In {{the present}} work, {{adsorption}} and dif fusion of oxygen (O) atom on uranium dinitride (UN 2) is studied {{to map out}} the preferential UN 2 (100) surface site. The first principle method based on density functional theory (DFT) within the generalized gradient approximation PBE and the covariant version energy functional PBE + U correction were used. The supercell approach and a coverage dependence of the adsorption structures and energetic were studied in detail for several monolayers’ (ML) range. Potential energy surfaces (PES) corresponding to the interaction between O atom and UN 2 (100) on surface and subsurface for several sites and layers (Top U and <b>Top</b> N <b>slabs)</b> were calculated and favorable sites were identified with their maxima energy stable positions, which were then analyzed. For all positions, the PES show the same system behavior, when the O atom is sufficiently far from the UN 2 surface, and {{the energy of the}} system tends to the sum of free UN 2 slab and free oxygen atom energies. In return, when the distances decrease, strong interactions appear with presence of important potential wells. Calculation results showed that favored on-surface site for O atom adsorption were found to be near the bridge one for the UN (<b>Top</b> U <b>slab)</b> corresponding to five layers, uranium terminated and top one for (<b>Top</b> N <b>slab)</b> corresponding to six layers nitrogen terminated, the maximum system energy is situated at a position of about 1.2 and 1.5  Å from the surface for the two layers types calculations respectively. For subsurface results, only Top N presents a favorable incorporation site at the hollow position and the penetration of O atom is about − 0.5  Å from the surface. DFT + U study confirms all the results obtained by DFT calculations; that is, the maxima site positions for oxygen atom and the adhesion energy values per atom are of the same order of magnitudes. The adsorption energy per oxygen atom and the mean distance from the top surface gradually decrease with the coverage of O atoms for both on-surface cases, Top U and <b>Top</b> N <b>slabs,</b> with oxygen occupying the favorable site. For the <b>Top</b> N <b>slab</b> hollow site, the incorporation of oxygen through the surface becomes effective from a coverage of 3 / 8 ML with an encrustation of about − 0.3  Å.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{simplified}} analysis method {{to compute the}} bearing capacity of structured cell foundations subjected to vertical loading and supported in soft cohesive soil is proposed. A structured cell is comprised by a <b>top</b> concrete <b>slab</b> structurally connected to concrete external walls that enclose the natural soil. Contrary to a box foundation {{it does not include}} a bottom slab and hence, the soil within the walls becomes {{an important component of the}} structured cell. This simplified method considers the three-dimensional geometry of the cell, the undrained shear strength of cohesive soils and the existence of structural continuity between the <b>top</b> concrete <b>slab</b> and the surrounding walls, along the walls themselves and the walls structural joints. The method was developed from results of numerical-parametric analyses, from which it was found that structured cells fail according to a punching-type mechanism...|$|R
30|$|Several {{sites were}} chosen by {{considering}} the symmetry of the UN 2 (100) surface system, and two types of slabs were selected considering surface and work function calculus variation.

[5] to confirm these maxima positions, since uranium belongs to the strongly correlated materials family, which is characterized by strong Coulomb correlation among the partially filled 5 f electrons that cause unreasonable ground state properties [6].|$|R

40|$|Conventionally, the {{thickness}} of concrete structures with one accessible surface was measured by coring that might cause damage to the structures. For some concrete structures those {{are not allowed to}} take cores, {{the thickness}} of such structures cannot be efficiently measured. The purpose of the project is to introduce the newly developed nondestructive technique (ASTM C 1383) for measuring {{the thickness of}} concrete structures into water resource engineering such as slope pavement, channel walls, <b>top</b> <b>slabs,</b> bottom slabs, and flood resistant walls. In addition, the project will establish the nondestructive methods for evaluation of concrete strength. Three techniques including pull-out test (ASTM C 900), break-off test (ASTM C 1150) and pulse velocity measurement (ASTM C 597) will be performed. The established techniques can be used to estimate the strengh of concrete at early age for prestressing and demolding purpose and to monitor the variation in concrete quality in a long term. 有關混凝土厚度與強度之工程品質檢測，目前大都採鑽心試體檢測，易造成混凝土構造物局部破壞，且對於不適合進行鑽心試體檢測之構造物，則無法有效進行品管，本研究發展計畫旨在建立寶山第二水庫水利工程混凝土構造物厚度、強度、裂縫之非破壞檢測技術，以提昇水庫相關工程之工程品質評估能力。新建完工之水利工程混凝土構造物皆須進行尺寸上之驗收，由於大部份構造物僅有一面可接觸，因此有關其厚度之量測，傳統上僅能採用鑽心取樣方式，量取鑽心試體長度之方法，作為驗收依據，此種方法費時昂貴且須在鑽心位置實施修補，因此有必要引進新技術，以非破壞方式來測量混凝土構造物之厚度，本計畫所要建立之鋼筋混凝土構造物之厚度非破壞檢測技術為 1998 年公佈之ASTM C 1383 標準試驗法。另外，有關混凝土強度非破壞檢測技術之建立，將引進ASTM C 900 之拉拔試驗法、ASTM C 1150 之彎裂試驗法與ASTM C 597 之波速量測法等三種強度檢測評估法，使現場混凝土強度可實施較普遍之檢測，且可針對部分需趕工而縮短脫模時間混凝土構造物強度判斷之依據，並用來有效長期監控混凝土強度之變化...|$|R
