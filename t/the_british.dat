5|$|In {{response}} to the treaty, the Bhonsle and Shinde attacked <b>the</b> <b>British,</b> refusing to accept the betrayal of their sovereignty to <b>the</b> <b>British</b> by the Peshwa. This {{was the start of}} the Second Anglo-Maratha War in 1803. Both were defeated by <b>the</b> <b>British,</b> and all Maratha leaders lost large parts of their territory to <b>the</b> <b>British.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>British</b> waited half an {{hour before}} attacking again. This time when they {{attacked}}, they attacked with all 4,000 men and seven cannon. <b>The</b> <b>British</b> bombarded the American position behind the stone wall as their infantry advanced. The cannon fire was ineffective, and when <b>the</b> <b>British</b> were 50 yards away the Americans fired a volley which stopped <b>the</b> <b>British</b> infantry. <b>The</b> <b>British</b> returned fire, and musket and rifle fire ensued for 20 minutes, <b>the</b> <b>British</b> supported by cannon, at which point the lead American regiment fell back under cover of the next reserve regiment. The 3rd Continental Regiment was stationed behind the stone wall {{on the opposite side of}} the road.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} {{negotiations}} between Sultan Ali and the Temenggong ensued with <b>the</b> <b>British</b> colonial government {{acting as the}} intermediary, after Sultan Ali had questioned the Temenggong's rights of keeping the state revenue to himself. Initially, the Temenggong proposed to split the trade revenue of Johor on condition that Sultan Ali surrendered his claims of sovereignty over Johor. The term was declined by Sultan Ali. Both parties agreed to seek the direct intervention of <b>the</b> <b>British</b> government, among which, <b>the</b> <b>British</b> Governor of the Straits Settlement, Colonel William Butterworth, and his successor, Edmund Blundell were roped in to act as meditators.|$|E
5|$|A two-day long {{bombardment}} of Flushing forced its capitulation on 15 August. Ratified the following day, it left <b>the</b> <b>British</b> {{in control of}} Walcheren which they garrisoned with 10,000 troops. Schouwen and Duiveland on the Eastern branch of the Scheldt, were occupied peacefully on 17 August. The French fleet had already withdrawn to Antwerp however, having been informed on 29 July when <b>the</b> <b>British</b> were still at sea. Between <b>the</b> <b>British</b> and their objective were now more than 35,000 French soldiers, garrisoned in heavily armed forts at Lillo, Liefkenshoech, and Antwerp. The deliberate destruction of dykes by the French had led to widespread flooding, and with disease spreading through <b>the</b> <b>British</b> army, {{it was decided to}} abandon the expedition in early September.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} <b>the</b> <b>British</b> in the Siege of Boston on March 17, 1776, commander-in-chief General George Washington {{brought the}} Continental Army {{to defend the}} port city of New York, then limited to the southern end of Manhattan Island. Washington understood that the city's harbor would provide an excellent base for <b>the</b> <b>British</b> Navy during the campaign, so he established defenses there and waited for <b>the</b> <b>British</b> to attack. In July, <b>the</b> <b>British</b> under the command of General William Howe landed a few miles across the harbor from Manhattan on the sparsely-populated Staten Island, where they were slowly reinforced by ships in Lower New York Bay during the next month and a half, bringing their total force to 32,000 troops. Washington knew the difficulty in holding the city with <b>the</b> <b>British</b> fleet in control of the entrance to the harbor at the Narrows, and he moved the bulk of his forces to Manhattan, believing that {{it would be the first}} target.|$|E

5|$|After {{reaching}} a virtual stalemate {{with these two}} wars against the Afghans, <b>the</b> <b>British</b> imposed the Durand Line in 1893, which divided Afghanistan and British India (now the North-West Frontier Province, Federally Administered Tribal Areas (F.A.T.A.) and Balochistan provinces of Pakistan). Named after Sir Mortimer Durand, the foreign secretary of <b>the</b> <b>British</b> Indian government, it was agreed upon by the Emir of Afghanistan (Abdur Rahman Khan) and the representatives of <b>the</b> <b>British</b> Empire but deeply resented by the Afghans. Its intended purpose was {{to serve as a}} buffer zone to inhibit the spread of Russian influence down into British India.|$|E

5|$|As <b>the</b> <b>British</b> {{came within}} range, the American riflemen opened fire. The American riflemen took {{cover in the}} woods, ravines and even in bends in the road, and each time <b>the</b> <b>British</b> would line up in a battle line, the riflemen would fall back and fire from cover. After Hand was forced to abandon the American {{position}} along Five Mile Run, he took up a new position, a heavily wooded area on the south bank of Shabakunk Creek. Hand deployed his men in the trees where they were so well protected from view that <b>the</b> <b>British</b> could not see them as they crossed the bridge over the stream. The riflemen fired at them from point-blank range. The intense fire confused <b>the</b> <b>British</b> into thinking that the entire American army was up against them and they formed into battle lines, bringing up their cannon. <b>The</b> <b>British</b> searched the woods for {{a half an hour}} looking for the Americans, but Hand had already withdrawn to a new position.|$|E
5|$|As the Seven Years' War entered its {{later stages}} through 1758 and 1759, French forces and colonies in northeastern North America came under renewed attacks from British armies. In 1758 after defeat in July at the Battle of Carillon, <b>the</b> <b>British</b> took Louisbourg in August, causing Atlantic Canada {{to fall into}} British hands, and opening the sea route to attack Quebec. Fort Frontenac fell to <b>the</b> <b>British</b> in the same month, costing the French {{supplies}} for the Ohio Valley campaign. When some of the Indian supporters of the French made peace with <b>the</b> <b>British,</b> France was forced to draw its troops back. French leadership, specifically Governor de Vaudreuil and General Montcalm, were unsettled by <b>the</b> <b>British</b> successes. However, Quebec {{was still able to}} protect itself as <b>the</b> <b>British</b> prepared a three-pronged attack for 1759.|$|E
5|$|As {{the allies}} began {{to put their}} {{artillery}} into place, <b>the</b> <b>British</b> kept up a steady fire to disrupt them. British fire increased on the 2nd and the allies suffered moderate casualties. General Washington continued to make visits to the front, despite concern shown by several of his officers over the increasing enemy fire. On the night of October 2, <b>the</b> <b>British</b> opened a storm of fire {{to cover up the}} movement of <b>the</b> <b>British</b> cavalry to Gloucester where they were to escort infantrymen on a foraging party. On the 3rd, the foraging party, led by Banastre Tarleton, went out but collided with Lauzun's Legion, and John Mercer's Virginia militia, led by the Marquis de Choisy. <b>The</b> <b>British</b> cavalry quickly retreated back behind their defensive lines, losing 50 men.|$|E

5|$|As {{the results}} of the binding {{referendum}} were to join Canada, Newfoundland began to negotiate with Canada to enter into Confederation. After negotiations were completed, <b>the</b> <b>British</b> Government received the terms and <b>the</b> <b>British</b> North America Act 1949 was subsequently passed by <b>the</b> <b>British</b> Parliament and given Royal Assent.

Reactions to Confederation were mixed.|$|E
5|$|At 05:00 {{the leading}} British ship, HMS Monarch, was within range {{and opened fire}} on the French squadron, which divided. One frigate went north and was intercepted by HMS Mars, while another, {{accompanied}} by the two corvettes, turned south and managed to outrun HMS Windsor Castle. The {{main body of the}} French force remained together and met the attack of Monarch and <b>the</b> <b>British</b> flagship HMS Centaur with their broadsides. Although outnumbered and outclassed by <b>the</b> <b>British</b> squadron the French ships fought hard, inflicting damage on the leading British ships and severely wounding Commodore Hood. Eventually the strength of <b>the</b> <b>British</b> squadron told, and despite a fierce resistance the French ships surrendered one by one, <b>the</b> <b>British</b> capturing four of the seven vessels in the squadron.|$|E
