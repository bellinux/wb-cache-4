5|$|Goss darted inside, but Hays {{slipped and}} fell {{before he could}} enter the blockhouse. As he fell, three musket balls lodged {{themselves}} into the wall {{where he had been}} standing moments before. While <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> reloaded, Hays slipped inside and for about an hour an exchange of heavy gunfire erupted between the parties before <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> withdrew. A fourth man, Upton, was out hunting nearby; when he was discovered by <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> he was chased throughout the afternoon. Upton escaped <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> injury-free. In fact, no person was killed or injured during the Plum River raid. The small raiding party escaped with three horses, but two horses were badly wounded by gunfire, and the other shot dead by the settlement's defenders.|$|E
5|$|There {{were also}} {{indications}} that <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> {{had been taking}} steroids. The gunman who survived said that <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> had used Google Earth to familiarise themselves with the locations of buildings used in the attacks.|$|E
5|$|According to investigations, <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> {{travelled}} by sea from Karachi, Pakistan, {{across the}} Arabian Sea, hijacked the Indian fishing trawler 'Kuber', killed {{the crew of}} four, then forced the captain to sail to Mumbai. After murdering the captain, <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> entered Mumbai on a rubber dinghy. The captain of 'Kuber', Amar Singh Solanki, had earlier been imprisoned for six months in a Pakistani jail for illegally fishing in Pakistani waters. <b>The</b> <b>attackers</b> stayed and were trained by the Lashkar-e-Taiba in a safehouse at Azizabad near Karachi before boarding a small boat for Mumbai.|$|E

30|$|An {{attacker}} {{intends to}} login to a user/victim’s account after <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> obtains <b>the</b> victim’s username and password/PIN. <b>The</b> <b>attacker</b> may observe or record the victim’s entry of passwords or PINs. However, {{it is assumed}} that <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> cannot obtain any sensor data about the victim’s typing of passwords/PINs from the victim’s smartwatch; instead, <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> has <b>the</b> following capabilities. First, <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> may obtain <b>the</b> victim’s username and password (e.g., by shoulder-surfing attack or key logger). Second, <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> may obtain <b>the</b> victim’s keystroke timing data and imitate the victim’s keystroke as shown in (Meng et al. 2013). In such imitation attacks, <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> may wear <b>the</b> same kind of smartwatch and access the same kind of keyboard as the victim’s.|$|R
50|$|A {{guillotine}} is initiated {{when both}} wrestlers are {{face down on}} <b>the</b> mat, <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> on top of <b>the</b> opponent. <b>The</b> <b>attacker</b> hooks one leg around the opponent's same-side leg, also hooking the ankle with <b>the</b> foot. <b>The</b> <b>attacker</b> reaches across to grab the arm opposite to the side that the leg ride is on. This arm is pulled back and up to allow <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> to slip his head under it, at or just above the elbow. (The guillotine is most easily applied if the opponent is reaching back during the leg ride.) <b>The</b> <b>attacker</b> uses his head to lift and turn the arm and opponent. <b>The</b> <b>attacker's</b> leg-hook-side arm is applied under the opponent's arm and behind {{his head in a}} similar fashion to a half nelson. <b>The</b> <b>attacker</b> rolls backward to roll the opponent is onto his back, and <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> locks his hands around the opponent's neck.|$|R
5|$|Bomb: a {{competitive}} multiplayer mode, in which <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> are tasked with locating and defusing {{one of two}} bombs. The defenders must stop <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> by killing all of them or destroying the defuser. If all attackers are killed after the defuser is planted, the defuser must still be destroyed for a defending victory.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1959 Dominique Mbonyumutwa, {{one of the}} few Hutu sub-chiefs and a PARMEHUTU activist, was {{attacked}} after attending mass with his wife at a church close to his home in Byimana, Gitarama Province. <b>The</b> <b>attackers</b> were nine members of UNAR's youth wing, exacting retribution for Mbonyumutwa's refusal to sign a UNAR protest letter, condemning the Belgian removal of the three Tutsi chiefs. <b>The</b> <b>attackers</b> initially engaged Mbonyumutwa in conversation regarding his increasing influence as a sub-chief, before punching him. Mbonyumutwa fought off <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> and both {{he and his wife were}} able to return safely home, but rumours began to spread that he had been killed; according to American theology professor James Jay Carney, Mbonyumutwa may have started the rumours himself.|$|E
5|$|Secure Area: a {{competitive}} multiplayer mode, {{in which the}} defenders must protect a room with biohazard containers, while <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> must fight their way in. The match ends when all players from one team are killed or the biohazard container is secured by <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> {{when there are no}} defenders in the room.|$|E
50|$|The eclipse attack (also {{known as}} routing-table {{poisoning}}), instead of poisoning the network, targets requesting peers directly. In this attack, <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> takes over <b>the</b> peer’s routing table {{so that they}} are unable to communicate with any other peer except <b>the</b> <b>attacker.</b> As <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> replicates <b>the</b> whole network for the targeted peer, they can manipulate them in a number of ways. For example, <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> can specify which search results are returned. <b>The</b> <b>attacker</b> can also modify file comments. The peer’s requests can also be directed back into the network by <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> and can also be modified. It also checks data randomly for any errors found in that.|$|R
50|$|This {{field is}} {{slightly}} different from <b>the</b> <b>Attacker</b> Intent field {{in that it}} describes why <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> may want to achieve the Intent listed in <b>the</b> <b>Attacker</b> Intent field, rather than the physical result of the attack.|$|R

5|$|At 20:45 on 25 April, the Lehi {{carried out}} {{an attack on}} a divisional car park in Tel Aviv. On that night, the car park was guarded by ten men from the 5th Parachute Battalion. <b>The</b> <b>attackers,</b> around thirty men, {{established}} a fire base in a house overlooking the car park. The attack began with a bomb thrown into a guard tent. Gunfire was directed at all of the soldiers in the area, then twenty of <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> stormed the car park. Once inside the compound, they entered the guard tents, killing four unarmed soldiers and looting the rifle racks of weapons. Another two off-duty soldiers, responding to the attack, were killed approaching the car park. In total, seven men from the division were killed.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{believed}} that her daughter's mere presence would help calm the opposition. Accompanied by Garai and a modest following, she and Mary {{set out for}} Đakovo. However, Elizabeth had seriously misjudged the situation. On 25 July 1386, they were ambushed en route and attacked by John Horvat in Gorjani. Their small entourage failed to fight off <b>the</b> <b>attackers.</b> Garai was killed by the rebels and his head was sent to Charles's widow Margaret, while the queens were imprisoned in the bishop of Zagreb's castle of Gomnec. Elizabeth took all blame for the rebellion and begged <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> to spare her daughter's life.|$|E
30|$|Sharif et al. {{proposed}} {{a scheme to}} attack face classification system Sharif et al. (2016) in 2016 for both targeted and untargeted, white box and black box. They have two goals: dodging and impersonation. For the dodging, the classification model fails to class <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> as <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> while for <b>the</b> impersonation, the model classes <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> as another someone who is specified by <b>the</b> <b>attacker.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{barrel roll}} attack is a {{military}} maneuver that improves <b>the</b> <b>attacker's</b> offensive position and prevents <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> from overshooting. In this maneuver the defender breaks one direction and so <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> performs a barrel roll in the opposite direction. <b>The</b> <b>attacker</b> pulls back on the stick more than a normal barrel roll, performing a tighter loop than the roll. It is the three-dimensional equivalent of a 90 degree turn, and <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> finishes <b>the</b> loop, having completed {{three quarters of a}} roll, with the nose pointed along the defender's flightpath.|$|R
50|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>attacker's</b> head is {{situated}} under the opponent's arm, {{the head is}} used to lift and turn the arm and opponent. <b>The</b> <b>attacker's</b> other arm is applied under the opponent's arm and behind {{his head in a}} similar fashion to a half nelson. As <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> rolls backward and the opponent is on his back, one of <b>the</b> <b>attacker's</b> arms will be under his body. This arm then releases the wrist of the trapped arm. Next <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> must reach across his opponent and lock his arms, straightening them as much as possible.|$|R
5|$|It was {{initially}} reported {{that some of}} <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> were British citizens, but the Indian government later stated {{that there was no}} evidence to confirm this. Similarly, early reports of 12 gunmen were also later shown to be incorrect.|$|E
5|$|Nariman House, a Chabad Lubavitch Jewish centre in Colaba {{known as}} the Mumbai Chabad House, {{was taken over by}} two attackers and several {{residents}} were held hostage. Police evacuated adjacent buildings and exchanged fire with <b>the</b> <b>attackers,</b> wounding one. Local residents were told to stay inside. <b>The</b> <b>attackers</b> threw a grenade into a nearby lane, causing no casualties. NSG commandos arrived from Delhi, and a naval helicopter took an aerial survey. During the first day, 9 hostages were rescued from the first floor. The following day, the house was stormed by NSG commandos fast-roping from helicopters onto the roof, covered by snipers positioned in nearby buildings. After a long battle, one NSG commando Havaldar Gajender Singh Bisht and both perpetrators were killed. Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg and his wife Rivka Holtzberg, who was six months pregnant, were murdered with four other hostages inside the house by <b>the</b> <b>attackers.</b>|$|E
5|$|On its Twitter account, the Ministry of Interior {{said that}} six masked {{individuals}} {{participating in a}} march in Jidhafs attacked security forces. They wrote that police responded, injuring the legs and back of one of <b>the</b> <b>attackers.</b>|$|E
50|$|Players {{use their}} armies to attack each other's castles. The player has six minutes {{to break down}} the {{defenses}} and destroy as many buildings as they can. Resources can be looted by attacking storage buildings or production buildings while pennants can be looted by attacking research buildings. A victory is achieved if <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> is able to get at least one star. One star will be given to <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> if <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> destroy either <b>the</b> keep or {{at least half of the}} buildings. Another one will be given if <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> destroys both <b>the</b> keep and at least half of <b>the</b> buildings. <b>The</b> <b>attacker</b> can get three stars if <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> destroys everything. <b>The</b> <b>attacker</b> takes away some of the defender's crowns from a successful attack and gives some crowns to the defender if the attack is unsuccessful.|$|R

5|$|To recover lost ground, the PVA 45th Division {{commander}} Cui Jiangong {{attempted a}} sneak attack with three infantry companies by 7 pm. When flares broke the night cover, <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> launched bayonet charges and hand-to-hand fighting ensued. The UN forces responded with heavy artillery fire, but the determined Chinese assault troops marched through both Chinese and UN artillery screens {{to reach the}} UN positions – a strange sight that made some American observers believe that <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> were {{under the influence of}} drugs. The intense fighting prevented UN forces from receiving any resupply, and the UN defenders were forced to give up all captured ground after running out of ammunition.|$|E
5|$|After {{the beatings}} and rape ended, <b>the</b> <b>attackers</b> threw both victims from the moving bus. Then {{the bus driver}} {{allegedly}} tried to drive the bus over Jyoti, but she was pulled aside by her male friend. One of the perpetrators later cleaned the vehicle to remove evidence.

50|$|In the half-nelson, the attacking wrestler {{is on top}} of the {{opponent}} on the ground with both wrestlers face down; a half nelson can be used to turn {{the opponent}} over. <b>The</b> <b>attacker's</b> arm is pushed below the opponent's shoulder from the outside, and across and behind the opponent's neck. <b>The</b> <b>attacker's</b> arm lifts <b>the</b> opponent's shoulder while <b>the</b> <b>attacker's</b> hand presses his neck down; simultaneously <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> drives forward perpendicularly to the opponent's body to roll him over onto his back. With the opponent on his back and <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> perpendicular to him chest-on-chest, <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> tightens his arm around the opponent's neck, often also controlling the opponent's lower body by hooking the free arm in the opponent's crotch or around the near or far thigh.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>attackers</b> {{had planned}} the attack several months {{ahead of time}} and knew some areas well enough to vanish and {{reappear}} after security forces had left. Several sources have quoted Kasab telling the police that the group received help from Mumbai residents. <b>The</b> <b>attackers</b> used at least three SIM cards purchased on the Indian side of the border with Bangladesh. There were also reports of a SIM card purchased in the US state New Jersey, if this is the case, then this would go back to Iraqi Intelligence Services and Al Qaeda from 9–11 or Jemmah Ismaliyah and Egyptian Islamic Jihad through Iraqi Intelligence from Saddam Hussein's old network of militants that was never proved. Police had also mentioned that Faheem Ansari, an Indian Lashkar operative who had been arrested in February 2008, had scouted the Mumbai targets for the November attacks. Later, the police arrested two Indian suspects, Mikhtar Ahmad, who is from Srinagar in Kashmir, and Tausif Rehman, a resident of Kolkata. They supplied the SIM cards, one in Calcutta, and the other in New Delhi.|$|E
5|$|Wapasha and the Sioux persisted {{for several}} hours in {{attempts}} to draw the Spanish defenders out. They {{went as far as}} brutally killing some captives they had taken in the fields. Although this angered some of the townspeople, Lebya refused to grant permission to the militia to make a sortie. <b>The</b> <b>attackers</b> eventually withdrew and headed north, destroying crops, livestock, and buildings as they went.|$|E
5|$|Although most Gothic {{architecture}} in Denmark {{is to be}} found in churches and monasteries, there are examples in the secular field too. Glimmingehus (1499–1506), a rectangular castle in Scania, clearly presents Gothic features. It was commissioned by the Danish nobleman Jens Holgersen Ulfstand who called on the services of Adam van Düren, a North German master who also worked on Lund Cathedral. The building contains many defensive features of the times, including parapets, false doors, dead-end corridors, murder-holes for pouring boiling pitch over <b>the</b> <b>attackers,</b> moats, drawbridges and various other death traps to protect the nobles against peasant uprisings.|$|E
5000|$|If an {{attacker}} is able {{to cause}} a DNS server to cache a fabricated DNS entry (called DNS cache poisoning), then this could allow <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> {{to gain access to}} a user's cookies. For example, an attacker could use DNS cache poisoning to create a fabricated DNS entry of [...] that points to the IP address of <b>the</b> <b>attacker's</b> server. <b>The</b> <b>attacker</b> can then post an image URL from his own server (for example, [...] ).

5000|$|In this attack, <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> joins <b>the</b> {{targeted}} swarm and establishes {{connections with}} many peers. However, <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> never provides any chunks (authentic or otherwise) to the peers. A common {{version of this}} attack is the [...] "chatty peer" [...] attack. <b>The</b> <b>attacker</b> establishes connection with targeted peers via the required handshake message, followed by a message advertising {{that they have a}} number of available chunks. Not only does <b>the</b> <b>attacker</b> never provide any chunks, they also repeatedly resend the handshake and message. These attacks prevent downloads as, essentially, the peer wastes time dealing with <b>the</b> <b>attacker,</b> instead of downloading chunks from others.|$|R
