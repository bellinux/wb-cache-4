5|$|Hieroglyphic writing {{dates from}} c. 3000BC, and is {{composed}} of hundreds of symbols. A hieroglyph can represent a word, a sound, or a silent determinative; and the same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts. Hieroglyphs were a formal script, used on stone monuments and in tombs, that could be as detailed as individual works of art. In day-to-day writing, scribes used a cursive form of writing, called hieratic, which was quicker and easier. While formal hieroglyphs may be read in rows or columns in either direction (though typically written from right <b>to</b> <b>left),</b> hieratic was always written from right <b>to</b> <b>left,</b> usually in horizontal rows. A new form of writing, Demotic, became the prevalent writing style, {{and it is this}} form of writing—along with formal hieroglyphs—that accompany the Greek text on the Rosetta Stone.|$|E

5000|$|I {{have asked}} dozens of bicycle riders how they turn <b>to</b> the <b>left.</b> I have never found {{a single person}} who stated all the facts {{correctly}} when first asked.

5|$|Most of Leonardo's {{writings}} are in mirror-image cursive. While secrecy {{is often}} suggested {{as the reason}} for this style of writing, it may have been more of a practical expediency.

5|$|After the {{departure}} of wingers Florent Malouda and Sylvain Wiltord, new manager Alain Perrin preferred the more modern 4–3–3 formation, and moved Ben Arfa <b>to</b> <b>left</b> wing for the 2007–08 season. Ben Arfa quickly adapted to the position and scored his first goal in a 5–1 demolition of Metz on 15 September, though his performance was overshadowed by a Karim Benzema hat trick. Arguably his best performances in a Lyon shirt came {{in a period of}} 12 days, during which he played a league match on 28 October against Paris Saint-Germain and a Champions League game against German club VfB Stuttgart on 7 November. He scored two goals in each match with both results being in favor of Lyon. Following the season, he was named the National Union of Professional Footballers (UNFP) Young Player of the Year.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from these}} sculptures, entire {{sequences}} from the Hindu epics (commonly the Ramayana and the Mahabharata) have been sculpted in a clockwise direction {{starting at the}} main entrance. The right <b>to</b> <b>left</b> sequence is the same direction taken by the devotees in their ritual circumambulation as they wind inward toward the inner sanctum. Depictions from mythology such as the epic hero Arjuna shooting fish, the elephant-headed god Ganesha, the Sun god Surya, the weather and war god Indra, and Brahma with Sarasvati are common. Also frequently seen in these temples is Durga, with several arms holding weapons given to her by other gods, {{in the act of}} killing a buffalo (a demon in a buffalo's form) and Harihara (a fusion of Shiva and Vishnu) holding a conch, wheel and trident. Many of these friezes were signed by the artisans, the first known instance of signed artwork in India.|$|E

5|$|Because all {{languages}} have a {{very large}} number of words, no purely logographic scripts are known to exist. Written language represents the way spoken sounds and words follow one after another by arranging symbols according to a pattern that follows a certain direction. The direction used in a writing system is entirely arbitrary and established by convention. Some writing systems use the horizontal axis (left to right as the Latin script or right <b>to</b> <b>left</b> as the Arabic script), while others such as traditional Chinese writing use the vertical dimension (from top to bottom). A few writing systems use opposite directions for alternating lines, and others, such as the ancient Maya script, can be written in either direction and rely on graphic cues to show the reader the direction of reading.|$|E

5|$|Before Bonds {{made it to}} {{the major}} leagues in Pittsburgh, Pirate fan {{attendance}} was low, with 1984 and 1985 attendance below 10,000 per game for the 81-game home schedule. Bonds made his major league debut on May 30, 1986. In 1986, Bonds led National League (NL) rookies with 16home runs, 48RBI, 36stolen bases and 65walks, but he finished 6th in Rookie of the Year voting. He played center field in 1986, but switched <b>to</b> <b>left</b> field with the arrival of centerfielder Andy Van Slyke in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Bonds {{resumed his}} {{march to the}} all-time record early in the 2007 season. After an opening game in which all he had was a first-inning single past third base against a right-shifted infield (immediately {{followed}} by a stolen base and then a base-running misjudgment that got him thrown out at home) and a deep out <b>to</b> <b>left</b> field late in the game, Bonds returned the next day, April 4, with another mission. In his first at-bat of the season's second game at the Giants' AT Park, Bonds hit a Chris Young (of the San Diego Padres) pitch just over the wall {{to the left of}} straightaway center field for career home run 735. This home run put Bonds past the midway point between Ruth and Aaron.|$|E

In the second inning, Branca retired all three hitters; when the Dodgers came up to bat, Jackie Robinson flied out and Roy Campanella grounded out. Andy Pafko scored the game's first run with a home run <b>to</b> <b>left</b> field to make the score 1–0. After the third out, Willie Mays walked to start the third inning, and after the first out Stanky got the Giants' first hit, a single. After a fly out by Dark, the Giants remained without a run; Hearn retired all three batters {{in the bottom of the}} third to end the inning.|$|E
