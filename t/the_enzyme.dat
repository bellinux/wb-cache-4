5|$|Allosteric {{sites are}} pockets on <b>the</b> <b>enzyme,</b> {{distinct}} from the active site, that bind to molecules in the cellular environment. These molecules then cause {{a change in the}} conformation or dynamics of <b>the</b> <b>enzyme</b> that is transduced to the active site and thus affects the reaction rate of <b>the</b> <b>enzyme.</b> In this way, allosteric interactions can either inhibit or activate enzymes. Allosteric interactions with metabolites upstream or downstream in an enzyme's metabolic pathway cause feedback regulation, altering the activity of <b>the</b> <b>enzyme</b> according to the flux {{through the rest of the}} pathway.|$|E
5|$|A {{competitive}} inhibitor and substrate cannot bind to <b>the</b> <b>enzyme</b> at {{the same}} time. Often competitive inhibitors strongly resemble the real substrate of <b>the</b> <b>enzyme.</b> For example, the drug methotrexate is a competitive inhibitor of <b>the</b> <b>enzyme</b> dihydrofolate reductase, which catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate. The similarity between the structures of dihydrofolate and this drug are shown in the accompanying figure. This type of inhibition can be overcome with high substrate concentration. In some cases, the inhibitor can bind to a site other than the binding-site of the usual substrate and exert an allosteric effect to change {{the shape of the}} usual binding-site.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} a {{medicinal}} enzyme inhibitor is sildenafil (Viagra), a common treatment for male erectile dysfunction. This compound is a potent inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5, <b>the</b> <b>enzyme</b> that degrades the signalling molecule cyclic guanosine monophosphate. This signalling molecule triggers smooth muscle relaxation and allows blood flow into the corpus cavernosum, which causes an erection. Since the drug decreases the activity of <b>the</b> <b>enzyme</b> that halts the signal, it makes this signal last {{for a longer period}} of time.|$|E

5|$|Catecholamines are {{produced}} in chromaffin {{cells in the}} medulla of the adrenal gland, from tyrosine, a non-essential amino acid derived from food or produced from phenylalanine in the liver. <b>The</b> <b>enzyme</b> tyrosine hydroxylase converts tyrosine to L-DOPA in {{the first step of}} catecholamine synthesis.

5|$|In some {{bacteria}} and archaea, ATP synthesis {{is driven by}} the movement of sodium ions through the cell membrane, rather than the movement of protons.

5|$|It is {{not clear}} how the {{described}} genetic defects increase the Na+/K+-ATPase activity, but it is suspected that <b>the</b> <b>enzyme</b> becomes more active due to increased thyroid hormone levels. Hyperthyroidism increases the levels of catecholamines (such as adrenaline) in the blood, increasing Na+/K+-ATPase activity. <b>The</b> <b>enzyme</b> activity is then increased further by the precipitating causes. For instance, increased carbohydrate intake leads to increased insulin levels; this is known to activate Na+/K+-ATPase. Once the precipitant is removed, <b>the</b> <b>enzyme</b> activity returns to normal levels. It has been postulated that male hormones increase Na+/K+-ATPase activity, and that this explains why males are at a higher risk of TPP despite thyroid disease being more common in females.|$|E
