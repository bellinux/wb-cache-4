50|$|The {{design of}} the Magister paid close {{attention}} to simplicity of operation; as such, a minimum amount of procedures were necessary prior to take-off. Accessibility to both the engines and onboard equipment for servicing was above average; {{it was possible for}} both of the type's Marbore engines could be swapped out within the space of 45 minutes. Provision was made for the installation of a pair of 7.5 mm guns upon the aircraft's nose, which included a 200-round ammunition box for each cannon and the ability to collect both links and cases. Underwing hard points could be used to hold up to four rockets or a pair of 110 lb bombs. A landing light was installed in the tip of the nose while a retractable <b>taxiing</b> <b>light</b> was installed upon the Messier-built nosewheel. The landing gear was satisfactory for operationsfrom austere grass airstrips.|$|E

50|$|All {{aircraft}} built after 11 March 1996 {{must have}} an anti-collision light system (strobe lights or rotating beacon) turned on for all flight activities in poor visibility. The anti-collision system is recommended in good visibility, where only strobes and beacon are required. For example, just before pushback, the pilot must keep the beacon lights on to notify ground crews that the engines are about to start. These beacon lights stay on {{for the duration of}} the flight. While <b>taxiing,</b> the <b>taxi</b> <b>lights</b> are on. When coming onto the runway, the <b>taxi</b> <b>lights</b> go off and the landing lights and strobes go on. When passing 10,000 feet, the landing lights are no longer required, and the pilot can elect to turn them off. The same cycle in reverse order applies when landing.|$|R

Vehicular emissions contribute largely to Hong Kong's air pollution and will become more important as the vehicle fleet expands. Hong Kong is unique in that a large fraction of its vehicles use diesel engines. The analysis here explicitly accounts for the composition of emissions and quantifies the relative magnitude of emissions by {{each of the five}} main sources: private cars, <b>taxis,</b> <b>light</b> buses, heavy buses, and lorries.

25|$|On 13 January 2007, a Boeing 737-200 {{belonging}} to the Gading Sari Aviation Services Sdn Bhd crash-landed while attempting to land at 5.52 a.m. The aircraft's fuselage was badly damaged, and the landing gears and right engine were torn off during the crash. All four crew members escaped unhurt. The airport was closed for six hours while the plane was towed away from the crash site and debris cleared from the runway. Departures and arrivals of 16 MAS and 14 AirAsia flights were delayed affecting 2,200 passengers – 1,000 passengers of MAS and 1,200 from AirAsia. An earlier flight from Kuala Lumpur had to be diverted to Miri Airport.

40|$|AbstractIn Halobacterium halobium tactic {{responses}} towards {{light and}} chemoeffectors {{are accompanied by}} changes in the methylation level of methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCP). <b>Taxis</b> towards green <b>light</b> absorbed by the bacteriorhodopsin proton pump appears to be governed by ΔμH+-sensing. The addition of CCCP, an uncoupler, prevented the increase of MCP methylation in response to green light illumination, but {{had no effect on}} CH 3 -incorporation followed by the addition of the attractants glucose, leucine and histidine. Similarly, CCCP did not change MCP demethylation in response to blue light illumination, a repelling stimuli. The sensitivity to an uncoupler of methylation linked to ΔμH+-mediated green <b>light</b> <b>taxis</b> is to be expected, while the independence of demethylation caused by the blue light of CCCP is an indication that in the latter case a specific photoreceptor governs phototaxis. Informed processing from the blue light receptor to MCP does not involve a change in the membrane potential...|$|R

2500|$|Although only {{emergency}} and utility vehicles {{are allowed to}} display flashing colored lights, this law is usually not enforced and {{it is common to}} see private vehicles customized with colored <b>lights.</b> <b>Taxis</b> commonly display flashing blue lights as decoration, although some taxi drivers install sirens onto their vehicles in order to get around traffic. Many busetas (the traditional, unregulated bus systems in many urban areas) and chivas (rural, informal, public buses) also display colorful flashing lights.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, {{airports}} with CAT III {{approaches have}} listings for CAT IIIa and IIIb or just CAT III {{on the instrument}} approach plate (U.S. Terminal Procedures). CAT IIIb RVR minimums are limited by the runway/taxiway lighting and support facilities, and {{are consistent with the}} airport Surface Movement Guidance Control System (SMGCS) plan. Operations below 600 ft RVR require taxiway centerline lights and taxiway red stop bar lights. If the CAT IIIb RVR minimums on a runway end are 600 ft, which is a common figure in the U.S., ILS approaches to that runway end with RVR below 600 ft qualify as CAT IIIc and require special <b>taxi</b> procedures, <b>lighting,</b> and approval conditions to permit the landings. FAA Order 8400.13D limits CAT III to 300 ft RVR or better. Order 8400.13D (2009) allows special authorization CAT II approaches to runways without ALSF-2 approach lights and/or touchdown zone/centerline lights, which has expanded the number of potential CAT II runways.|$|R
40|$|It {{was found}} that the RUSTRAK {{recorder}} was only slightly hampered by aircraft vibration while in level cruising flight or while <b>taxiing,</b> regardless of <b>light</b> turbulence or particular mounting configuration. No one mounting configuration was better than the other. There is some (approximately 1 / 4 inch) vibration error during climbs, descents, and touchdowns in choppy weather. However, it {{was found that}} improved performance resulted from setting the recorder on carpet rather than the metal floor plate. This suggests that padding the recorder with some cushioning, shock-damping material might reduce the engine vibration and wind chop effects...|$|R

40|$|Vehicular {{consumption}} of fossil fuel contributes over 90 % {{of air pollution}} in Hong Kong. A key strategy to improve Hong Kong's air quality is to discourage dirty fuels (e. g., leaded petrol and high-sulphur diesel) and to promote the use of clean fuels (e. g., low-sulphur diesel and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG)). This paper presents the empirical evidence {{on the effectiveness of}} the Government's clean fuel programs that offer tax subsidy to lower the consumption cost of such fuels. For the cases of unleaded petrol and ultra-low-sulphur diesel, lower fuel duties were offered so that the prices of these fuels were below those of leaded petrol and conventional diesel. Conventional petrol and diesel were phased out. In order to decide on the level of fuel duty concessions required to introduce LPG for taxis and bio-diesel for other vehicles, various Government-run trial programs were introduced to obtain cost estimates of using these alternative cleaner fuels. LPG using vehicles were subsequently exempted from the fuel duty in order to attract <b>taxi</b> and <b>light</b> bus operators to switch to LPG. It is apparent that the higher the subsidy, the faster is the rate at which switching to cleaner fuels takes place. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Vehicles are the {{important}} element in transportation system. It is being used for traveiing on road to fulfill the demand of working, business, vacation, etc. About 1. 4 % of registered vehicles getting involved in road crashes in Malaysia. There were found about 4. 9 deaths per 10, 000 from registered vehicles in year 2002. Statistical reports road accident (PDRM) shows that the road accident by type of faults about 15 % by speeding behavior. These statistic lead to the inevitable conclusion {{that the impact of}} road crashes due to speeding behaviour could be fatal and severed injuries. Therefore, a study on the effects of different posted speed limits to determine the operating speed and compliance of speed limits was carried out. The sites were identified and selected that located on PLUS expressway stretch from Kuala Lumpur to Seremban. The section of locations were in Sg. Besi area with 80 km/h posted speed limit, Serdang area 90 km/h posted speed limits and Seremban with H 0 km/h posted speed limits. There were 100 data collected in spot speed study was carried out for each vehicles classification namely motorcycle, car, <b>taxi,</b> <b>light</b> van and utility, medium lorry, heavy lorry and bus. The collection of data were taken from 10. 00 a. m to 1. 00 p. m within a month and covered for both southbound and northbound direction. The vehicles that traveling at or below posted or commercial speed limits was classified as complied with the speed limits, those who traveling above posted or commercial speed limits at all was classified as not complied with the speed limits. The data were analysed using statistical anaysis on univariate and bivariate analysis. Results from univariate analysis on descriptive frequency showed that the 85 "* percentile speed of car, taxi and bus almost over with the speed limits compared with motorcycle, light van and utility, medium and heavy lorry. Also the percentage of non-compliance with speed limits for car, taxi and bus were higher than motorcycle, light van and utility, medium and heavy lorry. While, from bivariate analysis the results shows eight variables were significantly associated with compliance of speed limits. They were vehicle classification, travel direction, different posted speed limits, 110 km/h posted speed limits, 90 km/h posted speed limits, 80 km/h posted speed limits, car versus taxi and private vehicle versus commercial vehicle. Therefore, road safety program should be focused on car at any posted speed limits, taxi at 90 km/h posted speed limits, bus at 110 km/h posted speed limits, direction of travelling toward CBD area and speed limits on 90 km/h. It is recommended that future engineering and non-engineering road safety programs in promoting the anti-speeding behavior through educating the public to travel with safe speed regarding with speed limit. Besides, there should be to carry out speed trapped and patrol operation on target group by the authority. Also, there is need some warn nf a nrwihte withdrawal the license permit upon any commercial vehicle those are frequently involved in violation of speed limit. Last but not least, by enforcing on commercial vehicles to install with special devices on speed pedal to restricted form speeding over speed limits...|$|R
50|$|The mouse, {{unbeknownst to}} the clock, has been eaten by an owl that {{falls in love}} with a <b>lighted</b> <b>taxi</b> meter and dances for rides. Where the mouse was eaten, a little pink flower grows up. A bee drinks the flower's nectar and shows its affection to a dying {{hibiscus}} flower. A rather snooty white mouse thinks she'd make a better hibiscus and uses the dead petals to make a dress. Then, trying to hang on the plant, she falls into a postman's bag and is thrown back to the owl. Back at the house, she finds a package with a new marzipan pig - one without any knowledge of love or loneliness. The mouse eats the new marzipan pig and falls asleep. The little boy who lives in the house opens the package (it is his birthday) and finds the mouse who escapes back into its hole. The boy tells his mother that he saw a mouse in a pink dress, though his mother never believes him. This time the mouse is not eaten by the owl but instead dances outside in the moonlight.|$|R

40|$|The fine {{particle}} size distribution characteristics obtained from a diesel <b>taxi,</b> a diesel <b>light</b> bus, a gasoline private car and a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) fuelled taxi were carried out on a chassis dynamometer system. The measurements were performed at different driving modes, i. e., with low and high idling and from 10 km· h - 1 to 70 km· h - 1, 4 cruise operations using the instrument SMPS for collecting particles of 0. 015 ∼ 0. 7 μm diameter in range. It was found that different fuelled vehicles and different driving modes characterize considerable differences in size number and mass concentration distributions. Diesel vehicles contribute much more nuclei and accumulation mode particles of 30 ∼ 150 nm, while LPG and gasoline fuelled vehicles exhaust much more nuclei mode particles of 15 ∼ 30 nm. Overall, diesel-fuelled vehicles exhaust much more particles number and mass than gasoline and LPG fuelled vehicles; In the present study, diesel vehicles exhaust the ranges of total SMPS particle number, mass concentration with (0. 3 ∼ 3. 6) × 10 8 number ·cm - 3, 0. 03 ∼ 0. 6 μ·cm - 3 respectively, and gasoline and LPG fuelled vehicles exhaust 2. 3 × 10 4 ∼ 1. 2 × 10 7 number·cm - 3, 8 × 10 - 5 ∼ 0. 1 μg·cm - 3; 8. 2 × 10 3 ∼ 8. 8 × 10 6 number·cm - 3, 1. 7 × 10 - 5 ∼ 0. 09 μg·cm - 3, respectively; For all types of vehicles, the particle number and mass concentrations are small at low-idle and low-speed-driving modes, and are large at high-idle and high-speed-driving modes.
