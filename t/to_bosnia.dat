5|$|Following negotiations, the JNA {{evacuated}} its Jastrebarsko barracks on 13 November. The garrison left, under ECMM escort, <b>to</b> <b>Bosnia</b> and Herzegovina.

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the 1995 Split Agreement and the {{large-scale}} deployment of the HV <b>to</b> <b>Bosnia</b> and Herzegovina, the HV General Staff planned to attack and capture a large part of eastern Herzegovina. The attackcodenamed Operation Burinwas formally ordered on 3 September 1995, and the HVO and the ARBiH were scheduled to join the attack. The operation was postponed on 17 September, but on 7 November was again ordered to be carried out should the Dayton peace talks fail. The plan was cancelled in early December 1995.|$|E
5|$|Partnership for Peace (PfP) {{membership}} {{was offered}} <b>to</b> <b>Bosnia</b> and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia.

It is expected that PfP membership is for these three countries the first step towards NATO membership. As a result, the PfP offer sparked the anger of the UN tribunal trying suspected war criminals from the Balkans.|$|E

5|$|Sultan Mehmed II {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>Bosnia</b> {{and laid}} siege to Jajce in July 1464. Matthias began assembling his troops {{along the river}} Száva, forcing the Sultan to raise the siege on 24 August. Matthias and his army crossed the river and seized Srebrnica. He also besieged Zvornik but {{the arrival of a}} large Ottoman army forced him to withdraw to Hungary. The following year, Matthias forced Stefan Vukčić, who had transferred Makarska Krajina to the Republic of Venice, to establish Hungarian garrisons in his forts along the river Neretva.|$|E
5|$|The offensives were {{accompanied}} by the displacement {{of most of the}} Croatian Serb population of the area captured by the HV. The refugees initially fled <b>to</b> <b>Bosnia</b> and Herzegovina, but the majority were soon settled in the JNA-held Baranja region of eastern Croatia. The offensive provoked accusations that Croatian troops had committed ethnic cleansing and civil-rights abuses. These accusations were contested by the European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM). A month after the operation, the retreating paramilitary unit known as the White Eagles perpetrated the Voćin massacre, and its war crimes were prosecuted at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.|$|E
5|$|After the war, five Croatian {{fighters were}} charged and convicted of eleven counts of murder, one of {{attempted}} murder, {{and one of}} torture of Serb civilians found in the JNA barracks, which surrendered on 15 September 1991. They received prison sentences of between five and eight years. Glavaš, who was tried alongside them for the same crimes, received a ten-year sentence. Before the conviction became final in 2009, and to avoid extradition, Glavaš fled <b>to</b> <b>Bosnia</b> and Herzegovina, where he had granted citizenship. His sentence was reduced to eight years and became final in 2010, {{when he was arrested}} and imprisoned in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In January 2015, the conviction was set aside by the Constitutional Court of Croatia, pending a new trial before the Supreme Court of Croatia.|$|E

He was named on standby for the 2007–09 International Challenge Trophy match against the Belgium under-21 team on 19 May 2009. He was given a second call-up for the match away to Poland under-23 team on 17 November 2009. Brodie started the match and had a goal disallowed, before being substituted on 65 minutes after picking up a foot injury. This was the final of two caps earned for England C.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for a war against the Ottomans, Matthias held a Diet at Tolna in March 1463. Although the Estates authorized him to levy a one-florin extraordinary tax, he did not intervene when Mehmed II invaded Bosnia in June. In a month, the Ottomans murdered King Stephen Tomašević and conquered the whole country. Matthias only adopted an offensive foreign policy after the terms of his peace with Emperor Frederick were ratified in Wiener Neustadt on 19 July 1463. He led his troops <b>to</b> <b>Bosnia</b> and conquered Jajce and other forts in its northern parts. The conquered regions were organized into a new defensive province, or banate. Assisted by Stefan Vukčić, Duke of Saint Sava, Matthias also conquered Bosanska Krajina and granted it to the Duke, who accepted his suzerainty.|$|E
5|$|John of Palisna, Prior of Vrana, rose up in open {{rebellion}} against the rule of Mary and her mother {{in the spring of}} 1383. The queens made Stephen Lackfi Ban of Croatia. The royal army marched to Croatia and laid siege to Vrana, forcing John of Palisna to flee <b>to</b> <b>Bosnia.</b> The defenders of Vrana surrendered to Mary, who had been present during the siege along with her mother, on 4November. To strengthen Mary's position against Charles of Naples, Queen Elizabeth sent her envoys to France and opened negotiations on the marriage of Mary to the younger brother of CharlesVI of France, Louis, who had once been engaged to Mary's sister, Catherine. Mary and the queen mother only left Croatia and Slavonia early next year. Queen Elizabeth replaced Stephen Lackfi with Thomas Szentgyörgyi, who used draconian measures {{to put an end to}} a conspiracy against the queens in Zadar in May 1384.|$|E

5|$|Many {{military}} events {{occurred during}} Clinton's presidency. The Battle of Mogadishu occurred in Somalia in 1993. During the operation, two U.S. helicopters {{were shot down}} by rocket-propelled grenade attacks to their tail rotors, trapping soldiers behind enemy lines. This resulted in an urban battle that killed 18 American soldiers, wounded 73 others, and one was taken prisoner. There were many more Somali casualties. Some of the American bodies were dragged through the streets—a spectacle broadcast on television news programs. In response, U.S. forces were withdrawn from Somalia and later conflicts were approached with fewer soldiers on the ground. In 1995, U.S. and NATO aircraft attacked Bosnian Serb targets to halt attacks on U.N. safe zones and to pressure them into a peace accord. Clinton deployed U.S. peacekeepers <b>to</b> <b>Bosnia</b> in late 1995, to uphold the subsequent Dayton Agreement.|$|E
5|$|The {{capabilities}} of the HV increased dramatically {{in the first few}} months of 1992 because it acquired large stockpiles of JNA's weapons in the Battle of the Barracks. After the JNA disengaged in Croatia, its personnel prepared to set up a new Bosnian Serb army, later renamed the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS). The move followed the Bosnian Serb declaration of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, ahead of the 29 February1 March 1992 referendum on Bosnia and Herzegovina's independence. The referendum would later be cited as a pretext for the Bosnian War, which commenced in early April 1992, when the VRS's artillery began shelling Sarajevo. The JNA and the VRS in Bosnia and Herzegovina were confronted by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), reporting to the Bosniak-dominated central government and the Bosnian Croat leadership respectively. The HV sometimes deployed <b>to</b> <b>Bosnia</b> and Herzegovina to support the HVO.|$|E

After the conflict ended, Soriano contributed to the Secretary of Defense's Gulf War Report as the chief of the army section while serving in the Office of the Chief of Staff. In 1992, Soriano received his first assignment at Fort Carson, Colorado, as the commander of the 1st Brigade, 4th Infantry Division. Following this command, Soriano returned to Germany to serve with the 3d and 1st Infantry Divisions, which included deployments <b>to</b> <b>Bosnia</b> for peacekeeping during Operation Joint Endeavor. Returning to the United States, he undertook various positions in Virginia and The Pentagon, including service as Director, Officer Personnel Management, within the Total Army Personnel Command. From 1999 to 2001, Soriano commanded the 7th Infantry Division and Fort Carson. Soriano served as Director of Homeland Security for United States Joint Forces Command from October 2001 to August 2002, which laid the foundations for what has become the Northern Command.|$|E
