The {{invention}} was so successful it led the company away from building stoves to building fasteners.Tinnerman Products evolved from the speed nut development with manufacturing plants in Cleveland, Ohio. A modern manufacturing plant was constructed on Brookpark Road in the mid-1950s. <b>Tinnerman</b> Products was later acquired by Eaton Yale & Towne (Eaton Corporation).|$|E

In 2011, citing a lack of attendance and other factors, [...] the Greater Cleveland Council permanently closed <b>Tinnerman</b> Canoe Base and put it up for sale. Distraught <b>Tinnerman</b> alumni created a detailed proposal [...] for a non-profit <b>Tinnerman</b> Foundation, to keep the camp operating as a canoe base for youthful explorers. On February 21, 2012 the Greater Cleveland Council announced that [...] "the executive board of Greater Cleveland Council, Boy Scouts of America voted to unanimously accept a cash offer of $415,000 for the 10 acre property on the French River in Ontario, Canada that was the <b>Tinnerman</b> Wilderness Canoe Base. The purchase offer has no contingencies and is expected to be completed in early May 2012." ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Tinnerman</b> Wilderness Canoe Base, more {{commonly}} known as <b>Tinnerman</b> Canoe Base, is a [...] "high-adventure base" [...] located {{on the banks of}} the French River, in Ontario. In the 18th and early 19th centuries, the French River area was a major trade route used to exchange furs trapped in the West with various goods made in the East and in Europe. <b>Tinnerman</b> is nicknamed the [...] "Land of the Joli Voyageur". The land that the <b>Tinnerman</b> base is located on was owned by Albert H. <b>Tinnerman,</b> inventor of the speed nut. After Mr. Tinnerman's passing in 1961, his grandson Bill Buttriss of Cleveland Ohio tried to obtain a commercial license for the camp. The Ontario government said that any one area would support only so many camps and they felt the lower French had enough camps at that time. Though appealed, a license was not possible for the camp. It was at this time the family decided to donate the camp to the Cleveland Area Scout Council. Two weeks after the formal donation, Mr. Buttriss received a letter from the Ontario government stating that since one of the camps in the area had closed its doors (Rainbow Lodge on Bass Creek), the license would now be available.|$|E

5000|$|After Beville and Raymond {{bought the}} {{aircraft}} on July 22, 1946, {{it was given}} the registry of NX79111 and the name The Galloping Ghost, after the nickname of football star Red Grange.

Raymond took fourth place on the closed-course track, winning $3,000. [...] The following year, Beville piloted the aircraft in the Kendall Trophy race.

He won the <b>Tinnerman</b> by less than a second, taking $3,150 and earning a total of $11,850 for all three races. In 1949, Beville raced in the Sohio and Thompson Trophies, taking fourth for both and earning a total of $3,700.|$|E

[...] It {{was the fifth}} {{production}} aircraft and was purchased by Cook Cleland, {{who went on to}} finish first in the 1947 Thompson Trophy Race and first in the 1949 <b>Tinnerman</b> Trophy Race. Over time, the aircraft, registered as NX5588N, went from owner to owner and slowly deteriorated. Finally, in 1996, NX5588N was purchased by Bob Odegaard of North Dakota, and was returned to airworthy condition in 1999. The aircraft was on loan to the Fargo Air Museum. Odegaard raced the aircraft in the Unlimited class at the Reno Air Races from 2006 to 2008 [...] and it was featured in the movie Thunder Over Reno. The aircraft was bought in February, 2017 by Steuart Walton. It is based at Louise M. Thaden Airfield in Bentonville, Arkansas.|$|E

40|$|In February 2011 the US Department of Energy {{announced}} their new Sunshot Initiative. The Sunshot {{goal is to}} reduce the total cost of solar energy systems by about 75 percent {{before the end of the}} decade. The DOE estimated that a total installed cost of $ 1 per watt for photovoltaic systems would be equivalent to 6 ÃÂÃÂ¢/kilowatt hour (kWh) for energy available from the grid. The DOE also estimated that to meet the $ 1 per watt goal, PV module costs would need to be reduced to $. 50 per watt, balance of systems costs would need to be reduced to $. 40 per watt, and power electronic costs would need to reach $. 10 per watt. To address the BOS balance of systems cost component of the $ 1 per watt goal, the DOE announced a funding opportunity called (BOS-X) Extreme Balance of System Hardware Cost Reductions. The DOE identified eight areas within the total BOS costs: 1) installation labor, 2) installation materials, 3) installation overhead and profit, 4) tracker, 5) permitting and commissioning, 6) site preparation, 7) land acquisition, 8) sales tax. The BOS-X funding announcement requested applications in four specific topics: Topic 1 : Transformational Building Integrated Photovoltaic (BIPV) Modules Topic 2 : Roof and Ground Mount Innovations Topic 3 : Transformational Photovoltaic System Designs Topic 4 : Development of New Wind Load Codes for PV Systems The application submitted by ARaymond <b>Tinnerman</b> reflected the requirements listed in Topic # 2, Roof and Ground Mount Innovations. The goal of topic # 2 was to develop technologies that would result in the extreme reduction of material and labor costs associated with applications that require physical connections and attachments to roof and ground mount structures. The topics researched in this project included component cost reduction, labor reduction, weight reduction, wiring innovations, and alternative material utilization. The project objectives included: 1) The development of an innovative quick snap bracket assembly that would be bonded to frameless PV modules for commercial rooftop installations. 2) The development of a composite pultruded rail to replace traditional racking materials. 3) In partnership with a roofing company, pilot the certification of a commercial roof to be solar panel compliant, eliminating the need for structural analysis and government oversight resulting in significantly decreased permitting costs. 4) Reduce the sum of all cost impacts in topic # 2 from a baseline total of $ 2. 05 /watt to $. 34 /watt...|$|E
