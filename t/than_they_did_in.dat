5|$|In the 2005–2014 petrodollar surge, {{financial}} decision-makers {{were able}} to benefit somewhat from the lessons and experiences of the previous cycle. Developing economies generally stayed better balanced <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> the 1970s; the world economy was less oil-intensive; and global inflation and interest rates were much better contained. Oil exporters opted to make most of their investments directly into a diverse array of global markets, and the recycling process was less dependent on intermediary channels such as international banks and the IMF.|$|E
5|$|Both coaches {{told the}} media that they {{believed}} their respective teams should play far better <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> the National semifinal games {{if they wanted to}} win the upcoming game. Coach Smith expressed concerns over Georgetown's shooting ability and feared that Floyd would come out shooting very well from the field. In addition, Smith noted that Ewing would play a large factor in the game because his defensive presence in the game limits second chance opportunities for Georgetown's opponents. Ken Rappoport of the Associated Press wrote of how North Carolina was a very disciplined team that takes only high-percentage shots.|$|E
5|$|During {{the same}} year, the State of Texas {{announced}} it would provide $500,000 worth of grant funds to Gulfton-area agencies for crime prevention programs. The state targeted Gulfton because the zip code had 419 juvenile probation referrals, the highest for any zip code in Harris County. After the grant was established, GANO, the Shenandoah Civic Association, and GARC worked together to reduce juvenile crime. In 1995, Nelson Reyes, a counselor for immigrants from Mexico and El Salvador at the Gulfton Area Neighborhood Organization, said that local parents had positive attitudes about living in Gulfton as they made more money <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> their home countries, but Gulfton-area children felt impacted by the area crime.|$|E

5|$|County went undefeated in Gannon's {{first four}} league games in charge. After three weeks, this upturn in results saw Gannon offered the job full-time, which {{allowed him to}} guide County to safety. The club won {{more than twice as}} many points in the second half of the season <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> the first. Believing that safety would be assured on the final day of the season, he was proved correct as they managed to avoid relegation with a final day draw with champions Carlisle United. Comparisons were made to Sam Allardyce. As a {{committed}} Stockport fan, and already a legend at the club for his ten years as a player, he was loved by many County supporters. After delaying talks, he accepted a one-year rolling contract in the summer.|$|E
5|$|On the ground, the Hokies {{had even}} less success <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> the air. Branden Ore, Tech's {{starting}} tailback, earned 42yards in 20shortrushes during the game. With {{a long run}} of eight yards, Ore was kept in check by Georgia's defense. The only other Hokie to achieve positive yardage on the ground was backup tailback Kenny Lewis, who only managed five yards. Glennon was sacked three times, once fumbling the ball. These sacks wiped out the 11 rushing yards he managed to gain during his scrambles for yardage. In the second quarter, Virginia Tech was aided by excellent field position, enabling them to score three offensive touchdowns. Tech's average starting field position in that quarter was the Georgia 48-yard line, allowing for easy scores even for a struggling offense.|$|E

25|$|However, it {{was viewed}} as a new {{challenge}} for Rush who would have the task of unlocking the much tighter defences in Serie A. His time at Juventus was less than successful, as he scored only eight times in 29 games; though this partly explained by the Italian tradition at this time of tighter defences meaning that strikers tended to score fewer goals in Italy <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> England.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} similar {{findings}} for India.

Workers in the textile industry, for example, earned more in Bengal and Mysore <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> Britain, while agricultural labour in Britain had to work longer hours to earn the same amount as in Mysore. In the late 18th century, Mysore's average per-capita income was five times higher than subsistence level, i.e. five times higher than $400 (1990 international dollars), or $2,000 per capita. In comparison, the highest national per-capita incomes in 1820 were $1,838 for the Netherlands and $1,706 for Britain.|$|E
25|$|The Sims 2 {{characters}} pass through seven life stages — babies, toddlers, children, teenagers, young adults (only with University), adults, and elders — with eventual death of old age, while babies in The Sims only become children before ceasing to continue aging. The aspiration system (described above) is also new to The Sims 2. Sims can become pregnant and produce babies that take on genetic characteristics of their parents, such as eye color, hair color, facial structure, and personality traits {{as opposed to}} Sims, in which the baby would take on random appearance and personality. Genetics {{play a major role}} in the game, and as such, dominant and recessive genes play a larger role <b>than</b> <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> the original game. A player can also aspire to have a Sim abducted by aliens. Males then have the chance to become impregnated and produce after three Sim days a half-alien child.|$|E
