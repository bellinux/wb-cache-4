5|$|Benfica started November by hosting Beira-Mar on the 2nd in the {{official}} opening of their new stadium. Beira-Mar won 2–1, inflicting Benfica's second league defeat, which opened an 11-point gap to Porto. Camacho blamed the defeat {{on the lack of}} goal opportunities. Four days later, Benfica received Molde for the UEFA Cup, beating them 3–1 and assuring a two-goal lead for the second leg. Camacho recognized the team was struggling to defend against corner-kicks, as both Beira-Mar and Molde had scored in corners. On 9 November, the team visited Alverca and won three-nil, with two goals from Tiago and one from Geovanni. Camacho was pleased with the performance, but said that Benfica should have scored more. On 12 November, Benfica played Marítimo, in a fixture transferred from October. Weakened by injuries in some of the regular players, Benfica could not do better than a one-all draw. Camacho attributed the result to the excessive number of games in short amount of <b>time,</b> <b>something</b> most of the players were not accustomed to. After a 10-day international break, Benfica opened the Portuguese Cup campaign against Estrela da Amadora on the 22nd. They won 3–1 with all of the goals arriving late in the game. Benfica closed the month with a 2–0 win to Molde, on the second leg of the UEFA Cup, with Tiago again scoring twice.|$|E
5|$|List {{believed}} that the degradation of modern Western society was {{as a result of}} a conspiracy orchestrated by a secret organisation known as the Great International Party, an idea influenced by anti-semitic conspiracy theories. Adopting a millenarianist perspective, he believed in the imminent defeat of this enemy and the establishment of a better future for the Ario-German race. In April 1915 he welcomed the start of World War I as a conflict that would bring about the defeat of Germany's enemies and the establishment of a golden age for the new Ario-German Empire. Toward the war's end, he {{believed that}} the German war dead would be reincarnated as a generation who would push through with a national revolution and establish this new, better society. For List, this better future would be intricately connected to the ancient past, reflecting his belief in the cyclical nature of <b>time,</b> <b>something</b> which he had adopted both from a reading of Norse mythology and from Theosophy. Reflecting his monarchist beliefs, he envisioned this future state as being governed by the House of Habsburg, with a revived feudal system of land ownership being introduced through which land would be inherited by a man's eldest son. In List's opinion, this new empire would be highly hierarchical, with non-Aryans being subjugated under the Aryan population and opportunities for education and jobs in public service being restricted to those deemed racially pure. He envisioned this Empire following the Wotanic religion which he promoted.|$|E
25|$|A {{committed}} Eurosceptic, Duncan Smith {{became a}} constant {{thorn in the}} side of Prime Minister John Major's government of 1992 to 1997, opposing Major's pro-European agenda at the <b>time</b> (<b>something</b> that would often be raised during his own subsequent leadership when he called for the party to unite behind him).|$|E

50|$|In {{turning the}} Dostoevsky story into a film, Visconti {{eliminated}} the first-person narration and made Natalia {{less of an}} innocent, and at <b>times</b> <b>something</b> of a hysteric and a tease.

25|$|In 202, {{when there}} were reports of a trans woman in Yuexi Commandery (越巂郡; around present-day Xichang, Sichuan), Zhou Qun {{interpreted}} this as a sign that the ruling dynasty would change soon, because the last <b>time</b> <b>something</b> similar happened, the Xin dynasty replaced the Western Han dynasty. In 220, Zhou Qun's prediction came true as the Cao Wei state replaced the Eastern Han dynasty.|$|E

In November 2012, he called an Indiana men's basketball game for the first <b>time,</b> <b>something</b> he had previously refused to do. Former Indiana men's basketball coach Tom Crean reached out to Knight in an attempt to get him to visit the school again. Knight has thus far rebuffed all attempts to bring him back to Indiana University.|$|E
25|$|In the 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries, French players dominated, with Legall de Kermeur (1730–55), François-André Danican Philidor (1755–95), Alexandre Deschapelles (around 1800–21) and Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais (1821–40) all widely {{regarded}} as the strongest players of their <b>time.</b> <b>Something</b> resembling a world championship match was the La Bourdonnais - McDonnell chess matches in 1834, in which La Bourdonnais played a series of six matches – and 85 games – against the Irishman Alexander McDonnell.|$|E

50|$|A {{key feature}} of such {{bullying}} {{is that it}} allows victims to be harassed at all <b>times,</b> <b>something</b> not possible typically with physical bullying.

50|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, Cyprus {{had managed}} {{to reach the top}} 10 a number of <b>times,</b> <b>something</b> which made the Contest become popular in the Cypriot public. Since the last best result of the country in 2004, Cyprus' {{performance}} has dropped notably. From 2006 to 2009 and again in 2011 & 2013, the country didn't manage to reach the final.|$|R
25|$|In his autobiographical book, Karpov on Karpov, {{published}} in 1991, Karpov credits Furman very extensively and deservedly with helping him scale {{the heights of}} grandmaster chess, culminating in his World Championship in 1975 and superb play for the next decade, as he dominated the game. This fine book {{is perhaps the most}} detailed work ever published on the relationship between a top chess player and his coach. The two also played a great deal of bridge together; this game became for a <b>time</b> <b>something</b> of an obsession with Furman.|$|E
25|$|At this point, {{the thread}} is woven. Depending on the era, one person could manage {{anywhere}} from 3 to 100 machines. In the mid nineteenth century, four was the standard number. A skilled weaver in 1925 would run 6 Lancashire Looms. As time progressed new mechanisms were added that stopped the loom any <b>time</b> <b>something</b> went wrong. The mechanisms checked {{for such things}} as a broken warp thread, broken weft thread, the shuttle going straight across, and if the shuttle was empty. Forty of these Northrop Looms or automatic looms could be operated by one skilled worker.|$|E
25|$|In early 1975 the merged group began rehearsing for In Praise of Learning in a {{freezing}} gymnasium. It was {{an arduous}} and extremely demanding <b>time,</b> <b>something</b> Slapp Happy {{were not prepared}} for, and it soon {{became apparent that the}} merger might not work. Nevertheless, they still went to The Manor and made In Praise of Learning together. But it was only after they started rehearsing with a view to performing live together that it became clear that their approaches were incompatible. The merger ended in April 1975, when Anthony Moore quit and Peter Blegvad was asked to leave. However, Dagmar Krause, whose contribution had added another dimension to Henry Cow's sound, elected to remain, which effectively spelled the end of Slapp Happy as a band.|$|E

25|$|Richards {{maintained}} cordial relations {{after breaking}} up with Italian-born actress Anita Pallenberg (d. June 13, 2017), {{the mother of his}} first three children. Richards and Pallenberg, who never married, were a couple from 1967 to 1979. Together they have a son, Marlon Leon Sundeep (named after the actor Marlon Brando), born in 1969, and a daughter, Angela (originally named Dandelion), born in 1972. Their third child, a son named Tara Jo Jo Gunne (after Richards' and Pallenberg's friend Guinness heir Tara Browne), died on 6 June 1976 at just over two months old of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Richards was away on tour at the <b>time,</b> <b>something</b> he said has haunted him since. He was criticised at the time for performing that night after learning of the death, but he later said {{it was the only way}} he could cope.|$|E
25|$|In {{internal}} politics, Magnus {{carried out}} a great effort to modernise the law-code, which gave him his epithet law-mender. These were adopted at the Things in the years 1274 (Landslov) and 1276 (Byloven). In 1274 he promulgated the new national law, a unified code of laws {{to apply for the}} whole country, including the Faroe Islands and Shetland. This replaced the different regional laws which had existed before. It was supplemented by a new municipal law (a law for the cities) in 1276, and a slightly modified version was also drawn up for Iceland. A unified code of laws for a whole country was at this <b>time</b> <b>something</b> quite new, which had until then only been introduced in Sicily and Castile. His code introduced the concept that crime is an offense against the state rather than against the individual and thus narrowed the possibilities of personal vengeance. It increased the formal power of the king, making the throne the source of justice. The municipal law gave the cities increased freedom from rural control. A specific section fixed the law of succession to the throne, in accordance with the arrangements laid down by King Håkon Håkonsson in 1260.|$|E
25|$|Himilco next {{tried to}} reduce the fortresses in which the people of Messese had taken refuge, but gave up the attempt, as this proved too time consuming, and kept him from attacking Syracuse, where Dionysius would use any extra time to {{strengthen}} himself further. The ultimate Carthaginian goal was the defeat of Syracuse, Messana was just a sideshow. Bringing reinforcements from Carthage would also be time consuming as Carthage had no standing army and would need time to raise fresh mercenaries, while dividing the field army to guard Messana would decrease his striking power against Dionysius. After sacking and destroying the city, the Carthaginian army marched south along the eastern coast of Sicily, while their fleet sailed alongside. Dionysius had destroyed the cities of Naxos and Catana while expanding his power, giving Naxos to the Sicels and Catana to Campanian mercenaries. This meant fewer obstacles for Himilco to overcome along this route than along the southern coast of Sicily. Himilco could not entirely ignore the hostile Greek fortresses in his rear, as they might cause problems once he left the site. His solution was simple and ingenious at the same <b>time,</b> <b>something</b> that is termed indirect approach.|$|E

50|$|Counting {{can also}} be {{in the form of}} tally marks, making a mark for each number and then {{counting}} all of the marks when done tallying. This is useful when counting objects over time, such as the number of <b>times</b> <b>something</b> occurs {{during the course of a}} day. Tallying is base 1 counting; normal counting is done in base 10. Computers use base 2 counting (0's and 1's).|$|R
50|$|This is {{not only}} {{injective}} in the set-theoretic sense: it is a closed immersion {{in the sense of}} algebraic geometry. That is, one can give a set of equations for the image.

[...] Returning home, the Japanese delegation was accompanied by more than 250 German technicians, engineers and instructors. Soon, Japan's Air Force {{was among the most}} powerful in the world.|$|E

The singer described the release as [...] "overwhelming" [...] and like a [...] "rebirth" [...] while adding {{that she had been}} [...] "in the studio for months and months and now it's in the world [...] It feels like the first <b>time.</b> <b>Something</b> about this song, it feels like I'm a new artist."

500|$|The Inaugural Committee {{wanted to}} adopt [...] "Bring Us Together" [...] as the inaugural theme, appalling Safire, who said, [...] "That wasn't {{the theme of}} the campaign." [...] Safire and other aides felt the {{administration}} should seek to advance its agenda, rather than seeking consensus on policy, and White House Chief of Staff-designate H. R. Haldeman was able to change the theme to [...] "Forward Together." [...] Nevertheless, the phrase [...] "Bring Us Together" [...] was thrown {{in the face of the}} Nixon administration by Democrats each <b>time</b> <b>something</b> divisive was proposed, and was used as the title of a tell-all expose by Leon Panetta after he was fired from the Nixon administration for dissenting from the White House's [...] "Southern strategy" [...] on civil rights policy.

500|$|Sarcófago (Portuguese for 'sarcophagus') {{was formed}} in 1985 in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Equally indebted to early extreme metal groups such as Bathory, Celtic Frost, Slayer, and Finnish {{hardcore}} punk, Sarcófago's goal was to create the most aggressive music ever. Wagner Lamounier, who parted acrimoniously from Sepultura in March of that same year, was {{invited to join the}} band. Although Sepultura never recorded anything with Lamounier, he contributed the lyrics to the song [...] "Antichrist" [...] on their Bestial Devastation EP. Sarcófago's vinyl debut was on the Cogumelo Produções split album Warfare Noise I, originally released in 1986. Sarcófago contributed the three tracks [...] "Recrucify", [...] "The Black Vomit" [...] and [...] "Satanas". Their music and lyrics were considered shocking at the <b>time,</b> <b>something</b> which brought them a considerable amount of attention. The band's line-up at that point consisted of [...] "Butcher" [...] (guitars), [...] "Antichrist" [...] (Lamounier; vocals), [...] "Incubus" [...] (Geraldo Minelli; bass) and [...] "Leprous" [...] (Armando Sampaio; drums).|$|E
