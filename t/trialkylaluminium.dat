5000|$|The first organoaluminium {{compound}} (C2H5)3Al2I3 {{was discovered}} in 1859. [...] Organoaluminium compounds were, however, little known until the 1950s when Karl Ziegler and colleagues discovered the direct synthesis of <b>trialkylaluminium</b> compounds and applied these compounds to catalytic olefin polymerization.

5000|$|The Ziegler alcohol {{synthesis}} involves oligomerization of ethylene using triethylaluminium {{followed by}} oxidation.1 [...] The triethylaluminium, the Ziegler catalyst, is synthesized by action of aluminum, ethylene, and hydrogen gas. In the production process, {{two-thirds of the}} triethylaluminium produced is recycled back into the reactor, and only one-third is used to produce the fatty alcohols.1 [...] The recycling step is used to produce triethylaluminium at a higher yield and with less time, making the overall process more efficient. Triethylaluminium reacts with ethylene to form higher molecular weight <b>trialkylaluminium.</b> The number of equivalents of ethylene n equals {{the total number of}} monomer units being grown on the initial ethylene chains, where (n = x + y + z), and x, y, and z are the number of ethylene units per chain. <b>Trialkylaluminium</b> is oxidized with air to form aluminum alkoxides, and finally hydrolyzed to aluminum hydroxide and the desired alcohols.|$|E
50|$|Aluminum hydroxide, the {{byproduct}} of the synthesis, can be dehydrated to give alumina, which, at high purities, has a high commercial value. One modification of the Ziegler process is called the EPAL process. In this process, chain growth is optimized to produce alcohols with narrow molecular weight distribution.

40|$|As an {{alternative}} to the standard Cossee mechanism, in which olefin insertion involves two sites at a single metal centre, we have investigated a true dinuclear alternative where the chain switches between two different metal centres at each insertion.

Surprisingly, calculations indicate that the barriers for both insertion and BHT at two different metal centres are rather similar to those for the more usual mononuclear mechanisms. Dinuclear BHE is more competitive as a chain transfer mechanism, although it always has a higher barrier than BHT. In any system where polymerization at an unknown aluminium active species is believed to occur, dinuclear insertion should be considered as a real alternative to the "standard" mononuclear mechanism.

Ziegler and Natta [1, 2, 3] discovered that heterogeneous polymerisation of ethylene and propylene could be achieved by mixtures of transition metal and <b>trialkylaluminium</b> compounds; such systems included TiCl 4 /AlEt 3. To this day, the majority of industrially produced polyolefins are produced in this way. These systems have been widely developed over the last 50  years and act as efficient and selective catalysts for many types of olefin polymerisation. The main problem with these catalysts is the lack of definition in the active site. Without a well-defined active site, rational catalyst design and characterisation is difficult, and the polymer produced by such a system has a broad molecular weight distribution. This is where the study of homogenous catalysis finds its benefits. The molecules which now act as the active sites for catalysis can be completely defined and characterised by methods such as NMR spectroscopy or X-ray crystallography with relative ease leading to logical catalyst design. This short tutorial review, focussing on Group 4 metals and metallocene and half-sandwich types of compounds in particular, is not intended by any means to provide an exhaustive account of the literature.
