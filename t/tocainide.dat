40|$|Introduction: There is {{a variety}} of medical and non-medical therapies in practice, which were not {{evaluated}} regarding its effectiveness by any systematic evidence oriented investigation. A number of therapies of medical and non-medical type try to treat {{the different types of}} tinnitus. The evidence in the scientific literature also had to be cleared in the field of diagnosis and classification as well as medical/psychiatric/psychological procedures of existing medical therapy. Question: The HTA report had to investigate the following questions: * Which evidence do diagnostic methods in recognition of tinnitus have? * Which types of therapy show medical effectiveness at the acute or chronic tinnitus without an organic cause? * Which consequences (need for further research, future procedures) can be drawn? Methodology: In the following databases "tinnitus" was searched according to the search string:HTA 97; INAHTA; CDAR 94; CDSR 93; CCTR 93; ME 66; ME 0 A; HT 83; SM 78; CA 66; CB 85; BA 70; BA 93; EM 74; IS 74; ET 80; EB 94; IA 70; AZ 72; CV 72; GE 79; EU 93; HN 69; ED 93; EA 08 Result: 1932 studies, unsorted after assessment in accordance with EBM criterions, selection: 409 studies. Due to the completely heterogeneous representation modes of the therapeutic approaches at the treatment of the chronic tinnitus no quantitative synthesis method could be performed. Therefore the methodology of a qualitative overview has been carried out. Results: The diagnostic confirmation of the non-specific tinnitus without organic cause meets with the problem of the assurance of the diagnosis tinnitus. According to the current opinion the stepwise diagnostics is carried out also {{in the case of the}} so called subjective tinnitus. Nothing can be said about the evidence of these procedures since no publication was found about that. A study concerning the evidence of the diagnostic questionnaires from Goebel and Hiller [1] comes to the end that the tinnitus questionnaire frequently used (TF) [2] is the best evaluated procedure. The number of therapies which treat tinnitus is exceptionally high and makes clear, that the search for "the" tinnitus therapy is still going on. According to the current knowledge tinnitus genesis is multifactorial and therefore there can’t be any standard therapy for tinnitus. The following seven categories can be distinguished: Ad 1 : Machine-aided acoustic therapies: From many studies regarding machine-aided acoustic therapy of tinnitus only two showed an evidence degree that allows scientifically correct statements about the effectiveness of these procedures. Selectively significant improvements could be shown in the comparison with a placebo (apparatus switched off) a superiority of tinnitus-maskers. Ad 2 : Electrostimulation: In an application study of electro-stimulation the results were not evaluated statistically, but it was described descriptively that a successful medical treatment can be expected in about 50 % of the cases. Ad 3 : Psychological therapy procedures: Hypnosis did not show positive effectiveness. With regard to biofeedback it can be concluded that this method can be effective in individual cases, however regarded as unreliable from missing reproducibility. Neurobiofeedback could prove that it had a positive therapeutic effect. From eight controlled studies to relaxation techniques and cognitive behaviour therapy four studies showed a therapeutic effectiveness and four failed. Combined therapies proved generally to be more effective than individual types. The behaviour medical psychotherapy could show a positive therapy effect. In a study with cognitive therapy and relaxation (three groups, a passive relaxation, an active relaxation and a cognitive therapy) short-term successes could be stated (for one month), however, the parameters of success returned on the initial value after four months. Also only coincidental and short-term successes could be achieved with cognitive behaviour therapy training, autogenic training and structured group psychotherapy. Ad 4 : Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT) : Unfortunately, the published results of the TRT are methodically frequently bad and scientific of a poor value. Many of the studies presented until now regarding tinnitus retraining therapy are not informative in their scientific context. In a study with 95 patients with a chronic tinnitus TRT could show a significant, more than six months lasting stable success by comparison to a combination of TET with group behaviour therapy (improvement be achieved around at least ten points in the tinnitus questionnaire (TF)). Ad 5 : Pharmacological therapies: Rheological drugs (medicines for hemodilution) could not show any statistically significant effect in the treatment of tinnitus. Studies to the medical treatment with <b>tocainides</b> (lidocaine) showed repeatable positive effects on tinnitus in higher dosages (as of 1. 2 mg/day). Lamotrigine as a medicine had an effect positively only at with a small fraction of patients. Two studies with GABA receptor agonists could not prove therapeutic effects for tinnitus. Undesired side-effects were observed. Injections with Carvoverine (a glutamate antagonist) achieved significantly successes with a special form of tinnitus, the “Cochlear-synaptic tinnitus (CST) ". A tricyclic antidepressant (Amitriptilin) could prove superiority against placebo. This effect could be confirmed in another study. However Clonazepame (a benzodiazepine), could not achieve any improvement. Short-term improvements were achieved with other benzodiazepines (Clonazepame, Diazepam, Flurazepame, Oxacepame and Alprazolame). A German retrospective study suggests a graded pharmacological therapy by means of rheological infusion therapy, applications of neurotransmitters, and injections of lidocaine. This method achieved a disappearance or a recovery of the complaints at 95. 3 % of the acute and 26. 7 % of the chronic cases. Ad 6 : Surgical procedures: The effects of the operative excision of the stapes (stapedectomy) showed significant effects concerning tinnitus. This method is a routine operation to recover hearing, effects on tinnitus were observed only coincidently. There are generally high frequencies of improvements of tinnitus after cochlea implantations; however the risk of deterioration is present with this method. Ad 7 : Other and alternative therapy procedures: The hyperbaric oxygen therapy can be considered successful after acute events with tinnitus. The therapy should be started in the first month after appearance of the tinnitus. The methods transcranial-, electromagnetic and transcutaneous nerve stimulations did not show any significant effects on tinnitus. Also low laser medical treatment showed disappointing effects. The “pneumatic external contra-pulsation” is described as an unproblematic usable procedure by the authors of the examination, but 10 % of the patients had to stop the medical treatment because of complications associated with the medical treatment. Acupuncture showed significant improvements in comparison to medical treatment. The effectiveness of this therapy could not be reproduced in another study. Five other studies between 1993 and 1999 also did not show any therapeutic effect of this method. Gingko-Biloba preparations did not show any positive effects in large-scale studies on tinnitus. Discussion: Neither the diagnostic procedures nor the therapeutic methods or the individual therapies reach a usual scientific level in medicine. Unsolved problems concerning insurance, economic as well as legal problems have resulted for the patients and for caring stuff from this unsatisfactory situation. Numerous competitive tinnitus emergence models led to an incredible creativity in trying out different therapy approaches. No convergence of the therapy procedures can be seen within the last decades of tinnitus research, contrariwise there is always more and more “creativity” of new approaches. Priority has to be given to find the cause of tinnitus since therapies are a consequence of a better understanding of these symptoms that evidence oriented investigations on an usual scientific level can be started. Conclusion: The innumerable therapeutic approaches, seeming completely incoherent to their effects should be coordinated on the meaningfulness, on the success parameters and with patient safety in light of the most plausible explanation models for non-specific chronic Tinnitus. To this the facilities of competence centres or related science- directing facilities are recommendable. Examinations which are carried out also with small numbers show often methodical insufficiencies. It is necessary that minimal requirements on a scientifically clinical experiment, such as design, case number calculation, analytic statistics, control group, are fulfilled. It is recommendable, that further research has to be promoted regarding tinnitus causes that a coordinated evidence-orientated treatment will be developed...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficacy}} and tolerance of <b>tocainide</b> used alone and {{in combination with}} quinidine were studied in 20 patients with coronary artery disease and frequent (≥ 30 /h) ventricular premature complexes. Holter electrocardiographic monitoring was performed at baseline and during therapy with <b>tocainide</b> alone, quinidine alone and a combination of <b>tocainide</b> and quinidine. During single drug therapy, the dose of <b>tocainide</b> was 1, 680 ± 437 mg/day and that of quinidine was 1, 340 ± 235 mg/day. During combination therapy, with smaller doses of <b>tocainide</b> (1, 350 ± 394 mg/day) and quinidine (1, 060 ± 268 mg/day) in many patients, no patient had side effects. At baseline before therapy, the mean ventricular premature complexes/h were 629 ± 567, couplets/h were 23. 9 ± 29. 7 and nonsustained ventricular tachycardias/ 24 h were 60. 5 ± 152. 2. Compared with baseline values (100 %), the frequency of ventricular premature complexes was reduced to 33 ± 44 % with quinidine, 39 ± 30 % with <b>tocainide</b> and 10 ± 16 % with combination therapy (p 83 % reduction of ventricular premature complexes and abolition of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia) was found in 3 (15 %) of 20 patients receiving <b>tocainide</b> alone, in 6 (30 %) receiving quinidine alone and in 16 (80 %) receiving combination therapy (p < 0. 01 for <b>tocainide</b> versus combination, quinidine versus combination; p = NS for <b>tocainide</b> versus quinidine). Thus, the antiarrhythmic effects of quinidine and <b>tocainide</b> are additive. A combination of quinidine and <b>tocainide</b> in smaller and well tolerated doses may avoid dose-related side effects and {{is more effective than}} either drug used alone at higher doses. Therefore, when quinidine or <b>tocainide</b> is ineffective because dose-related side effects limit the maximal tolerated dose, combination therapy in smaller and tolerable doses may avoid side effects and may be more effective than either drug alone at the maximal tolerated dose...|$|E
40|$|Within {{six hours}} of {{suspected}} acute myocardial infarction, 791 patients entered a randomised double blind study of combined intravenous and oral <b>tocainide</b> for the prophylaxis of primary ventricular fibrillation. Acute myocardial infarction was confirmed in 559 patients, of whom 278 had received <b>tocainide.</b> The study was terminated {{on the basis of}} a sequential statistical analysis which showed that in these patients <b>tocainide</b> was unlikely to reduce the incidence of primary ventricular fibrillation by as much as 50 %, primary ventricular fibrillation having occurred in 4 % of the <b>tocainide</b> and 2 % of the placebo patients. Significantly fewer <b>tocainide</b> treated patients were withdrawn for other serious ventricular arrhythmias. Mortality (1 % in the <b>tocainide</b> group and 2 % in the placebo group) was low with no statistically significant differences between the active and placebo groups. Unwanted effects of treatment were infrequent and rarely troublesome both in patients with and without acute myocardial infarction. These results suggest that in the dosage used in this study <b>tocainide</b> does not exert an antifibrillatory action in the early phase of acute myocardial infarction...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} the hemodynamic effects of combined administration of metoprolol and <b>tocainide</b> in nine patients with uncomplicated acute myocardial infarction. After 24 h of treatment with oral metoprolol (50 mg q. 8 h), intravenous <b>tocainide</b> was given (750 mg over 15 min), followed by oral administration of both drugs (50 mg metoprolol q. 8 h; 800 mg <b>tocainide,</b> then 400 mg q. 8 h). Hemodynamic variables were measured {{before and after}} 25 h of oral metoprolol treatment, immediately after intravenous <b>tocainide</b> (at 15 and 30 min), and then during continued oral treatment with both drugs (at 2 h 15 min and 25 h 45 min). Following injection of <b>tocainide,</b> cardiac index changed significantly (2. 7 - 2. 3 L/min. m 2; p< 0. 01), but the increases in pulmonary wedge pressure (9 - 13 mm Hg) and total systemic resistance (15. 9 - 18. 1 IU) were not significant. During the continued oral treatment with both metoprolol and <b>tocainide</b> no significant hemodynamic interaction was observed. We conclude that the injection of <b>tocainide</b> can slightly and transiently depress left ventricular function in patients treated with metoprolol.

40|$|The {{effects of}} 10 and 20 mg/l of <b>tocainide</b> on transmembrane action {{potential}} characteristics {{were examined in}} Purkinje fibers surviving infarction. Infarcted tissue was obtained from canine hearts 24 h after coronary artery ligation. The preparation was stimulated at basic cycle lengths (BCL) of 1000 - 300 ms. <b>Tocainide</b> reduced the overshoot and amplitude of Purkinje fibers surviving infarction. The maximum upstroke velocity (V̇(max)) was decreased by <b>tocainide</b> in a dose dependent manner. This effect was more prominent at the shorter BCL. Statistical analysis revealed a significant interaction of the BCL with the drug effect on overshoot, amplitude, V̇(max) and action potential durations (APD 50 (%) and APD 90 (%)). <b>Tocainide</b> reduced the effective refractory period (ERP) at the BCL of 1000 ms, but had no significant effect at the BCL of 300 ms. Membrane responsiveness and steady state characteristics of V̇(max) were shifted significantly to more negative membrane potentials by <b>tocainide.</b> Investigation of the recovery kinetics of V̇(max) {{in the presence of}} <b>tocainide</b> showed an exponential recovery of V̇(max) with a time constant of 514 ms. These results support the finding that the effect of <b>tocainide</b> on V̇(max) and conduction is enhanced at faster rates of stimulation. Thus <b>tocainide</b> may be able to depress conduction to produce bidirectional block in the termination of ventricular tachycardia caused by reentry, while having minimal effect on conduction at normal heart rates. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Intracellular action {{potentials}} {{were recorded}} from normal canine Purkinje fibers using the standard microelectrode technique. The effects of lidocaine (2 and 5 mg/l), <b>tocainide</b> (10 and 20 mg/l) and verapamil (0. 5 and 1. 0 mg/l) on action potential characteristics {{as well as}} conduction times were measured at cycle lengths of 1000, 800, 600, 500, 400 and 300 ms. Lidocaine and <b>tocainide</b> shortened APD(50 %) and APD(90 %), and verapamil shortened APD(50 %) and lengthened APD(90 %). All of these effects were greatest at the longest cycle lengths. A similar interaction of changes in ERP with cycle length was observed for lidocaine and <b>tocainide.</b> Verapamil increased ERP but this effect was not significant. <b>Tocainide</b> and verapamil reduced dV/dt(max) while lidocaine had no significant effect. All three drugs dv/dt(max) and conduction times were observed. These results indicate {{that many of the}} electrophysiological effects of lidocaine, <b>tocainide</b> and verapamil are modified by cycle length. We propose that future studies on the electrophysiology of antiarrhythmic drugs should include stimulation both at long and short cycle lengths. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Lidocaine and <b>tocainide</b> had {{no effect}} on {{ventricular}} conduction of extrasystoles with coupling intervals longer than 500 msec in isolated blood-perfused dog hearts, but caused interval-related increases in conduction time of extrasystoles in the range of 250 - 400 msec, here called mid-range extrasystoles (MRE). Quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, and methyl lidocaine increased conduction times of extrasystoles at all coupling intervals, and no additional slowing of MRE was observed. The slowing of MRE specific to lidocaine and <b>tocainide</b> was confirmed in the intact dog heart. During acute myocardial ischemia in the intact dog heart, conduction was slowed and additional slowing of MRE was found. Lidocaine and <b>tocainide</b> caused further slowing of conduction of MRE. This unique effect of lidocaine and <b>tocainide</b> on the conduction of MRE may be important in the suppression of the reentrant arrhythmias. However, lidocaine and <b>tocainide</b> were also found to be arrhythmogenic when extrasystoles were introduced, after acute coronary occlusion, in those animals in which such occlusion alone did not allow demonstration of arrhythmias due to extrasystoles. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} TTS-scopolamine, dimenhydrinate, lidocaine, and <b>tocainide</b> on motion {{sickness}} and vertigo and on caloric and postrotatory nystagmus were evaluated in healthy volunteers.

Lidocaine and <b>tocainide</b> were administered intravenously (average plasma concentration of lidocaine 6 mol X L- 1 and of <b>tocainide</b> 20 mol X L- 1). TTS-scopolamine and dimenhydrinate significantly reduced vertigo induced by calorization of the ears, nausea provoked with Coriolis maneuvre, and nystagmus in caloric and rotatory tests. During treatment with lidocaine and <b>tocainide</b> no alleviation of vertigo and nausea was observed. Caloric nystagmus was reduced but rotation induced nystagmus was virtually unchanged. Presumably the motion sickness drugs act at the brain stem where TTS-scopolamine and dimenhydrinate have their target {{cells in the}} vestibular nuclei. Furthermore, the alleviation of motion sickness was linked to a decline of nystagmus.

40|$|Mexiletine and <b>tocainide</b> are {{lidocaine}} congeners {{that share}} similar chemical structures. Clinical {{studies suggest that}} the in vivo inhib-itory effect of mexiletine on the CYPIA family of isoforms is sub-stantially greater than that of <b>tocainide.</b> We investigated the inhib-itory property of mexiletine, lidocaine, and <b>tocainide</b> on the in vitro activity of the cytochrome P 4501 A 1 (CYPIAI) isozyme in the rat. Hepatic microsomes were prepared from rat livers induced with 3 -methylcholanthrene. The rate of ethoxyresorufin-O-dealkylation (EROD) was used as an index of CYPIAI activity. Vmax and KM of the reactions were determined from Lineweaver-Burk plots. The K 1 values for the inhibitors were derived from Dixon plots. Results showed that mexiletine is a competitive inhibitor, lidocaine is a mixed inhibitor, and <b>tocainide</b> is a noncompetitive inhibitor of EROD. The K 1 values for mexiletine and <b>tocainide</b> were 0. 30 ± 0. 02 mM and 12. 4 ± 0. 7 mM, respectively. Two K 1 values for lidocaine were determined.

40|$|<b>Tocainide</b> is {{effective}} in the symptomatic treatment of myotonic syndromes {{for its ability to}} reduce the high frequency discharges of action potentials typical of the disease, by blocking voltage-gated sodium channels. However, its use is restricted by serious side effects. In spite of its chiral structure, <b>tocainide</b> is clinically used as a racemic mixture. Since the optical isomers may differ in their efficacy and toxicity, the present study was aimed at evaluating the antimyotonic activity of the pure R(-) and S(+) enantiomers of <b>tocainide,</b> on the abnormal membrane hyperexcitability of external intercostal muscle fibers of congenitally myotonic goats. The excitability parameters were recorded in vitro by means of the standard two-microelectrode current-clamp technique before and after the addition of the compounds. The R(-) enantiomer of <b>tocainide</b> at concentrations as low as 10 microM potently counteracted the abnormal excitability of myotonic fibers, by increasing the threshold current, and decreasing the latency of the action potential and firing capability. Also, this concentration of R-(-) <b>tocainide</b> almost completely abolished the abnormal spontaneous electrical activity occurring in about 70 - 80 % of the myotonic fiber. The S(+) enantiomer was remarkably less potent since up to 100 microM did not restore the normal excitability pattern.

The kinetics of onset of drug-induced Vmax depression and the time course of Vmax recovery were studied after exposure to therapeutic concentrations of <b>tocainide</b> (50,uM) and quinidine (5,uM) both singly and in combination. The rate constant for onset of block during a drive train at a cycle length of 600 msec was 0. 95 ± 0. 32 pulses in the presence of <b>tocainide</b> and 5. 61 ± 0. 50 pulses in the presence of quinidine. The magnitude of block was three times greater with quinidine than with <b>tocainide.</b> The magnitude of block produced by the combination was no greater than that produced by quinidine alone and may be partly due to abbreviation of action potentia...|$|E
40|$|Mexiletine and <b>tocainide</b> were {{administered}} to 79 patients {{to determine whether the}} response to one of these drugs would predict the effect of the other. In 57 patients, the two agents were evaluated noninvasively with monitoring and exercise testing, and efficacy was judged by the suppression of spontaneous ventricular arrhythmia. In the remaining 22 patients, electrophysiologic testing was performed and efficacy was defined as the inability to induce more than two repetitive ventricular premature beats. An equal number of patients responded to mexiletine and <b>tocainide</b> (38 versus 39 %). However, in only 42 patients (53 %) were the results concordant. There was no difference in concordance when the results were analyzed by method of drug evaluation, left ventricular ejection fraction or etiology of presenting arrhythmia. It is concluded that mexiletine and <b>tocainide</b> have different clinical effects and must be evaluated individually...|$|E
40|$|Mexiletine, lidocaine, and <b>tocainide</b> are class IB {{antiarrhythmic}} {{drugs that}} are used {{for the treatment of}} ventricular arrhythmias and are known to inhibit drug metabolism.

40|$|Searching for the {{structural}} requirements improving the potency and the stereoselectivity of Na(+) channel blockers as antimyotonic agents, new derivatives of <b>tocainide,</b> {{in which the}} chiral carbon atom is constrained in a rigid alpha-proline or pyrrolo-imidazolic cycle, were synthesized as pure enantiomers. 2. Their ability to block Na(+) currents, elicited from - 100 to - 20 mV at 0. 3 Hz (tonic block) and 2 - 10 Hz (use-dependent block) frequencies, was investigated in vitro on single fibres of frog semitendinosus muscle using the vaseline-gap voltage-clamp method. 3. The alpha-proline derivative, To 5, was 5 and 21 fold more potent than <b>tocainide</b> in producing tonic and 10 Hz-use-dependent block, respectively. Compared to To 5, the presence of one methyl group on the aminic (To 6) or amidic (To 7) nitrogen atom decreased use-dependence by 2 - and 6 -times, respectively. When methylene moieties were present on both nitrogen atoms (To 8), both tonic and use-dependent block were reduced. 4. Contrarily to <b>tocainide,</b> all proline derivatives were stereoselective in relation to an increased rigidity. A further increase in the molecular rigidity as in pyrrolo-imidazolic derivatives markedly decreased the drug potency with respect to <b>tocainide.</b> 5.

40|$|AbstractThe {{production}} of an anterior myocardial infarction {{as part of}} an experimental animal model for sudden death was burdened by a persistently elevated mortality rate (30 %) despite the use of traditional antiarrhythmic drugs. Mortality was reduced when <b>tocainide</b> (600 mg three times daily) was empirically administered for 4 days before and 4 days after myocardial infarction. Retrospective analysis showed that mortality at 4 days after infarction was significantly lower in the tocainide-treated dogs than in the preceding large group of dogs that had not been so treated (5 [9 %] of 55, versus 64 [32 %] of 199, p < 0. 01). This difference was still evident 30 days after myocardial infarction (13 [24 %] of 55 versus 83 [42 %] of 199; p < 0. 05). This observation led to the present prospective study in 106 dogs with a similar protocol but with a randomized sequence. At 4 days after myocardial infarction, the mortality rate was 55 % lower in the <b>tocainide</b> group than in the control group (7 [12. 5 %] of 56 versus 14 [28 %] of 50; p < 0. 05). During the 10 days after treatment withdrawal 9 (18 %) of 49 dogs in the <b>tocainide</b> group died compared with only 2 (5 %) of 36 in the control group. This rebound in mortality produced similar survival figures in the two groups at 14 and at 30 days after infarction when mortality was 30 % (17 of 56) in the <b>tocainide</b> group and 34 % (17 of 50) in the control group. The <b>tocainide</b> plasma levels were 7. 4 ± 4 μg/ml the day before infarction and 7. 2 ± 3 μg/ml 3 days after infarction. This study indicates that mortality in the first few days after myocardial infarction can be reduced by <b>tocainide.</b> The results may be of potential interest for the out of hospital management of patients with a recent myocardial infarction...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} both enantiomers of <b>tocainide</b> and {{of some of}} its chiral analogs on the {{inactivation}} of the sodium current in human myoballs were investigated with the whole-cell recording technique. Structure and electron densities of the applied compounds were calculated and compared to the results. Both the R(-) and the S(+) enantiomers had little effect on fast inactivation determined with short prepulses according to Hodgkin and Huxley (1952; h∞ curve). When the inactivating prepulses used in this pulse protocol were prolonged to 1024 ms, both <b>tocainide</b> enantiomers increased inactivation severely, suggesting that the drug binds to the channel when it is in the state of intermediate inactivation (Fakler et al. 1990). Tetrodotoxin-resistant 'juvenile' sodium channels were more affected than tetrodotoxin-sensitive 'adult' channels. The R form was four times as effective as the S form. The compound obtained by substitution of the methyl group on the chiral centre of <b>tocainide</b> with a benzyl group, although in the less potent S form, affected inactivation of the juvenile sodium channels much more than the potent (R) -tocainide. Two additional substitutions, performed on the aromatic ring of <b>tocainide,</b> gave a compound that was most potent in shifting the inactivation curves, but without any selectivity for juvenile or adult channels...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{voltage-gated}} sodium {{channels in}} {{the transmission of}} neuropathic pain is well recognized. For instance, genetic evidence recently indicate that the human Nav 1. 7 sodium channel subtype {{plays a crucial role}} in the ability to perceive pain sensation and may represent an important target for analgesic/anti-hyperalgesic drugs. In this study a newly synthesized <b>tocainide</b> congener, named NeP 1, was tested in vitro on recombinant hNav 1. 4 and hNav 1. 7 channels using patch-clamp technique and, in vivo, in two rat models of persistent neuropathic pain obtained either by chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve or by oxaliplatin treatment. NeP 1 efficiently blocked hNav 1. 4 and hNav 1. 7 channels in a dose- and use-dependent manner, being by far more potent than <b>tocainide.</b> Importantly, the new compound displayed a remarkable use-dependent effect, which likely resulted from a very high affinity for inactivated compared to closed channels. In both models of neuropathic pain, NeP 1 was greatly more potent than <b>tocainide</b> in reverting the reduction of pain threshold in vivo. In oxaliplatin-treated rats, NeP 1 even produced greater and more durable anti-hyperalgesia than the reference drug tramadol. In addition, in vivo and in vitro studies suggest a better toxicological and pharmacokinetic profile for NeP 1 compared to <b>tocainide.</b> Overall, these results indicate NeP 1 as a new promising lead compound for further development in the treatment of chronic pain of neuropathic origin...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the enantiomers of {{mexiletine}} were tested on sodium currents of frog skeletal muscle fibers recorded {{by means of the}} three vaseline gap voltage clamp method and compared with the effects produced by <b>tocainide</b> enantiomers. The R-(-) mexiletine produced a tonic block of the sodium current, elicited by single depolarizing test pulses from the holding potential of - 100 mV to - 20 mV, with an IC 50 of 43. 9 ± 1 μM, whereas the corresponding S-(+) enantiomer produced the same effects at about twofold higher concentrations. A similar stereoselectivity was observed with <b>tocainide</b> enantiomers, but a about 5 fold higher concentrations. Both the R-(-) and S-(+) enantiomers of mexiletine and <b>tocainide</b> produced a further use-dependent block of sodium currents when the test pulse was applied repetitively at a frequency of 2 Hz. The use dependent behaviour led to a significant lowering of the IC 50 values with respect to the tonic block but the eudismic ratios ([IC 50 S-(+) ]/[IC 50 R(-) ]) and the relative potency between mexiletine and <b>tocainide</b> were maintained. All the tested compounds produced a left shift of the steady state inactivation curves (h(∞)), suggesting a high-affinity interaction with the inactivated sodium channels. Again a stronger potency of R-(-) vs. S-(+) enantiomers and of mexiletine vs. <b>tocainide</b> was observed. The excitability characteristics recorded from the semitendinosus muscle by the two microelectrode technique were modified by the tested drugs in agreement with their ability to block sodium current. Thus a concentration-related increase in the threshold current required to elicit an action potential was observed along with a decrease in the amplitude and a shortening of the latency of action potential and a decrease in the firing capability of the membrane. Again the R-(-) isomers were more potent than the S-(+) ones and mexiletine was more effective than <b>tocainide.</b> These data corroborate the presence of a stereospecific site for these drugs on adult skeletal muscle sodium channels. The constant eudismic ratios between the enantiomers during both tonic and use-dependent block suggest that the increase in the apparent affinity of the receptor during state-dependent conformational changes of the channel does not enhance its stereospecificity. The decrease in effective concentration upon high frequency stimulation supports the potential usefulness of low doses of R-(-) mexiletine in the treatment of the abnormal hyperexcitability of the myotonic muscles, with a likely reduction of unwanted side effects...|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} {{mechanism}} of use dependence, we investigated the influence of 0. 5 mM <b>tocainide</b> on the amplitude of sodium currents elicited by membrane depolarizations with standard test pulses in voltage-clamped human myoballs. For comparison, the experiments were also conducted with 1 mM benzocaine, a drug with almost no use dependence. These concentrations were so chosen that without stimulation and at a holding potential of - 135 mV, either drug blocked about 50 % of the channels (tonic block). With repetitive stimulation at 1 Hz, <b>tocainide</b> blocked about 75 % of the channels that had remained open in the rested state (phasic block), while benzocaine had little such effect. The potential dependence of steady-state inactivation (h∞ curves) of the sodium channels in these myoballs depended on {{the duration of the}} prepotential indicating that they possess at least two states of inactivation: fast and intermediate. The two drugs differed in their effects on these two states. Benzocaine always produced a left-shift of the h∞ curve, no matter whether the duration of the conditioning pulse was short (8 ms) or long (512 ms) indicating that it can bind when the channel is in the state of fast inactivation. <b>Tocainide</b> shifted the h∞ curve only with long prepulses, i. e. when the sodium channels were in the state of intermediate inactivation. The recovery from inactivation, a process governed by two time constants in the absence of drugs, was also differently influenced by the two drugs. In the presence of <b>tocainide,</b> the channels mainly recovered with the slow time constant and this time constant was significantly increased, whereas benzocaine did not substantially modify this biphasic process. The results are in agreement with the hypothesis that drug binding depends {{on the state of the}} channel. The different use dependences of <b>tocainide</b> and benzocainide are explained by the fact that they bind favourably to the sodium channels when they are in the states of intermediate and fast inactivation, respectively...|$|E
40|$|On {{the basis}} of a 3 D-QSAR study, a new {{generation}} of <b>tocainide</b> analogues were designed and synthesized as voltage-gated skeletal muscle sodium channel blockers. Data obtained by screening new compounds by means of Hille-Campbell Vaseline gap voltage-clamp recordings showed that the elongation of the alkyl chain and the introduction of lipophilic and sterically hindered groups on the amino function enhance both potency and use-dependent block. The results provide additional indications about the structural requirement of pharmacophores for further increasing potency and state-dependent block and allowed us to identify a new <b>tocainide</b> analogue (6 f) with a favorable pharmacodynamic profile to be proposed as a valid candidate for studies aimed at evaluating its usefulness in the treatment of myotonias...|$|E
