5|$|Ardhanarishvara {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{iconographic}} forms of Shiva. It is found in more or less all temples and shrines dedicated to Shiva all over India and South-east Asia. There is ample evidence from texts and the multiple depictions of the Ardhanarishvara in stone <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> cult centred around the deity may have existed. The cult may have had occasional followers, but was never aligned to any sect. This cult focusing on the joint worship of Shiva and the Goddess may even have had a high position in Hinduism, but when and how it faded away remains a mystery. Though a popular iconographic form, temples dedicated to the deity are few. A popular one is located in Thiruchengode, while five others are located in Kallakkurichi taluk, all of them in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.|$|E
5|$|In 615, some of Muhammad's {{followers}} {{emigrated to}} the Ethiopian Aksumite Empire and founded a small colony {{under the protection of}} the Christian Ethiopian emperor Aṣḥama ibn Abjar. Ibn Sa'ad mentions two separate migrations. According to him, most of the Muslims returned to Mecca prior to Hijra, while a second group rejoined them in Medina. Ibn Hisham and Tabari, however, only talk about one migration to Ethiopia. These accounts agree that Meccan persecution {{played a major role in}} Muḥammad's decision <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> number of his followers seek refuge among the Christians in Abyssinia. According to the famous letter of ʿUrwa preserved in al-Tabari, the majority of Muslims returned to their native town as Islam gained strength and high ranking Meccans, such as Umar and Hamzah converted.|$|E
5|$|The {{increasing}} {{population of}} Catholics in the Indies led Mgr. Petrus Willekens, then Vicar Apostolic of Batavia, <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> new apostolic vicariate {{be established in}} Central Java, headquartered in Semarang, as the area was culturally different and geographically separate from Batavia. The Apolistic Vicariate of Batavia was split in two on 25June 1940; the eastern half became the Apostolic Vicariate of Semarang. On 1August 1940 Willekens received a telegram from Pro-Secretary of State Giovanni Battista Montini ordering that Soegijapranata be {{put in charge of}} the newly established apostolic vicariate. This was forwarded to Soegijapranata in Yogyakarta, who agreed to the appointment, despite being surprised and nervous. His assistant Hardjosoewarno later recalled that Soegijapranata cried after reading the telegram– an uncharacteristic response– and, when eating a bowl of soto, asked if Hardjosoewarno had ever seen a bishop eating the dish.|$|E

5|$|In the Malaysian case Tan Tek Seng v. Suruhanjaya Perkhidmatan Pendidikan (1996), the {{appellant}} had appealed {{against his}} wrongful dismissal from employment {{on the grounds}} of procedural unfairness. One of the issues brought up was whether an unfair procedure meant that he had been deprived of his constitutional right to life or liberty protected by Article 5(1) of the Malaysian Constitution, which is identical to Singapore's Article 9(1). Judge of the Court of Appeal Gopal Sri Ram held that the courts should take into consideration the unique characteristics and situation of the country, and must not be blind to the realities of life. He went on <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> liberal approach be adopted to grasp the intention of the framers of the Constitution by giving life a broad and liberal meaning. He opined that such an interpretation would include elements that form the quality of life, namely the right to seek and be engaged in lawful and gainful employment, and the right to live in a reasonably healthy and pollution-free environment. He also noted that life cannot be extinguished or taken away except according to procedure established by law.|$|E

25|$|Another {{possible}} {{issue is}} that, although the Alcubierre metric {{is consistent with}} Einstein's equations, general relativity does not incorporate quantum mechanics.

25|$|Perhaps most worrisome were {{experiments}} that suggested the A-9 and scissile phosphates must come within about 4 Å {{of one another}} in the transition-state, based upon double phosphorothioate substitution and soft metal ion rescue experiments; the distance between these phosphates in the minimal hammerhead crystal structure was about 18 Å, with no clear mechanism for close approach if the Stem II and Stem I A-form helices were treated as rigid bodies. Taken together, these results appeared <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> fairly large-scale conformational change must have taken place in order to reach the transition-state within the minimal hammerhead ribozyme structure.|$|E

25|$|The {{village of}} Pompignan is located a day's journey (25km) from Toulouse {{on the natural}} road along the right bank of the Garonne to Bordeaux, {{and it was a}} way stop even in pre-Roman times. Its name is derived from Pompinianum, the domain of Pompinius, a notable of the Gallo-Roman era, whose villa was sited {{on the edge of the}} {{hillside}} about a kilometer south of the present chateau. There is evidence <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> ninth-century feudal manor house existed on or close to the present chateau site. The modern village grew up at the foot of the chateau in the time of the Lefrancs, and its layout and facilities were shaped by the needs and gifts of the owners.|$|E

500|$|The village {{name has}} been spelled in various ways, {{including}} Seldene (11th century), Schalden, Scaldeden, or Scaudedene (12th century), and Chalden or Scalden (13th century). There is evidence of Roman occupation in the village, with several Roman coins and pottery remains being found near Shalden school in 1905.

500|$|Direct {{studies on}} {{sentence}} spacing include those by Loh, Branch, Shewanown, and Ali (2002); Clinton, Branch, Holschuh, and Shewanown (2003); and Ni, Branch, and Chen (2004), with results favoring neither single, double, nor triple spacing. The 2002 study tested participants' reading speed for single and double sentence spaced passages of on-screen text. [...] The authors stated that [...] "the 'double space group' consistently took longer {{time to finish}} than the 'single space' group" [...] but concluded that [...] "there was not enough evidence <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> significant difference exists". The 2003 and 2004 studies analyzed on-screen single, double, and triple spacing. [...] In both cases, the authors stated that there was insufficient evidence to draw a conclusion. Ni, Branch, Chen, and Clinton conducted a similar study in 2009 using identical spacing variables. [...] The authors concluded that the [...] "results provided insufficient evidence that time and comprehension differ significantly among different conditions of spacing between sentences".|$|E

500|$|During the Roman {{occupation}} of Britain (AD 43–409), the settlement was [...] "extensive and of considerable importance." [...] Its location along the fen-edge {{may have made}} it economically and administratively significant as a centre for managers and owners of fenland estates. There is evidence <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> road connected Old Sleaford to Heckington (about [...] east), where Roman tile kilns have been uncovered and may imply {{the presence of a}} market at Sleaford. When the first roads were constructed by the Romans, Sleaford was bypassed due to it being [...] "less conveniently located" [...] and more [...] "geared to native needs". A smaller road, Mareham Lane, which the Romans renewed, ran through Old Sleaford, and southwards along the fen edge, towards Bourne. Where it passed through Old Sleaford, excavations have revealed a large stone-built domestic residence, associated farm buildings, corn-driers, ovens and field systems, all from the Roman period, and a number of burials. Other Roman remains, including a burial, have been excavated in the town.|$|E

His live performances, mainly in support of better known musicians, received somewhat mixed but generally favourable reviews. His lack of performing experience and inconsistent approach with audiences was commented upon, while his music was likened to that of Damien Rice and David Gray. In March 2004, with Blunt performing in the support role for Katie Melua in Manchester, Alex McCann of Designer Magazine wrote, [...] "Blunt's ascendance is a dead cert and this time next year it isn't that far removed from reality <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> number one album, Brit Award and countless accolade's [...] will be his for the taking."

500|$|Southern Cross's {{first port}} of call on the Ross Sea voyage was Possession Island, where the tin box left by Borchgrevink and Bull in 1895 was recovered. They then {{proceeded}} southwards, following the Victoria Land coast and discovering further islands, one of which Borchgrevink named after Sir Clements Markham, whose hostility towards the expedition was evidently unchanged by this honour. Southern Cross then sailed on to Ross Island, observed the volcano Mount Erebus, and attempted a landing at Cape Crozier, {{at the foot of}} Mount Terror. Here, Borchgrevink and Captain Jensen were almost drowned by a large wave caused by a calving or breakaway of ice from the adjacent Great Ice Barrier. Following the path of James Clark Ross sixty years previously, they proceeded eastwards along the Barrier edge, to find the inlet where, in 1843, Ross had reached his farthest south. Observations indicated that the Barrier edge had moved some 30 statute miles (50km) south since Ross's time, which meant that the ship were already south of Ross's record. [...] Borchgrevink was determined to make a landing on the Barrier itself, and in the vicinity of Ross's inlet he found a spot where the ice sloped sufficiently <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> landing was possible. On 16 February he, Colbeck and Savio landed with dogs and a sledge, ascended to the Barrier surface, and then journeyed a few miles south to a point which they calculated as 78°50′S, a new Farthest South record. They were the first persons to travel on the Barrier surface, earning Amundsen's approbation: [...] "We must acknowledge that, by ascending the Barrier, Borchgrevink opened the way to the south, and threw aside the greatest obstacle to the expeditions that followed".|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} are scandals or instances of federal corruption {{associated with the}} Ulysses S. Grant presidential administration from 1869 to 1877. Particularly noteworthy are Black Friday and the Whiskey Ring. [...] The Crédit Mobilier is not included as a Grant scandal since the company was founded during the President Abraham Lincoln administration. [...] The fraudulent Emma Silver Mine swindle that involved Ambassador to Britain Robert C. Schenck was a Grant administration embarrassment and is not included as a scandal. [...] An analysis of the scandals and frauds reveals that a majority {{had to do with}} illicit financial gain; the Safe Burglary Conspiracy, however, involved breaking and entering, property damage, and framing an innocent citizen. [...] Two scandals involved women: Black Friday and the Trading Post Ring. [...] Orville E. Babcock, who was indicted in the Whiskey Ring, insinuated that the coded entry [...] "Sylph" [...] signed on communication letters referred to a woman intimately involved with the President. [...] That allegation was never proven and there was nothing <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>a</b> presidential affair took place. [...] Babcock invented the story to frustrate the prosecution. Although Grant was never proven to be directly involved with or to have personally profited from the scandals or frauds, his acceptance of personal gifts and his associations with men of questionable character severely damaged his own presidential legacy and reputation. Most of these scandals began during the eight years of prosperity after the Civil War, while many prominent scandals were exposed after the U.S. economy crashed after the Panic of 1873. [...] The breach of treaty between the Lakotas and the United States, signed in 1868, the year before Grant took office, was engineered by Grant in order to accommodate miners seeking gold in the Black Hills. [...] Known as the Paha Sapa (literally, [...] "hills that are black"), this area was essential to the survival of the Lakota living in Unceded Territory (versus those living on the Great Sioux Reservation), as a game reserve.|$|E
