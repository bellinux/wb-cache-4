25|$|Pace bowlers {{will often}} be found fielding {{in the third}} man, fine leg and deep {{backward}} square positions during the overs between those they are bowling. These positions mean that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> correct end for their bowling over.

They also usually have an ability to throw the ball long distances accurately.|$|E
25|$|Time is {{sometimes}} used (instead of angle) to express {{position within the}} cycle of an oscillation. A phase difference is analogous to two athletes running around a race track {{at the same speed}} and direction but starting at different positions on the track. They pass a point at different instants in time. But the time difference (phase difference) between them is a constant - same for every pass since <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same speed and in the same direction. If they were at different speeds (different frequencies), the phase difference is undefined and would only reflect different starting positions. Technically, phase difference between two entities at various frequencies is undefined and does not exist.|$|E
25|$|While for {{bodies in}} their own {{thermodynamic}} equilibrium states, the notion of temperature requires that all empirical thermometers must agree as to which of two bodies is the hotter or that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same temperature, this requirement is not safe for bodies that are in steady states though not in thermodynamic equilibrium. It can then well be that different empirical thermometers disagree about which is the hotter, {{and if this is}} so, then {{at least one of the}} bodies does not have a well defined absolute thermodynamic temperature. Nevertheless, any one given body and any one suitable empirical thermometer can still support notions of empirical, non-absolute, hotness and temperature, for a suitable range of processes. This is a matter for study in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, x denotes two sounds, {{but it is}} not {{separated}} at the boundary of two syllables (e.g. ta-xi rather than *tak-szi, based on phonetics). Long double consonants are separated and their original forms are restored if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> boundary of two syllables (e.g. meggyes ‘cherry-flavoured’ > megy-gyes). Although not incorrect, it is not recommended to leave a single vowel at the end or the beginning of a line (e.g. Á-ron, Le-a). Double vowels can be separated (e.g. váku-um ‘vacuum’), and long consonants can also be separated (e.g. ton-na ‘ton’). Inflectional suffixes are not considered elements on their own (e.g. although the stem of pénzért ‘for money’ is pénz, its hyphenation is pén-zért rather than *pénz-ért).|$|E
25|$|Features {{that affect}} {{prognosis}} are tumor thickness in millimeters (Breslow's depth), depth related to skin structures (Clark level), type of melanoma, presence of ulceration, presence of lymphatic/perineural invasion, presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (if present, prognosis is better), location of lesion, presence of satellite lesions, and presence of regional or distant metastasis. Certain types of melanoma have worse prognoses {{but this is}} explained by their thickness. Interestingly, less invasive melanomas even with lymph node metastases carry a better prognosis than deep melanomas without regional metastasis at time of staging. Local recurrences tend to behave similarly to a primary unless <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> site of a wide local excision (as opposed to a staged excision or punch/shave excision) since these recurrences tend to indicate lymphatic invasion.|$|E

Although they were once widespread, they now are confined to isolated populations in inland freshwater lakes that have a suitable habitat. They are isolated in their respective lakes since the last Ice age.

25|$|Sigmund Freud {{believed}} {{that as a}} child progresses through each of the different stages in psychosexual development, during {{the third year of}} the child’s life, genitals are thought to become active. As children develop a greater understanding of their own sex they also develop either a castration complex (in boys) or penis envy (in girls). For boys, during the “phallic” stage, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> height of childhood sexuality. During this the Oedipus complex occurs, where the boy feels erotic love for his mother (Electra complex in girls where love is directed towards the father). As time progresses and the boy matures, he is slowly able {{to let go of the}} rival feelings he has towards his father and free himself from his love for his parents. At this time, the boy learns to emulate masculine attributes from his father and subsequently to identify with him.|$|E
25|$|The {{two most}} popular teams in Peru are Universitario and Alianza Lima. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top of the polls {{conducted}} by many different groups. The group Apoyo, Opinion y Mercado in 2006 revealed that Alianza Lima was popular amongst 35%, followed by Universitario, with 32%. In 2005, a study by Grupo de Opinión Pública de la Universidad de Lima showed that Universitario {{was the most popular}} team in Lima and Callao with 31.7% followed by Alianza Lima with 29.3%. However, in 2006 and 2007 Alianza Lima appeared first in their polls. There was a narrow margin in 2007 as Alianza Lima reached 29.6% and Universitario followed with 29.5% under a margin of error of ±4.16% In 2009, the university's results varied because Alianza reached first with 40% and Universitario second with 35.5% under a margin of error of ±4.47%. Another group known as CPI, revealed in May 2008 that Universitario was favored by 32% whilst Alianza Lima was favored by 33.5% under a margen of error of 2.7% at the national level. This report was divided into two parts. In the metropolitan capital, Universitario led with 42.8% and Alianza tailed behind with 39.9%. In the rest of the country, Universitario had a larger lead with 31.5% opposed to Alianza's 24.1%. In 2009, CPI released another poll indicating the Universitario was still the most popular team in Peru with 38.6% while Alianza reached 33.1%. A survey conducted by Grupo de Opinión Pública de la Universidad de Lima in February 2009, said that Alianza Lima ranked first in popularity with 27.2%; Universitario second with 26.6%. However, a second poll released by the same university group in September of the same year ranked Universitario first with 37.9% and Alianza second with 36.6%. The most recent report from the group indicates that Universitario has more sympathizers than Alianza with 40.6% over 36.% in the Province of Lima and Callao. On 2010, South American Football Confederation (Conmebol) stated that Universitario is the most popular team in Perú.|$|E

During both periods, however, the models’ fundamentals explain only a small portion (10 - 15 percent) of reserves volatility. ...|$|R
