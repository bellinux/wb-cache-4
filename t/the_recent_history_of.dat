5|$|L. decemlineata is {{an iconic}} species {{and has been}} used as an image on stamps because of its {{association}} with <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> both North America and Europe. For example, in 1956, Romania issued a set of four stamps calling attention to the campaign against insect pests and it was featured on a 1967 stamp issued in Austria. The beetle also appeared on stamps issued in Benin, Tanzania, the United Arab Emirates, and Mozambique.|$|E
5|$|Those {{who moved}} to France {{suffered}} ostracism from the Left for their perceived exploitation of native Muslims and some blamed them for the war, thus the political turmoil surrounding {{the collapse of the}} French Fourth Republic. In popular culture, the community is often represented as feeling removed from French culture while longing for Algeria. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the Pieds-Noirs has been imprinted with a theme of double alienation from both their native homeland and their adopted land. Though the term rapatriés d'Algérie implies that they once lived in France, most Pieds-Noirs were born in Algeria. Many families had lived there for generations, and the Algerian Jews, who were considered Pieds-Noirs, were as indigenous to Algeria as its Muslim population.|$|E

5|$|The Dissenters {{proposed}} Robert Webb, who {{had previously}} served as the member for Taunton from 1747 until the general election in 1754, to fill the vacancy. <b>The</b> <b>recent</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the elections in Taunton suggested that no opposition would be offered: the last contested election had been in 1741. That however proved {{not to be the}} case, and a group of Tories put forward their own candidate, Sir John Pole, 5th Baronet of Shute in Devon. Webb did not want the expense of a contested election, and withdrew, leaving the Dissenters without a candidate. Unable to find a suitable candidate, the Dissenters appealed to Lord Egremont to locate someone to stand for the Whiggish interest. The Mayor, Henry Manly, was sent to London to meet with the Whig Prime Minister, Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, to try and secure a candidate. Manly reported that the Duke of Newcastle did not want the seat to go to a Tory, and was willing to fund the election from the secret service account (more accurately the King's private money, a fund which was not accountable to Parliament). Eventually, through communication with both Lord Egremont and the Duke of Newcastle, Robert Maxwell came forward as the Whig candidate. Maxwell offered to spend up to £3,000 on the election, in addition to the money promised from the secret service fund.|$|E

25|$|During <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the grindadráp, {{the tools}} of the catch have modernized. Cellular {{telephones}} and radio allow the islands to be alerted to a sighting within the course of minutes. The use of private motorboats gives the whalers more speed and maneuverability on the water. The dull blowhole hook, adopted in response to concerns over cruelty, had the additional effect of further increasing the effectiveness of Faroese attempting to beach the whales. In spite of how such improvements to the tools could make the grindadráp more effective, the number of pilot whales caught, both overall and per whale drive, is less than in preceding centuries.|$|E

25|$|From the 16thcentury {{up to the}} 1920s Wadsley’s main {{industry}} was cutlery manufacturing; {{at the end of}} the 19thcentury there were over 100 cutler's shops in the village. The industry declined as the small workshops of Wadsley lost business to the large cutlery works of Sheffield. It is generally believed that the last little mester operating as a knife maker in Wadsley was Harry Horsfield who died in 1938. In 1901 Sheffield extended its boundaries and part of Wadsley came within the city; a further expansion in 1923 brought the rest of the village inside the city boundary. <b>The</b> <b>recent</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> Wadsley has been its development as a residential suburb with many houses built, especially in the area between Wadsley Lane and Langsett Avenue, in the 1930s. The original manor house that stood on Laird Road was controversially sold and demolished in 1958 to make way for the Laird Road Flats - after this happened the Wadsley conservation campaign ceased to be a coherent force. Over the next fifteen years most of the small old shops, houses and workshops of Wadsley were demolished virtually without opposition - culminating in the City Council's Wadsley redevelopment programme in 1968.|$|E

500|$|When the STAC {{plans were}} {{presented}} to the UK cabinet, a very negative reaction resulted. The economic considerations were considered highly questionable, especially as these were based on development costs, now estimated to be £150million, which were repeatedly overrun in the industry. The Treasury Ministry in particular presented a very negative view, suggesting {{that there was no}} way the project would have any positive financial returns for the government, especially in light that [...] "the industry's past record of over-optimistic estimating (including <b>the</b> <b>recent</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> the TSR.2) suggests that it would be prudent to consider the £150million [...] to turn out much too low." ...|$|E
500|$|Polemics such as Guilty Men, {{which helped}} {{demolish}} Chamberlain's reputation for {{his foreign policy}} as premier, also touched on his record as minister. These books blamed the National Government, in which Chamberlain had taken a leading role, for a failure to rearm. Historian David Dutton suggested in his book on Chamberlain that the damage to his reputation, both as Prime Minister and as a Cabinet minister, could have been contained had the Conservative Party defended his policies, but for 23years after Chamberlain's death, the party leaders (Churchill, Anthony Eden, and Harold Macmillan) had made reputations as opponents of appeasement, and who were little minded to defend Chamberlain's record as a minister. The Labour landslide in the 1945 General Election cemented this inclination, with Macmillan stating {{that it was not}} [...] "Churchill who had brought the Conservative party so low.
