40|$|Open water {{tests have}} been carried out at the SVA to {{determine}} the effect of the integration of the nozzle in the hull on the characteristics of ducted propeller systems. The integration of different nozzle sectors in the hull was realized by using of dummy models. The integration of the nozzle sectors took place in two variants: - Variante 1 : The entrance and exit area of the nozzle are preserved also in the integrated sector. - Variant 2 : The inner diameter of the nozzle is constant in the integrated sector between the entrance and exit area of the nozzle. Three different nozzle sectors with the angle of #psi#= 90, 135 and 180 have been tested. The characteristics of the ducted propellers K_T_P, K_Q as a function of J show a greater gradient with the increasing of the integrated nozzle sector in the hull. The <b>thrust</b> and torque <b>coefficients</b> grow at low advance coefficients, while the nozzle <b>thrust</b> <b>coefficients</b> decrease. A distinct decreasing of the <b>thrust</b> and torque <b>coefficients</b> is yielding at higher advance coefficients. The influence of the integration of the nozzle have been tested for two nozzle sectors with the angles of #psi#= 90 and 180. The decreasing of the entrance and exit area of the nozzle due to the integration in the hull yields to a distinct decreasing of the nozzle thrust and a distinct increasing of the propeller <b>coefficients</b> at higher <b>thrust</b> loading <b>coefficients.</b> The dependence between the <b>thrust</b> and torque <b>coefficients</b> of the propeller is nearly linear for integrated ducted propeller systems. The way of the integration of the nozzle in the hull and the angle of the integrated nozzle sector don't influence this dependence. The integration of the nozzle up to the inner diameter yields to a decrease of the nozzle thrust and the total thrust of the ducted propeller system for <b>thrust</b> loading <b>coefficients</b> C_T_H> 10. The cavitation observations at constant propeller <b>thrust</b> <b>coefficients</b> have shown a reduction of the cavitation area on the propeller blades with the increasing of the integrated nozzle sector in the hull. The reduction of the cavitation area at the propeller blades can be explained with higher velocities and change of the nozzle and the flow in the diffusor have to be considered for a prediction of the characteristics of integrated ducted propellers. The program DVPFIX was modified for a prediction of the influence of the integration of the nozzle in the hull on the coefficients of the propulsion system.

40|$|The flow {{around an}} {{unsteady}} hydrofoil, undergoing simultaneous heaving and pitching motions which mimic the tail motions of carangiform fish (such as tuna), was investigated using simultaneous particle image velocimetry (PIV) and force measurement. These investigations were performed at Reynolds numbers, {{based on the}} foil chord length, {{in the range of}} 1500 < Re < 12500. The Strouhal numbers, based on the foil heave amplitude, were in the range of 0. 1 < Sth < 0. 95. Hydrogen bubble visualisation was also performed on the foil at identical Sth, but at 500 < Re < 3500. Two force measurements were obtained. Firstly, instantaneous thrust and side forces were obtained by direct strain gauge measurements on the foil, which were then time-averaged. Secondly, time-averaged thrust forces were estimated using a momentum Integral around the time-averaged two-dimensional PIV velocity field around the foil. Both force measurements, which show excellent agreement for all foil parameters, indicate that the foil is able to produce very large <b>thrust</b> <b>coefficients,</b> Ct, in excess of 10. These large <b>thrust</b> <b>coefficients</b> typically occur when the non-dimensional foil heave amplitude is large, at conditions where hydrogen bubble visualisation indicates that large leading edge vortices are generated.

On fixing of propellant composition and its grain geometry nozzle design becomes the controlling factors for optimum performance of rocket. <b>Thrust</b> <b>coefficient</b> {{is one of the}} most important parameters for its performance. It is the thrust per unit chamber pressure and throat area. It is a dimensionless multiplication factor and signifies the degree to which the thrust is amplified by the nozzle. It is a function of gas property i. e. specific heat ratio of the gas and other thermodynamic parameters. It is also a function of nozzle geometry i. e. expansion ratio and pressure ratio. It is highest when the nozzle expands the gases exactly down to ambient pressure at the exit plane. However, <b>thrust</b> <b>coefficient</b> is independent of chamber pressure. In this paper <b>thrust</b> <b>coefficient</b> is analysed as a function of expansion ratio at three different values of specific heat ratio. It is observed that flow separation typically occurs when the ratio of exit pressure to atmospheric pressure is less than 0. 25 to 0. 35 and thus kept less than 0. 40. <b>Thrust</b> <b>coefficient</b> losses are due to divergence of the flow at the nozzle exit, skin friction losses, two-phase flow and also propellant performance.
