25|$|At the {{universities}} of Oxford and Cambridge, the preclinical course {{leads to an}} additional Bachelor of Arts (BA), degree (upgradable after {{three or four years}} to Master of Arts), after which most students used to go elsewhere (but usually to one of the London teaching hospitals) to complete clinical training. They could then take the degrees of their new university: <b>They</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the options of returning to their old university to take the clinical examinations or taking one of the old non-university qualifying examinations. Most students at Oxford and Cambridge now remain in place to take their clinical training.|$|E
25|$|During the occupation, the Japanese {{implemented}} {{policies that}} {{were perceived as}} a continuance of Dutch support for the kerajaan. Under the policies, the kerajaan were able {{to gain access to}} various incomes, titles, and religious authority that <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> in the 1930s. The regaining of Malay aristocrats’ power during the Japanese Occupation has resulted in suppression among the peasant community in East Sumatra. Many Japanese officials managed to exploit food and labour supplies from the peasantry through the kerajaan hierarchy and that had increased the amount of economic pressure faced by the farming population of East Sumatra back then. Consequently, the credibility of those traditional, nationalists and religious leaders, who were assigned by the Japanese, was severely damaged. A new leadership was then formed by a group of pemuda (youth) who had received their formative education under the Japanese military groups (Giyūgun, Heiho and Tokkeitai). The military training guided by Japanese ethics and values has fanned their nationalism and motivated them to defend their lands. These Japanese-trained pemuda then took on active roles in fighting against the Dutch and Malay sultans during the 1946 East Sumatra Social Revolution.|$|E

2500|$|From 1974 {{until his}} 2002 death, Waylon Jennings {{performed}} a song {{he had written}} called [...] "Bob Wills Is Still The King". Released as the B-side of a single that was a double-sided hit, it went to {{number one on the}} country charts. [...] The song has become a staple of classic country radio station formats. [...] In addition, The Rolling Stones performed this song live in Austin, Texas at Zilker Park on their A Bigger Bang Tour, thereby giving the song, and Bob Wills, a broader audience. [...] This performance was included on their subsequent DVD The Biggest Bang. In a 1968 issue of Guitar Player, rock guitarist Jimi Hendrix said of Wills and the Playboys: [...] "I dig them. The Grand Ole Opry used to come on, and I used to watch that. [...] <b>They</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> some pretty heavy cats, some heavy guitar players." ...|$|E
2500|$|Historian Diarmaid Ferriter said: [...] "There'll be broad {{consensus}} {{around what}} Bertie did in Northern Ireland, the social partnership and the unity {{he brought to}} his own party. Also, he made Fianna Fáil the permanent party of government. <b>They</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> all of the power most of the time, but now they have most of the power all of the time. All of that takes skill. But I wonder will people talk about 'Ahernism'? Is there any such thing? What does he actually stand for? In some ways Bertie's lack of vision was a positive, it made him flexible and willing to compromise, and he was certainly outstanding in that regard. But I dissent from the universal plaudits going around at the moment. He had no social or economic vision for the state he led. There was no fire in his belly. He didn't really want to change society for the better. He was the ward boss writ large. But at the moment it seems it's unfashionable to say anything adverse about Bertie." ...|$|E

2500|$|But such probing {{analyses}} {{into various}} shoppers' psyches may have ignored other significant factors affecting men's shopping habits, foremost among them women's shopping habits. As the retail analyst Marshal Cohen {{explained in a}} 2005 article in the New York Times entitled, [...] "Gay or Straight? Hard to Tell", {{the fact that women}} buy less of men's clothing than <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>has,</b> more than any other factor, propelled men into stores to shop for themselves. [...] "In 1985 only 25 percent of all men's apparel was bought by men, he said; 75 percent was bought by women for men. By 1998 men were buying 52 percent of apparel; in 2004 that number grew to 69 percent and shows no sign of slowing." [...] One result of this shift was the revelation that men cared more about how they look than the women shopping for them had.|$|R

That's all I wanted {{to put in the}} song. I just thought that was so gangsta. It was kind of weird, too, now that I really think about it. She used to take her bullets out of the gun and leave the clip in her room and let me play with her gun. I was an only child so I probably got on her nerves that much that she finally gave me her burner, like, 'Here, get the fuck out my face.' [...] I {{just wanted to say that}} so bad." [...] He also added on how he incorporated one of his neighborhood friends on to the record: [...] " [...] speak on my homeboy Rat Tone. He's one of my big homies from my hood. He showed me my first [...] when I was like 11-years-old. I was amazed by it. I thought that shit was tight. <b>They</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> all the shiny shit. That's how we talked.

The odds were disproportionately long, but poor people could bet very small amounts. It was, as <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> say, <b>‘a</b> mugs game’; the organisers did well, while the poor lived on hope...|$|R

50|$|During {{the past}} 10,000 years of inhabitation, Ireland has {{witnessed}} some different peoples arrive on its shores.

30|$|Most {{people now}} say they feel more European than <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to,</b> many <b>having</b> taken part in intra-European {{mobility}} programs for study and work.

Such flexibility also benefits older workers who stay {{in the labor force}} longer, drawing half-pension. EU nations actively recruit educated workers from outside of the EU and provide a support system including language and culture training for their families to assist in integration. All EU nations share the economic and physical burdens of processing illegal immigrants, implementing coordinated integration programs to ensure as many as possible become productive members of their new societies.|$|R
50|$|The {{economic}} {{disparities between}} some classes of European Americans and African Americans have diminished.

African Americans occupy a higher percentage of high-paying jobs within the USA than <b>they</b> <b>used</b> <b>to.</b> This <b>has</b> led <b>to</b> a rapidly increasing black upper-middle class. Many of America's suburbs are becoming diversified with black and white residents coexisting in affluent neighborhoods. With the economic division within similar classes declining between races, African-American movement <b>to</b> the suburbs <b>has</b> resulted in some suburbs becoming more diverse. Other times middle and upper class blacks <b>have</b> chosen <b>to</b> settle in chiefly African-American communities, so their children can grow up in a strong community of their own.|$|R
