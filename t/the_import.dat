40|$|In {{this paper}} we model {{the case of}} an {{international}} non-renewable resource monopolist as a differential game between the monopolist and the governments of <b>the</b> <b>importing</b> countries, and we investigate whether a tariff on the resource importations can be advantageous for <b>the</b> <b>importing</b> countries. We find that the results depend crucially on the kind of strategies <b>the</b> <b>importing</b> country governments can play and on whether the monopolist chooses the price or the extraction rate. For a price-setting monopolist it is shown that <b>the</b> <b>importing</b> countries cannot use a tariff to capture monopoly rents if they are constrained to use open-loop strategies, even if the governments sign a tariff agreement. This result is drastically modified if <b>the</b> <b>importing</b> countries in <b>the</b> tariff agreement use Markov (feedback) strategies. For a quantity-setting monopolist the nature of the game changes and an open-loop tariff is advantageous for <b>the</b> <b>importing</b> countries.

5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the war, the majority of finance for the Southern government came via duties on international trade. <b>The</b> <b>import</b> tariff, enacted in May 1861, was set at 12.5% and it roughly matched in coverage the previously existing Federal tariff, the Tariff of 1857.

However, revenue from the tariffs all but disappeared after the Union imposed its blockade of Southern coasts. By November 1861 the proportion of government revenue coming from custom duties had dropped to one-half of one percent.

In fact, the total revenue raised in this way during the entire war was only about $3.4 million.|$|E

5|$|The {{economic}} {{revolution in}} England and the tariff {{policies of the}} British also caused massive de-industrialization in other sectors throughout India and Mysore. For example, the gunny bag weaving business had been a monopoly of the Goniga people, which they lost when the British began ruling the area. <b>The</b> <b>import</b> of a chemical substitute for saltpetre (potassium nitrate) affected the Uppar community, the traditional makers of saltpetre for use in gunpowder. <b>The</b> <b>import</b> of kerosene affected the Ganiga community which supplied oils. Foreign enamel and crockery industries affected the native pottery business, and mill-made blankets replaced the country-made blankets called kambli. This economic fallout {{led to the formation}} of community-based social welfare organisations to help those within the community to cope better with their new economic situation, including youth hostels for students seeking education and shelter. However, the British economic policies created a class structure consisting of a newly established middle class comprising various blue and white-collared occupational groups, including agents, brokers, lawyers, teachers, civil servants and physicians. Due to a more flexible caste hierarchy, the middle class contained a heterogeneous mix of people from different castes.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the question {{under what conditions}} domestic markets of emission permits would and should merge to become an international market.

In a two-county model, we find {{that it is in}} both countries 2 ̆ 019 interests to form an international market, and it may even be beneficial to the environment. Three different policy instruments of <b>the</b> <b>importing</b> country are examined, namely a price instrument (tariff) and two quantity instruments (discount and import quota). All instruments restrict trade. <b>The</b> <b>importing</b> country (and regulator) prefers an import tariff and an import quota to a carbon discount. If the exporting country releases additional permits, <b>the</b> <b>importing</b> country should not try to keep total emissions constant, as that would be ineffective if not counterproductive. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>importing</b> country should aim to keep <b>the</b> total <b>import</b> constant; this would impose costs on the exporting country that are independent of the policy instrument; an import quota would be the cheapest option for <b>the</b> <b>importing</b> country. Compliance and liability issues constrain the market further. However, both <b>the</b> <b>importing</b> and <b>the</b> exporting country would prefer that the permit seller is liable in case of non-compliance, as sellers 2 ̆ 019 liability would less constrain the market...|$|R

5|$|Until its repeal, most {{extensions}} to {{copyright law}} were based around provisions {{found in the}} Statute of Anne. The one successful bill from the lobbying in the 1730s, which came into force on 29 September 1739, extended the provision prohibiting <b>the</b> <b>import</b> of foreign books to also prohibit <b>the</b> <b>import</b> of books that, while originally published in Britain, were being reprinted in foreign nations and then shipped to England and Wales. This was intended to stop the influx of cheap books from Ireland, and also repealed the price restrictions in the Statute of Anne. Another alteration was over the legal deposit provisions of the Statute, which many booksellers found unfair. Despite an initial period of compliance, the principle of donating copies of books to certain libraries lapsed, {{partly due to the}} unwieldiness of the statute's provisions and partly {{because of a lack of}} cooperation by the publishers. In 1775 Lord North, who was Chancellor of the University of Oxford, succeeded in passing a bill that reiterated the legal deposit provisions and granted the universities perpetual copyright on their works.|$|E
