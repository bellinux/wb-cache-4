While she is there, one of the bodies, now a vampire, gets up. After noticing Dawn has not come back, Buffy goes to look for her and finds her in the morgue, being attacked by the vampire.

Remarkably, many windows {{produced}} in the 1880s and 90s have the recaptured something of the freshness and brightness of the earlier works. They are in strong contrast to those of their pupils, Burlison and Grylls, who specialised in silvery backgrounds with ornate canopies under which stand solidly three-dimensional figures in vast cloaks of wine red and indigo blue.|$|E

25|$|In Chamber of Secrets, Nick is {{a victim}} of the Basilisk that Ginny Weasley unleashes under the {{influence}} of Tom Riddle. The stare of the Basilisk is lethal to anyone who looks it directly in the eye. All of its living victims meet its gaze indirectly, either from a reflection or by seeing it <b>through</b> <b>something</b> else, and are only petrified rather than killed. Nick is the only one to look directly at the Basilisk, but he too is petrified since he is a ghost and cannot die again. Nick also protected Hufflepuff student Justin Finch-Fletchley from death after Justin saw the basilisk's eyes through Nick's transparent body, thus only petrifying him as well.|$|E

Ne-Yo told Vibe magazine, [...] "The best way to express an emotion like love is through storytelling. It makes it more 'I can relate to this character in this song, because I've been <b>through</b> <b>something</b> similar.' You hear that kind of storytelling in the song that I wrote for Rihanna called 'Hate That I Love You'." ...|$|E

In February 2014, Gunn {{revealed that}} the film would incorporate songs from the 1960s and 1970s, such as [...] "Hooked on a Feeling", on a mixtape in Quill's Walkman, which acts as a way for him to stay connected to the Earth, home, and family he lost. In May 2014, Gunn added that using the songs from the 60s and 70s were [...] "cultural reference points", saying, [...] "It’s striking the balance throughout the whole movie, <b>through</b> <b>something</b> that is very unique, but also something that is easily accessible to people at the same time. The music and the Earth stuff is one of those touchstones that we have to remind us that, yeah, [...] is a real person from planet Earth who’s just like you and me. Except that he’s in this big outer space adventure." ...|$|E

500|$|One of {{the editing}} {{techniques}} used in Citizen Kane {{was the use}} of montage to collapse time and space, using an episodic sequence on the same set while the characters changed costume and make-up between cuts so that the scene following each cut would look as if it took place in the same location, but at a time long after the previous cut. In the breakfast montage, Welles chronicles the breakdown of Kane's first marriage in five vignettes that condense 16 years of story time into two minutes of screen time. Welles said that the idea for the breakfast scene [...] "was stolen from The Long Christmas Dinner of Thornton Wilder... a one-act play, which is a long Christmas dinner that takes you <b>through</b> <b>something</b> like 60 years of a family's life." [...] The film often uses long dissolves to signify the passage of time and its psychological effect of the characters, such as the scene in which the abandoned sled is covered with snow after the young Kane is sent away with Thatcher.|$|E

Either I played with them or I played against them. You see each other in different tournaments. Some of them you're really close with, or some them you just say hi and have a couple of laughs with. [...] It struck me when I found out. I was at breakfast and reading the Russian newspapers and all of a sudden, it popped up. It's almost like you don't want to believe something like that. It's tough. You have chills and you just hope that the families will find the strength to fight <b>through</b> <b>something</b> like that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Davis's trumpet and McLaughlin's guitar {{parts were}} heavily overdubbed for the recording. The overdubbing effect {{was created by}} {{superimposing}} part of Davis's trumpet solo onto other parts of it, <b>through</b> <b>something</b> Teo Macero calls a [...] "recording loop". Macero later said of this production technique, [...] "You hear the two parts and it's only two parts, but the two parts become four and they become eight parts. This was done over in the editing room and it just adds something to the music [...] I called [...] in and I said, 'Come in, I think we've got something you'll like. We'll try it on and {{if you like it}} you've got it.' He came in and flipped out. He said {{it was one of the}} greatest things he ever heard". DeJohnette's drums were also manipulated by Macero, who used an automatic switcher to have them rattle back and forth between the left and right speakers on the recording. In his book Running the Voodoo Down: The Electric Music of Miles Davis, Davis-biographer Phil Freeman describes this technique as [...] "100 percent Macero" [...] and writes of its significance to the track as a whole, stating: ...|$|E
2500|$|Spears {{talked about}} her {{feelings}} toward the conservatorship her father contains and how she feels about her life, and quotes [...] "There's no excitement, there's no passion... I have really good days, and then I have bad days. Even {{when you go to}} jail, you know there's the time when you're gonna get out. But in this situation, it's never ending. It's just like Groundhog Day every day." [...] Spears added [...] "I think it's too in control, If I wasn't under the restraints I'm under, I'd feel so liberated. When I tell them the way I feel, it's like they hear but they're really not listening. I never wanted to become one of those prisoner people. I always wanted to feel free." [...] The singer also commented on her feelings towards fans and her music style. [...] "It's weird because your music is a reflection of what you're going through," [...] she says. [...] "It's such a part of me, the record, 'cause of what I've gone through." [...] In another clip, Spears talks about how she uses her work as a dancer and singer to deal with the stress of her life and how it helps her deal with her emotions. She said that for her, dancing is like therapy. [...] "If I have a lot of nervous energy, when I start dancing, it all goes away and I just feel emotion. It's like a rollercoaster," [...] she says. [...] "People think that when you go <b>through</b> <b>something</b> in life {{you have to go to}} therapy. For me, art is therapy, because it's like you're expressing yourself in such a spiritual way. [...] "Sometimes you don't need to use words to go through what you need to go through," [...] she continues. [...] "Sometimes it's an emotion you need to feel when you dance, that you need to touch. And the only thing that can touch it is when you move a certain way." ...|$|E
