5|$|Already {{labeled a}} prodigy {{at the age}} of 15, Ben Arfa joined Lyon, a club <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> won its first ever Ligue 1 championship. In August 2004, after {{spending}} two years in the youth divisions of the Lyon academy, he signed his first professional contract, agreeing to a three-year deal despite late interest from English club Chelsea and Dutch outfit Ajax. Along with fellow youth player Karim Benzema, he was promoted to the senior squad and was assigned the number 34 shirt.|$|E
5|$|The Italian {{participants}} in the revived 1990s tournament were the four teams <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> been relegated from Serie A and the four teams that had finished highest but not been promoted in Serie B. The exception to this was Verona, who were relegated in 1991/92, but did not play in the 1992/93 cup.|$|E

5|$|A {{significant}} event now occurred which {{granted the}} Japanese forces a reprieve. Early on 3 November, Marine units near Koli Point, {{east of the}} Lunga Perimeter, engaged 300 fresh Japanese troops <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> been landed by a Tokyo Express mission of five destroyers. This, plus the knowledge that {{a large body of}} Japanese troops {{was in the process of}} relocating to Koli Point after the defeat in the Henderson Field battle, led the Americans to believe that the Japanese were about to conduct a major attack on the Lunga Perimeter from the Koli Point area.|$|E
5|$|A town <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> over 65,000 {{residents}} in 1940 became America's sixth largest city by 2010, {{with a population}} of nearly 1.5 million, and millions more in nearby suburbs. When the war ended, many of the men who had undergone their training in Arizona returned bringing their new families. Learning of this large untapped labor pool enticed many large industries to move their operations to the area. In 1948 high-tech industry, which would become a staple of the state's economy, arrived in Phoenix when Motorola chose Phoenix for the site of its new research and development center for military electronics. Seeing the same advantages as Motorola, other high-tech companies such as Intel and McDonnell Douglas would also move into the valley and open manufacturing operations.|$|E
5|$|After the Reform Bill was {{rejected}} in the Lords, the House of Commons immediately passed a {{motion of confidence}} affirming their support for Lord Grey's administration. Because parliamentary rules prohibited {{the introduction of the}} same bill twice during the same session, the ministry advised the new king, William IV, to prorogue Parliament. As soon as the new session began in December 1831, the Third Reform Bill was brought forward. The bill was in a few respects different from its predecessors; it no longer proposed a reduction in the total membership of the House of Commons, and it reflected data collected during the census <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> been completed. The new version passed in the House of Commons by even larger majorities in March 1832; it was once again sent up to the House of Lords.|$|E

5|$|For his {{achievements}} on 28February, the RAF's most successful {{day of the}} campaign, Cullen was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC). Italian sources recorded that a Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 was only damaged on 28February, not shot down, and that the Breda 20s claimed by the RAF were in fact Fiat BR.20s. Cullen claimed another multiple kill on 3March, when he {{and one of his}} comrades chased a group of CANT Z.1007bis <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> bombed Larissa, Greece. Catching the retreating bombers south-west of Corfu, No.80 Squadron claimed six destroyed and one probable. Cullen was credited with destroying four CANTs and probably destroying another, though the Italians reported that only two CANT bombers were lost.|$|E
5|$|However, the Japanese retreated beyond Port Arthur's gunfire support range, and {{had been}} {{reinforced}} by main forces of six battleships. At 0850, Makarov turned around {{to head back to}} the harbor and join with three other battleships <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> left. After the squadron had united and turned back towards the enemy, about two miles from the shore, on 9.42 Petropavlosk detonated a Japanese-laid mine on her port side. Petropavlovsk sank, taking 27 officers and 652 men, including Admiral Makarov and war artist Vasily Vereshchagin with her. A monument was constructed in Saint Petersburg in 1913 to honor Stephan Makarov after Japanese divers identified his remains inside the wreck of Petropavlovsk and gave him a burial at sea.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, Gallaher's Ponsonby club {{won eight}} of their nine matches {{en route to}} the Auckland club championship. He was {{selected}} to play for Auckland against the New Zealand representative side <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> completed a tour of Australia. The Aucklanders won 11–10 after scoring a late try; it was only New Zealand's second loss of their eleven-match tour. Later that year Gallaher was selected for Auckland's three-match tour where they defeated Taranaki, Wellington and Wanganui. Wellington's defeat was their first loss at home since the formation of the Wellington Rugby Football Union in 1879. The following season was less eventful for Gallaherhe played much of the season for Ponsonby, but injury prevented his selection for Auckland.|$|E
50|$|The {{decision}} of a juvenile garter snake {{to attack a}} predator can be affected by whether the snake <b>has</b> <b>just</b> eaten or not. Snakes <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> eaten {{are more likely to}} strike a predator or stimuli than snakes <b>that</b> do not <b>have</b> a full stomach. Snakes are more likely to flee a threatening situation if their stomachs are empty. Snakes <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>just</b> eaten a large animal are less mobile. Feeding positively affects endurance as opposed to speed.|$|R

5|$|In early 1971, Deacon was {{introduced}} to Taylor and May by a friend at a disco who told him {{that they were in}} a band <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> lost its bassist. A couple of days later he auditioned in a lecture room at Imperial College London and became the last member of Queen to join. Since the band's last bassist drew attention away from Mercury, Deacon was selected for his musical talent, his quiet demeanour and his electrical skills. A persistent legend claims Deacon was the seventh bassist auditioned, but more recent sources show Queen's bassists were, in order: Mike Grose, Barry Mitchell, Doug Bogie and Deacon. Deacon played his first show with Queen at the College of Estate Management in Kensington in June.|$|E
5|$|In late June 1944, {{during a}} {{strafing}} {{attack on a}} railway yard in the Po Valley in northern Italy, Smith was shot down by anti-aircraft fire. Parachuting from his aircraft, he landed without serious injury in the Ligurian Alps, {{in an area that}} was behind German lines, but largely under the control of anti-German Italian partisans. Smith spent three months working with the local resistance movement before trekking westwards, across the Maritime Alps, with three other Allied personnel, hoping to join up with the Allied forces <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> invaded southern France. After 23 days' hiking, he and his companions were recovered by American troops and repatriated.|$|E

5|$|The German High Command fully {{expected}} Italy to surrender and, in preparation, had secretly established a new Army group headquarters commanded by Generalfeldmarschall Erwin Rommel at Munich. Rommel would have six divisions {{transferred from the}} Eastern Front, two divisions from France <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> been reformed, and two parachute divisions based in Germany in his new command. However, a Russian offensive in the east prevented the release of all the units promised. Adolf Hitler {{came to the conclusion}} that, without the backing of the Italian Army, it would be impossible for the Germans to defend the whole of Italy.|$|E
5|$|The Road World Championships {{took place}} in Cancellara's native country Switzerland and he stated that he wished to win both events. Cancellara {{dominated}} the time trial event and won {{by a margin of}} close {{a minute and a half}} over the second-place finisher. This was Cancellara's third world championship in the time trial discipline, which was tied for most ever with Australia's Michael Rogers. Cancellara's next goal was the road race, which was to take place three days later. During the final lap of the race, Cancellara crossed the gap to the race's leading group <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> formed. At the bottom of the final climb Cadel Evans (Australia) attacked, but no other riders reacted. Cancellara crossed the line in fifth.|$|E
5|$|The Royal Navy had {{conducted}} {{trials in}} 1913 with a modified cruiser, , {{to evaluate the}} ability of seaplanes {{to work with the}} fleet. They were successful enough that the Admiralty allocated £81,000 in the 1914–1915 Naval Programme to purchase a merchant ship for a more thorough modification than had been possible with Hermes to better accommodate seaplanes. A tramp steamer was purchased in 1914 <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> begun construction at the Blyth Shipbuilding Company so it could be easily modified to suit its new role.|$|E

5|$|When the {{competition}} was revived in the 1990s, {{for the first two}} seasons all English sides playing in the First Division (2nd level) participated, but in the last two tournaments only 8 English teams played. In 1994/95, two of the clubs relegated from the Premiership were joined by six teams <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> missed out on promotion. For 1995/96, only one relegated Premiership team competed – most of the remaining teams had finished in mid-table or lower table in the previous First Division campaign, and Birmingham City had just been promoted from Division Two.|$|E
5|$|Amid strong resistance, the Australians {{were made}} to fight {{their way through the}} maze of bunkers, punji stakes and booby traps but they were {{eventually}} able to force a Viet Cong regional force company to withdraw as they continued their advance. The area was heavily seeded with trip wires connected to shells and grenades dangling from branches, one of which blew McFarlane and several of his men off their feet. The defenders subsequently withdrew, with 7th Cu Chi Battalion forced north and 3rd Quyet Thang Battalion to the east. Suspecting they were being drawn into a trap—as one of the American battalions of the brigade had been previously during Operation Hump—the Australians moved into a tightly defended perimeter before dark and waited for the communists to counter-attack. As night fell, movement was detected along a trench on the C Company perimeter when a squad of Viet Cong attempted to infiltrate the Australian position. Initially believing the movement to be another Australian patrol <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> departed on a clearing patrol, the machine-gunner on sentry duty finally opened fire at the last safe moment, killing one of the infiltrators at point-blank range and wounding a number of others before they withdrew.|$|E
5|$|England had Stanley Matthews available, who {{was widely}} {{considered}} one of {{the best players in the}} world at the time, but he had not played with the English team in the three international matches before the World Cup (in fact, he had joined the team late, having been touring Canada as part of another group of English internationals). As such, the selection committee (consisting entirely of Arthur Drewry, then president of The Football League in England and later the president of FIFA) opted to stay with the team <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> defeated Chile. Matthews would be saved for later, supposedly more difficult, opponents. As there were no substitutes allowed in those days, Matthews watched the game with the other reserves. Incidentally, the England team which toured Canada beat the United States team preparing for the World Cup 1–0 at the Triborough Stadium in New York City on June 19, 10 days before the World Cup match, courtesy of a Johnny Hancocks goal.|$|E
