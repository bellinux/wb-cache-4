The manager of learning value allows the youth to learn and practice his skills in situations simulating real life. The Manager of Learning methodology first exposes <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> to a situation to help both <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> and the leader assess his current state of knowledge. This causes <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> to internalize a need to improve his knowledge or skills. This is followed by a period of teaching or exposure during which the participant improves from their base-line knowledge. The participant then gets a chance to apply what he has learned, and lastly, evaluates his performance improvement.|$|E

5|$|Acquisition {{of second}} and {{additional}} languages can come at any age, through exposure {{in daily life}} or courses. Children learning a second language {{are more likely to}} achieve native-like fluency than adults, but in general, it is very rare for someone speaking a second language to pass completely for a native speaker. An important difference between first language acquisition and additional language acquisition is that the process of additional language acquisition is influenced by languages that <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> already knows.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{adaptive}} {{educational systems}} include several solutions for providing personalized {{access to the}} learning process. <b>The</b> <b>learner's</b> profile constitutes <b>the</b> key element of these solutions. Therefore, an educational system represents <b>the</b> <b>learner's</b> profile by its own syntax, semantic and structure. Each system can have incomplete or partial learner's data. As a consequence, {{there is a strong}} need to exchange <b>the</b> <b>learner's</b> profiles between different systems to enhance and enrich <b>the</b> <b>learner's</b> knowledge. However, <b>the</b> data exchange between <b>the</b> <b>learner's</b> profiles implies interoperability problems. In our work, we are interested in <b>the</b> evolving <b>learner's</b> profiles interoperability problem. In this context, we propose an architecture allowing the data exchange of <b>the</b> <b>learner's</b> profile in educational cross-systems in order to improve the adaptation navigation. This architecture is automatically adapted to <b>the</b> <b>learner's</b> profiles that evolve over time. These latter are syntactically, semantically and structurally heterogeneous. The evaluation values show the effectiveness of our approach...|$|R

5|$|Southern Min dialects undergo {{considerable}} tone sandhi, i.e. {{changes to}} the tone depending on {{the position of the}} syllable in any given sentence or utterance. However, like pinyin for Mandarin Chinese, POJ always marks the citation tone (i.e. the original, pre-sandhi tone) rather than the tone which is actually spoken. This means that when reading aloud the reader must adjust the tone markings on the page to account for sandhi. Some textbooks for learners of Southern Min mark both the citation tone and the sandhi tone to assist <b>the</b> <b>learner.</b>|$|E
25|$|To fully engage and {{challenge}} <b>the</b> <b>learner,</b> {{the task and}} learning environment should reflect {{the complexity of the}} environment that <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> should be able to function in at the end of learning. Learners must not only have ownership of the learning or problem-solving process, but of the problem itself (Derry 1999).|$|E
25|$|In one incarnation, {{the machine}} was a box that housed a list of {{questions}} that could be viewed one at a time through a small window. (See picture). There was also a mechanism through which <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> could respond to each question. Upon delivering a correct answer, <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> would be rewarded.|$|E
30|$|In {{addition}} to these learning activities, after finishing each level, the game presents an exercise which aims to refresh the mind of <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> about <b>the</b> learnt information. This exercise is a question with multiple choices. <b>The</b> <b>learners</b> can submit their answers by touching the correct one. An immediate feedback will be displayed based on <b>the</b> <b>learner’s</b> choice.|$|R

25|$|Furthermore, it {{is argued}} that the {{responsibility}} of learning should reside increasingly with <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> (Glasersfeld, 1989). Social constructivism thus emphasizes the importance of <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> being actively involved in the learning process, unlike previous educational viewpoints where the responsibility rested with the instructor to teach and where <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> played a passive, receptive role. Von Glasersfeld (1989) emphasized that learners construct their own understanding and that they do not simply mirror and reflect what they read. Learners look for meaning and will try to find regularity and order in the events of the world {{even in the absence of}} full or complete information.|$|E
25|$|According to {{the social}} constructivist approach, {{instructors}} have {{to adapt to the}} role of facilitators and not teachers (Bauersfeld, 1995). Whereas a teacher gives a didactic lecture that covers the subject matter, a facilitator helps <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> to get to his or her own understanding of the content. In the former scenario <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> plays a passive role and in the latter scenario <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> plays {{an active role in the}} learning process. The emphasis thus turns away from the instructor and the content, and towards <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> (Gamoran, Secada, & Marrett, 1998). This dramatic change of role implies that a facilitator needs to display a totally different set of skills than that of a teacher (Brownstein 2001). A teacher tells, a facilitator asks; a teacher lectures from the front, a facilitator supports from the back; a teacher gives answers according to a set curriculum, a facilitator provides guidelines and creates the environment for <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> to arrive at his or her own conclusions; a teacher mostly gives a monologue, a facilitator is in continuous dialogue with the learners (Rhodes and Bellamy, 1999). A facilitator should also be able to adapt the learning experience 'in mid-air' by taking the initiative to steer the learning experience to where the learners want to create value.|$|E
30|$|Learner {{modelling}} {{can also}} be achieved implicitly. This is done by recording actions of <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> while they are using educational games (Action Modelling) (Hou 2012; Serrano-Laguna et al. 2012; Lessard 2012; Moreno-Ger et al. 2009). The set of actions made by <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> during <b>the</b> game play can be interpreted and translated into descriptive information useful for modeling <b>the</b> <b>learners.</b>|$|R
30|$|For example, Moreno-Ger et al. (2007) {{evaluated}} <b>the</b> <b>learner’s</b> {{level of}} knowledge as part of learner modelling through a questionnaire and some basic tests to capture <b>the</b> <b>learner’s</b> initial {{level of knowledge}}. <b>The</b> <b>learners</b> were then provided with an educational game, which also included an in-game exam. The results of that exam were used to grade <b>the</b> <b>learners.</b> Finally, <b>the</b> final in-game exam {{was used to assess}} the learners’ proficiency. In another example (Huang 2011), after completing <b>the</b> educational game, <b>learners</b> were asked to self-report the mental effort investment level and the difficulty level associated with the learning task on a 9 -point Likert scale.|$|R
30|$|The teacher {{inquires}} of <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> why collisions {{occur and}} how the searching process changes. Then, the teacher requests <b>the</b> <b>learners</b> to find <b>the</b> dataset and search keys that trigger collisions.|$|R
25|$|The {{learning}} environment {{should also be}} designed to support and challenge the learner's thinking (Di Vesta, 1987). While it is advocated to give <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> ownership {{of the problem and}} solution process, it is not the case that any activity or any solution is adequate. The critical goal is to support <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> in becoming an effective thinker. This can be achieved by assuming multiple roles, such as consultant and coach.|$|E
25|$|At this point, {{many people}} {{indicated}} {{their desire to}} stop the experiment and check on <b>the</b> <b>learner.</b> Some test subjects paused at 135 volts and began to question {{the purpose of the}} experiment. Most continued after being assured {{that they would not be}} held responsible. A few subjects began to laugh nervously or exhibit other signs of extreme stress once they heard the screams of pain coming from <b>the</b> <b>learner.</b>|$|E
25|$|Social constructivisms or socioculturalism {{encourage}} <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> or {{learners to}} arrive {{at his or her}} version of the truth, influenced by his or her background, culture or embedded worldview. Historical developments and symbol systems, such as language, logic, and mathematical systems, are inherited by <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> {{as a member of a}} particular culture and these are learned throughout the learner's life. This also stresses the importance of the nature of the learner's social interaction with knowledgeable members of the society. Without the social interaction with other more knowledgeable people, it is impossible to acquire social meaning of important symbol systems and learn how to utilize them. Young children develop their thinking abilities by interacting with other children, adults and the physical world. From the social constructivist viewpoint, it is thus important to take into account the background and culture of <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> throughout the learning process, as this background also helps to shape the knowledge and truth that <b>the</b> <b>learner</b> creates, discovers and attains in the learning process (Wertsch 1997).|$|E
