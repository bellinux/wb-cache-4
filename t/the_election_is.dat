5|$|Cardinal Rodrigo Borja {{was elected}} {{unanimously}} on the 4th ballot as Pope Alexander VI. <b>The</b> <b>election</b> <b>is</b> notorious for allegations that Borja bought {{the votes of}} his electors, promising them lucrative appointments and other material gifts—a practice known as simony. Concerns about this conclave led Pope Julius II to create stronger rules against simony in 1503.|$|E
5|$|Depending {{on whether}} the judge has {{determined}} that the election was valid or void, the election return is confirmed or altered.

5|$|The {{court was}} unwilling to extend the {{traditional}} defence of qualified privilege as it was {{of the opinion that}} Parliament's intention in enacting section 14 was clear: it is wholly untenable that the speech made at an election rally is privileged when the same speech published by or on behalf of a candidate for <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>is</b> not.|$|E
5|$|If <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>is</b> a non-reserved election, and {{the person}} applied for a {{community}} certificate, the certificate issued to him or the Community Committee's written rejection of the application. If the person submitted a community declaration that did not include an application for a community certificate, {{he or she must}} submit the Community Committee's written acceptance of the declaration and a statutory declaration that he or she does not consider himself or herself a member of the Chinese community, Malay community, or Indian or other minority communities.|$|E
5|$|Secondly, when {{candidates}} wish {{to publish}} election advertising on the Internet {{during the campaign}} period – that is, the period from {{the closure of the}} place of nomination on nomination day after <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>is</b> adjourned to enable a poll to be taken, {{to the start of the}} eve of polling day – they must provide to the returning officer, within 12 hours after the start of the period, declarations containing information on all the online platforms the advertising has appeared on in that time. Subsequently, a similar declaration must be provided before election advertising is published on such platforms.|$|E
50|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>were</b> {{not held}} before the {{designated}} date {{due to the}} War of Independence, and were actually cancelled twice. <b>The</b> <b>elections</b> <b>were</b> eventually held on 25 January 1949.|$|R

5|$|The 435 {{members of}} the House of Representatives elect a Speaker by {{majority}} rule {{at the beginning of}} each session of the United States Congress, who serves until the end of the Congress. Typically, <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>is</b> a formality, as the majority party's members vote as a bloc for their party's previously-chosen Speaker-designate (such as the speaker, majority leader, or minority leader from the previous term). Open elections are uncommon but have occurred. The last Speaker election to require multiple ballots occurred in 1923.|$|E
5|$|The {{mayor is}} elected in citywide election. Elections follow a two-round system. The {{first round of}} <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>is</b> called the primary election. The top-two {{candidates}} from the primary election advance to a runoff election, called the general election. Write-in candidates are only allowed to contest the primary election and are not allowed in the general election. The mayor is elected to a four-year term, with a limit of two consecutive terms. The mayor is officially non-partisan by state law, although most mayoral candidates identify a party preference.|$|E
5|$|Elaine and Guybrush {{return to}} Mêlée Island in Escape from Monkey Island from their lengthy honeymoon {{to find that}} she has been {{declared}} legally dead; as a result the governorship of the Tri-Island Area is up for election.

Guybrush leaves to prevent the Ultimate Insult, a powerful voodoo talisman, from falling into the hands of LeChuck's co-conspirator Ozzie Mandrill. Elaine is defeated in the election and LeChuck becomes governor, while Guybrush is captured and marooned on Monkey Island. On Monkey Island, Guybrush discovers that resident castaway Herman Toothrot is actually Horatio Marley, Elaine's long thought dead grandfather.

5|$|The Community Committee may {{reject a}} {{community}} declaration {{on the ground}} that, among other things, the declarant did not apply for a COE. During a reserved election, a declaration must also be rejected if the declarant does not state {{that he or she}} considers himself or herself {{to be a member of}} the community to which <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>is</b> reserved. In the 2017 election which was reserved to the Malay community, the Community Committee rejected two declarations, one from a declarant who stated he belonged to the Chinese community, and one from a declarant who said he was not a member of either the Chinese community, Malay community, or Indian or other minority communities. During a non-reserved election, potential candidates who state that they do not consider themselves to be members of the Chinese community, Malay community, or Indian or other minority communities may be given an opportunity by the Community Committee or a Sub-Committee to submit another community declaration.|$|E
5|$|The {{applicant}} for {{an election}} {{to be avoided}} may ask for a declaration that <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>is</b> void, that a particular candidate was wrongfully declared to have been elected, and/or that another candidate was duly elected. The applicant may also request for a scrutiny– that is, a re-examination of the ballot papers– {{if he or she}} alleges that an unsuccessful candidate had a majority of lawful votes. When a scrutiny is conducted, the election judge may order a vote to be struck off if the voter was not on the register of electors assigned to the polling station at which the vote was recorded or was not authorized to vote at the station; if the vote was obtained by bribery, treating or undue influence; if the voter committed or induced someone to commit the offence of personation; and if the vote was for a disqualified candidate and the disqualification was either a matter that the voter was aware of or was sufficiently publicized or widely known. During a scrutiny, a tendered vote that is shown to be valid will be added to the poll if any party to the proceedings asks for the vote to be added. On the other hand, a registered elector's vote will not be struck off at a scrutiny just because he or she was not qualified to be on the electoral register, and the returning officer's decision {{as to whether or not}} a ballot paper should be rejected may not be questioned.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} judge certifies {{his or her}} decision, {{which is}} final, to the Prime Minister. The judge must also report to the Prime Minister whether any corrupt or illegal practice was established to have been committed by or with the knowledge and consent of any candidate or his or her agent. If a judge intends to report {{a person who was}} neither a party to the proceedings nor a candidate claiming he or she should have been declared elected, that person must be given an opportunity to be heard and to give and call evidence to show why a report should not be made against him. However, where a candidate's agents are found to have been guilty of treating, undue influence or an illegal practice, but the candidate proves that the offences were committed contrary to his or her orders and without his or her sanction or connivance, or that of his or her election agents, that all reasonable means were taken to prevent corrupt and illegal practices at the election, that the offences were of a trivial and limited nature, and in other respects the election was free from corrupt or illegal practice, <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>is</b> not void.|$|E
50|$|John Patten (A) was {{initially}} declared the winner, but <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>was</b> challenged by Henry Latimer. The results of <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>were</b> subsequently reversed and Henry Latimer (P) took Delaware's {{seat in the}} Third Congress.|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>election</b> <b>is</b> {{carried out}} by a secret ballot. The ballot papers used are not numbered, but marked with the same pen and ink, and are {{inserted}} into a ballot box. Only the Rulers participate in the election.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>election</b> <b>is</b> {{proportional}} representation {{by means of}} a single transferable vote by secret ballot. Voters stack-rank the candidates, assigning 1 to their first preference, 2 to their second preference, and so on. The number of votes required by a candidate to secure <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>is</b> calculated by dividing the total number of votes by two, and adding one to the quotient by disregarding any remainder. If no candidate obtains the required number of first-preference votes, the candidate with the least number of first-preference votes is eliminated and his/her second-preference votes are transferred. The process is repeated until a candidate obtains the requisite number of votes. Nominated members can also participate in the election.|$|E
50|$|The {{result was}} widely expected; {{although}} <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>was</b> nominally contested by nine candidates, all opposition candidates were {{appointed by the}} government and <b>the</b> <b>elections</b> <b>were</b> regarded internationally as not being a free and fair contest.|$|R

25|$|Calling a Constitutional Convention {{is one of}} {{the ways}} to amend or revise the {{constitution}} of the Philippines. While voting is expected to be via the existing legislative districts, Congress decides on how many delegates would be elected, thus how many delegates would be distributed per district. <b>The</b> <b>election</b> <b>is</b> nonpartisan.|$|E
25|$|Congressmen, {{in early}} Congresses, were often elected after the legal {{start of the}} Congress.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>election</b> <b>was</b> not {{recognised}} internationally {{and so the}} Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) did {{not send}} any election monitors. However about a hundred non-governmental observers did come to monitor <b>the</b> <b>election,</b> along {{with a group of}} deputies from the Russian State Duma. <b>The</b> <b>election</b> <b>was</b> regarded as illegitimate by Azerbaijan and their ally Turkey. Azerbaijan said that <b>the</b> <b>election</b> <b>was</b> illegal until Azerbijanis were allowed to return and that it would undermine their OSCE talks with Armenia over the area. President Ghukasyan, though, said that <b>the</b> <b>election</b> would boost <b>the</b> international recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh and promised that <b>the</b> <b>election</b> would <b>be</b> honest and transparent.|$|R
