5|$|The player {{controls}} paddles {{along the}} screen's edges to knock a bouncing ball, Kirby, into destructible bricks. The player loses a life if Kirby hits {{the edge of}} the screen. Each of the game's eleven stages include five rounds of increasingly complex block patterns for Kirby to clear. The ten different block types vary in durability and points value. A well-timed hit of the paddle gives Kirby a powerful bounce to break through harder blocks. Another block type turns the remaining blocks into a bonus round <b>that</b> <b>rewards</b> the player for clearing the screen in the least amount of time. The player can find warp stars that lead to minigames, such as air hockey, where the player can earn extra lives. The rounds also include enemies to attack and avoid. Some enemies contain bonus items. Each stage ends in a boss fight.|$|E

Imitation and reinforcement play {{important roles in}} these theories, which state that individuals learn by duplicating behaviours they observe in others and <b>that</b> <b>rewards</b> are essential to ensuring the repetition of desirable behaviour. As each simple behaviour is established through imitation and subsequent reinforcement, the complex behaviour develops. When verbal behaviour is established the organism can learn through rule-governed behaviour and thus not all action needs to be contingency shaped.|$|E

25|$|The core {{gameplay}} remains {{similar to}} its predecessor, albeit with minor adjustments to returning game mechanics. Injustice 2 introduces a new feature called the Gear System, a loot-dropping system <b>that</b> <b>rewards</b> players with costume pieces and equipment {{that can be}} used to customize characters' appearances and modify their abilities and stats. According to developers, the idea for implementing an RPG-style progression system into a fighting game had existed since before the fall of Midway Games, the original publisher for the Mortal Kombat series. Director Ed Boon also sought to incorporate gameplay mechanics used by multiplayer shooter games, such as personalization, character creation, loot, and leveling up, into the fighting game genre, which led to the development of the Gear System.|$|E

The character's Facebook page also serves as the game's main menu, containing the inventory and a quest journal. The Stick of Truth features several mini-games, including defecating by repeatedly tapping a button <b>that</b> <b>rewards</b> the player with feces that can be thrown at enemies to trigger the [...] "grossed out" [...] effect, performing an abortion, and using an anal probe.

He started the Rene Bourque Hockey Fund with the goal of providing hockey equipment to underprivileged kids, and has appeared as a spokesman for Native Americans in sport at youth symposiums. His fund led to the donation of 50 sets of equipment to underprivileged children in Northern Alberta during the 2008–09 season, and over 100 sets in 2010–11.

500|$|The album {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Review aggregation website Metacritic awarded it an average score of 58 out of 100, based on eight reviews. Writing for The A.V. Club, Chris Mincher rated the album B−, calling it [...] "challenging, uncompromising, and bordering on inaccessible". Mincher {{felt that the}} album was abstract and difficult but contained [...] "hidden payoffs" [...] to reward repeated hearings. He called Patton's arrangements [...] "haunting" [...] and [...] "wraithlike". AllRovi's Thom Jurek rated the album 3.5 stars out of 5, describing the recording as [...] "a very nearly dazzling endeavor <b>that</b> <b>rewards</b> patience mightily". Jurek felt that, as an album, Laborintus II was difficult to grasp at first, {{by virtue of being}} a recording of theatrical music, but he praised the performance of Ictus Ensemble, writing of their [...] "bracing freshness and mischievous glee". Eli Kleman of Sputnikmusic rated it 3.5 out of 5, finding it [...] "fascinating if not unwieldy". He felt that Laborintus II was perhaps Patton's most ambitious album to date, but noted that the musician has previously produced similarly avant-garde records in the past. Kleman described the composition as [...] "somber, beautiful, and ominous, but always affecting".|$|E

40|$|Past {{studies have}} shown <b>that</b> <b>reward</b> {{contingency}} is critical for sensorimotor learning, and reward expectation speeds up saccades in animals. Whether monetary reward speeds up saccades in human remains unknown. Here we addressed this issue by employing a conditional saccade task, in which human subjects performed a series of non-reflexive, visually-guided horizontal saccades. The subjects were (or were not) financially compensated for making a saccade {{in response to a}} centrally-displayed visual congruent (or incongruent) stimulus. Reward modulation of saccadic velocities was quantified independently of the amplitude-velocity coupling. We found <b>that</b> <b>reward</b> expectation significantly sped up voluntary saccades up to 30 ◦/s, and the reward modulation was consistent across tests. These findings suggest <b>that</b> monetary <b>reward</b> speeds up saccades in human in a fashion analogous to how juice reward sped up saccades in monkeys. We further noticed that the idiosyncratic nasal-temporal velocity asymmetry was highly consistent regardless of test order, and its magnitude was not correlated with the magnitude of reward modulation. This suggests <b>that</b> <b>reward</b> modulation and the intrinsic velocity asymmetry may be governed by separate mechanisms that regulate saccade generation...|$|R
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} by {{television}} critics were positive, with Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club calling it [...] "an episode of Family Guy <b>that</b> <b>rewards</b> every viewer who liked the show in the past." [...] McFarland also gave high praise to the episode, writing, [...] "At first, I was simply pleased that 'Back to the Pilot' didn't screw things up at the beginning, but as the episode went, I kept looking at the clock and being amazed that it hadn't dropped the ball yet. It used short cutaways and a plethora of self-referential jokes the writers must have stockpiled for years about the animation quality, voice quality, {{and structure of the}} pilot to every possible advantage." [...] He continued, [...] "It wasn't perfect {{by any stretch of the}} imagination, and it's not on the same level as the occasional brilliance that South Park reaches on about one occasion per season nowadays, but it's the most fun I've had watching the show that didn't involve a Star Wars parody in many years." [...] McFarland concluded his review by giving the episode a grade of A-. Kate Moon of TV Fanatic also enjoyed the episode, noting, [...] "'Back to the Pilot' was a great meta episode of Family Guy. From poking fun at its own flaws in the original series to acknowledging how silly the cutaway gags can be, Family Guy shone at its layered best tonight." [...] She continued, [...] "Treating its animated characters like real actors was a nice touch as well. [...] Watching the original family showed how much the characters evolved and changed throughout the series' long run." [...] Moon concluded her review by giving the episode a 4.2 out of 5. Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number two on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and described the episode as [...] "pure genius". He added, [...] "Not only was the episode hilarious with amazing Brian and Stewie moments, but it was genuinely quite clever in the time-travel stakes, which is impressive on a nerd level." ...|$|E
