5|$|The Perfect Storm {{originated}} from a cold front that exited {{the east coast}} of the United States. On October 28, the front spawned an extratropical low to the east of Nova Scotia. Around that time, a ridge extended from the Appalachian Mountains northeastward to Greenland, with a strong high pressure center over eastern Canada. The blocking ridge forced the extratropical low to track toward the southeast and later to the west. Hurricane Grace was swept aloft by its cold front into the warm conveyor belt circulation of the deep cyclone on October 29. The cyclone significantly strengthened {{as a result of the}} temperature contrast between the cold air to the northwest and <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>and</b> humidity from the remnants of Hurricane Grace. The low pressure system continued deepening as it drifted toward the United States. It had an unusual retrograde motion for a nor'easter, beginning a set of meteorological circumstances that occur only once every 50 to 100 years. Most nor'easters affect New England from the southwest.|$|E

After he becomes an apprentice to the arch ("ExtraOrdinary") wizard of the series, Marcia Overstrand, he must study for seven years and a day until his apprenticeship ends. In the first book, he is known as Young Army Expendable Boy 412, until his great-aunt, Zelda Zanuba Heap reveals his true identity. His adventures are placed {{in the context of}} <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>and</b> strength of his family, and developed alongside those of Jenna, his adoptive sister, who is heir to the throne of the Castle, the community where they live. The novels, set in an elaborate fantastic world, describe the many challenges that Septimus and his friends must overcome.|$|E

Project based, the Foundation seeks to help where the need is – they have renovated kitchens, gardens, and living areas in women's refuges, provided sleeper beds to hospitals to allow families to stay together through treatment and countless other ways {{to make a difference in}} some of Australia's most vulnerable lives.|$|E

500|$|John Hartl of MSNBC gave Spider-Man 3 a {{positive}} review, but {{stated that it}} has some flaws such as having [...] "too many storylines". His opinion is echoed by Houston Chronicle's Amy Biancolli who complained that [...] "the script is busy with so many supporting characters and plot detours that the series' charming idiosyncrasy is sometimes lost in the noise." [...] Jack Matthews of Daily News thought the film was too devoted to the [...] "quiet conversations" [...] of Peter and Mary Jane, but that fans would not be disappointed by the action. Finally, Sean Burns of Philadelphia Weekly felt that the director [...] "substituted scope and scale for <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>and</b> wit that made those two previous pictures so memorable."

Instead Cyan developed a device mounted to the actors' faces that captured video of the actors while they spoke their lines. The video was then manipulated and used as a facial texture that was mapped onto the 3D characters, and the facial movement was also tracked and used to animate the faces of the characters in-game. Motion capture of the body was also used to ensure lifelike movement. Cyan staff were worried that the audio synching for animation would not be finished in time for the E3 unveiling of the game, but were happy with the end results. Critical reaction to game previews and impressions at E3 was highly positive. Miller was relieved, stating that when the mostly shooter game-dominated showcase declared that End of Ages might be the best game in the series, [...] "That feels good".|$|E

500|$|Formby's {{final year}} of work was 1960. That May he {{recorded}} his last session of songs, [...] "Happy Go Lucky Me" [...] and [...] "Banjo Boy", the former of which peaked at number 40 in the UK Singles Chart. He then spent the summer season at the Queen's Theatre in Blackpool in The Time of Your Life—a performance which was also broadcast by the BBC. One of the acts in the show was the singer Yana, with whom Formby had an affair, made easier because of Beryl's absence from the theatre through illness. His final televised performance, a 35-minute BBC programme, The Friday Show: George Formby, was aired on 16 December. Bret considers the programme to be Formby's [...] "greatest performance—it was certainly his most sincere", although reviewing for The Guardian, Mary Crozier thought it [...] "too slow". She {{went on to say}} [...] "George Formby is really a music-hall star, and it needs <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>and</b> sociability of the theatre to bring out his full appeal". Beryl's illness was worsening. Worn down by the strain, and feeling the need to escape, Formby took the part of Mr Wu in Aladdin in Bristol, having turned down a more lucrative part in Blackpool.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} {{to be released}} in summer 1977, but was pushed back to November because of the various problems during production. Upon its release, Close Encounters had a huge impact on society and became a certified box office success, grossing $116.39million in North America and $171.7million in foreign countries, totaling $288million. It became Columbia Pictures' most successful film at that time. Jonathan Rosenbaum refers to the film as [...] "the best expression of Spielberg's benign, dreamy-eyed vision." [...] A.D. Murphy of Variety gave a positive review but felt [...] "Close Encounters lacks <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>and</b> humanity of George Lucas's Star Wars". Murphy found most of the film slow-paced, but praised the film's climax. Pauline Kael called it [...] "a kid's film in the best sense." [...] Jean Renoir compared Spielberg's storytelling to Jules Verne and Georges Méliès. Ray Bradbury declared it the greatest science fiction film ever made. Based on 46 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, 96% ("Certified Fresh") of the reviewers have enjoyed the film and the site's consensus states [...] "Close Encounters most iconic bits (the theme, the mashed-potato sculpture, etc.) have been so thoroughly absorbed into the culture that it's easy to forget that its treatment of aliens as peaceful beings rather than warmongering monsters was somewhat groundbreaking in 1977." ...|$|E
500|$|Junos opening title sequence, {{depicting}} a rotoscoped Juno walking through her town while drinking {{a bottle of}} SunnyD orange drink, was put together over 7–8 months by a small design studio, Shadowplay Studio, based in Los Angeles. Reitman had met the studio's co-founder Gareth Smith in Japan on the short film festival circuit where they each had shorts screening. Shadowplay created the opening title sequence for Reitman's previous film, Thank You for Smoking, and he contacted them again {{when he found out}} he was going to direct Juno. With vintage 1970s punk-rock posters as inspiration, Smith and artist Jenny Lee decided to create a sequence that [...] "had texture {{and a little bit of}} edge, but also imparted <b>the</b> <b>warmth</b> <b>and</b> heart of the screenplay". In the last days of filming in Vancouver, Ellen Page was photographed with a high speed camera from a number of angles walking on a treadmill and drinking SunnyD. 900 still images of a walking and drinking Page were printed out and repeatedly run through a Xerox machine to degrade their quality until the pictures appeared hand-drawn. The pictures were cut-out and scanned back onto the computer then layered onto the background drawn by Lee with compositing software to create a stop motion animation sequence that corresponded to [...] "All I Want Is You" [...] by Barry Louis Polisar, the song Reitman had chosen. Shadowplay also designed the titlecards for each of the seasons for the film, hand-made a custom typeface for the opening title sequence and the closing credits, and collaborated on the design of the soundtrack and the DVD.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the change in sugar, acids and pH levels other components of the grapes are building up during the ripening process. The mineral components of potassium, calcium, magnesium and sodium increase in concentration as they are disseminated among {{the skin of the}} grapes and its fleshy pulp.

Flavonoids and [...] volatile compounds known as [...] "flavor precursors" [...] which contribute to the eventual flavor and aroma of the wine also begin to build up in the skins and pulp. Additionally the concentration of tannins in the grape increases in several areas of the grape including the skin, seeds and stem.
