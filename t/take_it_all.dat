25|$|In 1967, Jackson {{was drafted}} {{in the second round}} by the New York Knicks. While he was a good {{all-around}} athlete, with unusually long arms, he was limited offensively and compensated with intelligence and hard work on defense. Jackson eventually established himself as a fan favorite and one of the NBA's leading substitutes, although he had very little playing time. He was a top reserve on the Knicks team that won the NBA title in 1973. Jackson did not play during New York's 1969–70 championship season due to spinal fusion surgery; however, he authored a book entitled <b>Take</b> <b>It</b> <b>All,</b> a photo diary of the Knicks' 1970 championship run.|$|E

[...] Both projects criticized political partisanship and sought to promote mutual learning and innovative policy syntheses across social and cultural divides. [...] In an interview, Satin contrasts the old radical slogan [...] "Dare to struggle, dare to win" [...] with his radical-middle version, [...] "Dare to synthesize, dare to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> in".|$|E
500|$|In a {{day where}} {{half of the}} week's top-10 teams were defeated, USC escaped {{becoming}} the sixth in a messy, mistake-prone 27–24 victory in a wet, windy game in Seattle. [...] Although USC had a 460–190 edge in total yards, their errors helped the Huskies significantly: They committed threeturnovers and 16penalties—their most in more than twoseasons—for 161yards, missed a field goal and had a punt blocked. [...] A disappointed Pete Carroll noted [...] "We just couldn't do more things wrong in the game [...] I thought Washington was there for it. They were there to <b>take</b> <b>it.</b> <b>All</b> they needed was onemore chance." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{match was}} a see-saw five setter with Nadal {{prevailing}} 9–7 {{in the fifth}} after 4 hours and 37 minutes. [...] Analyst Steve Tignor summed it up: [...] "This epic was {{a mirror image of}} their last one, in the 2012 Australian Open final. That day it had been Nadal who had survived a near-death experience in the fourth set, won it in a tiebreaker, and taken a 4–2 lead in the fifth before watching Djokovic storm back for the title. Today it was Nole who broke Rafa at 3–4 in the fourth and again at 5–6, grabbed that set in a tiebreaker, and led 4–2 in the fifth before watching Nadal <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> away. In each of those matches, the loser was haunted by a stunning, crucial lapse. In Australia, with a chance to go up 5–2 in the fifth, Nadal had missed the easiest of backhand passing shots. In Paris, serving at 4–3 in the final set, Djokovic gave away a point when he ran into the net after hitting what would have been a winning overhead." ...|$|E
500|$|Captain America: Civil War was {{the first}} film to use IMAX's digital 2D cameras, made in {{partnership}} with Arri, which was a customized version of the Arri Alexa 65. According to Joe Russo, approximately fifteen minutes of the film, the sequence where the two factions fight at Leipzig/Halle Airport, which was described as having [...] "incredible scale to it" [...] and referred to by the directors as the [...] "splash panel", were shot with the cameras. Opaloch noted that there were discussions late in pre-production to shoot the entire film with the Alexa 65 cameras. However, because of how close {{it was to the}} start of shooting as well as the idea being [...] "such a large-scale undertaking", it was decided to only use them for the airport sequence, with the rest of film being shot on Arri Alexa XT digital cameras. For the airport sequence, Opaloch rigged the Alexa 65s to a Technocrane, a Steadicam, a dolly as well as a drone for flyover shots, which had its own dedicated team operating it. Because of the amount of resolution the Aleax 65s offered, Opaloch chose to use medium close-ups instead of close-ups, and for his wide shots, hold the shot a bit longer, [...] "maybe with a slight camera move that allows the viewer to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> in." ...|$|E

500|$|On February 4, Fantasia {{released}} a lyric video for the song. Although a music video was filmed {{to promote the}} single, she was dissatisfied with the final product and refused to release it. A music video of an acoustic version of [...] "No Time for It" [...] premiered on Fantasia's Vevo on March 24; the following day, it was released on the iTunes Store. The black-and-white video features Fantasia in [...] "a short, black leather dress and backed by only a guitar and xylophone". Elle Breezy of Singersroom wrote, [...] "She doesn’t <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> the way there like we know she can, but it’s still a nice, subdued performance". A Rap-Up reviewer praised the version as [...] "a stirring acoustic rendition of her empowering song", and Fantasia [...] "breaks {{it all the way}} down" [...] in the video. B. Cakes of Soulbounce.com called the video personal and intimate, [...] "a candid woman-to-woman (or woman-to-man) talk with one of her detractors", and praised the acoustic remix as keeping the focus on its lyrics. The original version of [...] "No Time for It" [...] was included on the set list for the [...] tour, and Fantasia performed it as part of a medley with her 2005 single [...] "Free Yourself" [...] during a July 28, 2016 concert broadcast on BET, (the {{first in a series of}} live concerts on the cable channel).|$|E
500|$|Philip Day of The Sunday Times noted [...] "How wincingly well Mr Fleming writes", {{while the}} {{reviewer}} for The Times, thought that [...] "his is an ingenious affair, full of recondite knowledge and horrific spills and thrills – of slightly sadistic excitements also – though without the simple and bold design of its predecessor". Elizabeth L Sturch, writing in The Times Literary Supplement, observed that Fleming was [...] "without doubt {{the most interesting}} recent recruit among thriller-writers" [...] and that Live and Let Die [...] "fully maintains the promise of... Casino Royale." [...] Tempering her praise of the book, Sturch thought that [...] "Mr Fleming works often {{on the edge of}} flippancy, rather in the spirit of a highbrow", although overall she felt that the novel [...] "contains passages which for sheer excitement have not been surpassed by any modern writer of this kind". The reviewer for The Daily Telegraph felt that [...] "the book is continually exciting, whether it takes us into the heart of Harlem or describes an underwater swim in shark-infested waters; and it is more entertaining because Mr Fleming does not <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> too seriously himself". [...] George Malcolm Thompson, writing in The Evening Standard, believed Live and Let Die to be [...] "tense; ice-cold, sophisticated; Peter Cheyney for the carriage trade".|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73, based on 21 reviews, which indicates [...] "generally favorable reviews". Dan Martin of NME gave the record {{a very positive}} review, calling a [...] "defining statement" [...] with the band's [...] "most stylistically hatstand-but-indisputably-best songs yet." [...] He wrote, [...] "We're not saying it's as good as genre watermarks American Idiot or The Black Parade. We're just saying it comes close," [...] closing with calling it a [...] "staggering achievement." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic rated the album {{four out of five}} stars and compared it to labelmate Panic! at the Disco's effort earlier in the year, Pretty. Odd. He wrote that [...] "Fall Out Boy capture the Zeitgeist of {{the latter half of the}} 2000s better than any band: there's so much going on in Folie à Deux, you either choose to <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> seriously or take none of it. Fall Out Boy make as much sense when heard either way." [...] Scott Heisel wrote for Alternative Press, commending the band for its [...] "creativity, ingenuity and willingness to try just about anything." [...] He compared the meaning of the term folie à deux ("a madness shared by two") to the two very distinct feelings expressed in the different sides of the record, calling the album a good representation of the band's career.|$|E

500|$|In the 90-minute, one-act play, lawyer Amir Kapoor and {{his wife}} Emily host an Upper East Side dinner. Amir is an American-born, Muslim-raised Manhattan mergers and {{acquisitions}} lawyer, while Emily is an up-and-coming artist who focuses on Islamic themes in her art. Amir has cast aside his Muslim heritage {{for the sake of}} his career and serves as Emily's muse, who has an affinity for Islamic artistic traditions. Prior to the dinner, Amir, who is on the partner track, becomes involved in a controversial case. Amir's assimilated nephew, Abe (born Hussein Malik), has concerns regarding the propriety of the arrest of a local imam who is imprisoned on charges that may be trumped-up of financing terrorist-supporting groups, leading Amir to question whether it is religious persecution. Emily encourages the reluctant Amir to appear in court in support of the imam, in an unofficial capacity that gets mentioned in The New York Times. The case becomes dinner conversation when he hosts Jory, a colleague from work, and her husband, Isaac, who is Emily's Jewish art dealer. In all, the dinner table assembly includes an ex-Muslim, an African-American, a Jew and a WASP dining over the topic of religious faith. The conversation touches upon [...] "Islamic and Judaic tradition, the Quran and the Talmud, racial profiling and September 11 and the Taliban and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Benjamin Netanyahu" [...] as tensions mount. When Amir admits he felt a [...] "blush of pride" [...] on September 11th, and holds secret animosity toward Israel, his friends are disgusted. Jory and Amir leave the apartment to get a bottle of champagne. It is revealed that Isaac and Emily have had an affair in the past, and that he is secretly in love with her. Jory and Amir return just as Isaac is about to kiss Emily. It is revealed that Jory has been selected as partner in the law firm over Amir, in part because of his presence at the imam's trial, and in a rage he calls her [...] "nigger". Jory and Isaac depart, the status of their relationship uncertain after Isaac's infidelity has been revealed. Emily confesses her affair with Isaac and Amir beats her. Abe stumbles into the apartment and finds him standing over her. The play jumps ahead a period of time. Amir is packing his belongings and preparing to leave the apartment. Emily brings Abe over for legal advice. He was questioned by the FBI after his friend expressed a Jihadist sentiment at a Starbucks. Amir warns Abe to be more cautious, but Abe flies into a fit of rage, saying that the West has [...] "disgraced" [...] Islam, but that they will <b>take</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> back one day. He storms out. Amir tries to reconcile with Emily, but she leaves.|$|E
