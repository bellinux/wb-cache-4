5|$|Valene's {{bitterness}} {{over her}} mother's indifference, {{and the subsequent}} loss of Lucy is not resolved until 1979 when she and Gary move to Knots Landing. Much of this early backstory is told through flashbacks in episodes of Knots Landing, and is only briefly referenced in Dallas. While working in a diner in 1978, Valene decided to wait for Lucy outside her school and they {{got to know each}} other. They stayed in contact with each other in secret for several months afterward. In the fall of 1978, Lucy arranges a reunion for her parents. Gary and Valene move back to Southfork for a short time, but their reunion is again undermined by J.R., who arranged for Gary to take charge of a failing company, hoping that the pressure would drive Gary away. Gary realized that he would fall off the wagon unless he left Southfork, so he departed. J.R. then turned on Valene, trying to bribe her, before ordering her to leave. In December 1979, Valene and Gary are reunited once more in Dallas, and get married for the second time. Gary's parents, Jock Ewing (Jim Davis) and Miss Ellie Ewing (Barbara Bel Geddes), as well as Gary's brother, Bobby (Patrick Duffy), and sister-in-law Pamela Barnes Ewing (Victoria Principal), attend the wedding. Shortly afterward, they move to California to live in a home that Miss Ellie had bought for them as a wedding gift. Valene also appears in the final episode of Dallas during J.R.'s dream, which showed how <b>things</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> turned out had J.R. never existed. In this dream, Val meets Gary for the first time when they are both middle aged and they take a liking to each other, highlighting the idea that Gary and Val were always destined to end up together one way or another.|$|E
25|$|A {{performance}} of The17's SURROUND, originally {{planned to take}} place in Damascus, Syria, will take place in London on 18 March 2012. Drummond explains in his essay for Treuchet Magazine: 'it would best for all concerned if the Syrian leg of the tri-nation festival was postponed for a few weeks or maybe months, when <b>things</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> undoubtedly settled down'.|$|E
25|$|All {{evidence}} {{indicated that}} crew error {{was in no}} way responsible for the disintegration of the orbiter, and they had acted correctly and according to procedure at the first indication of trouble. Although some of the crew were not wearing gloves or helmets during reentry and some were not properly restrained in their seats, doing these <b>things</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> added nothing to their survival chances other than perhaps keeping them alive and conscious another 30 or so seconds.|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't trouble. I am not {{obliged to}} be out at all. I think I would rather you did not {{accompany}} me further. This sort of <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> an odd look if known." ...|$|R
60|$|The logger {{appeared}} to consider. It was characteristic {{of him and}} the stock he sprang from that he <b>would</b> never <b>have</b> {{admitted that he had}} borne with Nasmyth as long as possible out of kindness. The <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> hurt him.|$|R
25|$|Jason Lewry {{then took}} six Middlesex wickets for 65 runs, {{reducing}} them to 244, although {{if it had}} not been Jamie Dalrymple's (65) and Paul Weekes' (71) partnership of 140 for the sixth wicket, <b>things</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> looked even nastier for Middlesex. In reply, Sussex were cautious in their chase of 314, but a big partnership between Richard Montgomerie and Murray Goodwin nearly won it for them. However, New Zealand all-rounder Scott Styris took four Sussex wickets for 79, and Alan Richardson took four for 38 - including Goodwin and skipper Adams. Sussex lost four wickets for 17 runs to crash to 280 for 6, but Kirtley and Lewry held out as Sussex finished 28 runs short of a victory and Middlesex finished one wicket short of victory in this bottom-fight.|$|E
500|$|Ronald Munro Ferguson {{has been}} quoted in 1912 as saying [...] "many <b>things</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> gone {{otherwise}} had Lady Rosebery lived. Her loss is today {{as great a}} calamity from every point of view as {{it was at the}} time of her death." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked if}} {{religion}} {{plays a part}} in her life in 2009, Streep replied: [...] "I follow no doctrine. I don't belong to a church or a temple or a synagogue or an ashram." [...] In an interview in December 2008, she also alluded to her lack of religious belief when she said: [...] "So I've always been really, deeply interested, because I think I can understand the solace that's available in the whole construct of religion. But I really don't believe {{in the power of}} prayer, or <b>things</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been avoided that have happened, that are awful. So it's a horrible position as an intelligent, emotional, yearning human being to sit outside of the available comfort there. But I just can't go there." ...|$|E

6000|$|The skipper's laugh {{was very}} grim. [...] "It wouldn't have counted if they hadn't. One <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been certain--I was in command, and that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been quite {{enough to stop}} my getting another steamer. It's always {{somebody}} else's fault {{when you get a}} boat ashore." ...|$|R
60|$|John Meredith {{held the}} cup uncertainly. He {{did not know}} what to do with it. The logical <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been to toss it away, but somehow he was disinclined to do this. Rosemary held out her hand for it.|$|R
500|$|MacGregor left London {{shortly before}} the small party of Poyais {{survivors}} arrived home on 12 October 1823—he told Richardson that he was taking Josefa to winter in Italy {{for the sake of}} her health, but in fact his destination was Paris. The London press reported extensively on the Poyais scandal over the following weeks and months, stressing the colonists' travails and charging that MacGregor had orchestrated a massive fraud. Six of the survivors—including Hastie, who had lost two of his children during the ordeal—claimed that they were misquoted in these articles, and on 22 October signed an affidavit insisting that blame lay not with MacGregor but with Hall {{and other members of the}} emigrant party. [...] "e believe that Sir Gregor MacGregor has been worse used by Colonel Hall and his other agents than was ever a man before," [...] they declared, [...] "and that had they have done their duty by Sir Gregor and by us, <b>things</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> turned out very differently at Poyais". MacGregor asserted that he himself had been defrauded, alleged embezzlement by some of his agents, and claimed that covetous merchants in British Honduras were deliberately undermining the development of Poyais as it threatened their profits. Richardson attempted to console the Poyais survivors, vigorously denied the press claims that the country did not exist, and issued libel writs against some of the British newspapers on MacGregor's behalf.|$|E
2500|$|ATA Airlines, one of Southwest Airlines' main {{competitors}} in the Chicago market, historically operated out of Midway Airport alongside Southwest. [...] After ATA declared bankruptcy in 2004, Southwest injected capital into ATA that (among other <b>things)</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> resulted in Southwest's 27.5% ownership stake in ATA upon their exit from Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010, FRC paid $25,000 {{to congressional}} lobbyists {{for what they}} {{described}} as [...] "Res.1064 Ugandan Resolution Pro-homosexual promotion" [...] in a lobbying disclosure report. The US House of Representatives resolution condemned the Uganda Anti-Homosexuality Bill, a bill which, among other <b>things,</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> imposed either the death penalty or life imprisonment for sexual relations between persons of the same sex.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{certainly}} hadn't {{thought of}} it! Such a <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been so impossible {{to me that}} I couldn't have thought of it; and it's so shocking to me now that I don't {{know what to say}} to it." ...|$|R
60|$|EDGAR. [Paying no attention.]--had put {{our feet}} down, the <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been ended long ago, and this poor woman's life wouldn't have been crushed {{out of her}} like this. For all we can tell {{there may be a}} dozen other {{starving}} women.|$|R
2500|$|The Gemara deduced {{from the}} command of [...] "you shall not bring an abomination into your house, lest you be a cursed thing like it," [...] that {{whatever}} one might bring into being out of an idolatrous <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> the same cursed status.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the week}} {{following}} the race, Jones gave his {{view on the}} circumstances surrounding the race and whether championship points should be awarded, writing in Motor magazine [...] "My job is to drive racing cars, not to get involved in politics. As far as I'm concerned, the Spanish GP was no different from normal: it required the same amount of effort, it covered the same distance and I gave it the same dedication that I give to any other Grand Prix. These <b>things</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been the same whether I'd won or lost. As it happened, I won the race, and now I {{have to wait and see}} if I'll be given the points." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June, the Select Committee on Intelligence met {{behind closed}} doors to {{consider}} a draft proposal by Pat Roberts (R-KS) which, among other <b>things,</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> removed {{the primary purpose of}} FISA warrants issued ex parte and in camera to be for foreign intelligence. Instead, the warrants could also have been used for purposes unrelated to foreign intelligence. This was condemned by the ACLU, with ACLU Attorney Lisa Graves complained that the secret hearings into the draft was [...] "an attempt to force the debate onto their terms, versus where the momentum has been headed, which is to roll back the Patriot Act to bring it in line with the Constitution and make sure its tools are focused on terrorists, as opposed to Americans." ...|$|E
2500|$|The MIDAS {{program was}} {{temporarily}} suspended {{at this point}} when a committee headed by ARPA director Jack Ruina recommended that no attempt at an operational missile early warning system be made until the Air Force demonstrated {{that it was a}} feasible concept at all; in addition, Midas's sensors were designed to detect liquid-fueled rocket exhaust, not solid-fueled exhaust, which was now widely seen as the future of ballistic missiles (as <b>things</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> it, the Soviet Union was far behind the United States in development of solid-fueled rockets). The committee found that program management of MIDAS was [...] "awful" [...] and at the current rate of success, [...] "it would take ten years to develop an operational system". In November 1961, the Defense Department issued a directive placing all DoD space programs under strict secrecy, and so MIDAS was given the cover name [...] "Program 461". The development time of the program was also lengthened to give more space to work out problems with the hardware.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{more serious}} than you think, Marie. Now you know that when the trouble began I felt it quite out of the {{question}} for me to run away, and leave you all here in Paris unprotected. Such a <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been preposterous." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So he stood," [...] {{answered}} Balian, [...] "but {{it was not}} of {{him that}} we thought, though assuredly he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> slain some of us.

5000|$|In The Robots of Dawn, Dr. Han Fastolfe {{refers to}} Andrew Martin as a robot that was {{supposed}} to have undergone [...] "gradual humanization," [...] but states that such a <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been impossible, because the shape of the body dictates the state of the mind.|$|R
2500|$|Chad Childers of Loudwire {{stated that}} [...] "the album {{as a whole}} {{continues}} to expand their world-view writing like what listeners got with A Thousand Suns, but it also adds more of the anger that was prevalent in their earliest work, Hybrid Theory." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic declared that [...] "there is definition to their structure, some of the choruses catch hold without too much effort -- but this album remains one of sustained mood, not individual moments" [...] and concludes that the album is [...] "a fitting soundtrack for aging rap-rockers who are comfortable in their skin but restless at heart". The Guardian writer Dave Simpson observed that [...] "Living Things is more personal than A Thousand Suns, with underlying themes of recovery from traumatic experiences. The exception, Burn It Down, delivers an antiwar sentiment via Depeche Mode-y electro-bounce, while the similarly standout Roads Untraveled is an eerie confessional ballad", and concluded that [...] "Living <b>Things</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> benefited from more of such adventure, but they still sound like a band enjoying an unexpected second life". Johan Wippsson of Melodic wrote that the album is [...] "too little too pop-oriented and made for the charts than before. The synthesizers are a bit too intent to Coldplay mode, but assume that the band felt {{it was time to}} conquer the charts again." [...] PopMatters' Jordan Blum concluded that “Living Things is a very good entry that’s simply not as special as its precursor." [...] Phil Mongredien from The Observer comments on their refusal to play it safe and praises their boldness.|$|E

60|$|There are, no doubt, {{restaurants}} {{where this}} sort of <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> excited little comment, but the Cosmopolis {{was not one of}} them. Everybody had something to say, but the only one among those present who had anything sensible to say was the child in the sailor suit.|$|R
6000|$|... "Troth, and {{it might}} very well so be," [...] {{answered}} Gray; [...] "for, {{to tell you the}} truth, when I saw yonder fellow vapouring with his pistols among the woman-folk in my own house, the old Cameronian spirit began to rise in me, and little <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> made me cleek to the poker." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] I said doubtfully. [...] "But we don't know. Perhaps {{he thought}} it safer in the long run. Some one might have talked afterwards. Then the Home Office might have ordered exhumation. The whole <b>thing</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> come out, then, and he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been in an awkward position, for no one <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{believed}} that {{a man of his}} reputation could have been deceived into calling it heart disease." ...|$|R
60|$|By these statesmanlike methods he had {{certainly}} made the place very comfortable. I suppose we all realised that the <b>things</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{to be paid}} for some day, but the thought did not worry us.|$|E

6000|$|Impatiently {{he threw}} the stuff and {{scissors}} down on the floor.

Being unable to manage the jump, she went in with a plunge, and disappeared.|$|R
60|$|London {{was in a}} ferment. I {{could have}} wished to go into details, to {{describe}} in crisp, burning sentences the panic that swept like a tornado through a million homes.
