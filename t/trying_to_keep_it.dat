5|$|The {{bedrock of}} E.V. Ramasamy’s {{principles}} and the movements {{that he started}} was rationalism. He thought that an insignificant minority in society was exploiting the majority and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> in a subordinate position forever. He wanted the exploited to sit up and think about their position, and use their reason to realise {{that they were being}} exploited by a handful of people. If they started thinking, they would realise that they were human beings like the rest, that birth did not and should not endow superiority over others and that they must awaken themselves and do everything possible to improve their own lot.|$|E
25|$|As such a {{large number}} of cups are needed, {{gathering}} normally occurs in large groups of people. The cups are simply stacked within each other until they form a tube or 'snake'. Once the snake has reached the desired length it is held skyward to 'dance' as if being charmed. Snake length is often restricted by the width of the bay of seats as anything longer will protrude into the aisle. One solution to this is to team up with other groups and link your snakes together. One of the biggest challenges is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> in one piece.|$|E
25|$|The Serb-dominated Yugoslav People's Army {{attacked}} Croatia from Bosnia and Herzegovina. Their first {{target was}} Croatian village Ravno that was attacked on 2 November 1991 and completely destroyed. Yugoslavia effected an economic blockade of Bosnia and Herzegovina, thus <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> {{as part of}} Yugoslavia. Later, Yugoslavia claimed territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina with a Serb majority and the capital Sarajevo. Serb Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina was declared on 27 March 1992 with the goal to incorporate parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina into Yugoslavia. The objective of Serbian politics in Bosnia and Herzegovina was to unite Serbian autonomous provinces into a single unit that would join Yugoslavia, and with total blockade of Sarajevo, break Bosnia and Herzegovina into smaller, unconnected and hardly defensible enclaves. Because of superiority in armaments, support from Belgrade and an embargo on the importation of arms into Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Serbs achieved their goals by June 1992.|$|E

According to the behind-the-scenes video, the song features the use of pyrotechnics all throughout the video. When asked about the idea behind the video, Wade said, [...] "The whole concept of this video and just stuff exploding and breaking with my performance to the camera; it's almost like my performance is trying to salvage a relationship together.

500|$|The Appellants {{proceeded}} to prosecute those considered politically {{close to the}} King; this included Nicholas Brembre, and at the Merciless Parliament of 1388, he was condemned to death; Exton, having by now been re-elected Mayor (with, apparently, the King's support, or rege annuente) seems to have acquiesced in the proceedings against (and subsequent hanging of) his earlier ally. Although Exton had been a leading member {{in what has been}} called Brembre's [...] "Ricardian faction" [...] in London, and stayed with Brembre {{as long as he could}} (until March 1387), he deserted him decisively soon after that date. Exton was, it has been said, [...] "in a particularly difficult position." [...] Exton and other aldermen were questioned as to whether Brembre could be supposed to have realised that his actions were treasonous. To this, Exton is supposed to have replied that he [...] "supposed he [...] was aware rather than ignorant of them." [...] Bembre's fate was sealed by Exton and [...] "those that knew him best." [...] Exton had continued the tradition of loyalty to the crown demonstrated by his predecessor, but, significantly, [...] "within limits never acknowledged by the headstong Brembre." [...] As J. A. Tuck said, London [...] "was probably divided, with Brembre trying to win it over to the King's side and Exton... <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> out of politics." ...|$|E
500|$|No Line on the Horizon {{received}} generally favourable reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns {{a weighted}} average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 72, based on 30 reviews. David Fricke of Rolling Stone {{gave it a}} five-star score and called it [...] " [...] best, in its textural exploration and tenacious melodic grip, since 1991's Achtung Baby." [...] In his review for Blender, Rob Sheffield stated [...] "The days are gone when U2 were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> simple—at this point, the lads have realized that over-the-top romantic grandiosity is the style that suits them, so they come on like the cosmic guitar supplicants they were born to be." [...] Uncut magazine's Andrew Mueller commented, [...] "It's U2's least immediate album—but there's something about it that suggests it {{may be one of}} their most enduring." [...] Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly graded it an [...] "A−" [...] and called the album [...] "an eclectic and electrifying winner, one that speaks to the zeitgeist the way only U2 can and dare to do." [...] BBC Music reviewer Chris Jones said, [...] "There's plenty to rejoice about here" [...] while noting that the [...] "symbiotic relationship with Brian Eno (and Daniel Lanois) seems to have reached the point of imperceptibility." [...] NME contributor Ben Patashnik called the album [...] "a grand, sweeping, brave record that, while not quite the reinvention they pegged it as, suggests they've got the chops to retain their relevance well into their fourth decade as a band." ...|$|E
500|$|Pinkner, Abrams, Orci, Burk, Kurtzman, Wyman, and Goldsman {{developed}} the second season's storyline together. Goldsman {{explained that they}} [...] "mapped" [...] out the season [...] "in {{a way that we}} remained fundamentally faithful to". Though they changed certain aspects, they knew where Olivia and Peter were going to start and end up but [...] "got there at different paces than what [...] originally planned". While the first season both focused on Olivia and dealt with discovering the existence of an enemy, the second was designed to [...] " [...] to a very specific type of confrontation" [...] between the two universes. Explained Pinkner, [...] "Season 2 is about the people from 'over there' putting the final pieces of the invasion into play, and explaining why". At the same time, the producers approached the second season as a [...] "journey of self-actualization" [...] and [...] "maturation for our characters." [...] They wanted to make the three main cast members become more comfortable as a team in Fringe Division; Peter thus was written to be more heroic and to go from reluctance to a desire to help his father, while Walter became gradually more independent and [...] "grounded as a human being". They made the secret of Peter's origins one of the main story focuses of the season. While the audience had been made aware of Walter's secret in the season one finale, the producers wanted to [...] "acknowledge it to our characters". All the while Walter was [...] "suffering... and desperately <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> all quiet", Olivia and Peter grew closer to the truth. By [...] "giv these things time" [...] to develop, Pinkner strove to avoid focusing just on [...] "event, event, event", instead concentrating on the real consequences of Peter and Olivia's eventual discovery.|$|E

2500|$|The Rangers got {{early to}} Rick Porcello and scored {{four times in}} the first. Porcello settled down and pitched five {{scoreless}} innings afterwards, despite giving up 12 hits. The Red Sox loaded the bases {{in the bottom of the}} first but could only score one run, on a Jackie Bradley Jr. walk. Boston put a four spot on the board in the third and then scored at least one run in each inning from the fifth on forwards. Both teams combined for 37 hits, with the Red Sox out-hitting the Rangers 21–16. The first inning struggles for Boston pitching continued in game 2, [...] with a first pitch home run by Shin-Soo Choo off of David Price and the first four batters to reach base safely. Price got out of the bases loaded, nobody out jam, with giving up only one more run. Boston missed golden opportunities to score; no runs scored with runners on first and third and nobody out in the first and first and third and one out in the second. In the fourth, down 1–2, Brock Holt and Travis Shaw opened the frame with a double and a single, but Shaw was thrown out at second. Holt would eventually score on back-to-back-to-back walks with two outs. The Red Sox ultimately stranded 14 runners and lost the game. Kimbrel imploded in the ninth, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>it</b> a one run game, giving up four runs and no outs recorded. In game three, Boston scored eleven times in the first four innings. Steven Wright went through five innings, with only one run allowed, but was tagged for five more in the sixth and seventh. Wright gave up four or more earned runs in back-to-back outings for the first time this season. The series saw 43 runs scored on 79 hits.|$|E
