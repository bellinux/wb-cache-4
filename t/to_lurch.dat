500|$|While he was forming up his ships, Persano {{transferred}} from his flagship, [...] to the turret ship [...] This created {{a gap in}} the Italian line, and Tegetthoff seized the opportunity to divide the Italian fleet and create a melee. He made a pass through the gap, but failed to ram any of the Italian ships, forcing him to turn around and make another attempt. During the second attempt, Austrian gunfire had disabled Re d'Italias rudder, leaving her incapable of maneuvering. Tegetthoff seized the opportunity to ram the Italian vessel, and ordered his ship to maximum speed. After two collisions that occurred at angles too oblique to inflict serious damage, Erzherzog Ferdinand Max struck the ship more directly. The Austrian ship's ram tore a gaping hole in Re d'Italias hull on the port side, though Erzherzog Ferdinand Max sustained no significant damage herself. Tegetthoff reversed course, allowing the Italian ironclad <b>to</b> <b>lurch</b> back to port and quickly sink. Tegetthoff initially ordered his crew to lower boats to pick up the Italians struggling in the water, but the Italian ironclad [...] was approaching, and he could not allow his ship to become a stationary target. Instead, he ordered the aviso [...] to remain behind and pick up the survivors while Erzherzog Ferdinand Max engaged San Martino. The other Italian ships, however, did not realize Kaiserin Elizabeth was attempting to pick up the Italian survivors, and so opened fire on her, driving her away from the men in the water.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the day of}} execution, Harney ordered each deserter {{placed on}} a mule cart with a rope around his neck, {{fastening}} each rope to a mass gibbet. Then, {{during the battle of}} Chapultepec, just as the American flag was about to rise above the walls of the Mexican citadel, he ordered the executioners to give the mules a whack, causing the beasts <b>to</b> <b>lurch</b> forward, leaving the deserters in mid-air, dangling [...] "en masse". Some argue that this adversely affected Scott's record, as the events violated numerous Articles of War. Eisenhower, however, attributes the incident to Harney.|$|E
2500|$|An ambitious young detective with a {{complicated}} personal life", {{the character of}} Rachel developed as a strong-willed, initiative and able detective. However, she possesses flaws, which manifest themselves in Bailey's personal life, such as her tempestuous relationship with Nick Savage. Rachel Bailey, who is portrayed as a single woman in her early thirties, contrasts the character of Janet, {{who is in a}} failing marriage and has two daughters. Janet, in her forties, is also wiser than Rachel; Janet is astounded that Rachel has discussed the details of a case with Nick Savage, highlighting Rachel's imprudence regarding her personal life and its effects on her professional life. As one reviewer opined, the character [...] "seemed <b>to</b> <b>lurch</b> from one crisis to another, putting her career – and eventually her life – in danger".|$|E
60|$|My Dog-man imperceptibly {{slipped back}} to the dog again; day by day he became dumb, quadrupedal, hairy. I {{scarcely}} noticed {{the transition from the}} companion on my right hand <b>to</b> the <b>lurching</b> dog at my side.|$|R

2500|$|At first {{all went}} well. Panjandrum {{rolled into the}} sea and began {{to head for the}} shore, the Brass Hats {{watching}} through binoculars from the top of a pebble ridge [...] Then a clamp gave: first one, then two more rockets broke free: Panjandrum began <b>to</b> <b>lurch</b> ominously. It hit a line of small craters in the sand and began to turn to starboard, careering towards Klemantaski, who, viewing events through a telescopic lens, misjudged the distance and continued filming. Hearing the approaching roar he looked up from his viewfinder to see Panjandrum, shedding live rockets in all directions, heading straight for him. As he ran for his life, he glimpsed the assembled admirals and generals diving for cover behind the pebble ridge into barbed-wire entanglements. Panjandrum was now heading back to the sea but crashed on to the sand where it disintegrated in violent explosions, rockets tearing across the beach at great speed.|$|E
2500|$|Taking the {{withdrawal}} of the first two lines as a full blown retreat, the British advanced headlong into the third and final line of disciplined Maryland and Delaware regulars which awaited them on the hill. The 71st Highlanders were ordered to flank the American right. [...] John Eager Howard spotted the flanking movement and ordered the Virginia militiamen manning the American right to turn and face the Scots. [...] However, in the noise of battle, Howard's order was misunderstood and the militiamen began to withdraw. [...] It was now 7:45 am and the British had been fighting for nearly an hour. [...] They were tired and disorganized, but they saw the Virginia militia on the rebels right withdrawing and believed the Americans were on the run. [...] They charged, breaking formation and advancing in a chaotic mass. [...] Morgan ordered a volley. [...] Howard's [...] "fleeing" [...] militia suddenly stopped their withdrawal and made an about-face. [...] The Virginians fired into the British at a range of no more than thirty yards, with slamming deadly effect, causing the confused British <b>to</b> <b>lurch</b> to a halt. [...] John Eager Howard shouted, [...] "Charge bayonets!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{men of the}} First and Third Brigades {{faced the}} same {{challenge}} faced by Second Brigade earlier in the day. [...] The vines in this area hung like ropes between the trees, {{and some of them}} boasted thorns three inches (76mm) [...] long. [...] Additionally, though Fourteen Mile Creek was just inches deep, the nearly vertical banks rose over [...] above the creek bed in places. [...] To compound the command problems created by the terrain, McPherson's men were operating under drum and bugle silence and orders had to be delivered by courier, causing the line <b>to</b> <b>lurch</b> forward unevenly. [...] The men of the 23rd Indiana Infantry Regiment experienced what must have seemed like a stroke of luck at the time—because of a turn in the creek, their right flank rested very near the creek. [...] With a little effort, the unit was across the creek and standing in formation. [...] In order to close the gap created by the march, the unit quick-stepped back the other direction looking {{for the rest of the}} brigade, and stumbled sideways into the jaws of the Confederate trap. The only thing that saved the 23rd Indiana Infantry from wholesale slaughter was the fact that the Confederates had never been issued bayonets.|$|E

The sky had cleared, but not far off an ominous rumble came out of the gloom astern.|$|R

60|$|For {{the instant}} the horse, worse frightened than before, tore along over the uneven surface at a greater rate of speed than ever.

60|$|Later, on {{the same}} day, the Southern Ocean caused the Sapphire <b>to</b> <b>lurch</b> over in such an {{unrestrained}} fashion that the two drawers fitted under Mr. Bunter's sleeping-berth flew out altogether, spilling all their contents. They ought, of course, to have been locked, and Mr. Bunter had only to thank himself for what had happened. He ought to have turned the key on each before going out on deck.|$|E

60|$|The largest tent of the Tasajara camp {{meeting was}} crowded to its utmost extent. The {{excitement}} of that dense mass {{was at its}} highest pitch. The Reverend Stephen Masterton, the single erect, passionate figure of that confused medley of kneeling worshipers, had reached the culminating pitch of his irresistible exhortatory power. Sighs and groans were beginning to respond to his appeals, when the reverend brother was seen <b>to</b> <b>lurch</b> heavily forward and fall to the ground.|$|E
6000|$|... "Soon he {{will fall}} suddenly, {{and we shall}} be crushed," [...] thought Ralph, and had the horse died while {{travelling}} at that speed {{it must have been}} so. But he did not. When within fifty yards of the laager suddenly he began <b>to</b> <b>lurch</b> and roll in his stride; then with three bounds he stopped, and standing still, looked round with piteous blood-shot eyes, and whinnied faintly as though he heard some voice that he knew and loved.|$|E

5000|$|The family summons {{him with}} an ever-present bell pull (in {{the form of a}} hangman's noose).

60|$|Pausing at {{the head}} of one of those narrow lanes which--running down between warehouses, filthy little rag and bone shops, and low poverty-stricken dwellings--appear to {{terminate}} their career, not unwillingly, in the Thames, the sailor gazed before him with nautical earnestness for a few seconds, then glanced at the corner house for a name; found no name; cast his eyes up to the strip of blue sky overhead, as if for inspiration; obtained none; planted his legs wide apart as if he had observed a squall coming, and expected the lane <b>to</b> <b>lurch</b> heavily--wrinkled his eyebrows, and pursed his lips.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} or two they hung on, not daring to move and waiting until they {{gathered}} strength. Then they carefully worked their way to the inner end of the spar and dropped, exhausted, on the deck. There was however, no rest for them. The massive boom must be dragged back and dropped into its crutch. It could not be left <b>to</b> <b>lurch</b> about and smash all it struck. Marston was vaguely conscious that a gang of Krooboys ran to the mainsheet and Wyndham directed their efforts. He, himself, could do no more, and he leaned against the rail, breathing hard.|$|E
60|$|The little skiff was swiftly lowered {{over the}} side and the slack end of the cable {{fastened}} to the after thwart. Cock Badding and his comrades pulled as if they would snap their oars, and the little vessel began slowly <b>to</b> <b>lurch</b> forward over the rollers. But the next moment a larger skiff had splashed {{over the side}} of the Frenchman, and no less than four seamen were hard at work under her bows. If the Marie Rose advanced a yard the Frenchman was going two. Again Cock Badding raved and shook his fist. He clambered aboard, his face wet with sweat and dark with anger.|$|E

60|$|The doctor {{gripped the}} edge of his friend's bunk and tried to think; then, a feeling of nausea {{overcoming}} all others, he clambered hurriedly up the forecastle ladder and <b>lurched</b> <b>to</b> the side of the vessel.|$|R
60|$|One eye {{was fully}} twice the {{diameter}} of the other, and an inch above the horizontal plane of its tiny mate. The nose was but a gaping orifice above a deformed and twisted mouth. The thing was chinless, and its small, foreheadless head surrounded its colossal body like a cannon ball on a hill top. One arm was at least twelve inches longer than its mate, which was itself long in proportion to the torso, while the legs, similarly mismated and terminating in huge, flat feet that protruded laterally, caused the thing <b>to</b> <b>lurch</b> fearfully from side to side as it lumbered toward the girl.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I {{feel better}} now,’ cried poor M’Guire: and with uneven steps, for the {{pavement}} {{of the square}} seemed <b>to</b> <b>lurch</b> and reel under his footing, he fled {{from the scene of}} this disaster. Fled? Alas, from what was he fleeing? Did he not carry that from which he fled along with him? and had he the wings of the eagle, had he the swiftness of the ocean winds, could he have been rapt into the uttermost quarters of the earth, how should he escape the ruin that he carried? We have heard of living men who have been fettered to the dead; the grievance, soberly considered, is no more than sentimental; the case is but a flea-bite to that of him who should be linked, like poor M’Guire, to an explosive bomb.|$|E
60|$|Then {{the canoe}} lurched beneath them, and sped faster still, plunging, rocking, rolling, while the froth beat into her, and Seaforth whirled his paddle in a frenzy. The {{shrinking}} had gone, {{and he was}} only conscious of a curious unreasoning exaltation. A pinnacle of rock flashed by them, there was a roar from Tom, and straining every sinew on the paddle they swung, with eyes dilated and laboured breath, sideways towards the wall of stone. Then the froth that leapt about it swept astern, {{and they were going}} on again, faster than ever, and apparently down a declivity, the spray beating upon them and the canoe swinging her bows out of a frothing confusion. Seaforth heard a cry behind him, but could attach no meaning to it, and whirled his paddle mechanically, until the craft appeared <b>to</b> <b>lurch</b> out from under him, and fall bodily with a great splashing. Twice, it seemed to him, she swung round a great black pool, and then they were driving forward again a trifle more smoothly, while here and there a stunted pine that clung to the rocks came flitting back to them. He felt Okanagan's paddle in his shoulder, and glanced round a moment. There was a green strip behind them that seemed to roll itself together and fall roaring into the pool, but a wisp of mist that blotted out everything drifted across his eyes.|$|E
60|$|Notwithstanding {{her most}} earnest efforts {{to succeed in}} the undertaking, the spoon flew at an {{aggravating}} tangent across the room. In a frantic <b>lurch</b> <b>to</b> capture it she upset her cup, spilling into her lap the steaming tea.|$|R
