25|$|I {{will say}} <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> the colored race {{that men who}} bore arms and {{followed}} {{the flag of the}} Confederacy are, with very few exceptions, your friends. I have an opportunity of saying what I have always felt – that I am your friend, for my interests are your interests, and your interests are my interests. We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live in the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers? I will say that when the war broke out I felt it my duty to stand by my people. When the time came I did the best I could, and I don't believe I flickered. I came here with the jeers of some white people, who think that I am doing wrong. I believe that I can exert some influence, and do much to assist the people in strengthening fraternal relations, and shall do all in my power to bring about peace. It has always been my motto to elevate every man- to depress none. (Applause.) I want to elevate you to take positions in law offices, in stores, on farms, and wherever you are capable of going.|$|E

2500|$|The Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer saw in Isaac's two {{blessings of}} Jacob in [...] and [...] an {{application}} of the teaching of [...] "Better {{is the end of}} a thing than the beginning." [...] The Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer noted that the first blessings with which Isaac blessed Jacob in [...] concerned dew and grain — material blessings. The final blessings in [...] concerned the foundation of the world, and were without interruption either in this world or in the world to come, for [...] says, [...] "And God Almighty bless you." [...] And Isaac further added the blessing of Abraham, as [...] says, [...] "And may He give you the blessing of Abraham, <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> your seed with you." [...] Therefore, the Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer concluded {{that the end of the}} thing — Isaac's final blessing of Jacob — was better than the beginning thereof.|$|E

[...] After this performance, Miss America CEO Sam Haskell issued a public apology to Williams, stating:I have been {{a close friend of}} this beautiful and talented lady for 32 years. You have lived your life in grace and dignity, and never was it more evident than during the events of 1984, when you resigned. Though none of us currently in the organization were involved then, on behalf of today's organization, I want to apologize <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> your mother, Miss Helen Williams. I want to apologize for anything that was said or done that made you feel any less the Miss America you are and the Miss America you always will be.Williams responded by stating that she did the [...] "best that I could, in my reign as Miss America, from 1983 to 1984." ...|$|E
2500|$|Both Kate Blanchard and Scholz {{note that}} there are several {{passages}} in the Book of Isaiah, Book of Jeremiah, and Book of Ezekiel that utilize rape metaphors. Blanchard expressed outrage over this fact, writing [...] "The translations of these shining examples of victim-blaming are clear enough, despite the old-fashioned language: I'm angry and you're going to suffer for it. You deserve to be raped because of your sexual exploits. You're a slut {{and it was just}} a matter of time till you suffered the consequences. Let this be a lesson <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> all other uppity women." [...] Scholz discussed four passages—Isaiah 3:16-17, Jeremiah 13:22 and 26, Ezekiel 16, and Ezekiel 23. On Isaiah, Scholz wrote that there is a common mistranslation of the Hebrew word pōt as [...] "forehead" [...] or [...] "scalp". Also often translated as [...] "genitals", Scholz believes that a more accurate translation of the word in context is [...] "cunt". Regarding Jeremiah, Scholz wrote, [...] "The poem proclaims that the woman brought this fate upon herself and she is to be blamed for it, while the prophet sides with the sexually violent perpetrators, viewing the attack as deserved and God as justifying it. Rape poetics endorses 'masculine authoritarianism' and the 'dehumanization of women,' perhaps especially when the subject is God." ...|$|E

Clinton and Gore spent the day at Ygnacio Valley High School, as part of the drive to connect California public schools to the Internet. In a speech given at YVH, Clinton stated that he was excited to see that his {{challenge}} the previous September to [...] "Californians to connect at least 20 percent of your schools to the Information Superhighway {{by the end of this}} school year" [...] was met. Clinton also described this event as part of a time of [...] "absolutely astonishing transformation; a moment of great possibility. All of you know that the information and technology explosion will offer <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> the young people of the future more opportunities and challenges than any generation of Americans has ever seen." [...] In a prepared statement, Gore added that NetDay was part of one of the major goals of the Clinton administration, which was [...] "to give every child in America access to high quality educational technology by the dawn of the new century." [...] Gore also stated that the administration planned [...] "to connect every classroom to the Internet by the year 2000." [...] On April 28, 1998, Gore honored numerous volunteers who had been involved with NetDay and [...] "who helped connect students to the Internet in 700 of the poorest schools in the country" [...] via [...] "an interactive online session with children across the country." ...|$|E

2500|$|Thirty-two {{years after}} she resigned, Vanessa Williams {{returned}} to the Miss America stage on September 13, 2015, for the Miss America 2016 pageant as head judge (where Miss Georgia 2015, Betty Cantrell, won the crown). The pageant began with Miss America CEO Sam Haskell issuing an apology to Williams, telling her that although [...] "none of us currently in the organization were involved then, on behalf of today's organization, I want to apologize <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> your mother, Miss Helen Williams. I want to apologize for anything that was said or done that made you feel any less the Miss America you are and the Miss America you always will be." [...] Suzette Charles (Williams' replacement) {{said in an interview}} with Inside Edition that she was perplexed over the apology and suggested that it was given for the purpose of ratings. Williams also commented on the events surrounding her return, stating in an interview with Robin Roberts that [...] "there's a lot of people who feel I should return, so the people who harbor the resentment I understand it but realize that all of those people that were part of the old guard are no longer there." [...] In the same interview, Roberts mentioned to Williams that in the present day (c. 2015), [...] "people now release [...] things to make a career." [...] Williams responded: [...] "That's crazy. To think that oh you can look at a scandal and think that that would be good for your career, where for me it took every ounce of credibility and talent that I had and wiped it out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reading the words, [...] "And I {{appeared}} to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob," [...] in [...] a Midrash taught that God thus told Moses that God longed {{for those who}} were gone and could not be replaced – the three Patriarchs. The Midrash said that God told Moses that many times, God had revealed God's Self to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty ( [...] , El Shadai), and God had not made known to them that God's name is the Lord ( [...] , the Tetragrammaton). But still they did not criticize God's ways. To Abraham, God said in [...] "Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it, for to you will I give it," [...] yet when Abraham wanted to bury Sarah, he found no plot of ground until he had purchased one; still, he did not murmur at God's ways. God said to Isaac in [...] "Sojourn in this land [...] [...] [...] for <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> your seed, I will give all these lands." [...] Yet when Isaac sought water to drink, he found none; instead (as [...] reports), [...] "The herdsmen of Gerar strove with Isaac's herdsmen, saying: ‘The water is ours.'" [...] Still Isaac did not murmur at God's ways. God said to Jacob in [...] "The land on which you lie, to you will I give it, and to your seed." [...] Yet when he sought a place to pitch his tent, he found none until he purchased one for a hundred kesitah (as reported in [...] ). And still Jacob did not complain at God's ways. The Patriarchs did not ask God, as Moses did in [...] what God's name was. In contrast, at the commencement of God's commission of Moses, Moses inquired of God's name. And in [...] Moses told God, [...] "For since I came to Pharaoh [...] [...] [...] he has dealt ill with this people; neither have You delivered Your people." [...] On this account, the Midrash taught, God said in [...] "And I have also established my covenant with them," [...] the Patriarchs, to give them the land, and they never complained of God's ways. And God said in [...] "I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel," [...] because they did not complain against God. Although the Israelites of that generation did not conduct themselves righteously, yet God heard their cry on account of the covenant that God had made with the Patriarchs. Hence, it says in [...] "And I have remembered My covenant. Therefore, say to the children of Israel." [...] The Midrash taught that the word [...] "therefore" [...] ( [...] , lachein) in [...] implies an oath, as it does in [...] where God says, [...] "And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli." [...] Thus, the Midrash taught that God swore to Moses that God would redeem the Israelites, so that Moses would have no reason to fear that the Attribute of Justice would retard their redemption.|$|E
