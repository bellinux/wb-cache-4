5|$|I think {{everyone}} who disses the Columbine RPG is gutless. Most haven't played the game, or have played it with such preconceptions that they're blinded to the genuis , the honesty, {{the beauty of}} its social commentary. Super Columbine Massacre RPG is riddled with design flaws and has mediocre graphics by 1995, the maker of the game admits this, but it regardless {{is a work of}} art. It puts you in the mindset of the killers and provides a very clear suggestion of why they did what they did; they were enacting an ideological demonstration through a <b>terrorist</b> <b>act,</b> and the game shines light on this as an indictment of the American dream and way of life painfully close to the main nerve.|$|E

5000|$|Controversies {{surrounding}} the subject include disagreements over whether <b>terrorist</b> <b>acts</b> are self-defense or aggression, national self-determination or Islamic supremacy; whether Islam can ever condone the targeting of non-combatants; whether some attacks described as Islamic terrorism are merely <b>terrorist</b> <b>acts</b> committed by Muslims or <b>terrorist</b> <b>acts</b> motivated by nationalism; whether Zionism and the Arab-Israeli Conflict {{are at the}} root of Islamic terrorism, or simply one cause of it; how much support for Islamic terrorism exists in the Muslim world and whether support of terrorism is only a temporary phenomenon, a [...] "bubble", now fading away.|$|R

25|$|France {{threatened}} {{an economic}} embargo of New Zealand's {{exports to the}} European Economic Community if the pair were not immediately released. Such an action would have been crippling to the New Zealand economy which {{at that time was}} heavily dependent on agricultural exports to Britain. Operation Satanic was a public relations disaster. New Zealand was an ally of France. France initially denied any involvement, and even joined in condemnation of it as a <b>terrorist</b> <b>act.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the 2002 Los Angeles International Airport {{shooting}} of July 4, 2002, Hesham Mohamed Hadayet killed two Israelis at the ticket counter of El Al Airlines at LAX. Although the gunman was not linked to any terrorist group, {{the man was}} upset at U.S. support for Israel, and therefore was motivated by political disagreement. This led the FBI to classify this shooting as a <b>terrorist</b> <b>act,</b> {{one of the few}} on U.S. soil since the September 11 attacks.|$|E

The US Federal Bureau of Investigation classified the shooting as a <b>terrorist</b> <b>act,</b> one of the few on US soil since the September 11, 2001 attacks.|$|E

25|$|Headley {{has also}} spoken of how after the Mumbai attacks, ISI wanted LeT to disown {{them in order}} to prevent global {{attention}} to the terror group. Pakistan considers it to be an important strategic asset to be used against India. With Ajmal Kasab as the only terrorist captured, ISI wanted to blame the <b>terrorist</b> <b>act</b> on al-Qaida. It prepared a list of 4-5 al-Qaida figures who were to be projected as the conspirators. The plan, however, did not work due to resistance from Lashkar leaders, particularly Zakiur Rahman Lakhvi.|$|E
25|$|Adolf Verloc: {{a secret}} agent {{who owns a}} shop in Soho in London. His primary characteristic, as {{described}} by Conrad, is indolence. He has been employed by an unnamed embassy to spy on revolutionary groups, which then orders him to instigate a <b>terrorist</b> <b>act</b> against the Greenwich Observatory. Their belief is that the resulting public outrage will force the British government to act more forcibly against émigré socialist and anarchist activists. He {{is part of an}} anarchist organisation that creates pamphlets under the heading The Future of the Proletariat. He is married to Winnie, and lives with his wife, his mother-in-law, and his brother-in-law, Stevie.|$|E
25|$|Glimpses of {{television}} news programs {{reveal that the}} US government considers the shooting a <b>terrorist</b> <b>act</b> and is pressuring the Moroccan government to apprehend the culprits. Having traced the rifle back to Hassan, the Moroccan police descend on his house and roughly question {{him and his wife}} until they reveal that the rifle was given to him by a Japanese man, and then sold to Abdullah. The two boys see the police on the road and confess to their father what they have done, believing {{at the time that the}} American woman has died of her wounds. The three flee from their house, retrieving the rifle as they go. The police corner them on the rocky slope of a hill and open fire. After Ahmed is hit in the leg, Yussef returns fire, striking one police officer in the shoulder. The police continue shooting, hitting Ahmed in the back, possibly fatally injuring him. As his father rages with grief, Yussef surrenders and confesses to the crimes, begging clemency for his family and medical assistance for his brother. The police take him into custody.|$|E

25|$|The Air India Flight 182 bombing, which {{originated}} in Montreal, happened during Mulroney's first term. This {{was the largest}} <b>terrorist</b> <b>act</b> before September 11, 2001, {{with the majority of}} the 329 victims being Canadian citizens. Mulroney sent a letter of condolence to then Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, which sparked an uproar in Canada since he did not call families of the actual victims to offer condolences. Gandhi replied that he should be the one providing condolences to Mulroney, given that the majority of victims were Canadian or lived in Canada. Many Indo-Canadians considered this to be a racist act because they felt Mulroney did not consider them to be true Canadian citizens as they were not of European descent. Furthermore, there were several warnings from the Indian government to the Mulroney government about terrorist threats towards Air India flights. Questions remain as to why these warnings were not taken more seriously and whether the events leading to the bombing could have been prevented. The Governor General-in-Council in 2006 appointed the former Supreme Court Justice John Major to conduct a commission of inquiry. His report was completed and released on 17 June 2010.|$|E
500|$|Awards {{are granted}} by the Governor-General with the {{approval}} of the Sovereign. The warrant for the Victoria Cross for Australia differs markedly from the Imperial warrant. The new warrant does not specify any particular process for recommendations, though it is expected that any recommendation will pass through the military hierarchy to the Minister for Defence. The new warrant also allows for [...] "other persons determined by the Minister [...] {{for the purposes of this}} regulation." [...] Author Robert Macklin has speculated that this has opened up the field of eligibility to policemen and women or civilians during a <b>terrorist</b> <b>act.</b> He goes on to say that by [...] "separating the VC from its traditional roots the Hawke government can be accused, with some justice, of devaluing the honour..." [...] Subsequent awards of the Victoria Cross for Australia to the same individual shall be made in the form of a bar to the Cross. Where a person has been awarded a second or three or more awards, the post nominals [...] "VC and Bar" [...] or [...] "VC and Bars" [...] may be used.|$|E
500|$|Roddenberry said of Christianity, [...] "How can I {{take seriously}} a God-image that {{requires}} that I prostrate myself every seven days and praise it? That {{sounds to me}} like a very insecure personality." [...] At one point, he worked a similar opinion, which was to have been stated by a Vulcan, into the plot for Star Trek: The God Thing. Before his death, Roddenberry became close friends with philosopher Charles Musès, who said that Roddenberry's views were [...] "a far cry from atheism". Roddenberry explained his position thusly: [...] "It's not true that I don't believe in God. I believe in a kind of God. It's just not other people's God. I reject religion. I accept the notion of God." [...] He had an ongoing interest in other people's experiences with religion, and called Catholicism [...] "a very beautiful religion. An art form." [...] However, he said that he dismissed all organized religions, saying that for the most part, they acted like a [...] "substitute brain... and a very malfunctioning one". Roddenberry was also critical of how the public looked at certain religions, noting that when the King David Hotel bombing took place in 1946, the American public accepted it as the action of freedom fighters, whereas a car bombing by a Muslim in Beirut is condemned as a <b>terrorist</b> <b>act.</b> While he agreed that both parties were wrong in their use of violence, he said that the actions of both were undertaken because of their strong religious beliefs.|$|E
