5|$|Besides meditation, Luang Pu Sodh {{promoted}} {{the study of}} Buddhism as well. In this combination {{he was one of}} the pioneers in Thai Buddhism. In 1939, Luang Pu Sodh set up a Pali Institute at Wat Paknam, which is said to have cost 2.5 million baht. Luang Pu Sodh financed the building through the production of amulets, which is common in Thai Buddhism. The kitchen which he built was <b>the</b> <b>fulfillment</b> <b>of</b> an intention which he had since his first years at Wat Pho, when he experienced difficulty in finding food. It also resulted in monks having more time to study the Dhamma.|$|E

5|$|In {{the autumn}} and winter of 1382, Flanders had been invaded by Charles VI of France. Philip Van Artevelde had fallen at the Battle of Roosebeke {{and the country}} had been {{compelled}} {{to submit to the}} French king, who obliged all the conquered towns to recognise Clement VII. In response to events in Flanders, Pope Urban issued bulls for the proclamation of a crusade, choosing Bishop Despenser to lead a campaign against the followers of Clement VII in Flanders.

5|$|Although Muhammad had {{delivered}} Quranic verses commanding the Hajj, the Muslims had not performed it due to Quraysh enmity. In {{the month of}} Shawwal 628, Muhammad ordered his followers to obtain sacrificial animals and {{to prepare for a}} pilgrimage (umrah) to Mecca, saying that God had promised him <b>the</b> <b>fulfillment</b> <b>of</b> this goal in a vision when he was shaving his head after completion of the Hajj. Upon hearing of the approaching 1,400 Muslims, the Quraysh dispatched 200 cavalry to halt them. Muhammad evaded them by taking a more difficult route, enabling his followers to reach al-Hudaybiyya just outside Mecca. According to Watt, although Muhammad's decision to make the pilgrimage was based on his dream, he was also demonstrating to the pagan Meccans that Islam did not threaten the prestige of the sanctuaries, that Islam was an Arabian religion.|$|E
5|$|Many {{scholars}} {{who see the}} gospel nativity stories as later apologetic accounts created to establish the Messianic status of Jesus regard the Star of Bethlehem as a pious fiction. Aspects of Matthew's account which have raised questions of the historical event include: Matthew {{is the only one}} of the four gospels which mentions either the Star of Bethlehem or the Magi. In Mark 6:1-4, the author of the Gospel of Mark, considered by modern text scholars to be the oldest of the Gospels, does not appear to be aware of the Bethlehem nativity story.. Scholars suggest that Jesus was born in Nazareth and that the Bethlehem nativity narratives reflect a desire by the Gospel writers to present his birth as <b>the</b> <b>fulfillment</b> <b>of</b> prophecy. The Matthew account conflicts with that given in the Gospel of Luke, in which the family of Jesus already live in Nazareth, travel to Bethlehem for the census, and return home almost immediately.|$|E
5|$|When the Danes stalled and {{prolonged}} <b>the</b> <b>fulfillment</b> <b>of</b> some {{provisions of the}} Treaty of Roskilde by postponing payments and not blocking foreign fleets from access to the Baltic Sea, and {{with half of the}} 2,000 Danish soldiers that were obliged by Roskilde to enter Swedish service deserting, the Swedish king embarked from Kiel with a force of 10,000 men on 16 August. While everyone expected him to head for Royal Prussia, he disembarked on Zealand on 17 August, and headed for Copenhagen, which was defended by 10,650 Danes and 2,000 Dutch. This time however, the town did not surrender, and a long siege ensued. When Swedish forces took Kronborg in September, they controlled both sides of the Øresund, yet in November a Dutch fleet broke the Swedish naval blockade of Copenhagen in the Battle of the Sound.|$|E

5|$|Eusebius {{listed the}} Gospel of the Hebrews in his Antilegomena {{as one of}} the disputed {{writings}} of the early Church. Despite this, the Church Fathers occasionally used it, with reservations, as a source to support their exegetical arguments. Eusebius reports that the 2nd century Church Father Hegesippus used the gospel as a source for writing his Hypomneumata ("Memoranda") in Rome (c.175–180). The Alexandrian Fathers – Clement, Origen, and Didymus the Blind – relied directly on the gospel to provide prooftexts as a supplement to the canonical gospels. Clement quoted from the gospel as part of a discourse on divine Wisdom. Origen used it to compare differing views {{of the relationship between the}} Word and the Holy Spirit. Jerome claimed to have used the gospel as a prooftext, although he may have relied in part on excerpts from the commentaries of Origen. He quoted from it as a proof from prophecy based on Isaiah11.2 to explain how Jesus was <b>the</b> <b>fulfillment</b> <b>of</b> messianic expectations. The Gospel of the Hebrews was excluded from the canon by the Catholic Church with the closing of the New Testament canon at the end of the 4th century, and was no longer cited as a source in Church literature.|$|E
5|$|For Mint Chief Engraver Frank Gasparro, the {{opportunity}} to put Eisenhower on a coin was <b>the</b> <b>fulfillment</b> <b>of</b> a longtime dream. On June 19, 1945, Gasparro {{had been one of}} more than 4 million people who gathered in New York to watch a parade celebrating the Allied victory in Europe. Although Gasparro, then an assistant engraver at the Mint, only saw a glimpse of General Eisenhower, he stepped back from the crowd and drew the general's features. That sketch served as the basis of his design for the obverse. Gasparro consulted with the late president's widow, Mamie Eisenhower, as to the designs of both sides of the coin; the former First Lady was presented with a galvano (a metallic model used in the coin design process) by Brooks and Gasparro on January 1, 1971. Gasparro wrote in 1991 that he had six weeks to complete the work beginning in mid-November 1970, that his extensive research into eagles over the years was a great help in creating the reverse, and that his sketches were adopted without change. The chief engraver was not given full freedom of design; he was instructed to have the layout of the obverse resemble that of the Washington quarter.|$|E
