5|$|The 1956 Dartmouth {{conference was}} the moment <b>that</b> <b>AI</b> gained its name, its mission, its first success and its major players, and is widely {{considered}} the birth of AI.|$|E
5|$|Expert systems {{restricted}} {{themselves to}} a small domain of specific knowledge (thus avoiding the commonsense knowledge problem) and their simple design made it relatively easy for programs to be built and then modified once they were in place. All in all, the programs proved to be useful: something <b>that</b> <b>AI</b> {{had not been able}} to achieve up to this point.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Kubrick and Harlan thought A.I. {{would be}} closer to Steven Spielberg's {{sensibilities}} as director. Kubrick handed the position to Spielberg in 1995, but Spielberg chose to direct other projects, and convinced Kubrick to remain as director. The film was put on hold due to Kubrick's commitment to Eyes Wide Shut (1999). After the filmmaker's death in March 1999, Harlan and Christiane Kubrick approached Spielberg {{to take over the}} director's position. By November 1999, Spielberg was writing the screenplay based on Watson's 90-page story treatment. It was his first solo screenplay credit since Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). Spielberg remained close to Watson's treatment, but removed various sex scenes with Gigolo Joe. Pre-production was briefly halted during February 2000, because Spielberg pondered directing other projects, which were Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Minority Report and Memoirs of a Geisha. The following month Spielberg announced <b>that</b> <b>A.I.</b> would be his next project, with Minority Report as a follow-up. When he decided to fast track A.I., Spielberg brought Chris Baker back as concept artist.|$|E
5000|$|A {{survey of}} {{reports from the}} mid-2000s {{suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>AI's</b> reputation was still less than stellar: ...|$|R
50|$|One {{proposal}} {{to deal with}} this {{is to make sure that}} the first generally intelligent AI is friendly <b>AI,</b> <b>that</b> would then endeavor to ensure <b>that</b> subsequently developed <b>AIs</b> were also nice to us. But, friendly AI is harder to create than plain AGI, and therefore it is likely, in a race between the two, <b>that</b> non-friendly <b>AI</b> would be developed first. Also, there is no guarantee <b>that</b> friendly <b>AI</b> would remain friendly, or that its progeny would also all be good.|$|R
50|$|Alexander Wissner-Gross says <b>that</b> <b>AIs</b> {{driven to}} {{maximize}} their future freedom of action (or causal path entropy) might be considered friendly if their planning horizon is longer than a certain threshold, and unfriendly if their planning horizon is shorter than that threshold.|$|R
5|$|The novel {{begins the}} day before an {{audience}} <b>that</b> <b>Ai</b> has obtained with Argaven Harge, the king of Karhide. Ai manages this through the help of Estraven, the prime minister, who seems to believe in Ai's mission, but {{the night before the}} audience, Estraven tells Ai that he can no longer support Ai's cause with the king. Ai begins to doubt Estraven's loyalty because of his strange mannerisms, which Ai finds effeminate and ambiguous. The behavior of people in Karhide is dictated by shifgrethor, an intricate set of unspoken social rules and formal courtesy. Ai does not understand this system, thus making it difficult for him to understand Estraven's motives, and contributing to his distrust of Estraven. The next day, as he prepares to meet the King, Ai learns that Estraven has been accused of treason, and exiled from the country. The pretext for Estraven's exile was his handling of a border dispute with the neighboring country of Orgoreyn, in which Estraven was seen as being too conciliatory. Ai meets with the king, who rejects his offer to join the Ekumen. Discouraged, Ai decides to travel through Karhide, as the spring has just begun, rendering the interior of the country accessible.|$|E
25|$|Joseph Weizenbaum wrote <b>that</b> <b>AI</b> {{applications}} cannot, by definition, successfully simulate genuine human {{empathy and}} {{that the use of}} AI technology in fields such as customer service or psychotherapy was deeply misguided. Weizenbaum was also bothered <b>that</b> <b>AI</b> researchers (and some philosophers) were willing to view the human mind as nothing more than a computer program (a position now known as computationalism). To Weizenbaum these points suggest <b>that</b> <b>AI</b> research devalues human life.|$|E

50|$|While not {{actively}} malicious, {{there is no}} reason to think <b>that</b> <b>AIs</b> would actively promote human goals unless they could be programmed as such, and if not, might use the resources currently used to support mankind to promote its own goals, causing human extinction.|$|R

25|$|John Haugeland, who {{coined the}} term GOFAI (Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence), also {{proposed}} <b>that</b> <b>AI</b> should more properly {{be referred to as}} synthetic intelligence, a term which has since been adopted by some non-GOFAI researchers.|$|E
25|$|The visual novel's Japanese voice actor {{have all}} commented on their time {{working on the}} title. Mayu Fujisaki {{comments}} that her time spent of Ai's character was a valuable experience. She comments <b>that</b> <b>Ai</b> is cute, gentle and tolerant.|$|E
25|$|Dreyfus {{began to}} {{formulate}} his critique {{in the early}} 1960s {{while he was a}} professor at MIT, then a hotbed of artificial intelligence research. His first publication on the subject is a half-page objection to a talk given by Herbert A. Simon in the spring of 1961. Dreyfus was especially bothered, as a philosopher, <b>that</b> <b>AI</b> researchers seemed to believe they {{were on the verge of}} solving many long standing philosophical problems within a few years, using computers.|$|E
50|$|In their {{discussion}} of Omohundro and Yudkowsky's work, Russell and Norvig cite I. J. Good's 1965 prediction that when computer systems begin to outperform humans in software engineering tasks, this {{may result in}} a feedback loop of increasingly capable AI systems. This raises the possibility <b>that</b> <b>AI's</b> impact could increase very quickly after it reaches a certain level of capability.|$|R

25|$|Amnesty International (AI) {{has been}} accused by the American Jewish Congress and NGO Monitor of having a double {{standard}} with its assessment of Israel. Professor Alan Dershowitz, an American legal scholar and columnist for the Huffington Post, has attacked Amnesty International's perceived bias against Israel, claiming <b>that</b> <b>AI</b> absolves Palestinian men of responsibility for domestic violence and places the blame on Israel instead and that it illegitimately characterises legal acts of Israeli self-defence as war-crimes. Dershowitz has joined NGO Monitor's calls for an independent evaluation of anti-Israeli bias within the organisation.|$|E
25|$|On December 24, 2008 {{at about}} 3:30p.m. (JST), Iijima {{was found dead}} in her 21st floor Tokyo apartment, not far from Shibuya Crossing. She was found lying face-down on the floor when medics forced their way into her place. She had been dead for about seven days, police said. On March 3, 2007, Sports Nippon had {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>Ai</b> Iijima was suffering from hay fever, pyelitis (ascending urinary tract infection that has reached the pyelum (pelvis) of the kidney), cystitis, and acute backache. She had written in her blog that she had kidney problems and inflammation of the urinary tract and bladder. In February 2009, police announced that the pathology examination showed she had died of pneumonia, {{and that there was no}} suggestion of either suicide or murder.|$|E
25|$|Ai-Khanoum (Aï Khānum, also Ay Khanum, lit. “Lady Moon” in Uzbek), {{possibly}} the historical Alexandria on the Oxus, also possibly later named اروکرتیه or Eucratidia) {{was one of}} the primary cities of the Greco-Bactrian kingdom. Previous scholars have argued <b>that</b> <b>Ai</b> Khanoum was founded in the late 4th century BC, following the conquests of Alexander the Great. Recent analysis now strongly suggests that the city was founded c. 280 BC by the Seleucid king Antiochus I. The city is located in Takhar Province, northern Afghanistan, at the confluence of the Oxus river (today's Amu Darya) and the Kokcha river, and at the doorstep of the Indian subcontinent. Ai-Khanoum {{was one of the}} focal points of Hellenism in the East for nearly two centuries, until its annihilation by nomadic invaders around 145BC about the time of the death of Eucratides.|$|E
5000|$|In April 2011, {{days after}} Ai Weiwei {{was arrested by}} the Chinese government, Sima {{attended}} a web show denouncing him. Sima claimed <b>that</b> <b>Ai's</b> fame was due to his anti-China stance, and Ai received foreign funding to subvert China. Sima warned that if [...] "Ai had his way, China will be worse". Upon learning Sima's accusations, Ai's mother challenged Sima to show evidence backing his claims.|$|R

500|$|The {{novel is}} framed {{as part of}} the report <b>that</b> <b>Ai</b> sends back to the Ekumen after his time on Gethen, and as such, {{suggests}} <b>that</b> <b>Ai</b> is selecting and ordering the material. Ai narrates ten chapters in the first person; the rest are made up of extracts from Estraven's personal diary and ethnological reports from an earlier observer from the Ekumen, interspersed with Gethenian myths and legends. The novel begins with the following statement from Ai, explaining the need for multiple voices in the novel: ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 80s, the Strategic Computing Initiative cut funding to AI [...] "deeply and brutally." [...] New {{leadership}} at DARPA had decided <b>that</b> <b>AI</b> was not [...] "the next wave" [...] and directed funds towards projects that seemed {{more likely to}} produce immediate results.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 60s, Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert of the MIT AI Laboratory {{proposed}} <b>that</b> <b>AI</b> research {{should focus on}} artificially simple situations known as micro-worlds. They pointed out that in successful sciences like physics, basic principles were often best understood using simplified models like frictionless planes or perfectly rigid bodies. Much of the research focused on a [...] "blocks world," [...] which consists of colored blocks of various shapes and sizes arrayed on a flat surface.|$|E
50|$|March of the Machines: Why the New Race of Robots Will Rule the World (1997, hardcover), {{published}} in paperback as March of the Machines: The Breakthrough in Artificial Intelligence (2004), {{is a book}} by Kevin Warwick.

2500|$|A {{platform}} (or [...] "computing platform") {{is defined}} as [...] "some sort of hardware architecture or software framework (including application frameworks), that allows software to run". As Rodney Brooks pointed out many years ago, {{it is not just}} the artificial intelligence software <b>that</b> defines the <b>AI</b> features of the platform, but rather the actual platform itself <b>that</b> affects the <b>AI</b> <b>that</b> results, i.e., there needs to be work in AI problems on real-world platforms rather than in isolation.|$|R
500|$|The {{approach}} revived {{ideas from}} cybernetics and control theory {{that had been}} unpopular since the sixties. Another precursor was David Marr, {{who had come to}} MIT in the late 70s from a successful background in theoretical neuroscience to lead the group studying vision. He rejected all symbolic approaches (both McCarthy's logic and Minsky's frames), arguing <b>that</b> <b>AI</b> needed to understand the physical machinery of vision from the bottom up before any symbolic processing took place. (Marr's work would be cut short by leukemia in 1980.) ...|$|E
500|$|AI {{researchers}} {{began to}} develop and use sophisticated mathematical tools more than they ever had in the past. There was a widespread realization {{that many of the}} problems <b>that</b> <b>AI</b> needed to solve were already being worked on by researchers in fields like mathematics, economics or operations research. The shared mathematical language allowed both a higher level of collaboration with more established and successful fields and the achievement of results which were measurable and provable; AI had become a more rigorous [...] "scientific" [...] discipline. [...] describe this as nothing less than a [...] "revolution" [...] and [...] "the victory of the neats".|$|E
500|$|These critiques {{were not}} taken seriously by AI researchers, often because they seemed {{so far off}} the point. Problems like intractability and commonsense {{knowledge}} seemed much more immediate and serious. It was unclear what difference [...] "know how" [...] or [...] "intentionality" [...] made to an actual computer program. Minsky said of Dreyfus and Searle [...] "they misunderstand, and should be ignored." [...] Dreyfus, who taught at MIT, was given a cold shoulder: he later said <b>that</b> <b>AI</b> researchers [...] "dared not be seen having lunch with me." [...] Joseph Weizenbaum, the author of ELIZA, felt his colleagues' treatment of Dreyfus was unprofessional and childish. Although he was {{an outspoken critic of}} Dreyfus' positions, he [...] "deliberately made it plain that theirs was not the way to treat a human being." ...|$|E
5000|$|Worth {{returns to}} the conference and learns that a biotech {{conglomerate}} sent a militia to Stateless, angry at the technology they have appropriated. He negotiates with the militia to let a suddenly ill Violet return to South Africa, where she dies. Before her illness, however, she tasked an AI to synthesize her final theory. The militia moves {{to take over the}} main city of Stateless, so the citizens move to the outskirts and let the invaders die by destroying the city when its structural underpinnings are consumed by triggered microorganisms. Worth is fired from SeeNet and Sarah Knight replaces him, covering the war. Worth discovers that Sarah was working with the cultists, and <b>that</b> <b>AIs</b> are exhibiting symptoms of the titular mental illness as well.
