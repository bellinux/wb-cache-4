50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s he {{proposed}} the multi-competence approach to second language acquisition. Multi-competence is 'the knowledge of two languages in one mind', and it holds {{that those who}} know more than one language have different minds from those with only one language, because knowing two languages changes the way people use their first language, and even the way they think. These multicompetent individuals should be called 'L2 users' (pronounced 'L two users') rather than 'second language learners', because the word 'second' has negative connotations, and the word 'learner' should only be applied {{to those who are}} learning a language (just like a native speaker is not called a 'first language learner'). All human beings have the potential for becoming multi-competent, so monolinguals are not indicative of what the human mind can achieve. This has implications for language learners and teachers, for instance the purpose of L2 learning is to become a multicompetent user of more than one language, not to become a copycat of a native speaker of another language; the native speaker is not the best L2 teacher; L2 learners are allowed to use their first language in the classroom. Also, teachers and learners must bear in mind that L2 learning changes how people think. In a paper dated 1997 Cook first argued that knowledge of more than one language can change how people think. He then provided evidence in the first ever workshop devoted to the <b>topic</b> (<b>workshop</b> on ‘Bilingual Cognition’, 2002, within the European Second Language Association conference) and showcased research from a variety of disciplines and languages in his latest edited volume (Language and Bilingual Cognition, 2010, with Benedetta Bassetti).|$|E
40|$|Workshop (2) Overview The Prolearn Network of Excellence has {{facilitated}} {{a large-scale}} foresight {{work that has}} resulted in a set of future visions for Technology-Enhanced Professional Learning. This workshop will focus on defining the critical capabilities needed to achieve the desired futures. The workshop is organized as a Learning Café ensuring that all participants can have direct impact on how the gap will be crossed. The workshop participants will be engaged in highly interactive, structured sessions that are formed around the 3 main themes of the workshop. For each theme, a key-note speaker will set out the current key issues and needs and give some examples of the role of today’s Technology-Enhanced Learning in relation to that <b>topic.</b> <b>Workshop</b> participants then will discuss the roadmap for the selected processes, to explore ideas about FUTURE issues and needs, and the role of current and FUTURE Technology-Enhanced Learning in addressing both user needs of today and emerging needs. The working method employed in the workshop is known as “learning discussion forum ” or “Learning Café”, and has been successfully been implemented in a number of events involving European experts. This group dynamics technique was initially developed by Juanita Brown and David Isaacs (MIT). The knowledge creating process, conceived by Nonaka and Takeuchi, was later adapted and added to the methodology by Leenamaija Otala. The three main themes of the workshop:- PERSONALISATION: learning for you, where, how and when you want to learn The theme will be introduced by Donatella Persico (Consiglio Nazionale Ricerche) - ENHANCING WORK PERFORMANCE: use TEPL to support human performance improvements and to provide links between business processes, competencies and learning processes The theme will be introduced by Volker Zimmermann (IMC...|$|E

Young people can and {{want to make a}} difference in society through their involvement in community projects. FESF has been working with Pakistani youth for over 12 years [...] and has built a strong network of capable and motivated young volunteers. Several years ago it became evident that training was needed to empower the participants to make a greater impact. Thus the MOVE program was created as an educational development course, focusing on soft skill training, leadership and volunteerism.Using creative media presentations, discussion forums, and interactive activities, the program seeks to instill in young people a sense of civic responsibility and concern for those who are less privileged. The course provides them with the requisite knowledge and skills to become actively involved in community work, covering such topics as: how to make a difference; team building, communication and interpersonal skills, working with children, understanding people with disabilities, how to establish and achieve goals, planning a community project, overcoming obstacles, leadership skills, etc. - and culminates with the hands-on experience of planning and carrying out a project.MOVE is a six-session structured program, covering a wide variety of relevant <b>topics.</b> <b>Workshop</b> <b>topics</b> include: ...|$|R
