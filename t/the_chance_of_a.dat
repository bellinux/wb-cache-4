His debut for Hull was as a late substitute in a 2–0 victory against Brighton & Hove Albion on 20 August 2005.

5|$|Because males emerge {{earlier than}} females, the males compete for mating territories {{surrounding}} the nests {{in which the}} females are located. During a fight, the males risk damaging their wings or appendages by butting and grappling. Another defense technique is to grab another male and carry it high into the air, which {{is thought to be}} a demonstration of strength. As a general rule, the larger the male the more predominant he is in battles. Age influences the success in the defense and security of territory; the younger the wasp the greater <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> successful takeover of territory. Some small males even engage in non-territorial mating tactics, and delay their emergence so as to have a fairer chance of survival.|$|E
5|$|In the {{cultural}} sphere, {{there were some}} Mongol elements in Western medieval art, especially in Italy, of which most surviving examples are from the 14th century, after <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> military alliance had faded. These included the depiction of textiles from the Mongol Empire and Mongol script in various contexts, the latter often anachronistic. Imports of textiles had a considerable influence on Italian textile design. Mongol military costume is sometimes worn by soldiers, typically those acting against Christian figures, as in martyrdoms or Crucifixion scenes. These were perhaps copied from drawings made of Mongol envoys to Europe, or ones brought back from Outremer.|$|E

30|$|When {{working on}} a problem, humans can have an “eureka” moment when they glimpse the problem solution. An eureka moment {{typically}} occurs when people combine facts {{in a new way}} to solve a problem. Continuous education loads more facts into participants’ minds and may increase <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eureka moment. Technology can also increase <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eureka moment by explicitly managing the juxtaposition of facts presented to the solvers. More eyes on <b>a</b> problem increases <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> uncovering key insights, especially if technology presents the problems in new contexts. Because of this, technological solutions that continuously teach solvers new facts and combine those facts in new ways can improve <b>the</b> <b>chances</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> eureka moment. Technology may increase the odds of this, but insight only occurs in the human mind.|$|R
5|$|On December 3, 2004, Gray's team {{issued its}} first extended-range {{forecast}} for the 2005 season, predicting a slightly above-average season. Additionally, the team predicted a greatly increased {{chance of a}} major hurricane striking the East Coast of the United States and the Florida peninsula. Though the forecast predicted above-average activity, the level predicted was significantly less than the 2004 season. On April 1, 2005, after confirming that El Niño conditions would not develop, Gray and his team revised the December forecast upward, expecting 13 tropical storms instead of 11 and seven hurricanes instead of six. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> storm impacting the United States was raised slightly.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton's second-in-command—although {{this was}} not {{clarified}} until the expedition reached the Antarctic—was Jameson Boyd Adams, a Royal Naval Reserve lieutenant who had turned down <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> regular commission to join Shackleton. He would also act as the expedition's meteorologist. Nimrods captain was another naval reserve officer, Rupert England; 23-year-old John King Davis, who would later make his own reputation as an Antarctic captain, was appointed chief officer at the last moment. Aeneas Mackintosh, a merchant navy officer from the P shipping line, was originally second officer, but was later transferred to the shore party, being replaced as second officer by A. E. Harbord. Others in the shore party were the two surgeons, Alistair Mackay and Eric Marshall, Bernard Day the motor expert, and Sir Philip Brocklehurst, the subscribing member who had been taken on as assistant geologist.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, 13 May, the French were {{undone by}} their poor tactical deployment. They strung their armour {{out in a}} thin line between Hannut and Huy, leaving no defence in depth, which {{was the point of}} sending the French armour to the Gembloux gap in the first place. This left Hoepner with a chance to mass against one of the French Light Divisions (the 3e DLM) and achieve a breakthrough in that sector. Moreover, with no reserves behind the front, the French denied themselves <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> counterattack. The victory saw the Panzer Corps out-manoeuvre the 2e DLM on its left flank. The Belgian III Corps, retreating from Liege, offered to support the French front held by the 3e DLM. This offer was rejected.|$|E

5|$|The {{top three}} {{began to spread}} out {{in the second half}} of the race, and by lap 54 Lewis Hamilton was leading Rosberg by 10.06 seconds, with Vettel a further 12.12 seconds behind Rosberg. However, due to Ferrari's earlier attempt to {{undercut}} Rosberg by pitting Vettel early, Räikkönen's tyres were 4 laps fresher than his teammate's, and he closed in on Vettel over the final stint. Having emerged from his final pit stop 4.84 seconds behind Vettel on lap 35, Räikkönen had closed the gap to 1.37 seconds by lap 54. However, <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> battle between the Ferrari teammates was extinguished after a transmission failure on Max Verstappen's Toro Rosso, who was stranded on the start/finish-straight, brought out the safety car for the final two laps, meaning that the race ended under safety car conditions.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{factors such}} as time spent outside and {{distance}} travelled by workers has been correlated to colony size. Workers living in smaller colonies tend to forage smaller distances and spend less time outside, whereas those in larger colonies spend more time outside and at greater distances from their nest. Such results have also {{been seen in the}} western honey bee (Apis mellifera), but, unlike the honey bees, workers from small and large colonies transported equal workloads. The decreased foraging time may reduce the risk of predation and save energy; for example, the limited energy in R.aurata is a result of time spent looking for food sources, rather than the collection of food items. The shorter foraging periods seen in smaller colonies results in these nests preserving energy and adopting behaviour that is less energetic. Group retrieval only occurs if a worker encounters another nestmate that is heavily loaded with resources. As these ants are solitary foragers and rarely recruit other nestmates, <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> worker encountering others is improved by marking the ground with trail pheromones. This behaviour may serve as a simple method of localised chemical recruitment of other nestmates. Marking behaviour increases when workers encounter large prey items, which suggests that foragers with heavy loads deliberately try to raise the encounter rate with nestmates. However, when workers are transporting small to large crickets, marking behaviour decreases to ensure transport efficiency and lower the retrieval time for other ants. Workers can quickly readjust their foraging activity in accordance with food quality.|$|E

25|$|Higher male {{secondary}} school enrollment, {{per capita income}} and economic growth rate all had significant effects on reducing the chance of civil war. Specifically, a male {{secondary school}} enrollment 10% above the average reduced <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> conflict by about 3%, while a growth rate 1% higher than the study average resulted in a decline in <b>the</b> <b>chance</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> civil war of about 1%. The study interpreted these three factors as proxies for earnings forgone by rebellion, and therefore that lower forgone earnings encourage rebellion. Phrased another way: young males (who make up {{the vast majority of}} combatants in civil wars) are less likely to join a rebellion if they are getting an education or have a comfortable salary, and can reasonably assume that they will prosper in the future.|$|E
