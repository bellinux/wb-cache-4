5|$|In September 1980, in the {{aftermath}} of the labor agreements, First Secretary Gierek was removed from office and replaced as party leader by Stanisław Kania. Kania made promises of the sort that Gomułka and Gierek had made when each came power. But whatever goodwill the new leader gained, it lasted for an even shorter period than it had been the case in 1956 and 1971, because there was no way <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> could have kept the promises it had made at Gdańsk, even if it wanted to. The authorities were still trapped by the contradiction: if they followed economic necessity, they would generate political instability. GNP fell in 1979 by 2%, in 1980 by 8% and in 1981 by 15–20%.|$|E
5|$|The Interior Ministry {{estimated}} {{there were}} 750,000 Mischlinge as of April 1935 (studies done {{after the war}} put the number of Mischlinge at around 200,000). As Jews {{became more and more}} excluded from German society, they organised social events, schools, and activities of their own. Economic problems were not so easily solved, however; many Jewish firms went out of business due to lack of customers. This was part of the ongoing Aryanization process (the transfer of Jewish firms to non-Jewish owners, usually at prices far below market value) <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> had initiated in 1933, which intensified after the Nuremberg Laws were passed. Former middle-class or wealthy business owners were forced to take employment in menial jobs to support their families, and many were unable to find work at all.|$|E
5|$|When {{news of the}} RPF {{offensive}} broke, Habyarimana requested {{assistance from}} France in fighting the invasion. The French president's son, Jean-Christophe Mitterrand, {{was head of the}} government's Africa Cell, and promised to send troops. On the night of 4 October, the Rwandan government staged a fake RPF attack on Kigali with gunfire and explosions around the city, seeking to convince the French <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> was in imminent danger. The deception worked, and 600 French soldiers arrived in Rwanda the following day, double the number initially pledged. The French operation was code-named Noroît, and its official purpose was to protect French nationals. In reality, the mission was to support Habyarimana's regime, and the French parachute companies immediately set up positions blocking the RPF advance to the capital and Kigali International Airport. In addition to the French, Belgium and Zaire sent troops to Kigali in early October. The Belgian presence was short-lived, its troops withdrawing within two weeks because of laws preventing the army from intervening in a civil war. Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko's contribution was to send several hundred troops of the elite Special Presidential Division (DSP). Unlike the French, the Zairian troops went straight to the front line and began fighting the RPF, but their discipline was poor. The Zairian soldiers raped Rwandan civilians in the north of the country and looted their homes, prompting Habyarimana to expel them back to Zaire within a week of their arrival.|$|E

25|$|Other {{writers have}} {{advanced}} {{a number of}} additional or alternative explanations for the Babylonian defeat. M. A.

25|$|Many in Burma {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> {{would have}} collapsed had the United Nations and neighbouring countries refused recognition to the coup. Western governments and Japan cut {{aid to the}} country. Among Burma's neighbours, India was most critical; condemning the suppression, closing borders and setting up refugee camps along its border with Burma. By 1989, 6,000 NLD supporters were detained in custody and those who fled to the ethnic border areas, such as Kawthoolei, formed groups with those who wished for greater self-determination. It was estimated 10,000 had fled to mountains controlled by ethnic insurgents such as the Karen National Liberation Army, and many later trained to become soldiers.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2011, Amnesty International criticized [...] "Western media coverage" [...] which [...] "has {{from the}} outset {{presented}} a very one-sided view of the logic of events, portraying the protest movement as entirely peaceful and repeatedly suggesting <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime's</b> security forces were unaccountably massacring unarmed demonstrators who presented no security challenge." ...|$|R

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Kérékou's move to Marxism-Leninism was motivated mainly by pragmatic considerations, and that Kérékou himself was not actually a leftist radical; the new ideology offered a means of legitimization, a way of distinguishing the new regime from those that had preceded it, and was based on broader unifying principles than the politics of ethnicity. Kérékou's regime initially included officers from both the north and south of the country, but as the years passed the northerners (like Kérékou himself) became clearly dominant, undermining the idea <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> was not based in ethnicity. By officially adopting Marxism-Leninism, Kérékou may also have wanted to win the support of the country's leftists.|$|E
25|$|Raeder {{claimed in}} his 1957 memoirs Mein Leben {{that he had}} first learned <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> in which he served so long was a {{criminal}} regime in March 1945 when he visited his old colleague, the former Defence Minister Otto Gessler in a hospital when he was recovering from the torture he received in a concentration camp. Shocked at Gessler's appearance, Raeder decided to protest against the Nazi regime by not wearing the Nazi Golden Party Badge that he had worn until then. The British historian Sir John Wheeler-Bennett mocked Raeder for taking until March 1945 {{to discover that the}} Nazi regime was a criminal regime, and called his protest via not wearing his Golden Party Badge pathetic.|$|E
25|$|Under {{leadership}} of José María Valiente and with consent of Don Javier, the collegial Carlist executive commenced cautious {{collaboration with the}} regime. It is not entirely clear how this major change of policy was related to appearance of prince Hugues. According to one theory, the young entourage decided to introduce him banking on a new strategy and posing to present an offer to Franco. According to another, with new long-term perspectives related to his son opening, Don Javier changed course hoping <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> might one day crown the young prince. One more reading {{has it that the}} changing political course and the introduction of Hugues coincided as results of two independent processes. One way or another, starting 1957 Don Javier was gradually permitting his son to assume more and more roles within Carlism.|$|E

25|$|With the {{tightening}} of the Ceaușescu regime's control on {{media and the}} literary environment, coupled with the ideological recuperation of national communism and isolationism (the July Theses), Ornea joined the intellectual faction attempting to circumvent censorship and promote a more nuanced take on cultural history. Ornea bowed down to the requirements {{in at least one}} instance: his Lovinescu edition was published without some portions of text <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> found unpalatable, and the introductory note purported that Lovinescu had points in common with historical materialism. According to historian Lucian Boia, the method was objectionable, but also the only way in which the book could see print. Communist censorship also intervened in Ornea's work as anthologist: as researcher Victor Durnea notes, his Constantin Stere edition only covered the early portion of Stere's career, detailing his loose affiliation with the socialist movement.|$|E
25|$|The United States' {{opposition}} to Castro {{was based on}} the U.S. government's estimation that coercion inside Cuba was severe and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> was serving as a spearhead for allied communist movements elsewhere in the Americas. Following the failure of the Bay of Pigs Invasion in April 1961, Robert Kennedy and Richard Goodwin suggested to President Kennedy that the U.S. government begin a sustained campaign of intelligence and covert action against the communist regime in Cuba. They believed that a centralized effort led by senior officials from the White House and other government agencies to remove Fidel Castro and overthrow the Cuban regime was the best course of action. Following a meeting in the White House on November 3, 1961, this initiative became known as Operation Mongoose and would be led by Air Force Brigadier General Edward Lansdale.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1950s Don Javier firmly {{abandoned}} any thought of reconciliation with the Alfonsinos and instructed harsh measures versus those who approached them; however, he remained respectful towards Don Juan and avoided open challenge, still falling short of explicitly claiming the title. He supported Valiente – his position gradually reinforced formally {{up to new}} Jefe Delegado in 1958-1960 - in attempts to eradicate internal focos of rebellion against collaboration and to combat new openly secessionist anti-collaborative groups. Though 20 years earlier he expelled from the Comunión those who had accepted seats in the Francoist structures, {{at the turn of}} the decades Don Javier viewed the appointment of 5 Carlists to the Cortes as success of the collaborationist policy, especially <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> permitted new Carlist legal outposts and the movement seemed visibly reinvigorated, now openly present in the public discourse.|$|E

25|$|The various dissidents {{formed a}} pro-Thi, anti-Kỳ {{organization}} called the Military-Civilian Struggle Committee, {{better known as the}} Struggle Movement. Their message and influence quickly spread. Some of them took over the government radio station in Da Nang and made anti-junta broadcasts, and they were joined by university students. Initially this dissident soapboxing was not treated with much alarm and it was thought <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> had decided to wait for the protests to peter out instead of risking an escalation by trying to suppress it. The administrator at Da Nang's radio station allowed the Thi supporters to make a broadcaster when only ten student protesters turned up, a minuscule amount of popular pressure. The opposition groups were not well organized at this time and seemed unsure of their objectives. They were also conducting themselves placidly at this point.|$|E
25|$|Hoveyda's plan {{to crack}} down on {{corruption}} became an example of the entrenched ineptitude of many in power. Many important members of the government were corrupt, and the Shah was consistently flattered and schmoozed by them and {{turned a blind eye to}} the problem. The Shah began receiving an increasingly distorted picture of Iranian society, while becoming completely blind to increasing frustration to this rule by regular Iranians, as well as the shortcomings of his own government. Hoveyda's inability to move forward with his personal mandate eventually turned the overtly optimistic prime minister into a cynic. After years of political maneuvering, most of his proposed initiatives were stonewalled by bureaucratic obstacles. During the 1970s, the now veteran Prime Minister became nonchalant when it came to following through with his own convictions. His earlier aggression towards the dysfunctions of an obtrusive system slowly turned into feigned support. Publicly, Hoveyda assumed the notion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> in its current state would eventually reform on its own, and that political liberalization was only a small issue in the grand scheme of modernization. In private, Hoveyda often lamented over Iran's conditions, admitting to insufficiencies of the state and his own political impotence. The powerlessness of the premier's office was coupled with intricate internal rivalries. Hoveyda had an intensely rough relationship with the likes of Asadollah Alam and Ardeshir Zahedi, son of the famed participant in the 1953 coup against Mossadegh, General Fazlollah Zahedi.|$|E

500|$|The {{sentence}} was sharply criticized by rights groups. Forty three rights groups signed a joint appeal to release Rajab. Brian Dooley of Human Rights First found the verdict shocking even by Bahrain's [...] "abysmal" [...] standards on human rights. He added <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> {{could not be}} seen as serious about human rights reform when it jailed one of the world's most prominent activists to prison for three years. Referring to a [...] "dark day for justice" [...] in Bahrain, Amnesty International said that the use of such blatant ruthless tactics to suppress dissenting voices could leave the international community under no illusion that Bahrain was on the path of reform. Human Rights Watch argued that the government had yet to show that Rajab had done any more than exercise his right to free expression and peaceful assembly and demanded his release.|$|E
500|$|Clarke {{stated that}} {{intelligence}} linked bin Laden to Al-Shifa's {{current and past}} operators, namely Iraqi nerve gas experts such as Emad al-Ani and Sudan's ruling National Islamic Front. Since 1995, the CIA had received intelligence suggesting collaboration between Sudan and bin Laden to produce chemical weapons for attacking American military personnel based in Saudi Arabia. Since 1989, the Sudanese opposition and Uganda had alleged <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> was manufacturing and using chemical weapons, although the U.S. did not accuse Sudan of chemical weapons proliferation. Al-Qaeda defector Jamal al-Fadl had also spoken of bin Laden's desire to obtain weapons of mass destruction, and an August 4 CIA intelligence report suggested bin Laden [...] "had already acquired chemical weapons and might be ready to attack". Cohen later testified that physical evidence, technical and human intelligence, and the site's security and purported links to bin Laden backed the intelligence community's view that the Al-Shifa plant was producing chemical weapons and associated with terrorists.|$|E
500|$|Following Taraki's {{fall from}} power, Amin was elected Chairman of the Presidum of the Revolutionary Council and General Secretary of the PDPA Central Committee by the PDPA Politburo. The {{election}} of Amin as PDPA General Secretary and {{the removal of}} Taraki from all party posts was unanimous. The only members of the cabinet replaced when Amin took power were the Gang of Four – Beverley Male saw this as [...] "a clear indication that he had their [...] support". Amin's rise to power was followed by a policy of moderation, and attempts to persuade the Afghan people <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>regime</b> was not anti-Islamic. Amin's government began to invest in the reconstruction, or reparation, of mosques. He also promised the Afghan people freedom of religion. Religious groups were given copies of the Quran, and Amin began to refer to Allah in speeches. He even claimed that the Saur Revolution was [...] "totally based on the principles of Islam". The campaign proved to be unsuccessful, and many Afghans held Amin responsible for the regime's totalitarian behavior. Amin's rise to power was officially endorsed by the Jamiatul Ulama on 20 September 1979. Their endorsement led to the official announcement that Amin was a pious Muslim – Amin thus scored a point against the counter-revolutionary propaganda which claimed the communist regime was atheist. Amin also tried to increase his popularity with tribal groups, a feat Taraki had been unable or unwilling to achieve. In a speech to tribal elders Amin was defensive about the Western way he dressed; an official biography was published which depicted Amin in traditional Pashtun clothes. During his short stay in power, Amin became committed to establishing a collective leadership; when Taraki was ousted, Amin promised [...] "from now on there will be no one-man government..." ...|$|E
