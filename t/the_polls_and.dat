5|$|In Week 9, after {{defeating}} Wake Forest {{to improve}} to a 6–1 record, Maryland was ranked 25th {{by both the}} Associated Press and the Coaches' Polls. It {{was the first time}} the team was ranked since Week 11 in 2006. Maryland would rise in <b>the</b> <b>polls,</b> <b>and</b> enter the Harris and BCS rankings after beating NC State the following week. However, after the loss to Virginia Tech, the Terps fell out of the rankings altogether. Maryland made one final poll appearance after the win over North Carolina, before losing to Florida State.|$|E
5|$|Brown is {{a member}} of the Republican Party, and faced the Democratic candidate, Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley in the 2010 special election, which had {{occurred}} after the 2009 death of long-time Senator Ted Kennedy for the remainder of Kennedy's term ending January 3, 2013. While initially trailing Coakley in polling by a large margin, Brown saw a sudden late surge in <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>and</b> posted a surprise win to become the first Republican elected to the U.S. Senate from Massachusetts since Edward Brooke in 1972. Brown ran for a full Senate term in 2012, but lost to Democratic challenger Elizabeth Warren. He subsequently joined the board of directors of Kadant paper company, joined Fox News as a commentator, and joined Nixon Peabody where he provided legal services.|$|E
5|$|North Carolina rose to No. 7 in the {{national}} college football polls, and the victory over Indiana was followed the next week by a 2817 win over No. 17 Stanford University. The two season-opening wins were followed by six more in succession. The Tar Heels beat Maryland, 4014, on September 20, and Virginia on September 27 by a score of 4820. Prior to the win against Virginia, North Carolina, rose from No. 7 to No. 5 in <b>the</b> <b>polls,</b> <b>and</b> remained at that level after the win. Texas Christian University fell 3110 to the Tar Heels on October 4, and Wake Forest lost to North Carolina, 3012, on October 11. After a week of inactivity, in which the Tar Heels rose to No. 4, North Carolina defeated in-state rival NC State by a score of 207, and after another week and a half, the Tar Heels beat Georgia Tech narrowly, 1613, in a Thursday night game.|$|E

5|$|On September 7, 1874, the new {{constitution}} was completed and signed {{by a majority of}} delegates. The entire electorate, including the disenfranchised Confederates and the Freedmen, voted. The election not only was for ratification of the {{new constitution}} but also for state officials that would be elected if the constitution was indeed ratified. The Republicans actually took the same position that the Democrats had taken earlier, believing that the election was illegal they nominated no candidates. Conservative Democrats and allied paramilitary groups suppressed black voting, using a combination of intimidation, blocking blacks from <b>the</b> <b>polls,</b> <b>and</b> outright assassinations. The new constitution was ratified on October 13, 1874 and Democratic officials elected almost unanimously, including new Democratic Governor Augustus H. Garland who was inaugurated November 12, 1874, and Baxter left office after only serving two years of a four-year term.|$|E
5|$|Field's {{government}} {{was startled by}} Britain's announcement in October 1963 that Nyasaland would become fully independent on 6 July 1964. While no date was set for Northern Rhodesian statehood, it was generally surmised {{that it was going}} to follow shortly thereafter. Smith was promptly sent to London, where he held a round of inconclusive Southern Rhodesian independence talks with the new British Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas-Home. Around the same time, the presence and significance of Section 111 of the 1961 constitution emerged in Southern Rhodesia, prompting speculation in political circles that a future British government might, if it were so inclined, go against previous conventions by legislating for Salisbury without its consent, withdrawing devolved powers or otherwise altering the Southern Rhodesian constitution. Fearing what the Labour Party might do if it won the next British general election (which was projected for late 1964), the Southern Rhodesians stepped up their efforts, hoping to win independence before Britain went to <b>the</b> <b>polls,</b> <b>and</b> preferably not after Nyasaland. The Federation dissolved as scheduled at the end of 1963.|$|E
5|$|The {{victory over}} USC began a winning streak, {{the best in}} Stanford {{football}} history {{since the time of}} the Korean War. The week after beating USC, Stanford defeated Washington State, moving to a 6–1 record {{for the first time since}} 1970. The Cardinal rose to No. 13 nationally and defeated the University of Washington on October 30. Against No. 15 Arizona, Stanford matched its previous season's win total. On November 13, Stanford defeated Arizona State in a closely fought 17–13 win that brought the Cardinal football team to 9–1 and its best record since 1951. The following week, Stanford beat traditional rival California in The Big Game by a 48–14 score. It was the largest margin of victory in the rivalry since 1930. Stanford's final regular-season game was against the Oregon State Beavers, and Stanford won the contest convincingly, 38–0. The No. 4 and No. 5 nationally ranked teams had lost earlier the same day, lifting Stanford in <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>and</b> in position for a Bowl Championship Series game berth.|$|E

25|$|Within Serbia, {{there was}} much popular rejoicing over the {{assassination}} of Franz Ferdinand. Because Serbian elections were scheduled for 14 August, Prime Minister Nikola Pašić was unwilling to court unpopularity by being seen to bow down to Austria.

25|$|In the United States, some Californian cities, e.g. Oakland and San Francisco, {{administer}} IRV {{elections on}} voting machines, with optical scanning machines recording preferences and software tallying the IRV algorithm {{as soon as}} ballots are tallied.

25|$|Santorum {{spent months}} in Iowa, {{traveling}} to all 99 counties and holding some 381 {{town hall meetings}} {{over the course of}} the campaign. However, for months Santorum lagged in <b>the</b> <b>polls</b> <b>and</b> had difficulty raising money, traveling around the state in a pickup truck instead of buses and caravans used by other candidates. He lagged in the so-called second tier of candidates, polling in the single digits in Iowa as late as December 18.

Until the Lok Sabha elections of 1996, Sharad Pawar served as the Leader of the Opposition in the state assembly. In the 1996 General elections, Pawar won the Baramati seat in the Lok Sabha and left the state assembly.|$|E

25|$|Cooper's {{thirteen}} years as Buckeye head coach are largely remembered in {{the litany of}} negative statistics associated with him: a notorious 2–10–1 record against Michigan, a 3–8 record in bowl games, a 5-year losing streak to Illinois to start his term and a 6-7 record overall, and blowing a 15-point 3rd quarter lead in a 28–24 loss to unranked Michigan State when the Buckeyes were the top-ranked team {{in the nation and}} en route to a national championship. However his record also has many positives: back-to-back victories over Notre Dame, two finishes second-ranked in <b>the</b> <b>polls,</b> <b>and</b> three Big Ten championships (albeit shared).
