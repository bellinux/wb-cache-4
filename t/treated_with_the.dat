5|$|Critics {{have complained}} that, by museum {{display of the}} remains, the body of Lindow Man has been {{objectified}} rather than <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> respect due the dead. Emma Restall Orr, a neo-druid, has questioned whether the body should be displayed at all.

5|$|The M3 subtype of AML, {{also known}} as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), is almost universally <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> drug all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) in {{addition}} to induction chemotherapy, usually an anthracycline. Care {{must be taken to}} prevent disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), complicating the treatment of APL when the promyelocytes release the contents of their granules into the peripheral circulation. APL is eminently curable, with well-documented treatment protocols.|$|E
5|$|After {{an episode}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy, 80% of people develop hypopituitarism and require some form of hormone replacement therapy. The most common problem is growth hormone deficiency, which is often left untreated but may cause decreased muscle mass and strength, obesity and fatigue. 60–80% require hydrocortisone replacement (either permanently or when unwell), 50–60% need thyroid hormone replacement, and 60–80% of men require testosterone supplements. Finally, 10–25% develop diabetes insipidus, the inability to retain fluid in the kidneys {{due to a lack}} of the pituitary antidiuretic hormone. This may be <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> drug desmopressin, which can be applied as a nose spray or taken by mouth.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{there have}} been a few unorthodox (unusual) causes of solar urticaria. For those {{susceptible}} to visible light, white T-shirts may increase the chances of experiencing an outbreak. In one case, doctors found that the white T-shirt absorbed UVA radiation from the sun and transformed it into visible light which caused the reaction. Another patient was being <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> antibiotic tetracycline for a separate dermatological disorder and broke out in hives when exposed to the sun, the first case to implicate tetracycline as a solar urticaria inducing agent.|$|E

However the description does not <b>treat</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> polarization concept. The paper is aimed to introduce quantum description of an arbitrary oriented retarder and give a description of a beam splitter which <b>treats</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> polarization...|$|R
5|$|Elephant endotheliotropic {{herpesvirus}}es (EEHV) or Elephantid herpesvirus 1' {{is a type}} of herpesvirus, {{which can}} cause a highly fatal hemorrhagic disease when transmitted to young Asian elephants. In African elephants, related forms of these viruses, which have been identified in wild populations, are generally benign, occasionally surfacing to cause small growths or lesions. However, some types of EEHV can cause a highly fatal disease in Asian elephants, which kills up to 80% of severely affected individuals. The disease can be <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rapid application of antiviral drugs, but this has only been effective in around a third of cases.|$|E
5|$|Hospital {{assessment}} is recommended if simple pain relief does not resolve local pain, or systemic symptoms occur. Opioid analgesics {{may be necessary}} to relieve pain. Antivenom has been historically given for adults suffering severe local pain or systemic symptoms consistent with latrodectism, which include pain and swelling spreading proximally from site, distressing local or systemic pain, chest pain, abdominal pain, or excessive sweating (diaphoresis). A significant proportion of bites will not result in envenomation or any symptoms developing; around 2–20% of bite victims have been treated with antivenom. In an Australian study of 750 emergency hospital admissions for spider bites where the spider was definitively identified, 56 were from redbacks. Of these, 37 had significant pain lasting over 24 hours. Only six were <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> antivenom.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, Stainer {{was offered}} the post of Inspector of Music in Schools and Colleges, a {{position}} he took with great seriousness and which he occupied for six years. He worked towards raising standards in music teaching and toured the country, visiting schools and colleges and examining candidates. He advocated the use of musical notation and tonic sol-fa rather than the learning-by-ear method previously used. He was by now <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> greatest respect in musical circles, but his many activities diminished the time available for composition. The flow of new anthems and service music slowed down, but in 1883 he completed his oratorio Mary Magdalen. This was followed in 1887 by The Crucifixion, the work {{for which he is}} most remembered.|$|E

5|$|Several other laws {{govern the}} use of the state flag. The flag is {{required}} to be flown by all state militias and the Indiana National Guard. It is to be on display at the Indiana Statehouse at all times. The flag must also be displayed at any agency that is funded in part or in full by the state government, including public schools, state universities, and state parks. In all other respects the flag should be <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same care and respect as the flag of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Smallpox {{vaccination}} {{within three}} days of exposure will prevent or significantly lessen the severity of smallpox symptoms {{in the vast majority}} of people. Vaccination four to seven days after exposure can offer some protection from disease or may modify the severity of disease. Other than vaccination, treatment of smallpox is primarily supportive, such as wound care and infection control, fluid therapy, and possible ventilator assistance. Flat and hemorrhagic types of smallpox are <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> same therapies used to treat shock, such as fluid resuscitation. People with semi-confluent and confluent types of smallpox may have therapeutic issues similar to patients with extensive skin burns.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difference}} between older and newer studies {{is that the}} type of patients <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ketogenic diet has changed over time. When first developed and used, the ketogenic diet was not a treatment of last resort; in contrast, the children in modern studies have already tried and failed a number of anticonvulsant drugs, so may be assumed to have more difficult-to-treat epilepsy. Early and modern studies also differ because the treatment protocol has changed. In older protocols, the diet was initiated with a prolonged fast, designed to lose 5–10% body weight, and heavily restricted the calorie intake. Concerns over child health and growth led to a relaxation of the diet's restrictions. Fluid restriction was once a feature of the diet, but this led to increased risk of constipation and kidney stones, and is no longer considered beneficial.|$|E

5|$|Carr Hill House was {{the largest}} estate in the village; a {{freehold}} mansion house on Carr Hill Lane. The date of building is unknown, {{but it does not}} appear on an enclosure map of 1766, suggesting it was built after that date. There is strong evidence that it was once a lunatic asylum; in 1770 an advertisement in a local newspaper declared:LUNATICKSCarr's Hill House on Gateshead Fell To The Public We beg Leave to inform the Public that we have opened the above HOUSE pleasantly situated about a mile distant from Newcastle, which we have fitted up in an elegant manner, with every Accommodation for the reception of LUNATICKS in genteel or opulent circumstances: in this House Persons entrusted to our Care shall be <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> utmost Attention and Humanity.

5|$|Olivia worries it {{will happen}} again, and though she {{attempts}} to ward off sleep, she next dreams that she helps a woman murder her husband at a restaurant. They interview the wife, who tells them she became so convinced her husband {{was going to leave}} her that she became angry and stabbed him. The team posits that while no one is actually causing the incidents, they are happening as Olivia has seen them. At the restaurant, the owner tells them a blond man with a scar named Nick Lane (David Call) was sitting in the same place as Olivia was in her dream, and was also seen in the video surveillance from the first crime scene. Walter posits that because she never sees him in her dreams, it was Lane, not Olivia, causing the people's deaths. Olivia and Peter interview doctors at St. Jude's Mental Hospital, who tell them Lane was a voluntary resident, but left after the visit of a mysterious man. The doctor described him as hyperemotive, meaning those near him adopt his emotions. Olivia and Peter soon learn that as a child, Lane was <b>treated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> nootropic drug Cortexiphan in drug trials, and believes himself to be a recruit in the upcoming war between the two universes.|$|E
