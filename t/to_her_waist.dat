5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the video, soil crumbles down, as Björk appears, buried <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> in the sand, wearing a golden dress (by Michael van der Ham), a brooch on her shoulder designed by the singer herself and a blue wig, holding a rock. As she starts singing, she divides the rock into two pieces. As she waves the pieces, the sand around her stirs. She then lays the two pieces on the sand, and they become part of two rock sprites, that come out of the sand and start writhing around Björk, while strata emerges from them. In {{the end of the first}} verse, the strata of the two rocky sprites try to unite, as Björk grabs the sand and let it slips out from her fingers. During the second verse other rocks emerge from the sand and revolve around Björk, who dances in the sand. Other rocky sprites spring out of the new rocks and link to the main two, which are still spinning around the singer's head. The two parts are irresistibly attracted to each other and try to unite as they are stroked by Björk. The strata of the rocks morph to form a face, similar to that of the singer. As the chorus begins, Björk disappears in the darkness. The two rocky parts, now united, start to bestir themselves, whilst various rocks on the sand start to erupt. Lava, magma, smoke and fire storm while Björk's face appears in the lava. Every rock erupts noisily, causing a rain of volcanic ash.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} year there, they made friends with the 32 {{students}} who attended l'Academie des Beaux-Arts, located {{at the end of}} their street. The students invited Harry and Polly to their annual Quartre Arts Ball, an invitation the couple embraced with enthusiasm. Harry fashioned a necklace of four dead pigeons, sported a red loincloth, and brought along a bag of snakes. Caresse wore a sheer chemise <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> a huge turquoise wig on her head, and nothing else. They both dyed their skin with red ochre. The students cheered Caresse's toplessness, and she was carried around on the shoulders of 10 students.|$|E
25|$|A second {{explosion}} at the Park Kultury station followed at approximately 8:38am, caused by another female, {{who at the}} time of the first explosion was riding another train from Yugo-Zapadnaya towards Ulitsa Podbelskogo station in the same direction as the first train. At the time of first explosion, the second train had stopped in the tunnel between Frunzenskaya and Park Kultury stations. It was announced over the speakers that due to technical problems, the train would have to unload the passengers at the next stop. About 40 minutes later, the train reached the station, and once its doors opened, the second female suspect detonated the second explosion, killing fourteen commuters. Panic included stampedes at both stations, as commuters attempted to escape. The second attack was carried out by a dark-haired woman with the equivalent of 2kg of TNT strapped <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b> Both bombs were packed with metal nuts, bolts and screws, to increase the destructive impact of the blasts.|$|E
60|$|He {{laid down}} his pipe. That {{was a good}} sign, surely? He drew his chair nearer <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Better and better! His arm was long enough, in the new position, <b>to</b> reach <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b> <b>Her</b> <b>waist</b> was ready for him.|$|R

5000|$|On May 9, 2016, a {{music video}} was released, but was later removed that day due to unapproved photo {{manipulation}} of Trainor's body <b>to</b> make <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> look slimmer. On Snapchat, Trainor later said [...] "I didn't approve that video {{and it went}} out for the world, so I'm embarrassed." [...] A video without photo manipulation was released on May 10.|$|R
500|$|The body, {{dressed in}} a black sweater and yellow skirt, was soon {{identified}} as the missing Patricia Jones. Jones had been hit with four shots from a [...]22 caliber pistol. Although the fatal wound was a shot to Jones's head, entering near her mouth on an upward trajectory, she also had one through and through bullet wound to her abdomen and two penetrating gunshot wounds to her shoulders on a downward trajectory through her body. Powder burns on the hemline of her skirt, which had been raised <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> indicated that the gun had been fired from close range at least once. Initial reports and investigation placed Jones's time of death at approximately 9 p.m. on May 27.|$|E
500|$|Omayra Sánchez {{lived in}} the {{neighborhood}} of Santander with her parents Álvaro Enrique, a rice and sorghum collector, and María Aleida, along with her brother Álvaro Enrique and aunt María Adela Garzón. [...] Prior to the eruption, her mother had traveled to Bogotá on business. The night of the disaster, Omayra and her family were awake, worrying about the ashfall from the eruption, when they heard the sound of an approaching lahar. After it hit, Omayra became trapped under her home's concrete and other debris and could not free herself. When rescue teams tried to help her, they realized that her legs were trapped under her house's roof. Sources differ as to the degree to which Sánchez was trapped. Zeiderman (2009) said she was [...] "trapped up to her neck", while Barragán (1987) said that she was trapped up <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b>|$|E
500|$|In January 1955 Mansfield {{appeared}} at a Silver Springs, Florida, press junket promoting the film Underwater!, starring Jane Russell. Mansfield purposely wore a too-small red bikini, lent {{to her by}} photographer friend Peter Gowland. When she dove into the pool for photographers, her top came off, creating a burst of media attention. The ensuing publicity led to Warner Bros. and Playboy approaching her with offers. In June 8 of the same year, her dress fell down <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> twice in a single evening—once at a movie party, and later at a nightclub. In February 1958, she was stripped to the waist at a Mardi Gras party in Rio de Janeiro. In June 1962, she shimmied out of her polka-dot dress in a Rome nightclub. In the three years since making her Broadway debut in [...] Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?, Mansfield had become the most controversial star of the decade.|$|E
60|$|With {{streaming}} {{eyes and}} hesitating steps he was proceeding along the vestibule, {{when he heard}} his name called by a low sweet voice. He looked around; it was Venetia. Never had he beheld such a beautiful vision. She was muffled up in her dressing-gown, her small white feet only guarded from the cold by her slippers. Her golden hair seemed <b>to</b> reach <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> <b>her</b> cheek was flushed, her large blue eyes glittered with tears.|$|R
5000|$|Tacitus and Cassius Dio {{agree that}} Boudica was of royal descent. Dio {{describes}} her as [...] "possessed of greater intelligence than often belongs to women." [...] He also describes her as tall, with tawny hair hanging down <b>to</b> below <b>her</b> <b>waist,</b> a harsh {{voice and a}} piercing glare. He notes that she habitually wore a large golden necklace (perhaps a torc), a colourful tunic, and a thick cloak fastened by a brooch.|$|R
60|$|She {{collected}} the things {{together on a}} tea tray of enormous size, and holding it tightly pressed <b>to</b> <b>her</b> small <b>waist,</b> watched with anxious eyes as the heavy articles slowly tobogganed to the other end. A knife fell outside the door, and the loaf, after a moment’s hesitation which nearly upset the tray, jumped over the edge and bounded downstairs.|$|R
500|$|Keable {{remained}} in Tahiti, his health worsening. He suffered weight loss, diabetes, {{high blood pressure}} and fever, all stemming from a kidney illness. Nonetheless, he completed the novel Numerous Treasure, which he had begun before Buck's death; the bittersweet tale of a Polynesian woman who shared her name with a cocktail and a brand of cigarettes was a commercial success, and has been considered a valuable portrait of early-century Tahitian life. His health and spirits rallied in the years after Buck's death: he completed a travel book, Tahiti, Isle of Dreams, and a book tour of the United States and Europe. On returning to Tahiti he struck up a relationship with a mixed-race islander named Ina, and made many new friends including the writers Alec Waugh (elder brother of Evelyn), who had been inspired to visit Tahiti by Numerous Treasure, Zane Grey, and James Norman Hall. Waugh described the Keable of this period [...] "reclined among cushions, clad only in a pareo, while his Tahitian princess, bare-shouldered and bare-footed, her black hair falling <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> and a white flower behind her ear, glided negligently about the house" [...] – and yet noted that, on suggesting a cup of tea, Keable's voice still took on [...] "the parsonical intonation with which fifteen years earlier he had summoned the parish children to a Sunday school treat." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{medieval times}} {{until the early}} 18th century, ducking was a way used to {{establish}} whether a suspect was a witch. The ducking stools were first {{used for this purpose}} but ducking was later inflicted without the chair. In this instance the victim's right thumb was bound to her left big toe. A rope was attached <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> and the [...] "witch" [...] was thrown into a river or deep pond. If the [...] "witch" [...] floated it was deemed that she was in league with the devil, rejecting the [...] "baptismal water". If the [...] "witch" [...] sank she was deemed innocent.|$|E
2500|$|History is an {{approximately}} 9-foot tall (274.32cm) {{statue of}} a female figure draped in Hellenistic robes, holding a feathered quill in her proper right hand and an open book cradled {{in the crook of}} her proper left arm. She wears a floor-length tunic with a wide, slightly pleated neckline underneath a loosely draped mantle which is approximately a foot shorter than the tunic itself. The mantle is draped over her proper left shoulder, encircles her body about the proper right hip, and is gathered at her proper left waist. Her proper right sleeve is rolled halfway up her arm above the elbow, and her proper right arm is crossed in front of her body, horizontal <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b> She holds a feathered quill delicately in her proper right hand, and little finger of which is curled and raised slightly. The little finger of her proper left hand, which holds the open book, is also curled slightly, adding a sense of delicacy to her pose. Some of the pages of the book have been delineated from one another, in order to give it a more realistic appearance. Her hair is pulled back into a braid, and wound around itself several times, creating a thick bun. Her features have an idealized cast to them, and her eyes are lowered, gazing at the pages of the book in her proper left hand. The sculpture's proper right foot is raised slightly at the heel, and she stands with the majority of her weight on her proper left foot. This sculpture, like the other seven, is carved from Italian Carrara marble, and sits upon a cement pedestal. Approximately three feet below the base of the statue is a black plaque, upon which is the word [...] "HISTORY" [...] in gold lettering.|$|E
50|$|There {{has been}} scepticism of Lukyanova. ABC News {{suggested}} that Lukyanova was a hoax aided by image editing software. Diane Levin regarded Lukyanova {{as an example}} of the negative effects of media objectification. To counter the image editing accusations, Lukyanova posted videos on YouTube and appeared on Russia-1 and Channel One Russia TV channels. Lukyanova admitted to having breast augmentation but no other plastic surgery, and denies that she had ribs removed <b>to</b> make <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> smaller. Lukyanova blamed people unconnected <b>to</b> <b>her</b> for altering photos of her younger self in a malicious attempt to infer she had received body modifications.|$|R

This includes 16 breast augmentations.|$|R
60|$|A larger {{table was}} covered with needle-work, shreds of lining, scissors, tapes, and Ellen's red work-box; and she herself sat beside it, a very nice-looking girl of about seventeen, tall and slim, her lilac dress and white collar fitting beautifully, her black apron sitting nicely <b>to</b> <b>her</b> trim <b>waist,</b> and <b>her</b> light hair shining, like the newly-wound silk of the silk-worm, round her {{pleasant}} face; where the large, clear, well-opened blue eyes, and the contrast of white and red on the cheek, were a good deal like poor Alfred's, and gave an air of delicacy.|$|R

60|$|She took {{possession}} of the keys soon after this, and went jingling about {{the house with the}} whole bunch in a little basket, tied <b>to</b> <b>her</b> slender <b>waist.</b> I seldom found that the places to which they belonged were locked, or that they were of any use except as a plaything for Jip--but Dora was pleased, and that pleased me. She was quite satisfied that a good deal was effected by this make-belief of housekeeping; and was as merry as if we had been keeping a baby-house, for a joke.|$|R
5000|$|A spider-like sinner who {{sends out}} {{miniature}} spiders who latch onto the necks of her victims allowing <b>her</b> <b>to</b> control them like marionettes.

As a result, she forever lost the lower half of her body which are now replaced by metal legs much like a spider.|$|R
5000|$|She always laced tight, {{but never}} below 19 in till {{she married a}} year ago. Her husband then persuaded and bothered her into {{reducing}} her size. People little think of what pain she is suffering when they admire <b>her</b> trim <b>waist</b> and tapering figure; but she is pretty, and has a very pale, good complexion, and white soft hands and pretty feet, so her female vanity supports her. At 9 o'clock I lace her, after her bath, and a housemaid helps me <b>to</b> squeeze <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> well in. As I tighten the lace she looks very white, and her lips often twitch as we pull her in. She never lunches, and does not walk very much. At night she wears a softer stay with a 19 in waist, as she says it is more painful <b>to</b> allow <b>her</b> figure <b>to</b> expand completely, and then lace it up again, than to keep it always about the same size.|$|R
60|$|Jude {{had reached}} the window, which was quite a low one, so that she was visible down <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b> She let go the casement-stay {{and put her hand}} upon his, her moonlit face {{regarding}} him wistfully.|$|E

60|$|Hist and Hetty arose {{with the}} return of light, leaving Judith still buried in sleep. It took but a minute for the first <b>to</b> {{complete}} <b>her</b> toilet. Her long coal-black hair was soon adjusted in a simple knot, the calico dress belted tight <b>to</b> <b>her</b> slender <b>waist,</b> and <b>her</b> little feet concealed in their gaudily ornamented moccasins. When attired, she left her companion employed in household affairs, and went herself on the platform to breathe the pure air of the morning. Here she found Chingachgook studying the shores of the lake, the mountains and the heavens, with the sagacity of a man of the woods, and the gravity of an Indian.|$|R
5000|$|Louisa May Alcott devoted Chapter 18 ("Fashion and Physiology") of her 1875 {{young adult}} fiction, Eight Cousins, to advocating for dress {{reform in the}} form of the [...] "freedom suit," [...] which is {{described}} as being different from and more socially acceptable than bloomers. The young main character, Rose Campbell, is under the guardianship of her physician uncle Alec. However, her aunt Clara wishes Rose to dress appropriately <b>to</b> <b>her</b> position as an heiress, and one day gives her a fashionable outfit to try. Rose ultimately rejects it in favor of Alec's freedom suit, consisting of close-fitting pantaloons and shirt under a long-skirted petticoat and dress. Earlier in the novel, Rose had been wearing a tight belt <b>to</b> keep <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> small, which Alec insisted she stop doing for the sake of her health (Chapter 5, [...] "A Belt and a Box"). When Clara tries <b>to</b> convince <b>her</b> <b>to</b> wear a corset, Alec is furious.|$|R

Jones explained Sophie's styling choices are [...] "pretty extreme" [...] compared <b>to</b> <b>her</b> own casual style and she added [...] "I can't give too much away but her look is very radical, she's definitely discovered what eye-liner and mascara is all about."

60|$|A {{woman of}} about five-and-thirty, with an aquiline face, and a long, dark, silky beard {{sweeping}} down <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>waist.</b> Whatever this woman's charms {{might have been}} for me when I {{was still in the}} profession, she could now boast of very few.

Following them was a huge and lumbering serving man with a beard like fire, who, in a loyal effort to imitate the actions of his master, had hooked a great limb about the neck of Red Bow's stout little attendant, and held her thus in a chancery which, if flattering, must have been uncomfortable. As Martin explained to the poor woman afterwards, it was no fault of his, since in order <b>to</b> reach <b>her</b> <b>waist</b> he must have carried her under his arm.|$|R
