To examine the role, if any, of the silicone oil lubricant in this process, a systematic evaluation of the degree of insulin denaturation and aggregation as a function of silicone oils of different molecular weights was undertaken. The former was measured using fluorescence changes of aqueous insulin/silicone dispersions, while the latter examined changes in turbidity as a function of mixing and silicone oil type; the results were confirmed at two different insulin concentrations and agitation speeds. Lower molecular weight silicones led to the most rapid denaturation and aggregation, and when examined in blends of silicones at a fixed viscosity of 1000 cSt, commonly used for syringe lubrication, more rapid denaturation/aggregation was noted in blends of silicones containing the largest fractions of low molecular weight materials. As a consequence, the molecular weight profile of silicone lubricants should be established prior to the preparation of prefilled syringes...|$|E

The conical Implant compared with cylindric screw-type implant resulted in higher primary stability in soft bone (Sakoh et al. 2006). The primary stability of five implant designs was compared in fresh human cadavers. In type 4 bones, the MkIV Brånemark implant maintained a high primary stability in compare with all other types tested (O’Sullivan and Sennerby 2000). However, when measuring the area of these white layers, {{it was found that}} self-tapping straight implant of MK 3 had the smallest, followed by ST, BL, TE, and self-tapping tapered implant of MK 4. Therefore, this result could be the implant macro-design (e.g. tapered and straight) effect to IT than cutting chamber. This order correlates with the implant torque values, suggesting that the size of the white layer is closely related to insertion torque values. It is presumed that the white layer occurs when the cell structure of the artificial bone is damaged by an external force, with variations in reflection factor and refractive index causing the area <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>cloudy.</b> Therefore, the location of the white layer is thought to correspond with the site of stress concentration. In addition, if the size of the white layer does indeed correspond with stress, it could be used to indicate the location, direction, and magnitude of force acting on the artificial bone. The present study showed that the IT and white layer increased according to the tapered portion, resulting in a positive correlation. In other words, the primary stability was shown to be highly dependent on the implant design.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore how modern {{computing}} technology can advance clinical ophthalmology. In particular it will investigate the potential for computer programming in developing measures for assessment of ophthalmic disease. Such measures {{could be used to}} advance clinical care or as research tools, providing objective outcomes to power more robust clinical trials. Key aspects of clinical ophthalmic assessment are measurement of visual function and observation of anatomical structures. To provide a full demonstration of the scope for computing this thesis will demonstrate innovative measures for both peripheral and central vision as well as image analysis algorithms applicable to structures from the anterior of the eye to the posterior. For peripheral vision testing we investigated a novel technique for assessment of young children using computer games to hold their attention. Our device demonstrated the potential for drastically improving compliance to obtain useful and accurate visual field results. For central vision assessment we developed a prototype visual function tester for patients with macular degeneration. Specifically we were able to demonstrate the feasibility of programming an iPad© such that patients with macular degeneration could perform and physically respond satisfactorily when self testing their vision. Combining advances in electronics and computing we present data to support the potential for using iris recognition cameras to image eyes of children with diseases that cause their corneas <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>cloudy</b> and lose transparency. We were subsequently able to apply our own algorithms to produce a score for the opacification of the cornea that would be useful in quantifying these diseases. Finally, with regard to image analysis applications, we describe the development and validation of algorithms for assessment of posterior capsule opacification (re-growth of cataract) and for haemorrhage assessment. All programming and scientific development was done by the author and this thesis therefore presents the potential for computer software development by an ophthalmologist {{as a model for the}} invention of new and novel measures at the interface of computing and ophthalmology...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{and compares}} the two loading systems and their associated energy and basic stress fields in elastic crustal rock mass {{for the cause}} of tectonic earthquakes. The first loading system is an external loading system and associated with the conventional earthquake cause hypothesis of active fault elastic rebounding. The second is a combined loading system where the first external loading system is added with a dense gas loading in the interior of deep crustal rock faults/defects. It is associated with the methane gas hypothesis {{for the cause of}} tectonic earthquakes. Five elastic stresses in rock solids with some idealized faults and caverns are presented to illustrate the similarities and differences of the stress fields and the possible rupture failure modes in association of the two loading systems. The theoretical results can show that any changes in the local stress concentrations due the external loading alone can be reflected and noticed in the corresponding stresses at the far field. On the other hand, any changes in the local stress concentrations due to the internal gas loading cannot be observed and distinguished in the tectonic stress field at the far distance. These theoretical results can be used to well explain the consensus of earthquake unpredictability with present technology. The theoretical results can further show that the external tectonic loading alone can only cause shear ruptures in crustal fault rocks with high compressive stresses, and such shear rupture or frictional failure is also difficult to occur because its shear plane has extremely high compressive normal stress. The combined loading can cause not only shear ruptures, but also tensile ruptures in crustal fault rocks, and such shear and tensile ruptures occur much easier since the rupture plane can have very low compressive or even high-tensile normal stress. It is argued that the earthquake energy is the volumetric expansion energy of dense gas mass escaped from the deep traps along crustal rock faults. The migration and expansion of the escaped dense gas mass in the crustal rock faults and defects cause the seismic body waves, the ground sounding, the seismic surface waves, the ground co-seismic ruptures and damages. Its rapid migration and expansion in thick water cause tsunamis in lakes and oceans. Its rapid migration and expansion in the atmosphere cause the sky <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>cloudy.</b> The dense methane gas is produced every day in the mantle and core of the Earth, migrates outward and accumulates and stores beneath the lower crustal rock in high compression. It forms a thin spherical layer of dense methane gas separating the cold crustal rocks and the hot mantle materials. Its leaking along deep faults or plate boundaries causes earthquakes and supplies to shallow gas and oil reservoirs beneath secondary traps in adjacent basins of the upper crustal rock mass. postprin...|$|E
40|$|The corneal {{endothelium}} is a non-regenerative monolayer of polygonal cells at {{the posterior}} {{surface of the}} cornea. This monolayer {{plays an important role}} in regulating the hydration state of the corneal stroma. Loss of an intact endothelial monolayer (e. g., by apoptosis through age, inflammation, corneal endotheliopathies or trauma) induces corneal edema, which causes the cornea <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>cloudy,</b> resulting in loss of transparency and visual acuity. In situations of inflammation, thrombin can be generated in the cornea since all components for its production are present in the avascular cornea. Thrombin is known to break down interendothelial junctions, resulting in loss of barrier integrity of the corneal endothelium and formation of interendothelial gaps. Formation of intercellular gaps can diminish the number of gap junctions connecting the endothelial cells, therefore, gap formation is likely to affect intercellular communication (IC). Since IC is important in coordinating the response of cells to external stresses, we investigated the effect of thrombin on IC in corneal endothelial cells. We studied the effect of thrombin on intercellular calcium wave propagation evoked by mechanical stimulation of a single cell in a monolayer of bovine corneal endothelial cells (BCEC), by using calcium fluorescence imaging via laser scanning confocal microscopy and by measuring the area reached by the calcium wave, called active area (AA), the percentage responsive neighboring cells and the normalized fluorescence of the cells. We also investigated the effect on the gap junctional (GJIC) and paracrine (PIC) components of IC. We studied GJIC by measuring fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and by using the gap junction blocking connexin mimetic peptide Gap 27. PIC (which was previously shown to be due to ATP release via hemichannels) was studied by investigating the effect of apyrase (which hydrolyzes ATP and ADP), by application of the ectonucleotidase inhibitor ARL- 67156, by measuring ATP release, by studying the effects of the hemichannel blocking connexin mimetic peptide Gap 26, and by measuring Lucifer Yellow (LY) dye uptake in calcium-free condition, which is an indicator of open hemichannels. Since time in culture can affect cell size and thereby influence the interpretation of measurements of IC, we first investigated the effect of time in culture on cell size and IC in BCEC. We demonstrated that cultured BCEC show a 3. 5 -fold increase in cell size with time in culture, we also showed that cell size of BCEC in passage 3 is significantly different from cell size of BCEC cultured for the same period in passage 1 or 2. In the intact bovine cornea we also showed an age-related increase in cell size. For the IC studies we therefore only used cultured BCEC established from animals with a maximum age of 18 months, and only used cells cultured for 8 to 14 days of passage 1 or 2. Measurements of active area, percentage responsive neighboring cells as well as normalized fluorescence demonstrated that thrombin application caused a marked reduction of intercellular propagation of calcium waves in BCEC. FRAP measurements and measurements of the effect of Gap 27 showed a reduction of GJIC by thrombin. Hydrolysis of extracellular ATP by application of apyrase markedly reduced calcium wave propagation and precluded the effect of thrombin. Application of the ectonucleotidase inhibitor ARL- 67156 caused a pronounced enhancement of calcium wave propagation, and pretreatment with the drug markedly enhanced the inhibitory effect of thrombin. Thrombin markedly decreased ATP release and Lucifer Yellow uptake. These experiments demonstrate that thrombin has a strong inhibitory effect on PIC. We showed that thrombin exerts its effect on IC through PAR- 1 activation. RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry demonstrated expression of thrombin receptor PAR- 1 and the trypsin- activated PAR- 2. Experiments with PAR- 1 and - 4 antagonists and with the selective PAR- 1 agonist TRAP- 6 demonstrated that the effect of thrombin is mediated via PAR- 1 activation. The effects of thrombin on GJIC and PIC could be mimicked by TRAP- 6, demonstrating that the effects of thrombin on GJIC as well as on PIC were mediated via PAR- 1. Our experiments also provided evidence that the effect of thrombin or TRAP- 6 on IC is mediated by enhanced phosphorylation of MLC. Thrombin affects myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) as well as myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP). Inhibition of MLCK with the MLCK inhibitor ML- 7 overcame the effect of thrombin or TRAP- 6 on calcium wave propagation, ATP-release, FRAP and LY dye uptake. The activity of the MLCP is regulated by Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) and PKC: inhibition of ROCK with Y- 27632 and/or PKC-inhibition with chelerythrine also limited the effect of thrombin or TRAP- 6 on calcium wave propagation, ATP-release, FRAP and LY dye uptake. Since application of adenosine is known to preclude the breakdown of barrier integrity by thrombin, we investigated the effect of activation and inhibition of purinergic receptors on the effect of thrombin on IC. We demonstrated that adenosine is able to overcome the inhibitory effect of thrombin or TRAP- 6 on calcium wave propagation, ATP-release, FRAP and LY dye uptake in BCEC. While the potent A 2 B agonist NECA could prevent the inhibitory effect of thrombin on calcium wave propagation and ATP release, the selective A 1 agonist CPA did not oppose the thrombin-induced inhibition of IC. Pretreatment of BCEC with forskolin (to directly activate adenylate cyclase) or the combination of forskolin and rolipram (a cAMP-dependent phosphodiesterase inhibitor) significantly inhibited the effect of thrombin. Thus, adenosine overcomes the inhibitory effect of thrombin on IC through A 2 B activation resulting in cAMP formation, which is known to inhibit activation of RhoA, an activator of ROCK. Previously it was shown that P 2 Y 1 and P 2 Y 2 contributed to PIC in BCEC. By RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry, we showed expression of the ADP-sensitive P 2 Y 12 receptor. Pretreatment with the P 2 Y 12 antagonists AR-C 69931 MX and MRS 2395 showed that P 2 Y 12 activation contributes to IC upon mechanical stimulation. However, in contrast to the potentiation of the effect of PAR- 1 activation on platelet aggregation, P 2 Y 12 activation does not potentiate the effect of thrombin on IC in BCEC. In conclusion: Thrombin inhibits intercellular calcium wave propagation in BCEC. This effect is due to activation of PAR- 1 receptors and involves MLC phosphorylation by MLCK-, PKC- and Rho kinase-sensitive pathways. Thrombin mainly inhibits the ATP-mediated PIC pathway, and also reduces GJIC to a lesser extent. Adenosine prevents the thrombin-induced inhibition of hemichannel-mediated PIC and of GJIC. The mechanism involves an increase in cAMP concentration, which results in inhibition of RhoA and a subsequent decrease in MLC phosphorylation via enhanced MLCP. Since decrease in MLC phosphorylation causes a decrease in contractility of the actin cytoskeleton, our results suggest possible effects of the actin cytoskeleton on gap junctions and also on hemichannels. These findings are important for understanding the processes involved in corneal inflammation. TABLE OF CONTENTS	I LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS	V CHAPTER I. INTRODUCTION	 1 I. CORNEA	 2 A.

50|$|The {{low index}} of {{refraction}} and the feeble double refraction in nepheline are nearly {{the same as in}} quartz; but since in nepheline the sign of the double refraction is negative, while in quartz it is positive, the two minerals are readily distinguished under the microscope. An important determinative character of nepheline is the ease with which it is decomposed by hydrochloric acid, with separation of gelatinous silica (which may be readily stained by coloring matters) and cubes of salt. For this reason, a clear crystal of nepheline <b>becomes</b> <b>cloudy</b> when immersed in acid.|$|R
