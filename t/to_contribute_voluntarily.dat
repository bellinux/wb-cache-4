Nevertheless, empirical results from eBay show that buyers submit ratings to more than 50% of transactions.

The predictions of our model are empirically tested with the field data we obtained. The reasons for leaving a tip are analysed. A significant amount of users are motivated by social preferences. We also find strong support for reputation concerns. Moreover, researchers appear to adjust their effort based on the user's previous tipping behaviour. We conclude that an endogenous incomplete contracts design encourages people <b>to</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>voluntarily.</b> This is motivated by reciprocity when people are socially minded, but also generally by strategic behaviour to build up a good reputation.

40|$|This {{research}} first asks ‘What {{happens when}} young people leave state care?’ {{in respect of}} Victoria and Queensland and second ‘What are the service support implications of this?’ A number of methods were used to explore these questions including semi-structured interviews with 27 young adults aged 19 - 23 years who had been homeless or at risk of homelessness, and focus groups with young people and service providers. This study provides support for the proposition that young people should be proactively and voluntarily involved in periodic monitoring of their lived experience post care and linkage of this monitoring to the activation of timely support. The great majority of young people involved in this study thought this was not only desirable but important. Whilst some young people will be {{in close contact with}} leaving care services many others will not. New research is recommended to develop a mentoring and support activation process using participatory monitoring and action research methods.

40|$|A {{key issue}} in {{community}} {{research is the}} set of motivations stimulating individuals <b>to</b> participate and <b>contribute</b> <b>voluntarily</b> <b>to</b> communities. This article examines the motivations of employees, who are traditionally {{not involved in the}} innovation process, to (not) participate in organizational innovation communities. Building on an in-depth single case study, we aim to answer the following research questions: (1) What motivates participants of organizational innovation communities to participate? and (2) What motivates nonparticipants of organizational innovation communities to not participate? We find and categorize multiple factors that motivate non-research and development employees to participate and to not participate. Moreover, we find an overlap as well as differences in the set of motivations of participants and nonparticipants. With nonparticipants normally being a large but barely explicitly recognized group, we argue that the found deviations <b>contribute</b> <b>to</b> the understanding of motivations in the context of organizational innovation communities and allow for direct design implications for innovation managers...|$|R

40|$|As {{part of a}} mixed-methods {{doctoral}} project, {{this study}} drew on an interview, bracketed by two surveys, with experienced Australian reviewers. It explored questions about the contributions of peer review, the need and possibility to improve it and the driving factors for reviewers <b>to</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>voluntarily.</b> The respondents emphasised the essential status of peer review, especially for ensuring quality in research and publication. They also acknowledged its contributions of gatekeeping, establishing credibility and authority, building capacity, improving quality and facilitating disciplinary dialogue.

A strong sense of faith and a high level of tolerance of the deficiencies in peer review were evident, which appeared {{to be related to the}} awareness that for most problems there was no obvious solution and to an appreciation of the voluntary nature of the task. This faith and tolerance, along with the complex nature of peer review, partially explained why it was so difficult to make any change to it.

40|$|In {{economic}} terms, {{the environment}} is largely a public good. Contributing to a public good is costly to an individual, while the benefits are enjoyed by all. Despite this, many people voluntarily contribute to public goods, both in laboratory economic experiments and through day-to-day environmental decisions. These voluntary contributions are largely motivated intrinsically, that is satisfaction comes from the act itself rather than external rewards. Policy interventions are often required to increase the provision of public goods to the socially optimal level, which usually {{take the form of}} extrinsic incentives such as payments or regulations. Theoretical and empirical evidence from psychology and economics suggests that such extrinsic incentives can crowd out the intrinsic motivations which underlie voluntary contributions. As a result, a policy may have less than the anticipated impact. It is even possible for a costly policy intervention to lead to a decrease in overall public good provision, as individuals cease <b>to</b> <b>contribute</b> <b>voluntarily.</b> This paper argues that environmental policy design should proceed with caution in the presence of intrinsic motivations. Weak regulations and small, competitive financial incentives have the greatest potential for negative effects. Recognising and supporting existing efforts can crowd in, rather than crowd out, voluntary contributions. With careful design and implementation, there is the potential to maintain and support intrinsic motivations while also providing robust extrinsic incentives. public goods, environmental policy, intrinsic motivation, crowding out...|$|E

However, contrary to such assertions, the open source software development (OSSD) approach, in which software developers in digital social networks coordinate <b>to</b> <b>voluntarily</b> <b>contribute</b> programming code, has recently emerged as a promising alternative. Although many high profile cases of successful OSSD projects exist, the harsh reality is {{that the vast majority of}} OSS projects fail to take off and become abandoned. A commonly cited reason for the failure of OSS projects is the inability of the software project to bring together a critical mass of developers. This paper empirically examines the role of prior collaborative ties on how OSSD project teams are formed. Using software project data from real world OSSD projects, we find that the existence and the amount of prior collaborative relations in the developer network do increase the probability that an OSS project will attract more developers and that a developer’s prior relationships with a project initiator do increase the likelihood that a developer will join a project initiated by a past collaborator. We also explore the performance implications of early team formation behaviors...|$|R
