40|$|ObjectiveThe {{bicuspid}} aorta {{is thought}} to have a higher risk of progressive dilation after aortic valve replacement with a subsequently increased risk of adverse aortic events. Our aim was to compare the risk of late aortic events after isolated aortic valve replacement surgery for bicuspid versus <b>tricuspid</b> aortic <b>valve</b> <b>stenosis</b> with concomitant mild to moderate dilatation of the proximal aorta. MethodsA total of 325 consecutive patients (60 % males; mean age, 59. 5 ± 10 years) with aortic <b>valve</b> <b>stenosis</b> and concomitant ascending aortic dilatation of 40 to 50 mm underwent isolated aortic valve replacement from 1995 through 2000. A total of 153 patients (47 %) were diagnosed with bicuspid aortic <b>valve</b> <b>stenosis</b> (bicuspid aortic <b>valve</b> group), whereas the remaining 172 patients (53 %) had <b>tricuspid</b> aortic <b>valve</b> <b>stenosis</b> (<b>tricuspid</b> aortic <b>valve</b> group). Follow-up (3566 patient-years) was 100 % complete. Adverse aortic events were defined as the need for proximal aortic surgery or the occurrence of aortic dissection/rupture or sudden death during follow-up. ResultsOverall survival was 78 ± 4 % in the bicuspid aortic valve group versus 55 ± 6 % in the <b>tricuspid</b> aortic <b>valve</b> group (P = . 006) at 15 years postoperatively, but age-adjusted survival was not significantly different between groups (P = . 4). A total of 5 patients (3 %) in the bicuspid aortic valve group versus 9 patients (5 %) in the <b>tricuspid</b> aortic <b>valve</b> group underwent proximal aortic surgery during follow-up. Aortic dissection occurred in 3 patients in the <b>tricuspid</b> aortic <b>valve</b> group and in no bicuspid aortic valve patients. Fifteen-year freedom from adverse aortic events was 93 ± 3 % in the bicuspid aortic valve group versus 82 ± 6 % in the <b>tricuspid</b> aortic <b>valve</b> group (P = . 2).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the relative importance}} of the different causes of isolated aortic <b>valve</b> <b>stenosis</b> in a surgical series, and to relate these to patient characteristics including the rate of insertion of bypass grafts for coronary artery disease. DESIGN: Survey of the clinical and pathological data on patients undergoing aortic valve replacement for isolated stenosis. SETTING: Tertiary care cardiothoracic surgical unit. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 465 adult patients undergoing aortic valve replacement representing a consecutive series in one surgical unit. Retrospective review of patients records and classification of cause of aortic stenosis based on pathological examination of excised valve cusps. RESULTS: 63. 7 % patients had calcific bicuspid valves, 26. 9 % <b>tricuspid</b> calcific <b>valves,</b> and 5. 4 % rheumatic, 2. 6 % mixed pathology and 1. 5 % unicommissural valves. The ratio of males to females for bicuspid valves was 1. 85 : 1 and for <b>tricuspid</b> calcific <b>valves</b> 0. 76 : 1. The mean age of patients with bicuspid valves was 64. 9 years compared with 73. 4 years for those with <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valves.</b> Some 22. 3 % of patients with bicuspid valves and 44. 8 % of those with <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valves</b> had sufficient coronary artery disease to necessitate insertion of coronary bypass grafts. The differential rate of insertion of coronary bypass grafts was independent of age.

40|$|Introduction: The <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> (TV) is {{a complex}} {{structure}} (Lamers et al. (1995) [1]). The {{most common cause of}} pathologic tricuspid regurgitation is functional, due to annular dilatation with normal leaflet morphology (Sagie et al. (1994) [2]). Myxomatous disease of the <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> is often associated with mitral valve involvement but isolated tricuspid prolapse has been rarely reported (Tei et al. (1983) [3]). Unlike the common combination between rheumatic mitral <b>valve</b> <b>stenosis</b> and functional <b>tricuspid</b> regurgitation, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first case of such combination between <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> prolapse and rheumatic mitral <b>valve</b> <b>stenosis</b> reported with three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (3 D-TEE). Case presentation: We are presenting a 43 -year-old female patient that had dyspnea on effort NYHA class III. A transthoracic echocardiography showed severe rheumatic mitral <b>valve</b> <b>stenosis</b> with severe <b>tricuspid</b> regurgitation. A routine preoperative 2 D-transesophageal echocardiography (2 D-TEE) showed severe rheumatic mitral <b>valve</b> <b>stenosis</b> with severe <b>tricuspid</b> regurgitation due to prolapse of one of the <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> leaflets. 3 D-TEE showed prolapse of the medial half of the posterior leaflet of the <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve.</b> These findings were confirmed during surgery and had led to a change in the surgical plan from traditional mitral <b>valve</b> replacement with <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> annuloplasty, to mitral <b>valve</b> replacement with <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> anatomical repair. Conclusion: The <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> {{is a complex}} structure. 2 D-TTE and TEE is not usually enough for complete delineation of the anatomy and pathology of the <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve.</b> 3 D-TEE has an incremental value in providing informative en-face view of the three leaflets of the <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> that facilitates precise determination of its anatomy and pathology. This is a rare case of unusual combination between <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> prolapse and rheumatic mitral <b>valve</b> <b>stenosis...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> <b>stenosis</b> is a valvular {{heart disease}} which results in the {{narrowing}} of the orifice of the tricuspid valve of the heart. It is a relatively rare condition that causes stenosis- increased resistance to blood flow through the valve.|$|E
50|$|Regurgitation {{occurs when}} a valve becomes {{insufficient}} and malfunctions, allowing some blood to flow in the wrong direction. This insufficiency can affect any of the valves as in aortic insufficiency, mitral insufficiency, pulmonary insufficiency and tricuspid insufficiency. The other form of valvular heart disease is stenosis, a narrowing of the valve. This {{is a result of}} the valve becoming thickened and any of the heart valves can be affected, as in mitral valve stenosis, <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> <b>stenosis,</b> pulmonary valve stenosis and aortic valve stenosis. Stenosis of the mitral valve is a common complication of rheumatic fever. Inflammation of the valves can be caused by infective endocarditis , usually a bacterial infection but can sometimes be caused by other organisms. Bacteria can more readily attach to damaged valves. Another type of endocarditis which doesn't provoke an inflammatory response, is nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis. This is commonly found on previously undamaged valves. A major valvular heart disease is mitral valve prolapse, which is a weakening of connective tissue called myxomatous degeneration of the valve. This sees the displacement of a thickened mitral valve cusp into the left atrium during systole.|$|E
40|$|<b>Tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> <b>stenosis</b> in {{the setting}} of {{endocarditis}} is associated with a high morbidity. Diagnostic approaches incorporate a high clinical index of sus-picion, echocardiographic evidence, and inferences about hemodynamic data derived from pulmonary artery catheterization. As demonstrated by the case presented herein, inadequate initial evaluation of right-sided pressures delayed the diagnosis and treatment of prosthetic <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> <b>stenosis...</b>|$|E
40|$|Two-dimensional echocardiograms and angiocardiograms were {{obtained}} in six infants and children, each with complete transposition {{of the great}} arteries, a ventricular septal defect and subvalvular pulmonary stenosis. In each case, the subpulmonary stenosis resulted from redundant <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> tissue which protruded through the ventricular septal defect and into the left ventricular outflow tract. Angio-echocardiographic correlations demonstrated features that allowed preoperative recognition of this unusual type of subpulmonary stenosis. The left ventricular angiogram in an anteroposterior orientation revealed a characteristic filling defect in the outflow tract during systole in each patient. Echocardiographic images of the left ventricular outflow tract and of the <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> demonstrated subpulmonary <b>stenosis</b> caused by protruding redundant <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> tissue (resembling a “pouch”) in all six patients. These findings were contrasted with those from three patients with normally related great arteries and a similar, but nonobstructive, <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> pouch. Echocardiographic and angiocardiographic examination and correlation allowed preoperative diagnosis of this unusual form of subpulmonary stenosis in complete transposition of the great arteries. This is especially important because limited left ventricular intraoperative exploration may fail to reveal subpulmonary obstruction as the pouch may be flaccid in a relaxed arrested heart...|$|R

A total of 17 bicuspid and 34 <b>tricuspid</b> aortic <b>valves</b> were evaluated. Macrophage/T-cell infiltration (CD 68 plus CD 3) and neovessel density (CD 34) were evaluated with immunohistochemical staining. Leaflet calcification and ossification were also quantified. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to assess expression of chondromodulin 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor. ResultsThe density of macrophages/T cells was greater in congenital bicuspid aortic <b>valves</b> than in <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valves</b> (51 ± 31 vs 23 ± 13 cells/mm 2, P = . 002). Neovascularization was more frequently noted in congenital bicuspid aortic valves when compared with <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valves</b> (31 ± 10 vs 21 ± 9 vessels/mm 2, P = . 0005), and calcification was more severe (P = . 03). Expression of chondromodulin 1 demonstrated a 6 -fold downregulation (P = . 0003) and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor demonstrated a 2 -fold increase (P = . 02) in congenital bicuspid aortic valves compared with that seen in <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valves.</b> Multivariable analyses demonstrated significant associations between bicuspid aortic valve anatomy and increased inflammatory cell infiltration (β =  25. 8, P = . 0007) and neovascularization (β =  9. 4, P = . 001), despite adjusting for measured covariates.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{present study}} {{examined}} {{temporal and spatial}} patterns of extracellular matrix and smooth muscle cell changes in the ascending aorta with bicuspid and <b>tricuspid</b> aortic <b>valve</b> <b>stenosis.</b> METHODS: Wall specimens were retrieved from both the greater and the lesser curvature ("convexity" and "concavity") of 14 nonaneurysmal and 12 aneurysmal aortas (aortic ratios 1. 2 and 1. 5, respectively) and from 3 heart donors (normal). Immunochemistry was performed for detection of apoptotic (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling [TUNEL]-positive) and proliferating (Ki- 67 -positive) smooth muscle cells and for semiquantification of matrix proteins (collagens, fibronectin, tenascin, laminin). Co-immunoprecipitation assessed the extent of Bcl- 2 -modifying factor binding to Bcl- 2, indicating a matrix-derived cytoskeleton-mediated proapoptotic signaling. Polymerase chain reaction allowed for quantification of messenger RNA expression for Bcl- 2. RESULTS: In both bicuspid and tricuspid aneurysms, fibrillar collagens were reduced, whereas fibronectin and tenascin were increased compared with those in normal conditions. These matrix alterations were already evident in bicuspid nonaneurysmal aortas at the convexity, with significant elevation of apoptotic indexes (P =. 02 bicuspid vs normal; P =. 48 tricuspid vs normal). Apoptotic indexes correlated with aortic dimensions only in tricuspid aortas (P =. 01). No significant increase in Ki- 67 was found. Higher levels of Bcl- 2 -modifying factor-Bcl- 2 binding were found in bicuspid nonaneurysmal aorta versus tricuspid (P =. 03) and normal aortas (P =. 01). Bcl- 2 messenger RNA expression was reduced in the bicuspid aorta versus normal (P =. 08). CONCLUSIONS: Smooth muscle cell apoptosis with bicuspid aortic <b>valve</b> <b>stenosis</b> occurred before overt aortic dilation, mainly at the convexity, where wall stress is expectedly higher. In this setting, a matrix-dependent proapoptotic signaling was evidenced by increased Bcl- 2 -modifying factor-Bcl- 2 binding.

40|$|Despite the {{generally}} excellent success with balloon dilation for the stenotic lesions of congenital and acquired heart disease, technical difficulties sometimes prevent satisfactory results. Such technical difficulties include: 1) a large {{diameter of the}} anulus of the stenotic lesion relative to available balloon diameter, 2) difficulty in the insertion or removal of the larger balloon catheters, and 3) permanent damage to or obstruction of the femoral vessels by the redundant deflated balloon material of the large balloons. A double balloon technique was initiated to resolve these difficulties. With this method, percutaneous balloon angioplasty catheters were inserted in right and left femoral vessels, placed side by side across the stenotic lesion and inflated simultaneously. Dilation procedures using the two balloon technique were performed in 41 patients: 18 with pulmonary valve stenosis, 14 with aortic valve stenosis, 5 with mitral valve stenosis, 3 with vena caval obstruction following the Mustard or Senning procedure and 1 with <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> <b>stenosis.</b> Patient ages ranged from 1 to 75 years (mean 17. 8) and patient weights ranged from 8. 9 to 89 kg (mean 42. 3). Balloon catheter sizes ranged from 10 to 20 mm in diameter. Average maximal pressure gradient in mm Hg before dilation was 61 in pulmonary stenosis, 68 in aortic stenosis, 21 in mitral stenosis, 12 in tricuspid stenosis and 25 in vena caval stenosis. Average maximal valvular pressure gradient after dilation was 13 in pulmonary stenosis, 24 in aortic stenosis, 4 in mitral stenosis, 0 in tricuspid stenosis, and 1 in vena caval stenosis. No major complications were encountered with the procedures. It is concluded that the two balloon technique of percutaneous balloon dilation is effective and has substantial advantages, in selected cases, over techniques employing a single large angioplasty balloon...|$|E
40|$|Abstract A 76 -year-old {{woman with}} a history of {{percutaneous}} transvenous mitral commissurotomy and repeated hospital admissions due to heart failure was referred for an operation for severe mitral <b>valve</b> <b>stenosis.</b> She presented with hypertension, hyperlipidemia and cerebral infarction with stenosis of right internal carotid artery, retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy caused by long-term uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hemoglobin A 1 c of 9. 4 %, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification of 3 / 4. Echocardiography revealed severe mitral <b>valve</b> <b>stenosis</b> with mitral <b>valve</b> area of 0. 6 cm 2, moderate <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> regurgitation, and dilatation of the left atrium. Taking into consideration the NYHA functional classification and severe mitral <b>valve</b> <b>stenosis,</b> an immediate surgical intervention designed to prevent mediastinitis was performed. The approach was via the right 4 th thoracotomy, as conventional sternotomy would raise the risk of mediastinitis. Postoperative antibiotics were administered intravenously for 2 days, and signs of infection were not recognized. In patients with long-term uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, mid-line sternotomy can easily cause mediastinitis. The choice of operative approach {{plays an important role in}} preventing this complication. In this report, the importance of the conventional right thoracotomy for prevention for mediastinitis is reviewed. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{compared}} the long-term results of surgical valvotomy (S) versus balloon valvuloplasty (BV) for pulmonary <b>valve</b> <b>stenosis</b> in infants and children. METHODS: Results after surgical pulmonary valvotomy (with concomitant ASD/VSD closure) (n = 62, age 2. 9 +/- 3. 5 years) and balloon valvuloplasty (n = 108, age 3. 6 +/- 3. 9 years) were analyzed. Transvalvular mean pressure gradient decrease, freedom from reintervention for restenosis, pulmonary <b>valve</b> insufficiency, and <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> insufficiency were considered. RESULTS: Mean pressure gradient decreased significantly {{more in the}} surgical group (from 64. 8 +/- 30. 8 mm Hg to 12. 8 +/- 9. 8 mm Hg at a mean follow-up of 9. 8 years) than after BV (decreasing from 66. 2 +/- 21. 4 mm Hg to 21. 5 +/- 15. 9 mm Hg after a mean of 5. 4 years; p &lt; 0. 001). Moderate pulmonary valve insufficiency occurred in 44 % after surgery, and in 11 % after BV (p &lt; 0. 001). <b>Tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> insufficiency occurred in 2 % after surgery, and in 5 % after BV. Restenosis occurred in 3 surgical patients (5. 6 %), 2 patients required reoperation, and 1 patient required a balloon valvotomy. Restenosis developed in 13 BV patients (14. 1 %) : 6 patients were redilated and 7 patients required surgery. Surgical valvotomy led to significantly less reinterventions than balloon valvuloplasty (p &lt; 0. 04). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical relief of pulmonary <b>valve</b> <b>stenosis</b> produces lower long-term gradients and results in longer freedom from reintervention. Balloon valvuloplasty may remain, despite these results, the preferred therapy for isolated pulmonary <b>valve</b> <b>stenosis,</b> because it is less invasive, less expensive, and requires a shorter hospital stay. Surgery should remain the exclusive form of therapy {{in the presence of}} concomitant intracardiac defects, which need to be addressed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCoexisting {{coronary}} artery disease and significant heart valve disease represent a considerable risk factor in patients undergoing pulmonary resection. The possibility to perform concomitant (simultaneous) heart and lung surgery {{could be a good}} option for many patients. In the presented case report, the intervention was performed on two valves, triple {{coronary artery}} bypass and pulmonary resection, which has not been published in literature to date. A 68 -year-old woman with {{coronary artery disease}}, aortic <b>valve</b> <b>stenosis,</b> <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> regurgitation and pulmonary disease (malignant pathology) presented with triple vessel disease, moderate aortic <b>valve</b> <b>stenosis,</b> severe <b>tricuspid</b> regurgitation and tumorous infiltration in the upper lobe of the left lung. She underwent combined heart and pulmonary surgery-left upper lobectomy, aortic <b>valve</b> replacement, <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> repair and coronary artery bypass surgery. On the eight day of surgery, she was discharged. She continues to do well on follow-up. Simultaneous cardiac surgery and pulmonary resection for malignancy become almost standard treatment of patients who require heart and lung surgery. The most often approach is midline sternotomy that enables a comfortable cardiac intervention as well as an acceptable access to lungs. The left lower lobectomy remains an exception, in which pulmonary resection during extracorporeal circulation (ECC) is more often an option of left thoracotomy. If the use of ECC is inevitable, some authors prefer pulmonary resection before starting up ECC if the location of the neoplasm does not require resection during ECC...|$|R
