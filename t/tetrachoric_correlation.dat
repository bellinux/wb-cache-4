The model was realistic of performance of binary items in current tests of cognitive abilities. Three indices were investigated : one based on the property of local independence of unidimensional tests (the independence index), one based on patterns of second factor loadings derived from simplex theory (the pattern index), and one that reflects {{the shape of the}} curve of successive eigenvalues (the ratio of differences index). The last index was used for matrices of phi coefficients, <b>tetrachoric</b> <b>correlations,</b> and variances-covariances. The local independence index reported here was the most accurate dimensionality index. The pattern index was accurate under many combinations of parameters, but decreased substantially at the highest level of factor correlations and the widest dispersion of item difficulties. None of the eigenvalue indices produced satisfactory accuracy, except under the most favorable combinations of parameters.

Method: We examined 685 172 individuals born in Sweden from 1980 to 1990 with four grandparents, and both parents alive in 1980. AUD was assessed in all these individuals from nationwide medical, criminal and pharmacy registries. Results: AUD was stably transmitted across three generations.

Grandchild AUD risk did not vary {{as a function of}} the sex of the parent or grandparent. However, from grandparents and parents, transmission to grandchildren was stronger in same-sex than opposite-sex pairs.

40|$|In this thesis, we {{consider}} measures of association for ordinal variables from a theoretical perspective. In particular, we study the phi-coefficient, the <b>tetrachoric</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient and the polychoric correlation coefficient. We also {{introduce a new}} measure of association for ordinal variables, the empirical polychoric correlation coefficient, which has better theoretical properties than the polychoric correlation coefficient, including greatly enhanced robustness. In the first article, entitled ``On {{the relation between the}} phi-coefficient and the <b>tetrachoric</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient'', we show that under given marginal probabilities there exists a continuous bijection between the two measures of association. Furthermore, we show that the bijection has a fixed point at zero for all marginal probabilities. Consequently, the choice of which of these measures of association to use is for all practical purposes a matter of preference only. In the second article, entitled ``A generalized definition of the <b>tetrachoric</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient'', we generalize the <b>tetrachoric</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient so that a large class of parametric families of bivariate distributions can be assumed as underlying distributions. We also provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the generalized <b>tetrachoric</b> <b>correlation</b> coefficient to be well defined for a given parametric family of bivariate distributions. With examples, we illustrate the effects on the polychoric correlation coefficient of different distributional assumptions. In the third article, entitled ``A generalized definition of the polychoric correlation coefficient'', we generalize the polychoric correlation coefficient to a large class of parametric families of bivariate distributions, and show that the generalized and the conventional polychoric correlation coefficients agree on the family of bivariate normal distributions. With examples, we illustrate the effects of different distributional assumptions on the polychoric correlation coefficient. In combination with goodness-of-fit p-values, the association analysis can be enriched with a consideration of possible tail dependence. In the fourth article, we propose a new measure of association for ordinal variables, named the empirical polychoric correlation coefficient. The empirical polychoric correlation coefficient relaxes the fundamental assumption of the polychoric correlation coefficient so that an underlying joint distribution is only assumed to exist, not to be of a particular parametric family. We also provide an asymptotical result, by which the empirical polychoric correlation coefficient converges almost surely to the true polychoric correlation under very general conditions. Thus, the proposed empirical polychoric correlation coefficient has better theoretical properties than the polychoric correlation coefficient...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundThe {{contribution}} of hereditary {{and environmental factors}} {{to the development of}} abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) is still partly unknown. The aim {{of this study was to}} analyze the role of these factors in a large population-based sample of twins. MethodsThe Swedish Twin Registry, containing data on twins born in the country since 1886, was cross-linked with the Inpatient Registry, providing national coverage of discharge diagnoses coded according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). All twins with an infrarenal AAA were identified. Concordance rates and <b>tetrachoric</b> <b>correlations</b> were calculated for monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twins. <b>Tetrachoric</b> <b>correlations</b> were calculated assuming an underlying normal distribution of liability, with multiple factors contributing additively and a threshold value that discriminates between AAA and no AAA. Higher concordance rates and correlations of liability in MZ twins than in DZ twins suggest that genetic factors influence disease development. Structural equation modeling techniques, Mx-analyses, were used to estimate the contributions of genetic effects as well as shared and nonshared environmental factors for development of AAA. ResultsThere were 172, 890 twins registered at the time of the study including 265 twins (81 % men; mean age 72 years; range, 48 - 94) with AAA. There were 7 MZ and 5 DZ concordant pairs as well as 44 MZ and 197 DZ discordant pairs with AAA. The probandwise concordance rates for MZ and DZ pairs were 24 % and 4. 8 %, respectively. The <b>tetrachoric</b> <b>correlations</b> were 0. 71 in MZ pairs and 0. 31 in DZ pairs. The odds ratio (OR) was 71 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 27 - 183) for MZ twins and 7. 6 (95 % CI 3. 0 - 19) for DZ twins. In the structural equation models, genetic effects accounted for 70 % (95 % CI 0. 33 - 0. 83), shared environmental effects for 0 % (95 % CI 0 - 0. 27), and nonshared environmental effects for 30 % (95 % CI 0. 17 - 0. 46) of the phenotypic variance among twins. ConclusionThese data provide robust epidemiologic evidence that heritability contributes to aneurysm formation. Concordances and correlations were higher in MZ compared with DZ twins, indicating genetic effects. There was a 24 % probability that an MZ twin of a person with AAA will have the disease. The twin of an MZ twin with AAA had a risk of AAA that was 71 times that of the MZ twin of a person without AAA. A heritability of 70 % of the total trait variance was estimated. The remaining variance was explained by nonshared environmental factors with no support for a role of shared environmental influences...|$|R
40|$|Background: Psychiatry {{has long}} sought to develop {{biological}} diagnostic subtypes based on symptomatic differences. This effort assumes that symptoms reflect, with good fidelity, underlying etiological processes. We address this question for major depression (MD). Methods: We examine, in twins from a population-based registry, similarity in symptom endorsement in individuals meeting criteria for last-year MD at separate interview waves and in concordant twin pairs. Among individuals with MD, we explore {{the impact of}} genetic-temperamental and child adversity risk factors on individual reported symptoms. Aggregated criteria do not separate insomnia from hypersomnia, weight gain from loss, etc. while disaggregated criteria do. Results: In twins with MD at two different waves, the mean <b>tetrachoric</b> <b>correlations</b> (+/- SEM) for aggregated and disaggregated DSM-IV A criteria were, respectively, + 0. 31 +/- 0. 06 and + 0. 34 +/- 0. 03. In monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs concordant for last-year MD, the mean <b>tetrachoric</b> <b>correlations</b> for aggregated and disaggregated criteria were, respectively, + 0. 33 +/- 0. 07 and + 0. 43 +/- 0. 04, and + 0. 05 +/- 0. 08 and + 0. 07 +/- 0. 04. In individuals meeting MD criteria, neuroticism predicted the most MD symptoms (10), followed by childhood sexual abuse (8), low parental warmth (6), and genetic risk (4). Conclusions: The correlations for individual depressive symptoms over multiple episodes and within MZ twins concordant for MD are modest suggesting {{the important role of}} transient influences. The multidetermination of individual symptoms was further evidenced by their prediction by personality and exposure to early life adversities.

40|$|Background and {{objective}} Almost 100 % individuals with coeliac disease (CD) are carriers {{of the human}} leucocyte antigen (HLA) DQ 2 /DQ 8 alleles. Earlier studies have, however, failed to consider the HLA system when estimating heritability in CD, thus violating an underlying assumption of heritability analysis. We examined the heritability of CD in a large population-based sample of twins, considering HLA. Design In a population-representative sample of 107 912 twins, we identified individuals with CD (equal to villous atrophy) through biopsy reports from all Swedish pathology departments. We calculated concordance rates and <b>tetrachoric</b> <b>correlations</b> for monozygotic (MZ) and dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs. Further, we estimated heritability of CD, first strictly from observed data, and then the non-HLA heritability, representing the heritability of all genetic factors except the HLA locus, using an approach that circumvent the violation of underlying assumptions. Results We identified 513 twins with a diagnosis of CD (prevalence 0. 48 %). Concordance rates were higher in MZ pairs (0. 49) than in DZ pairs (0. 10), as were <b>tetrachoric</b> <b>correlations</b> (0. 89 in MZ vs 0. 51 in DZ pairs). The heritability of CD was 75 % (95 % CI 55 % to 96 %).
