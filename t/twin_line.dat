DPL 451 BR Upland cotton was planted into oat hay stubble on April 30 and May 5, 2004 at commercial cooperator sites at Tonopah and Tolleson AZ, respectively. The two primary experimental objectives were to determine whether cotton planted into previous crop residue initiated fruiting on the mainstem once the cotton seedling grew above the crop stubble and whether there were differences in lint yield between the single and <b>twin</b> <b>line</b> system. Previous <b>twin</b> <b>line</b> cotton production research had been conducted by authors at 30 locations from 2001 - 2003.

40|$|<b>Twin</b> <b>line</b> (two seed lines 7. 25 in apart per bed) and {{conventional}} single seed line per bed cotton production systems were compared at 18 sites across Arizona and the Palo Verde Valley near Blythe, Ca. in 2002 and 9 sites in 2003. Three experiments at the Chaffin site in 2002 compared <b>twin</b> <b>line</b> plant populations of 57, 000 (57 K), 75, 000 (75 K), and 90, 000 (90 K) plants per acre (ppa). In 2002, the <b>twin</b> <b>line</b> system produced more lint than the conventional single line system at 4 of 18 locations; the yields of the <b>twin</b> <b>line</b> and single line systems were 1273 and 1186 lb/acre, 1572 and 1461 lb/acre, 1478 and 1290 lb/acre, and 1309 and 1210 lb/acre, respectively, at the Grasty, Ramona, Rovey, and Wells sites, respectively. In 2003, {{none of the}} experiments resulted in higher <b>twin</b> <b>line</b> system lint yields. In 2002, {{there were no significant}} differences in yield or fiber micronaire in 7 of the 18 experiments. In 2003, {{there were no significant differences}} in yield in 3 of the 9 experiments. In 2002, the <b>twin</b> <b>line</b> system produced less lint than the conventional system at 5 of 18 locations; yields of the <b>twin</b> <b>line</b> and single line systems were 2019 and 2189 lb/acre, 1400 and 1489 lb/acre, 1537 and 1845 lb/acre, 1065 and 1200 lb/acre, and 1271 and 1431 lb/acre, respectively, at the Chaffin (75 K), Cooley, Hull, Papago, and Wakimoto sites, respectively. In 2003, the <b>twin</b> <b>line</b> system resulted in less yield in 6 of the 9 experiments; yields of the <b>twin</b> <b>line</b> and single line systems were 1154 and 1285 lb. /acre, 1906 and 2109 lb. /acre, 1797 and 1938 lb. /acre, 878 and 1114 lb. /acre, 726 and 821 lb. /acre, and 1230 and 1404 lb. /acre, respectively, at the Hull, Marlatt 1, 2,, 3, Murphy Late Plant, and the University of Arizona (UA) Marana Agricultural Center sites respectively. In 2002, fiber micronaire was reduced in five experiments; the micronaire values were 4. 25 and 4. 73, 4. 46 and 4. 78, 4. 60 and 4. 85, 4. 76 and 4. 98, and 4. 93 and 5. 15, in the <b>twin</b> <b>line</b> and single line systems, respectively, at the Rogers, Papago, Grasty, Hull, and Perry sites, respectively. In 2003, there were no significant differences in fiber micronaire at all 9 test locations.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} were {{conducted at the}} University of Arizona Maricopa Agricultural Center in 2002 designed to evaluate cotton yield and fiber quality at various plant populations and to test cotton variety performance in a twinline per bed cotton production system. The plant population experiment consisted of four target populations which included 60, 80, 100, and 120, 000 plants per acre (PPA) and two varieties, Stoneville 4892 BR and AG 3601. The resulting plant populations were 52800, 69200, 82800 and 96200 for ST 4892 BR and 54800, 70800, 90500 and 104500 for AG 3601.

Adopted EPB shield driving parameters, such as earth chamber pressure, annular filling grouting, and shield {{advance rate}} and cutterhead torque were also detailed. Chen et al. (2014) introduced measures and countermeasures adopted in shield tunneling under the existing operational subway tunnels in Shenzhen. The existing tunnel near the shield launching shaft, a special steel sleeve {{used for the}} launching was fixed at the tunnel portal, and such measures and countermeasures as ground improvement, adjustment of shield driving parameters and information feedback construction were also employed to ensure safety of the under-crossing. Fan (2014) described the schemes for constructing <b>twin</b> <b>Line</b> 3 west extension tunnels of Shenzhen subway, 1.23 and 1.46  m under the two existing operational subway Line 1 tunnels respectively. The adopted technologies were centered on shield driving parameter selection, backfilling grouting and in-tunnel monitoring, and injecting bentonite around the shield. In this project, limiting the speed of trains < 25  km/h during the construction was employed for sake of the public safety. Li et al. (2014) described the shield tunneling technology and measures taken when Line 11 twin running tunnels of Shenzhen subway crossing 1.5  m above Line 1 twin existing operational tunnels. Improving ground above the existing tunnels, elaborate shield driving control together with in-tunnel automatic monitoring helped control the uplift of the existing tunnels within 2  mm and guarantee safety of the subway traffic. Wang et al. (2014) used the 3 D FEM to simulate the excavation process of three crossing forms of the twin new tunnels: first above and then under crossing, two under crossings and two above crossing, based on the actual soil layer of one tunnel overlapping section of Shanghai subway. Reliability of the numerical simulation was verified by the comparison between measured and simulated data. Settlements of the existing tunnels and measures for controlling the settlements were given in the each crossing form. Yun et al. (2014) developed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based monitoring framework using sensor data collected from the existing tunnel while the new tunnel was excavated, which is particularly useful to analyze underdetermined systems due to insufficient sensor data for explicit relations between force and deformation as the system input and output respectively. Zhang et al. (2014) analyzed influence of the two new tunnels construction on the existing twin tunnels for two construction methods of above-crossing and under-crossing, using the commercial program (ABAQUS), and a modified Gaussian equation was proposed to predict ground settlement according to the computation results. Results showed that a secondary disturbance was {{to be caused by}} the shield advance, and greater influences would be exercised on the existing tunnels when the new tunnels were closely spaced. In addition, many other similar shield tunnel close crossing construction projects in mainland China, not reported in literatures or official publications due to various reasons, were realized in demanding conditions not only in respect of inner city environment where space requirements had to be taken into regard but also in respect of safe operations of the neighboring subway tunnels. For instance, in Hangzhou the first shield tunnel crossing project was finished in December 2013, of Hangzhou subway Line 4 tunnel between Guanhe station and Railway East station passing 2.1  m below the twin operational Line 1 tunnels after about 29  m driving from the launching excavation. The Hangzhou subway Line 4 interval tunnel between Qianjianglu station and Jiangjinlu station passing about 1.273  m below Line 1 tunnels was successfully accomplished on April 15, 2014. It is obvious that uttermost publications presented above dealt with only a single case study mainly because of the tribal knowledge of the involved projects. Generalized studies from the many case studies in combination with some undocumented recordings are necessary to improve the shield tunneling in close proximity to the existing operational subway tunnels. Moreover, it is often necessary in practice to take into consideration a set of distinct elements that frequently influence the construction of tunnels near the existing subway tunnels. Then well-targeted graduated response plans are designed to systematically and consistently manage safeties of the projects throughout the whole construction process. Although further studies on some topics do necessitate performing, a common understanding and recognition of the safety control framework has been reached in many aspects of the shield tunneling in close proximity to the existing operational subway tunnels in mainland China. Six key elements of the framework are presented. The conclusions of the elements, on which a consensus can be reached, are generalized from the typical close crossing construction projects in mainland China, while individual differences are illuminated. The purpose of the paper is to give the state-of-the-art review on the key elements of the safety control framework for shield tunneling in close proximity to the operational subway tunnels, so as to provide references for later similar projects.|$|E
