5|$|Because {{of their}} thick outer peridium, Mycenastrum corium puffballs can {{withstand}} hard blows without breaking, and children have used them as replacements for balls.

5|$|Flounoy died as {{a result}} of <b>throat</b> <b>and</b> {{pulmonary}} illnesses on January 28, 1904, at 2:40a.m. in Orlando, Florida, where he had traveled to restore his failing health. His wife and his physician Dr. Henry were at his side at the time of his death. Flournoy was survived by his wife, and five of his children.|$|E
50|$|These {{birds have}} white bellies, two white wing bars, dark legs and thin, {{relatively}} long pointed bills; they have yellowish lines over their eyes. Adult males have olive upperparts <b>and</b> bright yellow <b>throats</b> <b>and</b> breasts; females and immatures display upperparts which are olive-brown. Their <b>throats</b> <b>and</b> breasts are paler.|$|R

5|$|Immature {{birds are}} {{distinguished}} by their smaller size, smaller, duller-brown bill, dark grey chin and <b>throat,</b> <b>and</b> absent or underdeveloped head plumes, often just {{a scattering of}} yellow feathers.

5|$|The black-throated gray warbler {{has mostly}} black, gray, and white plumage, which is soft, lacking gloss. With its {{striping}} {{and the small}} yellow spot between its eye and bill, it is a distinctive bird. The sexes differ slightly, both having gray upperparts with black streaks, and white underparts with black streaks on the flanks. The adult male is striped with a black on the crown, <b>throat,</b> <b>and</b> below the eye, and has white around its chin and above its eye. The adult female has more dingy plumage on its head, with a white <b>throat</b> <b>and</b> dark gray cheeks. The most similar birds to the black-throated gray warbler are the black-and-white and blackpoll warblers, which although marked in black have entirely different plumage patterns.|$|E
5|$|The female Bohemian waxwing is {{very similar}} to the male, but has a {{narrower}} yellow terminal band to the tail, a less defined lower edge to the black <b>throat</b> <b>and</b> slightly less distinctive wing markings. Juveniles are duller than adults, with whiter underparts, only a few red wing tips, no black on the <b>throat</b> <b>and</b> a smaller black face mask. Compared to the nominate subspecies, eastern B. g. centralasiae is paler, greyer and has little reddish-brown behind the bill. The American subspecies B. g. pallidiceps has more colouring on the cheeks and forehead than the nominate form and is otherwise generally duller in appearance.|$|E

5|$|According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, {{short-term}} {{exposure to}} platinum salts may cause irritation of the eyes, nose, and <b>throat,</b> <b>and</b> long-term exposure may cause both respiratory and skin allergies. The current OSHA standard is 2micrograms {{per cubic meter}} of air averaged over an 8-hour work shift. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) for platinum as 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday.|$|E
5|$|B. i. coromandus {{differs from}} the {{nominate}} subspecies in breeding plumage, when the buff colour on its head extends to the cheeks and <b>throat,</b> <b>and</b> the plumes are more golden in colour. This subspecies' bill and tarsus are longer on average than in B. i. ibis. B. i. seychellarum is smaller and shorter-winged than the other forms. It has white cheeks and throat, like B. i. ibis, but the nuptial plumes are golden, as with B. i. coromandus. Individuals with abnormally grey, melanistic plumages have been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Generally duller and paler, {{the female}} {{has a more}} uniform and paler blue face, with highly {{contrasting}} cream bare skin around the eye. It lacks the red shoulder band, and the blue shoulder markings are darker and less distinct. The <b>throat</b> <b>and</b> chest are pale green and the belly is yellow. The upper mandible is paler brown-grey with a darker tip, and has been recorded as black while nesting. The lower mandible is pale grey to almost white. When flying, the female has a broad white bar visible on the underwing.|$|E

Dioscorides recommended it for diseases of the lung {{and it is now}} widely available in health and herbal stores. Non-medical uses have included dyeing and making torches.|$|E

50|$|The {{throating}} issue exists {{because in}} the USA it has been traditional to have short chambers so that the bullet is being engraved {{at the moment of}} insertion. European practice has more of a forcing cone construction which can, by itself, allow significantly higher chamber pressure. All Sig-Sauer handguns (for example) have European <b>throating</b> <b>and</b> all are certified to fire +P ammunition. Short <b>throating</b> <b>and</b> unnoticed bullet setback can easily increase chamber pressures by more than 10,000 psi.|$|R
5|$|Pathogenic fungi cause {{a variety}} of {{diseases}} in humans and livestock. Aspergillosis, most commonly caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, kills some 600,000 people per year, mostly those with already weakened immune systems. Pneumocystis causes pneumonia, again mainly in people with weakened immune systems. Candida yeasts are the agents of Candidiasis, causing infections of the mouth, <b>throat,</b> <b>and</b> genital tract, and more seriously of the blood. Ringworm is a skin infection that infects some 20% of the human population; it is caused by some 40 different fungi.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans swim {{well with}} their strong legs and their webbed feet. They rub {{the backs of}} their heads on their preen glands to pick up an oily secretion, which they {{transfer}} to their plumage to waterproof it. Holding their wings only loosely against their bodies, pelicans float with relatively little of their bodies below the water surface. They dissipate excess heat by gular flutter â€“ rippling the skin of the <b>throat</b> <b>and</b> pouch with the bill open to promote evaporative cooling. They roost and loaf communally on beaches, sandbanks and in shallow water.|$|E
5|$|S.e.caesia, {{the most}} {{widespread}} of the western subspecies, has orange-buff underparts except for a white <b>throat</b> <b>and</b> cheeks. The other western forms mainly differ in the exact shade of the underparts, although some southeastern forms also show a white forehead and supercilium. S.e.sinensis and S.e.formosana, of China and Taiwan respectively, have buff underparts like the western races, but have buff, instead of white, throats.|$|E

5|$|Systemic {{symptoms}} {{resulting from}} anaphylaxis can be dramatic. These may appear within 5 minutes post bite, {{or can be}} delayed for many hours. Such symptoms include nausea, retching and vomiting, abdominal colic and diarrhoea, incontinence of urine and faeces, sweating, fever, vasoconstriction, tachycardia, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, blindness, shock, angioedema of the face, lips, gums, tongue, <b>throat</b> <b>and</b> epiglottis, urticaria and bronchospasm. If left untreated, these symptoms may persist or fluctuate for up to 48 hours. In severe cases, cardiovascular failure may occur.|$|E
5|$|Tabram {{was killed}} on 7 August 1888; she had {{suffered}} 39 stab wounds. The savagery of the murder, the lack of obvious motive, and {{the closeness of the}} location (George Yard, Whitechapel) and date to those of the later Ripper murders led police to link them. The attack differs from the canonical murders in that Tabram was stabbed rather than slashed at the <b>throat</b> <b>and</b> abdomen, and many experts do not connect it with the later murders because of the difference in the wound pattern.|$|E
