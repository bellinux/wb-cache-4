5|$|Bach {{performed}} the cantata {{at least three}} times, first on 8 October 1724, a second time probably on 24 October 1734 when the sopranino {{was replaced by a}} violino piccolo, and a third time probably on 1 October 1740. The Bach scholar Christoph Wolff suggested performances in 1744/47, Klaus Hofmann in 1747, when the corno part was given to a <b>trombone.</b>|$|E
5|$|Guitarist Jeff Tweedy {{provided}} the lead vocals for the album and John Stirratt, {{the only other}} original member of the band, played bass guitar and added backing vocals. Lead guitarist Nels Cline and multi-instrumentalist Pat Sansone performed here on a Wilco album for the first time. Glenn Kotche performed on the drums and other percussion instruments, and Mikael Jorgensen played keyboards. Other instrumentation was provided by Patrick Newbery (trumpet and flugelhorn), Nick Broste (<b>trombone),</b> and Rick Parenti (baritone sax).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his work with The Wiggles, John founded The John Field Band, an eight-piece covers band with John on lead vocals, Bernadette Cogin on lead vocals (later replaced by Bronwyn Mulcahy), Dom Lindsay on trumpet, former Cockroaches member Dan Fallon on tenor saxophone, Roy Ferin on <b>trombone,</b> Mark Rohanna on piano, Matt Morrison on drums, and Chris Lupton on bass guitar.

50|$|German {{composer}} Johann Rudolf Ahle wrote {{some notable}} sacred pieces for voices and <b>trombones.</b> Höre, Gott uses five favoriti singers, two ripieno choirs (which double other parts at intense moments) and seven <b>trombones,</b> with basso continuo. And {{his most famous}} Neu-gepflanzte Thüringische Lust-Garten.. (1657-65) contains several sacred works with 3 or 4 <b>trombones,</b> including Magnificat a 8 for SATB soloists, cornett, 3 <b>trombones</b> and continuo and Herr nun lässestu deinen Diener a 5 for bass, 4 <b>trombones</b> and continuo.|$|R
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in six movements. The {{text and}} tune of the hymn are {{retained in the}} outer choral movements, a chorale fantasia and a four-part closing chorale, which frame two sets of recitative and aria. Bach scored the work for four vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor, bass), a four-part choir, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of four trombones (Tb), two oboes (Ob), two violins (Vl), viola (Va) and basso continuo. This {{is one of three}} Bach cantatas to use four different <b>trombone</b> parts (soprano, alto, tenor, and bass), the others being Ach Gott, vom Himmel sieh darein, BWV 2 and Ich hatte viel Bekümmernis, BWV 21. The instruments play colla parte with the voices in the outer movements in the style of Bach's motets.|$|E
5|$|Corythosaurus {{is known}} from many {{complete}} specimens, including the nearly complete holotype found by Brown in 1911. The holotype skeleton is only missing {{the last section}} of the tail, {{and part of the}} forelimbs, but was preserved with impressions of polygonal scales. Corythosaurus is known from many skulls with tall crests. The crests resemble the crests of the cassowary and a Corinthian helmet. The most likely function of the crest is thought to be vocalization. As in a <b>trombone,</b> sound waves would travel through many chambers in the crest, and then get amplified when Corythosaurus exhaled. A Corythosaurus specimen has been preserved with its last meal in its chest cavity. Inside the cavity were remains of conifer needles, seeds, twigs, and fruits: Corythosaurus probably fed on all of these.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 Byard was {{the subject}} of a short {{documentary}} film, Anything for Jazz, which featured him playing, teaching and with his family. By the 1980s his main instrument remained the piano, and he still played both alto and tenor saxophones, but he had stopped playing the other instruments that he used to use professionally – bass, drums, guitar, <b>trombone,</b> and trumpet, although he still taught all of them. In the same period, he was often heard in New York playing solo, in duos, or in trios. In 1988 he played with a band founded by Mingus' widow to perform the bassist's compositions – the Mingus Big Band. Byard played and recorded with a former student of his, Ricky Ford, from 1989 to 1991, and continued to play and teach during the 1990s.|$|E

5|$|In Grove, Nichols {{divides the}} chamber works into three clearly {{differentiated}} periods. The first four sonatas {{come from the}} early group, all written before Poulenc was twenty-two. They are for two clarinets (1918), piano duo (1918), clarinet and bassoon (1922) and horn, trumpet and <b>trombone</b> (1922). They are early examples of Poulenc's many and varied influences, with echoes of rococo divertissements alongside unconventional harmonies, some influenced by jazz. All four are characterised by their brevity– less than ten minutes each– their mischievousness and their wit, which Nichols describes as acid. Other chamber works from this period are the Rapsodie nègre, FP 3, from 1917 (mainly instrumental, with brief vocal episodes) and the Trio for oboe, bassoon and piano (1926).|$|E
5|$|Spouge is a {{style of}} Barbadian popular music created by Jackie Opel in the 1960s. It is {{primarily}} a fusion of Jamaican ska with Trinidadian calypso, but is also influenced by {{a wide variety of}} musics from the British Isles and United States, include sea shanties, hymns and spirituals. Spouge instrumentation originally consisted of cowbell, bass guitar, trap set and various other electronic and percussion instruments, later augmented by saxophone, <b>trombone</b> and trumpets. Of these, the cowbell and the guitar are widely seen as the most integral part of the instrumentation, and are said to reflect the African origin of much of Barbadian music.|$|E
5|$|String {{and wind}} {{instruments}} {{play an important}} role in Barbadian folk culture, especially the bow-fiddle, banjo and acoustic guitar; more modern groups also use an electric and bass guitar. The shukster is a distinctive instrument, made by stretching a guitar string between two sides of a house. Traditional Barbadian wind instruments are largely metal, but in their folk origins, were made out of locally found materials. Barbadian villagers burned fingerholes, for example, on bamboo tubes, made trumpets out of conch shells and pipes from pumpkin vines. Many modern groups use harmonica, accordion, alto and tenor saxophone, trumpet and <b>trombone.</b>|$|E

The percussion consists of marimba, vibraphone, glockenspiel, crotales, tubular bells, cow bells, bass drum, tam-tam, sizzle cymbal, suspended cymbal, mark-tree, Chinese bell-tree and wind-machine.|$|E
5|$|Wright, {{whose father}} was head {{biochemist}} at Unigate Dairies, grew up in Hatch End, Middlesex, and was educated at the Haberdashers' Aske's School. He taught himself to play guitar, trumpet and piano at age 12 after he was recuperating from breaking a leg. His mother helped and encouraged him to play the piano. He took private lessons in musical theory and composition at the Eric Gilder School of Music and became influenced by the trad jazz revival, learning the <b>trombone</b> and saxophone {{as well as the}} piano. Uncertain about his future, he enrolled in 1962 at the Regent Street Polytechnic which was later incorporated into the University of Westminster. There he met fellow musicians Roger Waters and Nick Mason, and all three joined a band formed by classmate Clive Metcalf called Sigma 6.|$|E

5|$|Byard {{began playing}} professionally on piano {{at the age}} of 16, in bands led by Doc Kentross and Freddy Bates. His early lessons had {{involved}} mostly playing by rote, so his development of knowledge of theory and further piano technique occurred from the late 1930s until 1941, including studying harmony at Commerce High School. In that year he was drafted into the army, where he continued with piano lessons and was influenced by pianist Ernie Washington, with whom he was barracked, although Byard also took up <b>trombone</b> at this time. He also studied Stravinsky and Chopin, and continued studying classical composers into the 1960s. Part of his military service was in Florida, where he was a mentor to the young saxophonist Cannonball Adderley and his brother, Nat. After leaving the army in 1946, Byard's musical education continued, through discussions with others, and using library materials combined with music school syllabuses.|$|E
5|$|In {{his early}} pieces for the Bouffes-Parisiens, {{the size of}} the {{orchestra}} pit had restricted Offenbach to an orchestra of 16 players. He composed for flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, two horns, piston, <b>trombone,</b> timpani and percussion and a small string section of seven players. After moving to the Salle Choiseul he had an orchestra of 30 players. The musicologist and Offenbach specialist Jean-Christophe Keck notes that when larger orchestras were available, either in bigger Paris theatres or in Vienna or elsewhere, Offenbach would compose, or rearrange existing music, accordingly. Surviving scores show his instrumentation for additional wind and brass, and even extra percussion. When they were available he wrote for cor anglais, harp, and, exceptionally, Keck records, an ophicleide (Le Papillon), tubular bells (Le carnaval des revues), and a wind machine (Le voyage dans la lune).|$|E
5|$|John Philip Sousa {{was born}} in Washington, D.C., the third of ten {{children}} of João António de Sousa (John Anthony Sousa) (Seville, 22 September 1824 - 27 April 1892), who was of Portuguese and Spanish ancestry (son of João António de Sousa and wife Josefina Blanco, from Seville), and his wife Maria Elisabeth Trinkhaus (Darmstadt, 20 May 1826 - 25 August 1908), who was of Hessian ancestry (daughter of Peter Trinkhaus and wife Catherine Schafers). Sousa started his music education by playing the violin as a pupil of John Esputa and George Felix Benkert for harmony and musical composition {{at the age of}} six. He was found to have absolute pitch. During his childhood, Sousa studied voice, violin, piano, flute, cornet, baritone horn, <b>trombone,</b> and alto horn. When Sousa was 13, his father, a trombonist in the Marine Band, enlisted him in the United States Marine Corps as an apprentice to keep him from joining a circus band.|$|E
5000|$|... 'Saul' is {{composed}} for soloists and chorus, two flutes, two oboes, two trumpets, three trombones,kettledrums, organ,harp, continuo instruments, and strings. The work {{begins and ends}} in C major, a key choice {{which may have been}} influenced by the presence of <b>trombones</b> in the orchestra. Handel's other work of the same season to use <b>trombones,</b> Israel in Egypt, also favours C major for the choruses with <b>trombones</b> in their accompaniment.|$|R
50|$|Monteverdi {{arrived at}} St. Mark's in 1613 {{and it is}} unsurprising that he {{includes}} <b>trombones</b> and strings for several more sacred works during his time here, published in his Selva Morale e Spirituale 1641. Of the c.40 items in this collection, six specify three or four <b>trombones</b> (or viola da braccio, ad lib): SV268 Beatus vir I, SV263 Dixit Dominus I, SV263 Dixit Dominus II, SV261 Et iterum venturus est, SV258 Gloria in excelsis Deo, SV281 Magnificat I. Each is for 3-8 voices with 3 violins (apart from SV261), the trombones/violas and basso continuo. Monteverdi also specified <b>trombones</b> in two more sacred works: SV198 Laetatus sum (i) (1650) for 6 voices, 2 violins, 2 <b>trombones</b> and bassoon and SV272 Laudate Dominum omnes gentes I (1641) for 5 voices ‘concertato’, 4 voice chorus ad lib, 4 viola da braccio or <b>trombones</b> and basso continuo.|$|R
