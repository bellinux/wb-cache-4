5|$|Apollo 11 {{landed with}} less fuel than other missions, and the astronauts {{encountered}} a premature low fuel warning. This was later found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> greater propellant 'slosh' than expected, uncovering a fuel sensor.

5|$|Based on an {{observed}} excess {{emission of}} infrared radiation, Vega {{appears to have}} a circumstellar disk of dust. This dust is likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> collisions between objects in an orbiting debris disk, which is analogous to the Kuiper belt in the Solar System. Stars which display an infrared excess due to dust emission are termed Vega-like stars.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{this shift}} in thought about the {{underlying}} mechanisms in plantar fasciitis, many in the academic community have stated the condition should be renamed plantar fasciosis. The structural breakdown of the plantar fascia is believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> repetitive microtrauma (small tears). Microscopic examination of the plantar fascia often shows myxomatous degeneration, connective tissue calcium deposits, and disorganized collagen fibers.|$|E

5|$|The four giant {{planets are}} also orbited by {{planetary}} rings of varying size and complexity. The rings are composed primarily of dust or particulate matter, but can host tiny 'moonlets' whose gravity shapes and maintains their structure. Although {{the origins of}} planetary rings is not precisely known, they are believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> natural satellites that fell below their parent planet's Roche limit and were torn apart by tidal forces.|$|E
5|$|The molars are low-crowned (brachydont), with {{relatively}} rounded (bunodont) cusps running lengthwise (selenodont), {{resulting in a}} condition known as bunoselenodonty. The upper molars also lack a distinctive cusp (hypocone). Gheerbrant et al. noted these features and some others are shared with the pantodonts Haplolambda and Leptolambda, but due to many differences between the two, including number of teeth, the similarities are thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> convergent evolution.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} {{impurity}} in diamond is nitrogen, which can comprise up to 1% of a diamond by mass.

Most nitrogen enters the diamond lattice as a single atom (i.e. nitrogen-containing molecules dissociate before incorporation), however, molecular nitrogen incorporates into diamond as well.|$|E

5|$|Château Gaillard {{consists}} of three baileys—an inner, a middle, and an outer with the main entrance to the castle—and a keep, also called a donjon, in the inner-bailey. The baileys, which were separated by rock-cut ditches, housed the castle's stables, workshops, and storage facilities. It is common for extant castles <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> several phases of construction, and were adapted and added to over the period of their use; however Château Gaillard essentially {{is the result of}} one period of building. The division into three wards bears similarities with the design of Château de Chinon, built by HenryII in the mid-12thcentury on a promontory overlooking a town.|$|E
5|$|During {{the seventeenth}} century the bonshō was also a symbol of a temple's leadership; {{possession}} of the bell indicated ownership of the associated temple. As a result, bells were often stolen; the folk hero Benkei {{is said to have}} dragged the three-ton bell of Mii-dera temple up Mount Hiei during one such theft. The deep scratches in the Benkei bell, which is still displayed at Mii-dera, are said in the legend <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> Benkei's kicking the bell {{all the way back to}} the monastery when he discovered that it would not toll for him. The Benkei bell is also associated with the legendary hero Tawara Tōda, who originally donated it to the Mii-dera temple. He acquired it as a gift from the dragon deity Ryūjin, after saving the god from a giant centipede.|$|E
5|$|French typefounders of the 16th century assiduously {{examined}} Manutius's work (and, it is thought, De Aetna in particular) as {{a source}} of inspiration. This examination extended to in some cases copying his first 'M' shown in De Aetna which had no serif pointing out of the letter at top right, a design considered very eccentric. (It has been suggested <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> defective casting, especially since Manutius' later fonts do not show it.) The Griffo font was only cut in a single size, so French punchcutters made modified versions of the design to suit different sizes, with a more delicate structure at larger sizes.|$|E

5|$|In a {{paper by}} Carlos and Raul de la Fuente Marcos {{evidence}} is shown {{for a possible}} bimodal distribution of the distances to the ascending nodes of the ETNOs. This correlation is unlikely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> observational bias since it also appears in the nodal distribution of large semi-major axis centaurs and comets.

5|$|Killer whales {{have also}} been {{observed}} preying on terrestrial mammals, such as deer swimming between islands off the northwest coast of North America. Killer whale cannibalism has also been reported based on analysis of stomach contents, but this is likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> scavenging remains dumped by whalers. One killer whale was also attacked by its companions after being shot. Although resident killer whales have never been observed to eat other marine mammals, they occasionally harass and kill porpoises and seals for no apparent reason.|$|E
5|$|Low {{back pain}} {{is not a}} {{specific}} disease but rather a complaint that {{may be caused by}} a large number of underlying problems of varying levels of seriousness. The majority of LBP does not have a clear cause but is believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> non-serious muscle or skeletal issues such as sprains or strains. Obesity, smoking, weight gain during pregnancy, stress, poor physical condition, poor posture and poor sleeping position may also contribute to low back pain. A full list of possible causes includes many less common conditions. Physical causes may include osteoarthritis, degeneration of the discs between the vertebrae or a spinal disc herniation, broken vertebra(e) (such as from osteoporosis) or, rarely, an infection or tumor of the spine.|$|E

25|$|The {{physical}} {{composition of}} asteroids is varied {{and in most}} cases poorly understood. Ceres appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> composed of a rocky core covered by an icy mantle, where Vesta <b>is</b> thought <b>to</b> have a nickel-iron core, olivine mantle, and basaltic crust. 10 Hygiea, however, which appears to have a uniformly primitive composition of carbonaceous chondrite, <b>is</b> thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> largest undifferentiated asteroid.

5|$|Many {{people in}} Halifax at first {{believed}} the explosion <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> a German attack. The Halifax Herald continued to propagate this belief for some time, for example reporting that Germans had mocked {{victims of the}} explosion. While John Johansen, the Norwegian helmsman of Imo, was being treated for serious injuries sustained during the explosion, it was reported to the military police {{that he had been}} behaving suspiciously. Johansen was arrested on suspicions of being a German spy when a search turned up a letter on his person, supposedly written in German. It turned out that the letter was actually written in Norwegian. Immediately following the explosion, most of the German survivors in Halifax had been rounded up and imprisoned. Eventually the fear dissipated as the real cause of the explosion became known, although rumours of German involvement persisted.|$|E
5|$|Muscle biopsy can {{be useful}} if an episode of {{rhabdomyolysis}} is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> an underlying muscle disorder. A biopsy sample taken during an episode is often uninformative, as it will show only evidence of cell death or may appear normal. Taking the sample is therefore delayed for several weeks or months. The histopathological appearance on the biopsy indicates {{the nature of the}} underlying disorder. For instance, mitochondrial diseases are characterized by ragged red fibers. Biopsy sites may be identified by medical imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging, as the muscles may not be uniformly affected.|$|E
5|$|Population {{studies from}} {{numerous}} {{areas in the}} world have shown that HHT occurs at roughly the same rate in almost all populations: somewhere around 1 in 5000. In some areas, it is much more common; for instance, in the French region of Haut Jura the rate is 1:2351 - twice as common as in other populations. This has been attributed to a founder effect, in which a population descending from a small number of ancestors has a high rate of a particular genetic trait because one of these ancestors harbored this trait. In Haut Jura, this has been shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> a particular ACVRL1 mutation (named c.1112dupG or c.1112_1113insG). The highest rate of HHT is 1:1331, reported in Bonaire and Curaçao, two islands in the Caribbean belonging to the Netherlands Antilles.|$|E
