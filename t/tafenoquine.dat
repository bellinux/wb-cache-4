40|$|Abstract Background <b>Tafenoquine</b> is an 8 -aminoquinoline being {{developed}} for radical cure (blood and liver stage elimination) of Plasmodium vivax. During monotherapy treatment, the compound exhibits slow parasite and fever clearance times, and toxicity in glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) deficiency is a concern. Combination with other antimalarials may mitigate these concerns. Methods In 2005, the radical curative efficacy of <b>tafenoquine</b> combinations {{was investigated in}} Plasmodium cynomolgi -infected naïve Indian-origin Rhesus monkeys. In the first cohort, groups of two monkeys were treated with a three-day regimen of <b>tafenoquine</b> at different doses alone and in combination with a three-day chloroquine regimen to determine the minimum curative dose (MCD). In the second cohort, the radical curative efficacy of a single-day regimen of tafenoquine-mefloquine was {{compared to that of}} two three-day regimens comprising <b>tafenoquine</b> at its MCD with chloroquine or artemether-lumefantrine in groups of six monkeys. In a final cohort, the efficacy of the MCD of <b>tafenoquine</b> against hypnozoites alone and in combination with chloroquine was investigated in groups of six monkeys after quinine pre-treatment to eliminate asexual parasites. Plasma <b>tafenoquine,</b> chloroquine and desethylchloroquine concentrations were determined by LC-MS in order to compare doses of the drugs to those used clinically in humans. Results The total MCD of <b>tafenoquine</b> required in combination regimens for radical cure was ten-fold lower (1. 8 mg/kg versus 18 mg/kg) than for monotherapy. This regimen (1. 8 mg/kg) was equally efficacious as monotherapy or in combination with chloroquine after quinine pre-treatment to eliminate asexual stages. The same dose of (1. 8 mg/kg) was radically curative in combination with artemether-lumefantrine. <b>Tafenoquine</b> was also radically curative when combined with mefloquine. The MCD of <b>tafenoquine</b> monotherapy for radical cure (18 mg/kg) appears to be biologically equivalent to a 600 - 1200 mg dose in humans. At its MCD in combination with blood schizonticidal drugs (1. 8 mg/kg), the maximum observed plasma concentrations were substantially lower than (20 - 84 versus 550 - 1, 100 ng/ml) after administration of 1, 200 mg in clinical studies.

40|$|<b>Tafenoquine</b> is an investigational 8 -aminoquinoline for the {{prevention}} of Plasmodium vivax relapse. <b>Tafenoquine</b> has a long half-life and the potential for more convenient dosing, compared with the currently recommended 14 -day primaquine regimen. This randomized, active-control, double-blind trial was conducted in Bangkok, Thailand. Seventy patients with microscopically confirmed P. vivax were randomized (2 : 1) to <b>tafenoquine</b> 400 mg once daily for 3 days or 2500 mg total dose chloroquine phosphate (1500 mg chloroquine base) given over 3 days plus primaquine 15 mg daily for 14 days. Patients were followed to day 120. Day 28 adequate clinical response rate in the per-protocol population was 93 % (40 / 43) (90 %CI 83 - 98 %) with <b>tafenoquine,</b> and 100 % (22 / 22) (90 %CI 87 - 100 %) with chloroquine/primaquine. Day 120 relapse prevention was 100 % (35 / 35) with <b>tafenoquine</b> (90 %CI 92 - 100 %), and 95 % (19 / 20) (90 %CI 78 - 100 %) with chloroquine/primaquine. Mean (SD) parasite, gametocyte and fever clearance times with <b>tafenoquine</b> were 82. 5 h (32. 3), 49. 1 h (33. 0), and 41. 1 h (31. 4) versus 40. 0 h (15. 7), 22. 7 h (16. 4), and 24. 7 h (17. 7) with chloroquine/primaquine, respectively. Peak methemoglobin was 1. 4 - 25. 6 % (median 7. 4 %, mean 9. 1 %) in the <b>tafenoquine</b> arm, and 0. 5 - 5. 9 % (median 1. 5 %, mean 1. 9 %) in the chloroquine/primaquine arm.

40|$|Background/Aims: The 8 -aminoquinoline <b>tafenoquine</b> {{has been}} shown to be {{effective}} against Plasmodia, Leishmania and Trypanosoma. The substance is at least in part effective by triggering apoptosis of the parasites. Similar to apoptosis, erythrocytes may enter suicidal death or eryptosis, which is characterized by cell shrinkage and cell membrane scrambling with phosphatidylserine translocation to the erythrocyte surface. Signaling involved in the regulation of eryptosis include increase of cytosolic Ca 2 + activity ([Ca 2 +]i), oxidative stress, ceramide, zVAD sensitive caspases, SB 203580 sensitive p 38 kinase, staurosporine sensitive protein kinase C as well as D 4476 sensitive casein kinase. The present study explored, whether <b>tafenoquine</b> induces eryptosis and aimed to possibly identify cellular mechanisms involved. Methods: Flow cytometry was employed to estimate phosphatidylserine exposure at the cell surface from annexin-V-binding, cell volume from forward scatter, [Ca 2 +]i from Fluo 3 -fluorescence, ROS formation from 2 ′, 7 ′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) dependent fluorescence, and ceramide abundance utilizing specific antibodies. Results: A 48 hours exposure of human erythrocytes to <b>tafenoquine</b> (500 ng/ml) significantly increased the percentage of annexin-V-binding cells, significantly decreased forward scatter, significantly increased Fluo 3 -fluorescence, and significantly increased DCFDA fluorescence. <b>Tafenoquine</b> did not significantly modify ceramide abundance. The effect of <b>tafenoquine</b> on annexin-V-binding was significantly blunted but not abolished by removal of extracellular Ca 2 +. The effect of <b>tafenoquine</b> on annexin-V-binding was not significantly blunted by zVAD (10 µM), SB 203580 (2 µM) or staurosporine (1 µM). The effect of <b>tafenoquine</b> on annexin-V-binding was significantly blunted but not abolished by D 4476 (10 µM). Conclusions: <b>Tafenoquine</b> triggers cell shrinkage and phospholipid scrambling of the erythrocyte cell membrane, an effect at least in part due to stimulation of Ca 2 + entry, oxidative stress and possibly activation of casein kinase...|$|E

The intersubject variability (coefficient of variation) in CL/F and V/F was 18 % and 22 %, respectively. The interoccasion variability in CL/F was 18 %, and the mean elimination half-life was 12. 7 days.

In an open-label study, 1512 Australian Defence Force personnel received one of three <b>tafenoquine</b> 3 d regimens [400 mg once daily (od), 200 mg twice daily (bid), 200 mg od] or daily primaquine (22. 5 mg) plus doxycycline (100 mg) over 14 d in Bougainville and in Timor-Leste for post-exposure prophylaxis. The relapse rate of subjects treated in Bougainville with <b>tafenoquine</b> (n = 173) was 1. 2 % (200 mg bid × 3 d) and 2. 3 % (400 mg od × 3 d), while primaquine plus doxycycline (n = 175) was 3. 4 %. For subjects treated in Timor-Leste with <b>tafenoquine</b> (n = 636), the relapse rate was 4. 9 % (200 mg od × 3 d), 5. 3 % (200 mg bid × 3 d) and 11. 0 % (400 mg od × 3 d), while primaquine plus doxycycline (n = 289) was 10. 0 %. The most frequent adverse events reported across all groups were nausea, abdominal distress and diarrhoea. There was a dose-dependent reduction in adverse events with a reduced dose of <b>tafenoquine,</b> with the lowest dose (total 600 mg over 3 d) producing rates of adverse events equivalent to that of primaquine plus doxycycline. The much shorter dosing regimen of <b>tafenoquine</b> should increase compliance, which is often suboptimal with primaquine after leaving an endemic area.

40|$|<b>Tafenoquine</b> is an 8 -aminoquiniline {{related to}} {{primaquine}} with preclinical activity against {{a range of}} malaria species. We treated two acute cases of vivax malaria with <b>tafenoquine</b> (800 mg over three days) atone, instead of conventional chloroquine (1500 mg over three days) and primaquine (420 mg over 14 days). In addition to the convenience of this regimen, the rapid parasite clearances observed, coupled with a good clinical response and lack of recrudescence or relapse, indicate that further investigation of <b>tafenoquine</b> {{in the treatment of}} vivax malaria is warranted.

40|$|Abstract. Emergence {{and spread}} of {{drug-resistant}} falciparum malaria {{has created an}} urgent demand for alternative therapeutic agents. This {{study was conducted to}} assess the in vitro blood schizontocidal activity of <b>tafenoquine,</b> the most advanced candidate drug of the 8 -aminoquinolines, and of its 1 : 1 combination with artemisinin in fresh isolates of Plasmodium falciparum in an area with multi-drug resistance, measuring the inhibition of schizont maturation. In 43 successfully tested parasite isolates, the mean effective concentrations (ECs) of <b>tafenoquine</b> were 209 nmol/L for the EC 50, and 1, 414 nmol/L for the EC 90. <b>Tafenoquine</b> showed no significant activity relationships with mefloquine, arte-misinin, and chloroquine. With quinine, a highly significant activity relationship was observed at the EC 50, but not at the EC 90. The EC 50 and EC 90 of the tafenoquine-artemisinin combination were 15. 9 nmol/L and 84. 3 nmol/L. The combi-nation was synergistic. <b>Tafenoquine</b> appears to be a promising candidate for treating multidrug-resistant falciparum malaria, especially in combination with artemisinin derivatives...|$|E
40|$|In an open-label {{sequential}} cohort study, {{we compared}} gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances and plasma <b>tafenoquine</b> concentrations after administration of single-dose (400 mg daily × 3 days; n = 76 males, 11 females) and split-dose (200 mg twice daily × 3 days; n = 73 males, 13 females) <b>tafenoquine</b> regimens in healthy Australian Defence Force volunteers for post-exposure malaria prophylaxis. The {{female and male}} volunteers had comparable demographic characteristics (age, weight, height) in the single- and split-dose treatment groups. GI disturbances were generally mild and self-limiting for both groups. The frequency of nausea and abdominal distress was over two-fold higher in females than in males for both treatment groups. Reporting of GI disturbances in the single-dose group differed significantly between males and females, but this gender difference was not seen for the split-dose group. In those volunteers who experienced GI disturbances, the mean plasma <b>tafenoquine</b> concentrations 12 h after the last dose of <b>tafenoquine</b> were approximately 1. 3 -fold higher in females than in males (means ± SD: 737 ± 118 ng/ml vs. 581 ± 113 ng/ml). These preliminary findings suggest that further studies are required in {{a larger number of}} females to determine whether {{there is a need to}} reduce the dose of <b>tafenoquine</b> to minimise GI disturbances in females...|$|E
40|$|Background/Aims: The 8 -aminoquinoline <b>tafenoquine</b> {{has been}} shown to be {{effective}} against Plasmodia, Leishmania and Trypanosoma. The substance is at least in part effective by triggering apoptosis of the parasites. Moreover, <b>tafenoquine</b> {{has been shown}} to trigger eryptosis, the suicidal erythrocyte death characterized by cell shrinkage and cell membrane scrambling with phosphatidylserine translocation to the erythrocyte surface. The effect of <b>tafenoquine</b> on eryptosis is in part due to stimulation of Ca 2 + entry and oxidative stress. Ca 2 + entry is a critical event in the activation of blood platelets by thrombin and collagen related peptide (CRP). The present study explored, whether <b>tafenoquine</b> influences Ca 2 + entry, activation and apoptosis of blood platelets. Methods: Platelets isolated from wild-type mice were exposed for 30 minutes to <b>tafenoquine</b> (2. 5 µg/ml) without or with an additional treatment with thrombin (0. 01 U/ml) or CRP (2 µg/ml or 5 µg/ml). Flow cytometry was employed to estimate cytosolic Ca 2 +-activity ([Ca 2 +]i) from Fluo- 3 fluorescence, platelet degranulation from P-selectin abundance, integrin activation from αIIbβ 3 integrin abundance, phosphatidylserine abundance from annexin-V-binding, relative platelet volume from forward scatter, reactive oxygen species (ROS) from DCF fluorescence, caspase 3 activity with an active caspase- 3 Staining kit, and aggregation utilizing staining with CD 9 -APC and CD 9 -PE. Results: Both, thrombin (0. 01 U/ml) and CRP (2 µg/ml or 5 µg/ml), significantly increased [Ca 2 +]i, P-selectin abundance, active αIIbβ 3 integrin, and annexin-V-binding, and both significantly decreased platelet volume, activated caspase 3 and stimulated aggregation. Administration of <b>tafenoquine</b> (2. 5 µg/ml, 30 min) significantly decreased [Ca 2 +]i both, in the absence and presence of thrombin and CRP. <b>Tafenoquine</b> significantly blunted the effect of thrombin and CRP on [Ca 2 +]i, P-selectin abundance, and active αIIbβ 3 integrin, but significantly increased ROS and annexin-V-binding, significantly augmented the effect of thrombin on caspase 3 activity and platelet volume and significantly enhanced platelet aggregation. Conclusions: <b>Tafenoquine</b> counteracts thrombin and CRP induced increase of cytosolic Ca 2 + activity and platelet activation, but enhances platelet apoptosis and platelet aggregation...|$|E
40|$|We tested <b>tafenoquine</b> (WR 238605), a new long-acting 8 -aminoquinoline, for {{its ability}} to prevent malaria in an area that is {{holoendemic}} for Plasmodium falciparum. In a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial in western Kenya, adult volunteers received a treatment course of 250 mg halofantrine per day for 3 days, to effect clearance of preexisting parasites. The volunteers were then assigned to 1 of 4 drug regimens: placebo throughout; 3 days of 400 mg (base) of <b>tafenoquine</b> per day, followed by placebo weekly; 3 days of 200 mg of <b>tafenoquine</b> per day, followed by 200 mg per week; and 3 days of 400 mg of <b>tafenoquine</b> per day, followed by 400 mg per week. Prophylaxis was continued for up to 13 weeks. Of the evaluable subjects (223 of 249 randomized subjects), volunteers who received 400 mg <b>tafenoquine</b> for only 3 days had a protective efficacy of 68 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 53 %- 79 %), as compared with placebo recipients; those who received 200 mg per day for 3 days followed by 200 mg per week had a protective efficacy of 86 % (95 % CI, 73 %- 93 %); and those who received 400 mg for 3 days followed by 400 mg per week had a protective efficacy of 89 % (95 % CI, 77 %- 95 %). A similar number of volunteers in the 4 treatment groups reported adverse events. Prophylactic regimens of 200 mg or 400 mg of <b>tafenoquine,</b> taken weekly for {{less than or equal to}} 13 weeks, are highly efficacious in preventing falciparum malaria and are well tolerated...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tafenoquine</b> is a {{promising}} new 8 -aminoquinoline drug {{that may be}} useful for malaria prophylaxis in nonpregnant persons with normal glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 PD) function. A randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled chemoprophylaxis trial was conducted with adult residents of northern Ghana to determine the minimum effective weekly dose of <b>tafenoquine</b> {{for the prevention of}} infection by Plasmodium falciparum. The primary end point was a positive malaria blood smear result during the 13 weeks of study drug coverage. Relative to the placebo, all 4 <b>tafenoquine</b> dosages demonstrated significant protection against P. falciparum infection: for 25 mg/week, protective efficacy was 32 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 20 %– 43 %); for 50 mg/week, 84 % (95 % CI, 75 %– 91 %); for 100 mg/week, 87 % (95 % CI, 78 %– 93 %); and for 200 mg/week, 86 % (95 % CI, 76 %– 92 %). The mefloquine dosage of 250 mg/week also demonstrated significant protection against P. falciparum infection (protective efficacy, 86 %; 95 % CI, 72 %– 93 %). There was little difference between study groups in the adverse events reported, and {{there was no evidence of}} a relationship between <b>tafenoquine</b> dosage and reports of physical complaints or the occurrence of abnormal laboratory parameters. <b>Tafenoquine</b> dosages of 50, 100, and 200 mg/week were safe, well tolerated, and effective against P. falciparum infection in this study population...|$|E
