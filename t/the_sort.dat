5|$|Alessandro Farnese, as Paul III, was {{the last}} of the popes {{appointed}} by the ruling Medici family of Florence. He was socially ambitious, a careerist and not particularly pious. He kept a concubine, fathered four children out of wedlock and viewed the throne as an opportunity to fill his coffers while he placed his relatives in high positions. A talented and cunning political operator, Paul was precisely <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> of man the Florentines needed to assist them in their defence against French and Spanish threats.|$|E

40|$|Internal sorting is {{a problem}} of finding the {{permutation}} from a list of numbers so that the applied permutation list is sorted. Many sorting algorithms make use of various techniques to accomplish <b>the</b> <b>sorting</b> task. Moreover distinct characteristics of a finite list are extensively studied to find <b>the</b> practical <b>sorting</b> algorithm. This paper exhibits the unknown characteristic called the successive difference that can be computed during <b>the</b> <b>sorting</b> process. This number uncovers the extreme value of <b>the</b> <b>sorted</b> list in <b>the</b> permutation space. <b>The</b> <b>sorted</b> list attains <b>the</b> minimum value for both ascending and descending sorting.

The word is translated to Latin as corrector but restitutor is another possible translation; the latter title was an honorary one meant to praise the bearer for driving enemies out of Roman territories. However, the inscription of Vaballathus is clearer as the word PNRTTʿ is not a Palmyrene word but a direct Palmyrene translation of the Greek term Epanorthotes which is usually an equivalent to corrector.|$|E

5|$|In September 1980, in the {{aftermath}} of the labor agreements, First Secretary Gierek was removed from office and replaced as party leader by Stanisław Kania. Kania made promises of <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> that Gomułka and Gierek had made when each came power. But whatever goodwill the new leader gained, it lasted for an even shorter period than it had been the case in 1956 and 1971, because there was no way that the regime could have kept the promises it had made at Gdańsk, even if it wanted to. The authorities were still trapped by the contradiction: if they followed economic necessity, they would generate political instability. GNP fell in 1979 by 2%, in 1980 by 8% and in 1981 by 15–20%.|$|E
5|$|In the {{tradition}} of sixteenth-century royal festivals, Catherine de' Medici's magnificences took place over several days, with a different entertainment each day. Often individual nobles or {{members of the royal}} family were responsible for preparing one particular entertainment. Spectators and participants, including those involved in martial sports, would dress up in costumes representing mythological or romantic themes. Catherine gradually introduced changes to {{the tradition}}al form of these entertainments. She forbade heavy tilting of <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> that led to the death of her husband in 1559; and she developed and increased the prominence of dance in the shows that climaxed each series of entertainments. As a result, the ballets de cour, a distinctive new art form, emerged from the creative advances in court entertainment devised by Catherine de' Medici.|$|E
5|$|Mention {{should also}} be made of Meyerbeer's intense concern with the {{business}} of opera, which indeed had formed part of his studies under Vogler. This gave him the background not only to deal with complex contractual issues and to negotiate with publishers, but extended to wooing the press and 'marketing' in general. Indeed, he was probably the originator of the 'press conference' at which journalists were fed refreshment and information. This marketing and commercialisation of opera was reinforced by Meyerbeer's Paris publisher Maurice Schlesinger who had established his fortune on the back of Robert, and even persuaded Honoré de Balzac to write a novella (Gambara) to promote Les Huguenots. Schlesinger's publication of Franz Liszt's Reminiscences de Robert le diable sold out on the day of issue and was immediately reprinted. Such manoeuvres did little to endear Meyerbeer to his fellow artists, and indeed engendered envious comments of <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> already quoted from Berlioz and Chopin.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} {{hardware}} architecture of a heapsort algorithm, <b>the</b> <b>sorting</b> is employed in a subband coding block of a wavelet-based image coder termed Öktem image coder [1].
