5|$|Loveless is {{the second}} studio album by Irish rock band My Bloody Valentine, {{released}} on 4 November 1991 by Creation Records. The album was recorded {{over a two-year period}} between 1989 and 1991. Vocalist and guitarist Kevin Shields dominated <b>the</b> <b>arduous</b> recording process; intent on achieving a particular sound, he experimented with texturised guitar tremolo techniques and tuning systems, unorthodox production methods, obscured vocals, and sampled percussion and feedback. The group cycled through nineteen studios and a larger number of engineers during the album's two-year creation, with total recording costs rumoured to have reached £250,000.|$|E

5|$|The film {{is set in}} the Victorian {{period of}} India's colonial British Raj.

The narrative spins around this situation as the villagers face <b>the</b> <b>arduous</b> task of learning the alien game and playing for a result that will change their village's destiny.|$|E
5|$|Ferrell {{was once}} again traded; this time he {{returned}} to the Senators in March1944.

Dutch Leonard, Johnny Niggeling, Roger Wolff, and Mickey Haefner all threw the notoriously difficult-to-catch knuckleball, making Ferrell the first catcher in major league history to accomplish the feat. Although Ferrell led the league in passed balls due to the unpredictability of the knuckleball, he was still named to his seventh All-Star Game. The Senators ended the season in last place while Ferrell's former team, the St. Louis Browns won the 1944American League pennant.|$|E

5|$|The {{characterization}} of Neville Sinclair {{was inspired by}} movie star Errol Flynn, or rather by the image of Flynn that had been popularized by Charles Higham's unauthorized and fabricated biography of the actor, in which he asserted that Flynn was, among other things, a Nazi spy. The film's Neville Sinclair is, like Higham's Flynn, a movie star known {{for his work in}} swashbuckler roles, and who is secretly a Nazi spy. Because Higham's biography of Flynn was not refuted until the late 1980s, the image of Flynn as a closet Nazi remained current all through <b>the</b> <b>arduous</b> process of writing and re-writing the script. The other real-life characterization was of Howard Hughes.|$|E
5|$|When Atkinson {{arrived back}} at Cape Evans from the Beardmore Glacier {{at the end}} of January, he was the senior officer present and thus in command of the base camp, a role to which he was not accustomed. Terra Nova arrived from her winter mooring in New Zealand on 9 February, and instead of setting off for Scott, Atkinson used the shore party for <b>the</b> <b>arduous</b> task of {{unloading}} the ship – a mistake, Cherry-Garrard thought, since these men might be required to sledge again. Belatedly, on 13 February, Atkinson set out with Dimitri Gerov and the dog teams for the scheduled meeting with Scott on the Barrier, arriving and pausing at Hut Point on 19 February.|$|E
5|$|From the lake, Cortés {{continued}} on <b>the</b> <b>arduous</b> journey {{south along the}} western slopes of the Maya Mountains, during which he lost most of his horses. The expedition became lost in the hills north of Lake Izabal and came close to starvation before they captured a Maya boy who led them to safety. Cortés found a village {{on the shore of}} Lake Izabal, and crossed the Dulce River to the settlement of Nito, somewhere on the Amatique Bay, with about a dozen companions, and waited there {{for the rest of his}} army to regroup over the next week. By this time the remnants of the expedition had been reduced to a few hundred; Cortés succeeded in contacting the Spaniards he was searching for, only to find that Cristóbal de Olid's own officers had already put down his rebellion. Cortés then returned to Mexico by sea.|$|E

5|$|The Medina {{holds the}} tombs {{of the seven}} patron saints of Morocco, which are visited every year by pilgrims during the week-long ziara pilgrimage. According to tradition, it is {{believed}} that these saints are only sleeping and will awaken one day to resume their good deeds. A pilgrimage to the tombs offers an alternative to the hajj to Mecca and Medina for people of western Morocco who could not visit Arabia due to <b>the</b> <b>arduous</b> and costly journey involved. Circumambulation of the tombs is undertaken by devotees to achieve inner purity. This ritual is performed on Fridays in the following ordained sequence: Sidi Yusuf ibn Ali Sanhaji, Sidi al-Qadi Iyyad al-Yahsubi, Sidi Bel Abbas, Sidi Mohamed ibn Sulayman al-Jazouli, Sidi Abdellaziz Tabba'a, Sidi Abdellah al-Ghazwani, and lastly, Sidi Abderrahman al-Suhayli. The most important of the seven tombs is the shrine of Sidi Bel Abbas.|$|E
5|$|The Trinity is {{a popular}} {{whitewater}} rafting and kayaking river. Dam releases for fish restoration have incidentally increased {{the amount of water}} available for boating year-round. The river has three main whitewater runs, all known for their scenery and wildlife. The Pigeon Point section, alongside Highway 299, contains Class II-III (beginner to intermediate) rapids. Below the takeout at Cedar Flat, the Trinity flows through the extremely hazardous Class V Burnt Ranch Gorge, which was first run in 1971 by three kayakers, one of whom {{died of a heart attack}} soon after finishing the run, due to <b>the</b> <b>arduous</b> work of portaging many rapids. This gave the area a bad reputation for many years; it was not until 1983 when commercial trips began on this section of the river. The lower Trinity, much of which flows through the Hoopa Valley Reservation, is a Class II river with gentler and lower gradient despite having a greater volume of water flow.|$|E
5|$|To {{prove their}} discoveries beyond any doubt, the Curies sought to isolate {{polonium}} and radium in pure form. Pitchblende {{is a complex}} mineral; the chemical separation of its constituents was an arduous task. The discovery of polonium had been relatively easy; chemically it resembles the element bismuth, and polonium was the only bismuth-like substance in the ore. Radium, however, was more elusive; it is closely related chemically to barium, and pitchblende contains both elements. By 1898 the Curies had obtained traces of radium, but appreciable quantities, uncontaminated with barium, were still beyond reach. The Curies undertook <b>the</b> <b>arduous</b> task of separating out radium salt by differential crystallization. From a ton of pitchblende, one-tenth of a gram of radium chloride was separated in 1902. In 1910, she isolated pure radium metal. She never succeeded in isolating polonium, which has a half-life of only 138 days.|$|E

5|$|England's first {{permanent}} {{settlement in}} the Americas was founded in 1607 in Jamestown, led by Captain John Smith and managed by the Virginia Company. Bermuda was settled and claimed by England {{as a result of}} the 1609 shipwreck of the Virginia Company's flagship, and in 1615 was turned over to the newly formed Somers Isles Company. The Virginia Company's charter was revoked in 1624 and direct control of Virginia was assumed by the crown, thereby founding the Colony of Virginia. The London and Bristol Company was created in 1610 with the aim of creating a permanent settlement on Newfoundland, but was largely unsuccessful. In 1620, Plymouth was founded as a haven for Puritan religious separatists, later known as the Pilgrims. Fleeing from religious persecution would become the motive of many English would-be colonists to risk <b>the</b> <b>arduous</b> trans-Atlantic voyage: Maryland was founded as a haven for Roman Catholics(1634), Rhode Island(1636) as a colony tolerant of all religions and Connecticut(1639) for Congregationalists. The Province of Carolina was founded in 1663. With the surrender of Fort Amsterdam in 1664, England gained control of the Dutch colony of New Netherland, renaming it New York. This was formalised in negotiations following the Second Anglo-Dutch War, in exchange for Suriname. In 1681, the colony of Pennsylvania was founded by William Penn. The American colonies were less financially successful than those of the Caribbean, but had large areas of good agricultural land and attracted far larger numbers of English emigrants who preferred their temperate climates.|$|E
5|$|Hernán Cortés only {{received}} sporadic {{reports of}} developing events in Honduras, and became impatient for its incorporation into his command. Hopeful of discovering new riches, {{he decided to}} travel to Honduras in person. Cortés left Tenochtitlan on 12 October 1524 with 140 Spanish soldiers, 93 of them mounted, 3,000 Mexican warriors, 150 horses, a herd of pigs, artillery, munitions and other supplies. En route, he recruited 600 Chontal Maya carriers. During <b>the</b> <b>arduous</b> journey from Lake Petén Itzá to Lake Izabal, both now in Guatemala, Cortés lost many men and horses. He crossed the Dulce River to the settlement of Nito, somewhere on the Amatique Bay, with about a dozen companions, where he found the near-starving remnants of González Dávila's colonists, who received him joyfully. Cortés waited there {{for the rest of}} his army to regroup over the next week, and explored the local area for supplies. By this time the remnants of Cortés' expedition were reduced to a few hundred. Cortés sent some of González Dávila's colonists south to the Naco Valley, which was swiftly pacified under the command of Gonzalo de Sandoval, one of Cortés' lieutenants. Cortés then abandoned attempts to colonise Nito, and sailed to Puerto de Caballos with his entire company.|$|E
