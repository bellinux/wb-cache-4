40|$|<b>Turbot</b> <b>and</b> <b>brill</b> {{are widely}} {{distributed}} in the Northeast Atlantic but occur at low abundance. They are ecologically very similar and closely related. The low abundance and the similarities make them particularly interesting to study the population dynamics because it raises the questions how the populations can sustain themselves at low abundances and how <b>turbot</b> <b>and</b> <b>brill</b> avoid strong interspecific competition. Knowledge of both species is hampered by lack of analysed data. The main objective {{of this study is}} therefore to increase the knowledge of <b>turbot</b> <b>and</b> <b>brill</b> and in particular to compare the two species in order to address the above questions. Based on biological samples collected in the North Sea, we calculated seasonal von Bertalanffy growth parameters, maturity ogives, monthly gonado-somatic indices (GSI) and condition factors (Fulton's K) and indices of inter- and intraspecific mean crowding and compared the results for <b>turbot</b> <b>and</b> <b>brill.</b> The main differences between the two species were found in their spawning period, with brill having a more protracted spawning period. Brill also showed an earlier peak in their GSI values, suggesting an earlier start of their spawning period. The mean crowding showed that interspecific competition was lower than intraspecific competition. The exploitation pattern was also studied. <b>Turbot</b> <b>and</b> <b>brill</b> are exploited as a bycatch species in the mixed demersal fishery. We found that productivity is highest in areas where the maximum temperature is close to the optimal temperature for growth (16 – 18 °C) and landings decrease where salinity falls below ~ 5 psu (turbot) and ~ 15 psu (brill). Recent fishing mortality rates of North Sea turbot are around 0. 5 – 0. 7, but {{there is no indication that}} recruitment is impaired at low levels of spawning stock biomass.

Grampus also was to demonstrate the method of beam trawling used by European fishermen in the North Sea but not in the United States at the time to catch groundfish, and to spur the use of beam trawling by American commercial fishermen in the hope of increasing the monetary value of the American catch and to provide additional employment for men aboard American fishing vessels. The Fish Commission believed that groundfish species native to the waters off North America could be profitably fished even though they differed from the species found in European waters, and Grampus was to use beam trawling to test this idea.|$|R
40|$|Dissertação de mestrado, Engenharia Biológica, Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Universidade do Algarve, 2015 The skin, {{the largest}} organ of fish’s body and first barrier against {{external}} agents, plays {{a crucial role}} against environmental aggressions and is decisive in communication between individuals. Cutaneous lesions are common in fish and may result in an open door for infectious agents and originate osmotic stress, which can be life threatening for the animal. <b>Turbot</b> (Scophthalmus maximus) <b>and</b> <b>brill</b> (Scophthalmus rhombus) are two closely related congeneric species with striking differences in their skin, since turbot presents tubercles instead of the scales found in brill. In this work, gene expression analyses were performed in order to analyze the genetic differences in the skin response between the two species. Skin scraping areas (72 h after injury) from three biological replicates of each species were compared with normal skin areas from the same individuals. A previously reported 4 x 44 k Agilent turbot microarray was employed, after evaluating its suitability by comparison of the base sequence of common genes using bioinformatics. Skin-related genes from previous studies (1564 sequences) were taken as a reference to screen the <b>turbot</b> database <b>and</b> the oligo-probes in the microarray. Among them, 584 (~ 37 %) were present in the turbot database (e-value 200 fluorescence units) were identified in each (turbot: 15, 739; brill: 12, 393) and in both species (10, 065). Among them, 1750 differentially expressed genes (t-test p-value p 2) were detected in <b>brill,</b> 1461 in <b>turbot,</b> <b>and</b> 885 showed differences between species, respectively.

40|$|Commercial {{flatfish}} {{captured in}} demersal fisheries {{along the west}} coast of Ireland include quota species such as plaice (Pleuronectes platessa L), in addition to high value non-quota species, turbot (Psetta maxima L.) and brill (Scophthalmus rhombus L.). Important non-commercial angling species of interest include flounder (Platichthys flesus L.). However, knowledge of the population dynamics of these flatfishes along {{the west coast of}} Ireland is lacking, and considered to be inadequate for the establishment of any population trends. In light of this, habitats along the west coast of Ireland serving as nursery grounds for the juveniles of these species were investigated (2000 - 2009). Correctly distinguishing between pairs of recently settled flatfish species, which are morphologically similar in appearance, was a prerequisite to this research. Counts of the meristic characters, fin rays, which are species specific, proved to be a reliable identification tool for juveniles. Plaice were the most abundant flatfish species present on nursery grounds, followed by turbot, {{and to a lesser extent}} brill. Assessment of nursery grounds over the eight year period, revealed both inter-annual and spatial variability in the relative abundance, growth, and condition of plaice, <b>turbot</b> <b>and</b> <b>brill.</b> Certain trends were revealed in these parameters, indicating the existence of both high and low quality nursery habitats. Abundances of both plaice and turbot on nursery grounds were negatively correlated with sea water temperatures during the pelagic stage. Baseline data on the timing of critical events, including hatching, larval durations, and settlement, in addition to growth experienced during early life, were established from the otolith microstructure of turbot. Post-settlement growth rate estimates of turbot also indicated certain locations as high quality nurseries. The feeding ecology of juvenile <b>turbot</b> <b>and</b> <b>brill</b> on nursery grounds was described, with temporal and resource partitioning revealed, implying that competition is unlikely to arise between these two morphologically similar species. A high incidence of prey was observed in the gut content of all <b>turbot</b> <b>and</b> <b>brill,</b> suggesting that food was not limited on Irish nursery grounds. Turbot fed on a much wider range of prey in contrast to brill, which fed almost exclusively on one prey organism. This observation may be one reason for the general sparse distribution of brill. The improved understanding of the early life history of plaice, <b>turbot</b> <b>and</b> <b>brill</b> may aid in the development and implementation of effective management strategies in the future; at the very least for the protection of important nursery grounds, as any loss, or decline in the quantity or quality of these areas, will undoubtedly have a negative impact on the recruitment of these species...|$|E
40|$|In the North Sea, turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) and brill (Scophthalmus rhombus) {{represent}} highly valuable {{species in}} commercial fisheries. Still, available data for both species are limited, making stock assessment difficult. Long-term fisheries data {{have the potential}} to improve the understanding of stock dynamics such as long-term distribution changes or development in species' abundances. Historical British otter trawler lpue (landings-per-unit-effort) data from 1923 to 2009, and at the spatial scale of ICES rectangles, revealed that the distribution patterns of <b>turbot</b> <b>and</b> <b>brill</b> were different for most of the 20 th century and only became similar in the recent decade. Further, between the 1920 s and 1960 s, turbot was commonly caught in the northern North Sea and in particular on Turbot Bank, at that time a turbot hotspot off the east coast of Scotland. Within a short time period turbot nearly disappeared from this region. Brill, in contrast, revealed a stable distribution in the southern and central North Sea with a slow expansion into the central North Sea. We used survey cpue (catch-per-unit-effort) from the International Bottom Trawl Survey (IBTS; 1970 – 2009) and the Beam Trawl Survey (BTS; 1985 – 2009), as well as British otter trawler lpue, as proxies for the abundance of adult <b>turbot</b> <b>and</b> <b>brill.</b> Commercial lpue suggested for brill and turbot a long-term decrease in abundance. IBTS cpue suggested an increase in abundance for turbot, but this was not confirmed by the BTS. For brill, both surveys did not show a clear trend...|$|E

If diet overlap did occur, it mainly involved prey species that are dominant in the surf zone of Belgian beaches, such as shrimps and mysids. These results suggest an opportunistic utilization by flatfish of the available food resources in surf zone ecosystems. Also, two strategically different feeding habits could be distinguished between the five flatfish species. <b>Turbot</b> <b>and</b> <b>brill</b> mainly fed on large, highly mobile prey (e. g. fish, mysids) and had a rather narrow prey spectrum, whereas plaice, dab and sole ate more benthic prey (e. g.

40|$|In the laboratory, the {{two species}} of copepods Lepeophtheirus thompsoni and Lepeophtheirus europaensis, ectoparasites of flatfishes, can meet and mate {{on at least one}} host species. In the wild however, these two species are found {{isolated}} on their sympatric hosts. Habitat selection theoretically represents a powerful enough mechanism to explain the maintenance of genetic heterogeneity in the wide sense. In this paper, the host colonization process is studied for both parasite species. It is shown that each parasite can develop and reach adult age on each host species. However, L. thompsoni is highly selective; it almost totally refuses to colonize hosts other than its natural one. Lepeophtheirus europaensis, on the contrary, readily infests <b>turbot</b> <b>and</b> <b>brill</b> in single-host experiments, but strongly prefers the brill when it has a choice. It appears that these two genetic entities are sympatrically maintained due to strong habitat selection. Such a pattern could theoretically only occur in a soft-selection context (density dependence).

40|$|As a {{contribution}} to the ecosystem approach to fisheries management, we estimated the effects of spawning closures on stock status, ecosystem impacts and economic performance. We focused on the flatfish fishery in the North Sea and explored how spawning closures for plaice and sole contribute to sustainable management of 4 target species (sole, plaice, <b>turbot</b> <b>and</b> <b>brill).</b> Seasonal patterns in fishing effort and catchability by age group and area were estimated to quantify the effect of different spawning closure scenarios on the selection pattern. The scenario performance was evaluated using indicators of stock status (spawning stock biomass), economic performance of the fishery (yield, revenue) and ecosystem impact (discards, bycatch of cod and rays, seabed integrity, fisheries-induced evolution). In a single-species context, spawning closures may be beneficial for the target species, while in a mixed fisheries and ecosystem context, negative effects may occur. A spawning closure for plaice combines positive effects on the plaice stock and the revenue with reductions of the negative impact for several ecosystem indicators and only a small negative effect on sea bed integrity. The effects did not differ when evaluated at current levels of effort or at maximum sustainable yield (MSY) effort. Tailor-made solutions are required that need to be developed in stakeholder consultation to trade-off the ecological and economic objectives. Mixed-species MSY was lower than the sum of the single-species MSYs...|$|E

40|$|Several commercially {{important}} {{demersal fish}} stocks for the North Sea fisheries {{are classified as}} “category 11 ” {{in the light of}} the EU policy paper on fisheries management (17 May 2010, COM(2010) 241). For stocks in this category, there is no STECF (Scientific, technical and economic committee for fisheries) management advice, due to the unknown status of the stocks. The reason for this is that the data and information available to perform analytical stock assessments are highly uncertain or lacking. This document describes existing data and options for collecting new data for the evaluation of the state of category 11 stocks. We focus on <b>turbot</b> <b>and</b> <b>brill</b> in the North Sea. Existing data from logbooks and the market sampling program can be used to estimate LPUE series used in age-based stock assessment methods, similar to other commercially important flatfish species such as plaice and sole. Landings Per Unit of Effort (LPUE) data of the Dutch beam trawl fleet > 221 kW were standardised for engine power and corrected for targeting behaviour as described below and graphically shown in Figure 3. 2. 1. The methods are similar to those used to analyse commercial LPUE data for North Sea plaice, described in Quirijns and Poos (2010). Landing rates (LPUE) by market category were calculated for the period 2002 - 2010. The corrected LPUE series indicate an increase in commercial LPUE for both species during the period 2002 - 2006. For turbot, the LPUE stays stable in the first five years, increases between 2006 and 2008, and decreases afterwards. The increase in brill LPUE is larger, and occurs throughout the study period. Compared to other commercially important flatfish species relatively few brill and turbot market samples are taken. This reduces the ability to track the cohorts in the LPUE series of the older ages which is a prerequisite for reliable stock assessment estimates. Also, the time series currently spans only 9 years. Collection of additional data may therefore be desirable. Expanding the BTS survey will provide industry independent data and would therefore give easily interpretable results. The option of an industry survey is also a good option if the survey is already being executed for sole and plaice. However, both options are costly. Therefore, the option of increasing the samples of <b>turbot</b> <b>and</b> <b>brill</b> at the auction is relatively easy and relatively inexpensive and therefore at present the most promising. The methods used for this document will not per definition be applicable for all category 11 species. For dab, flounder, lemon sole and tub gurnard, samples at the auctions are taken to collect biological data. For these species it may be possible to raise the data in a similar way as was done in this report to estimate the age composition of the stock. For other species (witch flounder, horse mackerel, silver smelt, red mullet and squid) there is no market sampling. For these species, other methods will have to be developed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract North Sea {{demersal}} fishes and fisheries {{have changed over}} the past 100 years. To detect the main factors driving these changes, long-term data are needed. Using historical fisheries data that extend throughout the 20 th century, this thesis aims to assess drivers influencing developments in fisheries as well as changes in the distribution and abundance of commercially important fishes in the North Sea. For English demersal fisheries, favourable political, technological and economical drivers were identified, inducing a vast rise in English fisheries {{in the first half}} of the 20 th century; however, the same drivers, acting adversely, influenced the decline in recent decades and the emphasis of fisheries shifted from England to Scotland. Different trends in distribution were observed for North Sea whiting, <b>turbot</b> <b>and</b> <b>brill</b> between the 1920 s and 2000 s. Whiting distribution shifted westward between the late 1940 s and 1960 s, whereas turbot nearly disappeared from the northern North Sea from the 1970 s onwards. Brill distribution remained rather stable in the central and southern North Sea. The reasons for the longitudinal shift of whiting remained unclear as the relationships to two potential drivers, climate change and fishing pressure, were not strong. For turbot, the cause for the near disappearance from the northern North Sea is inconclusive. Commercial fisheries data were assessed reliable for distribution analysis when comparing commercial data of whiting, a commonly discarded species, and unbiased survey data. Whiting, compared to flatfish, is of secondary commercial importance. In areas where discrepancies occurred between commercial and survey data, higher discarding of whiting is suggested, as highly priced flatfish are caught there. This thesis demonstrates past conditions of demersal fish populations and fisheries in the North Sea and presents the effects of different drivers on them. The documented changes in fishes and fisheries contain valuable information for resetting baselines and developing appropriate management strategies. *[N.

40|$|In 1883, Thomas Huxley {{put forward}} {{that all the}} great sea {{fisheries}} are inexhaustible. This illustrates the classical notion that marine environments tend to be demographically open without any chance of complete extinction. Such belief {{was based on the}} wide distribution of many marine species with extensive larval and adult dispersal, and large population sizes, even after heavy exploitation. However, the classical view of inexhaustible fisheries has proven incorrect after major declines in many world fisheries the last decades, prompting for a better understanding of fishery stock demography and connectivity using multidisciplinary approaches. Fisheries research has gained from the integration of genetic studies showing the various mechanisms explaining the evolution of population structure in the ocean. The resilience of fish populations and the maintenance of genetic diversity has important implications for the viability and stability of entire ecosystems under heavy exploitation. In this thesis, I aim at integrating novel knowledge on the genetic composition of flatfish stocks with fisheries management tools. Therefore, the genetic structure was investigated of the flatfish <b>turbot</b> <b>and</b> <b>brill,</b> in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean. A combination of conventional population genetic analyses and multivariate statistics was used to assess how environmental factors influence the genetic variation at various spatio-temporal scales. The focus was on several flatfish species with a synchronic sampling design. The seascape genetic approach made it possible to identify the interaction between oceanography and species-specific traits, and their effect on the true dispersal of the species. In the case of turbot, the combination of anonymous and gene-based nuclear markers proved useful for elucidating potential population units as each shows a different level of differentiation. This approach is highly valuable from a conservation perspective, as it allows one to infer the effect of community-wide fragmentation. Common geographic patterns were identified in the genetic structure. However, differences in sensitivity to gene flow barriers were reported. This discrepancy was driven by species-specific traits, particularly reproductive behavior. Within the Northeast Atlantic Ocean, I could distinguish two large groups: one comprising the Skagerrak-Kattegat area and a second along the Irish shelf. For turbot, another population might even be present in the Baltic Sea. Seascape genetic analyses based on putatively selective markers suggest an additional gene flow barrier within the North Sea, linked to the Friesian frontal zone. For a species like turbot, with a wider distribution range in the North Sea than flatfish such as sole and brill, the identification of this barrier has an important implication for the delineation of management units. At present, the incorporation of genetic data into statistical fisheries models has been limited. This is mainly because genetic research draws inferences about populations on an evolutionary time scale, while fisheries management is more interested in short-term demographic independence. Fisheries models usually lead management instruments towards short-term gains. But the long-term vision of sustainable fisheries management also needs to take evolutionary consequences into account. Our findings suggest that turbot could serve as a so-called umbrella species, i. e. a vulnerable species whose environmental requirements encapsulate the needs of most other species. It represents a foundation for appropriately managing seascapes in order to preserve diversity. Using turbot for that purpose has two advantages: 1) the impact of environmentally driven connectivity is most straightforward in turbot, and 2) turbot seems most vulnerable to the negative effects of fisheries and can therefore serve as the proverbial canary in the coal mine  an indicator of declining environmental quality. This implies that policymakers will have to make trade-offs to serve all marine stakeholders in the best possible way without jeopardising the long-term gains. Scientists can help to address these trade-offs. They can {{meet the needs of the}} stakeholders by communicating scientific results on all administrative levels as well as informing policy-makers of these results and the impact they may have on the ecosystem. Scientific research results are normally communicated via peer-reviewed publications and participation in conferences. At the same time, scientists must communicate through their national fisheries institutes, because these institutes play a key role in communicating between politicians, stakeholders and scientists. Such a communication strategy would not only transfer knowledge but will also help to tackle the problems related to a mismatch between the knowledge produced and the knowledge that policymakers actually need. Finally, it has become clear in recent years that unexpected management outcomes stem from human behavior related to uncertainty. The ecosystem is not yet sufficiently understood, and it shall never be completely understood because of its inherent variability and associated uncertainties. To address and reduce uncertainty, managers will have to incorporate information about resource user behavior provided by the social sciences. Such information depends largely on improved interdisciplinary communication among scientists. Often uncertainty in scientific results is reduced via the peer review process for high-level journals, usually restricted to a specific field. By expanding research to involve other disciplines and increasing efforts to improve communication between scientists and other actors, more and better knowledge will be produced and uncertainty will be further reduced. The ICES structure and workflow play a crucial role in creating an atmosphere for trans- and multi-disciplinary research. Working in a transnational context to stimulate interdisciplinary research and communication will encourage rapid and sure progress towards improved sustainability of sea fisheries. <w:latentstyles deflockedstate="false" defunhidewhenused="true"  <w:lsdexception="" locked="false" priority=" 0 " semihidden="false"  Table of contents Summary Samenvatting Abbreviations and definitions Chapter 1 General introduction and aims 1 Part I Chapter 2 Fylogeography of two congeneric species 27 Chapter 3 Regional Environmental pressure influences population differentiation in turbot 55 Chapter 4 Evaluating common environmental and biological drivers of population structure in commercial flatfish species 85 Part II Chapter 5 Global fisheries management 119 Chapter 6 Reform of the CFP and likely changes after revision of the Council and Parliament 157 Chapter 7 Why is the current management so challenging? 171 Chapter 8 The role of science 189 Chapter 9 General Discussion 199 Supplementary information 219 References 255 nrpages: 304 status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to compare the {{antioxidant}} systems in juvenile marine fish of commercial importance in European aquaculture, namely turbot (Scophthalmus maximus), halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) and gilthead sea bream (Sparus aurata). The present dietary trial was specifically designed to investigate the antioxidant effects of vitamin E under moderate oxidising conditions, including high dietary levels of highly unsaturated fatty acids and the feeding of oxidised oils. The objective was to induce a stressful pro-oxidant status to enable characterisation of the biochemical responses to peroxidative stress without causing unnecessary suffering to the experimental animals or high mortalities during the trials. Both sea bream <b>and</b> <b>turbot</b> showed excellent growth, whereas growth was poorer in halibut. Dietary oxidised oil significantly reduced growth in <b>turbot</b> <b>and</b> especially in halibut, but not in sea bream. Vitamin E improved growth in sea bream fed oxidised oil but not in turbot or halibut. However, vitamin E supplementation appeared to improve survival in all three species. In sea bream <b>and</b> <b>turbot,</b> liver antioxidant defence enzyme activities were generally increased by feeding peroxidised oil and reduced by vitamin E. Conversely, in halibut, the liver antioxidant defence enzyme activities were not increased by feeding peroxidised oil and only superoxide dismutase was reduced by feeding vitamin E. Consistent with these data, feeding oxidised oil increased lipid peroxidation products in halibut, but generally not in sea bream or turbot. Furthermore, lipid peroxidation products were generally reduced by dietary vitamin E in both sea bream <b>and</b> <b>turbot,</b> but not in halibut. Therefore, halibut liver antioxidant defence enzymes did not respond to dietary oxidised oil or vitamin E as occurred in <b>turbot</b> <b>and,</b> especially sea bream. This resulted in increased levels of lipid peroxides in halibut compared to <b>turbot</b> <b>and</b> sea bream in fish given dietary oxidised oil. In addition, supplemental vitamin E did not reduce lipid peroxides in halibut as it did in <b>turbot</b> <b>and</b> sea bream. The increased peroxidation stress in halibut may account for their poorer growth and survival in comparison to <b>turbot</b> <b>and</b> especially sea bream. Halibut were reared at a lower temperature, although relatively high for halibut, than either turbot or sea bream but they were also slightly younger/smaller fish and possibly, therefore, more developmentally immature, and either or all of these factors may be important in the lack of response of the liver enzymes in halibut...|$|R

40|$|<b>Turbot</b> (Psetta maxima) <b>and</b> {{flounder}} (Platichthys flesus) are {{two species}} of flatfish both having their nursery areas around the shores of Gotland in the Baltic Sea. The common brown shrimp (Crangon crangon) is a known predator on newly settled plaice (Pleuronectes platessa) in the North Sea area and {{is also found in}} the Baltic Sea. Experiments were carried out to see if the brown shrimp is predating on juvenile <b>turbot</b> <b>and</b> flounder, and if so on which sizes, and if the brown shrimp prefers any of the flatfish species, and also {{to see if there is}} a difference between day and night in density of the shrimp, i. e. when the fish might be subjected to predation. The results showed that predation decreased with size for both <b>turbot</b> <b>and</b> flounder. The brown shrimps prefer small flatfishes, size class < 30 mm, without any species preference. The shrimp abundance was higher during the night at one out of three locations around Gotland. More data is, however, needed to conclude that it is more active during the night...|$|R
