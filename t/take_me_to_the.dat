500|$|Several critics {{compared}} the song to {{the works of}} Spears. James Dinh of MTV News said that [...] "Gomez, who has gushed to us about her Spears fandom, shows off her best impersonation" [...] in the song. While reviewing the We Own the Night Tour, Kevin C. Johnson of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch said the song [...] "sound {{as if it was}} ripped directly from Spears' catalog." [...] Blair Kelly of musicOMH compared it to the music of Circus, and more specifically to [...] "Womanizer" [...] (2008). It was also compared by Tim Sendra of Allmusic to the [...] "electro glam" [...] sound of Goldfrapp. The lyrics of [...] "Whiplash" [...] speak of a blossoming romance. Gomez sings in the chorus, [...] "Come on and <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other side / I'm blown away, when I look into your eyes /I'm so in love, I think I'm going to crash / And get whiplash, whiplash, whiplash." ...|$|E
500|$|McAdams is an environmentalist. She ran an {{eco-friendly}} lifestyle website GreenIsSexy.org {{with two}} of her friends for five years, from 2007 to 2011. Her house is powered by Bullfrog renewable energy. She travels around Toronto by bicycle and does not own a car, but drives when in Los Angeles because it is [...] "a harder town to cycle in". She volunteered in Biloxi, Mississippi and Louisiana in fall of 2005, {{as part of the}} clean-up effort following Hurricane Katrina. McAdams sat on a TreeHugger/Live Earth judging panel in 2007. She appealed for donations during the Canada for Haiti telethon in 2010. She was involved in Matter of Trust's [...] "hair boom" [...] efforts following the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill.

500|$|Kiedis' {{feelings}} of alienation from his bandmates {{led him to}} feel that the city of Los Angeles was his only companion: [...] "I felt an unspoken bond between me and my city. I'd spent so much time wandering through the streets of L.A. and hiking through the Hollywood Hills that I sensed there was a nonhuman entity, maybe the spirit of the hills and the city, who had me in her sights and was looking after me." [...] The lines [...] "Sometimes I feel like / My only friend / Is the city I live in / The City of Angels / Lonely as I am / Together we cry" [...] show a direct link to Kiedis' isolation and sense of susceptibility. Despite these emotions, Kiedis believed that his life was better without drugs, telling Rolling Stone that [...] "no matter how sad or lonely I got, things were a million percent better than they were two years earlier when I was using drugs all the time. There was no comparison." [...] The optimistic ideology gave birth to the chorus of the song: [...] "I don't ever want to feel / Like I did that day / <b>Take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> place I love", [...] "the place" [...] meaning his bandmates, friends, and family.|$|E

In the 2014 documentary <b>Take</b> <b>Me</b> <b>To</b> <b>The</b> River, Bell states unequivocally that the city's white power structure loathed the presence of such a successful black-owned company and was determined to destroy it by any means necessary, using the bank loans as an excuse.|$|E

It was a children's program. And it was just for fun; my parents didn't know I {{was going to play}} professionally, they just wanted me to do something because I had lots of energy. It was only when I started playing well at seven that I went to a professional academy. I would go to school, and then my parents would <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> club, and I'd {{spend the rest of the}} day there just having fun with the kids." [...] In 1986, Kournikova became a member of the Spartak Tennis Club, coached by Larissa Preobrazhenskaya. In 1989, at the age of eight, Kournikova began appearing in junior tournaments, and by the following year, was attracting attention from tennis scouts across the world.

2500|$|On one occasion, as Stephen was mopping {{the kitchen}} floor with a cloth, Rose accidentally stepped into the bowl of water he had been using to perform this task. In response, Rose smashed the boy {{over the head with}} the bowl, then {{repeatedly}} kicked him in the head and chest as she shouted: [...] "You did that on purpose, you little swine!" [...] On another occasion, Rose became hysterical at a missing kitchen utensil, then grabbed a knife she had been using to cut a slab of meat, repeatedly inflicting light scour marks to Mae's chest until her rib cage was covered with light knife wounds. All the while, Mae had screamed, [...] "No, Mum! No, Mum!" [...] as Stephen and Heather stood by, helplessly sobbing. Even Fred occasionally became the recipient of Rose's violence. On one occasion in the late 1970s, Rose chased after Fred with a carving knife in her hand, although Fred was able to slam shut the door of the room into which he had run as Rose plunged at him with the knife, resulting in the knife embedding itself in the door, and Rose's fingers sliding down the blade, almost severing them from her hand. In response, Rose calmly wrapped her hand in a towel and said: [...] "Look what you done, fella. You've got to <b>take</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hospital now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Five years later, Arthur {{sits with}} Guinevere in his study, debating {{about what to}} do. He {{explains}} that he wishes {{to create a new}} kind of knight—one that does not pillage and fight, but tries to uphold honor and justice. He is eventually inspired, with Guinevere's help, to establish the Round Table with the motto [...] "might for right." [...] Five years later, Arthur's idea has led to the Knights of the Round Table being renowned all over the country, and their fame has even spread to France. A young, pretentious and over-religious Frenchman from Joyous Garde named Lancelot du Lac has heard of the Round Table, and is determined to come to Camelot and join Arthur's knights, confident that he is perfect for the post, ("C'est Moi"). King Pellinore, an elderly man who was a friend of Arthur's family, also comes to Camelot to witness Arthur's greatness for himself, and it later seems that he {{has become part of the}} family. Guinevere organizes a May Day festival on the castle grounds ("The Lusty Month of May"), where Arthur introduces his wife to Lancelot. Guinevere takes an instant dislike to Lancelot. Time passes, and he makes an enemy of most of the knights. Guinevere incites three of them; Sir Dinadan, Sir Sagramore and the burly Sir Lionel, to challenge him to a joust, ("Then You May <b>Take</b> <b>Me</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Fair"). Arthur (who, unlike everybody else, is friendly with Lancelot), is dismayed by this, and is at a loss to understand a woman's way- though he cannot be angry with Guinevere, ("How to Handle a Woman").|$|E
2500|$|The show premiered in Toronto, at the O'Keefe Centre on October 1, 1960. It overran {{drastically}} – it {{was supposed}} to last two hours forty minutes, and instead clocked in at four and a half hours. [...] The curtain came down at twenty to one in the morning; Lerner later noted that [...] "Only Tristan and Isolde equaled it as a bladder endurance contest." [...] Noël Coward was supposed to have remarked that the show was [...] "longer than the 'Götterdämmerung'...and not nearly as funny!" [...] In spite of this, the morning papers gave generally positive reviews, but hinted that the show needed much work, i.e. drastic editing, in order to succeed. Soon afterwards, Lerner was hospitalised for three weeks with a bleeding ulcer. [...] Soon after he was discharged, Hart suffered his second heart attack, and Lerner stepped in as temporary director {{for the rest of the}} out-of-town run. Camelot then moved to Boston, edited, but still running well over the intended length. The production team tried to find another director, even phoning Jose Ferrer, who could not undertake the job. Lerner and Loewe disagreed on how to proceed with the show, as Loewe did not want to make any major changes without Hart's guidance. Lerner wrote: [...] "God knows what would have happened had it not been for Richard Burton." [...] Accepting cuts and changes, he radiated a [...] "faith and geniality" [...] and calmed the fears of the cast. Guenevere's song [...] "Before I Gaze at You Again" [...] was given to Andrews at the last minute before the first New York preview, which provoked her famous quote, [...] "Of course, darling, but do try to get it to me the night before." [...] After the show opened on Broadway, Hart was released from the hospital, and he and Lerner began cutting the play even further. Two songs, [...] "Then You May <b>Take</b> <b>Me</b> <b>To</b> <b>the</b> Fair" [...] and [...] "Fie on Goodness," [...] were cut a few months into the run (though they remain on the cast album, and the former featured in the 1967 film).|$|E
