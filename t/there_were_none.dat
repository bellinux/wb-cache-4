5|$|Murder on the Orient Express {{retains the}} main plot {{elements}} of Agatha Christie's {{novel of the}} same name. An additional ending {{is presented in the}} game which differs from the conclusion of Christie's novel. As with And Then <b>There</b> <b>Were</b> <b>None,</b> Christie's novel is bundled with the game. Some reviewers of Murder on the Orient Express criticized the game because of the repetitive nature of tasks the player must complete, and also complained about the inefficient and cumbersome inventory system. Others have praised it for improved graphics compared to And Then <b>There</b> <b>Were</b> <b>None,</b> as well as convincing voice acting and audio effects. Murder on the Orient Express is followed by , the third installment in the Agatha Christie series.|$|E
5|$|Several {{graphical}} improvements {{were made}} to Murder on the Orient Express over And Then <b>There</b> <b>Were</b> <b>None.</b> These were mostly dedicated to character design and animation, which were extremely poorly received features of the first Christie game. The development team introduced animation layers, allowing them to control parts of character models independently. This allowed the developers {{to use the same}} animations whether the character was sitting, standing or lying down, and also gave them more head and upper body control. In And Then <b>There</b> <b>Were</b> <b>None,</b> characters had to rotate their entire bodies to talk to one another, whereas in Murder on the Orient Express, characters can simply turn their heads. The game has no physics features, but screen resolution has been increased, more detailed backgrounds have been made, and characters models contain more polygons.|$|E
5|$|The Manor Hall Amateur Dramatics Society, {{known as}} 'MAD', {{was formed in}} October 1933. Its first {{production}} was a nativity play, The Child in Flanders, by Cicely Hamilton, which was performed on 8 December 1933. Recent productions include Mostellaria, And Then <b>There</b> <b>Were</b> <b>None,</b> Road, The Crucible and The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole.|$|E

5|$|In 2503, Mohandar {{attended}} {{a meeting of}} the Hierarchy to discuss Zamara, a missing preserver. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>none</b> on Shakuras. A terran female, Rosemary Dahl, attended the meeting, along with Vartanil (a survivor from Aiur) and Executor Selendis; she was subject to protoss anti-female bias (due to their experiences with Sarah Kerrigan). Among the topics of conversation covered were Ulrezaj, a powerful dark archon and old enemy of the Khalai. During the meeting, Mohandar deferred to the judgment of Hierarch Artanis.|$|E
5|$|Murder on the Orient Express was {{announced}} in May 2006, as the second installment in The Adventure Company's Agatha Christie series. As with the game's predecessor, And Then <b>There</b> <b>Were</b> <b>None,</b> Murder on the Orient Express was developed by AWE Productions, in collaboration with producer The Adventure Company. The production team remained largely the same, with Lee Sheldon reprising his role as Lead Designer, and Scott Nixon from AWE Productions reprising his position as Managing Director.|$|E
5|$|The episode borrows {{heavily from}} the 1985 comedy film Clue, the 1976 comedy film Murder by Death, and is largely {{based upon the}} 1939 Agatha Christie novel And Then <b>There</b> <b>Were</b> <b>None.</b> The opening scene of the episode {{is similar to that}} of Stanley Kubrik's The Shining. Once the Griffin family arrives at the mansion, Lois remarks on the estate's beauty, {{wondering}} if television host Jeff Probst has a similar home. As they walk into the mansion, Sir John Everett Millais's Ophelia is seen. As dinner commences, Carl begins conversing with Tom Tucker, and discusses the plot of the 1986 fantasy film Labyrinth, directed by Jim Henson.|$|E

50|$|If <b>there</b> <b>be</b> <b>none,</b> {{never mind}} it.|$|R
5|$|A major {{difference}} between And Then <b>There</b> <b>Were</b> <b>None</b> and Murder on the Orient Express that Sheldon pointed out {{was that in the}} former, the premise of the novel was that no one solved the murder. This forced Sheldon to desperately {{try to find a way}} to integrate clues into the story so that the player could actually discover the murderer, although the game remained quite uninteractive. In Murder on the Orient Express, the actual novel follows an investigation, so Sheldon could more easily integrate clues to lead to all three possible solutions. Sheldon also excised unnecessary puzzles from Murder on the Orient Express, as they were an unpopular feature of its predecessor.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536, there were over 850 monasteries, nunneries and friaries in England. By 1541, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>none.</b> More than 15,000 monks and nuns had been {{dispersed}} and the buildings had been seized by the Crown to be sold off or leased to new lay occupiers. Glastonbury Abbey was reviewed as having significant amounts of silver and gold as well as its attached lands. In September 1539, the abbey was visited by Richard Layton, Richard Pollard and Thomas Moyle, who arrived there without warning on the orders of Thomas Cromwell. The abbey was stripped of its valuables and Abbot Richard Whiting (Whyting), who had been a signatory to the Act of Supremacy that made Henry VIII the head of the church, resisted and was hanged, drawn and quartered as a traitor on Glastonbury Tor on 15 November 1539.|$|E
5|$|Juan de Chávez {{attempted}} to storm the Peñol, {{but was unable}} even to advance to its base. He therefore decided to lay siege to the fortress but was short of supplies, since the local Indians were all gathered in resistance, and <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>none</b> left to provision the Spanish. Spanish morale was low, since the difficulty of storming the fortress was obvious, {{and most of the}} Spanish soldiers had homes and encomiendas in Guatemala, and wished to return to them. After a time, Chávez was forced to withdraw by the mutinous rumblings of his troops. He planned to find an easier victory to boost morale, and to resupply before returning to assault the fortress. He also considered that his withdrawal would allow the hostile Indians to farm their fields around the Peñol, which would provide food when he later returned to renew the assault.|$|E

[...] and [...] "Hold him so that he does not fall". In the oldest written account, by an Egyptian named Uha, in the 23rd century BCE, he describes a mass circumcision and boasts of his ability to stoically endure the pain: [...] "When I was circumcised, together with one hundred and twenty men ... <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> thereof who hit out, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> thereof who <b>was</b> hit, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> thereof who scratched and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>none</b> thereof who <b>was</b> scratched." ...|$|R

5|$|The Adventure Company and Chorion, {{the owners}} of the rights to Christie's works, chose Agatha Christie's novel Murder on the Orient Express, widely {{considered}} the author's magnum opus, {{as the basis for the}} next game in the Agatha Christie series. AWE Productions had little influence in the choice, other than being asked for an opinion. Sheldon created a concept document for the new game and sent it to Chorion, who sent it back with some suggestions. Sheldon agreed to some of these, but refused others. Chorion was generally more comfortable with the development team for their second outing. They did not have to scrutinize every aspect of the game as with And Then <b>There</b> <b>Were</b> <b>None,</b> and generally had fewer complaints with Murder on the Orient Express, as opposed to its predecessor.|$|E
