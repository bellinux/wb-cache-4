5|$|At {{the time}} of her husband's election, some sources {{anticipated}} that as a high-profile African-American woman in a stable marriage Obama would be a positive role model who would influence the view the world has of African-Americans. Her fashion choices were part of the 2009 Fashion week, but Obama's influence in the field did not have the impact on the paucity of African-American models who participate, that some <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might.</b>|$|E
5|$|From Russia, with Love is {{the fifth}} novel by the English author Ian Fleming to feature his fictional British Secret Service agent James Bond. Fleming wrote the story in early 1956 at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica; {{at the time he}} <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be his final Bond book. The novel was first {{published}} in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape on 8 April 1957.|$|E
5|$|At 07:15 UTC on 14 November 1963, {{the cook}} of Ísleifur II, a trawler sailing these same waters spotted a rising column of dark smoke {{southwest}} of the boat. The captain <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have been a boat on fire, and ordered the vessel to investigate. Instead, they encountered explosive eruptions giving off black columns of ash, indicating that a volcanic eruption had begun to penetrate {{the surface of the}} sea. By 11:00 the same day, the eruption column had reached several kilometres in height. At first the eruptions took place at three separate vents along a northeast by southwest trending fissure, but by the afternoon the separate eruption columns had merged into one along the erupting fissure. Over the next week, explosions were continuous, and after just a few days the new island, formed mainly of scoria, measured over 500metres (1640ft) in length and had reached a height of 45metres (147ft).|$|E

25|$|Sufficient {{stocks of}} {{supplies}} {{had not been}} prepared for the army, since the King Gustaf IV Adolf <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be taken as provocation by the Russians. Furthermore, Swedish strategy relied on the outdated plans for Finland which took into account neither the advances in weaponry, mobility {{of the armed forces}} or the greatly improved road networks of Finland. Most of the fortifications in Finland had not been completed and those that were completed had mostly fallen into neglect and disrepair. Even the strongest of the Swedish fortresses, Sveaborg, still had several of its planned fortifications missing, most notably all the land side fortifications designed to protect against besieging enemy.|$|E
25|$|Darwin {{returned}} from Malvern {{at the end}} of June 1850 to a reawakening of his fears that his illness might be hereditary. His bright nine-year-old daughter Anne who had become a particular favourite and comfort to him fell sick. She was miserable for weeks on end, then became feverish. Their doctor could do nothing and <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be inherited. She had recovered to some extent by March 1851, but then she and her father were both laid low by influenza. Darwin recovered but Annie was still ill, and on 24 March he took her to Malvern, leaving her there for the best treatment he knew of, and returning to Downe where Emma had stayed as she was pregnant. With his first paper on barnacles printed and Hooker safely returned to Britain laden with specimens, things were looking up, but then on 15 April Annie suffered a serious relapse and Darwin had to rush to her side.|$|E

500|$|Jones's novel From Here to Eternity was {{a best-seller}} and {{well known for}} its {{successful}} movie adaptation. [...] Jones's manuscript was heavily censored by his publisher to remove profanity and references to gay prostitution; the unexpurgated version was not published until 2011. [...] Once it was, composer Stuart Brayson <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be adapted as a musical, and proposed the project to Tim Rice, who acquired the stage rights and wrote the lyrics.|$|E
500|$|When Du Bois became {{editor of}} The Crisis {{magazine}} in 1911, {{he joined the}} Socialist Party of America {{on the advice of}} NAACP founders Mary Ovington, William English Walling and Charles Edward Russell. However, he supported the Democrat Woodrow Wilson in the 1912 presidential campaign, a breach of the rules, and was forced to resign from the Socialist Party. Du Bois remained: [...] "convinced that socialism was an excellent way of life, but I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be reached by various methods." ...|$|E
500|$|A similar {{problem of}} {{interpretation}} has also plagued Narihira's last poem (quoted above). The fourth line, , is most normally read as [...] "(I never thought) {{that it might}} be yesterday or today", but has been occasionally interpreted by scholars to mean [...] "until yesterday I never <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be today"; others take it as simply meaning [...] "right about now". But the emotion behind the poem is nonetheless clear: Narihira, who died in his fifties, always knew he must die someday, but is nonetheless shocked that his time has come so soon.|$|E
60|$|Meantime, Theodora {{waited in}} fear, too great {{at first to}} leave space for other thoughts; but as time past, other {{memories}} returned. On coming to summon Percy she had found him standing before the little stuffed owl, {{and she could not}} but wonder what <b>thoughts</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> have excited, until suddenly the recollection of Jane dissipated her visions with so violent a revulsion that she was shocked at herself, and perceived that there was a victory to be achieved.|$|R

Dan and Maddy have always been {{incredibly}} close without becoming lovers, but it is obvious that they are great together, so when it happens it is effortless and joyous and has wonderful potential. But Dan's private demons prevent it from being allowed to live and grow. I always <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be great for him, if only he could have let it be." ...|$|E
500|$|The twelfth {{and final}} {{song of the}} album, {{selected}} as a single, is Mac Davis' [...] "In The Ghetto". The song was chosen by Billy Strange, who had previously picked material for other Presley sessions. The protest song denounces the consequences of poverty, with compassion for inner-city youth. Because of [...] "In the Ghetto"'s lyrics, controversial for its time, Presley originally did not plan to record the song because he <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> alienate fans. After Moman said he might give the song to Rosey Grier, Presley's friends Joe Esposito and George Klein (initially opposed to [...] "In the Ghetto"), convinced the singer to record it.|$|E
500|$|Hillenburg went to Humboldt State University, in Arcata, California, as a marine-science major. He also minored in art, {{and claimed}} that [...] " [...] blossomed as a painter in Humboldt." [...] In 1984, he earned his bachelor's degree in natural-resource {{planning}} and interpretation, with an emphasis in marine resources. He intended to take a master's degree, but {{said it would be}} in art: [...] "Initially I think I assumed that if I went to school for art I would never have any way of making a living, so I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be smarter to keep art my passion and hobby and study something else. But by the time I got to the end of my undergrad work, I realized I should be in art." ...|$|E

500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Photograph" [...] {{was released on}} 9 May 2015. The video is a montage of real home footage. Sheeran sourced the clips from his father, who was then compiling it into DVDs for their family Christmas present. He initially intended the clips for inclusion in a documentary that was being produced around that time; but looking through the collection, he <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> work for a music video. Sheeran also admitted he could not attend to an actual video shoot, hence he opted for the montage. Emil Nava, who had previously worked with Sheeran on his other promotional music videos, directed [...] "Photograph". Editor Ellie Johnson worked with Sheeran's father while in central London. According to Johnson, they spent a weekend gathering the clips used in the montage.|$|E
500|$|Six major singles {{were issued}} from the album, led by [...] "SexyBack" [...] which was {{released}} on July 7, 2006, two {{months prior to the}} publication of the album. Regarding the song, Timberlake surmised he did not sound like he did before. [...] "SexyBack", which lacks his distinctive falsetto, is seen as a complete departure from Timberlake's recognized sound, and his management <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> risk being unrecognizable as a [...] "Justin Timberlake song". But that risk nonetheless appealed to Timberlake, who reportedly insisted to have [...] "SexyBack" [...] released as the album's lead single. Jive Records executive Barry Weiss, who initially doubted the suggestion, later told in an interview in February 2007 that albeit an [...] "unusual record", it was a [...] "risk that clearly paid off".|$|E
500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the album {{took place at}} Record Plant, RCA Studios, and Capitol Recording Studios in Los Angeles in April 1975. Streisand and Columbia Records released Lazy Afternoon on October 1, 1975. It features handwritten liner notes developed by Streisand herself; she opened the booklet by writing, [...] "While I usually let the vinyl speak for itself, I really had fun making this record, and I <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> interest you {{to know something about}} each song. After all, I wouldn't want to be a chef who doesn't share her secrets!" [...] Additionally, the label issued the album as an 8-track cartridge later in 1975, with the track listing switching the order of [...] "By the Way" [...] and [...] "Widescreen" [...] around. The album was later released in a compact disc format on October 25, 1990.|$|E

500|$|Chambrin did {{not speak}} English, but summoned his English-speaking brother. Smith {{produced}} his RAF rank insignia as proof of his identity. Smith and Bill {{made their way to}} the border crossing, guided by Chambrin, who told them that his brother would meet them on the other side of the border. The only crossing was a bridge, manned by German sentries. Smith observed the checkpoint for a while, and saw that pedestrians crossing alone or in pairs were rarely challenged, while larger groups often were. He <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be possible simply to walk across, and told Bill to [...] "just look straight ahead and walk quietly on". They were not challenged, and met Chambrin's brother a few miles away. The Austrian and Frenchman joined them the next day; the Polish soldier, who had appeared to Smith to be underage, had lost his nerve on seeing the Germans and had gone back.|$|E
500|$|... "Missing My Baby" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Vibe magazine reported that Full Force was awarded gold and platinum discs for [...] "Missing My Baby" [...] and [...] "Techno Cumbia", and described [...] "Missing My Baby" [...] as giving a [...] "hint of her aspirations". After it was remixed by Quintanilla III and later produced for the 1995 album Dreaming of You, the Hi XD {{said that it}} was the best English-language song on the album. Chris Riemenschneider and John T. Davis of the Austin American-Statesman wrote that [...] "Missing My Baby can sound as fluffy as the Big M's [...] "Crazy for You". Cary Clack of the San Antonio Express-News wrote that [...] "Missing My Baby" [...] was played on non-Tejano radio stations and that he <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> become a posthumous hit, while commenting that the recording [...] "displays [...] wonderful vocal and emotional range". However, Mario Tarradell of The Dallas Morning News believed that [...] "Missing My Baby" [...] and other tracks were added to Entre a Mi Mundo [...] "for good measure".|$|E
500|$|Uzumaki {{was written}} and {{illustrated}} by Junji Ito. Junji Ito's initial desire was to create a story about strange changes that would occur to people living in a very long, traditional Japanese terraced house. This story would have been based on Ito's personal experience living in such a house as a child. During the process of finding a way to draw such a long building, Ito was inspired by the shape of a mosquito coil and decided he could make the building long by having it spiral. Ito has noted that the spiral is a [...] "mysterious pattern" [...] and described writing Uzumaki as an attempt to learn the secrets of the spiral. Ito sought inspiration by methods such as staring at spirals, researching spirals, creating spiral patterns by draining water from bath tubs, eating foods with spiral patterns, and raising snails. Looking back on the series in 2006, Ito stated that while he was still uncertain what the spiral stood for, he <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> be representative of infinity.|$|E
