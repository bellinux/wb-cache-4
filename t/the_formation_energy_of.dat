40|$|MAX phases are {{potential}} future {{materials used in}} the nuclear industry. Recently, a new MAX phase Nb 2 GeC is predicted as the most stable compound, and confirmed by thin film synthesis. In the operation of fusion reactor, the accumulation and aggregation of helium and hydrogen produced from transmutation reactions would induce bubble formation and void swelling and further result in embrittlement and irradiation-induced hardening of the materials. High solubility and permeability of tritium and solubility of interstitial impurities like O, C, and N {{can also lead to}} embrittlement. In order to further investigate the characters of Nb 2 Ge in irradiation environment, ab initio calculations are performed on the energetics of O, H and He impurities in Nb 2 Ge. The study of all the impurities is carried out in two ways, substitutionally and interstitially. <b>Formation</b> <b>energies</b> due to substitution and interstitial are calculated, lattice parameters and unit cell volume of Nb 2 GeC with substitutional or interstitial impurities are obtained, and its electronic property is analysed by Mulliken population and electron charge density. <b>The</b> <b>formation</b> <b>energies</b> <b>of</b> H substitution are lower than those of O substitution and He substitution, hence H atoms are trapped more easily by some irradiation-induced vacancies. <b>The</b> <b>formation</b> <b>energies</b> <b>of</b> O subtitution indicate the sequence Ef(Osub-Nb) > Ef(Osub-Ge) approximate to Ef(Osub-C), which is related to the strength of bonds. Analysis on electron charge density and Mulliken population shows that C-O bond is stronger than Nb-O and Ge-O bond, and the bond lengths of C-O, Nb-O and Ge-O are 3. 256, 2. 118 and 1. 985 angstrom respectively. Due to the interaction of O atom with Nb, Ge and C atoms in Nb 2 Ge, the O atom would deviate from the vacancy, and goes to the deformed sites in the crystal structure. As for H substitution, <b>the</b> <b>formation</b> <b>energies</b> <b>of</b> substitution show <b>the</b> sequence Ef(Hsub-Nb) > Ef(Hsub-Ge) > Ef(Hsub-C).
