5|$|In November 2005 the Smoking Popes, with drummer Rob Kellenberger, reunited to play Chicago's Flower 15 festival. The {{performance}} was recorded and released as the CD/DVD package At Metro through Victory Records in February 2006. Ryan Chavez drummed on the band's fifth studio album, Stay Down, released in 2008 through Curb Appeal Records. Neil Hennessy of fellow Chicago punk rock band The Lawrence Arms became the Smoking Popes' permanent drummer {{prior to the}} album's release. In February 2010 Asian Man Records released the compilation album It's Been a Long Day. The band's sixth studio album, <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Only</b> <b>a</b> Test, was released March 15, 2011 through Asian Man.|$|E

25|$|Daniel Dennett {{also argues}} that no clear {{conclusion}} about volition {{can be derived from}} Benjamin Libet's experiments supposedly demonstrating the non-existence of conscious volition. According to Dennett, ambiguities in the timings of the different events involved.

25|$|In a 2013 interview, Cardinal Andrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo, {{designer}} of the coat of arms, said that Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI needed a new coat of arms {{now that he was}} no longer the pontiff. “The problem now is whether the Pope Emeritus can keep that same coat of arms or not,”. “And as a person who has always dedicated himself to this, I say ‘no,’”. He drew up a new coat of arms, which he believed could be used now by the former pontiff. He moved the big keys of Saint Peter {{from the back of the}} coat of arms to the top part of the shield and made them much smaller. “But <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> proposal, it isn’t official,” Montezemolo qualified.|$|E

25|$|Gröbner bases {{are deemed}} to be {{difficult}} to compute. In fact they may contain, in the worst case, polynomials whose degree is doubly exponential in the number of variables and a number of polynomials which is also doubly exponential. However, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> worst case complexity, and the complexity bound of Lazard's algorithm of 1979 may frequently apply. Faugère F5 algorithm realizes this complexity, as it may be viewed as an improvement of Lazard's 1979 algorithm. It follows that the best implementations allow one to compute almost routinely with algebraic sets of degree more than 100. This means that, presently, the difficulty of computing a Gröbner basis is strongly related to the intrinsic difficulty of the problem.|$|E
25|$|Other {{scholars}} explain team {{performance by}} aggregating team members' general intelligence {{to the team}} level instead of building an own overall collective intelligence measure. Devine and Philips (2001) showed in a meta-analysis that mean cognitive ability predicts team performance in laboratory settings (.37) as well as field settings (.14) – note that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> small effect. Suggesting a strong dependence on the relevant tasks, other scholars showed that tasks requiring {{a high degree of}} communication and cooperation are found to be most influenced by the team member with the lowest cognitive ability. Tasks in which selecting the best team member is the most successful strategy, are shown to be most influenced by the member with the highest cognitive ability.|$|E
25|$|Dystheistic {{speculation}} {{arises from}} {{consideration of the}} problem of evil — the question of why God, who is supposedly omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent, would allow evil to exist in the world. Koons notes that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> theological problem for a eutheist, since a dystheist would not find the existence of evil (or God's authorship of it) to be an obstacle to theistic belief. In fact, the dystheistic option would be a consistent non-contradictory response to the problem of evil. Thus Koons concludes that the problem of theodicy (explaining how God can be good despite the apparent contradiction presented in the problem of evil) does not pose a challenge to all possible forms of theism (i.e., that the problem of evil does not present a contradiction to someone who would believe that God exists but that he is not necessarily good).|$|E

25|$|Vibrato is a {{technique}} of the left hand and arm in which the pitch of a note varies subtly in a pulsating rhythm. While {{various parts of the}} hand or arm may be involved in the motion, the end result is a movement of the fingertip bringing about a slight change in vibrating string length, which causes an undulation in pitch. Some violinists oscillate backwards, or lower in pitch from the actual note when using vibrato, since it is believed that perception favors the highest pitch in a varying sound. Vibrato does little, if anything, to disguise an out-of-tune note; in other words, misapplied vibrato is a poor substitute for good intonation. Scales and other exercises meant to work on intonation are typically played without vibrato to make the work easier and more effective. Music students are often taught that unless otherwise marked in music, vibrato is assumed. However, it has to be noted that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> trend; there is nothing on the sheet music that compels violinists to add vibrato. This can be an obstacle to a classically trained violinist wishing to play in a style that uses little or no vibrato at all, such as baroque music played in period style and many traditional fiddling styles.|$|E
25|$|In part writing, {{the usage}} of Conjunct Melodic Motion is important, in which the parts {{generally}} move in stepwise motion, and in counterpoint, {{if there is a}} leap (a jump of a fourth or above), the part will progress the opposite direction it just leapt in stepwise motion. Parts also must progress together in contrary motion, meaning the parts are going in different directions. This is preferable to parallel motion, where the parts move together, or oblique motion, where one part doesn’t move and another does. Parallel motion can be used, {{but it is important to}} pay attention to intervals in order to avoid breaking counterpoint rules. Dissonant intervals, both melodic and harmonic intervals are not preferable in most cases. This includes augmented or diminished intervals, tritones, and seventh chords, simply because they sound very jarring in a piece that is meant to sound pleasant to the ear. Parallel intervals, which occur when two parts move the same distance creating the same interval twice in a row, are also important to be aware of. However, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> problem when the intervals are either a perfect fifth or a perfect octave. These also can sound uncomfortable to the ear as they tend to have an open or hollow sound.|$|E

500|$|The light curves for TypeIa {{are mostly}} very uniform, with a {{consistent}} maximum absolute magnitude and a relatively steep decline in luminosity. [...] Their optical energy output {{is driven by}} radioactive decay of ejected nickel-56 (half life 6 days), which then decays to radioactive cobalt-56 (half life 77 days). These radioisotopes excite the surrounding material to incandescence. Studies of cosmology today rely on 56Ni radioactivity providing the energy for the optical brightness of supernovae of Type Ia, which are the [...] "standard candles" [...] of cosmology but whose diagnostic 847keV and 1238keV gamma rays were first detected only in 2014. The initial phases of the light curve decline steeply as the effective size of the photosphere decreases and trapped electromagnetic radiation is depleted. [...] The light curve continues to decline in the B band while it may show a small shoulder in the visual at about 40 days, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> hint of a secondary maximum that occurs in the infra-red as certain ionised heavy elements recombine to produce infra-red radiation and the ejecta become transparent to it. The visual light curve continues to decline at a rate slightly greater than the decay rate of the radioactive cobalt (which has the longer half life and controls the later curve), because the ejected material becomes more diffuse and less able to convert the high energy radiation into visual radiation. [...] After several months, the light curve changes its decline rate again as positron emission becomes dominant from the remaining cobalt-56, although {{this portion of the}} light curve has been little-studied.|$|E
