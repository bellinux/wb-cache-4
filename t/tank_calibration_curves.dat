40|$|Sampling the {{collected}} suspension in a storage tank {{is a common}} procedure to obtain soil loss data. A <b>calibration</b> <b>curve</b> of the <b>tank</b> has {{to be used to}} obtain actual concentration values from those measured by sampling. However, literature suggests that using a <b>tank</b> <b>calibration</b> <b>curve</b> was not a common procedure in the past. For the clay soil of the Sparacia (Italy) experimental station, this investigation aimed to establish a link between the relative performances of the USLE-M and USLE-MM models, usable to predict plot soil loss at the event temporal scale, and soil loss measurement errors. Using all available soil loss data, lower soil loss prediction errors were obtained with the USLE-MM (exponent of the erosivity term, b 1 > 1) than the USLE-M (b 1 = 1). A systematic error of the soil loss data is unexpected for the Sparacia soil because the <b>calibration</b> <b>curve</b> does not depend on the water level in the tank. In any case, this type of error does not have any effect on the b 1 exponent. Instead, this exponent decreases as the level of underestimation increases for increasing soil loss values. This type of error can occur at Sparacia if it is assumed that a soil loss measurement can be obtained by a bottle sampler dipped close {{to the bottom of the}} tank after mixing the suspension and assuming that the measured concentration coincides with the actual one. In this case, the risk is to obtain a lower b 1 value than the actual one. In conclusion, additional investigations on the factors determining errors in soil loss data collected by a sampling procedure are advisable because these errors can have a noticeable effect on the calibrated empirical models for soil loss prediction...|$|R

Factors like species, age and year might generate isotopic variation in <b>calibration</b> <b>curves,</b> but the extent to which accounting for variation may improve <b>calibration</b> <b>curves</b> and hence provenance determination of birds, is unknown. We compared three European calibration curves: 1) an existing multi-species curve, uncorrected for age and year variation, and two species-specific <b>calibration</b> <b>curves,</b> based on mallard Anas platyrhynchos feathers, of 2) varying age and year, and 3) juvenile natal origin, corrected for year variation. <b>Calibration</b> <b>curves</b> using ordinary least square linear regression (OLS) as opposed to standard major axis regression showed least bias in estimation. As expected, we found that a single species (mallard) OLS <b>calibration</b> <b>curve</b> corrected for age and year yielded the highest coefficient of determination, but was still surprisingly similar to the other two <b>calibration</b> <b>curves.</b> Nevertheless, when using feathers of known-origin to assess provenance accuracy, the <b>calibration</b> <b>curve</b> that accounted for species, age and year variation yielded the best prediction in as many as 59 % of the cases.

As a rule, the matrix-matched <b>calibration</b> <b>curve</b> from blank honey was adopted to quantifying analyte in a batch. This paper investigated matrix effect on sulfonamide in four honey samples by high-performance liquid chromatography hyphenated with mass spectrometry detection.

40|$|Abstract. The {{electric}} potential difference technique is frequently used to monitor crack size propagation in fatigue testing. Crack size is indirectly measured by the change of the electrical field, due to the crack discontinuity, when the component on test is exposed to an electric current flowing through it. The potential difference {{can be related to}} crack size through experimental, analytical or numerical <b>calibration</b> <b>curves.</b> When experimental <b>calibration</b> <b>curves</b> can not be obtained or if <b>calibration</b> <b>curves</b> are necessary before performing the experimental test, analytical or numerical <b>calibration</b> <b>curves</b> should be used. These calibrations are based on solutions of the Laplace’s equation for specific boundary conditions of a given test piece geometry.

Samples from Tell es-Sultan, Jericho, were {{selected}} for high-precision 14 C dating as a contribution toward {{the establishment of an}} independent radiocarbon chronology of Near Eastern archaeology. The material derives from archaeolog-ical excavations conducted by K. M. Kenyon in the 1950 s. We present here the results of 18 samples, associated stratigraph-ically {{with the end of the}} Middle Bronze Age (MBA) at Tell es-Sultan. Six short-lived samples consist of charred cereal grains and 12 multiyear samples are composed of charcoal. The weighted average 14 C date of the short-lived grains is 3306 ± 7 BP. The multiyear charcoal yielded, as expected, a somewhat older average: 3370 ± 6 BP. Both dates are more precise than the stan-dard deviation (Q) of the <b>calibration</b> <b>curves</b> and the absolute standard of oxalic acid.
