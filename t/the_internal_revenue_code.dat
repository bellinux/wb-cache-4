5|$|This {{argument}} {{is based in}} part on the U.S. Supreme Court decision in the case of United States v. Bevans. In Bevans, the parties argued over whether a federal court in Massachusetts had jurisdiction over the case of a U.S. Marine charged with a murder that occurred on a ship in Boston Harbor. No issues regarding federal income taxation or <b>the</b> <b>Internal</b> <b>Revenue</b> <b>Code</b> were presented to or decided by the Court in the Bevans case. <b>The</b> <b>Internal</b> <b>Revenue</b> <b>Code</b> and the Internal Revenue Service did not yet exist in 1818, when the Bevans murder case was decided.|$|E

5|$|Section 105 {{authorized}} the secretary to prohibit the melting, export, or treating of any coin, {{if necessary to}} protect the nation's coinage, and prescribed a penalty of {{up to five years}} in prison for violation of such an order—section 106 declared that coins seized under section 105 would be forfeited to the United States, with the secretary given powers paralleling those under <b>the</b> <b>Internal</b> <b>Revenue</b> <b>Code</b> to enforce such forfeitures. Section 107 allowed the secretary to issue regulations to put into force the Coinage Act of 1965, while section 108 contained definitions and similar technical matters.|$|E

5|$|The Senate {{began work}} on its own {{proposals}} while the House was still working. The United States Constitution requires all revenue-related bills to originate in the House. To formally comply with this requirement, the Senate used H.R. 3590, a bill regarding housing tax changes for service members. It had been passed by the House as a revenue-related modification to <b>the</b> <b>Internal</b> <b>Revenue</b> <b>Code.</b> The bill became the Senate's vehicle for its healthcare reform proposal, discarding the bill's original content. The bill ultimately incorporated elements of proposals that were reported favorably by the Senate Health and Finance committees. With the Republican Senate minority vowing to filibuster, 60 votes {{would be necessary to}} pass the Senate. At the start of the 111th Congress, Democrats had only 58 votes; the Senate seat in Minnesota ultimately won by Al Franken was still undergoing a recount, while Arlen Specter was still a Republican (he became a Democrat in April, 2009).|$|E

50|$|United States v.
