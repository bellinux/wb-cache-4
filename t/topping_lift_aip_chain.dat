5000|$|... the <b>topping</b> <b>lift,</b> {{whose purpose}} is to hold the boom and junk sail up off the deck when the sail is not raised. The <b>topping</b> <b>lift</b> also serves to tame the junk sail during reefing and {{dropping}} because the spars and sailcloth will all drop into the cradle of the <b>topping</b> <b>lift.</b>|$|R
50|$|While under sail, the {{opposite}} {{force to the}} vang is supplied by the sail itself. When the sail is furled, a <b>topping</b> <b>lift</b> supplies the upward force on the boom. Some line vang systems incorporate a piston to provide the <b>topping</b> <b>lift</b> force and to damp oscillations. Hydraulic vangs can inherently act in the <b>topping</b> <b>lift</b> role.|$|R

50|$|The <b>topping</b> <b>lift</b> (more rarely {{known as}} an uphaul) is a line which applies upward force on a boom on a sailboat.|$|R
5000|$|Part of {{the running}} rigging, <b>topping</b> <b>lifts</b> are {{primarily}} used to hold a boom up when the sail is lowered. http://www.sailingusa.info/weather_and_reefing.htm This line would run from near the free end of the boom(s) forward {{to the top of}} the mast. The line may be run over a block at the top of the mast and down to the deck to allow it to be adjusted. For small booms, the <b>topping</b> <b>lift</b> may be run from end of the boom to the backstay or next mast aft. When the sail is raised again, the <b>topping</b> <b>lift</b> is loosened or removed. On sailboats used for racing, boom lift function is frequently incorporated into the boom vang system, to reduce the number of lines aloft. Allowing the vang to take this function also simplifies operation of the boat. http://www.sail-world.com/CruisingAus/index.cfm?SEID=2&Nid=21818&SRCID=0&ntid=0&tickeruid=0&tickerCID=0 ...|$|R

5000|$|Derrick {{executed}} {{more than}} 3,000 {{people in his}} career, including his pardoner, the Earl of Essex, in 1601. Derrick devised a beam with a <b>topping</b> <b>lift</b> and pulleys for his hangings, instead of the old-fashioned rope over the beam method.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The {{running rigging}} {{for the modern}} junk sail can be divided between the [...] "pull ups" [...] (halyard and <b>topping</b> <b>lift)</b> and the [...] "pull downs" [...] (yard hauling parrel, luff hauling parrel, and sheets). Not shown are {{optional}} downhauls for the yard, battens, and boom.|$|R
50|$|A special line, the <b>topping</b> <b>lift,</b> {{runs from}} the middle of the {{spinnaker}} pole up to a block on the mast, and is used to support the weight of the spinnaker pole. Another line referred to as the downhaul or foreguy runs down so that the height of the pole is under positive control at all times.|$|R
50|$|The Beetle 14 boat carries 163 sq ft. of sail, {{proportionate}} to the Beetle Cat's rig; however, {{two sets}} of reef points are standard, whereas the Beetle Cat has only one. A <b>topping</b> <b>lift</b> is standard, {{as well as more}} purchase on the peak halyard and mainsheet. These changes, on top of a more depth of hull with less fullness forward, were intended to make the vessel easy to handle and fast. Two have been built to date.|$|R
5000|$|Temporary sheers {{comprise}} two upright spars, lashed {{together at}} {{their heads and}} their feet splayed apart. Unlike in a gyn, which has three legs and is thus stable without support, stability in sheers (derricks, and single-legged gin poles) is provided by a guy. [...] The heels of the spars are secured by splay and heel tackles. The point {{at the top of}} the sheers where the spars cross and are lashed together is the [...] "crutch", to which a block and tackle is attached. Unlike derricks, sheers need no lateral support, and only require either a foreguy and an aftguy or a martingale and a <b>topping</b> <b>lift.</b> Being made of two spars rather than one, sheers are stronger than a derrick of the same size and made of equivalent materials. Unlike the apex of a gyn, which is fixed, the crutch of a sheers can be topped up or lowered, via the <b>topping</b> <b>lift,</b> through a limited angle. In the era of sailing vessels, it was common for dockyards to employ a sheer hulk, an old floating ship's hull fitted with sheer legs, and used to install masts in other ships.|$|R
50|$|Symmetric spinnakers {{have the}} {{windward}} clew secured to a spinnaker pole. The pole {{is attached to}} the mast and holds the windward edge of the sail in position. Lines that control the spinnaker pole are called guys or braces. The spinnaker pole may be allowed to raise and lower with the force of the wind, or it may have lines attached to it to raise (the <b>topping</b> <b>lift)</b> and lower (the foreguy or downhaul) the angle of the pole. If these lines are used, they are generally set up before setting sail, and left in place even when the spinnaker is stowed.|$|R
50|$|Emergency furling is {{fast and}} simple. When {{the sheets and}} halyard are let go, the sail will blow down wind, drop into the cradle of the <b>topping</b> <b>lifts,</b> while being steadied by the full battens. While this is fast and easy, it will also make a mess of the halyards, boom hauling parrel, yard hauling parrel, and downhauls. They {{will have to be}} put in order before raising the sail again. For non-emergency furling, it is {{preferable}} to drop the sail with two crew so that the slackening lines can be hauled in and maintained in order. Alternatively, a single-handed sailor can lower the sail in stages and attend to the slack lines.|$|R
25|$|Lieutenant John Thicknesse {{replaced}} Williams. Shortly thereafter, on 16 October 1798 the French 14-gun privateer Enfant Prodigue captured Charlotte off Cap Français or Cape François, Hispaniola. Charlotte suffered one man wounded {{before she}} struck her colours. A second, smaller schooner and two large armed launches supported Enfant Prodigue {{in the attack}} on Charlotte, which suffered considerable damage. Her main boom <b>topping</b> <b>lift</b> and all the braces had been shot away. One gun had been dismounted and two others disabled by broken breeches, leaving her with only five guns to continue the action. Surrounded by the enemy and unable to manoeuvre, Thicknesse was forced to surrender. Charlottes low casualty rate was {{a consequence of the}} French tactic of firing high to disable rigging. The subsequent court-martial honourably acquitted Thicknesse of the loss.|$|R
50|$|Moveable {{lines that}} control sails or other {{equipment}} are known collectively as a vessel's running rigging. Lines that raise sails are called halyards while those that strike them are called downhauls. Lines that adjust (trim) the sails are called sheets. These are {{often referred to}} using {{the name of the}} sail they control (such as main sheet, or jib sheet). Sail trim may also be controlled with smaller lines attached to the forward section of a boom such as a cunningham; a line used to hold the boom down is called a vang, or a kicker in the United Kingdom. A <b>topping</b> <b>lift</b> is used to hold a boom up in the absence of sail tension. Guys are used to control the ends of other spars such as spinnaker poles.|$|R

6000|$|... "We'll {{keep our}} eyes and ears open, and try to learn--that's the only way. I know every rope on a merchantman, kin name 'em from fore royal stay to <b>topping</b> <b>lift,</b> but that ain't the {{hundredth}} part on it. We've got to learn our vessel jest as a person has got {{to learn a new}} city and its streets, fer boats ain't built one like another, not by a jugful! And after we have learned the ship, we've got to learn the guns, and the fire-drill, and how to clear ship for action, and a lot more, not to say a word about learning how to knock out them Dons, as some calls 'em. Oh, we'll have our hands full after we get on board, don't forget it!" [...] And Si Doring shook his head vigorously.|$|R
50|$|Running rigging is the cordage used {{to control}} the shape and {{position}} of the sails. Materials have evolved {{from the use of}} Manilla rope to synthetic fibers, which include dacron, nylon and kevlar. Running rigging varies between fore-and-aft rigged vessels and square-rigged vessels. They have common functions between them for supporting, shaping and orienting sails, which employ different mechanisms. For supporting sails, halyards (sometimes haulyards), are used to raise sails and control luff tension. On gaff-rigged vessels, <b>topping</b> <b>lifts</b> hold the yards {{across the top of the}} sail aloft. Sail shape is usually controlled by lines that pull at the corners of the sail, including the outhaul at the clew and the downhaul at the tack on fore-and-aft rigs. The orientation of sails to the wind is controlled primarily by sheets, but also by braces, which position the yard arms with respect to the wind on square-rigged vessels.|$|R
25|$|Trollers – {{catch fish}} by towing astern {{one of more}} {{trolling}} lines. A trolling line is a fishing line with natural or artificial baited hooks trailed by a vessel near the surface or at a certain depth. Several lines can be towed {{at the same time}} using outriggers to keep the lines apart. The lines can be hauled in manually or by small winches. A length of rubber is often included in each line as a shock absorber. The trolling line is towed at a speed depending on the target species, from 2.3 knots up to at least 7 knots. Trollers range from small open boats to large refrigerated vessels 30 metres long. In many tropical artisanal fisheries, trolling is done with sailing canoes with outriggers for stability. With properly designed vessels, trolling is an economical and efficient way of catching tuna, mackerel and other pelagic fish swimming close to the surface. Purpose built trollers are usually equipped with two or four trolling booms raised and lowered by <b>topping</b> <b>lifts,</b> held in position by adjustable stays. Electrically powered or hydraulic reels can be used to haul in the lines.|$|R
50|$|Since spinnakers are {{downwind}} sails, {{they are}} never tacked, they are only jibed. When jibing a symmetric, the pole is removed from one corner and attached to the opposite corner. This corner now becomes the windward corner. There are two ways this is done. Generally on smaller boats, an end-for-end jibe is accomplished by disconnecting the pole at the mast-end and connecting the mast end {{to the opposite side}} of the sail. The old sail end is disconnected and then attached to the mast. This prevents the pole from getting loose during the procedure and allows the use of only two control lines that alternate as sheet and guy (more on this below). End-for-end jibing requires a pole with identical fittings at either end. Larger boats do a dip-pole gybe (jibe) in which the pole remains attached to the mast and the outer end is lowered until it can clear the head-stay and is then raised back up on the other side of the boat to the proper height with the <b>topping</b> <b>lift.</b> The guys are adjusted as before to set the sail angle on the new course. Dip-pole jibing can use a pole with one mast end and one sail end.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{in the day}} on 28 May, as Tuscana lay {{anchored}} in Buckner Bay, a swarm of kamikazes attacked. For Tuscana, the action began at 07:25, when a Japanese airplane crashed into a merchant ship only 800 yards off her starboard bow. For over 30 minutes, Tuscana fought off the airborne raiders. At 07:35, a suicide plane crashed into [...] Soon thereafter, Tuscana opened fire on her first enemy plane; and, moments later, another came in toward her port bow. Tuscanas guns opened on the attacker and kept it under fire until it disappeared in the low overcast. At 07:44, she engaged a third aircraft and splashed it 600 yards off the port bow. She then {{turned her attention to}} the rescue of two survivors from Sandoval. At 07:55, yet another Japanese plane came in range, and Tuscana splashed this raider some three miles away. During the fight, Tuscana lost her starboard mainmast boom, which was toppled and damaged beyond operational use, and her <b>topping</b> <b>lift</b> was carried away by friendly fire. At 0758, Tuscanas guns opened on the last of the attackers and ceased fire five minutes later, just as a kamikaze crashed merchant ship SS Josiah Snelling. At 09:00, the all clear was sounded, and Tuscana emerged from her encounter with the enemy without personnel loss and with the knowledge of having assisted in the splashing of two enemy planes.|$|R
50|$|On {{the evening}} of 5 January 1856, Benjamin Peirce was {{anchored}} in the St. Johns River off Jacksonville, Florida, when the steamer SS Seminole caught fire at a pier upstream shortly before midnight. Burning from stem to stern, Seminole was cut loose from her moorings so that the flames would not spread to buildings ashore and began to drift down onto Benjamin Peirce. By the time the senior officer aboard Benjamin Peirce, Sailing Master P. R. Hawley, could get her crew on deck, Seminole was only 50 yards (46 meters) away. Leaving half of Benjamin Peirces men aboard with buckets and axes to prevent flames from spreading to her if Seminole drifted onto her, Hawley took {{the rest of the}} men out in a boat to attempt to tow Seminole away from Benjamin Peirce. The boat managed to pull Seminole far enough for her only to strike a glancing blow against Benjamin Peirce, although Seminole passed the survey schooner so closely that the intense heat of the fire destroyed Benjamin Peirces foresail, mainsail, main gaff-top-sail, starboard main shrouds and main topmast back-stay and some of her running rigging. The flames also charred most of Benjamin Peirces spars, both of her masts, her starboard bulwarks, her galley, her cabin quarter-house, and her deck, damaged a new boat lying on her deck, and broke the glass in the skylight of her cabin quarter-house. Her main boom fell when the <b>topping</b> <b>lift</b> which supported it was destroyed, and it crushed her taffrail when it fell. Despite this damage, Hawleys quick action had prevented Seminole from becoming entangled with Benjamin Peirce, which probably would have resulted in the destruction of Benjamin Peirce.|$|R
5000|$|The boom is {{connected}} with {{the lower part of}} the mast which is shaped like a [...] "Y" [...] or a bipod and therefore it is a single swinging derrick. On the cross trees, two guys are fastened using swivel outriggers which are stayed vertically and horizontally. In order to maintain a good controlling angle between guys and derrick, the outriggers cannot pass the inboard parallel of the centerline. Looking at the illustration, one can easily see that the right outrigger stays in the centerline and the left outrigger has moved outboard. This derrick will lower or heave cargo as both guys are veered or hauled. Three winches, controlled by joystick, are necessary to operate the Hallen Derrick; two for the guys and one for the purchase. To avoid an over-topping or over-swinging limit-switches are used. However, the limits can be modified if a different working range or a special vertical stowage is required. The safe working load (SWL) of the Hallen is between 10 and 80 tonnes. In a Hallen Universal derrick, which has no Hallen D-Frame, the halyard has an extended length since it runs through further blocks on the centerline. The Universal Hallen derrick, replacing the D-frame option, is a kind of traditional <b>topping</b> <b>lift.</b> The Hallen D-Frame is a steel bracket welded on the mast in the centerline. For an observer standing a beam, the frame has a [...] "D"-shape. The D-Frame supersedes the outriggers and provides a good controlling angle on the guys. The Hallen derrick has a good purpose for e.g. containers, logs, steel rail, sawn timber and heavy lifts and doesn't lend itself for small, general cargo. It keeps the deck clear of guy ropes and preventors. Only one winchman is needed and within a few minutes the Hallen is brought into use. It is less expensive than a crane. A disadvantage is the low working range of the Hallen Derrick, it is able to swing 75° from the centerline and can work against a list of up to 15°.|$|R
50|$|The Ski Park was {{the second}} ski area {{constructed}} on Mount Shasta, but the only one which now survives. The old Mount Shasta Ski Bowl had been built in 1958 in a huge open cirque much higher up on the southern flank of the volcano, with a lodge at 7800 ft and <b>lifts</b> <b>topping</b> out above timberline at 9200 ft. However, the ski area had often been in financial trouble {{over the next two}} decades, and a massive avalanche in January 1978 which destroyed the main chairlift was the finishing blow. The Ski Bowl closed permanently after that, and there was no more lift-served skiing on Mount Shasta until 1985, when local businessmen and developers finally began construction of a new ski area lower down on the mountain, in an area well below timberline and safe from avalanches. The Mount Shasta Ski Park opened on December 14, 1985, and has been successfully operating for over two decades since then. The ski area is located entirely on a 1 sq mi single section inholding of private land within the checkerboard pattern of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, and road access is via Forest Route 88 across national forest land.|$|R
