5|$|The {{most common}} method of {{controlling}} the louvers is the balanced swell pedal. This device is usually placed above {{the centre of the}} pedalboard and is configured to rotate away from the organist from a near-vertical position (in which <b>the</b> <b>shades</b> are closed) to a near-horizontal position (in which <b>the</b> <b>shades</b> are open). An organ may also have a similar-looking crescendo pedal, found alongside any expression pedals. Pressing the crescendo pedal forward cumulatively activates the stops of the organ, starting with the softest and ending with the loudest; pressing it backwards reverses this process.|$|E

40|$|Background: Knowledge on {{microclimate}} {{conditions under}} artificial shades in a ginseng field would facilitate climate-aware management of ginseng production. Methods: Weather data were measured under <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> and outside <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> at two fields located in Gochang-gun and Jeongeup-si, Korea, in 2011 and 2012 seasons to assess {{temperature and humidity}} conditions under <b>the</b> <b>shade.</b> An empirical approach was developed and validated for the estimation of leaf wetness duration (LWD) using weather measurements outside <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> as inputs to the model. Results: Air temperature and relative humidity were similar between under <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> and outside <b>the</b> <b>shade.</b> For example, temperature conditions favorable for ginseng growth, e. g., between 8 °C and 27 °C, occurred slightly less frequently in hours during night times under <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> (91 %) than outside (92 %). Humidity conditions favorable for development of a foliar disease, e. g., relative humidity > 70 %, occurred slightly more frequently under <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> (84 %) than outside (82 %). Effectiveness of correction schemes to an empirical LWD model differed by rainfall conditions for the estimation of LWD under <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> using weather measurements outside <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> as inputs to the model. During dew eligible days, a correction scheme to an empirical LWD model was slightly effective (10 %) in reducing estimation errors under <b>the</b> <b>shade.</b> However, another correction approach during rainfall eligible days reduced errors of LWD estimation by 17 %. Conclusion: Weather measurements outside <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> and LWD estimates derived from these measurements would be useful as inputs for decision support systems to predict ginseng growth and disease development...|$|R

5|$|That praises {{are without}} reason lavished on the dead, {{and that the}} honours due only to {{excellence}} are paid to antiquity, is a complaint likely to be always continued by those, who, being able to add nothing to truth, hope for eminence from the heresies of paradox; or those, who, being forced by disappointment upon consolatory expedients, are willing to hope from posterity what the present age refuses, and flatter themselves that the regard which is yet denied by envy, will be at last bestowed by time. Antiquity, like every other quality that attracts the notice of mankind, has undoubtedly votaries that reverence it, not from reason, but from prejudice. Some seem to admire indiscriminately whatever has been long preserved, without considering that time has sometimes co-operated with chance; all perhaps {{are more willing to}} honour past than present excellence; and the mind contemplates genius through <b>the</b> <b>shades</b> of age, as the eye surveys the sun through artificial opacity.

5|$|Ancient Greek mythology {{contains}} several precursors {{to modern}} vampires, though none were considered undead; these included the Empusa, Lamia, and striges (the strix of Ancient Roman mythology). Over time {{the first two}} terms became general words to describe witches and demons respectively. Empusa {{was the daughter of}} the goddess Hecate and was described as a demonic, bronze-footed creature. She feasted on blood by transforming into a young woman and seduced men as they slept before drinking their blood. Lamia was the daughter of King Belus and a secret lover of Zeus. However Zeus' wife Hera discovered this infidelity and killed all Lamia's offspring; Lamia swore vengeance and preyed on young children in their beds at night, sucking their blood. Like Lamia, the striges feasted on children, but also preyed on young men. They were described as having the bodies of crows or birds in general, and were later incorporated into Roman mythology as strix, a kind of nocturnal bird that fed on human flesh and blood. The Romanian vampire breed named Strigoï has no direct relation to the Greek striges, but was derived from the Roman term strix, as {{is the name of the}} Albanian Shtriga and the Slavic Strzyga, though myths about these creatures are more similar to their Slavic equivalents. Greek vampiric entities are seen once again in Homer's epic Odyssey. In Homer's tale, the undead are too insubstantial to be heard by the living and cannot communicate with them without drinking blood first. In the epic, when Odysseus journeyed into Hades, he was made to sacrifice a black ram and a black ewe so that <b>the</b> <b>shades</b> there could drink its blood and communicate.|$|E

40|$|Abstract]: Scattered UV {{radiation}} is present underneath shade structures due to scattering by {{the atmosphere and}} surroundings. Therefore, the side openings of a shade structure have a direct influence on where <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> is located {{and the level of}} scattered UV in <b>the</b> <b>shaded</b> area. UV exposures were assessed for the decrease in scattered UV beneath specific shade structures as a result of using two types of side on protection, namely, polycarbonate sheeting and vegetation. Anatomical facial dosimetry measurements conducted in <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> of a scale model shade structure during summer and winter showed significant decreases in UV exposure for summer and for winter when polycarbonate sheeting was added to specific sides of <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> structure. Broadband field measurements conducted in <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> of four shade structures with various amounts of vegetation covering different sides, showed that the positioning of vegetation for side-on protection is vital for decreasing the scattered UV in <b>the</b> <b>shade.</b> Adding suitable vegetation and or polycarbonate sheeting to specific sides of shade structures can significantly reduce scattered UV in <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> compared to shade structures that do not utilise any side-on protection. However, side on protection is of little use if the positioning of <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> structure itself is inadequate. The positioning of <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> structure in respect to full sun activities is of key importance particularly where these activities involve infants and children...|$|R

Steve Livengood, chief tour guide for the United States Capitol Historical Society, says he has seen the ghost of former Representative Wilbur Mills (D-Ark.) near Mills' former office late at night. Pierre Charles L'Enfant, although not a politician, was a brevet Major during the American Revolutionary War who served with George Washington at Valley Forge. In 1791, L'Enfant was appointed architect and planner of the new city of Washington in the District of Columbia. Although L'Enfant submitted grandiose plans for the new capital city, his plans were never fully adopted and President Washington dismissed him.

40|$|Abstract]: Broadband field {{measurements}} were conducted beneath three different sized public shade structures, small, medium and large, during the Southern Hemisphere winter. These measurements {{were compared to}} the diffuse UV to quantify {{the relationship of the}} UV under and around <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> structures to <b>the</b> diffuse UV. For <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> structures, a relationship between the diffuse UV and the UV in <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> has been provided for clear skies and solar zenith angles (SZAs) of 49 o to 76 o. This allows the prediction of the UV in <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> of these structures if the diffuse UV is known. The ultraviolet protection factors (UPFs) for <b>the</b> three <b>shade</b> structures ranged from 1. 5 to 5. 4 for decreasing SZA. For the greater SZAs of 70 o to 76 o, the erythemal UV in <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> was 65 %, 59 % and 51 % of that in full sun for the small, medium and large structures respectively. For the smaller SZAs of 50 o to 53 o the erythemal UV in <b>the</b> <b>shade</b> was 35 %, 41 % and 18 % for the small, medium and large shade structures respectively.
