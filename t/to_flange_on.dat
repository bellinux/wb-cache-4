50|$|The {{operation}} of the line has been problematic since its opening. Complaints of noise pollution by residents along the line have led to severe restrictions. Barely {{six months after the}} line's opening, train frequency had to be reduced. On November 1, 1998, the number of cars operating on the line was reduced from six to three. Up until 2007, the operating hours were limited to between 7 am and 9 pm only. Trains currently still operate with a speed limit of 25 km/h due <b>to</b> <b>flange</b> <b>on</b> the line's sharp curves.|$|E

50|$|Intel {{released}} their {{implementation of}} a Vulkan driver for their hardware the day the specification was officially released, {{but it was only}} mainlined in April and so became part of Mesa 12.0, released in July 2016. While already the i965 driver wasn't written according to the Gallium3D specifications, for the Vulkan driver it makes even less sense <b>to</b> <b>flange</b> it <b>on</b> top of Gallium3D. Similarly there is no technical reason <b>to</b> <b>flange</b> it with NIR, but yet Intel's employees implemented their Vulkan driver that way.|$|R
5000|$|The joint {{consists}} {{of a piece of}} doughnut shaped rubber with reinforcing cords vulcanized in it, similar to a tire. This disc is bolted or riveted <b>to</b> <b>flanges</b> mounted <b>on</b> the ends of the shafts to connect the steering wheel shaft to the steering gear. The ragged cords can be seen on the edge of this piece of rubber, hence the term [...] "rag joint". The bolt holes themselves are often reinforced by steel tubes moulded into the doughnut.|$|R

40|$|A {{mechanism}} that blocks concentrated sunlight from reaching a receiver, {{in the event}} of a tracking failure or loss of coolant is described. Sunlight is normally concentrated by a dish reflector onto the opening of a receiver. A faceplate surrounds the opening, and coolant carrying tubes, line the receiver. If the concentrated sunlight wanders so it begins to fall on the faceplate, then the sunlight will melt a portion of a fuse wire portion will break. The wire is attached <b>to</b> a <b>flange</b> <b>on</b> a shutter frame, and breaking of the fuse wire allows the frame to fall. Normally, the shutter frame supports shutter elements that are held open by cam followers that bear against cams...|$|R
50|$|During the trials, the {{locomotive}} gave some trouble due to broken plate frames {{on the engine}} units {{and it was also}} found that the absence of trailing carrying wheels on the engine units was a disadvantage since it led <b>to</b> excessive <b>flange</b> wear <b>on</b> the coupled wheels. As a result, no. 2140 remained the only representative of its Class. All subsequent Garratt models of the SAR were equipped with trailing Bissel trucks.|$|R
5000|$|The holotype {{specimen}} of Texacephale, LSUMNS 20010, {{is composed of}} fused frontals and parietals. A second specimen, LSUMNS 20012, is composed of an incomplete frontoparietal dome. According to the team, the fossilized dome of the animal possessed five <b>to</b> six vertical <b>flanges</b> <b>on</b> each lateral side, connecting it with the postorbital bone. The team interpreted these structures as interlocking [...] "gears" [...] that would help deal with stress on the bone during head-butting, a hypothetical behavior that had earlier been challenged by other authors.|$|R
50|$|During the 1870s {{vertical}} cracks {{developed in}} the plates of the lowest three rings. A local blacksmith called Powell made wrought-iron straps which were bolted <b>to</b> the <b>flanges</b> <b>on</b> {{each side of the}} cracked plates. At the time, the cracks were put down to lateral pressures arising from the settlement of the inner masonry, being composed of rough beach stones and 'bad' mortar. By 1884, 150 straps had been fitted. The compaction of the fill may have been compounded by movement (swaying) of the tower, reported in 1884 by the lighthouse keeper to have been 'several inches'. In 1885, the ground around the tower was strengthened {{with the addition of a}} concrete skirt 18 in deep, bound by a 2 in wide iron band, effectively anchoring the skirt to the base of the tower.|$|R
40|$|The hollow {{flange beam}} (HFB) {{is a new}} cold-formed and resistance-welded section {{developed}} in Australia. Due to its unique geometry comprising two stiff triangular flanges and a slender web, the HFB is susceptible to a lateral-distortional buckling mode of failure involving web distortion. Investigation using finite-element analyses showed {{that the use of}} transverse web plate stiffeners effectively eliminated lateral-distortional buckling of HFBs and thus any associated reduction in flexural capacity. A detailed experimental investigation was then carried out to validate the results from the finite-element analysis and to improve the stiffener configuration further. This {{led to the development of}} a special stiffener that is screw-fastened <b>to</b> the <b>flanges</b> <b>on</b> alternate sides of the web. This paper presents the details of the experimental investigations, the results, and the final stiffener arrangement whereas the details of the finite-element analyses are presented in a companion paper...|$|R

50|$|With the {{development}} of mining operations {{in the northern part}} of Korea, traffic volumes increased significantly, and Sentetsu found a need for a locomotive with strong pulling power suitable for use on mountainous lines with sharp curves and steep slopes. The locomotive designed in response to this need was not of the Mika type, which was Sentetsu's standard freight locomotive, but of the Mate type with 4-8-2 wheel arrangement; the leading bogie was designed <b>to</b> reduce <b>flange</b> wear <b>on</b> the wheels. The resulting Matei class locomotives became a mainstay on long-distance freight trains on mountainous lines.|$|R
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of bending behavior of cold-formed steel profiles is studied. The {{purpose of the}} study was to estimate the influence of section parameters - flange width and size of the wall portion, adjacent <b>to</b> the <b>flange</b> â€“ <b>on</b> {{effectiveness of}} the operation of flexural element consisting of two Sigma sections. As a criterion of effectiveness it was accepted the ratio of maximum bending moment available in the zone of elastic behavior of the section to its area reflecting the material consumption. Effective section characteristics are calculated in accordance with Eurocode 3. It was taken into account the local buckling parts of section and distortional buckling. Variable parameters are: flange width and portion of the wall adjacent <b>to</b> the <b>flange.</b> Calculations were executed by computer program CFSteel. Analysis of obtained results is presented...|$|R

5000|$|The {{locomotive}} was superheated, with a Belpaire firebox, a plate {{frame and}} Walschaerts valve gear. It was erected in the Durban shops {{and placed in}} trial service on the Natal mainline. During the trials {{it was found that}} the absence of trailing carrying wheels on the engine units was a disadvantage, since it led <b>to</b> excessive <b>flange</b> wear <b>on</b> the driving wheels. As a result, the locomotive remained the only representative of its Class and all subsequent Garratt models of the SAR were equipped with trailing Bissel trucks on their engine units. The locomotive was withdrawn from service in 1938 because of a cracked frame and scrapped.|$|R
5000|$|Another distinctive, {{although}} less revolutionary, {{feature of}} the engine was {{the location of the}} tubes carrying the valve pushrods. Rather than being cast inside the cylinder head, thus requiring more cores and complexity, they were outside the main casting of the head. The top and bottom faces of the head were extended <b>to</b> form a <b>flange</b> <b>on</b> the camshaft side of the engine and individual steel tubes were placed through the <b>flanges</b> <b>to</b> enclose each pushrod (a similar system was used for the Volkswagen Beetle engine, albeit with longer tubes {{the entire length of the}} cylinder). These tubes were expanded at top and bottom to seal them and thus became a permanent part of the cylinder head. The separate tubes were reliable, less expensive to manufacture than casting them into the head, and gave that side of the engine its distinctive [...] "hollow" [...] appearance with the rocker box appearing to be supported by columns.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} has AC traction equipment, with a Mitsubishi Electric package {{also used}} on the SD70ACe, including a TA17 traction alternator, CA9E companion alternator and six ITB 2630 traction motors, along with solid state IGBT inverters. The prime mover is a turbocharged 16-cylinder EMD 710. New technology used included passive steer bogies, <b>to</b> reduce <b>flange</b> wear <b>on</b> corners. The class were built at Cardiff, with the frames constructed at Port Augusta, and the bogie frames at Kelso, reliability was instilled in this class through the tireless efforts of Darrell Sherry, and the tight document control of Rob McNulty. The Downer Rail GT46C ACe and the PL class are the only locomotives to bear Rob's personal stamp of approval.|$|R
5000|$|A flange is an {{external}} or internal ridge, or rim (lip), for strength, as the flange of an iron beam {{such as an}} I-beam or a T-beam; or for attachment to another object, as the <b>flange</b> <b>on</b> {{the end of a}} pipe, steam cylinder, etc., or on the lens mount of a camera; or for a flange of a rail car or tram wheel. Thus flanged wheels are wheels with a <b>flange</b> <b>on</b> one side <b>to</b> keep the wheels from running off the rails. The term [...] "flange" [...] is also used for a kind of tool used <b>to</b> form <b>flanges.</b> Pipes with flanges can be assembled and disassembled easily.|$|R

40|$|AbstractStrengthening {{existing}} structures {{under load}} by welding plates is often conducted but little research into this subject was presented. Some researchers {{claim that the}} column strengthened under load has the same ultimate capacity as the column welded without preloading. Others disagree and recommend safe design not allowing the steel to yield. The paper presents the parametric study of wide flange columns HEA 100 strengthened under load via two plates parallel <b>to</b> <b>flanges</b> conducted <b>on</b> numerical models validated by experiment. The varying parameters are thickness of strengthening flange, column length, initial bow imperfection, preload magnitude {{and direction of the}} axis which is pinned while the other axis is fixed. The experimental research consisted of two columns welded without preload and two columns strengthened under preload ratios (preload magnitude divided by base column ultimate strength) equal to 0. 5 (200 kN) and 0. 75 (300 kN). All columns were 3 m long and the boundary conditions were determined by knife-edge bearings which ensured pinned supports in the direction perpendicular to the strong axis and fixed perpendicular to the weak axis. All strengthening plates were welded to columns with intermittent welds. All columns failed via flexural buckling. The numerical models used for the parametric study were created in ANSYS software. Design values and procedures recommended by EN 1993 - 1 - 5, Annex C were used. The most commonly used steel grade S 235 was selected for all plates. Shell 181 element type was used for mapped meshing of steel plates. Element birth and death feature was convenient to simulate strengthening under load...|$|R
