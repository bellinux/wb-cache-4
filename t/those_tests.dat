5|$|Wind {{tunnel and}} flight {{simulator}} {{tests were conducted}} to help to understand the trajectory of the aircraft after the engine detached and the left wing slats retracted. <b>Those</b> <b>tests</b> established that {{the damage to the}} wing's leading edge and retraction of the slats increased the stall speed of the left wing from 124 knots (143mph) to 159 knots (183mph). The DC-10 incorporates two warning devices that might have alerted the pilots to the impending stall: the slat disagreement warning light, which should have illuminated after the uncommanded retraction of the slats, and the stick shaker on the captain's control column, which activates close to the stall speed. Both of these warning devices were powered by an electric generator driven by the number one engine. Both systems became inoperative after the loss of that engine. The first officer's control column was not equipped with a stick shaker; the device was offered by McDonnell Douglas as an option for the first officer, but American Airlines chose not to have it installed on its DC-10 fleet. Stick shakers for both pilots became mandatory in response to this accident.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} distinction made by any staging system {{is whether or}} not the cancer is still confined to the prostate. In the TNM system, clinical T1 and T2 cancers are found only in the prostate, while T3 and T4 cancers have spread elsewhere. Several tests can be used to look for evidence of spread. Medical specialty professional organizations recommend against the use of PET scans, CT scans, or bone scans when a physician stages early prostate cancer with low risk for metastasis. <b>Those</b> <b>tests</b> would be appropriate in such cases as when a CT scan evaluates spread within the pelvis, a bone scan look for spread to the bones, and endorectal coil magnetic resonance imaging to closely evaluate the prostatic capsule and the seminal vesicles. Bone scans should reveal osteoblastic appearance due to increased bone density in the areas of bone metastasis—opposite to what is found in many other cancers that metastasize.|$|E

40|$|Rates of HIV testing are {{increasing}} among {{men who have}} sex with men (MSM) in Scotland and the UK. However, it remains vital to encourage MSM to test for HIV. The aim of the current study was to determine which factors discriminated among three groups of MSM: <b>those</b> <b>tested</b> for HIV within the previous year, <b>those</b> who had <b>tested</b> over one year previously, and those who had never tested. Cross-sectional data were collected using self-report, anonymous questionnaires from MSM frequenting gay venues in Glasgow, Scotland, during July 2010 (N = 822, response rate 62. 6 %). Those who identified themselves as HIV positive (n = 38), did not normally reside in Scotland (n = 88), and did not provide information on HIV testing (n = 13), were excluded (139 excluded, leaving N = 683). Around 57 % (n = 391) had tested for HIV within the previous year, 23 % (n = 155) had tested over one year previously and 20 % (n = 137) had never <b>tested.</b> Compared with <b>those</b> <b>tested</b> within the previous year, <b>those</b> <b>tested</b> over one year previously and <b>those</b> never <b>tested</b> had greater fear of a positive-HIV test result, a weaker norm for HIV testing, and were more likely to have had no anal sex partners at all within the previous year. <b>Those</b> <b>tested</b> over one year previously were significantly older than both other groups (who were more likely to be under 25 years of age). Unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) did not discriminate among the HIV testing groups. The results highlight the need to promote HIV testing in Scotland among those under 25 years and over 45 years, those with high fear of <b>testing,</b> and <b>those</b> whose sexual behaviour puts them at risk. Interventions to increase HIV testing should promote positive norms and challenge the fear of a positive result...|$|R

25|$|However, Sharif's effort {{seemed to}} be wasted when Sharif ordered the nuclear tests in 1998. Following <b>those</b> <b>tests,</b> the foreign policy of Pakistan was much in trouble {{position}} since its 1971 disaster. Pakistan, at United Nations, failed to gather any support from its allies. Trade agreements were abrogated by Europe, United States, and Asian bloc. While Sharif was praised for carrying out tests domestically. Sharif was heavily criticised for ordering internationally. Pakistan's nuclear weapons and energy programme was targeted on multiple times over its involvement for spreading the nuclear proliferation. United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, however did not criticised Pakistan but both neither issued any statement. On 7 June 1998, Sharif visited UAE for talks {{on the situation in}} South Asia after nuclear tests in the region. He thanked the government for their support after India conducted five nuclear tests on 11 and 13 May. The major shift in his conservative foreign policy was notice on 11 June 1998, when Nawaz Sharif authorised a secret meeting of Pakistan Ambassador to United Nations Inam-ul-Haq and Pakistan Ambassador to the United States Dr. Maliha Lodhi, to chair a meeting with their Israeli counterparts, the Israel Ambassador to the United States Eliyahu Ben-Elissar and the Israel Ambassador to United Nations Dore Gold, at a seven star hotel in New York, United States. The Prime minister sent a secret courier to Israel and to his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu (now current Prime minister), though his diplomats, where Pakistan assured Israel that Pakistan will not transfer nuclear technology or materials to Iran or to other Middle Eastern countries. In June 1998, Israel had directed a secret courier to Pakistan that Israeli officials had feared that Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi's visit to Pakistan shortly after its May 1998 nuclear weapons tests was a sign that Pakistan was preparing to sell nuclear technology to Iran.|$|E

500|$|The {{opportunity}} for the row hammer effect to occur in DDR3 memory is primarily attributed to DDR3's high density of memory cells {{and the results of}} associated interactions between the cells, while rapid DRAM row activations have been determined as the primary cause. [...] Frequent row activations cause voltage fluctuations on the associated row selection lines, which have been observed to induce higher-than-natural discharge rates in capacitors belonging to nearby (adjacent, in most cases) memory rows, which are called victim rows; if the affected memory cells are not refreshed before they lose too much charge, disturbance errors occur. [...] Tests show that a disturbance error may be observed after performing around 139,000 subsequent memory row accesses (with cache flushes), and that up to one memory cell in every 1,700 cells may be susceptible. [...] <b>Those</b> <b>tests</b> also show that the rate of disturbance errors is not substantially affected by increased environment temperature, while it depends on the actual contents of DRAM because certain bit patterns result in significantly higher disturbance error rates.|$|E
500|$|Ultimately, Kennedy {{sided with}} those arguing for resumed testing. In particular, an {{argument}} by William C. Foster, {{the head of}} the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, swayed Kennedy. Foster argued that if the US failed to respond to the Soviet test series, Moscow could order a second test series, which could give the Soviet Union a significant advantage. Furthermore, a second test series, without US reciprocation, could damage the push for a test ban and make Senate ratification of any agreement less likely. On 2 March 1962, building on the November 1961 announcement, Kennedy promised to resume atmospheric testing by the end of April 1962 if Moscow continued to resist the Anglo-American test-ban proposal. To an extent, the announcement was a compromise, as Kennedy restricted atmospheric tests to <b>those</b> <b>tests</b> which were [...] "absolutely necessary," [...] not feasible underground, and minimized fallout. The condition that testing would resume only if the Soviet Union continued to oppose the Anglo-American proposal also served as a concession to dissenting voices within his administration and to Macmillan.|$|E
