5|$|After finals wins {{against the}} Western Bulldogs and Collingwood, Harley and Geelong progressed through <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> Final against St Kilda {{for a third}} {{successive}} season.

However, Geelong prevailed by 12 points to win the 2009 AFL premiership and capture its second premiership cup within three seasons.|$|E
5|$|As a state highway, M-44 {{dates back}} to around July 1, 1919, and it was routed along a section of its modern route at that time. The eastern end was altered in the late 1920s, and the western end was {{extended}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> Rapids area in the 1970s. For over 20years, M-44 was truncated to remove the M-37 concurrency. Since 2003 though, the highway has terminated at the intersection with 28th Street.|$|E

5|$|For {{thousands}} of years, the Takelma Indians inhabited the Illinois Valley. Their culture was destroyed when gold {{was discovered in}} the early 1850s, causing the subsequent Rogue River Wars. After an 1853 treaty, most of the Takelmas lived on the Table Rock Reservation. In 1856, after the wars ended, they were moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> Ronde Reservation and the Siletz Reservation.|$|E
5|$|Grand Duchess Marguerite Louise and Dowager Grand Duchess Vittoria vied {{with each}} other for power. The Dowager, after a {{protracted}} battle, triumphed: The Grand Duke assigned his mother the day-to-day administration of the state. Cosimo III commenced his reign with the utmost fervour, attempting to salvage the sinking exchequer and allowing his subjects to petition him for arbitration in disputes. The novelty soon wore off, however. Vittoria, Cosimo having lost his taste for administration, was further empowered by admission <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Grand</b> Duke's Consulta (Privy Council). Marguerite Louise, deprived of any political influence, went about arranging Prince Ferdinando's education and aruing with Vittoria over precedence, which only further encamped Cosimo on his mother's side. In the midst of this, on the first anniversary of Ferdinando II's death, Gian Gastone was born <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> ducal couple.|$|E

5|$|If {{the grand}} jury right attaches, every element of the charged crime must be {{submitted}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>grand</b> jury. Thus, the prosecution cannot augment the indictment without returning to a grand jury. But, the government may narrow the indictment without so returning.|$|E
