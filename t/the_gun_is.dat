5|$|An assault is {{not caused}} if a {{defendant}} threatens {{to shoot the}} victim, but the victim is aware that <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> not loaded or fake. However, {{it would be the}} actus reus of an assault if the victim wrongly believes <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is,</b> or may be, loaded. Since assault is a summary offence, no prosecutions take place for attempted assault. However, it is possible to commit attempts of aggravated forms of assault.|$|E
5|$|The PS90 is a carbine {{version of}} the P90, {{intended}} for civilian shooters for personal protection and sporting use; it was introduced in 2005, {{and continues to be}} offered in several configurations. The PS90 will accept the standard 50-round P90 magazines, but <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> supplied with a magazine that is blocked to a capacity of 10 or 30 rounds, allowing it to be sold in jurisdictions where magazine capacities are restricted by law.|$|E
5|$|Qwak! is a single-player duck hunting light gun shooter arcade game {{in which}} the player uses a rifle-shaped light gun to fire at targets on the screen. One duck at a time flies across the screen, with each duck {{appearing}} {{in a different place}} {{on the sides of the}} screen and flying in different paths. The player is allowed three shots to hit the duck as it flies across the screen. As with other light gun games, a hit is registered if <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> pointed at the duck or similar light source when the trigger is pulled; no projectile is fired. When a shot is fired, a mark appears on the screen where the player was aiming; if the shot misses the duck, it changes direction away from the bullet. If the player hits a duck, it falls to the ground, and a hunting dog runs over and collects it. Each duck hit adds a small image of a duck to a row at the top of the screen. An screen overlay shows an image of marsh reeds and a tree branch. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> attached to the game cabinet by a metal cord, and is holstered in a small circular recess in the cabinet when not in use. Attempting to remove the gun sounds an alarm buzzer. Each game costs a quarter, and runs until the time limit runs out. Machines have adjustable time limits or can be set to run each game indefinitely, starting the score count over when the start button is pressed.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>the</b> episodes, <b>the</b> <b>gun(s)</b> <b>were</b> used by Napoleon Solo and Illya Kuryakin. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> {{extremely}} popular with viewers. MGM {{began to get}} fan mail addressed to [...] "The Gun." [...] At one point <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> getting 500 letters per week. A US Army Ordinance General once asked if a few of <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> available, {{he would like to}} borrow them for testing as possible weapons for the armed forces.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> then {{dismantled}} {{and moved}} to {{the northern part of the}} eastern front, where an attack was planned on Leningrad. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> placed 30km (18.6mi) from the city near the railway station of Taizy. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> fully operational when the attack <b>was</b> cancelled. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> then spent <b>the</b> winter of 1942/43 near Leningrad.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> {{developed}} into M1A1 and M2 variants. After World War II, the United States Army re-organized, and <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> re-designated as <b>the</b> M59.|$|R
5|$|Thuppakki (<b>The</b> <b>Gun)</b> <b>is</b> a 2012 Tamil-language Indian action-thriller film {{written and}} {{directed}} by AR Murugadoss. It features Vijay and Kajal Aggarwal in the lead roles, Vidyut Jammwal as the antagonist, as well as Jayaram and Sathyan in supporting roles. The film, produced by S. Thanu, features background score and soundtrack composed by Harris Jayaraj with cinematography handled by Santosh Sivan.

5|$|If {{the player}} follows Gail, they go after an unknown man, but end up losing him. Rick then tells Regina that Tom's dead. If the player follows Rick, they come across Tom, badly injured and near death. Rick takes {{him to the}} medical room, however a Velociraptor attacks them, but Tom sacrifices himself to kill it and save Rick. Later, Regina and the team manage to locate Kirk and {{apprehend}} him. As they are preparing to leave via helicopter, the T. rex returns and destroys the helicopter, forcing them to flee back into the base while Kirk manages to escape. Regina and Rick flee into the facility and locate keys to a watercraft, but find a vortex {{in the way of}} getting to it. Rick speculates this is the spacetime distortion that brought the dinosaurs back. The two split up to find an alternate route off the island, and Regina ends up being held at gunpoint by Dr. Kirk. He is about to kill her when <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> shot out of his hand by Gail, and they arrest him again.|$|E
5|$|Qwak! was {{released}} in a standard upright arcade cabinet with {{a black and white}} raster television monitor inset, with the rifle holster and start button below as the only controls. The reeds and tree branch overlay is screen printed in color onto a clear panel in front of the monitor, and is backlit by the screen; the screen is lit with a gray background instead of a black one in order to produce this effect. When <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> triggered, the duck additionally flashes white briefly, so as to be detected by the light gun; the relative brightness of the screen makes this effect less obvious than with other similar light gun games. Qwak! was not the first light gun video game; it was preceded by the arcade game Balloon Gun (August 1974) and a light gun game for the Magnavox Odyssey video game console (1972), as well as non-video game light gun games since the 1936 Seeberg Ray-O-Lite.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> {{commissioned}} {{and first}} fired in 1892. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> emplacement <b>was</b> provided with two range finder positions.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Gatling <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> {{first used}} in warfare during the American Civil War. Twelve of <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> {{purchased}} personally by Union commanders {{and used in}} the trenches during the siege of Petersburg, Virginia (June 1864 - April 1865). Eight other Gatling <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> fitted on gunboats. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> not accepted by the American Army until 1866, when a sales representative of the manufacturing company demonstrated it in combat.|$|R
50|$|Introduced in 1942, <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> {{similar to}} <b>the</b> Type 98 20 mm AA machine cannon, but {{these could be}} {{elevated}} to 95 degrees and had a central fire-control system. The central fire-control system developed for the Type 2 could control and direct six of <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> at once. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> based on <b>the</b> German 2 cm Flak 30/38/Flakvierling. The Type 2 number was designated for <b>the</b> year <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> accepted, 2602 in the Japanese imperial year calendar, or 1942 in the Gregorian calendar.|$|R
5|$|There is no {{recorded}} {{history of the}} cannon between 1613 and 1795, when the Acehnese sent the Seri Rambai to Sultan Ibrahim of Selangor in return for his brother's services in a military campaign. The Selangor incident began in June 1871 when pirates commandeered a Penang junk, killing its thirty-four passengers and crew, and taking the vessel to Selangor. The British colonial government responded swiftly: a steamer and Royal Navy warship were dispatched to Selangor with instructions to arrest the pirates and recover the stolen junk. After a series of skirmishes {{and the arrival of}} support troops and artillery, the town was burned, the forts demolished and the Seri Rambai taken to Penang. The loss of the cannon was deeply felt in Selangor: a local prophecy maintains that only when <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> returned will the town regain its former eminence.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> issued {{with one}} magazine, a sling, {{cleaning}} kit, oil can and magazine pouch.|$|E
25|$|An Oerlikon 20 mm cannon {{was placed}} {{on the top of the}} tower for {{anti-aircraft}} purposes. In 2012, <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> no longer present, but its steel support can be seen.|$|E
50|$|The Finnish Army {{captured}} 29 {{guns and}} bought an additional 47 from German surplus stocks during World War II. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> called 76 K 36 in Finnish service. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> in active service until the 1960s and was stored until the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|The {{propellant}} {{charge for}} the Long Tom was carried in a canvas bag which was about 56 cm long. Black powder was used and this caused a large cloud of white smoke when <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> fired. <b>The</b> enemy immediately knew where <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> {{composed}} of twin Bofors 57mm guns installed on a custom naval mounting that maintained {{the system in}} mechanical equilibrium, even when firing. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>were</b> water-cooled and fed by large 80-cartridge magazines that allowed several long bursts to be fired without reloading.|$|R
25|$|The gas-operated gun is a dual feed {{multipurpose}} small caliber weapon, {{that has}} a dual rate of fire with a minimum rate of 200-300 or 550 rounds per minute (rds/min), where the rapid fire mode assures 800 rds/min. The sustained rate of fire is 200 rds/min, though. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> intended for engaging materiel, low flying aircraft, light vehicles, and dismounted infantry. With a muzzle velocity of 960m/s, <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> capable of defeating a light Armored Personnel Carrier at a range of 1,500 meters, a soft-skinned vehicle at 4,000 meters, and slow-flying aircraft at altitudes up to 2,000 meters and slant ranges of up to 2,500 meters.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> manoeuvred by {{the body}} of the gunner, who is {{attached}} to the weapon. Firing is guided through the same optical visor as used with the Bofors 40mm gun and the Oerlikon 20mm cannon.|$|E
25|$|Under the Gun Theater is a {{professional}} theater company located in Chicago, Illinois. Founded by Angie McMahon and Kevin Mullaney, Under <b>the</b> <b>Gun</b> <b>is</b> a sketch and improvisational comedy theater which opened in Chicago's Lake View community in 2014.|$|E
2500|$|... 57 55 J was {{accepted}} {{for use as}} training weapon in 1950s {{because of a lack}} of suitable training guns and no funds to buy new ones. The old 57mm Nordenfelt and Hotchkiss <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> worn-out, and 76mm <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> kept in reserve, so 57 55 J, among other old <b>guns,</b> <b>was</b> used as training piece. Some of <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> converted for sub-caliber training for the 234/50 Be and 305/52 O <b>guns.</b> <b>The</b> <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> refurbished at beginning of the 1960s and sub-caliber <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> converted back to the normal configuration, but <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> removed from use and placed into storage in 1965–1966.|$|R
50|$|A {{final test}} of <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> {{conducted}} at <b>the</b> Washington Arsenal in August 1864, {{with a report}} issued in 1866 indicating that <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> reliable and performed well during the testing. As a result, an additional five <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> ordered, but advances in firearms technology soon rendered the weapon obsolete.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> {{supplied}} by İbrahim Şahin.|$|R
25|$|The GAU-8/A {{utilizes}} recoil adapters. They are {{the interface}} between the gun housing and the gun mount. By absorbing (in compression) the recoil forces, they spread {{the time of the}} recoil impulse and counter recoil energy transmitted to the supporting structure when <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> fired.|$|E
25|$|The Typing of the Dead is a {{modification}} of Sega's 1998 light gun arcade game The House of the Dead 2 in which <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> replaced by a computer keyboard.

25|$|Under <b>the</b> <b>Gun</b> <b>is</b> an {{ensemble}} theater. Typically {{an ensemble}}-based company is formed {{by a group}} of artists (actors, directors, designers, playwrights, etc.) who work collaboratively to create each production. The theater holds annual auditions to discover new ensemble members. The directors and ensemble members had created several original written shows at the theatre’s inception: The Last Mall Santa, Halloween Hell House, and The Zombie Diaries.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>guns</b> of Battery French {{were removed}} in 1917 for {{potential}} {{service on the}} Western Front; three of <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> sent to France for use on field carriages, but sources indicate that none of <b>the</b> 6-inch <b>gun</b> regiments completed training before the Armistice and thus they did not see combat. <b>The</b> <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> not returned to Fort Kearny.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>guns</b> <b>were</b> {{fitted to}} a tripod, to which wheels could be {{attached}} for transport. <b>The</b> <b>guns</b> could also <b>be</b> carried by four men, after being {{broken down into}} two, two-man loads - <b>the</b> 104 lb <b>gun</b> and recoil mechanism, and the 84 lb trails. Some were equipped with an gun shield.The breech-block of <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> essentially a smaller version of that fitted to the well-known French 75 gun.|$|R

25|$|Captain Leavitt {{eventually}} {{retired from}} whaling, {{and moved to}} Honolulu, Hawaii, where he worked overseeing a railroad. But his Inupiat descendants stayed on in Barrow, Alaska, where today there are many Inupiat Leavitts in the local phone book. The Maine sea captain's descendant James Leavitt owns a darting gun carried aboard his ancestor's ship Balaena. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> still in use by a local Inupiat whaling crew.|$|E
25|$|Thus, DA {{means that}} a cocking action {{separate}} from the trigger pull is unnecessary; every trigger pull {{will result in a}} complete cycle. This allows uncocked carry, while also allowing draw-and-fire using only the trigger. A longer and harder trigger stroke is the trade-off. However, this drawback can also be viewed as a safety feature, as <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> safer against accidental discharges from being dropped.|$|E
25|$|The {{man with}} <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>is</b> {{the leader of}} the ward of hoodlums that seizes control of the food supply in the quarantine. He and his ward take the rations by force and {{threaten}} to shoot anyone who doesn't comply. This ward extorts valuables from the other internees in exchange for food and, when the bracelets and watches run out, they begin to rape the women. He is later stabbed to death by the doctor's wife.|$|E
5000|$|Jump <b>the</b> <b>Gun</b> <b>was</b> an Irish pop/rock band, {{best known}} for {{competing}} in the Eurovision Song Contest 1988 with the song [...] "Take Him Home".

50|$|While <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> {{carriage}} <b>was</b> an old design, <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> itself <b>was</b> a {{new design}} created by Krupp; though the design had been shelved {{at the time}} of its conception. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> had two distinctive features; first was the large four-baffle muzzle brake and the second was the vertical sliding block breech that was considered unusual for a Krupp designed <b>gun.</b> <b>The</b> breech operated in a semi-automatic fashion; once <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> fired <b>the</b> breech block would open and eject the spent casing and remained open to allow for rapid reloading. The breech would then be closed once the next round <b>was</b> loaded and <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> then ready to fire.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>gun</b> <b>was</b> {{fitted with}} a set of sights on the centre of the barrel. This enabled <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> to <b>be</b> sighted for indirect, or direct fire. A flat surface was {{machined}} on top of the barrel for a clinometer to <b>be</b> used, enabling <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> to <b>be</b> levelled, or to provide an alternate method of indirect sighting.|$|R
