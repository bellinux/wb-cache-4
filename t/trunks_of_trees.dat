5|$|Phellinus ellipsoideus {{has been}} {{recorded}} growing on the fallen wood of oaks of the subgenus Cyclobalanopsis, {{as well as the}} wood of other flowering plants. The species favours the <b>trunks</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees,</b> where it feeds as a saprotroph, causing white rot. P.ellipsoideus fruit bodies are perennial growers, allowing them to, in the correct circumstances, grow very large. The species is found in the tropical and subtropical areas of China; it {{has been recorded}} in Fujian Province and Hainan Province. It is not a common species, and fruit bodies are only occasionally encountered.|$|E
5|$|Woodpeckers, piculets and wrynecks all possess {{characteristic}} zygodactyl feet, {{consisting of}} four toes, the first (hallux) {{and the fourth}} facing backward and {{the second and third}} facing forward. This foot arrangement is good for grasping the limbs and <b>trunks</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees.</b> Members of this family can walk vertically up a tree trunk, which is beneficial for activities such as foraging for food or nest excavation. In addition to their strong claws and feet, woodpeckers have short, strong legs. This is typical of birds that regularly forage on trunks. Exceptions are the black-backed woodpecker and the American and Eurasian three-toed woodpeckers, which have only three toes on each foot. The tails of all woodpeckers, except the piculets and wrynecks, are stiffened, and when the bird perches on a vertical surface, the tail and feet work together to support it.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí {{evolved from}} plane to spatial geometry, to ruled geometry. These {{constructional}} forms are highly {{suited to the}} use of cheap materials such as brick. Gaudí frequently used brick laid with mortar in successive layers, as in the traditional Catalan vault, using the brick laid flat instead of on its side. This quest for new structural solutions culminated between 1910 and 1920, when he exploited his research and experience in his masterpiece, the Sagrada Família. Gaudí conceived the interior of the church {{as if it were a}} forest, with a set of tree-like columns divided into various branches to support a structure of intertwined hyperboloid vaults. He inclined the columns so they could better resist the perpendicular pressure on their section. He also gave them a double-turn helicoidal shape (right turn and left turn), as in the branches and <b>trunks</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees.</b> This created a structure that is now known as fractal. Together with a modulation of the space that divides it into small, independent and self-supporting modules, it creates a structure that perfectly supports the mechanical traction forces without need for buttresses, as required by the neo-Gothic style. Gaudí thus achieved a rational, structured and perfectly logical solution, creating at the same time a new architectural style that was original, simple, practical and aesthetic.|$|E

25|$|Bryophytes (mosses and liverworts) {{flourish}} in the park, due partly to the area's mild oceanic climate. The park is internationally significant for bryophytes. Many of the bryophytes found in the park are not found anywhere else in Ireland. Mosses, ferns such as filmy ferns, and liverworts grow luxuriantly. Many of them live as epiphytes, growing on the branches and <b>trunks</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees.</b>|$|E
25|$|Eastern gray {{squirrels}} generally prefer constructing their dens upon large {{tree branches}} {{and within the}} hollow <b>trunks</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees.</b> They also {{have been known to}} take shelter within abandoned bird nests. The dens are usually lined with moss plants, thistledown, dried grass, and feathers. These perhaps provide and assist in the insulation of the den, used to reduce heat loss. A cover to the den is usually built afterwards.|$|E
25|$|The {{return to}} St. Augustine proved even more arduous and {{dangerous}} than the journey out. The Spaniards crossed the deeper and larger streams on the <b>trunks</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> which they felled for makeshift bridges. A tall palmetto was climbed, and the trail {{by which they}} had come was found. They encamped that night on a bit of dry ground, where a fire was built to dry their soaking garments, but the heavy rain began again.|$|E

25|$|Gypsy moth egg masses are {{typically}} laid on branches and <b>trunks</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees,</b> {{but may be}} found in any sheltered location, including rocks, foliage and vehicles. Female gypsy moths are flightless, so they lay eggs on a surface near where they emerged from their pupa. The eggs are covered in a coating of hairs. The covering provides protection from predators and parasites, and may be important for insulating the eggs from cold and for sealing in moisture.|$|E
25|$|Another early {{technique}} involved {{complete removal}} of brush and woody vegetation from an area. Tsetse tend {{to rest on}} the <b>trunks</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> so removing woody vegetation made the area inhospitable to the flies. However, the technique was not widely used and has been abandoned. Preventing regrowth of woody vegetation requires continuous clearing efforts, which is only practical where large human populations are present. The clearing of woody vegetation has come to be seen as an environmental problem more than a benefit.|$|E
25|$|When the {{population}} is spread out and running low, pupation can take place under flaps of bark, in crevices, under branches, on the ground, and in other places where larvae rested. During periods when population numbers are dense, pupation is not restricted to these locations, but can take place in sheltered and open locations, even exposed on the <b>trunks</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> or on foliage of nonhost trees. Usually, the caterpillars create flimsy cocoons made of silk strands holding the leaf together, while others do not cover their pupae in cocoons, but rather hang from a twig or tree bark, like butterfly pupae do.|$|E

25|$|Philodendron {{species can}} be found in many diverse {{habitats}} in the tropical Americas and the West Indies. Most occur in humid tropical forests, but can also be found in swamps and on river banks, roadsides and rock outcrops. They are also found throughout the diverse range of elevations from sea level to over 2000 m above sea level. Species of this genus are often found clambering over other plants, or climbing the <b>trunks</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> with the aid of aerial roots. Philodendrons usually distinguish themselves in their environment by their large numbers compared to other plants, making them a highly noticeable component of the ecosystems in which they are found. They are found in great numbers in road clearings.|$|E

2500|$|Sittellas forage on {{horizontal}} {{branches and}} the <b>trunks</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees.</b> Their foraging techniques {{has been described}} as hopping rapidly along the length of a horizontal branch, pausing briefly to peer for prey, occasionally hanging underneath the branch but usually on top of it. Most of the time is spent on branches rather than on the trunks. Birds on the trunks may travel upwards or downwards. Within the forest sittellas usually forage in the canopy. There are sexual differences in foraging, with males and females choosing to forage in slightly different microhabitats within the tree. Prey items are usually gleaned directly from the bark, although in a few instances sittellas will sally from the branch in order to snatch aerial prey. Having obtained prey sittellas will use their feet to hold it while they eat it, in a similar manner to parrots, and will also use their feet in order to hold back strips of bark in order to pry underneath it. [...] There have even been isolated reports of tool use in some populations of sittellas. Sticks were used to pry boring beetle larvae out of cavities, in a similar fashion to that of tool using woodpecker finches of the Galapagos.|$|E

2500|$|The Mauritian tomb bat (Taphozous mauritianus) is {{a species}} of sac-winged bat in the family Emballonuridae that is found in central and {{southern}} Africa and Madagascar. It was discovered in 1818 by Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, and is characterized by an all-white ventral surface, grizzled dorsal coloration, and conical face. It has exceptionally good eyesight, a trait which is common in old world bats and enables it to find roosting locations. [...] It has adapted itself {{to a wide range}} of habitats including subarid scrub to semi-tropical savanna and can be found throughout much of Africa south of the Sahara, including many of the surrounding islands. They often seek out refuge in cool dry areas. Mauritian tomb bats help control pest populations, including insects that carry human diseases. These bats tend to be nocturnal hunters and their normal prey consists of moths, butterflies, and termites. Not prone to large scale roosting, T. mauritianus is most often spotted on the sides of buildings or on the <b>trunks</b> <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> in groups of around five individuals. They breed on average once or twice a year and rear usually one pup, though twins are occasionally reported. They usually deposit their hungry offspring in areas where they can feed ferociously, most often in berry bushes. This species is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List due their wide distribution and stable population.|$|E
