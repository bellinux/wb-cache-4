40|$|Fisheries {{over the}} years evolved from {{subsistence}} fishing towards a capital intensive enterprise. There has been structural transformation in the fishing fleet with motorisation and mechanisation. The current scenario of marine fisheries in terms of fishing fleets clearly indicates a situation “too many boats chasing too few fishes”. Due to the tragedy of commons in operation, increasing fleet size as well as costs of fishing and the decreasing catch per unit efforts, the fishing operations have taken a toll. The mechanised sector is venturing into multiday fishing which negate the losses of fishing cost. Sizeable amount of low value fishes are landed across the landing centres on account of targeted fishing. Low value fishes include juveniles, bycatch, <b>trash</b> <b>fishes</b> and discards and {{it is estimated that}} around 30 % of the mechanised landings constitute low value fishes which has a huge untapped economic value.

Pelagic fishes were distributed between anchovies (Stolephorus spp., 19 percent), Indo-Pacific mackerel (Rastrelliger brachysoma, 18 percent), sardinellas (Sardinellars spp., 14 percent), scad (11 percent), longtail tuna (Thunnus tonggol, 9 percent), eastern little tuna (Euthynnus affinis, 6 percent), trevallies (6 percent), bigeye scad (5 percent), Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta, 4 percent), king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla, 3 percent), torpedo scad (Megalaspis cordyla , 2 percent), wolf herrings (1 percent), and others (2 percent). Demersal fish production was dominated by purple-spotted bigeye (Priacanthus tayenus), threadfin bream (Nemipterus hexodon), brushtooth lizardfish (Saurida undosquamis), slender lizardfish (Saurida elongata) and Jinga shrimp (Metapenaeus affinis). Most species are overfished since the 1970s-1990s, except for Spanish mackerel (Scomberomorus commersoni), carangidae and torpedo scad (Meggalaspis spp.). The overall overfishing rate was 333 percent for pelagic and 245 percent for demersal species in 1991. Cephalopods are divided into squid, cuttlefish and molluscs, where squid and cuttlefish in Thai waters consists of 10 families, 17 genera and over 30 species. The main mollusk species captured in the Andaman Sea are scallop, blood cockle (Anadara granosa) and short-necked clam. Their collection requires bottom dredge gears, which damage the sea floor and the gears themselves and are becoming unpopular.

40|$|En: M. R. Hasan and M. Halwart (eds). Fish as feed inputs for aquaculture: practices, {{sustainability}} and implications. FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Technical Paper. No. 518. Rome, FAO. The main aim of {{this report}} is to review the status of and future trends in Chilean small pelagic fisheries. The report discusses the implication of using small pelagic fish species for direct human consumption and as the main protein ingredient in aquafeeds for the sustainable development of the Chilean fisheries and aquaculture industries. The fisheries sector represents an important industry in Chile, and its contribution to both the national economy and global supplies is significant. However, future development will require an increased emphasis on the sustainable use of natural resources. Chile is making concerted efforts to regulate all fishing activity and has given special priority to ensuring the sustainable development of this industry. The total Chilean fishery landing in 2006 was around 4. 9 million tonnes, which represents {{a significant decrease in}} comparison with the previous year and a volume that is 5 percent lower than the average for the period 2001 – 2005. This volume originates from two main sources: the capture fisheries sector, with 4. 08 million tonnes and the aquaculture sector, with an estimated production of around 822. 7 thousand tonnes. In 2006, 61 percent of the capture fisheries sector was contributed by pelagic resources, a figure that is slightly less than the value reported for the previous year. Trends in Chilean fishery and aquaculture production over the last ten years reveal the increasing importance of the aquaculture sector. With the increase in aquaculture production, the use of fishmeal and fish oil in aquafeeds has increased significantly in Chile. The main pelagic species used for the production of fishmeal and fish oil, and the most important pelagic resources in Chile, are the Inca scad or Chilean jack mackerel (Trachurus murphyi), the anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) and two sardines (the South American pilchard, Sardinops sagax, and the Araucarian herring or common sardine, Strangomera bentincki), which contributed 45, 30 and 13 percent of the total accumulated landings for 2006, respectively. However, marked reduction in the captures of these species has been constant. The main species destined for the production of fishmeal and fish oil come from the industrial and artisanal pelagic fisheries. Anchoveta contributes 41 percent of the total fishmeal production, followed by jack mackerel with 27 percent; <b>trash</b> fish/low-value <b>fish</b> represent 15 percent, while other species contribute only 3. 3 percent. In the last decade, the fishmeal production declined by almost 50 percent because of the substantial decrease in landings from these fisheries. In 2005, 1. 78 million tonnes of processed fishery products were produced. Fishmeal and fish oil represented around half of the products processed, followed by frozen products, with a 27 percent share, while fresh chilled and canned products together comprised 17 percent. From {{the second half of the}} decade 1995 – 2005, the production of fishmeal from overall pelagic fish landings was more or less constant, averaging 21 percent; however, canned product production from the same species increased slightly, rising from 2. 1 to 2. 8 percent. This means that the increased production of canned products from pelagic fish is directly correlated with the reduction in fishmeal production. Of the total fishmeal produced in Chile, approximately 40 percent (340 thousand tonnes) is used for domestic consumption. Given that Chilean aquafeed production is on the order of 850 thousand tonnes, the inclusion of fishmeal in these feeds is around 240 thousand tonnes. The limited availability of fishmeal, unstable prices and a principle of economic and environmental sustainability has driven the aquaculture industry to look for alternative protein sources. Consequently, the reduction in fishmeal inclusion levels seen over the last few years has been substantial, a great portion of the fishmeal component in aquafeeds having been replaced by different plant and animal protein substitutes. Fishmeal substitution in the Chilean aquafeed industry was initiated around ten years ago as a direct result of the reduction in capture volumes of small pelagic species. During the last decade, the capture fisheries sector has been characterized by a remarkable reduction in the labour force. Two of the main causes of this diminution are a reduction in the fishing fleet and an increased efficiency of processing plants. A sustained Status and trends on the use of small pelagic fish species in Chile 291 increase in the labour force in the aquaculture sector might compensate for the reduced employment in the capture fisheries sector. The salmon aquaculture industry is one of the most important employment generators in many areas of Chile, where poverty levels are much lower than the national average. The employment generated by this rising industry has a positive impact on poverty indicators for rural communities. The hypothetical scenario of redirecting the use of jack mackerel from fishmeal production to the production of food for direct human consumption might have a positive effect. However, from the point of view of increased food security and poverty alleviation, the impact of the alternative use of this resource for human consumption might not be very significant, given that its products are not in high demand and would be mainly destined for export.
