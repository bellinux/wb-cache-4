5|$|BAE Systems {{announced}} that, in December 2013, {{the company}} had test flown a Tornado equipped with parts that were made with 3D printing equipment. <b>The</b> <b>parts</b> included a protective cover for the radio, a landing-gear guard and air-intake door support struts. The test demonstrated the feasibility of making replacement parts quickly and cheaply at the air base hosting the Tornado. The company claimed that, with some of <b>the</b> <b>parts</b> costing less than £100 per piece to manufacture, 3D printing already resulted in savings of more than £300,000 and would offer further potential cost savings of more than £1.2million through 2017.|$|E

5|$|Agnew and Beverly {{moved to}} the Los Alamos Laboratory in March 1943. Agnew, Beverly and Bernard Waldman first went to the University of Illinois, where the men {{disassembled}} the Cockcroft–Walton generator and particle accelerator while Beverly catalogued all <b>the</b> <b>parts.</b> <b>The</b> <b>parts</b> were shipped to New Mexico, where Agnew and Beverly met up with them, and rode the trucks hauling them to the Los Alamos Laboratory. There, Beverly worked a secretary, initially with Robert Oppenheimer and his secretary Priscilla Green. She then became secretary to Robert Bacher, the head of Physics (P) Division, and later the Gadget (G) Division, {{for the rest of}} the war. Agnew's job was to reassemble the accelerator, which was then used for experiments by John Manley's group.|$|E
50|$|Quench Presses {{are able}} to quench <b>the</b> <b>part</b> while it is being held because of the unique {{structure}} of the clamps holding <b>the</b> <b>part.</b> Clamps are slotted so that oil or water can flow through each slot and cool <b>the</b> <b>part</b> and <b>the</b> ribs of the clamps can hold <b>the</b> <b>part</b> in place.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>part</b> between <b>the</b> Damsterdiep and the Noordermolen is {{now called}} the Borgsloot boven de Rollen. <b>The</b> <b>part</b> from <b>the</b> Noordermolen to the Langelandstermolen {{is now called}} Abbemaar. <b>The</b> <b>part</b> after that, through the village of Thesinge is called the Thesingermaar and <b>the</b> <b>part</b> to <b>the</b> east of Thesinge is now called Geweide.|$|R
5000|$|Unless a 5th-Axis is used, a CNC {{can only}} {{approach}} <b>the</b> <b>part</b> {{from a single}} direction. One side must be machined at a time (called an operation or Op).

5|$|An {{incidental}} {{appearance of}} Auriga in Greek mythology is as the limbs of Medea's brother.

Each individual star represents a different limb.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's <b>The</b> <b>Parts</b> of Animals {{sets out}} enough {{details of his}} views on {{metabolism}} for an open flow model to be made. He believed that at each stage of the process, materials from food were transformed, with heat being released as the classical element of fire, and residual materials being excreted as urine, bile, or faeces.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle's {{account of}} {{metabolism}} sought {{to explain how}} food was processed by the body to provide both heat and the materials for the body's construction and maintenance. The metabolic system for live-bearing tetrapods described in <b>the</b> <b>Parts</b> of Animals can be modelled as an open system, a branching tree of flows of material through the body.|$|E

40|$|Chemical {{composition}} {{in different parts}} of banana pulp was determined. Ash and protein mean concentrations in <b>the</b> central <b>part</b> of <b>the</b> pulp were higher than in <b>the</b> medium <b>part,</b> and these were higher than those in <b>the</b> external <b>part.</b> <b>The</b> mean concentrations of the fiber (total and non-soluble) in <b>the</b> central <b>part</b> were higher than those found in <b>the</b> other <b>parts.</b> Ascorbic acid behaved inversely; the mean concentration significantly decreased from <b>the</b> external <b>part</b> to <b>the</b> central <b>part.</b> <b>The</b> central <b>part</b> contained <b>the</b> highest mean concentrations of the analysed minerals (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu, Zn and Mn), with statistically significant differences for Cu, Zn and Ca. A tendency to differentiate the pulp samples of banana as a function of <b>the</b> <b>part</b> considered was observed after using factor analysis. The samples from <b>the</b> central <b>part</b> were different from those from <b>the</b> external <b>part.</b> <b>The</b> samples of <b>the</b> medium <b>part</b> overlapped with those of <b>the</b> other two <b>parts...</b>|$|R
5|$|Bach first {{performed}} the cantata on 4 February 1725, {{only two days}} after the cantata , for the Purification of Mary on 2 February.

5|$|Bach led {{the first}} {{performance}} of the cantata on 26 November 1724, which was that year the last Sunday of the liturgical year. <b>The</b> <b>parts</b> show that Bach performed it at least once more but not until after 1740.|$|E
5|$|Both Bach's {{autograph}} {{score and}} <b>the</b> <b>parts</b> {{used for the}} cantata's first performance survive.

50|$|Pull-through AC demagnetizing coils: seen in {{the figure}} to the right are AC powered devices that {{generate}} a high magnetic field where <b>the</b> <b>part</b> is slowly pulled through by hand or on a conveyor.

5|$|By 1965 pirate radio had a British {{audience}} of 10 to 15 million, and by 1966 sold almost £2million worth of advertising {{a year to}} customers including the government-funded Egg Marketing Board. Radio Caroline's audience was one third {{the size of the}} Light Programme in <b>the</b> <b>parts</b> of the country where it could be received, but the Light Programme's audience did not decrease, indicating that pirate radio appealed to an audience that the BBC did not serve.|$|E
5|$|During the 1970s {{and early}} 1980s, {{replacing}} parts became an increasing problem. Components were failing due to wear and age, but the companies responsible for manufacturing <b>the</b> <b>parts</b> {{had gone out}} of business during the previous twenty years, sometimes immediately after World War II ended. The carrier's engineers often resorted to making replacements from scratch.|$|E
5|$|Flea {{phylogeny}} {{was long}} neglected, {{the discovery of}} homologies with <b>the</b> <b>parts</b> of other insects being made difficult by their extreme specialization.

The Tungidae, including the harmful chigoe flea or jigger, is sister {{to the rest of}} the Siphonaptera.|$|E
50|$|Die {{castings}} {{and permanent}} mold castings commonly contain internal porosity. This porosity is generally localized to the deepest cross-sections of <b>the</b> <b>part</b> {{and does not}} extend to the outer skin. However, if <b>the</b> <b>part</b> is also machined, the internal porosity will be exposed and <b>the</b> <b>part</b> will leak if pressurized. Machined die castings that need to hold fluids (intake manifolds, coolant connectors, transmission cases, pump housings and fluid power components) are routinely sealed for life using acrylic resins. Because the sealant is internal to <b>the</b> <b>part,</b> <b>the</b> exterior dimensions and appearance of <b>the</b> <b>part</b> are unchanged.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} automatic dimensioning of cylindrical parts represented by features.

50|$|Normally all {{rotation}} molding {{systems have}} a number of parts including molds, oven, cooling chamber and mold spindles. The molds are used to create <b>the</b> <b>part,</b> and are typically made of aluminium. The quality and finish of the product {{is directly related to the}} quality of the mold being used. The oven is used to heat <b>the</b> <b>part</b> while also rotating <b>the</b> <b>part</b> to form <b>the</b> <b>part</b> desired. <b>The</b> cooling chamber is where <b>the</b> <b>part</b> is placed until it cools, and the spindles are mounted to rotate and provide a uniform coat of plastic inside each mold.|$|R
