5|$|In Liao custom betrothal {{was seen}} as being equally serious to, if not more serious than, {{marriage}} itself, and was difficult to annul. <b>The</b> <b>groom</b> would pledge to work for three years for the bride's family, pay a bride price, and lavish the bride's family with gifts. After the three years, <b>the</b> <b>groom</b> {{would be allowed to}} take the bride back to his home, and the bride would usually cut off all ties with her family.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{returning}} immediately to Omaha, Ryan convinces Alex {{to accompany him}} to his younger sister's wedding. He learns that the reason the couple had him take photos of a cutout picture of them in various places was because they cannot afford a honeymoon. When <b>the</b> <b>groom</b> gets cold feet, Ryan's older sister talks Ryan into using his motivational skills to persuade <b>the</b> <b>groom</b> {{to go through with}} the wedding. Although this runs counter to Ryan's personal philosophy, he successfully argues that the important moments in life are rarely unshared. The wedding goes off without any further hitches.|$|E
5|$|Decades ago, Deshastha girls used to {{get married}} to <b>the</b> <b>groom</b> of their parents' choice by early teens or before.

5|$|Blacklock was {{retired to}} stud, {{where he became}} a {{successful}} stallion. He first stood at Bishop Burton in Yorkshire, with his fee initially set at 15 guineas and half a guinea for <b>the</b> <b>groom</b> (Thomas Barrow).

5|$|Wizard was a {{stallion}} at Elmsal Lodge near Ferrybridge, Yorkshire. In 1812 his {{stud fee}} was ten guineas plus half a guinea for <b>the</b> <b>groom.</b> He also stood at Emsal, {{for the same}} fee, in 1813. He only stood as a stallion for these two seasons and died on 30 June 1813 at Elmsal Lodge two days after running into a post. He broke three ribs and an iron bar attached to the post became so lodged in his backbone that it took two men to remove it. Wizard sired three winners of eleven races.|$|E
5|$|As Feodora grew older, various suitors were {{considered}} for marriage. The exiled Prince Peter Karađorđević, thirty-six years her senior, unsuccessfully requested {{her hand in}} marriage. Another potential candidate was her cousin Alfred, Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. In late 1897, Feodora became engaged to Prince Henry XXX of Reuss, and they married the following year, on 24 September 1898 in a Lutheran ceremony at Breslau. <b>The</b> <b>groom</b> was fifteen years older than his bride and a captain in a Brunswick regiment, but not wealthy or particularly high-ranked. Many in the family were shocked at the marriage, but the Dowager Empress was at least pleased that her granddaughter seemed happy with the match.|$|E

5|$|Divya is a free-spirited {{college student}} from a {{conservative}} family whose strict father, Chandramouli, {{works for the}} government. She learns that her parents are eagerly awaiting a marriage proposal for her. Unwilling to get married, and hoping that the groom's family will reject her, she deliberately arrives home late to find Chandrakumar (<b>the</b> <b>groom)</b> and his family patiently waiting for her. She talks arrogantly to Chandrakumar to make him dislike her but, undeterred, {{he says that he}} likes her and agrees to the marriage. Divya initially refuses, but when her father has a heart attack her family begs her to accept the proposal to aid his recovery. Succumbing to the pressure, Divya marries Chandrakumar.|$|E
5|$|Only {{the words}} {{exchanged}} by {{the bride and}} groom (including the speaking of the name of Eru Ilúvatar) and the consummation are required for marriage. More formally, the couple's families celebrate the marriage with a feast. The parties give back their betrothal rings and receive others worn on their index fingers. The bride’s mother gives <b>the</b> <b>groom</b> a jewel to wear (Galadriel's gift of the Elfstone to Aragorn reflects this tradition; she is grandmother to his betrothed, Arwen, Arwen's mother Celebrían having left Middle-earth for Valinor after grievous psychological injury after her capture by Orcs and liberation by her sons).|$|E
5|$|Orme was {{retired to}} stud {{at the end}} of his four-year-old season, and on 26 October 1893 he left Newmarket for Eaton Stud. His first {{covering}} was St. Mary, a daughter of Hermit, which resulted in his first foal (a chestnut colt) being born in January 1895. His stud fee for 1898 was 200 guineas, plus one guinea for <b>the</b> <b>groom.</b> Orme became a successful stallion and was champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland in 1899, with more than double the winnings of any other sire that year, largely thanks to his son Flying Fox. His son Duke of Westminster was sold for £20,050 as a two-year-old. His fee was still 200 guineas in 1902. In total Orme sired 242 winners of races worth a total of £122,568.|$|E
40|$|Reciprocation {{is thought}} to favour {{altruism}} among nonrelatives. Three types of reciprocity have been proposed: direct, indirect and generalized. All three are theoretically possible, but their role in real biological systems is unclear. We concurrently examined the occurrence of direct, indirect and generalized reciprocity during grooming exchanges in longtailed macaques, Macaca fascicularis. The occurrence of <b>the</b> <b>grooming</b> monkey A gave B predicted the latency and occurrence of <b>the</b> <b>grooming</b> B gave back to A (direct reciprocity), the latency of <b>the</b> <b>grooming</b> A received from C (indirect reciprocity), but not <b>the</b> <b>grooming</b> B gave C (generalized reciprocity). The duration of <b>the</b> <b>grooming</b> monkey A gave B predicted the latency and occurrence of <b>the</b> <b>grooming</b> B gave back to A (direct reciprocity) but not <b>the</b> <b>grooming</b> A received from C (indirect reciprocity) or <b>the</b> <b>grooming</b> B gave C generalized reciprocity). Finally, monkeys directed overall more of their grooming to those individuals that overall groomed them more (direct reciprocity), but not to those that groomed other individuals more (indirect reciprocity); nor did monkeys that received overall more grooming groom others more (generalized reciprocity). Overall, we found strong evidence for direct reciprocity, limited support for indirect reciprocity and no evidence for generalized reciprocity. Our results {{support the view that}} direct reciprocity plays {{a crucial role in the}} life of primates and suggest indirect and generalized reciprocity are rare or absent in nonhuman animals. We argue that direct reciprocity may be driven by a system of partner-specific emotional bookkeeping of past social interactions that does not require complex cognitive capacities...|$|R
50|$|The guests {{generally}} {{include the}} married-to-be couple {{and others who}} form the wedding party. The rehearsal dinner costs are traditionally incurred by <b>the</b> <b>groom's</b> parents. However, modern traditions allow for either the bride's or <b>the</b> <b>groom's</b> parents to incur these costs.|$|R
5000|$|The {{tradition}} of <b>the</b> <b>groom's</b> cake began in Britain. <b>The</b> <b>groom's</b> cake was often richer than the bride's, since stronger flavors such as chocolate, fruitcake, and alcohol were considered {{more appropriate to}} [...] "the stronger sex." [...] <b>Groom's</b> cakes during <b>the</b> Victorian era were heavy, dense fruitcakes. A characteristic recipe for <b>the</b> <b>groom's</b> fruit cake was published in “The British Baker" [...] in 1897. Eventually, flour cakes, either white or chocolate, supplanted fruit cakes as the most popular choice.|$|R
5|$|The god Vishnu and his consorts Lakshmi and Bhudevi {{should be}} {{represented}} as taking {{the place of}} Parvati's parents in the ceremony. The four-armed Vishnu should be shown in the background in between Shiva and Parvati; {{in one of his}} front hands is a golden pot from which he pours water over the hands of the couple, symbolizing giving away the bride to <b>the</b> <b>groom.</b> He holds his usual attributes, the sudarshana chakra (discus) and a shankha (conch), in his back arms. Vishnu's wives, dressed in royal finery, stand behind Parvati and hold her waist, symbolizing the handing over.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>groom</b> Shiva {{is shown}} calm and young, while Parvati is {{depicted}} as shy and emotional. Her head is tilted towards him and her eyelids joyfully lowered, while his hand (now broken) is holding hers. Their dress reflect the Hindu customs. He wears the sacred thread across his chest, she the customary jewelry. The other characters shown in the wedding carry items or are shown holding items that typically grace a Hindu wedding. Chandra (moon god), for example, holds a traditionally decorated water vessel (kalash). Brahma, the priest, is squatting {{on the floor to}} the right tending the yajna fire (agni mandapa).|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} local {{traditional}} {{stories about the}} megalithic complex. The best known tells how a wedding party was turned to stone: the party was held throughout Saturday, but a man clothed in black (the Devil in disguise) came and started to play his violin for the merrymakers after midnight, continuing into holy Sunday morning. When dawn broke, everybody had been turned to stone by the Demon: so the stone circles are the dancers, the avenues are the fiddlers and The Cove is the bride and <b>the</b> <b>groom</b> with the drunken churchman at their feet. They are still awaiting the Devil who promised to come back someday and play again for them.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>groom's</b> parents usually give {{a gift to}} {{the bride}} at this ceremony. According to an ancient Zoroastrian practice, this is done by <b>the</b> <b>groom's</b> family in order to persuade the bride to accept the proposal. The {{traditional}} gift is a ring.|$|R
5000|$|Welcoming the bride: The wedding {{procession}} of the bride's family {{stops at the}} door of <b>the</b> <b>groom's</b> home. There are ceremonies to be followed to welcome the bride and her wedding procession into <b>the</b> <b>groom's</b> home, which varies from locale to locale.|$|R
50|$|The {{marriage}} celebration was {{a four-day}} event, and the wedding ceremony {{took place on}} the first day. The bride would wear fine robes. Her kinswomen would decorate her arms and legs with red feathers, and paint her face with a paste containing small shimmering crystals. The ceremony would take place at the house of <b>the</b> <b>groom's</b> parents. A fire would be lit in the hearth, and incense would be burned as an offering to <b>the</b> gods. <b>The</b> <b>groom's</b> parents would give presents (robes and mantles) to the bride's parents. The ritual for finalizing the marriage involved the matchmaker tying <b>the</b> <b>groom's</b> cape to <b>the</b> bride's skirt, and then <b>the</b> <b>groom's</b> mother would give <b>the</b> bride and <b>groom</b> each four mouthfuls of tamales. Four days of feasting followed the ceremony.|$|R
5|$|In 1892, Cope (then 52years old) {{was granted}} expense money for field {{work from the}} Texas Geological Survey. With his {{finances}} improved, {{he was able to}} publish a massive work on the Batrachians of North America, which was the most detailed analysis and organization of the continent's frogs and amphibians ever mastered, and the 1,115-page The Crocodilians Lizards and Snakes of North America. In the 1890s, his publication rate increased to an average of 43articles a year. His final expedition to the West took place in 1894, when he prospected for dinosaurs in South Dakota and visited sites in Texas and Oklahoma. The same year, Julia was married to William H. Collins, a Haverford astronomy professor. The couple's ages—Julia was 28 and <b>the</b> <b>groom</b> 35—were past the conventions of Victorian marriage. After their European honeymoon, the couple returned to Haverford. While Annie moved to Haverford, as well, Cope did not. His official reason was the long commute and late lectures he gave in Philadelphia. In private correspondence, however, Osborn wrote that the two had essentially separated, though they remained on amiable terms.|$|E
5|$|The Lennons {{were married}} on 23 August 1962 at the Mount Pleasant Register office in Liverpool. Fellow Beatles McCartney and George Harrison were in attendance, as was their manager, Brian Epstein, who was best man; no parents were there. The wedding was farcical, because {{as soon as}} the {{ceremony}} began a workman in the backyard of the building opposite started using a jackhammer which drowned out anything the registrar, Lennon, or Powell said. When the registrar asked for <b>the</b> <b>groom</b> to step forward, Harrison stepped forward instead. With no photographs or flowers the wedding party celebrated afterwards, at Epstein's invitation, in Reece's restaurant in Clayton Square, which was the same restaurant where Lennon's parents, Alfred Lennon and Julia Lennon, had celebrated their marriage in 1938. Lennon was 21 years old, and Powell 22. The newlyweds had no honeymoon, as Lennon had to play an engagement at the Riverpark Ballroom in Chester the same night, although they did travel to the Hotel George V in Paris, for a belated honeymoon on 16 September, but were accompanied by Epstein, even though he had not been invited to join them.|$|E
5|$|The {{marriage}} {{tradition of}} the vodiondry, still practiced to this day throughout the Highlands, {{is said to have}} originated with Andriamanelo. According to oral history, after the sovereign had successfully contracted a marriage with Ramaitsoanala, sole daughter of Vazimba King Rabiby, Andriamanelo sent her a variety of gifts including vodiondrymeat from the hindquarters of a sheepwhich he believed to be the tastiest portion. The value placed on this cut of meat was reaffirmed by Ralambo who, upon discovering the edibility of zebu meat, declared the hindquarters of every slaughtered zebu throughout the kingdom to be his royal due. From the time of Andriamanelo forward, it became a marriage tradition for <b>the</b> <b>groom</b> to offer vodiondry to the bride's family. Over time the customary offerings of meat have been increasingly replaced by a symbolic piastre, sums of money and other gifts.|$|E
50|$|After the {{culmination}} of the wedding ceremony, the bride is formally taken to <b>the</b> <b>groom’s</b> house. This is called Gr̥hapravēśam of the bride. As she steps into her new home, she is welcomed by <b>the</b> <b>groom’s</b> family members, including his mother and closest relatives.|$|R
5000|$|In <b>the</b> past, <b>the</b> <b>groom's</b> {{mother might}} not {{take part in}} the {{procession}} as a sign that she would not be a threat to the future bride; she would even [...] "hide" [...] for a short period upon the bride's welcoming to <b>the</b> <b>groom's</b> home. However, this practice has long been abandoned. The number of people participating in <b>the</b> <b>groom's</b> procession varies but is usually restricted to a smaller number (20 or so) to make it easier on the bride's family, which must receive all the guests.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{bride and}} <b>groom,</b> {{in front of}} all their guests, will turn to their parents. Each parent will then give advice about {{marriage}} and family to the couple. A candle ceremony will follow, symbolizing the joining of <b>the</b> bride and <b>groom</b> and <b>the</b> joining of the two families. <b>The</b> <b>groom's</b> gift boxes filled with jewelry will be opened by <b>the</b> <b>groom's</b> mother, who will then put each piece on the bride for good fortune.|$|R
