40|$|The natural {{variation}} of strength properties within brittle materials leads to size effect, a well-known phenomenon whereby the mean {{strength of a}} material is observed to decrease as the stressed volume increases. An important implication of size effect is that size adjustment parameters must be incorporated into multi-axial constitutive and failure models used in numerical simulations to predict material response to loading. This experimental study seeks to verify and quantify the presence of depth effect under shear failure in the orthotropic principal material directions of parallel strand lumber (PSL) and laminated veneer lumber (LVL). Torsion tests have been performed on specimens of fixed length and differing cross section to get a pure shear failure, by using a Universal Test Machine.

40|$|The size {{effects in}} {{shearing}} strength were investigated {{by means of}} the <b>torsional</b> <b>test</b> in two species of Western hemlock and Red lauan. The torsional tests were carried out by using four kinds of specimens whose size were two times, four times and eight times as long as the smallest specimens respectively. The shearing strength of these specimens was measured. The results obtained are summarized as follows : 1) It was observed that there was a high negative correlation between logarithms of the shearing strentgh (log γmax) and logarithms of the volume of the specimens (log V). Preticularly, the regression line in three kinds of specimens, except the smallest one (Type I specimen), was very nearly identical. Accordingly, it was considered that the shearing fracture coincided with the weakest link theory. 2) The constants of the size effect of Western hemlock specimens were 10. 8 (shearing strength in radial section) and 10. 7 (shearing strength in tangential section). The constants of Red lauan specimens were 10. 0 (shearing strength in radial section) and 9. 26 (shearing strength in tagential section) ...|$|E
40|$|By {{incorporating}} the fabric effect and Lode’s angle dependence into the Mohr–Coulomb failure criterion, a strength criterion for cross-anisotropic sand under general stress conditions was proposed. The obtained criterion has only three material parameters {{which can be}} specified by conventional triaxial tests. The formula to calculate the friction angle under any loading direction and intermediate principal stress ratio condition was deduced, {{and the influence of}} the degree of the cross-anisotropy was quantified. The friction angles of sand in triaxial, true triaxial, and hollow cylinder <b>torsional</b> shear <b>tests</b> were obtained, and a parametric analysis was used to detect the varying characteristics. The friction angle becomes smaller when the major principal stress changes from perpendicular to parallel to the bedding plane. The loading direction and intermediate principal stress ratio are unrelated in true triaxial tests, and their influences on the friction angle can be well captured by the proposed criterion. In hollow cylinder <b>torsional</b> shear <b>tests</b> with the same internal and external pressures, the loading direction and intermediate principal stress ratio are related. This property results in a lower friction angle in the hollow cylinder <b>torsional</b> shear <b>test</b> than that in the true triaxial test under the same intermediate principal stress ratio condition. By comparing the calculated friction angle with the experimental results under various loading conditions (e. g., triaxial, true triaxial, and hollow cylinder <b>torsional</b> shear <b>test),</b> the proposed criterion was verified to be able to characterize the shear strength of cross-anisotropic sand under general stress conditions...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{experimental}} method, previously {{developed by}} the authors, has been applied {{in order to promote}} Mode III co-planar crack propagation in a bearing steel. The method consists in out-of-phase multiaxial fatigue tests, adopting a stress history typical of sub-surface RCF, onto specimens containing micro-notches that were previously subjected to Mode I pre-cracking at R= 2. Three defect sizes, expressed in terms of Murakami's √area parameter, equal to 630 μm, 315 μm and 220 μm were considered. The experimental data clearly show that the threshold conditions for out-of-phase tests is lower than in simple <b>torsional</b> <b>tests,</b> thus promoting the shear growth. This enhanced damage mechanism, which cannot be described neither in terms of fatigue criteria nor in terms of crack driving force at the crack tip, is characterised by intense plastic deformation and rubbing of the crack lips with an opening of the crack faces. In order to compare the multiaxial and <b>torsional</b> fatigue <b>test</b> results the effect of this type of opening on the friction of the crack faces will be investigated...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to analyze {{the design of the}} Formula SAE roll cage both analytical and by numerical methods. This analysis is based on the dynamic loads experienced by the roll cage under normal driving conditions, along with the torsional stiffness of the roll cage. A roll cage which is torsionally stiff enables a desirable roll moment distribution to be achieved for good handling balance. A roll cage which can absorb high energy impacts whilst controlling the rate of deceleration will increase the likelihood of drivers surviving a crash without injury. This work describes how a common model of the roll cage is developed using catia v 5 and Hyper Mesh to allow both linear and non-linear Finite Element Analysis to be performed by LS-DYNA software. The results from this analytical calculations will be used in future designs of Formula SAE roll cage, with the recommendations made that the future design incorporate stressed mild steel and carbon-fiber skins on a tubular space frame.

40|$|Mechanical {{stability}} of the stem {{is believed to be}} an important factor in successful impaction grafting in revision THA. We asked whether particle size, femoral bone deficiencies, stem design, graft composition, and impaction technique influenced the initial {{stability of}} the stem in vitro using model femora and human bone particles. Bone particles made with a reciprocating blade-type bone mill contained larger particles with a broader size distribution than those made by a rotating drum-type bone mill and had higher stiffness on compression testing. The stiffness on torsional testing decreased as the degree of proximal-medial segmental deficiencies increased. The stiffness and maximum torque in a stem with a rectangular cross section and wide anteroposterior surface were higher in torsional tests. Adding hydroxyapatite granules to the bone particles increased the torsional stability. To facilitate compact bone particles, we developed a spacer between the guidewire and modified femoral packers. This spacer facilitated compacting bone particles from the middle up to the proximal and the technique increased the amount of impacted bone particles at the middle of the stem and also improved the initial {{stability of the}} stem. Stem design and degree of deficiencies influenced stiffness in the <b>torsional</b> <b>test</b> and the addition of hydroxyapatite granules enhanced torsional stiffness...|$|E

40|$|AbstractRecently, {{composites}} made of thermosetting epoxy matrix {{reinforced by}} glass fibers {{have been widely}} used for advanced engineering and aerospace applications. This study newly proposes a developed methodology to manufacture a glass-fiber/epoxy resin composite blade of a small 1 kW wind generator system. The improved mechanical properties of the composite blade are verified in a series of systematic experiments. The study focuses on the responses of applying a torsional loading to a long straight member such as the root of the composite blade. The core aluminum shaft was wrapped in glass-fiber/epoxy to form the root of the composite blade and a composite shaft. The composite shaft is a sandwich structure combining glass-fiber/epoxy and an aluminum shaft. The composite shaft was placed in a <b>torsional</b> <b>testing</b> machine and a strain gage monitored the strain on the composite shaft. We considered the composite blade to have a circular cross section and determined both stress distribution within the member and the angle of twist. Finally, mechanical properties were obtained in <b>torsional</b> <b>testing,</b> including the relationship between applied torque and the angle of twist on the composite shaft. The torsional loading and failure locations of the blade root were measured experimentally. The experiments showed that the weakest location of the blade root is at the interface of the aluminum shaft and glass-fiber/epoxy lay-ups in the composite blade root. It is found that the quality of the aluminum shaft, the glass-fiber/epoxy layers around the shaft and the bonding at the interface between the shaft and the layers should be increased to improve the torsional strength of the composite blade. These results can provide a reference for analysts and designers of small wind turbine systems...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to develop a new minimally invasive measurement procedure. With this method implantologist could determine the local mechanical and structural properties of the cellular solids materials (e. g. bones) into which implants are placed. The currently applied methods are based on image measurement procedures (CT, Hounsfield scale etc.). The dentists, with the knowledge of the determined mechanical properties of the bone, can choose the ideal surgical parameters (flap size, diameter of drill, hole-depth, healing time, etc.) and the ideal implant type for the patients. During the development of the measuring procedure, was used bone modeling materials (“bone-like materials”) instead of bone. With these materials it is easier to do tests, than with living tissues. The bone like materials needs to have the same mechanical and structural properties as the given bone. The following bone like materials was used during the measurement: woods (Amaranth, Alnus, Ipe, Iroko, Robinia, Pyrus, Zebrano), and on the market available polyurethane solid foams (Sawbones D 1 and D 2).
