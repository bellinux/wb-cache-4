5|$|Once {{the many}} layers of candle wax, varnish, and animal glue {{were removed from the}} surface of the Sistine Chapel frescoes, they became subject to dangers <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> have been {{predicted}} by previous restorers.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of {{soldiers}} {{who died in the}} war were never found, and similarly bodies were recovered <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be identified; once again, this required new forms of memorial. The scale of the issue was once again huge: 73,000 Allied dead were never found at the Somme, for example, either because their bodies had been lost, destroyed or were unrecognisable, more than one in ten of the losses in the battle.|$|E
5|$|A print from Sheila's right {{ring finger}} {{was found on the}} right side of the butt, {{pointing}} downwards. A print from Bamber's right forefinger was on the rear end of the barrel, above the stock and pointing across the gun. He said he had used the gun to shoot rabbits. There were three other prints <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be identified.|$|E

6000|$|Then came {{his mother}} at the {{telephone}} and it became instantly certain to Benham <b>that</b> he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> play the dutiful son that evening. He answered her <b>that</b> he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> come to dinner. He had engaged himself. [...] "Where?" ...|$|R

5|$|By the mid-1950s, HIAG {{established}} {{an image that}} separated the Waffen-SS from other SS formations and shifted responsibility for crimes <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be denied to the Allgemeine-SS (security and police), the SS-Totenkopfverbände and the Einsatzgruppen. The Waffen-SS was thus successfully integrated into {{the myth of the}} clean Wehrmacht.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a French-language publication, the gazette {{was seen}} as {{independent}} of France. Its production was tolerated and even encouraged by the authorities, who often used Gazette de Leyde and other similar publications for their own ends, when wishing to publicize information <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be released via the official channels. The paper also gave voice to institutions like the Parliament of France that were finding it difficult to publish in the official French newspaper, the Gazette de France.|$|E
5|$|During his adolescence, Richard {{developed}} idiopathic scoliosis. In 2014, the osteoarchaeologist Dr Jo Appleby, of Leicester University's School of Archaeology and Ancient History, imaged {{the spinal}} column and reconstructed a model using 3D printing, {{and concluded that}} though the spinal scoliosis looked dramatic, it probably did not cause any major physical deformity <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be disguised by clothing.|$|E
60|$|In fact, Tom Gates, on sober reflection, knew <b>that</b> {{the girl}} <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be Lucy, yet he <b>could</b> <b>not</b> still the yearning {{in his heart}} {{whenever}} he saw her. His heart declared that she was Lucy, and his head realized <b>that</b> she <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be.|$|R

5|$|In 1991, Lauda Air Flight 004, {{operated}} by a Boeing 767, crashed after the left engine thrust reverser deployed in-flight for reasons <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be determined. The crash of a TAM Airlines Fokker 100 in 1996 was attributed to the deployment of the thrust reverser on No. 2 engine. The aircraft rolled {{to the right and}} crashed in a populated area of São Paulo, Brazil.|$|E
5|$|Losses for 12 July are {{difficult}} to establish for either combatant. Tank losses attributed to the German side vary, {{in part due to}} the Wehrmacht's methodology for counting and reporting equipment losses. Only equipment <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be repaired or that had to be abandoned were counted as losses, but damaged equipment that could be recovered and repaired were simply listed as such. Likewise, reliable figures for tank and personnel casualties for the Red Army in the Battle of Prokhorovka {{are difficult}} to establish.|$|E
5|$|Other theses in the historiography {{stress the}} {{significance}} of the battle. As a result of the battle of Belasitsa, the Bulgarian army suffered heavy casualties <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be restored. The ability of the central government to control the peripheral and interior provinces of the Empire was reduced and the actions of the local and provincial governors became more decisive for the outcome of the war with Byzantium. Many of them voluntarily surrendered to Basil II.|$|E

The leader of the coalition Labour Party, Diederik Samsom, also felt <b>that</b> they <b>could</b> <b>not</b> ratify the treaty in this fashion.|$|R
5|$|Sissoi Veliky {{remained}} in the Far East for another year; in December 1901 an accumulation of mechanical troubles <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be fixed in Far Eastern docks compelled the fleet commander to send {{her back to the}} Baltic. She returned to Libau via Nagasaki, Hong Kong and Suez in April 1902.|$|E
5|$|The Admiralty's {{decision}} saddled the Royal Navy {{with a pair}} {{of ships}} <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> operate with the Warriors in a tactical squadron and were inferior to the French ironclads then under construction. The naval architect Sir Nathaniel Barnaby, a future Constructor of the Navy, considered that a Defence-class ship was worth one quarter of a Warrior in terms of combat, although they cost about two-thirds as much.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Eastern Solomons was unquestionably an American victory, but it {{had little}} {{long-term}} result, apart from a further reduction in the corps of trained Japanese carrier aviators.

5|$|The {{games were}} {{the first in the}} series that did not contain all of the Pokémon from {{previous}} generations. Sugimori stated that the team tried to include all the new Pokémon as well as some from previous generations. When asked about any features <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be included due to technical restrictions, Masuda noted that he wanted each individual Pokémon to make up to three different cries depending on its mood.|$|E
5|$|The rifle, {{without the}} {{silencer}} or sights attached, {{was lying on}} her body pointing up at her neck. June's Bible {{lay on the floor}} to the right of Sheila. It was normally kept in a bedside cupboard. June's fingerprints were on it, as were others <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be identified, including one made by a child.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} ZIPRA guerrillas, {{armed with a}} Strela-2 launcher, waited in the bush beneath Flight 825's flightpath, and fired on the Hunyani about five minutes after it took off, while the {{aircraft}} {{was still in the}} climb phase of its flight. The heat-seeking missile hit the plane's starboard wing and exploded, causing the inner engine to also explode. A fuel tank and hydraulic lines ruptured, creating a fire <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be put out. The second starboard engine failed almost immediately, leaving Hood with only his two port engines. Heaving wildly, the Hunyani began to descend rapidly.|$|E

5|$|A {{memorial}} at St Magnus' Cathedral {{in nearby}} Kirkwall displays a plaque dedicated {{to those who}} lost their lives, beneath which a book of remembrance lists their names. This list of names was not released by the Government until 40 years after the sinking. Each week a page {{of the book is}} turned. The ship's bell was recovered in the 1970s and, after being restored, was added to the memorial in St Magnus'. A number of bodies, including some <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be identified, were interred at the naval cemetery in Lyness.|$|E
5|$|After graduation, Kerst {{worked at}} General Electric Company for a year, {{working on the}} {{development}} of x-ray tubes and machines. He found this frustrating, as x-ray research required high energies <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be produced at the time. In 1938 he accepted an offer of an instructorship at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, where the head of the physics department, F. Wheeler Loomis encouraged Kerst in his efforts to create a better particle accelerator. The result of these efforts was the betatron. When it became operational on July 15, 1940, Kerst became the first person to accelerate electrons using electromagnetic induction, reaching energies of 2.3 MeV.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, UBS {{announced}} the planned cut of 8,700 jobs and had implemented a new compensation plan. Under the plan, {{no more than}} one-third of any cash bonus would be paid out in the year it is earned with the rest to be held in reserve and stock-based incentives that would vest after three years; top executives would have to hold 75% of any vested shares. Additionally, the bank's chairman, Peter Kurer, would no longer receive any extra variable compensation, only a cash salary and a fixed allotment of shares <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>not</b> be sold for four years. In April 2009, UBS announced that it agreed to sell its Brazilian financial services business, UBS Pactual, for approximately US$2.5billion to BTG Investments. UBS rejected proposals to break apart the bank and divest its investment banking division.|$|E
