25|$|In 1995, {{the founders}} of free dailies in Aspen and Vail teamed up to start <b>the</b> <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto</b> Daily News in Palo Alto, California, a city about 20 miles south of San Francisco. <b>The</b> <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto</b> paper was {{profitable}} within nine months of its launch and usually carries more than 100 retail (nonclassified) ads per day.|$|E
25|$|These {{findings}} have been put into practice through a peer support program for veterans in the Sonora, Stockton, and Modesto VA outpatient clinics. The clinics are part of <b>the</b> <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto</b> Veterans Affairs Healthcare System that extend to more rural parts of northern California. The program is funded through grants in support of new treatment approaches to serve veterans in rural, traditionally underserved areas. Leadership for the program comes from the Menlo Park division of <b>the</b> <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto</b> VA system.|$|E

25|$|After passing under Highway 101, Adobe Creek enters <b>the</b> <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto</b> Flood Basin {{just west}} of a levee {{at the end of}} San Antonio Road. This levee {{separates}} Charleston Slough on the east from Mayfield Slough on the west and is also the eastern border of <b>the</b> <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto</b> Baylands. The Flood Basin is maintained a couple feet below sea level in order to absorb floodwaters from Adobe Creek and Matadero Creek. By lowering the basin, what was once tidal saltwater marsh is now predominantly freshwater marsh. Adobe Creek is joined by Matadero Creek {{at the north end of}} Mayfield Slough, where it historically joined with San Francisquito Creek before the latter was diverted north. Mayfield Slough has a tidal gate through which fresh water passes to San Francisco Bay, and some salt water is permitted to return to Mayfield Slough when the tides are higher.|$|E

25|$|In 1995, {{the same}} year <b>the</b> <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto</b> Daily News began, Metro started {{what may be the}} first free daily {{newspaper}} distributed through public transport in Stockholm, Sweden. Later, Metro launched free papers in many European and other countries. In the UK, the Daily Mail and General Trust group launched its own edition of Metro (see Metro (Associated Metro Limited)) in London in 1999, effectively beating Metro International to the London market. The paper now has 13 editions across the country and a combined readership of 1.7 million.|$|E

Price and Pavelich have avoided putting {{the content of their}} newspapers online because that would reduce readership of their printed newspapers, and therefore reduce the effectiveness of their print advertising. While ads can be placed on Web pages, they are not as effective for clients as print advertising. They have said that if they ever find an example of a newspaper that is making a profit on its website, they would copy that approach.|$|E
25|$|Arnautoff was, {{along with}} fellow activist Bernard Zakheim, {{perhaps the most}} {{prolific}} muralist in San Francisco in the 1930s. He completed not only the murals at <b>the</b> <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto</b> Clinic and Coit Tower, but also at the Presidio chapel, George Washington High School (which depicted slavery and a dead Native American), and the California School of Fine Arts library. All of these murals were focused on humanist themes, including concerns about class, labor, and power. He also painted five post offices (College Station, TX; Linden, TX; Pacific Grove, CA; Richmond, CA; and South San Francisco, CA), and held solo exhibitions throughout the 1930s.|$|E

25|$|In 1931 {{the family}} {{returned}} to San Francisco. Arnautoff's first significant work after returning was a mural {{on the wall}} of his studio, which he opened to the public. Shortly afterward, he completed his first mural commission, for <b>the</b> <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto</b> Medical Clinic in Palo Alto (where he had been a patient) in August of 1932. The unveiling of this mural caused a traffic jam and some controversy, in part because the mural showed a doctor examining a female patient whose bare breasts were at eye-level. Like his other works in the Bay Area, the murals were frescoes.|$|E
25|$|The Gulf Coastal Plains {{extends from}} the Gulf of Mexico inland to the Balcones Fault and the Eastern Cross Timbers. This large area, {{including}} the Texas barrier islands, stretches from the cities of Paris to San Antonio to Del Rio but shows a large variety in vegetation. With about 20 to over 58inches (508–1,480mm) annual rainfall, this is a nearly level, drained plain dissected by streams and rivers flowing into estuaries and marshes. Windblown sands and dunes, grasslands, oak mottes and salt marshes make up the seaward areas. National Parks include Big Thicket National Preserve, Padre Island National Seashore and <b>the</b> <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto</b> Battlefield National Historic Site.|$|E
25|$|Price and Pavelich have {{an entirely}} {{different}} view of the Internet than other free daily publishers. While most free daily publishers post their stories and/or PDF pages online, the creators of <b>the</b> <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto</b> Daily News model have refused to put their content online. They argue that posting their stories online will reduce demand for their printed newspapers, which will also reduce {{the effectiveness of their}} print ads. They note that readers have dropped their subscriptions to paid newspapers because they can get the same stories online, yet those newspapers make far less money on their websites than they do on their print editions.|$|E

25|$|On February 20, 1961, Garcia {{got into}} a car with Paul Speegle, a sixteen-year-old artist and {{acquaintance}} of Garcia; Lee Adams, the house manager of the Chateau and driver of the car; and Alan Trist, a companion of theirs. After speeding past <b>the</b> <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto</b> Veterans Hospital, the car encountered a curve and, traveling around ninety miles per hour, collided with the guard rail, sending the car rolling turbulently. Garcia was hurled through the windshield of the car into a nearby field with such force he was literally thrown out of his shoes and would later be unable to recall the ejection. Lee Adams, the driver, and Alan Trist, who was seated in the back, were thrown from the car as well, suffering from abdominal injuries and a spine fracture, respectively. Garcia escaped with a broken collarbone, while Speegle, still in the car, was fatally injured.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Palo</b> <b>Alto</b> Flood Basin was {{constructed}} in 1956 {{in order to prevent}} a repeat of the floods of 1955, when a high tide prevented the escape of heavy runoff from Matadero, Adobe, and Barron Creeks into the San Francisco Bay. The trapped runoff waters overflowed upstream creek banks and caused severe flooding in Palo Alto. In order to control the flow of water into the flood basin, a tidegate was placed at the confluence of Adobe Creek, Matadero Creek, and the San Francisco Bay, so that the flood basin could be maintained at approximately 2 feet below sea level, creating room to absorb floodwaters. The tidegate consists of several weirs and one operator-controlled sluice gate that enables tidal flows into the basin in order to improve water quality and for mosquito control. Three agencies oversee the tidegates: Santa Clara Valley Water District, City of Palo Alto, and Santa Clara County Vector Control. Because the trash grate and weirs separate the mouth of the flood basin from the San Francisco Bay estuary, large fish cannot swim freely between the Bay and the basin, unless the sluice gate is open. In addition, the tidegates are set to reduce tidal inflows into the basin, so that the basin is mostly freshwater. After a rainstorm the tidegate is kept closed, however this is precisely when steelhead trout in-migrations should occur. In 2002 a small opening was cut in the trash grate on the tidal gate to permit fish passage but local fisherman in the Flood Basin no longer report catching steelhead trout in recent years.|$|E
