5|$|A {{study from}} 2005 {{concluded}} <b>that</b> <b>heat</b> waves significantly increased in frequency, persistence and spatial {{coverage in the}} decade 1991-2000, {{when compared to the}} period between 1971–80 and 1981-90. A severe heat wave in Orissa in 1998 resulted in nearly 1300 deaths. Based on observations, heat wave related mortality has increased in India prior to 2005. The 2015 Indian heat wave killed more than 2,500 people.|$|E
5|$|Canada-born Auburn University alumnus Alana Dillette was {{the only}} swimmer to {{participate}} in the women's 100meters backstroke while representing the Bahamas at the Beijing Olympics. Dillette participated in the preliminary rounds of her event on 10 August, when she swam in the third heat versus swimmers that included Columbia's Carolina Colorado and Israel's Anna Gostomelsky, who ranked, respectively, first and second in <b>that</b> <b>heat.</b> Dillette ranked fourth in the heat with a time of 1:02.56 behind Sweden's Sarah Sjöström by 0.24seconds, and ahead of Hong Kong's Hiu Wai Sherry Tsai by 0.12seconds. Out of the total of 49 swimmers that took part in the preliminary rounds, Dillette ranked 32nd. She did not advance to semifinals later that day.|$|E
5|$|Djibouti had two athletes {{qualify for}} the 1500 m run with a {{qualification}} time better than 3:36.20. Ayanleh Souleiman {{finished third in the}} first heat with a time 3:39.25, which qualified him for the semifinals. He finished in 2nd place in <b>that</b> <b>heat</b> with a time of 3:39.46, which qualified him for the finals. In the finals, Souleiman finished in fourth place with a time of 3:50.29. He was 0.05 seconds away from the bronze medal, and 0.29 seconds away from the gold. The other Djiboutian that qualified for the 1500 m run, Abdi Waiss Mouhyadin, did not finish the race. On the final lap, he tripped and required help to leave the track. Waiss was also the flagbearer for Djibouti in the opening ceremony.|$|E

30|$|Lead tellurides, namely n-type PbTe doped with 0.5 mass% PbI 2 and p-type Pb 0.5 Sn 0.5 Te, {{are widely}} used for {{practical}} thermoelectric generation applications[1, 2]. However, it has recently been reported <b>that</b> <b>heating</b> over 400 °C causes the decomposition and sublimation of Te from lead tellurides[3].

5|$|Europa has the smoothest {{surface of}} any known solid {{object in the}} Solar System. The {{apparent}} youth and smoothness of the surface {{have led to the}} hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it, which could conceivably harbor extraterrestrial life. The predominant model suggests <b>that</b> <b>heat</b> from tidal flexing causes the ocean to remain liquid and drives ice movement similar to plate tectonics, absorbing chemicals from the surface into the ocean below. Sea salt from a subsurface ocean may be coating some geological features on Europa, suggesting that the ocean is interacting with the seafloor. This may be important in determining if Europa could be habitable. In addition, the Hubble Space Telescope detected water vapor plumes similar to those observed on Saturn's moon Enceladus, which are thought to be caused by erupting cryogeysers.|$|E
5|$|In August 1922, Tosa {{was moved}} to Kure, still incomplete. Fifty {{thousand}} people turned out to watch as the battleship was towed out of the harbor by five tugboats. The barbettes for the 406mm (16inch) guns were in place, but no turrets or weapons had been mounted, so {{the holes in the}} main deck were covered with a mesh-like material. Her hull was finished, and a superstructure deck, bridge deck and conning tower had been fitted, along with a light signal mast directly aft of the second barbette. The conning tower had to be outfitted as a bridge, as there was no other suitable location; compared with those of similar ships, it was much smaller, as it only contained two levels and bridge wings. An exhaust pipe resembling an extremely small funnel was fitted so <b>that</b> <b>heat</b> could be supplied within the ship.|$|E
5|$|Ants of this genus {{prefer to}} inhabit grasslands, forests, heath, urban areas and {{woodland}}. Nests {{are found in}} Callitris forest, dry marri forest, Eucalyptus woodland and forests, mallee scrub, in paddocks, riparian woodland, and wet and dry sclerophyll forests. They also live in dry sandplains, and coastal plain. When a queen establishes a new colony, the nest is at first quite simple structurally. The nest gradually expands as the colony grows larger. Nests {{can be found in}} debris, decaying tree stumps, rotten logs, rocks, sand, and soil, and under stones. While most species nest underground, M. mjobergi is an arboreal nesting species found on epiphytic ferns of the genus Platycerium. Two types of nests have been described for this genus: a simple nest with a noticeable shaft inside, and a complex structure surrounded by a mound. Some species construct dome-shaped mounds containing a single entrance, but some nests have numerous holes that are constantly used and can extend several metres underground. Sometimes, these mounds can be 0.5 m (20in) high. Workers decorate these nests with a variety of items, including charcoal, leaves, plant fragments, pebbles, and twigs. Some ants use the warmth by decorating their nests with dry materials <b>that</b> <b>heat</b> quickly, providing the nest with solar energy traps.|$|E
