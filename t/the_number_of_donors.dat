40|$|Background. The {{disparity}} between patients awaiting transplantation and available organs has widened, and resultant organ shortage became a world crisis. The transplantation community has made considerable progress in national organ donation systemin Korea, and significant growth in <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> deceased <b>donors</b> has been witnessed. Methods. After {{introduction of the}} Organ Transplant Act, which was enacted in 2000, transparency was established in organ allocation system in Korea. However, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> deceased <b>donor</b> dwindled significantly from 162 in 1999 to 36 in 2002. To improve deceased donation, several strategies were pursued, and finally new national organ donation system was established through the amendment of the Organ Transplant Act. Results. Organ incentive system, which was introduced in 2003, failed to increase <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> deceased <b>donors</b> (68 in 2003, 86 in 2004, and 91 in 2005). Monetary incentive to the bereaved family was introduced in 2006 and slightly increased <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> deceased <b>donor</b> (141 in 2006). However, this effect was not long-lasting (148 in 2007). After enforcement of the new Organ Transplant Act, which included nationwide independent organ procurement organization and mandatory report of potential brain death, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> deceased <b>donors</b> significantly increased, reaching 368 in 2011. The growth continued and <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> deceased <b>donors</b> reached 409 (8. 03 pmp) in 2012. Conclusion. There {{has been a significant}} growth in <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> deceased <b>donors</b> in Korea since the appropriate deceased organ donation system was launched. A comprehensive national program is required to improve deceased donation and achieve self-sufficiency. This work was made by unceasing efforts of all members of Korean Society for Transplantation and consistent support from Ministry of Health and Welfare...|$|R

5000|$|Moreover, the {{executive}} director of CCIR, Bilbo Poynter, has argued {{that a large number of}} donors could also increase competition and therefore the need for credibility and transparency for both donors and the investigative centers.

5000|$|In Niven's universe, the {{technology}} to indefinitely sustain any human organ outside of the body {{was developed in the}} early 21st century, greatly simplifying organ transplants.

In light of this, all forms of burial save complete harvesting of organs for transplant became illegal.

50|$|ACLT(African Caribbean Leukaemia Trust) was co-founded by Beverley De-Gale OBE and Orin Lewis OBE in 1996, {{after they}} {{received}} {{the news that}} their 6-year-old son, Daniel De-Gale, {{had been diagnosed with}} leukaemia. Daniel’s only hope of survival was to receive a stem cell transplant; stem cells have racially specific characteristics therefore Daniel’s donor could only be found from the black or mixed race population, of which only 550 were registered- this translated into a 1 in 250,000 chance of finding a matching donor for Daniel. When confronted by these facts and figures, it became apparent to both Beverley and Orin that there was a need for an organisation to galvanise awareness and increase <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>donors.</b> Orin and Beverley channelled their anxiety of discovering their son had a form of cancer into a goal of creating a better future for people suffering with Leukaemia and other blood-related disorders.

Thus, it has been analysed the inﬂuence that the hydrogen bond donor strength and the co-operative eﬀect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> increasing <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> molecules have on {{the shape of the}} potential energy surfaces versus the N·· ·H distances, rN–H. To rationalize the nature of the interactions, the Bader theory has been applied and the characteristics of the bond critical points analysed. The results show that two diﬀerent hydrogen bond complexes can be formed depending on the <b>donor</b> capabilities or <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>donor</b> molecules included in the calculations. The topological parameters from the Bader theory are used to justify the statement that the analysed interactions can be classiﬁed as weak or partially covalent hydrogen bond interactions, respectively.
