5|$|Doxorubicin {{interacts with}} DNA by {{intercalation}} and inhibition of macromolecular biosynthesis. This inhibits <b>the</b> <b>progression</b> of topoisomerase II, an enzyme which relaxes supercoils in DNA for transcription. Doxorubicin stabilizes the topoisomerase II complex {{after it has}} broken the DNA chain for replication, preventing the DNA double helix from being resealed and thereby stopping the process of replication. It may also increase quinone type free radical production, hence contributing to its cytotoxicity.|$|E

40|$|PurposeThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether practicing athletic trainers (ATs) were using <b>the</b> stepwise <b>progression</b> to make return-to-play (RTP) decisions after concussion and to determine what factors influenced their decision to use <b>the</b> stepwise <b>progression.</b> MethodsA total of 166 ATs (response rate[*]=[*] 16. 6 %) completed a 21 -item questionnaire that evaluated participant demographics, methods of concussion management, and RTP decision-making using <b>the</b> stepwise <b>progression.</b> Descriptive statistics and a logistic regression were completed to analyze data. The results were as follows: demographic factors such as education level (p[*]=[*] 0. 05) and number of concussions treated (p[*]=[*] 0. 05) predicted use of <b>the</b> stepwise <b>progression,</b> whereas sex (p[*]=[*] 0. 17), employment setting (p[*]=[*] 0. 17), state law (p[*]=[*] 0. 86), and years practicing (p[*]=[*] 0. 17) did not predict whether ATs were following <b>the</b> stepwise <b>progression.</b> ConclusionThe majority of the ATs from this study are employing <b>the</b> stepwise <b>progression</b> to safely return athletes to play after sustaining a concussion. This demonstrates that ATs are providing a standard of care for concussed athletes across various athletic training settings; however, having a graduate degree and treating more concussions per year are predictors of whether an AT follows all steps of <b>the</b> stepwise <b>progression...</b>|$|R

If <b>the</b> logical <b>progression</b> of a prop changes during shooting, the props breakdown is revised to reflect the change.|$|R

5|$|The song is {{constructed}} in a verse-chorus form, with a bridge before the third chorus, and its instrumentation {{comes from a}} guitar, brass and string instruments. It starts with an instrumental introduction, with a chord progression of A–Faug–Dmaj7–G7 that is also used during {{the first part of}} the verses and the chorus. Brown and Bunton sing the first lines of the first verse; <b>the</b> <b>progression</b> then changes to Bm7–E–Dmaj7–C♯7 during the last part of the verse, which is sung by Chisholm. After the chorus, the same pattern occurs leading to the second chorus, with Halliwell, Beckham, and Chisholm singing the second verse. <b>The</b> <b>progression</b> changes to Bm7–C♯m7–Gmaj9–F♯7(♯9) as Chisholm sings the bridge, while the rest of the group adds the high harmony. The group sing the chorus twice, and repeats the ad-lib as the song fades out. The album version, which is forty seconds longer than the radio edit, features an instrumental section at the end of the track.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{concept in}} Hippocratic medicine {{was that of}} a crisis, a point in <b>the</b> <b>progression</b> of disease at which either the illness would begin to triumph and the patient would succumb to death, or the opposite would occur and natural processes would make the patient recover. After a crisis, a relapse might follow, and then another deciding crisis. According to this doctrine, crises tend to occur on critical days, which were supposed to be a fixed time after the contraction of a disease. If a crisis occurred on a day far from a critical day, a relapse might be expected. Galen believed that this idea originated with Hippocrates, though it is possible that it predated him.|$|E

5|$|Cohesion between {{sentences}} is achieved {{through the use}} of deictic pronouns as anaphora (e.g. that is exactly what I mean where that refers to some fact known to both interlocutors, or then used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event). Discourse markers such as oh, so or well, also signal <b>the</b> <b>progression</b> of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion. Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, no way is that true! (the idiomatic marker no way! expressing disbelief), or boy! I'm hungry (the marker boy expressing emphasis). While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English, they are also used in written and formal registers.|$|E
5|$|Even though Lana {{eventually}} marries Lex {{in season}} six, Al Gough argues that Lana still loved Clark and Clark still loved her. The only reason Lana was with Lex was because Clark forced {{her in that}} direction and she ended up getting in over her head. By contrast, writer Caroline Dries feels that Lana did love Lex, and {{that she did not}} make any hasty decisions when she agreed to marry him. Dries believes that <b>the</b> <b>progression</b> of the show demonstrates that Lex earned Lana's love. To answer viewers that hated to see Lana marry Lex, Dries contends that as viewers we are seeing all of Lex, including how evil he truly is, while Lana only sees the portion of Lex that appears good.|$|E
