5|$|<b>The</b> <b>contact</b> angle (θ), {{as seen in}} Figure 1, is {{the angle}} at which the liquid–vapor {{interface}} meets the solid-liquid interface. <b>The</b> <b>contact</b> angle {{is determined by the}} result between adhesive and cohesive forces. As the tendency of a drop to spread out over a flat, solid surface increases, <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> angle decreases. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> angle provides an inverse measure of wettability.|$|E
5|$|Another torque is {{produced}} by the finite width of <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> patch and the lean of the tire in a turn. The portion of <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> patch towards {{the outside of the}} turn is actually moving rearward, with respect to the wheel's hub, faster than the rest of <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> patch, because of its greater radius from the hub. By the same reasoning, the inner portion is moving rearward more slowly. So the outer and inner portions of <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> patch slip on the pavement in opposite directions, generating a torque that tends to turn the front wheel {{in the direction of the}} turn, and therefore tends to decrease the turn radius.|$|E

5000|$|A {{contactor}} {{has three}} components. <b>The</b> <b>contacts</b> are <b>the</b> current carrying {{part of the}} contactor. This includes power contacts, auxiliary contacts, and <b>contact</b> springs. <b>The</b> electromagnet (or [...] "coil") provides the driving force to close <b>the</b> <b>contacts.</b> <b>The</b> enclosure is a frame housing <b>the</b> <b>contacts</b> and <b>the</b> electromagnet. Enclosures are made of insulating materials such as Bakelite, Nylon 6, and thermosetting plastics to protect and insulate <b>the</b> <b>contacts</b> and to provide some measure of protection against personnel touching <b>the</b> <b>contacts.</b> Open-frame contactors may have a further enclosure to protect against dust, oil, explosion hazards and weather.|$|R
40|$|<b>Contacts</b> from <b>the</b> {{functional}} {{switch assembly}} {{have been examined}} {{for a series of}} MC 2969 stronglinks varying from 9 to 14 years of age. Wear tracks are apparent on <b>the</b> <b>contacts</b> as a result of oxide removal by wiping action as the switch is exercised. Typical contaminants observed on <b>the</b> <b>contacts</b> include C, O, S, Cl, F and Si, all of which vary with position on <b>the</b> <b>contacts.</b> All of <b>the</b> <b>contacts</b> show segregation of Ag into the near-surface region. Measurement of <b>the</b> local <b>contact</b> resistance on <b>the</b> ends of <b>the</b> <b>contacts</b> provide resistance values that are reasonable for this material, but with variation among contacts as a result of changes in the local surface chemistry...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>contacting</b> stroke is {{effected}} in <b>the</b> needle adapter. <b>Contacting</b> {{forces of}} 0.4 N to 1.5 N {{depending on the}} spring probe are exerted on <b>the</b> <b>contacting</b> point by <b>the</b> spring excursion of approximately 2.5 mm.|$|R
5|$|Such {{motion of}} a phase boundary, {{involving}} advancing and receding contact angles, {{is known as}} dynamic wetting. When a contact line advances, covering more of the surface with liquid, <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> angle is increased and generally {{is related to the}} velocity of <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> line. If the velocity of a contact line is increased without bound, <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> angle increases, and as it approaches 180°, the gas phase will become entrained in a thin layer between the liquid and solid. This is a kinetic nonequilibrium effect which results from <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> line moving at such a high speed that complete wetting cannot occur.|$|E
5|$|Also, because real tires have {{a finite}} contact patch {{with the road}} surface that can {{generate}} a scrub torque, and when in a turn, can experience some side slipping as they roll, they can generate torques about an axis normal to the plane of <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> patch.|$|E
5|$|Another {{special case}} is where <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> angle is exactly 180°. Water with {{specially}} prepared Teflon approaches this. Contact angle of 180° {{occurs when the}} liquid–solid surface tension is exactly equal to the liquid–air surface tension.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>contacts</b> {{were exposed}} to dust and dirt, more than <b>the</b> <b>contacts</b> of a TRRS socket are. This, {{combined}} with {{the small size of}} <b>the</b> <b>contacts,</b> prevented connections in some cases. Also, the plug's 'hook' tended to lose its hooking capability, making it even easier to accidentally lose connection. The data cables had to be original in most cases.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} prevent this damage, the {{solution}} must be stabilized before <b>the</b> <b>contacts</b> are placed into the individual's eyes. To stabilize <b>the</b> solution, <b>the</b> <b>contacts</b> are placed into a special container with a platinum coated disk. In solution, it gets rid of the hydrogen peroxide and produces small bubbles that help to clean <b>the</b> <b>contacts.</b> After a couple of hours, the hydrogen peroxide is stabilized and what is left is a saline solution. At this point, {{it is safe to}} use <b>the</b> <b>contacts.</b> After extended use, the platinum coated disk must be replaced.|$|R
50|$|When someone falls ill, adults {{they might}} have {{infected}} are vaccinated. Depending on how easily <b>the</b> disease spreads, <b>contacts</b> {{who could have been}} infected might include family, neighbours, and friends. Several layers of <b>contacts</b> (<b>the</b> <b>contacts,</b> <b>the</b> contacts' <b>contacts,</b> <b>the</b> <b>contact's</b> contacts' contacts, etc.) may be vaccinated. Some vaccines will protect even if they are given just after infection, but even if the vaccine does not, ring vaccination can prevent the virus from being transmitted again, to <b>the</b> contacts' <b>contacts.</b>|$|R

5|$|One torque {{generated}} by a tire, called the self aligning torque, is caused by asymmetries in the side-slip {{along the length of}} <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> patch. The resultant force of this side-slip occurs behind the geometric center of <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> patch, a distance described as the pneumatic trail, and so creates a torque on the tire. Since the direction of the side-slip is towards the outside of the turn, the force on the tire is towards the center of the turn. Therefore, this torque tends to turn the front wheel {{in the direction of the}} side-slip, away from the direction of the turn, and therefore tends to increase the radius of the turn.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Transient regime {{relaxation}} in nanostructures {{is governed}} by the two-way information exchange be-tween the active region and <b>the</b> <b>contacts.</b> In this paper, we introduce a second order quantum master equation for the active region’s many-body reduced density matrix, which includes the information exchange between the active region and <b>the</b> <b>contacts,</b> while eliminating <b>the</b> <b>contacts</b> explicitly from <b>the</b> simulation. For {{the case of a}} resonant-tunneling diode, the master equation is solved numerically. Proper injection from/into <b>the</b> <b>contacts</b> is obtained, and natural oscillations of the current and the number of particles in the well are observed, with a frequency in the mid-terahertz regime...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>contacts</b> of {{a switch}} are under their {{greatest}} stress while opening or closing. As the switch is closed, the resistance between <b>the</b> <b>contacts</b> changes from almost infinite to almost zero. At infinite resistance, no current flows and no power is dissipated. At zero resistance, {{there is no}} voltage drop and no power is dissipated. However, when <b>the</b> <b>contacts</b> change state, there is a brief instant of partial contact when resistance is neither zero nor infinite, and electrical power is converted into heat. If the heating is excessive, <b>the</b> <b>contacts</b> may be damaged, or may even weld themselves closed.|$|R

40|$|A {{magnetic}} {{relay system}} is implemented {{to act as}} a relay driven by a magnetic flux yet capable of production through micromachining.

5|$|There {{are only}} two exposed {{contacts}} of Siletzia with the older (pre-Cenozoic) North American basement.

Everywhere else <b>the</b> <b>contact</b> between Siletzia {{and the rest of the}} continent is concealed under younger deposits, especially the Cascade Range volcanics. <b>The</b> <b>contact</b> around the Olympic Mountains is actually the bottom contact with the underlying oceanic sediments, tilted up by the uplift of the Olympics and exposed by erosion of about 10 to 12km of overlying deposits.|$|E
40|$|We present {{theoretical}} {{results on}} electron dynamics inside nanometric systems, where the coherence {{of the electron}} ensemble is maintained {{in a very short}} region. <b>The</b> <b>contacts</b> are supposed to spoil such a coherence, therefore the interference processes between the carrier wavefunction and the internal potential profile can be affected by the proximity of <b>the</b> <b>contacts.</b> <b>The</b> problem has been analysed by using the Wigner-function formalism.

40|$|The vacuum {{interrupter}} is extensively {{employed in the}} medium voltage switchgear for the interruption of the short-circuit current.

5|$|As {{a result}} of {{relatively}} intense language contact, Central Atlas Tamazight has a large stratum of Arabic loans.

5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>Contact</b> period, it {{is known}} that certain {{military}} positions were held by members of the aristocracy, and were passed on by patrilineal succession. It is likely that the specialized knowledge inherent in the particular military role was taught to the successor, including strategy, ritual, and war dances. Maya armies of <b>the</b> <b>Contact</b> period were highly disciplined, and warriors participated in regular training exercises and drills; every able-bodied adult male was available for military service. Maya states did not maintain standing armies; warriors were mustered by local officials who reported back to appointed warleaders. There were also units of full-time mercenaries who followed permanent leaders. Most warriors were not full-time, however, and were primarily farmers; the needs of their crops usually came before warfare. Maya warfare was not so much aimed at destruction of the enemy as the seizure of captives and plunder.|$|E
