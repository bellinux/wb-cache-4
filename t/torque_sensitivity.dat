5000|$|The 2000 Cobra R {{had several}} {{distinguishing}} visual and performance features that set it {{apart from the}} standard 1999 or 2001 Cobra. The [...] "power dome" [...] hood, for instance, was taller than the standard Cobra hood, and it had gills that could be cut out to help reduce engine compartment temperatures. The rear spoiler was tall and wide, providing much needed downforce at track speeds. The Cobra R was equipped with Eibach springs that lowered the car 1.5 inches in front and 1.0 inch out back. This model also used Bilstein shocks and struts, Brembo 4-piston front calipers acting on 13-inch rotors cooled by large ducts, along with a race-style fuel cell that was clearly protruding under the Mustang V6-style rear bumper. The front fascia was adorned with a low-riding, removable splitter. The wheels were also uniquely styled, silver-painted, five-spoke, 18 in x 9.5 in alloys wrapped in aggressive BF Goodrich G-Force KD tires. The hand-built SVT engine employed special DOHC cylinder heads, a [...] "trumpet-style" [...] intake manifold, aggressive camshafts, short tube headers connected to Cobra catalysts, a Bassani X-pipe, and a unique Borla dual side-exiting exhaust system, which was necessitated by the large fuel cell. This model also featured 3.55 gears, a Gerodisc hydro-mechanical differential with speed and <b>torque</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> and a Tremec T-56 6-speed manual transmission that was closely geared for drag racing or road course usage. Despite these close ratios, the 2000 Cobra R also enjoyed a 177 mph (282 km/h) top speed.|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{transduction}} {{of torque}} has been key to probing {{a number of}} physical phenomena, such as gravity, the angular momentum of light, the Casimir effect, magnetism, and quantum oscillations. Following similar trends as mass and force sensing, mechanical <b>torque</b> <b>sensitivity</b> can be dramatically improved by scaling down the physical dimensions, and therefore moment of inertia, of a torsional spring. Yet now, through precision nanofabrication and sub-wavelength cavity optomechanics, we have {{reached a point where}} geometric optimization can only provide marginal improvements to <b>torque</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> Instead, nanoscale optomechanical measurements of torque are overwhelmingly hindered by thermal noise. Here we present cryogenic measurements of a cavity-optomechanical torsional resonator cooled in a dilution refrigerator to a temperature of 25 mK, corresponding to an average phonon occupation of = 35, that demonstrate a record-breaking <b>torque</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of 2. 9 yNm/Hz^{ 1 / 2 }. This a 270 -fold improvement over previous optomechanical torque sensors and just over an order of magnitude from its standard quantum limit. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mesoscopic test samples, such as micron-scale superconducting disks, can be integrated with our cryogenic optomechanical torque sensing platform, in contrast to other cryogenic optomechanical devices, opening the door for mechanical torque spectroscopy of intrinsically quantum systems.

Nanoscale torsion rods, ~ 1 μm {{long and}} 50 – 100 nm in diameter, provide both extraordinary thermal isolation and excellent angular displacement and <b>torque</b> <b>sensitivities,</b> of order ~ 10 ^(– 7) rad·Hz^(– 1 / 2) and 10 ^(– 22) (N·m) Hz^(– 1 / 2), respectively. Furthermore, these nanorods act as linear torsional springs, yielding a maximum angular displacement of 3. 6 ° and a dynamic range of over 100 dB; this exceeds {{the performance of}} flexural modes {{by as much as}} 5 orders of magnitude. These attributes lead to superior noise performance for torsional-mode sensing. We demonstrate the operational principles of torsional-mode IR detection, attaining an uncooled noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD) of 390 mK.

40|$|Many {{theories}} {{associated with}} quantum gravity, such as string theory, predict violations of inverse square law (ISL) of gravity at sub millimetre distances. To search for such experimental signatures {{we developed a}} magnetically levitated cryogenic torsion balance, the SSTB, {{and a set of}} masses with modulated density across their surfaces. The lateral force has to be measured as one mass is moved {{in front of the other}} with a micropositioner without any electrostatic shield between them. The expected Newtonian and electromagnetic forces have been studied to optimise the design of the masses. The <b>torque</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of the SSTB has been modelled and its performances at 4. 2 K discussed. A <b>torque</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of 2 × 10 ^− 10 Nm/√(Hz) at 30 mHz has been measured, most probably due to coupling with ground tilt. Two tests with prototypes of the masses has been performed. During the first test a torque due to electrostatic and magnetic forces of 8. 4 × 10 ^− 11 ± 1. 5 × 10 ^− 11 Nm has been measured at a mass spacing of 42 ± 14 μm at the spatial periodicity of the density modulation.

40|$|To keep balance, {{information}} from different sensory systems is integrated to generate corrective torques. Current {{literature suggests that}} this information is combined according to the sensory reweighting hypothesis, i. e., more reliable information is weighted more strongly than less reliable information. In this approach, no distinction has been made between the contributions of both legs. In this study, we investigated how proprioceptive {{information from}} both legs is combined to maintain upright stance. Healthy subjects maintained balance with eyes closed while proprioceptive information of each leg was perturbed independently by continuous rotations of the support surfaces (SS) and the human body by platform translation. Two conditions were tested: perturbation amplitude of one SS was increased over trials while the other SS 1) did not move or 2) was perturbed with constant amplitude. With the use of system identification techniques, {{the response of the}} ankle torques to the perturbation amplitudes (i. e., the <b>torque</b> <b>sensitivity</b> functions) was determined and how much each leg contributed to stabilize stance (i. e., stabilizing mechanisms) was estimated. Increased amplitude of one SS resulted in a decreased <b>torque</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> The <b>torque</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to the constant perturbed SS showed no significant differences. The properties of the stabilizing mechanisms remained constant during perturbations of each SS. This study demonstrates that proprioceptive information from each leg is weighted independently and that the weight decreases with perturbation amplitude. Weighting of proprioceptive information of one leg has no influence on the weight of the proprioceptive information of the other leg. According to the sensory reweighting hypothesis, vestibular information must be up-weighted, because closing the eyes eliminates visual information...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn {{the context}} of safe human [...] robot {{physical}} interaction, this paper introduces a new method {{for the detection of}} dynamic impacts of flexible-joint robot manipulators with their environment. The objective is to detect external impacts applied to the robot using only proprioceptive information with maximal sensitivity. Several model-based detection methods in robotics are based on the difference, called residual, between the estimated and the actual applied <b>torques.</b> <b>Sensitivity</b> of such methods can be limited by model uncertainties that originate either from errors on experimentally identified model parameters, possibly varying with the operating conditions, or the use of simplified models, which results in a residual dependence on the robot's state. The main contribution of this paper consists of a new adaptive residual evaluation method that takes into account this dependence, which otherwise can lead to a tradeoff between sensitivity and false alarm rate. The proposed approach uses only proprioceptive motor-side measurements and does not require any additional joint position sensors or force/torque sensors. Dynamic effects of a collision on the residual are isolated using bandpass filtering and comparison with a state-dependent dynamic threshold. Adaptive online estimation of filter coefficients avoids the need for extensive experiments for parametric model identification.

The analysis tool is a unique, semianalytical finite element formulation that admits precise representation of the tooth geometry and contact forces that are crucial in gear dynamics.

METHODS: Delayed-onset muscle pain was induced in the trunk extensors of 60 healthy volunteers using an exercise paradigm. Levels of fear of pain and experimental pain sensitivity were measured before exercise. Pain intensity in the low back was collected at 24 and 48 hours post-exercise.

RESULTS: The final models predicting whether a participant reported clinically meaningful pain intensity at 24 hours only included baseline fear of pain at each level of pain intensity tested. The final model at 48 hours included average baseline pain sensitivity and the loss of muscle performance during the exercise protocol for 1 level of pain intensity tested (greater than 35 mm of 100 mm).

The detection thresholds were found to be in the range 1 − 3 % of the peak <b>torque.</b> This high <b>sensitivity</b> was interpreted as being consistent with the existing literature in that humans are more sensitive to stimulation at high frequencies than that at low frequencies.

The weldability of both alloys was evaluated by performing a deep morphological, microestrutural and mechanical characterization {{of a large number}} of welds produced under a wide range of welding conditions. Simultaneously, the plastic behaviour of both base materials was characterized by accomplishing an extensive mechanical characterization program, which included performing uniaxial tests, under different temperatures and loading conditions, as well as a deep literature review on microestrutural and phenomenological modelling of aluminium alloys plasticity. The hardening behaviour of the aluminium alloys, at increasing temperatures and strain rates, was then related to base material weldability. It was found that the AA 6082 alloy, which displays intense flow softening during tensile loading at high temperatures, and is sensitive to dynamic precipitation and overageing under intense non-uniform deformation, displays good weldability in FSW. Under the same welding conditions, the AA 5083 alloy, which in quasi-static conditions displays steady flow behaviour at increasing temperatures, and is sensitive to moderate hardening at high strain rates, displays poor weldability. The relations between FSW parameters, classified as independent variables, and base material properties and weld inspection results, classified as dependent variables, were also explored based on <b>torque</b> <b>sensitivity</b> analysis. It was possible to depict a strong influence of base material properties and plate’s thickness on the torque recorded during welding. <b>Torque</b> <b>sensitivity</b> analysis also showed the suitability of this output process parameter for capturing the different sensitivity of both base materials to varying tool rotation and traverse speeds. In spite of this, the evolution of torque with tool traverse and rotation speed was found to be satisfactorily described by a unique power law equation, for both base materials, indicating that the torque registered during welding is a suitable output parameter to be used in FSW process control. Finally, an extensive mechanical characterization of the welds produced for both alloys was accomplished using testing procedures, and strain data analysis techniques, developed under the scope of current work. From this work it was possible to conclude that the global strength of the welds was relatively independent of welding conditions, for both alloys tested in current work. In this way, the most suitable welding parameters for each alloy should be the ones that conduct to the best performance in terms of welding productivity...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{an attempt}} {{is made to}} {{synthesize}} a mapping from the observed behaviors of a physical system to its geometric and material parameters. Two different approaches are adopted: one is the standard "black-box" approach; {{the other is a}} physical-structure based approach. A DC torque motor is used as an example system. In this thesis, it is desired to identify four unknown motor parameters: rotor inertia, friction coefficient, <b>torque</b> <b>sensitivity,</b> and rotor winding resistance. The two identification methods are first used on a set of simulated noise-free data and later verified with an experimental data set. It is found that the conventional linear black-box identification method is inadequate to synthesize a sought-for mapping. Though, generally the approach is powerful in capturing the observed behavior, it does not provide a guide to the choice of the observed input and output which would possibly lead to a unique identification of the physical parameters. So the result from this approach is a non-unique mapping from observed behaviors to motor parameters. Furthermore, the approach could lead to a model order higher than necessary to identify the physical parameters.

This thesis presents some methods for improving the estimation accuracy of the reduced order dynamic model, particularly with regard to the importance of a correct formulation for the base parametric set and the dependance of parameter estimation accuracy on the <b>torque</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> The thesis also experimentally implement an algorithm for trajectory optimization for estimation by the LMS adaptive law. Practical methods are suggested for carrying out the optimization. Results are presented based on experimentation conducted on an electric and a hydraulic manipulator; a brief description is also provided on the software that was developed for this purpose. Identification results in one case were seen to closely approximate those previously determined by explicit measurements by Khatib et al. Finally, a comparison between ordinary PD control and feedforward control using the available model shows the promise of actual ability to implement model based control. However, a comparison {{of the results of the}} control performance between a direct drive manipulator and a geared manipulator indicate that unmodelled dynamics play a central role in increasing the error bounds of the identified parmeters.

40|$|Nonwoven {{single-use}} surgical gowns {{are used}} and frequently {{touched by the}} human skin. Interaction with human senses is therefore an important performance property. When touched by the human hand, friction {{is one of the}} first feelings and therefore friction coefficient is an important parameter. Recently, a patented laboratory instrument was investigated and designed at the University of Minho based on an innovative method of accessing friction coefficient of 2 D surfaces (fabrics, nonwovens, soft papers). Unlikely other methods, FRICTORQ is based on a rotary movement and therefore on the measurement of a friction reaction torque. On the more recent version the contact between the 2 D sample and the instrument contact sensor is restricted to 3 small special elements radially disposed at 120 °. Providing during the test a relative displacement of approximately 90 °, it is assured that a new portion of the sample is always moved under the sensors. In the model, friction coefficient is worked out from the friction reaction torque measured by means of a high <b>sensitivity</b> <b>torque</b> sensor, the normal load created by the contact sensor and a geometrical parameter. Contact pressure on the fabric samples was set to 3, 5 kPa and the linear velocity in the geometric centre of each contact element was approximately 1, 5 mm/s. In the paper, a description of the instrument is given as well as its fundamentals and working principle followed by a study, where a comparison between three different materials for manufacturing medical gowns was performed under controlled atmosphere. The tested materials were materials were two Spunlace nonwoven and one SMS. The results of the experimental work are analysed using various tools, including SPSS 14. 0 ® statistical package and discussed on the light of the importance of friction to the performance of surgical gowns. Differences in friction coefficient were detected associated to the manufacturing process, composition of the nonwoven materials and outer or inner-faces...|$|R
40|$|A vehicle start/stop {{engine system}} is {{investigated}} with focus on human perception of discomfort. The FRF between engine rotational acceleration around the neutral torque axis (NTA) and seat rail acceleration {{with the specific}} interest in start up and shut down events is estimated from measurements, using a shaker torque excitation. The inverted <b>torque</b> <b>sensitivity</b> formulates a frequency dependent target of powertrain torque related to seat rail acceleration. The main rotation direction for the transversally mounted engine is the pitch-direction, yielding high acceleration levels in both longitudinal x-, and vertical z-direction compared to the lateral y-direction. Specific weighting functions are used to normalize these accelerations to human perception. Acceleration levels in x-, and z-direction at the seat rail are similar after weighting curves have been applied. The amount of discomfort experienced by a person depends on vibration amplitude, frequency, direction and time duration. However, {{there is no evidence}} on in what way a specific time dependence affects the perceived comfort. The NTA around which the engine as a rigid body rotates is experimentally estimated and verified by comparing to the reference CAD NTA. The powertrain mounting system center of gravity is assumed to be known from the CAD model. The seat rail is found to be a more convenient measurement position to use in order to achieve reproducible results rather than the seat cushion. This, since the acceleration at the cushion also depends on several other factors such as person size, weight and body posture and also on the non-linear properties of the seat foam padding...|$|E
40|$|Prognostics could employ several {{approaches}} {{with the}} aim to detect incipient failures due to a progressive wear of a primary flight command electro hydraulic actuator (EHA); the efficacy shown in failure detection drives {{the choice of the}} best ones, since not all the algorithms might be useful for the intended purpose. This happens because some of them could be suitable only for specific applications while giving bad results for others. The development of a fault detection algorithm is thus beneficial for anticipating the incoming failure and alerting the maintenance crew so as to properly schedule the servomechanism replacement; such algorithm should be able to identify the precursors of the above mentioned EHA failure and its degradation pattern. This paper presents a research focused on the development of a prognostic methodology, able to identify symptoms alerting that an EHA component is degrading and will eventually exhibit an anomalous behavior; in detail, six different types of progressive failures have been considered (dry friction acting of servovalve spool or mechanical actuator, radial clearance between spool and sleeve, shape of the corners of the spool lands, <b>torque</b> <b>sensitivity</b> of the first stage torque motor, contamination of the first stage filter). To achieve such objectives, an innovative model based fault detection technique has been developed merging together the information achieved by FFT analysis and proper "failure precursors" (calculated comparing the actual EHA responses with the expected ones), relying upon a set of failure maps. The robustness of the proposed technique has been assessed through a simulation test environment, built on the purpose. Such simulation has demonstrated that the methodology has adequate robustness; also, the ability to early identify an eventual malfunctioning has been proved with low risk of missed failures or false positives...|$|E
