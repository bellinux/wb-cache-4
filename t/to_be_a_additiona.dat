It should be emphasized, however, that there are not any scientific publications indicating that Bt crops have anything to do with honey bee declines. All studies performed to date support the contention that Bt toxins, called Cry proteins, are in fact toxic to only a narrow range of insect groups. For example, the Bt transgenes that have so far been incorporated into crops such as corn and canola <b>are</b> toxic <b>to</b> Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) or Coleoptera (beetles).

Thus, full automation via direct analysis of the entire given system {{has so far been}} impractical even for systems of modest complexity.

We wanted to assess further whether special risks such as exacerbation of extracellular acidification reflecting progressive exhaustion of the capacity to buffer H+ in the extracellular space are associated with repeated short ischemic insults. We monitored spontaneous electrical activity, extracellular direct-current potential, extracellular H+ activity, and tissue Pco 2 in the cerebral cortex of rats subjected to four cycles of 3 -minute ischemia produced by four-vessel occlusion with 27 -minute reperfusion after each insult. Except for electrical activity, which failed to recover fully from the first ischemic insult, all parameters returned to a level close to normal after each reperfusion. Changes during ischemia did not evolve with repetition of the insult. Electrical silence occurred within approximately 20 seconds after the onset of each ischemic episode and always preceded the steep drop of direct-current potential, indicating ischemic depolarization.

There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> quantitative covariance between the increase in lactate production and the rise in [32 P]Fru- 1, 6 -P 2 induced by different platelet-activating agents.

Variations in 32 P-labelled intermediates were apparent 5 s after flux activation, but the major changes in [32 P]Fru- 1, 6 -P 2 occurred much later and fell in periods in which a constant lactate formation was maintained. The cyanide-induced changes in 32 P-labelled intermediates depended on the extracellular level of glucose, showing a predominant ATP → Pi conversion in glucose-depleted medium that shifted to an ATP → Fru- 1, 6 -P 2 conversion at excess glucose.

This study examines the role of binding interactions in dehalogenase catalysis. The enzyme and substrate groups positioned for favorable binding interaction were identified from the X-ray crystal structure of the enzyme- 4 -HBA- 3 ′-dephospho-CoA complex. These groups were individually modified (via site-directed mutagenesis or chemical synthesis) {{for the purpose of}} disrupting the binding interaction. The changes in the Gibbs free energy of the enzyme-substrate complex (∆∆GES) and enzyme-transition state complex (∆∆G q) brought about by the modification were measured. Cases where ∆∆G q exceeds ∆∆GES are indicative of binding interactions used for catalysis. On the basis of this analysis, we show that the H-bond interactions between the Gly 114 and Phe 64 backbone amide NHs and the substrate benzoyl CdO group contribute an additional 3. 1 kcal/mol of stabilization at the rate-limiting transition state. The binding interactions between the enzyme and the substrate CoA nucleotide moiety also intensify in the rate-limiting transition state, reducing the energy barrier to catalysis by <b>an</b> <b>additiona...</b>|$|R
