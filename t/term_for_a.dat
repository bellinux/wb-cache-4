5|$|The name Malkin {{has several}} {{possible}} derivations: {{it was a}} familiar form of the female names Mary or Maud, and a <b>term</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> poor or shabby woman; the similar mawkin was a word used to describe a lower-class woman or slut. Malkin was also used as a <b>term</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> cat, particularly an old cat, as in grimalkin or grey malkin, and was an old northern English name for a hare, into which witches {{were said to be}} able to transfigure. It has also been suggested that the name was a combination of mal and kin as a slight to the residents of Malkin Tower, which local historian Arthur Douglas considers unlikely owing to the poor education of people in the area at that time. Another possibility is a corruption of malt kiln, which is supported by a claim made by Alizon Device that the family of Anne Whittle, also known as Chattox, had broken into their fire house.|$|E

5|$|Central eclipse {{is often}} used as a generic <b>term</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> total, annular, or hybrid eclipse. This is, however, not {{completely}} correct: {{the definition of a}} central eclipse is an eclipse during which the central line of the umbra touches the Earth's surface. It is possible, though extremely rare, that part of the umbra intersects with the Earth (thus creating an annular or total eclipse), but not its central line. This is then called a non-central total or annular eclipse. The last (umbral yet) non-central solar eclipse was on April 29, 2014. This was an annular eclipse. The next non-central total solar eclipse will be on April 9, 2043.|$|E
5|$|Paratheria is an {{obsolete}} <b>term</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{taxonomic group}} including the xenarthran mammals (sloths, anteaters, and armadillos) and various groups {{thought to be}} related to them. It was proposed by Oldfield Thomas in 1887 to set apart the sloths, anteaters, armadillos, and pangolins, usually classified as placentals, from both marsupial and placental mammals, an arrangement that received little support from other workers. When teeth of the extinct gondwanathere mammals were first discovered in Argentina in the 1980s, they were thought {{to be related to}} xenarthrans, leading to renewed attention for the hypothesis that xenarthrans are not placentals. However, by the early 1990s, gondwanatheres were shown to be unrelated to xenarthrans, and xenarthrans are still considered to be placentals.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the time}} of McCarthy, the word McCarthyism has entered American speech as a general <b>term</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> variety of practices: aggressively {{questioning}} a person's patriotism, making poorly supported accusations, using accusations of disloyalty to pressure a person to adhere to conformist politics or to discredit an opponent, subverting {{civil and political rights}} in the name of national security, and the use of demagoguery are all often referred to as McCarthyism. McCarthyism can also be synonymous with the term witch-hunt, both referring to mass hysteria and moral panic.|$|E

5|$|The Saluki was {{historically}} bred in the Fertile Crescent where agriculture originated. Images {{of running}} dogs with long, narrow bodies adorn pottery found in Susa {{that dates back}} to 6,000 years ago in ancient Mesopotamia, with one writer suggesting that these might depict the ancestor of the Saluki, despite the depictions bearing erect, pointed ears. Salukis and Greyhounds were increasingly depicted on Egyptian tombs from the Middle Kingdom (2134 BC–1785 BC) onward, however it was during the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt that Salukis rose to prominence, replacing the Tesem (thought to be similar to modern Pariah dogs or a generic <b>term</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> dog) in ancient Egyptian art. The breed spread southward into the Sudan.|$|E
5|$|The common <b>term</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{place at}} which one may dive is a dive site.

5|$|Women in Mediaeval and Renaissance Europe were legally {{assumed to}} be subject to their fathers, then to their husbands after marriage. The status of women within Mediaeval trades was largely {{dependent}} on the local interpretation of femme sole, the legal <b>term</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> single woman. This was usually the widow of a tradesman, who was permitted to continue her husband's business after his death, and often established in the rights and privileges of his trade guild or company. More rarely, single women would achieve success in their father's trade. Exceptions occurred mainly in trades linked to traditional women's occupations, such as haberdashery and needlecraft.|$|E
5|$|A soccer kick, {{also known}} as a soccer ball kick in puroresu and shoot fighting, is a {{reference}} to a kick that is similar to kicks used in association football. It is the colloquial <b>term</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> kick performed against a prone, kneeling, rising or supine opponent by a fighter who is in a standing or semi-standing position, to any part of a downed opponent. The soccer kick was used in the first match of the Ultimate Fighting Championship at UFC 1 in 1993. Gerard Gordeau defeated Teila Tuli with a soccer kick, which also knocked out one of Tuli's teeth. The technique is banned under the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts however other rulesets, including the ones used by Pride Fighting Championships do permit them. Soccer kicks have been regularly discussed as to potential damage. There has been a regular debate on the usage of them within MMA. Some MMA fans and fighters support them while a fight doctor and politicians have opposed them.|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines possess sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, and amnesic actions, {{which are}} useful {{in a variety of}} {{indications}} such as alcohol dependence, seizures, anxiety disorders, panic, agitation, and insomnia. Most are administered orally; however, they can also be given intravenously, intramuscularly, or rectally. In general, benzodiazepines are well-tolerated and are safe and effective drugs in the short <b>term</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> wide range of conditions. Tolerance can develop to their effects and there is also a risk of dependence, and upon discontinuation a withdrawal syndrome may occur. These factors, combined with other possible secondary effects after prolonged use such as psychomotor, cognitive, or memory impairments, limit their long-term applicability. The effects of long-term use or misuse include the tendency to cause or worsen cognitive deficits, depression, and anxiety. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia recommends discontinuing the usage of benzodiazepines in those on opioids and those who have used them long term.|$|E
