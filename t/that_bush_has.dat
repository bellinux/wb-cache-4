Firstly, critics have opined that the United States should deal with solving domestic issues before concentrating on space exploration. Secondly, of the funding {{over the next five years}} <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> proposed, only US$1 billion will be in new appropriations while the remaining US$11 billion will be reallocated from NASA's other programs, and therefore inadequate to fully realize this vision. Most of the spending for the new program, and most of the budget cuts for existing programs, are scheduled after the last year of the Bush presidency. It is unclear how the space vision will be reconciled with budgetary concerns in the longer term.|$|E
500|$|Colbert's {{performance}} {{received a}} variety of reactions from the media. In Washington, the response from both politicians and the press corps was negative—both groups having been targets of Colbert's satire. The Washington press corps felt that Colbert had bombed. The Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen found that Colbert's jokes were [...] "lame and insulting" [...] and wrote that Colbert was [...] "rude" [...] and a [...] "bully". Politician Steny Hoyer felt that Colbert had gone too far, telling the newspaper The Hill that [...] " [...] is the President of the United States, and he deserves some respect". Conservative pundit Mary Matalin called Colbert's performance a [...] "predictable, Bush-bashing kind of humor". Columnist Ana Marie Cox chastised those who praised Colbert as a hero: [...] "I somehow doubt <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> never heard these criticisms before". She added, [...] "Comedy can have a political point {{but it is not}} political action".|$|E
500|$|In the {{following}} episode of The Chaser's War on Everything, the team emphasised that their only realistic attempt {{to disguise the}} vehicles {{was the use of}} a Canadian flag. Taylor later said that there was [...] "no particular reason we chose Canada, we just thought they'd be a country who the cops wouldn't scrutinise too closely, and who feasibly would only have three cars in their motorcade—as opposed to the 20 or so gas guzzlers <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> brought with him". There were many deliberate indications that the motorcade was not genuine, particularly on the fake credentials used by the team; members' security passes were printed with JOKE, Insecurity, and It's pretty obvious this isn't a real pass all clearly visible, while the APEC 2007 Official Vehicle stickers included both the name of the series and the text This dude likes trees and poetry and certain types of carnivorous plants excite him. In addition, some of the runners were holding camcorders and one of the motorcyclists was wearing jeans, both highly unusual for an official motorcade.|$|E

5000|$|May {{supported}} the 2003 invasion of Iraq {{as well as}} the 2007 [...] "surge" [...] strategy in the country. In March 2008, he wrote for National Review Online, [...] "what one can not say is that regime change in Iraq was unjustified: Not if you know Saddam’s record, his clearly stated intentions, and his ties to international terrorists—including, as a new Pentagon report reveals, a group headed by Ayman al-Zawahiri, now al Qaeda’s second-in-command." [...] In an April 2004 interview with Tavis Smiley, who alleged <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>had</b> decided to invade Iraq before the 9/11 attacks and manipulated intelligence on weapons of mass destruction, May argued <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>had</b> been continuing the policy of the Clinton-era Iraq Liberation Act and <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>had</b> pushed the CIA for accurate information.|$|R

Tricky wrote an article about The Kick Inside, saying: [...] "Her music has always sounded like dreamland to me.... I don't believe in God, but if I did, her music would be my bible". Suede front-man Brett Anderson stated about Hounds Of Love: [...] "I love the way it's a record of two halves, and the second half is a concept record about fear of drowning. It's an amazing record to listen to really late at night, unsettling and really jarring". John Lydon, better known as Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols, declared her work to be [...] "beauty beyond belief". Rotten once wrote a song for her, titled [...] "Bird in Hand" [...] (about exploitation of parrots) that Bush rejected. Bush was one of the singers who Prince thanked in the liner notes of 1991's Diamonds and Pearls. In December 1989, Robert Smith of The Cure chose [...] "The Sensual World" [...] as his favourite single of the year, The Sensual World as his favourite album of the year and included [...] "all of Kate Bush" [...] plus other artists in his list, [...] "the best things about the eighties".|$|E

[...] "Immediately following 9/11, the mainstream news media (represented by CBS, ABC, NBC, USA Today, The New York Times, as well as The Washington Post) did echo Bush, but within eight weeks it began to intentionally ignore certain information the president was sharing and instead reframed the president's themes or intentionally introduced new material to shift the focus." ...|$|E

50|$|Some polls {{also showed}} that the {{majority}} of Americans believed that President Bush had made his case against Iraq. The Gallup poll, for example, found that 67% of those who watched the speech felt that the case had been made, which was a jump from 47% just prior the speech. However, many more Republicans than Democrats watched the speech, so this may not be an accurate reflection of the overall opinion of the American public. An ABC news poll found little difference in the percentage of Americans who felt <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> made his case for war after he had made his speech, with the percentage remaining at about 40%.|$|E
5000|$|The {{music video}} opens on a closeup of Kate Bush, dressed in dark green camouflage, holding a child. She blinks in {{synchronisation}} with the song's sampled gun cocks. The camera pulls out and shows <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> a white-haired child on her lap. The child walks off and returns in military combat uniform. Bush and several soldiers (one of whom has [...] "KT8" [...] or [...] "KTB" [...] stencilled on {{the butt of}} his rifle: [...] "KTB" [...] was a monogram used by Bush early in her career) make their way through woodland, amid explosions. As the song progresses, Bush reaches out for the child soldier, but he disappears. Finally, one of the soldiers is blown up.|$|E

50|$|Several albums {{on local}} Texas labels soon followed. His renewed {{visibility}} {{made him a}} mentor figure to younger Texas musicians who revered the honky-tonk/hardcore country sound <b>that</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>has</b> done so much to keep in the public eye. Austin musicians like Dale Watson and Cornell Hurd sought him out to play on their albums.

In 2007 he released his autobiography, with the aide of Rick Mitchell: Whiskey River (Take My Mind): The True Story of Texas Honky-Tonk, published by University of Texas Press. A new album, Kashmere Garden Mud: A Tribute to Houston’s Country Soul was released on the Icehouse label at the same time.|$|E
