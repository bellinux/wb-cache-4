40|$|Abstract—This paper {{deals with}} a {{modeling}} of components and calculation of <b>transient</b> <b>overvoltages</b> that build up on the trans-former primary terminals after the transformer has been switched off by a vacuum circuit breaker (VCB). The transformer is con-nected to the circuit breaker by a cable. The <b>transient</b> <b>overvoltages</b> are calculated for different cable lengths, and the cumulative prob-ability of different arc angles is investigated. In this study two cases are considered: <b>transient</b> <b>overvoltages</b> due to steady-state magnetizing current switching, and <b>transient</b> <b>overvoltages</b> due to inrush current switching. It is shown that the case of inrush current switching is worse, as virtual current chop-ping is possible. The cable is modeled by pi sections, whereas the transformer model {{is based on a}} terminal impedance. The VCB re-ignitions are modeled by means of withstand voltage character-istics and high-frequency quenching capability. Due to shortage of field tests, this work uses only literature references to compare the results with actual measurements. Index Terms—Modeling, overvoltage, transformer, VCB. I...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} <b>transient</b> <b>overvoltages</b> in ac {{machines}} drives fed from voltage source converters. High voltage gradients and <b>transient</b> <b>overvoltages</b> stress the insulation system of a motor and can dramatically decrease its lifetime and, therefore, reduce the service {{life of the}} drive. In this thesis, an exact high frequency model of a drive system is designed. This model enables not only to investigate motor <b>transient</b> <b>overvoltages,</b> but also provides a fast design of protective devices. The proposed models of particular parts of the drive {{can also be used}} in other fields of electrical engineering - for analyses of transmission lines in telecommunications and power engineering, lightning strike analysis, etc. The high frequency model of an induction machine is suggested and a special set of measurements and calculation methods is proposed {{in order to determine the}} motor's high frequency characteristics.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the analysis of}} <b>transient</b> <b>overvoltages</b> in medium voltage (33 kV) network and the research is based on feeder lines in the Uva province. Parameters which influence lightning performance of overhead distribution lines such as line height, line length, type of structure, availability of shield wire and flash density {{in the area are}} discussed in details. More over, failures due to <b>transient</b> <b>overvoltages</b> {{and its impact on the}} reliability of the network are analyzed in this study. Lightning may cause flashovers from direct strokes or induced voltage from nearby strokes. Direct lightning to power distribution lines causes insulation flashovers in great majority of the cases. Therefore the goal of this research is to estimate the lightning performance level of feeder lines and investigate improvements. Shielding effect from nearby trees, critical flashover voltages for different flashover paths and deterioration of insulation with aging are also discussed. Thus the analysis of lightning related incidents such as transformer failures, arrester failures and nuisance fuse blows are presented. The study of transformer installation reveals that arrester lead length becomes critical during a lightning discharge since it generates high voltage stress in the winding which may fail the distribution transformer. Earth rod impulse resistance is also an important parameter which increases the voltage stress. It is necessary to develop models, using, electrical parameters for simulation of <b>transient</b> <b>overvoltages.</b> The PSCAD software is especially developed to study transient simulations of power systems. Variation of <b>transient</b> <b>overvoltages</b> due to strikes to phase wires, strikes to earth wire, and variation due to striking distance are discussed in this study. Further, simulation of surge arrester performance and nuisance fuse blows are also presented.
