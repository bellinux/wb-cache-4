The definitive version is available at: [URL] the advent of production electronic throttle control there is scope for increased customer satisfaction through the optimization of the throttle pedal demand map to individual drivers. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop algorithms to identify, from variables measured in real time on a <b>test</b> <b>vehicle,</b> the <b>requirement</b> for and the direction of adaptation of throttle pedal progression. An on-line appraisal procedure has been developed to identify the individual 'ideal' progression (IIP) for any driver. During the appraisal the subject is exposed to a series of pedal progressions, and their verbal response to each change is used to converge to their optimal setting. Vehicle data acquired on these appraisal drives have been regressed against IIP in a full factorial study, and the most statistically significant driver model established. A preliminary implementation of the model is used to demonstrate that throttle progression adapts appropriately towards IIP, thereby matching vehicle performance feel to driver expectations...|$|R

40|$|The National Space Transportation Policy (NSTP), {{describes}} the challenge facing today's aerospace industry. 'Assuring reliable and affordable access to space through U. S. space transportation capabilities {{is a fundamental}} goal of the U. S. space program'. Experience from the Space Shuttle Program (SSP) tells us that launch and mission operations are responsible for approximately 45 % {{of the cost of}} each shuttle mission. Reducing these costs is critical to NSTP goals in the next generation launch vehicle. Based on this, an innovative alternative approach to vehicle element processing was developed with an emphasis on reduced launch costs. State-of-the-art upgrades to the launch processing system (LPS) will enhance vehicle ground operations. To carry this one step further, these upgrade could be implemented at various vehicle element manufacturing sites to ensure system compatibility between the manufacturing facility and the launch site.

40|$|The {{concept of}} a Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV) is to {{displace}} consumption of gasoline by using electricity from the vehicle’s large battery pack to power the vehicle {{as much as possible}} with minimal engine operation. This paper assesses the PHEV emissions and operation. Currently, <b>testing</b> of <b>vehicle</b> emissions is done using the federal standard FTP 4 cycle on a dynamometer at ambient (75 °F) temperatures. Research was also completed using the US 06 cycle. Furthermore, research was completed at high (95 °F) and low (20 °F) temperatures. Initial dynamometer testing was performed on a stock Toyota Prius under the standard FTP 4 cycle, and the more demanding US 06 cycle. Each cycle was run at 95 °F, 75 °F, and 20 °F. The testing was repeated with the same Prius retrofi tted with an EnergyCS Plug-in Hybrid Electric system. The results of the testing confi rm that the stock Prius meets Super-Ultra Low Emission <b>Vehicle</b> <b>requirements</b> under current <b>testing</b> procedures, while the PHEV Prius under current testing procedures were greater than Super-Ultra Low Emission <b>Vehicle</b> <b>requirements,</b> but still met Ultra Low Emission <b>Vehicle</b> <b>requirements.</b> Research points to the catalyst temperature being a critical factor in meeting emission requirements. Initial engine emissions pass through with minimal conversion until the catalyst is heated to typical operating temperatures of 300 – 400 °C. PHEVs also have trouble maintaining the minimum catalyst temperature throughout the entire test because the engine is turned off when the battery can support the load. It has been observed in both HEVs and PHEVs that the catalyst is intermittently unable to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions, which causes further emission releases. Research {{needs to be done to}} combat the initial emission spikes caused by a cold catalyst. Research also needs to be done to improve the reduction of nitrogen oxides by the catalyst system...|$|R

40|$|The {{test program}} {{developing}} parachutes for the Orion/MPCV includes drop tests with parachutes deployed from an Orion-like parachute compartment at {{a wide range}} of dynamic pressures. Aircraft and altitude constraints precluded the use of an Orion boilerplate capsule for several test points. Therefore, a dart-shaped <b>test</b> <b>vehicle</b> with a hi-fidelity mock-up of the Orion parachute compartment has been developed. The available aircraft options imposed constraints on the <b>test</b> <b>vehicle</b> development and concept of operations. Delivery of this <b>test</b> <b>vehicle</b> to the desired velocity, altitude, and orientation required for the test is a di cult problem involving multiple engineering disciplines. This paper describes the development of the test technique. The engineering challenges include extraction from an aircraft, reposition of the extraction parachute, and mid-air separation of two vehicles, neither of which has an active attitude control system. The desired separation behavior is achieved by precisely controlling the release point using on-board monitoring of the motion. The design of the <b>test</b> <b>vehicle</b> is also described. The trajectory simulations and other analyses used to develop this technique and predict the behavior of the <b>test</b> <b>vehicle</b> are reviewed in detail.
