5|$|A {{thallium}} atom has 81 electrons, {{arranged in}} the electron configuration 4f145d106s26p1; of <b>these,</b> <b>the</b> three outermost electrons {{in the sixth}} shell are valence electrons. Due to the inert pair effect, the 6s electron pair is relativistically stabilised and {{it is more difficult}} to get them involved in chemical bonding than for the heavier elements. Thus, very few electrons are available for metallic bonding, similar to the neighboring elements mercury and lead, and hence thallium, like its congeners, is a soft, highly electrically conducting metal with a low melting point of 304°C.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 434 were built; of <b>these,</b> <b>the</b> Germans seized 244 when they {{occupied}} Bohemia-Moravia in March 1939 and the Slovaks acquired 52 when they declared independence from Czechoslovakia {{at the same}} time. Others were exported to Bulgaria and Romania. In German service, it saw combat {{during the early years}} of World War II, notably the Invasion of Poland, the Battle of France and the invasion of the Soviet Union before being retired or sold off in 1942. It was used for the remainder of the war by other countries and as a training tank in Bulgaria into the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Above the troposphere, the {{atmosphere}} is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining {{the rate of change}} in temperature with height. Beyond <b>these,</b> <b>the</b> exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as 100km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between {{the atmosphere}} and outer space.|$|E

In 2013, San Diego had the lowest murder rate of the ten largest cities in the United States.|$|E
5|$|All the {{functions}} of DNA depend on interactions with proteins. These protein interactions can be non-specific, or the protein can bind specifically to a single DNA sequence.

Natural thorium consists of 0.02(2)% 230Th and 99.98(2)% 232Th; natural protactinium consists of 100% 231Pa; and natural uranium consists of 0.0054(5)% 234U, 0.7204(6)% 235U, and 99.2742(10)% 238U.|$|E

5|$|An {{expansion}} for The Age of Kings, , {{was released}} in 2000. It introduced numerous new game features, including unique technologies for each civilization, and five new civilizations. Two of <b>these,</b> <b>the</b> Aztecs and the Mayans, represent the New World and have new distinctive architectural style. Other new civilizations are the Spanish, Huns, and Koreans. Age of Mythology, released in 2002, {{broke away from the}} historical trend and instead focused on Greek, Egyptian, and Norse mythology. It shared many gameplay elements with The Age of Kings and was considered a spin-off of the main Age of Empires series.|$|E
5|$|Another {{prevalent}} form {{of religion}} in the Qing dynasty palace was Buddhism.

Buddhist iconography also proliferated in the interior decorations of many buildings. Of <b>these,</b> <b>the</b> Pavilion of the Rain of Flowers {{is one of the most}} important. It housed a large number of Buddhist statues, icons, and mandalas, placed in ritualistic arrangements.|$|E

5|$|Approximately sixteen {{lists of}} censured theses were {{issued by the}} University of Paris during the 13th and 14th centuries.

Of <b>these,</b> <b>the</b> Condemnations of 1277 are considered particularly important by those historians who consider {{that they had a}} side effect of encouraging scholars to question the tenets of Aristotelian science. From this perspective, some revisionist historians maintain that the condemnations had positive effects on the development of science, perhaps even representing the beginnings of modern science.|$|E

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 19th century, the Empire of Brazil was the richest and most {{powerful}} nation in Latin America. It thrived under democratic institutions and a constitutional monarchy, and prided itself on the absence of the caudillos, dictators and coups d'état which were common across the rest of the continent. During the minority of emperor PedroII in the 1830s, however, there had been internal rebellions driven by local disputes for power within a few provinces. One of <b>these,</b> <b>the</b> Ragamuffin War, had been led by Gonçalves, as noted above.|$|E

Upon capturing one of <b>these,</b> <b>the</b> examination reveals that the Outsiders' exotic crystalline structures behave {{in a manner similar}} to antennas, receiving a signal broadcast from a location buried underground on Earth.
