She is rescued by the Doctor (Christopher Eccleston) who destroys the building with an explosion. The next day, the Doctor visits Rose at her home where he is attacked by a plastic mannequin arm which he and Rose subdue. Rose investigates the Doctor and meets Clive (Mark Benton), who has been tracking the Doctor's appearances throughout history. Clive tells Rose the Doctor is dangerous, and that if he's <b>there,</b> <b>something</b> bad is about to happen. While Rose is talking to Clive, her boyfriend Mickey Smith (Noel Clarke) is kidnapped by a wheelie bin and replaced with a plastic doppelgänger.|$|E

[...] " [...] loves to play the classics," [...] Kenny Myers explained, [...] "and incorporating these two images was really genius on his part. He wanted there to be uncertainty about Gorkon's true intentions. Did he want peace, or was <b>there</b> <b>something</b> sinister in his mind?

Vrba acknowledged that several passages in I Cannot Forgive (1964) {{were based on}} secondhand accounts. According to his deposition for Eichmann's trial in 1961, he obtained his information about the gas chambers and crematoria from Sonderkommando Filip Müller and others who worked <b>there,</b> <b>something</b> that Müller confirmed in 1979. Zündel's lawyer, Doug Christie, accused Vrba of lying about Auschwitz and asked whether he had seen anyone gassed. Vrba replied that he had watched people being taken into the buildings and had seen SS officers throw in gas canisters after them: ...|$|E
500|$|Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz wrote: [...] "Why is <b>there</b> <b>something</b> {{rather than}} nothing? The {{sufficient}} reason [...] {{is found in}} a substance which [...] is a necessary being bearing the reason for its existence within itself." [...] Philosopher of physics Dean Rickles has argued that numbers and mathematics (or their underlying laws) may necessarily exist. Physics may conclude that time did not exist before 'Big Bang', but 'started' with the Big Bang and hence there might be no 'beginning', 'before' or potentially 'cause' and instead always existed. Some also argue that nothing cannot exist or that non-existence might never have been an option. Quantum fluctuations, or other laws of physics that may have existed {{at the start of}} the Big Bang could then create the conditions for matter to occur.|$|E

500|$|Coppola's {{first three}} films examine {{feminine}} self-definition and maturation, usually in privileged circumstance. Lost in Translation (2003) depicts an encounter and brief friendship between two lonely Americans in a luxurious Tokyo hotel; Marie Antoinette (2006), a stylized biopic of the eponymous queen, examined her loneliness. Somewhere examines similar themes {{of success and}} isolation, but from a male perspective. The film explores Marco's seclusion and depression despite his outward professional success and the resulting wealth and fame. He appears to suffer from anhedonia, the inability to feel pleasure, but the film itself is reticent in suggesting its causes. [...] "He believes he's nothing", summarized film critic Roger Ebert, [...] "and it appears he's correct". The film's opening shot, a Ferrari circling a race-track {{in and out of}} a stationary camera position, its whine and roar rising and falling, establishes the theme of ennui. The sequence's length also offers a visual cue from Coppola to relax, observe and withhold expectations. Coppola said she wanted to hint at this with a simple camera set-up, [...] "so you're alone with this guy and not aware that it's a movie. But I hope it's a welcome contrast to the style of most movies out <b>there.</b> <b>Something</b> that gives you a chance to take a breath".|$|E
500|$|Production of Spirited Away {{commenced}} in 2000 on {{a budget}} of ¥1.9 billion ($15 million). Disney invested 10% of the cost for the {{right of first refusal}} for American distribution. As with Princess Mononoke, Miyazaki and the Studio Ghibli staff experimented with computer animation. With the use of more computers and programs such as Softimage, the staff learned the software, but used the technology carefully so that it enhanced the story, instead of 'stealing the show'. Each character was mostly hand-drawn, with Miyazaki working alongside his animators to see they were getting it just right. The biggest difficulty in making the film was to reduce its length. When production started, Miyazaki realized it would be more than three hours long if he made it according to his plot. He had to delete many scenes from the story, and tried to reduce the [...] "eye-candy" [...] in the film because he wanted it to be simple. Miyazaki did not want to make the hero a [...] "pretty girl." [...] At the beginning, he was frustrated at how she looked [...] "dull" [...] and thought, [...] "She isn't cute. Isn't <b>there</b> <b>something</b> we can do?" [...] As the film neared the end, however, he was relieved to feel [...] "she will be a charming woman." ...|$|E

[...] He noted that [...] "a recent Gallup poll shows {{that a majority of}} the public actually agrees with the Court that corporations and unions should be treated just like individuals in terms of their political-expenditure rights". A Gallup poll taken in October 2009 and released soon after the decision showed 57percent of those surveyed agreed that contributions to political candidates are a form of free speech and 55percent agreed that the same rules should apply to individuals, corporations and unions. Sixty-four percent of Democrats and Republicans believed campaign donations are a form of free speech.|$|E

[...] Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com commented that plot points such as the Visitors attempting to create worldwide instability by printing fake IDs were unbelievable, and that talk of launching a resistance movement was [...] "tiresome and pointless".
