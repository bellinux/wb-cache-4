50|$|Comb <b>trapping</b> <b>method</b> (also {{known as}} the {{swarming}} method) is based on interrupting the honey bee brood cycle.

At 9-day intervals, the queen is confined to a new comb, and the brood in the old comb is left to be reared. The brood in the previous comb, now capped and infested with Varroa mites, is removed. The cycle is repeated. This complex method can remove up to 80% of Varroa mites in the hive.|$|E

Bait, in the form of some piece of meat, was suspended above the pit to draw the tiger's attention upward.

Flavanols and proanthocyanidins were determined, and the antioxidant activity was tested by total phenolic index (TPI), ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and total radical trapping antioxidant parameter (<b>TRAP)</b> <b>methods.</b> The rates of flavanol and total proanthocyanidin loss increased with roasting temperatures. Moisture content of the roasted beans being equal, high temperature-short time processes minimised proanthocyanidins loss. Moisture content being equal, the average roasting temperature (135 C) determined the highest TPI and FRAP values and the highest temperature (145 C) determined the lowest TPI values.

5000|$|Hydrodynamic {{trapping}} is advantageous in microfluidics. Other trapping devices utilize acoustic, electric, magnetic, {{and optical}} fields for trapping. This device uses solely hydrodynamic flow. Since {{it does not}} utilize acoustic, electric, magnetic, or optical fields, the particles being studied {{do not need to}} possess chemical or physical characteristics that cater to these fields. Instead, hydrodynamic trapping is universal and can be used on any particles. Hydrodynamic traps are able to confine small nanoparticles. This is because the hydrodynamic trapping force is closely related to radius of a particle, whereas alternate trapping methods are more closely related to volume of a particle. These traps are stable and they allow for precise control of environmental factors. This means that if a specific nanoparticle in a solution is desired for study, this nanoparticle can be trapped in concentrated sample suspensions. The surrounding medium in the trap can be easily controlled. [...] In addition to the previously mentioned advantages of using hydrodynamic trapping, hydrodynamic trapping is also a relatively low cost <b>trapping</b> <b>method,</b> and it is very easy to use and analyze. It is also simple and inexpensive to incorporate into existing soft lithography based microfluidic systems.|$|E
5000|$|The two thorns {{that give}} N. bicalcarata its name {{are unique to}} this species and bear {{some of the largest}} nectaries in the plant kingdom. The purpose of these {{structures}} has long been debated among botanists. Frederick William Burbidge suggested that they might serve to deter arboreal mammals such as tarsiers, lorises and monkeys from stealing the contents of the pitchers. In an article published in 1982, Cliff Dodd speculated on the function of the thorns, but did not believe they play a role in prey capture. Charles Clarke observed that monkeys and tarsiers rip the pitchers open at the sides in order to feed from them, rather than reaching in through the pitcher mouth. However, he found that the mammals attacked the pitchers of N. bicalcarata less frequently than those of other species, such as N. rafflesiana. Clarke's observations suggest that the spines likely serve to lure insects into a precarious position over the pitcher mouth, where they may lose their footing and fall into the pitcher fluid, eventually drowning. A similar <b>trapping</b> <b>method</b> is employed by the Sumatran endemic N. lingulata, which has a single [...] appendage positioned over the pitcher mouth. However, in that species the appendage is a structure of the lid and not the peristome.|$|E

40|$|Documentation {{of insect}} {{diversity}} {{is an important}} component of the study of biodiversity, community dynamics, and global change. Accurate identification of insects usually requires catching individuals for close inspection. However, because insects are so diverse, most <b>trapping</b> <b>methods</b> are specifically tailored to a particular taxonomic group. For scientists interested in the broadest possible spectrum of insect taxa, whether for long term monitoring of an ecosystem or for a species inventory, the use of several different <b>trapping</b> <b>methods</b> is usually necessary. We describe a novel composite method for capturing a diverse spectrum of insect taxa. The Composite Insect Trap incorporates elements from four different existing trapping methods: the cone trap, malaise trap, pan trap, and flight intercept trap. It is affordable, resistant, easy to assemble and disassemble, and collects a wide variety of insect taxa. Here we describe the design, construction, and effectiveness of the Composite Insect Trap tested during a study of insect diversity. The trap catches a broad array of insects and can eliminate the need to use multiple trap types in biodiversity studies. We propose that the Composite Insect Trap is a useful addition to the <b>trapping</b> <b>methods</b> currently available to ecologists and will be extremely effective for monitoring community level dynamics, biodiversity assessment, and conservation and restoration work. In addition, the Composite Insect Trap will be of use to other insect specialists, such as taxonomists, that are interested in describing the insect taxa in a given area...|$|R
