5|$|Greenland ice cores show {{evidence}} of a large volcanic eruption in 1642±5BCE, which was suggested as being associated with Santorini. However, volcanic ash retrieved from an ice core does not match the expected Santorini fingerprint. The late Holocene eruption of the Mount Aniakchak, a volcano in Alaska, is now believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of the minute shards of volcanic glass in the Greenland ice core.|$|E
5|$|Late 18th-century critics {{felt that}} Smart's madness {{justified}} them in ignoring his A Song to David, {{but during the}} following century Robert Browning and his contemporaries considered his condition <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of his genius. It {{was not until the}} 20th century, with the rediscovery of Jubilate Agno (not published until 1939), that critics reconsidered Smart's case and began to see him as a revolutionary poet, the possible target of a plot by his father-in-law, a publisher, to silence him.|$|E
5|$|Plumes from Enceladus, {{which are}} similar in {{composition}} to comets, have been shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of the material in Saturn's E ring. The E ring is the widest and outermost ring of Saturn (except for the tenuous Phoebe ring). It is an extremely wide but diffuse disk of microscopic icy or dusty material distributed between the orbits of Mimas and Titan.|$|E

5|$|The Baltic Sea coast {{has been}} a source of Eurasian amber trade since prehistoric times (see Amber Road). Neolithic {{artifacts}} made of amber were discovered in nearby Juodkrantė in the 19th century - these artifacts unfortunately disappeared during the 20th century. Lithuanian mythology, folklore, and art have long associations with amber; the legend of Jūratė and Kastytis imagines an undersea palace of amber under the Baltic, which was shattered by Perkūnas, the god of thunder. Its fragments were said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of the amber that still washes up on the beaches nearby.|$|E
5|$|The Undertaker's {{feud with}} Harvey Wippleman {{escalated}} {{in the following}} months and was featured at two more pay-per-view events in 1993. The Undertaker faced Giant González at WrestleMania IX; González was disqualified after attacking The Undertaker with a chloroform-soaked rag provided by Wippleman. Wippleman and González recruited Mr. Hughes, and the three men attacked The Undertaker and Paul Bearer. They stole The Undertaker's urn, which was said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of his power. The feud culminated in a Rest in Peace match at SummerSlam 1993, which The Undertaker won to end the feud.|$|E
5|$|The {{abundance}} of deuterium in comet Hale–Bopp {{in the form}} of heavy water was found to be about twice that of Earth's oceans. If Hale–Bopp's deuterium abundance is typical of all comets, this implies that although cometary impacts are thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of a significant amount of the water on Earth, they cannot be the only source.|$|E

30|$|The {{concept of}} {{customer}} service quality includes aspects of transport service {{which are not}} always well-defined and easily measured. Herein we define service quality {{in terms of a}} set of attributes which each user perceives <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> of utility (or satisfaction) in bus use. The dimensions of quality, viewed from a bus user’s perspective, are complex. Passengers might, for example, consider the comfort at the bus stop and the time to get a seat, or only the comfort of the seats. Modal choice surveys have identified a large number of influences on the use of buses in contrast to other private and public modes.|$|R
30|$|Large {{domestic}} firms <b>are</b> {{also known}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> of new firm formation. Anecdotes of employees leaving to found their own firms abound. For instance, a trade press {{survey showed that}} at least 270 firms were founded by people leaving just two of India’s largest exporters, Wipro Limited and HCL Technologies ([Vishwanathan 2001]). More recently, NASSCOM’s Vice President <b>was</b> quoted by <b>the</b> [Economic Times (2011]) as having claimed that ‘there are some 1, 600 tech start-ups {{in the country and}} about 80 [*]% of them are being launched by experienced IT employees, working in India and overseas.’ Once again, it is unclear if and how small firms use their previous employers as intermediaries to access global markets.|$|R
5|$|There is {{mounting}} evidence, including Doppler on Wheels mobile radar images and eyewitness accounts, that most tornadoes have a clear, calm center with extremely low pressure, {{akin to the}} eye of tropical cyclones.

5|$|During the Industrial Revolution, Arbroath's economy {{expanded}} {{and the population}} of the town expanded, with new housing having to be constructed to house the influx of workers. Arbroath became moderately well known for jute and sailcloth production, with 34 mills employing 1,400 looms and producing over one million yards of osnaburg cloth and 450,000yards of sailcloth in 1875. Arbroath is believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of the sails used on the Cutty Sark. In 1867, the mills in Arbroath employed 4,620 people. Arbroath was also prominent in the manufacture of shoes and lawnmowers; local firm Alexander Shanks supplied mowers to the Old Course at St Andrews and the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club.|$|E
5|$|Like many mammals, {{elephants}} can {{contract and}} transmit diseases to humans, {{one of which}} is tuberculosis. , tuberculosis appears to be widespread among captive elephants in the US, and because the disease can spread through the air to infect both humans and other animals, it is a public health concern affecting circuses and zoos. In 2012, two elephants in Tete d'Or zoo, Lyon were diagnosed with the disease. Due to the threat of transmitting tuberculosis to other animals or visitors to the zoo, their euthanasia was initially ordered by city authorities but a court later overturned this decision. At an elephant sanctuary in Tennessee, a 54-year-old African elephant was considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of tuberculosis infections among eight workers.|$|E

Later, Mulder digs up Mr. Matthews' casket and finds it filled with roots, his body missing. When Lisa's aunt, Linda, arrives at Karin's house to retrieve her niece, she is attacked and killed by an unseen force as tree branches sway in the wind above her. Karin enters the root cellar, and is revealed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of the male voice Lisa heard earlier, due to her having Dissociative personality disorder brought on by abuse from her own father.|$|E
5|$|O'Connell {{was born}} to {{distinguished}} lawyer Charles O'Connell in 1849 in Ennis, County Clare, Ireland, some {{two years after the}} death of his famed grand-uncle Daniel O'Connell. Young O'Connell attended Belvedere College, a Jesuit school in Dublin, but was called home at the deaths of his mother and sister in a coach accident. This tragic event was later judged <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of O'Connell's sense of the impermanence of the world. After the funeral, he was transferred without enthusiasm to Clongowes Wood College where he studied the classics for three years. O'Connell signed on with the Royal Navy as a midshipman. He travelled around Cape Horn to California in 1868.|$|E
5|$|Struggling to {{rule the}} independent-minded cities of Ionia, the Persians {{appointed}} local tyrants to rule each of them. This would prove <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of much trouble for the Greeks and Persians alike. In 498 BC, supported by troops from Athens and Eretria, the Ionians marched on, captured, and burnt Sardis. However, on their return journey to Ionia, they were followed by Persian troops, and decisively beaten at the Battle of Ephesus. This campaign was the only offensive action taken by the Ionians, who subsequently went on the defensive. The Persians responded in 497 BC with a three-pronged attack aimed at recapturing the outlying areas of the rebellious territory, but {{the spread of the}} revolt to Caria meant the largest army, under Darius, moved there instead. While at first campaigning successfully in Caria, this army was wiped out in an ambush at the Battle of Pedasus. This resulted in a stalemate for the rest of 496 and 495 BC.|$|E

5|$|The Executive {{branch of}} Japan {{is headed by}} the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister {{is the head of}} the Cabinet, and is {{designated}} by the legislative organ, the National Diet.

Explicitly defined <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of executive power, it is in practice, however, mainly exercised by the Prime Minister. The practice of its powers is responsible to the Diet, and as a whole, should the Cabinet lose confidence and support to be in office by the Diet, the Diet may dismiss the Cabinet en masse with a motion of no confidence.|$|E
5|$|The Federation fleet try {{to destroy}} the Kukai base as it appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> of the Song, but Wilhelm—who has been {{secretly}} observing events—arrives with a private fleet that destroys the Gnosis and protects the base. KOS-MOS then uses an advanced weapon to detect the Song's source in a cloaked spaceship. Boarding the spaceship, the group rescue MOMO and fight Albedo, but are stopped by a blue-cloaked man who allows Albedo to escape {{with a piece of}} data extracted from MOMO that could grant access to Miltia. Albedo then summons Proto Merkebah, a research ship created by Mizrahi to summon U-DO, and destroys the Federation fleet before aiming Proto Merkebah's weapons at Second Miltia's capital. The blue-cloaked man—revealed to be a resurrected Virgil—observes events before being summoned away. Shion's group infiltrates Proto Markebah and destroys its core while Albedo flees. Escaping Proto Merkebah as it self-destructs, KOS-MOS shields the damaged Elsa as it enters Second Miltia's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The Oort cloud is a {{hypothetical}} spherical cloud {{of up to}} a trillion icy objects that is thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>source</b> for all long-period comets and to surround the Solar System at roughly 50,000AU (around 1light-year (ly)), and possibly to as far as 100,000AU (1.87ly).

Oort cloud objects move very slowly, and can be perturbed by infrequent events, such as collisions, the gravitational effects of a passing star, or the galactic tide, the tidal force exerted by the Milky Way.|$|E
