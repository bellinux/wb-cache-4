5|$|Heinrich {{also notes}} the {{possibility}} that national parliaments could appoint citizen representatives to the UNPA, similarly to how the U.S. Electoral College officially selects <b>the</b> <b>President.</b> <b>This</b> would be a stopgap solution until direct election became possible. Yet it would still ensure that citizens would be electing citizens (albeit indirectly), rather than the executive appointing officials, to the UNPA.|$|E
5|$|After her release, Sarumpaet {{continued}} {{to participate in}} pro-democracy movements; these actions led to her fleeing Indonesia after hearing rumours {{that she would be}} arrested for dissent. When she returned to Indonesia, Sarumpaet {{continued to}} write politically charged stageplays. She became head of the Jakarta Art Board in 2003; two years later she was approached by UNICEF and asked to write a drama to raise awareness of child trafficking in Southeast Asia. The resulting work served as the foundation for her 2009 feature film debut, Jamila dan Sang Presiden (Jamila and <b>the</b> <b>President).</b> <b>This</b> film was submitted to the 82nd Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film but not nominated. The following year, she released her first novel, Maluku, Kobaran Cintaku (Maluku, Flame of My Love).|$|E
5|$|The {{rights of}} the former presidents are defined by a {{parliamentary}} Act enacted in 2004, during the first term of Stjepan Mesić. Before that act was enacted, the constitution provided that the former presidents shall become members of the Chambers of Counties of the Parliament of Croatia for life, unless otherwise requested by <b>the</b> <b>president.</b> <b>This</b> was never exercised in practice, since Franjo Tuđman died in office and the Chamber of Counties was abolished {{before the end of}} the first term of Stjepan Mesić.|$|E

5|$|In March 2012, the U.S. Senate {{added an}} {{amendment}} to the surface transportation bill that authorized a one-year extension to the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act. Oregon counties would have received a total of $102 million from the legislation in 2012, to be divided among all 33 counties that currently receive payments. In 2008, Oregon received $250 million from the program. The full transportation bill, including the amendment, passed the Senate by a 74–22 vote, but the U.S. House of Representatives refused to vote on the Senate bill, instead passing a three-month extension to the current transportation bill that did not contain a county payments extension. In July 2012, the Secure Rural Schools Act renewal amendment was included in the transportation bill approved by Congress and signed by <b>the</b> <b>President.</b> <b>This</b> was widely expected to be the last renewal of the program, but in September 2013, Congress passed another one-year extension to the program, though again at reduced levels.|$|E

25|$|In the multiparty presidential {{election}} held in November 1992, Zafy placed {{first in the}} first round with about 45% of the vote; Ratsiraka placed second with about 29%. In the second round, held on 10 February 1993, Zafy won the presidency with 66.74% of the vote; he took office in late March. In June 1993, Zafy's supporters won a majority in parliamentary elections. In office, Zafy's rivalry with Prime Minister Francisque Ravony led him to seek increased powers, and in September 1995 a successful referendum was held that substantially increased the powers of <b>the</b> <b>president.</b> <b>This</b> gave him authority over the selection of the prime minister, a decision that was previously {{in the hands of the}} National Assembly; following the referendum, the National Assembly was required to send three names of candidates to the president, from which he could choose.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{economic}} growth and success in diplomatic relations, the government that gained power by coup d'etat was essentially a military regime and the public's support and trust in it was low when the promises for democratic reform never materialized. In the 1985 National Assembly elections, opposition parties won more votes than the government party, clearly indicating that the public wanted a change. Many started to sympathize with the protesting students. The Gwangju Massacre was never forgotten and in January 1987, when a protesting Seoul National University student died under police interrogation, public fury was immense. In April 1987, President Chun made a declaration that measures would be taken to protect the current constitution, instead of reforming it {{to allow for the}} direct election of <b>the</b> <b>president.</b> <b>This</b> announcement consolidated and strengthened the opposition; in June 1987, more than a million students and citizens participated in the nationwide anti-government protests of the June Democracy Movement.|$|E

The subjective test precludes the court from inquiring into the facts and grounds that are relied upon by the executive body in exercising its discretion. It is based on the literal interpretation of the words [...] "f the President is satisfied" [...] that appear in section8 of the ISA, such that no more is required than the subjective satisfaction of <b>the</b> <b>President.</b> <b>This</b> reasoning applies similarly to section10 of the ISA, which requires the Minister's satisfaction for the suspension of detention orders.|$|E

2500|$|On February 20, 1971, NORAD at Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado {{was ready}} to {{broadcast}} a normal required weekly test of the Emergency Broadcast System.

2500|$|In a {{judgment}} delivered on 13 August 2010, Justice Steven Chong dismissed the application, {{ruling that the}} power to grant a pardon lies with the Cabinet and not <b>the</b> <b>President.</b> <b>This</b> is because Article 21(1) of the Singapore Constitution provides that the President, by default, is to act {{in accordance with the}} advice of the Cabinet or a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet, while Article 21(2) lays down an exhaustive range of exceptions from this rule. In situations where the President is empowered to act in his own discretion, the relevant constitutional provisions expressly use the phrase acting in his discretion in reference to the President. However, Article 22P states that the President may grant pardons [...] "on the advice of the Cabinet", which indicates a contrary intention.|$|E
