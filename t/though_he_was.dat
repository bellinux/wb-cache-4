5|$|A poorly educated but {{politically}} astute lawyer, Taylor began {{climbing the}} political ladder by holding local offices {{in his native}} Butler County. <b>Though</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic state, divisions in the majority party resulted in his election as Attorney General of Kentucky on a ticket with the Commonwealth's first Republican governor, William O. Bradley. Four years later, Taylor was elected in 1899 to the governorship.|$|E
5|$|After the British had withdrawn, the Germans reoccupied {{the battery}} position. Steiner {{was unable to}} see Sword from his command bunker, so even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> able to get two of his guns back in action, {{he was unable to}} direct {{accurate}} fire onto the landings. However, observers with the 736th Infantry Regiment, holding out at La Brèche, were able to direct his guns until that position was neutralised.|$|E

His voice was as stern and his face as acid as ever. He said that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> asking for a kindness; but surely no man ever asked for kindness in a voice so peremptory.

A child that is cleanly, agreeable, of good character, well-behaved even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> ignorant is preferable to a child that is rude, unwashed, ill-natured, and yet becoming deeply versed in all the sciences and arts. The {{reason for this is that}} the child who conducts himself well, even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> ignorant, is of benefit to others, while an ill-natured, ill-behaved child is corrupted and harmful to others, even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>be</b> learned. If, however, the child be trained to be both learned and good, the result is light upon light." ...|$|R

Unemployable and sensitive about his bulk, Lambert became a recluse.|$|E
