25|$|Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) {{analysis}} involves {{creating an}} inventory of flows from and to nature for a product system. Inventory flows include inputs of water, energy, and raw materials, and releases to air, land, and water. To develop the inventory, a flow model of the technical system is constructed using data on inputs and outputs. The flow model is typically illustrated with a flow chart that includes the activities <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> assessed in the relevant supply chain and gives {{a clear picture of}} the technical system boundaries. The input and output data needed for the construction of the model are collected for all activities within the system boundary, including from the supply chain (referred to as inputs from the technosphere).|$|E

The names are taken from three pre-determined lists of names, which rotate on a triennial basis, with any names that have been used automatically removed.

That has got to stop. More and more riders...are speaking out and it's the younger generation of riders coming in <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the future of the sport.

2500|$|On {{the morning}} of April 12, an armed crowd rallied under a banner that read [...] "Liberty Freedom For God We Stand". [...] Most had signs, many of which chided [...] "government thugs". Addressing the protesters, Bundy said, [...] "We {{definitely}} don't recognize [...] jurisdiction or authority, his arresting power or policing power in any way" [...] and [...] "We're about {{ready to take the}} country over with force!" [...] After the BLM announced a suspension of the roundup, Bundy suggested blocking a highway. Armed protesters blocked a portion of Interstate 15 for more than two hours, causing traffic backups for three miles in both directions. Protesters also converged at the mouth of Gold Butte, the preserve where the cattle were corralled, and a tense, hour-long standoff ensued. BLM rangers warned over loudspeakers that they were prepared to use tear gas. Former Arizona Sheriff Richard Mack, who was with the protesters, said that they were [...] "strategizing to put all the women up at the front. If they are going to start shooting, it's going to be women <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> televised all across the world getting shot by these rogue federal officers". Protestors with rifles took positions on a highway overpass, seemingly offering cover as horse-mounted wranglers led protesters to face off against heavily equipped BLM rangers and snipers. Utah Lt. Gov. Spencer Cox, who officially traveled to the Bundy standoff to convey that Utah did not want the cattle, put the number of federal agents present at over 200. According to Las Vegas assistant sheriff Joe Lombardo, there were 24 BLM rangers and Las Vegas deputy sheriffs present at the standoff. Las Vegas police were not allowed to wear protective gear because of fear that it would be seen as a provocation. Clark County Sheriff Gillespie blames the escalation of the situation on the BLM, stating to the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the BLM has lied to him about having a place to take the cattle and the BLM did not attend town-hall meetings and disregarded his advice as County Sheriff.|$|E

Senator and statesman, the learned and patriotic, are out, this day, to give their countenance to an edifying, and impressive, and truly American spectacle--the sale of a man! All the preliminaries of the scene are there; dusky-browed mothers, looking with sad eyes while speculators are turning round their children, looking at their teeth, and feeling of their arms; a poor, old, trembling woman, helpless, half blind, whose last child is to be sold, holds on to her bright boy with trembling hands. Husbands and wives, sisters and friends, all soon to be scattered like the chaff of the threshing floor, look sadly on each other with poor nature's last tears; and among them walk briskly, glib, oily politicians, and thriving men of law, letters, and religion, exceedingly sprightly, and in good spirits--for why?--it isn't they <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sold; it's only somebody else.
