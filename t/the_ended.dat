2500|$|On 21 Dec 2012, after {{numerous}} rumors {{on whether}} she had tied the knot 2 months ago, {{in an interview with}} the press, she declared that now it can be said that she is married and has worn a wedding ring for two months. Some paparazzi pointed out that this can be easily recognized when she started wearing a more plain ring which matches the ring on Otto's (her husband) left hand though she may have intended to wear it on her right hand (yet, wearing ring on the right hand is actually a tradition in some Europe countries including the Netherlands). It is also expected that Thu Minh would never hold a big wedding celebration involving the public and the press in Vietnam since she is well known for being quite secretive in her love life. This could be a reason that she may have chosen to celebrate this only with some close friends and families − to avoid the public attention.

Till now, the public only acknowledges her husband's face and he is a Dutch businessman (Her husband's name has recently been revealed as Otto). Her husband appeared on the event she held on 21 December 2012 as an event to introduce her husband and celebrate <b>the</b> <b>ended</b> year 2012.
