For example, an insurance company issues homeowners' policies with limits of up to $500,000 and then buys catastrophe reinsurance of $22,000,000 in excess of $3,000,000. In that case, the insurance company would only recover from reinsurers in the event of multiple policy losses in one event (e.g., hurricane, earthquake, flood).|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} <b>two</b> types of <b>risks,</b> the risk of {{malfunctioning}} of a product quantified by its reliability, {{and the risk of}} misunderstanding the features and qualities of a product while deciding whether to buy it. The later risk is caused by the information asymmetry, which is a natural property of any communication process. We discuss the relationship between these <b>risks</b> and product <b>warranty.</b> We begin with an overview of warranties from the decision-makers' viewpoint. We elaborate on the purposes, legalities, and types of warranties and follow with a summary of mathematical models and concepts for quantifying the financial implications of warranties of malfunctioning. Further, we propose a model for quantifying the risk of misinforming and elaborate on the relationship between this <b>risk</b> and product <b>warranty.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Reliability {{demonstration}} testing {{is not the}} most efficient method of assuring product reliability prior to shipment. It is costly, time consuming and has inherent technical and social limitations. The dilemma facing the reliability and quality engineer is whether to continue {{demonstration testing}} and risk shipping a product late or ship the product and <b>risk</b> <b>warranty</b> and field service returns. Either option can cause the company to lose significant market share and profit. This paper sets out to solve this dilemma by meeting both the time to market constraints and the product reliability goals. The weaknesses of existing reliability demonstration techniques are explored and a comprehensive methodology is introduced involving controlled development processes, stress testing, root cause determination and process change feedback mechanisms. All prototype products are manufactured on the final volume process line resulting in the early identification and correction of processrelated problems. Testing commences on the first available prototypes with system stress/robust testing being employed to stimulate failures, determine their root cause and correct them. Reliability growth modelling assesses the ongoing improvement...|$|R

First, the influences of <b>two</b> <b>risk</b> parameters on medical expenditures are theoretically investigated. The decrease in the time risk, which is interpreted to represent social risks such as medical technology and public health, reduces the expenditure on medical care. The increase in the age risk, which is interpreted to represent individual risks such as aging, increases the expenditure on medical care. Second, the medical expenditures of Japanese one-person households from 1969 to 1994 are estimated. The influences of <b>two</b> <b>risk</b> parameters on the medical expenditures are confirmed as expected, and the gender distinction and the institutional change are also important...|$|R

40|$|Banks often measure {{credit and}} {{interest}} rate risk separately and then add the <b>two</b> <b>risk</b> measures to determine their overall economic capital. This approach misses complex interactions between the <b>two</b> <b>risks.</b> We develop a framework where credit and {{interest rate risk}}s are analysed jointly. We focus on a traditional banking book where all positions are held to maturity and subject to book value accounting.

The analysis suggests that a joint analysis of risks can deliver substantially different results relative to a piece-wise approach: risk integration is challenging but feasible and worthwhile.
