5|$|Federer {{plays with}} a single-handed backhand, which gives him great variety. He employs <b>the</b> <b>slice,</b> {{occasionally}} {{using it to}} lure his opponent to the net and deliver a passing shot. Federer can also fire topspin winners and possesses a 'flick' backhand with which he can generate pace with his wrist; this is usually used to pass the opponent at the net. His serve is difficult to read because he always uses a similar ball toss, regardless of what type of serve {{he is going to}} hit and where he aims to hit it, and turns his back to his opponents during his motion. He is often able to produce big serves on key points during a match. His first serve is typically around 200km/h (125mph); however, he is capable of serving at 220km/h (137mph). Federer is also accomplished at serve and volleying, and employed this tactic frequently in his early career.|$|E

30|$|To {{prepare the}} 3 D lignin slices, {{cellulose}} and hemicellulose {{were removed from}} half of <b>the</b> <b>slices</b> using <b>the</b> method of Terashima and Yoshida [10]. <b>The</b> <b>slices</b> were methylated with diazomethane to prevent the modification of the free phenolic hydroxyl group of the guaiacyl unit in lignin. After dehydrating in ethanol, <b>the</b> <b>slices</b> were placed in diethyl ether. Diazomethane {{was added to the}} ether and <b>the</b> <b>slices</b> were methylated in the dark for 2  weeks. As the yellow color of diazomethane disappeared during methylation, an equivalent amount of diazomethane was added to <b>the</b> <b>slices.</b> Aqueous sodium periodate solution (2.5  M, pH 3.5, 40  mL) was added to <b>the</b> methylated <b>slices,</b> which were then kept at 50  °C in the dark for 24  h. <b>The</b> <b>slices</b> were washed with water and treated with dilute sulfuric acid at 50  °C in the dark for 24  h, and washed with water. For graded polysaccharide removal, periodate oxidation and hydrolysis were repeated four times. After polysaccharide removal, <b>the</b> <b>slices</b> were held between two glass slides to prevent warping during drying at room temperature.|$|R

25|$|Graf {{also had}} a {{powerful}} backhand drive but {{over the course of}} her career tended to use this less frequently, opting more often for an effective backhand slice. Starting in the early 1990s, she used <b>the</b> <b>slice</b> almost exclusively in baseline rallies and mostly limited the topspin backhand to passing shots. Her accuracy with <b>the</b> <b>slice,</b> both cross-court and down the line and her ability to skid the ball and keep it low, enabled her to use it as an offensive weapon to set the ball up for her forehand put-aways. However, Graf admitted in 1995 that she would have preferred having a two-handed backhand in retrospect.|$|E

25|$|Spatial {{resolution}} of an fMRI study refers {{to how well}} it discriminates between nearby locations. It {{is measured by the}} size of voxels, as in MRI. A voxel is a three-dimensional rectangular cuboid, whose dimensions are set by <b>the</b> <b>slice</b> thickness, the area of a slice, and the grid imposed on <b>the</b> <b>slice</b> by the scanning process. Full-brain studies use larger voxels, while those that focus on specific regions of interest typically use smaller sizes. Sizes range from 4 to 5mm to 1mm. Smaller voxels contain fewer neurons on average, incorporate less blood flow, and hence have less signal than larger voxels. Smaller voxels imply longer scanning times, since scanning time directly rises with the number of voxels per slice and the number of slices. This can lead both to discomfort for the subject inside the scanner and to loss of the magnetization signal. A voxel typically contains a few million neurons and tens of billions of synapses, with the actual number depending on voxel size and the area of the brain being imaged.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Although <b>the</b> <b>slicing</b> of {{programs}} {{written in a}} high-level language has been widely studied in the literature, relatively few papers have been published on <b>the</b> <b>slicing</b> of binary executable programs. The lack of existing solutions for the latter is really hard to understand since the application domain for slicing binaries {{is similar to that}} for slicing high-level languages. Furthermore, there are special applications of <b>the</b> <b>slicing</b> {{of programs}} without source code like source code recovery, code transformation and the detection of security critical code fragments. In this paper, in addition to describing the method of interprocedural static slicing of binaries, we discuss how the set of the possible targets of indirect call sites can be reduced by dynamically gathered information. Our evaluation of <b>the</b> <b>slicing</b> method shows that, if indirect function calls are extensively used, both the number of edges in the call graph and the size of <b>the</b> <b>slices</b> can be significantly reduced...|$|R

500|$|While {{choosing}} a composer {{to produce the}} series' music, director Watanabe wanted to choose someone who had [...] "hit a nerve" [...] with him. [...] A fan of drama series, Watanabe {{was struck by a}} piece of music in the medical drama , and found that the series' composer, Suehiro Kenichirō, had also worked on a number of his favorite anime and drama series. [...] After Suehiro was attached to the production, Watanabe gave him three major guidelines: use human voices during the Return by Death sequences; compose the music like he would for a drama or a movie to capture the emotional scenes; and [...] "pull all the stops" [...] for the suspenseful scenes. [...] Additionally, for the first cour, Watanabe asked for music with a [...] "suspenseful" [...] vibe, while requesting music with a [...] "romantic" [...] feel for the second cour. [...] Both Watanabe and Suehiro are fans of Italian composer Ennio Morricone, and Suehiro tried to take inspiration from his works while composing the soundtrack. [...] Watanabe also requested that there be songs that mimicked Hans Zimmer's score from The Dark Knight. [...] While Suehiro used music that wasn't very [...] "anime-ish" [...] during most of the series, he was asked to use more traditional anime music during <b>the</b> <b>slice</b> of life scenes. [...] A number of times during the series, such as in episodes 7 and 15, Watanabe {{made it a point to}} use an entire song, something which is unusual in most anime.|$|E
500|$|Music {{writers have}} also {{characterized}} the album's contents as {{a commentary on}} hip-hop's evolution. As Princeton University professor Imani Perry writes, Illmatic “embodies the entire story of hip-hop, bearing all of its features and gifts. Nas has the raw lyrics of old schoolers, the expert deejaying and artful lyricism of the 1980s, <b>the</b> <b>slice</b> of hood life, and the mythic... The history of hip-hop up to 1994 is embodied in Illmatic.” In the song, [...] "Represent", Nas alludes to the Juice Crew's conflict with Boogie Down Productions, which arose as a dispute over the purported origins of hip hop. Princeton University professor Eddie S. Glaude Jr. claims that this [...] "situates Queensbridge and himself within the formative history of hip-hop culture." [...] The opening skit, 'The Genesis,' also contains an audio sample of the 1983 film, Wild Style, which showcased the work of early hip-hop pioneers such as Grand Master Flash, Fab Five Freddy, and the Rock Steady Crew. After the music of Wild Style is unwittingly rejected {{by one of his}} peers, Nas admonishes his friend about the importance of their musical roots. Kenny Waste suggests that embedded deep within this track [...] "is a complex and subtle exposition on the themes of Illmatic.” Similarly, Professor Adilifu Nama of California State University Northridge writes, “’he use of Wild Style...goes beyond a simple tactic to imbue Illmatic with an aura of old-school authenticity. The sonic vignette comments on the collective memory of the hip hop community and its real, remembered, and even imagined beginning, as well as the pitfalls of assimilation, the importance of history, and the passing of hip-hop's 'age of innocence'.” ...|$|E
