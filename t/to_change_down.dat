50|$|When Want and Aldington {{were sent}} to trial for manslaughter, neither {{attempted}} to excuse themselves because of the poor weather or lack of fogmen, but rather put emphasis {{on the fact that}} the distant signal was at clear. Aldington said when the mail train was approaching Charfield, he was standing behind Want who was keeping his eyes out for signals which both saw as green. Because of this, Aldington assumed the station was clear of traffic and could proceed through to Wickwar. However, error by Button was ruled out in the investigation, since Button's signals would not be able <b>to</b> <b>change</b> the <b>down</b> distant due to the GWR Train occupying the section. The only possibilities were that Aldington and Want did not see the down distant, or that they saw the signal, which had been somehow set to green.

40|$|An {{improved}} readout scheme {{has been}} proposed for high-resolution thermometers, (HRTs) based {{on the use of}} superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) to measure temperature- dependent magnetic susceptibilities. The proposed scheme would eliminate counting ambiguities that arise in the conventional scheme, while maintaining the superior magnetic-flux sensitivity of the conventional scheme. The proposed scheme is expected to be especially beneficial for HRT-based temperature control of multiplexed SQUIDbased bolometer sensor arrays. SQUID-based HRTs have become standard for measuring and controlling temperatures in the sub-nano-Kelvin temperature range in a broad range of low-temperature scientific and engineering applications. A typical SQUIDbased HRT that utilizes the conventional scheme includes a coil wound on a core made of a material that has temperature- dependent magnetic susceptibility in the temperature range of interest. The core and the coil are placed in a DC magnetic field provided either by a permanent magnet or as magnetic flux inside a superconducting outer wall. The aforementioned coil is connected to an input coil of a SQUID. Changes in temperature lead <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> in the susceptibility of the core and <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> in the magnetic flux detected by the SQUID. The SQUID readout instrumentation is capable of measuring magnetic-flux <b>changes</b> that correspond <b>to</b> temperature <b>changes</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> a noise limit. 0. 1 nK/Hz 1 / 2. When the flux exceeds a few fundamental flux units, which typically corresponds to a temperature of. 100 nK, the SQUID is reset. The temperature range can be greatly expanded if the reset events are carefully tracked and counted, either by a computer running appropriate software or by a dedicated piece of hardware...|$|R
