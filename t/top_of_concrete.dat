25|$|The {{elevated}} {{section is}} supported by steel-reinforced concrete columns. The roadway itself was constructed on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> slabs supported by steel girders. The height of the elevated section is higher than required to cross city streets and provide clearance underneath. The intent of this was to reduce traffic noise at ground level. The highest point of the elevated section is the eastbound ramp from the Gardiner to the Don Valley Parkway which goes {{up and over the}} westbound lanes, then drops to ground level. The elevated sections of the Gardiner use a tall wall concrete barrier topped with green metal blades. The blades act to reduce the glare of oncoming headlights from the opposing direction of traffic. During the original construction concrete parapet walls with metal railings were used in the outer sections as well as a divider between west bound and east bound traffic. At grade sections west of Bathurst Street use steel guard rails, but originally featured a narrow grass median.|$|E

The new mast will be a few metres higher than the destroyed one bringing the mast to the same height as before 2006, and will be a steel lattice construction instead of the original tube style. This will prevent the 'chimney effect', and thus safer in case of a fire.

50|$|A {{column that}} carries the load down to a {{foundation}} must have means to transfer the load without overstressing the foundation material. Reinforced concrete and masonry columns are generally built directly on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> foundations. When seated on a concrete foundation, a steel column must have a base plate to spread the load over a larger area, and thereby reduce the bearing pressure. The base plate is a thick, rectangular steel plate usually welded to the bottom end of the column.|$|E
50|$|The 1964 Liberty Bowl was {{the first}} major (University Division) collegiate bowl game played indoors and was also the first indoor {{football}} game broadcast nationwide on U.S. television. Since artificial turf was still in its developmental stages and was unavailable for the game, the hall was equipped with a four-inch-thick grass surface with two inches of burlap underneath it (as padding) on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete.</b> To keep the grass growing, artificial lighting was installed and kept on 24 hours a day. The entire process cost about $16,000. End zones were only eight yards long instead of the usual ten yards.|$|E

50|$|The first {{synthetic}} {{grass was}} placed over concrete in 1964 and {{became known as}} “Chem Grass”. It was later named “Astro Turf” when it was installed in the Houston Astrodome in 1966. Athletes did not like playing on these fields because it was dangerous and not comfortable for their landings. Compared to only {{a thin layer of}} Astro Turf on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete,</b> a new artificial turf was developed in the early 2000s and was called styrene butadiene rubber, most commonly known as “crumb rubber.” This rubber was made of small black crumb pieces that came from old tires. The tire crumbs were poured in between the fake grass blades, giving the artificial fields more cushion and support. This was a better solution and satisfied athletes and aided in the prevention of major injuries.|$|E

50|$|Two {{works were}} then {{recommended}} by the jury to the foundation to be checked {{as to whether they}} could be completed within the price range given. One was designed by a group around the architect Simon Ungers from Hamburg; it consisted of 85x85 meters square of steel girders on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> blocks located on the corners. The names of several extermination camps would be perforated into the girders, so that these would be projected onto objects or people in the area by sunlight. The other winner was a design by Christine Jackob-Marks. Her concept consisted of 100x100 meters large concrete plate, seven meters thick. It would be tilted, rising up to eleven meters and walkable on special paths. The names of the Jewish victims of the Holocaust would be engraved into the concrete, with spaces left empty for those victims whose names remain unknown. Large pieces of debris from Massada, a mountaintop-fortress in Israel, whose Jewish inhabitants killed themselves to avoid being captured or killed by the Roman soldiers rushing in, would be spread over the concrete plate. Other ideas involved a memorial not only to the Jews but to all the victims of Nazism.|$|E

50|$|Sulfates in {{solution}} {{in contact with}} concrete can cause chemical changes to the cement, which can cause significant microstructural effects leading to the weakening of the cement binder (chemical sulfate attack). Sulfate solutions can also cause damage to porous cementitious materials through crystallization and recrystallization (salt attack). Sulfates and sulfites are ubiquitous in the natural environment and are present from many sources, including gypsum (calcium sulfate) often present as an additive in 'blended' cements which include fly ash and other sources of sulfate. With the notable exception of barium sulfate, most sulfates are slightly to highly soluble in water. These include acid rain where sulfur dioxide in the airshed is dissolved in rainfall to produce sulfurous acid. In lightning storms, the dioxide is oxidised to trioxide making the residual sulfuric acid in rainfall even more highly acidic. Local government infrastructure is most commonly corroded by sulfate arising from the oxidation of sulfide which occurs when bacteria (for example in sewer mains) reduce the ever-present hydrogen sulfide gas to a film of sulfide (S-) or bi-sulfide (HS-) ions. This reaction is reversible, both readily oxidising on exposure to air or oxygenated stormwater, to produce sulfite or sulfate ions and acidic hydrogen ions in the reaction HS− + H2O+ O2 -> 2H+ + SO4-. The corrosion often present in the crown (<b>top)</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> sewers is directly attributible to this process - known as crown rot corrosion.|$|E
5000|$|Holt’s {{works of}} art often deal with issues of how people {{perceive}} time and space. The various monumental works she created blend with and complement their environment. Works such as Hydra’s Head do not merely sit in their environments, but are made of the land, stand on it and are created to be harmonious with the land. The pools in this work are at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>concrete</b> tubes imbedded in the ground. The land already at the site surrounds these pools. They reflect the natural landscape, while not disturbing it. Holt thought about human scale {{in relation to the}} works she created. [...] People can interact with the works and become more aware of space, of their own visual perception, and of the order of the universe. Holt’s works incorporate the passage of time and also function to keep time. For example, Annual Ring functions so that when sunlight falls {{through the hole in the}} dome and fits perfectly into a ring on the ground, it is solar noon on the summer solstice. [...] At different times, the sun falls differently on the work and other holes in the dome align with celestial occurrences. Holt has said that she is concerned with making art that not only makes an impact visually, but is also functional and necessary in society, as seen in works like Sky Mound, which serves a dual function as a sculpture and park and it also generates alternative energy.|$|E
