5|$|Gan {{was always}} {{among the first}} to respond to pleas for donations, giving {{thousands}} of dollars to local hospitals. He also helped to pay for coffins <b>to</b> <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> poor. The 1892 annual report of Tan Tock Seng Hospital mentioned that Gan donated a freehold property at Rochor to the hospital. The hospital is still serving the public and came into the international spotlight when it was designated as the sole treatment centre for the SARS epidemic which struck Singapore in 2003.|$|E
5|$|In an {{adjacent}} sector, a short truce <b>to</b> <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> dead {{between the lines}} led to official repercussions; a company commander, Sir Iain Colquhoun of the Scots Guards, was court-martialled for defying standing orders to the contrary. While he was found guilty and reprimanded, the punishment was annulled by General Haig and Colquhoun remained in his position; the official leniency may perhaps have been because he was related to H. H. Asquith, the Prime Minister.|$|E

50|$|Condorcet {{methods have}} a further-reduced {{incentive}} for the compromising strategy, but they have some vulnerability <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>burying</b> strategy. <b>The</b> extent of this vulnerability depends on the particular Condorcet method. Some Condorcet methods arguably reduce <b>the</b> vulnerability <b>to</b> <b>burying</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point where {{it is no longer}} a significant problem. All guaranteed Condorcet methods are vulnerable to the bullet voting strategy, because they violate the later-no-harm criterion.|$|R
5|$|Learning of the {{annihilation}} of his patrol, Ichiki quickly sent forward a company <b>to</b> <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> bodies and followed {{with the rest}} of his troops, marching throughout the night of August 19 and finally halting at 04:30 on August 20 within a few miles of the U.S. Marine positions on the east side of Lunga Point. At this location, he prepared his troops to attack the Allied positions that night.|$|E
5|$|Power {{told the}} police that the letter had been written by Williams and that Williams had tried to burgle Sztaray's house and killed Inspector Walls. According to Power, Williams met with his girlfriendFlorence Seymourafter the murder, and the two decided <b>to</b> <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> gun {{on the beach and}} send a letter to Williams' brother asking for money to return to London, which was then given to Power. Power's motive in coming to the police was that {{he was in love with}} Seymour.|$|E
5|$|The {{kings of}} the first kingdom were buried outside the city; the last ten kings (ending with Irkab-Damu) were buried in Darib, while older kings were buried in a royal {{mausoleum}} located in Binas and only one royal tomb dating to the first kingdom was discovered in Ebla (Hypogeum G4). This first kingdom tomb was probably built {{during the reign of}} the last king and might be an indication of Eblaite adoption of Mesopotamian traditions <b>to</b> <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> kings beneath their royal palaces.|$|E

5|$|After the attack, the Indians torched {{the house}} and left without attacking other dwellings. The next day, Cooley came back <b>to</b> <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> dead; it is unclear who alerted the salvager's team to the attack. After staying at the {{settlement}} for three days, Cooley went to the Cape Florida Lighthouse. One of the missing slaves appeared, reporting that he recognized the assailants as having been acquaintances of the Cooley family. The slave had heard the Indians ascribing the massacre to an act of revenge for Cooley's having failed to obtain the conviction of Chief Alibama's murderers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning on 19 May, Turkish forces {{launched}} an attack against the left flank of the Australian lines, which developed into a major battle along the whole Australian front. The attack was repulsed with heavy losses. The 11th Battalion suffered nine killed and eight wounded, mainly from shrapnel. One Turkish officer and five soldiers surrendered. On 21 May, a truce was declared and a burial party from the 12th Battalion was sent out. However, it was fired at by the Turks {{and as a result}} burial parties were discontinued. A similar truce was declared on 24 May. A line was drawn halfway between the two lines and each side sent out parties <b>to</b> <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> dead and collect equipment.|$|E
5|$|It {{was common}} to leave gifts with the deceased. Both {{men and women}} {{received}} grave goods, even if the corpse was to be burnt on a pyre. A Norseman could also be buried with a loved one or house thrall, or cremated together on a funeral pyre. The amount {{and the value of}} the goods depended on which social group the dead person came from. It was important <b>to</b> <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> dead in the right way so that he could join the afterlife with the same social standing that he had had in life, and to avoid becoming a homeless soul that wandered eternally.|$|E

5|$|Japanese {{losses were}} modest. The British {{assessed}} that two Japanese aircraft {{had been destroyed}} and another three damaged during attacks on airfields at Truk. Damage was also {{believed to have been}} inflicted on the airfields, floating dry dock, oil tanks, other harbour installations and ships that were attacked. Following the operation, Brind assessed that rockets had proven more useful than bombs, and was critical of the gunnery of all the cruisers other than Newfoundland. Members of the Japanese garrison told US Strategic Bombing Survey investigators after the war that the British raid had resulted in practically no damage. The most significant loss was the destruction of part of the garrison's records, which led to a decision <b>to</b> <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> remaining files.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the bottle}} of {{messages}} from the raft, on which Michael, Sawyer, Jin and Walt Lloyd were travelling, washes ashore. Claire and Shannon Rutherford (Maggie Grace) give it to Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), Jin's wife, and she opts <b>to</b> <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> bottle on the beach. In the hatch, Jack and Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) inspect the mysterious concrete barricade blocking {{what appears to be}} a corridor to another section of the bunker. They discover that the barrier is very thick and that the corridor is also blocked on the foundation level. Later, Jack and Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) share a moment of sexual tension when she exits the shower wearing only a towel.|$|E
5|$|Ninety-seven British {{prisoners were}} killed and the Germans forced French civilians <b>to</b> <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> bodies in a shallow mass grave the next day. Despite the German efforts, Private William O'Callaghan had survived and pulled Private Albert Pooley alive from among the bodies in the field. The pair then hid in a pig-sty {{for three days and}} nights, {{surviving}} on raw potatoes and water from puddles before being discovered by the farm's owner, Madame Duquenne-Creton, and her son Victor. The French civilians risked their lives caring for the two men, who were later captured by the Wehrmacht's 251st Infantry Division and transferred to a military hospital.|$|E

All of Kazangap's crucial relatives have been forewarned of his impending death, and it is decided to set off <b>to</b> <b>bury</b> him <b>the</b> next day. To the consternation of his son, Sabitzhan, who is indifferent toward his father's burial, it is decided to travel across the Sarozek to the Ana-Beiit cemetery in order <b>to</b> <b>bury</b> Kazangap. <b>The</b> procession promptly leaves the next morning, and experiences that took place throughout Yedigei's lifetime, as well as various Sarozek legends, are recollected.|$|R
5|$|Nixon {{refused to}} answer further {{questions}} about the Fund, and attention turned to Stevenson's fund, especially as its details became clear. Governor Stevenson's fund, which proved to total $146,000, had been used for such expenditures as Christmas gifts to reporters, dues for private clubs, and to hire an orchestra for a dance his son was hosting. Taking a leaf from Nixon's book, the Democrats {{refused to answer}} questions about the governor's fund. Both parties were eager <b>to</b> <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> matter, and the story died.|$|E
5|$|With no {{easy way}} to cross the river, Castañeda and his men made camp at the highest ground in the area, about 300 yards (300 meters) from the river. Three Texians hurried <b>to</b> <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> cannon, while others {{traveled}} to nearby communities to ask for assistance. By the end of the day, more than 80 men had arrived from Fayette and Columbus. Texian militias generally elected their own leaders, and the men now gathered in Gonzales invoked their right to choose their own captain rather than report to Martin. John Henry Moore of Fayette was elected leader, with Joseph Washington Elliot Wallace and Edward Burleson, both of Columbus, respectively elected second and third in command.|$|E
5|$|By now the beachhead {{had been}} reinforced; the New Zealand Infantry Brigade, the 2nd Light Horse Brigade and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade had all arrived during the day. Communication {{between the two}} sides {{resulted}} in a more formal truce on 24 May. At 07:30 all firing ceased and parties moved out <b>to</b> <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> dead. This lasted until 16:30 when the truce ended and both sides returned to their own lines. Firing recommenced at 16:45. The Turkish commanders now realised just what would be required to capture the beachhead. Instead of trying again they left two of their depleted divisions, the 16th and 19th, to man their lines while the others were withdrawn. The still independent 77th Infantry Regiment also remained behind, in the same position covering the south.|$|E

5|$|On the December 27 {{episode of}} Raw, The Nexus, minus Barrett, {{announced}} {{they were under}} new management and offered <b>to</b> <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> hatchet with Cena, to which he refused. The Nexus attacked Cena, leaving a Nexus armband in the ring during the process. As the group retreated, CM Punk, who had attacked Cena with a steel chair twice the week before, came to the ring to apparently attack Cena, but instead put on the armband left behind to symbolically announce his allegiance with The Nexus, becoming leader the following week by manipulating Barrett's banishment from the group. On the January 17 episode of Raw, Cena returned and faced Punk in a match, which ended in a no contest after Cena was attacked by the debuting Mason Ryan, who later joined The Nexus. Cena competed in the 2011 Royal Rumble match at the pay-per-view, which saw Cena eliminate most of the Nexus members, ending his feud with the stable.|$|E
5|$|The {{retreating}} Hungarian army, {{on its way}} to Transylvania, {{was stopped}} by a blockade; there they decided <b>to</b> <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> 500 cannons and other treasures, so the Moldavians {{would not be able to}} capture them. According to Długosz, Corvinus escaped the Moldavians due to the assistance of another Vlach (Romanian), whom Stephen found and had executed because of treachery. The Moldavian-German Chronicles say that someone named Isaia failed to launch the cavalry attack which would have blocked the path for the Hungarian retreat; for this, he and others were later executed. Around 10,000 Hungarians were said to have been killed; most of the barons escaped with their king. A Hungarian chronicle mentions 7,000 casualties for the Moldavians. This chronicle is disputed though, due to it being the only one mentioning the Moldavian casualties in numbers; and because the Hungarians did not have the opportunity to calculate the numbers of their fallen enemy. The entire conflict, with the Hungarian invasion and retreat, took around forty days.|$|E

The group decides <b>to</b> <b>bury</b> <b>the</b> walker bodies of Hershel's wife and stepson as well as Carol (Melissa McBride)'s daughter Sophia, while burning {{the rest of the}} walkers. They hold a makeshift memorial service for Sophia, but Carol refuses to attend. She falls into a deep depression, going off into the woods to pull up flowers, including a Cherokee Rose that has been a sign of hope for her. Shane finds her and helps return her to the camp, apologizing to her that he had no idea Sophia was in the barn.|$|E
