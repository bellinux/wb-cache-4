5|$|Boisselier {{became the}} {{scientific}} director of Clonaid, an organization founded by Raël {{that sought to}} clone humans, in 1997. That year, Boisselier was interviewed by Le Monde about her role in Clonaid, and she lost her position with Air Liquide after the company learned of <b>this.</b> <b>Air</b> Liquide stated that her termination was due to her holding dual employment, {{and that she was}} strained by her Clonaid service. She filed a lawsuit against Air Liquide, arguing that she was the victim of religious discrimination. Her suit was successful: in 1999, she won a judgment of about US$30,000.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the first}} week, the Luftwaffe had {{achieved}} air supremacy over the battlefields of all the army groups, but was unable to effect <b>this</b> <b>air</b> dominance over the vast expanse of the western Soviet Union. According to the war diaries of the German High Command, the Luftwaffe by 5 July had lost 491 aircraft with 316 more damaged, leaving it with only about 70 percent of the strength it had at the start of the invasion.|$|E
5|$|Daniela Schwarz {{and colleagues}} (2007) {{concluded}} that the bifurcated neural spines of diplodocids and dicraeosaurids enclosed an air sac, {{which would have been}} connected to the lungs as part of the respiratory system. In Dicraeosaurus, <b>this</b> <b>air</b> sac (the so-called supravertebral diverticulum) would have rested on top of the neural arch and filled the entire space between the spines. In Amargasaurus the upper two-thirds of the spines would have been covered by a sheath of keratin, restricting the air sac to the space between the lower one-third of the spines.|$|E

5|$|In {{some species}} of Lepidoptera, a waxy layer is present inside the chorion {{adjacent}} to the vitelline layer which {{is thought to have}} evolved to prevent desiccation. In insects, the chorion has a layer of air-pores in the otherwise solid material which provides very limited capability for respiratory function. In Lepidoptera, the chorion layer above <b>this</b> <b>air</b> pore layer is lamellar with successive sheets of protein arranged in a particular direction and stepped so as to form a helical arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Brereton sent Haynes to Dinjan Airfield in the Indian {{state of}} Assam to {{continue}} his supply-line work under the name Assam-Burma-China Ferry Command, or ABC Ferry Command, with the mission of supplying American forces in China. <b>This</b> <b>air</b> organization was formed to carry supplies over the Hump, the air route replacement for the enemy-held Burma Road. At first, Haynes worked with only two C-47 transports, and was accompanied on some missions by just one P-40 Warhawk fighter flown by the outfit's executive of operations, Colonel Robert Lee Scott, Jr., who had shifted to flying a fighter once HALPRO was canceled. When Burma appeared to be falling to the Japanese, Haynes {{and a handful of}} other airmen of the Chinese National Aviation Corporation and the Royal Air Force flew hundreds of evacuation missions from April to mid-June, bringing some 4,500 passengers westward to safety in India. The American ferry aircraft would typically deliver supplies to China then stop in Burma on the way back to Assam.|$|E
5|$|By about 05:00, Dyck's {{ammunition}} {{supplies were}} running low, and the ZIPRA attackers {{had hit the}} Alamo {{a number of times}} with RPG fire. Nobody inside was killed by these rockets, but when Dyck's dog was wounded, the major flew into a rage and ordered his men to pour more aggressive machine gun fire on the advancing ZIPRA combatants. He requested air support from Brigade HQ {{in the form of a}} Lynx light bomber. The air force turned down the request, but Flight Lieutenant Colin James took off anyway in his Lynx armed with an FN MAG machine gun and SNEB rockets. The ZIPRA cadres concentrated a huge amount of fire on James' aircraft, and hit it several times, but failed to shoot it down; the pilot put in a number of ground attacks before returning to base. He reported afterwards that a bullet had entered through the floor of his cockpit and hit his helmet. The 1RAR officers and men expressed great admiration for James's bravery during <b>this</b> <b>air</b> strike, but his air force superiors were furious that he had gone into the operational area against orders.|$|E

5|$|In November 1941, Schnaufer {{was posted}} to the II. Gruppe of Nachtjagdgeschwader 1 (II./NJG1—2nd {{group of the}} 1st Night Fighter Wing) at the time based at Stade near Hamburg. Here, Schnaufer was {{assigned}} to the 5. Staffel (5./NJG1—5th squadron of 1st Night Fighter Wing). The Bf 110's of II./NJG1 at the time were not equipped with airborne radar such as the Lichtenstein radar. Night fighter intercept tactics had matured since their early beginnings in July 1940, and II. Gruppe had already been credited with 397 victories. Missions against enemy bombers at the time were usually flown by means of ground-controlled interception, although the Luftwaffe was already experimenting with airborne radar. <b>This</b> <b>air</b> defence system, consisting of a series of radar stations with overlapping coverage, layered three deep, was conceived by Generalleutnant (lit. Lieutenant General; equivalent to Major General) Josef Kammhuber and was organised in the so-called Kammhuber Line. Conceptually, the system was based on a combination of ground-based radar stations, search lights and a Jägerleitoffizier (fighter pilot control officer). The Jägerleitoffizier had to vector the airborne night fighter by means of radio communication to a point of visual interception of the illuminated bomber. These interception tactics were referred to as the Himmelbett (canopy bed) procedure.|$|E
5|$|Unternehmen Paula (Undertaking or Operation Paula) is the German codename {{given for}} the Second World War Luftwaffe {{offensive}} operation to destroy the remaining units of the Armée de l'Air (ALA), or French Air Force during the Battle of France in 1940. On 10 May the German armed forces (Wehrmacht) began their invasion of Western Europe. By 3 June, the British Army had withdrawn from Dunkirk and the continent in Operation Dynamo, the Netherlands and Belgium had surrendered {{and most of the}} formations of the French Army were disbanded or destroyed. To complete the defeat of France, the Germans undertook a second phase operation, Fall Rot (Case Red), to conquer the remaining regions. In order to do <b>this,</b> <b>air</b> supremacy was required. The Luftwaffe was ordered to destroy the French Air Forces, while still providing support to the German Army.|$|E
5|$|WWV's 20MHz {{signal was}} used for a unique purpose in 1958: to track the {{disintegration}} of Russian satellite Sputnik I after the craft's onboard electronics failed. Dr. John D. Kraus, a professor at Ohio State University, knew that a meteor entering the upper atmosphere leaves in its wake {{a small amount of}} ionized air. <b>This</b> <b>air</b> reflects a stray radio signal back to Earth, strengthening the signal at the surface for a few seconds. This effect is known as meteor scatter. Dr. Kraus figured that what was left of Sputnik would exhibit the same effect, but on a larger scale. His prediction was correct; WWV's signal was noticeably strengthened for durations lasting over a minute. In addition, the strengthening came from a direction and at a time of day that agreed with predictions of the paths of Sputnik's last orbits. Using this information, Dr. Kraus was able to draw up a complete timeline of Sputnik's disintegration. In particular, he observed that satellites do not fall as one unit; instead, the spacecraft broke up into its component parts as it moved closer to Earth.|$|E
