5|$|Creationists {{argue against}} {{evolution}} {{on the grounds}} that it cannot explain certain non-evolutionary processes, such as abiogenesis, the Big Bang, or the meaning of life. In such instances, evolution is being redefined to refer to the entire history of the universe, and it is argued that if one aspect of the universe is seemingly inexplicable, the entire body of scientific theories must be baseless. At this point, objections leave <b>the</b> <b>arena</b> <b>of</b> evolutionary biology and become general scientific or philosophical disputes.|$|E
5|$|The NBA Finals was {{initially}} structured to harbor a 2–3–2 format until 2013, {{where the first}} two and last two games of the series were played at <b>the</b> <b>arena</b> <b>of</b> the team who earned home-court advantage by having the better record during the regular season. This was then altered, because teams with the home-court advantage went 21–8 in all Finals appearances. The competition is currently structured under a 2–2–1–1–1 format, where {{the first two games}} are played at home for the higher-seeded team, and the following two at the home of the lower-seeded team.

5|$|Justinian entered <b>the</b> <b>arena</b> <b>of</b> ecclesiastical statecraft {{shortly after}} his uncle's {{accession}} in 518, {{and put an end}} to the Acacian schism. Previous Emperors had tried to alleviate theological conflicts by declarations that deemphasized the Council of Chalcedon, which had condemned Monophysitism, which had strongholds in Egypt and Syria, and by tolerating the appointment of Monophysites to church offices. The Popes reacted by severing ties with the Patriarch of Constantinople who supported these policies. Emperors Justin I (and later Justinian himself) rescinded these policies and reestablished the union between Constantinople and Rome. After this, Justinian also felt entitled to settle disputes in papal elections, as he did when he favoured Vigilius and had his rival Silverius deported.|$|E
