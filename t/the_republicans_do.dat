50|$|Democrat Brian Higgins easily {{defeated}} Independence Party candidate Dan Humiston. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not {{put forth}} a candidate, instead cross-endorsing Humiston.|$|R
50|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not field a {{candidate}} against {{her in the}} 1999 election, and she handily defeated her three independent challengers, winning by a 3 to 1 margin.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not run any {{candidates}} for Congress in 1892. The new People's Party {{made its first}} appearance in Florida's congressional elections this year. Robert Bullock (D) of the [...] did not run for renomination.|$|R
50|$|Peter Welch, a Democrat {{representing}} Vermont's sole congressional district, became both <b>the</b> Democratic and <b>Republican</b> {{nominee for}} <b>the</b> House {{when he ran}} for re-election in 2008. Because <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not field any candidate on the primary ballot, Welch won enough write-in votes to win <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> nomination.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>did</b> not field a candidate.|$|R
50|$|After a close {{election}} loss to Fritz Hollings in 1966, <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> {{felt that}} Parker {{might have a}} chance at defeating Hollings by riding Nixon's coattails in the general election. However, <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not provide Parker with the financial resources to compete and he subsequently lost by a bigger margin to Hollings than two years prior.|$|R
2500|$|Despite {{his belief}} that Ulysses S. Grant was not suited for the presidential office and dissatisfaction with Grant's and the party's refusal to endorse his {{comprehensive}} Reconstruction program of [...] "land, education and the ballot", Phillips supported Grant and <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party in <b>the</b> 1868 election. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> pass <b>the</b> Fifteenth Amendment constitutionalizing black suffrage in 1870, but the goal of land redistribution was never realized.|$|R
50|$|On January 24, the National Guard of Lamballe made {{a raid on}} {{the castle}} of GuyoMarch Alerted by a neighbor, La Guyomar hid the marquis at the Gouhandais, a farm, located some hundred meters from <b>the</b> castle. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not {{discover}} anything, but this treatment could not improve the health status of la Rouerie.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> {{candidate}} <b>did</b> {{not see a}} Democratic challenger, as Democratic candidate Bob Evans suspended his campaign.|$|R
5|$|Gingrich {{sought a}} rematch against Flynt in 1976. While <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> {{slightly}} {{better in the}} 1976 House elections than in 1974 nationally, the Democratic candidate in the 1976 presidential election was former Governor of Georgia Jimmy Carter. Carter won {{more than two-thirds of}} the vote in his native Georgia. Gingrich lost his race by 5,100 votes.|$|R
50|$|Byrd easily won re{{election}} in 1976 against Democrat Admiral Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr. He thereby {{became the first}} senator to win election and re-election as an independent. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not run a candidate that year and concentrated on carrying Virginia in the presidential election, which they did by the narrowest of margins, for Gerald R. Ford Jr.|$|R
50|$|Gingrich {{sought a}} rematch against Flynt in 1976.

5000|$|After a {{redistricting}} by the Republican-controlled legislature, the 78th Assembly District boundaries were changed. Pocan was {{succeeded in}} the Assembly by Democrat Brett Hulsey, {{who had previously}} represented the 77th District. (As in the 2010 race, the only serious challenge to the Democratic candidate was a Green candidate, Jonathan Dedering; <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not even field a candidate.) ...|$|R
5|$|As the {{campaign}} progressed, Weaver's message of racial inclusion drew violent protests in the South, as the Greenbackers faced the same obstacles <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> in <b>the</b> face of increasing black disenfranchisement. In the autumn, Weaver campaigned in the North, but the Greenbackers' {{lack of support}} was compounded by Weaver's refusal to run a fusion ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might have combined to outvote <b>the</b> <b>Republicans.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> forces under Líster's command redeployed in {{the morning}} and {{launched}} a counterattack at noon. Close to one-hundred '"Chato" [...] and [...] "Rata fighter planes and two squadrons of Katiuska bombers of <b>the</b> Spanish <b>Republican</b> Air Force had been made available at the Albacete airfield. While the aircraft of the Italian Legionary Air Force were grounded on water-logged airports, <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not have this problem since the Albacete airfield had a concrete strip.|$|R
500|$|While Republicans were discouraged, Democrats were {{energized}} and did {{especially well}} in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and New York. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> maintain their majorities in Congress {{and in the}} major states, except New York. The Cincinnati Gazette contended that the voters were [...] "depressed by the interminable nature of this war, as so far conducted, and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress".|$|R
50|$|The 33 {{seats in}} the United States Senate Class 2 were up for election, plus special Senate {{elections}} in Mississippi and Wyoming. The resignation of Mississippi Senator Trent Lott, {{and the death of}} Wyoming Senator Craig L. Thomas, both Class 1 senators, meant that both of those states' senate seats were up for election. The Democrats won 8 seats while <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not gain a seat.|$|R

50|$|Despite her leaving {{government}} service during this time, Villalpando's political involvement, especially {{in regards to}} bringing more Hispanics into <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party, <b>did</b> not cease.|$|R
25|$|Disappointed by the {{acceptance}} {{on the part}} of the King, Alfonso XIII, of the coup d'état by General Miguel Primo de Rivera on 13 September 1923, Alcalá-Zamora did not collaborate with the new regime. After the departure of the dictator in 1930, he declared himself a republican in a meeting that took place on 13 April in the Apolo theatre of Valencia. He was one of the instigators of the Pact of San Sebastián. The failure of the military uprising (Revolt of Jaca) in Aragon of that same year sent him to prison, as a member of the revolutionary committee, but he left jail after the municipal elections of 12 April 1931. In these elections, although the monarchist candidates won more overall votes than <b>the</b> <b>republicans</b> <b>did,</b> <b>the</b> <b>republicans</b> <b>did</b> so well in the provincial cities that Alfonso soon abandoned power. Without waiting for a fresh election, Alcalá-Zamora put himself at the head of a revolutionary provisional government, becoming the 122nd Prime Minister, which occupied the ministries in Madrid on 14 April and which proclaimed the Second Spanish Republic.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Wyoming <b>Republican</b> Party <b>did</b> {{not release}} the vote totals.|$|R
50|$|On {{the same}} day, the Democratic Party held their Oregon primary and their Kentucky primary, while <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>did</b> not hold any other {{primaries}} on that day.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> {{keep control}} of the major states except New York. Most important, <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> {{retained}} control of the House, in spite of falling from 59% of the seats to just over 46% because of their alliance with the 24 Unionist representatives; the Unionists were a group of disaffected pro-war Democrats who broke with their party during the previous Congress. The voters, editorialized the Cincinnati Gazette, [...] "are depressed by the interminable nature of this war, as so far conducted, and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress.".|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>did</b> not {{nominate}} a candidate. In {{the general}} election, James faced Green Party nominee James Lane and Conservative nominee Robert Maresca {{as well as}} various minor party candidates.|$|R
50|$|In 2013 the RNC {{began an}} {{outreach}} campaign toward American youth and minority voters, after studies showed these groups generally perceived that <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>did</b> {{not care about}} their concerns.|$|R
50|$|Obama and his {{interest}} groups spent $312,869. McCain and {{his interest}} groups spent just $2,264. The Democratic ticket visited the state once, while <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> ticket <b>did</b> not visit at all.|$|R
5000|$|Attorney General Martha Coakley, a Democrat, sought re-election. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not {{formally}} nominate a candidate at their convention nor has any candidate collected enough signatures {{to be on}} the primary ballot. Nevertheless, two late entry candidates, Jim McKenna, and Guy Carbone were seeking to get the nomination if they can receive 10,000 write-in votes. James McKenna received 27,711 certified write-in votes, which was a United States and Massachusetts Electoral record. The ballot then listed Martha Coakley (D) and James McKenna (R) ...|$|R
5000|$|So, again, <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>did</b> not [...] "go wrong." [...] It was rotten {{from the}} start. It {{has never been}} {{anything}} but red. <b>The</b> characterization of <b>Republican</b> states as [...] "red states" [...] is quite appropriate.|$|R
50|$|Like all the High Plains, Norton County is {{overwhelmingly}} <b>Republican.</b> In 1964, <b>the</b> last time <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not carry Kansas’ electoral votes, Norton County was Barry Goldwater’s second-best {{county in the}} state behind Clay County. The last Democrat to reach {{forty percent of the}} county’s vote was Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1936, ironically against Kansas Governor Alf Landon. Roosevelt in 1932 was the last Democrat to carry Norton County, and the only others are Woodrow Wilson (twice) and William Jennings Bryan in his first 1896 campaign.|$|R
25|$|Unlike the Democratic caucus, <b>the</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>does</b> not use voting rounds or have minimum {{requirements}} for {{a percent of}} votes. <b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> version is <b>done</b> with a straw vote of those attending the caucus. This vote is sometimes done by {{a show of hands}} or by dividing themselves into groups according to candidate. However, officially it is done with voters receiving a blank piece of paper with no names on it, and the voter writing a name and placing it in a ballot box.|$|R
5000|$|Long-term {{rivalry between}} the two main factions in Dutch society, <b>the</b> Staatsgezinden (<b>Republicans)</b> and <b>the</b> Prinsgezinden (Royalists or Orangists), sapped the {{strength}} and unity of the country. Johan de Witt and <b>the</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> reign supreme for a time at {{the middle of the}} 17th century (the First Stadtholderless Period) until his overthrow and murder in 1672. Subsequently, William III of Orange became stadtholder. After a stadtholderless era of 22 years, the Orangists regained power, and his first problem was to survive the Franco-Dutch War (with the derivative Third Anglo-Dutch war), when France, England, Münster and Cologne united against this country.|$|R
50|$|On {{the same}} day, Democratic caucuses {{were held in}} Hawaii and {{in the state of}} Washington. <b>The</b> <b>Republican</b> Party <b>did</b> not hold any {{primaries}} that day; their own Alaska caucuses took place on March 1, 2016.|$|R
50|$|The Anti-Masonic state {{convention}} met in August 1830 at Utica, and nominated Assemblyman Francis Granger for governor, and Samuel Stevens, of New York City, for lieutenant governor. <b>The</b> National <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> {{not call}} a convention, {{and supported the}} Anti-Masonic ticket.|$|R
50|$|Although no runoff was needed, {{because of}} the way the new {{election}} law was written, an unopposed runoff was held on December 13. Edwards received 430,095 votes in it, according to figures recorded by the Louisiana Secretary of State's office. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not field a candidate for the election. The law was later rewritten to where the unopposed runoff was not required if a candidate won an outright majority in the primary. This happened in the 1983 election, when Edwards won a third non-consecutive term over Republican incumbent David C. Treen.|$|R
50|$|This {{election}} {{took place}} {{six years after}} Republicans had won {{a net gain of}} eight seats in Senate Class 1 during the elections of 1994. Democrats defeated Republican senators Bill Roth (DE), Spencer Abraham (MI), Rod Grams (MN), John Ashcroft (MO), and Slade Gorton (WA), as well as winning the open seat in Florida. Ashcroft's defeat was noteworthy in that his opponent, Mel Carnahan, had died before the election, but still won. <b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> defeat one incumbent, Chuck Robb (VA), and won an open seat in Nevada.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Republicans</b> <b>did</b> not {{nominate}} {{a candidate}} for Representative to Congress in the June 1857 election, instead pooling their support for G.W. Lawson, a Free Soil Democrat who was running as an independent. While pro-slavery Democrat Joseph Lane was ultimately returned as the Territorial delegate to Congress, voting further down the ticket showed a Republican advance, with Republicans joining with so-called [...] "soft" [...] (free state) Democrats to elect {{about a third of}} the delegates to the constitutional convention and 10 of the 30 members to the Oregon Territorial Legislature.|$|R
