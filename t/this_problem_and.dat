5|$|Gandhi's London {{lifestyle}} {{incorporated the}} values {{he has grown}} up with. When he returned to India in 1891, his outlook was parochial {{and he could not}} make a living as a lawyer. This challenged his belief that practicality and morality necessarily coincided. By moving in 1893 to South Africa he found a solution to <b>this</b> <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> developed the central concepts of his mature philosophy.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{proposals}} {{were made to}} remedy <b>this</b> <b>problem,</b> <b>and</b> in 1865, the mayor of Brussels, Jules Anspach, selected a design by architect Léon Suys to cover the river and build a series of grand boulevards and public buildings. The project faced fierce opposition and controversy, mostly due to its cost {{and the need for}} expropriation and demolition of working-class neighbourhoods. The construction was contracted to a British company, but control was returned to the government following an embezzlement scandal. This delayed the project, but it was still completed in 1871. Its completion allowed the construction of the modern buildings and boulevards which are central to downtown Brussels today.|$|E
5|$|The {{formation}} timescale {{of giant}} planets {{is also an}} important problem. Old theories were unable to explain how their cores could form fast enough to accumulate significant amounts of gas from the quickly disappearing protoplanetary disk. The mean lifetime of the disks, which is less than ten million (107)years, appeared to be shorter than the time necessary for the core formation. Much progress has been done to solve <b>this</b> <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> current models of giant planet formation are now capable of forming Jupiter (or more massive planets) in about 4 million years or less, well within the average lifetime of gaseous disks.|$|E

5|$|In February 2003, the PL {{board of}} {{directors}} agreed to reintroduce a playoff system {{to be used for}} the 2004 NPB season. If a first-place team had a substantial lead in the standings nearing the end of the regular season, there was no pennant (league champion) race and little excitement until the Japan Series began. The decision to add a PL playoff was an attempt to rectify <b>this</b> <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> increase the league's popularity. The new postseason plan initiated a two-stage playoff in which the top three PL teams competed. In the First Stage, the teams that finished the newly shortened, 135-game regular season with the second- and third-best records played each other in a best-of-three series. The winner of this series faced the league's top finisher in the second final stage. The Final Stage winner advanced to the Japan Series, where they competed against the CL's Climax Series champion team.|$|E
5|$|Many {{rock and}} metal fans that became Christians through the {{ministry}} of Christian metal bands were rejected from churches in the 1980s. In 1984, California pastor Bob Beeman saw <b>this</b> <b>problem</b> <b>and</b> soon started the ministry called Sanctuary - The Rock and Roll Refuge. This fellowship brought many musicians together and formed groups such as Tourniquet, Deliverance, Vengeance and Mortal that would soon become ground breaking acts in Christian music culture. Sanctuary's first worship leader was Stryper's vocalist Michael Sweet and later Barren Cross' bass player Jim LaVerde. Sanctuary sponsored the first Christian metal festival, The Metal Mardi Gras, held in 1987 in Los Angeles. This proved influential and soon Christian metal festivals were organized elsewhere as well. Sanctuary's activities began spreading, and it had 36 parishes all over the United States at its peak by the 1990s. The Sanctuary parishes {{had a significant impact}} on the Christian metal movement: groups that would later become notable such as P.O.D. performed their first concerts in Sanctuary.|$|E
5|$|By {{the summer}} of 1922 the {{coalition}} government Birkenhead {{was a member of}} began to splinter, and when it finally collapsed Birkenhead was forced to resign on 25 October 1922. His replacement was Lord Cave, a member of the new Conservative government who was appointed on 27 October 1922. The Conservative government under Stanley Baldwin soon ran into trouble due to his desire to introduce protectionist tariffs to protect British jobs. Baldwin called an early general election in December 1923 to serve as a referendum on the subject, and although the Conservatives remained the largest party they did not have enough Members of Parliament to claim a parliamentary majority. At the opening of the new Parliament in January 1924 the party was defeated in a vote of no confidence, and the king instead invited the Labour Party under Ramsay MacDonald to form a government. This caused various constitutional problems; traditionally every member of a cabinet, including the Prime Minister, must be a Privy Councillor. MacDonald was not a Privy Councillor, and therefore could not be made Prime Minister. The king asked Lord Cave for a way around <b>this</b> <b>problem,</b> <b>and</b> as an expert on constitutional issues Schuster helped draft the response. In the end it was determined that MacDonald would be sworn in as a Privy Councillor and then invited to form a government.|$|E

25|$|Jessop's {{original}} {{designs for}} the harbour included a dam with an 'overfall', {{with the level of}} the water determined by the height of the dam's crest.

25|$|On tilled soil a {{one-piece}} roller has {{the disadvantage}} that when turning corners the outer {{end of the}} roller has to rotate much faster than the inner end, forcing one or both ends to skid.
