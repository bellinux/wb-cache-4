Začeli smo tako, da smo v fazi granuliranja v izdelek vgradili 12 kg purificirane vode pri 80 % hitrosti vbrizgavanja granulirne tekočine. S tem postopkom smo v fazi tabletiranja izdelali tablete, ki so dajale neustrezno trdnost in zadovoljivo razpadnost. Nadaljevali smo z vgradnjo 13 kg purificirane vode pri enaki hitrosti vbrizgavanja granulirne tekočine, vendar smo na ta način izdelali tablete, ki so dajale ustrezno trdnost tablet in neustrezen, daljši čas razpadnosti tablet. V nadaljevanju smo spremljali lastnosti granulata pri vgradnji 13 kg purificirane vode pri 100 % hitrosti vbrizgavanja granulirne tekočine, ki pa je v primerjavi s predhodnimi poizkusi dajal najboljše rezultate. Poizkusi so to tezo potrdili. Glede na rezultate postopkov izdelave smo predpostavili maksimalen čas trajanja mehanske operacije in maksimalen navor mešala v fazi granuliranja. Maksimalnih doseženih mehanskih parametrov pri postopku izdelave zdravila ne smemo prekoračiti. Nato smo želeli ugotoviti vpliv časa mešanja suhega granulata in pomožnih snovi pri pripravi zmesi za tabletiranje na trdnost in razpadnost tablet. Ugotovitve so pokazale, da čas homogenizacije v temu namenjenem mešalniku nima nikakršnega vpliva na trdnost in razpadnost tablet. Vpliv nastavitev tabletirnega stroja na kakovost tablet smo želeli dokazati tako, da smo nastavitve na tabletirnem stroju spreminjali in tako spremljali karakteristične parametre tablet. Rezultati so nam pokazali, da z večanjem sile stiskanja ne dosežemo višje trdnosti tablet in tako tudi predpisanega časa razpadnosti tablet. Po opravljeni raziskavi smo pridobljene rezultate prikazali tabelarično, ki nam bodo v prihodnje v pomoč pri izdelavi tega izdelka. The {{scope of}} this {{dissertation}} is the optimisation of granulation stage of the technological procedure for production of tablets, used for the medical treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. The aim of this optimisation was to achieve the set requirements for hardness and disintegration of tablets in the tabletting stage. Our first experiment started with adding 12 kg of purificated water into the product in the granulation stage by injecting the granular liquid at 80 % of speed. By doing so, we have achieved to produce tablets with corresponding disintegration, {{but they did not}} have the required hardness. In next step we added 13 kg of purificated water with the same injection speed of the granular liquid as in first experiment. In this case the tablets had the required hardness, but the disintegration was not within the set limits. Due to this, we have changed the characteristics of granulate by adding 13 kg of purified water with the injection of granular liquid at 100 % of speed, which in comparison with previous experiments, gave us the best results. The test has confirmed this thesis. With the results obtained by experiments we were able to determine the maximal duration time of mechanical operation and maximal torque of the stirrer in the granulation stage. Determined maximal mechanical parameters should not be exceeded in the production of drug. Afterwards, we intended to establish how the stirring time, of a dry granulate and excipients in the preparation of <b>tabletting</b> <b>mass,</b> influences the hardness and disintegration of tablets. The results showed that time of homogenization in the stirrer does not affect the hardness and disintegration of tablets. We have also tried to demonstrate how the settings of the tabletting machine are affecting the quality of the product. The results showed that by increasing the pressing force, the tablet hardness is not increased tablet hardness and thus the prescribed time of tablet disintegration is not obtained. Finally, the results obtained in present work are summarized and presented in tabular form, wich offers a support for optimization of tablet production. The table demonstrates the influence of control parameters on the product characteristics in the granulation stage...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. Diclofenac sodium is a non-steroidal, {{anti-inflammatory}} drug {{used for}} the relief of pain and inflammation. Many patients have difficulty swallowing tablets and consequently do not take medication as prescribed. To achieve optimum benefit of a drug, it is desirable to present it in a formulation which can rapidly disperse in water. This formulation is easier to swallow, therefore enhancing patient compliance. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a stable diclofenac sodium dispersible tablet for easier oral administration. The first step in the product development was an investigative study into the physico-chemical properties, indications, side-effects and contra-indications of diclofenac sodium. Diclofenac sodium - excipient compatibility studies were performed as part of a preformulation study. Methods of evaluation included differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Four dispersible tablet formulations were developed. Kollidon CL-M (crospovidone) and Disolcel (croscarmellose sodium) were used as disintegrants in concentrations of 2 % and 5 % of the <b>tablet</b> <b>mass.</b> <b>Tabletting</b> was performed using a Cadmach® (India) single-punch tabletting machine. The four formulations were put on accelerated stability according to ICH guidelines for three months at 25 °C/ 60 %RH, 30 °C/ 65 %RH and 40 °C/ 75 %RH. HPLC was used to determine the identification, chromatographic purity and concentration of diclofenac sodium. Other tests included uniformity of mass, hardness, friability, disintegration, fineness of dispersion, loss on drying and dissolution. Thermal compatibility studies revealed potential interactions between diclofenac sodium and the excipients. Since DSC results only serve as a rough indication of possible interactions, accelerated stability testing using HPLC was used as a more selective method to identify potential interactions between diclofenac sodium and excipients. The HPLC results revealed that no interactions exist between diclofenac sodium and the chosen excipients. At the end of the stability period, no change in the physical appearance of the tablets was observed, except for the samples stored at 40 °C/ 75 % RH which showed a colour change from white to a very light brown after 3 months. Uniformity of mass remained within specification and average <b>tablet</b> <b>mass</b> and diameter remained relatively constant during stability testing. There was an increase in average thickness, hardness, disintegration time and percentage loss on drying with time and increased stress conditions. This correlates with the decrease in friability observed with time. Differences in the disintegration times were noted between Kollidon CL-M® and Disolcel® formulations. The only formulation that disintegrated within 3 minutes was formulation B. Very few particles of formulation B were retained on the 710 urn sieve, indicating a homogeneous dispersion. Assay results for all four formulations were within specification throughout stability and no extra peaks ascribed to diclofenac related compound A or any other impurity were observed. After 30 minutes, more than 85 % of diclofenac sodium in formulations A, B and D was dissolved. The diclofenac sodium in formulation C did not dissolve well. This correlates with the slow disintegration times of formulation C's tablets. Dissolution rates of formulations C and D decreased with time and increased stress conditions, with the effect more pronounced in the case of formulation C. It can be concluded from the stability results that 5 % Disolcel® as disintegrant was superior to a 2 % concentration and to Kollidon CL-M® in concentrations of 2 % and 5 % of the <b>tablet</b> <b>mass.</b> Formulation B (5 % Disolcel®) was chosen as the most favourable formulation with the best marketing possibilities. Stability results were also used to determine storage conditions and set specifications for batch release and stability to ensure that all batches tested against these specifications, meet the requirements for quality, safety and efficacy.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to use Ordinal Logistic Regression Modeling (OLRM) to predict and to investigate the relationship(s) between the different types of failures encountered in tableting tools of pharmaceutical industry and relevant tablet- and punch attributes.

The water uptake, the swelling and the erosion during immersion were investigated in drug-free systems, as a preliminary task before to undertake the study of drug-loaded ones. The tablets, obtained by powder compression, were confined between glass slabs to allow water uptake only by lateral surface and then immersed in distilled water at 37 °C, with simultaneous video-recording. By image analysis the normalized light intensity profiles were obtained and taken as a measure of the water mass fraction. The time evolutions of the total <b>tablet</b> <b>mass,</b> of the water mass and of the erosion radius were measured, too. Thus a novel method to measure polymer and water masses during hydration was pointed out.

40|$|This {{research}} {{was performed to}} test the hypothesis that acoustic-resonance spectrometry (ARS) is able to rapidly and accurately differentiate tablets of similar size and shape. The US Food and Drug Administration frequently orders recalls of tablets because of labeling problems (eg, the wrong tablet appears in a bottle). A high-throughput, nondestructive method of online analysis and label comparison before shipping could obviate the need for recall or disposal of a batch of mislabeled drugs, thus saving a company considerable expense and preventing a major safety risk. ARS is accurate and precise as well as inexpensive and nondestructive, and the sensor, is constructed from readily available parts, suggesting utility as a process analytical technology (PAT). To test the classification ability of ARS, 5 common household tablets of similar size and shape were chosen for analysis (aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, vitamin C, and vitamin B 12). The measures of successful tablet identification were intertablet distances in nonparametric multidimensional standard deviations (MSDs) greater than, 3 and intratablet MSDs less than 3, as calculated from an extended bootstrap erroradjusted single sample technique. The average intertablet MSD was 65. 64, while the average intratablet MSD from cross-validation was 1. 91. <b>Tablet</b> <b>mass</b> (r 2 = 0. 977), thickness (r 2 = 0. 977), and density (r 2 = 0. 900) were measured very accurately from the AR spectra, each with less than 10 % error.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the research {{was to develop a}} nutrient-dense and high-energy emergency relief food product based on compression using a single pellet press (experiment 1). The recipe and the production process was developed based on specifications given for compact emergency relief food by IOM (2002). By measuring the physical properties of the tablets after processing, differences or similarities between tablets produced under different conditions were determined. The effect of compression pressure (4 - 338 MPa) and temperature (22, 35, and 50 °C) on the tablets moisture content, water activity, density and tensile strength was studied (experiment 2 a), and the effect of total moisture content in the recipe (6, 2 %, 9, 6 %, and 12, 6 %) and compression temperature (22, 35, and 50 °C) on the end products moisture content, water activity, mass density, strength, water solubility and energy density was studied (experiment 2 b). The results in experiment 2 a showed that the compression pressure did not have a significant effect (p> 0. 05) on the tablets moisture content or water activity, or on density and tensile strength when > 105 MPa. The compression temperature had a significant effect (p < 0. 05) on all response variables. The results in experiment 2 b showed that the moisture content in the recipe and the compression temperature had a significant effect (p < 0. 05) on all research variables. The tablets water content, water activity, mass density and tensile strength increased linearly with increasing compression pressure (R 2 = 0, 94 - 0, 99).

40|$|After {{completion}} of the studies using the PressterTM {{it can be concluded}} that comparative results between PressterTM and rotary tablet presses can be achieved if the compression parameters are correctly set up. Firstly manufacturing of tablets with the same mass is important for the comparison. In addition the studies revealed that tablets need to have the same thickness because otherwise they were differently densified. Thickness is often specified for packaging of tablets being an important parameter for this reason. To achieve the same thickness the same band height needs to be set up on both tableting machines. The PressterTM offers the possibility to measure punch displacement to find out the actual punch gap. If tablet presses are not instrumented only the out-of-die thickness can be measured and the band height can be adjusted accordingly. The set up of two presses to the same compression force is not reliable because the compression force {{is a result of the}} <b>tablet</b> <b>mass</b> and the punch gap and therefore only an indirect parameter. Calibration of the strain gages is complicated and subject to failures e. g. with temperature changes. Recalibration of the PressterTM strain gages using Pfizer Freiburg calibration equipment revealed excellent results. When the experiments were performed using the same resulting compression force, the band height set up on PressterTM partly deviated significantly from the band height set up on a rotary tablet press, leading to differently densified tablets. If materials are compressed to the same thickness different compression forces are produced depending on material and/or batch variability. Thus the height of compression force indicates material properties and compression force variability points out differences in material properties. The experiments of this study confirm that precompression of the tablets is very important regarding the tablet properties. This is even more important if materials show a high tendency to elastic relaxation in order to prevent capping. PressterTM offers the instrumented die as a very useful tool to measure the radial die wall pressure. The mainly directly compressible formulations tested in this study were robust and compressible on PressterTM and rotary tablet presses without any issues. Only at extreme conditions: short dwell time, high main compression force and no precompression force capping occurred with a 90...|$|R

A combined solid dosage form of Paracetamol (500 mg) and Ibuprofen (200 mg) is formulated and tested by analytical parameters. We use Nuromol (Paracetamol 500 mg and Ibuprofen 200 mg; Reckitt Benckiser Healthcare, UK) as a vendor drug for the purpose to cure from mild to moderately severe pain as a new combination dosage regimen in Bangladesh. Initially combined dosage regimen was prepared using six different formulas and formulated drugs are tested for checking all parameters as with supplied reference drugs. The assay is carried out by employing HPLC system with UV detection at 222 nm. There after each formulation had been subjected to preformulation and postformulation studies. The <b>tablet</b> <b>mass</b> is evaluated by assessing various compressional parameter such as angle of repose, bulk density, tapped density, Hausner’s ratio and compressibility index. All the results are met the specifications and this results indicated that this new formulation have good flow properties. Various kinetic models were employed for the application of in vitro release profile assessment. The hardness of the tablet is found 4. 3 to 6 kg, friability of the tablet is found 0. 25 to 0. 63 %, disintegration time for the core tablet and the coated tablet are found 40 seconds and 1. 30 seconds respectively. The results also show that the presence of active components in the formulated tablets are 100. 31 % Paracetamol and 101. 12 % Ibuprofen. We observed the potencies of the Paracetamol are 103. 36 % and 99. 29 % for Ibuprofen. All results of post formulation parameters were according to pharmacopoeias and within acceptable range. Based on fundamental comparative behavior of drug dissolution it can be concluded that release profile of all six batches under investigation was compatible with reference drug.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} work {{focuses on}} attrition of pharmaceutical tablets, {{which is one}} of the problems faced by the pharmaceutical industry during tablet coating operations. The present method used to estimate tablet attrition is the standard USP (United States Pharmacopeia) friability tester. This is merely a “Go or No-Go” test before the coating operation and does not quantify the amount of attrition in a coating process. Modeling tools for predicting the degree of attrition by considering the material properties and process conditions would be helpful to assess attrition during coating processes. The goal of this study is to develop discrete element method (DEM) based models for predicting tablet attrition and to validate them experimentally. ^ Edge chipping and abrasion are identified as the important attrition mechanisms for pharmaceutical tablets. Models have been developed by conducting experiments to measure <b>tablet</b> <b>mass</b> loss due to these attrition mechanisms in terms of measured material properties and loading conditions. Loading conditions were predicted using DEM simulation of tablets in a standard pharmaceutical friability tester and in a simple rotating drum. Since most pharmaceutical tablets are non-spherical, a new class of contact detection algorithms was developed for cylindrical shapes. The contact detection algorithms were verified and validated by analytical and experimental comparisons. By using the combination of DEM simulations, material property measurements and the attrition sub-models, predictions of tablet attrition are made for friability tests and simple rotating drum tests, and validated with mass loss experiments. Experiments, simulations, and analysis indicate that edge chipping is a much more significant attrition mechanism than surface abrasion for coating operations and friability tests. Mass loss due to edge chipping depends on material parameters such as critical stress intensity factor, hardness and particle size, and, process conditions such as impact velocity. ^ Based on the parametric studies in rotating drum simulations, it was found that the attrition of tablets increases with increasing drum speed but is nearly independent of fill level within the rolling regime. Hence, it is advisable to perform tablet coating at lower speeds with fill levels that maintain the rolling regime to reduce attrition while maintaining acceptable mixing performance. ^ System level models like DEM (to predict process conditions), along with material characterization tests (to measure mechanical properties) can be used to evaluate tablet attrition in a more meaningful way than the current standard friability test. The attrition models can provide information about the effects of various material and process parameters on the attrition of pharmaceutical tablets and can suggest methods for reducing attrition. ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: By definition, {{a generic}} product is {{considered}} interchangeable with the innovator brand product. Controversy exists about interchangeability, and attention is predominantly directed to contaminants. In particular for chronic, degenerative {{conditions such as}} in Parkinson's disease (PD) generic substitution remains debated among physicians, patients and pharmacists. The objective {{of this study was}} to compare the pharmaceutical quality of seven generic levodopa/benserazide hydrochloride combination products marketed in Germany with the original product (Madopar(R) / Prolopa(R) 125, Roche, Switzerland) in order to evaluate the potential impact of Madopar(R) generics versus branded products for PD patients and clinicians. METHODS: Madopar(R) / Prolopa(R) 125 tablets and capsules were used as reference material. The generic products tested (all 100 mg/ 25 mg formulations) included four tablet and three capsule formulations. Colour, appearance of powder (capsules), disintegration and dissolution, <b>mass</b> of <b>tablets</b> and fill <b>mass</b> of capsules, content, identity and amounts of impurities were assessed along with standard physical and chemical laboratory tests developed and routinely practiced at Roche facilities. Results were compared to the original "shelf-life" specifications in use by Roche. RESULTS: Each of the seven generic products had one or two parameters outside the specifications. Deviations for the active ingredients ranged from + 8. 4 % (benserazide) to - 7. 6 % (levodopa) in two tablet formulations. Degradation products were measured in marked excess (+ 26. 5 %) in one capsule formulation. Disintegration time and dissolution for levodopa and benserazide hydrochloride at 30 min were within specifications for all seven generic samples analysed, however with some outliers. CONCLUSIONS: Deviations for the active ingredients may go unnoticed by a new user of the generic product, but may entail clinical consequences when switching from original to generic during long-term therapy. Degradation products may pose a safety concern. Our results should prompt caution when prescribing a generic of Madopar(R) /Prolopa(R), and also invite to further investigations in view of a more comprehensive approach, both pharmaceutical and clinical...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, {{manufacturing}} of microirradiators, electrodeposition {{of radioactive}} {{elements such as}} Ni- 63, and applications of these radioactive sources are discussed. Ni- 63 has a half life of 100 years and a low energy beta electron of 67 keV, ideal for low dose low linear energy transfer (LET) research. The main focus of the research is on the novel Ni- 63 microirradiator. It contains {{a small amount of}} total activity of radiation but a large flux, allowing the user to safely handle the microirradiator without extensive shielding. This thesis is divided into nine chapters. Properties of microirradiators and various competing radioactive sources are compared in the introduction (chapter 1). Detailed description of manufacturing Ni- 63 microirradiator using the microelectrode as the starting point is outlined in chapter 2. The microelectrode is a 25 µm in diameter Pt disk sealed in a pulled 1 mm diameter borosilicate capillary tube, as a protruding wire or recessed disk microelectrode. The electrochemically active surface area of each is verified by cyclic voltammetry. Electrodeposition of nickel with a detailed description of formulation of the electrochemical bath in a cold "non-radioactive setting" was optimized by using parameters as defined by pourbaix diagrams, radioactive electroplating of Ni- 63, and incorporation of safety regulations into electrodeposition. Calibration and characterization of the Ni- 63 microirradiators as protruding wire and recessed disk microirradiators is presented in chapter 3. In chapters 4 through 6, applications of the Ni- 63 microirradiators and wire sources are presented. Chapter 4 provides a radiobiological application of the recessed disk microirradiator and a modified flush microirradiator with osteosarcoma cancer cells. Cells were irradiated with 2000 to 1 Bq, and real time observations of DNA double strand breaks were observed. A novel benchtop detection system for the microirradiators is presented in chapter 5. Ni- 63 is most commonly measured by liquid scintillation counters, which are expensive and not easily accessible within a benchtop setting. Results show liquid scintillation measurements overestimates the amount of radiation coming from the recessed disk. A novel 10 µCi Ni- 63 electrochemically deposited wire acting as an ambient chemical ionization source for pharmaceutical <b>tablets</b> in <b>mass</b> spectrometry is in chapter 6. Typically, larger radioactive sources (15 mCi) of Ni- 63 have been used in an ambient ionization scenario. Additionally, this is the first application of using Ni- 63 to ionize in atmosphere pharmaceutical tablets, leading to a possible field portable device. In the last chapters, chapters 7 through 8, previous microirradiator experiments and future work are summarized. Chapter 7 illustrates the prototype of the electrochemically deposited microirradiator, the Te- 125 microirradiator. In conjunction with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Te- 125 m is a low dose x-ray emitting element determined to be the best first prototype of an electrochemically deposited microirradiator. Manufacturing, characterization, and experiments that were not successful leading {{to the development of the}} Ni- 63 microirradiator are discussed. In chapter 8, future work is entailed in continuing on with this thesis project. The work presented in the thesis is concluded in chapter 9. Ph. D.
