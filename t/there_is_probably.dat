5|$|Hans Asperger {{described}} common symptoms {{among his}} patients' family members, especially fathers, and research supports this observation and suggests a genetic contribution to Asperger syndrome. Although no specific gene {{has yet been}} identified, multiple factors are believed {{to play a role}} in the expression of autism, given the phenotypic variability seen in children with AS. Evidence for a genetic link is the tendency for AS to run in families and an observed higher incidence of family members who have behavioral symptoms similar to AS but in a more limited form (for example, slight difficulties with social interaction, language, or reading). Most behavioral genetic research suggests that all autism spectrum disorders have shared genetic mechanisms, but AS may have a stronger genetic component than autism. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> a common group of genes where particular alleles render an individual vulnerable to developing AS; if this is the case, the particular combination of alleles would determine the severity and symptoms for each individual with AS.|$|E
5|$|Procellariids display {{high levels}} of philopatry, exhibiting both natal philopatry and site fidelity. Natal philopatry, the {{tendency}} of a bird to breed close to where it hatched, is strong among all the Procellariiformes. The evidence for natal philopatry comes from several sources, {{not the least of}} which is the existence of several procellariid species that are endemic to a single island. The study of mitochondrial DNA also provides evidence of restricted gene flow between different colonies, and has been used to show philopatry in fairy prions. Bird ringing also provides compelling evidence of philopatry; a study of Cory's shearwaters nesting near Corsica found that of nine out of 61 male chicks that returned to breed at their natal colony actually bred in the burrow they were raised in. This tendency towards philopatry is stronger in some species than others, and several species readily prospect potential new colony sites and colonise them. It is hypothesised that there is a cost to dispersing to a new site, the chance of not finding a mate of the same species, that selects against it for rarer species, whereas <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> an advantage to dispersal for species that have colony sites that change dramatically during periods of glacial advance or retreat. There are also differences in the tendency to disperse based on sex, with females being more likely to breed away from the natal site.|$|E

25|$|Jupiter's {{ring system}} is formed by dust kicked up as interplanetary meteoroids smash into the planet's four small inner moons. The {{outermost}} ring is actually two rings, one embedded with the other. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> a separate ring along Amalthea's orbit, as well.|$|E
25|$|According to Ronald Binns, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> no one {{explanation}} of the monster. A wide range of natural phenomena have been hypothesised, including otters, swimming deer, and unusual waves. Binns wrote that an aspect of human psychology {{is the ability of}} the eye to see what it wants, and expects, to see.|$|E
25|$|It {{is poorly}} {{understood}} how ANCA are developed, although several hypotheses have been suggested. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> a genetic contribution, particularly in genes controlling {{the level of}} immune response – although genetic susceptibility {{is likely to be}} linked to an environmental factor, some possible factors including vaccination or exposure to silicates. Two possible mechanisms of ANCA development are postulated, although neither of these theories answers the question of how the different ANCA specificities are developed, and there is much research still being undertaken on the development of ANCA.|$|E

25|$|During the Renaissance, the {{development}} of mathematics and of accounting were intertwined. While {{there is no direct}} relationship between algebra and accounting, the teaching of the subjects and the books published often intended for the children of merchants who were sent to reckoning schools (in Flanders and Germany) or abacus schools (known as abbaco in Italy), where they learned the skills useful for trade and commerce. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> no need for algebra in performing bookkeeping operations, but for complex bartering operations or the calculation of compound interest, a basic knowledge of arithmetic was mandatory and knowledge of algebra was very useful.|$|E
25|$|A growing {{differentiation}} {{in terms}} of wealth that is visible among settlements sites but especially among burials, indicates the development of social hierarchies. This {{is illustrated by the}} discovery, in 2005, of the burial of a 2-year old child near the Heuneburg, accompanied by imported (Etruscan) jewellery. It is clear that a young child could not have earned or gained such wealth, hence the individual must have been born rich. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> also an element of political centralisation involved in these processes. The fact that the Heuneburg and Aussensiedlung were not able to locally produce enough food to support their own populations implied quite clearly that they must have been able to receive and maintain the support of a much larger surrounding area.|$|E
25|$|Although {{antiretroviral}} {{therapy has}} helped {{to improve the quality}} of life of people living with HIV, there is still a need to explore other ways to further address the disease burden. One such potential strategy that was investigated was to add interleukin 2 as an adjunct to antiretroviral therapy for adults with HIV. A Cochrane review included 25 randomized controlled trials that were conducted across six countries. The researchers found that interleukin 2 increases the CD4 immune cells, but does not make a difference in terms of death and incidence of other infections. Furthermore, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> an increase in side-effects with interleukin 2. The findings of this review do not support the use of interleukin 2 as an add-on treatment to antiretroviral therapy for adults with HIV.|$|E

25|$|The State Circle Shale {{was named}} by Öpik in 1958. It {{is named after}} the street where it was described. Its age is Llandoverian. Its {{lithology}} is shale, mudstone, siltstone and minor sandstone. In the type location there is about 60metres of non-calcareous sandy shale and dark grey shale with beds of fine-grained sandstone. Between Kings Avenue and Commonwealth Avenue, {{there is a good}} outcrop on State Circle, consisting of buff-coloured laminated siltstone and shale with fine sandstone beds contorted by slumping. Its top is an unconformity, with Camp Hill Sandstone lying on top. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> up to 200 metres thickness of this shale. The shale was deposited in the deep sea as turbidites. It can be found in Yarralumla, Parkes, Acton, north and south of Black Mountain, and from Lawson, to Crace and Ngunnawal.|$|E
25|$|The {{statutes}} {{limited the}} master's absence {{to a month}} in every quarter. This would interfere with Preston's preaching at Lincoln's Inn. His ingenuity found out evasions to which the fellows consented; the statutes condoned absence in case of 'violent detention ' and of 'college business'; a 'moral violence ' was held to satisfy the former condition, and a suit at law about a college living, which lasted some years, formed a colourable pretext for alleging college business. But Preston was inflexible {{on the point of}} vacating fellowships. In 1623 he was made D.D. by royal mandate. According to Ball, he had been selected by Buckingham to accompany Arthur Chichester, 1st Baron Chichester, on a projected embassy to Germany, and was, on this occasion, made D.D. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> some confusion here: Chichester's actual expedition to the palatinate was in May–September 1622.|$|E
500|$|Although compact in size, the Jutland is a strong, {{powerful}} {{horse that}} was used to transport carriages and heavy goods. An 1897 publication by the United States Bureau of Foreign Commerce noted the ability of the horse to pull carriages and stated, [...] "For this class of work and for heavy draft generally <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> no better animal than the Jutland horse—a heavy, powerful beast." ...|$|E

500|$|On August 13, 1882, {{the first}} {{passenger}} train {{passed through the}} Black Canyon. The editor of the Gunnison Review-Press rode {{in one of the}} observation cars; he remarked that the canyon was [...] "undoubtedly the largest and most rugged canyon in the world traversed by the iron horse. We had often heard of the scenery of this canyon, but no one can have the faintest conception of its grandeur and magnificence until they have made a trip through it. It is a narrow gorge with walls of granite rising in some places to a height of thousands of feet…Throughout its entire length <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> not {{a quarter of a mile}} of straight track on it. It is a serpentine road in every respect and the curves are frequent and sharp. In hundreds of places the walls of granite are perpendicular and in many places the road bed is blasted out in the side of the walls of rock which overhang the track." [...] He went on to proclaim, [...] "Another such a feat of railroad engineering probably can not be found in the world, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> no section of Colorado or of the whole country where such a varied and interesting lot of scenery can be found." ...|$|E
500|$|Both Oelrichs and Sheldon urged Barrymore {{to take on}} {{his next}} role, Fedya Vasilyevich Protasov, in Leo Tolstoy's play Redemption at the Plymouth Theatre. The critic for The New York Times felt that, {{although}} Barrymore's performance was [...] "marred by vocal monotony", overall the performance was [...] "a distinct step forward in Mr. Barrymore's artistic development... <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> not another actor on our stage who has a temperament so fine and spiritual, an art so flexible and sure." [...] In 1918, Barrymore starred in the romantic comedy film On the Quiet; the Iowa City Press-Citizen considered the film superior to the original Broadway performance.|$|E
500|$|Before the race, {{there were}} no clear favourites for the gold medal. In a preview written on the ITU website, Merryn Sherwood {{identified}} Jenkins, Moffatt, Densham, Spirig and Andrea Hewitt (New Zealand) as favourites. She wrote that she expected Lucy Hall (Great Britain), Hewitt and Densham to be strong on the swim leg {{along with a few}} other athletes. Sherwood thought that if that there was a large group of athletes together on the run then many of the competitors would fancy their chances at winning. Sherwood wrote, [...] "Most importantly every athlete will be going into the race knowing they have a chance." [...] Sherwood's thoughts were similar to those of New Zealander Kate McIlroy who said, [...] "It’s funny, the women’s race seems at the moment <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> 25 girls that could win it on the day." [...] On the website Triathlete Courtney Baird said that the race favourites were Paula Findlay (Canada), Jenkins, Hewitt and Densham.|$|E

500|$|The oldest known wild Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} lived {{more than}} two decades; it {{was found dead in}} Denmark 20years and 3months after having been ringed. The typical lifespan is four years. Data analysis by the British Trust for Ornithology shows that the proportion of juveniles surviving their first year of life is 34%; adult survival from one year to the next is 69%. Birds in their first year of life weigh less than adults, and are especially light in the first two months after reaching independence. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> high mortality, especially for young males, during this time. A study in southern Scotland suggested that the greater mortality in young male birds may be due to their smaller size and the smaller size of their prey, which means that they can [...] "last less long between meals." [...] Their size also means that their range of prey is restricted. It has been estimated that a female Eurasian sparrowhawk of average weight could survive for seven days without feeding – three days longer than a male of average weight.|$|E
500|$|Even without {{gravitational}} evidence, Mike Brown, the discoverer of Sedna, {{has argued}} that Sedna's 12,000-year orbit means that probability alone suggests that an Earth-sized object exists beyond Neptune. Sedna's orbit is so eccentric that it spends {{only a small fraction}} of its orbital period near the Sun, where it can be easily observed. This means that unless its discovery was a freak accident, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> a substantial population of objects roughly Sedna's diameter yet to be observed in its orbital region. Mike Brown noted that [...] "Sedna is about three-quarters the size of Pluto. If there are sixty objects three-quarters the size of Pluto [...] then there are probably forty objects the size of Pluto...If there are forty objects the size of Pluto, then there are probably ten that are twice the size of Pluto. There are probably three or four that are three times the size of Pluto, and the biggest of these objects... is probably the size of Mars or the size of the Earth." [...] However, he notes that, should such an object be found, even though it might approach Earth in size, it would still be a dwarf planet by the current definition, because it would not have cleared its neighbourhood sufficiently.|$|E
500|$|The {{population}} {{at the core}} of the Yellowstone cutthroat trout's native range, in Yellowstone Lake, declined significantly in the 1960s due to overharvest of mature cutthroat trout by anglers, as well as overharvesting of eggs by hatcheries in the early 20th century. Managers implemented catch and release, which required anglers to return their catches to the lake, and they terminated hatchery operations in the park which allowed the cutthroat trout to recover. Then, in 1994, park officials discovered lake trout [...] in Yellowstone Lake. Although lake trout were established in Shoshone, Lewis and Heart lakes in the Snake River drainage from U.S. government stocking operations in 1890, they were never officially introduced into the Yellowstone River drainage and their presence <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>probably</b> the result of accidental or illegal introductions. By 2000, the cutthroat trout population had declined to less than 10percent of its early 20th century abundance. However, aggressive lake trout eradication programs have killed over one million lake trout since 1996, and the hope is that this will lead to a restoration of cutthroat numbers. Cutthroat trout co-exist with lake trout in Heart Lake, an isolated back-country lake at the head of the Heart River that gets little angling pressure.|$|E
