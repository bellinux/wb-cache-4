5000|$|For {{many years}} since its {{cancellation}} {{the show has}} been the subject of an unusual urban legend involving a 17th unaired episode. The episode, entitled [...] "Lenny's Bicycle Built For Two", guest starred legendary Boston comedy personality Rob Marco Jr. in the role of Lenny's nephew, and the late Gordon Jump reprising his role as the bicycle shop owner from Diff'rent Strokes. The plot was rumored to involve a drunk Lenny accidently leaving Rob behind at the bicycle shop. When Lenny sobers up he returns to the shop to find Rob has been molested repeatedly by the shop owner. Lenny then beats the shop owner to death with a bicycle pump, and (in a fit of bloodlust) beats Rob to death as well. ABC deemed the episode [...] "too extreme" [...] for tv and the censors refused to air it. It's believed that copies of the episode were destroyed, save one that is believed to be in the possession of tape <b>tarder</b> John McAdam. When asked about the episode on an infomercial for dietary fiber supplements, Lenny claimed to have no recollection of shooting it, adding [...] "I used a lot of hallucinogenic drugs back then." [...] To date the episode has never been seen publicly.|$|E
