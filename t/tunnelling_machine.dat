50|$|The Heysen Tunnels are twin tube road tunnels which {{carry the}} South Eastern Freeway under Eagle On The Hill in the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia. The tunnels were {{excavated}} using a <b>tunnelling</b> <b>machine</b> normally used in heavy-duty mining operations which tunnelled through 500 metres of rock for each tunnel {{at an average}} rate of 3 metres per day. The tunnels were completed in 1998 and officially opened in May 2000. Each tunnel carries 3 lanes of traffic. On average, they carry a total of 45,700 vehicles per day. The maximum height of vehicles permitted in the tunnels is 5.3 m, {{the same as the}} Crafers and Mt Osmond interchanges.

The Mole is carried to rescue sites on its trolley, then tilts to commence drilling. Caterpillar tracks on both sides enable it to return to the surface. The vehicle is often carried in Pod 5, and is notable for being one of the few pod vehicles to appear in multiple episodes; it also appears in the closing credit sequence with the five main Thunderbirds machines and FAB1. It appears in [...] "Pit of Peril", [...] "City of Fire" [...] and [...] "The Duchess Assignment", and is glimpsed in the pod vehicle bay in [...] "Cry Wolf". It is generally regarded as the most popular Thunderbird machine after Thunderbird 4 and has had more replicas made than any other pod vehicle.|$|E

Conventional {{control of}} <b>tunnel</b> boring <b>machine</b> can't achieve the ideal effect {{because of the}} {{complexity}} of its work process, uncertainty of construction environment. In order to solve the question, the intelligent control is expected. The neural network control has many characteristics such as self-adaption, self-organization, and can modify the corresponding parameters by learning about external knowledge, so it becomes research focus of <b>tunnel</b> boring <b>machine</b> control system in recent years. In this paper the advantage and disadvantage of several kinds of neural network used in the <b>tunnel</b> boring <b>machine</b> control are introduced, the development trends of <b>tunnel</b> boring <b>machine</b> control is predicted...|$|R

Implementations using a d. c. blocking circuit in the rate feedback channel of ther N. C.

40|$|The {{research}} {{was carried out}} during the bentonite shield tunnel drive for the Acton Grange trunk outfall sewer at Warrington, Cheshire. This tunnel is driven through cohesionless Drift deposits beneath a built-up urban environment, with a cover of less than 6 m. The environmental effects of the ground vibration caused by the excavation process are investigated with particular regard to ground settlement by compaction. The geology of the area and the technical and commercial factors {{which led to the}} choice of the bentonite tunnelling system are described. Previous work on compaction by vibration is critically reviewed and methods to assess a soil's potential for compaction are given. The vibration instrumentation is described and relevant wave propagation theory is developed with emphasis on body waves from underground sources. Vibration data were recorded from transducers located in boreholes, on the pavement surface, on the <b>tunnelling</b> <b>machine</b> and on the concrete tunnel lining. These records were processed to characterise the vibrations in terms of peak particle velocities, frequency spectra and spatial attenuation. The maximum measured ground vibration (expressed in terms of resultant peak particle velocity) was 3. 90 mm/s. The vibration was characterised by random high velocity particle motions resulting from impacts between the machine's disc cutters and glacial boulders in the tunnel face. Surface and subsurface settlement measurements were made along the tunnel line and structural damage to property above the tunnel was observed. Laboratory tests and other field data showed that the ground in this area was likely to settle at levels of vibration lower than those measured from the <b>tunnelling</b> <b>machine.</b> The vibration caused by the excavation process caused ground compaction which contributed to ground settlement and the ensuing damage to the overlying structures. The vibration was not likely to have damaged these properties directly but did cause considerable nuisance to the residents...|$|E
