5|$|How the Scots Invented the Modern World: The True Story of How Western Europe's Poorest Nation Created Our World & Everything in It (or The Scottish Enlightenment: The Scots {{invention}} of the Modern World) is a non-fiction book written by American historian Arthur Herman. The book examines {{the origins of the}} Scottish Enlightenment and what impact it had on the modern world. Following <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Man</b> approach, Herman focuses on individuals and presents their biographies {{in the context of their}} individual fields and also in terms of the theme of Scottish contributions to the world.|$|E

Against Ceylon in 1933, he took a famous hattrick, the first in Chepauk. This came in his eighth over when he took wickets with his first, third, fourth and fifth balls, hitting the middle stump each time.|$|E

500|$|Herman {{wrote the}} book for an American {{audience}} which {{may not have been}} very familiar with Scottish history. He provides a historical overview and short biographies of the most prominent Scots. The historical approach uses <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Man</b> Theory, that a historical narrative can be told through the lives of a few prominent figures. Regarding this approach Michael Lynch of The Globe and Mail wrote, the biographies [...] "reveal subtle but important links between these figures and their ideas, which Herman seeks to characterize, with some success, as a coherent body of distinctively 'Scottish' thought." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{historian}} Bartolomé Mitre wrote Historia de Belgrano y de la Independencia Argentina (...) , whose scope expanded on {{the simple}} biography of Belgrano himself, and detailed instead the Argentine War of Independence as a whole. The work followed <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Man</b> theory, linking the {{success in the}} war of independence to the figure of Belgrano and his natal Buenos Aires. This book included as well the autobiography of Belgrano, which was discovered by Mitre. The book was criticised by contemporary Argentine authors, such as Dalmacio Vélez Sarsfield and Juan Bautista Alberdi, born in other provinces, and Vicente Fidel López. Vélez Sarsfield dismissed <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Man</b> theory and maintained that the work of the other provinces for the Argentine independence was as important as that of Buenos Aires. He criticised the work of Mitre at [...] "Rectificaciones históricas: General Belgrano, General Güemes" [...] (Historical rectifications: General Belgrano, General Güemes) which dealt with Martín Miguel de Güemes as well, and Mitre would answer at [...] "Estudios históricos sobre la Revolución de Mayo: Belgrano y Güemes" [...] (Historical studies about the May Revolution: Belgrano and Güemes). Both books were written in 1864. Vicente López provided a biography of Belgrano from a different angle, his book was [...] "Debate histórico, refutaciones a las comprobaciones históricas sobre la Historia de Belgrano" [...] (Historical debate, rebuttals to the historical checkings about the history of Belgrano), and Mitre replied with [...] "Nuevas comprobaciones sobre historia argentina" [...] (New checkings about the history of Argentina). López considered history as an art form, and Mitre considered it a science, rejecting historical narrations that could not be backed by primary sources. These disputes about Belgrano are considered the starting point of the Historiography of Argentina. Historiographical studies of Manuel Belgrano are currently held by the Belgranian National Institute.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the NBC series, Barrymore {{had been}} reliable, sober and responsible, and the studios reacted {{positively}} with offers of work. This led to appearances in nine films in 1937 and 1938, including as Colonel Nielson in three Bulldog Drummond films, and roles in True Confession and Marie Antoinette. He was offered predominantly supporting roles, but he worked conscientiously on the films {{and as a}} consequence was able to honor his debts. His memory was still problematic, and he used cue cards as an aid; his fellow actors and the directors of the films were sympathetic to his condition. When he filmed his last serious role, Gregory Vance in the 1939 film <b>The</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Man</b> Votes, the director, Garson Kanin, ensured that the cast and crew addressed him as [...] "Mr. Barrymore" [...] as a mark of respect.|$|E

500|$|Wisden {{describes}} {{how in the}} first innings, Agnew's accuracy was affected by debutant nerves, but an improved display in the second innings resulted in figures of 2–51. Agnew {{describes how}} Ian Botham helped him secure both wickets, catching Gordon Greenidge in the slips, and passing on some {{advice on how to}} dismiss Viv Richards, Botham's great friend: [...] "Botham said: 'Right. Don't pitch a single ball up at him. Have two men back for the hook, and bowl short every ball.' This I did for three overs or so, by which time Viv was looking a little exasperated, but was definitely on the back foot. Finally I pitched one up, <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>man</b> missed it and umpire David Constant ruled that Richards was LBW for 15." [...] Wisden called the pair of batsmen Agnew's [...] "first illustrious victims in Test cricket".|$|E
500|$|Nurmi's {{achievements}} and training methods inspired future track stars of many generations. Emil Zátopek chanted [...] "I am Nurmi! I am Nurmi!" [...] when he {{trained as a}} child, and based his training system on what {{he was able to}} find out about Nurmi's methods. Lasse Virén idolized Nurmi and was scheduled to meet {{him for the first time}} on the day that Nurmi died. Hicham El Guerrouj was inspired to become a runner so that he could [...] "repeat the achievements of <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>man</b> of whom his grandfather spoke." [...] He became the first man after Nurmi to win the 1500 m and the 5000 m at the same Games. Nurmi's influence stretched further than running on the Olympic arena. At the 1928 Olympics, Kazimierz Wierzyński won the lyric gold medal with his poem Olympic Laurel that included a verse on Nurmi. In 1936, Ludwig Stubbendorf and his horse Nurmi won the individual and team gold medals in eventing.|$|E
500|$|Its cinematography, lighting, and {{flashback}} structure influenced such film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s as The Killers, Keeper of the Flame, Caught, <b>The</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Man</b> and This Gun for Hire. David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson {{have written}} that [...] "For {{over a decade}} thereafter American films displayed exaggerated foregrounds and somber lighting, enhanced by long takes and exaggerated camera movements." [...] However, by the 1960s filmmakers such as those from the French New Wave and Cinéma vérité movements favored [...] "flatter, more shallow images with softer focus" [...] and Citizen Kanes style became less fashionable. American filmmakers in the 1970s combined these two approaches by using long takes, rapid cutting, deep focus and telephoto shots all at once. Its use of long takes influenced films such as The Asphalt Jungle, and its use of deep focus cinematography influenced Gun Crazy, The Whip Hand, The Devil's General and Justice Is Done. The flashback structure in which different characters have conflicting versions of past events influenced La commare secca and Man of Marble.|$|E
