5|$|Next, {{the finals}} of The 2007 Fight for the Right Tournament were held between Christian Cage and Kaz in a ladder match that lasted 15 minutes and 13 seconds. In a ladder match, an object is hung above {{the ring and}} the first to climb a ladder and {{retrieve}} the object is the winner. During the match, Cage was legitimately busted open above his eye. Midway through the encounter, the contract fell off <b>the</b> <b>clipboard</b> that hung above the ring, which changed the objective to just grabbing <b>the</b> <b>clipboard</b> to win. Kaz won the contest after causing Cage to fall off the ladder onto Styles and Tomko, who were interfering on Cage's behalf, and then ascending the ladder to grab <b>the</b> <b>clipboard,</b> becoming number one contender to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in the process.|$|E
5|$|Henry finds a {{backpack}} and disposable camera {{belonging to a}} boy named Brian Goodwin, who Delilah explains {{was the son of}} Ned (Mac Brandt), a fellow lookout. Brian had illicitly stayed with his father, though Delilah had kept this from her superiors, and both Brian and Ned had disappeared without a trace. The teenage girls are reported missing. Henry later discovers a radio and clipboard with transcripts of his conversations with Delilah. He is knocked out and finds <b>the</b> <b>clipboard</b> and radio gone. Henry proceeds to break into a government research area, discovering surveillance equipment and typewritten reports detailing his and Delilah's lives and conversations. After taking a tracking device, he leaves the compound. As Henry hikes back, he witnesses it set afire by an unknown individual. Using the tracking device, Henry finds {{a backpack}} with the keys to the cave. Delilah reports someone in Henry's tower. Henry finds a Walkman with incriminating conversations of him and Delilah plotting to destroy the compound.|$|E

500|$|The G2 {{ships with}} Android 4.2.2 [...] "Jelly Bean" [...] with a custom {{interface}} and software. It contains {{a number of}} features {{that are designed to}} [...] "learn" [...] from users by predicting future actions, and allow for flexibility and customization. The G2 retains features from previous LG models such as the Optimus G and G Pro, including QuickMemo (which allows users to write notes on top of a screenshot), QuickRemote (a feature which allows the device to serve as a universal remote), QSlide pop-up apps, and Voice Mate. New features introduced by the G2 include TextLink, which analyzes text messages to detect content such as addresses and times that can be passed to other apps (such as the calendar, a note, or Google Maps), a pop-up menu of relevant apps triggered when plugging in headphones or a USB cable (Plug & Pop), the ability to answer a phone call by holding the phone to the user's head (AnswerMe), Slide Aside, a multitasking feature which allows users to [...] "slide" [...] away apps onto cards with a three-finger gesture, the Clip Tray (which collects content that had been copied to <b>the</b> <b>clipboard),</b> and Guest Mode. The G2 uses on-screen buttons; users can change their background color (which includes black and white options, either solid colored or with a gradient), customize the order of the buttons, or add additional buttons for opening QuickMemo or the notification shade. The G2's default music player supports the playback of WAV and FLAC files with 24-bit/192kHz audio.|$|E
2500|$|The SysRq and Print screen {{commands}} often {{share the}} same key. SysRq was used in earlier computers as a [...] "panic" [...] button to recover from crashes (and it is still used in this sense to some extent by the Linux kernel; see Magic SysRq key). The Print screen command used to capture the entire screen {{and send it to}} the printer, but in the present it usually puts a screenshot in <b>the</b> <b>clipboard.</b> The Break key/Pause key no longer has a well-defined purpose. Its origins go back to teleprinter users, who wanted a key that would temporarily interrupt the communications line. The Break key can be used by software in several different ways, such as to switch between multiple login sessions, to terminate a program, or to interrupt a modem connection.|$|E
50|$|Street Collections: Currently {{known as}} 'Raids', {{volunteer}} collectors {{go out into}} the streets (often in costume) to collect for a specific charity on any given day with buckets rather than <b>the</b> <b>clipboards.</b> Many Rags also organise week-long 'Tours' over the university holidays in which they will travel from town to town, collecting in each one, and raising thousands of pounds for the beneficiary charity.|$|R
40|$|The {{implemented}} system (ClipShare) {{is aimed}} at simplifying text transfer between a PC and a Smartphone by synchronizing <b>the</b> two devices’ <b>clipboards.</b> Everything <b>the</b> user has {{to do in order}} to send a piece of text from one device to another is to perform a copy-to-clipboard operation on the first device and a paste-from-clipboard one on the second. The copy-paste operations are performed by using widelyknown, standard operating system commands and UIs, such as Right-Click + Copy or Ctrl + V. ClipShare monitors <b>the</b> <b>clipboards</b> of <b>the</b> two connected devices and when a new copy operation is performed on either of them, it sends the data to <b>the</b> other device’s <b>clipboard.</b> <b>The</b> user receives an unobtrusive notification that a new clip was received from the ClipShare connected device. A Bluetooth link was chosen as the underlying connection, so the application can be successfully used even with devices that are not connected to the Internet. The proof-of-concept application was written for and runs on Microsoft ® Windows 7 and Android 2. 2. 1 operating systems...|$|R

2500|$|As a way {{of dealing}} with his {{loneliness}} and homesickness at this time, Konuma began going to the cinema. He majored in film studies in the Art Department of Nihon University. Soon after graduation, in 1961, Konuma went to work at Nikkatsu Studios, {{about the same time as}} producer Yuki and directors Kōyū Ohara and Noboru Tanaka. The quartet were known by their individual characters as, [...] "Diligent Yuki, slovenly Ohara, faithful Tanaka, reckless Konuma." [...] Konuma started as a [...] "fifth" [...] assistant director, which meant he was in charge of <b>the</b> <b>clipboard.</b> He endured this low position at the studio in the hope that eventually he would become a director. In his early career, he was the assistant director on such films as Nikkatsu's venture into the kaiju genre, Daikyojū Gappa (1967), which was released in the U.S. as Monster from a Prehistoric Planet. Seijun Suzuki was one of the few directors who impressed Konuma during these early years at Nikkatsu.|$|E
