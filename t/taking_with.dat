5|$|After Dorothy's wedding {{much of the}} {{documentation}} of Olivia's life ceases. She moved out of Brunswick Gardens in 1924, throwing away personal correspondence and giving away hundreds of books. Hope Shakespear died on 5 July 1923; within months Olivia moved to an apartment in West Kensington, <b>taking</b> <b>with</b> her two maids {{who had been with}} the family for decades. Her life continued unchanged, filled with social events. In September 1926, Dorothy gave birth to a son, Omar Pound, who in 1927 was brought from France to be raised in England. Olivia became his guardian and Dorothy spent summers with her mother and son.|$|E

5|$|Commander David W. Bagley, the destroyer's commander, {{ordered all}} life rafts and boats launched. As the ship sank, her bow {{raised in the}} air almost {{vertically}} before she began to slip beneath the waves. At this point the armed depth charges began to explode, killing a number of {{men who had been}} unable to escape the destroyer, and stunning many others in the water. The destroyer, the first United States destroyer ever lost to enemy action, sank eight minutes after the torpedo struck the rudder, <b>taking</b> <b>with</b> her two officers and 64 men.|$|E
5|$|During the 15th {{century the}} economy of Southampton {{improved}} {{as a result of}} the Italian wool trade and the presence of many foreign merchants. The Medieval Merchant's House was acquired by a sequence of established Southampton merchants, but it remained intact as a detached dwelling, unlike many other properties in the neighbourhood that were combined to form the larger homes that became more fashionable in the late 15th century. In the middle of the 16th century, however, Southampton's economy collapsed once again as trade with Italy declined, <b>taking</b> <b>with</b> it the prosperity of FrenchStreet. A new parlour was installed in the house, and a floor was added halfway across the open hall to produce additional sleeping space.|$|E
5|$|Gian Gastone {{arrived in}} Tuscany, without his wife, in 1708. The Emperor, {{thinking}} {{it unlikely that}} any male heirs were to be born to the Medici, prepared to occupy Tuscany, under the pretext of Medici descent. He intimated that upon the Grand Prince's death the Tuscans would rebel against Cosimo's autocratic government. Cosimo, {{in an act of}} desperation, had Francesco Maria, the Medici family cardinal, renounce his religious vows and marry Eleanor of Gonzaga, the youngest child of the incumbent Duke of Guastalla. Two years later, Francesco Maria died, <b>taking</b> <b>with</b> him any hope of an heir.|$|E

5|$|In 1741, the 2nd Marquis of Annandale left Craigiehall to his nephew, Charles Hope-Weir (1710–1791), {{second son}} of Charles Hope, 1st Earl of Hopetoun. Hope-Weir {{travelled}} to Europe on the grand tour in 1754-55, <b>taking</b> <b>with</b> him the young architect Robert Adam, and {{was inspired to}} improve the Craigiehall policies on his return. A walled forecourt and the formal gardens {{in front of the}} house were removed. He also planted numerous trees across the estate, laid out avenues, and had several garden buildings constructed. A lake was excavated, and a new bridge over the River Almond was constructed to link the neighbouring estate of Lennie, which Hope-Weir had bought in 1750.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, sensing {{they were}} close to {{achieving}} suffrage, Rathbone & Stewart-Bright created Municipal Women's Association as {{a branch of the}} society; its aim was to increase awareness of the vote for women, encourage discussion amongst potential women voters and teaching women what to do when they had the vote. In 1912, the Liverpool Women Suffrage Society disagreed with the route that the National Union Women's Suffrage Societies was <b>taking,</b> <b>with</b> its Election Fighting Fund, and instead merged with the Municipal Women's Association to become the Liverpool Women's Citizen's Association. The outbreak of World War I changed the focus of groups to help with the national emergency and in 1919 the groups merged. By 1921 they had 12 branches.|$|E
5|$|In January 1855, Brontë {{discovered}} she was pregnant. It {{was accompanied by}} severe illness and she died on 31 March 1855, officially from tuberculosis. Mr. Nicholls remained with Brontë's father for a further six years before returning to Banagher in 1861, <b>taking</b> <b>with</b> him his wife's portrait, her wedding dress (of which a copy has been made), some of Charlotte's letters and other mementoes. Forty years later, when the critic Clement Shorter prepared to write Charlotte Brontë and Her Circle, he found at Banagher among other relics, two diaries of Emily and Anne, in a tin box, and some of Charlotte's minute childhood writings wrapped in newspaper {{at the bottom of}} a drawer.|$|E

5|$|In the end a {{total of}} 28 {{architectural}} firms registered their intent to submit entries to the competition—a lower number than expected, but Richardson suggests {{this may have been}} due to work on proposals for the new Adelaide railway station. Out of those 28, {{a total of}} 26 firms submitted designs by the deadline. On 10 November 1924, before judging could be completed, the Richards Building in Currie Street was destroyed by fire, <b>taking</b> <b>with</b> it all 26 proposals.|$|E
5|$|Just as {{the battle}} began, the Swedish {{flagship}} Kronan sank, <b>taking</b> <b>with</b> it almost the entire crew, including the Admiral of the Realm and commander of the Swedish navy, Lorentz Creutz. The allied force {{under the leadership of}} the Dutch admiral Cornelis Tromp took full advantage of the ensuing disorder on the Swedish side. The acting commander after Creutz's sudden demise, Admiral Claes Uggla, was surrounded and his flagship Svärdet battered in a drawn-out artillery duel, then set ablaze by a fire ship. Uggla drowned while escaping the burning ship, and with the loss of a second supreme commander, the rest of the Swedish fleet fled in disorder.|$|E
5|$|Neaira was {{certainly}} living with Phrynion in Athens by 373BC, {{when he took}} her to a feast given by the general Chabrias to celebrate his victory in the Pythian Games. During this celebration, Apollodorus says, Neaira was sexually assaulted by the guests and slaves of Chabrias while she was drunk and asleep. Due to this and other mistreatment by Phrynion, in 372BC Neaira left his household and went to Megara, <b>taking</b> <b>with</b> her her clothing and jewellery, two maids, and other possessions belonging to Phrynion.|$|E

5|$|On 3 April, Führer Directive 26 was issued, {{detailing}} {{the plan of}} attack and command structure for the invasion. Hungary and Bulgaria were promised the Banat and Yugoslav Macedonia respectively and the Romanian army was asked not to take part, holding its position at the countries' border. Internal conflict in Hungary over the invasion plans between the army and Teleki led to the Prime Minister's suicide that same evening. Also on 3 April, Edmund Veesenmayer, representing the Dienststelle Ribbentrop, arrived in Zagreb {{in preparation for a}} regime change. Croatian pilot Vladimir Kren, a captain in the Royal Yugoslav Air Force, defected to the Germans on 3 April <b>taking</b> <b>with</b> him valuable information about the country's air defenses.|$|E
5|$|Sheriff Andrew Jackson (Lenny Von Dohlen) {{rules the}} death an accident, but Shawn {{receives}} the Dewey Decimal Classification number of a book, Reincarnation and Rebirth, {{the title of}} which parallels the revelation that Paula had supposedly drowned in Santa Barbara, California seven years earlier, though her body was never found. Bob reveals that Michelle's unstable sister Lucy left Dual Spires, <b>taking</b> <b>with</b> her Paula, whom Michelle and Bob had all but raised. When Paula sent them a letter detailing the drug use and child abuse, they helped Paula fake her death so she could leave Lucy. Detectives Juliet O'Hara (Maggie Lawson) and Carlton Lassiter (Timothy Omundson) reopen the case and leave to issue a warrant for Bob's arrest.|$|E
5|$|Still {{in pursuit}} of the debris of the enemy force, late on 13 February, Napoleon {{received}} reports that Marmont's Corps had been attacked and pushed out of his position at Étoges. The Emperor deduced that the enemy force before him {{would have to be a}} much reduced one and promptly decided to go to Marmont's aid. The Emperor left Château-Thierry on 14 February, towards 3 o'clock in the morning, leaving a small portion of his forces with Marshal Édouard Mortier, duc de Trévise, with orders to continue the pursuit of the enemy. <b>Taking</b> <b>with</b> him the cavalry of the Guard and Grouchy's Cavalry Reserve, Napoleon headed for the village of Vauchamps.|$|E

5|$|The coup {{ultimately}} failed, as it {{met with}} the resistance {{of most of the}} warriors, who were opposed to the king's assassination. As a result, the Lombard garrison in Ticinum proclaimed Duke Cleph the new king, and Helmichis, rather than going to war against overwhelming odds, escaped to Ravenna with Longinus' assistance, <b>taking</b> <b>with</b> him his wife, his troops, the royal treasure and Alboin's daughter Albsuinda. In Ravenna the two lovers became estranged and killed each other. Subsequently, Longinus sent Albsuinda and the treasure to Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|With the Matabele wars over, Burnham {{decided it}} was time to leave Africa and move on to other adventures. The family {{returned}} to California. Soon after, Fred traveled to Alaska and the Yukon to prospect in the Klondike Gold Rush, <b>taking</b> <b>with</b> him his eldest son Roderick, who was then 12 years old. On hearing of the Spanish–American War, Burnham rushed home to volunteer his services, but the war had ended before he could get to the fighting. Burnham returned to the Klondike having played no part in the war. Colonel Theodore Roosevelt regretted this as much as Burnham and paid him a great tribute in his book.|$|E
5|$|By the {{following}} day, 29 November, the garrison's water supply had been exhausted. The {{walls of the}} fort had also collapsed and the garrison was exposed, leading to further casualties amongst the Nepali troops. Seeing the disheartened state of men, the Captain and other officers asked them to sign a pledge {{to fight to the}} last. Eighty-four soldiers signed. However, that night the Mleccha Kalanala Company, which had arrived as reinforcements and was stationed at a portico east of Nalapani, secretly abandoned their post, <b>taking</b> <b>with</b> them their arms and colours. Seeing this, some of the men who had signed the pledge followed. The 50 or 60 men that remained, overcome by the hopelessness of the situation, felt that instead of confronting certain death by remaining in the fort, it was better to escape to the hills and hold their position there. Perhaps unable to convince their commanders with words, the escaping men caught hold of their Captain and other officers by their arms, and dragged them away from the fort. Learning of this new movement, the British renewed their fire; but the Nepalese managed to cut through and make a successful escape.|$|E
