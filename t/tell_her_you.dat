6000|$|... "So {{long as we}} see our own mistakes," [...] {{said the}} Professor, [...] "there is hope for us all. You go {{straight}} home, young man, and tell her you've changed your mind. <b>Tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>you</b> don't want her with brains. <b>Tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>you</b> like her best without. You get that into her head before anything else happens." ...|$|E
60|$|Her brother {{broke into}} a laugh. “I’ll <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>you</b> said so; by the lord, Trix, I will,” he cries out.|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>you</b> didn't mean her nose? Oh, by all means, Clara,--by all means! Quite an inspiration. Why {{not make}} her an evening party?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She oughtn't to have come. I should <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> just that. <b>You</b> {{might send}} the maid to <b>her</b> to <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that <b>you</b> couldn't see <b>her</b> again.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said; [...] "I wrote a note <b>telling</b> <b>her</b> <b>you</b> were ill, {{and asking}} her to come to-morrow or the day after. I haven't posted it yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You couldn't save {{me against}} my will without coming in," [...] said Mr. Heard. [...] "Now we can <b>tell</b> <b>'er</b> <b>you</b> dived in off the quay and got me just as I was sinking for the last time. You'll be a hero." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'By {{all means}} <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b> <b>You</b> must judge about showing it, but I should think the opening {{for talking to}} her on the subject a great gain.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is just {{finishing}} breakfast," [...] said the butler. [...] "She will soon see you now. I am just {{going up to}} <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>you</b> are here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, thank you," [...] said Dorothy; [...] "we {{prefer to}} travel alone. But if I see Ozma I'll <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>you</b> {{want to come}} to her {{birthday}} party." ...|$|E
60|$|I write another letter, {{enclosing}} this, which <b>you</b> {{can show}} <b>her,</b> if she desires it. I {{do this because}} she would think strangely, perhaps, should <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that <b>you</b> received no letters from me, or, <b>telling</b> <b>her</b> <b>you</b> do, refuse to let her see them. I close this, entertaining the confident hope that every successive letter I shall have from you (which I here pray may not be few, nor far between) may show you possessing a more steady hand and cheerful heart than the last preceding it. As ever, your friend, LINCOLN.|$|R
60|$|MR MARCH. [To BARNABAS] I think you'd better <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> {{anything}} <b>you</b> know.|$|R
6000|$|... "May I {{go and see}} her?" [...] said Dorothea, eagerly. [...] "Would she {{accept my}} sympathy? I would <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that <b>you</b> have not been blamable before any one's {{judgment}} but your own. I would <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that <b>you</b> shall be cleared in every fair mind. I would cheer <b>her</b> heart. Will <b>you</b> ask <b>her</b> if I may go to see her? I did see her once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It won't do, so I'll <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>you</b> are {{an invalid}} and very particular,' said Amanda, with another inspiration, as {{she led the}} landlady forth to break the blow tenderly.|$|E
6000|$|... "Listening, I suppose. Well;--so {{much the}} better. You know well enough, {{and you can}} <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b> <b>You</b> ain't a fool, though I suppose you'll be afraid to open your mouth." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hawtrey's lip curled. [...] "No," [...] he said, [...] "if she'll excuse me, I don't think I do. If you <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>you</b> {{have been}} successful, she'll {{probably}} be quite content." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fancy my feelings!" [...] said Mr. Piper, with a shudder. [...] "Playing with fire, that’s what I call it. My niece {{is coming}} this afternoon; {{it would serve}} <b>her</b> right if <b>you</b> gave <b>her</b> a fright by <b>telling</b> <b>her</b> <b>you</b> had killed me. Perhaps {{it would be a}} lesson to her not to be so officious." ...|$|R
60|$|M. Never mind. Don't <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> what <b>you</b> told me. Go on the Peerage and Landed-Gentry tack.|$|R
6000|$|... "And 'ow are {{you going}} to {{convince}} 'er of it?" [...] asked Jarman. [...] "You think your <b>telling</b> <b>'er</b> <b>you</b> loved <b>'er</b> proves it. So it would to anybody else, but not to <b>'er.</b> <b>You</b> can't expect it. Besides, if every girl is going to give up 'er catch just because the fellow 'adn't all 'is wits about 'im at the time--well, what do you think?" [...] He appealed to Minikin.|$|R
6000|$|... "I will <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>you</b> are here, miss, {{and ask her}} {{to grant}} you an audience," [...] said the maid. [...] "Step in, please, and take {{a seat in the}} drawing-room." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hawtrey smiled rather grimly. [...] "No," [...] he said, [...] "if she'll excuse me, I don't think I do. If you <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>you</b> {{have been}} successful, she'll {{probably}} be quite content." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; you {{can send}} Beatrice to give her notice, you know. She never was unreasonable, and I {{do not think that}} you would find her so. You should <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> <b>you</b> know--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I may <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that?" [...] Drexley said, {{looking at}} him keenly. [...] "I may <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that <b>you</b> cannot come on Thursday because you have an engagement?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mamma,' said Marie, 'I {{will never}} have any other man but him;--never, never, never. Oh, Felix, <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that <b>you</b> love me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Hearken, brethren. When She-who-has-a-right-to-ask interrogates you {{concerning}} a change she finds in your mood answer <b>her</b> thus: <b>Tell</b> <b>her</b> that <b>you,</b> {{in a sudden}} rage, have murdered your grandmother; <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that <b>you</b> have robbed orphans and that remorse has stricken you; <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> your fortune is swept away; that you are beset by enemies, by bunions, by any kind of malevolent fate; but do not, if peace and happiness are {{worth as much as}} a grain of mustard seed to you--do not answer her [...] "Nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Smith {{shook her}} head. [...] "I can't say," [...] she replied, moving towards the door. [...] "When she's off holidaying, I {{never know when}} she'll return. Shall I <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>you</b> called?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>you</b> {{have been}} HERE, at any rate," [...] said Mrs. Penniman, {{pointing}} {{to the spot where}} they stood; [...] "and I will give her your message--that she is to hold fast!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>you</b> are here." [...] She {{left him}} at the threshold, a haggard and humble suitor, while she knocked at her daughter's door. [...] "Viola, child, Anthony is here. Let me in just a moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not now,' said Lucilla, {{with all}} her alert readiness. 'I will <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> to-night. <b>You</b> {{will come in the}} first day you can!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'About the {{glimpse of}} the better world,' said Newman. 'I didn't <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> who <b>you</b> were, either, or where you'd seen <b>her.</b> I said <b>you</b> loved <b>her</b> to distraction.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shan't <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her?</b> Can <b>you</b> {{sit down}} {{together}} in this summer-house, this divine day, with such a dreadful thing as that between you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>you</b> said that! And now, {{remember}} {{that if you}} need me, I am there." [...] And Mrs. Penniman, who {{could think of nothing}} more to say, nodded vaguely in the direction of Washington Square.|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} you can put me off," [...] he rejoined sternly, [...] "with such an excuse as that? What did Miss de Sor ask you to <b>tell</b> <b>her?</b> <b>You</b> promised to trust me. Be as good as your word." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What word can I {{carry to}} her from you? I'm {{going to go and}} see her. If I could take a word from you, I know she would come back to the table. Shall I <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>you</b> feel to blame?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{write her}} a note, and <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that <b>you</b> find I {{had promised to}} preach at Chaldicotes next Sunday. You'll go of course?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes, Arthur, yes. Oh, to be sure! I'll <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> that <b>you</b> {{have come}} home. Please to wait here. You won't find the room changed.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know what}} you ought to do. Clear your {{character}} handsomely before <b>her.</b> <b>Tell</b> <b>her</b> that <b>you</b> think very highly of the understanding of women." ...|$|R
