5|$|In a {{follow-up}} to Operation Goodwood on 19 July, the Calgary Highlanders attempted to take the northern spur of Verrières Ridge but German mortar fire limited their progress. Tanks from the Sherbrooke Fusiliers were sent to support the battalion and eliminated several machine-gun positions {{on either side of}} Point67. The Highlanders eventually managed to dig in, despite accurate return fire. Over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours,</b> they strengthened their position and the 5th and 6th Canadian Infantry Brigades made repeated attempts to exploit the gains. Against a tenacious German defense and minor infantry and tank counterattacks, the Canadians were broadly repulsed with heavy casualties. Simonds rapidly prepared a new offensive for the following day, with the goals of capturing both {{the eastern side of the}} Orne river and the main slopes of Verrières Ridge.|$|E
5|$|Mortar and {{artillery}} exchange between the South Ossetian and Georgian forces {{erupted in the}} afternoon of 6 August along almost the entire line of contact, which lasted until the dawn of 7 August. Exchanges resumed following a brief gap in the morning. South Ossetian leader Eduard Kokoity announced that {{the armed forces of}} South Ossetia were ready to go on the offensive in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours.</b> At 14:00 on 7 August, two Georgian peacekeepers were killed in Avnevi as a result of Ossetian shelling. At about 14:30, Georgian tanks, 122mm howitzers and 203mm self-propelled artillery began heading towards South Ossetia to dissuade separatists from additional attacks. During the afternoon, OSCE monitors recorded Georgian military traffic, including artillery, on roads near Gori. In the afternoon, Georgian personnel left the Joint Peacekeeping Force headquarters in Tskhinvali.|$|E
5|$|With a {{strength}} that {{continued to grow}} until there was about 350 men around the bridge, the charges that had {{been placed on the}} bridge were removed and No. 3 Commando settled in to defend the bridge as they waited for 50th Division to arrive. Over the course of <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> they were subjected to mortar fire and shelling from a Panzer IV tank. Eventually, as casualties mounted and their reinforcement became overdue the Commandos were forced to abandon the position, nevertheless they had prevented the bridge from being blown up and it was eventually recaptured as the Eighth Army arrived a short time later. The unit, however, suffered heavily for the success, suffering 30 killed, 66 wounded and 59 missing or captured. The bridge was later renamed No. 3 Commando Bridge in their honour.|$|E

5|$|Around mid-afternoon on July 9, {{observers}} {{with the}} 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry spotted {{a column of}} 200 vehicles led by 11 North Korean T-34 tanks, subsequently calling for an airstrike. For <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> the U.S. Air Force ravaged the North Korean column with repeated bombings and strafing, and by sunset half of the vehicles were destroyed or burning and {{a large portion of}} the infantry had also been killed. The next day, a similar airstrike by B-26 Invaders, F-80 and F-82 Twin Mustang aircraft of the Fifth Air Force took place around Pyongtaek, with 38 North Korean tanks, seven half-tracks and 117 other trucks destroyed, in addition to a large number of infantry. Much of the village of Chonui was left burning, although it had already been abandoned by South Korean soldiers and civilians. In addition, the airstrikes caused some of the largest losses of North Korean armor of the war, and were a major blow against the T-34 tanks which had been so successful during previous encounters.|$|E
5|$|Atmospheric {{conditions}} remained {{only marginally}} conducive {{for the development}} of thunderstorms on the morning of December30. Throughout the day, moisture was drawn from the Gulf of Mexico northward into the Ozarks region. However, the presence of a capping inversion prevented thunderstorms from developing. During the evening of December30, an area of strong wind shear developed near the Ark-La-Tex and southeastern Oklahoma area well ahead of a nearing cold front, providing a focal point for potential storm development. Late that day, scattered thunderstorms developed over eastern Oklahoma and northern Arkansas, producing significant hail. Over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> and into December31, these storms would intensify as they moved into southwestern Missouri, producing four tornadoes. The first tornado watch issued in association with the severe event was issued at 07:06UTC on December31 as these storms tracked across the Ozarks. After a few hours, these supercell thunderstorms lessened in strength as they neared the Greater St. Louis metropolitan area.|$|E
5|$|All {{along the}} ANZAC perimeter, Turkish troops {{continued}} trying to advance using fire and manoeuvre. This gradually petered {{out as the}} morning progressed, and the Turks tried to regain their own lines instead. The Australians and New Zealanders continued to fire on them, sometimes showing themselves above their trenches. The Turks were now able to return fire, which caused {{the majority of the}} ANZAC casualties. It was now clear to the Australians and New Zealanders that the Turkish attack was a failure. However, a report arrived at Turkish headquarters suggesting that some objectives had been captured. So the Turkish commanders issued orders, at 05:00, for a second assault, this time to be supported by an artillery bombardment. Over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> several new attacks began. At 05:25 the 2nd and 5th Divisions attacked again, but instead of moving directly at the Australian lines, they advanced at an angle, and were again mown down. At No.1 Post in the No.4 Section the Canterbury Mounted Rifles observed the Turks forming in Malone's Gully, in preparation for another assault on Russell's Top. The location of the post was such that they could turn their machine-gun and engage the Turks from the rear, which broke up the attack. The Turks attacked Quinn's four more times, and on one occasion an officer and around thirty men managed to reach the junction of Courtney's and Quinn's before being killed. This pattern of attack was kept up until around 10:00, when Allied observers reported a reluctance among the Turkish troops to leave their trenches.|$|E

50|$|According to {{data from}} the Foreign Ministry in Bucharest, there were about 1200 Romanian citizens, both {{residents}} and tourists, in Lebanon {{at the beginning of}} the conflict. Romania's Foreign Affairs minister Răzvan Ungureanu asked his Syrian counterpart Walid Al-Mouallem to help Romanians transiting Syria on their way back home. All together, over 400 individually entered Syria, and other 651 were evacuated by the Romanian authorities. They are Romanians and Moldovans, Lebanese married to Romanians and foreign diplomats. There were 283 evacuated on 18th, 146 on 19th, and 222 on 20th. The convoys, bearing the Romanian flag, left the Romanian Embassy in Beirut in the mornings of the afore mentioned days to Damascus, where the refugees left from by air to Henry Coandă Airport in Bucharest, arriving there <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day, <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> after <b>the</b> midnight.

5|$|Preceding {{attacks by}} Lee's army had done barely {{anything}} to accomplish Confederate objectives, {{but this did}} not deter Magruder, who rode {{back and forth across}} the battlefield, calling for reinforcements and personally launching unit after unit into a charge of the Union line. At this point, men who had always been directly under Magruder's command began to join the battle. Magruder first encountered some units of Brig. Gen. Robert Toombs. With Toombs's brigade widely dispersed, the individual units Magruder found were not with Toombs himself. Magruder personally led the men in a short-lived charge, followed by a disordered retreat. Other units nominally under Toombs's command appeared, charged and retreated at various times throughout <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours,</b> with little or no organization. The brigades of Col. George T. Anderson and Col. William Barksdale emerged from the woods to the right of Toombs, but as they did so, Anderson's men also became separated, as the left side outpaced the right. This created an advance with two of Anderson's regiments on the far Confederate left next to Toombs, Barksdale's men in the middle, and three more Anderson regiments on the far right, near the remnants of Wright and Mahone. Anderson's right flank charged, but made it no farther than the foot of the hill before breaking and retreating under a hail of antipersonnel artillery. Anderson's left flank never charged. Barksdale's brigade charged at roughly the same time, and made it considerably farther up the hill, engaging the Union infantry of Brig. Gen. Daniel Butterfield in a firefight that lasted more than an hour.|$|E
5|$|Willoughby {{appealed to}} Pym for {{assistance}} and Pym brought Sirius, Iphigenia and Magicienne to support Nereide, launching {{an assault on}} Grand Port on 23 August. Pym had failed to properly reconnoitre the channel and Duperré had had the warning buoys removed, so that Pym's squadron was blindly sailing into a complicated system of reefs and channels. Sirius and Magicienne were soon irretrievably grounded while Iphigenia struggled to find a passage {{and was unable to}} close with the French squadron. Only Nereide reached Duperré's line and Willoughby's initial attack was so determined that the entire French squadron was rapidly driven ashore, only Bellone remaining in a position to exchange fire with the British frigate. A fortunate shot from Bellone cut Nereides anchor cable and the British frigate swung around, presenting her stern to the French ships which raked her repeatedly. Willoughby managed to mitigate some of the effects by cutting the other anchor cable, which brought some of his guns within range of the French, but the balance of the battle had shifted. Over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> his frigate was battered from the French ships and from guns ashore until she was a dismasted, battered hulk with over 220 of her crew killed or wounded.|$|E

Charytoniuk and Chen proposed another approach using a set of ANNs to model the load dynamics instead of the actual loads [8]. For VSTLF, Taylor used the observations of minute-by-minute British electricity demand to evaluate various methods including autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models and two exponential smoothing methods [9]. Alamaniotis et al. proposed an ensemble of kernel-based Gaussian processes [10]. Guan et al. pre-filtered the spikes in load series and decomposed the load series using wavelet prior to feeding it into a neural network [11].|$|R
25|$|At about 21:40 on {{the evening}} of Saturday of 7 March, four off-duty British {{soldiers}} of the Royal Engineers walked outside the barracks to receive a pizza delivery from two delivery men.

40|$|Due to the {{limitation}} of fossil fuel resources {{and their impact on}} climate change, our future energy system will increasingly depend on growing shares of renewable energy sources. This poses a major challenge on the development of future energy systems, since energy production from most renewable resources is highly variable in space and time. Because of the high variability, an efficient integration of solar energy into the existing energy supply system will only be possible if reliable near real time forecasts of ground level solar irradiance as well as one to three day forecasts of energy production and demand are available. This study deals with solar irradiance forecasts of <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> days and <b>hours</b> with respect to their application in solar energy industries. The main atmospheric parameter responsible for the extinction of solar irradiance is clouds. However, a main focus and economic potential of the solar energy industry is situated in regions and time periods with minimal cloud cover. During these clear sky cases “ it is mainly aerosols, solid and liquid particles in the atmosphere, that influence the direct and diffuse irradiance at ground level. Aerosols are highly variable in space and time, which leads to difficulties in calculating and forecasting their spatio-temporal pattern...|$|R
40|$|Observations {{have been}} and are an {{important}} part of today's meteorological developments. Surface observations are very useful as they are, providing weather information for a point location. ough they do not give much information, if any, on what happens between the stations across a larger area. With models one can create an analysis of the meteorological situation, i. e. calculate and estimate what happens between these fixed observation points. Remote-sensing data, such as radar and satellite, are being processed and the output is given over a domain as an analysed product of their measurements. For example, radar gives a plot of where the rain is located, i. e. an analysis of the current precipitation. With a series of radar images, a human (subjectively) or a computer objectively) can process this information to estimate where the rain will move and be located within <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>few</b> minutes (even <b>hours),</b> i. e. a short forecast also called "nowcast". is applies to some extent also for other observations, such as satellite data (cloud propagation). But for most quantities (such as temperature, wind, etc) it is significantly harder to make such a nowcast, since these are influenced by many other factors and there is no linear development of them. Therefore, there are forecast models that solve physical and dynamic equations, so that one can estimate the future weather for the coming hours and days. A prerequisite for generating a forecast of high quality is to capture the initial weather conditions as best as possible. This is done using observations and they are introduced into the forecast model through different techniques, where the model creates its own analysis as the initial step. There remain problems since forecast models often are affected by physical disagreements, as the dynamic conditions are not in balance. This results in the model having a spin-up effect, where the meteorological quantities are not yet in balance with each other and the resulting weather conditions are not always reliable during the first hours. Hence, a lot of research is spent on how to reduce this spin-up effect and on the use of nowcast models, in order to deliver the best model results for the first <b>few</b> <b>hours</b> of the forecast period. In this dissertation, the research work has been to improve the meteorological analysis, algorithms and functionality, using the Local Analysis and Prediction System (LAPS) model. Different kinds of observations were used and their interdependencies have been studied, in order to combine and merge information from variousinstruments. Primarily focus has been to improve the estimation of precipitation accumulation and meteorological quantities that affect wind energy. The LAPS developments have been used for several end-users and nowcasting applications, and experimentally as initial conditions for forecast modelling. The studies have been concentrated on Finland and nearby sea areas, with the available datasets for this domain. By combining surface-station measurements, radar and lightning information, one can improve the precipitation-amount estimations. The use of lightning data further improves the estimates and gives the advantage of having additional data outside radar coverage, which can potentially be very useful for example over sea areas. In addition, the improved LAPS analyses (cloud-related quantities) and a newly developed model (LOWICE), calculating the electricity production during wintertime (taking into account the icing of wind turbine rotor blades which reduces efficiency), have shown good results...|$|R
