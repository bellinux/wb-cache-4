5|$|From 2000 to 2003 {{the award}} was made based on players' impact on cricket {{worldwide}} rather <b>than</b> <b>just</b> the preceding season in England, {{but the decision}} was reversed in 2004 {{with the introduction of}} a separate Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World award.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, Princeton Theological Seminary was reorganized to {{make the}} school's {{leadership}} and faculty more representative of the wider church rather <b>than</b> <b>just</b> Old School Presbyterianism. Two of the seminary's new board members were signatories to the Auburn Affirmation. In order to preserve Princeton's Old School legacy, Machen {{and several of his}} colleagues founded Westminster Theological Seminary.|$|E
5|$|Kalman Juvelier, {{an actor}} in Ber Ghimpel's company, {{credited}} Goldfaden with greatly strengthening the caliber of performance in Lvov during his brief time there, reporting that Goldfaden worked with every actor on understanding his or her character, so as {{to ensure that the}} play was more <b>than</b> <b>just</b> a series of songs and effects, and was respected by all.|$|E

25|$|Ideas {{are more}} {{important}} <b>than</b> age. <b>Just</b> because someone is junior doesn't mean they don't deserve respect and cooperation.|$|R
5|$|One {{possible}} fix is {{to consider}} collections of objects {{that can be easily}} divided, such as pies or, still better, segmented rods. Rather <b>than</b> <b>just</b> combining collections of segments, rods can be joined end-to-end, which illustrates another conception of addition: adding not the rods but the lengths of the rods.|$|E
5|$|Rodents have {{advanced}} cognitive abilities. They can quickly learn to avoid poisoned baits, {{which makes them}} difficult pests to deal with. Guinea pigs can learn and remember complex pathways to food. Squirrels and kangaroo rats are able to locate caches of food by spatial memory, rather <b>than</b> <b>just</b> by smell.|$|E
5|$|Summation {{describes}} {{the addition of}} arbitrarily many numbers, usually more <b>than</b> <b>just</b> two. It includes {{the idea of the}} sum of a single number, which is itself, and the empty sum, which is zero. An infinite summation is a delicate procedure known as a series.|$|E
50|$|Tail: No {{more than}} 2 {{feathers}} in width, shorter rather <b>than</b> longer, <b>just</b> clearing {{the floor when}} in show position.|$|R

5|$|The game {{features}} more characters <b>than</b> <b>just</b> the original trio. Other characters such as Jane Maxwell, McDullen Harts (called Magdalene Harts in the remake), Emma Hetfield, Mariel, and Zed {{will be able}} to join and the player may switch them into the battlefield. All of the dungeons have completely different puzzles and layouts.|$|E
5|$|The poet Ovid also {{dealt with}} the mythology of the narcissus. In his Metamorphoses, he recounts {{the story of the}} youth Narcissus who, after his death, is turned into the flower, and it is also {{mentioned}} in Book 5 of his poem Fasti. This theme of metamorphosis was broader <b>than</b> <b>just</b> Narcissus; for instance see crocus, laurel and hyacinth.|$|E
5|$|Tolkien's {{portrayal}} of goblins in The Hobbit was particularly influenced by George MacDonald's The Princess and the Goblin. However, MacDonald influenced Tolkien more profoundly <b>than</b> <b>just</b> to shape individual characters and episodes; his works further helped Tolkien form his whole {{thinking on the}} role of fantasy within his Christian faith.|$|E

5|$|After the 1982 Tylenol murders, new FDA {{regulations}} {{went into}} effect which made it a federal - rather <b>than</b> <b>just</b> a state or local - crime to tamper with consumer products. Local and state authorities are not, however, prevented from also filing charges in such cases. Under this law, Nickell's crime was prosecutable as a federal product tampering case {{as well as a}} state murder case, and she was convicted not of murder, but of product tampering that caused death. The possibility of state charges for the actual murders of Susan Snow and Bruce Nickell continues to exist.|$|E
5|$|As the Philadelphia Council's newly hired field {{executive}} in 1915, one of Goodman's assignments was {{to serve as}} director of the council's summer camp at Treasure Island Scout Reservation on the Delaware River. He believed that the summer camp experience should do more <b>than</b> <b>just</b> teach proficiency in Scoutcraft skills; rather, the principles embodied in the Scout Oath and Scout Law should become realities in the lives of Scouts. Along with his assistant camp director, Carroll A. Edson, he started an experimental program to recognize those Scouts best exemplifying those traits as an example to their peers.|$|E
5|$|Bogoljub Petranović {{collected}} Bosnian Serb lyric folk {{poems and}} published them in 1867 {{in a separate}} book (Српске народне пјесме из Босне (Женске)). The First Bosnian-Serb Calendar for the Common Year 1869 (Први босанско-српски календар за просту годину 1869), consisting of 58 pages, was edited by Jovan R. Džinić. In Serbian tradition, calendars contained more <b>than</b> <b>just</b> calendarical data and were also popular literary and educational almanacs. Džinić's calendar had more of an educational, rather than literary, character.|$|E

5|$|Cantor was {{the first}} to {{formulate}} what later {{came to be known as}} the continuum hypothesis or CH: there exists no set whose power is greater than that of the naturals and less than that of the reals (or equivalently, the cardinality of the reals is exactly aleph-one, rather <b>than</b> <b>just</b> at least aleph-one). Cantor believed the continuum hypothesis to be true and tried for many years to prove it, in vain. His inability to prove the continuum hypothesis caused him considerable anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{defense is}} {{important}} in some species, usually being advertised by bright aposematic colours. Some Tenebrionidae use their posture for releasing noxious chemicals to warn off predators. Chemical defences may serve purposes other <b>than</b> <b>just</b> protection from vertebrates, such as protection {{from a wide range}} of microbes. Some species sequester chemicals from the plants they feed on, incorporating them into their own defenses.|$|E
5|$|Feeding {{is usually}} {{in small groups}} and the bird takes mainly insects. Breeding usually starts in March, with the birds {{building}} their nest high in an acacia tree. The birds usually lay five to six cream eggs with lilac blotches. The nest itself is globular in shape with a tubular entrance on top. It is possible that more <b>than</b> <b>just</b> the breeding pair visit the nest and that the young of previous years help in rearing the young.|$|E
50|$|Charitable tax {{benefits}} (for example Gift Aid) were extended to charities within EU member states, Norway and Iceland, rather <b>than</b> those <b>just</b> inside the UK.|$|R

5|$|Halo 3 {{also had}} {{marketing}} tie-ins and promotions. PepsiCo {{announced a new}} line of soft drink, a variant of Mountain Dew named Game Fuel, branded with the Halo 3 logo and the Master Chief. Much of the advertising focused on appealing to the general public, rather <b>than</b> <b>just</b> hardcore fans of the game; for example, some 7-Eleven stores advertised Halo 3 and sold specialty cups and copies of the game.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Criterion {{launched}} their follow-up to Burnout 3: Takedown, titled Burnout Revenge. Revenge retained Takedowns {{but continued to}} evolve the aggressive style of driving by introducing new features {{such as the ability}} to knock traffic {{out of the way and}} into opponents. With Revenge, Criterion wanted to set the game on its own path rather <b>than</b> <b>just</b> recreate Burnout 3 again. Ward admitted that later Burnout games may not have recaptured the same quintessential feeling that Burnout 3 did. He considered Burnout 3 to be the game that he was most proud of working on and high point for the studio.|$|E
5|$|In March 1848, Garrison, the Motts, Abby Kelley Foster, Stephen Symonds Foster {{and others}} hosted an Anti-Sabbath meeting in Boston, {{to work toward}} the {{elimination}} of laws that apply only to Sunday, and to gain for the laborer more time away from toil <b>than</b> <b>just</b> one day of rest per week. Lucretia Mott and two other women were active within the executive committee, and Mott spoke to the assemblage. Lucretia Mott {{raised questions about the}} validity of blindly following religious and social tradition.|$|E
