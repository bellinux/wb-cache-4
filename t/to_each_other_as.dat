5|$|In September 1883, Queen Victoria {{appointed}} {{him to her}} yacht, HMY Victoria and Albert. On 30 April 1884 at Darmstadt {{in the presence of}} the Queen, Prince Louis married her granddaughter, Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine. His wife was the eldest daughter of Queen Victoria's second daughter Princess Alice by Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse. Through the Hesse family, Prince and Princess Louis of Battenberg were first cousins once removed. They had known each other since childhood, and invariably spoke English <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> <b>As</b> wedding presents Louis received the British Order of the Bath and the Star and Chain of the Hessian Order of Louis.|$|E
5|$|Lacaille gave nine stars Bayer designations, {{labelling}} them Alpha {{through to}} Theta, including two stars next <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>as</b> Zeta. Gould later added a tenth, Iota Antliae. Beta and Gamma Antliae (now HR 4339 and HD 90156) {{ended up in}} the neighbouring constellation Hydra once the constellation boundaries were delineated in 1930. Within the constellation's borders, there are 42 stars brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude6.5.|$|E
5|$|Lacaille gave {{twelve stars}} Bayer designations, {{labelling}} them Alpha through to Kappa, including two stars next <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>as</b> Delta and another two stars near {{each other as}} Kappa. Within the constellation's borders, there are 39 stars brighter {{than or equal to}} apparent magnitude6.5. Beta, Gamma and Delta Apodis form a narrow triangle, with Alpha Apodis lying to the east. The five brightest stars are all red-tinged, which is unusual among constellations.|$|E

5|$|St Peter's {{is made up}} {{of three}} parts, {{including}} a mid-19th-century west tower, which replaced the original in 1859–60 after it fell down. The perpendicular clerestory is decorated with shields in quatrefoils and is lit with closely set three-light windows. The tall decorated chancel has very large windows. The side windows have reticulated tracery. The large east window was partly rebuilt in 1875–76, and is composed of six lights with two large mouchettes nodding <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>as</b> well as a very large reticulation unit.|$|E
5|$|Colonies {{are mainly}} {{polygynous}} with polyandrous queens, however, polyandry in jack jumper colonies {{is low in}} comparison to other Myrmecia ants, but it is comparable to M. pyriformis ants. In 1979, Craig and Crozier investigated the genetic structure of jack jumper ant colonies, and although queens are unrelated <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>as</b> mentioned previously, the occurrence of related queens in a single colony was possible. During colony foundation, there are suggestions of dependent colony foundation in jack jumper queens, although independent colony foundations can occur, as the queens do have fully developed wings and can fly. Isolation by distance (IBD) patterns have been recorded, specifically where nests that tend {{to be closer to}} each other were more genetically similar in comparison to other nests farther away.|$|E
5|$|In {{opposition}} to the formal theories of the generative school, functional theories of language propose that since language is fundamentally a tool, its structures are best analyzed and understood by reference to their functions. Formal theories of grammar seek to define the different elements of language and describe the way they relate <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>as</b> systems of formal rules or operations, while functional theories seek to define the functions performed by language and then relate them to the linguistic elements that carry them out. The framework of cognitive linguistics interprets language {{in terms of the}} concepts (which are sometimes universal, and sometimes specific to a particular language) which underlie its forms. Cognitive linguistics is primarily concerned with how the mind creates meaning through language.|$|E

5|$|Multiple {{sequence}} alignments {{can also}} be used to identify functionally important sites, such as binding sites, active sites, or sites corresponding to other key functions, by locating conserved domains. When looking at multiple sequence alignments, it is useful to consider different aspects of the sequences when comparing sequences. These aspects include identity, similarity, and homology. Identity means that the sequences have identical residues at their respective positions. On the other hand, similarity has to do with the sequences being compared having similar residues quantitatively. For example, in terms of nucleotide sequences, pyrimidines are considered similar <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>as</b> are purines. Similarity ultimately leads to homology, in that the more similar sequences are, the closer they are to being homologous. This similarity in sequences can then go on to help find common ancestry.|$|E
5|$|The {{light blue}} set {{are all part}} of the London Inner Ring Road, this section of which opened in 1756 as the New Road. From west to east the road runs as Euston Road to King's Cross, then Pentonville Road to the Angel, Islington. The three streets in the purple set all {{converge}} at Trafalgar Square, and the red set are all adjacent <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>as</b> part of the A4 road, a major road running west from Central London. The orange set is related to locations dealing with the police and law. The yellow set has an entertainment and nightlife-based theme; Leicester Square is known for cinemas and theatres, Coventry Street for clubs and restaurants, and Piccadilly for hotels. The streets in the green set have a background in retail and commercial properties.|$|E
25|$|In George Orwell's novel Animal Farm, {{the animals}} all refer <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> <b>as</b> comrade, {{as the story}} is a satirical look at the Russian Revolution.

25|$|During the 1970s and 1980s, comrade {{emerged as}} a popular revolutionary form of address in South Africa among those {{involved}} in anti-apartheid political activities.

25|$|The first solid {{particles}} were microscopic in size. These particles orbited the Sun {{in nearly}} circular orbits right next <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> <b>as</b> the gas {{from which they}} condensed. Gradually the gentle collisions allowed the flakes to stick together and make larger particles which, in turn, attracted more solid particles towards them. This process is known as accretion.|$|E

40|$|The {{wool and}} cotton {{spinning}} processes are quite different, regarding the opening, cleaning and blending operations. However, yarn formation with different parameters due to fiber characteristics (length and origin) {{could take place}} in the same machine. Factors involved are the drafting and twisting parameters. In this work, a preliminary study regarding the use of the ring spinning process to produce wool and cotton yarn is carried out concerning the drafting system, as {{this is one of the}} major differences between the process for the two materials. During the drafting operation, fibers must be moved relatively <b>to</b> <b>each</b> <b>others</b> <b>as</b> uniformly as possible, by overcoming friction between them. As they show different average lengths, it is necessary to provide means for automatic adjustment of the roller distance according to the type and length of fiber being processes...|$|R
