During one of the wiretapped {{recordings}} presented, [...] "typing sounds" [...] can be heard while Castor talks to a friend, though Castor denied memory of using the computer that day. Prosecutors argued the [...] "typing sounds" [...] were those {{of one of the}} several drafts Castor had written of the suicide note. Ashley had already testified to having witnessed her mother working on the computer on something she had hidden to prevent Ashley's seeing it. Fitzpatrick claimed this was the day Castor wrote the note, which had Castor's fingerprints but not Ashley's, to frame her daughter. He told the jury about the word antifreeze being written as [...] "anti-free" [...] in four places within the note and noted that Castor had also said [...] "anti-free" [...] during an interview. Castor said she had cut herself off while saying [...] "antifreeze" [...] because she had intended <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b>|$|E

50|$|There is a {{liberating}} element <b>to</b> <b>saying</b> <b>something</b> {{that nobody}} <b>else</b> {{would say in}} a civilized environment. Being disgusting or politically wrong {{in front of an}} audience can surprise and shock an audience. e.g. jokes about paedophiles.|$|R
40|$|No {{matter how}} well hidden our systems are and how well they do their magic unnoticed in the background, {{there are times when}} direct {{interaction}} between system and human is a necessity. As long as the interaction can take place unobtrusively and without techno-clutter, this is desirable. It is hard to picture a means of interaction less obtrusive and techno-cluttered than spoken communication on human terms. Spoken face-to-face communication is the most intuitive and robust form of communication between humans imaginable. In order to exploit such human spoken communication to its full potential as an interface between human and machine, we need a much better understanding of how the more human-like aspects of spoken communication work. A crucial aspect of face-to-face conversation is what people do and what they take into consideration in order to manage the flow of the interaction. For example, participants in a conversation {{have to be able to}} identify places where it is legitimate to begin to talk, as well as to avoid interrupting their interlocutors. The ability to indicate that you want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something,</b> that somebody <b>else</b> may start talking, o...|$|R

And how merciful it has all been. Such a calm holy close to the saintly life. May God bless and support all you who feel the bereavement! Even I feel that I would fain look for one more letter from him, but we have his [...] "Christian Year," [...] and other books. Is it not wonderful that all the wisdom and love and beauty of the [...] "Christian Year," [...] <b>to</b> <b>say</b> nothing of the exquisite and matured poetry, should {{have been given to}} him so early in life? Why, as I gather, the book was finished in the year 1825, though not published till 1827. He wrote it when he was only 33 years old, and for 45 years he lived after he was capable of such a work. Surely such a union of extreme learning, wisdom, and scholarship, with humility and purity of heart and life has very seldom been found. Everyone wishes <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> everyone <b>else</b> of one so dear to all, and no one can say what each and all feel. We ought indeed to be thankful, who not only have in common with all men his books, but the memory of what he was personally to us.|$|R

The lid looked like a {{beautiful}} golden flower and the handle was a coil of a dragon's tail. Rachel sat {{and looked at it}} rapt-eyed.|$|E

But this little death has made me ask myself the question, seriously, whether I wasn't too bent upon pleasing myself.

60|$|As he {{said this}} he met her eyes, and had a sudden persuasion that she knew {{exactly what it was}} the {{telegram}} had told him, and that she was shocked at this gala-like treatment of such terrible news. He hesitated, feeling that he had <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> that he was socially inadequate, and then he decided that at any cost he must get his face away from her staring eyes. She made no movement to turn away. She seemed to be taking him in, recording him, for repetition, greedily, with every fibre of her being.|$|E

6000|$|When he {{was gone}} she began to make very {{handsome}} and obliging representations of her goodwill to us both, {{but that it was}} without expectation of reward; that I had given her several valuable presents before--and so, indeed, I had; for, besides the piece of linen which I had given her at first, I had given her a suit of damask table-linen, of the linen I bought for my balls, viz., three table-cloths and three dozen of napkins; and at another time I gave her a little necklace of gold beads, and the like; but that is by the way. But she mentioned them, I say, and how she was obliged by me on many other occasions; that she was not in condition to show her gratitude any other way, not being able to make a suitable return; and that now we took from her all opportunity, to balance my former friendship, and left her more in debt than she was before. She spoke this in a very good kind of manner, in her own way, but which was very agreeable indeed, and had as much apparent sincerity, and I verily believe as real as was possible to be expressed; but I put a stop to it, and bade her say no more, but accept of what my spouse had given her, which was but in part, as she had heard him say. [...] "And put it up," [...] says I, [...] "and come and sit down here, and give me leave <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> to you on the same head, which my spouse and I have settled between ourselves in your behalf." [...] "What dost thee mean?" [...] says she, and blushed, and looked surprised, but did not stir. She was going to speak again, but I interrupted her, and told her she should make no more apologies of any kind whatever, for I had better things than all this to talk to her of; so I went on, and told her, that as she had been so friendly and kind to us on every occasion, and that her house was the lucky place where we came together, and that she knew I was from her own mouth acquainted in part with her circumstances, we were resolved she should be the better for us as long as she lived. Then I told what we had resolved to do for her, and that she had nothing more to do but to consult with me how it should be effectually secured for her, distinct from any of the effects which were her husband's; and that if her husband did so supply her that she could live comfortably, and not want it for bread or other necessaries, she should not make use of it, but lay up the income of it, and add it every year to the principal, so to increase the annual payment, which in time, and perhaps before she might come to want it, might double itself; that we were very willing whatever she should so lay up should be to herself, and whoever she thought fit after her; but that the forty pounds a year must return to our family after her life, which we both wished might be long and happy.|$|E
5000|$|While {{teaching}} at the University of Florida, Alfred Korzybski counseled his students to [...] eliminate the infinitive and verb forms of [...] "to be" [...] from their vocabulary, whereas a second group continued to use [...] "I am," [...] "You are," [...] "They are" [...] statements as usual. For example, instead of saying, [...] "I am depressed," [...] a student was asked to eliminate that emotionally primed verb and <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> such as, [...] "I feel depressed when ..."
