40|$|Abstract. ‘What is the {{sufficient}} {{reason for}} <b>the</b> inalienable <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> man?’ If man has an inalienable dignity, {{there has to}} be an ontologically sufficient reason for <b>the</b> inalienable <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> man. We find this ontologically sufficient reason for <b>the</b> inalienable <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> man in <b>the</b> ontological being and essence of man, according to our thesis. We argue that the human being is a ‘person in a body’. To be a person is an objective inestimable value, it is the objective value par excellence. We are persons from the beginning (conception), because it is not possible to become ‘someone’. We argue that the intrinsic preciousness of being a person is the ontologically sufficient reason for <b>the</b> inalienable <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> man. We do not want to separate values from beings; <b>the</b> inalienable <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human person is the heart of his being and essence. Therefore we should speak more often of man, insofar as he is inestimably precious. ...|$|R

5|$|Liechtenstein {{formally}} {{came into}} existence on 23 January 1719, when Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor decreed the lordship of Schellenberg and the countship of Vaduz united and raised to <b>the</b> <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> a principality. Liechtenstein {{was a part of}} the Holy Roman Empire until the Treaty of Pressburg was signed on 26 December 1805; this marked Liechtenstein's formal independence, though it was a member of the Confederation of the Rhine and the German Confederation afterwards. While Liechtenstein was still closely aligned with Austria-Hungary until World War I, it realigned its politics and its customs and monetary institutions with Switzerland instead. Having been a constitutional monarchy since 1921, Hans-Adam II demanded more influence in Liechtenstein's politics in the early 21st century, which he was granted in a referendum held on 16 March 2003, effectively making Liechtenstein a semi-constitutional monarchy again. However, the constitutional changes also provide for the possibility of a referendum to abolish the monarchy entirely. The current monarch is Hans-Adam II, who turned over the day-to-day governing decisions to his son and heir Alois, Hereditary Prince of Liechtenstein on 15 August 2004.|$|E

5|$|Shareholders in the LSWR were {{concerned}} {{at the impact}} the cemetery scheme {{would have on the}} normal operations of the railway. At a shareholders' meeting in August 1852 concerns were raised about the impact of funeral trains on normal traffic and of the secrecy in which negotiations between the LSWR and the promoters of the cemetery were conducted. The LSWR management pledged that no concessions would be made to the cemetery operators, other than promising them the use of one train each day. Charles Blomfield, Bishop of London was hostile in general to railway funeral schemes, arguing that the noise and speed of the railways was incompatible with the solemnity of the Christian burial service. Blomfield also considered it inappropriate that the families of people from very different backgrounds would potentially have to share a train, and felt that it demeaned <b>the</b> <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> the deceased for the bodies of respectable members of the community to be carried on a train also carrying the bodies and relatives of those who had led immoral lives.|$|E
5|$|The poet, {{of whose}} works I have {{undertaken}} the revision, may now begin to assume <b>the</b> <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> an ancient, and claim {{the privilege of}} established fame and prescriptive veneration. He has long outlived his century, the term commonly fixed as the test of literature merit. Whatever advantages he might once derive from personal allusions, local customs, or temporary opinions, have for many years been lost; and every topic of merriment, or motive of sorrow, which the modes of artificial life afforded him, now only obscure the scenes which they once illuminated. The effects of favour and competition are at an end; the tradition of his friendships and his enmities has perished; his works support no opinion with arguments, nor supply any faction with invectives; they can neither indulge vanity nor gratify malignity; but are read without any other reason than the desire of pleasure, and are therefore praised only as pleasure is obtained; yet, thus unassisted by interest or passion, they have past through variation of taste and changes of manners, and, as they devolved {{from one generation to}} another, have received new honours at every transmission.|$|E
