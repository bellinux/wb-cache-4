5|$|Since {{the second}} half of the 18th century, when Brazil was still a colony, the {{government}} had attempted <b>to</b> <b>gather</b> <b>data</b> regarding the population. However, few captaincies (later called provinces) collected the requested information. After independence the government instituted a commission for statistics in an 1829 decree with a mandate to hold a national census. The commission was a failure and was disbanded in 1834. In the ensuing years, provincial governments were tasked with collecting census information, but their census reports were often incomplete or not submitted at all. In 1851, another attempt at a nationwide census failed when rioting broke out. This was the result of the erroneous belief among Brazilians of mixed-race descent that the survey was a subterfuge designed to enslave anyone having African blood.|$|E

5|$|Elements of D.Gray-man first {{appeared}} in Hoshino's one-shot title, Zone, in which the Akuma, the exorcists, and the Millennium Earl plan to end the world. Although Allen Walker is male, his character is based on Zone female protagonist. Lavi {{is based on the}} protagonist of Hoshino's planned series, Book-man, that she originally wanted to write. Other characters, such as the Millennium Earl, Lenalee Lee, and Komui Lee, are based on real people whom Hoshino has not specifically identified; some are well-known scientists, and Komui is based on Hoshino's boss. The character of Yu Kanda, based on a samurai, was created to vary D.Gray-mans Western setting. Hoshino found the design of some characters difficult early in the series. In 2011, the author visited New York for research, and believed that the city had greatly influenced her work. Hoshino visited cemeteries, and was deeply impressed by her guides' comments at Ground zero of the World Trade Center (left after the September 11 attacks). She said that she would like to spend more time in New York <b>to</b> <b>gather</b> <b>data</b> for the series.|$|E

Such assessment looks at certain areas, such as general appearance and behavior, mood and affect, perception, comprehension, orientation, insight, memory, and content of communication. One psychiatric example of a formal interview is the mental status examination, which is often used in psychiatry as a screening tool for treatment or further testing.|$|E
25|$|Patent {{infringement}} typically {{is caused}} by using or selling a patented invention without permission from the patent holder.

25|$|As {{revealed}} in 358/2 Days, Vexen experiments {{with the creation}} of Replicas, the first of which is Xion. In Chain of Memories, Vexen occupies the basement of Castle Oblivion with Lexaeus and Zexion, who he sides with to prevent Marluxia's plan to overthrow the Organization, later being assigned to personally investigate Marluxia's intentions. He battles Riku in order <b>to</b> <b>gather</b> <b>data</b> to create a Replica of him, and allows Naminé to manipulate the Replica's memories to test Sora's worth. After the Replica fails to defeat Sora and Marluxia threatens to reveal the shortcoming to Xemnas, Vexen fights Sora himself and gives him a card to access Twilight Town in Castle Oblivion with the intention of revealing to Sora both Roxas' existence and Marluxia's plan. As a result, Marluxia declares Vexen a traitor and sends Axel to eliminate him, which Axel does by incinerating Vexen before he can reveal the truth to Sora, mainly to gain Marluxia's trust and prevent him from using Vexen's Replica research. Vexen's death leads to Even's restoration (two years later) in Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance.|$|E
25|$|A {{large body}} of {{international}} research has shown the efficacy of methadone maintenance treatment programmes {{for the treatment of}} drug addiction and subsequent reduction in HIV risk behaviors. In acknowledgment of this evidence, in 2004 the Chinese government called for the use of such practices to mitigate HIV transmission. Immediately, under the governance of the Ministries of Health and Public Security and the State Food and Drug Administration, a pilot study of eight clinics in five provinces was done. Inclusion in the programme required: (1) several failed attempts to quit the use of heroin, (2) at least two terms in a detoxification centre, (3) age at least 20 years, (4) being a registered local resident of the area in which the clinic is located, and (5) being of good civil character. Those testing HIV positive need only fulfill criteria 4 and 5. To monitor the progress of the clinics, a database was established <b>to</b> <b>gather</b> <b>data</b> on demographics, medical issues, drug use, and other information about the patients. These data were assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months, and indicated reductions in heroin use, drug-related crime, and unemployment in those who received methadone maintenance treatment.|$|E
25|$|Within {{five minutes}} of launch, the first loan {{application}} was processed, and within a week the first loan default occurred. The subsequent months of operation showed increased demand, but traditional methods of credit risk assessment proved inadequate and the company experienced default rates of around 50%. The company used this period <b>to</b> <b>gather</b> <b>data</b> on customer behaviour and began developing their own proprietary risk technology. The full market launch of Wonga.com was July 2008 and 100,000 loans were reached by June 2009. Through the experience of processing these loans, the company developed technologies which began to dramatically reduce the percentage of defaults. In July 2009 Wonga raised a further £13.9m of funding in a Round B led by Accel Partners, Greylock Partners and Dawn Capital which improved the technology and the launch in December 2009 of the first end-to-end iPhone credit app. In 2009 the company was already profitable and default rates were below 10%, less than the average for credit cards. A third round of funding was completed in 2011, for £73m led by Oak Investment Partners including additional investors Meritech Capital Partners and the Wellcome Trust. By the end of 2011, Wonga's technology could reliably reject two-thirds of applications and predict to 93% accuracy {{the ability of a}} customer to repay a loan. In May 2012, they opened a business in South Africa offering consumer loans. The Daily Telegraph reported in November 2012 that Wonga were also testing their technology in Canada.|$|E

500|$|The team {{opted not}} to reuse the {{technology}} of Flight Unlimited. Hantzopoulos learned from Blackley {{that it was necessary}} to recreate the [...] "visceral feel" [...] of real flight, but Blackley's CFDs system was [...] "all black box spaghetti code" [...] that the team could not understand. Programmer Jim Berry, who had previously worked on simulators such as Falcon 4.0, wrote new physics code based on force vector calculations to replace the CFDs system. <b>To</b> <b>gather</b> <b>data</b> for the new physics, Hantzopoulos and Berry flew in real-world planes with designer Ed Tatro and aerobatic pilot Michael Goulian. James Fleming coded Flight Unlimited IIs new terrain renderer, ZOAR. Flight Unlimited uses distance fog to limit visible terrain, but this causes pop-in issues that the team sought to avoid in the sequel. Instead of removing textures that exceed the draw distance, the new engine uses mipmapping to lower the polygon count of distant terrain. This increases the viewable area and allowed the team to use fog as an atmospheric effect, rather than as a [...] "crutch".|$|E

500|$|From {{the end of}} the War, {{a growing}} belief among women's {{organizations}} was the notion that all women faced similar problems as subordinates to men and that combining their interests might lead to gains. At the International Council of Women (ICW) conference held in Washington in 1925, the sentiment was expressed by Lady Aberdeen, welcoming all women to the [...] "sisterhood, of whatever creed, party, section or class they may belong". In 1927, Stevens and Alice Paul undertook a massive study of how laws affected women's nationality; studying for example, if they lost their nationality by marrying or even became stateless. Stevens met with feminists throughout Europe and held public meetings <b>to</b> <b>gather</b> <b>data,</b> including Dr. Luisa Baralt of Havana, Dr. Ellen Gleditsch of Oslo, Chrystal Macmillan and Sybil Thomas, Viscountess Rhondda of the UK, the Marquesa del Ter of Spain, Maria Vérone of France and Hélène Vacaresco of Romania, as well as various officers of the International Federation of University Women and others. Paul reviewed the laws of each country. Together, they compiled a monumental report, which indexed all laws controlling women's nationality from every country in its native language and then translated each law on an accompanying page. Tables were provided for easy comparison and a synopsis of the laws was given. The report was initially prepared for a meeting that was to take place at the League of Nations in 1930 to discuss codification of international laws. Stevens felt that nationality of women should be included in that discussion and spearheaded the research, believing [...] "feminism should strive for equal rights for women, and that women should be considered first and foremost as human beings." [...] In September 1927, she attended a preliminary meeting of the League of Nations in Geneva and obtained their unanimous support of her proposal. She continued meeting with women and gathering data until January 1928, when she attended the Pan-American Conference in Havana. Stevens convinced the governing body of the Pan American Union to create the Inter-American Commission of Women (...) (CIM) on 4 April 1928.|$|E
