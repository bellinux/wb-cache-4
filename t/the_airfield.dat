5|$|The 24th Brigade's {{goal for}} 11 June was to secure <b>the</b> <b>airfield</b> area. The 2/43rd Battalion patrolled {{to the north}} and west of <b>the</b> <b>airfield</b> during the day, meeting only light opposition. In contrast, the 2/28th Battalion (which was tasked with {{advancing}} into Labuan's interior) encountered entrenched Japanese forces, and it became clear that it was facing {{the main body of the}} island's garrison. Norman manoeuvred his companies to push the Japanese back, but the rate of advance was slow. <b>The</b> <b>airfield</b> engineers of No. 62 Wing RAAF were also landed during 11 June to begin work on returning No. 1 Strip to service; reconstruction of <b>the</b> <b>airfield</b> began the next day.|$|E
5|$|The Marines ashore on Guadalcanal {{initially}} {{concentrated on}} forming a defense perimeter around <b>the</b> <b>airfield,</b> moving the landed supplies within the perimeter, and finishing <b>the</b> <b>airfield.</b> Vandegrift placed his 11,000 troops on Guadalcanal {{in a loose}} perimeter around the Lunga Point area. In four days of intense effort, the supplies were moved from the landing beach into dispersed dumps within the perimeter. Work began on <b>the</b> <b>airfield</b> immediately, mainly using captured Japanese equipment. On August 12, <b>the</b> <b>airfield</b> was named Henderson Field after Major Lofton Henderson, a Marine aviator {{who had been killed}} at the Battle of Midway. Captured Japanese stock increased the total supply of food to 14 days worth. To conserve the limited food supplies, the Allied troops were limited to two meals per day.|$|E
5|$|A World War II {{plane crash}} site is also near <b>the</b> <b>airfield.</b>|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>airfield's</b> runways {{were soon}} put {{to good use}} by the newly formed Andreas Racing Association for {{motorcycle}} racing. The Association's emblem is that of the Three Legs of Man, set against the [...] "A" [...] layout of <b>the</b> <b>airfield's</b> runways.|$|R
25|$|As a {{necessary}} preliminary step for Dracula, IV Corps {{was ordered to}} capture <b>the</b> <b>airfields</b> at Toungoo, regardless of cost, so that air cover could be provided for <b>the</b> invasion. <b>The</b> <b>airfields</b> were captured by the Indian 5th Division on 22 April.|$|R
5000|$|Rangoon was {{initially}} defended relatively successfully against Japanese air raids, by small RAF detachments reinforced by {{a squadron of}} the American Volunteer Group, {{better known as the}} [...] "Flying Tigers". The majority of <b>the</b> <b>airfields</b> were between Rangoon and the Axis advance and as the Japanese gained use of <b>the</b> <b>airfields</b> in Tenasserim, <b>the</b> amount of warning <b>the</b> Rangoon <b>airfields</b> could get of attack decreased, and they became more and more untenable.|$|R
5|$|Eventually Kwajalein Island was selected, {{as it was}} 4,800miles from California, {{perfect for}} ICBMs, and already had a US Navy base with {{considerable}} housing stocks and an airstrip. The Zeus site, known as the Kwajalein Test Site, was officially established on 1 October 1960. As it grew in size, it {{eventually led to the}} entire island complex being handed over to the Army from the Navy on 1 July 1964. The site took up a considerable amount of the empty land to the north side of <b>the</b> <b>airfield.</b> The launchers were located on the far southwestern corner of the island, with the Target Tracking Radars, Missile Tracking Radars (MTRs) and various control sites and generators running along the northern side of <b>the</b> <b>airfield.</b> The ZAR transmitter and receiver were some distance away, off the northeastern edge of <b>the</b> <b>airfield.</b>|$|E
5|$|From February 1922 <b>the</b> <b>airfield,</b> {{which was}} in use as an {{emergency}} landing ground, had an illuminated T {{as part of the}} illumination of the London-Paris airway. Also at <b>the</b> <b>airfield</b> were coloured lamps connected to an anemometer to indicate wind strength, green for no wind, white for moderate wind and red to indicate strong wind.|$|E
5|$|Hargest and his brigade {{took part}} in the {{subsequent}} Battle of Crete in May. The 2nd New Zealand Division was under the command of Brigadier Edward Puttick due to Freyberg taking command of Creforce, which consisted of all the Allied troops on Crete. Puttick gave Hargest's brigade the task of defending <b>the</b> <b>airfield</b> at Maleme and its easterly approaches. The 21st Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Leslie Andrew, guarded <b>the</b> <b>airfield</b> itself and a neighbouring hill, Point 107, with the other two battalions of the brigade positioned further east while Hargest situated his headquarters at some distance from <b>the</b> <b>airfield.</b> Within days of arriving on Crete, the Allied positions began to be the subject of strafing and bombing attacks by German planes as a precursor to an airborne invasion mounted by German paratroopers of the 1st Parachute Division. The bombing triggered in Hargest an occurrence of his shell shock, rendering him lethargic and confused.|$|E
25|$|The main landing came on 26 December 1943 when U.S. Marines landed {{either side}} of the peninsula. The western landing force cut the coastal road, while the main force, landing on the eastern side, {{advanced}} north towards <b>the</b> <b>airfields.</b> Their advance was slowed by the swampy terrain, however, initially resistance was light. A Japanese counterattack briefly slowed the advance, however, by 30 December <b>the</b> <b>airfields</b> were firmly under Marine control. Further fighting followed into early January 1944 as the U.S. troops extended their perimeter south from <b>the</b> <b>airfields,</b> with mopping up operations in the vicinity continuing into April 1944.|$|R
50|$|Three <b>Airfields</b> are in <b>the</b> {{vicinity}} of Jüterbog: <b>the</b> Jüterbog <b>Airfield</b> few km to the west, <b>the</b> Oehna <b>Airfield</b> 10 km to the south, and <b>the</b> Reinsdorf <b>Airfield</b> 15 km south-east of Jüterbog.|$|R

5|$|In 1940, <b>the</b> <b>airfield</b> was {{occupied}} by the Royal Air Force, who erected Nissen huts and cleared the area of obstacles as {{it was intended to}} use the area as an Emergency Landing Ground. Three pillboxes were erected around the airfield's perimeter. Between March and June 1940 <b>the</b> <b>airfield</b> was used by No. 15 Elementary Flying Training School at RAF Redhill as a relief landing ground. Knotley Hall was again requisitioned for use as the officers' quarters, although the tennis courts were off-limits.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, <b>the</b> <b>airfield</b> was {{designated}} as Stützpunkt 134 Paderborn, housing defence units {{as part of}} the Atlantic Wall coastal fortifications. The units were equipped with 10.5 cm leFH 18 howitzers. During the winter of 1943–44, 10.5 cm leFH 324(f) howitzers replaced the leFH 18s. A number of concrete bunkers were constructed to house the guns, which were still standing around <b>the</b> <b>airfield</b> in October 2007. Following Operation Overlord {{at the start of the}} Allied invasion of western Europe, the Germans committed various acts of sabotage on departure from Saint-Inglevert.|$|E
5|$|In April 2013 the Ministry of Defence {{announced}} {{a proposal to}} increase the number of private flights from 7,000 to 12,000 per year as part of plans to increase the income generated by <b>the</b> <b>airfield.</b> The number of flights would be limited to 40 per day, and the increase would be phased in over three years to 2016. <b>The</b> <b>airfield</b> was mostly used for VIP jets, with about 3,800 miilitary flights a year.|$|E
50|$|Luftflotte 3's radio {{intercepts}} of Bomber Command's transmissions helped pinpoint <b>the</b> operational <b>airfields</b> in Eastern England. I./NJG 2 aircraft {{could then}} scramble {{to be over}} <b>the</b> <b>airfields</b> at <b>the</b> predicted times of the bomber's return.|$|R

5|$|In early December, the US {{military}} personnel occupying the base, {{along with all}} military equipment, were shifted to the Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan via US military aircraft. On 10 December, Pakistani troops from the Frontier Corps took full control of <b>the</b> <b>airfield</b> as scheduled, and by 11 December all remaining American staff were evacuated. Upon establishing control of <b>the</b> <b>airfield,</b> the United States flag {{was removed from the}} base and replaced with the flag of Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|Joachim Roth's {{low-level}} navigation {{had been}} extremely accurate. He had navigated his unit to within two minutes flying {{time from the}} target without interception, over unfamiliar enemy territory, on time and exactly on the planned route. But as the Dorniers neared <b>the</b> <b>airfield</b> they noticed {{that there was no}} smoke, or signs of damage. They expected to be polishing off a damaged fighter station. As the Germans burst over <b>the</b> <b>airfield</b> the air was suddenly filled with tracer rounds as the Dorniers' gunners engaged the Bofors and British AAA defences.|$|E
5|$|Starting in 1946 <b>the</b> <b>airfield</b> {{was used}} by civil {{aviation}} during the construction of nearby Heathrow Airport. During this period, Northolt became a major base for British European Airways, which used the nearby Bourne School as its headquarters. Other airlines including Aer Lingus, Alitalia, Scandinavian Airlines System and Swissair used <b>the</b> <b>airfield</b> for scheduled services across Europe.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese {{were taken}} by surprise, and by nightfall on 8 August the 11,000 Allied troops—under the command of Lieutenant General Alexander Vandegrift—secured Tulagi and nearby small islands {{as well as an}} {{airfield}} under construction at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal. The Allies later renamed <b>the</b> <b>airfield</b> Henderson Field. To protect <b>the</b> <b>airfield,</b> the U.S. Marines established a perimeter defense around Lunga Point. Additional reinforcements over the next two months later increased the number of U.S. troops at Lunga Point to more than 20,000.|$|E

50|$|Also {{nearby is}} a disused 1500 m long {{airstrip}} {{which was used}} by the United States Army Air Corps during World War II and associated with <b>the</b> Caversham <b>Airfield</b> at Middle Swan. Like <b>the</b> Caversham <b>Airfield,</b> <b>the</b> Mooliabeenee <b>Airfield</b> was later used as a motor racing track. Local car clubs regularly use the site for motorkhana events.|$|R
25|$|In later years, {{commentators}} have maintained that India's intense {{air strikes against}} <b>the</b> <b>airfields</b> were uncalled-for, since none of the targeted airports had any military capabilities and did not cater to any military aircraft. As such, <b>the</b> <b>airfields</b> were defenceless civilian targets. To this day, the Indian navy continues to control the Dabolim Airport, although this is now used as a civilian airport as well.|$|R
5|$|The {{airborne}} division's next {{objective was}} now <b>the</b> <b>airfield</b> at Gioia del Colle. The Royal Air Force needed <b>the</b> <b>airfield</b> {{to bring in}} fighter aircraft from Sicily and support the landings at Salerno, which had not gone as expected. The Germans continued their withdrawal, and Gioia was reached over {{the night of the}} 16/17September, by the 10th and 156th Parachute battalions. The Royal Air Force took over <b>the</b> <b>airfield</b> and 48 hours later, six squadrons were flying from the base in support of Allied operations. Between 20 and 24September, the 1st Airborne Division was ordered to halt and construct defences on the approaches to Taranto, due to concerns that the Germans might launch a counterattack against the overextended unit.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>airfield</b> is very {{isolated}} in northwest Utah, {{sitting in the}} middle of a vast wasteland miles away from any major population center. It is probably for this reason, and the dry hot climate, that much of <b>the</b> <b>airfield</b> remains today. Still-extant facilities include the vast runway system, numerous ramps, taxiways, dispersal pads, and most of the original hangars (including the Enola Gay B-29 hangar). Most of the hospital complex and many barracks remain, as does a chow hall, chapel, swimming pool and many other World War II-era buildings.|$|E
5|$|After their {{training}} had been completed, on 17 November the sappers were transported to an RAF airfield at Skitten in Scotland, with the operation scheduled to commence two days later. On {{the evening of}} 19 November, Group Captain Cooper, {{with the aid of}} a Norwegian meteorologist and regular reports from the SOE agents stationed near the landing zone, decided that although the weather was not perfect, it would be best to launch the operation that night; Cooper believed that if it were delayed, the weather might deteriorate on subsequent days and prevent the operation from being conducted entirely. The first aircraft–glider combination took off from <b>the</b> <b>airfield</b> at 17:50, with the second following at 18:10; after circling <b>the</b> <b>airfield</b> several times the two combinations headed out across the North Sea towards their objective.|$|E
