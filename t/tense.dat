5|$|It {{is likely}} that the tonal {{lowering}} seen in this particular example is related to the low tone nasal prefix found in future <b>tense</b> constructions in some other Senufo languages. In fact, Supyire shows a similar phenomenon in future <b>tense</b> constructions with a direct object (in other future <b>tense</b> constructions, a low tone nasal is found).|$|E
5|$|Past <b>tense</b> {{is marked}} by the preverbal {{particle}} ná (high tone, {{as opposed to the}} low tone continuative particle). Future <b>tense</b> {{is marked by}} the particle wè. Simple sentences without a preverbal <b>tense</b> particle are interpreted as recent past (sometimes called immediate). If aspect marking is absent, simple sentences are generally interpreted as completive.|$|E
5|$|Verb {{morphology}} in Wagiman {{is highly}} irregular. Of the small inventory of inflecting verbs, many {{have their own}} unique <b>tense</b> suffixes, while other <b>tense</b> suffixes are common to several verbs, and while some rudimentary verb classes can be identified - stance verbs always take the past <b>tense</b> suffix -nginy , for instance - the <b>tense</b> suffixes must be learned for each individual verb.|$|E

5|$|The prefixes on {{the other}} hand, are regular for each verb, {{although}} the complete paradigm of verb prefixes is highly complex. They encode three variables: person, number and <b>tense,</b> and are not segmentable; one prefix cannot be separated into the three parts. Ngani- for example, encodes second-person singular agent ('you'), first-person singular patient/undergoer ('me') as well as past <b>tense.</b>|$|E
5|$|The verbal prefix {{contains}} {{information about}} the person and number of the subject, sometimes also the person and number of the object, as well as obligatory {{information about the}} <b>tense</b> of the clause. Furthermore, a verbal suffix conveys further information regarding <b>tense</b> and aspect. While {{only a small number}} of <b>tense</b> and aspect affixes exist, the interplay between those in the verbal prefix and in the suffix, can generate more highly specified temporal and aspectual clauses.|$|E

40|$|In hindi <b>tenses</b> and moods can {{be divided}} into two groups: root <b>tenses</b> and moods and auxiliated <b>tenses</b> and moods.

Tamazight verbs have at their core a stem, {{modified}} by prefixes, suffixes, moveable affixes, circumfixes, and ablaut. The prefixes indicate voice, <b>tense,</b> aspect, and polarity, while the suffixes indicate mood (normal, horatory, or imperative). Subject markers are circumfixed to the verb, while object marking and satellite framing are accomplished via either prefixing or suffixing depending on environment Some verb forms {{are accompanied by}} ablaut, and sometimes metathesis.|$|E

The goal of research, {{which is based on}} processed data from Czech National Corpus, is to find out, how the czech translators translate complex <b>tenses</b> from Latvian to Czech and also how latvian translators translate verbs in past, present and future <b>tenses</b> from Czech to Latvian...|$|R
50|$|The ez forms (NOM.) {{are used}} as {{subjects}} {{in the present and}} future <b>tenses.</b> They are also used as subjects in past <b>tenses</b> when the verb is an intransitive one. They {{are used as}} objects in past <b>tenses</b> when employed with a transitive verb. The min forms (OBL.) are used with any preposition or postposition. They are also employed as objects in present and future <b>tenses,</b> but as subjects of the transitive verbs in past <b>tenses.</b>|$|R
5|$|Tamil verbs {{are also}} inflected {{through the use}} of suffixes. A typical Tamil verb form will have a number of suffixes, which show person, number, mood, <b>tense,</b> and voice.|$|E
5|$|The Imperfect {{portrays the}} verb as an {{incomplete}} action {{along with the}} process by which it came about, either as an event that has not begun, an event that has begun but is still in the process, or a habitual or cyclic action that is on an ongoing repetition. The Imperfect can also express modal or conditional verbs, as well as commands in the Jussive and Cohortative moods. While often future <b>tense,</b> it also has uses in the past and present under certain contexts. Biblical Hebrew <b>tense</b> is not necessarily reflected in the verb forms per se, but rather is determined primarily by context. The Participles also reflect ongoing or continuous actions, but are also subject to the context determining their <b>tense.</b>|$|E
5|$|Verbs are a {{class of}} word in Wagiman which {{contains}} fewer than 50 members. As it is a closed class, no more verbs are possible. They are often monosyllabic verb roots and all are vowel-final. Wagiman verbs obligatorily inflect for person and number of core arguments, and for the <b>tense</b> and aspect of the clause. A small set of verbs may take a non-finite suffix -yh, in which {{it may not be}} further inflected for person or <b>tense.</b> That non-finite verb must then co-occur with another auxiliary verb.|$|E

5|$|Biblical Hebrew had {{a typical}} Semitic {{morphology}} with nonconcatenative morphology, arranging Semitic roots into patterns to form words. Biblical Hebrew distinguished two genders (masculine, feminine), three numbers (singular, plural, and uncommonly, dual). Verbs were marked for voice and mood, {{and had two}} conjugations which may have indicated aspect and/or <b>tense</b> (a matter of debate). The <b>tense</b> or aspect of verbs was also influenced by the conjugation , in the so-called waw-consecutive construction. Default word order was verb–subject–object, and verbs inflected for the number, gender, and person of their subject. Pronominal suffixes could be appended to verbs (to indicate object) or nouns (to indicate possession), and nouns had special construct states for use in possessive constructions.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tenses</b> bold an {{important}} part in teaching and learning English. When someone is using the wrong <b>tenses,</b> the other will have misinterpretation. Since <b>tenses,</b> in the reality, are boring and difficult, the teachers must be able to vary the teaching technique in order to help the students master the <b>tenses</b> very well among other by using games and songs. To help the students improve their mastery in English, especially the <b>tenses,</b> some of them join an English course. By joining the course, They hope that they can master the English better then we they get the English subject at school, because they only have limited time for this subject at school. In this thesis, the writer did some observation in "JOY" English course. (She did the observation for one month (5 meetings), but she found <b>tenses</b> as the subject only in the first three meetings). From the observations, the writer found that games and songs are very helpful for the teacher to teach the <b>tenses</b> without the students feeling pressured to learn the <b>tenses.</b> From the three meetings that had <b>tenses,</b> there were only two meetings that used one game and song. When the teacher did not give the students song or games they could hardly understand the <b>tenses.</b> They asked the teacher to repeat the explanations and often made mistakes in using the <b>tenses.</b> Since the writer did not observe the student’ tests results in teaching <b>tenses,</b> the writer hopes that someone will make a study on the students' tests results, particularly the tests for <b>tenses</b> to discover the effectiveness of games and songs...|$|R

5|$|In {{this very}} <b>tense</b> {{atmosphere}} {{it was decided}} that a plebiscite would be held in the area asking people which country this territory should join. Plebiscite commissioners arrived there at the end of January 1920, and after analysing the situation {{declared a state of emergency}} in the territory on 19 May 1920. The situation in the area remained very <b>tense,</b> with mutual intimidation, acts of terror, beatings and even killings. A plebiscite could not be held in this atmosphere. On 10 July both sides renounced the idea of a plebiscite and entrusted the Conference of Ambassadors with the decision. Eventually, on 28 July 1920, by a decision of the Spa Conference, Czechoslovakia received 58.1% of the area of Cieszyn Silesia, containing 67.9% of the population. It was this territory that became known from the Polish standpoint as Zaolzie – the Olza River marked the boundary between the Polish and Czechoslovak parts of the territory.|$|E
