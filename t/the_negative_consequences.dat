5|$|All of McCain's {{family members}} are on good terms with him, and he has defended them against some of <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>consequences</b> of his {{high-profile}} political lifestyle. His family's military tradition extends to the latest generation: son John Sidney IV ("Jack") graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 2009, becoming the fourth generation John S. McCain to do so, and is a helicopter pilot; son James served two tours with the Marines in the Iraq War; and son Doug flew jets in the navy. His daughter Meghan became a blogging and Twittering presence in {{the debate about the}} future of the Republican Party following the 2008 elections, and showed some of his maverick tendencies.|$|E
5|$|Others {{point out}} that in philosophy, a {{critical}} and skeptical reaction followed on from the Condemnations 1277. Since the theologians had asserted that Aristotle had erred in theology, and pointed out <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>consequences</b> of uncritical acceptance of his ideas, scholastic philosophers such as Duns Scotus and William of Ockham (both Franciscan friars) believed he might also be mistaken in matters of philosophy. The Scotist and Ockhamist movements set Scholasticism on a different path from that of Albert the Great and Aquinas, and the theological motivation of their philosophical arguments {{can be traced back}} to 1277. They stressed the traditional Franciscan themes of Divine Omnipotence and Divine Freedom, which formed part of Ockham's first thesis.|$|E

To minimise <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>consequences</b> of Switzerland's {{isolation from the}} rest of Europe, Bern and Brussels signed seven bilateral agreements to further liberalise trade ties. These agreements were signed in 1999 and took effect in 2001. This first series of bilateral agreements included the free movement of persons. A second series covering nine areas was signed in 2004 and has since been ratified, which includes the Schengen Treaty and the Dublin Convention besides others. They continue to discuss further areas for cooperation.|$|E

40|$|The Casual Connection as an Element of the Legal Liability Abstract of Dissertation The {{concept of}} the casual {{connection}} is not understood in a uniform manner, although it represents the principal legal institute that enables functioning of the law. However, the nature and purpose of the legal liability in the Czech jurisprudence remains the object of discussions, and this {{is supported by the}} fact that the positive legal regulation uses the concept of liability at random. Within the vindicative {{concept of the}} legal liability as the secondary legal liability arising as the result of the violation of the primary legal liability, we can discern several basic elements. It is particularly the violation of the legal liability, <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>consequence</b> consisting in <b>the</b> violation of or a threat to the legal values, as well as the casual connection between the wrongful act and <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>consequence.</b> <b>The</b> causal connection is the principal element of the legal liability which represents the objective element whereby a wrongful act may be attributed to a certain subject. Thus, the causal connection transmits the penal liability to the subject concerned. Mostly, it is not difficult to find the element of violation of the legal liability and <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>consequence.</b> However, <b>the</b> situation is more complicated in the [...] ...|$|R

5|$|Scholars have {{discussed}} Not in Front of the Children in academic journal articles, and characterized it {{as a work}} which balances education policy against <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>consequences</b> of censorship. In an article for Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy, Middlebury College women's studies professor Deborah Grant compared the book to Harmful to Minors by Judith Levine. Grant characterized both books as significant works emphasizing the importance of allowing youths access to informative educational resources. She classed Heins' monograph as a thorough and important survey of the chronology of censorship. Perry L. Glanzer wrote in English Journal that Heins had a valid viewpoint to engage students on controversial topics in literature classes, and he added {{it was necessary to}} teach them all perspectives of a debate. Ellen P. Goodman wrote for Berkeley Technology Law Journal that Heins was critical of prior articles which attempted to show negative impact from violence as portrayed on television programs.|$|E
5|$|The {{agricultural}} trade boom in Eastern Europe {{showed the}} first signs of the approaching crisis in the 1580s, when food prices stopped increasing. It was followed by a gradual decline in agricultural products prices, a price depression, initially present in Western Europe. <b>The</b> <b>negative</b> <b>consequences</b> of this process on folwark economies of the East had reached its culmination {{in the second half of}} the 17th century. Further economic aggravation resulted from Europe-wide devaluation of the currency around 1620, caused by the influx of silver from the Western Hemisphere. At that time however massive amounts of Polish grain were still exported through Danzig (Gdańsk). The Commonwealth nobility took a variety of steps to combat the crisis and keep up high production levels, burdening in particular the serfs with further heavy obligations. The nobles were also forcibly buying or taking over properties of the more affluent thus far peasant categories, a phenomenon especially pronounced from the mid 17th century.|$|E

25|$|Alcoholism {{in family}} systems {{refers to the}} {{conditions}} in families that enable alcoholism, {{and the effects of}} alcoholic behavior by one or more family members {{on the rest of the}} family. Mental health professionals are increasingly considering alcoholism and addiction as diseases that flourish in and are enabled by family systems. Family members react to the alcoholic with particular behavioral patterns. They may enable the addiction to continue by shielding the addict from <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>consequences</b> of his actions. Such behaviors are referred to as codependence. In this way, the alcoholic is said to suffer from the disease of addiction, whereas the family members suffer from the disease of codependence.|$|E
25|$|Several studies {{investigated}} {{factors that}} influence the decision to plagiarize. For example, a panel study with students from German universities found that academic procrastination predicts the frequency plagiarism conducted within six months followed the measurement of academic procrastination. It {{has been argued that}} by plagiarizing students cope with <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>consequences</b> that result from academic procrastination such as poor grades. Another study found that plagiarism is more frequent if students perceive plagiarism as beneficial and if they have the opportunity to plagiarize. When students had expected higher sanctions and when they had internalized social norms that define plagiarism as very objectionable, plagiarism was less likely to occur.|$|E
25|$|Procrastination is {{considerably}} more widespread in students {{than in the}} general population, with over 70 percent of students reporting procrastination for assignments at some point. A 2014 panel study from Germany among several thousand university students found that increasing academic procrastination increases the frequency of seven different forms of academic misconduct, i.e., using fraudulent excuses, plagiarism, copying from someone else in exams, using forbidden means in exams, carrying forbidden means into exams, copying parts of homework from others, fabrication or falsification of data and the variety of academic misconduct. This study argues that academic misconduct {{can be seen as}} a means to cope with <b>the</b> <b>negative</b> <b>consequences</b> of academic procrastination such as performance impairment.|$|E

5000|$|Anxiety for the {{purposes}} of anxiety/uncertainty management can be described as an apprehension based on <b>the</b> fear of <b>negative</b> <b>consequences.</b> It is more prevalent in intergroup relations because there is an added fear of appearing prejudiced when dealing with an outgroup. Similar to uncertainty, Gudykunst postulates that effective communication relies on managing anxiety between minimum and maximum thresholds. Once we reach our upper limit for anxiety, virtually all of our attention focuses on its source and not on effective communication. The concept of managing levels anxiety can be compared to managing eustress and distress to achieve optimum performance. The positive benefit of the optimum amount of anxiety is trust, or [...] "confidence that one will find what is desired from another rather than what is feared" [...] <b>The</b> <b>negative</b> <b>consequence</b> is avoidance. If we are overcome by anxiety we will simply choose not to communicate.|$|R
