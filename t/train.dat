5|$|A severe {{fire at the}} Grand Central {{station on}} April 21, 1964, {{destroyed}} the demonstration <b>train</b> and manual operation had been restored since. The fire began under a shuttle <b>train</b> on track 3, and it became larger, feeding on the wooden platform. The <b>train</b> on Track 1 was saved when the motorman saw smoke, and reversed the <b>train.</b> The basements of nearby buildings were damaged. Tracks 1 and 4 returned to service on April 23, 1964, while Track 3 returned to service on June 1, 1964. The reinstallation of Track 3 was delayed {{because of the need}} to replace 60 beams that were damaged in the fire. Initially, a decision was not made concerning whether or not the automated shuttle <b>train</b> should be reintroduced.|$|E

5|$|After the <b>train</b> {{departs from}} the station, it {{immediately}} begins {{to climb the}} vertical (90 degree) lift hill. Upon reaching {{the top of the}} lift, the <b>train</b> turns 45 degrees backwards putting the <b>train</b> and its riders in an upside down position. Then, as the <b>train</b> exits the lift, it goes through a heartline roll before going down the only drop in the layout of the roller coaster. The <b>train</b> speeds through the station going back up the lift. Once it loses momentum the <b>train</b> then returns down passing through the station again. It then proceeds back up the drop and partially into the heartline roll before once again losing momentum and returning to the ground. After passing the station for the third time, the <b>train</b> is stopped {{near the top of the}} lift hill. It is then lowered back down to the station where the next riders board the <b>train.</b> The XT 150 has the option of sending riders around a second cycle at the operator's discretion. When the <b>train</b> stops on the lift hill at the end of the ride, instead of lowering slowly back to the station, the chain will raise the car up and send it through the ride again.|$|E

40|$|As {{mnemonic}} utilization {{deficit in}} older adults associates with age-related decline in executive function, {{we hypothesized that}} memory strategy <b>training</b> combined with executive function <b>training</b> might induce larger <b>training</b> effect in memory and broader <b>training</b> effects in non-memory outcomes than pure memory <b>training.</b> The present study compared the effects of combined cognitive <b>training</b> (executive function <b>training</b> plus memory strategy <b>training)</b> to pure memory strategy <b>training.</b> Forty healthy older adults {{were randomly assigned to}} a combined cognitive <b>training</b> group or a memory strategy <b>training</b> group. A control group receiving no <b>training</b> was also included. Combined cognitive <b>training</b> group received 16 sessions of <b>training</b> (eight sessions of executive function <b>training</b> followed by eight sessions of memory strategy <b>training).</b> Memory <b>training</b> group received 16 sessions of memory strategy <b>training.</b> The results partly supported our hypothesis in that indeed improved performance on executive function was only found in combined <b>training</b> group, whereas memory performance increased less in combined <b>training</b> compared to memory strategy group. Results suggest that combined cognitive <b>training</b> may be less efficient than pure memory <b>training</b> in memory outcomes, though the influences from insufficient <b>training</b> time and less closeness between <b>trained</b> executive function and working memory could not be excluded; however it has broader <b>training</b> effects in non-memory outcomes.
