5|$|Martin Ritt, having {{directed}} The Long, Hot Summer on suggestion by Ravetch, then {{directed the}} couple's next collaboration, The Sound and the Fury (1959), once again {{an adaptation of}} a William Faulkner novel. In 1960, Frank and Ravetch collaborated on two films, Home from the Hill, an adaptation of the novel of the same name, and The Dark at the <b>Top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stairs,</b> an adaptation of a Tony award-winning play.|$|E
5|$|Another {{theory is}} that Madeleine, nearly four at the time, left the {{apartment}} by herself, perhaps to look for her parents, and was abducted by a passer-by or fell {{into one of the}} open construction sites nearby. This is widely regarded as unlikely. According to her mother, Madeleine would have had to open the unlocked patio doors, close the curtains behind her, close the door again, open and close the child gate at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> then open and close the gate leading to the street.|$|E
5|$|The wound severed Sharp's aorta, {{killing him}} almost instantly. Sharp's wife Eliza {{witnessed}} the entire {{scene from the}} <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> in the house, but Beauchamp fled before he could be identified or captured. Returning to the site where he had buried a change of clothes, he stripped off his disguise, tied {{it up with a}} rock, and sank them in the Kentucky River. In his regular clothes, he returned to his room at Scott's house, where he remained until the following morning.|$|E
50|$|The {{first floor}} {{contains}} offices open onto the west verandah. Toilets behind open off <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair.</b> <b>The</b> gallery is accessed from the landing and contains six rows of tiered seating.|$|R
60|$|So {{saying the}} plotter once more shook hands; {{and with the}} politest ceremonies, and some {{necessary}} guidance, conducted the bewildered young gentleman to <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair.</b>|$|R
60|$|After {{making a}} quick toilet she felt more revived, though still {{suffering}} from a headache. On going out <b>of</b> <b>the</b> door she met Unity at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair.</b>|$|R
5|$|A week later, Marion's sister Lila {{arrives in}} Fairvale and confronts Sam about the {{whereabouts}} of her sister. Private investigator Milton Arbogast approaches them and confirms that Marion is wanted for stealing the $40,000. He checks the motels, and Norman's evasive and inconsistent answers arouse his suspicions. After hearing that Marion had met Norman's mother, he asks to speak with her, but Norman refuses. Arbogast calls Lila and Sam to update them. He goes to the Bates' home in search of Norman's mother; as he reaches the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> he is attacked and murdered. When Lila and Sam do not hear from Arbogast, Sam visits the motel. He finds only Mrs. Bates, who ignores his knocking. Lila and Sam go to the local sheriff, who informs them that Mrs. Bates killed herself ten years ago, and concludes that Arbogast lied to confuse them and made off with the $40,000. Still convinced that some ill has befallen Arbogast, Lila and Sam {{make their way to}} the motel. Norman takes his unwilling mother from her room and hides her in the fruit cellar.|$|E
5|$|John Wilkes Booth had {{originally}} planned to kidnap Lincoln, and recruited conspirators, including Lewis Powell. Having found {{no opportunity to}} abduct the president, on April 14, 1865, Booth assigned Powell to assassinate Seward, with George Atzerodt to kill Vice President Johnson and himself to kill Lincoln, which would slay the three {{senior members of the}} Executive Branch. Accordingly, another member of the conspiracy, David Herold, led Powell to the Seward home on horseback and was responsible for holding Powell's horse while he committed the attack. Seward had been hurt in an accident some days before, and Powell gained entry to the home on the excuse he was delivering medicine to the injured man, but was stopped at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> by Frederick Seward, who insisted Powell give him the medicine. Powell instead attempted to fire on Frederick, and beat him over the head with the barrel of his gun when it misfired. Powell burst through the door, threw Fanny Seward (the secretary's daughter) to one side, and jumped on the bed, and stabbed William Seward in the face and neck five times. A soldier assigned to guard and nurse the secretary, Private George F. Robinson, jumped on Powell, forcing him from the bed. Powell fled, stabbing a messenger, Emerick Hansell, as he went, to find that Herold, panicked by the screams from the house, had left with both horses. Seward was at first thought dead, but revived enough to instruct Robinson to send for the police and lock the house until they arrived.|$|E
25|$|In another {{scene where}} the {{characters}} played by Amelia Bence, Petrone and Magaña argue, {{the latter was}} supposed to fall down the stairs but doubted his ability to do so. Demare stood at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> {{with his back to}} it and rolled down, to demonstrate that the scene could be done without undue risk. This was in fact the sequence shown in the movie.|$|E
25|$|Three {{separate}} {{flights of}} stairs lead up to the platform. Here, there is a dispatcher's office and crew quarters in <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> towers. There is a turnstile bank and MetroCard machines.|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> themes <b>of</b> scale, contradiction, and [...] "whimsy" [...] - [...] "not {{inappropriate}} {{to an individual}} house," [...] {{can be seen at}} <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair,</b> that seems to go from the second floor to a non-existent third floor.|$|R
60|$|From <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> I {{could see}} into the dark passage, and make out Hendry shaking at the door. I could hear the doctor's voice, but not the words he said. There was a painful silence, and then Leeby laughed joyously.|$|R
25|$|By 1945, at age 29, {{she played}} the mother in A Tree Grows In Brooklyn. She was {{nominated}} for the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1947 for Gentleman's Agreement. Other notable films include Till the End of Time, The Enchanted Cottage, A Summer Place, Three Coins in the Fountain, Friendly Persuasion, Old Yeller, Swiss Family Robinson, The Greatest Story Ever Told and The Dark at the <b>Top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stairs.</b>|$|E
25|$|It was, {{according}} to Vasari, at Cosimo's urging that Fra Angelico set about {{the task of}} decorating the convent, including the magnificent fresco of the Chapter House, the often-reproduced Annunciation at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> leading to the cells, the Maesta (or Coronation of the Madonna) with Saints (cell 9) and the many other devotional frescoes, of smaller format but remarkable luminous quality, depicting aspects of the Life of Christ that adorn the walls of each cell.|$|E
25|$|Inside, a key {{aspect of}} the crime scene was also {{inconsistent}} with the burglary theory. At the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> was a stack of stereo equipment atop a VCR. If, as the evidence suggested, the struggle between Rasmussen and her attacker had begun upstairs and then continued downstairs, that stack would likely have been knocked downstairs and scattered as well. It made more sense to assume that it had been stacked afterwards, when an actual burglar would have fled the scene immediately after the shooting.|$|E
60|$|At <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> was an anteroom, with {{boxes and}} trunks, which bore marks {{of having been}} rifled, as some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{contents}} lay on the floor. A lamp, dying in the chimney, shed a feeble beam on a dead or senseless man who lay across the hearth.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{upper floor}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{building}} {{is divided into}} rooms off a central hall by three quarter height tongue and groove panelled partitions with glazing over. The ceiling is tongue and groove similar to the ground floor. A trap door is centrally positioned in the floor at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair.</b>|$|R
50|$|The tower {{measures}} 11.5 by 10.3 m {{and rises}} four storeys to a corbelled parapet walk, with bartizans (open round towers) at the corners. At the north-west corner is a hexagonal cap house (a small room covering <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair),</b> with a pyramidal roof. The vaulted basement contains a well, {{and the main}} hall is at first-floor level.|$|R
25|$|The {{first route}} to be {{introduced}} in 1955 was the 12A from St Marychurch through Babbacombe, Torquay, Paignton and Goodrington to Broadsands. To reach Paignton's sea front at Preston the bus had to pass under a very low railway bridge. A licence for the route was only granted on condition that buses would {{come to a stop}} before passing under the bridge, the conductor would then have to instruct passengers on the top deck to remain in their seats and then stand at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> to see that they did.|$|E
25|$|The {{sides of}} the pulpit erupt like stylized petals from the stem {{supporting}} it. On those Gothic petals are relief portraits of the four original Doctors of the Church (St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Ambrose, St. Gregory the Great and St. Jerome), each of them in one of four different temperaments {{and in one of}} four different stages of life. The handrail of the stairway curving its way around the pillar from ground level to the pulpit has fantastic decorations of toads and lizards biting each other, symbolizing the fight of good against evil. At the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> a stone puppy protects the preacher from intruders.|$|E
25|$|Florance {{continued}} {{working in}} theatre, although she spent less time there. She produced well-regarded work and was nominated {{a second time}} for the Melbourne Critics Award (Erik) for her performance in Eugène Ionesco's The Chairs (1960) at the Little Theatre. By 1961, Florance had left Channel 2 to concentrate on repertory. A string of performances at the Union Theatre followed; including Ferenc Molnár's comedy The Guardsman (4 September 1961 – 23 September 1961), William Inge's The Dark at the <b>Top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Stairs</b> (25 September 1961 – 14 October 1961), and Bram Stoker's Dracula (8 January 1962 – 3 February 1962) with Neil Fitzpatrick and Patsy King, who later appeared with Florance in many episodes of Prisoner.|$|E
50|$|In the 16th {{century the}} main abbey {{buildings}} were destroyed in <b>the</b> dissolution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> monasteries, but the chapel survived, most {{likely due to}} its usefulness as a coastal beacon and sea-mark. In later times a navigation light used to be lit at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> turret. <b>The</b> chapel was repaired in 1742 and the late 19th century, but is largely unaltered.|$|R
50|$|A wide {{entrance}} stair, with rendered masonry upstands {{to either}} side, is located centrally. Non-original timber framed French doors with obscured glass panes and sidelights are located at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair,</b> <b>the</b> verandah has been enclosed with glass louvres and compressed sheeting, and latticed timber panels are located between the brick piers supporting the verandah. The eastern gable end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roof has decorative timber bargeboards, and a deck opening from <b>the</b> first floor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rear wing is located {{adjacent to the}} gable end and is supported by timber posts above the enclosed eastern verandah.|$|R
60|$|Now, if it {{were not}} for coincidences a great many <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{extraordinary}} events <b>of</b> this life would never have happened. For instance--but the instances are so numerous that it may be well not to begin them. It happened that just as the bear began to ascend the snow staircase Anteek with the spear in his hand began to ascend the companion-ladder. But <b>the</b> chief point <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coincidence lay here--that just as the bear reached <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> <b>the</b> boy reached the very same spot, and next moment the two stood face to face within four feet of each other.|$|R
25|$|The wide stairs {{leading from}} the subway land in the {{southern}} third of the building at a ticket hall and waiting area, which is open on both sides. A painted steel mid-rail runs the length of these stairs. Opposite the stair void the gaps between the piers are filled with screens made with a metal frame and grill panel bolted to the brick surrounds and resting on low brick walls. The internal faces of the piers are rendered and painted. The ticket windows are directly opposite the stair landing. Only the western one is currently in use, the other now hidden behind a freestanding automatic ticket machine. A number of timetable wall-boxes line the available wall space, one being an early timber example. One of the original chrome-plated ticket rails {{in front of the}} operating ticket window remains. The floor is lined with a chequered pattern of black and white terrazzo tiles, while the ceiling is made with fibrous cement sheeting. A stainless steel downpipe marks the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> and the endpoint of the middle handrail. There were four downpipes in the original design, one next to what had been the telephone box on the south-eastern facade, another between the office and store and another between the toilet and waiting area. How many still exist is unknown as three were enclosed in various walls along the centreline of the building and cannot be viewed. It is likely that some if not all remain.|$|E

500|$|Miranda is {{impressed}} by Andy and {{allows her to}} be the one to bring the treasured [...] "Book", a mock-up of the upcoming edition, to her home, along with her dry cleaning. She is given instructions by Emily about where to leave the items and is told not to speak with anyone in the home. Andy arrives at Miranda's home only to discover that the instructions she received are vague. As she tries to figure out what to do, Andy begins to panic. Miranda's twins, Caroline and Cassidy, falsely tell her she can leave the book at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> just as Emily has done on many occasions. At the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> Andy interrupts Miranda and her husband having an argument. Mortified, Andy leaves the book and runs out of the home.|$|E
50|$|Andrea now seeks {{revenge and}} won't rest until Bernarda pays {{for what she}} did to her. One windy night Andrea beckons Claudia to climb <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> to <b>the</b> tower.

60|$|Then Tarzan and Abdul {{stepped into}} <b>the</b> semidarkness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> court. The frightened Ouled-Nails were {{crouching}} at <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> {{which led to}} their respective rooms, the only light in the courtyard coming from the sickly candles which each girl had stuck with its own grease to <b>the</b> woodwork <b>of</b> her door-frame, <b>the</b> better to display her charms to those who might happen to traverse the dark inclosure.|$|R

500|$|A {{circular}} double staircase {{built from}} concrete and faced with travertine greets the visitor upon {{entry into the}} library. At the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> the visitor enters a dramatic central hall with enormous circular openings that reveal several floors of book stacks. [...] At {{the top of the}} atrium, two massive concrete cross beams diffuse the light entering from the clerestory windows.|$|E
500|$|The firemen {{made their}} way up an {{enclosed}} staircase with Serial 502 behind them. Dozens of rioters suddenly appeared at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> blowing whistles and throwing bottles. Pengelly ordered the officers and firefighters to retreat. They were forced to run backwards down the unlit narrow staircase, fearful of tripping over the fire hoses, which had been flat before but were now full of water. PC Richard Coombes, armed with just a short truncheon, said the noise – [...] "Kill the pigs!" [...] – was deafening, and he could hardly see through the scratched Perspex visor on his helmet.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} {{as part of}} Madonna's 1985 Virgin Tour; it was the fifth song of the setlist. Madonna wore a blue see-through crop-top, revealing her characteristic black bra. She also had lacy leggings and crucifixes around an ear and her neck. As she finished the vigorous performance of [...] "Everybody", the lights were dimmed and the introduction music of the song started. Rotating lights fell on the stage. Madonna appeared sitting on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> and gradually descended. During the intermediate bridge, she and her dancers moved energetically around the whole stage, as white balloons fell on them from above. Madonna continued singing as the lights were dimmed again. She finished the performance and disappeared behind the wings for a costume change. [...] "Angel" [...] did {{not appear in the}} final home video release [...]|$|E
50|$|Early fire {{fighting}} systems used sprinklers supplied by water captured on flat roofs in shallow tanks. Later mills had a water tank at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> tower. Water for the sprinklers {{had to be}} protected from freezing and evaporation. Water pressure needed to be above 7 psi, and the header tank at least 15 ft above the highest sprinkler. <b>The</b> provision <b>of</b> light, water tanks and heating system defined the structure and shape <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mill.|$|R
60|$|At <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> kitchen <b>stairs</b> Miss Sellars {{paused and}} called down shrilly to Mrs. Peedles, who in {{course of time}} appeared, panting.|$|R
50|$|On {{the second}} floor, an {{identical}} arch spans the center hall south <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair.</b> <b>The</b> decoration is more restrained, with simpler door and window surrounds and a ceiling medallion in <b>the</b> north section <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hall made <b>of</b> concentric circles. <b>The</b> same wide flooring planks are used everywhere {{on the floor}} except for the bathroom.
