Maps were also only half complete, identified only enemy installations, and left out flight paths, lest the document fall into Allied hands enabling them to trace the whereabouts of German fighter bases. Most commanders were also refused permission to brief their pilots until moments before take-off. This created operational confusion. Commanders only managed to get across <b>the</b> <b>bare</b> <b>essentials</b> of the plan. When the operation got under way, many German pilots still did not understand what the operation was about, or what exactly was required of them.

5|$|The Hindu elite {{follow the}} {{religious}} ideology of Shaiva Siddhanta (Shaiva school) while masses practice folk Hinduism, upholding {{their faith in}} local village deities not found in formal Hindu scriptures. The place of worship depends on the object of worship {{and how it is}} housed. It could be a proper Hindu temple known as a Koyil, constructed according to the Agamic scripts (a set of scriptures regulating the temple cult). More often, however, the temple is not completed in accordance with Agamic scriptures but consists of <b>the</b> <b>barest</b> <b>essential</b> structure housing a local deity. These temples observe daily Puja (prayers) hours and are attended by locals. Both types of temples have a resident ritualist or priest known as a Kurukkal. A Kurukkal may belong to someone from a prominent local lineage like Pandaram or Iyer community. In the Eastern Province, a Kurukkal usually belongs to Lingayat sect. Other places of worship do not have icons for their deities. The sanctum could house a trident (culam), a stone, or a large tree. Temples of this type are common in the Northern and Eastern Provinces; a typical village has up to 150 such structures. The offering would be done by an elder of the family who owns the site. A coconut oil lamp would be lit on Fridays, and a special rice dish known as pongal would be cooked either on a day considered auspicious by the family or on the Thai Pongal day, and possibly on Tamil New Year Day.|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} part of a survey whose {{ultimate}} purpose is to clarify the significance of the famous coincidence between the Hubble age of the universe and a certain combination of microphysical parameters. In this part the way is prepared by a discussion of the manner in which familiar local phenomena depend qualitatively, and in order of magnitude, quantitatively on the fundamental parameters of microphysics. In order to keep the account concise while remaining self contained, only <b>the</b> <b>barest</b> <b>essentials</b> of <b>the</b> standard nuclear physical and astrophysical calculations involved are given. Only six of the fundamental parameters play a dominant part, namely the coupling constants of the strong, electromagnetic, and gravitational forces, and the mass ratios of the proton, neutron, electron and pi-meson. Attention is drawn to the important consequences of three coincidental relationships between these parameters. It is shown that most of the principle limiting masses of astrophysics arise (in fundamental units) simply as the reciprocal of the gravitational fine structure constant, with relatively small adjustment factors. The dividing point between red dwarf and blue giant stars turns out to be an exception: this division occurs within the range of the main sequence stars only {{as a consequence of the}} rather exotic coincidence that the ninth power of the electromagnetic fine structure constant is roughly equal to the square root of the gravitational fine structure constant.

40|$|Since its {{introduction}} {{in the early}} 1980 s, the Global Positioning System (GPS) has become an important worldwide resource. Although the primary use of GPS is for position location, the inherent timing accuracy built into the system has allowed it become an important synchronisation resource for other systems. In most cases the GPS end user only requires a position estimate without awareness of the timing and synchronisation aspects of the system. A low accuracy position (at the several-metre level) with a low update rate of about 1 Hz is often acceptable. However, obtaining more accurate position estimates (at the sub-metre level) at higher update rates {{requires the use of}} differential correction signals (DGPS) and greater processing power in the receiver. Furthermore, some extra challenges arise when simultaneously gathering information from a group of independently moving remote GPS receivers (rovers) at increased sampling rates (10 Hz). This creates the need for a high bandwidth telemetry system and techniques to synchronise the position measurements for tracking each rover. This thesis investigates and develops an overall solution to these problems using GPS for both position location and synchronisation. A system is designed to generate relative position information from 30 or more rovers in real-time. The important contributions of this research are as follows: a) A GPS synchronised telemetry system is developed to transport GPS data from each rover. Proof of concept experiments show why a conventional RF Local Area Network (LAN) is not suitable for this application. The new telemetry system is developed using Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) devices to embed both the synchronising logic and the central processor. b) A new system architecture is developed to reduce the processing load of the GPS receiver. Furthermore, the need to transfer the DGPS correction data to the rover is eliminated. Instead, the receiver raw data is processed in a centralised Kalman filter to produce multiple position estimates in real-time. c) Steps are taken to optimise the telemetry data stream by using only <b>the</b> <b>bare</b> <b>essential</b> data from each rover. A custom protocol is developed to deliver the GPS receiver raw data to the central point with minimal latency. The central software is designed to extract and manage common elements such as satellite ephemeris data from the central reference receiver only. d) Methods are developed to make the overall system more robust by identifying and understanding the points of failure, providing fallback options to allow recovery with minimal impact. Based on the above a system is designed and integrated using a mixture of custom hardware, custom software and off-the-shelf hardware. Overall tests show that efforts to minimise latency, minimise power requirements and improve reliability have delivered good results...|$|R
