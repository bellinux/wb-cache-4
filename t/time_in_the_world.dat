25|$|Coming {{into the}} 2002 World Cup, {{expectations}} of the German team were low due to poor results in the qualifiers and not directly qualifying for the finals for the first time.

25|$|Coming {{into the}} 2002 World Cup, {{expectations}} of the German team were low due to poor results in the qualifiers. This included not directly qualifying for the finals for the first time.

The bench headed by Dr. Justice K.

25|$|As Chief Minister, Kamaraj {{removed the}} family {{vocation}} based Hereditary Education Policy introduced by Rajaji. The State made immense strides {{in education and}} trade.
