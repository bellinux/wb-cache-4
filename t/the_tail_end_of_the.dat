5|$|Through {{the first}} months of 1918, the {{composition}} of Battleship Division Nine changed to reflect the lessons learned from operating in a war zone with the Grand Fleet. It soon became apparent that with only four ships, the division could not maintain the level of preparedness required by the constant need to be ready to sail at limited notice. The inevitable result was machinery breakdowns that reduced the squadron to three ships, a development considered unacceptable given the Division's important position at <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle line. The British—faced with the same problem—responded by allocating a spare battleship to each of their squadrons. In this way, each squadron always remained at full strength even when a ship was being repaired.|$|E

5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with six drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. During the first part of qualifying (Q1), Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time, a new fastest lap of the track ever at 1:36.006. However, he also came under investigation of the stewards as he failed to obliged the rules set for turn 2, rejoining the track earlier than allowed after running wide. After being summoned to the stewards at the end of qualifying, he walked away with a reprimand, but was not penalised. Behind Rosberg in second place, the two Ferrari cars of Sebastian Vettel and Kimi Räikkönen were third and fourth respectively. At <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field, three pairs of cars were eliminated: both Sauber, Manor and Renault drivers missed Q2.|$|E
5|$|These {{events are}} at <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> long GRB {{duration}} distribution, lasting more than 10,000 seconds. They {{have been proposed}} to form a separate class, caused {{by the collapse of}} a blue supergiant star, a tidal disruption event or a new-born magnetar. Only a small number have been identified to date, their primary characteristic being their gamma ray emission duration. The most studied ultra-long events include GRB 101225A and GRB 111209A. The low detection rate may be a result of low sensitivity of current detectors to long-duration events, rather than a reflection of their true frequency. A 2013 study, on the other hand, shows that the existing evidence for a separate ultra-long GRB population with a new type of progenitor is inconclusive, and further multi-wavelength observations are needed to draw a firmer conclusion.|$|E
5|$|In general appearance, {{the current}} {{operating}} line of SIR looks somewhat like an outdoor {{line of the}} New York City Subway. Since the 1960s, it has been grade separated from all roads, but it runs more or less at street level for a brief stretch north of Clifton, between the Grasmere and Old Town stations, and from south of the Pleasant Plains station to Tottenville, {{the end of the}} line. It uses NYC Transit-standard 600 V DC third rail power. Its equipment are R44 subway type cars that are specially modified with headlight dimmers, electric windshield defrosters, FRA Compliant cab signals and horns, and FRA regulation 223 required shatterproof glazing, and exterior mounted grab rails near the side doors. The cars were built in early 1973, at <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> R44 order of subway cars for New York City Transit (the Staten Island R44s being the last cars built by the St. Louis Car Company). Heavy maintenance of the equipment is performed at NYCT's Clifton Shops. Any work that cannot be performed at Clifton requires the cars to be trucked over the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to the subway's Coney Island Complex shops in Brooklyn. The right-of-way also includes elevated, embankment and open-cut portions, and a tunnel near St. George.|$|E

5|$|In {{what was}} Moss's first {{pre-season}} as coach, he {{did little to}} change what Arnold had built at the club. The only {{major changes in the}} side were with the addition of Senegalese international Malick Mané and Hungarian Richárd Vernes, and Marcos Flores leaving the club, with Mile Sterjovski retiring. Mariners began the season on a high, progressing to the semi-finals of the 2014 FFA Cup and defeating local rivals Newcastle Jets 1–0 at home in the opening round of the A-League. However the season soon turned with the team failing to secure a win {{for the remainder of the}} year. After their elimination from the 2015 AFC Champions League qualifying play-off by Chinese side Guangzhou R and a continued poor league record after a short mid-season break, the club stood down Moss as head coach. The decision was made on 6 March 2015, with Mariners appointing technical director Tony Walmsley in an interim capacity and captain John Hutchinson in a dual player-coach role, until the end of the season. Portuguese player Fábio Ferreira also joined the team at <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season. On 15 April Walmsley was announced as Mariners' permanent technical director and head coach for the 2015–16 season. The announcement came despite an end to the season in which the club finished the league in eighth position.|$|E
5|$|Limited {{running in}} {{practice}} and a wet qualifying session meant that teams had to improvise their strategies at the Hockenheimring. Fernando Alonso controlled much of the race from pole position, only relinquishing the lead when he pitted, {{and he went on}} to take his third victory of the season. Lewis Hamilton's one hundredth Grand Prix started with a disaster when he picked up a puncture on the third lap and spent most of the race at <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field before retiring on lap 56 with a suspension problem. Confusion briefly reigned when Hamilton, in seventeenth place at the time, began lapping faster than the leaders and sought to unlap himself. Sebastian Vettel later claimed that this was a ploy by McLaren to force both him and Alonso to drive defensively against Hamilton, slowing them down enough to allow team-mate Jenson Button to leap-frog them at the second round of stops; Vettel lost a position to Button, but Alonso was unaffected, as Ferrari pitted him before Hamilton could interfere with his race. Button briefly {{looked as if he had}} the pace to pass Alonso for the race lead, but the race was deadlocked in the final twenty laps, and Button began to fade in the final five laps of the race. The race was marked by another technical dispute regarding Red Bull Racing, who were referred to the stewards by FIA Technical Delegate Jo Bauer for what he felt was an illegal engine map in use on the Red Bull RB8. The stewards elected to take no action against Red Bull, stating that the team had not violated any of the technical regulations, but noted that they did not accept all of the arguments presented by the team when asked to explain. The stewards were less forgiving of Vettel, who ran wide at the hairpin while trying to pass Button and could only complete the pass outside the limits of the circuit. Vettel had twenty seconds added to his race time as a penalty, demoting him to fifth overall. With Button promoted to second, Kimi Räikkönen inherited third place and Kamui Kobayashi was classified a career-best fourth.|$|E
