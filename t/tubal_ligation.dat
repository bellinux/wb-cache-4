5|$|Surgical {{sterilization}} {{is available}} in the form of <b>tubal</b> <b>ligation</b> for women and vasectomy for men. There are no significant long-term side effects, and <b>tubal</b> <b>ligation</b> decreases the risk of ovarian cancer. Short term complications are twenty times less likely from a vasectomy than a <b>tubal</b> <b>ligation.</b> After a vasectomy, there may be swelling and pain of the scrotum which usually resolves in a week or two. With <b>tubal</b> <b>ligation,</b> complications occur in 1 to 2 percent of procedures with serious complications usually due to the anesthesia. Neither method offers protection from sexually transmitted infections.|$|E
5|$|Birth control {{methods include}} barrier methods, {{hormonal}} birth control, intrauterine devices (IUDs), sterilization, and behavioral methods. They are used before or during sex while emergency contraceptives are effective {{for up to}} a few days after sex. Effectiveness is generally expressed as the percentage of women who become pregnant using a given method during the first year, and sometimes as a lifetime failure rate among methods with high effectiveness, such as <b>tubal</b> <b>ligation.</b>|$|E
5|$|This {{decision}} {{may cause}} regret in some men and women. Of women aged over 30 who have undergone <b>tubal</b> <b>ligation,</b> about 5% regret their decision, {{as compared with}} 20% of women aged under 30. By contrast, less than 5% of men are likely to regret sterilization. Men more likely to regret sterilization are younger, have young or no children, or have an unstable marriage. In a survey of biological parents, 9% stated {{they would not have}} had children if they were able to do it over again.|$|E

5|$|The most {{effective}} methods {{of birth control}} are sterilization by means of vasectomy in males and <b>tubal</b> <b>ligation</b> in females, intrauterine devices (IUDs), and implantable birth control. This {{is followed by a}} number of hormone-based methods including oral pills, patches, vaginal rings, and injections. Less effective methods include physical barriers such as condoms, diaphragms and birth control sponges and fertility awareness methods. The least effective methods are spermicides and withdrawal by the male before ejaculation. Sterilization, while highly effective, is not usually reversible; all other methods are reversible, most immediately upon stopping them. Safe sex practices, such as with the use of male or female condoms, can also help prevent sexually transmitted infections. Other methods of birth control do not protect against sexually transmitted diseases. Emergency birth control can prevent pregnancy if taken within the 72 to 120 hours after unprotected sex. Some argue not having sex as a form of birth control, but abstinence-only sex education may increase teenage pregnancies if offered without birth control education, due to non-compliance.|$|E
5|$|The {{thrust of}} Stern's defense is that Della Guardia and Molto have framed Rusty {{in order to}} cover up the bribery case. During the {{cross-examination}} of the coroner, it is revealed that Carolyn underwent a <b>tubal</b> <b>ligation,</b> thus having no reason to use the spermicidal contraceptive which was found on her. Stern asserts that the only explanation for this discrepancy is that the fluid sample was not actually taken from Carolyn's body. Based on the disappearance of the beer glass, the lack of motive {{and the fact that the}} fluid sample was rendered meaningless, Judge Lyttle dismisses the charges. Rusty confronts Stern for bringing up the bribery file in the case. Stern swears him to secrecy, revealing that Lyttle had a brief sexual encounter with Carolyn. Stern also confesses that he and Raymond knew that Lyttle was taking bribes, and although Lyttle had offered his resignation, Raymond felt that he was a brilliant judge and deserved another chance. Lipranzer meets with Rusty and reveals the missing beer glass, explaining that he never returned it to evidence when the investigation was turned over to Della Guardia and Molto. Rusty throws it into a river.|$|E
25|$|Outpatient {{benefits}} include day surgeries, radiotherapy, dialysis, outpatient blood transfusion, TB-DOTS, malaria treatment, HIV/AIDS treatment, animal bite treatment, cataract {{operations and}} vasectomy and <b>tubal</b> <b>ligation.</b>|$|E
50|$|Common {{emergency}} cases include child delivery, traumatic injuries, pelvic bleeding, intestinal obstruction, and peritonitis. Some of the surgeries performed include thyroidectomies, tonsillectomies, vagotomies, pyloroplasties, chronic osteomyelitis amputations, hysterectomies, <b>tubal</b> <b>ligations,</b> C-sections {{as well as}} eye surgeries.|$|R
5000|$|Sterilization {{procedures}} are {{generally considered to}} have low risk of side effects, though some persons and organizations disagree. [...] Female sterilization is a more significant operation than vasectomy, and has greater risks; in industrialized nations, mortality is 4 per 100,000 <b>tubal</b> <b>ligations,</b> versus 0.1 per 100,000 vasectomies.|$|R
5000|$|The {{majority}} of the physicians performing the sterilizations decided that sterilization was the best alternative for these women. They claimed it would improve their financial situation and {{improve the quality of}} life for the children that they already had. Additionally, with fewer people applying for Medicaid and welfare, the federal government could decrease spending on welfare programs. The physicians were also paid more for performing hysterectomies and <b>tubal</b> <b>ligations</b> than for prescribing other forms of birth control. The influx of surgical procedures was seen as a way for new physicians to train and resident physicians to practice. When a student in 1971 asked why hysterectomies were favored over <b>tubal</b> <b>ligations,</b> Dr. James Ryan responded that [...] "it's more of a challenge...and it's good experience for the junior resident".|$|R
25|$|<b>Tubal</b> <b>ligation</b> can {{predispose}} to ectopic pregnancy. Reversal of tubal sterilization (Tubal reversal) {{carries a}} risk for ectopic pregnancy. This is higher if more destructive methods of <b>tubal</b> <b>ligation</b> (tubal cautery, partial {{removal of the}} tubes) have been used than less destructive methods (tubal clipping). A history of a tubal pregnancy {{increases the risk of}} future occurrences to about 10%. This risk is not reduced by removing the affected tube, even if the other tube appears normal. The best method for diagnosing this is to do an early ultrasound.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tubal</b> <b>ligation</b> is {{protective}} because carcinogens {{are unable}} to reach the ovary and fimbriae via the vagina, uterus, and Fallopian tubes. <b>Tubal</b> <b>ligation</b> is also protective in women with the BRCA1 mutation, but not the BRCA2 mutation. Hysterectomy reduces the risk, and removal of both Fallopian tubes and ovaries (bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy) dramatically {{reduces the risk of}} not only ovarian cancer, but breast cancer as well. This is still a topic of research, as the link between hysterectomy and lower ovarian cancer risk is controversial. The reasons that hysterectomy may be protective have not been elucidated as of 2015.|$|E
25|$|People with a {{significant}} family history for ovarian cancer are often referred to a genetic counselor {{to see if they}} should be tested for BRCA mutations. The use of oral contraceptives, the absence of 'periods' during the menstrual cycle, and <b>tubal</b> <b>ligation</b> reduce the risk.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} {{the need for}} human biologists {{to take into account}} the far-reaching influences of biomedicine in the study of reproductive aging. Data were drawn from western Massachusetts and Puebla, Mexico, to illustrate the effects of hysterectomy rates, <b>tubal</b> <b>ligations</b> and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on studies of age and symptom experience at menopause. First, in examining age at natural menopause in relation to level of education, a country-specific, non-random pattern of participant exclusion due to hysterectomies was encountered. Second, in examining symptom frequency in relation to late childbearing, sample sizes were very small in part due to a high frequency of <b>tubal</b> <b>ligations</b> (43 %) in Puebla, Mexico. Third, hot flash frequency during the two weeks prior to interview was, unexpectedly, not lower among women who used HRT. Human biologists who study the biological process of reproductive aging must also attend to the cultural influences of biomedicine...|$|R
50|$|In 1993, Parliament passed further {{legislation}} withdrawing food coupons, paid maternity leave, {{and social}} welfare subsidies after the third child for government and para-government employees. The backlash to this law was severe and application of it remains limited. Birth control classes were required before a couple could get married. Dozens of mobile teams were sent to remote {{parts of the country}} to offer free vasectomies and <b>tubal</b> <b>ligations.</b>|$|R
2500|$|India's {{state of}} {{emergency}} between 1975 and 1977 included a family planning initiative that began in April 1976 through which the government hoped to lower India's ever increasing population. [...] This program used propaganda and monetary incentives to, some may construe, inveigle citizens to get sterilized. People who agreed to get sterilized would receive land, housing, and money or loans. [...] Because of this program, thousands of men received vasectomies and even more women received <b>tubal</b> <b>ligations,</b> both possibly reversible. [...] However, the program focused more on sterilizing women than men. [...] An article in The New York Times titled “For Sterilization, Target Is Women” states, “There were 114,426 vasectomies in India in 2002-03, and 4.6 million <b>tubal</b> <b>ligations,</b> the analogous operation on women, though ligation is a more complicated operation.” [...] Son of the Prime Minister at the time Indira Gandhi, Sanjay Gandhi was largely blamed for {{what turned out to}} be a failed program. A strong backlash against any initiative associated with family planning followed the highly controversial program,the backlash of which continues into the 21st century.|$|R
25|$|Immunocontraception {{promises}} {{many advantages}} over methods of contraception currently available for human use. It {{does not require}} surgical intervention, unlike procedures such as vasectomy or <b>tubal</b> <b>ligation.</b> It does not require action by participants concomitant with the act of intercourse, unlike methods {{such as the use}} of condoms.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of risk factors for ectopic pregnancies. However, in as many as one third to one half no risk factors can be identified. Risk factors include: pelvic {{inflammatory}} disease, infertility, use of an intrauterine device (IUD), previous exposure to DES, tubal surgery, intrauterine surgery (e.g. D), smoking, previous ectopic pregnancy, endometriosis, and <b>tubal</b> <b>ligation.</b> A previous induced abortion does not appear to increase the risk.|$|E
25|$|Like {{other forms}} of neutering, vasectomy and <b>tubal</b> <b>ligation</b> {{eliminate}} the ability to produce offspring. They differ from neutering in that they leave the animal's levels and patterns of sex hormone unchanged. Both sexes will retain their normal reproductive behavior, and other than birth control, none of {{the advantages and disadvantages}} listed above apply. This method is favored by some people who seek minimal infringement on the natural state of companion animals to achieve the desired reduction of unwanted births of cats and dogs.|$|E

25|$|Research {{begun in}} the 1970s led to {{clinical}} trials in humans of a hCG birth control vaccine. A phase I (safety) clinical trial examined 15 women from clinics in Helsinki, Finland, Uppsala, Sweden, Bahia, Brazil, and Santiago, Chile with a vaccine formed by conjugating the beta subunit of hCG with a tetanus toxoid.

50|$|A {{number of}} {{surgical}} specialties use microsurgical techniques. Otolaryngologists (ear, nose, throat and {{head and neck}} surgeons) perform microsurgery on structures of the inner ear and the vocal cords. Otolaryngologists and maxillofacial surgeons use microsurgical techniques when reconstructing defects from resection of head and neck cancers. Cataract surgery, corneal transplants, and treatment of conditions like glaucoma are performed by ophthalmologists. Urologists and gynecologists frequently now reverse vasectomies and <b>tubal</b> <b>ligations</b> to restore fertility.|$|R
25|$|The risk {{of ovarian}} cancer {{increases}} in women who have ovulated more over their lifetime. This includes those who have never had children, those who begin ovulation {{at a younger age}} or reach menopause at an older age. Other risk factors include hormone therapy after menopause, fertility medication, and obesity. Factors that decrease risk include hormonal birth control, <b>tubal</b> <b>ligation,</b> and breast feeding. About 10% of cases are related to inherited genetic risk; women with mutations in the genes BRCA1 or BRCA2 have about a 50% chance of developing the disease. The most common type {{of ovarian cancer}}, comprising more than 95% of cases, is ovarian carcinoma. There are five main subtypes of ovarian carcinoma, of which high-grade serous carcinoma is the most common. These tumors are believed to start in the cells covering the ovaries, though some may form at the Fallopian tubes. Less common types of ovarian cancer include germ cell tumors and sex cord stromal tumors. A diagnosis of ovarian cancer is confirmed through a biopsy of tissue, usually removed during surgery.|$|E
500|$|Ria Brown, the biographer of {{competitive}} swimmer Anita Lhoest, claims Lhoest terminated a pregnancy by Eastwood without consulting him {{at one point}} during their late 1950s to early 1960s affair. Restaurant critic Gael Greene admitted to an affair with Eastwood that began when she was assigned to interview him on the set of 1970's Two Mules for Sister Sara. A fling with French model Cathy Reghin around the same time was one of his few extramarital involvements to receive press coverage of any kind during the fact. According to McGilligan, Eastwood had many other affairs, including with co-stars Inger Stevens (Hang 'Em High), Jean Seberg (Paint Your Wagon) and Jo Ann Harris (The Beguiled), as well as actresses Jill Banner, Catherine Deneuve, and Susan St. James, columnist Bridget Byrne and singer Keely Smith while married to Johnson, who, after a trial separation and lingering bout of hepatitis during the mid-1960s, expressed desire to reconcile and start a family. They had two children together: Kyle Eastwood (born May 19, 1968) and Alison Eastwood (born May 22, 1972). In 1972, Eastwood met married actress (later director) Sondra Locke. The two began living together while filming The Outlaw Josey Wales in the autumn of 1975, by which time, according to Locke, [...] "He had told me that there was no real relationship left between him and Maggie." [...] Locke wrote in her autobiography, [...] "Clint seemed astonished at his need for me, even admitting that he'd never been faithful to one woman — because he'd [...] "never been in love before," [...] he confided. He even made up a song about it: [...] "She made me monogamous." [...] That flattered and delighted me. I would never doubt his faithfulness and his love for me." [...] Locke moved into the Sherman Oaks house Eastwood had once shared with Johnson (who by then lived full-time in Pebble Beach), but felt uncomfortable there because [...] "psychologically, it would always be Maggie's." [...] "Finally I told Clint that I couldn't live there any longer," [...] writes Locke. The couple moved to Bel-Air in a fixer-upper Locke spent three years renovating. She underwent two abortions and a <b>tubal</b> <b>ligation</b> in the late 1970s and was most reluctant about the second abortion, noting [...] "I couldn't help but think that that baby, with both Clint's and my best qualities, would be extraordinary." [...] Johnson made no secret of her dislike for Locke, even though the two women never met. [...] "Maggie placed severe rules on my relationship with the kids. Apparently, she never forgave me ... After she learned that Clint had taken me onto her property to show me a baby deer that had just been born there, she laid down a rule that I was never to be allowed there again. I was not even allowed to phone the Pebble Beach house." [...] In 1978 Johnson filed for legal separation from Eastwood, but did not file for divorce until May 1984, a divorce which was finalized that November with Johnson receiving a straight cash payment reported to be between $25 and $30million.|$|E

A 2005 review including both early failures and late failures described a total of 183 failures or recanalizations from approximately 43,642 vasectomies (0.4%), and sixty pregnancies after 92,184 vasectomies (0.07%).|$|R
