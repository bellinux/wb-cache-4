25|$|Medical {{inspections}} {{began in}} 1907 but many poor families {{could not afford}} {{the cost of the}} doctors fees to get treated; it was not until 1912 that medical treatment was provided. However, education authorities largely ignored the provision of free medical treatment for school children. A <b>tax</b> <b>allowance</b> for children was introduced in 1909 to help families on low incomes. This allowance of £10 a year was introduced for every child below the age of 16 in the case of income tax payers whose income fell below £500 per annum (this rebate was later doubled in the 1914 budget).|$|E
25|$|Ordinary {{income is}} a net income concept, {{meaning that it}} will be {{deduction}} for costs incurred to acquire income. There is therefore a deduction for expenses related to acquisition of income if these are higher than the basic allowance. There is also several other deductions from ordinary income; special allowance for disability, special <b>tax</b> <b>allowance</b> for pensioners, the tax limitation rule for the disabled, seamen’s allowance, fishermen’s allowance, special allowance for self-employed within agriculture, special allowance for high expenses linked to illness, allowance for payments to individual pension schemes, allowance for travel between home and work, allowance for donations to voluntary organisations, allowance for paid union fees, allowance for home investment savings scheme for people under 34 years, parental allowance for documented expenses for childminding and childcare, etc.|$|E
40|$|The {{content of}} this thesis is a {{detailed}} analysis of individual types of <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> provided to individuals - residents, focusing on selected states of the European Union. <b>Tax</b> <b>allowances</b> are considered deductions, <b>allowances,</b> credits and <b>tax</b> band with a zero tax rate. The author explains the differences between these types of <b>tax</b> <b>allowances,</b> analyzes the types of <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> granted in selected states of the European Union and examines the tax yield of the basic types of <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> of the taxpayer with an average gross wage...|$|R
30|$|The {{disaggregation}} {{of direct}} taxation into schedules, {{tax credits and}} a part attributable to <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> showed that redistribution is effected mainly via the schedules. The redistributive effect of tax schedules {{is largely due to}} their size {{and to a lesser extent}} to their progressivity. Neither <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> nor <b>tax</b> credits influence inequality levels to any great extent. However, it should be kept in mind that the effect of <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> and <b>tax</b> credits is critically linked to the design of tax schedules. In particular, <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> and <b>tax</b> credits cannot, by design, have a significant impact in the context of low taxation levels. <b>Tax</b> <b>allowances</b> are progressive in a context of flat rate taxation but regressive in a progressive regime. Both <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> and <b>tax</b> credits affect inequality much less than means-tested and even non-contributory benefits. This reinforces the idea that the inequality-reducing capacity of fiscal benefits is limited.|$|R
40|$|Diploma thesis {{deals with}} subject of income <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> in European Union {{countries}} and its development since the nineties of 20 th century. The main {{aim is to}} analyse trend in <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> transition from <b>tax</b> deductions to the systems, where tax credits prevail. The thesis also analyses the impact of standard <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> to the <b>tax</b> liability of average taxpayer. The impact of <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> is influenced by economic advancement, economic crisis and mainly by the way, how the tax system and system of social care is set. Most often the comprehensive income tax system with progressive tax rate schedule and flat tax system are being compared. In conclusion, the thesis is going to confirm or refute {{the persistence of the}} trend in prevailing tax credits in systems of <b>tax</b> <b>allowances...</b>|$|R

40|$|We use a tax-benefit microsimulation {{model to}} {{investigate}} the size and distributional effects of <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> and <b>tax</b> credits in six European countries. Results indicate that <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> and <b>tax</b> credits benefit large sections of the population, not just individuals with high incomes and that together they amount to substantial amounts of foregone revenue. However, with some (important) exceptions, their effect on inequality is small. <b>Tax</b> <b>allowances</b> are generally regressive while tax credits tend to be proportional or mildly progressive. Yet, the redistributive effect of <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> and <b>tax</b> credits works in complex and often unanticipated ways. Other features of the income tax system (such as the tax rate schedule or {{the definition of the}} taxpayer unit) are as important in determining the size and direction of the redistributive effect as the characteristics of the tax allowances/tax credits themselves. Even instruments inversely linked to taxable income can be more beneficial to high-income households in some contexts. Consequently, <b>tax</b> <b>allowances</b> and <b>tax</b> credits appear ill-suited to target resources towards households in the bottom part of the income distribution...|$|R
