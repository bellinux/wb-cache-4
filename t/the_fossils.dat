5|$|<b>The</b> <b>fossils</b> of the Burgess Shale {{were hidden}} in store rooms until the 1960s. When Whittington {{and his colleagues}} first began to publish their Burgess finds in the early 1970s, <b>the</b> <b>fossils</b> became central to the debate about how quickly animals arose, and were {{interpreted}} as evidence that all the living bilaterian phyla {{had appeared in the}} Early Cambrian, along with many other phyla that had become extinct {{by the end of the}} Cambrian.|$|E
5|$|An infaunal mode of {{life can}} be quickly ruled out, as <b>the</b> <b>fossils</b> are {{sometimes}} found in alignment with the depositing current; as nothing attached them to the bottom, they must have fallen from the water column.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{similarities}} between Pithecanthropus erectus (Java Man) and Sinanthropus pekinensis (Peking Man) led Ernst Mayr to rename both Homo erectus in 1950, placing them {{directly in the}} human evolutionary tree. To distinguish Java Man from other Homo erectus populations, some scientists began to regard it as a subspecies, Homo erectus erectus, in the 1970s. Other fossils found {{in the first half}} of the twentieth century in Java at Sangiran and Mojokerto, all older than those found by Dubois, are also considered part of the species Homo erectus. Estimated to be between 700,000 and 1,000,000 years old, at the time of their discovery <b>the</b> <b>fossils</b> of Java Man were the oldest hominin fossils ever found. <b>The</b> <b>fossils</b> of Java Man have been housed at the Naturalis in the Netherlands since 1900.|$|E

5|$|Hugh Miller (1802–56) from Cromarty was a stonemason and self-taught geologist. His 1841 {{publication}} The Old Red Sandstone {{became a}} bestseller. <b>The</b> <b>fossils</b> founds in these rocks {{were one of}} his fascinations, although his deep religious convictions led him to oppose the idea of biological evolution.|$|E
5|$|Interpretations {{of other}} {{features}} of Opabinia fossils differ. Since the animals {{did not have}} mineralized armor nor even tough organic exoskeletons like those of insects, their bodies were flattened as they were buried and fossilized, and smaller or internal features appear as markings within the outlines of <b>the</b> <b>fossils.</b>|$|E

50|$|When the lacquer has set, a {{frame of}} {{modelling}} clay is built on the rock face around <b>the</b> <b>fossil.</b> A two-component epoxy is poured onto the frame, forming the new artificial surface for <b>the</b> <b>fossil.</b> <b>The</b> composition of the resin is important, as {{it will have to}} soak into <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> to further strengthen it and to bind it to the new surface.|$|R
5|$|Long before England existed, {{this area}} {{was at the bottom}} of a primeval sea. The most notable of <b>the</b> <b>fossils</b> {{uncovered}} is that of an ichthyosaur from Caldecotte, now on display in the central library.|$|E
5|$|Massospondylus {{had also}} been {{reported}} from Argentina, but this has been reassessed as a closely related but distinct genus. <b>The</b> <b>fossils</b> included several partial skeletons {{and at least one}} skull, found in the Lower Jurassic Canon del Colorado Formation of San Juan, Argentina.

5|$|Over the years, twelve body fossil {{specimens}} of Archaeopteryx and a feather that may belong to {{it have been}} found. All of <b>the</b> <b>fossils</b> come from the limestone deposits, quarried for centuries, near Solnhofen, Germany.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fossil</b> {{plants from}} <b>the</b> same area as <b>the</b> McAbee <b>fossil</b> beds (Cache Creek and Kamloops B.C.) were first {{reported}} by G.M. Dawson. Palaeontological and geological studies of <b>the</b> McAbee <b>Fossil</b> Beds are more recent, however, going {{back at least}} to research in the 1960s and early 1970s by Dr. Len Hills of the University of Calgary and his students on <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> spores and pollen (palynology) and <b>the</b> leaf <b>fossils,</b> and research on <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> fish from <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> beds by Dr. Mark Wilson of the University of Alberta. Thomas Ewing provided a detailed analysis of the geology of the Kamloops Group, including the McAbee beds. [...] Significant research on <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> plants and insects has only occurred since the late 1980s. <b>The</b> McAbee <b>Fossil</b> Beds are best known for the abundant and well-preserved insect and fish fossils (Amyzon, Eohiodon, and Eosalmo). Eohiodon rosei from <b>the</b> McAbee <b>Fossil</b> Beds and other Eocene sites in British Columbia is now considered to belong to the present-day mooneye genus Hiodon.|$|R

50|$|Eggs laid by {{invertebrate}} {{animals are}} known from <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> record. Among these are eggs laid by ancient cephalopods. Eggs laid by ammonoids {{are the best}} known cephalopod egg <b>fossils.</b> <b>The</b> best preserved <b>fossil</b> ammonite eggs were preserved in the Jurassic Kimmeridge Clay of England. Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> record of cephalopod eggs is scant since their soft, gelatinous eggs decompose quickly and have little chance to fossilize. Another major group of Mesozoic cephalopods, the belemnoids, have no documented eggs in <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> record whatsoever, although {{this may be because}} scientists have not properly searched for them rather than an actual absence from <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> record.|$|R
5|$|Powderfinger {{were formed}} in 1989 by Steven Bishop (ex-The Eternal) on drums, John Collins (The Eternal) on bass guitar and Ian Haug (The Vibrants, <b>The</b> <b>Fossils)</b> on guitar and vocals. The Eternal, The Vibrants and <b>The</b> <b>Fossils</b> were other Brisbane-based outfits. All {{three members of}} Powderfinger were {{students}} at Brisbane Grammar School – a private school in Spring Hill – and they started as a cover band playing pub rock classics by The Rolling Stones, The Doors, Led Zeppelin, Steppenwolf, Rodriguez and Neil Young. The band's name is from Young's song of the same name. Despite their popularity in Brisbane, when playing a heavy metal gig in Newcastle in 1990, Powderfinger were booed off stage.|$|E
5|$|The {{age of the}} Santa Rosa fauna remains highly uncertain, as the outcrop where <b>the</b> <b>fossils</b> {{were found}} cannot easily {{be placed in a}} known stratigraphical unit, and <b>the</b> <b>fossils</b> are so {{distinct}} from other known fossil faunas that biostratigraphy cannot provide a precise estimate. In a summary of the 2004 volume, Kenneth Campbell tentatively referred Santa Rosa to the Mustersan South American Land Mammal Age (SALMA), which he placed near the Eocene–Oligocene boundary, around 35 million years ago. However, Mario Vucetich and colleagues suggested in 2010 that the Santa Rosa fauna may be substantially later—perhaps as young as the Deseadan SALMA (late Oligocene, around 25 million years ago). According to Campbell, the Santa Rosa mammals likely lived in a savanna habitat that contained rivers.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>fossils</b> clearly {{belong to}} a hippopotamus, but one much larger than any {{previously}} described Madagascan species. From what is known, the species closely resembled the modern hippopotamus, but was somewhat smaller.|$|E
40|$|<b>Fossil</b> glycoproteins of <b>the</b> soluble {{organic matrix}} {{are present in}} an 80 -million-year-old mollusk shell from the Late Cretaceous Period. Discrete {{molecular}} weight components, as determined by gel electrophoresis, are preserved. <b>The</b> <b>fossil</b> organic matrix was compared with the organic matrix of a living representative species of the same superfamily. A particular repeating amino acid sequence, found in contemporary mollusk shell proteins, was identified in <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> glycoproteins. <b>The</b> ultrastructure, mineralogy, and chemistry of the inorganic components of <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> and contemporary shells provide information {{on the state of}} preservation of <b>the</b> <b>fossil.</b> <b>The</b> use of <b>fossil</b> shell proteins to further our understanding of molecular evolution is discussed...|$|R

5|$|Also {{interested}} in Rajasaurus is Aliya Babi (of the erstwhile royal family of Balasinore), {{who became a}} dinosaur enthusiast after closely watching the efforts made by GSI at Rahioli to unearth <b>the</b> <b>fossils,</b> and made efforts to promote dinosaur tourism to Rahioli in order to showcase its {{millions of years of}} dinosaur heritage. She also set up a small museum at her hotel.|$|E
5|$|As {{described}} above, John Scannella {{had argued}} in 2010 that Nedoceratops {{should be considered}} a synonym of Triceratops. Andrew Farke (2011) maintained that it represents a valid distinct genus. Nick Longrich agreed with Scannella about Nedoceratops and made a further suggestion: that the recently described Ojoceratops was likewise a synonym. <b>The</b> <b>fossils,</b> he argued, are indistinguishable from the T. horridus specimens that were previously attributed to the defunct species T. serratus.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Xenophanes of Colophon (570–480 BC) {{recognized}} that some fossil shells were remains of shellfish, which he used to argue that what {{was at the time}} dry land was once under the sea. Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519), in an unpublished notebook, also concluded that some fossil sea shells were the remains of shellfish. However, in both cases, <b>the</b> <b>fossils</b> were complete remains of shellfish species that closely resembled living species, and were therefore easy to classify.|$|E
50|$|The sparseness of <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> record {{means that}} organisms usually exist {{long before they}} are found in <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> record - {{this is known as}} the Signor-Lipps effect.|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>fossil</b> Archaeopteryx was a {{man-made}} fake. This assertion was definitively refuted by, among other strong indications, {{the presence of}} microcracks extending through <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> into <b>the</b> surrounding rock.|$|R
50|$|In 2013, the People & Planet network {{launched}} a new campaign targeting <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> fuel industry, {{and in particular the}} role of Unconventional Fossil Fuels.

5|$|Before {{the arrival}} of Euro-Americans in the 19thcentury, the John Day basin was frequented by Sahaptin people who hunted, fished, and {{gathered}} roots and berries in the region. After road-building made the valley more accessible, settlers established farms, ranches, and a few small towns along the river and its tributaries. Paleontologists have been unearthing and studying <b>the</b> <b>fossils</b> in the region since 1864, when Thomas Condon, a missionary and amateur geologist, recognized their importance and made them known globally. Parts of the basin became a National Monument in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Cryolophosaurus {{originally}} was {{collected during the}} 1990–91 austral summer on Mount Kirkpatrick in the Beardmore Glacier region of the Transantarctic Mountains. The discovery was made by Hammer, a professor at Augustana College, and his team. <b>The</b> <b>fossils</b> {{were found in the}} siliceous siltstone of the Hanson Formation, formerly the upper Falla Formation, and dated to the Pliensbachian stage of the early Jurassic. Cryolophosaurus was the second dinosaur, and first theropod, to be discovered in Antarctica. It was discovered after Antarctopelta, but named earlier.|$|E
5|$|Early {{discoveries of}} indricotheres were made through various colonial links to Asia. The first known indricothere fossils were {{collected}} from Balochistan (in modern-day Pakistan) in 1846 by a soldier named Vickary, but these fragments were unidentifiable at the time. The first fossils now recognised as Paraceratherium were discovered by the British geologist Guy Ellcock Pilgrim in Balochistan in 1907–1908. His material consisted of an upper jaw, lower teeth, {{and the back of}} a jaw. <b>The</b> <b>fossils</b> were collected in the Chitarwata Formation of Dera Bugti, where Pilgrim had previously been exploring. In 1908, he used <b>the</b> <b>fossils</b> as basis for a new species of the extinct rhinoceros genus Aceratherium; A. bugtiense. Aceratherium was by then a wastebasket taxon; it included several unrelated species of hornless rhinoceros, many of which have since been moved to other genera. Fossil incisors that Pilgrim had previously assigned to the unrelated genus Bugtitherium were later shown to belong to the new species.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>fossil</b> {{record of}} <b>the</b> hoopoes is very incomplete, with <b>the</b> {{earliest}} <b>fossil</b> coming from <b>the</b> Quaternary.

50|$|After burial {{various factors}} {{are at work}} to endanger <b>the</b> current <b>fossil's</b> {{preserved}} state. Chemical alteration would change the mineral composition of <b>the</b> <b>fossil,</b> but generally not its appearance, lithification would distort its appearance, <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> itself may be fully or partially dissolved leaving only a fossil mold.|$|R
2500|$|Concerns {{have been}} raised about the claims made about <b>the</b> <b>fossil's</b> {{relative}} importance and the publicising of <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> before adequate information was available for scrutiny by the academic community. Some of Norway's leading biologists, among them Nils Christian Stenseth, have called <b>the</b> <b>fossil</b> an [...] "exaggerated hoax" [...] and stated that its presentation and popular dissemination [...] "fundamentally violate scientific principles and ethics." ...|$|R
