5|$|A thread common {{throughout}} {{these early}} works is Monteverdi's {{use of the}} technique of imitatio, a general practice among composers of the period whereby material from earlier or contemporary composers was used as models for their own work. Monteverdi continued <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>this</b> procedure well beyond his apprentice years, a factor that in some critics' eyes has compromised his reputation for originality.|$|E

5|$|A new U.S. federal {{government}} began operating in 1789, following the {{ratification of the}} United States Constitution. The previous central government under the Articles of Confederation {{had been unable to}} levy taxes; it had borrowed money to meet expenses and fund the Revolution, accumulating $54 million in debt. The state governments had amassed an additional $25 million in debt. Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton sought <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>this</b> debt to create a financial system that would promote American prosperity and national unity. In his Report on Public Credit, he urged Congress to consolidate the state and national debts into a single debt that would be funded by the {{federal government}}. Congress approved these measures in June and July 1790.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{bay bolete}} is {{predominantly}} a mycorrhizal species, {{it does have}} some saprophytic tendencies and may be able <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>this</b> lifestyle in certain circumstances. The ectomycorrhizae formed between I.badia and spruce (Picea abies) have active hyphal sheaths and a higher potential to store nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, iron, and zinc than other mycorrhizal types, indicating the fungus is well adapted to acidic stands and its mycorrhizae are very efficient in uptake and storage of macronutrients. Mycorrhizae with Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) have also been described.|$|E

5|$|An {{idea of the}} {{complexity}} of the metabolic networks in cells that contain thousands of different enzymes is given by the figure showing the interactions between just 43 proteins and 40 metabolites to the right: the sequences of genomes provide lists containing anything up to 45,000 genes. However, it is now possible <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>this</b> genomic data to reconstruct complete networks of biochemical reactions and produce more holistic mathematical models that may explain and predict their behavior. These models are especially powerful when used to integrate the pathway and metabolite data obtained through classical methods with data on gene expression from proteomic and DNA microarray studies. Using these techniques, a model of human metabolism has now been produced, which will guide future drug discovery and biochemical research. These models are now used in network analysis, to classify human diseases into groups that share common proteins or metabolites.|$|E
5|$|Another element {{widely used}} by Gaudí was the {{catenary}} arch. He had studied geometry thoroughly {{when he was}} young, studying numerous articles about engineering, a field that praised {{the virtues of the}} catenary curve as a mechanical element, one which at that time, however, was used only in the construction of suspension bridges. Gaudí was the first <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>this</b> element in common architecture. Catenary arches in works like the Casa Milà, the Teresian College, the crypt of the Colònia Güell and the Sagrada Família allowed Gaudí to add an element of great strength to his structures, given that the catenary distributes the weight it regularly carries evenly, being affected only by self-canceling tangential forces.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{formation}} of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled an invasion force, called the Armée d'Angleterre (Army of England) around six camps at Boulogne in Northern France. He intended <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>this</b> invasion force to strike at England, and was so confident of success that he had commemorative medals struck to celebrate the conquest of the English. Although they never invaded, Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for any possible military operation. Boredom among the troops occasionally set in, but Napoleon paid many visits and conducted lavish parades in order to boost morale.|$|E

5|$|Cunningham {{continued}} with his career. In March 1938 {{he was called}} to readiness with 604 Squadron during the Munich crisis. At this time the squadron was flying the Hawker Demon. He was displeased when they converted to the Bristol Blenheim. The machines were fitted with a tray of four 303 Browning machine guns to give forward-facing firepower. As a long-range fighter it was of dubious value. The German Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Messerschmitt Bf 110 could, and would, expose the frailties of the aircraft which was originally intended as a bomber. However, Cunningham {{was told by the}} Air Ministry that it would be sufficient in the night fighter role, which is where they intended <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>this</b> variant. On 20 April 1938, John returned to de Havilland test-flying de Havilland Moth Minors.|$|E
