The COD reaction rate assay showed a {{sharp increase in}} cholesterol chemical potential as the cholesterol mole fraction approaches the solubility limit. A decline in the COD reaction rate was found after the formation <b>of</b> cholesterol crystals. <b>The</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>solubility</b> <b>of</b> brain ceramide in POPC bilayers was determined to be 68 (2 mol % by microscopy. We found that ceramide has a much higher affinity for the ordered bilayers than cholesterol, and <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>solubility</b> <b>of</b> cholesterol decreases with the increase in ceramide content. More significantly, the displacement of cholesterol by ceramide follows a 1 : 1 relation. At the cholesterol solubility limit, adding one more ceramide molecule to the lipid bilayer drives one cholesterol out of the bilayer into the cholesterol crystal phase, and cholesterol is incapable of displacing ceramide from the bilayer phase. On the basis of these findings, a ternary phase diagram of the POPC/cholesterol/ceramide mixture was constructed. The behaviors of ceramide and cholesterol {{can be explained by the}} umbrella model. Both ceramide and cholesterol have small polar headgroups and relatively large nonpolar bodies.

40|$|Zincite and spinel phases {{are present}} in the complex slag systems {{encountered}} in zinc/lead sintering and zinc smelting processes. These phases form extensive solid solutions and are stable over a wide range of compositions, temperatures and oxygen partial pressures. Accurate information on the stability of these phases is required in order to develop thermodynamic models of these slag systems. Phase equilibria in the Fe–Zn–O system have been experimentally studied for a range of conditions, between 900 °C and 1580 °C and oxygen partial pressures (pO 2) between air and metallic iron saturation, using equilibration and quenching techniques. The compositions of the phases were measured using Electron probe X-ray microanalysis (EPMA). The ferrous and ferric bulk iron concentrations were determined using a specially developed wet-chemical analysis procedure based on the use of ammonium metavanadate. XRD was used to confirm phase identification. A procedure was developed to overcome the problems associated with evaporation of zinc at low pO 2 values and to ensure the achievement of equilibria. An isothermal section of the system FeO–Fe 2 O 3 –ZnO at high ZnO concentrations at 1200 °C was constructed. <b>The</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>solubilities</b> <b>of</b> iron and zinc in zincite and spinel phases in equilibrium were determined at pO 2 = 1 × 10 - 6 atm at 1200 °C and 1300 °C.

40|$|We {{determined}} <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>solubilities</b> <b>of</b> cholesterol in aqueous conjugated bile salt-egg lecithin-cholesterol {{systems as}} a function of several physical-chemical variables including those of physiological importance employing phase equilibria techniques. Equilibration rates are influenced by time and the method of sample preparation in that metastable supersaturation is readily induced at high bile salt: lecithin ratios, and equilibrium saturation by dissolution is achieved sluggisly at low bile salt:lecithin ratios. Equilibrium values for cholesterol saturation vary with the bile salt species, bile salt: lecithin ratio, temperature, ionic strength, and, in particular, with the total concentration of biliary lipids. Within physiological bile salt:lecithin ratios at 37 degreesC the influence of bile salt type and ionic strength is small, whereas the effects of bile salt:lecithin ratio and the total lipid concentration are major factors. We plotted on triangular coordinates a family of cholesterol solubility curves for each total lipid concentration (0. 30 [...] 30 g/dl) and computed fifth-degree polynomial equations for each curve. With both the curves and the polynomial equations the "per cent cholesterol saturation" of fasting gallbladder and hepatic biles from patients with and without gallstones was calculated and both methods gave similar values. These results deomonstrate that by employing cholesterol saturation values appropriate to the total lipid concentration (range 0. 2 [...] 24. 9 g/dl) of individual biles, all cholesterol stone patients have supersaturated gallbladder biles, (mean, 132 % [normal weight individuals], and 199 % [morbidly obese individuals]). With controls and pigment stone patients the mean values were 95 and 98 %, respectively, and in both approximately 50 % of biles were supersaturated. Fasting hepatic biles were significantly more supersaturated than gallbladder biles (means 228 [...] 273 %). Cholesterol monohydrate crystals were found in the majority of gallbladder (83 %) and hepatic (58 %) biles of cholesterol gallstone patients but were not observed in pigment stone patients or controls. We conclude that of the several factors in addition to the bile salt:lecithin ratios which can influence the cholesterol saturation of bile the total lipid concentration is the predominant determinant physiologically. Our results demonstrate that (a) metastable supersaturation is frequent in both normal and abnormal biles, (b) cholesterol gallstone patients have supersaturated gallbladder and hepatic biles without exception, and (c) the predominant driving force for cholesterol precipitation appears to be the absolute degree of cholesterol supersaturation...|$|E

40|$|Fused {{glass beads}} as a sample {{preparation}} method for X-ray Fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) {{were introduced in}} 1957 by Claisse; it soon became the preferred method to introduce oxide samples to the spectrometer, because heterogeneity, mineralogical and particle size effects are eliminated during the fusion process. Matrix effects are largely reduced by the resulting dilution. With the recent advances in XRF spectrometers, instruments with enhanced generator and temperature stability, improved sensitivity (even for light elements), and effective matrix correction software are available. Consequently, the largest proportion of analytical error results from the sample preparation step. Sampling error will always contribute the largest overall error {{but that is not}} the topic of this discussion. After more than 50 years of fused bead use in XRF analysis, certain matrices remain problematic. Although many fusion methods for chromite-, sulphide- and cassiterite-rich materials have been published, easily reproduced, routine methods for these still elude analytical chemists. Lengthy fusions at temperatures higher than 1100 ºC are often prescribed for refractory materials and ores, and until recently one of the biggest challenges was a metal-bearing sample e. g. contained in slags or certain refractory materials. This study was conducted to identify and elucidate the reactions occurring in the formation of a lithium borate glass, but also between the lithium borate and oxides during glass formation. Different analytical techniques were used to investigate the reactions occurring during the fusion process based on theoretical glass-making principles. As a starting point, Thermo Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) were used jointly to evaluate the reactions occurring during the fusion of lithium borate glasses, and at a later stage, oxide/flux mixtures. When a different TGA instrument was used, Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used in conjunction with the TGA. Observed reactions were modelled in a muffle furnace to produce identical material in larger quantities, and this material was then investigated using X-ray Powder Diffractometry (XRD), Raman Spectroscopy and Electron Microprobe Analysis (EPMA). The most enlightening result from the TGA/DSC results was the large mass loss above 1050 ºC. Literature often prescribes prolonged fusions at elevated temperatures for certain fusions, but it was proved beyond reasonable doubt that this practise causes volatilisation of the flux and leads to erroneous analytical results. The next analytical technique applied to the flux and flux/oxide samples was XRD. Where pre-fused fluxes were investigated, the XRD data served as confirmation of the glassy state of the pre-fused flux as a broad humpy scan indicative of an amorphous material was seen in stead of a diffractogram with sharp, well defined peaks. After heating to above the temperature of re-crystallisation, the phases present could be identified from the diffractogram. Provisional results using the in-situ, high temperature stage point towards the possibility of using this technique to great effect to investigate the presence of different phases formed at high temperatures. Flux-oxide mixtures were measured on the high temperature stage and after cooling a new phase was observed indicating that new phases formed during a fusion reaction. As the heating stage is slow-cooled, the chance of crystallisation in the glass is good, providing the possibility for investigating this formation of new phases at elevated temperatures further with a more suitable heating element that will contain the material. Raman spectroscopy was subsequently used to gain information about the bonds within the flux. Pure lithium tetraborate and lithium metaborate fluxes were analysed as well as flux oxide mixtures. The vibrations could not be predicted from first principles as band broadening occurs in glasses that makes theoretical predictions very difficult. The data obtained was compared to similar studies in literature and good agreement was found. In oxide-flux mixtures definite new bands were observed that was not part of the flux or oxide spectrum. EPMA results allowed calculation of <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>solubilities</b> <b>of</b> an oxide in a specific flux. It was done using Cr 2 O 3 and ZrO 2 and compared well with experimental values obtained from literature. The microscope images revealed some new insights into the theory of XRF fusions. It could clearly be seen that dissociation of the minerals in the sample occurred, thus proving that no mineralogical effects exist in a fused glass bead, and it could be observed that the flux oxide mixture devitrify when over saturated.

This would cause swelling and unfolding of protein molecules (Damodaran 1996) and possible loss of functionality. Similarly, when pH is above the isoelectric pH, protein <b>solubility</b> increases. Typically, <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>solubility</b> <b>of</b> protein occurs in alkaline solutions. Damodaran (1996) noted that when ionic strength is low (NaCl concentration < 0.5 M) the <b>solubility</b> <b>of</b> proteins that contain polar surface domains typically increases. The effects of pH and salt concentration demonstrated in this study are in agreement with the literature. Lindeboom and Wanasundara (2007) extracted protein from yellow mustard (Sinapis alba) using water at different pHs (3.5 - 10.0). They discovered that the protein content of the extracts increased when the pH was above 7.5, and was as high as 25 mg/ml at pH 10.0.|$|R
40|$|The {{microstructural}} {{details of}} fourteen Mg–Al–Sr alloys were investigated in the as-cast form {{by a combination}} of scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectrometer (SEM/EDS) analysis and quantitative electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). The heat transfer method coupled with the DSC measurement has been utilized to determine the solidification curves of the alloys. The morphology and the chemical composition of the phases were characterized. The microstructure of the alloys is primarily dominated by (Mg) and (Al 4 Sr). In the present investigation, ternary solid <b>solubility</b> <b>of</b> three binary compounds extended into the ternary system has been reported and denoted as: (Al 4 Sr), (Mg 17 Sr 2) and (Mg 38 Sr 9). The (Al 4 Sr) phase is a substitutional solid solution represented by MgxAl 4 −xSr and has a plate-like structure. <b>The</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>solubility</b> <b>of</b> Al in Mg 17 Sr 2 was found to be 21. 3 at%. It was also observed that Mg 38 Sr 9 dissolved 12. 5 at% Al...|$|R
30|$|With {{subduction}} of crustal {{rocks to}} mantle depths, {{the majority of}} water is released {{in the form of}} molecular water through breakdown of hydrous minerals. Significant amounts of structural hydroxyl and molecular water are also dissolved into NAMs with increasing pressure (Zheng 2009). <b>The</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>solubility</b> <b>of</b> water in <b>the</b> NAMs is achieved at <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> pressure during subduction to mantle depths (Chen et al. 2011; Gong et al. 2013). During the exhumation of deeply subducted crustal rocks, on the other hand, the water in the NAMs is exsolved due to its decreased solubility with decreasing pressure (Zheng 2009). The liberated water may result in the formation of retrograde hydrous minerals in UHP rocks (Zheng et al. 2003). If exhumation occurs at elevated temperatures, the hydrous UHP minerals such as phengite may break down during decompression, resulting in local anatexis of the UHP rocks (Gao et al. 2012, 2013; Chen et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2013).|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of pH on {{the changes in}} myofibrillar remaining ATPase activities of M. rosenbergii and P. monodon was studied after storage at - 20 °C for 2 days, 0 °C for 2 days and 35 °C for 30 min. In all the three storage conditions, ATPase activities for both samples were lower in acidic and alkaline pH regions and the activity remains relatively high of 0. 403 ° mol Pi/min mg at pH 8. 1. The {{influence of}} pH on the remaining Mg 2 + -ATPase activity and Ca-sensitivity of M. rosenbergii and P. monodon were evaluated after storage at 0 °C for 2 days and - 20 °C for 2 days. Mg 2 + -ATPase activities both in presence and absence of Ca 2 + remain high at neutral pH compared to those of acidic and alkaline region. Ca-sensitivity were also very high (about 38 to 50 % at pH ranges from 7. 4 to 8. 3) in neutral pH region where the sensitivity declined sharply both in acidic and alkaline pH region. The influence of pH on the changes in <b>solubility</b> <b>of</b> M. rosenbergii muscle myofibrils during ice and frozen storage was investigated. The highest <b>solubility</b> <b>of</b> 83 to 84 % was obtained from myofibrils {{in the range of}} pH 7. 4 to pH 7. 9 after storage for 2 days in ice and - 20 °C for 2 days in frozen storage. The solubility decreased gradually both in acidic and alkaline pH regions. In the case <b>of</b> P. monodon, <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>solubility</b> <b>of</b> 84 % were obtained at pH 7. 9 after 2 days of storage at 0 °C. Similarly <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>solubility</b> <b>of</b> 79 % were obtained at same pH of 7. 8 in myofibrils after storage at - 20 °C for 2 days. The <b>solubility</b> <b>of</b> P. monodon myofibrils was quite high {{in a wide range of}} pH from 6. 8 to 8. 3 and the solubility decreased gradually outside of these pH ranges. Comparatively higher <b>solubility</b> <b>of</b> 84 % in a wide range of pH in myofibrils stored at 0 °C compared to that of frozen storage also indicates the combined effect of pH and frozen storage on the denaturation of muscle myofibrils...|$|R
40|$|Enzymes from extremophiles {{operate at}} {{conditions}} that are different from their `normal' counterparts, {{and are therefore a}} useful extension of the enzyme toolbox. In this paper, the direct glucosylation reaction mediated by a hyperthermophilic -glucosidase from Pyrocuccus furiosus was investigated. Hexanol was successfully coupled to glucose with this enzyme. A preliminary study was conducted to improve the product yield. A maximum product concentration of 12. 9 g. l- 1 was attainable by increasing the glucose concentration to <b>the</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>solubility</b> <b>of</b> 2000 g. (kg buffer solution) - 1 at the reaction temperature. The highest glucose based yield of 2. 64 as achieved with a glucose concentration of 900 g. (kg buffer solution) - 1 at a reaction temperature of 65 °C and a pH of 6. 0. Performing the reaction at higher pH and temperature led to lower product concentrations. This was caused by deactivation of the enzyme accompanied by browning of the reaction mixture.
