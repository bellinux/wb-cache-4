5|$|Dunrobin Castle {{was built}} {{in the midst of a}} tribal society, with Norse and Gaelic in use at the time. Robert the Bruce planted the Gordons, who {{supported}} his claim to the crown, at Huntly in Aberdeenshire, and they were created Earls of Huntly in 1445. The Earldom passed to the Gordon family in the 16th century when the 8th Earl of Sutherland gave his daughter Elizabeth in marriage <b>to</b> <b>Adam</b> Gordon. After the 8th Earl died in 1508, Elizabeth's elder brother was declared heir to the title, but a brieve (writ) of idiocy brought against him and his younger brother by the Gordons meant that the possession of the estate went <b>to</b> <b>Adam</b> Gordon in 1512.|$|E
5|$|According <b>to</b> <b>Adam</b> of Bremen and the Saxo Grammaticus, Roskilde {{was founded}} in the 980s by Harald Bluetooth. On high ground above the harbour, he built a wooden church consecrated to the Holy Trinity {{as well as a}} royal {{residence}} nearby. Although no traces of these buildings have been discovered, in 1997 archaeologists found the remains of Viking ships in the Isefjord, the oldest of which is dated to 1030. At the time, there were also two churches in the area: St Jørgensbjerg, an early stone church, and a wooden church discovered under today's St Ib's Church. Harald was buried in the wooden church he had built on the site of today's Roskilde Cathedral.|$|E

Over the entire course of the election, the Adams {{campaign}} was one of the top fundraisers among the southeastern Nebraska legislative races, raising $68,000 and spending $54,000; the Friesen campaign raised $34,000 and spent the same.

5|$|The World Before the Flood is an oil {{painting}} on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited in 1828 and {{currently in the}} Southampton City Art Gallery. It depicts a scene from John Milton's Paradise Lost in which, among a series of visions of the future shown <b>to</b> <b>Adam,</b> he sees the world immediately before the Great Flood. The painting illustrates the stages of courtship as described by Milton; {{a group of men}} select wives from a group of dancing women, drag their chosen woman from the group, and settle down to married life. Behind the courting group, an oncoming storm looms, a symbol of the destruction which the dancers and lovers are about to bring upon themselves.|$|E

5|$|The tenants of {{the manor}} {{apparently}} took their name from it; a Gregory de South Stoneham (or Gegory de Stoneham) is recorded there in 1236 and 1249, and in 1315 the manor {{was held by}} Nicholas de South Stoneham (son of Guy de South Stoneham). In 1348 Thomas de Stoneham and his wife Alice were lord and lady of the manor, and five heiresses of theirs– possibly daughters– held the manor in 1367. However, that year they quitclaimed it <b>to</b> <b>Adam</b> le Chaundle.|$|E
5|$|According to Patrick Drazen, {{the series}} {{contains}} numerous allusions to the Kojiki and the Nihongi, the Shinto {{vision of the}} primordial cosmos and the mythical lances of the Shinto deities Izanagi and Izanami. Elements of the Judeo-Christian tradition also feature prominently throughout the series, including references <b>to</b> <b>Adam,</b> Lilith, Eve, the Lance of Longinus, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Kabbalistic concept of Adam Kadmon, the Tree of Life, among many others. The merging of all human souls into one through the Human Instrumentality Project {{at the end of}} the series is similar to the Kabbalistic concept of tikkun olam. The Evangelions have been likened to the golem of Jewish folklore, and their visual design resembles the traditional depictions of oni (Japanese demons or ogres).|$|E
5|$|Adam (Peter Krause) is {{stressed}} {{about work}} because his boss Gordon (William Baldwin) feels {{he is too}} distracted by family issues. Sarah (Lauren Graham), frustrated with her children for losing their shoes, off-handedly remarks <b>to</b> <b>Adam</b> about her desire for a LoJack to help locate missing shoes. Put on the spot for new ideas at work, Adam pitches the LoJack idea and Gordon loves it, insisting Adam start developing it. When Sarah learns this later she is excited, but feels upset she is not given credit. When Zeek (Craig T. Nelson) encouraged her {{to stand up for}} herself, Sarah confronts Adam, but claims he has made many sacrifices for Sarah in the past and never asked for anything in return. Later, however, Adam tells Gordon it was Sarah's idea. That night, Adam apologizes to Sarah and offers her an internship at the company's design department, which she happily accepts.|$|E

5|$|In {{medieval times}} the {{township}} {{was within the}} manor of Castlerigg and Derwentwater. The earliest surviving official record of the town is the market charter of 1276 granted to {{the lord of the}} manor, Thomas de Derwentwater. The manor was granted by Alice de Romilly <b>to</b> <b>Adam</b> de Derwentwater before 1216, and subsequently passed to the Radclyffe family through marriage. The Derwentwater estate was forfeit to the Crown after the execution of James Radclyffe, third Earl of Derwentwater, in 1716 for his part in the Jacobite rebellion the previous year. In 1735 the Crown granted the income from the estates to support the Greenwich Hospital, London. Land to the south and west were part of Greenwich Hospital's forestry and farming estates until the 19th century. In 1925 the then owner, Sir John Randles, gave the National Trust 90 acres of land in this estate, including the foreshore woodland.|$|E

5|$|The Assembly {{worked in}} the Reformed Protestant {{theological}} tradition, also known as Calvinism. It took the Bible as the authoritative word of God, from which all theological reflection must be based. The divines were committed to the Reformed doctrine of predestination—that God chooses certain men to be saved and enjoy eternal life rather than eternal punishment. There was some disagreement at the Assembly over the doctrine of particular redemption—that Christ died only for those chosen for salvation. The Assembly also held to Reformed covenant theology, a framework for interpreting the Bible. The Assembly's Confession {{is the first of}} the Reformed confessions to teach a doctrine called the covenant of works, which teaches that before the fall of man, God promised eternal life <b>to</b> <b>Adam</b> on condition that he perfectly obeyed God.|$|E
5|$|The character's {{death was}} and {{continues}} to be ranked in public polls of various opinions. It was voted Best Drama Moment on the BBC's annual TV Moments broadcast in 2004. The same year, a poll conducted for National Pub Week ranked the scene where a barman scoops some of Rachel's ashes into a bucket the fifth best of various pub-related television scenes. In 2008, the death was ranked at number three in Sky One's 50 Greatest TV Endings programme. In a 2010 public poll to promote Freeview HD, Rachel's death was ranked as the seventh most emotional TV moment. In 2011, Rachel's wedding <b>to</b> <b>Adam</b> was placed at number nine in Channel 5's Greatest TV Weddings programme. Colin McAllister opined that every woman's heart broke when they married.|$|E
5|$|After {{not telling}} anyone about hitting Delia, Adam fears the {{investigation}} is closing in on him. He names Jack Connor's godfather and makes him promise to protect him should anything happen to him, and then proposes to Chelsea again and asks her to move to Paris with him, like they had planned during their first marriage. At the same time, Victor's private investigation on the hit-and-run driver leads him <b>to</b> <b>Adam.</b> He agrees to not turn him in {{as long as he}} can take part in Connor's life; a role he had initially refused him. Adam agrees as he and Chelsea remarry. Days before their flight to Paris, Delia's father Billy Abbott (Billy Miller) puts the pieces together and realizes Adam is the one who killed his daughter. He holds him at gunpoint and demands he drive them to places where milestones in Delia's life occurred. While driving, Adam attempts to grab the gun as a shot is fired and the car drives off a ravine. One of them staggers away from the crash and collapses, revealed to be Billy. Nick and Paul Williams (Doug Davidson) find the overturned vehicle as it catches fire and explodes. Adam's body is thrown from the vehicle, is not recovered and he is presumed dead, devastating Chelsea just as news that Adam killed Delia breaks. However, Adam's bloody hand is later shown to be moving, alluding that he survived. Soon after, he is shown to be lying in a bed, being held captive by an unknown captor. Later Victor informs Chelsea that his investigators have found Adam's remains, but elsewhere Adam is seen paying off Victor's investigator, confirming that Adam has faked his death.|$|E
