5|$|The party {{arrives at}} a giant Mechat base in the clouds and are tossed into the throne room of Nene, the {{apparent}} leader. Nene explains to them how he enjoys hearing <b>the</b> <b>screams</b> <b>of</b> the dying victims of the Land Shark. The party battles Nene, but are easily defeated. They are {{thrown out of the}} base and start to fall to their deaths, but a beam of light from the base catches them, and brings them back to the base. The party find three small floating spheres {{in the middle of the}} room; a mysterious voice commands them to swallow the spheres. The party refuses, and instead hold onto the spheres for safekeeping. As they try to reach another Mechat to escape the base, they are forced to fight a large army of Nene's robots. When the battle seems it will never end, and with the unseen voice promising them knowledge of how to pilot the Mechat, the party members eat the spheres. As they consume the spheres, a strange transformation occurs to each, changing the forms of their shadows into powerful beings that are able to destroy the robot army. The party escapes the base and crash in a desert.|$|E

25|$|The {{first to}} arrive on the scene were nurses and doctors from nearby Bucur Maternity Hospital, who were on duty that Friday night. They heard <b>the</b> <b>screams</b> <b>of</b> the injured {{and went out to}} the street in robes and {{slippers}} to provide first aid. The first 112 call came at 10:32p.m., and the first emergency service arrived 11 minutes after the call. The State Secretary at the Ministry of Health, Raed Arafat, and deputy Prime Minister Gabriel Oprea arrived at the scene late in the night.|$|E
25|$|There were secret {{staircases}} {{and hidden}} spaces which {{were used to}} overhear the discussions in the prison cells. The ceiling of the torture chamber was especially designed to muffle {{the cries of the}} victims. Inside the torture chamber, furnaces and grates were also present. Up to 1850 the chambers were shown to visitors after which time the ecclesiastical authorities of Avignon decided to shut them down. In a similar vein the torture chamber of the Spanish Inquisition in Lima, Peru had one metre thick walls so that <b>the</b> <b>screams</b> <b>of</b> the victims could not penetrate them.|$|E
25|$|The {{citizens}} of Houston knew a powerful storm had blown through {{and had made}} ready to provide assistance. Workers set out by rail and ship for the island almost immediately. Rescuers arrived to find the city completely destroyed. It is believed 8,000people—20% of the island's population—had lost their lives. Estimates range from 6,000 to 12,000. Most had drowned or been crushed as the waves pounded the debris that had been their homes hours earlier. Many survived the storm itself but died after several days being trapped under {{the wreckage of the}} city, with rescuers unable to reach them. The rescuers could hear <b>the</b> <b>screams</b> <b>of</b> the survivors as they walked on the debris trying to rescue those they could. A further 30,000 were left homeless.|$|E

25|$|The {{method of}} {{construction}} of the torture chamber of the papal palace at Avignon, used during the Inquisition, {{has been described as}} ingenious. The construction of some of the torture chambers at Avignon was based on principles of Acoustics, specifically designed to muffle the screams and cries of the tortured. The walls of the torture chamber recessed and protruded in a complementary fashion to the walls on the opposite side so as to reflect <b>the</b> <b>screams</b> <b>of</b> the victims locally, ensuring that their shrieks would not be carried to the exterior. A chamber located above the main torture chamber had a dungeon with a hole near {{the middle of the floor}} through which, according to accounts, the tortured bodies of the prisoners were thrown into a cavity. The chamber where the victims were being burnt was of circular construction and resembled the furnace of a glass-house with a funnel-like chimney at the top.|$|E
25|$|The {{lower parts}} of the Magdalena River were {{inhabited}} by numerous indigenous groups who resisted the Spanish conquistadors with canoes, fighting using poisoned arrows. This held the Spanish troops back and the reduced army joined forces on land in Sompallón, where they had lost already 100 men. The two conquistadors who reached this area first were Juan de Sanct Martín and Juan de Céspedes. Many of the disgruntled soldiers wanted {{to return to the}} relative safety of Santa Marta, but father Juan Domingo de las Casas persuaded the soldiers to continue, at the risk of being called cowards if they refused. The expedition split in two again, with one part ascending further the Magdalena River and the main part through the thick forests of the right bank of the river. Here they encountered many natural dangers, such as jaguars, wild boar, snakes, mosquitoes, spiders, stinky grisons and the many spines and poisonous plants in the forest. Even anteaters had attacked the troops and almost killed a horse. Pioneers with machetes were sent ahead to create pathways through the dense jungle, a task that could take up to 8 days for a path crossed by the army in hours. The troops took shelter from the heavy rains below trees and ate fruits and wild roots to survive. Many of the soldiers became ill and died due to snake bites and jaguar attacks. They crossed the many creeks and rivers tributary to the Magdalena swimming, where the caymans formed another risk. Apart from the natural hazards, also the indigenous people attacked the Spanish with their arrows, clubs and canoes. At night, when the soldiers were sleeping unprotected in their hammocks, the jaguars attacked and killed them, and in many cases <b>the</b> <b>screams</b> <b>of</b> the men were not heard because of the thunderstorms.|$|E

500|$|Though Jackson {{considered}} the ending [...] "overwrought", {{he felt that}} it [...] "pulled the rug"; [...] "turning on a sixpence, <b>the</b> <b>screams</b> <b>of</b> 'Kathy' turned truly horrifying; the tackiness suddenly real and disturbing". Mellor {{considered the}} ending [...] "a terrific twist {{as long as you}} didn’t look at it too closely", arguing that the interviewer's patience and the crew's collusion were unlikely. However, she suggested, there is little to be gained by criticising these aspects of the episode. For Baylis, the ending was unexpected, revealing [...] "darkness of the shabby human kind". In the closing seconds of the episode, he said, [...] "we suddenly saw it all, without seeing anything".|$|E

500|$|According to French and German prosecutors, {{the crash}} was {{deliberately}} {{caused by the}} co-pilot, Andreas Lubitz. Brice Robin said Lubitz was initially courteous to Captain Sondenheimer during {{the first part of}} the flight, then became [...] "curt" [...] when the captain began the mid-flight briefing on the planned landing. Robin said when the captain returned from a probable toilet break and tried to enter the cockpit, Lubitz had locked the door. The captain had a code to unlock the door, but the lock's code panel can be disabled from the cockpit controls. The captain requested re-entry using the intercom; he knocked and then banged on the door, but received no response. The captain then tried to break down the door. During the descent, the co-pilot did not respond to questions from air traffic control and did not transmit a distress call. Robin said contact from the Marseille air traffic control tower, the captain's attempts to break in, and Lubitz's steady breathing were audible on the cockpit voice recording. <b>The</b> <b>screams</b> <b>of</b> passengers in the last moments before impact were also heard on the recording.|$|E
