Based on the chemical fluorescence method (CFM), a diagnostic system was set up to image electronically excited fluorescent I- 2 (B- 3 Pi(o)) by means of a high speed camera. An optimized data analysis approach was proposed to analyze the mixing process of supersonic oxygen-iodine parallel streams, employing a set of qualitative and quantitative parameters and a proper percentage boundary threshold of the fluorescence zone. A slit nozzle bank with supersonic parallel streams and a trip <b>tab</b> <b>set</b> for enhancing the mixing process were designed and fabricated. With the diagnostic system and the data analysis approach, the performance of the trip <b>tab</b> <b>set</b> was examined and is demonstrated in this work. With the mixing enhancement, the fluorescence zone area was enlarged 3. 75 times. We have studied the mixing process under different flow conditions and demonstrated the mixing properties with different iodine buffer gases, including N- 2, Ar, He and CO 2. It was found that, among the four tested gases, Ar had the best penetration ability, whilst He showed the best free diffusion ability, and both of them could be well used as the buffer gas in our experiments. These experimental results can be useful for designing and optimizing COIL systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Summary. [...] It {{has been}} {{suggested}} in some American investigations that differential gearing, combined with adjustment of the aileron floating angle {{by means of a}} tab, may be a powerful method of balancing ailerons. This report sets out the theory of this method of balance and analysesit in relation to the most pressing problem of aileron design, which is to obtain close balance at high speed without overbalance in any part of the range, or uncomfortable lightness at slow speed. It is shown that this result can be achieved more directly by differential balance than by any other method if the differential and the <b>tab</b> <b>setting</b> are nicely adjusted to the natural floating properties of the aileron. Thus if the aileron tends to float up as incidence increases, a differential giving more downward than upward movement must be used, and this must be combined with an upward-set tab; while if the aileron tends to float down as the incidence increases, a differential giving more upward than downward movement must be used, combined with a downset tab. After examining the possible disadvantages of the downward differential, and the loads set up by the tab, it is concluded that there is a strong case for exploration in flight of differential gearing as a major means of aileron bMance. Some notes on the geometry of differential gearing are given in an Appendix. 1. Introduction. [...] In the past,. when ailerons have been moved differentially, it has always been with the object rather of improving the rolling moments than of lightening the stick force. -The potentiality of differential gearing as a major means of aileion balance has been broache...|$|R

40|$|Because {{the results}} of {{preliminary}} flight tests had indicated. the P- 63 A- 1 airplane possessed insufficient directional stability, the NACA and the manufacturer (Bell Aircraft Corporation) suggested three vertical-tail modifications {{to remedy the deficiencies}} in the directional characteristics. These modifications included an enlarged vertical tail formed by adding a tip extension to the original vertical tail, a large sharp-edge ventral fin, and a small dorsal fin. The enlarged vertical tail involved only a slight increase in total vertical-tail area from 23. 73 to 26. 58 square feet but a relatively much larger increase in geometric aspect ratio from 1. 24 to 1. 73 based on height and area above the horizontal tail. At the request of the Air Material Command, Army Air Forces, flight tests were made to determine the effect of these modifications and of some combinations of these modifications on the directional stability and control characteristics of the airplane, In all, six different vertical-tail. configurations were investigated to determine the lateral and directional oscillation characteristics of the airplane, the sideslip characteristics, the yaw due to ailerons in rudder-fixed rolls from turns and pull-outs, the trim changes due to speed changes; and the trim changes due to power changes. Results of the tests showed that the enlarged vertical tail approximately doubled the directional stability of the airplane and that the pilots considered the directional stability provided by the enlarged vertical tail to be satisfactory. Calculations based on sideslip data obtained at an indicated airspeed of 300 miles per hour showed that the directional stability of the airplane with the original vertical tail corresponded to a value of 0 (sub n beta) of - 0. 00056 whereas for the enlarged vertical tail the estimated va 1 ue of C(sub n beta) was - 0. 00130, The ventral fin was found to increase by a moderate amount the directional stability of the airplane with the original vertical tail for smal 1 sides 1 ip angles at low speeds but little consistent change in directional stability was effected by the ventral fin at higher speeds, The effectiveness of the ventral fin was generally much less when used with the enlarged vertical tail than when used with the original vertical tail. The ventral and dorsal fins were found to be very effective in eliminating rudder-force reversals which occurred in low-speed, high-engine-power, sideslipped conditions of flight. Sideslip tests at two altitudes for approximately the sane engine power and indicated airspeed showed that a small decrease in static directional stability occurred with increasing altitude and this decrease in stability was attributed to the increased propeller blade angles required at high altitudes. The variations of rudder pedal force with indicated airspeed using normal rated power and a constant rudder <b>tab</b> <b>setting</b> through the speed range were desirably small for all the configurations tested. The rudder pedal force changed by about 50 pounds for a power change from engine idling power, to normal rated power and this pedal force change was largely independent of airspeed or of vertical-tail configuration for the various configurations tested...|$|R

40|$|The {{spacecraft}} in {{the next}} series of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES-Next) are Earth pointing and have 5 -year mission lifetimes. Because gyros can be depended on {{only for a few}} years of continuous use, they will be turned off during routine operations. This means attitude must, at times, be determined without benefit of gyros and, often, using only Earth sensor data. To minimize the interruption caused by dumping angular momentum, these spacecraft have been designed to reduce the environmental torque acting on them and incorporate an adjustable solar trim tab for fine adjustment. A new support requirement for GOES-Next is that of setting the solar trim <b>tab.</b> Optimizing its <b>setting</b> requires an estimate of the unbalanced torque on the spacecraft. These two requirements, determining attitude without gyros and estimating the external torque, are addressed by replacing or supplementing the gyro propagation with a dynamic one, that is, one that integrates the rigid body equations of motion. By processing quarter-orbit or longer batches, this approach takes advantage of roll-yaw coupling to observe attitude completely without Sun sensor data. Telemetered momentum wheel speeds are used as observations of the unbalanced external torques. GOES-Next provides a unique opportunity to study dynamic attitude propagation. The geosynchronous altitude and adjustable trim tab minimize the external torque and its uncertainty, making long-term dynamic propagation feasible.
