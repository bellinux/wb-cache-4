40|$|A novel {{diagnosis}} {{method is}} proposed {{in this paper}} that uses {{the results of the}} blended HAZID analysis extended to the dynamic case of process systems controlled by operational procedures. The algorithm is capable of finding fault root causes in process systems using nominal and observed possible faulty operational procedure execution traces. The algorithm uses the structural decomposition of the process system and its component-level dynamic HAZID (P-HAZID) tables and executes the diagnosis component-wise by first decomposing the observed execution traces, and <b>then</b> <b>assembling</b> <b>the</b> diagnosis results. The exact structure of the algorithm is also discussed, followed by two case studies on which its operation is demonstrated. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
