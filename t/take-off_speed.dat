25|$|In October 2011, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau {{released}} {{the findings of}} their investigation into the incident. They found that human error was the cause, and urged the development of technological aids that would alert pilots to incorrect data entry or insufficient <b>take-off</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E
25|$|However, at slow speeds, {{the current}} induced in these coils and the {{resultant}} magnetic flux is not large enough to levitate the train. For this reason, the train must have wheels or some other form of landing gear to support the train until it reaches <b>take-off</b> <b>speed.</b> Since a train may stop at any location, due to equipment problems for instance, the entire track {{must be able to}} support both low- and high-speed operation.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{incidents}} {{have shown}} that the production of <b>take-off</b> <b>speeds</b> is an activity vulnerable to miscalculations with a potential for disastrous outcomes. The aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze the calculation of the <b>take-off</b> <b>speeds</b> in a modern airline cockpit as a distributed cognitive activity in order to identify possible vulnerabilities in this process. We took the cockpit as the joint cognitive system under analysis and conducted an ethnographic study based on documental analysis, flight observations, interviews, and the analysis of 22 events involving failures related to the calculation of <b>take-off</b> <b>speeds.</b> The main argument is that the cognitive systems engineering perspective, with less focus on the human contribution than it is common in investigations, levels people and artifacts in the system as equal contributors to its eventual performance. Our analysis identified four assertions regarding vulnerabilities in the process of <b>take-off</b> <b>speeds</b> calculation: (1) representations at the level of the cockpit are always partial and incomplete; (2) some interactions require interpretation rather than institution; (3) interactions of agents do not follow a canonical process of coordination; (4) the control of the prevention of failures is accurate but inadequate. These vulnerabilities are a matter of interactions among cognitive systems in the cockpit, rather than vulnerabilities of individual agents, such as humans or artifacts. No Full Tex...|$|R
50|$|The runways were {{originally}} grass. The Bristol Blenheim light bombers that first used the field {{were able to}} operate under the existing conditions, although landings often produced pronounced water splashes, but the weight of heavier bombers tore ruts in the grass surface and limited <b>take-off</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R

500|$|Additionally, due to {{the high}} average <b>take-off</b> <b>speed</b> of , Concorde needed {{upgraded}} brakes. Like most airliners, Concorde has anti-skid braking– a system which prevents the tyres from losing traction when the brakes are applied for greater control during roll-out. The brakes, developed by Dunlop, were the first carbon-based brakes used on an airliner. The use of carbon over equivalent steel brakes provided a weight-saving of [...] Each wheel has multiple discs which are cooled by electric fans. Wheel sensors include brake overload, brake temperature, and tyre deflation. After a typical landing at Heathrow, brake temperatures were around [...] For landing Concorde required a minimum of [...] runway length, this in fact being considerably less than the shortest runway Concorde ever actually landed on, that of Cardiff Airport.|$|E
500|$|Between [...] and [...] {{down the}} runway, the {{aircraft}} reached <b>take-off</b> <b>speed,</b> lifted off the ground, and began climbing normally as the crew retracted the landing gear. Upon climbing through , the aircraft began banking to the right. The climbing bank {{continued to increase}} at a rate which alarmed witnesses, and soon after the aircraft rolled through 90° (at which point the wings were vertical to the ground). At a height of around , with all four engines producing take-off thrust, the nose began to fall. Moments later the right wing and nose impacted the ground, causing the fuselage to cartwheel over, before the aircraft came to rest, with the correct side up. It was immediately engulfed in flames. All {{three members of the}} flight crew were instantly killed. Although emergency services at Long Island MacArthur promptly responded to the crash, the aircraft was destroyed by the post-crash fire.|$|E
2500|$|An {{afterburner}} (or reheat) is {{an additional}} component added to some jet engines, primarily those on military supersonic aircraft. Its purpose {{is to provide a}} temporary increase in thrust, both for supersonic flight and for takeoff (as the high wing loading typical of supersonic aircraft designs means that <b>take-off</b> <b>speed</b> is very high). [...] On military aircraft the extra thrust is also useful for combat situations. [...] This is achieved by injecting additional fuel into the jet pipe downstream of (i.e. after) the turbine and combusting it. [...] The advantage of afterburning is significantly increased thrust; the disadvantage is its very high fuel consumption and inefficiency, though this is often regarded as acceptable for the short periods during which it is usually used.|$|E
50|$|Early {{aircraft}} designers {{appreciated that}} whilst low <b>take-off</b> <b>speeds</b> required wings with high lift, high camber sections, more symmetric, low camber sections produced less drag at speed. One {{solution was to}} make a wing sufficiently flexible chordwise that the section could be altered in flight. This was the approach taken by Adolphe Lachassagne; his AL 3 was the first French monoplane with such a wing.|$|R
50|$|Conventional {{wing flaps}} {{are used to}} improve low speed flying {{characteristics}} and reduce landing and <b>take-off</b> <b>speeds.</b> The flaps are hydraulically operated. Interconnecting cables synchronize the flaps throughout their range of travel and a limit switch located on the left flap sector prevents over-travel. An audible waning horn warns of flap extension to more than 25 degrees if the landing gear is not down and locked.|$|R
50|$|The Guan was a single-bay biplane with wooden, fabric-covered {{wings of}} unequal span and marked stagger. All Folland's Gloster fighters from the Grebe onwards {{had used a}} thick upper wing in {{combination}} with a fairly thin lower wing and the Guan followed this pattern, chosen to provide low drag at high speed with good lift at low, <b>take-off</b> <b>speeds.</b> It had parallel interplane struts and ailerons on all wings.|$|R
2500|$|The X-114 {{began its}} trials with the German Ministry of Defence in April 1977. [...] At some stage it was fitted with {{downward}} angled hydrofoils mounted to its floats {{with the aim}} of decreasing <b>take-off</b> <b>speed,</b> but they proved to have the opposite effect by decreasing the ram air pressure. [...] They also called for care on landing, pulling the craft rapidly into the water if their angle of attack was negative. Despite completing its test programme satisfactorily, no production order was received and the sole prototype was the only X-114 built. [...] It was finally lost in an accident. [...] Though Lippisch died just before the X-114 test programme began, his concept was further developed in the Airfish series of ground effect vehicles, which continued in operation until at least 2012.|$|E
2500|$|The {{basis of}} the German authorities' case relied on the icy {{condition}} of the wings hours after the crash and {{a photograph of the}} aircraft (published in several newspapers) taken shortly before take-off, that appeared to show snow on the upper wing surfaces. When the original negative was examined, however, no snow or ice could be seen, the [...] "snow" [...] in the original having been due to the sun reflecting off the wings, which was clarified when examining the negative rather than the published pictures which had been produced from a copy negative. The witnesses were not called to the German inquiry and proceedings against Thain dragged on until 1968, when he was finally cleared of any responsibility for the crash. As the official cause, British authorities recorded a build-up of melting snow on the runway which prevented the [...] "Elizabethan" [...] from reaching the required <b>take-off</b> <b>speed.</b> Thain, having been dismissed by BEA shortly after the accident and never re-engaged, retired and returned to run his poultry farm in Berkshire. He {{died of a heart attack}} at the age of 53 in August 1975.|$|E
50|$|Gate {{factor is}} a scoring {{compensation}} for variable outdoor conditions. Aerodynamics and <b>take-off</b> <b>speed</b> are important variables that determine {{the value of}} a jump, and if weather conditions change during a competition, the conditions will not be the same for all competitors. The competitor receive or lose points if the inrun (or start gate) length is adjusted to provide optimal <b>take-off</b> <b>speed.</b> Points are added when the starting gate is moved up, and withdrawn when the gate is lowered.|$|E
5000|$|The T 23 first flew on 14 September 1923 as a biplane. After a {{few months}} testing, it was {{converted}} to the monoplane configuration. Compared with the biplane, the T 23E had the expected higher landing and <b>take-off</b> <b>speeds,</b> together with longer take-off distances, associated with the higher wing loading. [...] It was faster by 15 km/h and could carry a payload about 9% greater. All four T 24s built were sold to flying clubs after the experiments were over.|$|R

The slotted flag had a large effect on locating the forward center-of-gravity limits for stable take-offs. Stable take-offs within the normal operating range of positions {{of the center of}} gravity could be made with the split flaps deflected 45 deg or with the slotted flaps deflected less than 20 deg. At flap deflections required for similar take-off stability, the use of split-flaps resulted lower <b>take-off</b> <b>speeds</b> than the use of slotted flaps.

50|$|The Z-25 Šohaj was {{designed}} to be a replacement for the pre-war, German Meise. The latter, designed for the glider competitions of the 1940 Olympics that were abandoned because of hostilities, was widely used in post-war Czechoslovakia. The two types had similar appearances and much in common but the Šohaj significantly improved on the older aircraft by using 5-digit series NACA airfoils rather than the old Göttingen 549; the NACA sections provide more lift at low speeds, improving flight in thermals and lower landing and <b>take-off</b> <b>speeds.</b> They also had a lower pitching moment and hence lower tail loads, allowing the structure to be lightened. The Šohaj's wings were mounted around shoulder height on the ovoid cross section fuselage, enabling a smoother aerodynamic junction than on the Meise, which had a high wing on an almond shaped fuselage.|$|R
40|$|A {{preliminary}} experimental {{investigation is}} being {{conducted to determine}} the feasibility of preventing rain from impinging on aircraft windshields by means of high-velocity jet-air blast. The results indicate that rain deflection by jet blast appears feasible for flight speeds comparable with landing and <b>take-off</b> <b>speeds</b> of interceptor-type jet aircraft; however, attainment of good visibility through the mist generated by raindrop breakup presents a problem. For the simulated windshield and the lower windshield angles used in the investigation, air-flow rates {{of the order of}} 3. 3 pounds per minute of unheated air per inch of windshield span were required for adequate rain deflection at a free-stream velocity of 135 miles per hour.

40|$|Recent {{programs}} {{in the field of}} jet noise, sponsored by the NASA Lewis Research Center, have indicated that the variable stream control engines (VSCE) which are being considered for advanced supersonic cruise aircraft have inherent jet noise advantages over earlier engines. This characteristic is associated with the exit velocity profile produced by such an engine. The high velocity fan stream, on the outer periphery, is acoustically dominant while the primary stream is held to a low velocity and therefore contributes little to the overall noise. Scale model tests have indicated low noise levels. Operation under static conditions, as well as in a relative velocity field (simulating <b>take-off</b> <b>speeds)</b> has indicated large reductions are available from the coannular nozzle and the VSCE. The inherently low levels of jet noise prompted changes in the cycle, which allowed an increase in the amount of augmentation incorporated in the fan stream, without exceeding the suggested noise guidelines, thereby allowing the use of a considerably smaller engine, with obvious vehicle advantages...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} meet the goals of {{reducing}} noise, emissions, and fuel burn, the Hybrid Wing Body (HWB) will require revolutionary improvements in aerodynamics, acoustics, and structural design. Reducing or eliminating the traditional “tube ” design fuselage offers a significant improvement in aerodynamic efficiency. The use of embedded engines offers the possibility of reducing radiated noise to the community {{while at the same time}} alleviating separation of the airflow over the wing. Reducing or eliminating empennage surfaces offers the possibility to reduce skin friction, form and trim drag during cruise while reducing structural weight. Essentially, the HWB offers the potential for significant improvements by using a multi-disciplinary, highly integrated approach to aircraft design. For In designing HWB concepts that includes Cruise Efficient Short Take-Off and Landing (CESTOL) characteristics, some performance issues have been identified.

The aerodynamics, wing loading, and thrust-to-weight ratio of the subject SST resulted in takeoff speeds limited by climb (rather than lift-off) considerations. <b>Take-off</b> <b>speeds</b> based on U.
