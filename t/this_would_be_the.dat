5|$|Gerardo Mazzetta {{and colleagues}} (1998) {{propose that the}} horns might also {{have been used to}} injure or kill small prey. Though horn cores are blunt, they may have had a similar form to modern bovid horns if there was a keratinous covering. However, <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> only {{reported}} example of horns being used as hunting weapons in animals.|$|E
5|$|Göring also placed {{emphasis}} on correct rendezvous with the bombers, {{which had been}} lacking in recent operations (see Adlertag). The longer-range bombers were ordered directly to fighter airfields {{to pick up their}} escorts {{on the way to the}} target. He determined that as many fighters as possible should remain on sweeps while a smaller number maintained close contact with the bombers. For now, <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> main tactical arrangement of fighter-bomber cooperation.|$|E
5|$|However, {{this was}} another {{temporary}} home. The club stayed here until 1905, when they moved into Windsor Park. The club's first silverware at Windsor arrived in the 1906–07 season, with the club lifting both the league title and the County Antrim Shield. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first of a trio of league titles, with the 1907–08 and 1908–09 league titles to follow.|$|E

5|$|On 7 October 2013, Miliband {{reshuffle}}d his Shadow Cabinet for {{the third}} time, saying that <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last reshuffle before the general election. In a move similar to his 2011 reshuffle, several MPs from the 2010 intake were promoted, while more long-serving MPs were moved. Tristram Hunt and Rachel Reeves received promotions, while Liam Byrne and Stephen Twigg were among those demoted.|$|E
5|$|On February 4, 2013, Marc Webb {{posted on}} Twitter that {{principal}} photography had begun {{and that the}} sequel was being shot on 35 mm film in the anamorphic format, instead of being filmed digitally as the preceding film was. Sony revealed <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first Spider-Man film to be filmed entirely in New York State, including a car-chase scene that was filmed in Rochester because the speed laws are less restrictive in upstate New York.|$|E
5|$|The Best of Sanctus Real was {{released}} on October 9, 2015 via the Capitol Christian record label. It includes a selection of fourteen songs spanning the band's previous seven albums and one new song written specifically for the release.

5|$|The {{documentary}} Crossfire Hurricane, {{directed by}} Brett Morgen, {{was released in}} October 2012. He conducted approximately fifty hours of interviews for the documentary, including extensive interviews with Wyman and Taylor. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> first official career-spanning documentary since 1989's , which was filmed for their 25th anniversary in 1988.|$|E

5|$|A {{few years}} after {{studying}} experimental animation at the California Institute of the Arts, Hillenburg met Joe Murray, creator of the Nickelodeon series Rocko's Modern Life, at an animation festival, and was offered {{a job as a}} director of the show. Martin Olson, one of the writers for Rocko's Modern Life, read The Intertidal Zone and encouraged Hillenburg to create a television series with a similar concept. At that point, Hillenburg had not even considered creating his own series. However, he realized that if he ever did, <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> best approach. Production on Rocko's Modern Life ended in 1996. Shortly afterwards, Hillenburg began working on SpongeBob SquarePants.|$|E
5|$|A second tournament, the Cromwell Cup {{was played}} a year later. This {{time it was}} only open to teams under two years old. Out of the four teams that competed The Wednesday emerged victorious. The final was a goalless draw after 90minutes so the teams played on until a goal was scored. This was the first {{instance}} where a match involved extra time. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last tournament to be played in Sheffield for nine years until {{the formation of the}} Sheffield Football Association Challenge Cup in 1876.|$|E
5|$|After an {{exhibition}} rout of US Armed Forces, the Lady Vols {{opened up the}} season unusually, with a conference game against Mississippi. Semeka Randall did not start the game. However, four minutes into the game, the Lady Vols were only up 4–2. At this point, Randall was put into the game, and Tennessee scored fifteen straight, on a run fueled by her. Randall scored 24, and star Chamique Holdsclaw added 23. This season opener has {{caused a lot of}} anticipation, as it was expected that <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> game where all four of Tennessee's freshman played together. However, during a November practice, Clement had injured her foot, resulting in a stress fracture. After a discussion with the team doctor, Clement agreed to sit out the Mississippi game {{in order to be able}} to play the next game, against Louisiana Tech.|$|E

5|$|After two sabbaticals to Harvard, Baker's {{interest}} {{moved from}} photometry to the Milky Way. In 1939 the 30-inch reflector {{was replaced with}} a Ross photographic telescope and {{for more than ten}} years after that, 1939 through 1951 Baker used the observatory's photographic telescope to help count the stars in the Milky Way and determine their distribution as part of Harvard's Star Counting Circuit. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> primary research until Baker's retirement in 1951. The 12-inch refractor was only used for instruction, public open houses and for visiting school groups.|$|E
5|$|An {{exception}} {{to all of}} <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Primal Zerg, who inhabit the original Zerg homeworld of Zerus (as seen in Heart of the Swarm). The Zerg Hive Mind was created to control the Zerg, and eventually put them {{under the control of}} the main antagonist of the series, the fallen Xel'Naga Amon. Some Zerg, however, managed to avoid being subsumed. These are the Primal Zerg, who have much the same genetic abilities but are not bound to the Overmind. These creatures are each independently sapient, and if they follow a leader it is because they choose to. Their lack of a Hive Mind also shields them from specific psionic attacks engineered to counter the Zerg Hive Mind.|$|E
5|$|As a result, the {{referendum}} on 29 April was categorically rejected with 802,512 votes (42.4%) for abolition and 1,089,193 votes (57.5%) against. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last attempt {{to abolish the}} council and, as {{the first time the}} NSW Labor party had lost a state poll in many years, was widely seen as {{the beginning of the end}} for the Labor government, which had been in power since 1941. Heffron's supporter Dougherty resigned from the council a month later in protest of the result.|$|E

5|$|Because {{of the low}} wage at América Mineiro, he {{was forced}} to quit {{football}} to take various jobs as a labourer, a carpenter, and a worker in a sweet factory. It looked as if <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> end of his childhood dream. As a factory-worker Gilberto earned the equivalent of about £50 a month by 2002 rates. After three years of working in a factory, the 18-year-old decided to try his luck at football again by enrolling in the local club's youth academy. His time in the academy did not last long due to the worsening situation at home {{as a result of his}} mother's ill health; he returned to work in the sweet factory with little hope of resurrecting his football career.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{second year}} as coach {{was the best}} in Stanford rugby history: the team was undefeated {{entering}} the Big Game at California, who was also undefeated. A record crowd of 26,000 turned out to see Stanford defeat the Bears, 26–8. <b>This</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last Big Game for several years as California returned to football for the 1915 season. Despite Stanford's success in rugby, the previous year's humiliating defeats to the All Blacks and the switch by rivals USC and California to football intensified the sentiment for Stanford to switch back as well.|$|E
5|$|By {{the fall}} of his junior season, the Illinois class of 2014 was being {{mentioned}} {{as one of the}} all-time great statewide classes of basketball players. Chicago Sun-Times writer Joe Henricksen noted that there was a high chance that <b>this</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> fifth Illinois class and first since 2002 to include three McDonald's All-Americans. He also noted that the class has a chance to rival if not surpass the classes of 1998 and 2011 which each had nine top 100 players.|$|E
