The change of its distribution was obtained using the sequential one-, two-, and three-frequency heating. The {{study was conducted}} as a multi-variant computer simulation of hard coupled electromagnetic and temperature fields. For the analysis, a professional calculation software package utilizing the finite element method, Flux 3 D, was used. The problem of obtaining an appropriate temperature distribution in the heated charge of a complex shape {{is very important in}} many practical applications. A typical example is hardening of gear wheels. For such an application, it is necessary to obtain (on the surface and at a desired depth) an uniform temperature distribution on the <b>tooth</b> face, <b>top</b> <b>land</b> and bottom land of the gear.

40|$|The {{formation}} of carbonaceous engine deposits {{is a long}} standing and well documented phenomenon limiting the lifetime of diesel engines. Carbon remnants coat the surfaces of the combustion chamber, piston, and valves. As piston deposits thicken, they {{increase the risk of}} a power cylinder seizure. More restrictive emission standards require careful power cylinder design to control piston deposits, specifically in the <b>top</b> <b>land</b> and <b>top</b> ring groove. Experimental studies on heavy duty diesel engines show a non-uniform pattern of carbon deposits on the <b>top</b> <b>land.</b> The degradation of engine lubricant is typically understood to be source of deposits. A theoretical study was begun to understand the effects of harsh operating environment that leads to degradation. A thin-film, transient, mass and heat transfer simulation of the <b>top</b> <b>land</b> was formulated, which utilizes the results of a combustion chamber CFD simulation as input data. by Thomas Patrick Grimley.

In {{order to}} reduce the surface {{roughness}} and improve the manufacturing precision of the outer rotor surface of the cycloidal pump, the method that outer rotor tooth surface on the abrasive flow machining (AFM) is adopted. First of all, a power-law model to describe the form of abrasive flow was created, simulation analysis on AFM for the external rotor tooth surface, and the distribution of shear stress that the boundary layer abrasive subjected near the various parts of the outer rotor tooth surface can be draw. Then, choose abrasives with different particle size for processing. Experimental results demonstrate that <b>tooth</b> <b>top,</b> <b>tooth</b> surface and tooth root surface roughness Ra of the outer rotor from the 2. 48 um 2. 192 um and 2. 107 um down to processed 0. 054 um, 0. 094 um and 0. 185 um, material removal is 0. 4 g.
