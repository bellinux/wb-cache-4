5|$|Lysosomes are organelles {{that contain}} hydrolytic enzymes {{that are used}} for {{intracellular}} digestion. The main functions of a lysosome are to process molecules <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> <b>by</b> the cell and to recycle worn out cell parts. The enzymes inside of lysosomes are acid hydrolases which require an acidic environment for optimal performance. Lysosomes provide such an environment by maintaining a pH of 5.0 inside of the organelle. If a lysosome were to rupture, the enzymes released would not be very active because of the cytosol's neutral pH. However, if numerous lysosomes leaked the cell could be destroyed from autodigestion.|$|E
