The study consisted of 850 internet users; the data was obtained by carrying out a questionnaire amongst the participants. This study found that browsing websites related to suicide, and methods used to commit suicide, had {{a negative effect on}} suicidal thoughts and increased depression and anxiety tendencies. The study concluded that as suicide-related internet use adversely affected the mental health of certain age groups it may be prudent to reduce or control their exposure to these websites. These findings certainly suggest that the internet can indeed have a profoundly negative impact on our mental health.|$|E

Based on a survey of local governments in Chester and Montgomery counties in Pennsylvania and two local government case <b>studies,</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>investigates</b> the role and importance of an organizational “champion ” of the technology.
