5|$|Supporters of the book's basic {{accuracy}} countered on {{the points}} raised by skeptics such as footbinding and the Great Wall of China. Historian Stephen G. Haw {{argued that the}} Great Walls were built to keep out northern invaders, whereas the ruling dynasty during Marco Polo's visit were those very northern invaders. They note that the Great Wall familiar <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>today</b> is a Ming structure built some two centuries after Marco Polo's travels; and that the Mongol rulers whom Polo served controlled territories both {{north and south of}} today's wall, and would have no reasons to maintain any fortifications that may have remained there from the earlier dynasties. Other Europeans who travelled to Khanbaliq during the Yuan Dynasty, such as Giovanni de' Marignolli and Odoric of Pordenone, said nothing about the wall either. The Muslim traveler Ibn Batutta, who asked about the wall when he visited China during the Yuan Dynasty, could find no one who had either seen it or knew of anyone who had seen it, suggesting that while ruins of the wall constructed in the earlier periods might have existed, they were not significant or noteworthy at that time.|$|E

Some of the fragments are extensive enough to allow tentative reconstructions to be proposed.|$|E
25|$|A Turing {{machine is}} a {{mathematical}} model of a general computing machine. It is a theoretical device that manipulates symbols contained on a strip of tape. Turing machines are not intended as a practical computing technology, {{but rather as a}} thought experiment representing a computing machine—anything from an advanced supercomputer to a mathematician with a pencil and paper. It is believed that if a problem can be solved by an algorithm, there exists a Turing machine that solves the problem. Indeed, this is the statement of the Church–Turing thesis. Furthermore, it is known that everything that can be computed on other models of computation known <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>today,</b> such as a RAM machine, Conway's Game of Life, cellular automata or any programming language can be computed on a Turing machine. Since Turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically, and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation, the Turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory.|$|E

[...] While president of the DOB in New York, attending members numbered between ten and forty per meeting.

Gittings recalled, [...] "At first we were so grateful just to have people— anybody— pay attention {{to us that we}} listened to and accepted everything they said, no matter how bad it was...anything that helped to break the silence, no matter how silly or foolish it may look <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>today,</b> was important." ...|$|E

2500|$|Medieval Christian {{cosmology}} shows {{its influence}} {{especially in the}} account of the creation of the universe as the manifestation of a sort of song sung by God with which the angels harmonize until the fallen angel introduces discord.

2500|$|In his 1940 article [...] "Dickens: Two Scrooges", Edmund Wilson states, [...] "Our Mutual Friend, {{like all}} these later books of Dickens, is more {{interesting}} <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>today</b> {{than it was}} to Dickens's public. Certainly the subtleties and profundities that are now discovered in it were not noticed by the reviewers." [...] As a whole, modern critics of Our Mutual Friend, particularly those of the last half century, have been more appreciative of Dickens's last completed work than his contemporary reviewers. Although some modern critics find Dickens's characterisation in Our Mutual Friend problematic, most tend to positively acknowledge the novel's complexity and appreciate its multiple plot lines.|$|E

2500|$|In its {{distinctive}} Tibetan form, the epic appears to {{date from the}} time of the second transmission of Buddhism to Tibet marked by the formation of the Sarma or [...] "new schools" [...] of Tibetan Buddhism, although the story includes early elements taken from Indian tantricism. The oral tradition of this epic is most prominent in the two remote areas associated with the pre-Buddhist ethnic religion known as Bon (Ladakh and Zanskar in the far west of Tibet and Kham and Amdo in the east), strongly suggesting that the story has native roots.

We have gone from Kitty Hawk to the moon in some seventy years, but it's possible that a million-year-old civilization may know something that we don't ...

2500|$|There is no {{contemporary}} parallel for {{the role}} of Fool in the court of kings. As Shakespeare conceives it, the Fool is a servant and subject to punishment ('Take heed, sirrah [...] the whip ' 1:4:104) and yet Lear's relationship with his fool is one of friendship and dependency. The Fool acts as a commentator on events {{and is one of the}} characters (Kent being the other) who is fearless in speaking the truth. The Fool provides wit in this bleak play and unlike some of Shakespeare's clowns who seem unfunny <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>today</b> because their topical jokes no longer make sense, the Fool in King Lear ridicules Lear's actions and situation in such a way that audiences understand the point of his jokes. His 'mental eye' is the most acute in the beginning of the play: he sees Lear's daughters for what they are and has the foresight to see that Lear's decision will prove disastrous.|$|E
2500|$|Ferris {{explains}} {{in the beginning}} of his book the cosmological model as it has arrived <b>to</b> <b>us</b> <b>today</b> from ancient philosophy.

Ferris writes for the reader to understand that [...] "space" [...] was created in the Big Bang and did not preexist.
