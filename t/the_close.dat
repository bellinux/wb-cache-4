40|$|<b>The</b> <b>closed</b> rule {{constitutes}} {{a critical component}} of managerial power in the contemporary House of Representatives and an increasingly important element of the legislative process. Subject to the approval of the full membership, <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> rule allows managers to block all amendments to a measure when bringing that measure to the floor. Despite objections from the minority, both Republicans and Democrats regularly use <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> rule when in the majority, and rank-and-file members ordinarily approve any closed rule put to a floor vote. Once rarely used, <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> rule has become managers’ preferred instrument for controlling the House floor agenda. This article presents the first comprehensive analysis of <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> rule in <b>the</b> legal literature. After situating <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> rule within its institutional and theoretical context, this article examines the use of <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> rule by <b>the</b> Republican majority in the 109 th Congress and the Democratic majority in the 110 th Congress. The article then undertakes both a positive and normative analysis. The positive analysis generalizes three prominent accounts of <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> rule from political theory and argues that <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> rule can more accurately be understood as a broadly managerial instrument for maintaining order on the House floor. The normative analysis identifies and discusses several undesirable effects of <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> rule [...] its tendency to increase legislative fragmentation and redundancy, its facilitation of third-party capture, and its weakening of bipartisan cooperation and compromise. But the normative analysis rejects claims that <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> rule is inherently undemocratic, arguing instead that <b>the</b> <b>closed</b> rule represents a deliberate, rational, and legitimate attempt by the rank and file to locate the House at the optimal point between too much managerial power and outright chaos on the floor...|$|R
