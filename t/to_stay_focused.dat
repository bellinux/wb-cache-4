5|$|When he auditioned, Hertzberg had no {{idea what}} Adam would look like in full costume and make-up. Buffy used a company named Optic Nerve to build the {{materials}} to make Hertzberg look like a demonoid. Almost immediately after Hertzberg got the part, Optic Nerve sketched and sculpted Adam's appearance. They had Hertzberg come in to have molds made for prosthetic parts to fit his head and face, arms, chest, and legs, then he was fitted for contact lenses. They also created separate hands and a chest to film for close-up shots. Adam has a floppy disk drive mounted on his chest which, when used, had to be filmed without Hertzberg behind it. The entire construction of Adam's appearance took about two weeks. Hertzberg's voice was also modified post-production. When he saw the full Adam prosthetic and costume, his biggest concern was being able to show nuanced facial expressions under so much latex. It took hours to get Hertzberg into his full costume, but even after it was fully applied on set, often he would have to wait even longer before he went in front of the cameras. He spoke of the need <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>focused</b> during all the waiting while sweating underneath everything he wore for the part.|$|E

30|$|A major barrier <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> <b>focused</b> {{in class}} was {{the length of}} the lecture as well as the time of day in which the lecture took place. Our {{analysis}} revealed that 9 / 14 participants highlighted the importance of having a break during lectures in order to balance and sustain a desirable level of attention during lectures. They reported that Kahoot! facilitated breaks in positive ways. Ten of the 14 respondents described <b>staying</b> <b>focused</b> in a 2 -h lecture as challenging, with some describing the experience as tedious or boring. Taking a break to engage in a fun activity allowed students to feel refreshed, providing timely relief at the halfway mark of the lecture and re-energising students for the second hour. In addition to facilitating breaks during lecture, the use of Kahoot! also created richer variation in lecture delivery, enabling a moment of fun while continuing to engage with lecture content, only in a more light hearted way.|$|R
