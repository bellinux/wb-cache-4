Following the convictions the US used threats and diplomatic pressure to stop the Italian Executive branch from issuing arrest warrants and extradition requests for the Americans.|$|E

25|$|Originally {{planned to}} hold 300,000 refugees, the {{population}} eventually reached 160,000 in March 1980. Later, as KID became the main holding center for refugees awaiting third country visas, illegal {{entry to the}} camp became highly sought after by refugees desperate to escape from Cambodia, and smuggling, theft and violence spiraled out of control. In July and August 1980 UNHCR began transferring large numbers of refugees out of KID to Phanat Nikhom, Sa Kaeo II, Mairut, and Kap Choeng. By December 1982 the population had dropped to 40,134 as refugees were forcibly repatriated, sent <b>to</b> <b>third</b> <b>countries,</b> or {{sent back to the}} border camps.|$|E
25|$|Attempts by the UK Government {{to obtain}} a similar {{exemption}} were also stymied. The UK Government sought an exemption {{in the context of}} the JSF project. The Clinton administration promised the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defence that an ITAR waiver would be given, allowing greater technology transfer associated with the project. Yet, despite the backing of the Bush administration, the waiver was repeatedly blocked by the late U.S. Congressman Henry Hyde because of his security concerns about potential technology transfer <b>to</b> <b>third</b> <b>countries.</b> With his departure, ITAR-related impacts regarding the F-35 / JSF program remain in flux. These difficulties caused the UK to threaten that it would abandon the JSF project and consider alternative aircraft.|$|E
25|$|However, after India {{tested a}} nuclear device in 1974, the U.S. slowed down and {{eventually}} halted nuclear cooperation with Brazil. Also, {{in the aftermath of}} the 1973 energy crisis, USAEC made its provision of fuel <b>to</b> <b>third</b> <b>countries</b> subject to availability. This in turn pushed Brazil to accelerate talks with West Germany and France, eventually signing an agreement with the former on 27 June 1975, that established the transfer of operational know-how regarding reactors. The deal represented the largest technology transfer agreement ever signed between an industrialized country and an industrializing one. Bonn committed to export four to eight reactors over a span of 15 years. Likewise, West German firms agreed to construct a complete nuclear fuel cycle in Brazil: uranium prospecting and mining; uranium enrichment (using the jet-nozzle process); manufacturing fuel rods; and reprocessing spent fuel rods. For West Germanyâ€™s nuclear industry, this was the most significant contract ever to be established, at an anticipated value of 10 billion marks (roughly US$4 billion). Also, this was the largest single export order in German history.|$|E
30|$|More {{specific}} than {{international law}} obligations are provisions created on a regional level by the European Union (EU). The coordination of all social security systems is {{regulated by the}} EU and specific regulations have created the right to social benefits portability within the EU. In 2003 these provisions were extended <b>to</b> <b>third</b> <b>country</b> nationals, creating the right to equal treatment with EU nationals (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, International Organization for Migration, and International Labour Office 2006 : 156). Thus by EU law all member countries are legally required to grant the same social benefits to nationals as <b>to</b> <b>third</b> <b>country</b> nationals.|$|R

2500|$|On October 19, 1979 Thai Prime Minister Kriangsak Chomanan enacted an [...] "open door" [...] {{policy which}} {{permitted}} Cambodian refugees {{to cross the}} border safely and to reside in specific locations.
