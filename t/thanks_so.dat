60|$|He sanctified us {{with his}} blood; but why should the Father have thanks for this? Even because the Father gave him for us, that he might die to sanctify {{us with his}} blood--'Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the {{inheritance}} of the saints in light; who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son; in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins' (Col 1:12-14). The Father is to be thanked, for the contrivance was also his; but the blood, the righteousness, or that worthiness, {{for the sake of}} which we are accepted of God, is the worthiness of his own dear Son. As it is meet, therefore, that God should have <b>thanks,</b> <b>so</b> it is necessary that he have it in his name for whose sake we indeed are accepted of him.|$|E
60|$|And yet {{he could}} not deny that a divine relief possessed him, and that the future, instead of wearing a lead-colored mask, now blossomed with a {{thousand}} varied gaieties and excitements. He was actually to see Cassandra within a week or perhaps less, and he was more anxious to know the date of her arrival than he could own even to himself. It seemed base to be so anxious to pluck this fruit of Katharine's unexampled generosity and of his own contemptible baseness. And yet, though he used these words automatically, they had now no meaning. He was not debased in his own eyes by what he had done, and as for praising Katharine, were they not partners, conspirators, people bent upon the same quest together, so that to praise {{the pursuit of a}} common end as an act of generosity was meaningless. He took her hand and pressed it, not in <b>thanks</b> <b>so</b> much as in an ecstasy of comradeship.|$|E
60|$|Clive's amusements, studies, or occupations, {{such as they}} were, {{filled his}} day pretty completely, and caused the young gentleman's time to pass rapidly and pleasantly, his father, it must be owned, had no such resources, and the good Colonel's idleness hung heavily upon him. He {{submitted}} very kindly to this infliction, however, {{as he would have}} done to any other for Clive's sake; and though he may have wished himself back with his regiment again, and engaged in the pursuits in which his life had been spent, he chose to consider these desires as very selfish and blameable on his part, and sacrificed them resolutely for his son's welfare. The young fellow, I dare say, gave his parent no more credit for his long self-denial, than many other children award to theirs. We take such life-offerings as our due commonly. The old French satirist avers that, in a love affair, there is usually one person who loves, and the other, qui se laisse aimer; it is only in later days, perhaps, when the treasures of love are spent, and the kind hand cold which ministered them, that we remember how tender it was; how soft to soothe; how eager to shield; how ready to support and caress. The ears may no longer hear, which would have received our words of <b>thanks</b> <b>so</b> delightedly. Let us hope those fruits of love, though tardy, are yet not all too late; and though we bring our tribute of reverence and gratitude, it may be to a gravestone, there is an acceptance even there for the stricken heart's oblation of fond remorse, contrite memories, and pious tears. I am thinking of the love of Clive Newcome's father for him (and, perhaps, young reader, that of yours and mine for ourselves); how the old man lay awake, and devised kindnesses, and gave his all for the love of his son; and the young man took, and spent, and slept, and made merry. Did we not say at our tale's commencement that all stories were old? Careless prodigals and anxious elders have been from the beginning:--and so may love, and repentance, and forgiveness endure even till the end.|$|E
