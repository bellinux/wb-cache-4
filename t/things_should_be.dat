5|$|Manuel Belgrano had a vast {{intellectual}} {{awareness of}} most important topics of his age. He studied in Europe during the Atlantic Revolutions, {{and was a}} versatile polyglot, capable of understanding Spanish, English, French, Italian, and some indigenous languages. This allowed him to read many influential books of the Age of Enlightenment, and understand the social, economic, technical, educative, political, cultural, and religious changes that were being prompted by the new ideas. He helped to promote those ideas using the press and with {{his work in the}} Consulate. He rejected localist perspectives, favouring a Latin Americanist one. He was driven by the concept of the common good, which he regarded as an ethical value. He considered public health, education, and work as part of the common good, as well as religion. He did not share completely the ideas of the French Revolution, but instead the tempered ones of the Spanish Enlightenment: most notably, he remained a monarchist and held strong religious beliefs, being Roman Catholic and a devotee of Marian theology. His monarchism was not a conservative one, as he agreed that the existing state of <b>things</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> modified, but not towards a republic as in France or the United States, but towards a constitutional monarchy, like in Britain.|$|E
25|$|They're both {{leaders and}} there's {{a lot of}} {{conflict}} between them. They are very supportive of one another when operating against a third party, but they also disagree with how <b>things</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> handled {{when it comes to}} crises. Medusa is monarchy; She-Hulk is democracy. Medusa is the right of queens and She-Hulk is the rule of law. She-Hulk is much more balanced than Medusa. It's the two of them playing off of their strengths and sometime playing off of each other for both necessary good and necessary evil.|$|E
25|$|Two <b>things</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> noted {{about the}} second {{complete}} draft of Das Rheingold. Firstly, the full score of the Prelude (in ink) and the instrumentation draft of {{the remainder of the}} opera (in pencil) together constitute a single manuscript (WWV 86A Musik III). In WWV this is called a Partiturerstschrift, a term usually reserved for Wagner's full scores: strictly speaking only the section in ink is a Partiturerstschrift. Secondly, the manuscript is fragmentary: thirty-three measures are missing, which include the closing measures of the Prelude and the opening measures of Scene 1. As ink is used before this lacuna and pencil after it, it is generally assumed that Wagner switched from one medium to the other at the entrance of the voices (i.e. the first measure of Scene 1); but until and unless the missing sheets are recovered, this must remain an assumption.|$|E

25|$|Balance {{sheets and}} Profit and Loss {{statements}} served one major purpose, {{if not the}} only one, for Ivar and that was {{they had to be}} helpful in his fund raising efforts. Often they were just pure fantasy to be revised at will to please investors. He also frequently treated the assets of corporations he controlled as if they were his own. However, <b>things</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> seen {{in the context of the}} time. IBM, for example, consolidated all its accounts in one named Plant, Property, Equipment, Machines, Patents and Goodwill. American Can doubled its reported net earnings in 1913 by claiming only $1 million of depreciation after having claimed $2.5 million the previous year. Many companies set up arbitrary reserves in good times to be used in bad years and few holding companies published consolidated financial statements.|$|E

500|$|Priber {{attempted}} to organize Cherokee society {{in accordance with}} early 18th-century European idealism. [...] He promoted the idea that all <b>things</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> held in common, including wives and children. Claiming the English were fraudulent and greedy, he suggested moving the Cherokee capital to modern-day Alabama, {{where it would be}} closer to the French colonial territory of La Louisiane. [...] The English tried to arrest Priber in 1739, but were prevented by the Cherokee. He was finally captured by the Creek people in 1743 and turned over to South Carolina authorities.|$|E
500|$|In 1798, Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge jointly {{published}} Lyrical Ballads, with a Few Other Poems, {{a collection}} of verses each had written separately. The book became hugely popular and was published widely; it is generally considered a herald of the Romantic movement in English literature. In it, Wordsworth aimed to use everyday language in his compositions {{as set out in}} the preface to the 1802 edition: [...] "The principal object, then, proposed in these Poems was to choose incidents and situations from common life, and to relate or describe them, throughout, as far as was possible in a selection of language really used by men, and at the same time, to throw over them a certain colouring of imagination, whereby ordinary <b>things</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> presented to the mind in an unusual aspect." ...|$|E
500|$|For the Daenerys {{scene at}} the {{beginning}} of the episode where the three dragons burn part of the Masters' fleet, Sapochnik credited VFX supervisor Joe Bauer and producer Steve Kullback for post-production work: [...] "For this sequence David and Dan said that what they wanted to see was a 'demonstration' of what's to come. So I tried to approach it in the most elegant, epic, big-movie way I could." [...] The director tried to design the shots with relative realism, inspired by footage of World War II Supermarine Spitfires in action. He based the dragon shots on wildlife footage, allowing them to break the frame: [...] "These <b>things</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> so big and fast it's hard to keep up with them." [...] To insert Emilia Clarke (as Daenerys Targaryen) into the scene, she rode a [...] "multi-directional, computer-controlled hydraulic gimbal device shaped like the upper shoulders of the dragon"; Clarke was filmed separately in Belfast, Northern Ireland.|$|E
6000|$|Then, too, in old Jolyon's mind {{there was}} always the secret ache, that the son of James--of James, whom he had always thought such a poor <b>thing,</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> {{pursuing}} the paths of success, while his own son...! ...|$|R

500|$|Nagle {{credited}} {{herself with}} [...] "dragging the Jockey Club {{into the twentieth}} century". She said: [...] "This {{was a matter of}} principle. I am a feminist. I believe in equal rights for women. <b>Things</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> decided by ability, not sex". [...] At odds with Nagle's view, in her court case Lord Justice Salmon commented that [...] "No doubt there are occupations, such as boxing, which may be reasonably regarded inherently unsuitable for women", and Lord Denning had gone on to say that [...] "It is not as if the training of horses could be regarded as an unsuitable occupation for a woman, like that of a jockey or speedway-rider"; it was another eight years before Jockey Club rules permitted women jockeys in 1972. When asked by a journalist in the late 1970s if she thought women could ever match men on the racecourse, Nagle replied: [...] "My dear man, it used to be said women couldn't stand up to three-day-eventing. Now they're beating the men regularly– and the same will happen in racing. Give them time." [...] Her endeavours led to her being described as [...] "the Mrs Pankhurst of British horse racing" [...] in Stud & Stable Magazine and [...] "Racing's Emily Pankhurst".|$|E
500|$|Plato {{was called}} by {{biologist}} Ernst Mayr [...] "the great antihero of evolutionism," [...] because he promoted belief in essentialism, which is {{also referred to as}} the theory of Forms. This theory holds that each natural type of object in the observed world is an imperfect manifestation of the ideal, form or [...] "species" [...] which defines that type. In his Timaeus for example, Plato has a character tell a story that the Demiurge created the cosmos and everything in it because, being good, and hence, [...] "...free from jealousy, He desired that all <b>things</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> as like Himself as they could be." [...] The creator created all conceivable forms of life, since [...] "...without them the universe will be incomplete, for it will not contain every kind of animal which it ought to contain, {{if it is to be}} perfect." [...] This [...] "principle of plenitude"—the idea that all potential forms of life are essential to a perfect creation—greatly influenced Christian thought. However some historians of science have questioned how much influence Plato's essentialism had on natural philosophy by stating that many philosophers after Plato believed that species might be capable of transformation and that the idea that biologic species were fixed and possessed unchangeable essential characteristics did not become important until the beginning of biological taxonomy in the 17th and 18th centuries.|$|E
2500|$|More {{prominently}} addressed than in {{any previous}} government report [...] were environmental concerns. Wen said {{that the government will}} enforce strict environmental standards dictating new construction projects in the coming year. He reinforced the government's position on the protection of land, specifically pointing out that [...] "mansions, golf courses, and lavish government buildings" [...] are not appropriate uses for agricultural land, and cautioned local government and contractors that such <b>things</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> avoided.|$|E

2500|$|Mr. Michael Stewart, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, in a {{reply to}} a {{question}} in Parliament, 9 December 1969: [...] "As I have explained before, there is reference, in the vital United Nations Security Council Resolution, both to withdrawal from territories and to secure and recognized boundaries. As I have told the House previously, we believe that these two <b>things</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> read concurrently and that the omission of the word 'all' before the word 'territories' is deliberate." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early 1901, the Canadian Pacific Railway {{took over}} the Canadian Pacific Navigation Company and its fleet of steamships, {{including}} Rithet. [...] The name of the C.P.N. continued for a time, as there was not an immediate dissolution of the company's structure. [...] The new superintendent was Capt. James W. Troup, a friend of Captain Irving, but who nevertheless had his own ideas of how <b>things</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> run. Among other things, Troup wanted to replace the motley C.P.N. collection of wooden coasting vessels, some very old, with some newer vessels, preferably built of steel.|$|E
2500|$|During her husband's 1992 presidential campaign, Barbara Bush {{stated that}} {{abortion}} and homosexuality are personal matters {{and argued that}} the Republican Party platform should not {{take a stand on}} it, saying that [...] "The personal <b>things</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> left out of, in my opinion, platforms and conventions." [...] Her personal views on abortion were not known, although her friends reported at that time that she [...] "privately supported abortion rights." [...] She explained, [...] "I hate abortions, but I just could not make that choice for someone else." ...|$|E

2500|$|Amulo’s Epistula ad Teodboldum {{was written}} {{during a time}} of civil war, in which the diocese of Dijon was sensitively positioned. [...] Louis the German and Charles the Bald had engaged in combat within the area, and the {{subsequent}} devastation profoundly affected the diocese. [...] Amulo was deeply concerned about the effects that the relics had on families: most of the fits occurred in women and young girls, keeping them from their duties and generating more anxiety within the parish. [...] Amulo was not against relics, but he asserted the importance of in venerating saints in “proper” ways, and that such <b>things</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> limited to the “legitimate days". [...] He offered a solution to these new relics, insisting that church ceremony – mass, confessions, burials – would restore the people through “everyday miracles of everyday life".|$|E
2500|$|Insight 3 – No {{matter how}} well they have gained {{insights}} 1 and 2, insight alone rarely enables people to undo their emotional disturbances. They may feel better when they know, or think they know, how they became disturbed, because insights can feel useful and curative. But {{it is unlikely that}} people will actually get better and stay better unless they have and apply insight 3, which is that there is usually no way to get better and stay better except by continual work and practice in looking for and finding one’s core irrational beliefs; actively, energetically, and scientifically disputing them; replacing one’s absolute [...] "musts" [...] (rigid requirements about how <b>things</b> <b>should</b> <b>be)</b> with more flexible preferences; changing one's unhealthy feelings to healthy, self-helping emotions; and firmly acting against one’s dysfunctional fears and compulsions.
