A week later, James Prior replaced Humphrey Atkins as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and met with prisoners {{in an attempt to}} end the strike. Liam McCloskey ended his strike on 26 September after his family said <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> for medical intervention if he became unconscious, and {{it became clear that the}} families of the remaining hunger strikers would also intervene to save their lives.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} 20 years, Berg {{had no real}} job, living off friends and {{relatives}} who put up with {{him because of his}} charisma. When <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> what he did for a living, he would reply by putting his finger to his lips, giving them the impression that he was still a spy. A lifelong bachelor, he lived with his brother Samuel for 17 years. According to Samuel, he became moody and snappish after the war and did not seem to care for much in life besides his books. His brother finally grew fed up with the arrangement and asked Moe to leave and even had eviction papers drawn up. After being evicted from his brother's home, Berg moved in with his sister Ethel in Belleville, New Jersey, where he remained {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E

5|$|On June 20, 2014, Deadline {{announced}} {{the cast of}} the eight lead characters, along with Freema Agyeman, Naveen Andrews, Daryl Hannah, Alfonso Herrera and Eréndira Ibarra. For the roles of those characters living outside of America, the filmmakers wanted to assemble a cast of international actors that matched the nationality of their respective characters, if possible. For example, Doona Bae, Tina Desai, and Max Riemelt are from Seoul, Mumbai, and Berlin like their respective characters. Because the eight leads share the same birthday, the actors selected were all somewhere between mid-20s and mid-30s. The filmmakers {{wanted to write a}} Chinese, Japanese or Korean character and since the Wachowskis had worked with Bae on Cloud Atlas and Jupiter Ascending before, they decided on creating a Korean character for her. Bae expressed worry to them on signing on Sense8 because the proposed five-season plan could mean she would {{have to be able to}} film action scenes for the next 10 years, which would be difficult if she ever decided to get married and got pregnant. She joined the cast after the showrunners told her not to worry as they would kill off her character for her if that ever happened. Jamie Clayton is a trans woman like the character she plays. She was attracted to Sense8 because of the opportunity to play a transgender character that was written and directed by a transgender filmmaker, and because she was a fan of science fiction and Straczynski. Tuppence Middleton knew the Wachowskis were writing Sense8 while working with them on Jupiter Ascending but she did not think <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> her to play a role. Max Riemelt was cast at the recommendation of director Tom Tykwer, who had been wanting to work with the actor for a long time. Daryl Hannah was brought in to read for Whispers, because they were thinking of making him an androgynous character at the time, but when she arrived she was told they'd like her to read for the role of Angelica. In November, Deadline wrote than Christian Oliver had joined the cast as a recurring villain. Oliver said he was excited to play a villain for the Wachowskis for a second time, after Speed Racer. Joe Pantoliano, who previously played in the Wachowskis' Bound and The Matrix, was cast in a small uncredited role as Will's father.|$|E

25|$|When Israeli {{authorities}} {{failed to}} negotiate a political solution, they decided that their only option was an attack to rescue the hostages. Lt. Col. Joshua Shani, lead pilot of the operation, later said that the Israelis had initially conceived of a rescue plan that involved dropping naval commandos into Lake Victoria. The commandos would have ridden rubber boats to the airport located {{on the edge of}} the lake. They planned to kill the hijackers and after freeing the hostages, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> Amin for passage home. The Israelis abandoned this plan because they lacked the necessary time and they also received word that Lake Victoria was infested with crocodiles.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Easterners Yu Seongryong, Yi Sanhae, and Yi Seongjung and the Westerner Jeong Cheol promised {{each other}} that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> Seonjo to make Gwanghae Crown Prince together. However, Yi Sanhae did not appear at the promised date (he claimed he was ill). Yu Seongryong was too {{cautious}} to bring the subject up, and Jeong Cheol {{was the first to}} advise Seonjo to make Gwanghae Crown Prince. When Jeong Cheol brought the matter up, Seonjo was infuriated, believing that the story told by Lady In was true. Seonjo exiled Jeong Cheol and fired Westerners such as the Yun Dusu brothers, recreating a solidly Easterner government.|$|E
25|$|The archetypical {{selection}} process {{for entry into}} a collegiate secret society began at Yale University by a process called tapping. On a publicly announced evening, Yale undergraduates would assemble informally in the College Yard. Current members of Yale's secret societies would walk {{through the crowd and}} literally tap a prospective member on the shoulder and then walk with him up to the tapped man's dorm room. There, in private, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> him to become a member of their secret society; the inductee had the choice of accepting or rejecting the offer of membership. During this process, it was publicly known who was being tapped for the coming year. Today, the {{selection process}} is not quite as formal, but is still public. Formal tapping days used to exist at Berkeley, and still exist in a much more formal setting at Missouri.|$|E

25|$|Ships {{were first}} {{constructed}} {{in a very}} basic {{manner in which they}} used reeds. These ships were in no way able to travel in the Red or Mediterranean Sea, and so their purpose was only to navigate through the Nile. Whenever ships were required to endure longer travels, Egypt often imported cedar wood from Byblos, with whom they had good trade relations. At the same time, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> other states that they traded with to supply them with a certain number of ships. This is exemplified in the Amarna letters where we find a request to the King of Cyprus to construct ships for the Egyptian navy. By the time of the Battle of the Sea Peoples, the Egyptians had become experts in constructing ships. Their ships had a single mast with a horizontal square sail on it. One bow was usually decorated with a human skull being crushed by a lion’s head. These ships often had two rudder oars, since built in rudders were not invented at the time. At the same time, they could have been as heavy as 70 or 80 tonnes with around 50 rowers.|$|E

[...] Kelly became more involved with the Singin' in the Rain script during its third draft, which was when its structure began to resemble the final version. Comparing Donen and Kelly's films as solo directors, Donen's were usually more critically acclaimed and financially successful than Kelly's films. Kelly's 1969 film Hello Dolly! is credited with effectively killing the Hollywood musical.|$|E

Emerson agreed with this assessment, dropping the knife outline and the word [...] "knives" [...] from his stamp, using just his name in a half-circle on the blade as a logo. This marking is known among collectors as the [...] "Half-Moon Logo" [...] and would appear again as a transitional mark between the Viper and Specwar lines of knives.|$|E

500|$|Thorson {{said that}} the game started to come {{together}} about six months into its development. He tested the game on close friends once every few weeks and <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>ask</b> him when they could play it again. Thorson brought the game to the 2013 Evolution Championship Series fighting games tournament, where he unexpectedly received more praise than criticism. The game mechanics were inspired by games from Thorson's youth. Upon reflection, {{he felt that the}} game had the item-catching mechanics of Super Smash Bros., the one-hit kills and tension of Bushido Blade, the playfulness of Goldeneye 007, the shooting mechanics of , and the positioning strategy of Team Fortress 2. He described his development process as tweaking Super Smash Bros. Melee to his tastes. The limited arrow design was intended to slow the gameplay and encourage player strategy. He considered adding online multiplayer, a popular request, but lacked the programming skills himself. The game's medieval scenery came from his contemporary interest in the Game of Thrones book series and his pairing of the arrow mechanic with [...] "stone-walled castles and lava-filled dungeons". The player-characters also have individual personalities and backstories that Thorson intended to elaborate in a [...] "lore" [...] section of an instruction manual.|$|E
