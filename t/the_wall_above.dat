5|$|Above is the Great Chamber, an {{impressive}} {{room with a}} barrel ceiling with geometrical plaster decoration featuring John Lyte's arms and those of his wife, Edith Horsey. This ceiling is a rare survival. <b>The</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> the bed displays the royal coat of arms and Tudor roses, signifying Lyte's loyalty to King Henry VIII (whose government Lyte represented in Somerset). The panelling is 17th century, as are the great four poster bed and the tapestries on the walls. Some of the original oak panelling of the room {{may have been used}} {{in the construction of the}} canopy of the bed.|$|E
25|$|This was {{disrupted}} by a further commission to Michelangelo to decorate <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> the altar with The Last Judgment, 1537–1541. The painting of this scene necessitated the obliteration of two episodes from the Lives, the Nativity of Jesus and the Finding of Moses; {{several of the}} Popes and two sets of Ancestors.|$|E
25|$|A raised wooden {{platform}} {{supports the}} pulpit, carved with some classical motifs such as rectangular, rounded lozenges and foliation, {{some of it}} gilded, echoing the wall behind it. It has two front piers that resemble antae. On <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> the pulpit is a Palladian Tiffany stained glass window depicting the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple framed by gilded moldings and flanked by pairs of fluted Corinthian pilasters. Bronze statues of angels are on either side.|$|E

25|$|The Benedictine choir {{school at}} Lambach Abbey, Upper Austria, which Hitler {{attended}} {{for several months}} as a boy, had a swastika chiseled into the monastery portal and also <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> the spring grotto in the courtyard by 1868. Their origin was the personal coat of arms of Abbot Theoderich Hagn of the monastery in Lambach, which bore a golden swastika with slanted points on a blue field. The Lambach swastika is probably of Medieval origin.|$|E
25|$|Corbusier's piloti {{perform a}} number of {{functions}} around the house, both inside and out. On the two longer elevations they are flush {{with the face of}} the façade and imply heaviness and support, but on the shorter sides they are set back giving a floating effect that emphasises the horizontal feeling of the house. The wide strip window to the first floor terrace has two baby piloti to support and stiffen <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above.</b> Although these piloti are in a similar plane to the larger columns below a false perspective when viewed from outside the house gives the impression that they are further into the house than they actually are.|$|E
25|$|The Hôtel Alexandre or Hôtel Soult, rue de la Ville l'Évêque, Paris (1763–1766), is {{the sole}} {{survivor}} of Boullée's residential work in Paris. It was built for the financier André-Claude-Nicolas Alexandre. In its cour d'honneur four Corinthian columns embedded against a recess in the wall plane create an entry (now glazed). Flanking doors {{in the corners of}} the courtyard have isolated architraves embedded in <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> their plain openings, while above oval bull's-eye windows are draped with the swags of husks that became a common feature of the neoclassical manner. The garden front has a colossal order of pilasters raised on the high basement occupied by the full height of the ground floor.|$|E

25|$|The Southport Gates {{were built}} {{in place of the}} old Puerta de África in the lower section of the wall. Deadman's Cemetery used to be located on the inner (north) side of <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>above</b> the Southport Gates with some of the headstones dating back to 1738. In 1798 Southport Ditch Cemetery (later renamed Trafalgar Cemetery in honour of the Battle of Trafalgar) was consecrated, a small {{graveyard}} {{on the other side of}} the wall from Deadman's Cemetery. Many of the tombstones are those of victims of the 1804, 1813 and 1814 yellow fever epidemics. Trafalgar Cemetery fell into disuse after 1814. In 1929 Deadman's Cemetery became part of St. Jago's Barracks and was turned into a ball alley and rifle range, with the headstones relocated to Trafalgar Cemetery in 1932 and embedded into one of the walls.|$|E
25|$|Among these trench-built solid-walled {{buildings}} were three that lay some distance {{west of the}} great hall, with the amphitheatrical structure Hope-Taylor {{referred to as the}} assembly-structure lying between them: a pair of rectangular buildings placed end to end with what {{appears to have been a}} wattle fence between them, and an associated building that Hope-Taylor interpreted as a kitchen. These three were the only buildings on the site oriented north-south rather than east-west, and were constructed at the same time as or shortly before the assembly-structure. They were destroyed along with the Great Enclosure around 633, after which a church was built at the east end of the site. The southern building of the pair Hope-Taylor was convinced was a temple. No pottery or other indications of normal domestic use were found in this building. Nor were scattered animal bones. The building had been constructed in two stages: the second was constructed around the first (which was one of the few buildings on the site not to have been burned down), using carefully finished carpentry and heavy buttresses similar to those of the great hall. Inside the inner wall, the trench had been left open or opened up to form a pit approximately 6 feet long and more than 1 foot wide, which was full of animal bones; these had been deposited in at least 9 layers and stacked against <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> the pit after space ran out, and there were half again as many as were found elsewhere on the site. They were mostly bones of oxen, with an extremely high proportion of skulls, and evidently had mostly been slaughtered as young calves, when their meat would be tender, rather than either shortly after birth when male calves would be surplus to dairy farming or after reaching full growth and being usable as draft animals. There were three non-structural postholes from which the posts had been removed before the building was burned and demolished. In addition, outside the northwest corner of the building there was a pit 4 feet in depth in which a post had been placed; nothing was found here except unusually clayey soil compared to the rest of the site, and crushed animal teeth, probably from sheep or goats; numerous thin, pointed stakes had been driven into the ground around this feature. And south of the pit, on the west side of the building, were traces of the successive erection of at least four temporary huts. A smaller, similar set of traces lay to the west of the screen between that building and the one to the north. South of the temple building was a rectangular enclosure that appeared to have been unroofed. There was no door out to this area from the building; both buildings had doors on their two long, east and west sides. Finally, of the graves in the western cemetery area of the site, the northernmost 16 were grouped around the temple building; but no burials lay to the east of the enclosure, suggesting that was where the gate was. All but one body, a child who was buried doubled-over, were buried with their heads to the west. Hope-Taylor considered the burials associated with free-standing posts beside the building and pointed out that although the form of burialstretched out and without grave goodswould have been acceptable to Christians, the dating and association with the un-Christian building mean that at least some of the burials must have occurred during heathen times.|$|E
500|$|Etal Castle {{originally}} overlooked {{a bridge}} over the River Till, and was protected by the steep banks running to the river. The castle forms a rectangular enclosure, approximately , protected by a well-made, but relatively thin, stone curtain wall, mostly [...] thick.

500|$|In {{the centre}} of the ground floor is the Staircase Hall {{described}} in the Buildings of England series as [...] "one of the great architectural spaces of Liverpool". [...] A broad staircase rises between two pairs of Corinthian columns to a half-landing, and narrower flights climb from that on each side to the upper floor. On the ground floor {{on each side of the}} staircase are display cabinets holding the city's silver. On the half-landing is a statue of George Canning dated 1832 by Francis Chantrey, and hanging on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> this is a portrait of Queen ElizabethII by SirEdward Halliday.|$|E
500|$|The south porch {{contains}} a water stoup {{that was said}} miraculously never to dry up; the water was traditionally regarded as having healing powers. There is a second entrance {{on the north side}} through a 15th-century arched doorway decorated with carved human heads. Two verses from Psalm 84 (in Welsh) are written on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> the doorway: [...] "For one day in thy Courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a door-keeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of ungodliness." [...] These are the only surviving portions of the Biblical texts that once decorated the internal walls.|$|E
500|$|The one-story {{building}} has no basement and originally consisted {{of only the}} house and canopy portion, and three Texaco gas pumps. The house, or main office portion of the station includes the interior office and the men's and women's restrooms. The men's restroom is accessed from the interior office and the women's restroom is accessed via an outside door {{on the south side}} of the building. The original [...] "LADIES" [...] sign still protrudes from <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> the entrance. The entire house section of the station is 23 feet (7.0 m) by 14feet (4.3m). The exterior of the building is wood and sided with clapboard, save the garage bay area which is concrete block. The bay was built during World War II, between 194145, and material shortages forced the use of the differing building material.|$|E

500|$|The bill {{stuck to}} <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> the poet's head {{originally}} featured {{a reference to}} Pope {{in which he was}} punningly mocked as [...] "His Holiness Pope Alexander", depicted as an ape wearing a papal tiara with an ass as his Prime Minister. The initial states of the print kept the quotation but replaced the genuine bill with a representation (which appears to have been entirely invented by Hogarth rather than copied from a real bill) of Pope clashing with Edmund Curll over the unauthorised publication of the poet's correspondence. Although Hogarth and Pope had never met, this literary inspiration led to speculation as to the identity of Hogarth's poet as one of the targets of Pope's satire. Ned Ward, the author of The London Spy was a strong contender, as was Lewis Theobald, to whom the lines quoted from Pope in Hogarth's original print referred.|$|E
500|$|Shankly {{had always}} been noted for his use of psychology, both to {{encourage}} his own players and to raise doubt {{in the minds of}} opponents. One of his lasting innovations is the THIS IS ANFIELD plaque secured to <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> the players' tunnel. Coupled with the roar of the crowd, it was designed to intimidate. In the first match after it was erected, Liverpool defeated Newcastle United 5–0, despite an attempt by Malcolm Macdonald to joke about the sign. Shankly would also try to boost the confidence of his own players by announcing that a key opponent was unfit. When Kevin Keegan was about to play against Bobby Moore for the first time, Shankly told him that Moore had been out at a night club and was hung over. Afterwards, Keegan having produced an outstanding performance against the equally outstanding Moore, Shankly told him that Moore had been brilliant that day and Keegan would [...] "never play against anyone better than him".|$|E
500|$|Eddowes' {{body was}} found in Mitre Square in the City of London, three-quarters of an hour after Stride's. The throat was severed and the abdomen was ripped open by a long, deep, jagged wound. The left kidney and the major part of the uterus had been removed. A local man named Joseph Lawende had passed through the square with two friends shortly before the murder, and he {{described}} seeing a fair-haired man of shabby appearance with a woman who may have been Eddowes. His companions were unable to confirm his description. Eddowes' and Stride's murders were later called the [...] "double event". Part of Eddowes' bloodied apron was found at the entrance to a tenement in Goulston Street, Whitechapel. Some writing on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> the apron piece became known as the Goulston Street graffito and seemed to implicate a Jew or Jews, but it was unclear whether the graffito was written by the murderer as he dropped the apron piece, or was merely incidental. Such graffiti were commonplace in Whitechapel. Police Commissioner Charles Warren feared that the graffito might spark anti-semitic riots and ordered it washed away before dawn.|$|E

500|$|St Dona's {{is built}} of rubble masonry, dressed with freestone. [...] The roof {{is made from}} slate, and has a bellcote made from stone at the west end. There is a stone cross finial at {{the east end of}} the roof. [...] The church is entered through a porch on the south side which leads to a doorway dating from the 15th century. [...] The rounded doorway is {{decorated}} with figures of a bird, a dog and a human face on the left, and a cherub on the right. Inside, the nave is separated from the chancel by a step, and the sanctuary is itself raised one step above the chancel. The roof timbers can be seen from inside. [...] The window at the east end has three lights (vertical sections separated by mullions) topped with ogee curves, and is set within a pointed arch with an external hoodmould. It contains stained glass added in 1963, depicting Christ with sea in the background (centre), St Curig (left) and St Dona (right); above them are images of a lion, dove, lamb and eagle. [...] A stone bearing the date 1566 has been set upside down into <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> the east window. [...] The other windows are plain and smaller, with one or two lights.

500|$|Allward {{constructed}} the memorial on {{the vantage point}} of Hill 145, the highest point on the ridge. The memorial contains many stylized features, including 20 human figures, which help the viewer in contemplating the structure as a whole. The front wall, normally mistaken for the rear, is [...] high and represents an impenetrable wall of defence. There is a group of figures {{at each end of the}} front wall, next to the base of the steps. The Breaking of the Sword is located at the southern corner of the front wall while Sympathy of the Canadians for the Helpless is located at the northern corner. Collectively, the two groups are The Defenders and represent the ideals for which Canadians gave their lives during the war. There is a cannon barrel draped in laurel and olive branches carved into <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>above</b> each group, to symbolize victory and peace. In Breaking of the Sword, three young men are present, one of whom is crouching and breaking his sword. This statue represents the defeat of militarism and the general desire for peace. This grouping of figures is the most overt image to pacifism in the monument, the breaking of a sword being extremely uncommon in war memorials. The original plan for the sculpture included one figure crushing a German helmet with his foot. It was later decided to dismiss this feature because of its overtly militaristic imagery. In Sympathy of the Canadians for the Helpless, one man stands erect while three other figures, stricken by hunger or disease, are crouched and kneeling around him. The standing man represents Canada's sympathy for the weak and oppressed.|$|E
