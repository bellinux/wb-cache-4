25|$|Shortly {{after his}} return to Kassel, on his 66th birthday, Rundstedt {{received}} a cheque from Hitler for 250,000 Reichsmarks. This was part of Hitler's policy of buying the continuing loyalty of his senior commanders. Many found this offensive, but none turned down these gifts. Rundstedt <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> next best thing by failing to cash the cheque. By February this was attracting adverse comment in Berlin, and Rundstedt then cashed it. Some writers have sought to connect Rundstedt's acceptance of this money with his continuing refusal to support the resistance movement against Hitler's regime within the German Army. In fact Rundstedt refused {{to have anything to}} do with the money, handing it over to his daughter-in-law, and it was still untouched at his death in 1953.|$|E

25|$|Ralea's {{energies}} {{were also}} drawn into administrative disputes and professional rivalries. Alongside Brătianu, he fought to obtain Oțetea a permanent {{seat at the}} University of Iași, {{at the expense of}} PNȚ colleague Ioan Hudiță. He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same for Rosetti, but was met with the stiff opposition of linguist Giorge Pascu. Hudiță was particularly vexed by these maneuvers, and, in 1934, asked for a formal inquiry by Parliament, and even for a formal review of Ralea's own 1926 appointment. More privately, Hudiță also claimed that Ralea was having affairs with his female students, and even with younger girls who presented to Ralea for their baccalaureate examination. Such criticism did not dissuade Ralea. In 1937, he also managed to obtain an Iași University chair for Călinescu, in controversial circumstances.|$|E
25|$|England's innings – like Australia's – {{revolved}} around their opener, {{in this case}} Len Hutton, who became the second Englishman to carry his bat through an innings against Australia, the other being Bobby Abel's 132 not out at Sydney in 1891–92. Hutton made 156 not out in England's 272, hit 11 fours and nobody else made 30. Ray Lindwall (3/51) dismissed Cyril Washbrook for 2 when the pedestrian Jack Iverson took a high, leaping catch when the batsmen heaved {{the ball to the}} leg-side. The spinners were soon on and Hutton hit Ian Johnson for two boundaries. He went two yards down the wicket and was almost stumped by Don Tallon for 34, but he nicked the ball and the deflection made Tallon miss both the catch and the stumping. Reg Simpson was the second highest scorer with 29 and together they added 83 for the second wicket before Simpson was bowled by the left-arm bowler Bill Johnston and England finished the day 96/2. The following morning Lindwall and Miller argued with Tallon that he ought to stand three yards closer to the stumps as the pitch was so slow. He refused and Lindwall bowled at a reduced pace, so nudged by Miller Tallon moved up for the third ball, which nicked Denis Compton's bat and the keeper took the catch low off the ground. Had he remained back Tallon could not have made the catch. The other England batsmen made a steady procession to and from the wicket as Bill Johnston (3/68) and Iverson (3/58) worked their way through the order as Hutton batted serenely on, now untouchable by any of the bowlers. David Sheppard almost ran Hutton out when he rushed down the wicket to get off the mark, Godfrey Evans <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same, but Hutton wisely ignored him and the keeper scrambled back before his wicket was wrecked by Lindwall. Freddie Brown was caught leg before by Miller (1/30), who immediately appealed and Umpire Cocks gave him out, then the ball rolled back onto his stumps and knocked off a bail, so he ended up being bowled. Debutant Roy Tattersall was crowded by the Australian fielders and was caught by Neil Harvey off Iverson for a duck. John Warr was bowled for another duck by Bill Johnston. Doug Wright came in at 219/9 and held off the Australian attack for over an hour as he and Hutton added 53 for the last wicket, resembling their last stand at Brisbane. Lindwall wasn't recalled to the attack until after 5 o'clock and promptly caught the Kent spinner leg before wicket for 14. England were out for 272, 99 runs behind Australia and Hutton was applauded off the field by the Australian team.|$|E

The move was criticised as being ill-judged by Johnny Marr, who stated that “It’s really simple: they made themselves look like idiots. It’s ridiculous. No-one put a gun to their head.

500|$|The 1960s {{setting of}} X-Men: First Class, technologically {{inspired}} by the James Bond films of that era, also added to the international feel of the characters. Kinberg said the series was a major influence for the way they [...] "did a cool job representing the period, {{in a way it}} still felt muscular and action-oriented", and Vaughn added that Magneto was his attempt to recreate Sean Connery's Bond in both style and the [...] "badass, charming, ruthless and sweet" [...] personality. The director said his goal was to [...] "feel like a '60s Bond film, but {{with a little bit of}} reality it could be grounded in.

2500|$|The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) {{attempted}} to de-recognize the {{college in the}} 2010–11 academic year, after which the college management went to court seeking a stay on the order for a year. The college got the stay, and later also managed to get it extended for the academic year 2011–12. However, when it <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> same for the 2012–13 academic year, the Bombay High Court refused and upheld the AICTE's order in a ruling on 22 August 2012.The AICTE had not granted the Extension of Approval to continue the undergraduate courses in the college, (thus halting its first-year admissions in the DTE-managed CAP rounds of 2012) and had directed the college to shut down immediately, transferring the current students to other engineering colleges of the University of Mumbai. An [...] "expert committee" [...] of the AICTE visited the college for inspection on 6 August 2012, and after inspection it gave a [...] "zero deficiency" [...] report regarding the college infrastructure, facilities, etc. But even then, AICTE did not change its decision of derecognising the college. The Yuva Sena (youth wing of the Shiv Sena political party) protested the AICTE decision at the Mumbai regional office of the AICTE. A contentious issue {{in the matter of}} the college not being allowed to function was the college not possessing the required Occupancy Certificate from the Thane Municipal Corporation. But on 27 August 2012, the college obtained the Occupancy Certificate, and then challenged the High Court ruling by appealing in the Supreme Court of India. The hearing was expected on 29 August 2012, but it was postponed to 4 September 2012 due to late availability of the High Court order copy. Classes, examinations and other works continued at the college till December 2012, when the Supreme Court issued its verdict in favour of AICTE. Thus, PCoE had to be closed down and all current students were transferred (by the Directorate of Technical Education of the state Government of Maharashtra) to other engineering colleges of the University of Mumbai. But the Supreme Court also imposed a fine of Rs 50,000 on AICTE for the delay of 2 years (2008–09 and 2009–10) in its initiative to investigate the case of the college (under the previous trustee Mr. Tekchand Shah) shifting campuses without following proper procedures.|$|E
