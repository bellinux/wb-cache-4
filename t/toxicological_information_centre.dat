40|$|This {{contribution}} {{reports on}} several mercury non-professional intoxications. It {{can be summarized}} {{that it is very}} important to differentiate among forms of mercury which can (acute or chronic) endanger human health. Contrarily to the wide spread fears, liquid mercury represents low danger for men and for environment. Solid amalgams are probably the less toxic forms of mercury compounds. On the other hand, widely spread daily consumer goods can be very dangerous and toxic (saving balls, fluorescent tubes, etc.). Moreover, these goods are not marked as “toxic mercury containing”. The article discusses the instruction for removing mercury from our environment.

40|$|Waterproofing {{agents are}} widely used to protect leather and {{textiles}} in both domestic and occupational activities. An outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome following exposure to waterproofing sprays occurred during the winter 2002 - 2003 in Switzerland. About 180 cases were reported by the Swiss <b>Toxicological</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre</b> between October 2002 and March 2003, whereas fewer than 10 cases per year had been recorded previously. The reported cases involved three brands of sprays containing a common waterproofing mixture, that had undergone a formulation change in the months preceding the outbreak. A retrospective analysis was undertaken {{in collaboration with the}} Swiss <b>Toxicological</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre</b> and the Swiss Registries for Interstitial and Orphan Lung Diseases to clarify the circumstances and possible causes of the observed health effects. Individual exposure data were generated with questionnaires and experimental emission measurements. The collected data was used to conduct numeric simulation for 102 cases of exposure. A classical two-zone model was used to assess the aerosol dispersion in the near- and far-field during spraying. The resulting assessed dose and exposure levels obtained were spread on large scales, of several orders of magnitude. No dose-response relationship was found between exposure indicators and health effects indicators (perceived severity and clinical indicators). Weak relationships were found between unspecific inflammatory response indicators (leukocytes, C-reactive protein) and the maximal exposure concentration. The results obtained disclose a high interindividual response variability and suggest that some indirect mechanism(s) predominates in the respiratory disease occurrence. Furthermore, no threshold could be found to define a safe level of exposure. These findings suggest that the improvement of environmental exposure conditions during spraying alone does not constitute a sufficient measure to prevent future outbreaks of waterproofing spray toxicity. More efficient preventive measures are needed prior to the marketing and distribution of new waterproofing agents...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Human {{contact with}} {{potentially}} toxic plants, which may occur through abuse or by accident or attempted suicide, is frequent and sometimes results in clinically significant toxicity. OBJECTIVE: The {{aim of the}} present study was to identify which plants may lead to severe poisoning, and to define the clinical relevance of plant toxicity for humans in Switzerland. METHODS: We analyzed 42, 193 cases of human plant exposure and 255 acute moderate, severe, and lethal poisonings, which were reported to the Swiss <b>Toxicological</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre</b> between January 1995 and December 2009. RESULTS: Plant contact was rarely responsible for serious poisonings. Lethal intoxications were extremely rare and were caused by plants with cardiotoxic (Taxus baccata) or mitosis-inhibiting (Colchicum autumnale) properties. CONCLUSIONS: Most often, plant contact was accidental and patients remained asymptomatic or developed mild symptoms, which fully resolved within a short time...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Although extended-release (XR) {{formulations}} {{are recognized}} to bear some risk of pharmacobezoar formation in overdose, {{there are no}} previously documented reports of this phenomenon with quetiapine. We describe nine cases of pharmacobezoar formation in acute quetiapine XR overdose. METHODS: Observational case series of all patients who underwent gastroscopy after quetiapine XR overdose, which were reported by physicians to the Swiss <b>Toxicological</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre</b> between January 2010 and December 2012, with detailed analysis of cases with documented pharmacobezoar. RESULTS: Gastric pharmacobezoars were detected in 9 out of 19 gastroscopic evaluations performed during the study period. All these patients ingested a large dose of quetiapine XR (10 - 61 tablets; 6 - 24. 4 g quetiapine). All patients but one also coingested {{at least one other}} substance, and in three cases another XR drug formulation. Gastroscopic pharmacobezoar removal was achieved without complications in all patients, but was difficult due to the particular "gelatinous-sticky-pasty" consistency of the concretion. The subsequent clinical course was favorable. CONCLUSIONS: The possibility of pharmacobezoar formation following a large quetiapine XR overdose should be considered, as this may influence acute patient management. Complete endoscopic pharmacobezoar removal may be a promising approach in selected cases, but further studies are needed to define its role...|$|E

This study investigated the circumstances, pharmacokinetics and outcomes of overdose with cyclosporine and tacrolimus reported to the Swiss <b>Toxicological</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre</b> between 1995 and 2011. Of 145   396 reports by healthcare professionals, 28 (0. 02 %) concerned enteral or parenteral overdose with these calcineurin inhibitors. Thirteen (46 %) were iatrogenic errors, 12 (43 %) were with suicidal intent and 3 (11 %) were accidental. Iatrogenic overdoses usually involved noncapsule drug formulations. Acute enteral overdoses caused symptoms in a dose-dependent fashion but were generally well tolerated; the mean multiple of patient's usual dose was 20. 8 ± 28. 8 for symptomatic versus 4. 4 ± 3. 4 for asymptomatic cases (p = 0. 037). The most common symptoms were nausea, headache, somnolence, confusion, hypertension and renal impairment. In contrast, acute intravenous overdoses were often poorly tolerated and resulted in one fatality due to cerebral edema after a cyclosporine overdose. Enteral decontamination measures were performed in six cases involving oral ingestion and appeared to reduce drug absorption, as shown by pharmacokinetic calculations. In the one case where it was used, pharmacoenhancement appeared to accelerate tacrolimus clearance after intravenous overdose...|$|E

The {{purpose of the present}} study was to compare the clinical outcomes of caustic ingestion injury in elderly and non-elderly adults with regard to gender, intent of exposure, substance ingested, severity of mucosal injury, complications, and mortality. Caustic substance exposures reported to the National <b>Toxicological</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre</b> in Slovakia during 1998 – 2015 were reviewed retrospectively. The patients were divided into two groups: the non-elderly (< 60 years) and elderly adults (≥ 60 years). The mortality rate in the elderly was significantly higher (elderly 23. 0 % vs. non-elderly 11. 3 %; p = 0. 041). The risk of fatal outcome in the elderly was increased by acid ingestion (OR = 7. 822; p = 0. 002), particularly hydrochloric acid (OR = 5. 714, p = 0. 006). The incidence of respiratory complications was almost two times higher in the elderly was 31. 1 % vs. 17. 4 % for the non-elderly (p = 0. 037). Respiratory complications significantly correlated with an increased mortality rate (p = 0. 001) in the elderly whereas there was no association between GI complications and mortality in the elderly (p = 0. 480).

A total of 14 verified spider bites were recorded, involving five species from four families: Zoropsis spinimana (five cases), Cheiracanthium punctorium (four cases), Tegenaria atrica (three cases) and one case of Malthonica ferruginea (= Tegenaria ferruginea) (both Agelenidae), and one case of Amaurobius ferox (Amaurobiidae). The bites of all spider species produced relatively mild symptoms. Local symptoms such as moderate to severe pain, circumscribed swelling and redness were the only effects in most cases. Systemic symptoms were rare. There was complete recovery in all cases and all lesions healed completely without further damage or secondary disorders. Following {{a review of the}} European spider bite literature, the number of spider species capable of biting humans in Europe is considered to be much larger than could be concluded from this study. Most spider bites are restricted to species living synanthropically, thus promoted by climate and habitat change. The annual frequency of spider bites in Switzerland is estimated at 10 - 100 bites per million inhabitants, but this is predicted to increase due to the continuous arrival of new alien species, many of which have a high potential to establish in urban areas...|$|E

Our objectives were to describe all cases of overdose with thiopurines reported to the Swiss <b>Toxicological</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Centre</b> between 1995 - 2013. A retrospective analysis was performed to determine circumstances, magnitude, management and outcome of overdose with these substances. A total of 40 cases (14 paediatric) were reported (azathioprine, n = 35; 6 -mercaptopurine, n = 5). Of these, 25 were with suicidal intent, 12 were accidental and 3 were iatrogenic errors. The magnitude of overdose ranged from 1. 5 to 43 (median 8) times the usual dose in adults. Twelve cases (30 %) had attributable symptoms. The majority of these were minor and included gastrointestinal complaints and liver function test and blood count abnormalities. Symptoms were experienced by patients who took at least 1. 5 -times their usual daily thiopurine dose. Overdoses over two or more consecutive days, even if of modest size, were less well tolerated. One case of azathioprine and allopurinol co-ingestion over consecutive days led to agranulocytosis. Decontamination measures were undertaken in 11 cases (10 activated charcoal, 1 gastric lavage) and these developed fewer symptoms than untreated patients. This study shows that acute overdoses with thiopurines have a favourable outcome in the majority of cases and provides preliminary evidence that gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal may reduce symptom development after overdose of these substances if patients present to medical services soon after ingestion...|$|E
