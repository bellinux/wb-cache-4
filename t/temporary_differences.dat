50|$|Modern {{accounting}} standards typically require {{that a company}} provides for deferred tax in accordance with either the <b>temporary</b> <b>difference</b> or timing difference approach.

50|$|The substantively enacted future tax rates, in UPC’s various jurisdictions, {{range from}} 3.0% to 26.5%. In fiscal 2013, the Corporation {{incurred}} current tax recoveries of $13,000 and future tax recoveries of $3,021,000. The combined tax recoveries {{for the current}} year of $3,034,000 reflects an effective tax rate of approximately 3.1% compared to tax recoveries of $18,997,000 and an effective tax rate of 7.8% in the prior year. The decline in the effective tax rate is primarily {{a result of an}} increase in the proportion of deductible <b>temporary</b> <b>differences</b> arising in the year that have not been benefited as deferred tax assets or used to offset tax liabilities, and an increase in the proportion of inventory held by the Luxembourg branch of UPC’s wholly owned subsidiary, Uranium Participation Cyprus Limited, which is taxed at the lowest rate within the Corporation.|$|E
50|$|In the United States, the U.K. and elsewhere, {{companies}} {{are permitted to}} report one pre-tax income number (also called income before tax, profit before tax or earnings before income tax) to shareholders, and another, called taxable income, to the tax authorities. Differences between taxable income and the pre-tax income or profit number reported for financial statements are either temporary or permanent in nature. Permanent differences result when deductibility rules differ in perpetuity between accounting and tax law. <b>Temporary</b> <b>differences</b> result when the recognition of deductions for tax and accounting standards differ in their timing. The result is a gap between tax expense computed using income before tax and current tax payable computed using taxable income. This gap is known as deferred tax. If the tax expense exceeds the current tax payable {{then there is a}} deferred tax payable; if the current tax payable exceeds the tax expense then there is a deferred tax receivable.|$|E

50|$|In {{many cases}} the {{deferred}} tax outcome will be similar for a <b>temporary</b> <b>difference</b> or timing difference approach.

Samples used in this study are 71 manufacturing companies listed in Indonesia Stock Exchange during years 2010 - 2012. Methods of statistical analysis used multiple regresion using the program SPSS 16.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} career concerns on risky arbitrage. It presents an analytically tractable model where some fund managers can locate arbitrage opportunities, i. e., fundamentally very similar assets with a <b>temporary</b> <b>difference</b> in their price. Fund managers need operating capital from investors to exploit these opportunities. Investors judge the abilities of fund managers and decide whether to keep or fire them based on their past performance. Career concerns of fund managers distort their strategies which effect prices. In equilibrium, investors keep those arbitrageurs with higher probability who speculate on fast convergence of prices, even if the expected profit of this strategy is lower. As an effect, fund managers over invest in these strategies which increase the probability of liquidity crises: episodes with large price divergences and large aggregate losses of fund managers without {{any change in the}} fundamentals...|$|R
