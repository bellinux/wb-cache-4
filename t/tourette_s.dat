40|$|A {{nanotube}} array {{based on}} vertically aligned nanotubes or carbon nanofibers has been invented {{for use in}} localized electrical stimulation and recording of electrical responses in selected regions of an animal body, especially including the brain. There are numerous established, emerging, and potential applications for localized electrical stimulation and/or recording, including treatment of Parkinson s disease, <b>Tourette</b> <b>s</b> syndrome, and chronic pain, and research on electrochemical effects involved in neurotransmission. Carbon-nanotube-based electrodes offer potential advantages over metal macroelectrodes (having diameters {{of the order of}} a millimeter) and microelectrodes (having various diameters ranging down to tens of microns) heretofore used in such applications. These advantages include the following: a) Stimuli and responses could be localized at finer scales of spatial and temporal resolution, which is at subcellular level, with fewer disturbances to, and less interference from, adjacent regions. b) There would be less risk of hemorrhage on implantation because nano-electrode-based probe tips could be configured to be less traumatic. c) Being more biocompatible than are metal electrodes, carbon-nanotube-based electrodes and arrays would be more suitable for long-term or permanent implantation. d) Unlike macro- and microelectrodes, a nano-electrode could penetrate a cell membrane with minimal disruption. Thus, for example, a nanoelectrode could be used to generate an action potential inside a neuron or in proximity of an active neuron zone. Such stimulation may be much more effective than is extra- or intracellular stimulation via a macro- or microelectrode. e) The large surface area of an array at a micron-scale footprint of non-insulated nanoelectrodes coated with a suitable electrochemically active material containing redox ingredients would make it possible to obtain a pseudocapacitance large enough to dissipate a relatively large amount of electric charge, so that a large stimulation current could be applied at a micron-scale region without exhausting the redox ingredients. f) Carbon nanotube array is more compatible with the three-dimensional network of tissues. Particularly, a better electrical-neural interface can be formed. g) A carbon nanotube array inlaid in insulating materials with only the ends exposed is an extremely sensitive electro-analysis tool that can measure the local neurotransmitter signal at extremely high sensitivity and temporal resolution...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedDespite {{decades of}} studies the {{etiology}} of alcoholism remains elusive. Recent work strongly supports genetic models, estimating the genetic contributions to risk at 32 % - 73 %. Further, studies have implicated inhibition as {{a key factor in}} alcoholism it is known to be comorbid with a number of disinhibitory disorders, including Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, Conduct Disorder, <b>Tourette</b> <b>s</b> Syndrome, and Antisocial Personality Disorder. However, work by Cloninger and colleagues suggests that two distinct forms of alcoholism exist, and that these forms have correspondingly distinct biological components.; To examine this relationship in more detail, this study employed a behavioral control model first proposed by Jeffrey Gray, differentiating activation (the preparation of a response) from inhibition (the cessation of a potential response prior to overt action). Pre-adolescent twins were examined {{in the context of this}} model utilizing the P 300 Event-Related Potential (ERP). P 300 ERPs elicited during both NoGo and Oddball tasks were first examined for their relationship to behavioral control, as measured by impulsive response (NoGo errors). These P 300 s were thenexamined within twins at risk for both types of alcoholism, as defined by paternal alcohol abuse and paternal antisocial behavior. Finally, genetic analyses were performed on the P 300 ERPs using the entire twin sample, in order to understand {{the etiology of}} inhibition and activation themselves.; Results showed different patterns of relationships between the NoGo and Oddball P 300 ERPs with impulsive responses (NoGo errors), suggesting that NoGo P 300 ERPs most likely index the inhibitory pathway of the behavioral control system, while Oddball P 300 ERPs most likely index the activation pathway. Twins at risk for either type of alcoholism differed from controls in both NoGo and target Oddball P 300 ERPs, but did not differ in novel P 300 ERP amplitude. Conversely,Type I and Type II risk groups differed in novel Oddball P 300 ERP amplitudes, but not NoGo or target Oddball P 300 ERP amplitudes. This suggests that inhibitory differences underlie the risk for both types of alcoholism, but that activation differences underlie only Type II risk. Genetic analyses revealed that a two factor common pathway multivariate model best described the measured P 300 s, with one factor loading primarily onto novel Oddball P 300 s, and the other loading primarily onto NoGo P 300 s. It is concluded that these factors likely represent some form of activation and inhibition, further supporting the notion that inhibition differences are a common factor underlying all alcohol abuse risk, while genetically distinct activation differences underlie Type II but not Type I alcohol abuse risk...|$|E
40|$|Learning from {{experience}} requires knowing whether a past action {{resulted in a}} desired outcome. The prefrontal cortex and basal ganglia are thought to play key roles in such learning of arbitrary stimulus-response associations. Previous studies have found neural activity in these areas, similar to dopaminergic neurons' signals, that transiently reflect whether a response is correct or incorrect. However, {{it is unclear how}} this transient activity, which fades in under a second, influences actions that occur much later. Here, we report that single neurons in both areas show sustained, persistent outcome-related responses. Moreover, single behavioral outcomes influence future neural activity and behavior: behavioral responses are more often correct and single neurons more accurately discriminate between the possible responses when the previous response was correct. These long-lasting signals about trial outcome provide a way to link one action to the next and may allow reward signals to be combined over time to implement successful learning.

40|$|More {{than half}} of all {{children}} and adolescents with Tourette syndrome show evidence of psychiatric comorbidity, exhibiting symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder, and other anxiety and mood disorders. Although the prevalence of co-occurring conditions varies depending on the clinical setting, it is crucial for clinicians to be familiar with these disorders because they are often more impairing than tics and can influence the initial treatment choice. Left untreated, these conditions can negatively affect important developmental outcomes, such as academic and social functioning. We review the most common co-occurring disorders, the relationship of these co-occurring disorders to Tourette syndrome, and treatment recommendations for co-occurring conditions when tic symptoms are present. (J Child Neurol 2006; 21 : 657 – 664; DOI 10. 2310 / 7010. 2006. 00170). From the time of Gilles de la Tourette’s initial report {{in the late nineteenth century}} until the mid- 1960 <b>s,</b> <b>Tourette</b> syndrome was predominantly characterized as a psychologic disorder. With the discovery in the mid- 1960 s that antipsychotic medications helped reduce tic severity, Tourette syndrome was more appropriately characterized as neurologic.

40|$|Objective: Obsessive-compulsive {{disorder}} (OCD) and Tourette's syndrome {{are highly}} heritable neurodevelopmental disorders that {{are thought to}} share genetic risk factors. However, the identification of definitive susceptibility genes for these etiologically complex disorders remains elusive. the authors report a combined genome-wide association study (GWAS) of Tourette's syndrome and OCD. Method: the authors conducted a GWAS in 2, 723 cases (1, 310 with OCD, 834 with Tourette's syndrome, 579 with OCD plus Tourette's syndrome/chronic tics), 5, 667 ancestry-matched controls, and 290 OCD parent-child trios. GWAS summary statistics were examined for enrichment of functional variants associated with gene expression levels in brain regions. Polygenic score {{analyses were conducted to}} investigate the genetic architecture within and across the two disorders. Results: Although no individual single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) achieved genome-wide significance, the GWAS signals were enriched for SNPs strongly associated with variations in brain gene expression levels (expression quantitative loci, or eQTLs), suggesting the presence of true functional variants that contribute to risk of these disorders Polygenic score analyses identified a significant polygenic component for OCD (p= 2 x 10 (- 4)), predicting 3. 2 % of the phenotypic variance in an independent data set. in contrast, Tourette's syndrome had a smaller, nonsignificant polygenic component, predicting only 0. 6 % of the phenotypic variance (p= 0. 06). No significant polygenic signal was detected across the two disorders, although the sample is likely underpowered to detect a modest shared signal. Furthermore, the OCD polygenic signal was significantly attenuated when cases with both OCD and co-occurring Tourette's syndrome/chronic tics were included in the analysis (p= 0. 01). Conclusions: Previous work has shown that Tourette's syndrome and OCD have some degree of shared genetic variation. However, the data from this study suggest that there are also distinct components to the genetic architectures of these two disorders. Furthermore, OCD with co-occurring burette's syndrome/chronic tics may have different underlying genetic susceptibility compared with OCD alone.
