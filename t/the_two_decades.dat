5|$|The Lý {{court had}} not intervened when the Song general Di Qing (1008–1061) crushed the border {{rebellion}} of Nùng Trí Cao in 1053. During <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> of relative regional peace that followed, the Lý observed {{the threat of}} Song expansion, as more Han Chinese settlers moved into areas which the Lý relied upon for the extraction of natural resources. Initially, a division of Di Qing's soldiers (originally from Shandong) had settled the region, followed by a wave of Chinese settlers from north of the Yangzi River.|$|E

5|$|The leading Western economies adopted Keynes's policy {{recommendations}} before {{the outbreak of}} World War II, and in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> following Keynes's death in 1946, almost all capitalist governments had done so. Keynes's influence waned in the 1970s, {{partly as a result}} of the stagflation that plagued the Anglo-American economies during that decade, and partly because of criticism of Keynesian policies by Milton Friedman and other monetarists. He and other economists had disputed the ability of government to regulate the business cycle favourably with fiscal policy.|$|E
5|$|East Germany was {{particularly}} {{successful in the}} 1970s and 1980s, when they dominated the women's events, aided by systematic state-sponsored doping. Their women swept the award for the first ten years of its existence from 1980 to 1989, with Kristin Otto winning three times, before the Berlin Wall and communism fell. With {{the end of the}} state-sponsored doping program, the (East) German stranglehold on women's swimming was broken. In <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> since reunification, the female award was won by Germans four times, three by Franziska van Almsick. During the 1980s, Michael Gross of West Germany, nicknamed The Albatross in reference to his vast wingspan, dominated European swimming, winning five consecutive awards from 1982 to 1986. Swimming World has vacated all awards previously awarded to East German swimmers because of the government-sanctioned systematic doping.|$|E

5|$|In Bulgaria, <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> {{following}} {{the end of}} the rebellion marked the lowest point of decline of the Second Empire. The reigns of George Terter I (r. 1280–1292) and his successor Smilets (r. 1292–1298) were characterised with constant Mongol interference in the state's domestic affairs and progressive disintegration of Imperial authority in favour of the feudal magnates. Bulgaria had lost almost all lands to the south of the Balkan mountains to the Byzantines and was in no position to regain these regions. The fortunes of the country changed for the better under George Terter I's son, Theordore Svetoslav (r. 1300–1321), when Bulgaria acquired Bessarabia from the Mongols and reconquered Northern Thrace from the Byzantines, bringing stability and prosperity.|$|E
5|$|Kurfürst Friedrich Wilhelm {{served as}} the {{flagship}} of the Imperial fleet from her commissioning in 1894 until 1900. She saw limited active duty during her service career with the German fleet due to the relatively peaceful nature of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As a result, her career focused on training exercises and goodwill visits to foreign ports. These training maneuvers were nevertheless very important to developing German naval tactical doctrine in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> before World War I, especially {{under the direction of}} Alfred von Tirpitz. She, along with her three sisters, saw only one major overseas deployment, to China in 1900–01, during the Boxer Rebellion. The ship underwent a major modernization in 1904–05.|$|E
5|$|New {{airspeed}} {{records were}} set after the 1929 and 1931 Schneider Trophy contests, both achieved using the R engine. In <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> before World War II, {{the quest to}} break the land speed record was hotly contested, particularly so in the early 1930s. Aero engines were often used to power wheeled vehicles to ever-higher speeds, chosen because of their high power-to-weight ratios: the Liberty engine, Napier Lion and the Sunbeam Matabele were among the engine types used in the 1920s. The Rolls-Royce R was the latest development in high-powered aero engine design at the time, and was chosen by several makers of land speed record-contending cars; the engine was also chosen for powerboats attempting the water speed record. One car and two boats successfully used the combined power of two R engines.|$|E

5|$|Ryholt's {{hypothesis}} regarding Sheshi {{comes with}} his dating {{the start of}} the 14th Dynasty around 1805 BC, over 90 years earlier than accepted by most Egyptologists. They propose instead that the 14th Dynasty emerged during <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> of Merneferre Ay's reign, which is dated to between 1700 BC and 1660 BC, depending on the scholar. Ay is the last 13th Dynasty pharaoh to be attested in Lower Egypt, and most scholars therefore contend that he abandoned Itjtawy, the capital of Egypt since the reign of Amenemhat I (c. 1980 BC), in favor of Thebes as he lost control of the Delta region to the 14th Dynasty.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the murders and of the victims drew {{attention}} to the poor living conditions in the East End and galvanised public opinion against the overcrowded, unsanitary slums. In <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> after the murders, the worst of the slums were cleared and demolished, but the streets and some buildings survive and the legend of the Ripper is still promoted by guided tours of the murder sites. The Ten Bells public house in Commercial Street was frequented by {{at least one of the}} victims and was the focus of such tours for many years. In 2015, the Jack the Ripper Museum opened in east London.|$|E
5|$|The {{unfinished}} {{painting was}} exhibited in Whitechapel in 1886, under the intentionally simplified title of The Sun. Watts {{worked on the}} painting for a further five years, and the completed version was exhibited {{for the first time}} at the New Gallery in 1891. Between 1902 and 1906 the painting was exhibited around the United Kingdom, and it is now in the collection of the Watts Gallery in Compton, Surrey. As Watts did not include After the Deluge in his gift to the nation of what he considered his most significant works, it is not among his better-known paintings. However, it was greatly admired by many of Watts's fellow artists, and has been cited as an influence on numerous other painters who worked in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> following its initial exhibition.|$|E

5|$|Brandenburg {{served with}} the I Division during {{the first decade of}} her service with the fleet. This period was {{generally}} limited to training exercises and goodwill visits to foreign ports. These training maneuvers were nevertheless very important to developing German naval tactical doctrine in <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> before World War I, especially under the direction of Alfred von Tirpitz. The ship saw her first major deployment in 1900, when she and her three sister ships were deployed to China to suppress the Boxer Rebellion. In the early 1900s, all four ships were heavily rebuilt. She was obsolete by the start of World War I and only served in a limited capacity, initially as a coastal defense ship. In December 1915, she was withdrawn from active service and converted into a barracks ship. Brandenburg was scrapped in Danzig, after the war, in 1920.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantines {{were unable}} to respond {{effectively}} to the Muslim advance in Africa, because <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> between 695 and 715 were a period of great domestic turmoil. They did react with raids of their own in the East, {{such as the one}} in 709 against Egypt which captured the local admiral, but they also were aware of a coming onslaught: as Caliph al-Walid I (705–715) readied his forces for a renewed assault against Constantinople, Emperor Anastasios II (713–715) prepared the capital, and mounted an unsuccessful pre-emptive strike against the Muslim naval preparations. Anastasios was soon overthrown by Theodosius III (715–717), who in turn was replaced, just as the Muslim army was advancing through Anatolia, by Leo III the Isaurian (717–741). It was Leo III who faced the second and final Arab siege of Constantinople. The use of Greek fire, which devastated the Arab fleet, was again instrumental in the Byzantine victory, while a harsh winter and Bulgar attacks further sapped the besiegers' strength.|$|E

5|$|The Half Day area {{experienced}} an economic boom {{with the arrival}} of new settlers during <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> after Wright's arrival. Among these pioneers were Seth Washburn, the first postmaster of the Vernon Township, who settled at the site of what later became the Lincolnshire-Prairie View School District 103's Half Day Intermediate School, and Laura Sprague, the first teacher to reside in the area. By 1855, 21years after the settling of the Half Day area by Wright, the town was a thriving community with a blacksmith's shop, sawmill, country store, and a church. At this time, the Chicago and Milwaukee Railroad connected Milwaukee to the county seat of Waukegan, and it expanded throughout the Lake County area over the next few decades; this also contributed to the town's prosperity. Henry Ford's invention of the automobile in the early 20thcentury made Half Day a more accessible destination to other communities within the Chicago metropolitan area, and the village became a popular recreation area. This prompted the opening of many businesses, including an amusement park, a race track, a bowling alley, a dance hall, and taverns, that catered to visitors.|$|E
