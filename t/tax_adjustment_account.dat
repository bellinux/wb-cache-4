40|$|This study {{proposes a}} rule of payroll <b>tax</b> <b>adjustment,</b> arguing that the optimal payroll <b>tax</b> <b>adjustment</b> rate should be set {{in such a way}} that the {{marginal}} excess burden associated with a payroll <b>tax</b> <b>adjustment</b> is kept to a minimum and that the implicit return rates for current retirees are guaranteed at certain levels. We find that the optimal payroll <b>tax</b> <b>adjustment</b> rate is a function of labor supply elasticity, the perceived marginal benefit-tax linkage, the pre-adjusted payroll tax rate, the population growth rate, the wage growth rate, and the guaranteed return rate. The sign of the optimal payroll <b>tax</b> <b>adjustment</b> rate is ambiguous. The optimal payroll <b>tax</b> <b>adjustment</b> rate falls in accordance with the population growth rate and the wage growth rate, but rises with the guaranteed return rate.

40|$|In this paper, {{analysis}} is presented {{relating to the}} impact of border <b>tax</b> <b>adjustments</b> for climate policy on the international competitiveness of energy-intensive industries, and the related problem of carbon leakage. While many of the economic and legal issues are not particularly new, climate policy does present some possible twists to the analysis of border <b>tax</b> <b>adjustments</b> when vertically-related markets can be characterized as a successive oligopoly. Specifically, an appropriate border <b>tax</b> <b>adjustment</b> will depend on the incidence of a domestic carbon tax, the nature of competition in upstream and downstream sectors, as well as the basis for assessing the trade neutrality of any border <b>tax</b> <b>adjustment.</b> If trade neutrality is defined in terms of market volume, even though carbon leakage is reduced, domestic firm competitiveness cannot be maintained. This compares to defining trade neutrality in terms of market share, which results in domestic competitiveness being maintained and global carbon emissions being reduced. climate policy, carbon leakage, border <b>tax</b> <b>adjustments,</b> imperfect competition, Environmental Economics and Policy, International Relations/Trade, H 87, Q 38,...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of a {{unilateral}} carbon tax in developed countries focusing on the expected size of carbon leakage (an increase in emissions in non-taxing regions {{as a result of the}} tax) and the effects on leakage of border <b>tax</b> <b>adjustments.</b> We start by analyzing the problem using a simple two-country, three-good general equilibrium model to develop intuitions. We then simulate the expected size of the effects using a new, open-source, computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. We analyze the extent of emissions reductions from a carbon tax in countries that made commitments under the Kyoto Protocol (Annex B countries), the expected carbon leakage, and the effects of border <b>tax</b> <b>adjustments</b> on carbon leakage, all relative to our baseline projections for emissions. We also perform extensive sensitivity tests on the parameters of the CGE model. Finally, we consider the effects of imperfect border <b>tax</b> <b>adjustments</b> on leakage, such as global or regional schedules of border taxes.

40|$|The {{cost-effectiveness}} of unilateral emission abatement can {{be seriously}} hampered by carbon leakage. We assess three widely discussed proposals for leakage reduction targeted at energy-intensive and trade-exposed industries: carbon-motivated border <b>tax</b> <b>adjustments,</b> industry exemptions from carbon regulation, and output-based allocation of emission allowances. We find {{that none of}} these measures amounts to a “magic bullet ” when both efficiency and equity criteria matter. Border <b>tax</b> <b>adjustments</b> reduce leakage and provide global cost savings but exacerbate regional inequality. Exemptions produce very little leakage reduction and run the risk of increasing climate policy cost. Output-based allocation does no harm but also does relatively little good by our outcome measures.

40|$|Abstract (1285) Ben Lockwood and John Whalley We discuss {{emerging}} {{proposals for}} border <b>tax</b> <b>adjustments</b> (BTAs) to accompany commitments to reduce carbon {{emissions in the}} EU, the US and other OECD economies. The rationale offered for such border adjustment is that various entities, such as the EU, if making commitments to reduce emissions which go beyond those undertaken in {{other regions of the}} world, impose added costs on domestic producers which create a competitive disadvantage for them. Some form of remedy is viewed as reasonable to maintain the competitiveness of domestic industries when responding to global environmental problems. In this paper, we argue that despite its current carbon manifestation, the issue of border <b>tax</b> <b>adjustments</b> and both their rationale and their effects on trade are not new and, despite the present debate (which seems to overlook older literature), have arisen before. Earlier debate on border <b>tax</b> <b>adjustments</b> occurred {{at the time of the}} adoption of the value-added tax (VAT) in the EU as a tax harmonisation target in the early 1960 s. But academic literature of the time showed that a change between origin and destination basis in the VAT would be neutral and hence the use of a destination-based tax in the EU to accompany the VAT offered no trade advantage to Europe. Here we argue that essentially the same arguments also apply for carbon-motivated BTAs, and in the current debate there seems to be a misconception between price-level effects and relative price effects stemming from a BTA, which needs correcting. We also argue that the impact of border <b>tax</b> <b>adjustments</b> should be viewed as independent of the motivation of the adjustments. Copyright 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. ...|$|R

While the possibility of catastrophic damages contingent on unmitigated climate change provides cogent reasons for self-interested, large countries to unilaterally mitigate there are practical reasons for them not to do so. A key concern for developed countries is possible carbon leakages. For developing countries, the need to pursue growth objectives can restrict the proclivity to mitigate. Carbon leakage issues can be addressed using border <b>tax</b> <b>adjustments</b> although these raise computational complexity, GATT-rules consistency and equity issues for developing countries.

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{benefits}} of intergenerational risk-sharing through both private funded pensions and via the public debt. We use a multi-period overlapping generation model with a pay-as-you-go pension pillar, a funded pension pillar and a government. Shocks are smoothed via the public debt and variations in the indexation of pension entitlements and pension contributions. The intensity of these adjustments increases when the pension funding ratio or public debt gets closer to their boundaries. The best-performing pension arrangement is a hybrid funded scheme in which both contributions and entitlement indexation are simultaneously deployed as stabilisation instruments. We find that contribution and indexation adjustment policies are substitutes {{and the same is}} the case for contribution and <b>tax</b> <b>adjustment</b> policies. By contrast, indexation and <b>tax</b> <b>adjustment</b> policies are complements.
