5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{effective}} as medication given {{a couple of}} hours before surgery to relieve anxiety. They also produce amnesia, which can be useful, as patients may not remember unpleasantness from the procedure. They are also used in patients with dental phobia as well as some ophthalmic procedures like refractive surgery; although such use is controversial and only recommended for those who are very anxious. Midazolam is the most commonly prescribed for this use because of its strong sedative actions and fast recovery time, as well as its water solubility, which reduces pain upon injection. Diazepam and lorazepam are sometimes used. Lorazepam has particularly marked amnesic properties <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>make</b> it more effective when amnesia is the desired effect.|$|E

25|$|In America, {{not only}} do U.S. {{students}} receive sex education within school or religious programs, {{but they are also}} educated by their parents.

They promote abstinence while educating their children with things <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>make</b> their adolescents not want to engage in sexual activity.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{government}} policy to reduce identity to “just a Rwandan one” has only “been {{successful in the}} public sphere of government rhetoric and bureaucracy.” In fact, ethnicity still remains socially relevant. Its salience however has been transferred into the private sphere—a space <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>make</b> the divisions even more destructive. Thus, the concept of “eliminating” ethnicity is problematic in both concept and reality—as it is unreasonable to expect such a drastic change in the Rwandan perception.|$|E
25|$|There is {{also the}} ability to adopt {{different}} types of fake dreadlocks <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>make</b> the hair look as real as possible. This process is called synthetic dreadlocks. There are {{two different types of}} synthetic dreadlocks. The first is dread extensions, in which other hair can be infused with the wearer's own hair. The second is dreadfalls, in which one dread is tied into another with either elastic or lace. Both of these methods are used to make dreads look better and more appealing, and to achieve the desired effect of longer hair.|$|E

25|$|Christopher Steele, {{a former}} MI6 agent, {{was hired by}} Fusion GPS to produce {{opposition}} research on Donald Trump. His reports were first sold to Republicans, then to Democrats, and included alleged kompromat <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>make</b> Trump vulnerable to blackmail from Russia. A 33-page compilation was leaked to the press in October 2016 but was not published by mainstream media who doubted the material's credibility. In December 2016, two more pages were added alleging efforts by Trump's lawyer to pay those who had hacked the DNC and arranging to cover up any evidence of their deeds. On January 5, 2017, U.S. intelligence agencies briefed President Obama and President-elect Trump {{on the existence of}} these documents. Eventually, the dossier was published in full by BuzzFeed on January 11.|$|E

For example, patents have been obtained but the patents are being ignored by provincial health systems in Canada. In Australia and the UK, Myriad's licensee permitted use by health systems, but announced a change of plans in August 2008. ... Only a single mutation has been patented in Myriad's lone European-wide patent, although some patents remain under review of an opposition proceeding. In effect, the United States is the only jurisdiction where Myriad's strong patent position has conferred sole-provide status." [...] Peter Meldrum, CEO of Myriad Genetics, has acknowledged that Myriad has [...] "other competitive advantages <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>make</b> such [...] enforcement unnecessary" [...] in Europe.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of Tribunal were {{generally}} positive, though to lesser amounts {{than was the}} case for Morrowind. Aggregate scoring sites gave the game generally favourable scores: Metacritic, a score of 80; GameRankings, a score of 82. Most critics commented on the greater linearity of the experience, combined with a reduction in the total size of the play area, giving the changes mixed reviews. GameSpot reported sullenly on the change: [...] "it's somewhat surprising that the Tribunal expansion confines your adventures to the relatively small setting of the municipality Mournhold," [...] and that, in light of this change, [...] "Tribunal doesn't have many of the features that made Morrowind so appealing." [...] IGN stated that although [...] "you'll rarely lose sight of what you're doing or why," [...] a fact <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>make</b> the game more [...] "comprehensible" [...] for some players, [...] "the lack of interaction {{with the rest of the}} world is pretty depressing." [...] RPGamer, by contrast, was unequivocally positive about the change: [...] "Bethesda ... neatly sidesteps two of the most difficult atmospheric flaws of Morrowind—the constant sense of emptiness, and the bland outdoor landscapes—by having the story take place entirely within the city of Mournhold .... This smaller, tighter playing field ensures that every minor detail can and does get attention." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} an orchestral intro that {{introduces}} the first track [...] "Honeymoon Avenue", a downtempo song composed {{in the key}} of F-sharp major and set in a [...] time signature at a moderate tempo of 63 beats per minute. The song explores the 1950s musical style mixing doo-wop with an urban-inspired sound. Lirically, [...] "Honeymoon Avenue" [...] uses several metaphors to speaks about someone in a car being driven by her (romantic) partner. The driver is stuck to the same old route and driving mode <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>make</b> them crash. In interview with MTV, Grande explained its lyrics saying that [...] "Honeymoon Avenue" [...] "is about knowing you are {{at the end of}} a relationship and wishing it could not be the end and go back to the beginning and start over." [...] The second track [...] "Baby I" [...] is drenched in a [...] "retro sound" [...] from 1990s R and pop sonority. Lyrically, [...] "Baby I" [...] is a confession on Grande's behalf admitting a special love for someone and how she can't formulate her strong feelings into words. The elements of [...] "Baby I" [...] are further illustrated by its use of finger snaps, a syncopated beat, horns and drums.|$|E

500|$|The pelage of the koala {{is thicker}} and {{longer on the}} back, and shorter on the belly. The ears have thick fur on both the inside and outside. The back fur colour varies from light grey to {{chocolate}} brown. The belly fur is whitish; on the rump it is dappled whitish, and darker at the back. [...] The koala has the most effective insulating back fur of any marsupial and is highly resilient to wind and rain, while the belly fur can reflect solar radiation. The koala's curved, sharp claws are well adapted for climbing trees. The large forepaws have two opposable digits (the first and second, which are opposable to the other three) {{that allow them to}} grasp small branches. On the hindpaws, the second and third digits are fused, a typical condition for members of the Diprotodontia, and the attached claws (which are still separate) are used for grooming. As in humans and other primates, koalas have friction ridges on their paws. The animal has a sturdy skeleton and a short, muscular upper body with proportionately long upper limbs that contribute to its climbing and grasping abilities. Additional climbing strength is achieved with thigh muscles that attach to the shinbone lower than other animals. The koala has a cartilaginous pad {{at the end of the}} spine <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>make</b> it more comfortable when it perches in the fork of a tree.|$|E
500|$|The game's trivia {{is based}} on general {{knowledge}} from several fields including science, history, and geography, combined with contemporary entertainment, celebrities, and other news items; the game, {{as well as the}} series, is often described as [...] "high culture meets pop culture". For example, one question asks the players to identify which Jennifer Aniston film title would most likely have been suited for a hypothetical romantic comedy penned by Albert Einstein about the interactions between neutrons and electrons, the answer being [...] "He's Just Not That Into You". In addition to the usual questions, each episode typically features a [...] "Dis or Dat" [...] question. This question gives the players seven words or phrases which they have to identify as one of two possible classifications, or in some cases, both. For example, one Dis or Dat series asks the players to identify terms that would be features of a Nexus One phone, Nexxus shampoo, or both. In offline play, only one player participates, while other players try to steal by getting it right if the main player gets it wrong. [...] In online play, all players play the Dis Or Dat simultaneously. Players are also urged to look for the [...] "Wrong Answer of the Game", which is hinted at by the show's sponsor; for example, in an episode sponsored by a baby crib company, the answer [...] "Cat's Cradle" [...] is the Wrong Answer of the Game. Choosing the correct Wrong Answer does not penalize the player but instead rewards them with a large monetary bonus. Other questions are presented in the standard multiple choice format but use recurring concepts, such as questions based on a fortune cookie message, or ones read through Cookie's ventriloquist dummy incorporating a speech impediment <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>make</b> the question harder to understand.|$|E

2500|$|Bacterial E. coli-based two hybrid methods [...] (abbreviated as B2H) {{have several}} {{characteristics}} <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>make</b> them preferable to yeast-based homologues.

2500|$|Recent {{advances}} in high-resolution genetics and X-ray absorption spectroscopy are providing revelations on the biogeochemical relations between microorganisms and minerals <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>make</b> Nickel's (1995) biogenic mineral exclusion obsolete and Skinner's (2005) biogenic mineral inclusion a necessity. For example, the IMA commissioned [...] "Environmental Mineralogy and Geochemistry Working Group" [...] deals with minerals in the hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere. The group's scope includes mineral-forming microorganisms, which exist {{on nearly every}} rock, soil, and particle surface spanning the globe to depths of at least 1600 metres below the sea floor and 70 kilometres into the stratosphere (possibly entering the mesosphere). Biogeochemical cycles {{have contributed to the}} formation of minerals for billions of years. Microorganisms can precipitate metals from solution, contributing to the formation of ore deposits. They can also catalyze the dissolution of minerals.|$|E
