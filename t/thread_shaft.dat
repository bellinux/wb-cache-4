40|$|Abstract. When rolling <b>thread</b> <b>shaft</b> {{in cross}} wedge rolling, forming quality of thread is {{affected}} by many process parameters such as the thread helix angle, which is a special and complex parameter. However, there is few study {{of the effect of}} the thread helix angle on <b>thread</b> <b>shaft</b> forming. In this paper how thread helix angle affects axial metal flow was analyzed from the perspective of rolling force and the forming process of <b>thread</b> <b>shaft</b> was simulated with different helix angles by the deform- 3 D software. Through the measurement of the point coordinates, the effect of the helix angle on the axial metal flow of rolled pieces was analyzed. Finally, the conclusion was obtained that helix angle causes the asymmetry of axial metal flow with small difference values for asymmetry and the axial metal flow of rolled pieces increases as the helix angle increases. The rolling thread segment can be ensured in the middle of rolled pieces by moving the blank a suitable distance in the reverse direction of the axial flow direction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The defects of {{the lower}} tooth height and of larger pitch in thread portion of rolled pieces are prone to {{appearing}} when rolling <b>thread</b> <b>shaft</b> in cross wedge rolling. To solve this problem, changing the blank shape and size were tried. Two types of concave conical and round blanks are designed with concave conical blanks obtained by rolling in the cross wedge rolling. Because {{the design of the}} rolling die is simple, good precision of blank can be ensured. Multiple size types of blanks were designed and the rolling experiment was made in the rolling mill of model H 630. By measuring the values of the tooth height and pitch, the effect of blank shape on thread shafts rolled in the wedge rolling were investigated carefully. The reasonable size range of the blank shape was obtained. The conclusions above pave the theoretical foundation for the in-depth study on this technology...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effects of variations in thread shape on the axial pullout strength of orthodontic miniscrews. Methods: A total of 35 miniscrews, 7 of each design being considered, were tested by performing pullout tests on a synthetic bone support. We used self-tapping and self-drilling miniscrews having a diameter of 2 mm and a <b>thread</b> <b>shaft</b> length of 12 mm (the longest and the largest supplied by the manufacturer). A buttress reverse thread shape served as the control design and was tested against 4 experimental designs, each manufactured with a modification in thread shape while maintaining all other characteristics. The experimental groups had the following thread designs: buttress, 75 ° joint profile, rounded, and trapezoidal. Results: The control group with a buttress reverse thread shape had consistently higher pullout strength values than did the other designs. A statistically significant reduction in pullout force was found between the buttress reverse and the buttress thread miniscrews. Conclusions: Thread design influenced the resistance to pullout of the orthodontic miniscrews. The buttress reverse thread shape provided the greatest pullout strength. © 2012 by the American Association of Orthodontists...|$|E

40|$|In a {{proposed}} improvement of tooling for friction stir welding, gimballed shoulders would supplant shoulders that, heretofore, have been fixedly aligned with pins. The proposal is especially relevant to self-reacting friction stir welding. Some definitions of terms, recapitulated from related prior NASA Tech Briefs articles, are prerequisite to a meaningful {{description of the}} proposed improvement. In friction stir welding, one uses a tool that includes (1) a rotating shoulder on top (or front) of the workpiece and (2) a pin that rotates with the shoulder and protrudes from the shoulder into {{the depth of the}} workpiece. In conventional friction stir welding, the main axial force exerted by the tool on the workpiece is reacted through a ridged backing anvil under (behind) the workpiece. When conventional friction stir welding is augmented with an auto-adjustable pin-tool (APT) capability, the depth of penetration of the pin into the workpiece is varied in real time by a position- or forcecontrol system that extends or retracts the pin as needed to obtain the desired effect. In self-reacting (also known as self-reacted) friction stir welding as practiced heretofore, there are two shoulders: one on top (or front) and one on the bottom (or back) of the workpiece. In this case, a <b>threaded</b> <b>shaft</b> protrudes from the tip of the pin to beyond the back surface of the workpiece. The back shoulder is held axially in place against tension by a nut on the <b>threaded</b> <b>shaft.</b> Both shoulders rotate with the pin and remain aligned coaxially with the pin. The main axial force exerted on the workpiece by the tool and front shoulder is reacted through the back shoulder and the <b>threaded</b> <b>shaft</b> into the friction-stir-welding machine head, so that a backing anvil is no longer needed. A key transmits torque between the bottom shoulder and the <b>threaded</b> <b>shaft,</b> so that the bottom shoulder rotates with the shaft.

40|$|A {{tool that}} would be useable in both {{conventional}} and self-reacting friction stir welding (FSW) has been proposed. The tool would embody both a prior tooling concept for self-reacting FSW and an auto-adjustable pin-tool (APT) capability developed previously as an augmentation for conventional FSW. Some definitions of terms are prerequisite to a meaningful description of the proposed tool. In conventional FSW, depicted in Figure 1, one uses a tool that includes (1) a rotating shoulder on top (or front) of the workpiece and (2) a rotating pin that protrudes from the shoulder into {{the depth of the}} workpiece. The main axial force exerted by the tool on the workpiece is reacted through a ridged backing anvil under (behind) the workpiece. When conventional FSW is augmented with an APT capability, the depth of penetration of the pin into the workpiece is varied in real time by a position- or force-control system that extends or retracts the pin as needed to obtain the desired effect. In self-reacting (also known as self-reacted) friction stir welding (SR-FSW), there are two rotating shoulders: one on top (or front) and one on the bottom (or back) of the workpiece. In this case, a <b>threaded</b> <b>shaft</b> protrudes from the tip of the pin to beyond the back surface of the workpiece. The back shoulder is held axially in place against tension by a nut on the <b>threaded</b> <b>shaft.</b> The main axial force exerted on the workpiece by the tool and front shoulder is reacted through the back shoulder and the <b>threaded</b> <b>shaft,</b> back into the FSW machine head, so that a backing anvil is no longer needed. A key transmits torque between the bottom shoulder and the <b>threaded</b> <b>shaft,</b> so that the bottom shoulder rotates with the shaft. A tool for SRFSW embodying this concept was reported in "Mechanism for Self-Reacted Friction Stir Welding" (MFS- 31914), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 28, No. 10 (October 2004), page 53. In its outward appearance, the proposed tool (see Figure 2) would fit the above description of an SR-FSW tool. In this case, the FSW machine would have an APT capability and the pin would be modified to accept a bottom shoulder. The APT capability could be used to vary the distance between the front and back shoulders in real time to accommodate process and workpiece-thickness variations. The tool could readily be converted to a conventional FSW tool, with or without APT capability, by simply replacing the modified pin with a conventional FSW pin...|$|R

The <b>threaded</b> <b>shaft</b> of the screw has 10 degrees mobility in all directions, but its structure is to prevent abnormal translation and tilting. This screw was evaluated as follows: (1) endurance test: 106 times rotational stress was applied; (2) biological reactions: novel screws with a mobile head and conventional screws with a fixed head were inserted into the bilateral pedicles of the L 3, L 4, and L 5 in two mini pigs with combination. Eight months after surgery, vertebral units with the screw rod constructs were collected. After CT scan, the soft and bony tissues around the screws were examined grossly and histologically. As a result, none of the screws broke during the endurance test stressing. The mean amount of abrasion wear was 0. 0338 [*]g. In the resected mini pig section, though zygapophyseal joints between fixed-head screws showed bony union, the amount of callus in the zygapophyseal joints connected with mobile-head screws was small, and joint space was confirmed by CT. No metalloses were noted around any of the screws. Novel screws were suggested to be highly durable and histologically safe...|$|R

40|$|A {{mechanism}} {{has been}} designed to apply the loads (the stirring and the resection forces and torques) in self-reacted friction stir welding. This mechanism differs somewhat from mechanisms used in conventional friction stir welding, as described below. The tooling needed to apply the large reaction loads in conventional friction stir welding can be complex. Self-reacted friction stir welding has become popular in the solid-state welding community as a means of reducing the complexity of tooling and to reduce costs. The main problems inherent in self-reacted friction stir welding originate in the high stresses encountered by the pin-and-shoulder assembly that produces the weld. The design of the present mechanism solves the problems. The mechanism includes a redesigned pin-and-shoulder assembly. The welding torque is transmitted into the welding pin by a square pin that fits into a square bushing with set-screws.

50|$|A rod end bearing, {{also known}} as a heim joint (N. America) or rose joint (U.K. and elsewhere), is a {{mechanical}} articulating joint. Such joints are used on the ends of control rods, steering links, tie rods, or anywhere a precision articulating joint is required, and where a clevis end (which requires perfect 90 degree alignment between the attached shaft and the second component) is unsuitable. A ball swivel with an opening through which a bolt or other attaching hardware may pass is pressed into a circular casing with a <b>threaded</b> <b>shaft</b> attached. The <b>threaded</b> portion may be either male or female. The heim joint's advantage is that the ball insert permits the rod or bolt passing through it to be misaligned to a limited degree (an angle other than 90 degrees). A link terminated in two heim joints permits misalignment of their attached shafts (viz., other than 180 degrees) when used in tension. When used in compression, the through-rods are forced to the extreme ends of their ball's misalignment range, which cocks the link at an oblique angle.|$|R

We present the design of an improved screw-spline drive mechanism based on a profiled <b>threaded</b> <b>shaft</b> and nut that reduces the part count and simplifies manufacturing and assembly. To determine the optimal parameters for the profile shape, an analytical expression was derived that relates the tolerance between the nut and shaft to the angular backlash, which was validated using SolidWorks.

This model was compared to data collected during targeting experiments performed in ex-vivo tissue samples where the distal tip of the stylet was repositioned in ex-vivo bovine tissue and the location of its distal tip was recorded with CT imaging. Results demonstrated that the drive mechanism operated robustly and targeting errors of less than 2 mm were achieved. I...|$|R
