5|$|The Bible {{is central}} in Zwingli's {{work as a}} {{reformer}} and is crucial {{in the development of}} his theology. Zwingli appealed to scripture constantly in his writings. This is strongly evident in his early writings such as Archeteles (1522) and llarity and Certainty of the Word of God (1522). He believed <b>that</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> a liar and only God is the truth. For him scripture, as God's word, brings light when there is only darkness of error.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{assumption}} <b>that</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> a social animal, Saint-Just argues that in nature {{there is no need}} for contracts, legislation, or acts of force. These constructs only become necessary when a society is in need of moral regeneration and serve merely as unsatisfactory substitutes for the natural bonds of free people. Such constructs permit small groups to assume unwarranted powers which, according to Saint-Just, leads to corruption within society. Because a return to the natural state is impossible, Saint-Just argues for a government composed of the most educated members of society, who could be expected to share an understanding of the larger social good. Outside the government itself, Saint-Just asserts there must be full equality between all men, including equal security in material possessions and personal independence. Property must be protected by the state but, in order to secure universal independence, all citizens (including women) must own property.|$|E
5|$|Book XI covers {{human beings}}, portents and transformations. Isidore derives human beings (homo) from the Latin for soil (humus), as in Genesis 2:7 it says <b>that</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> {{made from the}} soil. Urine (urina) gets its name either {{from the fact that}} it can burn (urere) the skin or, Isidore hedges, that it is from the kidneys (renes). Femina, meaning woman, comes from femora/femina meaning thighs, as this part of the body shows she is not a man. The Latin for {{buttocks}} is clunis as they are near the large intestine or colon (colum).|$|E

50|$|Early theorists {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> better eyewitnesses than women. This belief {{began with}} William Stern, who claimed <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> better at remembering details and {{less susceptible to}} misleading information than women. However, subsequent studies challenged Sternâ€™s findings. Several contemporary findings show that overall; there are no significant gender differences in eyewitness memory.|$|R
50|$|Sonja B. Starr {{conducted}} {{a study in the}} US that found that the prison sentences <b>that</b> <b>men</b> serve <b>are</b> on average 63% longer than those that women serve when controlling for arrest offense and criminal history. However, the study does not purport to explain why this is the case. Starr does not believe <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> disadvantaged generally. Men's rights advocates have argued <b>that</b> <b>men</b> being over-represented in both those who commit murder and the victims of murder <b>is</b> evidence <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> being harmed by outmoded cultural attitudes.|$|R
5|$|The sermon {{relies on}} scripture to emphasise the divine will in calling people {{to serve their}} fellow men, which is a common theme in Swift's sermons. This calling, as Swift claims, is based on {{historical}} events that reinforce scripture and allow mankind to know of the divine will. In particular, {{the development of the}} state and of the human body are parallel to each other, and England may soon be entering into a decline. However, Swift emphasises <b>that</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> imperfect, and that sin is a symbol of this imperfectness.|$|E
25|$|In his {{commentary}} on the Torah, Rabbi Bahya ben Asher (11th century, Spain) concludes {{that there were many}} time systems occurring in the universe long before the spans of history <b>that</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> familiar with. Based on the Kabbalah he calculates that the Earth is billions of years old.|$|E
25|$|Content {{theory of}} human {{motivation}} includes both Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory. Maslow's theory {{is one of}} the most widely discussed theories of motivation. Abraham Maslow believed <b>that</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> inherently good and argued that individuals possess a constantly growing inner drive that has great potential. The needs hierarchy system, devised by Maslow (1954), is a commonly used scheme for classifying human motives.|$|E

50|$|The Hippocratic Corpus writers {{indicated}} <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> {{more rational}} than women, and that women's physiology made them susceptible to problems {{that would cause}} symptoms of irrationality. Continuing with this assumption <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> more rational, <b>men</b> dominated the profession of physicians, an occupation requiring rational research, and for which they believed women were not suited.|$|R
50|$|Hollingworth also {{attacked}} the variability hypothesis theoretically, criticizing the underlying {{logic of the}} hypothesis. Hollingworth argued that the variability hypothesis was flawed because: (1) it had not <b>been</b> empirically established <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> more anatomically variable than women, (2) even if greater anatomical variability in <b>men</b> <b>were</b> established this would not necessarily mean <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> also more variable in mental traits, (3) even if it <b>were</b> established <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> more variable in mental traits this would not automatically mean <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>were</b> innately more variable, (4) variability is not significant in and of itself, but rather {{depends on what the}} variability consists of, and (5) that any possible differences in variability between men and women must also be understood with reference to the fact that women lack the opportunity to achieve eminence because of their prescribed societal and cultural roles. Additionally, the argument that great variability automatically meant greater range was criticized by Hollingworth.|$|R
25|$|Nietzsche {{considered}} a free spirit {{to be the}} embodiment of a transvaluation of all values. Prior to Nietzsche's time, he claimed, the scientific method of searching for truth and knowledge was met with scorn and derision. A quiet, cautious, modest manner was seen with contempt. Our present modesty compels us to recognize man's derivation from animals, not divinities. Also, we know <b>that</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> not superior to other animals. By reducing man to a mere machine, devoid of free will, we have learned much about his physiology. Will is now {{known to be a}} necessary reaction to a stimulus. Consciousness and spirit derive from instinct.|$|E
25|$|People {{often say}} that {{machines}} enslave man and that technology dehumanises society, {{but they are}} wrong! It is the manufacturer that enslaves man. It is to the manufacturer <b>that</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> condemned to a life sentence of forced labour. The manufacturer enslaves man, but robots free us. The only reason that technology is dehumanising society is because humans still {{have to work with}} the machines used for forced labour, or because they must clock in to where the forced labour takes place. That is the problem, humans and machines should not be mixed together. Humans are designed to spend their time in places of fulfilment, while machines are designed to function in the workplace, under the supervision of robots and computers.|$|E
25|$|The {{natural law}} was {{inherently}} teleological, however, {{it is most}} assuredly not deontological. For Christians, natural law is how man manifests the divine image in his life. This mimicry of God's own life is impossible to accomplish except {{by means of the}} power of grace. Thus, whereas deontological systems merely require certain duties be performed, Christianity explicitly states that no one can, in fact, perform any duties if grace is lacking. For Christians, natural law flows not from divine commands, but from the fact <b>that</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> made in God's image, man is empowered by God's grace. Living the natural law is how man displays the gifts of life and grace, the gifts of all that is good. Consequences are in God's hands, consequences are generally not within man's control, thus in natural law, actions are judged by three things: (1) the person's intent, (2) the circumstances of the act and (3) the nature of the act. The apparent good or evil consequence resulting from the moral act is not relevant to the act itself. The specific content of the natural law is therefore determined by how each person's acts mirror God's internal life of love. Insofar as one lives the natural law, temporal satisfaction {{may or may not be}} attained, but salvation will be attained. The state, in being bound by the natural law, is conceived as an institution whose purpose is to assist in bringing its subjects to true happiness. True happiness derives from living in harmony with the mind of God as an image of the living God.|$|E

25|$|Conservatives {{reject the}} {{assertion}} that different laws prescribed {{for men and women}} imply <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> more valuable than women. Ali ibn Musa Al-reza reasoned {{that at the time of}} marriage a man has to pay something to his prospective bride, and <b>that</b> <b>men</b> <b>are</b> responsible for both their wives' and their own expenses but women have no such responsibility.|$|R

He wrote, [...] "Vivisection in my opinion is the blackest of all the blackest crimes <b>that</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> at present committing against god and his fair creation." ...|$|E

500|$|Lee's words set the {{standard}} by which Washington's overwhelming reputation was impressed upon the American memory. Biographers hailed him as the great exemplar of republicanism. [...] Washington set many precedents for the national government, and the presidency in particular, and was called the [...] "Father of His Country" [...] as early as 1778. Washington's Birthday is a federal holiday in the United States. In terms of personality, biographer Douglas Southall Freeman concluded, [...] "the great big thing stamped across <b>that</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> character." [...] By character, says David Hackett Fischer, [...] "Freeman meant integrity, self-discipline, courage, absolute honesty, resolve, and decision, but also forbearance, decency, and respect for others." ...|$|E

500|$|In later years, Rilkeâ€™s Duino Elegies and the Sonnets to Orpheus {{influenced}} Hans-Georg Gadamerâ€™s {{theories of}} hermeneuticsâ€”understanding how an observer (i.e. reader, listener, or viewer) interprets cultural artifacts (i.e. works of literature, music, or art) {{as a series}} of distinct encounters. [...] Gadamer, using examples of Rilke's poetry in his writings, interprets these works as an experience of a divine [...] "totality" [...] that we must approach with a childlike innocence and ignoranceâ€”that only through interpreting and reinterpreting can we cope with or solve the existential problems of humanityâ€™s significance and impermanence. [...] Gadamer points out <b>that</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> in a condition influenced by an anonymous, alienated, and mechanical world that has evolved to stand as an obstacle to his ability to make sense of such experiences.|$|E

[...] <b>That</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> Germany Schulz, Yost's great center". [...] Penn even announced that they were moving their star tackle, Draper, to center in an effort to stop Schulz. In the end, Penn beat Michigan, 6â€“0, marking the first time the Wolverines had ever lost a game at Ferry Field.|$|E
500|$|Some of Heinlein's {{other works}} {{have also been}} {{described}} as racist, though Franklin argues {{that this was not}} unique to Heinlein, and that he was less racist than the U.S. government of the time. Heinlein's early novel Sixth Column was called a [...] "racist paean" [...] to a white resistance movement against an Asian horde derived from the Yellow Peril. In 1978, Moorcock wrote that Starship Troopers [...] "set the pattern for Heinlein's more ambitious paternalistic, xenophobic" [...] stories. Robert Lowndes argues that the war between the Terrans and the Arachnids is not about a quest for racial purity, but rather an extension of Heinlein's belief <b>that</b> <b>man</b> <b>is</b> a wild animal. According to this theory, if man lacks a moral compass beyond the will to survive, and he was confronted by another species with a similar lack of morality, then the only possible moral result would be warfare.|$|E
