60|$|As the {{fighting}} receded from our {{position for a}} moment, Thuvia <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>me</b> with a question.|$|E
60|$|Then, while Calvert {{spoke to}} Miss Carrington, Grace <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>me</b> {{with a sudden}} look of interest.|$|E
60|$|One of them <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>me</b> with a sardonic smile {{upon his}} thin, cruel lips--it was Zat Arrras.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lay {{your hands}} upon the {{shoulder}} of John Carter," [...] she said to them, <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> <b>me,</b> [...] "the man to whom Helium owes her princess {{as well as her}} victory today." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, then," [...] said she, <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> <b>me,</b> [...] "will {{you do me}} {{the favor}} to flirt with me? Say for twenty-five minutes," [...] looking at her watch; [...] "that will bring us to four o'clock, when I must go indoors." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{laughing}} at me," [...] says honest Foul-weather Dick, seeing William <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> <b>me</b> and smile.--"No, indeed," [...] says my husband; [...] "that last objection of yours to the four-post beds on shore seems {{by no means}} ridiculous to me, at any rate. I once knew a gentleman, Dick, who practically realized your objection." ...|$|R
60|$|I saw Perry crumple in his seat. He {{gave himself}} a shake and sat erect again. Then he <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|He <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>me</b> for {{the first}} time. I saw a last {{vanishing}} trace of doubt in his eyes as they looked into mine.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{may hold}} my fingers," [...] she said; [...] "and please keep your face <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>me.</b> Why are you nervous? I am not very formidable." ...|$|E
60|$|His {{face was}} still averted from <b>me.</b> I <b>turned</b> it <b>toward</b> <b>me,</b> {{with my own}} hands, by main force.|$|R
60|$|She {{finished}} her letter, {{and put the}} address, and closed the envelope. Then she <b>turned</b> round <b>toward</b> <b>me</b> again.|$|R
60|$|The {{night was}} falling, and the Emperor's haggard face gleamed white through the gloom as he <b>turned</b> it <b>toward</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
60|$|The eyes of {{my companions}} lighted, and grim smiles of {{pleasure}} and anticipation overspread their faces, as each eye <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>me</b> questioningly. But I shook my head.|$|E
60|$|In {{less than}} half an hour we were off. It was only when the great car swung from the avenue into the country lane that Jacky, who was driving, <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{was sitting}} at the table {{arranging}} the pages she was going to read, and at the question she <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>me.</b> Her face was flushed, but not, I think, with displeasure.|$|E
60|$|At {{the sound}} they <b>turned</b> and ran <b>toward</b> <b>me,</b> asking how I felt.|$|R
60|$|He <b>turned</b> {{the book}} <b>toward</b> <b>me,</b> {{and pointed to}} a slip of paper which {{occupied}} the lower half of a page.|$|R
60|$|Still {{she gently}} shook her head, and looked away. Suddenly she <b>turned</b> her face <b>toward</b> <b>me.</b> Her blue eyes sparkled, her lips parted, {{and there was}} a flush upon her temples.|$|R
60|$|Then as she <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>me,</b> evidently with {{a word of}} {{explanation}} on her lips, her eyes suddenly widened as they rested upon me, and with a little exclamation she started toward me.|$|E
60|$|Lys {{stood with}} a heavy blanket wrapped around her slender figure, and as I {{approached}} her, she half <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>me</b> to see who it was. When she recognized me, she immediately turned away.|$|E
60|$|Phaidor alone {{retained}} {{her presence}} of mind. Two {{of the guards}} she ordered to bear away Thuvia of Ptarth; the others she commanded to remain and prevent me from following. Then she <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>me.</b>|$|E
60|$|I went to Sadler {{and found}} him, to my surprise, in bed. As I entered {{he sat up}} and <b>turned</b> a face <b>toward</b> <b>me</b> which sickened me as I looked at it.|$|R
60|$|The rest {{happened}} in the fraction of a second. There was a rending crash above us, then a deafening explosion within the chamber. Smoke and powder fumes filled the room. Half stunned, I rose from the lifeless body of my antagonist {{just in time to}} see Victory stagger to her feet and <b>turn</b> <b>toward</b> <b>me.</b> Slowly the smoke cleared to reveal the shattered remnants of the guard. A shell had fallen through the palace roof and exploded just in the rear of the detachment of guardsmen who were coming to the rescue of their emperor. Why neither Victory nor I were struck is a miracle. The room was a wreck. A great, jagged hole was torn in the ceiling, and the wall toward the corridor had been blown entirely out.|$|R
60|$|Even as my mind {{framed the}} thought, Woola halted {{suddenly}} before a narrow, arched doorway in the cliff by the trail's side. Quickly he crouched {{back away from}} the entrance, at the same time <b>turning</b> his eyes <b>toward</b> <b>me.</b>|$|R
6000|$|He obeyed at once, and, as {{he slowly}} urged up the unruly sash, the {{handsome}} profile was again <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>me,</b> and again I was possessed by my first impression so strongly that I involuntarily said,-- ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Bundercombe <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>me</b> and I {{produced}} the case. The manager seized it eagerly, opened it, {{turned on the}} electric light and closed the case again with a great sigh of relief. He held out his hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} how the lady {{discovered}} that her unauthorized admirer had gone away, but she did discover it, and she <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>me</b> for an instant and gave me what I supposed was a look of gratitude.|$|E
60|$|He <b>turned</b> {{his eyes}} <b>toward</b> <b>me</b> quickly, as a deep flush overspread his face, and I knew {{full well that}} I had hit the mark while repeating {{much the same as}} Hiram had invented {{for the benefit of the}} sergeant.|$|R
6000|$|... "But since you've come up again, {{you ought}} to be satisfied," [...] said Mrs. Lecks. [...] "And now," [...] she added, <b>turning</b> her face <b>toward</b> <b>me,</b> [...] "which way ought we to try to swim? and have we got everythin' we want to take with us?" ...|$|R
60|$|Saying these words, I smiled. I don't {{know why}} I smiled, {{except that it}} seemed {{absolutely}} impossible to mention Almayer's name without a smile of a sort. It had not to be necessarily a mirthful smile. <b>Turning</b> his head <b>toward</b> <b>me,</b> Captain C---- smiled, too, rather joylessly.|$|R
60|$|He {{led the way}} reluctantly into a sitting-room. There {{were red}} plush chairs set at regular {{intervals}} against the wall, and {{a table in the}} middle covered by papers--mostly out of date. Delora closed the door and <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>me</b> sternly.|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll get {{the crop}} and the cattle feed; you don't suppose we've bought {{it to look}} at; and if you died the pay would stop," [...] said Harry dryly, and <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>me</b> when Hudson, moving away contented, sat down to enjoy a {{peaceful}} smoke.|$|E
60|$|Juag again <b>turned</b> <b>toward</b> <b>me,</b> {{but this}} time in surprise. I was abreast him in a moment and, passing him, walked {{straight}} toward the two beasts. As I did so the female crouched with bared fangs. The male, however, leaped forward to meet me, not in deadly charge, but with every expression of delight and joy which the poor animal could exhibit.|$|E
6000|$|The {{next day}} my {{amanuensis}} bade me good-morning in her former pleasant manner, but without <b>turning</b> <b>toward</b> <b>me</b> seated herself quickly at the table, {{and took the}} manuscript from the drawer. [...] "Oh, ho!" [...] I thought, [...] "then you can speak; {{and it was not}} the rules which made you behave in that way, but your own pique, which has worn off a little." [...] I glanced at her as she intently looked over the work of the day before, and I was considering whether or not it would be fitting for me to show that there might be pique {{on one side of the}} grating as well as on the other, when suddenly my thoughts were interrupted by a burst of laughter,--girlish, irrepressible laughter. With the manuscript in her hands, my nun actually leaned back in her chair and laughed so heartily that I wonder my grandmother did not hear her.|$|R
6000|$|... "She jumped up, and I {{thought she}} was going away; but she did not go, and <b>turned</b> again <b>toward</b> <b>me,</b> and remarked, just as coolly as anybody could speak: 'Well, I do not wonder, either. Your Bernard is a most estimable man, and if nothing should happen in any way or at any time to {{interfere}} in the case of his surviving you I shall be happy to marry him. I think I would make him a very good wife.' ...|$|R
60|$|Without {{waiting to}} note the outcome of his plea, he <b>turned</b> and bounded <b>toward</b> <b>me.</b> From every cage that harboured red men a thunderous shout went up in answer to his exhortation. The inner guards went down beneath howling mobs, and the cages vomited forth their inmates hot with the lust to kill.|$|R
