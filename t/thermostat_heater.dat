40|$|A new TI wall system {{combining}} {{the advantages of}} transparent and opaque insulation for buildings is being investigated. This concept uses free air convection within vertical gaps between the TIM, the opaque insulation material, and the building wall for heat transfer. Overheating during high solar irradiation periods can be avoided by opening a shutter and directing the hot air stream out of the facade. A 5. 9 mhigh 2 TI facade of this type was constructed on a test building at the ISE test site in Freiburg. The building is equipped with an electrical <b>thermostat</b> <b>heater</b> to keep the room temperature constant. Solar irradiation, wall heat fluxes and temperatures are measured. Special points of interest are the heat transfer coefficients due to free convection, and the protection against overheating...|$|E

5|$|A {{wind energy}} {{penetration}} figure {{can be specified}} for different duration of time, but is often quoted annually. To obtain 100% from wind annually requires substantial long term storage or substantial interconnection to other systems which may already have substantial storage.

Seasonal industry might then take advantage of high wind and low usage times such as at night when wind output can exceed normal demand. Such industry might include production of silicon, aluminum, steel, or of natural gas, and hydrogen, and using future long term storage to facilitate 100% energy from variable renewable energy.

For the typical two-person household, 760 lbs per month can be saved by employing such near-term measures as reducing monthly miles traveled (by auto and aircraft) and altering behaviors related to appliance energy consumption (e. g., employing a smart <b>thermostat,</b> reducing water <b>heater</b> temperature settings, and eliminating phantom loads).

5000|$|The third lunar landing {{expedition}} Apollo 13 in April 1970, was aborted and {{the lives}} of the crew, James Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise, were threatened by failure of a cryogenic liquid oxygen tank en route to the Moon. The tank burst when electrical power was applied to internal stirring fans in the tank, causing the immediate loss of all of its contents, and also damaging the second tank, causing the loss of its remaining oxygen in a span of 130 minutes. This in turn caused loss of electrical power provided by fuel cells to the command spacecraft. The crew managed to return to Earth safely by using the lunar landing craft as a [...] "life boat". The tank failure was determined to be caused by two mistakes. The tank's drain fitting had been damaged when it was dropped during factory testing. This necessitated use of its internal heaters to boil out the oxygen after a pre-launch test, which in turn damaged the fan wiring's electrical insulation, because the <b>thermostats</b> on the <b>heaters</b> did not meet the required voltage rating due to a vendor miscommunication.|$|R
50|$|The defrost {{mechanism}} in a refrigerator heats the cooling element (evaporator coil) {{for a short}} period of time and melts the frost that has formed on it. The resulting water drains through a duct at the back of the unit. Defrosting is controlled by an electric or electronic timer: For every 6, 8, 10, 12 or 24 hours of compressor operation it turns on a defrost heater for 15 minutes to half an hour. The defrost heater, having a typical power rating of 350 W to 600 W, is mounted just below the evaporator in top- and bottom-freezer models and below and sometimes also in the middle of the evaporator in side-by-side models. It may be protected from short circuits by means of fusible links. In older refrigerators the timer ran continuously. In newer designs the timer only runs while the compressor runs, so the more the refrigerator door is closed, the less the heater will be on and the more energy will be saved. A defrost <b>thermostat</b> opens the <b>heater</b> circuit when the evaporator temperature rises above a preset temperature, 40°F (5°C) or more, thereby preventing excessive heating of the freezer compartment. The defrost timer is such that either the compressor or the defrost heater is on, but not both at the same time.|$|R
40|$|A {{prospective}} {{study was designed}} to evaluate a mass media injury prevention program reaching two million people to determine its impact on risk awareness of hot tap water burns and injury-prevention behavior. Liquid-crystal thermometers for testing hot water temperature were offered at no cost; 140, 000 were requested. Pre- and post-program general population random surveys (N = 337 and 318, respectively) found increased awareness of the danger of hot tap water, from 72 per cent to 89 per cent, but no increase in testing or lowering of water heater temperatures. A third random sample survey (N = 325) among thermometer requesters found a higher rate of testing (difference 58. 1 per cent, 95 per cent CL 55. 3 per cent, 60. 9 per cent) than in the general population. Of those who tested, 43 per cent reported temperatures in the dangerous range of 54. 4 degrees C (130 degrees F) or greater; 52 per cent of this group lowered their water <b>heater</b> <b>thermostat.</b> These findings indicate that: more than 25 per cent of the public is unaware of the potential danger of hot tap water; a safety education program which increases awareness will not necessarily result in injury-control behavior; and most people motivated to request a free thermometer will test their hot water temperature and lower it if necessary.

40|$|The {{advent of}} very small satellites, such as nano and microsatellites, logically {{leads to a}} {{requirement}} for smaller thermal control subsystems. In addition, the thermal control needs of the smaller spacecraft/instrument may well be different from more traditional situations. For example, power for traditional heaters may be very limited or unavailable, mass allocations may be severely limited, and fleets of nano/microsatellites will require a generic thermal design {{as the cost of}} unique designs will be prohibitive. Some applications may require significantly increased power levels while others may require extremely low heat loss for extended periods. Small spacecraft will have low thermal capacitance thus subjecting them to large temperature swings when either the heat generation rate changes or the thermal sink temperature changes. This situation, combined with the need for tighter temperature control, will present a challenging situation during transient operation. The use of "off-the-shelf" commercial spacecraft buses for science instruments will also present challenges. Older thermal technology, such as <b>heaters,</b> <b>thermostats,</b> and heat pipes, will almost certainly not be sufficient to meet the requirements of these new spacecraft/instruments. They are generally too heavy, not scalable to very small sizes, and may consume inordinate amounts of power. Hence there is a strong driver to develop new technology to meet these emerging needs. Variable emittance coatings offer an exciting alternative to traditional control methodologies and are one of the technologies that will be flown on Space Technology 5, a mission of three microsatellites designed to validate "enabling" technologies. Several studies have identified variable emittance coatings as applicable {{to a wide range of}} spacecraft, and to potentially offer substantial savings in mass and/or power over traditional approaches. This paper discusses the development of the variable emittance thermal suite for ST- 5. More specifically, it provides a description of and the infusion and validation plans for the variable emittance coatings...|$|R
40|$|The {{scientific}} understanding of key physical processes between the Sun and the Earth require simultaneous measurements from many vantage points in space. Nano-satellite technologies will enable {{a class of}} constellation missions for the NASA Space Science Sun-Earth Connections. This recent emphasis on the implementation of smaller satellites leads to a requirement for development of smaller subsystems in several areas. Key technologies under development include: advanced miniaturized chemical propulsion; miniaturized sensors; highly integrated, compact electronics; autonomous onboard and ground operations; miniatures low power tracking techniques for orbit determination; onboard RF communications capable of transmitting data to the ground from far distances; lightweight efficient solar array panels; lightweight, high output battery cells; lightweight yet strong composite materials for the nano-spacecraft and deployer-ship structures. These newer smaller systems may have higher power densities and higher thermal transport requirements than seen on previous small satellites. Furthermore, the small satellites may also have a requirement to maintain thermal control through extended earth shadows, possibly up to 8 hours long. Older thermal control technology, such as <b>heaters,</b> <b>thermostats,</b> and heat pipes, may {{not be sufficient to}} meet the requirements of these new systems. Conversely, a miniature two-phase heat transport system (Mini-HTS) such as a Capillary Pumped Loop (CPL) or Loop Heat Pipe (LBP) is a viable alternative. A Mini-HTS can provide fine temperature control, thermal diode action, and a highly efficient means of heat transfer. The Mini-HTS would have power capabilities in the range of tens of watts or less and provide thermal control over typical spacecraft ranges. The Mini-HTS would allow the internal portion of the spacecraft to be thermally isolated from the external radiator, thus protecting the internal components from extreme cold temperatures during an eclipse. The Mini-HTS would transport the beat from these components to a radiator during their operational modes, and it would be shutdown during non-operational or eclipse modes. Shutdown of the Mini-HTS would be accomplished with small heaters and has been successfully demonstrated on numerous occasions, both in the lab and on flight experiments. Efforts are now underway to miniaturize two-phase heat transport systems for the Nanosatellite project, with potential application to other small satellite programs. 'ne goal of this project is to design, build, and test miniature heat transport systems (MHTS) that would demonstrate the feasibility of a small Capillary Pumped Loop (CPL) or Loop Heat Pipe (LBP) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Each {{year in the}} UK 2000 {{children}} attend emergency departments and 500 are admitted to hospital following a bath water scald. The long term effects can include disability, disfigurement or psychological harm and repeated skin grafts may be required as the child grows. The costs of treating a severe scald are estimated at 250, 000 GBP. Children living in the most deprived wards are at greatest risk of thermal injuries; hospital admission rates are three times that for children living in the least deprived wards. Domestic hot water, which is usually stored at around 60 degrees Celsius, {{can result in a}} second-degree burn after 3 seconds and a third-degree burn after 5 seconds. Educational strategies to encourage testing of tap water temperature and reduction of hot water thermostat settings have largely proved unsuccessful. Legislation in the USA mandating pre-setting hot water <b>heater</b> <b>thermostats</b> at 49 degrees Celsius was effective in reducing scald injuries, suggesting passive measures may have a greater impact. Thermostatic mixer valves (TMVs), recently developed for the domestic market, fitted across the hot and cold water supply pipes of the bath, allow delivery of water set at a fixed temperature from the hot bath tap. These valves therefore offer the potential to reduce scald injuries. Design/Methods A pragmatic, randomised controlled trial to assess the effectiveness of TMVs in reducing bath hot tap water temperatures in the homes of families with young children in rented social housing. Two parallel arms include an intervention group and a control group where the intervention will be deferred. The intervention will consist of fitting a TMV (set at 44 degrees Celsius) by a qualified plumber and provision of educational materials. The control arm will not receive a TMV or the educational materials for the study duration but will be offered the intervention after collection of follow-up data 12 months post randomisation. The primary outcome measure will be the bath hot tap water temperature. Fifteen families per arm are required to detect a reduction in the mean bath hot tap water temperature from 60. 4 degrees Celsius (SD 9. 1) in the control group to 46 degrees Celsius in the intervention group, with 90 % power and a 5 % significance level (2 sided). Secondary outcome measures including acceptability will require a sample size of 120 participants. Discussion Whilst TMVs have the potential to reduce scald injuries, to date there have been no randomised controlled trials assessing their effectiveness, acceptability and cost effectiveness.
