5|$|The wood of B.integrifolia is pink to red, with {{inconspicuous}} {{rings and}} conspicuous rays. It is spongy and porous, with a density of around 530 kilograms per cubic metre (33lb/ft3). It is considered highly decorative, but it warps badly on drying, has poor load-bearing qualities, and {{is susceptible to}} termite attack; it is therefore unsuitable for most construction purposes. It is sometimes used for cabinet panelling and in ornamental <b>turnery,</b> and natural bends were once sought after for making boat knees. It is a useful firewood.|$|E
5|$|Silver birch wood is pale in colour with no {{distinct}} heartwood {{and is used}} {{in making}} furniture, plywood, veneers, parquet blocks, skis, kitchen utensils and in <b>turnery.</b> It makes a good firewood that produces a good heat when burnt but is quickly consumed by the flames. Slabs of bark are used for making roof shingles and wooden footwear. Historically, the bark was used for tanning. Bark can be heated and the resin collected; the resin is an excellent waterproof glue and useful for starting fires. The thin sheets of bark that peel off young wood contain a waxy resin and are easy to ignite even when wet. The dead twigs are also useful as kindling for outdoor fires.|$|E
5000|$|The {{company was}} started in the mid-19th century by Wilhelm Gerlach, one of the heirs of the Gerlach family of entrepreneurs, owners of - among others - the largest cutlery factory in Poland. By 1886 the small {{workshop}} at Srebrna Street in Warsaw was inherited by Wilhelm's son, Maksymilian Gerlach. In 1897 the factory {{was turned into a}} joint company owned by Gerlach and a new associate, Edward Pulst, who became the factory's chief engineer and technical director. In the following year, the factory was renamed to Spółka Akcyjna Fabryki Maszyn [...] "Gerlach i Pulst" [...] - [...] "Gerlach and Pulst" [...] Joint Stock Machinery Factory. In 1900 the company was moved to new premises at Dworska 2 Street in Warsaw. The [...] "Gerlach i Pulst" [...] produced machine tools, <b>turneries,</b> planers, drilling machines, presses, saws and many other types of machinery, used notably in small arms production.

Following the start of the Great War, in 1915 most of company's assets were dismantled by the retreating Russians and sent by rail to other parts of Russia.|$|R

6000|$|This washhandstand {{had been}} made of deal by some one with an excess of <b>turnery</b> {{appliances}} in a hurry, who had tried to distract attention from the rough economies of his workmanship by an arresting ornamentation of blobs and bulbs upon the joints and legs. Apparently the piece had then been placed in the hands of some person of infinite leisure equipped with a pot of ocherous paint, varnish, and a set of flexible combs. This person had first painted the article, then, I fancy, smeared it with varnish, and then sat down to work with the combs to streak and comb the varnish into a weird imitation of the grain of some nightmare timber. The washhandstand so made had evidently had a prolonged career of violent use, had been chipped, kicked, splintered, punched, stained, scorched, hammered, dessicated, damped, and defiled, had met indeed with almost every possible adventure except a conflagration or a scrubbing, until at last it had come to this high refuge of Parload's attic to sustain the simple requirements of Parload's personal cleanliness. There were, in chief, a basin and a jug of water and a slop-pail of tin, and, further, a piece of yellow soap in a tray, a tooth-brush, a rat-tailed shaving brush, one huckaback towel, and one or two other minor articles. In those days only very prosperous people had more than such an equipage, and it is to be remarked that every drop of water Parload used had to be carried by an unfortunate servant girl,--the [...] "slavey," [...] Parload called her--up from the basement {{to the top of the}} house and subsequently down again. Already we begin to forget how modern an invention is personal cleanliness. It is a fact that Parload had never stripped for a swim in his life; never had a simultaneous bath all over his body since his childhood. Not one in fifty of us did in the days of which I am telling you.|$|E
