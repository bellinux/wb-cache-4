5|$|After the meal, Starling {{tries to}} attack Lecter, but he overpowers her. She {{handcuffs}} his wrist <b>to</b> <b>hers.</b> Hearing the police closing in, Lecter threatens to sever her cuffed hand to escape. Lecter is later {{seen on a}} flight with his own boxed lunch, his arm in a sling. As he prepares to eat his meal, including what {{is assumed to be}} part of a cooked brain, a young boy seated next to him asks to try some of his food. Initially reluctant, Lecter then assents.|$|E
5|$|On 7 June 1944, Elliot married Donald James Graham Gowing at the Wimbledon Registry Office. He was a vocalist who {{had also}} {{attended}} Christ's Hospital before winning a choral scholarship to Kings College, Cambridge, in 1939. He had joined the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in 1941, and was serving at Combined Operations Headquarters. They married shortly before he was shipped overseas. He was taught Japanese in the United States and went on serve in the Pacific as a translator. The marriage bar was suspended for the duration and Gowing was allowed {{to remain in the}} Civil Service. They had two children, both sons: Nicholas Keith (Nik), a journalist who was born in 1951 and named after Hancock, and James, born in 1954. Her husband, frustrated by his lack of professional success compared <b>to</b> <b>hers,</b> became an alcoholic, and died from a massive stroke in 1969.|$|E
5|$|Spanish teacher Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison) {{learns that}} Sandy Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky), {{the head of}} William McKinley High School's glee club has been fired for {{inappropriate}} sexual behavior toward student Hank Saunders (Ben Bledsoe). The school principal, Figgins (Iqbal Theba), gives Will permission {{to take over the}} club, and he plans to revitalize it, naming the group New Directions. The club consists of fame-hungry Rachel Berry (Lea Michele), diva Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley), flamboyant countertenor Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer), paraplegic electric guitar player Artie Abrams (Kevin McHale) and stuttering goth Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz). Will's efforts are derided by Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), head of the school's successful cheerleading team, the Cheerios, who soon plans to abolish the Glee club to restore her money funded towards the spoiled Cheerios. His wife Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig) is also unsupportive, suggesting that Will become an accountant to increase their income and give up teaching. Rachel threatens to leave the club if Will cannot find a male vocalist with talent comparable <b>to</b> <b>hers.</b> When the school's football coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher) allows Will to try to recruit football team members, in return that he put a good word for Emma for him (because Ken likes her), he discovers that quarterback Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) is secretly a talented singer. He plants marijuana in Finn's locker, and blackmails him into joining New Directions. Finn, determined not to disappoint his widowed mother, complies.|$|E

25|$|Juliana died in {{her sleep}} on 20 March 2004, several weeks before her 95th birthday, at Soestdijk Palace in Baarn from {{complications}} of pneumonia, seventy {{years to the day}} after her grandmother, Queen Emma. She was embalmed, unlike her mother Wilhelmina, who chose not to be, and on 30 March 2004 interred beside her mother in the royal vaults under the Nieuwe Kerk in Delft. The memorial service made her ecumenical and often highly personal views on matters of religion public. The late Princess, a vicar said in her sermon, was interested in all religions and in reincarnation. Juliana's husband Prince Bernhard died eight months later aged 93, on 1 December 2004; his remains were placed next <b>to</b> <b>hers.</b>|$|E
25|$|Not {{only have}} {{employees}} {{lost their jobs}} in the United States, but it has happened with social network users internationally. In April 2011, a Lloyd's banking group employee in the United Kingdom was fired for making a sarcastic post about the higher salary of her boss in relation <b>to</b> <b>hers.</b> In February 2013 there was another case where a flight attendant working for a Russian airline lost her job because she posted a photo of herself giving the middle finger to a plane full of passengers. The photo went viral exposing {{it all over the}} Internet. In November 2009, a woman working for IBM in Quebec, Canada, lost her company's health insurance benefits because she posted photos displaying her mental health problem. The company decided to cut her benefits because it was costing them additional funds.|$|E

25|$|A Polish {{marriage}} certificate lists three fields, the surnames for the husband, wife, and children. The partners {{may choose to}} retain their surnames, or both adopt the surname of either partner, {{or a combination of}} both; the children must receive either the joint surname or the surname of one of the partners. However, a married woman usually adopts her husband's name and the children usually bear the surname of the father. The wife may keep her maiden name (nazwisko panieńskie) or add her husband's surname <b>to</b> <b>hers,</b> thus creating a double-barrelled name (nazwisko złożone). However, if she already has a double-barrelled name, she must leave one of the parts out—it is illegal to use a triple- or more-barrelled name. It is also possible, though rare, for the husband to adopt his wife's surname or to add his wife's surname to his family name (an example is businessman Zygmunt Solorz-Żak, who did both, taking his wife's name on his first marriage, and later appending his second wife's name to it).|$|E
25|$|Kyo is {{the heir}} to the Tengu Clan. It is {{revealed}} that Kyo is not human but a powerful demon. When he is in his demon form, his hair grown longer, has black wings, and wears a mask that looks like a crow's beak. Perverted and cocky to many, but he treats Misao with a combination of kindness and coldness depending on his mood. Kyo met Misao during their childhood; they quickly developed a strong bond and {{he fell in love with}} her. They also made a promise that she would be his bride, which he is determined to fulfill. His older brother, Sho, was supposed to be clan leader, but Kyo surpassed him for Misao's sake (as only a clan leader may seek her as their bride). In order to stay close to Misao, he moved back to his house next door <b>to</b> <b>hers</b> and took a job as a math teacher at her school. He is always protecting her and healing her wounds, also finding moments to steal a kiss. While he cares deeply for Misao, Kyo has deep attachments to those close to him: such that he took Taro under his wings to train him and make him stronger after Taro was abused by Shou. Kyo has deep disdain towards his brother (for his abusive ways) and his father (whom he suspected of murdering his mother). After Sho's death, Kyo learns that Misao is pregnant with his child, a powerful demon child. He is initially happy of the news, but when he learns that the children of the Immortal Fruit will feed on their mothers after childbirth, he wants her to abort the pregnancy but she refuses. When Misao tells him that she loves the baby and it loves her, he comes to care for the baby. Misao gives birth to a boy, whom they name Sou. Misao, by miracle, survives and Kyo is able to live happily with her and Sou.|$|E

500|$|As [...] "a male {{favourite}} to {{a virgin}} queen", Robert Dudley {{found himself in}} an unprecedented situation. His apartments at court were next <b>to</b> <b>hers,</b> and—perceived as knowing [...] "the Queen and her nature best of any man"—his influence was matched by few. Another side of such privileges was Elizabeth's possessiveness and jealousy. His company was essential for her well-being and for many years he was hardly allowed to leave. Sir Christopher Hatton reported a growing emergency when the Earl was away {{for a few weeks}} in 1578: [...] "This court wanteth your presence. Her majesty is unaccompanied and, I assure you, the chambers are almost empty." ...|$|E

500|$|For {{the only}} time in this series, Angelou {{describes}} her son's accident in detail at both the end of this book and the beginning of her next one, All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes, a technique that centralizes the two books, connects them with each other, creates a strong, emotional link between them, and repeats Angelou's pattern of ending each book on a positive note. In this book, Angelou ends with a hopeful look to the future as her son attains his independence and she looks forward <b>to</b> <b>hers.</b> Hagen writes, [...] "Faithful to the ongoing themes of survival, sense of self, and continuing education, The Heart of a Woman moves its central figures to a point of full personhood." ...|$|E
500|$|Veronica tracks down Amelia's cousin, Margot Schnell. On the {{way back}} to the Echolls estate, Don Lamb and Logan see that Logan's house is burning. Veronica fakes being a distressed businesswoman in order to track the car that Amelia rented, which was in California about two days prior. Sheriff Lamb tells Keith about Veronica being taken in for questioning. Veronica tracks Amelia's {{previous}} location, which is in a small hotel. Keith confronts Veronica and Veronica tells him about David [...] "Curly" [...] Moran. Veronica notices that the signal from one of Amelia's devices is close <b>to</b> <b>hers</b> before finding Amelia dead in an ice box. Clarence Wiedman suddenly appears and says that Amelia showed up again before disappearing later. The man up front at the hotel tells Clarence and Veronica that she came in with a man, and Veronica says she knows who it is.|$|E
500|$|Hangingflies (Bittacidae) {{provide a}} nuptial meal {{in the form}} of a {{captured}} insect prey, such as a caterpillar, bug, or fly. The male attracts a female with a pheromone from vesicles on his abdomen; he retracts these once a female is nearby, and presents her with the prey. While she evaluates the gift, he locates her genitalia with his. If she stays to eat the prey, his genitalia attach <b>to</b> <b>hers,</b> and the female lowers herself into an upside-down hanging position, and eats the prey while mating. Larger prey result in longer mating times. In Hylobittacus apicalis, prey [...] long give between 1 and 17 minutes of mating. Larger males of that species give prey as big as houseflies, earning up to 29 minutes of mating, maximal sperm transfer, more oviposition, and a refractory period during which the female does not mate with other males: all of these increase the number of offspring the male is likely to have.|$|E

500|$|In July 1904 the New York Times {{obtained}} {{a copy of}} the Quimby manuscript from Sally Wentworth's son, and juxtaposed passages with Science and Health to highlight the similarities. It also published Eddy's handwritten notes on Quimby's manuscript to show what the newspaper alleged was the transition from his words <b>to</b> <b>hers.</b> Quimby's manuscripts were published in 1921. Eddy's biographers continued to disagree about his influence on Eddy. Bates and Dittemore, the latter {{a former director of the}} Christian Science church, argued in 1932 that [...] "as far as the thought is concerned, Science and Health is practically all Quimby," [...] except for malicious animal mesmerism. Robert Peel, who also worked for the church, wrote in 1966 that Eddy may have influenced Quimby as much as he influenced her. Gardner argued in 1993 that Eddy had taken [...] "huge chunks" [...] from Quimby, and Gill in 1998 that there were only general similarities.|$|E
500|$|Bearing his grief, {{and leaving}} Sarah <b>to</b> <b>hers,</b> the Duke {{returned}} to The Hague {{at the beginning}} of March. By now Marshal Villeroi had replaced Boufflers as commander in the Spanish Netherlands, but although Marlborough was able to take Bonn, Huy, and Limbourg in 1703, the [...] "Great Design" [...] – the Anglo-Dutch plan to secure Antwerp and thereby open the river lines into Flanders and Brabant – was left in ruins by Villeroi's initiative, poor Allied co-ordination, and by General Obdam's defeat at the Battle of Eckeren on 30 June. Domestically the Duke also encountered problems. The moderate Tory ministry of Marlborough, the Lord Treasurer Godolphin, and the Speaker of the House of Commons Robert Harley, were hampered by, and often at variance with, their High Tory colleagues whose strategic policy favoured the full employment of the Royal Navy in pursuit of trade advantages and colonial expansion overseas. To the Tories an action at sea was preferable to one ashore: rather than attack the enemy where they were strongest the Tories proposed to attack Louis XIV and Philip V where they were weakest – in their colonial empires and on the high seas. In contrast the Whigs, led by their Junto, enthusiastically supported the Ministry's Continental strategy of thrusting the army into the heart of France. This support wilted somewhat following the Allies' recent campaign, but the Duke, whose diplomatic tact had held together a very discordant Grand Alliance, was now a general of international repute, and the limited success of 1703 was soon eclipsed by the Blenheim campaign.|$|E
