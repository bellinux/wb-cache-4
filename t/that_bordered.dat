5|$|Johnson {{explored}} {{the theme of}} escapism at the Indianapolis Museum of Contemporary Art in a show entitled The Production of Escapism: A Solo Project by Rashid Johnson. He addressed distraction and relief from reality through art and fantasy. Johnson used photos, video and site-specific installation to study escapist tendencies through often {{with a sense of}} humor <b>that</b> <b>bordered</b> on the absurd.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union {{sought to}} {{dominate}} {{the internal affairs of}} countries <b>that</b> <b>bordered</b> it. During the war, Stalin had created special training centers for communists from different countries so that they could set up secret police forces loyal to Moscow as soon as the Red Army took control. Soviet agents took control of the media, especially radio; they quickly harassed and then banned all independent civic institutions, from youth groups to schools, churches and rival political parties. Stalin also sought continued peace with Britain and the United States, hoping to focus on internal reconstruction and economic growth.|$|E
5|$|Jogaila {{created a}} {{significant}} new {{alliance with the}} Kingdom of Poland when he secured an agreement, known as the Union of Krewo (August 1385), to marry the twelve-year-old King of Poland Jadwiga of Poland. He married Jadwiga and was crowned jure uxoris king of Poland in February 1386. As a condition to the marriage and coronation, Jogaila agreed to renounce paganism himself and Christianize his subjects, and establish a personal union between Poland and Lithuania. The Union was an unwelcome development for the Teutonic Knights, as it united Poland and Lithuania, two states hostile to the Order, and a Christianized Lithuania deprived the Knights of their ideological justification for waging the Lithuanian Crusade. Thus the Order sought opportunities to undo the Polish–Lithuanian union; they demanded Samogitia, a section of western Lithuania <b>that</b> <b>bordered</b> the Baltic Sea, and refused to recognize Jogaila's baptism in 1386.|$|E

5|$|Pedro's {{character}} {{was marked by}} an energetic drive <b>that</b> <b>bordered</b> on hyperactivity. He was impetuous with {{a tendency to be}} domineering and short-tempered. Easily bored or distracted, in his personal life he entertained himself with dalliances with women in addition to his hunting and equestrian activities. His restless spirit compelled him to search for adventure, and, sometimes in disguise as a traveler, he frequented taverns in Rio de Janeiro's disreputable districts. He rarely drank alcohol, but was an incorrigible womanizer. His earliest known lasting affair was with a French dancer called Noémi Thierry, who had a stillborn child by him. Pedro's father, who had ascended the throne as JoãoVI, sent Thierry away to avoid jeopardizing the prince's betrothal to Archduchess Maria Leopoldina, daughter of Emperor FranzI of Austria (formerly FranzII, Holy Roman Emperor).|$|E
5|$|Castelli also {{abolished}} the mita in Upper Peru, a mandatory form {{of public service}} <b>that</b> <b>bordered</b> on slavery. Mariano Moreno has also wished to end the mita, but Moreno had resigned from the Junta by this point. Without Castelli being in Buenos Aires to mediate between them, the disputes between Moreno and Saavedra had worsened. The Junta requested that Castelli should moderate his actions, but he went ahead with the positions he shared with Moreno. Several Saavedrist officers, such as José María Echaurri, José León Domínguez, Matías Balbastro, chaplain Manuel Antonio Azcurra, and sergeant major Toribio de Luzuriaga, planned to kidnap Castelli, deliver him to Buenos Aires for trial, and give command of the Army of the North to Juan Jose Viamonte. However, Viamonte did not accept the plan when he was informed by the conspirators, and {{did not attempt to}} carry it out. When Castelli knew about Moreno's resignation, he wrote a letter to Vieytes, Rodriguez Peña, Larrea, and Azcuénaga, asking them to move to Upper Peru. If they defeated Goyeneche, they planned to march back to Buenos Aires. However, the letter was sent via the common postal service, and the postmaster of Córdoba, Jose de Paz, decided to send it instead to Cornelio Saavedra. The Morenist members of the Junta had already been ousted and exiled by that point.|$|E

25|$|The two rivers <b>that</b> <b>bordered</b> the {{settlement}} on its initial construction were both problematic. The Ikuta River {{to the east}} had low banks and frequently flooded {{the settlement}}, while the Koi River to the west was hated as an obstruction to traffic.|$|E
25|$|There {{was some}} local {{controversy}} about the changes.

But we've always {{had a lot of}} people in the band so that's why I call the band the 'Large Band' and not the 'Big Band'. But invariably people refer to the band as the 'Big Band' and ... it's not big... you get the idea." ...|$|R
25|$|The ammonites {{that form}} ammolite {{inhabited}} a prehistoric, inland subtropical sea <b>that</b> <b>bordered</b> the Rocky Mountains—this area is {{known today as}} the Cretaceous or Western Interior Seaway. As the ammonites died, they sank {{to the bottom and}} were buried by layers of bentonitic mud that eventually became shale. Many gem-quality ammonites are found within siderite concretions. These sediments preserved the aragonite of the shells, preventing it from converting to calcite.|$|E
25|$|The band enjoyed {{popularity}} with a style <b>that</b> <b>bordered</b> on parody {{but managed to}} combine novelty retro kitsch and clever theatrics with {{a keen sense of}} pop dynamics and an acute understanding of rock 'n' roll. The band scored five top 20 hits on the Australian Kent Music Report singles chart and their debut album, Take It Greasy peaked at No.3 on the Australian albums chart in 1976. After line-up changes, Ol' 55 disbanded in 1983.|$|E

Unarmed warders, Wallis, Mitchinson and Paterson, came {{running out of the}} prison's main gate and onto the street.|$|E

25|$|Her {{funeral was}} held in Niagara Falls on October 29, 1980. She had six female pallbearers including: Edith Druggan and Florence Rosberg, of Niagara Falls, {{broadcaster}} Barbara Frum, British Columbia Judge Nancy Morrison, lawyer Pamela Verill Walker, and Doris Anderson, president of the Canadian Advisory Council on the Status of Women. It was a short service, attended by 300 friends and dignitaries including Ontario's premier William Davis, former Ontario Lieutenant-Governor Pauline McGibbon, and several federal politicians including the man she backed for federal Liberal leader in 1968, Paul Hellyer. She was laid to rest next to her parents, at a graveyard <b>that</b> <b>bordered</b> the historic Canadian battleground, Lundy's Lane.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1910s, however, {{predominantly}} white areas of St. Louis <b>that</b> <b>bordered</b> {{the black community}} formed the United Welfare Association (UWA), a group dedicated to lobbying for a segregation ordinance. Although the municipal government rejected the group's petitions, the UWA succeeded in gathering enough signatures for a direct initiative election on the ordinance in February 1916. The NAACP in St. Louis opposed the law by distributing pamphlets arguing that the ordinance was un-American and by filing a lawsuit against it that ultimately failed. 23 of 28 aldermen and Mayor Henry Kiel publicly opposed the ordinance, while both major dailies (theSt. Louis Post-Dispatch and the St. Louis Globe-Democrat) wrote editorials against it.|$|E

25|$|Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863 was a {{powerful}} action that promised freedom for slaves in the Confederacy {{as soon as the}} Union armies reached them, and authorized the enlistment of African Americans in the Union Army. The Emancipation Proclamation did not free slaves in the Union-allied slave-holding states <b>that</b> <b>bordered</b> the Confederacy. Since the Confederate States did not recognize the authority of President Lincoln, and the proclamation did not apply in the border states, at first the proclamation freed only those slaves who had escaped behind Union lines. The proclamation made the abolition of slavery an official war goal that was implemented as the Union took territory from the Confederacy. According to the Census of 1860, this policy would free nearly four million slaves, or over 12% of the total population of the United States.|$|E
25|$|Until 2001 the Italian state offered {{citizens}} {{living abroad}} a free return train journey {{to their home}} town in Italy in order to vote, however {{the portion of the}} train journey that was free of charge was only on Italian soil. Any costs incurred in getting from their place of residence abroad to the Italian border had to be covered by the citizen wanting to vote, therefore a free return train journey was hardly an incentive for the large Italian communities living as far away as in the United States, Argentina or Australia. For this reason very few Italians abroad made use of this right to vote, unless they lived in cities and towns <b>that</b> <b>bordered</b> to Italy such as in Germany, Switzerland, France and Austria. Various Italian minorities living abroad (notably in the United States) protested frequently at this lack of political representation especially if they paid taxes on property owned in Italy.|$|E
25|$|At 7:18p.m. ADT, {{the first}} 9-1-1 call {{was made to}} police about an armed man walking down a {{sidewalk}} on Pioneer Avenue and towards the woods west of the street. Twelve RCMP officers responded to the scene {{and set up a}} perimeter around the woods and the surrounding neighbourhood. Bourque was first seen by Cst. Mathieu Daigle stepping out of the forest, crossing a street, and entering another wooded area <b>that</b> <b>bordered</b> the backyards of several houses. Daigle sent out a radio transmission describing Bourque, but some radio static was heard, which made the description difficult to understand. Daigle was then joined by Csts. Fabrice Gevaudan and Rob Nickerson as they trailed Bourque, who was headed toward a house on Bromfield Court, where five other officers were positioned. All of the officers were intending on maintaining visual contact on him while waiting for the arrival of Police Dog Services, who were scheduled to arrive in a few minutes.|$|E
