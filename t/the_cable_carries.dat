Three cable ships-CS Mercury, CS Retriever, and HMTS Monarch-did the job.

40|$|The cable-in-conduit superconductors for the ITER coils have {{operating}} current {{in excess of}} 40 kA and function under last ramp conditions and fields up to 13 T. The transverse Lorentz force acting on strands may reduce the effective contact resistance between strands in the cable and as a consequence, the coupling loss will increase. This influence is investigated with a sub-size jacketed cable having 81 Cr-coated Nb 3 Sn strands. The AC loss is measured with a sinusoidal and trapezoidal magnetic field superimposed to a stationary background field of 1 or 2 T while <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> <b>carries</b> a constant transport current up to about 30 kA. The AC loss is determined by a pick-up coil system and partly with a calorimeter for calibration purposes. The nτ at 0 current declines after cyclic loading, from 9 ms in the virgin state to 2 ms after several loads. The increase of the interstrand coupling loss due to Lorentz effects, accompanied by resistance-hysteresis and relaxation effects as observed in the loss are discussed. The total loss increases considerably due to interference of transport current and induced coupling currents with rising transport current and DC field...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{intrinsic}} {{properties of the}} polymeric high voltage (HV) direct current (DC) cable insulation is the accumulation of electrostatic charges. Accumulated charges distort the initial Laplacian distribution of the electric field, leading to a local field enhancement that may cause insulation degradation and premature breakdown of the system. The general objective {{of the present study}} is to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} major factors that control the space charge processes in polymeric HVDC cable systems. In order to achieve this goal, two main factors of influence have been investigated. 1) Cable accessories, i. e. cable joints and cable terminations, are considered to be the weakest part of a cable system, because of the presence of a dielectric interface between the cable insulation and that of the accessory. This thesis aims at a better knowledge of the polarization phenomena occurring at dielectric interfaces. To that purpose, an accurate methodology has been developed for the experimental study of the space charge behavior at the dielectric interface. The pulsed electro-acoustic (PEA) method for the measurement of space charge has been reviewed in case of dielectric interfaces. Secondly, space charge accumulation has been experimentally observed at the dielectric interfaces of different test specimens. 2) Across the insulation of HVDC cable systems a temperature drop is present when <b>the</b> <b>cable</b> <b>carries</b> a current. This thesis aims to provide a better understanding about the mechanisms responsible for space charge accumulation when a temperature drop is present across the insulation of the cable system. To that purpose, a physical model has been developed for the prediction of space charge dynamics and electric field in loaded HVDC cable systems. The physical model has been validated by means of laboratory investigation. Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|E
