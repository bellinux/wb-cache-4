A new way to implement system on a chip is provided by the advent of FPGA. Based on Verilog HDL and the Actel Fusion AFS 600 FPGA chip, the speed closed-loop control system of DC motor was designed by using options of combining the <b>top-down</b> <b>thinking</b> and the bottom-up method. PID control algorithm, encoder signal processing and PWM waveform generation etc were realized by the system. The results show that the system structure is simplified and the stability and reliability are improved. A solution of system on a chip is realized to some extent. It has extensive application value in engineering practice...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDeeper {{excavation}} of {{relevance of data}} and a <b>top-down</b> <b>thinking</b> to take apart financial data into blocks for more efficient analysis are essential for the big data, {{as well as to}} eliminate data noise and to remove data redundancy in the process 1. The financial data classification standard, which always performs excellently in these aspects, is an essential premise for data mining and analysis in the big data 2. To find a method to form the classification standard framework that can meet diverse purposes is very important. This research proposes a way to form the framework of financial data classification standard based on uniform classification standard and relative books, improved by comparing with classification standard of existed financial database and verified by practice with financial data sources. This framework can adapt to trends in the era of the big data and improve data storage mode...|$|E

"The use of social media as an election campaign tool has developed dramatically in recent years. In Taiwan, the use of Facebook has also begun to {{play a significant role}} in political communication. This study explores the use of Facebook as an election campaign tool in Taiwan's 2012 presidential election, and candidates' perceptions of its role. Previous researchers have given much attention to the audience due to the characteristics of Web 2. 0 but the roles of candidates and the development of strategies were rarely discussed. This project is the first study that seeks to uncover the compromises candidates make in order to maximise the political benefits of social media in Taiwan. The project draws on the methodological orientation of framing theory and employs in-depth interviews and content analysis to examine the phenomenon of framing. The results show that the main activity candidates adopt on Facebook is self-disclosure. This is similar to normal users but with a highly strategic intention. Habermasian communicative action theory is modified to examine candidates' self-disclosure. The Shifting Integrated Marketing Communication (IMC) model and the Strategic Network Campaigning (SNC) model have been developed during the process of investigation. The candidates' images on their Facebook pages require various techniques and resources to cultivate and the Shifting IMC model serves this need. The adoption of the SNC approach results in candidates (or 'brands') employing surrogates (or 'sub-brands'), to interact with netizens in order to develop a sense among netizens that they have become friends with candidates. The Shifting IMC model reveals that candidates continue to resort to <b>top-down</b> <b>thinking</b> in order to control the use of Facebook; the SNC model demonstrates how candidates compromise their control with bottom-up power. This project also identifies the position of Facebook in the democratic spectrum in the Taiwan presidential election. The new models and thinking developed in this project offer an alternative perspective for research on social media. The results contribute to the understanding of the use of Web 2. 0 technologies in political communication, especially the networked characteristics of Facebook in the election campaigns.

25|$|There is some {{evidence}} suggesting that executive dysfunction may produce beneficial effects as well as maladaptive ones. Abraham et al. demonstrate that creative thinking in schizophrenia is mediated by executive dysfunction, and they establish a firm etiology for creativity in psychoticism, pinpointing a cognitive preference for broader <b>top-down</b> associative <b>thinking</b> versus goal-oriented thinking, which closely resembles aspects of ADHD. It is postulated that elements of psychosis are present in both ADHD and schizophrenia/schizotypy due to dopamine overlap.|$|R
40|$|What is {{the degree}} to which {{knowledge}} influences visual perceptual processes? This question, which is central to the seeing versus thinking debate in cognitive science, is often discussed using examples claimed to be proof of one stance or another. It has, however, also been muddled by the usage of different and unclear definitions of perception. Here, for the well-defined process of perceptual organization, I argue that including speed (or efficiency) into the equation opens a new perspective on the limits of <b>top-down</b> influences of <b>thinking</b> on seeing. While the input of the perceptual organization process may be modifiable and its output enrichable, the process itself seems so fast (or efficient) that thinking hardly has time to intrude and is effective mostly after the fact. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{draws an}} analogy between product {{development}} and PLM development {{in order to}} address issues which have been observed in PLM development projects in two different automotive companies. In particular it applies ideas from the methodologies of VDI 2221 and systems engineering to address issues in requirements management, functional design, <b>top-down</b> vs. bottom-up <b>thinking</b> and outsourcing. The main findings include that PLM development needs a higher level of “process as the customer” focus in order to manage the requirements. Related to these are also proposals regarding the funding and organization setup which need to reflect the customer focus. Other findings include a possibility to apply ideas from VDI 2221 and systems engineering to increase architectural considerations and focus on functions rather than solutions when developing PLM. Regarding the issue of supplier management the authors propose the use of Technology Readiness Level to assess the maturity of PLM solutions before they are implemented. It is concluded that methods and models from product development can be used in PLM development and their application should also facilitate the communication between PLM developers and product developers...|$|R
40|$|The {{spectrum}} of threats imposed upon modern society has drastically widened {{in the last}} decades. One of the required security means is sensor systems. There exist many types of sensors and their capabilities vary, {{but some of them}} are reconfigurable and able to provide many functions. Such sensors provide at different time instances a wide range of options. These options result in too many choices for humans to consider and they are usually defined in terms that are too strongly focused on complex aspects of sensor technology. Therefore, an automatic tool is required that can control such systems. However, there remain various fundamental challenges in the field of resource allocation in general and for sensor management specifically. The majority of current solutions is driven by the idea that execution of system tasks and/or sensing characteristics have to be optimized. A better option is to develop and configure systems {{in such a way that}} they contribute as much as possible to the end-user's mission. This is obtained with the following cross-disciplinary approach. The strategy of <b>top-down</b> <b>thinking</b> is used to first investigate what various types of end-users consider important, the hypothesis of expected-utility is used to describe mission success expectations, and the observe, orient, decide, and act loop is used to determine on a higher level the required functions and then how sensor technology can contribute to this. The reasoning of falsifiability is used to verify (i. e. self-critical) the concepts and develop supplementary solutions. The ratio between the expected success of the mission when using the developed approach and this expectation when using traditional methods is greater than or equal to 1. Thus, the performance cannot be worse, is at least equal, and potentially much better. The resource management solutions are demonstrated on a high operational level, because this allows to create a context in which the optimization can be discussed with end-users. End-users found the developed resource management solution very applicable for allocating resources during fictional deployment and operational phases. Because of their vivid interest, many focused questions, comments and compliments confirming the added value of the mission-driven approach, it can be concluded that the developed solution matches their operational understanding and needs. The developed mission-driven resource management solution directly defines the end-user's mission as the optimization objective for reconfigurable sensing systems. As a result, the process is not driven by technical characteristics, lookup tables, rules-of-thumb, task priorities and/or artificial quality measures, but by mission success. Any decision (e. g. trade-offs, graceful degradation) can be made based on a single objective function, making the optimization clear and transparent. The result of permanent maximization of mission success expectations is that systems adapt automatically, quickly and accurately to fast changing missions, environments and threats.

40|$|This essay reviews {{literature}} on the theoretical views underlying the selection of activities for classrooms of English literature teaching in EFL context. The review include: 1) literary criticisms, 2) constructivism, and 3) research on students' perceptions of classroom activities. One literary criticism, reader-response, is beheld to pose a similar spirit {{to that of the}} constructivist mode of teaching. Both reader-response and constructivist teaching perspectives require the teaching of English literature to focus on the students. This requires giving attention to the students' ideology, horizon of expectation, and â€œma'lumat sabiqohâ€ (background knowledge) in order to situate the students to actively generate their own meanings, understanding, or knowledge of given literary works offered as class materials. Since the students' personal ideology, horizon of expectation, and ma'lumat sabiqoh are influenced or the socio-culture undergirding every student, the teaching of English literature needs to take into account such socio-cultural properties. Another point reviewed is the students' perceptions of classroom activities. Consideration of combining the <b>top-down</b> mode of <b>thinking,</b> as offered by the reader-response and constructivism, and bottom-up mode of thinking, as offered by research on students' perceptions of classroom activities, constitute the ending part of this essay...|$|R
40|$|Motivational objects attract {{attention}} {{due to their}} rewarding properties, but less {{is known about the}} role that top-down cognitive processes play in the attention paid to motivationally relevant objects and how this is affected by relevant behaviour traits. Here we assess how thinking about food affects attentional guidance to food items and how this is modulated by traits relating to dietary self-control. Participants completed two tasks in which they were presented with an initial cue (food or non-food) to either hold in working memory (memory task) or to merely attend to (priming task). Holding food items in working memory strongly affected attention when the memorized cue re-appeared in the search display. Tendency towards disinhibited eating was associated with greater attention to food versus non-food pictures in both the priming and working memory tasks, consistent with greater attention to food cues per se. Successful dieters, defined as those high in dietary restraint and low in tendency to disinhibition, showed reduced attention to food when holding food-related information in working memory. These data suggest a strong <b>top-down</b> effect of <b>thinking</b> about food on attention to food items and indicate that the suppression of food items in working memory could be a marker of dieting success...|$|R
40|$|Mega-events {{are popular}} {{catalysts}} for launching area-based urban renewal. However, their built legacies are problematic {{due to a}} lack of planning. Besides a much-needed shift in mindset, legacy planning methodology holds the key. This chronic issue is gaining renewed attention with the recent rise of new-generation hosts such as China where massive event-led construction was fast-tracked in a top-down fashion. What remains less understood is the impact and implications of such a forceful paradigm on legacy planning and urban renewal. This paper aims to address this gap with an in-depth case study of Expo 2010 Shanghai China. The central theme is to investigate how this paradigm has been adopted to a previous dockland selected as the Expo 2010 site and a catalyst for city-branding oriented urban renewal. Data was sourced from 2004 to 2015 from personal observations, strategic policies, planning documents, photo documentation, and meetings and interviews. This study identifies both the merits and drawbacks of this controversial paradigm to caution about its mixed impact on mega-event built legacies. It is concluded that future event cities should shift their mindset from super-developers to guardians of built legacies, and strike a balance between the <b>top-down</b> and bottom-up <b>thinking.</b> A new categorization centering on the legacy planning process is proposed, with guidelines to improve legacy planning methodology for future event cities.
