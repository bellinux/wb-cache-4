5|$|The Inaccessible Island rail is a {{seasonal}} breeder, laying between October and January. They are monogamous, forming permanent pair-bonds. The nests are {{situated at the}} base of ferns with <b>tussock</b> <b>grass,</b> <b>tussock</b> <b>grass</b> clumps, or in tufts of sedges. The nests are domed and oval or pear shaped, with the entrances near the narrow end of the nest and linked by a track or tunnel that can go up to half a metre away. The nests are typically built entirely of the same material the nest is found in; for example, <b>tussock</b> <b>grass</b> or sedges. Where the construction material is <b>tussock</b> <b>grass,</b> larger leaves are used on the outside and finer material lines the nest. There are a few reports of other material being used as lining, such as the leaves of introduced Malus domestica (apple) or Salix babylonica (willow).|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Podoserpula pusio grow on the ground, on well-rotted stumps, or among {{decaying}} <b>tussock</b> <b>grass.</b> They are {{presumed to be}} saprobic, and obtain nutrients by breaking down larger organic molecules found in the soil or in decaying wood. P.miranda in contrast, {{is thought to be}} ectomycorrhizal, as it appears to associate with Arillastrum gummiferum, the predominant canopy tree in the forests where it is found.|$|E
5|$|The Inaccessible Island rail has a tiny global range with {{a single}} population. Though still common within its tiny range, with around 5,600 adult birds in the world, the species is {{considered}} to be vulnerable if an invasive species were to reach Inaccessible Island. Insular rails, particularly flightless species, are vulnerable to extinction. House mice, feral cats and brown rats, all of which would be a serious threat to this species, are not present on the island, nor have they ever been, but are present on nearby Tristan da Cunha, and could reach the islands via fishing vessels or other boats visiting the island (mice have been found on boats visiting the neighbouring Nightingale Island). Because of this vulnerability, this species is rated as vulnerable by the IUCN Red List. Fires of <b>tussock</b> <b>grass,</b> which were recorded in 1872 and 1909, are assumed to have killed large numbers of rails, but have not occurred since. In the 1950s they were highly sought after for scientific collections, but permits to do so were rarely granted.|$|E

5|$|The white-winged fairywren is well {{adapted to}} dry environments, and M.l. leuconotus is found {{throughout}} arid and semi-arid environments between latitudes 19 and 32oS in mainland Australia. It occupies coastal Western Australia from around Port Hedland south to Perth, and stretches eastwards over to Mount Isa in Queensland, {{and along the}} western parts of the Great Dividing Range through central Queensland and central western New South Wales, into the northwestern corner of Victoria and the Eyre Peninsula and across the Nullarbor. It commonly cohabits with other species of fairywren, including the purple-backed fairy-wren (M. lamberti assimilis). White-winged fairywrens often inhabit heathlands or treeless shrublands dominated by saltbush (Atriplex) and small shrubs of the genus Maireana, or grasses such as <b>tussock</b> <b>grass</b> (Triodia) and cane-grass (Zygochloa), as well as floodplain areas vegetated with lignum (Muehlenbeckia florulenta). M.l.leucopterus inhabits similar habitats on Dirk Hartog Island and M.l.edouardi does the same on Barrow Island. The white-winged fairywren is replaced {{to the north of}} its range on mainland Australia by the red-backed fairywren.|$|E
25|$|The flora of {{the high}} alti-montane grasslands is mainly <b>tussock</b> <b>grass,</b> {{creeping}} plants, and small shrubs such as ericas. These include the rare Spiral Aloe (Aloe polyphylla), which as its name suggests has leaves with a spiral shape.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} of the Colonial Government was established in 1845 {{with the formation of}} the Legislative Council and Executive Council and work on the construction of Government House commenced. The following year, the first officers appointed to the Colonial Government took their posts; by this time a number of residences, a large storage shed, carpenter's shop and blacksmith's shop had been completed and the Government Dockyard laid out. In 1845 Moody introduced <b>tussock</b> <b>grass</b> into Great Britain from Falkland, for which he received the gold medal of the Royal Agricultural Society. The Coat of arms of the Falkland Islands notably includes an image of <b>tussock</b> <b>grass.</b> Moody returned to England in February 1849. Moody Brook is named after him.|$|E
50|$|The larva {{feeds on}} various <b>grasses,</b> {{including}} reedgrasses, <b>tussock</b> <b>grasses,</b> fescues, canarygrasses, and ryes. This species overwinters as a larva, feeding during mild weather.|$|R
40|$|Patch {{formation}} {{is common in}} grazed grasslands but the mechanisms involved in the formation and maintenance of patches are not clear. To increase our knowledge on this subject we examined possible reasons for patch formation {{and the influence of}} management on changes between patch states in three experiments in native pasture communities in the Crows Nest district, south-east Queensland. In these communities, small-scale patches (tall grassland (dominated by large and medium <b>tussock</b> <b>grasses),</b> short swards (dominated by short <b>tussock</b> <b>grasses</b> and sedges), and lawns (dominated by stoloniferous and/or rhizomatous grasses)) are readily apparent. We hypothesized that the formation of short sward and lawn patches in areas of tall grassland was due to combinations of grazing and soil fertility effects. This was tested in Experiment 1 by applying a factorial combination of defoliation, nutrient application and transplants of short tussock and stoloniferous species to a uniform area of tall grassland. Total species density declined during the experiment, was lower with high nutrient applications, but was not affected by defoliation. There were significant changes in abundance of species that provided support for our hypotheses. With light defoliation and low nutrients, the tall grassland remained dominated by large <b>tussock</b> <b>grasses</b> and contained considerable amounts of forbs. With heavy defoliation, the pastures were dominated by medium <b>tussock</b> <b>grasses</b> and there were significant decreases in forbs and increases in sedges (mainly with low nutrients) and stoloniferous grasses (mainly with high nutrients). Total germinable seed densities and those of most species groups were significantly lower in the heavy defoliation than the light defoliation plots. Total soil seed numbers were not affected by nutrient application but there were fewer seeds of the erect forbs and more sedge seeds in plots with high nutrients. The use of resting from grazing and fire to manage transitions between patches was tested. In Experiment 2, changes in species density and abundance were measured for 5 years in the three patch types with and without grazing. Experiment 3 examined the effects of fire, grazing and resting on short sward patches over 4 years. In Experiment 2, total species density was lower in lawn than short sward or tall grassland patches, and there were more species of erect forbs than other plant groups in all patch types. The lawn patches were originally dominated by Cynodon spp. This dominance continued with grazing but in ungrazed patches the abundance of Cynodon spp. declined and that of forbs increased. In the short sward patches, dominance of short <b>tussock</b> <b>grasses</b> continued with grazing but in ungrazed plots their abundance declined while that of large <b>tussock</b> <b>grasses</b> increased. The tall grassland patches remained dominated by large and medium tussock species. In Experiment 3, fire had no effect on species abundance. On the grazed plots the short <b>tussock</b> <b>grasses</b> remained dominant but where the plots were rested from grazing the small <b>tussock</b> <b>grasses</b> declined and the large <b>tussock</b> <b>grasses</b> increased in abundance. The slow and relatively small changes in these experiments over 4 or 5 years showed how stable the composition of these pastures is, and that rapid changes between patch types are unlikely...|$|R

25|$|Nova Meadow is damp area {{containing}} moisture loving plants including lady's smock, common <b>tussock</b> <b>grass,</b> meadowsweet, {{ragged robin}} and yellow flag iris. A pond {{was created in}} 2003 to attract wildlife and {{the southern part of}} the meadow has reverted to scrubland creating a habitat for yellowhammers and linnets. In autumn it attracts thrushes, fieldfares and redwings which feed on the hawthorn berries.|$|E
25|$|Bale {{houses are}} {{circular}} {{in shape and}} locally referred to as “mana citaa”. Juniper and sometimes eucalyptus are {{used to make the}} walls and roof. The roof is covered with thatched grass cut from “citaa” (<b>tussock</b> <b>grass)</b> or stubble, especially barley, and supported by a wooden pillar, which {{stands in the middle of}} the floor. The house is divided into portions by walls made of bamboo or mud mixed with stubble of barley or grass.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} stage, the pale grey {{body of the}} larva has {{longitudinal}} brown lines, a number of black-knobbed hair like structures, a brown head with no horns, and a rear with no fork. In the following stages, the rear develops a fork, the longitudinal lines become green, and the larva itself becomes green. The mature larva is green and about 28mm long. The feeding habits for the larva extend from winter through early spring. It feeds on grasses like slender <b>tussock</b> <b>grass,</b> kangaroo grass, and false brome.|$|E
40|$|The soil seedbanks {{in three}} patch types (tall grassland, short sward and lawn) were {{measured}} in native pastures near Crows Nest, south-east Queensland in two experiments. In the first experiment, seedbanks were measured at four sites, {{and in the}} second, the variation in seedbanks during the year was measured at one site. In each experiment the size and composition of the seedbanks were determined by germinating the seeds in soil samples. In the first experiment, total seed numbers ranged from approximately 6000 to 12, 000 per m(2). There {{were no significant differences}} between sites for total seeds or for seeds of any species group except legumes which comprised only a small portion of the seedbanks. There were significant differences between patch types for total seeds and for the following species groups, medium <b>tussock</b> <b>grasses,</b> short <b>tussock</b> <b>grasses,</b> stoloniferous grasses, legumes and forbs but not large <b>tussock</b> <b>grasses</b> and sedges. Total seed numbers, and those of medium <b>tussock</b> <b>grasses,</b> stoloniferous grasses and forbs were highest in the lawn patches and lowest in the short sward patches. Legumes had higher numbers in the tall grassland patches than in other patch types. In the second experiment, there were large differences between total seed numbers at the different sample dates (January, May, September and November). Numbers were highest in January and then declined throughout the year. This pattern was largely a reflection of the changes in numbers of forb seeds, the species group with the most seeds. There {{were no significant differences between}} patch types for total seeds but there were for medium <b>tussock</b> <b>grasses,</b> stoloniferous grasses, sedges and forbs. There was no relationship between the composition of the pasture sward and the composition of the seedbank for any of the three patch types. Twenty-eight species were allocated to persistent and transient seedbank types; all seedbank types occurred in all three patch types. The major species in the seedbanks were sedges (Cyperus gracilis, C sesquiflorus), forbs (Gamochaeta spp., Paronychia brasiliana, Daucus glochidiatus) and Eragrostis spp...|$|R

25|$|South Georgia pintails {{breed in}} solitary pairs {{during a long}} {{breeding}} season from late October to early March. Their nests are frequently sited some distance away from water; they are well concealed in <b>tussock</b> <b>grass,</b> often on a shallow platform of grass stems and down feathers above the ground and shielded from above by overhanging vegetation. When returning from feeding, they usually land some distance away from the nest before creeping to it through the undergrowth, {{so as not to}} lead predatory birds to the vulnerable eggs and chicks. They lay small clutches of three to five pale cinnamon-pink eggs, and their chicks' down is dark. They mate for life, with males assisting in raising the young.|$|E
25|$|Outside the {{breeding}} season, and when food is locally abundant, the ducks may congregate in small flocks, sometimes {{of up to}} about a hundred. Murphy noted:On December 20th, 1912, I photographed a pair of teals feeding in a trickle of water which ran through tall <b>tussock</b> <b>grass</b> from the melting edge of a glacier. The birds were well hidden by the screen of grass, and I almost stumbled over them before seeing them. They appeared quite unconcerned, however, and continued prodding about in the mud. When I had come within two steps of them, they raised their heads and waddled farther off among the hummocks, from where they peered out through drooping grass. All but the bright eyes and yellow bills blended completely with the surroundings. Matthews has well said that their pattern fits in so thoroughly with the environment that it is sometimes only {{the movement of the}} conspicuous yellow bill that calls one’s attention to their presence. Many observers have noted the birds’ preference to lose themselves in the grass when they are approached, rather than to seek safety in the air, and it is likely that before the arrival of men and guns at South Georgia they used their wings only for relatively short and infrequent flights.|$|E
500|$|The Inaccessible rail is {{endemic to}} the {{uninhabited}} Inaccessible Island in the Tristan da Cunha {{group in the}} mid-Atlantic Ocean. The island is [...] in area and has a temperate wet oceanic climate with high rainfall, limited sunshine and persistent westerly winds. The rail is found in almost all habitats {{on the island and}} at all altitudes, from sea-level to [...] It reaches its highest densities in fields of <b>tussock</b> <b>grass</b> (Spartina arundinacea), with 10 birds per hectare, and in <b>tussock</b> <b>grass</b> mixed with ferns (Blechnum penna-marina) and sedges, with 15 birds per hectare. This habitat is found close to the shore and surrounds most of the island on the steep cliffs. The Inaccessible Island rail can also be found in upland fern-bush heath, dominated by wind-stunted tree-ferns (Blechnum palmiforme) and in the island forest in the central plateau which is dominated by Island Cape myrtle (Phylica arborea)—which can reach [...] where sheltered—and Blechnum palmiforme. In both these habitats the population is estimated to be two birds per hectare. It will also forage among boulders on the beaches, but has not been found in the short dry grasses on the cinder cones (the scientists making the observations cautioned that {{this does not mean that}} they never use the habitat). It frequently uses natural cavities among boulders or tunnels through grasses created by frequent use to move around while concealed.|$|E
50|$|Tangleheads are erect <b>tussock</b> <b>grasses</b> with paired spikelets. Lower pairs {{are equal}} in size (homogamous units), and upper pairs include one awned {{bisexual}} spikelet and one awnless sterile spikelet (heterogamous units).|$|R
50|$|Charles Sturt {{called the}} habitat ‘stupendous and almost insurmountable sand-ridges of a fiery red’. This area of north-west New South Wales, the Sand Plain Mulga Shrublands, {{supports}} an open cover of shrubs and <b>tussock</b> <b>grasses.</b>|$|R
5|$|Natural {{enemies are}} already {{adapted to the}} habitat and to the target pest, and their {{conservation}} can be simple and cost-effective, as when nectar-producing crop plants are grown in the borders of rice fields. These provide nectar to support parasitoids and predators of planthopper pests and have been demonstrated to be so effective (reducing pest densities by 10- or even 100-fold) that farmers sprayed 70% less insecticides and enjoyed yields boosted by 5%. Predators of aphids were similarly found {{to be present in}} <b>tussock</b> <b>grasses</b> by field boundary hedges in England, but they spread too slowly to reach the centres of fields. Control was improved by planting a metre-wide strip of <b>tussock</b> <b>grasses</b> in field centres, enabling aphid predators to overwinter there.|$|R
500|$|The Inaccessible Island rail is territorial, and {{the territories}} they defend are tiny. The territories in the <b>tussock</b> <b>grass</b> {{habitats}} around Blenden Hall, where the population densities are highest, extend to [...] The {{small size of}} the territories makes encounters between families and individuals frequent, and confrontations and territorial calling are common. On meeting, confrontations start with loud trills or twittering, then birds may face off, standing very {{close to each other}} and displaying ritually with their heads lowered and their bills pointed towards the ground. They may circle, and continue displaying until one bird slowly retreats or a quick skirmish ensues and one bird is driven off.|$|E
500|$|Adult {{macaroni}} penguins typically {{begin to}} breed late in October, and {{lay their eggs}} in early November. The nest itself is a shallow scrape in the ground which may be lined with some pebbles, stones, or grass, or nestled in a clump of <b>tussock</b> <b>grass</b> (on South Georgia Island). Nests are densely packed, ranging from around 66cm apart {{in the middle of}} a colony to 86cm at the edges. A fertile macaroni penguin will lay two eggs each breeding season. The first egg to be laid weighs , 61–64% the size of the [...] second, and is extremely unlikely to survive. The two eggs together weigh 4.8% of the mother's body weight; the composition of an egg is 20% yolk, 66% albumen, and 14% shell. Like those of other penguin species, the shell is relatively thick to minimise risk of breakage, and the yolk is large, which is associated with chicks born in an advanced stage of development. Some of the yolk remains at hatching and is consumed by the chick in its first few days.|$|E
500|$|The Department of Conservation {{has since}} 1993 carried out annual culls and muster of Kaimanawas {{to keep the}} herd {{population}} around a target level of 500 horses. The target will be reduced to 300 horses in stages starting in 2009. These horses are either taken directly to slaughter or are placed at holding farms for later slaughter or adoption by private homes. [...] A main reason for the strict population control {{is to protect the}} habitat in which they live. This habitat includes 16 plant species listed as endangered, which the Kaimanawa may endanger further through trampling and overgrazing. These plants include herbs, grasses, sedges, flowers and mistletoes; among these are Deschampsia caespitosa (a very rare <b>tussock</b> <b>grass),</b> Peraxilla tetrapetala (a vulnerable mistletoe) and Libertia peregrinans (a possibly locally extinct sand iris). The 2009 culling of the population removed 230 horses from the herd, the largest culling {{since the beginning of the}} program, with homes found for 85% of the horses removed. Conservation of these horses is an important matter to the public, and between 1990 and 2003 the New Zealand Minister for Conservation received more public comments on the Kaimanawa horse than on any other subject. In this period, more than 1,400 requests for information and letters were received, with public interest peaking in 1996 and 1997. This was due to a program of population reduction by shooting scheduled to begin implementation in 1996; due to public opposition the shooting was cancelled and a large scale muster and adoption program began in 1997. In 1997, around 1,069 horses were removed from the range and adopted, reducing the main herd to around 500, and reducing their range to around 25,000ha from around 70,000. Since 1993, a total of around 2,800 horses have been removed from the range. Only one injury resulting in the death of a horse is known to have occurred.|$|E
50|$|Like {{several other}} lakes in the region, Lake Dove {{was formed by}} glaciation. The habitat is unique and {{includes}} the Tasmanian deciduous beech (Nothofagus gunnii), <b>tussock</b> <b>grasses,</b> snow gums and pencil pines.

50|$|The striped legless lizard prefers {{undisturbed}} primary native grasslands with dense {{cover of}} <b>tussock</b> <b>grasses</b> such as kangaroo grass (Themeda triandra). Suburban development leading to habitat fragmentation and extensive agricultural impact on both native vegetation and soils {{have contributed to}} the decline of suitable habitat for Delma impar. Only around 3% of undisturbed temperate grasslands (suitable habitat for Delma impar) are estimated to remain in south eastern Australia. Delma impar seeks cover from <b>tussock</b> <b>grasses</b> to help maintain its body temperature and moisture requirements. Habitat selection is also driven by predator avoidance (such as raptors) and the abundance of invertebrate food sources. A key conservation challenge in managing populations of this threatened lizard has been maintaining genetic diversity, as the habitat is highly fragmented and populations are relatively small.|$|R
