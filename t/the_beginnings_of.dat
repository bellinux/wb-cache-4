40|$|PLATELET FUNCTION TESTS WERE PERFORMED ON FIFTEEN PATIENTS WITH GASTROINTESTINAL CARCINOMA: A) PREOPERATIVELY, B) DURING ANAESTHESIA AND C) 30 MINUTES AND THREE HOURS AFTER <b>THE</b> <b>BEGINNING</b> <b>OF</b> <b>THE</b> OPERATION. THE FOLLOWING TESTS WERE APPLIED: 1. PLATELET COUNT. 2. BLEEDING TIME (MIELKE ET AL 1969). 3. PLATELET ADHESIVENESS TEST (SALZMAN'S METHOD, MODIFIED). 4. PLATELET AGGREGATION BY ADP, COLLAGEN AND ADRENALINE. 5. "ADP RELEASE" FROM PLATELETS BY COLLAGEN. IT WAS FOUND THAT: A) DURING THE ANAESTHESIA PERIOD THE PLATELET ADHESIVENESS, PLATELED AGGREGATION AND ADP-RELEASE WERE SLIGHTLY REDUCED. B) AT 30 MINUTES AFTER <b>THE</b> <b>BEGINNING</b> <b>OF</b> <b>THE</b> OPERATION THE PLATELET AGGREGATION SHOWED A FURTHER SLIGHTREDUCTION AND THE BLEEDING TIME WAS SLIGHTLY PROLONGED. C) THREE HOURS AFTERTHE <b>BEGINNING</b> <b>OF</b> <b>THE</b> OPERATION THE PLETELET AGGREGATION WAS FURTHER REDUCED AND THE BLEEDING TIME WAS FURTHER PROLONGED. THE PROLONGATION OF THE BLEEDING TIME THE REDUCTION OF PLATELET AGGREGATION BY ADP AND THE PROLONGATION OF THE DELAY PERIOD OF THE COLLAGEN-INDUCED AGGREGATION AT 3 HOURS AFTER <b>THE</b> <b>BEGINNING</b> <b>OF</b> <b>THE</b> OPERATION COMPARED TO THE ANAESTHESIA PERIOD WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. HOWEVER, IN NO ONE CASE THE RESULTS WERE ABNORMALLY LOW. THESE CHANGES OF PLATELET FUNCTION CANNOT CAUSE DISTURBANCES OF THE HAEMOSTATIC MECHANISM. ...|$|R

5|$|Modern scholar Peter Davies surmises that Eusebius is {{referring}} to the same event as Lactantius, but that he heard of the event through public rumors and knew nothing of the privileged discussion at the emperor's private religion ceremony that Lactantius had access to. Since it was Galerius's army {{that would have been}} purgedDiocletian had left his in Egypt to quell continuing unrestAntiochenes would understandably have believed Galerius to be its instigator. The historian David Woods argues instead that Eusebius and Lactantius are referring to completely different events. Eusebius, according to Woods, describes <b>the</b> <b>beginnings</b> <b>of</b> the army purge in Palestine, while Lactantius describes events at court. Woods asserts that the relevant passage in Eusebius's Chronicon was corrupted in the translation to Latin and that Eusebius's text originally located <b>the</b> <b>beginnings</b> <b>of</b> the army persecution at a fort in Betthorus (El-Lejjun, Jordan).|$|E

5|$|A musical {{instrument}} is an instrument created or adapted to make musical sounds.

Early musical instruments may have been used for ritual, such as a trumpet to signal success on the hunt, or a drum in a religious ceremony. Cultures eventually developed composition and performance of melodies for entertainment. Musical instruments evolved in step with changing applications.|$|E
