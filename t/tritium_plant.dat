40|$|The Savannah River <b>Tritium</b> <b>Plant</b> (TP) {{relies on}} well {{understood}} but aging sensor technology for process gas analysis. Though new sensor technologies {{have been brought}} to various readiness levels, the TP has been reluctant to install technologies that have not been tested in tritium service. This gap between sensor technology development and incorporating new technologies into practical applications demonstrates fundamental challenges that exist when transitioning from status quo to state-of-the-art in an extreme environment such as a <b>tritium</b> <b>plant.</b> These challenges stem from three root obstacles: 1) The need for a comprehensive assessment of process sensing needs and requirements; 2) The lack of a pick-list of process-compatible sensor technologies; and 3) The need to test technologies in a tritium-contaminated process environment without risking production. At Savannah River, these issues are being addressed in a two phase project. In the first phase, TP sensing requirements were determined by a team of process experts. Meanwhile, Savannah River National Laboratory sensor experts identified candidate technologies and related them to the TP processing requirements. The resulting roadmap links the candidate technologies to actual plant needs. To provide accurate assessments of how a candidate sensor technology would perform in a contaminated process environment, an instrument demonstration station was established within a TP glove box. This station was fabricated to TP process requirements and designed to handle high activity samples. The combination of roadmap and demonstration station provides the following assets: � Creates a partnership between the process engineers and researchers for sensor selection, maturation, and insertion, � Selects the right sensors for process conditions � Provides a means for safely inserting new sensor technology into the process without risking production, and � Provides a means to evaluate off normal occurrences where and when they occur.

40|$|A Palladium Membrane Reactor (PMR) {{is under}} {{consideration}} for the <b>tritium</b> <b>plant</b> for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). The ITER reactor exhaust will contain tritiated impurities such as water and methane. Tritium {{will need to be}} recovered from these impurities for environmental and economic reasons. For this purpose a promising device, PMR, has been proposed. The PMR is a combined permeator and catalytic reactor. Shift catalysts are used to foster reactions such as water-gas shift, H{sub 2 }O + CO {yields} H{sub 2 } + CO{sub 2 }, and methane steam reforming, CH{sub 4 } + H{sub 2 }O {yields} 3 H{sub 2 } + CO. Due to thermodynamic limitations these reactions only proceed to partial completion. Thus, a Pd/Ag membrane, which is exclusively permeable to hydrogen isotopes, is incorporated into the reactor. By maintaining a vacuum on the permeate, product hydrogen isotopes are removed, enabling the reactions to proceed to completion. A model has been developed to study the complex interactions in a PMR so that the optimal design can be determined. The model accounts for the coupled effects of transport-limited permeation of hydrogen isotopes and chemical reactions. The permeation model is an extension of previous models that include the effects of temperature, wall thickness, reaction-side pressure, and permeate-side pressure. Reaction rates for methane steam reforming and the water-gas shift reaction are incorporated into the model along with the respective reverse reactions. The model is compared to PMR data and used to investigate the concentration and pressure profiles in the reactor. Due to the interactions of permeation and reaction complex profiles can be produced in a PMR. For example, the water concentration often increases after the inlet to the PMR to a maximum value, and then decreases to the low values expected with a PMR. Detailed information like this is required for the design and optimization of PMRs for the ITER <b>tritium</b> <b>plant...</b>|$|E
40|$|Thermo-oxidation is a {{technique}} where O 2 gas is used to remove carbon co-deposits at elevated temperatures from plasma-facing materials of fusion devices. Following thermo-oxidation, the reaction products produced {{will need to be}} managed by a reactor's gas-handling system, including the <b>tritium</b> <b>plant.</b> Thus, {{it is important to know}} what molecular species are produced during oxidation. The reaction products of thermo-oxidation have previously been studied for undoped films indicating CO, CO 2 and D 2 O as the reaction products. The present study directly compares the reaction product evolution of undoped films to that of films doped with tungsten. A glow discharge was used to produce sets of undoped and W-doped films on stainless steel (SS) foil substrates. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) found the W-doped films to contain an average 0. 1 at. % W/(W+C). Laser thermal desorption spectroscopy (LTDS) was used to measure the areal D-concentration. Reaction products during oxidation were measured using a quadrupole mass spectrometer (QMS). Both the undoped and W-doped specimens were oxidized in 2 Torr O 2, at 350 °C for 4 h, total. LTDS was then used to determine how much D had been removed during oxidation (93 % and 32 % of the D was removed after oxidation for the undoped and W-doped cases respectively). The reduced D loss for the W-doped specimens is attributed to a change in film structure due to the incorporation of W in the film. Oxidation reaction products for both undoped and W-doped films include CO, CO 2, and D 2 O, with no finding of D 2 or CD 4 within experimental uncertainty. Particle accounting was performed for oxygen, deuterium and carbon atoms...|$|E
40|$|Tritium {{systems of}} a nuclear fusion plant, using the {{deuterium-tritium}} fuel cycle, has to ensure tritium safety during plant operation, and activated/tritiated materials management, during plant decommissioning. Accidents resulting in tritium releases to the environment may occur. It is important, therefore, to minimize the mobile tritium inventory {{by means of an}} adequate design and optimization of the plant tritium-bearing systems. Furthermore, the behaviour of tritium in the environment must be accurately studied, in order to take into account its oxidation and absorption by different materials. An experimental tritium-breeding module of DEMO fusion reactor is now under development in Russia. We plan to test it in the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). The ceramic lithium orthosilicate will be used in it as tritium breeder. The Tritium Cycle System (TCS) will ensure tritium extracting and processing of gaseous mixtures containing tritium. The report contains the flow chart of the TCS using alloys producing hydrides. TCS assures highest possible autonomy and independence on ITER <b>tritium</b> <b>plant</b> at technological operations.

The flow sheet of technological operations at the maintenance and repair works and the System of Radiological Safety ensuring safety during these works is analyzed.

40|$|The Accelerator Production of Tritium (APT) project, {{sponsored}} by Department of Energy Defense Programs (DOE/DP), involves the preconceptual design of an accelerator system to produce tritium for the nation`s stockpile of nuclear weapons. Tritium is an isotope of hydrogen used in nuclear weapons, {{and must be}} replenished because of radioactive decay (its half-life is approximately 12 years). Because the annual production requirements for tritium has greatly decreased {{since the end of}} the Cold War, an alternative approach to reactors for tritium production, based on a linear accelerator, is now being seriously considered. The annual tritium requirement at the time this study was undertaken (1992 - 1993) was 3 / 8 that of the 1988 goal, usually stated as 3 / 8 -Goal. Continued reduction in the number of weapons in the stockpile has led to a revised (lower) production requirement today (March, 1995). The production requirement needed to maintain the reduced stockpile, as stated in the recent Nuclear Posture Review (summer 1994) is approximately 3 / 16 -Goal, half the previous level. The Nuclear Posture Review also requires that the production plant be designed to accomodate a production increase (surge) to 3 / 8 -Goal capability within five years, to allow recovery from a possible extended outage of the <b>tritium</b> <b>plant.</b> A multi-laboratory team, collaborating with several industrial partners, has developed a preconceptual APT design for the 3 / 8 -Goal, operating at 75 % capacity.

40|$|The {{hydrogen}} element exists {{naturally in}} the form of three isotopes, sharing the same number of proton and electron, which is equal to one, but not that of neutrons, which ranges from zero to two. In order, these isotopes are: protium, commonly said light hydrogen and indicated with (_ 1 ^ 1) H or simply H; deuterium, commonly heavy hydrogen indicated with (_ 1 ^ 2) H or D; and tritium, (_ 1 ^ 3) H or T. Naturally, deuterium abundance is 0. 0115 per cent, while tritium is rare and radioactively unstable. Protium, deuterium and tritium form diatomic molecules bonding together, which can be homonuclear, H_ 2, D_ 2 and T_ 2, or heteronuclear, HD, HT and DT. Homonuclear molecules can exists in either a ortho modification, oH_ 2, oD_ 2, oT_ 2, or a para modification, pH_ 2, pD_ 2, pT_ 2. Hydrogen has the largest isotope effects principally due to the largest differences in the relative mass of its isotopes. Isotope effects are differences in chemical and physical properties arising from differences in the nuclear mass. In particular, lighter hydrogen molecules are characterized by higher vapour pressures than heavier ones; in other words, lighter molecules are more volatile. Among the isotope separation techniques, distillation is adopted in industrial applications because of the advantages of achieving high separation degrees and of processing large quantities of fluids. Distillation is based on the different vapour pressures of the components to be separate and, hence, it requires the coexistence of liquid and vapour phases. Coexistence occurs in the cryogenic range 10 - 40 K for molecular hydrogen. The number of cryogenic distillation plants constructed for deuterium and tritium separation is small due to their limited market. One example is the deuterium plant built in Germany in the late 1960 s, and another the <b>tritium</b> <b>plant</b> in Canada in late 1980 s. Both plants proved the possibility to achieve high purities, exceeding 99. 8 per cent, as well as high separation factors. Today, deuterium is employed mostly as constituent of heavy water as neutron moderator for a number of nuclear fission reactors; it is also utilized for the preparation of nuclear weapons or as a non-radioactive tracer in chemical and metabolic reactions. Tritium is used instead as a radioactive tracer in chemistry and biology. Both deuterium and tritium are adopted for the research on the physics of matter and, notably, they have been selected for the future ITER nuclear fusion reactor...|$|E

Concentrations of <b>tritium</b> in <b>plants</b> will be have huge difference in plants because of the difference of the value of R, and this in turn would result in difference of ingestion dose via food chain. Some studies suggested that a site-specific distribution of R should be developed in suing a specific activity model. In this study, distribution of R is established for the Qinshan NPP Base. The environmental monitoring data of tritium concentration in five type plants (rapeseed, tea, cabbage, radish and rice) and air at three sampling points (Xiajiawan, Qinlian and Ganpu) around Qinshan NPP Base(QNNP) over a 4 years period as the basis for analysis, and the <b>tritium</b> ratio(R) between <b>plant</b> water and air moisture were determined.

That work includes assembly and testing of the first 20 MeV of the low energy plant linac at 100 mA, high-energy linac accelerating structure prototyping, radiofrequency power system improvements, neutronic efficiency measurements, and materials qualifications...|$|R
40|$|Dose {{calculations}} {{have been}} performed for accidental releases of tritium and activation products. Unit releases of 1 GBq per nuclide have been investigated for 31 fusion relevant nuclides. Additionally, unit releases of 1 g of tritium and several activated materials have been studied. Under normal operation conditions, dose calculations {{have been performed}} for real source terms of tritium and activated materials. The individual dose values at the fence of the site (1 km) {{as well as the}} collective dose to the public (from 1 km to 100 km) have been obtained. As site specific parameters are still missing, different so called ''worst case'' release conditions have been applied. To have a first guess of the influence of the release duration on the dose to the Most Exposed Individual (MEI) in the vicinity of a reactor, different release durations, ranging from 1 hour up to 168 hours have been investigated, too. Finally, dose calculations have been performed for mobilisation source terms which take account of deposition and retention in the plant. This has been done for several RPM and APM source terms. The dose values of these final source terms seem to be less than every criteria to start emergency actions, however, some problems e. g. the behaviour of <b>tritium</b> in the <b>plant,</b> remain unsolved.

40|$|The {{design of}} target/blanket system {{components}} for the Accelerator Production of <b>Tritium</b> (APT) <b>plant</b> {{is dependent on}} the development of materials properties data specified by the designer. These data are needed to verify that component designs are adequate. The adequacy of the data will be related to safety, performance, and economic considerations, and to other requirements that may be deemed necessary by customers and regulatory bodies. The data required may already be in existence, as in the open technical literature, or may need to be generated, {{as is often the case}} for the design of new systems operating under relatively unique conditions. The designers' starting point for design data needs is generally some form of design criteria used in conjunction with a specified set of loading conditions and associated performance requirements. Most criteria are aimed at verifying the structural adequacy of the component, and often take the form of national or international standards such as the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (ASME B and PV Code) or the French Nuclear Structural Requirements (RCC-MR). Whether or not there are specific design data needs associated with the use of these design criteria will largely depend on the uniqueness of the conditions of operation of the component. A component designed in accordance with the ASME B and PV Code, where no unusual environmental conditions exist, will utilize well-documented, statistically-evaluated developed in conjunction with the Code, and will not be likely to have any design data needs. On the other hand, a component to be designed to operate under unique APT conditions, is likely to have significant design data needs. Such a component is also likely to require special design criteria for verification of its structural adequacy, specifically accounting for changes in materials properties which may occur during exposure in the service environment. In such a situation it is common for the design criteria and design data needs to evolve as the design progresses, operating conditions are refined, and materials characteristics in the unique environment are established. This paper develops the relationship between the designers' data needs and the structural design criteria recently adopted for the Target Blanket System of the APT. The latter, the newly-developed APT Supplemental Structural Design Requirements (APT SSDR), was patterned after the design criteria developed for the International Thermonuclear Experimental (Fusion) Reactor (ITER). A summary description of the design rules based on the APT SSDR is presented, and the impact of these rules of changes in materials properties resulting from exposure in the APT proton/neutron irradiation environment are discussed...|$|R
