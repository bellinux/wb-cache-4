5|$|Dow {{continued}} to promote prohibition after leaving office, but also added {{his voice to}} the growing chorus advocating the abolition of slavery. Several slaveholding states seceded after the election of Republican presidential candidate Abraham Lincoln, and formed the Confederate States of America; even before {{the outbreak of the}} Civil War, Dow called for the rebellion to be crushed and slavery abolished. He was 57 years old at the outbreak of the war, and determined <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> tend to his business and care for his aging father. After the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter, however, Dow felt compelled to join the Union cause. Governor Israel Washburn appointed him Colonel of the 13th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment on November 23, 1861. Many of the officers Dow recruited to the cause were his associates from the prohibition movement.|$|E

Volunteers provided food, blankets, water, internet services, children's toys, massages, and a live rock band performance for {{those at the}} stadium. Nearly all public schools and universities in the San Diego area were closed. Many businesses closed as well. To ensure clear roads for emergency vehicles, San Diego mayor Jerry Sanders asked residents <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> inside.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the men who}} {{controlled}} the Jacobins rejected the Revolutionary Republican Women as dangerous rabble-rousers. At this point the Jacobins controlled the government; they dissolved the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women, and decreed that all women's clubs and associations were illegal. They sternly reminded women <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> tend to their families by leaving public affairs to the men. Organised women were permanently {{shut out of the}} French Revolution after October 30, 1793.|$|E

As a young girl, she was an exceptional student and a silver medal recipient in an examination organized by the Governor-General and the local parish priest. When she became a secondary school student, she was induced by her parents <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> look after her younger sister and the family farm, since both of her older brothers had moved to Manila to continue their education.|$|E
25|$|Seven more {{errors in}} nine more chances {{followed}} that day, a debacle that McGraw would not soon forget. After the team opened with no wins in six contests, Kenney {{and the other}} members of the ownership of the team—in the face of attendance that had dwindled to nearly nothing—were forced to overhaul the team. McGraw was given his release from the team, but Kenney also loaned him $70 and wished him luck if he wanted to try to catch on with another squad. McGraw could not bear the thought of going home a failure, as both his father and Mary Goddard had urged him <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> take a regular job, instead of chasing his dream of being a ballplayer. McGraw was resolute in his determination to make a name for himself as a professional baseball player, even if that meant struggling along in poverty for a time.|$|E

25|$|Various {{cultural}} and social values have historically contributed to gender disparity in education. According to work done by Denga, one prominent cultural view {{is that it is}} better for the woman <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> learn to tend to her family instead of attending school. To explain the fact that more boys than girls participated in education, Nigerian researcher Obasi identified a host of constraints with 'Nigerian tradition' being named as top of the list. The 'Nigerian tradition' was explained as a tradition that attaches higher value to a man than a woman, whose place {{is believed to be the}} kitchen. A study by the University of Ibadan linked the imbalance in boys' and girls’ participation in schooling was to the long-held belief in male superiority and female subordination. This situation was further aggravated by patriarchal practices which gave girls no traditional rights to succession. Therefore, the same patriarchal practices encouraged preference to be given to the education of a boy rather than a girl.|$|E
25|$|The {{day of the}} attacks, the U.S. Consulate in Guadalajara issued {{multiple}} security warnings {{through its}} Facebook page and on its website. They reported that there were several blockades across Jalisco and Colima, {{and that there were}} vehicles, gasolines, banks, and other buildings set on fire during the attacks. It warned its employees in Jalisco about the attacks and blockades, and asked them to remain at home until the situation was resolved by law enforcement. Their warning also extended to U.S. tourist planning to visit Jalisco, and asked them to avoid visiting the area. They asked U.S. citizens to look out for any public announcements by the Mexican government. The consulate was closed for International Workers' Day (celebrated on May 1), but they said they were re-opening their offices on Monday, May 4. The warning concluded by suggesting U.S. citizens traveling or living in Mexico to consult the alerts and warnings page at the website of the U.S. Department of State. The Embassy of Canada, Mexico City also warned Canadians <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> limit their outdoor activities.|$|E

500|$|In January 1987, Stella Nickell's adult daughter, Cynthia Hamilton, {{approached}} {{police with}} information: Nickell {{had spoken to}} her daughter repeatedly about wanting her husband dead. He was a bore, Nickell said, who after having gotten sober, preferred <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> watch television rather than go out to bars. Nickell, Hamilton claimed, had even {{told her that she}} had tried to poison Bruce previously with foxglove. When that failed, she had begun library research into other methods and hit upon cyanide.

500|$|The matter {{exposed the}} {{practices}} of the barely underground economy of wealthy households and largely illegal immigrant suppliers. [...] The owner of one Manhattan nanny agency stated, [...] "It's just a reality of life that without the illegal girls, there wouldn't be any nannies, and the mommies would have <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> mind their own kids." [...] The practice had grown as both married women with children and single working mothers entered the workforce in large numbers during the 1980s, with the extended hours and long commutes of many professional positions further exacerbating it. [...] The Irish and Central and South American immigrant population of domestic workers was augmented by those from the Philippines, China, Ireland, or Poland. [...] People hiring nannies often preferred illegal aliens, who {{were thought to be}} easier to find, considerably less expensive, and more loyal if they worked out and easier to fire if they did not. [...] As one Floral Park, Queens, woman said, [...] "I want someone who cannot leave the country, who doesn't know anyone in New York, who basically does not have a life. I want someone who is completely dependent on me and loyal to my family." [...] Americans themselves were largely unwilling to do the jobs.|$|E

500|$|In April 2012, Ann Romney was spotlighted when Democratic {{commentator}} Hilary Rosen declared Romney to be {{unfit to}} address women's economic issues {{because as a}} stay-at-home mother, she had [...] "never worked a day in her life". [...] In response, Ann Romney issued her first tweet, saying [...] "I made a choice <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> raise five boys. Believe me, it was hard work." [...] Rosen apologized the following day [...] [...] Like all presidential candidates' wives, her fashion choices came under scrutiny, with some critics praising her for a contemporary look that avoided standard campaign appearance clichés, while others said she lacked consistency and {{did not seem to}} be using the services of a stylist. On August 28, Romney gave a prime-time speech before the 2012 Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida, in which she stressed her own background and her family experiences, in an appeal to women voters. [...] By early October, she and son Tagg had convinced the campaign to spend more time emphasizing her husband's personal nature and character, rather than simply present issue and record arguments against Obama. Romney sparked discussion of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania being in play when she campaigned at Elizabethtown College.|$|E

As a result of continuing public debate, the US Labor Department's chief, Lynn Morley Martin, reported {{the results of a}} research project called [...] "The Glass Ceiling Initiative" [...] formed to investigate the low numbers of women and minorities in executive positions. This report defined the new term as [...] "those artificial barriers based on attitudinal or organizational bias that prevent qualified individuals from advancing upward in their organization into management-level positions." ...|$|E

2500|$|In early 1999, Raduyev {{vanished}} from public again while undergoing a major plastic surgery operation in Germany, in effect acquiring a new face. The alleged implants of titanium {{earned him the}} nickname of [...] "Titanic" [...] in Russia, while in Chechnya he became popularly known as [...] "Michael Jackson", a reference to his plastic surgery. Still seriously ill and recovering from surgery, Raduyev had vowed [...] "reprisals" [...] against Russia for the March 1999 sentencing of two Chechen women. In September 1999, {{at the start of}} the Second Chechen War, Raduyev organized a rally in Grozny attended by 12,000 people where he urged residents <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> prepare to defend the city.

2500|$|Social feminists {{then went}} further {{to claim that}} women “were {{fundamentally}} different from men in psychology and in physiology…” and stressed gender differences rather than simply equality, demanding that women have the right of choice <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> raise a family, if they so desired, by issue of a financial allowance, advocated by the Catholic church, or {{to go into the}} workforce and have assistance with childcare through government mandated programs, such as nationally funded daycare facilities and parental leave. [...] The historical context of the times was a belief that [...] "a society cut to the measure of men ill served women and harmed the overall interests of society". As a result of this push for public programs, European women became more involved in politics and by the 1990s held six to seven times more legislative seats than the United States, enabling them to influence the process in support of programs for women and children.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2013, heavy {{rainfall}} {{west of the}} city caused the reservoir to exceed its capacity.

City officials urged Calgarians, particularly the 350,000 people who work downtown, <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>home</b> <b>and</b> limit non-essential travel. Unlike the 2005 flood, the Glenmore water treatment facility had no difficulty treating water. [...] City officials did, however, implement municipal outdoor watering restrictions to ensure water quality remained high throughout the incident. Government officials called the flooding the worst in Alberta's history. This flood prompted a local Erlton resident to propose the Heritage Drive Tunnel Spillway as a way to divert 500 cubic metres per second of water around the downtown core and into the lower Bow River.|$|E
