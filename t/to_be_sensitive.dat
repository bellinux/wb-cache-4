5|$|Because each antenna {{was aimed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sensitive</b> {{primarily}} {{in a single}} direction, {{the length of the}} blips depended on the position of the target relative to the fighter. For instance, a target located 35 degrees above the fighter would cause the signal in the upper vertical receiver to be maximized, causing a long blip to appear on the upper trace, and none on the lower trace. Although less sensitive directly forward, both vertical antennas could see {{directly in front of the}} fighter, so a target located dead ahead caused two slightly shorter blips, one on either side of the centreline.|$|E
5|$|Cultivation {{from seed}} may be {{difficult}} or easy, depending on the species. The more difficult species to grow include the ones that require a period of dormancy or smoke treatment to simulate a bushfire. Stylidium specimens should be grown in a medium that is kept moist and has a relatively low concentration of nutrients. It {{should also be noted}} that they appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sensitive</b> to disturbance of their root systems. Minimization of such disturbance will likely result in healthier plants.|$|E
5|$|Einstein and De Haas {{demonstrated}} that magnetization {{is due to}} the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin. In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a torsion pendulum. They confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron's angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes. This experiment needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sensitive,</b> because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.|$|E

5|$|Penicillin {{has been}} {{suggested}} as the drug of choice {{for the treatment of}} S.iniae infection in mammals, including humans. In the 1995–1996 cluster of human cases, all clinical s were susceptible to penicillin, several cephalosporins, clindamycin, erythromycin, and co-trimoxazole (MICs 0.25µg/ml); all nine patients were treated with parenteral beta-lactam antibiotics and recovered uneventfully. A study of isolates submitted to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 2000 and 2004 found all <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sensitive</b> to beta-lactams, macrolides, quinolones, and vancomycin.|$|E
5|$|The Norfolk Coast Partnership, a {{grouping}} of conservation and environmental bodies, divide {{the coast and}} its hinterland into three zones for tourism development purposes. Holkham dunes, along with Holme Dunes and Blakeney Point, were considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sensitive</b> habitats already suffering from visitor pressure, and were designated as red-zone areas with no development or parking improvements to be recommended.

5|$|Tooth decay {{is caused}} by certain types of acid-producing {{bacteria}} which cause the most damage {{in the presence of}} fermentable carbohydrates such as sucrose, fructose, and glucose. The resulting acidic levels in the mouth affect teeth because a tooth's special mineral content causes it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>sensitive</b> to low pH. Depending on the extent of tooth destruction, various treatments can be used to restore teeth to proper form, function, and aesthetics, but there is no known method to regenerate large amounts of tooth structure. Instead, dental health organizations advocate preventative and prophylactic measures, such as regular oral hygiene and dietary modifications, to avoid dental caries.|$|E
30|$|Although {{physical}} {{interpretation of}} the above is obvious, Peter and Flock could not draw definite conclusion between the instability scaling index (ISI) and oil recovery. At low range of ISI, the recovery sounds <b>to</b> <b>be</b> less <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> λ c/D values, whereas within the boundary values, the recovery <b>is</b> found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> highly <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> the scaling index (Peter and Flock 1981).|$|R

5000|$|Boar taint is the {{offensive}} odor or taste {{that can be}} evident during the cooking or eating of pork or pork products derived from non-castrated male pigs once they reach puberty. Boar taint is found in around 20% of entire male finishing pigs. Skatole may also be detected in gilts, but this is linked with faecal contamination of the skin. Studies show that about 75% of consumers <b>are</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>to</b> boar taint so {{it is necessary for}} pork producers to control it.

40|$|Shape memory alloys (SMAs) are metals that exhibit large {{recoverable}} strains and exert large {{forces with}} tremendous energy densities. The behavior of SMAs is thermomechanically coupled.

25|$|The {{reason for}} using the order for testing drugs is because the two most {{important}} drugs for treating TB are INH and RMP, so these are tested first: PZA is the most likely drug to cause hepatitis and is also the drug that can be most easily omitted.
