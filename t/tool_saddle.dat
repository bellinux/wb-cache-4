Modular approach provides the potential to include low-level tools as elements of SADDLE’s design workflow, moving towards the goal of electronic system level (ESL) design automation.

40|$|The saddle gall midge, Haplodiplosis marginata (von Roser) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), has {{undergone}} a resurgence recently as a pest of cereals in Belgium and other European countries. An effective monitoring <b>tool</b> of <b>saddle</b> gall midge flights is {{needed in order to}} understand the enigmatic population dynamics of this pest, and to design an integrated management strategy. Therefore, volatile compounds emitted by females (alkan- 2 -ols and alk- 2 -yl butanoates) were identified, and the chirality of the emitted esters was determined to be the R absolute configuration. In field-trapping experiments, racemic non- 2 -yl butanoate attracted substantial numbers of H. marginata males. Thus, this compound will be useful in baited traps for monitoring seasonal flight patterns, and improving integrated management of the saddle gall midge in agricultural systems. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In [10], {{we showed}} {{that most of the}} open-closed topological quantum field theory (TQFT) string {{operations}} vanish including all the higher genus TQFT operations, and we described a small list of genus zero openclosed TQFT string operations which can be nontrivial. In this paper, we consider open-closed string operations associated to open-closed cobordisms homeomorphic to discs. These operations constitute the main part of genus zero string operations, and they include the saddle string operation of two open strings interacting at their internal points. We show not only that disc string operations are independent of their half-pair-of-pants decompositions but also that these disc string operations can be computed by simultaneous saddle interactions of incoming open strings at the same point, and they take values in homology classes of constant open strings on some closed orientable submanifolds, which we will precisely determine. We will also discuss a role played by fundamental constant homology classes in open-closed string topology. Our main <b>tools</b> are <b>saddle</b> interaction diagrams and their deformations...|$|R

We use the direct variational approach for this problem on a W 1, 2 -space of even functions, and prove new iteration inequalities on Morse indices. Using these <b>tools</b> and the <b>saddle</b> point theorem, we obtain results under precisely Rabinowitz′ superquadratic condition on potential functions. We show that for every T> 0 the above mentioned system possesses a T-periodic even solution with minimal period not smaller than T/(n+ 2) ...|$|R

50|$|Dukha {{lives in}} yurts made {{primarily}} of birch bark that resembled the tepees of Native-Americans in appearance. A large yurt {{may take the}} bark from up to 32 trees to make; a medium-sized yurt is made from the bark of 23-25 trees. An opening of 2-3 meters in height allows access to the yurt. A bag that houses the guardian spirits of a shaman rests {{in the rear of}} the yurt. On the right side, the Dukha family will keep its hunting equipment, <b>saddles,</b> <b>tools</b> and utensils. A traditional Dukha yurt will not have a bed, but rather skins covering the ground, upon which the family sleeps. A stove sits in the middle of the yurt.|$|R
50|$|The Inadan live in Tuareg settlements, are {{sedentary}} {{and dark}} skinned, considered subordinate and lowly, and endogamous because of social taboos towards inter-marriage between their strata {{and other members}} of the Tuareg tribe. Their hereditary occupation has been artisanal smith-related work and leather work, but they have diversified into providing labor services such as in tourism in contemporary Tuareg communities. According to Heath, Inadan have included the blacksmith, jewelers, wood workers and leather artisan castes. They produced and repaired the <b>saddles,</b> <b>tools,</b> household items and other items for the Tuareg community.

60|$|A {{call from}} Dale {{disturbed}} their raptures. Turning, they hobbled with eager but painful {{steps in the}} direction of a larger camp-fire, situated to the right of the great rock that sheltered their lean-to. No hut or house showed there and none was needed. Hiding-places and homes for a hundred hunters were there in the sections of caverned cliffs, split off in bygone ages from the mountain wall above. A few stately pines stood out from the rocks, and a clump of silver spruce ran down to a brown brook. This camp was only a step from the lean-to, round the corner of a huge rock, yet it had been out of sight. Here indeed was evidence of a hunter's home--pelts and skins and antlers, a neat pile of split fire-wood, a long ledge of rock, well sheltered, and loaded with bags like a huge pantry-shelf, packs and ropes and <b>saddles,</b> <b>tools</b> and weapons, and a platform of dry brush as shelter for a fire around which hung on poles a various assortment of utensils for camp.|$|R
50|$|Dukhas live {{differently}} from most {{other people in}} the world. The Dukha's sense of community is structured around the reindeer. The reindeer and the Dukha are dependent on one another. Some Dukha say that if the reindeer disappear, so too will their culture. The reindeer are domesticated and belong to the household. In many ways they are treated like family members and shown respect. The community's chores and activities are centered around the care and feeding of their reindeer. Dukha communities on the taiga are usually a group of tents of two to seven households that move camp to find optimum grazing for the reindeer. Herding tasks are shared amongst the camp with children at a young age learning to care for the reindeer and keeping them safe. The girls and younger women do the milking and make yogurt, cheese, and milk tea. Young men and women and elders help with herding. A few of the men stay with the reindeer in the winter months, living in the open air with their herds to protect them from wolves and other predators. The men also make and repair their hunting <b>tools</b> and reindeer <b>saddles</b> and carts. Since they rarely kill a reindeer, they supplement their diet of reindeer milk products by hunting wild animals from the forest.|$|R
40|$|An early {{agricultural}} society {{was established in}} the Izu Islands {{by the middle of the}} Yayoi period(ca. 100 BC). A large scale village dating to this period was recently excavated at Ozato-higashi on Miyake Island. This site produced a large quantity of barley phytoliths from the artifact bearing strata. Although rice paddy fields cannot be utilized on the volcanic loam soils of Miyake Island, the presence of barley agriculture in dry fields was confirmed at Ozato-higashi. Compared with mainland sites of the same time period, Ozato-higashi produced many <b>tools</b> such as <b>saddle</b> querns and grinding stones that would appear to be linked with food processing. Another characteristic of the site is its almost total lack of fishing tools despite its coastal location. Ozato-higashi appears to have been a permanent residential village with a main emphasis on dry field farming. Furthermore, the presence of a large quantity of faunal remains at the nearby Middle Yayoi site of Kokomanokoshi suggests that rather than mere seasonal adaptations, a division of labour between villages was already in existence. On the main islands of Japan, this was the time in which full-scale agricultural villages based on wet rice cultivation were being established. The same was true of the Izu Islands, but here the evidence of sites such as Ozato-higashi shows that there was a flexibility to adapt to the more difficult local environmental conditions. The formation of a society having such an adaptive flexibility meant the end of the society which had carried out incipient cultivation from the latter half of the Jomon period...|$|R
