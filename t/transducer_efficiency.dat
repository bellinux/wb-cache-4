40|$|Abstract: While {{non-contact}} – air/gas coupled – uses {{of sound}} waves are {{buried in the}} antiquities of our civilization, in modern times, presumably {{one of the first}} applications is related to Antarctic ice thickness measurement by sending high intensity sound waves from an airplane in the 1920 s. Initial industrial Non-Contact Ultrasound (NCU) was confined between 20 kHz to < 100 kHz. The primary hurdle to NCU is the transducer inefficiency in air/gases. This complication is further exacerbated in MHz regime. Consequently, NCU was not taken seriously. During the last 25 years a handful of laboratories have endeavored to develop NCU transducers by applying a variety of plastics, elastomers, and density gradient Z-matching layers on piezoelectric materials. While the <b>transducer</b> <b>efficiency</b> is increased, yet it is not significant for practical NCU. Recent transducer advances have phenomenally enhanced the efficiency between < 60 kHz to ~ 10 MHz. Further increment of efficiency will depend on the piezoelectric material. To this effect, a new piezoelectric composite characterized by the highest possible coupling, has elevated NCU transducers to new heights. As a result of these unusual developments, NCU is not only a reality, but it has also opened doors to ultrasound, hitherto, closed to conventional contact or liquid coupled modes.

40|$|Chemotherapy {{effectiveness}} {{not only}} depends on drug penetration extent in target tissues or tumor cells, but {{also depends on}} drug suppression extent by the normal tissues and cells. Ultrasound acts as {{an important role to}} meet this requirement in drug delivery of chemotherapy in recent years. The popular methods are micro bubbles and HIFU (high intensity focused ultrasound). In this thesis, we developed a method using ultrasound radiation force to ?push? the drug penetrate into tumor cells. The capillaries' walls in tumor are different from normal capillaries' ones. The space between cells of tumor capillary wall is quite big due to the aggressive growing. So drug can easily leak to interstitium and reach the pressure low difference besides capillaries wall. Which implicates that drug cannot travel too far from the blood vessel, only few tumor cells close to the blood vessels are exposed to the drug. Our study is addressing this issue. In our experiment, the tumor is placed at the focus of transducer and the radiation force in focus will build the bigger difference pressure besides capillaries walls and ?push? the drug from capillaries into tumor cells. But the radiation force must be controlled not too high to burn out the tumor. So in order to produce suitable radiation force or intensity in focus to improve drug transport, transducer simulation and design is the first important. In this thesis, many parameters of transducer such as center frequency, aperture size, beamwidth, depth of focus and so on are simulated. <b>Transducer</b> <b>efficiency,</b> thermal effect were measured. In the experiment, their combinational effect was applied. Ultrasonix 4 DL 14 - 5 / 38 probe, Sonix MDP scanner, software Forwardsim[1], hydrophone, thermal meter were used in this project. Center frequency, aperture size, beamwidth, depth of focus and ultrasound field are simulated by Forwardsim[1]. This software is quite powerful and developed mainly by Johannes Kvam and can simulate transducer ultrasound field in many aspects. <b>Transducer</b> <b>efficiency</b> was measured by hydrophone.

40|$|Ultrasonic {{transducers}} {{have found}} extensive {{applications in the}} fields of non-destructive testing, biomedicine, and SONAR. Piezocomposite ultrasonic transducers can offer significant advantages over their pure ceramic counterparts, but at the expense of increased manufacturing complexity and the introduction of additional resonant modes that may reduce <b>transducer</b> <b>efficiency</b> if the device is not carefully designed. Extensive work has been carried out over the last twenty years to characterise the behaviour of piezocomposite devices, resulting in many design guidelines, some of which are only applicable in a limited range of device structures. This Thesis presents a new theory of the generation of inter-pillar modes that is based upon the generation of Lamb waves in the piezocomposite plate. Through the use of finite element analysis and a scanning laser interferometer, the resonant mode displacement shapes of piezocomposite transducers are studied and analysed. Excellent correlation between modelled and experimental results is observed, and leads to the conclusion that Lamb waves, rather than Bragg scattering, are responsible for the generation of the high frequency inter-pillar modes. To facilitate these analyses, a comprehensive finite element modelling procedure that includes all piezocomposite microstructure effects as well as matching, backing and fluid loading effects was developed. Additionally, it was demonstrated that for low drive voltages, the acousto-optic effect has minimal effect on the through-water laser scanning of piezocomposite transducers. Finally, the analysis tools developed for the examination of piezocomposites were used to improve the design of an existing flexible ultrasonic transducer used for non-destructive te. sting.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2003 High Intensity Focused Ultrasound, or HIFU, {{is capable}} of {{treating}} tissue deep in the body {{without the need for}} surgery. With this premise, an ultrasound image-guided HIFU device has been developed for treating submucosal uterine fibroids, which are benign tumors common in women of reproductive age. Fibroids may cause bleeding, discomfort, and lead to infertility, and is the largest indication for hysterectomy. HIFU treatment has the potential for women to retain their uterus while suppressing symptomatic fibroids. The device was designed based on the female anatomy. It consisted of a commercially available abdominal image probe and a transvaginal HIFU transducer operating at 4. 0 MHz. A piezoelectric crystal affixed to an aluminum lens focused ultrasound energy at a fixed distance of 4 cm from the transducer. A graphite embedded epoxy matching layer placed in front of the lens increased the <b>transducer</b> <b>efficiency</b> by approximately 6 %. The HIFU transducer was mechanically aligned to the image probe such that the HIFU focus was in the image plane allowing image-guided therapy. A latex condom filled with circulated water covered the transducer providing a sterile covering, acoustic coupling, and transducer cooling. A targeting system using position sensors mounted on the device was used to track the location of the HIFU focus relative to the ultrasound image. Computer software tracked the HIFU focus location and superimposed a visual target on the ultrasound image based on the data acquired by the position sensors. The device was characterized using acoustic measurement techniques of hydrophone field mapping and radiation force balance. Image-guided therapy was then performed in vitro in a tissue-mimicking phantom and in turkey breast tissue. Treated regions, or lesions, were created at the intended location, and appeared in the ultrasound image as hyperechoic spots above a specific intensity threshold. An ergonomic study without treatment, using human volunteers, was performed. The HIFU transducer, uterus, and pelvic structures were visualized in the ultrasound image. There was no patient discomfort when the device was placed in situ. The device was used to create lesions in vivo in sheep uterus. Gross and microscopic analysis was performed for 4 different time periods post-treatment. A full bladder and adequate transducer cooling were needed for a successful treatment. During treatment, lesions were visible as hyperechoic spots at HIFU intensities above 2200 W/cm 2. HIFU treated areas were coagulative necrosis lesions consisting of a necrotic center surrounded by a ring of blood congestion. Over a period of 30 days, necrotic tissue was phagocytosed by macrophages, ablated myometrium was partially regenerated, and scar tissue formed in the treated area.

40|$|Experimental {{design in}} bioacoustics is {{determined}} by several factors. One of these factors that is often overlooked is {{the uncertainty of the}} recording device and the information recorded. From the clock speed to the <b>transducer</b> <b>efficiency,</b> the spatial positioning to the frequency response of the device’s ADC, there are many different sources of uncertainty to be contended with. Methods of quantifying the uncertainties of different instruments need to be rather diverse. Some examples include the frequency response of the recording device and how to characterize it, the temperature-induced drift in recording clock frequency, and the reference voltage shift in the recorder Analog to Digital Converter (ADC). Another main point to be addressed is the traceability of measurements. A measurement of SPL, for example, is completely useless without knowing its relation to a known standard, such as 1 μPa or 20 μPa. Furthermore, those standards must themselves be traceable to some form of measurement standard, so that disparate measurements made in different environments by different people and equipment might be reasonably compared to one another. In the case of the frequency response of a recorder, a handy example would be that of a recorder which has as its input stage a series of filters, especially Sallen-Key filters. As these filters rely on capacitors of set values to create a filter, and on variable resistors to tune the corner frequency of the filter, any uncertainty in the values of the resistor and capacitor will translate into the uncertainty of the frequency response of the filter. Now add to this the fact that both capacitors and resistors change in their values with temperature, and the problem only gets worse when a recording device is placed outside, where most bioacoustic recordings are done. The temperature-induced drift in clock frequency is of particular concern to those doing any kind of localization work. Over the course of several months of recording, an induced error of several minutes to several hours can occur, and depending on the speed of sound within the recording medium, this can account for a localization error drift on the order of km to even Mm. Luckily, this effect is often reversible, but care must be taken to characterize the drift as a function of temperature, and the temperature of the recorder must be logged. Finally, the reference voltage drift in an ADC can be induced by either the temperature of the recorder changing, the source voltage in the recorder’s power source changing, or both. The effect of either of these causes is that the dynamic range of the recorder may be increased or decreased, thus changing the actual values of SPL which correlate to the output of the recorder data. This, too, is correctable, but only by re-characterization (and post-processing re-calibration) of the signal chain from transducer through ADC and into memory. In summary, there are many sources of uncertainty and error in bioacoustic recording devices, and in the protocols used to acquire data from them. The only way to begin to address this problem is to admit that it exists, then learn as much as possible about it...|$|E
40|$|Acoustic {{telemetry}} {{has been}} a dream of the drilling industry for the past 50 years. It offers the promise of data rates which are one-hundred times greater than existing technology. Such a system would {{open the door to}} true logging-while-drilling technology and bring enormous profits to its developers. The oil and gas industry has led in most of the attempts to develop this type of telemetry system; however, very substantial efforts have also been made through government sponsored work in the geothermal industry. None of these previous attempts have lead to a commercial telemetry system. Conceptually, the problem looks easy. The basic idea is to produce an encoded sound wave {{at the bottom of the}} well, let it propagate up the steel drillpipe, and extract the data from the signal at the surface. Unfortunately, substantial difficulties arise. The first difficult problem is to produce the sound wave. Since the most promising transmission wavelengths are about 20 feet, normal <b>transducer</b> <b>efficiencies</b> are quite low. Compounding this problem is the structural complexity of the bottomhole assembly and drillstring. For example, the acoustic impedance of the drillstring changes every 30 feet and produces an unusual scattering pattern in the acoustic transmission. This scattering pattern causes distortion of the signal and is often confused with signal attenuation. These problems are not intractable. Recent work has demonstrated that broad frequency bands exist which are capable of transmitting data at rates up to 100 bits per second. Our work has also identified the mechanism which is responsible for the observed anomalies in the patterns of signal attenuation. Furthermore in the past few years a body of experience has been developed in designing more efficient transducers for application to metal Waveguides. The direction of future work is clear. New transducer designs which are more efficient and compatible with existing downhole power supplies need to be built and tested; existing field test data need to be analyzed for transmission bandwidth and attenuation; and the new and less expensive methods of collecting data on transmission path quality need to be incorporated into this effort...|$|R

The <b>transducer's</b> conversion <b>efficiency</b> from the electrical to the acoustic domain was characterized optomechanically using single quantum dots acting as nanoscale pressure sensors. The ability to generate surface acoustic waves over a wide band of frequencies enables advanced acousto-optic spectroscopy using mode-locked lasers with fixed repetition rate.

40|$|One of the {{conceptual}} tensions between quantum mechanics (QM) and general relativity (GR) {{arises from the}} clash between the spatial nonseparability of entangled states in QM, and the complete spatial separability of all physical systems in GR, i. e., between nonlocality implied by the superposition principle, and locality implied by the equivalence principle. Experimental consequences of this conceptual tension for macroscopically coherent quantum objects, such as superconductors, superfluids, and atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, subjected to tidal and Lense-Thirring fields arising from gravitational radiation, will be explored. In particular, superconductors will be considered as macroscopic quantum gravitational antennas and transducers, which can directly convert upon reflection a beam of quadrupolar electromagnetic radiation into gravitational radiation, and vice versa, and thus serve as both sources and receivers of gravitational waves. An estimate of the <b>transducer</b> conversion <b>efficiency</b> {{on the order of}} unity comes out of the Ginzburg-Landau theory for an extreme type II, dissipationless superconductor with minimal coupling to weak gravitational and electromagnetic radiation fields, whose frequency is smaller than the BCS gap frequency, thus satisfying the quantum adiabatic theorem. The concept of ``the impedance of free space for gravitational plane waves'' is introduced, and leads to a natural impedance-matching process, in which the two kinds of radiation fields are impedance-matched to each other around a hundred coherence lengths {{beneath the surface of the}} superconductor. A simple, Hertz-like experiment has been performed to test these ideas, and preliminary results will be reported...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a conversion {{scheme based on}} active control for harvesting power from multiple piezoelectric <b>transducers</b> with higher <b>efficiency</b> than traditional passive approaches. The use of multiple sources is often mandatory for boosting up the available output power. The proposed approach guarantees that each source operates efficiently, especially in case of irregular vibrations and heterogeneous transducers. A prototype system was developed and validated in realistic conditions: three 0. 5 × 12. 7 × 31. 8  mm 3 Q 220 -A 4 - 303 YB transducers from Piezo Systems of different wear conditions loaded with 20 g tip masses were stimulated with the vibrations recorded in a train passenger car at 100  km/h. The converter harvested up to 142  μW@ 0. 22 g-RMS and up to 90  μW@ 0. 11 g-RMS. With the latter vibrations the extra harvested power {{with respect to a}} standard passive electronic interface was at least 41 %. The converter is modular and the number of sources can be easily increased...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental and computational {{study of the}} effect of severe inlet temperature distortion (hot streaks) on the efficiency of the MT 1 HP turbine, which is a highly-loaded unshrouded transonic design. The experiments were performed in the Oxford Turbine Research Facility (OTRF) (formerly the TTF at QinetiQ Farnborough) : an engine scale, short duration, rotating transonic facility, in which M, Re, and are matched to engine conditions. The research formed part of the EU Turbine Aero-Thermal External Flows (TATEF II) programme. An advanced second generation temperature distortion simulator was developed for this investigation, which allows both radial and circumferential temperature profiles to be simulated. A pronounced profile was used for this study. The system was novel in that it was designed to be compatible with an efficiency measurement system which was also developed for this study. To achieve low uncertainty (bias and precision errors of approximately 1. 5 per cent and 0. 2 per cent respectively, to 95 per cent confidence), the mass flow rate of the hot and cold streams used to simulate temperature distortion were independently metered upstream of the turbine nozzle using traceable measurement techniques. Turbine power was measured directly with an accurate torque <b>transducer.</b> The <b>efficiency</b> of the test turbine was evaluated experimentally for a uniform inlet temperature condition, and with pronounced temperature distortion. Mechanisms for observed changes in the turbine exit flow field and efficiency are discussed. The data are compared in terms of flow structure to full stage CFD performed using the Rolls Royce Hydra code. Copyright © 2011 by Rolls-Royce plc...|$|R
40|$|Weighted {{transducers}} {{provide a}} common representation for {{the components of}} a speech recognition system. In previous work, we showed that these components can be combined off-line into a single compact recognition transducer that maps directly HMM state sequences to word sequences [11]. The construction of that recognition <b>transducer</b> and its <b>efficiency</b> of use critically depend {{on the use of}} a general optimization algorithm, determinization. However, not all weighted automata and transducers used in largevocabulary speech recognition are determinizable. We present a general algorithm that can make an arbitrary weighted transducer determinizable and generalize our previous optimization technique for building an integrated recognition transducer to deal with arbitrary weighted transducers used in speech recognition. We report experimental results in a large-vocabulary speech recognition task, How May I Help You (HMIHY), showing that our generalized technique leads to a recognition transducer that performs as well as our original solution in the case of classical n-gram models while inserting less special symbols, and that it leads to a substantial improvement of the recognition speed, factor of 2. 6, in the same task when using a class-based language model...|$|R
40|$|Transducers made of thin {{magnetostrictive}} {{patches and}} magnetic circuits have been recently developed {{as an effective}} means for non-destructive guided wave inspection of elastic structures. However, important characteristics of transducers, such as their wave radiation patterns, have been tested only by experiments or a first-order theoretical analysis. There have been some finite element analyses related to magnetostrictive actuators, but no numerical analysis has been performed to predict the wave radiation patterns of various magnetostrictive patch transducers. In this paper, we formulate a finite element procedure and implement it to predict the wave radiation pattern of a magnetostrictive patch transducer installed on a plate. In particular, a linearized model determining coupling matrix appearing in the magnetostrictive constitutive equation of a magnetostrictive patch in a transducer is developed. The developed model is then used {{to deal with the}} arbitrarily polarized static magnetic field induced in the <b>transducers.</b> For numerical <b>efficiency,</b> time-harmonic analysis is carried out and a technique to extract data corresponding to target guided wave modes is used. The validity of the developed finite element analysis is checked by comparing the simulated wave radiation patterns from the present analysis with experimental results. The reasons why certain radiation patterns are obtained for selected magnetic circuits are explained by physical reasoning and simulation resultsclos...|$|R
