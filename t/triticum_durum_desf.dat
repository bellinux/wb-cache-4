40|$|Proline accumulation, as {{a marker}} of {{resistance}} to the abiotic constraints, was evaluated on seventeen genotypes of Durum wheat (<b>Triticum</b> <b>Durum</b> <b>Desf)</b> under water stress conditions. An experiment was implemented at INRAA research station located at Baraki, Algiers. The experimental design adopted is that of split plot design with water regime (irrigated and non irrigated treatments) as main plots and varieties as sub plots and three repetitions. Proline accumulation was significantly increased under water stress (p< 0. 01). There was differences between varieties and their interaction with water regimes (p< 0. 001) and 04 groups were identified. When plants are subjected to water stress they increase their rate of proline, this enables to improve the capacity of the cell to maintain it turgor pressure at low water potential.   Key words: Durum wheat (<b>Triticum</b> <b>durum</b> <b>Desf.),</b> Proline accumulation, resistance, water stress...|$|E

To provide additional information dedicated to durum elite pool, a recombinant inbred population (217 RILs) derived form 2 French commercial varieties (Ixos and Primadur), has been mapped with 529 loci (98 AFLPs, 67 SSRs, 1 ISBP and 363 DArTs). Genetic map spanned {{a total of}} 2, 082 cM (5. 7 cM/marker on average). Recombination rate variation over the genome was documented through the analysis of six segregating populations representing a total of 48 RILs x 6, issued from an half diallel design based on four elite lines-Neodur, Ixos, Lloyd and Primadur-including the 2 previous genitors. Each set of three genetically connected populations (48 RILs x 3) was used to build the consensus parental maps for each genitor. To construct the four consensus parental maps, marker ordering was determined on 217 RILs map which was an extended population of the most polymorphic cross (Ixos x Primadur). Sizeable, recombination rate variation has been observed between the four parental maps both at the marker pair scale and at the linkage group scale.

40|$|Chlorophyll {{molecules}} absorb photosynthetic active radiation (PAR). The resulting {{excitation energy}} is dissipated by three competing pathways {{at the level}} of photosystem: (i) photochemistry (and, by extension, photosynthesis); (ii) regulated and constitutive thermal energy dissipation; and (iii) chlorophyll-a fluorescence (ChlF). Because the dynamics of photosynthesis modulate the regulated component of thermal energy dissipation (widely addressed as non-photochemical quenching (NPQ)), the relationship between photosynthesis, NPQ and ChlF changes with water, nutrient and light availability. In this study we characterised the relationship between photosynthesis, NPQ and ChlF when conducting light-response curves of photosynthesis in plants growing under different water, nutrient and ambient light conditions. Our goals were to test whether ChlF and photosynthesis correlate in response to water and nutrient deficiency, and determine the optimum PAR level at which the correlation is maximal. Concurrent gas exchange and ChlF light-response curves were measured for Camelina sativa (L.) Crantz and <b>Triticum</b> <b>durum</b> (L.) <b>Desf</b> plants grown under (i) intermediate light growth chamber conditions, and (ii) high light environment field conditions respectively. Plant stress was induced by withdrawing water in the chamber experiment, and applying different nitrogen levels in the field experiment. Our study demonstrated that ChlF was able to track the variations in photosynthetic capacity in both experiments, and that the light level at which plants were grown was optimum for detecting both water and nutrient deficiency with ChlF. The decrease in photosynthesis was found to modulate ChlF via different mechanisms depending on the treatment: through the action of NPQ in response to water stress, or through the action of changes in leaf chlorophyll concentration in response to nitrogen deficiency. This study provides support for the use of remotely sensed ChlF as a proxy to monitor plant stress dynamics from space...|$|R

This study was conducted on the experimental site of station ITGC in Sétif, Algeria to determine the duration and velocity of filling and its relationships with yield components and chlorophyll content of ten durum wheat genotypes. The SPAD- 502 was used to measure the amount of chlorophyll (Chl) in the leaf, which is related to leaf greenness, by transmitting light from light emitting diodes (LED) through a leaf at wavelengths of 650 and 940 nm. Grain yield was negatively correlated with number of days to heading (DH) and positively with velocity of filling. The beginning of active phase of grain filling corresponded to the beginning of the degradation of chlorophyll content. The velocity of grain filling was negatively correlated to the number of days to heading (DH). Changes in photosynthesis most closely paralleled changes in chlorophyll content.

Twenty durum wheat genotypes, including 18 experimental lines and two local checks were evaluated during three cropping seasons (2004 – 2006) at five research sites. The combined analysis of variance indicated that the main effects of location and genotype and interaction effects of genotype × year, genotype × location and genotype × year × location were highly significant for grain yield. GE interaction was analyzed using linear regression techniques. There was considerable variation for grain yield among both genotypes and environments. Stability was estimated using the Eberhart and Russell method. Stability analysis of grain yield in different environments showed that the variance of genotypes and genotypes × environment (linear) interactions were significant. Due to the stability analysis, genotype 12 (D 68 - 1 - 93 A- 1 A//Ruff/Fg/ 3 /Mtl- 5 / 4 /Lahn) indicated relatively minimum value for S 2 d and a b-value close to unity and hence, it may be considered stable for grain yield in all of the environments.

Our study showed a decrease of SOC stocks in both sites and tillage systems over CF when compared with CP. At the AN site, CT lost − 7. 3 % and NT − 7. 9 % of SOC stock (0 – 40 cm) under CF.
