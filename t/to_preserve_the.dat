5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{unsuccessful}} attempt {{to save the}} Star Ferry pier in early 2007, a campaign <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>the</b> pier in situ was launched. Ahead of the closure, members of the public, environmentalists, and some lawmakers arrived to tie blue ribbons to indicate their desire <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>the</b> harbour. On 22 April, about 100 protesters once again rallied at the pier, launching farewell voyages in a last-ditch attempt to urge the Government to reconsider: a petition of over 400 signatures from the Arts community was collected.|$|E
5|$|Aerial {{operations}} for the incursion {{got off to a}} slow start. Reconnaissance flights over the operational area were restricted since MACV believed that they might serve as a signal of intention. The role of the Air Force in the planning for the incursion itself was minimal at best, in part <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>the</b> secrecy of Menu which was then considered an overture to the thrust across the border.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1990s, the Conservancy worked <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>the</b> San Clemente Island goat, a rare Spanish-descended breed from California. In 1991, it added genetic {{material}} from the San Clemente to their genetic database, later transferred to the National Animal Germplasm Program. As of June 2010, the organization {{was working on the}} rescue of a group of feral Spanish goats from an island in South Carolina. There are less than 2,500 members of the breed in the United States, and the island group is one of only two bloodlines known to exist in the southeastern US. Conservancy members first made trips to the island to document and photograph the herd of around 30 goats, then undertook action to remove some goats from the island <b>to</b> <b>preserve</b> <b>the</b> bloodlines from threatened extinction. A small flock was established in a nature preserve just south of Murrells Inlet, South Carolina, and as of June 2010 plans were in place for satellite herds to be established.|$|E
