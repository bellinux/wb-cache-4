The EMMM’s rationale, development, operationalization, analysis, and exploratory nature are discussed, and evidence is provided for the divergent and convergent validity of its items.

5|$|After nearly 30 {{years of}} {{struggling}} with funding and pursuing various deals, William Beardsley hired engineer Carl Pleasant {{to assist with}} designing. Pleasant recommended hiring the engineer firm Peckham and James to draft plans for the storage dam at the Frogs Tank site.

In 1925, under a new state law, Beardsley was able to create the Beardsley-Agua Fria Water Conservation District. Under the new district, funds could be raised through a bond issue. On December 20, 1925, the construction contract was signed, but the bonds {{had yet to be}} purchased. Five days before the contract was signed, Beardsley died.

It also appeared unlikely that the country would receive <b>the</b> <b>needed</b> foreign investment. The country had a deficit of $6.7billion.

The Tech defense stiffened, forcing a fourth down at the two-yard line.

This {{dissertation}} aims {{to explore}} <b>the</b> <b>needs</b> of <b>the</b> Young Adults Group in the Lutheran Church, Hayfields, Pieterrnaritzburg. Focus groups {{were conducted with}} young adults to establish their <b>needs.</b> During <b>the</b> three months of data collection, group dynamics were also observed, and at the focus groups, specific focus group dynamics were detected. The focus group interactions were recorded and transcribed. Using thematic analysis, the transcribed data was encoded using existing codes based on Maslow's hierarchy of needs, and analysed. Twelve themes of <b>needs</b> emerged from <b>the</b> data. These were: i) physiological needs; ii) safety needs; iii) <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for acceptance and love {{and the absence of}} judgement; iv) <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to be understood - by others and the church; v) <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to be valued and appreciated; vi) <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to have fun; vii) <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for nature; viii) <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to delay life's pace and prioritise; ix) <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to grow spiritually - as individuals and as church; x) <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for a spiritual outlet and expression of one's spirituality; xi) <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to be used by God for a specific purpose; xii) <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for assurance from God. Using these needs, a framework for a programme was developed. All the guidelines and exercises suggested in the programme aim to promote growth - spiritual, emotional, and personaJ - and focus on fulfilling the individual's potential within the group...|$|R

The Seminoles returned the kickoff to their 22-yard line, and on the first play {{of the second half}} attempted a lateral pass. Virginia Tech defender Corey Moore knocked the ball down and out of bounds, causing a loss of 16 yards. Despite the loss, Weinke was able to make good <b>the</b> <b>needed</b> yards with a 28-yard pass to Minor. Minor picked up short yardage on a run up the middle, then Weinke passed for another first down, advancing the ball to the State 45-yard line. On first down, Weinke fumbled, but managed to recover the ball after a five-yard loss. Unlike before, State was unable to regain the lost yardage and was forced to punt. Virginia Tech returned the kick to their 33-yard line, where the Tech offense began work.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of these}} and other successes, Lowe was {{authorized}} to build four additional balloons and <b>the</b> <b>needed</b> inflation equipment. However, Lowe's initial successes proved difficult to recreate in field conditions, and aside from limited successes, such as at the Battle of Seven Pines, the utility of the Balloon Corps was limited. In addition, jurisdictional squabbles arose between Lowe's civilian command and the military officers under whom he worked. By early 1863, Lowe had grown tired of dealing with military minutia and left the Corps, returning to civilian research. The Balloon Corps fell to the command of less-capable individuals and was eventually eliminated in August 1863.|$|E

Fifty Southern Democrats, upset at the convention's refusal to include slavery protection in the party's platform, {{walked out of the}} convention; the remaining delegates decided that nominations required a two-thirds majority of the original 303 delegates.
