Nokian Heavy Tyres Ltd is {{a manufacturer of}} special tyres for forestry, industrial machinery, and agriculture. Its products are sold as original equipment as well on the replacement tyre market. Nokian Tyres produces a number of product lines, including the Tractor Industrial 2 and Country King. Nokian Tyres is a world market leader in forestry tyres, which are a key product of the Nokian Heavy Tyres subsidiary. Nokian forestry tyres include the Skidder and Cut-To-Length model lines. The Skidder tyres have a 25 degree bar angle and the Cut-To-Length tyres have a 35 degree bar angle. Bar angle is a tyre tread measurement. Smaller bar angles are associated with higher traction {{at the expense of}} increased mud accumulation.|$|R

50|$|At {{the city}} end, the O-Bahn begins at Hackney Road, {{opposite}} the East Parklands, where it enters a 60-metre tunnel {{at a speed}} limited to 40 km/h, due to the tight initial corner, ensuring that the rear <b>tyres</b> (especially <b>trailer</b> <b>tyres</b> of articulated buses) do not 'scrub' against the track. Speed is gradually increased to 80 km/h {{for most of the}} trip to Klemzig Interchange. Once en route to Paradise Interchange, the speed limit was up to 100 km/h, but has been limited to 85 km/h since late 2012. On some sections 115 km/h was achieved in tests. The average service speed including stops is about 60 km/h. On entering interchanges the O-Bahn ends and the speed limit is 40 km/h. In the interchange area, the speed limit is 20 km/h. The O-Bahn is officially considered a road, due to a court ruling {{in the early years of}} the system's operation. This ruling permits the South Australia Police to install speed cameras and fine speeding drivers.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of the}} LORRY {{project is}} to reduce carbon {{footprint}} of truck transportation by developing an innovative low Rolling Resistance (RR) tyre concept combined with a comprehensive toolbox for fl¬eet fuel saving management. The ambition is that steering and <b>trailer</b> <b>tyres</b> developed {{in the framework of}} the project must demonstrate a minimum 20 % reduction in truck tyre rolling resistance, which corresponds approximatively to a reduction of 5 % in fuel consumption and CO 2 emission. Truck tyre wear (10 % improvement) and wet safety performance levels will also be additionally improved. This proposed concept is going beyond current state of art and stakeholder or market expectations regarding tyre rolling resistance, mileage, driving safety, driving performance and material and manufacturing sustainability. To reach this objective, a multidisciplinary approach has been initiated covering the fields of tyre technology, rubber and filler technology, nanotechnologies, composite physics, sensory, transport and road infrastructure. A complete set of complementary scientific evaluation methods enable the understanding of interactions between new tread pattern design and new material composites as well as the tyre performance dependency on tyre-vehicle operation and road conditions. Main novelties from this project are: Design of new tread pattern, Development of advancement nano-structured truck tyre compounds, Enhanced characterization through predictive tools: new testing methods and models, phenomena understanding at multi-scale and development of related predictive experimental and virtual analysis tools, Assessment of tyre performance – field evaluation, Analysis and modelisation of tyre performance...|$|R
2500|$|Truck offerings {{remained}} continuously creative {{including a}} Simca glass {{truck with a}} sheet of [...] "glass" [...] (clear plastic) and a mirror (polished aluminium), a Leyland Octopus flatbed truck complete with realistic chain around the bed, a car carrier with a car carrying <b>trailer,</b> a Dunlop <b>tyre</b> rack full of tyres, a Berliet truck hauling an electrical transformer, and an intricately detailed Brockway bridgelaying truck. One of the most astounding was the Mighty Antar truck hauling a large gold ship's propeller. A wide variety of military vehicles continued under production.|$|R
50|$|The Bobby Car {{was invented}} {{in order to help}} {{children}} learn to walk. It has a kind of seat in which the child can sit as on a motorcycle. By swinging its legs, the child can move the car. Today, numerous accessories exist such as connecting rods, light running <b>tyres,</b> <b>trailer</b> and so on. As well as being manufactured in different colours, it also comes in variants such as a police car or tow truck. Special editions have been made to honour well-known German cars, such as Mercedes-Benz SLK, Audi TT, Smart and Volkswagen Beetle. In cooperation with tyre manufacturer Fulda, a model having real tyres, rather than the usual hard plastic variety was produced.|$|R
50|$|The barrels {{and their}} cradles were transported on trains to Saint Malo {{and one at}} a time put on a barge to Saint Peter Port Harbour Guernsey. A large 100 ton Dutch {{floating}} crane was towed from Le Havre, it was needed to lift each 51 ton barrel and breach and 38 ton mounting from the barge onto a <b>trailer</b> with 48 <b>tyres</b> on 12 steerable axles. This trailer, carrying just one piece of a gun was then pulled 8 km at walking speed using four heavy Sd.Kfz. 8 half-tracks connected in line to the battery site. Preparations for the transport in Guernsey included taking trees down with several junctions having walls demolished so that the convoy could avoid sharp corners. 75 ton gantries would lift the guns into their emplacements.|$|R
50|$|Australian road {{transport}} {{has a reputation}} for using very large trucks and road trains. This is reflected in the most popular configurations of trucks generally having dual drive axles and three axles on the <b>trailers,</b> with four <b>tyres</b> on each axle. This means that Australian single semi-trailer trucks will usually have 22 tyres, which is generally more than their counterparts in other countries. Super single tyres are sometimes used on tri-axle trailers. The suspension is designed with travel limiting, which will hold the rim off the road for one blown or deflated tyre for each side of the trailer, so a trailer can be driven at reduced speed to a safe place for repair. Super singles are also often used on the steer axle in Australia to allow greater loading over the steer axle. The increase in loading of steer tyres requires a permit.|$|R
5000|$|The {{technical}} {{challenges to}} implement rolling highways vary from region to region. In North America, the loading gauge is often {{high enough to}} accommodate double stack containers, so {{the height of a}} truck on a flat car is no issue. However, in Europe, except for purpose built lines such as the Channel Tunnel or the Gotthard Base Tunnel, the loading gauge height is much smaller, and it is necessary to transport the <b>trailers</b> with the <b>tyres</b> about 30 cm above the rails, so the trailers cannot be simply parked on a deck above the wagon wheels. Making the wagon wheels smaller limits the maximum speed, so many designs allow the trailer to be transported with its wheels lower than the rail wagon wheels. An early approach in France was the kangourou with modified trailers. This technology did not survive, due to the market resistance to modified trailers. Today two designs for these special wagons are in commercial service, [...] "Modalohr" [...] and [...] "Cargobeamer".|$|R
5000|$|Dinky offerings at {{this time}} were striking, but {{due to the lack}} of much competition, {{development}} of new models was perhaps a bit slow at least until July 1956, when Mettoy introduced a rival line of models under the Corgi brand name. The most obvious difference was the addition of clear plastic window glazing. While Corgi Toys called their vehicles, [...] "The Ones With Windows", Meccano Ltd responded by updating the Dinky Toys range and the models from both companies quickly became more and more sophisticated featuring such things as working suspension, [...] "fingertip steering", detailed interiors, and jewelled headlights. The first model to have jewelled headlights was the no. 196 Holden Special sedan made from 1963-1969. Truck offerings remained continuously creative including a Simca glass truck with a sheet of [...] "glass" [...] (clear plastic) and a mirror (polished aluminium), a Leyland Octopus flatbed truck complete with realistic chain around the bed, a car carrier with a car carrying <b>trailer,</b> a Dunlop <b>tyre</b> rack full of tyres, a Berliet truck hauling an electrical transformer, and an intricately detailed Brockway bridgelaying truck.
