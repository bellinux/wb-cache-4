40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} {{the effectiveness of}} the diatomaceous earth against Helix aspersa by contact and ingestion with sprinkling and powdering treatments “in vitro”. Settings and Design: Assays with completely randomized designs with five treatments and four replicates were carried out. The treatments were three doses of diatomaceous earth (at 1 kg / ha, 2 kg / ha, 4 kg / ha), agricultural lime at 2 kg / ha and one control. Methods and Material: In the assays adults of Helix aspersa Müller fed with lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) were used. The percentage of mortality, effect on mobility and shell affectation were determined with the <b>treatments</b> <b>by</b> <b>sprinkling</b> and powdering both contact and ingestion. Statistical analysis used: The data were transformed into 2 arcsin √...|$|R
