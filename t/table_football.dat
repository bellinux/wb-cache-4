2500|$|The Metodo was {{devised by}} Vittorio Pozzo, {{coach of the}} Italy {{national}} team in the 1930s. It was a derivation of the Danubian School. The system {{was based on the}} 2–3–5 formation; Pozzo realised that his half-backs would need some more support in order to be superior to the opponents' midfield, so he pulled two of the forwards to just in front of midfield, creating a 2–3–2–3 formation. This created a stronger defence than previous systems, as well as allowing effective counter-attacks. The Italian national team won back-to-back World Cups in 1934 and 1938 using this system. It has been argued that Pep Guardiola's Barcelona and Bayern Munich used a modern version of this formation. This formation is also similar to the standard in <b>table</b> <b>football,</b> featuring two defenders, five midfielders and three strikers (which cannot be altered as the [...] "players" [...] are mounted on axles).|$|E
