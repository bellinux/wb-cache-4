In March Mauer left Smart for Saab, succeeded by Hartmut Sinkwitz in May. As the third design director of Smart during the Roadster's development, Sinkwitz {{had to bring}} the concept to production {{in a very short}} time. This task may have been made somewhat easier by the Roadster having been designed from the start to use existing powertrain and other City Coupe components. Given some of the advanced design features, it is a credit to the design team <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the concept car made it to production.|$|E

500|$|During Brown's premiership, in October 2008, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) {{recommended}} to the then Home Secretary Jacqui Smith that cannabis remain {{classified as a}} Class C drug. Acting {{against the advice of}} the Council, she chose to reclassify it as Class B. After Professor David Nutt, the chair of the ACMD, criticised this move in a lecture in 2009, he was asked to step down by then Home Secretary Alan Johnson. Following his resignation, Professor Nutt said Brown had [...] "made up his mind" [...] to reclassify cannabis despite evidence to the contrary. Brown had argued, [...] "I don't think that the previous studies took into account <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the cannabis on the streets is now of a lethal quality and we really have got to send out a message to young people—this is not acceptable". Professor Nutt's predecessor at the ACMD, Sir Michael Rawlins, later said, [...] "Governments may well have good reasons for taking an alternative view... When that happens, then the government should explain why it's ignoring the particular advice".|$|E
500|$|The {{dramatic}} {{feature film}} Rosewood (1997), directed by John Singleton, {{was based on}} these historic events. Minnie Lee Langley served {{as a source for}} the set designers, and Arnett Doctor was hired as a consultant. Recreated forms of the towns of Rosewood and Sumner were built in Central Florida, far away from Levy County. The film version, written by screenwriter Gregory Poirier, created a character named Mann, who enters Rosewood as a type of reluctant Western-style hero. Composites of historic figures were used as characters, and the film offers the possibility of a happy ending. E.R. Shipp in The New York Times suggests that Singleton's youth and his background in California contributed to his willingness to take on the story of Rosewood. She notes Singleton's rejection of the image of black people as victims and portrayal of [...] "an idyllic past in which black families are intact, loving and prosperous, and a black superhero who changes the course of history when he escapes the noose, takes on the mob with double-barreled ferocity and saves many women and children from death". Singleton has offered his view: [...] "I had a very deep—I wouldn't call it fear—but a deep contempt for the South because I felt <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the horror and evil that black people have faced in this country is rooted here... So in some ways this is my way of dealing with the whole thing." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{separate}} review for the song, Levine rated it {{three out of}} five stars, and wrote [...] "in spite of its predictability, 'I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time' still makes for a satisfying listen, sounding classy, effortless and as summery as a glass of rosé in the garden after a work." [...] Journalist for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK), Svein Terje Torvik described the song as [...] "One of the album's best cuts", while Fox News writer Roger Friedman wrote [...] "its just enough of a new twist to create the most elusive thing of all: a radio smash. Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine chose the song {{as one of his}} [...] "top picks" [...] from E=MC², and wrote [...] "it has a lightness <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the album lacks." [...] Richard Cromelin from the Los Angeles Times highlighted Carey's unadorned and raw form of singing in the song, writing [...] "her singing is so direct, understated and unglamorous it's almost shocking -- like seeing a diva without makeup." [...] Margeauz Watsman from Entertainment Weekly called the song a [...] "dance-floor anthem", while PopMatters Evan Sawdey described it as [...] "certainly worthy of some greatest-hits canonization". Slant Magazine editor Sal Cinquemani felt [...] "I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time" [...] was a [...] "stroke of genius", and wrote [...] " [...] sounds like a hyperventilating cross between a graduation anthem and an early-'80s family sitcom theme song. Listening to it, I felt {{face to face with a}} couple of silver spoons: one heroin, the other grape jelly." ...|$|E

[...] Weitzenhoffer adds that Bandler and Grinder misuse formal logic and mathematics, redefine or misunderstand terms from the linguistics lexicon (e.g., nominalization), create a scientific façade by needlessly complicating Ericksonian concepts with unfounded claims, make factual errors, [...] and disregard or confuse concepts central to the Ericksonian approach.|$|E

He also found {{returning}} to the stage difficult because of his long departure.

2500|$|Geologists use {{the term}} {{continent}} in a different manner from geographers, where a continent is defined by continental crust: a platform of metamorphic and igneous rock, largely of granitic composition. Some geologists restrict the term 'continent' to portions of the crust built around stable Precambrian [...] "shield", typically 1.5 to 3.8 billion years old, called a craton. The craton itself is an accretionary complex of ancient mobile belts (mountain belts) from earlier cycles of subduction, continental collision and break-up from plate tectonic activity. An outward-thickening veneer of younger, minimally deformed sedimentary rock covers much of the craton. The margins of geologic continents are characterized by currently active or relatively recently active mobile belts and deep troughs of accumulated marine or deltaic sediments. Beyond the margin, there is either a continental shelf and drop off to the basaltic ocean basin or the margin of another continent, depending on the current plate-tectonic setting of the continent. A continental boundary {{does not have to}} be a body of water. Over geologic time, continents are periodically submerged under large epicontinental seas, and continental collisions result in a continent becoming attached to another continent. The current geologic era is relatively anomalous in <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the continental areas are [...] "high and dry"; that is, many parts of the continents that were once below sea level are now elevated well above it due to changes in sea levels and the subsequent uplifting of those continental areas from tectonic activity.|$|E

Irwin performed [...] "Teardrops on My Guitar" [...] {{with the famous}} country singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. [...] After the song, Swift was asked, based on her experience as a teenage Country Music singer, what advice she would offer to Irwin. In reply, Swift commented:... She Irwin has such an adorable personality, and <b>that's</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> the battle right there. You know, being so endearing and so so humble.

2500|$|In 2013 a {{class action}} lawsuit was filed against Facebook alleging the company scanned user {{messages}} for web links, translating them to “likes” on the user’s Facebook profile. Data lifted from the private messages was then used for targeted advertising, the plaintiffs claimed. [...] "Facebook's practice of scanning the content of these messages violates the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA {{also referred to as}} the Wiretap Act), as well as California's Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA), and section 17200 of California's Business and Professions Code," [...] the plaintiffs said. This shows that once information is online it is no longer completely private. [...] It is an increasing risk because younger people are having easier internet access than ever before, therefore they put themselves in a position where it is all too easy for them to upload information, but they may not have the caution to consider how difficult it can be to take that information down once it is out in the open. [...] This is becoming a bigger issue now <b>that</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>of</b> society interacts online which was not the case fifteen years ago. [...] In addition, because of the quickly evolving digital media arena, people's interpretation of privacy is evolving as well, and {{it is important to consider}} that when interacting online. [...] New forms of social networking and digital media such as Instagram and Snapchat may call for new guidelines regarding privacy. [...] What makes this difficult is the wide range of opinions surrounding the topic, so it is left mainly up to our judgement to respect other people's online privacy in some circumstances. [...] Sometimes it may be necessary to take extra precautions in situations where somebody else may have a tighter view on privacy ethics. [...] No matter the situation it is beneficial to know about the potential consequences and issues that can come from careless activity on social networks.|$|E
