40|$|Abstract Background Embryonic {{stem cells}} (ESCs) are {{pluripotent}} stem cells and can form tumors containing cells from all three germ layers. Similarities between {{pluripotent stem cells}} and malignant tumor cells have been identified. The {{purpose of this study}} was to obtain ESCs-converted tumor cell lines and to investigate the mechanism of malignancy in pluripotent stem cells. Methods Mouse ESCs were subcutaneously injected into nude mice to obtain tumors from which a tumor-like cell line (ECCs 1) was established by culturing the cells in chemical-defined N 2 B 27 medium supplied with two small molecular inhibitors CHIR 99021 and PD 0325901 (2 i). <b>The</b> <b>ECCs</b> 1 were then subcutaneously injected into nude mice again to obtain tumors from which another tumor-like cells line (ECCs 2) was established in the same 2 i medium. The malignant degree of ESCs, ECCs 1 and ECCs 2 was compared and the underlying mechanism involved in the malignancy development of ESCs was examined. Results <b>The</b> three ESCs, <b>ECCs</b> 1 and ECCs 2 cell lines were cultured in the same 2 i condition and showed some likeness such as Oct 4 -expression and long-term expansion ability. However, the morphology and the tumor-formation ability of the cell lines were different. We identified that ECCs 1 and ECCs 2 gradually acquired malignancy. Moreover, Wnt signaling-related genes such as CD 133 and β-catenin expression were up-regulated and Frizzled related protein (FRP) was down-regulated during the tumor development of ESCs. Conclusions The two tumor-like cell lines ECCs 1 and ECCs 2 stand for early malignant development stage of ESCs and <b>the</b> <b>ECCs</b> 2 was more malignant than <b>the</b> <b>ECCs</b> 1. Moreover, we identified that Wnt/β-catenin signaling played an important role in the malignancy process of ESCs. </p...|$|R

40|$|Conventional error {{correcting}} code (ECC) schemes used in {{memories and}} caches cannot correct double bit errors caused by a single event upset (SEU). As memory density increases, multiple bit upsets in nearby cells become more frequent. A methodology is proposed here for deriving an {{error correcting code}} through heuristic search that can detect and correct the most likely double bit errors in a memory while minimizing the miscorrection probability of the unlikely double bit errors. A key feature of <b>the</b> proposed <b>ECC</b> is that it uses {{the same number of}} check bits as the conventional single error correcting/double error detecting (SEC-DED) codes commonly used, and has nearly identical syndrome generator/encoder area and timing overhead. Hence, there is very little additional cost to using <b>the</b> proposed <b>ECC.</b> <b>The</b> proposed <b>ECC</b> can be used instead of or in addition to bit interleaving to provide greater flexibility for optimizing a memory layout and/or provide better protection from multiple bit upsets. It is also useful for small memories, e. g., content addressable memory or register files, where interleaving is not possible. 1...|$|R
