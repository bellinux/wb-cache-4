25|$|Red Storm Rising is a 1986 technothriller {{novel by}} <b>Tom</b> <b>Clancy</b> about a Third World War in Europe between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Warsaw Pact forces, set around the mid-1980s. Though other novels {{deal with a}} fictional World War III, this one is notable for {{the way in which}} {{numerous}} settings for the action—from Atlantic convoy duty to shooting down reconnaissance satellites to an amphibious assault on Iceland to tank battles in Germany—all have an integral part to play on the outcome. It was also unusual in its depiction of a World War III fought exclusively with conventional weapons, rather than escalating to the use {{of weapons of mass destruction}} or nuclear warfare.|$|E

25|$|Ethnic {{folk music}} from other {{countries}} also had a boom during the American folk revival.

Paddy Clancy also started and ran the folk-music label Tradition Records, which produced Odetta's first solo LP and initially brought Carolyn Hester to national prominence. Pete Seeger played the banjo on their Grammy-nominated 1961 album, A Spontaneous Performance Recording, and Bob Dylan later cited the group as a major influence on him. The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem also sparked a folk-music boom in Ireland in the mid-1960s, illustrating the world-wide effects of the American folk-music revival.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{the success}} of Metal Gear Solid, and to an extent Tenchu and Thief, stealth {{elements}} have become increasingly incorporated by a wide range of video games, with numerous action games since then using stealth elements in some way or another. 2002 saw the first installment of the <b>Tom</b> <b>Clancy</b> licensed Splinter Cell series, an attempt at a more realistic game in the vein of Metal Gear. As with Metal Gear, if the player is discovered in Splinter Cell, the guards will often raise a general alarm. This can cause a difficulty spike or even result in automatic mission failure. [...] Splinter Cell was notable for its state of the art graphics, including dynamic lighting and shadows. These effects not only contributed to the atmosphere of the game, but dynamically affected in which areas the player could hide. The 2004 sequel, , added a multiplayer component to the stealth genre.|$|E

[...] In the 1978 novel Cold is the Sea by Edward L. Beach, the second sequel to his 1955 best-seller Run Silent, Run Deep, Triton is mentioned several times. Also, the under-ice towing capability that was considered for Triton served as a key plot point for the novel. [...] Finally, in The Hunt for Red October by <b>Tom</b> <b>Clancy,</b> the biographical background for Marko Ramius mentions that, while commanding a Charlie-class submarine, Ramius had [...] "hounded [...] mercilessly for twelve hours" [...] in the Norwegian Sea. Subsequently, Ramius [...] "would note with no small satisfaction that the Triton was soon thereafter retired, because, it was said, the oversized vessel had proven unable to deal with the newer Soviet designs." ...|$|E
500|$|Jon Favreau {{was hired}} to direct the film in April 2006, celebrating getting the job by going on a diet, losing [...] Favreau had {{wanted to work with}} Marvel {{producer}} Avi Arad on another film after they both worked on Daredevil. The director found the opportunity to create a politically ambitious [...] "ultimate spy movie" [...] in Iron Man, citing inspiration from <b>Tom</b> <b>Clancy,</b> James Bond, and RoboCop, and compared his approach to an independent film—"f Robert Altman had directed Superman"—and Batman Begins. Favreau wanted to make Iron Man a story of an adult man literally reinventing himself after discovering the world is far more complex than he originally believed. He changed the Vietnam War origin of the character to Afghanistan, as {{he did not want to}} do a period piece. Art Marcum & Matt Holloway were hired to write the script, while Mark Fergus & Hawk Ostby wrote another version, with Favreau compiling both teams' scripts, and John August then [...] "polishing" [...] the combined version. Comic book staff Mark Millar, Brian Michael Bendis, Joe Quesada, Tom Brevoort, Axel Alonso, and Ralph Macchio were also called upon by Favreau to give advice on the script.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{features}} a 2.5-minute {{rendition of the}} song [...] "Shipoopi" [...] from the 1957 musical The Music Man, conducted by Peter and performed by the Patriots {{and people in the}} stadium. The rendition was directed by Dan Povenmire, who would later go on to co-create Phineas and Ferb with fellow Family Guy worker Jeff [...] "Swampy" [...] Marsh. The original number in The Music Man was performed by around 40 or 50 singers and around 80 other musicians, as estimated by MacFarlane. Family Guys rendition was recorded by an orchestra not as large as the original's, but one of the largest the show has ever used. Another musical number, in which the London Silly Nannies sing while dancing around a maypole, was taken from the Gilbert and Sullivan production The Sorcerer. A visual joke that shows Peter's $30,000 wax sculpture of Harriet Tubman [...] "doing" [...] a naked Gwyneth Paltrow originally featured the droid R2-D2 from Star Wars in place of Tubman.
