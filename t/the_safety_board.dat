5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> {{believes}} that the flight crew of Flight 405 should have taken more positive steps to assure a contamination-free wing, such as entering the cabin {{to look at the}} wing from a closer range. Although <b>the</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> acknowledges that the detection of minimal amounts of contamination, sufficient to cause aerodynamic performance problems, is difficult and may not be possible without a tactile inspection, an observation from the cabin would have improved the chance of seeing some contamination and might have prompted the flight crew to return to the gate. <b>The</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> {{believes that}} the flight crew’s failure to take such precautions and the decision to attempt takeoff while unsure of wing cleanliness led to this accident and is a cause of it.|$|E

After his death, his parents Kevin and Susan Campbell investigated the cause of the decompression independently of the NTSB. The Campbells' investigation led them to conclude that the cause of the incident was not human error but instead the combination of an electrical problem and an inadequate design of the aircraft's cargo door latching mechanism.

In view of these facts, <b>the</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Board</b> believes that all emergency response organizations should review their emergency plans to include contingencies for applying cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) techniques as soon as a sufficient number of trained personnel arrive to perform CPR, even during mass casualty/triage incidents, regardless of whether vital signs are present, especially if cold-water immersion/near drowning is involved and where traumatic injuries do not indicate death.|$|E

Although, when the cockpit was examined, the engine anti-ice switch was found in the 'OFF' position, further investigations found that even slight pressure could move the switch, and the NTSB ruled this out as a contributing factor in the crash. Following the accident, USAir sent out a maintenance directive ordering engine anti-ice switches to be changed on F28s so they would lock into a selected position.|$|E

5000|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of this}} crash was the motorcoach driver’s mistaking the HOV-only left exit ramp to Northside Drive for the southbound Interstate 75 HOV through lane.

Contributing to the severity of the crash was the motorcoach’s lack of an adequate occupant protection system.Major safety issues identified in this crash include inadequate HOV traffic control devices, inadequate motor carrier driver oversight, lack of event data recorders on motorcoaches, and lack of motorcoach occupant protection.
