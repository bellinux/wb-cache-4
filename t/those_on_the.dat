5|$|The kerb-stones {{around the}} tomb display some patterning; <b>those</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{northern}} side are mostly rectilinear, while <b>those</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> southern side are smaller and largely irregular in shape. It {{is probable that}} there was an ancillary dry-stone wall constructed using blocks of ironstone from the geological Folkestone beds, as is evident at Chestnuts Long Barrow. Given that such blocks of stone rarely occur naturally, it may have been quarried.|$|E

5|$|Although Dean {{was still}} a {{hurricane}} and was expected to re-strengthen slightly before making its second landfall, {{the fact that it}} had weakened caused some residents to let down their guard.

5|$|Both Edmundston and Rimouski were {{fitted with}} about 60 light projectors: <b>those</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hull were on {{retractable}} supports; <b>those</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> superstructure were on fixed supports. Each ship's diffused lighting system was tested systematically in St Margaret's Bay, and then trialled when actually escorting Atlantic convoys in 1943. Experimentally, the diffused lighting reduced the ships' visibility {{by up to}} 70%, but at sea the electrical equipment proved too delicate, and frequently malfunctioned. Worse, the system was slow to respond to changes in background lighting, and the Canadian Navy considered the lighting too green.|$|E
5|$|Geomorphologically, the {{mountain}} is a mesa-like outlier, {{that is to}} say, {{the remains of a}} plateau that has been otherwise eroded to leave only a single pillar of rock - weaker or fractured rocks (the so-called Jasneuf fault) between the current summit and the Vercors high plateau were eroded over time by over 400 metres, leaving the peak standing on its own. This has resulted in several unique features of Mont Aiguille, including the cliffs, which are almost identical to <b>those</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eastern edge of the Vercors Plateau such as <b>those</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> edge of the Grand Veymont, which is the highest point of the range. Another feature resulting from this is the presence of meadows on the summit plateau, which are similar to those to the west {{on the rest of the}} Vercors plateau.|$|E

5|$|The route {{begins at}} I-5 near the Mexican border {{in a far}} south part of San Ysidro, a {{neighborhood}} of San Diego. As it starts its journey northward, it quickly has a junction with State Route905 (SR905) before exiting the city of San Diego and entering Chula Vista. Within the past 20years the freeway has delineated the apparent divide {{between rich and poor}} in the city of Chula Vista; <b>those</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> eastern side of the freeway have been more affluent and have better schools compared to <b>those</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> western side. Just outside the city, I-805 meets County Route S17 (CRS17), also named Bonita Road, before coming to an interchange with SR54. The freeway then enters National City, where it intersects Sweetwater Road and Plaza Boulevard, before leaving the city and reentering the city of San Diego.|$|E
5|$|The scales {{along the}} lips of the snake are called labials. <b>Those</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> upper lip are called supralabials or upper labials, while <b>those</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> lower lip are called infralabials or lower labials. On top of the head, between the eyes, {{adjacent}} to the supraoculars is the frontal scale. The prefrontal scales are the scales connected to the frontal towards {{the tip of the}} snout which are in contact with the internasals. They may have a scale in between them. The back of {{the top of the head}} has scales connected to the frontal scale called the parietal scales. At the sides of the back of the head between the parietals above and the supralabials below are scales called temporal scales.|$|E

5|$|A new aft-loaded shape which {{produced}} lift across {{most of the}} upper wing surface, instead of a narrow band as in previous airfoil designs, {{was used for the}} 757's wings. The more efficient wings had less drag and greater fuel capacity, and were similar in configuration to <b>those</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 767. A wider wingspan than the 727's produced less lift-induced drag, while larger wing roots increased undercarriage storage space and provided room for future stretched versions of the aircraft.|$|E

5|$|A {{survey in}} 1454, {{undertaken}} {{against the background}} of another French invasion scare, shows that the 1377 system for maintaining the walls was still in operation. A town gunner had also been appointed by the 15th century, earning the highest salary of any local official and was responsible for maintaining the guns and manufacturing gunpowder. As late as the mid-16th century, additional improved rectangular gunports, similar to <b>those</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Device Forts along the Channel, were added to the West Gate by the quays.|$|E
5|$|As a defence {{against the}} cold, {{a colony of}} emperor {{penguins}} forms a compact huddle (also known as the turtle formation) {{ranging in size from}} ten to several hundred birds, with each bird leaning forward on a neighbour.
