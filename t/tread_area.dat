Re-calibration matrices are created with datasets that were generated under static and experimental treadmill operation and are assessed on validation datasets. No relationship was determined between the treadmill’s dynamics and the GRF and CoP errors. The dynamic re-calibration resulted in lower root-mean-square GRF and CoP errors than the static re-calibration did and was more rapid to calculate.

The experiments focused on plastic deformation and wear caused by rolling contact and tread braking. The presented results show that the maximum tread depression is 0. 20 mm at the rolling contact center after 40 times stop braking actions. This is considered to be caused by plastic deformation of the wheel tread induced by high contact pressure and material softening due to high temperatures from tread braking.

My title, Dooryard Bloom is a play of words on Whitman's title. A dooryard is defined as the yard next to the door of a house... which in this poem could mean many things... is the yard the hereafter? Or is it a place leading to a passage? What is the bloom? The growth of a flower or a view of light? The lilacs blooming... are they representative of death or of life? Or of growth? Or of time passing... lilacs last. The beauty of music is the power to suggest things that even words might not convey. Therefore, take your own meaning from this piece, literally or emotionally or metaphorically... let it be your own dooryard.

40|$|Treading damage by {{cattle in}} wet winters is an {{important}} limitation for all-grass wintering systems in New Zealand. This study evaluated the impact of cattle treading in winter on pasture plants in both hill country and flat dairy pasture over three trials. On hill country pasture, one severe treading treatment in winter resulted in losses in herbage accumulation rate of 9 kg (or 25 %) DM ha- 1 day- 1 on tracks and 6 kg (or 26 %) DM ha- 1 day- 1 on slopes compared to relatively untrodden treatments over a 9 month (Aug 98 to April 99) period. In repeatedly trodden treatments at heavy stocking rates, the loss in herbage accumulation rate averaged 19 kg (or 54 %) DM ha- 1 day- 1 in tracks but found no loss on slopes compared to lightly grazed treatments over the same period. Treading seriously reduced pasture cover and changed species that contributed cover. In flat dairy pastures, the loss of herbage accumulation rate was 29 kg (or 36 %) DM ha- 1 day- 1 in highly damaged areas, and 5 kg (or 7 %) DM ha- 1 day- 1 in low- to medium-damaged areas compared to untrodden areas during the 7 weeks regrowth after treading. This loss in herbage accumulation rate was associated with an initial 66 % reduction in grass tiller density in high-damaged <b>areas.</b> <b>Treading</b> also reduced leaf area index. Post-treading pasture cover was only 43 % in high-damaged areas compared to 80 % in untrodden areas. Compared to other grass species, perennial ryegrass was least affected by treading. Losses in herbage mass and tiller density {{as a result of}} treading recovered, or tended to recover, {{by the end of the}} 7 -week regrowth period. In a second experiment on dairy pasture, treading in winter, again, greatly reduced residual herbage mass and tiller population density. Losses in both residual herbage mass and tiller density recovered by the end of the 7 -week regrowth period. Differences in pasture height before treading did not effect pasture growth but, relative to the tall canopy height, the short canopy height enhanced tillering of ryegrass during the recovery period. The effect of treading on the weight of ryegrass tillers was small. An important aspect of treading was its role in increasing tiller appearance rate of ryegrass and encouraging faster growth of these newly developed tillers. Ryegrass-dominant pastures recovering from treading damage are reliant on the emergence and growth of new tillers...|$|R
40|$|The {{frictional}} forces developed between the tire and wet pavement {{have a great}} effect on the safety of vehicles. This paper exposes {{the results of a}} study, which aims at modeling the hydroplaning phenomenon taking into account the load transfer between the rear and the front wheels, the water depth on the road, the skid resistance before total hydroplaning. A part of this work was funded by the PREDIT 3 (IRCAD project). In a first step, a comparison of the main existing tire/road contact models was realized. This work aimed at evaluating the models regarding the hypothesis made (parameters needed, physical properties taken into account or not). This bibliographical study concluded {{on the fact that the}} speed of the vehicle, the tires' characteristics (pressure, contact <b>area,</b> <b>tread</b> depth) the load, the water depth, the road profile and macrotexture were the most important parameters that should be included in a global hydroplaning model. Among these parameters, the water depth seems to be the most difficult to evaluate considering the fact that it deeply depends on the pavement irregularities (roughness and texture), the road geometry and the weather (rainfall intensity). That's why the French Regional Laboratory of Road and Bridges of Lyon proposes in a second step a model, which calculates the water depth by taking into account the geometry and the macrotexture of the road. A device called VANI measures the longitudinal slope, the transversal slope, the radius of curvature and the macrotexture of the road each meter. Thus, a vector is calculated each meter giving the main direction of the water flow. The individual vectors are added in view of determining the line of the water flow all along the road. Thus, it is possible to obtain cartography of the road containing the main water flow lines, the tops and the bottoms where the water is accumulating. The lengths of these lines are then used for the calculus of the water depth depending on the rainfall intensity and the road macrotexture. An experimental validation is realized by using a captor measuring the real water depth on the road. In a third step, this initial water depth is used in a bicycle model, which describes the longitudinal dynamics phenomenon. The load transfer between the front and the rear axles is calculated in straight line taken into account the skid resistance of the road (Longitudinal friction coefficient) and the driver behavior (acceleration, braking). Moreover, the water depth behind the rear tire is calculated by considering the water displacement generated by the front tires. The, the increase of the water thickness just behind the tire due to the flow in the tire tread and the pavement macrotexture is modeled with Navier stokes equations. Finally, this model provides a hydroplaning speed depending both on the infrastructure characteristic (geometry, skid resistance) and the vehicle characteristics (tire, pressure, load), which is used for warning the drivers...|$|R

Tekerlek profili tasarımında dikkat edilmesi gereken ana husus konfor-güvenlik ilişkisinin doğru bir şekilde kurulmasıdır. Bu tez kapsamında raylı taşıt dinamiğinde önemli bir etkiye sahip olan tekerlek-ray teması üzerinde durulmuştur. Öncelikle Simpack yazılımında bir tramvay aracına ait 52 serbestlik dereceli dinamik model oluşturulmuştur. Daha sonra üç farklı tekerlek profili (TTP 1, TTP 2 ve TTP 3) modele eklenerek performansları incelenmiş ve karşılaştırılmıştır. Yapılan kararlılık, konfor ve kurp analizleri sonucunda TTP 2 ve TTP 3 profilleri konfor, yanal kararlılık açısından daha iyi sonuçlar verdiği gözlemlenmiştir. Kurp analizinde ise her üç profilinde güvenlik sınırlarını aşmamakla birlikte TTP 1 profilinin deray oranı daha düşük çıkmıştır. Yapılan bu tez ile modellenen tramvay aracının dinamik sürüş performansı bakımından en uygun tekerlek profili belirlenmiştir. Önerilen tekerlek profili ile konfor iyileştirilirken güvenlik standartlar tarafından belirlenen sınırlar içerisinde tutulmuştur. Metro and trams {{are one of}} {{the most}} cost {{effective}} vehicles in urban transportation. This is due to the low energy loss of metal on metal contact between wheels and rail. The advantageous characteristics in passenger carrying capacity and punctual operation make them more preferable than other urban transportation vehicles. They also offer a secure and comfortable trip for passengers. Metro and trams differ from other railway vehicles in operating conditions. Some main differences are the distance between stations, passenger capacity, braking and acceleration. Especially tram vehicles’ design inputs vary considerably since they are operated within the motorway traffic and with respect to city’s weather condition and geological specification. The selection of railway wheel and rail profiles is a challenge that has faced engineers since the dawn of the railway age. This thesis is mainly focused on rail-wheel profile contact which has a very important effect on railway vehicle dynamics. Metro and light rail vehicle wheel profiles are determined with respect to the predefined standards. However in tramways, it is determined by the operator considering the parameters such as line characteristics and operating speeds. Increasing axle loads, the presence of tight curves and light vehicles causes more complexitty for wheel/rail interface. These differing requirements are all oriented toward same targets; increased durability and comfort, reduction of maintenance costs, and increased safety. First of all, the dynamic model is created in Simpack software. The dynamic behaviour of a railway vehicle can be analysed using three types of analysis: • linear analysis, for the evaluation of the vehicle model eigenvalues; • stability analysis, used for the evaluation of the critical speed of the vehicle; • dynamic analysis, to simulate the actual behaviour of the railway system in operating conditions. The complete vehicle–track system can be split up into three subsystems: vehicle, wheel–rail contact, and track. The first step in every vehicle computer simulation is to set up a mechanical model appropriate to fulfil the desired simulation task. The multibody system (MBS) approach is a powerful and widely used method for this procedure, especially if the vehicle’s running behaviour is to be analyzed. The typical model of a railway vehicle is composed of the three sub-assemblies: the car body, the front bogie, trailer bogie and the rear bogie. Each bogie consists of the bogie frame, bolster, and two wheelsets. In this research, the car body and bogie frames, as well as the wheelsets are treated as rigid bodies and are defined by their mass–inetria characteristics (mass, moments of inertia, and the position of the centre of gravity), and by the relative position of the bogies with respect to the car body itself. Each rigid body has six degrees of freedom; three translations and three rotations. All bodies are connected by linear and non-linear springs and dampers, representing the primary and secondary suspensions. Primary and secondary suspensions are often used to support the carbody components and to provide vibration isolation. The primary suspension is connected between the wheelset and the side frame, while the secondary suspension is connected between the bolster and the side frame. The primary and secondary suspensions consist of spring, damper, bump stop and trailer arm. Difference between contact areas is presented by creating contact models for these three wheel profiles. Mode frequencies and dampings are investigated by applying the modal analysis to investigate the stability of the system. Resonance characteristics of components such as carbody, bogie and bolster are observed with the aid of their mode shapes. Stability of the system indicated by investigating the damping values and root-loci figures for a speed range of 0 - 70 km/h. On the other hand, after the analysis of the most critical curve area under operating conditions, equivalent conicity did not exceed the limits. Lateral irregularity is applied to the straight track to see the lateral movement of the carbody during maximum velocity of 70 km/h. Lateral movement of the carbody is absorbed in time after the analysis and stability of the vehicle is proved for these conditions. Superiority of the TTP 2 and TTP 3 wheel profiles is shown by the lateral stability analysis results. Comfort index from EN 12299 standard is compared between three wheel profiles by using a track irregularity which is defined in ORE B 176 and also superiority of the TTP 2 and TTP 3 is investigated with respect to comfort for passengers. L/V ratio, creepages, creep forces and lateral forces are compared for each wheel profile by curve analysis for the most critical curve in the line. As a result, altough none of the wheel profiles exceed the safety limit, TTP 1 profile yields much safer results. On the other hand, TTP 2 and TTP 3 generates lower lateral forces during the curve than TTP 1 profile. Therefore, TTP 2 and TTP 3 profiles have superior characteristcs for maintenance costs and irregularites on wheel and rail profile. To sum up, TTP 1 profile is safer for curve analysis and TTP 2 and TTP 3 profiles have superior lateral stability and comfort characteristics and less lateral forces generated acting on the rail. Basic principle for wheel profile design process is building the relation between comfort and safety in a proper way. Comfort should be improved while safety limits should not be exceeded for designed wheel profile. With respect to these informations, optimization can be done on the wheel <b>tread</b> and flange <b>area</b> to get better results for safety and comfort. Additionally, profiles can be compared for wear conditions. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
