5|$|After the {{processed}} antigen (peptide) is complexed to the MHC molecule, {{they both}} migrate together {{to the cell}} membrane, where they are exhibited (elaborated) as a complex that can be recognized by the CD 4+ (T helper cell)– a type of white blood cell. This is known as antigen presentation. However, the epitopes (conformational epitopes) that are recognized by the B cell prior to their digestion may not be <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> presented to the T helper cell. Additionally, a B cell may present different peptides complexed to different MHC-II molecules.|$|E
5|$|Arsenic and {{antimony}} are not semiconductors {{in their}} standard states. Both form type III-V semiconductors (such as GaAs, AlSb or GaInAsSb) {{in which the}} average number of valence electrons per atom is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of Group 14 elements. These compounds are preferred for some special applications. Antimony nanocrystals may enable lithium-ion batteries to be replaced by more powerful sodium ion batteries.|$|E
5|$|Before the Baroque era, {{keyboard}} music generally was {{not written}} for one instrument or another, but rather was written {{to be played}} on any keyboard instrument. For this reason, much of the organ's repertoire through the Renaissance period is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of the harpsichord. Pre-Renaissance keyboard music is found in compiled manuscripts that may include compositions {{from a variety of}} regions. The oldest of these sources is the Robertsbridge Codex, dating from about 1360. The Buxheimer Orgelbuch, which dates from about 1470 and was compiled in Germany, includes intabulations of vocal music by the English composer John Dunstaple. The earliest Italian organ music is found in the Faenza Codex, dating from 1420.|$|E

5|$|Cerium has a {{variable}} electronic structure. The {{energy of the}} 4f electron is nearly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of the outer 5d and 6s electrons that are delocalized in the metallic state, and {{only a small amount}} of energy is required to change the relative occupancy of these electronic levels. This gives rise to dual valence states. For example, a volume change of about 10% occurs when cerium is subjected to high pressures or low temperatures. It appears that the valence changes from about 3 to 4 when it is cooled or compressed.|$|E
5|$|Cubic {{boron nitride}} has a crystal {{structure}} analogous {{to that of}} diamond. Consistent with diamond being less stable than graphite, the cubic form is less stable than the hexagonal form, but the conversion rate {{between the two is}} negligible at room temperature, as it is for diamond. The cubic form has the sphalerite crystal structure, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of diamond, and is also called β-BN or c-BN.|$|E
5|$|Debs appealed his {{conviction}} to the Supreme Court. In its ruling on Debs v. United States, the court examined several statements Debs had made regarding World War I and socialism. While Debs had carefully worded his speeches {{in an attempt}} to comply with the Espionage Act, the Court found he had the intention and effect of obstructing the draft and military recruitment. Among other things, the Court cited Debs' praise for those imprisoned for obstructing the draft. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr. stated in his opinion that little attention was needed since Debs' case was essentially <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of Schenck v. United States, in which the Court had upheld a similar conviction.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the harsh}} {{conditions}} on the surface, the atmospheric pressure and temperature at about 50km to 65km above {{the surface of the}} planet is nearly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of the Earth, making its upper atmosphere the most Earth-like area in the Solar System, even more so than the surface of Mars. Due to the similarity in pressure and temperature and the fact that breathable air (21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen) is a lifting gas on Venus {{in the same way that}} helium is a lifting gas on Earth, the upper atmosphere has been proposed as a location for both exploration and colonization.|$|E
5|$|Einsteinium is a synthetic, silvery-white, {{radioactive}} metal. In {{the periodic}} table, {{it is located}} {{to the right of}} the actinide californium, to the left of the actinide fermium and below the lanthanide holmium with which it shares many similarities in physical and chemical properties. Its density of 8.84 g/cm3 is lower than that of californium (15.1 g/cm3) and is nearly <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of holmium (8.79 g/cm3), despite atomic einsteinium being much heavier than holmium. The melting point of einsteinium (860°C) is also relatively low – below californium (900°C), fermium (1527°C) and holmium (1461°C). Einsteinium is a soft metal, with the bulk modulus of only 15 GPa, which value is one of the lowest among non-alkali metals.|$|E
5|$|Fish are cold-blooded, and {{in general}} their body {{temperature}} is <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of their surroundings. They gain and lose heat through their skin and during respiration {{and are able to}} regulate their circulation in response to changes in water temperature by increasing or reducing the blood flow to the gills. Metabolic heat generated in the muscles or gut is quickly dissipated through the gills, with blood being diverted away from the gills during exposure to cold. Because of their relative inability to control their blood temperature, most teleosts can only survive in a small range of water temperatures.|$|E

5|$|In 2013, the American Psychiatric Association {{released}} the fifth {{edition of the}} DSM (DSM-5). To be diagnosed with schizophrenia, two diagnostic criteria have to be met {{over much of the}} time of a period of at least one month, with a significant impact on social or occupational functioning for at least six months. The person had to be suffering from delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. A second symptom could be negative symptoms, or severely disorganized or catatonic behaviour. The definition of schizophrenia remained essentially <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> specified by the 2000 version of DSM (DSM-IV-TR), but DSM-5 makes a number of changes.|$|E
5|$|In some units the {{alternator}} {{is essentially}} <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> used in portable generating sets used to supply mains power, modified {{to produce a}} higher current at a lower voltage but still at the 50 or 60Hz grid frequency. In higher-quality units an alternator with more poles is used and supplies current at a higher frequency, such as 400Hz. The smaller amount of time the high-frequency waveform spends near zero makes {{it much easier to}} strike and maintain a stable arc than with the cheaper grid-frequency sets or grid-frequency mains-powered units.|$|E
5|$|Nihonium is {{expected}} to be much denser than thallium, having a predicted density of about 16 to 18g/cm3, due to the relativistic stabilization and contraction of its 7s and 7p1/2 orbitals. This is because calculations estimate it to have an atomic radius of about 170pm, <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of thallium, even though periodic trends would predict it to have an atomic radius larger than that of thallium due to it being one period further down in the periodic table. The melting and boiling points of nihonium are not definitely known, but have been calculated to be 430°C and 1100°C respectively, exceeding the values for gallium, indium, and thallium, following periodic trends.|$|E

5|$|The 1984 Winter Olympics – officially {{known by}} the International Olympic Committee as the XIV Olympic Winter Games – were a winter multi-sport event held between 8 and 19 February 1984 in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia (currently Bosnia and Herzegovina).

The official program was <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>as</b> <b>that</b> of the 1980 Winter Olympics, {{with the addition of}} a 20-kilometer event in women's cross-country skiing.

5|$|The 5th Massachusetts was {{activated}} for a {{third time}} in response to this call. Men began to be mustered in on July 16, 1864 at Camp Meigs just outside Boston. Colonel George H.

Recruitment was rushed, new enlistments were given only most minimal training, and the regiment departed Boston on July 28, 1864 for Baltimore.|$|E
5|$|The German graves {{were grouped}} {{according}} to military unit.

The German headstones were carved from locally quarried stone, principally bluestone and Belgian Petit Granit. German officers were offered larger headstones to illustrate their higher military rank. The cemetery contains a number of German regimental memorials within the cemetery which were paid and provided by the city or town where the regiment was based.|$|E
