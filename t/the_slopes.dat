The ultimate load of <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> decreased significantly with the increasing gradient of <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> or <b>the</b> decreasing nail length. <b>The</b> <b>slope</b> exhibited significant progressive failure that was captured by a displacement-based analysis.

To overcome this problem, analysis of slope failure must be carried out to determine <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> stability.

From the results, the FOS of <b>the</b> <b>slope</b> before <b>the</b> failure by using Morgenstern-Price Method is 1. 710 which can be considered as stable due to the FOS value is more than 1.
