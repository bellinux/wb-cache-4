5|$|Christopher Huynh of Game Music Online {{generally}} {{praised the}} soundtrack's quality, but felt <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> little variety. RPGFans Patrick Gann was generally positive, {{although he had}} little commentary on individual tracks, and recommended the album to people who had enjoyed the soundtrack of Nier. The album reached #18 in the Oricon charts and remained in the charts for four weeks.|$|E
5|$|In 1596, Johannes Kepler {{predicted}} “Between Mars and Jupiter, I place a planet” in his Mysterium Cosmographicum. While analyzing Tycho Brahe's data, Kepler {{thought that}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> large {{a gap between}} the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|At {{the battle}} itself, Johnson's forces {{were the first}} to attack. One {{battalion}} of five hundred men, under Johnson's elder brother, James Johnson, engaged the British force of eight hundred regulars; simultaneously, Richard Johnson, with the other, now somewhat smaller battalion, attacked the fifteen hundred Indians led by Tecumseh. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> much tree cover for the British volleys to be effective against James Johnson; three quarters of the regulars were killed or captured.|$|E

5|$|My Texas {{distributor}} {{arrived in}} the city where I was filming and asked me how it was going. I told him that I thought that it was good but that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> much violence and passion, and he answered, “Roger, I’ve been in this business for forty years, and you’ve been in it for just two. Let me tell you that no one has ever made a film with too much passion and violence.” So I pressed on. Everyone was dying. At {{the end of the film}} half of the city was dead.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Ernest Thompson {{exercised}} an option of his lease allowing him to buy Craigiehall from Lord Rosebery. However, the army had still not moved out, and in 1948 offered to purchase the property from Thompson, finally completing the sale in 1951. Through the early 1950s the Army made alterations to Craigiehall. The original roof was replaced in 1953 due to woodworm, and extra rooms added in the attic. This resulted {{in the loss of}} Bruce's chimneys, and Burn's dining room pediment. Internally the house was redecorated, it being considered that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> little of the original scheme remaining to allow restoration. Another extension was added, this time to the north-west, to house the staff of the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC) in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Before {{releasing}} the film, Madonna invited {{a group of}} friends and co-workers to watch a rough three-hour cut of the film at a local theater in Notting Hill, and noted their feedback. General consensus was that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> much of Kabbalah in the film, hence she decided to prune those segments considerably. The documentary premiered on MTV in the United States, on October 21, 2005, at 10:00 PM. She also showed it to the film students at New York's Hunter College and appeared for a Q session. This promotion was a part of mtvU's Stand In series, in which celebrities filled in for college professors.|$|E

5|$|Legal & General {{worked with}} the local {{community}} to secure support for the project, establishing the St Giles Renaissance Forum in 2002 as {{a focal point for}} local residents, community groups and stakeholders to collaborate on plans to regenerate St Giles. Plans for the development were unveiled in February 2004 and in January 2005 Legal & General made a planning application to begin construction. The scheme was opposed by a number of local residents' groups which complained that it would constitute an overdevelopment of the site, would put too much strain on local transport and that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> little residential accommodation on the site.|$|E
5|$|Marseillois {{was ordered}} on 16 January 1762, {{to be built}} in Toulon on a design by the {{engineer}} Coulomb, and named the same day by Louis XV, following the request of her patrons. The chamber of commerce of Marseille further requested that the ship be built in Marseille, but Coulomb determined that the harbour <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> shallow for the launch of a 74-gun ship, and the order for Marseillois was eventually confirmed at Toulon. There, lack of timber in the shipyards, that were already busy building Languedoc, Zélé and Bourgogne, delayed the construction of Marseillois until 1764. Her building was directed by the engineer Chapelle.|$|E
5|$|The Army's {{training}} program attracted criticism, {{both at the}} time and subsequently. In 1937, Brigadier General George C. Marshall felt that in merging instruction on command and staff duties, the Command and General Staff School had neglected the former in favor of the latter, with officers being prepared for staff duties in peacetime rather than the chaos of command in wartime. Brigadier General Lesley J. McNair conducted a survey of graduates in 1939 that found that most felt that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> much emphasis on obsolete skills like equitation. For this reason, the staff rides were disliked. While most considered the map exercises the most valuable part of the curriculum, some noted that students spent time discovering for themselves things that they could have been told.|$|E

[...] Inslee cited the high cost of pursuing the death penalty, the randomness with which it was sought, and a lack of evidence that it is a deterrent.|$|R
5|$|By 01:00, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> {{much water}} in the hull for the pumps to handle. Water began to enter the forward {{generator}} compartments, which forced the crew to work by candlelight. Lützow was so low in the water by 01:30 that water began to flood the forward boiler room. By that point, {{almost all of the}} compartments in the forward part of the ship, up to the conning tower and below the main armored deck, were thoroughly flooded. Water had also entered the ship through shell holes in the forecastle above the armored deck; the majority of the upper portion of the ship forward of the forward-most barbette was flooded as well. The battlecruiser's crew attempted to patch the shell holes three times, but as the flooding worsened and the draft increased, water increasingly washed over the deck and inhibited progress on the repair work. The crew attempted to reverse direction and steam backwards, but this had to be abandoned when the bow became so submerged that the propellers were pulled partially out of the water; forward draft had increased to over 17meters.|$|E

25|$|Because the X-15 {{also had}} to be {{controlled}} {{in an environment where}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> little air for aerodynamic flight control surfaces, it had a reaction control system (RCS) that used rocket thrusters.

25|$|In the 1890s the Americanism {{controversy}} roiled senior officials.

25|$|The Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Mitsubishi Zero had {{the exact}} {{opposite}} problem in which the controls became ineffective. At higher speeds, the pilot simply couldn't move the controls because <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>too</b> much airflow over the control surfaces. The planes would become difficult to maneuver, and at high enough speeds aircraft without this problem could out-turn them.|$|E
