Some notable results included the China Star, but domestic Chinese companies lacked the technology and expertise of foreign companies, and the research process consumed {{a large amount of}} time. People's Republic of China Ministry of Railways spokesman Zhang Shuguang stated that due to historical reasons, China's overall railway technology and equipment {{is similar to that of}} developed countries' rail systems in the 1970s; high-speed rolling stock development is still in its infancy stage. If using only their own resources and expertise, the country might need a decade or longer to catch up with developed nations. In 2004, the Chinese State Council and the Ministry of Railways defined a modern railway technology and equipment policy as [...] "{{the introduction}} of advanced technology, the joint design and production, to build China brand".

The home computers of the early 1980s could not multitask. Even if they could, memory capacities were too small to hold entire databases or financial records, floppy disk-based storage was inadequate in both capacity and speed for multimedia work, and the graphics of the systems could only display blocky, unrealistic images and blurry, jagged text. Before long, a backlash set in—computer users were [...] "geeks", [...] "nerds" [...] or worse, [...] "hackers". The North American video game crash of 1983 soured many on home computer technology. The computers that were purchased for use in the family room were either forgotten in closets or relegated to basements and children's bedrooms to be used exclusively for games and the occasional book report.

50|$|In a study {{completed}} by Anna Dornhaus, Jo-Anne Holley, and Nigel R. Franks, the communal responsibilities within the colonies of Temnothorax were observed {{to determine if}} the size of a colony influences the division of labor among workers. By studying 11 colonies of both large and small population sizes (a small colony to consist of 200 to 400 individuals and a large colony to consist of 500 to 700 individuals) with approximately less than 1100 individually marked worker ants the researchers were able to determine how tasks were divided and the proportion of how many workers were active or inactive in the completion of tasks. The researchers charted seven different <b>task</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> be done during the emigration process from an old nest to a new one: scouting, brood transport, adult transport, collection of food which was separated into two tasks for collecting dead flies (Drosophila) and collecting honey solution, collection of sand materials for wall building, and the actual task of wall building. It was observed that between the sizes of the large and small colonies the ratio of active and non-active works was consistent, with the larger colonies having a slightly higher ratio of active workers but not enough to be statistically significant. It was also observed that among active and inactive workers it was consistent that usually less than 25% and never more than 50% of the workers were active. This could be that the non-active workers were completing tasks that were not being observed. Specialization of tasks was also not determined by colony size. However of the active workers it was shown that there was a disproportion of the rate at which active workers complete tasks with typically a few individuals doing more of the work than the other active workers. These ratios were also consistent in times when either a high or low phase of activity was required to complete emigration to the new nest.|$|E

40|$|An {{important}} <b>task</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> build a scalable, fault-tolerant {{quantum computer}} is to efficiently represent an arbitrary single-qubit rotation by fault-tolerant quantum operations. Traditionally, the method for decomposing a single-qubit unitary into a discrete set of gates is Solovay-Kitaev decomposition, which in practice produces {{a sequence of}} depth O(^c(1 /ϵ)), where c 3. 97 is the state-of-the-art. The proven lower bound is c= 1, however an efficient algorithm that saturates this bound is unknown. In this paper, we present an alternative to Solovay-Kitaev decomposition employing state distillation techniques which reduces c to between 1. 12 and 2. 27, depending on the setting. For a given single-qubit rotation, our protocol significantly lowers {{the length of the}} approximating sequence and the number of required resource states (ancillary qubits). In addition, our protocol is robust to noise in the resource states. Comment: 10 pages, 18 figures, 5 table...|$|E

40|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} problem in machine learning is the preliminary biasing of a learner's hypothesis space {{so that it is}} small enough to ensure good generalisation from reasonable training sets, yet large enough that it contains a good solution to the problem being learnt. In this paper a mechanism for automatically learning or biasing the learner's hypothesis space is introduced. It works by first learning an appropriate internal representation for a learning environment and then using that representation to bias the learner's hypothesis space for the learning of future tasks drawn from the same environment. An internal representation must be learnt by sampling from many similar tasks, not just a single task as occurs in ordinary machine learning. It is proved that the number of examples m per <b>task</b> <b>required</b> <b>to</b> ensure good generalisation from a representation learner obeys m = O(a+b=n) where n is the number of tasks being learnt and a and b are constants.

Furthermore, a robust approach that models the shift of the controlled parameter mean as a random variable is taken into account. The numerical analysis allows the most influencing environmental process factors to be captured and commented upon. The obtained results show that a few process operating parameters drive the choice of performing a robust optimization and the selection of the optimal SPC adaptive procedure. statistical process control, control chart, economic design, robust optimization, labour resource,...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{review the}} {{compiled}} {{measurements of the}} imaginary part of the dynamical magnetic susceptibility χ 00 (ω, T), static susceptibility χ(T), electrical resistivity ρ(T) and specific heat C(T) in the uranium intermetallics UCu 5 −xPdx (x D 1, 1. 5). We assess the temperature- and energy-dependences predicted by single-ion and disorder-dominated models and compare these results to experiments. For temperatures T and excitation energies ω in the range 12 K < ω, T < 150 K, our analysis suggests that the dynamics of isolated uranium ions {{are responsible for the}} observed temperature and frequency scaling, although inter-ion interactions may become important at lower temperatures and frequencies. Fermi liquid theory has long been the paradigm for our phenomenological understanding of interacting metals, linking temperature- and energy-dependence of experimental quantities to the intrinsic energy scale of the electronic excitations. However, the discovery of qualitatively different ‘non-Fermi liquid ’ behaviour {{in a number of different}} classes of non-ordering metals suggests that the scaling properties of electronic excitations are more varied than originally thought.
