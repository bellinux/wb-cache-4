40|$|A goal of Cassini's {{extended}} {{mission has}} been to examine the seasonal variations of Saturn's magnetosphere, moons, and rings. Recently we showed that the magnetospheric plasma between <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>rings</b> and Enceladus exhibited a time dependence that we attributed to a seasonally variable source of oxygen from <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>rings</b> (Elrod et al., 2012). Such a temporal variation was subsequently seen in the energetic ion composition (Christon et al., 2013). Here we include the most recent measurements by the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) in our analysis (Elrod et al., 2012) and modeling (Tseng et al., 2013 a) of the temporal and radial dependence of the thermal plasma in the region between <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>rings</b> and <b>the</b> orbit of Enceladus. Data taken in 2012, well past equinox for which the northern side of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>rings</b> were illuminated, appear consistent with a seasonal variation. Although the thermal plasma in this region comes from two sources, <b>the</b> extended <b>ring</b> atmosphere and <b>the</b> Enceladus torus that have very different radial and temporal trends, the heavy ion density is found to exhibit a steep radial dependence that is similar for all years examined. Using our chemical model, we show that this dependence requires a radial dependence for Enceladus torus than differs from recent models or, more likely, enhanced heavy ion quenching with decreasing distance {{from the edge of}} <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>rings.</b> We examine <b>the</b> possible physical processes and suggest that the precipitation of the inward diffusing high energy background radiation onto the edge of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>rings</b> could play an important role...|$|R

5|$|The dust is {{constantly}} being removed from <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>ring</b> {{by a combination}} of Poynting–Robertson drag and electromagnetic forces from the Jovian magnetosphere. Volatile materials, for example ices, evaporate quickly. The lifetime of dust particles in <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> is from 100 to 1000years, so the dust must be continuously replenished in the collisions between large bodies with sizes from 1cm to 0.5km and between the same large bodies and high velocity particles coming from outside the Jovian system. This parent body population is confined to the narrow—about 1000km—and bright outer part of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>ring,</b> and includes Metis and Adrastea. The largest parent bodies must be less than 0.5km in size. The upper limit on their size was obtained by New Horizons spacecraft. The previous upper limit, obtained from HST and Cassini observations, was near 4km. The dust produced in collisions retains approximately the same orbital elements as the parent bodies and slowly spirals in the direction of Jupiter forming the faint (in back-scattered light) innermost part of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>ring</b> and halo <b>ring.</b> <b>The</b> age of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>ring</b> is currently unknown, but it may be the last remnant of a past population of small bodies near Jupiter.|$|R
500|$|The optical {{properties}} of <b>the</b> halo <b>ring</b> {{can be explained}} by the hypothesis that it comprises only dust with particle sizes less than 15μm. Parts of the halo located far from <b>the</b> <b>ring</b> plane may consist of submicrometre dust. This dusty composition explains the much stronger forward-scattering, bluer colors and lack of visible structure in the halo. The dust probably originates in <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>ring,</b> a claim supported by the fact that the halo’s optical depth [...] is comparable with that of the dust in <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>ring.</b> <b>The</b> large thickness of the halo can be attributed to the excitation of orbital inclinations and eccentricities of dust particles by the electromagnetic forces in the Jovian magnetosphere. The outer boundary of <b>the</b> halo <b>ring</b> coincides with location of a strong 3:2 Lorentz resonance. As Poynting–Robertson drag causes particles to slowly drift towards Jupiter, their orbital inclinations are excited while passing through it. The bloom of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>ring</b> may be a beginning of the halo. <b>The</b> halo <b>ring’s</b> inner boundary is not far from the strongest 2:1 Lorentz resonance. In this resonance the excitation is probably very significant, forcing particles to plunge into the Jovian atmosphere thus defining a sharp inner boundary. Being derived from <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>ring,</b> <b>the</b> halo has the same age.|$|R

This model reproduces the asymmetry in brightness between {{the east and}} west ansae of <b>the</b> <b>rings</b> of Saturn that was observed by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) within a few hours after the Earth ring-plane crossing (RPX) of 10 August 1995. The model shows that during this observation <b>the</b> inclined F <b>ring</b> unevenly blocked <b>the</b> east and west ansae of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>rings.</b> <b>The</b> brightness asymmetry produced by the model is highly sensitive to the vertical thickness and radial optical depth of <b>the</b> F <b>ring.</b> <b>The</b> F <b>ring</b> model that best matches the observations has a vertical full width at half maximum of 13 +/- 7 km and an equivalent depth of 10 +/- 4 km.
