40|$|This {{research}} {{is focused on}} developing a control scheme for regulating the pressure in the brake chamber of an air brake system found in most commercial vehicles like trucks, tractor-trailers and buses. Such a control scheme {{can be used for}} providing the ground work for future systems such as forward collision avoidance systems, advanced anti-lock brake systems and differential braking systems. The development of this controller involves two tasks. The first task was the development of a control scheme for achieving the desired pressure in the brake chamber. This scheme was based on a mathematical model of the <b>treadle</b> <b>valve</b> of the air brake system. The second task was the implementation of this control scheme on the experimental facility that was set up at Texas A&M University. The results indicate successful control of a desired brake chamber pressure for a demonstrated range of controller gains...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the development of a model-based diagnostic system for air brake systems that are widely used in commercial vehicles, such as trucks, tractor-trailers, buses, etc. The performance of these brake systems is sensitive to maintenance and hence they require frequent inspections. Current inspection techniques require an inspector to go underneath a vehicle to check the brake system for possible faults, such as leaks, worn brake pads, out-of-adjustment of push rods, etc. Such inspections are time consuming, labor intensive and difficult to perform on vehicles with a low ground clearance. In this context, the development of an onboard/ handheld diagnostic tool for air brakes would be of significant value. Such a tool would automate the brake inspection process, thereby reducing the inspection time and improving the safety of operation of commercial vehicles. In this dissertation, diagnostic schemes are developed to automatically detect two important and prevalent faults that can occur in air brake systems ?????? leaks and out-of-adjustment of push rods. These diagnostic schemes are developed based on a nonlinear model for the pneumatic subsystem of the air brake system that correlates the pressure transients in the brake chamber with the supply pressure to the <b>treadle</b> <b>valve</b> and the displacement of the <b>treadle</b> <b>valve</b> plunger. These diagnostic schemes have been corroborated with data obtained from the experimental facility at Texas A&M University and the results are presented. The response of the pneumatic subsystem of the air brake system is such that it can be classified as what is known as a ??????Sequential Hybrid System??????. In this dissertation, the term ??????hybrid systems?????? is used to denote those systems whose mathematical representation involves a finite set of governing ordinary differential equations corresponding to a finite set of modes of operation. The problem of estimating the push rod stroke is posed as a parameter estimation problem and a transition detection problem involving the hybrid model of the pneumatic subsystem of the air brake system. Also, parameter estimation schemes for a class of sequential hybrid systems are developed. The efficacy of these schemes is illustrated with some examples...|$|E
40|$|Statistics {{indicate}} that defects in brake system {{contribute significantly to}} fatal crashes involving commercial vehicles. Hence {{there is a need}} for developing preventive and active safety measures for assessing the performance of an air brake system in trucks. Existing techniques for assessing the performance of brakes are infrastructure intensive, time and labor intensive. The premise of this thesis is that model-based diagnostic techniques can be employed to overcome these limitations of existing tech- niques. The design of a model-based diagnostic system requires the development and experimental corroboration of a mathematical model of the evolution of pressure in each brake chamber of a truck in response to the application of brake pedal input by the driver, when there are no faults or defects in the brake system. This thesis is aimed at modeling and experimentally corroborating a subsystem of an air brake system, namely the pneumatic relay valve. The pneumatic relay valve takes a input signal from the primary delivery of a <b>treadle</b> <b>valve</b> and meters air from a storage reservoir to Type 30 rear brake chambers. A description of the development of the model, the experimental setup and corroborating experimental results are provided...|$|E
5000|$|Acquisitions continued. In January 1963, Midland-Ross {{acquired}} the J. Leukart Machine Company of Columbus, Ohio, manufacturer of precision machining equipment. In April, it {{acquired the}} Steel City Electric Co. of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, {{a manufacturer of}} electrical cables, junction boxes, and other industrial electrical equipment. That same year, it changed the name of its Midland Brake division to Power Controls. The company had significantly diversified its product line, and now primarily manufactured air and vacuum brake systems, air compressors, brake <b>valves,</b> <b>treadles,</b> and slack adjustors. By 1965, Midland-Ross' sales had risen to a record $210 million ($ in [...] dollars). In February of that year, it acquired National Malleable and Steel Castings Co. (a company which made grinding balls, iron and steel castings, and railway equipment) for $30 million ($ in [...] dollars). The purchase included two subsidiaries, Industrial Castings (an iron and steel casting manufacturer) and Capitol Foundry (maker of steel grinding balls for the mining industry).|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} the hysteresis characteristics of a pneumatic braking system for multi-axle heavy vehicles (MHVs). Hysteresis affects emergency braking performance severely. The fact that MHVs have a large size and complex structure leads to more nonlinear coupling property of the pneumatic braking system compared to normal two-axle vehicles. Thus, theoretical analysis and simulation are not enough when studying hysteresis. In this article, the hysteresis of a pneumatic brake system for an eight-axle vehicle in an emergency braking situation is studied based on a novel test bench. A servo drive device is applied to simulate the driver’s braking intensions normally expressed by opening or moving speed of the brake pedal. With a reasonable arrangement of sensors and the NI LabVIEW platform, both the delay time of eight loops and the response time of each subassembly in a single loop are detected in real time. The outcomes of the experiment show that the delay time of each loop gets longer {{with the increase of}} pedal opening, and a quadratic relationship exists between them. Based on this, the pressure transient in the system is fitted to a first-order plus time delay model. Besides, the response time of <b>treadle</b> <b>valve</b> and controlling pipeline accounts for more than 80 % of the loop’s total delay time, indicating that these two subassemblies are the main contributors to the hysteresis effect...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a mathematical model for an air brake system in the presence of leaks. Brake systems in trucks are crucial for ensuring the safety of vehicles and passengers on the roadways. Most trucks in the US are equipped with S-cam drum brake systems and they are sensitive to maintenance. Brake defects such as leaks are a major cause of accidents involving trucks. Leaks in the air brake systems affect braking performance drastically by decreasing the peak braking pressures attained and also increasing the time required to attain the same, thereby resulting in longer stopping distances. Hence {{there is a need for}} detecting leaks in an air brake system. In this thesis, a mathematical model for an air brake system in the presence of leaks is developed with a view towards developing an automatic leak detection system in the near future. The model developed here builds on an earlier research at Texas A&M University in which a "fault free" model of an air brake system is developed, i. e., a mathematical model of an air brake system that predicts how the pressure in the brake chamber evolves as a function of the brake pedal input when there are no leaks in the air brake system. In order to develop a model for an air brake system in the presence of leaks, one must characterize a "leak". A leak may be characterized by the location and its size. Since the pipes are short, the location of the leak does not significantly affect the evolution in the brake pressure as much as its size. For this reason, "effective area" of the leak was chosen as a characteristic of the leak. It was estimated by fitting an empirical relation for leak with leak flow measurement data. The supply pressure and effective area of leak comprised the inputs to the model along with the displacement of the foot pedal (<b>treadle</b> <b>valve</b> plunger). The model was corroborated with the experimental data collected using the setup at Texas A&M University...|$|E
