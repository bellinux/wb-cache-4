The {{effects of}} the welding {{mechanical}} heterogeneity on <b>the</b> damage <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> notched round-bar tensile specimens were investigated numerically using a fully coupled elastic-plastic damage finite element method. Some parameters reflecting the welding mechanical heterogeneity such as strength mismatching, rupture strain and weld metal width were taken into account to study their effects on <b>the</b> damage <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weld metal. The calculation results show that <b>the</b> damage <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weld metal is affected strongly by the welding mechanical heterogeneity. <b>The</b> damage <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weld metal becomes larger with the decrease of both the rupture strain and yielding stress of the base metal.

5|$|Another {{model of}} <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> this genus, also {{proposed}} by Casier in 1960, {{is that the}} direct ancestor of the Carcharocles is the shark Otodus obliquus, which lived from 60 mya to 13 mya during the Paleocene and Miocene epochs. In this model, O. obliquus evolved into O. aksuaticus, which evolved into C. auriculatus, and then into C. angustidens, and then into C. chubutensis, and then finally into C. megalodon. <b>The</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> this lineage {{is characterized by the}} increase of serrations, the widening of the crown, the development of a more triangular shape, and the disappearance of the lateral cusps.

5|$|In 1986, J.Scott Turner and C.Richard Tracy {{proposed}} that <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> a sail in Dimetrodon {{was related to}} <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> warm-bloodedness in mammal ancestors. They thought that the sail of Dimetrodon enabled it to be homeothermic, maintaining a constant, albeit low, body temperature. Mammals are also homeothermic, although they differ from Dimetrodon in being endothermic, controlling their body temperature internally through heightened metabolism. Turner and Tracy noted that early therapsids, a more advanced group of synapsids closely related to mammals, had long limbs which can release heat {{in a manner similar}} to that of the sail of Dimetrodon. The homeothermy that developed in animals like Dimetrodon may have carried over to therapsids through a modification of body shape, which would eventually develop into the warm-bloodedness of mammals.|$|E

5|$|Interactions between organisms {{can produce}} both {{conflict}} and cooperation. When the interaction is between pairs of species, {{such as a}} pathogen and a host, or a predator and its prey, these species can develop matched sets of adaptations. Here, <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> one species causes adaptations in a second species. These changes in the second species then, in turn, cause new adaptations in the first species. This cycle of selection and response is called coevolution. An example is the production of tetrodotoxin in the rough-skinned newt and <b>the</b> <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> tetrodotoxin resistance in its predator, the common garter snake. In this predator-prey pair, an evolutionary arms race has produced high levels of toxin in the newt and correspondingly high levels of toxin resistance in the snake.|$|E

30|$|The delay-Doppler {{effects of}} {{time-varying}} channel are often modeled as taps of a time-varying filter [11, 12]. In {{the case of}} the narrowband channel, one tap is the sum of many paths. Hence, it is acceptable to characterize <b>the</b> time <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual taps using an autocorrelation function (ACF) model which is assumed to be independent across delay. Therefore, in non-WSSUS characterization, <b>the</b> time <b>evolution</b> model <b>of</b> <b>the</b> narrowband channel can be decomposed into <b>the</b> time <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> individual taps. This is not the case for the UWB channel where taps are often composed of few or no paths due to the fine time resolution. The fine time resolution implies narrow delay bins which enable paths to move fast from one tap to another [13]. Hence, <b>the</b> time <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> taps becomes correlated across delays. In this case, the narrowband assumption of modeling the stochastic process of taps independent across delay no longer holds. So, <b>the</b> time <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> UWB channel cannot be decomposed into <b>the</b> time <b>evolution</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> individual taps, but of the individual paths. Therefore, the non-WSSUS characterization of the narrowband channel will differ significantly from that of the wideband channel.|$|R
