5|$|A {{player who}} commits three major {{penalties}} (including fighting) {{during a game}} is automatically ejected, suspended, and fined. A player ejected for three major penalties in a game, or for use of weapons, cannot be replaced for five minutes. In 2003, the ECHL added an ejection, fine, and suspension of an additional game for any player charged as an instigator of a fight during the final five minutes of the third period or any overtime. The NHL and AHL adopted <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>in</b> 2005–06, and the NHL includes a fine against the ejected player's head coach.|$|E
5|$|Allowing the enpassant capture, {{together}} {{with the introduction of}} the two-square first move for pawns, {{was one of the last}} major rule changes in European chess, and occurred between 1200 and 1600. Other relatively recent rule changes were castling, the unlimited range for queens and bishops (Spanish master Ruy López de Segura gives <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>in</b> his 1561 book Libro de la invencion liberal y arte del juego del axedrez) and a change to the rules on pawn promotion. In most places the en passant rule was adopted at the same time as allowing the pawn to move two squares on its first move, but it was not universally accepted until the Italian rules were changed in 1880.|$|E
5|$|It {{was only}} with the {{discovery}} of the first transuranic elements, which from plutonium onward have dominant +3 and +4 oxidation states like the lanthanides, that it was realised that the actinides were indeed filling f-orbitals rather than d-orbitals, with the transition-metal-like chemistry of the early actinides being the exception and not <b>the</b> <b>rule.</b> <b>In</b> 1945, when American physicist Glenn T. Seaborg and his team had discovered the transuranic elements americium and curium, he realised that thorium was the second member of the actinide series and was filling an f-block row, instead of being the heavier congener of hafnium filling a fourth d-block row.|$|E

5|$|The Pandavas {{complete}} 12 {{years of}} forest {{life as a}} part of their 13-year exile stipulation of a rigged dice game they were defeated in by the Kauravas. As per <b>the</b> <b>rule,</b> <b>in</b> the 13th year, Pandavas and their wife Draupadi have to assume different identities and live incognito until the upcoming Vijayadashami. In case their real identity is unveiled, they have to repeat their 12-year exile again. That would give a chance to the Kauravas to prohibit Pandavas from attacking and gaining the reigns of the Kuru Kingdom for a longer period, and possibly forever. Pandavas choose the Matsya Kingdom ruled by Virata, a kind hearted but weak spirited king. They hope to find employment in the king's palace.|$|E
5|$|The {{move was}} seen as an effort by the US {{military}} to prevent an international incident by not acknowledging that US pilots had violated Chinese airspace. Debate remains {{as to whether or not}} these airspace violations were a necessity, as US pilots were able to maintain air superiority despite being outnumbered in the war, and Chinese and Soviet pilots, who could have launched similar strikes on UN ships at sea and on targets in Japan did not do so. Still, many missions into Chinese airspace were authorized during the war. Informally, it was known that US pilots regularly violated <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>in</b> a rush to down MiGs.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>rule</b> <b>in</b> Rylands v. Fletcher {{requires}} {{non-natural use}} of land by the defendant and escape of the thing from his land, which causes damage. But <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>in</b> MC Mehta v. Union of India is not dependent upon any such condition. The necessary requirements for applicability of the new rule of Absolute Liability are that the defendant is engaged in hazardous or inherently dangerous activity and that harm results to anyone on account of an accident {{in the operation of}} such hazardous or inherently dangerous activity.|$|E

25|$|As is <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>in</b> most creoles, the lexicon {{of these}} {{languages}} {{can be traced}} to the parent languages, usually with predominance of Portuguese; while the grammar is mostly original and unique to each creole with little resemblance to the syntax of Portuguese or the substrate language.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>rule</b> <b>in</b> Rylands v.

The new rule makes no distinction between the persons within the premises where the enterprise is operating or and persons outside the premises because escape of the thing causing harm from the premises is not {{a necessary condition for}} the applicability of the rule. Further, <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>in</b> Rylands v. Fletcher, though strict {{in the sense that it}} is not dependent on any negligence on the part of the defendant and in this respect similar to the new rule, is not absolute as it is subject to many exceptions but the new rule in Mehta’s case is not only strict but absolute and is subject to no exception.|$|E

25|$|Interestingly, {{there are}} case reports of rhabdoid carcinomas {{recurring}} after unusually long periods, which is {{unusual for a}} fast-growing, aggressive tumor type.

25|$|A {{subset of}} {{nuisance}} {{is known as}} <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>in</b> Rylands v Fletcher where a dam burst into a coal mine shaft. So a dangerous escape of some hazard, including water, fire, or animals means strict liability in nuisance. This is subject only to a remoteness cap, familiar from negligence when the event is unusual and unpredictable. This was the case where chemicals from a factory seeped through a floor into the water table, contaminating East Anglia's reservoirs.|$|E
25|$|As Gil-Robles noted, {{although}} co-operation {{and good}} relations are still generally <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> <b>in</b> most of regions, tensions do arise, whose origins vary.
