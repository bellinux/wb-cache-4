5|$|An {{authoritative}} {{version of}} Marco Polo's book does not and cannot exist, {{for the early}} manuscripts differ significantly. The published editions of his book either rely on single manuscripts, blend multiple versions together, or add notes to clarify, for example in the English translation by Henry Yule. The 1938 English translation by A.C. Moule and Paul Pelliot {{is based on a}} Latin manuscript found in the library of the Cathedral of Toledo in 1932, and is 50% longer than other versions. Approximately 150 manuscript copies in various languages are known to exist, and before availability of the printing press discrepancies were inevitably introduced during copying and translation. The popular translation published by Penguin Books in 1958 by R.E. Latham works several texts <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> readable whole.|$|E
5|$|Responsibility for the {{expedition}} {{was given to}} Sivert Klevan, an engineer with a good instinct for public relations. The ice was to be procured from the glacier Svartisen, and a glaciologist was brought along to give advice. It {{soon became clear that}} the entire three-ton block could not be brought out in one go. Instead, 200kg blocks were cut out with a chainsaw, carried away on a sled, and flown by helicopter down to the town centre. There they were melted <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> block of ice weighing 3,050kg. The block was placed in a specially constructed iron container, which was insulated with wood and glass wool. The container was placed on top of a truck that would carry {{it all the way to}} the Equator, accompanied by a van carrying equipment and a sedan with a film crew.|$|E
5|$|Yuan Hsieh (d. +1220) was Director-General of {{governmental}} grain stores. In pursuance of his schemes for {{the relief of}} famines he issued orders that each pao (village) should prepare a map which would show the fields and mountains, the rivers and the roads in fullest detail. The maps of all the pao were joined <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> map of the tu (larger district), and these in turn were joined with others to make {{a map of the}} hsiang and the hsien (still larger districts). If there was any trouble about the collection of taxes or the distribution of grain, or if the question of chasing robbers and bandits arose, the provincial officials could readily carry out their duties by the aid of the maps.|$|E

5|$|While maps {{drawn in}} ink on flat silk cloths {{have been found}} in the tomb of the Marquess of Dai (interred in 168 BCE at Mawangdui, Hunan province), the {{earliest}} known paper map found in China, dated 179–41 BCE and located at Fangmatan (near Tianshui, Gansu province), is incidentally the oldest known piece of paper. Yet Chinese hempen paper of the Western Han and early Eastern Han eras was of a coarse quality and used primarily as wrapping paper. The papermaking process was not formally introduced until the Eastern Han court eunuch Cai Lun (50–121 CE) created a process in 105 CE where mulberry tree bark, hemp, old linens, and fish nets were boiled <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> pulp that was pounded, stirred in water, and then dunked with a wooden sieve containing a reed mat that was shaken, dried, and bleached into sheets of paper. The oldest known piece of paper with writing on it comes from the ruins of a Chinese watchtower at Tsakhortei, Alxa League, Inner Mongolia, dated precisely 110 CE when the Han garrison abandoned the area following a nomadic Xiongnu attack. By the 3rd century, paper became one of China's chief writing mediums.|$|E

25|$|Quilting is {{the process}} of sewing two or more layers of fabric <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> thicker padded material, usually to create a quilt or quilted garment. Typically, {{quilting}} is done with three layers: the top fabric or quilt top, batting or insulating material and backing material, but many different styles are adopted.|$|E
25|$|Piecing: Sewing {{small pieces}} of cloth into patterns, called blocks, that are then sewn <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> {{finished}} quilt top. These blocks may be sewn together, edge to edge, or separated by strips of cloth called sashing. Note: Whole cloth quilts typically are not pieced, but are made using {{a single piece of}} cloth for the quilt top.|$|E
25|$|If {{the amino}} group {{is removed from}} an amino acid, it leaves behind a carbon {{skeleton}} called an α-keto acid. Enzymes called transaminases can easily transfer the amino group from one amino acid (making it an α-keto acid) to another α-keto acid (making it an amino acid). This {{is important in the}} biosynthesis of amino acids, as for many of the pathways, intermediates from other biochemical pathways are converted to the α-keto acid skeleton, and then an amino group is added, often via transamination. The amino acids may then be linked <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> protein.|$|E

25|$|If two {{notes are}} {{simultaneously}} played, with frequency ratios that are simple fractions (e.g. 2/1, 3/2 or 5/4), the composite wave is still periodic, {{with a short}} period—and the combination sounds consonant. For instance, a note vibrating at 200Hz and a note vibrating at 300Hz (a perfect fifth, or 3/2 ratio, above 200Hz) add <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> wave that repeats at 100Hz: every 1/100 of a second, the 300Hz wave repeats three times and the 200Hz wave repeats twice. Note that the total wave repeats at 100Hz, {{but there is no}} actual 100Hz sinusoidal component.|$|E
25|$|In {{the field}} of {{biomedical}} research, notably in America, patents were taken out on particular genes, treatments and techniques. From 1991, the NIH permitted patents {{to be taken out}} on anonymous gene fragments. This created extra costs and impediments to creating new treatments and tests. Although in principle rights holders could come <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> deal, cognitive biases exist in rights owners that can often prevent deals that would likely be beneficial from occurring. For example, tests for certain breast cancer mutations were unavailable since the rights holder for the BRCA human gene did not release them onto the market, which lead to false negative tests for cancer. In the end the courts held that human genes were not patentable.|$|E
25|$|The {{information}} in DNA {{is held in}} the sequence of the repeating units along the DNA chain. These units are four types of nucleotides (A,T,G and C) and the sequence of nucleotides stores {{information in}} an alphabet called the genetic code. When a gene is read by a cell the DNA sequence is copied into a very similar molecule called RNA (this process is called transcription). Transcription is controlled by other DNA sequences (such as promoters), which show a cell where genes are, and control how often they are copied. The RNA copy made from a gene is then fed through a structure called a ribosome, which translates the sequence of nucleotides in the RNA into the correct sequence of amino acids and joins these amino acids <b>together</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> complete protein chain. The new protein then folds up into its active form. The process of moving information from the language of RNA into the language of amino acids is called translation.|$|E

Another inspiration for Beyoncé to participate in the campaign were the finalists at the 2012 Do Something Awards and their humanitarian work.|$|E
