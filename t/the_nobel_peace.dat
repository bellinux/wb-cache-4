5|$|A {{number of}} governments linked the award of <b>the</b> <b>Nobel</b> <b>Peace</b> Prize to UN Peacekeepers in 1988 to the UNTAG operation, but the award {{was shared by}} peacekeepers and {{peacekeeping}} operations worldwide.

He was also absent while serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs, not wishing to combine the two roles. He returned briefly afterwards, before leaving again in 1942. Another reason for his inactivity was that he had not lived in Norway since 1940, but either way the Prize was not awarded in any of the years from 1939 to 1943.|$|E

5|$|The {{organization}} won <b>the</b> <b>Nobel</b> <b>Peace</b> Prize in 2001, and {{a number}} of its officers and agencies have also been awarded the prize.

5|$|The {{prize is}} not awarded posthumously; however, {{if a person}} is awarded a prize and dies before {{receiving}} it, the prize may still be presented.

Satyajit Ray received an Academy Honorary Award in 1992 followed by the Bharat Ratna the same year.
