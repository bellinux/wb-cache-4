5|$|Because the Lithuanians did {{not have}} a list of PMO members, they did not arrest the main leaders. Also, provincial PMO {{branches}} remained intact. Therefore, on September 17, 1919, new orders were issued scheduling the second coup attempt for the end of September. This attempt was also discovered. A Lithuanian woman succeeded in convincing Petras Vrubliauskas, PMO deputy commander in Vilnius, <b>to</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>the</b> PMO document archive to the Lithuanians. On September 21, the Lithuanians obtained a full list of PMO members and supporters and arrested them in the following days. The PMO branch in Lithuania ceased to function and was liquidated.|$|E
5|$|Captain Archer is {{confined}} in a Cargo bay, and the aliens are unconvinced that Enterprise carries no currency or valuable materials. They set-off {{to find the}} vault themselves, leaving Krem and Archer <b>to</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>the</b> loot. Archer sees Tucker and sends him to the launch-bay to retrieve the Ferengi's hypospray. Doing so, Tucker revives Sub-Commander T'Pol, and they {{try to find a}} way to stop the Ferengi. She assumes the gas-machine was intentionally placed on the surface as a 'Trojan Horse'. In Sickbay, three of the four Ferengi search for the non-existent vault, and T'Pol uses a PADD to distract and then start an argument between them.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th {{century the}} bishop began {{to reside in}} Llandaff {{for the first time}} in centuries; no bishops of the see resided in Llandaff for almost 300 years. In 1836 there was another {{unsuccessful}} attempt <b>to</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>the</b> see—this time to Bristol. After the attempt at transferring the see, the office of Dean was restored to Llandaff; the position had not been filled in 700 years. The office of Dean was separated from that of the Archdeacon of Llandaff in November 1843. The restoration of the Dean's office was the beginning of better times for the cathedral. The new Dean, William Bruce Knight, was instrumental in bringing about the much-needed restorations.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} days of Operation Goodwood Royal Navy {{planners}} decided not to order further Fleet Air Arm operations against Kaafjord. The planners accepted that the Germans were now able to cover Tirpitz in smoke before Barracudas could reach the battleship, and these aircraft could not carry bombs large enough to inflict heavy damage. Further consideration was given to attacking Kaafjord using Mosquitos launched from aircraft carriers, but the light bombers continued to be in short supply and it was judged that they were not well suited to the task. Moreover, there was a growing need <b>to</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>the</b> carriers to the Pacific to strengthen Britain's contribution to the war against Japan.|$|E

5|$|However, a new wrinkle {{appeared}} {{when the}} City of Denver refused <b>to</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>the</b> {{parcel of land}} on which Pepsi Center stood unless Sturm promised to keep the Avalanche and Nuggets in Denver for at least 25 years. Sturm had made his bid in his own name, and the City wanted to protect itself in case Sturm either died or sold the teams before the 25 years ran out. While Sturm was willing to make a long-term commitment to the city, he wasn't willing to be held responsible if he died or sold the teams. After negotiations fell apart, Liberty bought all of Ascent, but kept the Nuggets and Avalanche on the market.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, the State Roads Commission, the National Park Service, and the Bureau of Public Roads (the {{predecessor}} of the Federal Highway Administration) (FHWA) created tentative plans <b>to</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>the</b> NPS {{segment of}} the parkway {{to the state of}} Maryland, who would then rebuild it to modern freeway standards, with trucks and buses permitted throughout. The plan collapsed due to the state's reluctance to spend the money necessary to reconstruct the parkway, {{which was one of the}} most dangerous roads in the NPS road system.|$|E

This unit required much more shipping space than other British divisions, as its fighting units were supported by thousands of porters. To facilitate the division's movement, additional troopships were assigned to the regular WS convoys. The 81stDivision's advance parties departed Freetown with Convoys WS29 and WS30 in April and May, and the 6th (West Africa) Brigade embarked on ships of Convoy WS31 at Lagos between 2 and 10July. It was planned to transport the division's two remaining brigades in convoys WS32 and WS33.|$|E
5|$|In July 1840, a {{delegation}} headed by Adolphe Crémieux and Sir Moses Montefiore left for Egypt {{to save the}} Jews of Damascus. Crémieux and Montefiore requested Muhammad Ali <b>to</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>the</b> investigation to Alexandria or have the case considered by European judges. However, their request was denied. The delegation, concerned primarily {{with the release of}} the imprisoned Jews of Damascus, decided to accept their liberation without any judicial declaration of their innocence or formal denunciation of the blood libel. The liberation order was issued on August 28, 1840, and, as a compromise, it stated explicitly that {{it was an act of}} justice rather than a pardon granted by the ruler.|$|E
5|$|Juventus {{were founded}} as Sport-Club Juventus in late 1897 by pupils from the Massimo D'Azeglio Lyceum school in Turin, but were renamed as Foot-Ball Club Juventus two years later. The club joined the Italian Football Championship during 1900. In 1904, the {{businessman}} Ajmone-Marsan revived the finances {{of the football}} club Juventus, making it also possible <b>to</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>the</b> training field from piazza d'armi to the more appropriate Velodrome Umberto I. During this period, the team wore a pink and black kit. Juventus first won the league championship in 1905 while playing at their Velodrome Umberto I ground. By this time the club colours had changed to black and white stripes, inspired by English side Notts County.|$|E

This was completed in early December 2015 when the last paper farecard was sold. The faregates stopped accepting paper farecards on March 6, 2016, and the last day for trading in farecards <b>to</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>the</b> value to SmarTrip was June 30, 2016.|$|E
