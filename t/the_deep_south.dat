5|$|Breckinridge {{finished}} third in the popular vote with 849,781 votes to Lincoln's 1,866,452, Douglas's 1,379,957, and Bell's 588,879. He carried 12 of the 15 Southern states and the border states of Maryland, Delaware and North Carolina but lost his home state to Bell. His greatest support in <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>South</b> came from areas that opposed secession. Davis pointed out that only Breckinridge garnered nearly equal support from <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>South,</b> the border states, and the free states of the North. His 72 electoral votes bested Bell's 59 and Douglas's 12, but Lincoln received 180, enough to win the election.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech {{also participated}} in the first {{integrated}} bowl game in <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>South.</b> The 1956 Sugar Bowl featured the 7th ranked Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, and the 11th ranked Pitt Panthers. There was controversy over whether Bobby Grier from Pitt {{should be allowed to}} play because he was black, and whether Georgia Tech should even play at all due to Georgia governor Marvin Griffin's opposition to integration. Ultimately, Bobby Grier played which made the game the first integrated Sugar Bowl and the first integrated bowl game in <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>South.</b>|$|E
5|$|The American robin's {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} woodland and more open farmland and urban areas. It becomes less common as a breeder in the southernmost part of <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>South</b> of the United States, and there prefers large shade trees on lawns. Its winter habitat is similar but includes more open areas.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} Georgia Tech players {{received}} post-season honors. Walker Carpenter, Everett Strupper, and Joe Guyon were All-America selections, with Carpenter and Strupper {{the first two}} players from <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>South</b> selected for a first-team. In addition to Carpenter, Strupper, and Guyon, Bill Fincher, Pup Phillips, Si Bell, Shorty Guill, and Al Hill were selected to the All-Southern Team by sportswriters. Phillips also received the Hal Nowell trophy for the most efficient play during the season.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the federal}} {{government}} criminalized the international slave trade in 1808, after 1820, cultivation of the highly profitable cotton crop exploded in <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>South,</b> and along with it, the slave population. The Second Great Awakening, especially 1800–1840, converted millions to evangelical Protestantism. In the North, it energized multiple social reform movements, including abolitionism; in the South, Methodists and Baptists proselytized among slave populations.|$|E
5|$|During Davis's youth, {{his family}} moved twice: in 1811 to St. Mary Parish, Louisiana, and {{less than a year}} later to Wilkinson County, Mississippi. The {{international}} slave trade was prohibited in 1808, and planters used the domestic slave trade to procure laborers for developing cotton culture in <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>South.</b> Three of Davis's older brothers served in the War of 1812. In 1813, Davis began his education at the Wilkinson Academy in the small town of Woodville, near the family cotton plantation.|$|E

5000|$|In 1892, The {{two schools}} {{met in the}} first meeting {{in what is now}} <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>South’s</b> oldest college {{football}} rivalry. Auburn won the game 10-0. One Atlanta newspaper called it the “social event of the year.” ...|$|R
50|$|The tenth game of {{the season}} is <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>South's</b> Oldest Rivalry against Georgia. In the last meeting, Auburn was held without a first down in the second half as Georgia won 13-7. Georgia leads the all-time series 57-55-8.|$|R
5|$|The Sultanate of Singora, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} Songkhla at Khao Daeng, was a port city in <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> <b>south</b> of Thailand and precursor of the present-day town of Songkhla. It was {{located near the}} southern tip of the Sathing Phra peninsula, on and around the foothills of Khao Daeng Mountain in Singha Nakhon. British and Dutch East India Company traders called the city Sangora; Japanese officials knew it as Shinichu; contemporary French writers used the names Singor, Cingor and Soncourat.|$|E
5|$|The {{size and}} unique history of Texas make its {{regional}} affiliation debatable; {{it can be}} fairly considered a Southern or a Southwestern state, or both. The vast geographic, economic, and cultural diversity within the state itself prohibits easy categorization of the whole state into a recognized region of the United States. Notable extremes range from East Texas which is often considered an extension of <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>South,</b> to Far West Texas which is generally acknowledged {{to be part of}} the interior Southwest.|$|E
5|$|Throughout its history, the {{coverage}} formula remained controversial because it singled out certain jurisdictions, {{most of which}} were in <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>South.</b> In Shelby County v. Holder (2013), the Supreme Court declared {{the coverage}} formula unconstitutional because the criteria used were outdated and thus violated principles of equal state sovereignty and federalism. The other special provisions that are dependent on the coverage formula, such as the Section 5 preclearance requirement, remain valid law. However, without a valid coverage formula, these provisions are unenforceable.|$|E

5|$|Virginia {{made some}} {{attempts}} {{to phase out}} slavery, and manumissions had increased {{in the first two}} decades after the war. Thomas Jefferson Randolph gained passage of an 1832 resolution for gradual abolition in the state, but by that time, increased demand from development in <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>South</b> created a large internal market for slavery. The invention of the cotton gin in the late-eighteenth century had enabled the profitable cultivation of short-staple cotton in the uplands, which was widely used.|$|E
5|$|By 1910, {{thousands}} of African Americans were {{moving from the}} South to Chicago, as a major destination in the Great Migration to northern and midwestern cities, fleeing lynchings, segregation and disenfranchisement in <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>South.</b> The revived Ku Klux Klan committed 64 lynchings in 1918 and 83 in 1919 in southern states. With industrial jobs in the stockyards and meatpacking industry opening as European immigration was cut off by World War I, from 1916 to 1919 the African-American population in Chicago increased from 44,000 to 109,000, a 148 percent increase during the decade.|$|E
5|$|Darrin, {{a shallow}} New York {{advertising}} executive, traveled {{to a small}} town in <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> <b>south</b> upon receiving word that his aunt has died and left him a sizable inheritance. Once in town, Darrin is informed that he will only receive the money if he successfully leads a local gospel group to victory at an upcoming competition. Reluctant but strapped for cash, Darrin takes on the task of finding the best singers in town and shaping the group up. Along the way, he becomes acclimated to the town {{with the help of his}} cousin Lucius (played by Mike Epps) and meets Lilly, a single mother who not only possesses an incredible voice but also the ability to warm Darrin's cold heart.|$|E

5|$|During Strupper's {{three years}} playing for Georgia Tech, the team {{compiled}} {{a record of}} 24–0–2 and outscored its opponents by a combined score of 1,135 to 61. In Georgia Tech's record-setting 222–0 win over Cumberland College in 1916, Strupper scored eight touchdowns. For many years, 1917 Georgia Tech was considered the greatest football team the South ever produced. Strupper starred {{as part of a}} renowned backfield including also Joe Guyon, Judy Harlan, and Al Hill. Strupper and teammate Walker Carpenter were the first players from <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>South</b> selected for an All-America first team.|$|E
5|$|Early on September14, {{the storm}} {{weakened}} to a tropical depression. It weakened slowly while moving northeastward across <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>South,</b> before dissipating near Athens, Georgia on September15. Operationally, {{it was considered}} the third tropical cyclone of the season. A telegraph from the Weather Bureau headquarters in Washington, D.C. warned vessels to remain in port for portions of the Gulf Coast of the United States. Strong gales were experienced along the coast from eastern Louisiana to western Florida and severely disrupted telegraph services in the region. The remnants brought heavy rains from Virginia to New England. Rough seas {{along the coast of}} New Jersey washed the schooner Willie ashore.|$|E
5|$|New York was {{key to the}} election; a Lincoln loss {{there would}} {{deadlock}} the Electoral College. Soon after his return from his Midwest tour, Seward embarked on another, speaking to large crowds across the state of New York. At Weed's urging he went to New York City and gave a patriotic speech before a large crowd on November 3, only {{three days before the}} election. On Election Day, Lincoln carried most Northern states, while Breckinridge took <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>South,</b> Bell three border states, and Douglas won Missouri—the only state Seward campaigned in that Lincoln did not win. Lincoln was elected.|$|E
50|$|Georgia and Auburn {{compete in}} <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>South's</b> Oldest Rivalry, {{dating back to}} 1892. The game was played in Piedmont Park in Atlanta, Georgia. The series is tied at 55-55-8 as {{of the end of}} the 2014 season. It is one of the longest running and most played series in the NCAA.|$|R

50|$|The {{first game}} {{was against the}} University of Georgia at Piedmont Park in Atlanta, Georgia. Auburn won, 10-0, {{in front of a}} crowd of 2,000, in a game that would {{establish}} <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>South's</b> Oldest Rivalry. Auburn and Alabama played their first football game in Lakeview Park in Birmingham, Alabama, on February 22, 1893.|$|R
5|$|Registered merchants {{were forced}} {{by law to}} wear white-colored clothes, an {{indication}} of their low status, and could be singled out for conscription into {{the armed forces and}} forced to resettle in lands to <b>the</b> <b>deep</b> <b>south</b> where malaria was known to be prevalent. In contrast, itinerant merchants were often richer due to their trade between a network of towns and cities and their ability to avoid registering as merchants. Starting with Emperor Gaozu's reign, registered merchants were banned from wearing silk clothes, riding on horseback, or holding public office. This is in stark contrast to unregistered itinerant merchants who Chao Cuo (d. 154 BCE) states wore fine silks, rode in carriages pulled by fat horses, and whose wealth allowed them to associate with government officials.|$|E
5|$|Utica's {{location}} on the Erie and Chenango canals encouraged industrial development, allowing the transport of anthracite from northeastern Pennsylvania for local manufacturing and distribution. Utica's economy centered around the manufacture of furniture, heavy machinery, textiles and lumber. The combined effects of the Embargo Act of 1807 and local investment enabled further expansion of the textile industry. Like other upstate New York cities, mills in Utica processed cotton from <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>South,</b> a slave society. Much of the New York economy was closely involved with slavery; in the antebellum period, half of New York's exports were related to cotton.|$|E
5|$|A {{high risk}} of severe storms—the first such {{issuance}} since April7, 2006—was issued for {{a large part of}} <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>South</b> for March1 as the cold front moved eastward. The activity began almost immediately, with several isolated tornadoes taking place that morning across the Mississippi Valley, with one of them leading to the first fatality of the outbreak. Isolated tornadoes were also reported as far north as Illinois, {{near the center of the}} low. However, the most intense activity began around noon and continued throughout the afternoon and evening, with southern Alabama and southern Georgia hit the hardest. Nearly continuous supercells formed north of the Gulf of Mexico and produced many tornadoes, some of which hit large population centers with devastating effects. Twenty people were killed by those tornadoes.|$|E
50|$|In May 2007, the Alabama Legislature officially {{apologized for}} slavery, making it <b>the</b> fourth <b>Deep</b> <b>South</b> state to do so.|$|R

50|$|The Prayer at Jordan-Hare {{refers to}} a college {{football}} game between Auburn and Georgia and more specifically to the game-winning Hail Mary pass. The play occurred on November 16, 2013 at Jordan-Hare Stadium as the home team No. 7 ranked Auburn hosted No. 25 ranked Georgia in the 117th meeting {{of what is known}} as <b>the</b> <b>Deep</b> <b>South's</b> Oldest Rivalry.|$|R
