40|$|Abstract: Capillary liquid {{chromatography}} (LC) was coupled to electrospray mass spectrometry (MS) {{in order to}} improve the <b>absolute</b> <b>detection</b> limits required for the analysis of DNA adducts. The capillary LC/MS system was compared with conventional LC/MS system using 2 '-deoxyadenosine (dAdo). The <b>absolute</b> <b>detection</b> limit could be improved by a factor 177, leading to the detection of 600 fg of dAdo under single-ion monitoring (SIM) conditions. Using capillary LC/MS, 1 pg of a bisphenol A diglycidyl ether-dAdo addut could be detected under SIM conditions. Full-scan low-energy collision-activated decomposition (CAD) spectra of 550 pg adduct are presented.

Energy dispersive electron probe X-ray microanalysis of freeze-dried cryosections {{is considered to be}} the most efficient technique with respect to spatial analytical resolution and detection limit. The potentialities and limitations of this technique are illustrated by results from 3 current research projects: Element compartmentation in hepatocytes, cytotoxicity of an organotin compound, and calcium movements during osmoregulation of epithelia. At present, the <b>absolute</b> <b>detection</b> limit is 170 atoms in a minimum analytical volume of 30 x 30 x 100 nm(3). X- ray microanalysis of cryosections from biological samples is limited by ice crystal growth during cryofixation and by the poor X-ray collection efficiency in most electron microscopes. Therefore, the construction of an analytical electron microscope dedicated to biological X-ray microanalysis is proposed.

Under low-salt hybridization conditions (10 mM NaPO 4, 5 mM disodium EDTA, and 0. 025 % {{sodium dodecyl sulfate}} [SDS]) a PNA clamp recovered significantly more target DNA than either PNA or DNA oligomers. The efficacy of PNA clamps and oligomers was generally enhanced {{in the presence of}} excess nontarget DNA and in a low-salt extraction-hybridization buffer. Under high-salt conditions (200 mM NaPO 4, 100 mM disodium EDTA, and 0. 5 % SDS), however, capture efficiencies with the DNA oligomer were significantly greater than with the PNA clamp and PNA oligomer. Recovery and detection efficiencies for target DNA concentrations of ≥ 100 pg were generally > 20 % but depended upon the specific probe, solution background, and salt condition. The DNA probe had a lower <b>absolute</b> <b>detection</b> limit of 100 fg of target (830 zM [1 zM = 10 − 21 M]) in high-salt buffer. In the absence of exogenous DNA (e. g., soil background), neither the bis-PNA nor the PNA oligomer achieved the same <b>absolute</b> <b>detection</b> limit even under a more favorable low-salt hybridization condition. In the presence of a soil background, however, both PNA probes provided more sensitive <b>absolute</b> purification and <b>detection</b> (830 zM) than the DNA oligomer.
