40|$|We solve a {{portfolio}} selection problem of an investor with a deterministic savings plan who aims {{to have a}} target wealth value at retirement. The investor is an expected power utility-maximizer. <b>The</b> target <b>wealth</b> value is <b>the</b> maximum <b>wealth</b> that <b>the</b> investor can have at retirement. By constraining the investor to have no more than <b>the</b> target <b>wealth</b> at retirement, {{we find that the}} lower quantiles of <b>the</b> terminal <b>wealth</b> distribution increase, so the risk of poor financial outcomes is reduced. The drawback of the optimal strategy is that the possibility of gains above <b>the</b> target <b>wealth</b> are eliminated...|$|R

If the equation that determines <b>the</b> optimal terminal <b>wealth</b> depletion has multiple solutions, then {{the location of}} the optimal solution will depend on the configuration of the solutions. An optimality test is developed to verify whether a candidate solution for <b>the</b> terminal <b>wealth</b> depletion time is indeed optimal.

It is unlikely that anyone would have possessed the rich gold and silver items found in the Hoxne Hoard without owning items in those other categories. Whoever owned the hoard also would have had wealth in the form of land, livestock, buildings, furniture, and clothing.

Hence <b>the</b> Gini coefficient and growth are positively correlated, holding <b>the</b> population's <b>wealth</b> constant. ...|$|R
