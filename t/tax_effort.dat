40|$|Reassignment {{of local}} {{functions}} to state government and fiscal decentralisation {{seem to be}} contradictory. Whether these fiscal strategies are compatible policy packages is an empirical question. The crucial issue is as to how local governments respond to reassignment, a response which may be reflected in their willingness to spend on remaining functions. If reassignment stimulates local expenditure such that the extent of decline in fiscal decentralisation (the local share in total state-local expenditure) {{is less than the}} amount warranted, the two fiscal strategies can be taken to be compatible. To test this hypothesis, conditions for compatibility are postulated in terms of <b>tax</b> <b>efforts</b> of state and local governments. With use of Indian fiscal data, state and local <b>tax</b> <b>efforts</b> are computed and compared for selected states, as a first approximation. There is no conclusive evidence to show that reassignment has invariably exerted any dampening impact on local expenditure. ...|$|R

Fiscal equalization serves as a mechanism to insure state budgets against asymmetric revenue shocks, but provides almost no insurance against regional income shocks.

50|$|Faced with {{problems}} {{inherited from the}} previous administration, {{the most important of}} which being the large fiscal deficit heightened by the low <b>tax</b> <b>effort</b> due to a weak tax system, Aquino enacted the 1986 Tax Reform Program (TRP). The aim of the TRP was to “simplify the tax system, make revenues more responsive to economic activity, promote horizontal equity and promote growth by correcting existing taxes that impaired business incentives”. One of the major reforms enacted under the program was the introduction of the Value Added Tax (VAT), which was set at 10%. The 1986 tax reform program resulted in reduced fiscal imbalance and higher <b>tax</b> <b>effort</b> in the succeeding years, peaking in 1997, before the enactment of the 1997 Comprehensive Tax Reform Program (CTRP). The share of non-tax revenues during this period soared due to the sale of sequestered assets of President Marcos and his cronies (totalling to about ₱20 billion), the initial efforts to deregulate the oil industry and thrust towards the privatization of state enterprises. Public debt servicing and interest payments as a percent of the budget peaked during this period as government focused on making up for the debt incurred by the Marcos administration. Another important reform enacted during the Aquino administration was the passage of the 1991 Local Government Code which enabled fiscal decentralization. This increased the taxing and spending powers to local governments in effect increasing local government resources.|$|E

40|$|This paper simulates {{alternative}} {{distributions of}} general purpose state aid to local governments under {{different combinations of}} criteria: <b>tax</b> capacity, <b>effort,</b> and revenue needs. Revenue needs are based on Tobit estimates {{of the costs of}} providing average levels of 16 categories of services. Segmenting the sample into high and low population jurisdictions provided a more realistic set of cost estimates. Available revenues or capacity are determined by multiplying each jurisdiction's tax bases by standard tax rates. A Need-Capacity gap, the difference between needed revenues and available revenues, is used as a needs-based distribution strategy for general purpose aid.

It was estimated that Salisbury's tax rate would decrease by 17 mills in the 1992-93 school year, and the Meyersdale's tax rate would increase by 8 mills in the 1992- 93 school year. The merger did not take place, despite Meyersdale's desire to proceed with it.|$|E
50|$|President Estrada, who assumed {{office at}} the height of the Asian {{financial}} crisis, faced a large fiscal deficit, which was mainly attributed to the sharp deterioration in the <b>tax</b> <b>effort</b> (as a result of the 1997 CTRP: increased tax incentives, narrowing of VAT base and lowering of tariff walls) and higher interest payments given the sharp depreciation of the peso during the crisis.

40|$|We derive {{determinants}} of tax avoidance {{by means of}} a multi-task principal-agent model.

First, the principal's after-tax profit can increase with a higher corporate tax rate. Second, <b>tax</b> planning <b>effort</b> can decrease in the corporate tax rate. Third, operational effort can increase with increasing corporate tax rates. We show that differences in productivities, differences in operational and tax risk and the correlations of these risks are crucial determinants for the optimal degree of tax avoidance. These determinants can explain why some firms are more tax aggressive than others and should therefore be considered in empirical studies. Related to this insight, we demonstrate that our results are consistent with recent empirical evidence...|$|R
50|$|For the 1972-73 school year, the {{effective}} yield per pupil ranged anywhere from $20,000 to approximately $170,000 per student. Taxpayers in property-poor towns paid higher tax rates for education than taxpayers in property-rich towns. The higher tax rates generated smaller tax revenues, and property-poor towns {{could not afford}} to spend as much per pupil on education as property-rich towns where less <b>tax</b> <b>effort</b> generated more money. The Court found that this funding system ensured that more educational dollars were allotted to children who lived in property-rich towns than to children in property-poor towns. This enabled the property-rich towns to offer a wider range and higher quality of education programs than other towns. It also provided students in property-rich towns with more course offerings and library resources, expanded special education, better learning disability teachers and facilities, and many other opportunities.|$|E
50|$|Fiscal policy {{during the}} Marcos {{administration}} was primarily focused on indirect tax collection and on government spending on economic services and infrastructure development.

The Ramos administration experienced budget surpluses due to substantial gains from the massive sale of government assets and strong foreign investment iyears and administrations. The Estrada administration faced a large fiscal deficit due to the decrease in <b>tax</b> <b>effort</b> and the repayment of the Ramos administration’s debt to contractors and suppliers.

50|$|After his {{appointment}} {{as a member}} of the Planning Commission of India, Gadgil conducted studies on the pattern of allocation of central assistance to the states in the Five-Year Plans of India. In 1969, he evolved a set of guidelines for the purpose, popularly known as the Gadgil formula, which formed the base of central assistance to states in the Fourth and the Fifth Five-Year Plans of India. The proposals were based on the parameters such as Population (60%), Per Capita Income (10%), <b>Tax</b> <b>Effort</b> (10%), On-going Irrigation and Power Projects (10%) and Special Problems (10%). Later, on insistence from the state governments, the formula was revised (modified Gardgil formula) as Population (55%), PCI (25% - calculated by deviation and distance methods), Fiscal Management (5%) and Special Development Problems (15%). In 1990, the standards were again modified, when Pranab Mukherjee, the incumbent President of India, held the post of the deputy chairmanship of the Planning Commission, and the new set of rules came to be known as Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{theoretical}} analysis {{considers the}} impact of a typical system of redistributive “fiscal equalization ” transfers on the <b>taxing</b> <b>effort</b> of local jurisdictions. More specifically, it shows that the marginal contribution rate, i. e. the rate at which an increase in the tax base is reducing those transfers, might be positively associated with the local tax rate while the volume of grants received is likely to be inversely related to the tax base. These predictions are tested in an empirical analysis of the tax policy of German municipalities. In order to identify the incentive effect the analysis exploits discontinuities in the rules of the fiscal equalization system as well as policy changes. The empirical results support the existence of an incentive effect, suggesting that the high marginal contribution rates induce the municipalities to raise their business tax rates significantly...|$|R
