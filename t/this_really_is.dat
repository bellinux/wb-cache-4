500|$|As part of DC Comics' 2011 relaunch, The New 52, Barbara Gordon's {{paralysis}} {{is described}} as lasting only three years time. In Batgirl (volume 4), the character's age is reduced, and she is depicted as a recent college graduate, having {{earned a degree in}} forensic psychology. Although she resumes her work as Batgirl one year after recovering her mobility, she continues to suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder, causing her to hesitate in battle when exposed to gunfire that could result in receiving new spinal damage. The character also exhibits survivor guilt due to the fact she has made a full recovery from her paralysis while others have not. In a September 2011 interview, Gail Simone stated, [...] "I'm enjoying writing Batgirl at this stage in her life. She's younger, she doesn't know everything, she's been immersed in school and her life-plan. Events conspire to change that plan, and she's nervous about that. I love writing Barbara under pretty much any conditions, but <b>this</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> a key time for her." ...|$|E

Mendelson felt [...] "this [...] a fine final trailer, teasing what we already know, hinting at the scale and a few new action beats without telling us much we don't already know" [...] adding, [...] "Here we have the fourth and final Avengers: Age of Ultron trailer and we don't know all that much about what transpires in a moment-to-moment sense in the finished 150-minute feature. I have expressed my concern dating back to October that Marvel and Disney would release too many trailers and would by default give away too much plot and character information between October and May. But if <b>this</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> the final Avengers 2 trailer, then {{at least on the}} trailer front they have kept the film relatively unspoiled." [...] A week after the final trailer debuted, Marvel revealed that the trailer had [...] "smashed records" [...] with over 35 million views.|$|E
500|$|Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. On the critic review aggregator site Metacritic, the album holds {{a score of}} 71/100, based on 39 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favourable" [...] reviews. At Digital Spy, Adam Silverstein commends that [...] "more often than not, Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action is this band sharpening their particular surefire indie to glittering distinction." [...] Commenting on the band's future, {{he says that the}} [...] "half-sorry, half-bitter 'Goodbye Lovers & Friends' is probably not Franz Ferdinand's very last act, even if Kapranos proclaiming in the final seconds 'But <b>this</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> the end' would make one awesome blowout. Although after delivering a record as good as this, they can take as long as they want". At The A.V. Club, Annie Zaleski wrote positively of the musical differences between many of this album's tracks compared to the band's prior work, adding: [...] "Admittedly, these more nuanced Right Thoughts, Right Words, Right Action sounds aren't as easily accessible; it's much easier to gravitate toward more familiar raucous post-punk ('Bullet,' 'Right Action') or the Clash-reminiscent punk-funk of 'Evil Eye.' But by expanding its worldview, Franz Ferdinand has very nicely settled onto a path toward career longevity." ...|$|E

Kevin Wierzbicki from antiMusic.com rated this album with {{three and a half}} stars commenting that [...] "Sting in the Tail is pretty much a typical Scorpions effort filled with well-performed but ultimately forgettable rockers". Two reviewers gave the album almost full score. Tony Antunovich from Metaleater.com gave the album A- stating that [...] "is a solid effort and focuses primarily on slightly toned-down Rock anthems performed in SCORPIONS style", while Aniruddh [...] "Andrew" [...] Bansal of Metal Assault nine and a half out of ten by saying that [...] "If <b>this</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> the last album they would ever record, I would say with a heavy heart that it's the perfect way to say goodbye to the fans" [...] Ruben Mosqueda from Sleaze Roxx gave a positive review to the album by saying that [...] "Sting in the Tail is a near perfect album and one hell of a way to wind up a career". Former drummer Herman Rarebell said [...] "I like the new album very much. I think that is the way people hear the Scorpions." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, Lithuania's {{economic}} transition {{left the}} country in a difficult financial situation, and LKF could hardly count on state funding. As a result, the team had to search for the financial supporters by themselves in order to play internationally. Šarūnas Marčiulionis had experience and contacts in the United States for being the first USSR player in the NBA, playing for the Golden State Warriors. Consequently, he, along with Donnie Nelson (son of Marčiulionis' then-coach Don Nelson), searched for financial supporters that could finance Lithuania's participation in the international games and the 1992 Summer Olympics. George Shirk wrote a story about this on the San Francisco Chronicle, and once American rock band Grateful Dead read the newspaper, they decided to help the team. Drummer Mickey Hart added that the story resonated with the bandmembers for being a [...] "a struggle for life, liberty and freedom." [...] The bandmembers donated $5,000 to Marčiulionis, and helped launch a tie-dyed jerseys trade that would feature Lithuania's national colors, and the iconic, trademarked 'Slam-Dunking Skeleton' created by N.Y. artist [...] The skeleton dunking a flaming basketball, nicknamed [...] "Skully", was the artist's interpretation of how the Lithuanian team rose from the ashes to victory. [...] The artist's profits would be passed onto the Lithuania national basketball team and a fund for Lithuanian children. The Lithuanians were favourable to the garish shirts because, according to Nelson, it was a great contrast to [...] "all those years of those Soviet colors, nothing but blues and grays". Arvydas Sabonis even said that [...] "My first impression of [...] was: Wow, <b>this</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> a free Lithuania". The skeleton, nicknamed [...] "Skully", was enshrined into the Basketball Hall of Fame, being the only cartoon character to be enshrined in any sports Hall of Fame. New versions of the Skully jerseys were featured in the following two Olympic Games.|$|E

2500|$|A more long-running romantic pairing was {{featured}} between Mel {{and the character}} Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), who was portrayed as a villain. It was an on/off romance beginning shortly after both characters' introduction in 1998. In an interview in June 2000, Kemp discussed the relationship between Steve and Mel: [...] "Steve's convinced Mel will make his life complete. She kept him going during all the bad times and now he's determined to have her. It's true {{of a lot of}} guys who get into trouble, they hang their hat on one idea and that keeps them sane [...] there's a driving force that kept them going while they were [...] And often that's a woman. You know from those tender moments when Mel came to visit Steve [...] that she was the thing that kept him going, and he won't stop til he gets her back." [...] Eventually the couple were shown to marry in the soap in March 2001, despite a revelation that Mel had strayed with Steve's nemesis Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Tamzin Outhwaite explained, [...] "With Ian, Mel was the one who didn't want to go through with it. This time around Mel is the one who is apprehensive, hoping Steve will be there for her. If he isn't, she has no reason to stay in Walford. <b>This</b> <b>really</b> <b>is</b> make or break time for her." [...] The wedding night was a precursor to one of the soap's most publicised storylines, Who Shot Phil?, where Phil was gunned down by an unknown assailant and, due to Mel's infifelity, Steve became one of the prime suspects for the murder attempt, though he transpired to be a red herring. Discussing Mel and Steve's wedding, Outhwaite said, [...] "Even though this wedding with Steve has got as much controversy as Mel's last one , it feels more true. The characters seem more suited and it's not a big, white wedding, it's a low-key register office thing." [...] 17 million viewers watched the wedding.|$|E
