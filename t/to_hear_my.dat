Sasha Fierce, {{as it is a}} ballad that shows Knowles' insecurities about love, and the person she is [...] "{{underneath}} all the makeup, underneath the lights and underneath all the exciting star drama". Knowles has said that she loves singing ballads because, [...] "the music and the emotion in the story is told [...] so much better. It's a better connection because you can hear it and it's not all these other distractions. I really wanted people <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> voice and hear what I had to say."

500|$|Munnerlyn {{was drafted}} by the Carolina Panthers in the seventh round (216th overall) of the 2009 NFL Draft. Munnerlyn called being drafted by the Panthers, [...] "{{exciting}}, because I played college ball at South Carolina, and that's only like an hour away. It was exciting <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> name get called. I'm ready for it, ready to take my game to the next level." [...] Munnerlyn holds the Panthers career interception return touchdown record with 5 touchdowns and is tied for the club's single-season record with 2, a feat he achieved in both 2012 and 2013 seasons, the only Panthers player to have multiple [...] interception return scores in a season twice. The 5 interception touchdowns ranked second in the NFL from 2010-2014.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Essence magazine, Beyoncé explained that [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] is [...] "broad" [...] and different from her previous releases {{because it is not}} a traditional R song. She added, [...] "I had to try it, because I remember Aretha Franklin said a great singer can sing anything and make it her own." [...] Beyoncé was also motivated by her audience's strong expectations from her as a singer. While preparing her third solo album, Beyoncé wanted to experiment with stronger lyrics and record ballads like [...] "If I Were a Boy" [...] because, [...] "the music and the emotion in the story is told [...] so much better. It's a better connection because you can hear it and it's not all these other distractions. I really wanted people <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> voice and hear what I had to say." ...|$|E

500|$|Stargate and Beyoncé {{produced}} [...] "Broken-Hearted Girl" [...] in 2008 at Roc the Mic Studios in New York City. Beyoncé arranged & {{performed the}} vocals, which Jim Caruana recorded. Eriksen assisted in recording the instrumental track &, along with Hermansen, arranged the music & played the instruments. Mark [...] "Spike" [...] Stent and Matt Green then mixed the track. [...] "Broken-Hearted Girl" [...] is {{included on the}} double album I Am... Sasha Fierce {{as part of the}} I Am... disc, which features ballads that describe Beyoncé's insecurities about love and depict the person she is [...] "underneath all the makeup, underneath the lights and underneath all the exciting star drama". Beyoncé said she likes to sing ballads because [...] "the music and the emotion in the story is told [...] so much better. It's a better connection because you can hear it and it's not all these other distractions. [...] I really wanted people <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> voice and hear what I had to say." ...|$|E
500|$|Cornell {{stated that}} the biggest two {{influences}} on [...] "You Know My Name" [...] were Tom Jones, who performed the theme for Thunderball, and Paul McCartney, who composed and performed the theme for Live and Let Die. [...] "I decided that I was going to sing it like Tom Jones, in that crooning style. I wanted people <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> voice," [...] Cornell said. [...] "And 'Live and Let Die' is a fantastic song. Paul McCartney wouldn't have written it if not for that movie. I [...] {{wanted to write a}} song in its own universe. I knew I'd never have it again — a big orchestra — so I wanted to have fun with it." [...] Cornell did not put the film's title in the lyrics, because he [...] "couldn't imagine it fitting into a song lyric that would come out of my mouth". And he jokingly stated [...] "Casino Royale didn't make a good rock title, but I would write a song named Octopussy just for fun".|$|E
500|$|Tedder and Beyoncé {{produced}} [...] "Halo" [...] in 2008 at Los Angeles' Manfield Studios, and at New York City's Germano and Roc The Mic Studios. Tedder did {{the musical}} arrangements {{and played the}} instruments, while Christian Baker assisted in recording the music. Mark [...] "Spike" [...] Stent mixed the track with assistance from Matt Green, and Jim Caruana recorded Beyoncé's vocals; both these tasks were done at Roc the Mic Studios. [...] "Halo" [...] is present on the I Am... disc of the double album I Am... Sasha Fierce, {{as it is a}} ballad that shows Beyoncé's insecurities about love, and the person she is [...] "underneath all the makeup, underneath the lights and underneath all the exciting star drama".

500|$|It {{was this}} concept which {{intrigued}} Madonna, {{while she was}} developing her third studio album True Blue (1986). She said, [...] "I hate it when people do master mixes of my records. I don't want <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> songs changed like that. I don't know that I like it, people screwing with my records. The jury is out on it for me. But the fans like it, and really, this one was for the fans, for {{the kids in the}} clubs who wanted to hear these songs in a fresh new way." [...] She went to Warner with the idea of releasing her songs by remixing them in a complete dance tune. From Warner's point of view, the rise of remix was a commercial boon, because it meant making more money out of the same piece of music. Instead of paying Madonna to go to studio and record different tracks, they found that allowing her to record the same tracks in different formats was much less costly. Hence they decided to release the album, but gave full freedom to Madonna to choose the producers with whom she wanted to develop the remixes.|$|E
500|$|On October 18, 2010, Bieber {{announced}} on his Twitter {{plans for an}} acoustic album {{in time for the}} holiday season, and that it would feature unplugged versions of his songs, as well as a new song. Days later, on October 24, 2010, he revealed that the album was set for release on November 26, 2010. In an interview with MTV News, Bieber said that the album was for the [...] "haters" [...] who say he cannot sing and saying his voice was auto-tuned, and that [...] "stripping it down and having it kind of really mellow and being able <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> voice" [...] was his purpose. The singer said he wanted to do the acoustic set because the Electronic Music production sometimes [...] "drowns out your voice" [...] and [...] "takes away from the singer, over the synths and everything." [...] According to Kyle Anderson of MTV News the album might not have been [...] "just another project", but rather the purpose could be [...] "to prove the he has the skills to sustain a long and fulfilling career." [...] In the same interview he confirmed that [...] "Baby" [...] and other My World 2.0 songs were re-recorded, as well as a new song.|$|E
500|$|On May 18, 2011, 4s {{release date}} in the United States was {{confirmed}} on to be June 28. On June 7, the album was leaked onto the Internet in full; Beyoncé's legal representatives issued warnings to infringing websites and leaked tracks were soon removed from such sites. On June 9, Beyoncé responded to the leak through Facebook, commenting, [...] "My music was leaked and while {{this is not how}} I wanted to present my new songs, I appreciate the positive response from my fans. When I record music I always think about my fans singing every note and dancing to every beat. I make music to make people happy and I appreciate that everyone has been so anxious <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> new songs." [...] Following the leak, reports circulated that Columbia Records executives hoped to cover their assets in fear that the album may be a commercial failure. Rumors had suggested that the label requested from Beyoncé to make changes to the record and reunite Destiny's Child, claims Columbia denied. In August 2013, NME reported that Sony Music were suing a 47-year-old man from Gothenburg for US$233,000 concerning the leak of 4. The deluxe version was released simultaneously with the standard edition in several countries. In the United States, it was available exclusively through Target stores.|$|E

He was aware of his unique performance style even in the early 1960s when he commented, [...] "I'm not a super personality—on stage or off. I mean, you could put workers like Chubby Checker or Bobby Rydell in second-rate shows and they'd still shine through, but not me. I'd have to be prepared.

2500|$|Saccharin was {{produced}} first in 1879, by Constantin Fahlberg, a chemist working on coal tar derivatives in Ira Remsen's laboratory at the Johns Hopkins University. Fahlberg noticed a sweet taste {{on his hand}} one evening, and connected this with the compound benzoic sulfimide on {{which he had been}} working that day. Fahlberg and Remsen published articles on benzoic sulfimide in 1879 and 1880. In 1884, then working on his own in New York City, Fahlberg applied for patents in several countries, describing methods of producing this substance that he named saccharin. Two years later, he began production of the substance in a factory in a suburb of Magdeburg, Germany. [...] Fahlberg would soon grow wealthy, while Remsen merely grew irritated, believing he deserved credit for substances produced in his laboratory. On the matter, Remsen commented, [...] "Fahlberg is a scoundrel. It nauseates me <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> name mentioned in the same breath with him." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rap-Up magazine on September 2, 2011, Kevin McCall revealed {{that he had been}} collaborating [...] "heavily" [...] with Brown on the album. Later that month, producer David Banner told NeonLimeLight.com that the album will [...] "bring people back to the clubs" [...] and that it will [...] "change the way people look at R". He also revealed details of a song that he and Brown recorded for the album, saying: [...] "When I tell you, you know how they don't play that much R in the club no more?...The song that me and Chris made, they are going to play it like they used to play Jodeci. Like they used to play Keith Sweat. The song that me and Chris made is so jamming". On January 7, 2012, Brown revealed via his official Twitter account that there was only two weeks left of recording sessions for the album, tweeting [...] "LAST TWO WEEKS of me finishing FORTUNE! I'm excited for all the fans <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> real music". The tweet was soon followed up by another, with the singer tweeting [...] "Dub step records on my album sounding crazy!!!!". However, the tweet was later removed, suggesting that Brown gave away too much details about the album.|$|E

Can you imagine working for a fucking year, {{and you get a}} B+ from some asshole in The Village Voice?" [...] Christgau rated the album C+ and wrote in his review, [...] "I thank Lou for pronouncing my name right." [...] In December 1980, Christgau provoked angry responses from Voice readers when his column approvingly quoted his wife Carola Dibbell's reaction to the murder of John Lennon: [...] "Why is it always Bobby Kennedy or John Lennon? Why isn't it Richard Nixon or Paul McCartney?" [...] Similar angst came from Sonic Youth in their song [...] "Kill Yr Idols" [...] (at the time known as [...] "I Killed Christgau with My Big Fucking Dick"), in which they sing [...] "I don't know why / You wanna impress Christgau / Ah let that shit die / And find out the new goal"; Christgau responded by saying [...] "Idolization is for rock stars, even rock stars manqué like these impotent bohos—critics just want a little respect. So if it's not too hypersensitive of me, I wasn't flattered <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> name pronounced right, not on this particular title track." ...|$|E

[...] Producer Darkchild told The Hollywood Reporter that it was a [...] "smart decision", while Claude Kelly remarked that the move could work in her favor, citing [...] "I will say that I'd be willing to bet that the reason it was pushed back was not for anything as horrible or earth-shattering as people think — it's probably (sic) a better setup". It was also reported that the delay was caused by the internal restructuring at Sony Music with the former Universal Music Group chairman Doug Morris entering as its new CEO. On July 11, 2011, several demo songs that Clarkson recorded, ranging from 50 to 70, were leaked into the internet, some of which were recorded in 2002 while Clarkson was still recording Thankful, and for Stronger. RCA immediately issued warnings to infringing websites, and leaked tracks were soon removed from such sites. Clarkson, who came home after spending a vacation in Tahiti, released a statement, saying [...] "I get back in the States from a vacation and somehow 50 of my songs are leaked on the Internet?! There's no point in getting angry because there's nothing I can do. I can't wait for everybody <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>my</b> actual finished fifth album."
